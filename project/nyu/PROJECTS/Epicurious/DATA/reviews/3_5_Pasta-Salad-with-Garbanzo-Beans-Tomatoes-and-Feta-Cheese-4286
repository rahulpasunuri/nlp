Wonderful tasting pasta salad. Excellent dish to welcome the warm weather with. My girlfriend doesn't like mint (not sure how) so I used Coriander instead. It still tasted great!

The mint and chickpeas clashed in my opinion, not to mention that the texture of chickpeas and pasta are so similar the is a lot of redundancy in this dish. Needed a lot more vegetables or less pasta/beans.

I loved the recipe. Used my own mint and goat feta. No tomatoes yet, so I used sun-dried. I also put in some kalamata olives. Wonderful and refreshing. Thank you for this recipe!

over all I liked this recipe however, I was looking for a good way to incorporate garbanzo beans and this was not it. Next time, I would make it without. Really, this is similar to a wilted salad I make often w/arugala so I added that too, and more garlic than it called for and olives - but the mint adds a nice twist. Next time: more mint, no beans - they just seemed like an after thought in this dish.

Simple, fast, and delicious! I've already made this recipe twice and served it as a main dish. The vinegrette is delicious and the garbanzo beans add a nice creaminess. I added kalamata olives once, and that was a good(but not necessary) addition. This is a keeper.

I made this for an easter gathering and it was pefect. It will be my go to for pasta salad. I used 3 color spirals to add color, added the cucumber. Next time I will put in more feta and add calamata olives. My son in law, who has an excellent palate, was able to identify every ingredient except the mint, so next time I will add more. Good wine vinegar and evoo are a must!!!

Added cucumber at the suggestion of another reviewer. Light and delicious. Will make this again for a cookout.

This was a very tasty, refreshing pasta salad. I followed the recipe as is, but also added kalmata olives. I used white pasta, and I have to say it looked very boring so not many people tried it; have to play around with colors to make it more visually appealing.

delicious! added diced cucumber, reduced olive oil to 4 tbsp. yum!

This is yummy. I don't see how anyone could say it is bland unless subpar ingredients were used. Quality tomatoes, cheese, and olive oil shine here. Fresh garlic and mint are also a must.

I have been making this recipe for years with many compliments! I find the typical pasta salads to be too overpowering in flavor. Too much italian dressing. This is a perfect compliment to almost any spring/summer meal!

I thought this was good, but at a party it didn't really get eaten and nobody said anything to me about it, so it wasn't outstanding, it was ok.

It was good but I would add a little less lemon zest and juice next time (it was a bit overpowering).

I was a little skeptical about the mint, but this was really a fabulous recipe! The combination of fresh lemon, fresh garlic and fresh mint was a winning one!

very nice, mellow lemony dish, but kicked it up a notch with some black olives & fresh flat minced parsley added.

Very easy and tasty pasta salad...great for a hot day. Dressing and pasta perfect...added black and green olives, hearts of palm and basil instead of mint. Used chunk feta cut into cubes as that is my preference...more cheese per bite. Many compliments on this dish.

easy, simple. we added some dill to help add flavor. It was good, but a little simple. I would make it again, with a few additions, otherwise, everyone really enjoyed the salad.

THIS IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE SUMMER SALAD RECIPES. THE ONLY CHANGE THAT I MADE WAS TO USE CHERRY OR GRAPE TOMATOES CUT IN HALF. HAVE MADE IT SEVERAL TIMES THIS SUMMER.

I was looking for a pasta salad with a little pizzaz. This was so bland it was terrible.

I really enjoyed this. I used small shell pasta, didn't have any lemon zest, and used goat cheese instead of feta. The dressing was really fresh, light, and delicious. Served with grilled salmon topped with parsley butter. Yum!

Probably 3.5 forks, but I will round up because I got so many compliments. (I made it for a bridal shower.) I followed the recipe exactly and used organic mint, chickpeas and tomatoes. The flavors are light, but not bland.

A really light and refreshing dish. I substituted grape tomatoes for the plum and added kalamata olives. Really easy to make and my family loved it.

The flavor mix of lemon, garlic and mint really bursts in this pasta. The first time I used Italian seasoning and it was good but lacking a bit...I had to add a pinch or 2 of salt. The second time with mint and w/o the beans - yummy! It's really an excellent recipe and I'm sure I'll make it over and over again...with penne pasta, w/o garbanzo beans, with cherry tomatoes, etc...

I loved this recipe! The mint is really fantastic. My family didn't like the chickpeas, but I loved them. I made it again, but used toasted pine nuts instead to please the fam. Would stick to the garbanzo if it were just for me though

I thought this was a great meal for a hot evening. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I forgot to add lemon zest which didn't hurt it any and I only used half a pound of pasta due to others suggestions. Since the typo states white wine and later we find out it is white wine vinegar the recipe calls for (which I didn't have on hand) I used 1.5 T of Pinot Grigio and 1/2T of white vinegar.

This was a great salad! I will make this again soon. The lemon and mint is very nice. I added Kalamata olives as well.

Fantastic. A huge hit at a casual lunch. I used dill instead of mint, and used a little bit less olive oil (I more than doubled the recipe, using 2 lbs of pasta but only 10 tablespoons of olive oil) and it was flavorful and not oily at all.

Very good base recipe. I used white zinfandel because that's what I had, and it turned out well. I also added black olives for some color variety and increased the amount of feta (my friends are big feta lovers). Simple and good.

I've made this dish now twice, both times it's been great. After reading more reviews, I'll try it with some additions. It does get a little dry after a day or two, I just add a little olive oil before eating again. Will be making it again this weekend!

i added green olives and extra vinegar-(red wine), as well as 2 jars of marinated artichoke hearts--really fun to just open the pantry and see what is there!!!

Very tasty and easy! Added salt and pepper and used basil instead of mint. Great summery side dish for grilled chicken or fish.

I used white wine instead of white wine vinegar, and it was fantastic! the first time i made it, i let the dressing sit longer together without the pasta, and i used "french sheep's milk" feta. it was ten times better than the second time, when i was limited to a block of athenos brand feta. definitely a visually appealing keeper.

September in mid-western Pennsylvania sees the garden herbs losing their fervor. Peppermint, last-of-the-basil, and a few snips of parsley went in the salad. Increased the white wine to two glassfuls, as accompaniment to the meal - used moscatel vinegar for the salad dressing. Kalamatas added per Santa Barbaras excellent suggestion. Terrific base recipe for garbanzo bean salad!

Rating: 3
the pasta would taste even better if i increased my dressing proportions. pepper also brought out all the flavors.

I used just one average clove of garlic and it was quite enough. I added extra feta and lemon, plus some slivered kalamata olives. The salad tasted like summer! The next time I made it, I substituted basil for the mint, and that was also very good. I think dill would also work, and that marinated artichoke hearts would be a nice addition.

Rating: 3
Very good and very easy. The vinegar that the previous reviewer said wasn't listed was the white wine (vinegar) - I often wonder if they proofread their recipes because I find tons of mistakes. Anyway, will make this again and again.

Will definitely do again. Tweaked by adding olives & capers, more lemon juice & peel for an Oh So Delish hint of tang. Substituted fresh dill for the mint and grape tomatoes from my garden. I think it may be impossible to add too much Feta cheese.

This was really light tasting and delicious! I substituted frozen green peas for the garbanzo beans, which made for a very colorful dish. Also added a little chopped red onion, for crunch. I'm not usually a fan of mint; here it added more an herb flavor, than one of mint. The first time I made it with white wine, the second used white wine vinegar; either seemed to work fine. A new summer favorite for us.

The recipe does not have vinegar listed in the ingredient list, but refer to it in the directions. Anyway---I added more lemon juice and more mint and lots of salt...a hit at a garden party recently.

An OK salad - I didn't find it to be anything special. Nice for the summer. It's hard to go far astray with a pasta salad.

I modified the recipe by omitting the pasta and adding more tomatoes, less oil and no lemon juice. I added fresh basil instead with some olives and capers. The white wine is an excellent touch!

I used less pasta (ca. 1/2 lb) and small grape tomatoes. Very tasty.

12 ounces of pasta is too much, also without additional tomatoes, garlic and we used an olive oil spray to offset yhe dryness. After tinkering for 3 days, we achieved a good flavor.

I substituted dill for mint and orzo for fusilli, and it's absolutely excellent--a summer favorite!

A bbq party hit! After reading other comments, I decided to try this recipe with a few tweaks. Instead, used Red Wine Vinegar -- added some fresh chopped Dill, and some sliced green onions, and increased amount of tomatoes. Lots of salt needed, but got rave reviews from everyone!

I only gave this a 2 because feta and garbanzos are among my favorite foods. Otherwise, I thought for all of it's effort, the salad lost it's flavor after sitting for a few hours refrigerated. It also became a very heavy combination to have the main ingredients be pasta and garbanzos. Might be better and lighter with cucumbers and onions added and more feta/less pasta.
