Great recipe! I added bean sprouts and omitted the noodles for some of them. My husband preferred them that way. I was worried about using rice paper rounds, but they turned out to be easy and forgiving. I didn't have any rip on me. My kids (6&8) were split; one liked it, the other not so much.

I was a little afraid of the rice paper rounds before trying this, but they were easy. I also wasn't sure if they would hold up for leftovers or if they would fall apart. Not a problem. The rolls are yummy, sauce is delicious, and I now make extra to make sure we've got extras for the next couple day's lunches.

My family loves Vietnamese Summer rolls and this recipe is a good one. I like to add a few ingredients - chicken and bean sprouts (bean sprouts are a MUST at my house). I love this sauce, but when I'm lacking peanut butter, I like it with just hoison sauce (I add a little bit of hot water to thin it out) OR with sweet chili sauce (my favorite).
