I started with the rum sauce and had one of my worst cooking disasters ever. I have never made caramel before so perhaps that was the trouble? There must be more to it than just adding the rum 'carefully'?

This recipe was a disaster for me from start to finish--one of the few I would ever actually warn against trying. I made the caramel and the brittle (exhausting) and they both turned out tasting bitter (I must have over cooked). Then, the fruit must need to be ripe (mine wasn't). Yuk.

From this recipe, I actually only made the rum-caramel sauce and the nut brittle, both to go over and with banana sorbet (the recipe for which is also in the Epicurious files). I reviewed the chile-macadamia brittle under that recipe. But here's what I have to say about the rum caramel sauce: Divine! Very, very nice caramel, very sensuous, delicious, downright sexy. Should keep fine for a while in my fridge too.

Sounds good, but the picture sure does nothing to encourage me to try it!
