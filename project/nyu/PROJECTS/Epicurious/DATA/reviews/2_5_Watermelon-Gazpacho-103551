Yikes. I'm going to have to go out and get more ingredients. I'm thinking cucumber, mint, and crab. With red-pepper oil to drizzle. I also like the idea of serving it with Strawberries or a mango. But this should be a very small dish. As a soup- no bueno.

Definitely "okay." It wasn't the pretty color in the picture, more pepto bismol pink, and the garlic was pretty strong. I kind of liked it at least at first, and agree with the reviewer who suggested serving it in shot glasses at a party for a pre-starter. That would be fun and give just enough of it before you realized that it is just a bit too weird. The texture was a bit grainy from the bread, the taste a bit sharp from the raw garlic and the color a bit shocking from the almonds, I think.

First, I am amazed by how many people don't get that watermelon CAN be savory, and spectacular! Let go of your expectations, and let a new experience reveal itself-- you might be pleasantly surprised. To those that DO enjoy savory watermelon, there is a great recipe for watermelon soup with crab on Epicurious too. For this recipe, I changed a couple things-- rice cakes instead of bread (celiac), and a different oil and vinegar selection: balsamic and sesame. I did not strain out the solids or add the ice cubes, and was very happy with my richer, almost creamy soup, which I served over sliced strawberries. I also added a few in the blender too. I felt that the strawberries cut the sharpness of the garlic just the right amount. The beauty of using watermelon as a soup base is that it is so mild that you can really take it anywhere, in creative terms. Next time, I might try lemon or lime juice instead of vinegar, or try different fruit combos, like mango or cantaloupe. Mine wasn't as light as a true gazpacho, but really, this is too easy to screw up with a little tinkering. Even my seven year old enjoyed it.

we thought this was very nice. the garlic and lots of black pepper gave it heat while the melon and extra nice olive oil I drizzled on top made it lush. I think it would be really nice in shot glasses as an amuse for a summer party.

Was it just me or was this dish a little weird? It wasn't dreadful just tasted like something my daughter would come up with if left alone in the kitchen. Oh well, worth a try!

We serve this soup in the summer at our tea salon and our customers love it.The quality of the watermelon does makes a difference.

I have made this soup several times . My husband and I love it.The garlic is essential. Without that it is just a fruit juice.Yes, it is one of our favorite for the summertime. Thanks!

Watermelon and garlic.... yummmmmm!!!! Next time, I'll opt for a tuna and grape jelly sandwich. I'm still crying over my wated ingredients.

I have made this on two occasions and it was a success both times. Tangy and refreshing, very close in flavour to the classic spanish gazpacho, yet a little sweeter. I found it easier to use blanched slivered almonds for a smoother texture, and day or two old bread, bakery bread.

I'm not sure if I would try this one again or not.I thought the garlic was fine with the watermelon, but I had the same trouble as another reviewer with the bread. It didn't puree very well with the soup. If I make it again I will use a softer bread and also more watermelon chunks. It was ok, just didn't knock my socks off.

It tastes just like its ingredients: watermelon, garlic, bread, and almonds. We won't make it again, and probably won't eat it this time.

I made this soup last summer...has been on my mind ever since. Was delicious! Only change I would make would be to cut down garlic to one clove...I thought 3 cloves of garlic was too much for light fruit soup? Was I only one who thought there was too much garlic?

It's been a while since I made this soup, but it is always fresh on my mind as a summertime option. I was a hit at the picnic I threw together, even with friends who approached it skeptically when they heard what was in it. I agree with the reviewer who said the cubes of watermelon were essential for texture. Be warned, however, this can be a messy dish to prepare--leave lots of counter space. I look forward to making this dish again, but due to the mess, not more than once a year.

I followed this recipe closely and found a couple problems, but none that would preevnt me from making it again with the proper modifications. Problem 1: the vinegar called for was too little an amount. The soup needs to have an acid backbone to be refreshing. I added a squeeze of lime to my bowl and it was much better. Balsamic vinegar might work too, as well as maybe doubling the amount of vinegar that the recipe calls for. 2: the watermelon bits that are added as garnish are essential. The contrasting yet complimentary taste and texture of the bits with the soup really makes this dish. I will have more bits and less soup next time. 3: I used a firm textured potato bread but it didn't crumble enough in the blender. The texture ended up grainy in the soup. I'll use a different bread next time. And there will be a next time!

I only read this recipe and haven't tried it. However, after spending time in Spain this summer I must say that this dish should not be called gazpacho, because it does not resemble gazpacho. It could be tasty, but should be called cold watermellon soup or something else. I think the word gazpacho is being used for any cold soup.

What a great recipe, the contrast of flavors and the presentation was just what a BBQ needed on a hot Chicago day. Definitely will make it again, smashing sucess. 95% of my guests asked for the recipe. For a fun serving idea I used hollowed out watermelon as a tureen and clear glass bowls for serving. Instead of olive oil I floated creme frachie. Great sucess.

I made this two weeks ago with just a couple of revisions - my guests were ecstatic and one made it last weekend to serve at her own dinner party. The changes I made to the recipe were: I used 3/4 lb. canteloupe and 1/4 lb. watermelon I forgot the ice cubes It was an absolute success - even my husband who hates melon, cold soup and anything "odd" wants me to make it again!

I admit I did adjust the recipe (I was going to an office picnic). I omitted the garlic and ad- ded a drop or two of sesame oil. It was a hit!!

i agree with the other reviewers--the garlic and watermelon flavors clash. if you want to try it, i suggest leaving out the garlic and adding a little sugar (depending upon the sweetness of your watermelon) for a decidedly sweet soup.

seems like this should just be a sweet dessert soup. The combination is a bit too strange. Maybe omit the garlic and bread crumbs (are there bread crumbs in regular Gaspacho?) and a few different fruits?

Just had this soup yesterday at my friend's house who is a gourmet cook. It is probably my problem but the garlic overcame the whole taste. The presentation was lovely...clear crystal bowls with the olive oil on top. It was a strange combo of flavors. Try it...you may love it!!! I just took a Zantac!!!
