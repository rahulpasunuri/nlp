Also, wanted to add, it took longer to bake the eggs than specified in the recipe, but worth the wait. I loved all of the elements of the dish; it all worked perfectly together. But, I was especially jazzed about the versatility of the black-eyed pea salsa. A lot can be done with that. When I mentioned adding olive oil in my earlier post I meant that I had added it to the salsa, just to make it more, well, salsa like. Also, I found it best to make the salsa ahead so the flavors can marry. Just mix it in a plastic bowl, cover, give it a good shake, and pop it in the fridge. Keeps about a week. Enjoy.

I made this for our family Christmas brunch and it was a very big hit. I added a little olive oil, but, other than that, stuck to the recipe. There was leftover black-eyed pea salsa so we pureed half of it and added a little more lime and chile. It made an excellent dip. Then, I served that over a poached egg with a side salad later that week. Exceptional! we've found a new family favorite.

I made it again. (Lots of collard greens from my CSA) I fried the bacon and then left the grease in the pan and cooked the fresh, chopped collard greens and onion in the grease. It was the most successful with the greens and bacon on the bottom, a scrambled egg poured over, and the beans on top, cooked all together from the beginning.

This was good. i experimented a bunch of different ways and I liked it best when I scrambled the egg with the milk and poured it over. Also, I put the bean salsa on top half way through cooking which I thought was much better than at the end.
