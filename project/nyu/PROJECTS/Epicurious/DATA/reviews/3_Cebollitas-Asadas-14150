I was skeptical about how well this would turn out made under the broiler, but it was great! It really brings out the sweetness of these onions, and gives the greens a slight crispiness that is delicious.

I can't eat onions but this was well received by my guests when I made the steak dish. Too easy to pass up when you grill the meat. Recommended

I make this dish by simply brushing the onions with oil, then sprinkling Tony Chachere's or Zatarain's Creole spice on them instead of salt. Very yummy!

This was an easy way of making another addition to the tacos.
