I ended up with rutabagas in my CSA bag and had no clue. This was super easy and delicious!!!! Thanks!

So easy and such an intersting taste. I used a bit more salt, butter and sugar than called for because I thought it was needed. I had never had rutabaga before so was excited to try it. My guests loved it as well. Next time I may use agave instead and add a bit of chili pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick.

Received quite well by several folks at a veggie food event after I changed it to a dessert type dish by adding ~2 tsp agave syrup + pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger). Also thought it was a but dry, so upped the butter to 5 tbsp.

Agreed. Surprisingly good!

Surprisingly good - inexpensive and easy. We paired with sweet-and-sour pork chops with pickled fennel (Feb/March 2011 issue of Fine Cooking) for a complete and comforting weeknight meal.

I too was skeptical that this simple recipe could be so good. I made it today as a last minute dish and everyone loved it! Will definitely make it again.

This is one of the best things I have EVER eaten. I wish I had found this before Thanksgiving, but at least I can make it for Christmas! I used only one rutabaga and waaaay more carrots than it called for. It's still delicious.

I usually make puree of butternut squash for Thanksgiving and decided to try something different. This dish turned out beautifully, but unless you are serving heaps and heaps of it on the plate, you can easily make 1/2 the recipe as part of a large meal. I cut down a bit on the brown sugar, but added about 1/3 cup light cream and grated nutmeg. This is my first time cooking rutabaga and I look forward to sharing it with my guests!

I couldn't imagine how all these reviewers could have given this recipe 4 forks, but wow. This is completely delicious. Not sure I've ever prepared or even eaten a rutabaga, but they definitely lend a nice earthiness to the carrots in this dish. You should try this.

Only used about 1.5T butter and 1 t agave nectar. This really was an excellent recipe. Hard to believe something so simple was so rich!

Hard to believe something so simple and easy can taste sooooo good! Nice, easy do-ahead side for company. Reheated beautifully.

I used baby carrots and omitted the sugar entirely. The dish was still sweet enough, and even the rutabaga- haters enjoyed it.

This is an old favorite! I add summer savory herbs and it gives it an aromatic touch!

I thought this was quite good. I would probably give it 3.5 stars if that was an option. I thought it was missing just a little something though. I like the suggestions of adding a little cream and/or nutmeg. I think that might bump it up to four stars.

This was AMAZING! We recently discovered how much we love rutabagas. We are cutting down on sugar so all I added was a teaspoon of honey and nutmeg and the result was a rich, creamy puree. Next time I'll add some heavy cream and a little more sugar or honey. We liked this more than other purees we've made, such as cauliflower or sweet potato. Rutabagas have now become a staple in our household.

YUM!!!! I doubled for a big hoilday dinner. I made this 2 days in advance with only half the brown sugar called for. To reheat i sprinkled the top with a bit of brown sugar and baked for 45 minutes and it was delicious!

I forgot - I did reduce the sugar too - to 1 Tbsp. My husband thought it might do well with even less. I might try it next time with only a teaspoon

The reviews for this recipe convinced me to try it. The magnificent results convinced me to register just so I could add to the positive ratings. What a winner! Combines the two veggies into something quite unique that appeals to those who like one more than the other - maybe a LOT. And it does, indeed, reheat like a charm!

This recipe was a huge hit! First attempt at cooking a rutabaga, and I was pleasantly surprised. Very popular at Easter dinner. Wonderful sweet flavor and a light texture, I will definitely be making this again. I did use less sugar than called for, maybe 2 tbsp.

So good even my pickiest child eats it. My m-i-l "tasted" every last bit left in the cuisinart after I transferred it to a bowl. So much better than plain carrots or rutabagas.

This was so easy to make and EVERYONE loved it!!!!!! I had to go back to the market on Christmas Eve to buy carrots & rutabagas to make a second batch!! I will definitely make this maybe once a week??!!! Enjoy!

O mygosh I was so excited to see this recipe in a gourmet cook book. It has been a tradition in our family for years but my kids still won't eat it. It is one of my favorites for the holidays and will continue with the tradition if I have to eat it all myself! Rutabegas rock!

I am a rutabage fan (I even grow them) and this recipe is just wonderful. Close to a four! Easy, can be made ahead and is a hit with non-rutabage fans. I make it as soon as my rutabagas are ready - will make it tonight and serve with chicken sausages.

Excellent? No... but certainly good enough to make again. Like some of the other reviewers, I cut down on the sugar (only about 1 tbsp), added nutmeg and cream. I also used a ricer (instead of a food processor) to "puree" the veggies. This gave it an interesting consistency - but I'd probably use a food processor to make a proper puree if I were to serve this to guests.

I tried this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. One thing I really like about it is that you can make it the day before and rewarm in the oven or microwave on the day of the dinner. It doesn't taste like it has been prepared ahead. I also added nutmeg to it.

I made this for our group at New Year's Eve cooperative dinner. It was a big hit! I added about 2T of milk and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and only 2 T of "brownulated" sugar. This recipe is easy to do and can be made ahead and just reheated in the microwave.

Delicious!!! I have made this again and again. Easy and wonderful. Great for a Sunday dinner!

This is a great recipe. I added a sliced onion to the vegetables while cooking and then mashed the vegetables rather than puree. I too added cream and nutmeg but reduced the brown sugar to 1T. It was too sweet for our taste the first time I made it. Received raves from the family.

Have used this recipe over and over, even my kids eat it! I too add nutmeg and cream, we love it.

This one's a definate for Thanksgiving. Just add some light (or heavy) cream and a couple dashes of nutmeg when pureeing to get a smoother, more refined taste.

This dish look pretty, but didn't taste that great. I used a big rutabaga instead of two small ones and I'm not sure if it had the same flavor as a smaller one would. I don't think I'd make the recipe as it is shown here again.

Recipe sounded wonderful on its own, but I tried the suggestion of Sharon S. to use heavy cream and a bit of nutmeg....well....it was fabulous...thanks for a great recipe (keeper)...

Rating: 4
I have used a family recipe very similar to this for 25 years. The only changes that I make are the addition of 2-3 Tbsps of heavy or whipping cream and about 1/4 tsp or to taste of nutmeg. The whipping cream smooths out the texture.
