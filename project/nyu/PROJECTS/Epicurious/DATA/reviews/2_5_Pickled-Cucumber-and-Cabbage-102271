I thought this recipe was rather ho-hum, even with the addition of grated carrots. Easy to make for brown bag lunch, but I prefer more authentic Asian ingredients.

I've been making this recipe from time to time since it was published in 1999. It is not outstanding but has a satisfying flavor and texture that pleases a lot of people. It is flexible enough to compliment many foods. Plus, it's quick and easy.

My husband and I really liked this. I made it to pair with the pan roasted salmon, and the two made a delicious combination. I think I would like this as a side whenever I'm looking for an Asian vegetable salad. It's easy and quick, too.

This is a Japanese inspired recipe, and it certainly isn't coleslaw. Adding mustard would be an abomination. This really doesn't taste authentic. I think a more classic version, perhaps with the addition of kombu as a flavoring, would be better.

Otherwise known as "coleslaw," but maybe that's too bauerlich for our friends at Gourmet. Needs a tbsp of senf, preferably of the Dijon persuasion; add salted, drained, rinsed, then shredded cukes; lots 'o coarsely-ground tellicherry black pepper. Lasts for weeks. But this recipe is only halfway there.
