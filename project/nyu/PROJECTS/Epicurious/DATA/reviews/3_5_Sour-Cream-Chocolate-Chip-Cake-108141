Followed recipe exactly, except for adding a tbsp of milk at the end to make the batter a little more liquid. Needed some extra baking time, but took out when it passed the clean knife test and it was nice and moist. However, we do not care for the flavor - nuts AND cinnamon AND chocolate are not as good together as they sound. Will not make again.

Needed a recipe ASAP for a housewarming party after I was asked at the last minute to bring dessert. I had almost everything in my pantry except for the chocolate chips and nuts. I had just made some blueberry jam, so I added that to the batter and called it a blueberry sour cream cake. It was devoured! Had to bake for about 30 minutes - wasn't anywhere near done at 20..but kept an eye on it and it came out great. Great base recipe and I will be making the original sometime soon!

I skipped the pecans because I didn't have any in the house, and it was still delicious. And I also substituted buttermilk and extra butter for the sour cream. Cinnamon was the overwhelming taste. It was especially good warm.

This was well liked - especially because it was served warm out of the oven. I didn't have sour cream in the house so I substituted with 7/8 buttermilk and an extra 3 tbsp of butter. I also skipped the pecan part of the topping because I didn't any in the house. Next time I wouldn't use quite so many chocolate chips, but overall it was delicious.

This is essentially MY recipe one that I have made for over 30 years. But, I just use cinnamon sugar on the top.

My family has made this version for years with the only exceptions being that we always add 2 TBL of milk to this recipe and we don't add the nuts to the topping. Perhaps the milk was inadvertently left out....

I have made this 3 times now and cannot get a moist cake from this recipe. The flavor is awesome, but it's very crumbly even after cutting the baking time back, adding an egg and adding extra sour cream. I think I'm giving up on it.

My review: Eh. This got plenty of "Mmmm's" and "Aaaah's" round the table, but it's nothing special. If it were a little lighter, it would be better. Very heavy, dense cake.

A simple and delicious cake, especially using toasted hazelnuts--a perfect combination of flavors!

Sometimes nice, simple cakes are just what I'm in the mood for. My friend's mother used to make the most simple chocolate chip cake in a brownie pan - to serve with tea. This reminds me that...

Just not a great dish. Cakes from a box are much better, and I NEVER say that!

Loved this cake. Had a piece still warm out of the oven. Used about half the amount of chocolate chips and the cake was wonderful. Used Penzey's extra fancy Vietnamese cassia cinnamon and the whole house smells wonderful.

It is possible that somehow I did something wrong - I'm pregnant and the brain isn't working on full speed. But still, I haven't had any other baking problems. This just came out really dry, very surprising given the sour cream. It was a disappointment. Also, too much cinnamon for my taste.

all-purpose flour worked just fine!

I made this according to recipe but it didn't go over very well. Even my 6 year old thought it was just alright.

I had high hopes for this recipe but I never really got a chance to taste it. I followed the recipe exactly but after about 20 minutes of cooking I smelled something burning in my oven. I tested the cake and it wasn't done but the bottom was black. I covered the bunt pan with aluminum foil and continued cooking. I tested the cake with a toothpick which came out clean. When I turned the cake over the middle and top were not done. Next time I'll choose something longer to test doneness with. It probably tastes good but I had no luck baking it. Would appreciate suggestions because others seemed to like it.

Very good cake. I made it for friends and family and everyone loved it. I also tried this recipe with walnuts and it tasted great.

I'm about to give a try on this recipe. Just a question if anyone can help. Did you use the all-purpose flour or cake flour? Thanks in advance.

Serendipitous errors: I forgot the nuts, and as I took the cake out of the pan, a big chunk stayed behind. Too ugly to take to a party, so I made my first trifle! Cut the cake into cubes, and placed one layer of cake in a round souffle dish. Spread a generous layer of cinnamon whipped cream (probably 1.5 cups whipped cream with 2Tbs. powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon)Placed thinly-sliced banana in 1 layer,then repeating, used another layer of cake, another banana layer, then another 1.5 cups whipped cream to top it off, with a few pretty chocolate shavings sprinkled on top. It was devoured at the party, and everyone wanted to know the secret!!! I hope this inspires you to experiment when the original plan goes awry! Bon appetit :)

Very good! I used mini chocolate chips - turned out great - chocolate distributed very evenly.

This recipe was very tasty and also very easy. I think next time I might try it with slightly less chocolate chips, however, if you're a chocoholic, I wouldn't change a thing.

This cake was really quite nice. Next time I will definitely cool cpmpletely before turning out because a bit of it stuck to the pan. It tastes lovely and moist and I imagine it will be even nicer tomorrow.
