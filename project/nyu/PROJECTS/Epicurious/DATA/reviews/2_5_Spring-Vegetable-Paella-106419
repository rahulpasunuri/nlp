This turned out quite nice. I omitted the potatoes and added a couple of zucchini to the roasted vegetables. I also added a can of quartered artichoke hearts at the same time the vegetables go in the rice. I agree with the above commenter, don't add water, add more stock to preserve the flavor. Don't be stingy with your spices or salt, either. And if you're careful with when you add liquid, you can keep the rice from getting mushy. Not a mind-blowing dish, but a tasty way to feed a big group.

I must join the group who was disappointed in this recipe. Loads of gummy rice (it does make bucketsful) and not much flavor. Should have made a real risotto instead.

Being vegetarian I have always wanted to try paella, this was ok but nowhere near exciting enough that I would ever bother making it again. It makes an absolutely enormous amount. I couldn;t fit it all in my pan!

I liked this dish a lot. My version wasn't bland, but I used no water - just stock and wine. The fennel was too crunchy though; next time I'll parboil before grilling. Also, a whole teaspoon of saffron was too rich for my blood - I used a largish pinch (and soaked it in hot water first). I also threw in a couple of anchovies and some tomato paste. Next time I'd skip the potatoes - nice but unnecessary. Personally, I liked the heartiness of the creamy rice / chickpea combination; good for a main-meal dish, maybe not so good if served as a side dish.

I thought this turned out very nicely, despite its detractors. It's a delicately flavored dish but not bland. I am confused by the choice between arborio or medium grain rice; I would think those would yield very different results. I used arborio and the result was somewhat creamy, not mushy, but not as creamy as risotto. Also, this makes a TON of food. I used a 10" dutch oven and it was almost full to the top. 12" skillet, my eye. Good for a crowd.

This was a fair amount of work, with so many vegetables to prep. I enjoyed the finished dish, but not as much as I thought I would, in proportion to the work involved. There could have been more flavor, too (though that might have improved if I had used the full amount of paprika). Good for former paella fans who've become vegetarian. :)

Everytime I make a different paella, my wife keeps saying to make the one with all the roasted vegetables. I now about double the garlic and parsley, and reduce the garbanzos and potatoes. Can't beat the turnips! We also pile around shrimp, squid, mussels, and clams, on occasion. Don't try to make this as a baked paella - takes too long and the texture isn't as good; stick to the stovetop.

I agree with other reviewers that this is a fair amount of work for mediocre results, a poor use of wonderful ingredients. Also, too starchy with potatoes, garbanzo beans, and rice.

Not too bad, but I found that the rice was mushy. The next time I made it, I mixed in cooked rice and it was better. I roasted the veggies on the BBQ including the asparagus and they had a nice smokey flavour. I also used canned tomatoes with the juice for extra flavour.

Wonderful dish. Quite a bit of prep work but the cooking is very easy (compared to other risotto type dishes where you have to keep adding liquid and stirring). A tad bland but that can easily be fixed. I didn't add the potatoes because it's a rice dish with veggies so why add potatoes?? I added the asparagus with the tomaotes since another person noted that addding it near the end didn't give it enough cooking time. It makes a lot so be prepared for leftovers. I might omit the chickpeas since they are drowned out by the rest of the veggies. I don't eat meat so to find a delicious recipe like this is a real treat!

I should have heeded the recent reviews of other. Decent amount of work for a very bland result. I tried to rejuvenate this dish with a bit of extra garlic, parsley but to no avail. A poor use of a bunch of wonderful ingredients.

This seemed like too much work for the end result. The roasted vegetables were great coming out of the oven, but the flavor got lost in the rice. We too cut the saffron. We halved the recipe and still had tons left over.

Hosting a dinner party and the roasted vegetables came out burnt. Salvaged what I could and roasted more carrots, reduced the temp and roasting time and they were almost burn again. A lot of work for little flavor.

Wow!! Absolutely gorgeous dish, easy to make and (I imagine) easy to substitute ingredients (winter vegetable paella anyone?). Saffron misers, take heart - it works well with far less than the full teaspoon specified. Asparagus was a tiny bit crunchy, I might pre-steam next time or add earlier in the rice-cooking process. But truly, a very tasty, savoury, healthy and satisfying dish. Destined to become a staple in our household. Yummy!

Wasn't sure if you needed to cook the rice first, but I did and it made for an overly, risotto-like, dish. Still, it was delicious, and I will definately make this again. . .though I will have left-overs for a month(seriously large serving).

My husband and I loved this easy, light dish. We couldn't find fennell but it didn't distract from the dish, we also added more salt than the recipe calls for. Next time we are adding some fresh seafood along with vegetables. Yummy.
