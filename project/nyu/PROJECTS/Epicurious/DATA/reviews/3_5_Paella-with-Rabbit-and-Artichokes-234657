I LOVE this recipe. The smoky goodness and the richness of the flavors is amazing. I didn't have a paella pan the first time I made it so I used a wok. It worked really well. I use the "baby artichokes" rather than full grown. They don't need quite as much trimming. I have also been known to add seafood to the dish about 10 minutes before the dish is done.

Maybe I was expecting too much..seemed like a pretty standard recipe to me. It was good but not great. I think you could greatly simplify it with canned tomatos and arttichokes (not brined or in oil). Used stovetop...the purpose of a grilll seeemed lost on me (not that I had a choice with city living...)

Requires a bit of prep work but this dish comes out very tasty. We used stovetop and followed the gas grill instructions which worked out just fine. We also reduced the sodium by half and it still came out quite good. When it says add 8 cups of stock, do what the recipe says. It's a lot but it the rice will soak it up. Rabbit was interesting to try. For those who are wondering what it taste like, it's a bit like chicken but chewier. If you are squeamish about eating rabbit or can't get your hands on one you can probably substitute it for chicken.

I had to rewrite the recipe for practical reasons--it's not written in chronologial order and is very long and difficult to follow when you're in the heat of the moment. E.g. not even the ingredients list order is logical. So, great outcome after I invested an extra half hour reorganizing the and printing the info, but I expect better organization from epicurious/Gourmet recipes.

Sounds great, I love rabbit and I love Paella, the technique is right, so I'm sure it will be fantastic, but I think I'll add a little chorizo and use hot smoked paprika (that's what I have on hand, and I like a little extra spice). But I really want to take exception to the all the chicken comments. Chicken can't hold a candle to rabbit, rabbit is a far tastier meat, and the only people who would say it is gross are too wedded to Disney cartoons

This dish turned out amazingly well. I cooked it on an electric stove (unfortunately) and had to cut the rice simmer short due to uneven heating, but it turned out very well! Even had the characteristic scorch to the bottom layer! I got a beautiful rabbit at the farmer's market today. The recipe was not clear on the preparation, so I butchered it as follows: front legs intact, rear calves intact, butterflied thighs and tenderlons cut into just- bigger-than-bite-sized pieces. It is better to not use sinew, etc. for such a succulent dish. I cut down on the solo browning time and added 1 tsp. more salt when combining ingredients, and the meat was perfect. I cooked this for my Spanish advisor and she loved it! Seal of authenticity. Side note: This is not a forum on animal rights, etc. Please do not taint this beautiful dish with baseless, inappropriate opinions.

For goodness sake, use chicken if you have to but the recipe is excellent and the technique is perfect for making great paella without a lot of fuss - just get everything ready first, and it only takes a few minutes. Also, this is a review site - how can you review something you won't even try???

Have an open mind - haven't you heard - it tastes like chicken and at the rate the rabbits have eaten my new flowers and other garden items I relish this dish!

I made it with chicken and it was great.
