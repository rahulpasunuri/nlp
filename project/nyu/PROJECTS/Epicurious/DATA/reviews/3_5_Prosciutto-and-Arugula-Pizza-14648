We LOVED this pizza. The only changes I made was to roll the dough using a rolling pin and as an experiment I put about half of the prosciutto on a cookie sheet and stuck it in the oven for a few minutes while the oven was preheating. We just didn't know if the texture of the "raw" prosciutto would be pleasant to eat on top of the pizza. I put half of the crisped prosciutto on one half of each of the pizza's and the uncrisped on the other half. We decided that we liked it both ways! We will definately make this again.

this is really good. as far as the negative reviews, i think it's fair to assume that anyone who refers to pizza as "ethnic cooking" is more than a little suspect.

... great pizza but the transfer thing was a disaster for me not sure where I went wrong - perhaps my dough was too soft.

I couldn't agree with the positive reviewers more! This is a very authentic and wonderful pizza; I've used this recipe for years! I had this exact pizza in Rome. Only wish I could find a recipe for the zucchini blossom pizza that I was so fond of there.

This is a good combination of flavours. I only gave it 3 forks because the pizza sauce is bland. Spice it up and you have a delicious pizza.

Thsi pizza is very authentic Italian. It is wonderful. Try to find baby arugula called "rocket" which is what they put on pizzas in Italy.

I agree that this deserves four forks and I can't imagine how it could get less than three. You just can't go wrong with the combination of delicious, intense flavors. For the person who said the crust didn't hold up--did you use a pizza stone and heat it to scorching hot? And did you use a light hand with the toppings? If not, then I'm sure you did have some trouble with the crust.

I've made my own version of this recipie many times and it is great. The bitterness and peppery nature of the arugula compliment the other tastes. I drizzle with a little white truffle oil or good olive oil and shave some good parmesan cheese. Its not a big departure from tradional recipies as some recipies. Try it!

I don't know what's wrong with the other two reviewers. It seems they have a pretty limited view of what pizza is all about. I've eaten this exact pizza in Italy and since then make it at home all the time. Get a grip ladies!

This particular recipe is a disgrace to the world of pizza lovers. Do not try this.

The dough didn't hold up well for crispness nor texture. Also the combination of arugula and prosciutto were not as interesting as advertised. Ethnic cooking (pizza?) should have texture difference from regular American fare. It was good but no more than average.
