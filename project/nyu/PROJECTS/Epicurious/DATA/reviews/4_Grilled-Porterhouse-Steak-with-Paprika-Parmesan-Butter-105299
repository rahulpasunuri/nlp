I only used the marinade (on sirloin steaks, marinated for a couple of hours on the counter and then pan-seared, finishing in the oven), but that was very, very good. Caveat: I cut the salt down by nearly half, and it was still too salty for my taste. I'd go down to maybe a scant teaspoon and add more at the table if it's needed.

ACH! TOO SALTY! I would definitely halve (at least) the salt, and then it would probably be really good. I enjoyed the Paprika-Parmesan butter as well, but wasn't sure how well it went with the steak.

I have been making this at least once a month for 5 years now and it is ALWAYS amazing. We also use the marinade on lamb, pork, chicken, prime rib - you name it. I've tried just throwing the marinade together by eyeballing it and it's good, but when I follow the recipe exactly it is PURE PERFECTION. My favorite recipe ever!

I used this for tenderloin kabobs and my guests raved. I even served this to my picky friend (she doesn't eat anything that is not perfectly plain). This is a keeper. Used leftover butter on halibut fillet the following night - WOW- I am going to make up several batches of the butter and keep in the freezer. Don't skip the anchovies they add a faver depth that isn't fishy, but would be missing without it...

This recipe is very similar to Bistecca alla Fiorentina found on the Cucina Toscana website and TV show with the exception of the Thyme and the Bistecca is marinated for 24 to 48 hours. If you have the time to marinade the steak for that amount of time IT IS TOTALLY worth the effort. I have served this recipe using Rib Eye with a horseradish sour cream sauce and it is unforgettable! You'll never want to have steak any other way. Enjoy.

Made this the other day and it was the BEST steak i have ever made!! left the paprika-parmesan butter off cause we are plain but my husband loved it!!!

Rating: 4
This was so good! The steak by itself was good, as was the butter by itself. We just had the butter leftovers with some chicken and it was to die for. During the dinner, my fiance didn't speak much and just said thank you. I didn't use fresh herbs by the way, and also used just a thin filet of meat.

Great steak. I made it for my parents, husband, and kids (8 and 12). We could not stop eating it. I used dried herbs instead of fresh, and I let the steak marinade for 5 hours. Didn't make the paprika-parmesan butter this time... didn't need it, but definately will try it next time.

I made this for my wife for our 5th anniversary dinner. I made it as described except I used some three inch thick tenderloin steaks marinated overnight! It was amazing. I grilled it a moment too long for my taste but that didn't affect the flavor and it still melted in our mouths.

This was pleasant. I added way more rosemary and thyme than the recipe called for. Based on previous reviews, I also cut back on the salt. I lightly sprinkled kosher salt on each side of the steaks, rather than dumping it directly into the marinade.

Really great! We have a theory that it killed my father because of the large amounts of that excellent butter!

We made this the other night during our spring Nor'easter. It was well worth braving the heavy winds and rain to cook the steak on the grill!!! We used rib eye steaks instead of porterhouse. Both the marinade and the paprika-parmesan butter were fantastic and so easy. This will definitely be a regular on our summer grilling menu.

Used a tri-tip cut -- deeelicious. Having grabbed fresh rosemary from the garden, I was not shy in using more than the teaspoon the recipe called for, and the ensuing flavor was extraordinary. Doing Atkins has never been easier :-)

This tastes a lot like a well seasoned rib roast. If you look at it as a quick&easy rib roast you can stick on the grill, it's great. It does mask some of the beef flavor, so if you have a flavorful piece of meat and you want to taste it, I don't think I'd use this recipe... I will be using this for the next BBQ :-)

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. My butcher cuts porterhouse steaks 1" thick - so I went with their standard size. It worked out fine. I had several guests try sirloin steak (for the children)that were marinated (but before the parprika-parmesan butter), and they loved them. The marinade would work on a variety of beef cuts - even without the special butter.

The best steak I've ever eaten. Yum. And my family agreed.

I agree with everyone, it was fabulous. Easy marinade. The butcher was very against cutting 2 3/4 to 3 in. steaks so we did it with 2 in. steaks and it worked out perfectly(thanks to my husband bbq prowess)and I have to say I agree with the butcher, thicker would have been crazy.

My review is pretty repetative of those below, the steak and marinade with or without the butter is very good. The level of spices in the butter completelly changes the dish when used. I molded my butter into a log, put it in cling wrap and placed it into the fridge. Then you can slice the butter into pats and place them on top of each steak. I served each steak rather than preslicing because I was worried the steak would get cold to quickly if sliced. I made this with the Shitake and Potato Gratin also found on this website, nicely go together.

I left out the anchovies and the thyme because I didn't have any, but it was excellent regardless. My husband said it was the best steak he ever tasted.

Spectacular. Paprika butter (with anchovy omitted) makes this dish. I will use it regularly on just about anything! I imagine that an anchovy might put it over the top in the salt dept. - and I love salt.

This steak is fantastic! Any good steak will definitely do well with this marinade and butter. I make this for all of my large dinner parties, and have found that it serves well sliced over a green salad, or at room temperature as a "finger-food" appetizer! I will continue to make this - very easy.

Absolutely amazing! One of the best steaks we've ever had - and we're big steak fans! Our cut was a little smaller - about 2 in. Marinated about 5 hours. Ours took about 7 min. per side for medium on a gas grill. We were afraid it'd be too salty, but it really wasn't, even though we don't like our food salty. Next time maybe 2 tsp. salt will be enough. The butter really goes well with the steak. Altogether a very memorable meal! This will go in the "special dinner" file!

I have been looking for a good and (fairly) simple marinade for a steak, and this is it. I use N.Y. Strips and marinaded for 2hrs. It was the best I've had. The Paprika Butter was the icing on the steak...can't wait to try it again. The Butter on the corn sounds wonderful

Rating: 3
I made this recipe for a birthday dinner and it was a big hit. Everyone used the butter on their grilled corn on the cob instead of the steak and raved about it. I would say that to speed up the cooking you could use any good steak. Found that the porterhouse cooked like a roast and took too long to cook. Have made this recipe many times.

This was simple and excellent!!! I also agree it was good without the butter

Rating: 4
This has terrific flavor! I used 4 tenderloin steaks (about 5 to 6 oz. each) instead of the porterhouse. Used dry thyme (1 t.) instead of fresh, and cut back on the salt to 2 t. which seemed just right. I didn't even make the paprika-parmesan butter just to try to keep the fat content down. A very easy recipe that I plan on making alot this summer.

I made this for a date on the first occassion she came to my place for dinner. If presented properly it looks and tastes much more complex than it really is. I served it with a twice baked potato,salad of fresh greensand crusty bread. She was very impressed.

I made this for my boyfriend, and he said, "I hope no other guys find out you can make a steak this good."

I was hesitant about the butter sauce at first, but it turned out excellent. I omitted the anchovies b/c I didn't have any. Since it was the middle of winter, I also pan seared the steaks for 7 min/side rather than grill them. Everything turned out great. The pan seared garlic gave the steak and the butter a very intense flavor!

Way Tooo Good! One Porterhouse Steak is Enough for 2 People. The marinade and Paprika-Parmesan Butter are to Die for. Leftover Steak works well with Buttered Noodles With Chives

Rating: 3
When the butcher showed me the 3" thick porterhouse this recipe calls for, I nearly passed out. I enjoy occasional red meat, but!?! Anyhow, I followed the recipe and marinated the beef slab overnight. Then gilled it next evening on the BBQ. Result? WOW! One of the best steak recipes ever. The marinade really makes it. You can forget the Parmesan Butter - delicious but way, way over the top.

This is as good a steak recipe as I have ever made. You must have a thick porterhouse.

Very tasty, and so great to find something greatly different to do with a steak. The parmesan butter (more paprika than parmesan) was timidly applied at first, but generoulsy applied after the first taste or two. My spouse says, "a keeper".

We loved this! A good porterhouse doesn't really need much seasoning, but this was very flavorful and different! I used two porterhouse steaks, instead, which worked out fine. I also did not slice the steaks, so I just melted a pat of the butter over each. Yum! I left the anchovy out of the butter (not a fan) and thought it had a great flavor without. I will make this again and again.

We used a 1 1/2 inch rib eye steak, which was more than enough for two adults. Marinated the steak overnight. Delicious!

Used 2 individual porterhouse steaks, weighing maybe a total of 2 pounds. Did steaks over hot gas grill - caught fire after 3 minutes - took steak off and it was almost perfect ! (That is if you like it on the rare side. Next time may only put it on for 2 and a half minutes!) Butter was good but actually not even needed!

Used flank steak with the receipe, marinated 4 hours. Very Tastey. Watch your time on the grill though. Receipe calls for to much time on the fire, then again we like it moo-cow rare!

Bar-B-Q porch is being repaired so I did this recipe on the stove using a calpalon ribbed pan. I also used a large rib eye cut of beef. The time for cooking in the magazine is WAY TOO MUCH! 7 min per side gave me med. meat. Watch your time closely. Will make this on the grill and on the stove a LOT--it is so easy and tasty!!!!!!! From a Texas Cook we do LIKE OUR BEEF!!

I agree with Cliff. This is a great recipe. I made it for friends over July 4th, and everyone loved it. Plus, we used the leftovers for Fajitas, which were also good. Two suggestions: The butcher suggested using New York Steak instead of Porterhouse, since all you're really using is the New York Steak part of the Porterhouse anyway, so why pay for the bone? Also is easier to slice. Second, I found that the grilling directions gave much too much time. Could've had to do with the absence of the bone(?) but the steaks were definitely medium rare at 5 to 7 minutes, not 18. So be careful!

I liked the marinade, but the anchovy taste in the butter was overwhelming, careful if you don't love anchovies! I saved the butter by adding a little goat cheese (my secret recipe "fixer") - I add goat cheese to almost anything and it instantly gets yums at the table.

We liked this steak a lot. I only marinaded it for a few hours, and bet it would have been even tastier if I could have let it sit overnight.

I am so surprised this recipe received such great reviews. My husband and I were so disappointed that we wasted a perfectly wonderful porterhouse on this recipe. It was so salty we could barely gulp it down. The flavors were overwhelmed by the salt. The recipe does say to shake off the excess, but it is still WAY too salty. If I ever considered making this again, I would only use 1 teaspoon of salt, no a whole tablespoon. The parmesan butter was tasty though.

This dish is a knockout! Make extra marinade and parmesan butter as both keep well and work well with other cuts of beef.
