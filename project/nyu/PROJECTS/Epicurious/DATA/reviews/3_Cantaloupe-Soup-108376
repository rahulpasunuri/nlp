I was searching for a cold cantaloupe soup recipe and found this. Unfortunately, I didn't have the cider. Instead, I used one container of Stonyfield's nonfat lemon yogurt, about 2.5 cups of fruit, and a quarter teaspoon curry powder. Pureed it in the blender and voila! The curry adds the kick, the fruit the sweet - and top it off with roasted almonds.

Excellent EASY recipe for a hot summer day.

I hated this. The combination of flavours did not go well together at all. I like cantaloupe. I like curry, just not together.

I made this recipe with very large cantaloupes and not so much of the cider. I also doubled the amount of curry powder and we thought it was just delicious. I made it earlier in the day so it could sit to become more flavorful, and it did! Delicious!

This is a delicious, elegant, and refreshing first course for a summertime dinner party--or a small portion can be served as a palate cleanser just before dessert. I adapted it, though: used 2 large ripe cantaloupes; 1 1/2 C sparkling cider (skim off foam when you mix w/ cantaloupe); 6 T lemon juice; and 1 1/2 t ground cumin instead of curry powder. Chill very very well before serving (you can put briefly in the freezer to accelerate the process). Garnish with chopped mint. Serves 8 first course or 16 tiny ones. Our sophisticated gourmet group of 25 plus years raved.
