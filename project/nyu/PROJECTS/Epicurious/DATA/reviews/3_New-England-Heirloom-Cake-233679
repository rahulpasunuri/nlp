Not too sweet, not too heavy. An excellent chocolate cake that got raves when I served it.

Extremely disappointing. I can't believe this was chosen as representative of the top recipes for 50 years. The cake itself is so-so, okay texture but boring flavor. The frosting is terrible-definitely not worth the effort (very time consuming). Put it this way-this cake has gone uneaten and I have three children and a husband who love desserts!

The chocolate cake with the walnuts up the side is in the Sept. 1989 issue...called the "fudge-slathered fudge cake" in the article on Heritage Cakes. Happy baking!

Does anyone still have the original magazine this appeared in? Wasn't there an option to make it in a 9" square pan and then press walnuts up the sides? Or was that a chocolate cake appearing in the Sept 1989 issue? My wife is driving me nuts because she lost this recipe when we moved. Help!
