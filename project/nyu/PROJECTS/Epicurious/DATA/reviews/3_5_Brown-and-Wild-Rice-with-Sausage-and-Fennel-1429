I used only brown rice and I doubled the sausage as others recommended. I didn't have the fennel seeds and I think that the addition of them would make it even more flavorful. I made this for Christmas and received several requests for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I sort of parboiled ALL the rice together in a mixture of broth and water (I used Lundberg's wild and brown rice). I omitted the fennel seeds, simply because I loathed the idea of another trip to the grocery store on the day before Thanksgiving. I used mild Italian chicken sausage and put the whole thing in a casserole dish for easier transport. I then baked it, adding extra broth, at 350 until the rice was done (about 45 minutes). Delicious! I'm planning to make it for an Advent wreath making pot luck supper at church this week.

I skipped the fennel seeds and used 12 ounces of organic farmers sausage. The flavors were nicely balanced - salty from the sausage, a slight sweetness from vegetables. The recipe turned out great and I'll make this again, perhaps with turkey sausage.

This dish is very simple and so delicious. A great balance of flavors and textures. I made this dish for a pot luck, I was a tremendous hit!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. Like some of the others, I use turkey sausage and decrease the fennel. It is fantastic the second day -- unfortunately, we never seem to have any leftovers to heat up the second day!

I've never understood why anyone would eat brown rice when white rice is so much more agreeable and this dish did nothing to persuade me otherwise. I used Octoberfest sausage because that's what I had on hand and I don't think it made enough of a different to warrant a re-trial with the sweet italian stipulated. The aroma as it cooked was very unappetizing. It was better the second day than the first. I have much better recipes along this line. They call for chorizo sausage and adding green peas when the rice is almost cooked. My recommendation: give this one a pass.

This was good on a cold winter evening. Doubled the sausage as many have. Actually made a double recipe because it was only to serve 2 as a main course. We fed 6 and have enough left over to feed several other households for a fortnight. It wont go to waste. Even my picky children loved this.

Ok, to be fair, at first I thought it was awful, what didn't taste like fennel tasted like nothing. After it sat for about 1/2 hour however, the flavors seemed to blend a bit more and it was actually not bad. Would add more sausage and less fennel next time.

I took the suggestions made by those who have already posted here. I used 16 ounces of sausage. It was just right.

A fantastic recipe! I made it ahead of time and let the flavors blend overnight. Terrific results and rave reviews from the dinner party. The recipe recommends serving hot, but it was great cold as well.

This dish was Delicious! I would suggest that if you like sausage to increase to 16oz.. 8oz. just isnt enough. I also used turkey sausage and thought it was great. Fennel is very strong so I just used 1/2 of a bulb, but if you like fennel ALOT go for it.

I think this makes a fabulous side dish, but as a main course it was missing something. I used exactly 8 oz sausage like the recipe said. Using 12 oz would probably be enough to take the recipe from a good main course to a really good one. It is a recipe that is better the next day. And it makes at least 3 main course servings, not 2.

Marvelous receipe. Easy to do. Good taste. Only one problem with this receipe: after I did it for the first time, my guests always want to know when will be the next time I'll do it.:-) Try it. You will apreciate this special taste.

Excellent. This was the first time I have used fresh fennel, and it's wonderful. Next time I will substitute low fat turkey sausage.
