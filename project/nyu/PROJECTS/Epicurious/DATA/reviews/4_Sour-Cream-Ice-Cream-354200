I made this to serve with a blackberry peach cobbler and thought it was delicious. However, it was 50/50 with my guests. Everyone liked it, but only half of my guests want me to make it again. Some thought it tasted too much like frozen yogurt, some thought it reminded them of cheesecake. I also had the leftovers with bittersweet chocolate grated over the top and it was very good. I will make again, if just for myself.

I was curious about this recipe and doubtful that it would be as good as the reviews, but wow this is the easiest and best homemade ice cream. It does taste more like frozen yogurt than ice cream, but that's not a distraction to how good it is. I can't believe how simple it is. Only change I made was to add a basket of fresh chopped stawberries. There is only one problem with this ice cream -- it's so hard to stop eating! This will definitely be the recipe I reach for.

This is about as easy as it gets for making ice cream that always turns out great. I have made it a couple of times. The first time I added a Mexican hot chocolate mix that you just normally add water or warm milk to.I just added the Mexican hot chocolate mix into the sour cream when I was blending it before putting in the ice cream freezer. I just added the desired amount to taste and it was great. The second time I made it I had about a cup and a half of ground almonds left over from another dish and added the ground almonds to the sour cream mixture as it was in the blender. Again the results were great. Overall this is a great basic recipe that can be altered with any flavor you desire to add. It is nice because it requires no eggs, no heating and making a custard, no waiting for the mixture to cool off before putting in the ice cream freezer. If you can remember to keep the bowl in the freezer, you can have soft, smooth very tasty homemade ice cream in about thirty minutes. As a note, it does seem to get pretty hard if put in the freezer before serving and needs to sit on counter about thirty minutes to soften up before eating.

#1 - This is the easiest ice cream you will ever make. All the ingredients are whizzed up in a blender. No cooking a custard! #2 - This is one of the best ice creams I have ever made. The sour cream tang makes it perfect to accompany pumpkin pie. Incredible with a drizzle of maple syrup (I recommend Blis with Tahitian vanilla bean) or aged/wine balsamic vinegar. #3 - The recipe is so simple, make sure you do not forget a crucial step....chill the mixture WELL before you transfer it to the ice cream machine! Pouring straight from the blender does not work. I know (2nd time I made it).

This is my all-time favorite ice cream recipe. I'd never eat sour cream plain, but I could eat bowl after bowl of this. I'm sure it's great with pies, fruit, cookies, etc. but it never lasts long enough around here for me to do anything other than eat it straight. It's magical and perfectly delicious, as written.

Tastes like cheesecake. Very easy to make. We make a lot of ice cream and this is my favorite. I always decide to make things last mintue, so had to substitute a bit of ricotta for sour cream and grapefruit for lemon but still YUMMY (I do recommend sticking with original recipe)

This ice cream is great! I'm not a fan of overly sugary desserts, and this has a perfect balance between sweet and tangy. I can't wait to try it over apple pie!

I made this recipe completely as is, and it was really wonderful! It was so easy to make and so tasty that I can't wait to make it again!!!

This ice cream is fantastic! So easy to make, and not too sweet. Great with blueberry or strawberry sauce: heated some frozen berries with a touch of blue agave syrup and had it on top of the ice cream. Also made this with cocoa powder and another 1/4 c sugar for a chocolate-cheesecake like ice cream. Wonderful!

Wow!Just after Christmas, so I substituted the heavy cream with some left over eggnog, upped the lemon juice to one lemon's worth (almost 1/2 cup), and added the zest of the lemon. This is great ice cream!

Even after our ice cream maker failed on us in mid preparation, this ice cream was the best we have ever made. Served it with a strawberry blackberry sauce.

A very simple recipe with guaranteed results. I've made this several times. It's sweet and tangy -- similar to a lassi. I've made it with chocolate syrup added -- drizzle the syrup to taste right into your ice cream machine as it's blending.

this is one of the best home-made ice creams I've made. Not too much fat... hate it when ice cream coats your teeth, and not too sweet. the sugar dissolves perfectly when made as directed. Serving it tonight over brownies.

Excellent recipe, it's just like the sour cream ice cream sold at a chocolatier in town. I added some lemon zest to emphasize the tang of the sour cream. It's not very sweet - would be popular with those who love the taste of frozen yoghurt.

OMG fantastic. This is by far the best ice cream. A little goes a long way. Try it with most any fruit pie. Next time I will add blueberry sauce in the final minute. Think blueberry cheese cake... YUM!

OMG fantastic. This is by far my favorite. Very rich and a little goes a long way. Made it exactly as stated in the recipe. Would go well with most fruit desserts. I am going to add a blueberry sauce to it next time in the final minute.. think blueberry cheese cake. YUM

A very nice, rich ice cream with a bit of a cheesecake flavor that's not overpowering. The lemon flavor is very nice here, and it really is as good on its own or with some berries as it is on pies or cobblers. Fearing a slightly gritty texture, I warmed the cream and half-and-half with the sugar, using half of a vanilla bean and a sprig of lemon verbena (and later omitting the vanilla extract). This did give is a very smooth texture. I also put a few very fine grinds of black pepper into this--which is hardly noticeable but adds just a slight bite to this very rich ice cream. Will continue to experiment!

Good basic recipe. I will increase the sugar to 1 cup the next time I make this recipe. I added fresh sweet organic pineapple at the end of the mix time. Very rich and smooth. A good way to break in my new Kitchen Aid Ice Cream attachment. Yummy!
