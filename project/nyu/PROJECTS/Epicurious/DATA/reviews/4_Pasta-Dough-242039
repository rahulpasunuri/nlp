This was awesome and easy! My first attempt ever at fresh pasta and I was pleasantly surprised. I don't have a pasta maker, so I rolled it out by hand. I filled it with a mixture of butternut squash, goat cheese, proscuitto and carmelized onions. HEAVEN :) I will be using this recipe many times in the future!

I wanted to make fettucine, which was not recommended in the recipe. So I altered it a bit and used 3/4 cup cake flour and 1/2 cup AP flour. I used my pasta machine to #5 and it was perfect!! This is the first time my fettucine was not rubbery at all. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I didn't have cake flour so I used all-purpose and it turned out very well. Made ravioli with it and will do it again.

I ended up having to roll the dough out by hand - the pasta machine shredded the dough - way too delicate. I'm going to try more AP flour next time. That said - it was delicious and I will make it again.

I used 00 flour and the dough turned out very well. Made ravioli with it ans they were delicious. The dough makes a tender, delicate pasta.
