This lacked flavor. My spices and ingredients were fresh and I went according to recipe (except for subbing greek yogurt for the plain with cornstarch) but it was just not very good. All my guests agreed with the sentiment about it being bland. Theoretically, the flavors in this recipe should work really well together, so I have no idea why it wasn't good. Ideas, anyone? I'd like to try for round 2 and figure out what happened.

Try adding lemon juice to the dish itself and on the side.

Used this recipe to stuff 8-ball zucs from my garden. Not as good as I'd hoped. Somehow tasted thin, like it was missing something. Probably won't make again.

We really like this one...it's a nice change of pace. We grew round zucchini this year, just for this recipe so we could put more stuffing in it.

This was really yummy. I served it with assorted mezze and it was the first to disappear. The only change I made was to stir a little cayenne into the yogurt sauce to spice it up and garnished it with mint. Will definitely make again.
