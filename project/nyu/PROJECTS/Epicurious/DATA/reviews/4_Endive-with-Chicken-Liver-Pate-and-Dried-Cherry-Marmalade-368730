Thanks to the other reviewers for using this as a message board...dolts. Oops, did I say that out loud? Anyway, this is a GREAT recipe and my eight guests quickly emptied the appetizer trays on this one. This is a case where a perfect flavor balance has been reached. The sweet and tart flavors of the marmalade marry perfectly with the earthiness of the liver and slight bitterness of the endive. And I liked the different textures...it really added something. I'd recommend this recipe as-is, perhaps with some baguette toasts on the side. It's a relatively inexpensive, very healthy, very delicious way to start a meal.

This pate sounds about as bland as you can get.

There is a difference between chopped liver and Pate. Pate is actually easier to make.

Isn't there a difference in liver pate and chopped liver?
