Made this for a potluck at work. I generally like blue cheese, but it overpowered the other flavors. Others seemed to like it. In my opinion, not worth the extra expense and effort.

Served this at a bbq and everyone raved about this recipe. I doubled the recipe and used half red skin, half regular creamer potatoes. Also, garnished with extra bacon (fan favorite). I used food processor to make dressing and added a strip of bacon, some blue cheese, and a squeeze of lemon in it for extra flavor. Will surely make this again.

This was delicious! i only made half a recipe (since there were only 2 of us) and now I wish I didn't - there wasn't a bit leftover! The only change that I made was using dried oregano in place of fresh. We WILL have this again!

BEST potato salad I've ever made! Of course, I took a few liberties with the recipe. To the vinaigrette, I added a tablespoon of grainy mustard, a half teaspoon of granulated garlic, and a pinch of cayenne. Also, I shorted the olive oil by a few tablespoons and swapped out some of the bacon drippings. And, I didn't have fresh oregano, so I used fresh thyme leaves instead. YUM! http://lindseysluscious.blogspot.com

What a treat! A wonderful host made this for a group of us, while we chatted in the kitchen! Couldn't get enough, so glad I now have the recipe to treat my family with.

One of the best potato salads I have ever had! A bit tie consuming, but definitely worth and even better the 2nd day!

Excellent and tasty potato salad. I had a hard time peeling the grilled red peppers, so some of the peel stayed on. It didn't seem to make a difference. My husband ate about 3 servings and kept picking at it after dinner. It's very colorful and could go with many different grilled dishes.

YUM! I made it without bacon, substituted cilantro for oregano and roasted poblano chiles for red bell peppers- I also added some red onion and added dijon to the dressing. MMMMM

Wonderful! At Trader Joe's they sell frozen grilled corn kernels. An excellent substitute for those who don't have a barbecue.

I'd give it 3-1/2 forks. I've made this 4 times now and love it every time. So do guests. Different and colorful and the sherry vinegar is a must. It has that unique flavor. This recipe does need LOTS of added salt. The corn does not really need to be gilled...you can do it on the stove. But sweet corn is important. If home-grown is not available, use Green Giant "Extra Sweet" frozen niblets. It makes all the difference. I love the fresh oregano and it is available in most large supermarkets in the fresh herb section. (But I'll have to give the cilantro a try as other readers have, even though it is an entirely different taste.)

This potato salad was wonderful - I served it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it - It's a very colorful salad & had lots of flavor (even though I accidentally forgot to add the oregano!)I did add 2 more peppers & 3 more ears of corn & about a 1/2-3/4 c. of bluecheese.

An inferior potatoe salad. I made it 'cause I had all the ingredients at home. I won't do this again.

YUM!!! Used cilantro instead of oregano also. Loved this- will go on my list of impress-your-friends potluck dishes.

This was a big hit! Something diffrent from the ordinary. I think next time I will puree the blue cheese in the vinagerette to get the flavor throughout the salad. I also used cilantro in place of the oregano (by mistake).

I made this over the weekend, it was great, I used cilanto in place of the oreagno. would make this again. I also did not have sherry vineger so I used white wine vinegar with some sherry.

I thought that this dish was a great alternative to regular potatoe salad - Husband and I both enjoyed it - will be making again

I'm not sure about that other reviewer; I have to say that I made it for a company lunch and EVERYONE raved! I don't care much for Oregano, so I have to say I omitted it. But don't be afraid: It was great!

To the cook from Alamo, CA...the bleu cheese is an important element, and so is the fresh oregano. Salt is also definitely needed (to taste). Changing it as you did, would certainly affect the outcome. Sorry you didn't like it. I made it again last night, exactly as directed (but cutting the recipe in half) and it was just fabulous. I'd give it 3-1/2 forks. The sherry vinegar is very important also. It adds a flavor that regular wine vinegar does not. My potato-salad-picky husband loved it and warms his up in the microwave for next-day leftovers. I served this at room temperature. A great alternative to the usual mayo-based salad.

I made this leaving out the blue cheese and using thyme instead of oregano. It was a bad use of good ingredients. Neither my husband nor I liked it at all, we threw the leftovers out. It was very bland and nothing special.
