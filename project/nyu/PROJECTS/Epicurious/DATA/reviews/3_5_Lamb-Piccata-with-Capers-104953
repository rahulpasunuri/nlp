The cutting of the meat off the bone takes time, but after that the recipe is ready in a few minutes. I doubled the sauce as hubby likes lots of sauce. I served with potatoes roasted with olive oil and bay leaves (JU '03)--it paired well and a fresh tomato salad with feta cheese and kalmata olive.

This is so easy and the ingredients are always around. Great idea to do a piccata with lamb. I've now tried this with both the o-bone and the blade and the blade is much easier. If you can get it flat enough, it certainly isn't essential to remove the bone.

i seared the lamb so the center was pink and fanned it onto a plate, then poured the sauce on top. great with a red wine.

This recipe makes for a fast and elegant main dish, and is a big favorite with my husband. The only thing I do different is this: Instead of using canned chicken broth, I use the bones from the shoulder chops to make a quick lamb stock. Because there's more fat in the stock than the canned broth, I cut the butter to half.

A wonderfully simple recipe. It's become a regular when wanting to impress friends, yet not spend the day in the kitchen. I have substituted with veal and it's equally delicious!

I loved this recipe and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. It is sort of time consuming preparing the lamb, but once that is done, this is a really easy recipe to make. Definitely do not overcook the lamb. It is best medium rare with lots of sauce. Yum!

I am a lamb fan and I thought this lamb needed to be grilled first then added to the sauce. It was alittle greasy......maybe from cooking in it's own grease and not drained.

What a great recipe, no special ingredients, easy and quick to prepare, yet really looks impressive on the plate. Perfect inspiration for my next dinner party. This goes in my "keeper" file.

This is a good and easy dish! I used a bit of flour to thicken the sauce - the butter called for wasn't enough and using more would have made it too rich. My Hubby ate it all (and the leftovers!) yet claims he doesn't like lamb!
