This was a huge hit both times I served it. It is an excellent dish to make ahead, but I preferred the texture of the fish when I removed it from the oil after cooking and wrapped in plastic and chilled rather than chilling in the oil, which seemed to break down the texture of the fish somewhat. The tomatoes and fennel served alongside were excellent. I cut the halibut filet into small sections just before serving and it made an excellent first course for 8.

Have made this twice now and it has gotten rave reviews. So fresh tasting and perfect served room temperature for a summer meal.

This was a waste of a quart of EV olive oil and halibut..both very espensive. In order to maintain whole filet had to use fish poacher..in which case why oil? Made a light fish taste overly rich and there are better ways to cook fennel and tomato. Interesting but costly food experiment, would definitely not make again.

Very tasty. Somehow my fish was a bit over cooked, I think I left the fish in the oil too long. It was good nonetheless. Without the fish, this dish would also make a good fennel sidedish.

Had to use sea bass and leeks instead. Turned out beautifully! Poaching with oil prepared the fish moist and perfectly done. Not the least bit heavy or greasy. Excellent!
