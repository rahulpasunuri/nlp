this is an awesome recipe, suitable for a dinner party or a weekday dinner. I used Sriracha---it worked well. I served with cilantro rice and steamed baby bok choy. Dee-lish. I will make this again and again.

Very dissapointing, especially after reading the reviews. Way too much Hoisin sauce and what the heck is chili sauce? Heinz? Sriracha? Tabasco? There are so many variations that completely change the dish. BA please be more specific.

Wonderful flavors. I recommend grilling rather than roasting in the oven. Also great with boneless chicken.

This is the lamb dish I have used to convert non-lamb eaters to lamb lovers. It's a bit labor intensive but tastes amazing and is great for impressing dinner guests.

We found this recipe in the Bon Appetit years ago and made it and loved it. We were in Maui and went to David Paul's restaurant in Lahaina and ordered it and other entres and it was absolutley fabulous. We just got back again from Maui, but it is not on the menu, although the experience was just as enjoyable as the first!

Tender meat with fantastic flavor, and I only had time to marinate the lamb for an hour. Delicious! I will definitely try this again, and perhaps use the marinade with chicken.

This was delicious, simple to prepare, and earned raves despite the fact that I only had time to marinate the lamb for one hour. I loved the sauce and the marinade. The meat was amazingly tender, probably due to the cut, and the timing was perfect--the meat came out a beautiful medium-rare.

I have to say right off that i didn't make the lamb part. I was looking for a good sauce to go with my shrimp stir-fry and let me tell you this sauce is sooo good! Very easy and delicious! I would make it again and I will try to make the lamb next.

This dish was relatively simple to prepare and the flavors were perfect with the lamb. I did have to adjust the cooking time, 30 minutes and the lamb was still a little to rare for my family. Served it with a spaghetti squash.

My husband and I love this recipe, although we use more hunan sauce in the marinade than is called for (because the first time we made it, we accidentally put all 10 tablespoons in it (instead of 2) and love it that way. We have made it several times since the first time I reviewed this, and we now use lamb chops instead of rack, because it's even better when the peanut crust is all over the chops, as opposed to just the edges.

This did nothing for me. I have prepared great asian dishes and great lamb dishes but this particular combination was not fine enough for spending the dough on the rack of lamb. The flavors of the hoisin/peanut overpowered rather than complemented.
