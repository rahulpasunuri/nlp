I used a 5.77 pound roast and followed the recipe fairly precisely. My oven may run a bit hot so my internal temp after roasting was about 150 so a little too done in the middle when serving a range of tastes. I still got rave reviews and it was just so incredibly easy. I will cook this way every time as no need to sear on stove top, add water, etc. Great with scallop potatoes.

Salt & pepper to taste. Is this even a recipe?

With this particualr cut of meat it should be hard to screw up....

Easy basic recipe. If you are not a pepper fan (I am not), use garlic. I cut 3-4 cloves into "spears" and insert into spear deep cuts made randomly. Then dust with garlic powder. It is my family's favorite roast.

kelams1947 missed the part about "to taste" which means "to taste" or don't over do it. This is a great cut for a roast beef and a simple to follow guide provided here. Use the meat thermometer.

I made this for a meal and it was so spicy(pepper) hot that it was hard to eat. The next day the leftovers were hotter. Not very good and I had to trim off the outter edges of the meat to finally make it edible for the third and final day. I was almost ready to throw it out.

My family really enjoyed this roast. It was tender and full of flavor.
