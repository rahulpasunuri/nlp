Beyond fabulous! I served this on Easter using strawberries, blueberries and raspberries as the fruit. I made my meringues on parchment paper like other reviewers suggested. Simple. All the men had seconds. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe. While reading some of the reviews, I decided to undercook it slightly, just ten minutes. It was so good! I substituted the sour cream for marscapone and put a little sugar in. I also omitted the blackberries.

Exceptional! Raving reviews during the party, all the way. Got orders for the next party. Will make it many times again, for sure. It was light, refreshing, full of flavor and not too sweet, the way meringue tend to be too often. Brown sugar was a great addition. I think this is my new favorite dessert. Highly, highly recommend it.

Amazing. This is now my go to pavlova recipe as I have a number of gluten free friends and family members. The brown sugar adds a bit more depth of flavor than your typical pavlova. I like to undercook mine just a bit to give it a touch of chewiness. I doubled the pavlova recipe and made a number of small individual pavlovas but the filling was more than enough to fill each shell. It was delicious.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was a huge hit at our dinner party. I did not have three cake pans so I did what other reviewers did and used one baking sheet and made three pavlovas. It was just fine. I think I would use a little less sugar with the fruit because the pavlovas were sweet enough. But, what a show stopper! One of the best desserts I've ever made.

I made this recipe yesterday,it was easy, looked elegant and was eaten quickly, of course everyone wanted the recipe. I did sprinkle lemon zest over the top layer. Will be one of my favorite desserts.

The dinner group I served this to raved over it--three of the six said it may be the best dessert they had ever eaten. The only change I made was to assemble the meringue and filling and serve the berries on the side so left overs didn't get too soggy.

Wow! This is all the reviews promised. I want to add that it is a pretty easy dessert to bring as a guest. We took it along for a 4th weekend in this way: I made the meringues in disposable 8" pans and froze them, packing the remaining ingredients. Just before dinner I macerated the berries and whipped the cream and assembled just before serving to rave reviews. Fun to make, impressive to serve, and delicious!

My husband thinks this may be the best dessert I've ever made. It's definitely very impressive and was a huge hit at a pool party. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used vanilla sugar on the berries and put just a leetle sugar in the cream. It was heavenly. The brown sugar gives such a great flavor in the meringue. I'm going to make this again as soon as possible.

Huge success with my guests. It was my first meringue ever and the detailed instructions got me to succeed.

Exceptional recipe. The brown sugar, sour cream and berries are reminiscent of a dessert I ate growing up. I followed the recipe but made the following small adjustments per other reviewers. I increased the meringue by 50 %. I also baked it on cookie sheets covered with parchment. Don't bother piping out the meringue, just slather it on the parchment keeping the shape reasonably round. This recipe is perfect as is, but lends itself to lots of experimentation with filling from chocolate, to passion fruit to lemon. Have fun!

I made this (almost) exactly as written and it was perfect. The only thing I did differently was not to use the cake pans; I did free-form on parchment using measured 2-cup portions that I then spread to an even thickness (following the cake pan size/shape). Was delicious and really not that complicated. DEFINITELY make.

Made for our Memorial Day picnic. Used only whipped cream between layers and only strawberries because that was all I had. Makes quite a visual impression, and it got lots of accolades. One person even asked for the recipe. Easy.

Check the merigue it might not need the full hour. Mine didn't (I slightly overcooked but it was no big deal lol). THe merigue is plenty sweet so don't worry about the sweetness of the cream so much. I tried doubling the cream but with too much cream it's too messy to cut and present. So just put some extra cream on the side. It's definitely a keeper and it wasn't very hard!

The wife and kids all gave this recipe a hearty four forks up. I greased the pans with coconut oil. Oh. My. Salivary. Glands. We couldn't taste the coconut in the meringue, but the bouquet is a deliciously satisfying aroma of toasted coconut. I cut the granulated sugar by 1/3. It was still plenty sweet. I will halve the white sugar next time.

Served this for New Year's Eve -- a huge hit!

Delicious! I halved the meringue recipe, and formed it into a heart for valentine's day, awwww ;) I didn't especially like the sour cream blended into the whipped cream, so I'd just make it plain next time.

This has become my most requested dessert. Everyone loves it. The meringue layers are quite sweet, so I use unsweetened whipped cream with a dash of rose water. Sometimes, I cook down half the strawberries and drizzle the whole thing in addition to layering it with fresh berries. Yum!

I'm so glad I found an old Gourmet with this recipe. It's amazing. We have a number of Gluten Free family members and this is perfect for celebrations. I can't say enough. The presentation is gasp-inducing and the taste even better. Want to wow a crowd? make this.

A few reviews mention dusting the pans with flour. Why would you do that? Sugar is what is suggeted and the ones done on the parchment paper are much easier. Had pavlova all over Ireland-spectacular!!

This is a real hit!!! Gorgeous to look at, really delicious, and not difficult. Our whole extended family loves it, kids included, and it has become a standard since some of us are wheat-intolerant. It's excellent!

I made this for a birthday dinner attended by 10 people. The guest of honor was overwhelmed. Everyone scrambled for seconds, and in no time rest of the pavlova had disappeared. I figured I needed to make a slightly larger version to serve 10, so I used three 9-inch cake pans and increased the ingredients by about one-third--it worked out fine.

I have Made this in the winter when you can't get fresh fruit that is very good so I used frozen and I thought it compared well with the original recipe. But take note that the frozen berries will be juicier so the assembly would probably need to be closer to serving time. I have also sent leftovers home with my friends and they said nothing went to waste the Pavlova just absorbed the liquid and they loved it just the same.

I have made this for several of my friends and they are in love with it. Plus, my daughter is a very picky eater and she loves the brown sugar Pavlova.

Rating: 4
Super tasty, and easily altered. I didn't have three tins of the same circumference, so just baked it in one rectangular pyrex, and then cut the meringue in half for a two-layer treat. The cream and sour cream didn't really fluff when dumped in the bowl at the same time - try whipping the cream first, and then lightly folding in the sour cream.

There are very few recipes on this site rated 4 forks with 100 percent of people saying they would make this again. This recipe deserves it. It is surprisingly easy to make and delicious - I followed the recipe exactly as written. Used a serrated bread knife to cut and it worked well. I did the assembly just as our guests were finishing up the main course, but I think it would hold up if it were assembled just as everyone was sitting down to eat, but not too much before that.

Brilliant recipe - I love the complexity that the brown sugar adds. My husband is allergic to kiwis raw and thought how sad a pavlova is without them. So I made a kiwi curd and was looking for a different pavlova recipe to try with them. I made 4 6" rounds (same volume as 3 @ 8"). I froze 2 for future, we ate 1 last night and the other tonight. Great great recipe - thanks for the ingenuity!

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and it disappeared! Make sure the berries are fresh and that you allow the meringue to 'dry out' in the oven before removing from baking pans - as it is extremely delicate. Would most definitely make again.

This has become one of my "go to" desserts. I have made it 4 times this summer, using different fruits, tonight I used peaches. Only once have I used whipped cream - I find it just too rich. Tonight with the peaches, I put a layer of high quality lemon yogurt as the filling and people rave about it. That way, it is a super light dessert - even if it seems decadent.

I made this beautiful pavlova yesterday to bring to a BBQ dinner with friends who had 4-7 year old kids. I was worried that it might be too much of an 'adult' dessert because it's not your standard cake or pie, but they loved the whipped cream and berries and 'marshmallow' layers. I baked the meringues in disposable 8" tins, and had no trouble removing them after baking and cooling. I kept the cream to the ratio specified in the recipe, and had enough. I also used a serrated knife for cutting, which was perfect, though the cake does still fall apart a bit after you've cut a few pieces. But no matter-- it tastes delicious and looks so amazing before cutting that no one was concerned about having a messy piece on their plate. (I could imagine doing this as individual desserts sometime if I did want to try to have each serving look as beautiful as the full cake). Will definitely make this one again!

Rating: 4
Excellent dessert. I have made it three times. I also recommend doubling the cream. And I also recommend just spreading the meringue batter on parchment paper rather than using layer pans. Much less risk of crumbling! I have also made the recipe with individual separate meringues for a dinner party for people with different fruit allergies. Worked great! Made 19 ro 20 meringues.

I'm planning on making this recipe this weekend (based in large part on the favourable reviews). I have considerable experience with meringue (and the cutting thereof) and would recommend that everyone try using a thin, grantham (sp?) edge cheese knife. The slightly serrated edge gets through the crispy exterior and the grooves/or holes in the blade reduce the drag on the gooey part :)

First attempt at pavlova, and everyone went nuts over it. I'm not a dessert person, but the balance of the sweet meringue, decadent cream, and fresh berries created the perfect mouthful. No leftovers!

I made this Pavlova as recommended. The presentation is excellent however cutting this desert is big problem and destroys the Pavlova. I used the sharpest thin bladed knife I could find to no avail. Does anybody has any suggestion for cutting? Otherwise I give no more than 2 forks.

This wasn't at all hard to do, and it was SO GOOD! I only made 2 layers, since I only had 2 8" pans, and it was plenty. I doubled the cream but not the sour cream. I was concerned about how this would keep in the fridge. On day 2, it wasn't pretty but it was still delicious. I wouldn't have served the leftovers to company, but it didn't stop me from licking the plate clean!

Wow! This was DELICIOUS! I've never made a pavlova before (or even a meringue, for that matter), and I was skeptical that it would turn out well... but it was great and I'm glad I took the risk! I was expecting this dessert to maybe be too sweet, but it's perfect with the cream and fruit. I used 3 9' cake pans because I didn't have 8' ones, so my meringues were not so thick... but they didn't break! Phew. Presentation was beautiful, but cutting was a bit messy.

Amazing (and relatively easy) dessert. Everyone raved, and I'm making it again this weekend for a birthday party. I used blueberries and strawberries (what I had on hand) and only ended up with two layers. I had enough whipped cream, but then again I only had two layers. This dessert manages to be refreshing and decadent all at once, a rare thing.

FABULOUS! This dessert, was amazing! i would make it over and over again, everyone could not stop saying "oh my goodness, this is ammmazing" as well as other things. I would agree with another review, it is easier to use sheet pans, i had two cake pans and one sheet pan, and the sheet pan one turned out better, and a lot easier to deal with after baking. i can't wait to make this again! I am a huge foodie, and for that reason i say i have no favorite food, but this is pretty darn close!

I made this recipe for the Fourth of July and it was a hit! The recipe was perfect, but the flour is not needed on the pan since there is parchment over it. I also made it with blueberries and strawberries instead of blackberries and strawberries because i wanted it to be red, white, and blue. I've got my family hooked on pavlova now! I would for sure make this again.

I have made this twice already with great success for company. The second time I made it, I switched out the filling with the filling from the Grand Marnier Crepe Cake on this site -- we liked that even better! Either way, you cannot lose. So easy and so yummy! Also, there is no need to use cake pans and flour them -- the meringue is stiff enough to just spread it into 8" rounds on parchment paper on 3 cookie sheets; they will hold their form perfectly. Whichever floats your boat.

I made this recipe for a family gathering and it was a huge success. It was beautiful and delicious and it stole the show.

beautiful dessert, and delicious! I used peaches,strawberries and blueberries. It was very impressive. They were four of us and we ate the whole thing. One my friends took the serving plate and finished it off! I will definitely make this again. I made the merengue ahead, and froze it. very easy.

I made this dessert for a large party and it was absolutely the biggest hit of the event. I doubled the heavy and sour cream, however and was glad that I did. The dessert is beautiful and the flavor is marvelous. Make it and make it often.
