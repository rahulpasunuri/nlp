this was pretty good. Not fantastic but a good week night dinner. The only change that I made was that instead of rice I used chou mien noodles. I will make this again.

I used Costco frozen halibut instead of shrimp and it turned out great. I quick thawed about a pound of halibut filets in a bowl of cool water, cut them into "shrimp-sized" chunks, then rinsed them with fresh water and patted them dry with a clean kitchen towel. Then followed the recipe, except using snow peas for snap peas, because I had snow peas on hand. It turned out great! The frozen fish held up remarkably well (didn't fall apart) and the dish tasted great. Served it with jasmine rice. There were no leftovers!

This was a solid, easy recipe for a Tuesday night. I used Glen Ellen Chardonnay (Concannon) and it paired nicely. I used a bag of asparagus, squash carrot, mushroom etc veggies from Safeway in lieu of the veggies here.I added thawed shrimp that I'd cut into large pieces. With Egg flour soup as a side, it fed three adults.

Thought this was okay-nothing wrong with it, but nothing great either.
