I didn't have a grill, so cooked the meat 5 minutes each side in a skillet in 1T of olive oil and then put it in the oven for 10 minutes for medium rare results. The topping was divine!

This recipe truly compliments beef. I topped it with goat cheese and it was fabulous! Guests loved it.

I have had this recipe for awhile and didn't expect it to be particularly good. I pulled it out when the fresh oregano started overtaking my herb patch, and I had a couple of strips to grill. WOW!!! Raves from husband and kid. We liked it so well I made it again a week later for a dinner party. Prepared it as written, but rubbed the steaks first with a little garlic/oregano paste. Not too much, just a little. A keeper!

This relish is amazing. Made it for Mother's Day with beef tenderloin and everyone loved it.

Made this for last night's Christmas Eve dinner but used dry aged rib eye steaks instead. The steaks were fabulous with the relish. Wonderful, salty, rich flavor. So easy, too! My husband didn't even reach for the Heinz 57 sauce!!

This was a really quick and easy recipe. Followed the directions to a T and it was great. I used a grill pan since we don't have a grill and it was just fine.

Quick, easy, delicious. The flavors of the olives and the grilled beef work well together. Also very tasty with green brine-cured olives.

I love kalmatta olives and have fresh oregano from from my herb garden, made for a new combination on beef. Definitely will make it again and it was so easy, I even found pitted kalmatta olives at a market.

Great flavor combination and simple to do. Try it.

although I love kalamata olives, this is too overpowering to use as a relish. You can't taste the meat. Would not use again.

Outstanding! The relish is fantastic. Even used some of it on top of a leftover pork chop. Make sure you get the right olives and you will be delighted....

I would never have imagined how well the flavors of the relish complement the taste of grilled steak. This is exceptionally good. It benefits from a generous amount of ground pepper and a crumbling of a little goat cheese and plays beautifully against a rich merlot.

I've tried several Epicurious grilled steak recipes. Although I've liked them all, this is now my favorite. The olive mixture perfectly complements the steak and the preparation is so simple. Note: I found that a 1/3 cup of chopped olives is the equivalent of about 12 whole olives.
