Very nice dish that everyone liked - including my teenagers. I didn't use the arugula and substituted the garbanzo beans for lentils because I had them. I also cut back on the corn a little so it wouldn't be too sweet.

First of all, this recipe makes enough for at least 10. The carrot juice makes the sauce much too sweet and the flour makes this a carrot gravy. We really did not like it. A lot of work for the compost pile.

I found the sauce too sweet, added spoonful+ cider vinegar which helped. Did not use the flour and added at least 2 cups of water which also helped. Used fennel, eggplant, red peppers, spinach, basil - no corn, would have sweetened it more.

This is a great recipe. I made the vegetables two days ahead. The day of, I put them in a hot iron skillet over medium heat with 1 T vegetable oil and then added the chickpeas, rather than baking everything. I loosely covered the skillet with tin foil and occasionally stirred. I made the curry the day of, just before i reheated the veggies. I highly recommend straining as directed. I saved the solids for sautéing with tofu the next day. I left out the arugula on purpose as it didn't seem to match the curry. The proportions between sauce and veggies is perfect. Just add a twist of the salt grinder over each bowl before serving. It is not pretty because it is a ragout, so I will only serve it for my husband and me. I will make this in the winter as well, substituting parsnips, etc. Very yummy and satisfying without being heavy. Oh, I used lemongrass in concentrated form because I couldn't find fresh. I used 3/4 T but could have used a full T.

The curry sauce was fantastic. I added the spices individually as I didn't have curry powder (google "madras curry powder recipe" to know which spices to use), I added a little garlic, and I used one can of coconut milk instead of the carrot juice. I also did not bother to strain the sauce. It was amazing and I will totally make it again. (I screwed up the vegetable mix and they were pretty terrible -- some of the farmers market veggies I got were NOT good! -- so I'm not going to rate the recipe as a whole. I'm pretty sure this was my fault and not the recipe's fault, though.)

I thought this was delicious. I did reduce the vegetables slightly and was using a good quality curry powder, which I'm sure helped. No need to get so many pots and pans dirty though... I roasted all the vegetables on one pan, just staggering when I put them in and I grilled the corn as well. Well worth the effort to me!

I should say that I did change some things because I don't like corn, and my husband hates arugula. In addition, the flour is unnecessary. I get the organic carrot juice and cooking it down worked to thicken it up enough for us. I use fresh, raw spinach instead of the arugula. All that being said, this is a great, go-to recipe for us and we use the curry sauce frequently. Fabulous!

i'm upgrading my initial review. this gets sooo much better the next day. much more flavorful. the additional spices (cayenne and cumin) definitely helped, but i liked this recipe much better than i thought and will surely make it again.

as others have said, i found this to be underwhelming. the best part for me was the roasted eggplant and zucchini. absolutely delicious, and i kept snacking on them while making the sauce. doubled the sauce and that was a good idea, except that twice as much bland sauce isn't a big hit. after i played with it and added some cayenne and cumin, it was much better. not sure whether i'll make this again or not; if i do, it will definitely be with revisions. more spices, maybe some coconut milk. but golly, those roasted veg were good!!!

WAY too many veggies. This is enough for 10 servings. Was ok but for the amount of effort was definitely underwhelming.

Made with eggplant, cauliflower, pumkin, fennel and delicata squash - all roasted. Like others have mentioned, the carrot juice needs to be increased to get the yields stated in the recipe. I omitted all the oil (weight watchers) and it still came out amazing. Just awesome to be able to eat an Indian meal without blowing the diet!

We loved this- perfect way to enjoy vegetables from the garden. I did not strain the curry sauce, just mixed it in at the end. Next time I may add some cauliflower into the roasting pan, but overall we were delighted with this. Very satisfying, especially considering it's vegan!

This was very flavorful. I pealed the ginger, added some minced garlic and instead of using flour to thicken the curry sauce, I put the sauce in the food processor and let the veggies and apple thicken it. Also I used only half the amount of roasted vegetables.

I used 1# of eggplant, 3/4# green beans and 3 ears of corns, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The proportion of veggies to sauce was perfect. Assembled the final dish was delicious, actually better then I expected. Served with steamed basmati rice.

It was good but i was definately underwhelmed. But then again I'm the type of cook who if I dirty up 2 pans, a sauce pot, a strainer, large bowl, vegetable peeler, apple corer, spoons, spatula, and knife, and spend 2 hours working on it, I expect something pretty spectacular.

This was pretty good, but made a huge quantity as other reviewers have remarked. I made it as written and was a little underwhelmed by the curry sauce after mixed with the vegetables given the work it took to make it. However, it is most likely heavily dependent on the curry power you choose to use. Mine was the stuff in the cabinet. Next time, I will make some curry powder from scratch for this.

The weirdest thing happened when I was going to make this recipe: I decided to roast the vegetables tonight (adding some onions, garlic, and roasting the corn along with the rest rather than boil it) and left them out to cool afterwards to put together with the sauce for lunch tomorrow. I went to a parents' meeting for about two hours and when I returned I was welcomed by some guilty looking but definitely satisfied family members: They had found the baking sheet and had gobbled it all up. So I never got to the curry part. The vegies were delicious, however, they assured me! Apparently I can't rate this recipe, but I totally recommend roasting some vegetables at this season! :-)

I agree with the comments that there appear to be some errors in this recipe. For one, I had to at least double the amount of carrot juice, and I could not add all of the two eggplants nor all the squash. It still made a huge huge quantity..which given the amount of labour involved in preparing and cooking the vegetables, I am very happy with. In the end, it was delicious, healthy and hearty. I would make it again, but likely would reduce the quantities by half.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was wonderful! Both the vegetarians and the non-vegetarians in my family raved about it. I served grilled shrimp for the non-vegetarians, but this is meal in itself. Delicious!

This was absolutely great - time consuming but definitely worth it! It only took about half the time stated to cook the eggplant and squash "until light golden and tender". Cooked the beans and corn as stated. It really does make an enormous amount but I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

I thought this was a wonderful, flavorful dish, not to mention healthy with all the veggies involved! It was time consuming but worth it. The Curry sauce directions were confusing as it states to simmer and reduce sauce to a generous 2 1/2 C. when all you are starting with is 2 C. of fresh carrot juice. So I know I didn't have 2 1/2 C. at the end, but it was still enough to coat all the veggies.

Rating: 3
also, it makes *way* more than 4 servings! more like 7-8 main course servings -- notice that approximately 5 1/2 lbs of vegetables & beans goes into the recipe!

This was really delicious! the flavor was bold and complex, and overall, it was a hit. However, I thought there was not enough sauce for the amount of vegetables called for, so I would recommend doubling the sauce (or at least adding water or buttermilk to stretch the sauce). Also, I thought the preparation was a little round-a-bout. Instead of reheating the vegetables and garbanzos in the oven, I simply added them to the hot sauce and simmered for 10 minutes or so. Also, I didn't precook the corn, but rather added it raw along with the other vegetables. Lastly, I used baby spinach instead of arugula, and it was just fine. Overall, it was delicious and I would definitely make it again

It looks good, but I REALLY do not like arugula. If you've made it, do you think spinach would be a good substitute, or should I just skip the "green"? Lemon grass: I can get it at my regular grocery store, or any asian market. I live in a fairly small city.

3.5 forks, actually. Made as written and was very tasty and a great veggie dish. Will make again.

This recipe is a cornucopia of fresh summer produce, another perfect choice for those of us harvesting veggies from our gardens or venturing out to farmers markets. It comes from Hatfields in Los Angeles, one of The 10 Best New Restaurants in America according to Bon Appétit. The curried carrot sauce is unusually flavorful and delicious, although it is a bit time consuming to prepare. Actually, the whole dish is pretty labor intensive, but that wouldnt stop me from making it again. I would say this is one of the best vegetarian dishes Ive ever made. It also got my wheels spinning about carrot sauces now. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/summer-vegetable-ragout-with-exotic-curry-sauce/

I think recipe calls for vegetables to be overcooked. I would cut the roasting time for the eggplant and squash in half and skip boiling the corn, especially since you are supposed to put them back in the oven for 15 minutes at the end. I added a squeeze of lemon before serving. Good flavor.
