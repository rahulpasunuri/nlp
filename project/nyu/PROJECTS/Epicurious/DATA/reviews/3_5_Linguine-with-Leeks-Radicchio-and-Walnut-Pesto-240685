Made this last night and it was a dream. Easy to prepare. Doubled the recipe. Fantastic combo of flavors, and a good way to use radicchio where it doesn't overwhelm.

Our CSA has been sending leeks and radicchio lately, so this recipe was a welcome find. I had already made a large batch of Leek Confit, so I used some of that for the leek part of the recipe, which cut the prep time down to maybe 20 minutes. The flavors and textures blended beautifully, and the dish was visually beautiful, too, with the greens and purple. This is definitely on our must-have list for leek/radicchio season.

With the addition of garlic, sopressata and a little lemon zest, we thought this was fantastic. Unfortunately, I probably won't be making this again, as the leeks (even though I cooked them adequately), apparently didn't agree w/ my husband's digestion. A pity, b/c it's fast, easy and quite tasty!

We loved it. So did our guests. I served it with large shrimp cooked with just a squeeze of lime. Yum. I omitted the cheese for the dairy free husb. and forgot to offer grated parm for my guests - and no one missed it. Made it the first time with a fresh lemon pepper linguine, second time with fresh spinach linguini from Ohio City Pasta, both delicious and beautiful on the plate. Also makes great leftovers, if there's any left!

Loved it. Would definitely make it again.

Didn't make the whole dish but used the pesto recipe since I had a lot of walnuts to use up. Half-basil, half-parsley worked well. Also I agree with the vegan below that the cheese can be omitted ... but "nutritional yeast flakes"?? I'm tempted to click the "flag if inappropriate" link for that one :)

A fantastic vegetarian pasta! I made the recipe exactly as written, except used whole grain linguine. This will definitely be a recipe to make again when leeks and radicchio are in season. Both my husband and I loved it!

I loved this! The ingredients really speak for themselves here, with the leeks providing great overall flavor and the nuts and radicchio giving a nice crunch. I added more olive oil and lemon juice to the pesto, but otherwise followed the recipe. It's great to discover a recipe like this that is unusually flavored and easy enough to make again and again.

This was a delicious Valentine's Day dinner! Made it vegan by omitting the parmesan and adding 1.5 Tblsp nutritional yeast flakes. Also increased the walnuts to about 1/3c and added a garlic clove to the pesto. Really terrific with well-balanced, subtle flavors.

Um, has anybody looked at the nutritional info? 882 cal/serving? Can that be right? Maybe for the whole recipe...but if that's correct per serving, nothing healthy about this!

I like leeks, but I don't love them. This is a terrific recipe if you LOVE leeks.

This meal was exceptional! Pair it with a warm red wine, and you have a fabulous vegetarian meal! My husband and I will definitely make this again!

I really thought this was lovely. The pesto was fresh, flavorful and nice and lemony. The radicchio was an interesting and really delicious addition. I threw some cayenne into the pesto to add a bit of spice, but otherwise was pretty true to the recipe. We loved this and I'll definitely make it again.

While not a 4 forker it was a rather nice change up from the standard basil and pine nut pesto that I am all too over. Not as oily which is desirable. I used the reg./spinach duo linguine and a nice Argentinian Parmesan which was also a little different. I didn't have enough radicchio as it called for but didn't seem to notice. Would gladly make again as it is easy and quick with a light taste.

As suggested, I added some pancetta which was a great. Skipped the garlic but added some red pepper flakes which provided a nice zip. Added extra EVOO to the pesto which made it easier to distribute over the pasta and leeks. I also made with multi grain spaghetti....it was still very tasty.

AAmazing. Made it as written except, as others, didn't have walnuts so subbed pecans. Definately adds a 'wow' factor to pasta night!

Love this recipe. Completely disagree with the other reviews that it is bland. The bitterness of the radicchio is great with the earthy flavors from the sauteed leeks and the pesto. Enjoyed this with a nice German pilsner.

I used spinach instead of ridichio. I also thought it needed more taste, so I added crushed garlic to the leeks and added some leftover basil pesto I had. It looked pretty and tasted great. Add shaved parm at the end??

Surprisingly bland.

It's bland. Maybe a clove of garlic added to the pesto would help the flavor along?

Fantastic! So easy and so delicious and great with healthy pasta. I added a little bit of pancetta too.

I thought this was a tremendous basic recipe. I made substitutions here and there and adjusted amounts to our taste, but it's a keeper in this household. Don't be afraid to alter a recipe if you think it's lacking when you're assembling the parts. I made the pesto ahead of time and did add more cheese and O.O. 'cause it needed it. Out of walnuts so I used pecans and I added a bit of basil and a leaf or two of sage. The leeks and radicchio were wonderful. Served it with grilled chicken sausages.

I found this quite bland - perhaps the extra cheese, etc would jazz it up, bit I'm not going to make the effort.

Does not deserve the one fork I entered as it is not even OK. I will not make it again.

Instead of extra salt, I added nearly 4x the amount of grating cheese. Additional lemon juice, pepper, olive oil made this recipe (really very good) sing.

I guess this is ok if you are dieting, but I found that it is much too bland. Needs more olive oil, maybe some garlic and pancetta, etc. Won't be making this again.

This was great for a weeknight dinner. Needs generous seasoning (salt).
