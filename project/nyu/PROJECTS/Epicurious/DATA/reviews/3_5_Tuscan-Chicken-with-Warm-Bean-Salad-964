I did not make the beans, just the chicken (bone-in breasts only); having just pruned my huge rosemary bushes, I had tons of excess rosemary on hand. I followed the recipe (for the chicken only) but threw a few extra sprigs of rosemary into the dish. What was really nice about this: the chicken was lemony but not sour, the tiny bit of sugar really helped. I roasted the chicken at 400 degrees, and turned it up to 450 when it was taking longer than expected (and used a thermometer to make sure it was done). Served it with roasted red potatoes (with more rosemary, of course) and sauteed onions/zucchini, Barefoot Contessa recipe. Quite a yummy dinner, and made good use of all my rosemary! I love chicken with beans, and will try the beans next time.

Good flavors. Needs double the dressing. Also added sauteed onion, red pepper flakes, oregano to beans.

combined chicken (8 chicken thighs) with all marinade/sauce ingredients at once in a large ziplock bag and marinated for about 1 hr. added a bit of diced roasted red pepper and green onion to the beans, along with the garlic, and only used 2 cans instead of 3. added a tbsp of fresh chopped parsley. this dish is very easy and tasty.

I have made the chicken atleast 3 times and it has turned out good each time. I double the marinade, and usually skip the bean salad because my husband and teens wont eat em (thus the 3 forks). I sub in some roasted potatoes or creamy polenta which works great. I agree with previous reviews that this is a simple and easy week night dinner, tonight I'm using all chicken leg quarters because they were on sale but have made it with boneless breasts too. One last comment, I have made this with very little marinade time ie zero... and it was fine although I prefer it with a few minutes in the fridge.

Really, really good and easy. I can't wait to make this again!

A simple weeknight meal but I agree this could be guest- worthy. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and adjusted the cooking time. They came out moist and with a lovely lemon tang. For the cannellini I cooked up a couple strips of bacon and sauteed some onion and then added the beans plus a chopped tomato, mushed it up a bit and added a bit of chicken broth for a creamier consistency. Served the beans over a plate of baby greens, topped with chicken breast and some roasted asparagus. It was all gone :)

I doubled the marinade like other said and think the next time I make it I will not double the lemon juice but will double the rosemary and olive oil. I may even add in more cloves and salt when I rub down the ckn... its a keeper we loved it, just wanted to add my comments for the next time I make it so I can remember. This is a good one! Its also inexpensive!

This is a great weekday meal. Easy to prepare with just a few ingredients. The fresh, bright taste of the garlic, rosemary, lemon combination is wonderful. My chicken was definitely not crispy, but that was ok. The dish doesn't have much eye appeal, though. Next time, I'll add some tomato to the bean salad, as suggested by one reviewer. I don't usually like leftover chicken, but this dish tasted great the next day--probably because of the strong marinade.

Just made this dish and it was extremely tasty. I wanted a saucier bean salad, so after sauteeing the garlic with a dash of red pepper flakes in the olive oil, I added the beans to the skillet and mashed a few of them up. I then added some of the juices from the chicken pan, as another reviewer suggested, after straining the fat off, and had delicious beans in a substantial sauce. It was very nice.

Great recipe, I added more of the marinade and left the skin on the chicken for more flavour. Very filling.

This was delicious. We are not great bean eaters but we loved the beans too. I bought a whole cut up chicken and boned and skinned the breast halves, but next time I will leave the skin on. I liked that the most time consuming prep was done hours before dinner. This one is a keeper.

This was superb. A great weekday meal, but would be great for company. Used boneless chicken parts (thighs and breasts). Cut the amount of meat in half, but used the same amount of sauce. If I make it again for the amount of chicken called for, I will double the sauce. Paired it with sauteed swiss chard. Yum! Perfect with your favorite glass of cabernet. Plan on having company over just to serve this dish!

I used left over rosted chicken. I had one can of canellini beans on hand, and used a can of pinto beans. The contrast in colors was nice. This was very easy and flavorful.

The chicken turned out great, I used 6 breasts only and doubled the marinade. I thought the beans were a little bland, but adding half a stick of butter and more garlic helped quite a bit...

Iused breast meat only. I also used dried beans which I cooked with bay leaves. I baked the chicken, basting it occasionally and did not finish it under the broiler. The meat was wonderfully moist. I also used more garlic than suggested.

Easy and very flavorful. My husband wants to try grilling the marinated chicken next time.

We liked this, but didn't love it. It was easy to prepare, but was a bit of a disappointment after reading the rave reviews. I will probably try another chicken recipe before making this again.

Good stuff. Used dried beans rather than ready-made. Had some fresh sage and added that to beans as well as the rosemary. The chicken did turn out nicely crisp, as noted by other reviewers. Hearty and filling.

I made this wonderful dish for my sweetie and he was very impressed. I'm usually a mac and cheese gal so it's easy to get this recipe right.

Great, easy, comes out crunchy and delicious if you follow the recipe. I sauteed some leeks in the pan before I threw in the beans and they were very flavorful.

This dish is wonderful! I cooked some dried beans and used those for the salad - added some chopped parsley to the beans. Very flavorful and easy!

Chicken was superb and very flavorful. I added an herbed chicken sausage,(my friend loves sausage)tomatoes, and mushrooms to the bean salad and served also with a side of braised spinach. It was delicious.

This was delicious! I brushed the marinade on the chicken, thus ensuring the garlic & rosemary weren't lost in the pan. This made for a wonderful smelling, tasting & crispy chicken. I removed the chicken pieces from the baking dish & broiled them, then added the cooking liquid to the beans to make them even more flavorful & add some moisture. My husband (who doesn't care for white kidney beans) raved about it!

The chicken had lots of flavor! I loved it. The beans were good, too, and that's saying something, because I'm normally not a bean eater

I didn't make the salad but the chicken was fantastic!! Very garlicky and very moist. I just had drumsticks so I took the skin off and added some rosemary to the marinade. Served it with a mushroom lasagna-YUM!

I used dried white beans for this recipe instead of canned. I make a homemade chicken broth enhanced with citrus peel. This really gives the beans an interesting more complex taste. I also used just chicken thighs instead of chicken pieces. This dish is great served with a crusty bread & a crisp wine.

Simple, Elegant, Strong but comforting flavors. In other words, fabulous! I doubled the recipe for a dinner party (served it with greens sauteed in garlic/olive oil and a tomato/onion/bread salad) and received raves. There was some left over bean salad which I pureed and served as a dip with crudite & crostini for company the next day. Also excellent.

I love this recepie. The chicken is always tasty and juicy. However, I don't bother making the bean. I prefer roasted garlic mashed potatoes.
