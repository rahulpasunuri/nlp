Whew - I love balsamic, but this cleared my sinus when I bent over the skillet to do a taste test. VERY strong - next time I'll use 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 red wine vinegar. The crust on the chicken is to die for and will use that for many recipes.

The polenta crust on the chicken was really all wrong. It was supercrisp - to the point of being TOO crisp, that is hard to chew. The pan sauce was good but nothing special. Won't be making this again.

An interesting way to make the standard chicken cutlets. After reading the reviews, I added a hefty bit of salt, pepper and granulated garlic to the crust for more flavor. I really enjoyed the sauce, but will likely reduce it a bit more next time to get more of the sweet and less of the vinegar.

Sliced the chicken breasts instead of pounding them (much easier). Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. My entire family enjoyed this -- even my picky eater, who had the leftovers for lunch the next day, and my husband, who normally isn't crazy about anything with balsamic vinegar.

The polenta crust was bland and dry, but the chicken was moist and good underneath it. I would just use flour for the breading in the future.

Tangy yum in my mouth. Must love balsamic vinagar. Used masa harina and spinach cuz that is what I had. Easy weeknight dinner with some pasta.

I made this on a night when we had some company over. I liked it, my mother liked it, and both of our guests liked it. It wasn't spectacular, but it was tasty. I did substitute the polenta for cornmeal, and left off the escarole. And I doubled the sauce. I love vinegar-based sauces.

I thought this recipe was a great week night dinner. I added minced shallots to the pan (I just felt like it should be there...don't know why) other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I made this recipe with chicken and tofu, and both were pretty good.

I tried this recipe even though there are very mixed reviews because my husband and I love Balsamic Vinegar in anything. The chicken was supper crunchy on the outside but super moist on the inside, I really like that in any chicken dish. The balsamic vinaigrette was amazing. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE BALSAMIC VINEGAR THEN DON'T MAKE THIS DISH. For me the vinaigrette drizzled on top of the escarole which was all on top of the chicken made the perfect crunching, sweet, and sour combination. I don't think the dish will show its true colors unless you do use escarole when making it. Overall I was happy with the outcome of the dish.

I really liked this recipe and it is a good recipe for a buffet/casual dinner party. One can use other greens to good effect and on one occasion I used cornmeal instead of polenta and the results were at least as good. Everyone who ate it loved the sauce, so maybe we are just vinegar freaks. This will become a "go to" recipe in my recipe box, even though we very seldom fry.

Delicious - the polenta crust on the chicken provides great flavor and texture, and the sauce is an excellent accompaniment. A good (not excellent, but good) quality balsamic is a must for this dish - cheap balsamic will get you lip-puckering results. We used mashed potatoes as an accompaniment, which balanced well with the sauce and chicken.

Made this recipe a few times and think it's a great easy meal. The sauce is a bit dark but the flavors are good. If you feel you have too much sauce I'd recommend reducing it to the desired thickness. I'd be interested in trying it with white balsamic as recommended, but I think it's good either way

I haven't rated this because I didn't make the whole recipe but I did use the polenta crust to crust my chicken burger. It was great! I made a simple chicken patty, mince chicken, grated carrot, diced onion, seasoning, one egg and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I coated it in the polenta flour combo and cooked as instructed. Put them into my burger buns with salad. Just though you might enjoy a variation to this recipe! My family and I did!

i used chicken scallopine, so didn't need to flatten. i used white balsamic, which i do frequently in recipes where the dark color would be off-putting. i also made the sauce earlier in the day, which made it a very quick dinner prep.

the sauce with this dish absolutely made it. i did it in a separate pan and let it reduce for about 10 minutes before swirling in the butter. sooo yummy. the polenta gave the chicken a nice crunch too. i served mine with roasted broccoli with red peppers and brown rice.

My husband & I thought this was a good dish. I skipped the escarole and served with haricot verts and mashed potatoes.

My husband & I liked this very much. I served it with a tomato checca on top instead of the escarole and it was very good. Will serve for dinner party tho next time I'd cut the breasts in half because they were huge. The polenta gives it a nice crunch and adds something a little different.

I hesitated to make this recipe because of the mixed reviews. I'm glad I gave it a shot. If you like balsamic vinegar, you will LOVE this recipe. Excellent chicken and fabulous sauce. My wife and It actually is a quick and easy entree too.

Chicken was nice and crispy, but the recipe made way too much sauce. Another problem was that the balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the sauce, resulting in a too-tart accompaniment. Finally, the just-wilted escarole ended up being too tough and crunchy to eat -- should have been cooked a bit more. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

We liked the chicken with the polenta, but the sauce was just weird. I did make it with mashed potatoes, which helped balance out the meal.

I used pasta flour instad of polenta, and the chicken was good. The sause was very pungent and I agree with other reviewer, most unattractive. Brown and goopy, looked like mole sauce. I added more sugar to balance the vinegary taste, but I would suggest reducing the vinegar and maybe increasing tomato paste and sugar a bit.

I thought this was fabulous and so did my husband. I used chicken tenders and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I also sauteeed in cooking spray + just a bit of olive oil. Quick, easy and tastes restaurant-quality

This was not very good. Fried chicken with an unattractive looking purple sauce. And using escarole, which does not react to the sauce, did little to enhance the dish. I suggest spinach or another green that will at least wilt and absorb some of the sauce. Not bad, but not worth making again.
