I made this with arugula, pancetta and fingerling potatoes. I also used dried tarragon, as I had no fresh herbs. It is very tasty, although it seems to need something...not sure what. I think I might try adding some sauteed mushrooms next time to add more depth of flavor...and maybe a little more cheese.

So easy and delicious! I made this recipe first Crisp Potato and Bacon Casserole and then used it to make the frittata! Crisp Potato and Bacon Casserole really made the frittata awesome!

This was hearty and smelled delicious while cooking! The kids loved it, even my picky eater. I chose to add broccoli florets chopped small and shredded cheddar/parm to top. Appreciated broiling method to make sure top was sufficiently baked and with the iron skillet it was a one pan meal!

Excellent. Sub'd blanched cauliflower for the potatoes.

This was delicious. I increased the eggs to 10 to serve 5. I bought provolone cheese but opted not to use it and I am glad I skipped it. It was rich enough in taste without it. You need to keep an eye on the bottom, taking care it does not brown too much.

This was delicious! Once I had everything prepped, this recipe was simple from start to finish. We'll definitely eat this again.
