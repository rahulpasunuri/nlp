Tastes great. I didn't have trouble following the recipe. I wish more recipes were in this format. I email them to my blackberry in the kitchen. Condensed like this. its easier to read.

If this is a memoir of food, the author needs to get out more. She also needs to put a little effort into presenting her recipe which won't format but is as follows (I'll use slashes to indicate new line): 4 1.5 lb. chickens/ garlic cloves/ 2 Tbsp lime juice/ salt and pepper/ 2 Tbsp oregano mixed with 2 Tbsp thyme/ 2 Tbsp olive oil/ Cut the four chickens in half./ Rub with garlic cloves./ Rub with lime juice./ Rub with salt and pepper./ Rub with the herbs./ Refrigerate for one hour./ Rub with olive oil just before broiling./ Broil 8 minutes on each side./ -- The author helpfully tells us that the broiling time depends on the size of the chickens. But we know that - one and a half pounds. -- Be careful! If you add the herbs before the salt and pepper the chickens will explode! -- Just kidding.
