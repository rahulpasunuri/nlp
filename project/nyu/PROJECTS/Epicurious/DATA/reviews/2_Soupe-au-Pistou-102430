It's a soup that has many variations depending on who's cooking but I was born and raised in Marseille and my grandmother never used turnips, carrots or fennel. Or even pumpkin (!) as Gina suggests. There is no pumpkin in Provence and the Soupe au Pistou is a spring dish! No Parsley and no bay leaf either! I don't know what you had but it wasn't a Pistou, sorry. Nor is this recipe. There's one on the side that comes close though. Traditionally, it's a very simple soup of green and romano beans, zucchinis, yes potatoes, red and white beans, tomatoes, sometimes leeks or celery. And yes there is pasta is most versions of this soup. The pesto should go in the soup, and thicken it further, not alongside. You can add some sausage and parmesan cheese rinds when cooking the veggies to deepen the flavors and make it heartier.

On 2/26,04, Gina Kantner gave a brief description of her version of Soupe au Pistou. It looked interesting. She stated that she would share her authentic recipe. How do we write and ask her?

I lived 10 years in the south of france, so this is one of my specialities..first of all angel hair pasta is not used..The vegetables used are ,carrots,pumpkin, turnip,green beans, white coco beans,celery,zuchini,fennel,and you can add potatoes if you wish, Onions lots,tomatoes.all are diced and placed in a pot to boil with water...You add a bouquet garni made with parsley, Bayleaf and thyme, you boil the white beans separately till soft before adding them...season with salt and pepper to taste...when the soup is all cooked thats when you add the pesto made with garlic, fresh basil and olive oil... This soup is delicious,and by NO MEANS THIN or Bland...At the end you can also add cooked small noodles, but this is optional if you have the white beans...It was a favourite at my Cafe, and was written up in the Gazette...so if anyone wants the authentic recipe just write and ask me..

This is a suggestion for Ron & Aline: You're obviously not vegans, (or you wouldn't have added chicken broth). That being the case, I can make a suggestion, since I too have tried to cut down on meat; Better Than Bouillion is a product that will add a nice, rich meat flavor to dishes w/o the meat. Also, instead of using water, try homemade vegetable broth w/ a dash of Better Than Boullion.

We initially decided to prepare this soup because it sounded like a hearty, although healthful dish. However, we found it to be somewhat thin and bland until we added a cup of chicken stock for flavor and a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. Finally, after adding the cheese and some freshly ground black pepper, it turned out to be quite tasty. We try to be health-conscious in our household by eating meatless dishes, and we certainly are not professional cooks, but in our limited experience, it seems to us that eliminating meat in many dishes almost always compromises the flavor. we would be very interested in hearing how other folks somehow circumvent this problem.
