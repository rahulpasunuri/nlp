i have made this for the past 3 years and am making it again for this year's christmas feast! absolutely divine: moist, succulent and beyond flavourful. i make my own mixture of spices for the brine, but it is similar to a creole spice. my one advice (as mentioned below)is to ensure you use UNSALTED butter, or the gravy will tend to be on the salty side. i also do not bother salting the turkey itself. i do make my gravy from the drippings, but keep it simple with only rosemary, a pinch of instant coffee and a splash of soy sauce (sounds crazy, but it's amazing). give this one a try - your guests will thank you!

I have made this recipe for the past 4 yrs. It is exceptional and comes out incredibly moist and delicious. I have not experienced the salty gravy issue but I follow my own recipe and do not add salt and do not use salted butter. I would not recommend making turkey soup from the bones though due to the salt. I have tweaked the recipe to my liking and have substituted cracked black pepper in place of the creole seasoning, it is so good that I would not go back to any other method of preparation.

The turkey itself was delicious but the gravy turned out so salty no one could eat it... since gravy is an important component of this sort of dish I have to give it only 2 forks. Thank go we also had cooked a goose so we used that gravy. Will not make this again

The turkey came out very delicious, even though I overcooked it a bit, thanks to the brining. The meat was moist and flavorful. However, I would not suggest making the gravy from the drippings. It verged on the edge of being inedible because of too much salt. Just as we were about to sit down for Thanksgiving dinner, I was at the stove frantically trying to cut the salt with a potato and sugar. It could be my fault, though. I used salted butter on the skin and inside the bird, but I omitted the salt sprinkle on the outside of the turkey.

My husband and I made this for Thanksgiving and this turkey was delicious. I bought a pre-brined turkey (Trader Joes), so I skipped the brining step. I also placed a buttered cheesecloth over the breast, as I was worried the high temp might dry out the breast a bit. It turned out great. The breast was juicy and the overall flavor of the turkey was excellent. I made gravy with the pan drippings and the gravy wasn't too salty as I had feared with the brined bird. This will definitely be our new staple turkey recipe.

I made this a couple of years ago and everyone raved about it (including reformed vegetarians who were lukewarm about turkey in years past). Trying a pre-brined turkey from Trader Joes this year, but everything else is about the same.

Great success with this recipe, but used this brine from the Dec 22 2010 Vancouver Sun: 2 gallons water, 1 1/2 cups kosher salt, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup honey,2 heads of garlic cut in half, 2 lemons cut in half, 1 tablespoon peppercorns, 6 bay leaves, large bundle of fresh sage, thyme, and rosemary (1/2 of a 14g package for each). Boil, then cool completely before submerging the bird. Following the split temperature method (450/350) the 17 lb. turkey was done in 3 hours (or less) in a convection oven. But roasting first at 450 caused the skin to brown too quickly, probably because of the sugar in the brine. Next time will try at an even 325 for the entire time.

This was my first turkey, and it went marvelously!! The absolute only thing I would change is to eliminate the salt you sprinkle on the skin before putting it in the oven- it was just this side of too salty, which made the gravy just a bit too salty (didn't follow their recipe for the gravy, just did a roux of flour/drippings, then added turkey stock), which made the entire thing a bit too salty. But it was juicy, tender and wonderful! The herbs stuffed into the cavity really infused the meat with flavor wonderfully- I have never been able to taste the herbs in such a subtle yet aromatic way.

Made this yesterday - FABULOUS! I did not brine the turkey, but did sprinkle a little of the Tony's creole seasoning inside the cavity (1 Tablespoon perhaps). I was generous with the herbs and filled up the cavity with the veggies/herbs. The recipe calls for 3 sticks of butter - I used one stick, melted it and basted the outside to start with the butter, and then basted both outside and dripped some inside as the bird roasted. That was it for butter, just one stick total. Tons of raves from the dinner guests - the most beautiful turkey you've ever seen (due to the color from the high temp to start), and wonderfully moist!

YUM. Moist and flavorful. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to put pats of butter and minced herbs under the skin, also I accidentally cooked it at 375*-400* 3/4ths of the time ( I realised it too late!), and it turned out perfect, and cooked at record speed! Everyone that ate it tonight said it was the best turkey they have ever had!

This was the best turkey I have ever made. I have been trying different turkey recipes for years and this one is the winner. I don't think I will be trying any new recipes as this one is a keeper for the holidays. The only difference I made was not to brine the turkey. I did not have the time or inclination this year and it still turned out super moist and yummy. I also placed the turkey in a baking bag so I did not baste it at all.

Everyone loved the turkey I made using this recipe. I found it a bit salty and so when I make it again next year, I will add less salt next year. I made my own creole seasoning (there are plenty of recipes for it online) and will just make it without the salt next time. Also, I used the Pomegranate recipe others suggested and they were right - it was divine!

This was as good as described in reviews. I think this was the moistest roast turkey I've ever had and I plan to make it next year. All my guests loved it. Be sure to use unsalted butter as recommended in the recipe. I tried to get away with the salted butter I had on hand and it made the turkey close to too salty.

Made for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. It was very moist, with the herbs giving a nice flavor to the gravy also.

By unanimous vote, best turkey we ever had for Thanksgiving.

this will be the 3rd year I make this turkey. Each year, this is the best turkey anyone has ever tried. Its NEVER dry and always very moist. I don't know what it is, I have brined turkeys before, but this one takes the cake! its absolutely delicious and is now MY thanksgiving turkey recipe, no question about it. I brine the tom about 3 days before in the cooler weighed down with ice on top. The ice usually doesn't even melt by the 3rd day. Wonderful recipe! THANKS Epicurious :D

Great recipe. This was the first time I brined a turkey and it was no effort at all. The turkey came out super moist with great flavor. Will make again for sure!

I made this Turkey recipe for Thanksgiving and my family all said it was the best Turkey that they had ever had. I also had another Turkey cooked on the rotisserie and a leg of lamb, and everyone just wanted to eat this Turkey. I made it exactly as it was written.

Fantastic turkey recipe, finally I made a Thanksgiving turkey that was moist and flavorful. I had to add extra butter and chicken broth to keep basting. Drippings made a great gravy, I just added a cup of apple cider, cider vinegar, broth and flour.

I have never written review of a recipe, and probably won't again, but this turkey recipe was so incredible I'm actually moved to sit down and write about it. Twenty-five years of marriage, 2 turkeys a year and as many new recipes, I have never come across anything to beat this. Incredibly moist and flavourable - it just doesn't get any better. And to accompany this, the best stuffing I've ever made, Italian Sausage and Bread Stuffing, also featured on Epicurious. 5 forks for both.

This was my very first time making the Thanksgiving turkey and it was a huge success, everyone wanted to take home leftovers, which were even better the next day. It's been a couple of weeks since Thanksgiving and Im craving turkey already, which has never happened before. Very, very good recipe and very easy.

This recipe was simple and the Turkey was excellent. Made it for Thanksgiving with rave reviews from our dinner guests. I will make it again for Christmas. I used a 20 lb turkey and the recipe was fine. Basting the turkey is a must and don't be afraid of the butter it really adds to the taste and the juices are to die for

Please just make this if you are looking for a fullprooof turkey recipe! I am a novice at cooking game and poultry, and this recipe was stellar! I served it to 8 Chinese nationals in Shanghai for Thanksgiving. Before we started eating, they agreed that the Chinese dont eat turkey because, "it tastes like wood! (meaning dry and flavorless)." They changed their opinion after they tried turkey brined with this method and cooked with this butter recipe. The 10kg turkey was literally picked clean. No joke. I did add one more stick of butter in the basting process. Truly finger looking good.Cooking turkey no longer scares me!

This was my first turkey I cooked. It was amazing! The meat was tender and juicy. Cooking at high heat in the beginning allowed for a nice brown color without producing a dry white meat. The only change I made was to use shallots instead of onions and followed the gravy recipe from the Herb-roasted turkey with shallot pan gravy on epicurious. According to my boyfriend the gravy was better than his mothers on her best gravy day. I will definitely be using this turkey brining and cooking method again.

This turkey won rave reviews. My husband said it was the best turkey dinner he ever ate. Brine is simple & makes all the difference in a tasty end product.

By far the best turkey we've ever made. Was intimidated by the brining and worried end product would be too salty, but it was great! My husband was concerned about the cajun seasoning in the brine not pairing well with the classic herbs of the final product, but the cajun is really not detected in the finished product.

This turkey is exceptional. The brine is simple and straightforward. The cooking part is, too. The end product is moist and tender with a great balanced flavour. It may be the best I ever cooked. Skip the gravy thats supposed to go with it. Too much trouble and not nearly as great as the bird.
