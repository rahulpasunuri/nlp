This recipe was terrible! I added the additional garlic, basil, and oregano like other reviewers suggested. I also almost doubled the cayenne like other reviewers suggested. What I got was a spicy, but otherwise bland, stew. There were no complex flavors. I would not make this again. Zucchini are perfect grilled with a little salt and pepper; I will not ruin them again by using this recipe.

Was a big hit and everybody loved it. Like others suggested put in plenty of fresh garlic and also seasoned with greek oregano. Did not use can tomatoes but used fresh italian plum tomatoes. I used 6 large and probably could have used 1 or 2 more. I made a big pan of this recipe. Crumbled up feta cheese on top and had crusty bread with it. :)

Yum. I rated this 4 forks because it really is more than the sum of its parts. I added fresh garlic, fresh oregano, and 2 pinches of cinnamon, per other suggestions, all good. And I have to say, that tiny bit of cinnamon really makes it. And the cayenne, of course. So good!

My husband, whos more of a meat-eater than I am, said this is something north of a 3. I thought it was good, but definitely better for my tinkering. (Sorry, not usually so self- aggrandizing!) Even though I usually like my veggies crisp, for some reason simmering the beans & zucchini with the potatoes really worked in this recipe. And the potatoes did seem to take forever to cook! At least 45 minutes, and I added a bit of liquid along the way. Loved the feta/bread on the side. My tinkering came because the recipe seemed really bland, even though I made some of the changes others recommended (garlic with the onions, a little fresh basil, ½ can of chickpeas (near the end), ½ a lemon quartered, oregano). I also realized at the last minute that I didnt have any canned diced or whole tomatoes, so used a mix of tomato puree & a couple of farmers market tomatoes. But most important, I think, was a T or so of anchovy paste  somehow it seems to really perk up all the other flavors, though maybe its just the saltiness of it&

I used garlic like others suggested. I only had frozen and canned tomatoes from last year so I added oregano,tyme, basil from my garden so it would be more like italiam style tomatoes. If I was to make it again I would add more onion, garlic and zucchini. I also would add the beans and squash after the potatoes were almost because I like my vegs crispy. I also added some red wine,red pepper flakes, and tomato paste to thicken and give more flavor.

Such a simple recipe yields a delicious, complex stew. We served it with garlicky Greek salad and fresh bread. Everyone had seconds.

Oh! Don't forget to add garlic. I don't know why it isn't in the original in the first place...but I do love garlic.

I can't adequately put in to words how much I love this recipe. The cayenne adds just the right kick, and the ingredients are so budget friendly and healthy! First time I made it, boyfriend was skeptical because there was no meat (typical) but it definitely proved him wrong, which he willingly admitted! Followed other suggestions to top with feta and a fried egg, and serve with hearty bread: a must. Makes it a full meal. Even made it for my whole family while home for Winter Break and literally everyone had seconds. One of my favorites.

Wow, this was a winner. I doubled the recipe to serve at an Oscar party. I took the advice of other reviewers: doubled the cayenne; sauteed a few chopped garlic cloves with the onion; bought feta cheese to be sprinkled on top as wanted. Be sure to use Italian style canned tomatoes as they are pre-seasoned. Everyone raved about this stew. I found it delicious too and I don't even like vegetable stew. I only made it to impress a vegetarian guy at the party.

This is a great recipe to play around with and I have done the modifications as others have described here with good results every time. Or you can just leave the recipe as is and add garlic and it's a knockout. I'm not fond of cold potatoes but I had to agree that it's awesome cold, and I may even prefer it cold the next day. Yum.

Awesome. OK the changes - added a half a can of garbanzo beans and also a half lemon cut up in chunks and added both with the potatoes. Really yummy. And as others say - the feta and crusty bread is critical! Enjoy!

followed recipe and made 2 additions, 1/2 cup fresh basil and 1/2 red bellpepper. It is yummy. Don't forget the feta -- it's a knockout finish. Served cheap Bay Bridge Cab and whole grain baguette. Can't wait to have it again!

Loved it. Add the feta. And 1/2 tsp. cayenne not 1/4. Perfect for the vast amount of beans, squash and tomatoes in the garden now. Even for slightly overgrown beans.

I have spent some time in the Greek part of Cyprus and was often served dishes spiced with cilantro. Therefore, I tried half parsley and half cilantro and think it added a lot to this dish. I also used garlic as suggested by others and crumbled feta directly on the stew with bread on the side.

This was a great, easy recipe. I added several cloves of garlic and upped the pepper but really liked the results.

This is fantastic! I stuck to the recipe closely to give it a try before taking other reviewers' suggestions, and I didn't find it bland: the flavors of the vegetables really stood out. I served it with feta and bread, as suggested, and a fried egg to make it a meal. I will definitely be making this again!

Rating: 3
A very good stew. We used quite a lot more cayenne than called for, which I think is necessary if you like a lot of spice and flavour. Also, because the grocery store was out of zucchini, I ended up using acorn squash in instead, and that was excellent. As suggested, topping it with feta is excellent.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic! Super easy to make, simple ingredients and wonderful flavours. I cooked this up and packaged it for my lunches during the week; the last two weeks in a row! I used a full tsp of cayenne for kick, added about 1 tbsp oregano and a minced clove of garlic. Sprinkling the feta on top adds a really nice flavour, but isn't necessary. I recommend using crushed tomatoes if you're in a hurry.

Rating: 3
Nothing quite so nice a cheap, healthy, and delicious meal. I took into account the suggestion of adding oregeno and garlic, I also upped the cayenne. Topped off the stew with feta and a drizzle of olive oil and ate with whole wheat bread. Really good is all I can say.

Rating: 4
This is a great dish and we love it. I agree with the others that it needs some punch. I add two or three gloves of garlic after the onions for about 15 seconds then add the beans. I also add a "heaping" amount of the cayenne and that seems to bring enough heat. The feta cheese topping is a great idea. We have made this a number of times and find it is a great vegetarian dish.

Despite the ordinary ingredients, this makes a very yummy meal. Based on others' suggestions, I added 3 cloves of garlic, doubled the cayenne, added about 1 TB of dried oregano and topped with a tangy Greek feta. I think it's great and earns its four forks easily. Also, incredibly easy to prepare. I used Trader Joe's frozen haricots verts, some multi- colored new potatoes (left the skin on), canned tomatoes -- couldn't be easier.

I subbed carrots for zucchini since the market had no squash. I added extra potatoes and garlic per the suggestions. Very easy and tasty.

This is a great vegetarian meal. I double the amount of potatoes (cut in 1/2" cubes), use a can of crushed tomatoes,and add garlic and oregano. Don't forget the feta and crusty bread.

Surprisingly spicy, this packs a lot of flavor. Half is ample for two with leftovers. Since this does not contain cheese or other rich ingredients, it's a great side dish with Greek dishes containing feta or other types of cheese. Yum! Yum! I served it with Braised Greek Chicken with Artichokes. This will become a part of my tried and true recipe file.

I love this dish - it is so versatile...Tonight, I doubled the green beans (tiny, slender ones, used whole) and potatoes, added cinnamon and oregano, and about 1 c. of chicken broth. Oh, and another 15-oz. can of tomatoes. It simmered down into this incredible stew with a depth of flavor that suggested much more effort than was required. I served it with couscous (made with chicken broth, garlic and olive oil), and roasted chicken. Fabulous. I will repeat this particular variation - and perhaps add chickpeas, for a great vegetarian meal. Definitely worth the four forks, considering the end result from minimal effort.

It's amazing that a dish so easy to make and so healthy tastes so delicious. You have to try this one. I wanted something a little heartier so I added extra potatoes. My husband love it too. I wish there were more dishes like this!

Okay, this is a good base recipe that can be jazzed up with different spices and flavours. Try this: Add 1/4 cup of homemade pesto right before simmering and sprinkle raw shelled pumpkin seeds on top with the feta before serving. The pesto gives this dish a richer flavour and the pumkin seeds lend a lovely crunchy texture to the mix.

This gets 4 forks for ease of preparation, use of seasonal ingredients AND great taste. We used fingerling potatoes and topped with cotija cheese (Mexican parmesan) because we ran out of feta (put it all in the Greek salad we served with the stew). Added some crusty bread and had a very hearty and tasty weeknight meal with leftovers for both of our lunches the next day! Perfect!

Rating: 4
We don't often give 4 forks! We made this only due to an excess of green beans, potatoes, zucchini and tomatoes from our veg delivery last week and were amazed by how delicious it was! Definately hearty enough as a main course - we served it with some crusty ciabatta bread (MMM). I added a couple of cloves of garlic, as suggested, and half cayenne, half cinnamon for spice - would not change a thing. We topped with feta too- a must. Who knew 'everyday' vegetables could be so good together?

This was very good by itself as a side dish. But with feta cheese and Greek bread it made a delicious and hearty vegetarian meal. Even my husband who's not into vegetarian meals said it was good, and my teenager loved it too. I had to use frozen green beans otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I liked the feta in larger chunks, not crumbled too small -- it needed the texture as well as the flavor.

This was very easy and delicious! I second the others who said you must have the feta, though. I used canned, already-diced tomatoes, which cut down on the prep time.

This was okay. I made it with eggplant instead of zucchini, but that tends to become slimy. Perhaps the zucchini would have been better after all. I also added thyme and lemon juice.

Delicious recipe, but the feta cheese is essential. The french feta is less salty than other varieties. My Greek husband loves it and doesn't even complain about "no meat."

This was a nice recipe. Some friends and I watched "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" on video and they wanted me to find a Greek recipe to make a themed dinner. Anyway, this is pretty simple and despite the lack of many spices or herbs, this was very tasty and everyone liked it-- even the finicky 8 year old of our group. I didn't think it was substantial enough for a main course, so towards the end of the cooking, I placed some fresh cod over the top to steam. It was great, salt and pepper them before you add, if you want to try it. I will definitely make this again.

BORING! Whatever made me think that simmering a few vegetables would result in a 'delicious' greek stew? I guess I thought it might be magic. Even with the feta PLUS I added some oregano and lemon juice - both fresh - still so very boring.

I've lived in Greece for the past 10 years and this has become one of my favorite dishes, especially in the summer when the green beans are fresh. I use fresh, pureed tomatoes instead of canned when they are in season too. I also add minced garlic, and in Greece we actually use about 1 cup of very high quality olive olive to about 2 lbs. of fresh green beans. Maybe a little rich for American tastes but wonderful for sopping up the sauce with crusty bread and big hunks of feta cheese.
