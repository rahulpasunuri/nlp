This sandwich is wonderful, and this is the second time I've made it. I'm a college cook, so I cook single portions, but the salsa saves wonderfully (the flavors blend). Even though the bread starts to go stale before I finish the loaf, toasting it masks this. This is a pretty easy recipe to prepare for one person (and the ingredients are not too 'out there' for a college kitchen), and provides several lunches/dinners.

I, too, used about 1 1/2 eggs because maybe So Cal sourdough is just bigger than everywhere else! Also, I plan on more olives next time (love me the kalamata!) and more salsa in general, 'cause it was the good.

Delicious sandwich! The only thing I would recommend would be using about 1 1/2-2 hardboiled eggs per sandwich. I used large sourdough slices and the egg seemed to get lost in the salsa flavor. I don't normally like egg sandwiches but this is the perfect balance of flavors.
