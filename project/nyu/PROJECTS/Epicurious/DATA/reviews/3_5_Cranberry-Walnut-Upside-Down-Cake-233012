Wow this is a wonderful cake. Made this for Christmas for 40 people with 10 other desserts....huge hit! Followed the recipe, but made the batter first. I did not use extra butter for the topping, as one reviewer suggested, and the topping cracked into small pieces, giving it an almost candy taste...delicious!! I used an oven-safe non-stick frying pan and it came out beautifully!! This is a keeper!

Made this for an office Christmas lunch. Huge hit -- I made it in a 9" (fairly heavy) non-stick cake pan, and it worked beautifully. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made the cake batter first, then the topping, poured the hot topping into the pan, then spooned the batter on top. Needed about 32 minutes, then did the 15-minute cooling thing and the cake slid right out. Fantastic. Requests for the recipe right and left!

I have made this recipe several times to rave reviews. I use an oven safe, non-stick pan without any problems. I found adding an extra tablespoon of butter to the topping dissolves the sugar a little better, improving texture on the topping. Great dessert with minimal work and mess!

Really appreciate the reviews and tips - yes, a glass pie plate works beautifully. I did find that the cake needed to bake about 35 minutes. In any event, in chatting with our dinner guests last night, I remembered pineapple upside-down cakes were a staple of my childhood, and no one ever used a cast-iron skillet!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving WITHOUT a cast-iron skillet, and had absolutely no problems! I used a 10-inch glass pie plate. No issues, the cake slid right out after cooling for 15 minutes. It was really easy to put together, but resulted in a quite impressive-looking dessert! I used more fresh cranberries and obviously didn't use a skillet, but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out lovely!

I have made this cake several times, always around the holidays, and it always gets great reviews. To chime in on the skillet/dish issue: I have made it in a skillet and I have also made the topping and then poured it into a buttered 10 inch pie dish. If you don't have a skillet, I find that making the topping after the cake so that you can pour the cake batter right on top of the freshly made and transferred topping is the best way. I've never had any issues with sticking. This cake is great warm or at room temperature! Doesn't last that long!

To "by booffy", who asked if it was essential to use a cast iron skillet when making this cake, I would say yes. I've made upside down cakes in both cast iron and stainless steel pans and the crucial moment is when you flip the cake onto a plate. You have a much better chance of having the topping come out in one piece with a cast iron pan. I've scrapped out and patched together many a topping before I purchased a cast iron pan, but even a cast iron pan doesn't guarantee 100% success.

A truly delectable cake! I substitute sour cream for the buttermilk for a moister, more tender crumb. It is a favorite for holiday breakfast/brunch. Serve it warm with whipped cream and no one can resist it!

Excellent recipe. I used drained leftover whole berry cranberry sauce. Wow.

This cake looks better than it tasted. It wowed my guest. But the taste was very bland and the walnuts really didnt work well with the crandberries. Better breakfast dish than dessert.Will probably not make this one again.

I'd love to try this recipe for a holiday party coming up...but I don't have a cast iron skillet..Is it essential to use a cast iron skillet or would an ordinary skillet do? Thanks!

I made this with dried cranberries and it was delicious!

This cake was delicious! I was worried about the cast iron pan but everything worked out great. I made fresh whipped cream the night I made the cake but it was equally delicious with cool whip the next day. I will make this again around Thanksgiving time.

I made several of these around Christmas time but I changed things a little and they still turned out fabulous. I halved the butter in the topping and the sugar to some extent, then I arranged canned mandrine oranges in a pretty pattern on in the pan, filled in the spaces between the oranges with dried cranberries that had been soaked in O.J. concentrate and a little water and then put about a 1/2-3/4 cup of nuts evenly sprinkled over that. In the cake I added fresh orange zest and then the rest of the dried canberries (soaked about 4oz. dried per cake). I also made a couple of double layer ones and for those I did one cake with cranberry sauce with a little butter as the topping and then for the top layer I did the arranged oranges. (I also made mine with about 2/3 WW flour which gave them a little more nutty flavor.) Love this cake!

I have made this cake several times and it is a crowd pleaser. Very easy and makes a great dessert for brunch as well as for after dinner.

I made this cake twice now. Once for a holiday party and once for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved the cake. The lemon zest is needed. Also you have to use the 10" skillet on this otherwise it will fall. I will definitly make it again.

Delicious dessert that resembles a crumb cake. I followed the recipe and it turned out delicious and moist. Be careful when reheating the topping as the recipe says to bring to a bubble again. I took too long to add the batter and ended up burning a bit of the topping in the process.

Wow! Made this for Christmas dinner dessert and it was a big hit. Best of all, it was incredibly easy.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was easy to make and very good. Per the other reviewers, I used 12 oz of berries and grated lemon rind.

I made this cake last nite, with high expectations from the other readers' high marks. I made it in a 10' springform (didn't have a cast iron skillet), did the toothpick test and all was fine. I took it out of the oven to cool 15 minutes, came back and the center had caved in!! So disappointing, as I was planning to impress a church group holiday party! I may give it one more try, but VERY skeptical, as I'm an experienced cook and never have flops like that!

This was great! Easy to make. I wasn't sure the cake batter was covering the cranberries and walnut mixture sufficiently, by spread it out as well as I could. As it was perfect when baked, slipped out of the pan easily. Can't wait to make it again...

This was amazing! I added about 1/2 cup of orange juice to the cake batter and about 1/4 cup to the topping. I only used about 2/3 stick of butter and it turned out great. I used the entire bag of cranberries and the result was a perfect blend of tangy and sweet.

WOW! This is probably one of the best recipes I've made on Epicurious to date. I made it to the letter and it is a wonderful, delicious cake. It's beautiful - would be a perfect party cake. I can't wait to try it with cherries or another fruit.

Made it to the letter and it turned out fantastic. Next time, I will add the entire bag of cranberries and some citrus zest. It was super easy and very attractive to boot. My husband and I both enjoyed it and I had one too many slices as a result. I would definitely do this again.

continuation from previous post; By the way, I used non fat buttermild as well because that was all I could find. Maybe thats why it took a little longer

I served this at a dinner party we were invited to. Everyone enjoyed it completely. I added double the amount of cranberries as suggested and I am very glad I did. I had a little scare when baking it. I used a 12 inch pan instead of a 10 inch (I don't know if that had anything to do with it) but I had to double the cooking time to get it to solidify. I was sure I had done something wrong but it cooked through eventually and was delicious.

I made this last Thanksgiving to great acclaim, and plan to make it again this year. It looks beautiful and tastes great. I do recall having to use more than the recommended amount of cranberries--I think I just looked for good pan coverage--and it came out fine. I didn't bother toasting the walnuts. Next time I will definitely follow previous posters' suggestions to add either grated orange or lemon rind--the cake is a little boring without it. Otherwise--delicious!

A total failure. The cake portion was sour-tasting, the topping too sweet-tart. Used non-fat buttermilk in the cake because it was all I could find.

Yummy! I made this as written except I added the whole 12 oz. bag of cranberries, and found it just right. The cake was moist and the topping had just the right amount of sweetness. Even my daughter liked it and she rarely likes any cake with fruit and nuts. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe twice now-- both times, made twice the topping:cake ratio suggested (once halved the cake, and once doubled the topping, depending on the size of the pan). Both times I got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Found the recipe to be quick and easy to prepare, with beautiful results.

Excellent. I made it the first time in a Cusinart stainless steel pan. The second time I made it in two loaf pans. Both were great and I was asked for the recipe by several guests.

My family thought this recipe was delicious! It was easy to prepare and turned out perfectly. I added finely chopped candied ginger to the topping. I chopped about 1/2 cup and added it to the cranberries prior to pouring the batter over the topping. Wonderful!

Excellent and simple. I used slightly more frozen cranberries and it came out beautifully. Next time, I will add some orange or lemon zest to the batter to enhance the flavor. Also, before flipping the cake, heat the pan over medium flame just to unstick the topping, about 1.5 minutes.

I really love this cake -- with a few changes. I felt 7 oz of cranberries was not enough, so I used about 10-11 oz. I chopped about half of the cranberries in the food processor and this allowed for more even cranberry coverage. I also added some orange oil and zest to the cake batter along with a bit of cinnamon allspice and cloves.

Fantastic! The recipe worked perfectly as written. I used a non-stick cast iron skillet and it came out beautifully.

The cake was very moist and beautiful to look at. I made it in an old cast iron fry pan which worked great. I think it would be great as a breakfast/brunch cake as well as for dinner. It was easy to make!

Fabulous! Cake was light and the topping, delicious. I baked the cake in my 10" All-Clad stainless non-stick fry pan; it worked perfectly!

Very nice cake, topping less than wonderful. May try again with something to add more moisture and flavor--maybe some apple and cinnamon?? Done earlier than stated time, too.
