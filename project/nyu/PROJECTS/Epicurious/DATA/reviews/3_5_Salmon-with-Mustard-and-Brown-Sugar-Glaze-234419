Easy, attractive, and flavorful! Kids enjoyed it too, because glaze makes it less fishy (picky kids) - an easy weeknight meal - toss a salad add a starch, and a nice glass of wine - good to go!

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. i left out the capers, used Dijon. Didn't have Old Bay used some fresh dill and paprika. The next day i used the leftovers to make Capellini with Salmon and Lemon-dilll vodka sauce. Leftout the vodka. Sauteed some mushrooms and onions and cooked that sauce at the end added some frozen peas. Both recipes very tasty and easy to prepare.

Whoops! I meant to type STEELHEAD trout, not hammerhead. I must have sharks on the brain.

What a weird combo of flavours this is. Pleasant, though! Admittedly, my fiance made the mistake of buying hammerhead trout instead of salmon, but it worked just fine, flavour-wise. I enjoyed it and would probably make it again but I definitely won't be adding it to my regular repertoire. It's good but not spectacular or anything.

Terrific salmon recipe! So easy yet so flavorful and elegant! I agree with the rater who suggested the capers -- they are a great addition. This has become a regular in our home

I loved this although I followed a previous poster's suggestions verbatim. I've made this twice successfully now to rave reviews. "For those who thought the glaze was a little strong - in a small saucepan, combine the wine, sugar, butter, and 2-3 TBSP dijon mustard. Simmer on high until reduced by one- third. Marinate the salmon using half of the sauce for at least 1 hour, then cook as directed. When the recipe calls for adding the glaze, simply add the other half of the sauce."

Easy and delicious! I made this for Christmas dinner. I used Steelhead instead of Salmon. Pretty similar in taste and texture. I followed the recipe almost exactly. A little less wine and butter as I tripled the recipe and I probably left our a stick of butter and 1/2 cup of wine. But the fish was still half covered in the wine and butter sauce while baking. I don't bake fish much as I prefer to grill them. But this came out perfect, tasted amazing, and everyone loved it. This is definitely a keeper. I did cook these big 2.5 pound fillets on cookie sheets, next time I'll use glass baking dishes and cut the fish into portions. This way the sauce will cover the fish more and I'll need less of the wine/butter sauce.

Rating: 4
Delicious, but forget the butter in the poaching liquid, it's not needed. Instead, mix melted butter with panko and after the salmon has cooked, spread with the glaze and top with the panko and broil quickly until just browned. Of course, it may no longer be 'lo cal':)

Didn't have the Old Bay Seasoning but still got raves. I just broiled the salmon and added the sauce near the end. It is very quick this way and the salmon is very tender, just like we prefer.

I decreased the amount of butter, but otherwise made this as stated. It was good. It was not mind-blowing good. But considering how easy it was to make, I think I would make this again. I particularly liked the way the salmon was basically poached in the butter/wine/seasoning mixture. The wine gave the fish such a nice flavor. Might make again with variation.

Rating: 1
A waste of good fish! Too little seasoning in the wine/butter sauce and boiling the wine only makes it sweeter - which isn't needed due to the addition of the sugar coating. Moreover, the main reason to add sugar coating to fish, is so that it will sear the fish when sauteeing. However, this dish isn't sauteed!

Loved this recipe. Poached the salmon with sauce on top in Pernod and a bit of water. Cooked to barely cooked so it was still firm Deeeelicious.

Let me start by saying that I have not had success with cooking fish at home before. I tried this recipe because I was looking for something easy with lots of flavor. Success. I eyeballed the amounts of brown sugar and mustard, I think this part would be pretty hard to screw up. You can definitely taste the mustard, so use something that you like. Served with saffron risotto for an elegant weeknight meal.

Rating: 3
I feel bad reviewing this as-is because I made such a big change...I didn't have any white wine so I used an extra-hoppy IPA instead. You know what? It worked. I used more Old Bay than called for because Old Bay is awesome, cut down the butter and sugar/mustard combo, and cooked the salmon for 10 minutes at 450 to sear it nicely. Quite tasty!

Rating: 1
While quick and easy, I too felt the sauce overpowered the salmon. I should have read more comments because I used all the glaze atop the fish. Wish the instruction had said that. However, even if is painted on lightly, it is still too sweet for my taste. I'd like to try it again, using the Dallas suggestion or just modify the baking liquid, which I think has potential. I used a sw eet and hot honey mustard that I wanted to use up that I thought came close to Guldens.

i'm a complete novice when it comes to cooking. this recipe, however, was amazingly simple and the end product is fantastic (fantastic enough to trick someone into thinking i do this all the time! haha) i paired the salmon with steamed broccoli and brown rice with ice tea! Perfect summer meal. I will DEFINITELY being doing this again.

This is so good! I made it pretty much according to recipe for my boyfriend and he was begging for more... he literally asked me the next day if it was too soon to make it again. A few days later I made it for my sister's kids and they loved it too! For the kids I skipped the first sauce with the wine and just baked the fish with some salt and pepper, then added the glaze and broiled a few minutes more. This is a super easy recipe that everyone loves!

Rating: 4
This turned out exceptional! Really easy to make, perfect for a week night! I served with a bunch of chopped up veggies that I brushed with olive oil and cooked along side the fish (different cookie sheet, but at same time). I reduced the regular cooking time from 14 to 9 minutes because I was cooking only for 2, kept same broil time. Next time will probably use less butter, but enjoyed as written.

Didn't have the Old Bay, followed suggestion from A Cook from Dallas and made the sauce, reduced it, marinated the fish, broiled it, and put warm sauce on it to finish. Used Dijon and a Riesling, which may not be what one would customarily use, but the combination was very pleasing, we gave it four forks.

I used a honey chipotle mustard for the final glaze. Some of the mustard slid down into the pan and combined with the juices for a spectacular sauce.

Because of a fish allergy (only when the system is stressed) I have shyed away from learning about fish the way I have with other items. This is a fool-proof, easy recipe that is very tasty. Use a cheap brown mustard, not to powerful in taste. It could easily over power the fish. Also, don't use too much glaze so the fish comes through. I think I will try this glaze with pork and maybe shrimp wrapped with bacon for an appetizer.

OH MY WORD!!!! The taste is indescribable and wonderful. This is the best salmon I've ever tasted. Now remember, I was pretty scared of salmon prior to this recipe. I just didn't think I could do salmon justice. But this was easy and tasty. I would definitely make this again. DEFINITELY!!!!!

I really enjoyed this. Very similar to Weber's "Simple Salmon". Easy to make and delicious. Only issue is it was very buttery-which was delicious but not the healthiest topping for fish! We will make this again for sure!

Made this with a very large fillet for a dinner party. Everyone loved it and asked the recipe. Used a gritty, seedy mustard. Garnished the platter with small roasted grape tomatoes that were great with the rest of the meal - rice pilaf, salad, roasted veggies. I will make this again and again. A new easy go-to recipe. Big flavor with little effort.

Served this salmon to my family. They loved it, I loved the simplicity of the recipe. It had the richness of a substantial meal. Only change I made was substituting "dry adobo" for the Old bay and cutting the glaze recipe in half. I was able to make the salmon while chatting and having appetizers. So easy! Served on a bed of roasted vegetables. Great presentation.

This was the best salmon I've ever had. The mustard added a very nice dimension to the flavors. It was simple, but fantastic. I paired it with an acorn squash with butter/brown sugar, and a wild rice mix. Oh- I didn't have Old Bay, but I created my own the best I could. It is only a small part of the recipe, so you can easily make something that will work. (Celery salt, red and black pepper, mustard seed, ginger, paprika and ground up bay leaf. The recipe only calls for a teaspoon of the finished product.)

I made this for a girlfriend who attended Cordon Bleu, so spruced it up a bit. I deleted the Old Bay (didn't have it) and added fresh squeezed OJ and pulp and sliced fennel bulb, plus chopped fronds. I also used olive oil instead of butter b/c one diner has a dairy allergy. Next time I'd probably reduce the brown sugar a bit. Will definitely make it again, as it was tasty and easy.

Quick & Easy - Yes.... Good - No. I read all the reviews and was hopeful. I followed the recipe exactly (except added capers from intro) but it turned out to be a waste of good fish - my whole family barely ate it. 14 mins in the oven was way too long and I had thick fillets. The sugar/mustard made much more than needed and I ended up throwing most if it away. Adding pepper was the only thing that made it edible in the end.

YUM! I didn't have any Old Bay or Spicy mustard so here's what I did: I added a dash each of allspice, oregano, ginger, cinnamon and herbs de provence. I used regular yellow mustard and it came out great. This was the best tasting salmon I've ever had, and the tastiest dinner I've had all month. Thank you Selma!

Every single time I make this it's a huge hit. The key is the high-quality mustard and the sugar - they go so well together with the salmon. Suppose this is an exceptional way of making salmon at least in Finland; my guests always say they would have never thought of this combination, but it rocks! I sometimes don't add the wine but serve it with the food instead and it still turns out fabulous. I rub in some olive oil, salt and pepper on the salmon and add potato slices with garlic on the baking sheet, so they soak in the flavours. Other similar salmon recipe I often make (with equal praises) has brown sugar, dill, paprika and fennel.

Don't let the Salmon purists keep you from trying this! I live in Alaska and after a summer of catching and freezing fish for the cold winter change can be good. Sure, Copper River Salmon left to exude greatness with little seasoning and beautiful flavor is amazing but... Something new is fun too. My fillets were pretty thick which may have saved me from losing too much flavor. I served it over polenta with sweet garlic. Yum, though I would have baked it a minute or two less. Cheers!

I thought the mustard and brown sugar glaze overpowered the salmon. There are too many other great salmon recipes out there to repeat this one. And, for the reviewer that thought the recipe called for "old bay leaves" you need to re-read the recipe; it calls for Old Bay Seasoning.

my name is joe, i am a sous chef at brasserie margaux in seattle. I actually created the glaze in a saute pan and then spooned it over a seared copper river salmon fillet. to be honest it just tasted like honey mustard to me. however, i ran it as a special, served over "melted leeks" and it sold well. i guess im just more of a purest, i think the fish should stand on its own without help, but again it sold well enough for me to write it down in my book. overall it worked well

This is so simple and quick to prepare and VERY tasty. We didn't have brown mustard so we substituted dijon and that worked fine. We also used the cayenne, pepper flake, salt and pepper combo instead of old bay leaves. The wine sauce over the rice was simply delicious and the salmon was completely tender and perfectly cooked. Go easy on the sauce at the end and you are in for a treat.

Tried it the first time as the recipe states; thought it was good, but the sauce was overpowering. The second time, we simply make the brown sugar and mustard sauce (adding a dash of vinegar to reduce the mustard content), but made just enough to barely glaze the salmon. Then salt and peppered it before placing it on the grill. The glaze has become our standard - either oven grilled or on the bbq! Excellent every time.

Just made it. It was one of those..."hmmm...what should we have for dinner?" last minute recipes. I started the prep work so I'd have it all ready at the same time, and wound up having dinner completed (unintentionally it was so easy) from start to finish I had dinner on the table in 30 minutes (including sides). It was absolutely delicious. I did add my own extra touches like tarragon & herb de provencal, but I'm sure it would be just as yummy w/ or without my additions. I took the left overs & made a salmon spread for sandwhiches tomorrow (just add a few dollops of may, some horse radish, and finely chopped shallots & green onions & mix well. The consistansy is so creamy, it's almost like a salmon mouse or pate`)& it's just amazingly delicious. I totally recomend this, because even my hubby could cook this dish.

Followed the recipe exactly and was looking forward to a foolproof meal after reading all the great reviews. All I can say is that if they served salmon alongside hotdogs at the ballpark, this is what it would taste like! The mustard (Guldens) was overpowering. Tried it cold the next day, but still horrible. Ended up wiping off the mustard/sugar topping just to salvage an expensive piece of fish.

Also, this is not the best dish if you're on a low fat/low sugar diet.
