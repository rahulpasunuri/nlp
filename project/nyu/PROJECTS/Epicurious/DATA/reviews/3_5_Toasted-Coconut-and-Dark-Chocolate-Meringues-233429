After reading the other reviews, I cut the sugar to 2/3 cups. I used Valrhona semisweet chocolate and thought the sweetness was just about right, but some might find it a bit too sweet. If using a sweeter chocolate I would definitely cut back on sugar. I used a baking-grind unsweetened coconut (because it's what I had on hand) which made them slightly gritty -- next time I'll use the flakes. You do have to watch very carefully to make sure the coconut doesn't burn while toasting and to make sure the cookies don't burn (might lower temp myself next time, like other reviewer said), but recipe is right on target with 1" spread -- the cookies don't flatten out at all, so go ahead and crowd 'em in. Big hit at NY Eve party and would be great for gift bags, too.

I baked these for the cast of a play on opening night, for small gifts at Christmas for my neighbors and at the request of our favorite Italian restaurant around the corner. Everyone asks for the recipe and everyone loves 'em. I've only changed two things -- I've upped the amount of chocolate by 1/2 (yes, half), and used about a 1/4 more coconut. I've made them without the chocolate for kosher friends, too. Just a fine little cookie.

These were great meringues, light and crisp. I did make the following changes: I was unable to find unsweetened coconut and used the sweetened variety. I used slightly less than half the sugar, and used vanilla sugar, since I'd put some up a few months before. I also used a very good quality 86% cacao dark chocolate.

Made these as a special treat for myself, after spending the day making baked goods for a party. Easy and wonderful with an espresso. Cut sugar by half with good results. They did brown at 275 degrees. Would reduce heat next time and cook for a little longer than indicated in the recipe.

I've made these a few times now & each time theyve been really great. One of the times I substituted 1/2 splenda for sugar and another time I used some cocoa powder instead of the chocolate chunks, both turned out great!

Delicious! I had only sweetened coconut on hand, so I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and they were great.

These are WONDERFUL! After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was perfect..Also, I combined (1/2 and 1/2) bittersweet and semisweet chocolate. Easy, fast and delicious - a keeper.

Wow, I'm surprised this recipe got such high marks...I was so disappointed! These are WAAAAAY too sweet. I mean REALLY sweet. The sugar completely overpowers the coconut and dark chocolate flavors. I love coconut and dark chocolate, so I will make another attempt at this recipe, only I will cut the sugar to somewhere between 1/4 - 1/2 cup.

These cookies were so good! I was looking for something a little more like a macaroon, which these were definitely not- very much meringues- but they were a happy surprise. I'm not a meringue lover, but I really liked these!

I made these cookies for a party I catered. Instead of chocolate, I added 1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds. I dipped the bottoms & drizzled the tops of the cooled cookies with bittersweet chocolate. Easy, elegant & delicious! What more can you ask?

After the rave reviews I had to try this out even though I did not have white sugar on hand. Substituted with brown sugar and it tasted good, albeit a little too sweet for my liking. Will probably reduce to 2/3 cups the next time round.

Perfectly lovely. Elicited moans of joy from co-workers. Will make again.

Actually, I might NOT make them again because I have NO DISCIPLINE and eat too many. Nothing this simple can possibly be this good but voila!

What a great recipe! Easy to make and a great presentation. I took this to a family party (tough critics and not big sweets eaters) and got rave reviews. And these are sweet!

We eat a lot of meringues in my family, so I consider us to be somewhat selective, and we loved these cookies! I followed recipe precisely. Fabulous! Will make them again! Served at New Year's Eve dinner with Maple Mousse With Mixed Berry Compote.

I made these for New Year's Eve. They were fantastic and very easy! I did drizzle melted chocolate on them. I also used sweetened coconut, as that was all I could find, however I used less sugar and all was well. I doubled the recipe and made them larger. For a doubled recipe, I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I will definitely make this again. My husband, who bakes, joked that I had showed him up.

I loved making these - they were as easy as can be and the result was a sweet, light, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth cookie. I didn't add the extra drizzle of chocolate, but I think I'd like to try that extra chocolatey taste the next time.

A lovely cookie, and easy to make.

A yummy chocolate macaroon...easy and enjoyable

Funny, as I was editing my note, a cook from Israel made the same point that I would like to . . . Isn't this section for rating the recipe after you taste it? I would much rather hear people's opinions after they have actually tried the recipe then read about their close-minded complaints. A bit snooty, wouldn't you say? By the way, coconut is actually quite good for you. The medium chain fatty acids are the best fats you can eat. You digest them much better and faster than other fats.

After seeing the rating and reading the reviews I realized that the rating posted today (two forks/ 25% make again) gives no indication whatsoever about the sucess of this particular recipe. So to even things out, I'm giving a rating of four forks, EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T MADE THEM. Lighten up people!! If you are looking for lowfat recipes and find yourself shocked by coconut meringues you shouldn't be looking at desserts. You are unlikely to find a lower fat cookie than meringues. If the coconut bothers you, don't make the cookies. But please, please, don't ruin the rating system for people who are interested in finding out whether a recipe works or not.

I've made many variations on this meringue cookie. Substitute dried cranberries (any flavour) for the coconut and, voila!, no cholesterol! Enjoy!

Rating: 0
I agree with the cook from Brazil - cooking at this time of year should be fun - not for the fat-conscious. Besides, the entire recipe calls for 1/2 cup of coconut. I can't imagine anyone sitting down and eating the entire batch of cookies in one go, although I suppose it's certainly possible. I know I couldn't. All things in moderation. Food is my only vice - I get so tired of people trying to spoil the enjoyment of it. That said, maybe I'll make these cookies and let my body convert them however it wants! January is right around the corner with the diet gurus and home-keeping experts hot on its heels. That is enough to make one eat an entire batch of cookies in one go!

Are we talking about a meringue or a medicine that we count cholesterol, saturated fat etc? Food is fun, not a medicine.

Rating: 0
Umm, no cholesterol, but 1/2 cup of shredded coconut has ~13 grams of saturated fat . . . which is converted to cholesterol in the body. But why eat cookies if you are concerned about these things?

Made these cookies on the fly for a neighborhood meeting. BIG hit! I've been asked to send on the recipe. Just like the mag says-fast, easy, and delicious. I'll probably incorporate this recipe into my regular holiday repertoire. Added bonus-no cholesterol.
