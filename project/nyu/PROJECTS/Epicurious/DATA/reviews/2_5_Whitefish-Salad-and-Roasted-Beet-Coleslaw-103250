While the whitefish is nice, you can serve the beet salad with gefilte fish, too (less effort, and it still makes a nice presentation). Add extra horseradish to the beet salad for extra punch. Yummy! I made this to bring a long to a seder three years ago, and they've asked me to bring it back every year since.

White fish salad was uneventful. Beet salad was odd. They certainly do not belong together.
