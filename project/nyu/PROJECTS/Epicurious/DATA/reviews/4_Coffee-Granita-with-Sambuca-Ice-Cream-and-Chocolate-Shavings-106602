This is one of the easiest desserts you can make, with just a few simple ingredients. And it is delightful. All of my guests loved it. It's a great end to a big meal when you don't have that much room for dessert. It's light, yet so tasty. I thought the Sambuca in the whipped cream might be too much, but it was perfect. I serve it in martini glasses, put an extra dollop of whipped cream on top with lots of chocolate shavings. Makes for a great presentation. This is one is a keeper.

We made brought this dessert to our neighbors one night and I thought I made enough...it was GONE I tell you! Everyone loved it, even the kids. This is a keeper...

Absolutely wonderful - a great mix of tastes and textures, each mouthful is a new surprise. The whipped cream on the bottom encourages you to pull it up through the coffee-flavored ice. The hint of sambuca is perfect with the other flavors.

This has been a delightfully cool dessert for this very steamy summer. I've substituted some light Cool Whip for the heavy cream and use Sambuca only for company dinners. I use the plain cool whip when I make it for myself. It's just as good.
