This was yummy and easy! I used organic plain Greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche, used seasoned wine vinegar, half a red onion, and a handful of dandelions with a squirt of basil paste, instead of listed herbs. Added herb & olive oil marinated mini mozzarella and grilled Tofurkey on top. It was great - will make again!

This was a great weeknight meal. My mods: Swapped creme fraiche for one whole single-serve container greek yogurt Used the same amount of dressing with about 3/4 pound of pasta Ample fresh herbs Used romas (cheaper) and broiled them with salt and olive oil while the pasta was cooking and I was prepping, roughly 20 minutes The sweetness of the broiled tomatoes really added, and I am glad that I had ample dressing to fully coat the pasta. Could also be made with quinoa or the like. It was simple and fresh and very tasty.

I only gave this recipe two forks because it was good but nothing all that special. I've grown accustomed to cooking really great recipes that I find on Epicurious and this just wasn't a home-run. I also found the sauce a little runny and didn't stick to the pasta very well. I will say, though, that the flavours are very good and this is a nice, light, fresh-tasting pasta best served in spring or summer.

Wonderfully fresh! You really can't go wrong with this recipe. Just be sure not to overcook the pasta and I would increase the ratio of tomatoes to pasta.

I thought this was quite good, and a ncie showcase for ripe heirlooms. I subbed greek yogurt for the creme fraiche, the only fresh herb I had was basil, and I added a little fresh mozarella. Yum.

This recipe was a little on the bland side. I used heirloom tomatoes too and followed the recipe exactly. It was just okay in my opinion. Won't be going in my recipe box.

This is a great, easy summer salad. Made it for an outdoor buffet for 10 people and everyone loved it. I mixed up a bunch of herbs that were available at the market and also included one they called verugula which gave it a little bite.

I love to make this for a light, easy summer meal. Fresh, ultra-ripe heirloom tomatoes are the key to this dish. I double the dressing and add sauteed bay scallops as a protein to make this dish more substantial.

I made this for visiting family - who are very selective with their food. I used sour cream instead of creme frais - wonderful ! There were no leftovers !

This was a really fresh (fraiche?) dish, which is very versatile and would work with many different mains as a side course. Got to go with those heirlooms, though -- it would be pretty ordinary with regular tomatoes.

This is wonderful! Taking advice from other reviewers, I added more basil and fresh buffalo mozzarella. Would definitely add this to my "go to" list of fast, easy and delicious weeknight dinners!

Very light and fresh, enjoyed by the whole family. Used roma tomatoes (heirloom were just too expensive), basil and sour cream; the flavor was nice.

Perfect late-summer recipe, especially if you're lucky enough to have an herb garden. We used thick curly semolina dried pasta from Italy we found at the local farm market. The second time, we went heavy on the basil - good idea. Also used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, which worked out fine.

I am heading to farmers market to get the last of the heirloom tom. Was looking for a new recipe that would be easy, and add a new twist. I will take readers advice and also use some fresh mozzarella. Yummmm

Used whole wheat pasta. Needed to double the amount of sauce, otherwise the pasta was dry. Would also increase the amount of fresh spices to a cup or cup and a quarter. My husband also felt that sprinkled grated cheese would be a good addition.

Can you just imagine how good this would be with some fresh mozzarella cheese and some roasted garlic! Yum! Heirloom tomatoes are SOO sweet!
