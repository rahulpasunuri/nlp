I made two complete rolls and lay them on a platter and garnished with dollops of whipped creme and strawberries for an adult's birthday. Everyone raved at the texture and combination of flavours--it was a HUGE hit. the only thing i found frustrating was that the rhubarb did not set up as i expected and had to use much less than the recipe implied or it would have been messy, but it did not feel, and certainly did not taste, like anything was missing. Everyone thought it was a great way to utilize the spring rhubarb

My whole family & I loved this tasty recipe, it impressed in presentation & flavor combo. I did use some strawberries in place of some of the rhubarb (due to my rhubarb plant not producing a pound it's first year:)

Looks like I'm going against the grain here, but I didn't really care for this. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday (he loves both lemons and rhubarb) and I wish I had invested my time in something else. I thought that the lemon cake part had a weird texture -- not at all what I was expecting (I was expecting something like the texture of the cake in a swiss roll or a jelly roll). This was more rubbery, and not very cake-like in texture. The filling was okay, nothing spectacular. Think next time I'll just make a lemon pound cake and some curd.

The filling was delicious, but I went against my better judgement and took the cake out of the oven after about 10 minutes. It wasn't even close to done. Wish I'd read the reviews more carefully. I'll definitely try it again.

I really liked this recipe - an interesting way to present rhubarb.

this was wonderful....I used strawberry confit rather then the Rhubarb filling which looked to be more trouble then it was worth. Wow!!! Quick and easy I baked the cake for about 12 mins. Very very good

I have made this cake (not the semifreddo) twice -it is a real family favourite. My cake always sticks to the tea towell and the icing sugar clumps but it doesn't matter when the roll is assembled. Very delicious!

THIS WAS SERVED AT OUR MONTHLY GOURMET DINNER. EVERYONE WAS QUITE IMPRESSED WITH THE VISUAL PRESENTATION AND ALSO THE COMBINATION OF FLAVORS. SERVED WITH SEMI-FREDDO. VERY TIME CONSUMING TO PREPARE BOTH BUT WORTH IT FOR A APPRECIATIVE GROUP.

The time to cook the cake layer was an obvious error: took 16 minutes, not 6. Served it with raspberry coulis and french vanilla ice cream, not the semifreddo. Using a bit less filling would make it easier to get the roll visually attractive. It tasted delicious, however.
