This tasted good this morning on a cold, winters day. Here's what I did and I liked it just as much: I didn't have pepperoni, but I had breakfast sausages, so I sliced about six. I cooked all the veggies with the sausage just as described, but I cooked my scrambled eggs in a different pan. Then I served the two dishes side by side. Delicious, yes, and also a bit greasy (thanks to the sausage)..but, we splurged this morning!

This was great and very healthy. I used two kinds of bell peppers and some zucchini (which was wonderful) and some chicken sausage and subbed an italian spice blend and some fresh oregano for the marjoram. Just a warning, though, if you want lots of eggs, rather than some eggs around the sauteed veggies, up the number of eggs. I halved the recipe and all the ingredients and had a great brunch, but the eggs were mainly just a faint layer of glue between the veggies. Also, I served it with warm bread and the fig seseme preserves (on this site) and thought they were great together. Definitely a keeper that I'll probably change over time.

This was a hit with our guests. Did all the prep work a day ahead to make breakfast faster and easier. Will do it again.

Great egg recipe! I was afraid there'd be too much going on in this dish, but surprisingly it came together in a pretty cohesive and not too aggressive way.

Good. Colorful.

A wonderful Brunch recipe! When summer zucchini are plentiful, we use chunks of baby zucchini "in addition to" or "instead of" the peppers for this recipe! Recently we used fresh tarragon instead of marjoram - we really liked the flavor it added to the eggs!

Sure, it's simple... but it's a great recipe. I've found that this works well as the basis for a quick, nutritious, satisfying meal for those of us who are exhausted after work! I just keep chopped bell peppers or other vegetables in the freezer, and then I can whip up a healthy meal in a few minutes. One suggestion: another recipe for eggs on this website suggest putting a little cream cheese in the eggs... keeps them from drying out, and adds a nice flavor. Also, there is a company out there with freezedried vegetables (JustFruit/JustVeggies?) that has carrots, onions, etc., you can add to also keep this quick and visually appealing. And there are so many possible variations with cheese/herbs/spices/veggies. I personally like Brie/herbes de Provence/zucchini, or cumin & jalapeno peppers, or basil/cheddar/onions.

It's amazing how these few additions can make regular scrambled eggs taste so spectacular. A great dish for a brunch.

Wonderfully flavorful. I made this recipe as a frittata which worked well. My spouse loved the taste but wanted a better color from the eggs . The next time I make this dish I will use 4 eggs and 2 egg yolks for a half recipe to brighten up the presentation.
