As others suggested I toasted the fennel seeds, used a morter and pestle to grind them, toasted a bit more and then ground a bit more and soaked in a little olive oil. No gritty texture so it must have worked! Nice flavors and pretty easy after the grinding. Some sliced cucumbers were a nice fresh touch as a salad with the fish.

Great flavor - really complements the fish well. I toasted the fennel seeds, put them in wax paper and smashed them very fine, retoasted and added a teaspoon of olive oil to soften before adding the mayo - this greatly enhanced the texture. My girlfriend luckily reminded me we had fresh fennel in the fridge - I sliced the bulb fairly thin in strips, added a touch of olive oil, and added around the fish to roast and garnished with some minced fennel fronds. This is a keeper for bluefish!

Very good, but the fennel mayo was too grainy, even with fine grinding with a mortar and pestle and letting the mayo mix sit for an hour or so.

Very, very nice. The fennel mayonnaise lends a nice flavor, and diminishes the oily flavor of the bluefish. The sauce brightens wondefully with a squeeze of fresh lemon on the plate. In an effort to avoid heating and fishinating (?) the kitchen air, I cooked my fresh fillets in non-stick aluminum foil for twenty minutes over indirect, medium heat on the grill. Nice texture and great flavor. My only suggestion would be to grind the toasted fennel seeds well in the mortar & pestle, as they were a little too grainy in the mayonnaise. Four forks!

This is a wonderful recipe for a variety of reasons. It's fast and easy (always a plus)low cost, and as simple as it is, it even looks good, or at least impressive, when it comes out of the broiler. Because bluefish is so oily, it's very forgiving when it comes to overcooking, so it's hard to mess up on this one.

We used this on spanish mackerel and rockfish fillets with excellent results. The fish looked as good as they tasted. The chopped fennel seeds were still crunchy when mixed with mayo and other ingredients. Really didn't like the texture. After broiling the fish, however, they softened up nicely. This one's a keeper.

if you've ever had doubts about bluefish, this recipe will change your mind. Bluefish, because of it's high oil content is one of the healthiest fish (Omega 3's) and this recipe rocks! Simple and simply delish!

Terrific recipe for a fish we love anyway! Used the recipe as written, have made it several times. In general, about bluefish: If you don't like the "fishy" taste, remove the central dark-red vein, using a short sharp knife, before cooking. Other simple bluefish recipes: brush with sesame oil, then broil until almost done, sprinkle with 1/2"-cut scallions and soy or teriyaki sauce and broil 2 more minutes; OR steam and chill, then serve with a mixture of 50/50 mayonnaise and Nance's Honey Mustard.

This one is great. We really enjoy cooking mackerel so if you do too, this is one to try. I think you could also just broil the mackerel (whole) with olive oil and lemon and serve the fennel mayonnaise on the side, but that's just a preference thing (and an availability thing - it seems where we are that whole mackerel are much easier to come by...)

How could you improve on perfection? I've also seen a similar recipe using fresh dill.

For years I had only 1 recipe for cooking bluefish: Top fish w/1000 island or French dressing, Progresso crumbs and lemon slices. For a change I decided to try this one. It was really great. Everyone is right: there is no fishy taste! This is simple, inexpensive and delicious. My suggestion is to make double sauce so it has a heavy coating. If anyone is doubting that bluefish can be tasty, please try this first. You will be surprised.

Made it for the second time tonight. Very good both times.

The sauce is very good - perfect for masking the 'fishiness' of Bluefish. However, do NOT double the amount of salt if you are doubling the recipe. It's much too much. Even for a person like me who 'doesn't like bluefish' this is an excellent way to prepare it!

This is an excellent recipe for Bluefish - and I'm one of those people who 'don't like bluefish'. Roasting the fennel seeds is a must - and it makes the kitchen smell yummy, too. The sauce can be made hours ahead of time and kept in the 'frige.

I didn't have the fennel seeds so I added 1/2 tablespoon of fennel rub to lemon juice and mayo. The bluefish tasted great - not overwhelmingly fishy.

Made a single fillet (almost 1 inch thick) and found the recipe scaled down really well. IN spite of other reviews, I believe the amount of mayo is correct. And, don't forget the toasting of the fennel seed, it's wonderful!

The sauce is what made this meal. I have never made bluefish and when I came home with it my boyfriend said bluefish is a terrible fishy fish. Needless to say he cleaned his plate. I am looking forward to trying this sauce on other things - maybe chicken. Careful with the lemon juice, dont use to much. The toasted fennel was a wonderful touch.

Very good. The fennel mayonnaise browns very quickly - I was worried it would burn before the fish cooked through, but it was fine.

This was an extremely easy recipe. What made it especially great was that I already had all of the ingredients on hand! The only thing was that I didn't end up using all of the fennel mayo ~ it just seemed a little much. I loved the smell of the fennel as it was cooking though ~ delicious! (my fiance loved it too!)

Delicious. I have a neighbor who keeps me supplied with bluefish, so I will definitely use this again.

This dish was terrific. The taste was wonderful and it was very easy to prepare. The fennel mayonnaise, which can be made ahead, really makes the dish. The added beauty of the mayo is that it can also be used with sandwiches such as roast beef. I am even thinking of trying it in a chicken or pasta salad.

This is the best bluefish recipe I ever tried. Have made it three times so far this summer, with fish caught a mere two hours before cooking. I thought it might be good grilled because it was so good broiled, but the fish should be broiled, not grilled. I also tried lime juice instead of lemon juice, and that worked.

A neighbor brought over some freshly caught blues. This is an easy, tasty way to prepare them. We used the grill so had no broiler to clean. Try it.

My husband and I caught a lot of bluefish. He was trying to give them all away because he hates them. I made this recipe and he LOVED it! He ate every bit. I used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo and added extra lemon, this gave it a zingy, tangy taste. This is the only recipe I plan to ever use!

This was quick and easy. An added benefit: the aroma while toasting the fennel -- my wife and son got a kick out of that. To combine the mayo ingredients I used a plunger-type chopper. You don't have to broil. I used my gas grill, placed the fillets in a shallow pan on the top shelf, and cooked a bit longer than suggested. Yum!

Nice recipe. The fennel is a good spice for fish and was well used in this particular recipe. I doubled or tripled the amount of lemon juice for better results. Very simple preparation that yields good results.

I used about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. The fish was excellent and very moist.

In the late summer, bluefishing is one of the most pleasurable of outings. Unfortunately, the result is a lot of bluefish fillets. I cooked this up in relatively no time and it was very good. I would probably kick up the lemon and cracked pepper in the mayo topping next time, however. But not bad as is.
