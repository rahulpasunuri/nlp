We don't eat pork, so I sauteed an organic sweet Italian-style chicken sausage (3 oz) with the fennel. Also added 2 more cups of chicken broth and only about a 1/2 c of turkey gravy. My husband only eats black beans, so substituted those. Used a 15-oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained, in place of the cherry tomatoes. No more basil in the garden, so used dried. A terrific use of Thanksgiving leftovers. And the smell of fennel and sausage sauteed in the pan is worth the recipe all by itself!

I was looking for a way to use lefteover ham and turkey lunchmeat and this recipe came up in my search for some reason. I was actually surprised that even my 4 year old and picky husband enjoyed it with a few modifications. I substituted imported deli ham for the pancetta and a can of turkey gravy for the fresh turkey gravey. I also added about a third of a box (cooked aldente) of mini bow tie pasta and cut down on the red pepper durring cooking but added additional to my husband's and my bowls. This was my first time cooking with fennel bulb and loved it!! It was actually very mild once cooked and took on much of the flavors in the soup. I also ended up cooking this for about a half hour total but it was extrememly easy to prepare as you go. I would make this again but would add not for my original purpose as the lunchmeat had no flavor remaining and was slighlty chewy. I will try next time to add cooked chicken or leftover ham pork or turkey any would work!

So after reading the reviews here is what I did. First, I did not substitute anything. The pancetta is essential. Second, I did cut back the gravy and tasted it before and after. Without the gravy, the seasoning was off and it was thin. So, I added about 1/3 of the gravy called for in the recipe. Result - perfection. Third, I did add cropped flat leaf parsley and dried basil instead of the fresh basil. My husband who hates beans loves it. I like it too. We will make it again along with some traditional turkey soup with the leftovers, but he says he will actually eat this.

I made several modifications and ended up really enjoying this: I roasted the tomatoes, then pureed them, before adding them to the soup. I eliminated the gravy altogether. I shredded the turkey meat. I added some red wine. I didn't have pancetta so I used bacon. It was a big hit with the family!

Not super wild about this one. Good way to use left overs but couldn't eat it more than once. I didn't have fennel so I use 1/2 of an onion and 2 celery stalks and a pinch of fennel seed. I also didn't have pancetta so I just omitted it. I use two tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes and it work out just fine. I think the problem with this soup is not that it isn't good, it's just a little weird having a soup taste like Thanksgiving gravy.

I made this dish because it seemed to provide an alternative the usual soups for leftover turkey. I served it to three girlfriends, and two of them asked for the recipe. We all found it to be very fresh-tasting and interesting. I will definitely make this again. NOTE: I had added almost no gravy (had none left over from Thanksgiving). Another reviewer really hated this soup; I wonder if she added the full 1 cup of gravy and that was too much.

This recipe was terrible. I started to regret it as I was making it. When I added the gravy in, it made me feel sick to my stomach. I continued though, having no backup for dinner. Unfortunately, my family concured. My daughters refused to eat it at all after one bite and my husband gave it the thumbs down as well. There are much better soups out there than this one. Don't bother!
