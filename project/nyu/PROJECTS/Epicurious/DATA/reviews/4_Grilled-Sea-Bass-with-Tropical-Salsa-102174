Excellent dish! Easy to make and it's fresh and flavorful. Halibut was in season each time I made it, so I have yet to try it with sea bass. I will definitely make the salsa to accompany other meats, like pork or barbecued chicken. It would also be great with rice.

I made this multiple times, tweaking it each time. sometimes I add honey, orange juicecorn, green or yellow bell pepper. Next time I am going to put in strawberries (Emeril's version using Salmon ) It's always delicious and guest LOVE IT no matter what! I may try it doing Cedar Planked Salmon.

I really enjoy this salsa, I find it also works quite well with either chicken or seafood (but seafood is better) in jerk sauce.

Combined this recipe and the Grilled Snapper and Mango with Cilantro-Lime vinegarette from this site and the result was much better than I think either would have been alone. Be sure to add some mint to the salsa, it really does add something. Would probably add some fresh lime to the fish just before serving as well. I chopped the grilled mango and then combined it with the fresh salsa from this recipe on the plate. Easy, refreshing and attractive!

This is really delicious and easy to make. Chopping all the fruit/ veggies takes a little while, but it's a very easy recipe. I used only 1 tbls of the cilantro and added an extra tbls of jalapeno. I also sprinkled a little garlic powder on the fish before grilling. So good and healthy!

My friends and I really enjoyed this dish, although I had to make it in a rush. Since I didn't have time to chill the salsa, I blended half of it, stirred it back into the chunky salsa, and topped the fish almost immediately. Blending seemed to speed the flavor-mingling process. Even though preparation took several minutes longer than I expected, this salsa is worth it. I'm unsure how long this salsa may be safely refrigerated. Could anyone help out? Thanks!

Awesome and easy and perfect for summer. There will be leftover salsa to use for other dishes, too. I will try this with a less expensive piece of fish next time, though!

I would describe this dish as very pleasant, but not a "wow". I did love the fact that this is a beautifully healthy, low fat meal, pairing fresh fruit salsa with grilled fish. I would have liked a salsa with more pizzazz.

This was a very good recipe. We decided to sear it first with butter and olive oil, then into the oven @350 for about 12 minutes. It was fabulous!! We served it with some amazing wine, Sancerre.

This dish was good, except I exptected it to be a bit fruitier. I would make it again, but with less onion (which is the only ingredient that I mulched in the cuisinart and probably added too much in light of that because I was trying to hide it) and cilantro, as they were both a bit overpowering. Also, I would probably add a bit more jalepeno, as it was almost non-existent. (Maybe the cilantro was fresher than the pepper?) Overall, it was a nice refreshing way to prepare fish, which is always a good find.

De-lish! Makes me wish I was in Hawaii right about now. I used the leftover salsa to top grilled chicken breasts the next day for lunch - still tasty.

This recipe is great. My husband made an excellent suggestion....semi puree 1/2 of the salsa and and then remix it all. This holds the salsa together nicely.

This dish was fantastic. The tropical fruit salsa was amazing and pretty easy to make. I coudn't find any sea bass, so I bought a halibut steak which I grilled. It was cooked to perfection and the salsa was a perfect topping.

Will make this many more times. The salsa is fantastic.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone raved. I used Chilean Sea Bass and served on top of Saffron Rice and Red Pepper Pilaf (found on this web-site). Flavor combination of the salsa was superb.

Made this for my girlfriends and it went over really well... took little effort too since I was able to prepare the salsa beforehand. My husband is not a fan of fish but think he would like this too!

This is a wonderfully light, refreshing dish! I used white sea bass, a Pacific fish which is especially flavorful. I substituted a fresh orange for the pineapple -- which I'll try next time -- and that worked very well. The better and fresher the fish, the better the result! Delicious!

This was a perfect dish for a late evening dinner-light and refreshing! The salsa complemented the grilled fish perfectly.This is a keeper-will try the salsa on grilled chicken next.

In an attempt to improve my cholesterol levels, I've been trying to eat more fish. One problem...I hate fish! But, this grilled sea bass with tropical salsa was awesome! Not fishy at all. And, the salsa is fruity and refreshing and the mint just makes it perfect. This is a "must try" for all non-fish eaters. You'll love it!

This is an excellent dish! We made it twice in one week and used the remaining salsa for the next night over chicken. We served it to guests both nights and they raved!

This is a great tropical salsa recipe, and versatile. We had it with grilled lamb chops, which with the mint matched up very nicely.

Very good. Dinner guests cleaned their plates. Followed one reviewer's lead and baked the fish instead of grilling. Will definitely grill next time.

I was surprised to find i didn't love this recipe. Love sea bass but the mango salsa was just ok. The mango and red onion chutney would be better i suspect. I'll definately try it again.

This is a fabulous dish for entertaining--the salsa makes for a beautiful presentation, as well as being very tasty. I served with a yellow rice pilaf with peas and pinenuts, and it was a meal to linger over.

We grilled both copper river salmon and the sea bass. Salsa was yummy on both! Love the mint in the recipe. Huge succes!

This is a great dish and a real eye pleaser. The 2nd time around I added cashews and shredded coconut and increased the hot peppers and it was fabulous. I served it over rice and garnished with fresh mint and bananas to rave reviews.

I thought that this dish was just wonderful!! The colors were outstanding and the taste, light and fresh. I used rockfish (aka striped bass) in lieu of sea bass and added whatever other fruit looked good in the produce aisle (namely papaya and blood oranges). We will definitely make this again.

Excellent flavors and texture. My only problem was the sea bass cooling off too much to quickly with the salsa coming straight out of the fridge. I would recommend serving the salsa a room temp.

In one word - sublime! A beautiful dish and very company pleasing. I add diced papaya and lime zest to the salsa, also a lot of fresh ground pepper. The mint is a lovely addition - another layer of flavour.

I love this recipe and so do my guests. I chg'd the salsa a bit - skipped the mint and cucumber and replaced the mango with Papaya. I also added a little grilled green onion to it. Served it all on a crispy Potato gallette and it was unbelievable!

I love this recipe! Even my sister who detests fish ate this. (She also liked the salsa with chicken). I cooked the seabass in the oven since I put a layer of apricot jelly on top of the fish. I omitted the jalapeno and the cilantro from the salsa as I do not like these and the salsa was still fantastic. Very easy, very yummy, and very beautiful (especially if you use different colored peppers and tomatoes).

All I can say id oh my.... I made this two times in 4 days!I modified it though...I usually do not like fruit in my food like that. I went to a weeding and the main course was chilean seabass with salsa so I tried this, being that was awesome. My idea was to marinade it one hour in tropical teriyaki sauce...then serve with the salsa... PERFECTION!!!! I was afraid the plain seabass seasoned with just salt and pepper would be lacking...Let me just tell you this was so fantastic I won't even try it. My girfriend freaked..said it tasted like a famous restaurant recipe...(don't remember the name...anyway ..this is a keeper

I have made this salsa several times and it is delicious! I suggest reducing the jalepeno to 2 tsp. The 2 TBS. seemed to overpower the fabulous blend of flavors. I have also used a previous reviewers suggestion to use red pepper flakes and that works well too. It is terrific on sea bass, salmon, and grilled chicken or even straight!

This was a fantastic dish! It's definitely worth it to buy fresh chilean sea bass versus frozen. For the salsa, I left out the pineapple and substituted papaya for the mango and had amazing results.

This was a beautiful presentation. But our fish had the skin on and was very fatty, between the meat and the skin. It was quite unpleasant (nothing to do with the recipe, really). I would suggest not adding the jalepeno. It gave an unneeded flavor, and I love spice. Add red pepper flakes instead.

Once a quarter 4 couples get together for, what we call, our Bon Appetit Gourmet Dinner Club. (The couple hosting the dinner has to prepare the menu from that month's Bon Appetit issue - Sept 1999, The American Century in Food.) This recipe was served as the main entree. It was a wonderfuly delicious, yet easy to make meal. Everyone loved the combination of fruits mixed with the red peppers and cilantro. Great recipe!
