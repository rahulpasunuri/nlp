A standby favourite since 1991. Two slight twists: Pan fry steaks only for a minute on each side, then remove and grill on BBQ. Also, fry some sliced white or shitake mushrooms in the pan before adding cream. Superb!

I have been making this sauce for years- actually have the recipe I cut our of the August 91 Bon Apetit- and have loved it every time! The green peppercorns are key. I have reheated it and it held together pretty well the next day, too.

I cannot believe that I have been searching for this recipe for years and just found it! Forgotten ingredient ... peppercorns. A memorable Christmas Eve dinner in 1993.

I was really excited to make this sauce, thinking it would be like the wonderful pepper-cream sauces that I ate in Europe... and then I made it, and it didn't smell so good, so I served it on the side - thank god, cause it was so disgusting that not only was it unedible, but just the one bite I had mademewant to vomit.

To Maureen from Long Island. If you'll notice, in the recipe it calls for you to "reduce" the sauce after the cream is added. 1/2 C is not very much in the first place, but if you reduce it to sauce consistancy the flavor comes through, it thickens AND REDUCES! I have made this recipe several times and it has been a success everytime. I even tried it with game backstrap or tenderloin and it was just as yummy!

Easily one of the best things my husband and I have ever eaten. This was the first time I've ever set liquor afire, but it was worth standing by with the fire extinguisher! The sauce is to die.

This is a good, basic recipe that you could embellish towards your own tastes. Personally, I tried to cut down the fat and the calories, so I used less brandy and substituted half and half for the cream. To the previous reviewer who found this a waste of beef which didn't let the flavor through, I would advise her of the fact that the tenderloin is a cut that accentuates texture, not flavor, and that if she found anything competing with the flavor of the beef it wouldn't be the dairy, which is pretty neutral. She doesn't seem to know much about cooking. If you want a strong beef flavor, DON'T use a tenderloin- try a hanger steak or some other, more flavorful cut. That being said, she's correct in that the tenderloin has a very subtle flavor, and if you want to bring that out then you should emphasize fresh aromatic herbs or mushrooms or a light glaze or marinade, and keep the stronger ingredients at bay. But for the rest of you, please recognize that the beef tenderloin has traditionally been considered a showcase for an extraordinary sauce, not for the flavor of the cut itself. As a general rule, the more flavorful the cut, the more tough it is, and hence, the more tender the cut, the less flavor it has. This is certainly true for the tenderloin, no matter how heralded it may be.

What a waste of good beef. This does not merit all the rave reviews. Too much cream to allow the flavor of the beef to come through.

We liked this! The sauce was exceptionally good. I served with a mesclun salad with honey dressing... steamed asparagus made a nice side dish & was great with the sauce, too!

I made 10 steaks and tripled all the ingredients. I fogort the line "remove from heat" when adding the brandy, abd when I ignited the two pans of brandfy (with the fan pulling exhaust) I had huge flames flying into the venting microwave. It scared the s$!t out of me until my husband blew out the flames, but the meal was delicious and nothing was ruined (I think?). People loved the meal. I served the "Couscous Risotto w/Shrimp" as a first course and the "Even Greater Ceasar Salad" which was the biggest hit of the night.

Great recipe! I always add a little olive oil when using butter - it keeps the butter from overheating and burning, and yet doesn't take away from the flavor.

Easy to make and very tasty!

I'm sure it would have turned out beautifully except my fire alarm went off before the steak was done. My kitchen was thick with smoke. What did I do wrong? I used a cast iron skillet with the required butter but even with my range turned on, I was smoked out of the kitchen......

This was great. I've had this dish in France and this version was just as good. I added more butter at the end and some whole peppercorns. I also increased the amount of brandy. Yummy!

I made this recipe years ago, when the issue came out. It comes very close to the Steak Au Poive served at Izzy's Steakhouse in San Francisco. Outstanding!
