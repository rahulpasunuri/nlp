We really liked this and my partner commented it was the perfect summer snack/appetizer. It was pretty, easy and quick to make. I cut the recipe down since there are only 2 of us and it was great. Made in mousse molds -- square ones & triangles -- to serve as individual portions. Worked great for lunch too. I did add a dash of hot sauce to make the flavor wake-up. A very elegant and different dish that will transport well to summer parties--simply keepit in the mousse mold until you get there.

This dish was simple to prepare, especially given that it is a visual stunner. I think it makes a great dish for a party because it is easy, can be prepared in advance, is elegant and will serve many people. Flavor-wise, I thought it was fine. I actually prefer nice smoked salmon without much embellishment. But it is a great party dish.

Yuk, and I cant think of a thing that would make this any more palatable to me. This is the lowest rating I have ever given a recipe. Dont know if I did something wrong or the consistency just wasnt my cup of tea. Hubby didnt care for it either.

I've been making this for about 3 years, it has become a holiday staple. I don't bother to soak the onions and usually stir in about a half of a jar of rinsed capers.

I served this at a party recently and it was a great hit. The only complaint I got from someone is that they were expecting mayonnaise rather than sour cream when the initially tried it. One strange thing. This is a "mousse" but it was actually chunky, I didn't read anywhere to process it. As a mousse I was expecting something smooth, so perhaps the preparation is missing one step. I served it by scooping it into filo dough cups, for easy eating. The rest I will process and pipe into pastry and try warm.

This recipe got RAVE reviews at my Thanksgiving get-together. The flavor was perfect; the cucumber and dill really add something unique. One note - for those not used to using gelatin, it takes a little while for the gelatin to dissolve - be patient, you didn't mess up!!

My foodie guests were all very pleased with this dish. I didn't try this, but wonder if plain yogurt might be used in combination with the sour cream?

I didn't have any fresh dill on hand, so I substituted cilantro instead--great flavor!

Fabulous, perfect for our annual large, dressy holiday party. Looks dramatic, tastes great, serves a lot of people, easy, do-ahead preparation. Using really good quality smoked salmon is critical, since the top layer is pure smoked salmon. The gelatin is undetectable (which is good!), wouldn't know it was there from the taste or consistency, just helps it hold the shape.

Took time to chop everything. Used more spices.Everyone enjoyed it.

Use less sour cream than recipe calls for and add as needed. Also, use more smoked salmon for a stronger flavor
