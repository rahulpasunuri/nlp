Exceptionally easy. Nice crust, good texture and chewiness, but a bit too salty. Definitely worth trying again.

Have made this bread several times and have figured out bread comes out better if 1 Tbsp of sugar is added to the recipe. Also, the pan with water is not necessary - it makes the bread too dry.

Loved the recipe, but the dough needed to rise slightly a tad more on "first" rise (used my kitchen aid). When preparing the dough after the first rise I added cheddar cheese & Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese w/basil when folding the dough before baking. Came out fabulous!. Loved the way it was soft in the middle & had a slight crust on the outside. To me it seemed more like a focaccia type bread, but the end result, "delicious!". Will absolutley do again & again try different "herbs/cheeses", etc... to add. A definite loveable & yummy recipe! "grazia".

I have made this bread several times. It is so easy. I love just letting it sit in my food processor and rise!! I have found that baking the bread at 430 for 15-17 minutes is perfect.

I made the French bread for the first time tonight. I forgot to use boiling water in the 1 " of water, so it took forever for the oven to come to temperature (450 degrees). The finished product was delicious, though a bit crispy. Next time, I will cook it less than 30 plus minutes. I also used an egg white glaze (unnecessary). Proofed (second rising) for about 45 min., instead of 30 minutes. Good easy recipe. Will use the second loaf for overnight french toast (layer of apples and brown sugar syrup under it). Yum! Thanks for the nice, easy recipe.

First time I tried this.....easy and worked great. Didn't have long bread pans, used a reg loaf pan. Came out fine. I will use this again.

This was super easy and super delicious! I didn't have the french bread pan so I coated it in olive oil and cooked it on a cooking sheet after letting it rise twice. My first time making french bread and it will not be my last!

I should have just ate flour straight from the bag. Not good. The crust was nice and thick, cruchy, but the taste was totally flat. Other breads on here are much, much better. I can not for the life of me understand how this has good ratings???

Wonderful!! I made this recipe for the first time today, and the family LOVED it!! It's crusty exterior, and the interior is soft and tender. I baked followed other recommendations and did a double rise. I missed the recommendation that the baking time be reduce, and in my electric oven that would have been a good idea as the top was pretty dark by the time it was baked the second time, but the bottom was PERFECT. No complaints. Love this recipe, and will make it over and over again. Oh... and my 7 cup food processor is almost not big enough. I almost had bread dough everywhere, so if that's your size, watch carefully! :-)

I did not have white vinegar and dared not use red wine vinegar for fear of a pink baguette. Still came out good.

This is the easiest and tastiest French Bread I have ever had. My husband likes a "crustier" bread and I like mine "doughier." This makes us both happy!! Just enough of both! I found the recipe about 2 months ago and I've made it 6 or 7 times. Every guest who's had a piece has been impressed!

Excellent bread and easy. I made mine the old-fashioned way with hand kneading. Do add the vinegar because this will help the bread to rise.

Rating: 4
This is truly an amazing recipe. I have been exposed to european baking my whole life and I was skeptical this would come out right--crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside. This was my first time making bread at home and it was a total success! I baked the bread in a perforated double loaf bread baking pan so I reduced the oven temperature by 25 degrees. Also, I don't have a food processor so I did everything in my stand mixer (even the rising), using the right attachment, and it worked just fine!

Rating: 4
This is a nice, easy recipe that I'll definitely make again. Good chewy crumb and the second baguette was great the next day. Per others' suggestions, I reduced the first baking time from 30 minutes to ~20, and it turned out perfectly. I also used a french loaf pan, but lined it with parchment paper out of fear that the gooey dough would seep through the holes while rising.

Rating: 4
It's easier to clean the bowl of the Kitchenaid mixer, so I first made this recipe with the dough hook. You wind up having to add more flour than the recipe calls for, and the bread turns out too dense. I then decided to follow the recipe exactly and make it in the cuisinart. Perfection, and it really couldn't be any easier.

Great results for very little effort. Like others, I added a second rise. I have made better homemade french bread (the Bread Bible recipe), but this turned out good results in about 1/4 of the time.

Solid recipe, works lovely.

I've made and reviewed this already, but wanted to add a note about food processor sizes. I have a 7 cup processor and it is more than big enough for the rising- no need for a bigger machine, or to let the dough rise elsewhere. I do two rises.

I'm writing my third review on this bread. I love it! Changes to recipe - two rises, add about a tsp. of gluten per loaf. I make it in a heavy duty mixer with dough hook, letting it rise in the bowl. It is big enough to do six loaves at a time and I'm selling them at the Farmers Market where I have a booth. I add rosemary and lavender to some of the loaves, top with more herbs and some sea salt. It is gone in a flash every time I bring it in. A guy at the market who sells bread commented on what good looking loaves they are. I'll have to give him a loaf and see what he says about texture and taste. If there is a better recipe out there, let me know!

This bread was delicious. The crust was nice and crisp and the interior was slightly chewy with a nice open texture. I liked that it only had 2 tsp yeast, so it didn't have the heavy commercial yeasty flavor that some breads get. I mixed and kneaded this with my Kitchen Aid as my processor is only a 7-cup and I was afraid it wouldn't fit. I also added 1 tsp of honey while softening the yeast. I sub'd white wine vinegar for the distilled (didn't have any) and used 1 tbsp of butter instead of the olive oil (was out of that too.) I don't think any of the changes were substantial enough to really make much, if any, flavor difference. The dough was very soft and fairly sticky, not the easiest to work with, but I know a stickier dough makes a lighter bread. I used plenty of bench flour so it worked out well. I made the loaves on a parchment covered cookie sheet sprinkled with corn meal. I coated the loaves with flour instead of oil.

I've made this twice now. It is not my favorite baguette recipe, but the ease and speed are undeniable. I make it with half whole-wheat flour. The texture is fairly good and the flavor is nice. The loaves become very stale the next day. I know I will keep making this again because it is so easy, though I will still use other recipes for days when I really have time to bake.

Having followed the recipe to the letter, I expected so much more. Or at least something edible. The process of steaming the crust always turns out well, but that does one no good if the bread (beyond the crackling crust) tastes like an envelope...

Rating: 4
I tried this the other day. It was great, could not have been any easier. The only thing that I would do is add a little more salt as I felt that the taste was a little flat. Other than that, it turned out great. In Fact, I liked it so much that I went out and purchased a 14 cup food processor. My 7 cup processor worked ok but was a little full.

Rating: 4
This was the first real bread recipe I ever tried; it came out great. I used my kitchenaid instead of my food processor and also followed other's advice to let it rise twice. Since I am new at baking bread, I hadn't realized that you really shouldn't handle the dough too much which resulted in a kind of mangled appearance, but it stil tasted great. Will make again soon.

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. It was decent, but baguettes can be so much better. I'll continue to look for a better recipe.

3/forks to the original recipe, but base on that,for more flavor boil the water with some of rosemary let it cool down to 115f, and for softness 3tbs olive oil,and it will be good for the next couple days,other then that i think it's a really good recipe.

I have made an endless amount of bread recipes, and this one is one of the best! I made one modification and added 2 T olive oil to the dough and thus needed to add about 1/4 C additional flour. It had an amazing texture, spongy, soft, and flavorful. Just wonderful. Next time I think I will not divide the dough and place in a 9x5 pan to make a sandwich style loaf. You must make this recipe...it's a winner!

Rating: 3
Just the bread to accompany soups! I made a few adjustments. (1) following other reviewers I added extra salt (1/2 tsp extra), (2) I used my mixer instead of a food processor (I mean, that's what the dough hook is for, right?), (3) I warmed the water only to 100 degrees because other recipes say that anything hotter will kill the yeast. I let the dough rise twice (once in the bowl and once after I formed the loaves) as it says in the recipe. I was surprised at how little the dough raised during the first rising. Still, the bread turned out just right.

THESE LOAVES TAKE ONLY 16 TO 17 MINUTES TO BAKE, although the recipe calls for 30!

This was definitely easy and I was surprised i could do it all in the food processor bowl. I did let it rise twice as recommended by others. Couple of things I will change next time - I'm going to add a little more salt and I think I'll try sea salt (used kosher this time) also will try either all or part bread flour - it needs a little more flavor. Lastly I too will lower the heat- my ends (hung off the side of the pan) burned slightly at 450 - so as others did I'll switch to 400. The directions for forming the loaves worked beautifuly. I'm going to stick with this one and keep making minor modifications. Maybe I'll add some fresh herbs to "jazz" up the flavor a bit.

I was surprised how good this bread really was. I have reviewed many recipes before I settled on this one. I omitted the vinegar because none of the authentic french bread recipes called for it. I did not use the food processor method. I followed the method as stated but used my kitchenaid mixer. End result was a crispy crust and delicious center. I will definitely make this again. Compliments to the recipe artist.

This bread was GREAT! I made half a recipe and did not add vinegar because I didn't have any, but it was SO GOOD! Chewy, dense and delicious!

I've made this recipe a dozen times or so. The second rise before forming is entirely not required. Warm your oven slightly and stick the loaf in there for extra warmth. Word to the wise though, only bake on non-stick pans with this one.

I didn't have loaf pans so I formed these on a sheet pan. (Let the dough rise twice in the food processor bowl as others recommended.) Baked @ 425 for 25 minutes or so, then turned over and baked another 5 minutes. Wonderful.

WOW. The first rise wasn't very good...as other reviewer said, not warm enough...I have the issue this is from, but can't find the supplement, so followed advice of Richmond and others for second rise. I can't find my French bread pan so did as other reviewer and used a cookie sheet. The loaves came out flat and quite brown after 30 minutes, so I skipped the last step. But WOW! The taste, the texture...fantastic! To mess with the recipe that much and have it far better than anything I've ever tried (and I have tried them all)...GREAT recipe!

Very simple and easy to prepare! The crust was perfectly crusty and the inside was nice and soft. I rated this recipe three forks because it seemed to be missing something in the flavor...next time I might try using a little more salt.

Amazing! The easiest bread recipe ever with such gratifying results. The boiling cup of water in the microwave tip was invaluable. I halved the recipe and with no bread pans, baked the loaf on a cookie sheet with excellent results. Deeelicious!

In addition, I use the processor for mixing only but I let rise in a warm bowl in a warm place-then I let rise and then split into 3 loaves.

I make this recipe the same except I split into 3 small loaves and roll each to 15 inches and then braid--then bake on baking stone. make sure you use the pan of water for best results.

Actually, I found this to be disappointing in that leaving it to rise in the food processor bowl is often unsuccessful due to it simply not being a warm enough environment for the yeast to rise adequately and I found the food processor bowl cumbersome. Perhaps someone out there has had much better success with this than I.

Wasn't sure if my processor was large enough to rise the dough, so I mixed in the processor then transferred it to an oiled bowl. Did allow it to rise twice as other reviewers suggested. I didn't have the French bread pans, so just formed the loaves and baked on an oilded sheet pan. Came out perfect. This is one of the easiest bread recipes ever. I also used bottled water as our water is very hard in this area.

This is a very nice and easy recipe. I made the dough in my breadmachine, letting the dough rise once and then forming the dough into loaves and letting them rise again for about 30 minutes while the oven (and the water in the oven) heated. The crust is nice and crispy without being two hard, and the flavor is good. I plan on making this again, for sure.

For pizza or foccaccio dough, add 2 teasp. sugar and 2 tablesp. olive oil and also add minced garlic and minced rosemary if desired to Gourmet August 2006 French Bread recipe and follow directions except form into desired shape. Let foccaccio rise again and pour 2 more tablesp. olive oil and 1 tablesp. sea salt on top. We cook on a pizza stone in our barbeque. I have tossed out all other pizza dough recipes. This is so easy and satisfactory. I have made this recipe at least 15 times. Easily keeps in a plastic bag in refrigerator for 5 days.

I made this bread twice. This is clearly better than supermarket bread, but that is not saying much. The rise is too quick therefore the dough is too tight, the cells do not have time to develop to make the bread lighter. On the other hand there was no shelling or layering. On the second try I added a quarter cup of whole wheat flour to give it some taste. I would not serve this to guests but for every day..it's quick.

I've never made a single loaf of bread before today and was rather pessimistic about my chances of success. I don't have a food processer, so I mixed the dry ingredients and vinegar with a large metal whisk and then used my hands to mix the dough. I also do not have bread pans, so I just used an old metal cookie sheet instead. As suggested by others, I let the dough rise twice before forming the loaves. Despite my apprehension, inexperience, and substitutions the bread came out wonderfully! Crisp and crusty on the outside with a perfect light interior. I couldn't be happier with the result!

Thanks for the tip from the reviewer in Richmond. Yes, the article in the supplement said to let it rise twice. When I made this bread a second time, I did that, as stated in the article. Much better texture, and I'm upgrading my rating to four stars! This is a keeper.

This recipe is flawless. Hold onto it. For those less experienced, read the whole recipe through first and follow the directions exactly. The dough is very loose, have some flour on the board. Also, for the rolling pin-challenged - used an empty (or full) wine bottle.

I haven't made this yet, but I see that in the Gourmet supplement, where this method appears, she made it rise twice in the processor, not just once as it says here.

This bread is so easy to make! The crust was wonderful. However, the texture was a little "cakey." I do plan on making again and playing with the recipe. I think maybe letting the loaves rise a little longer might help, might create more of those nice big holes that I associate with good French bread.
