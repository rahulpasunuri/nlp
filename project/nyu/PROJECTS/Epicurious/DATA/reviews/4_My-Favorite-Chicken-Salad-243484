Made the recipe using a store-bought roasted chicken. I followed it exactly, but agree that feta or even halved small mozzarella balls might be a nice addition. Had company and it was a big hit. Excellent for lunch today. Loved the simple lemony dressing. A great, easy summer salad. Wonderful for hot weather or when you're feeling lazy. I saw the recipe in the August 19, 2008 Parade newspaper supplement. Will definitely make again.

Really liked this. I doubled the salad dressing recipe, and two hours prior, added the veggies to the chicken and marinade. Next time I will add some feta to make it more Mediterranean. Flavors improved as the salad sat. Will definitely use again.

My family and I did not enjoy this salad. The olives overpowered the other flavors

Delicious, refreshing, easy and great to take to the office for lunch. I poached the chicken and did not use oregano. The next day was even better!
