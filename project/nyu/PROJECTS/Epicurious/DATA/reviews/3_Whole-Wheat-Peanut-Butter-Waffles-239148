I was looking for a quick and healthful waffle recipe this morning that would make use of ingredients I had on hand. I'm glad I tried these - I thought they turned out great. My husband and 3-year-old really liked them as well. I followed the recipe exactly, and just used a "heaping" 1/2 cup of PB since other reviewers said they liked it with more. I also used agave instead of sugar. Waffles baked up perfectly in a Belgian Waffle iron, no sticking, and tasted great. They are not overly sweet which was fine with me. Put the rest in the freezer to save for busy mornings when I can just pop them in the toaster! I recommend this recipe for a healthful and still delicious and indulgent breakfast.

Very dry and way too much wheat flavor. The peanut butter did not come through. With all of the other great waffle recipes out there, no reason to try to fix this one.

The concept is great, but there is something lacking here. The flavor is a little flat; I think it lacks sweetness. I'm not talking sugary-sweet, just that little bit of residual sweetness that any good waffle has. IF I make this again, we would top it with ice cream as a dessert waffle. But as a Sunday morning breakfast waffle, we've had much better.

No flavor,strange texture. First epicurious recipe that I've been thoroughly disappointed with.

I made "breakfast for dinner" tonight with these and put them in the Belgian waffle maker and everyone loved them! I substituted sunbutter (sunflower seed butter) for the peanut butter and agave nectar for the sugar and it worked out great. We topped them with raspberries, strawberries and whipped cream--fabulous!

I like this recipe a lot as is. But then again, I'm always on the lookout for whole grain waffles. The peanut butter makes these fine crumb, moist. There isn't a raging nutty taste but it's a healthier version of waffles. Good fuel for the day! Kids loved 'em

I made them as pancakes, and they turned out great! I used low fat milk and chunky peanut-butter instead. They freeze well too, so you can microwave them and have pancakes (or waffles) whenever you want!

I thought these were to die for. My daughter made them for mother's day and they were just as good the next day

I didn't like this recipe, the texture of the waffles was not appealing, had a faint peanut butter taste even though I doubled up on the pb, not worth the effort to make ... was mediocre. The main reason the texture was grainy.

My first batch of waffles was a bit soft and not very peanut butter-y, so I added another glop of peanut butter to the batter (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup). The waffles were much crispier and nutty after that, and quite good. Still, I doubt I'll make these again. I can get my pb fix by spreading a little pb on a regular waffle in place of butter.

I usually don't have a problem with waffles sticking in my waffle iron, but I had a horrible time with these. I managed to get one okay batch before I finally gave up and made pancakes with the batter. Perhaps 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 all-purpose would work better, but I'm not going to mess with it again.

Great. I added a bit more PB than called for, and these were very peanutty and substantial. Will make again and again

I was skeptical using peanut butter but it gave a nice texture with a nutter taste, not overwhelming with peanut butter. I used 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 whole wheat and almond oil. They turned out very crispy and tasty. I might try a little more peanut butter next time just to experiment.
