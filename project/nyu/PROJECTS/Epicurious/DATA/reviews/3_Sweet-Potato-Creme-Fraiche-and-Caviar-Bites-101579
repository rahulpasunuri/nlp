Excellent-- I wanted something tasty but simple to start a 7-course meal -- i used baby sweet potato and no decorative shapes -- discovered that caviar is EXPENSIVE!! (who knew?!? :) so instead i used bits of smoked salmon. What was lost in the potentially gorgeous color contrast of black caviar and orange sw pot was more than made up for in flavor, and whatever green you use (i used chives) makes a nice visual.

I've served this twice and both times it was a hit. Once I substituted finely sliced green onion for the fresh dill and I think it was even better. It looks awesome and I always make the guest guess what the sweet potato ingredient is for fun.

I made this dish for our gourmet club. Everyone loved it. It was very easy to make. I boiled the potato slices rather than steaming them. It did not alter the flavor. I'm always looking for quick, easy and delicious canapes and this recipe certainly qualifies.
