Super recipe! My family loved it, slightly adapted to ingredients on hand: leftover unsalted Thai "perfume rice" fine organic turmeric instead of curry powder rice vinegar dark organic raisins plumped in diluted lime juice a Charantais melon (size of small canteloupe) mango chutney dry roasted chick peas. Instead of adding all the oil to the dressing, I used 1/2 of it to pan-fry the chick peas, together with only 1/2 teaspoon salt. All the turmeric, vinegar, remaining oil, yogurt and mango were mixed for the dressing, then everything tossed together well. Delicious!thanks for the inspiration. (I suspected it was good when I read that it had been kept for 19 years)

This is one of my favorite recipes in Epicurious. I have made it several times, exactly as it is, and it is invariably good. It's simple, with not too many ingredients, but still, you need all of them to make a salad with perfectly balanced tastes and textures. It is important to steam the rice, so as not to leave any liquid in it. It makes a lot!

just made this and am so disappointed. I only put 2 tablespoons of vinegar because 3 sounded like such a lot. Wish I hadn't put any. The only thing i did differently was use peach salsa in place of chutney, because thats what i had. Tasted it before adding that and it was definitely better with. I am left wondering: are there really that many people who love the taste of vinegar? Or did i do something hugely wrong that i am missing? The vinegar overpowered, even at 2 tablespoons.

LOVE this salad! I have made it many times & prefer with addition of green onions and cubed roasted chicken. I use any chutney on hand and disagree with those who didn't like the melon. A full flavored musk melon or cantaloupe is superb with the curry and peanuts!

A fantastic combination of flavor and texture. The bitterness of the curry and yogurt is offset by the raisins, chutney and peanuts. I used Penzey's curry blend and didn't need much. The rice was purposely cooked al dente and the melon was very crisp. It was a nice surprising addition to an otherwise predictable buffet. Oh, and a little chopped fresh cilanto gave it a nice finish!

I read all the reviews of this recipe and was initially inclined, based on a read of the recipe, to believe that those who did not like it were probably wrong. Having made the recipe, I now find myself in complete agreement with them. While I did like the curried rice base and might use it again as a cold salad base, the melon did absolutely nothing for this salad. I did not care for the melon taste with the curry and, more important, I did not like the boring texture of the salad--soft rice, soft melon. Next time I am going to add some chopped green onions (this salad visually is boring, too) and use a crisp apple instead of the melon. Definitely, this recipe is one that needs help, but I think with a few changes it might be very good.

such a so-so salad, even after adding more hot curry powder for some punch. so disappointing

Based on all the glowing reviews, I made this for a luncheon and was somewhat disappointed. It was okay, but not anything really special. The curry was a bit underwhelming, and nothing really jumped up and said "taste me." There were a lot of leftovers, my definition of a less than great recipe. I should have stuck with my original plan to make curried turkey salad with mango chutney, not its precise name but another recipe on this site that is a four-forker, for sure.

In the many years I've made this recipe, it has never gotten tired or stale. It always works and tolerates small changes, based on availability of ingredients. Really popular at summer gatherings!

Terrific! Interesting blending of flavors. A real hit at the office summer party, with a staff of great cookes, no less! The only changes I made were to use brown rice and throw in some craisins for color. Yummy!

I didn't use melon in the salad but used cut up grilled chicken. I also added cranberries and red seedless grapes. An excellent recipe

This is a classic. I modified the recipe a bit --adding grilled chicken breast to make it a full meal rather than a side dish. It always amazes people; they always ask for the recipe. I have saved every issue of Gourmet since 1984, but this is one of the great ones. June '92 was a fantastic month for Gourmet :^)

I omitted the melon as well and also the peanuts since my son has a potentially fatal peanut allergy, but even without these ingredients it was quite tasty. It make a LOT!

This is a delicious summer recipe - it's refreshing and quite different. I enjoy serving it when dining outdoors!

Great summer meal. However, I omitted the cantelope (since I don't like it) and added a can of albacore tuna instead. Very good and the Major Gray's chutney really gave it a fabulous flavor.
