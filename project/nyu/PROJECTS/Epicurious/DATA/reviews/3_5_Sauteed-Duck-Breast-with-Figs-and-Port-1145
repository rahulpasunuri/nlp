this was delicious. i think i overcooked the port/fig sauce, but i'm making this again, for sure, so i'll be more careful next time. it was still delicious anyway, just a bit too thick. and it's an impressive presentation. i served it with toasted lebanese couscous - a subtle nuttiness and a neutral color that highlighted the duck and sauce very well.

OMG!! This was a wonderful dish. I asked my husband to rate it on a 1-4 scale and he rated it a 5!! I used this recipe as a base as I did sub a bit. First could not find dried figs, so I used 4 tbsps fig preserves for the dried figs. Also at the end of the sauce, instead of adding 2tbsp butter, I added a beurre manie (1tbsp butter mixed into a paste with 1tbsp flour). While the sauce simmered I stirred in the beurre manie until the mixture melted and thickened a bit..about 1-2 minutes. The sauce really compliments the flavor of the duck. I definitely will make this recipe again. This is a great recipe to serve your guest. A true keeper!!

I agree with every one else. It is superb. Serving it was as if we were in a first class restaurant.

The recipe sounded amazing and the picture looked very tempting. However, the sauce never thickened as it was supposed to (or as it it was pictured). Flavors not as intense as I'd have liked.
