Elegant due to its simplicity. No changes needed. Great side dish.

This was very good. I didn't chop up the spinach and it was still quite good. I took the advise of others and caramelized a red onion first. That was great. I also used olive oil spray instead of the olive oil.

Great simple and versatile side dish. Have made w/wine vinegar instead (less assertive flavor) and lemon juice w/bit of grated zest.

I made this substituting baby swiss chard (red & green) from the farmer's market and added 2-3 tablespoons of chopped fresh tarragon at the very end, and it was really good (though the red chard turned the beans a somewhat unsettling pink color). A bit bland without the tarragon. It would be great to make for guests, as you can make it hours early & serve lukewarm or at room temperature (better, I think, than hot ... but you need to add more salt). Served w/ roasted pork tenderloin marinated in rosemary, lemon juice, soy sauce, honey, & garlic. 30 min. of effort total! (By the way, I used Progresso canned beans and they were fine, but I didn't really cook them at all so they didn't have time to get mushy. Thanks to previous reviewers for the warning!)

This was OK. I used Goya beans and they did not get mushy. The beans stayed separated from the spinach, so it didn't really make a cohesive whole.

Quick and tasty. A good and healthy side dish for when you're in hurry.

I followed the recipe pretty closely but used about a scant tablespoon of minced garlic and a little more EV olive oil as well. Very good and extremely simple. This recipe is a real keeper for the weeknight side dish category. Wonderful next to a grilled lamb chop! PS: I used Goya brand canned beans--the only canned beans I trust.

Here we go "I loved it -- I changed everything" -- but it was very good. Instead of olive oil, I rendered the fat from a few slices of bacon (I later added the crumbled bacon back in at the end). Added in a small minced shallot with the garlic. I used dry white beans (soaked and cooked beforehand). Used frozen spinach instead of fresh (time to use it up!!) and only half of the balsamic...this took quite a bit of salt and pepper to jazz up even with the bacon. Much better the second day...

A nice side dish. However, the next time I'm going to make this I'll substitute white wine vinegar for the balsamic, as I found it a bit too strong for the mild white bean flavour. I'll also add some cayenne and nutmeg.

This was just so-so. The beans were mushy despite all attempts otherwise.

I had some carmelized red onion from another recipe and I added this in and it made a great recipe even better. I used 1/2 garbanzos and I garnished with a little roasted red pepper for color and this was the hit of the party! It even tasted better the next day when we had the left overs!

A very tasty side dish, which takes only minutes to prepare. I doubled the garlic. I used canned Progresso cannellini beans, and they are very soft (too soft, I think), so gentle stirring is required. Generally I buy only Goya brand when using canned beans. For anyone interested, that is the only brand I've found that doesn't add sugar to their canned red kidney beans.

I cooked up white beans from scratch with a ham hock, which added a nice flavor. I felt I needed to add more balsamic vinegar for my taste. Delicious!

Excellent side dish. Garlic and vinegar provide a zesty taste.

A simple "comfort food" kind of dish with just the right touch of garlic!
