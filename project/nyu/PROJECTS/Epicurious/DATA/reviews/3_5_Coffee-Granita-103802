I enjoyed this recipe. Its similar to the one on www.bestcoffee.com but it has nice twist.

You need to start this about 8 hours ahead. I did not have sambuca so I used a Portuguese herb liqueur, Licor Beirao. My guests ranted about it!

My guests felt the coffee needed more sugar...it wasn't nearly sweet enough to be enjoyed. Even the sambuca cream wasn't enough to make this dessert palatable.
