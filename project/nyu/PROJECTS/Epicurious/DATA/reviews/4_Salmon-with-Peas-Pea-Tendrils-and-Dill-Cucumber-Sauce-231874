Made this for mother's day supper with risotto- it was a beautiful spring dinner and everyone was raving! I didn't change anything from the recipe and it was excellent.

Just made this - it was really good. I made a fava bean ragout instead of the pea tendrills, but the salmon was great and went perfect with the bean / pea side.

Recipe sounds great, but every time I click on the Dill Cucumber Sauce link, it takes me directly to the Peas and Pea Tendril recipe - can someone please send me the Dill Cucmber recipe? Thanks.

I made this for a potluck and it was gone by the time I went through the buffet line! I was able to sneak some from my father's plate so I could have some. I made the cucumber sauce with a conventional cuke, peeled and seeded, with white pepper (as another reviewer recommended) and it was terrific. Great combination. LOTS of compliments.

This is a fabulous dish; beautiful presentation. Perfect for a dinner party. I'm sharing this recipe with my friends! Substituted pea shoots for pea tendrils which are not available here.

I loved how simple and easy this elegant meal turned out. The salmon was perfect (use a deep baking dish to hold al the liquid)The dill sauce was great too. Wished I had added more cayenne. Enjoy!

Great dish, quick and easy!! Salmon was cooked perfectly and dill sauce was great, even after I subbed light mayo and light sour cream. (FYI, the hothouse cucumber is also known as the seedless cucumber).

Yum! I didn't make the dill-cucumber dressing, but threw some chopped dill into the orange-lemon marinade, and it was perfect. Broiling with lots of salt and pepper is definitely the way to go with salmon.

This was the first time I've ever cooked fish. This was a very simple recipe with great flavor, but it's needs a little kick. The best part was the cucumber dill sauce. I had extra and used it on turkey wraps the next day for lunch. Instead of pea tendrills, I served the fish with a simple herb salad. This is a great week night recipe because it's quick and simple.

What temperature would I cook this at?

Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. Equally good hot or cold. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

I can get plenty of pea tendrils, but what are these "cucumbers" - never heard of them

I couldn't find pea tendrils either, so I just used baby peas and it was fine. Everything turned out great. I flaked the cold leftover salmon into the leftover dill sauce and served it on toast points the next day...great appetizer or lunch.

Didn't find pea tendrils. Salmon and sauce were heavenly. I lowered the fat content by using light sour cream and no mayo and sauce was perfect. Cold leftovers were a treat.

I made this last night without the pea tendrils - couldn't find them. It was delicious! Broiled the salmon in an iron cast grill pan and it was flaky and perfect. The dill sauce was to die for with just the right amount of kick from the cayenne. I will make this again.

I also thinks it looks good. I looked up what pea tendrils are. (I LOL when I read the review!) The below text is from: http://www.jamesbeard.org/events/words/pea_shoots.shtml Pea Shoots WHAT? Trendy tendrils. Long used in Chinese cooking, pea shoots are just beginning to find popularity on menus in this country. The pretty green tendrils, actually the leaves and shoots of the young pea plant, are a spring delicacy in China. Pea shoots, called dau miu in their native land, may be grown from a variety of pea plants but are traditionally culled from immature snow peas. Lee Jones, who grows them at his farm in Ohio (and who has experimented with 27 varieties), says his father considers the whole thing a puzzlement. "He's an old-time farmer--you grow the peas for the peas and the corn for the corn. We harvest them at three or four inches, and he just shakes his head." Pea shoots are sweet, tender, and have a strong pea taste. You cook them as you might any green--very quickly in hot oil with, perhaps, salt, garlic, and a splash of sherry or rice wine.

Recipe sounds very good, however I have no idea what pea tendrils are. Will make this dish without them unless you can tell me what they are. Thank you.
