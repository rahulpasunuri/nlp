This is always a favorite at any dinner or pot-luck. I know because there are never any leftovers - even when I double the recipe! Enjoy!

So easy and delicious.I used one package spinach and one artichoke hearts, and asiago for the cheese. Yum-meee. Nice change from the predictable spinach/feta pie.

I must have done something wrong, although I followed the recipe. It turned out awful.

delicious! i used fresh baby spinach which i steamed prior to adding. i also untintentionally turned this into a 'lighter' dish due to ingredients that i had on hand - 2 eggs + 2 whites and i substituted 3 c fontina with 1 c. low fat sharp cheddar and 1 c. tuscan pecorino. topped the whole thing with 1/2 c. italian breadcrumbs and guests raved! leftovers were delicious cold for breakfast

Like previous reviewers, made this as a side dish for Christmas with Romano instead of Fontina and it was a big favorite. Doubled the recipe and increased the cooking time a bit - also made it the day before (except baking) and refrigerated it (without the crumbs) until I was ready to bake it. Used about 1/3 the amount of crumbs called for, and it was enough for us. Will definitely use this again!

Used jalapeno jack cheese instead of fontina and sauteed red peppers in place of the sundried tomatos. Also cut down the baking time to 30 minutes. It was a big hit at a potluck vegetarian brunch.

I am not rating this recipe because I made some adjustments. I too substituted Romano in place of Fontina. It turned out great! I'd recommend about 8oz Romano if you choose to substitute. I also skipped the cracker crumbs. Next time, I will add a bit more sun-dried tomatoes. This was really good and easy to prepare.

This is great for Christmas- the green and red. Would definately make it again.

This was a great way to serve spinach. Very tasty. I would skip the crackers next time. Not neccessary.

I followed the advise of previous reviews and used romano cheese. My boyfriend loved it so much, I had to make it 2 days in a row! This was very simple and easy to make. This dish will be made often in our house.

I really liked this and plan to make it a bunch more. Two things, though - I used about 2/3 Fontina and 1/3 Romano, and that was perfect. The other thing is that I found that amount of cracker crumbs overwhelming - I ended up pushing most of them off. Next time I'll probably use about half as much.

I used the other recommendations and used fresh grated aged parmesan. I also used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. It was great. It is a great "do ahead" recipe.

my husband loved this one which is enough reason to make it again. i, like another cook, used romano instead of fontina. use less salt though; romano is pretty salty itself.

I love this dish and everyone always wants the recipe. It makes a great side dish and is very good leftover the next day. Other cheeses may be substituted and I like to use more sundried tomatoes.

Using the suggested fontina cheese, the dish was very bland. I substituted romano cheese instead of fontina and it made all of the difference. The dish with romano cheese was excellent and a real crowd pleaser!

I love spinach and I would not suggest this recipe, I don't think its very exciting to the palate. It was satisfactory as a side dish but I won't look for it again.

Easy enough to make that it's worth trying. I used feta and goat cheeses which worked fairly well. Perhaps a more flavorful cheese is called for, though, because the dish was a bit bland.

Easy to make, and the cheese is easy to sub if you cannot find fontina. I used ricotta and gruyere.
