Definitely a keeper! I doubled the recipe using proportional ingredients except for one less diced onion, an extra can of tomatoes (a total of 3) and lots more garlic and fresh herbs. Used dried Great Northern beans, a combination of hot Italian sausages and brats (my daughter "doesn't do spicy") and added six well-browned chicken drumsticks. Deglazed the skillet with a good amount of red wine. I popped the finished cassoulet into a 350F oven for 1/2 an hour to "meld" then topped with shredded Gruyere cheese and broiled (instead of the bread topping). My family loved it!

I know this is nothing like a true French cassoulet, but my family loves the dish. Also, it is easy and can be quickly prepared on a weeknight.

I would've gladly given this recipe four forks only it required some modification. As at least one other reviewer suggested, I almost doubled the tomatoes. Perhaps it needed more because I used home canned tomatoes which tend to be more tomato, less water, but I ended up using a 24oz container of tomatoes and also some additional water. I also added mushrooms and a ton more garlic to the onion/herb mixture and then deglazed that pan with red wine before adding the tomatoes. I increased the herbs by at least 100% also. I wilted spinach in at the end for color and nutrient density, served over mashed potatoes with a Malbec. It was super delish and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow night!!

I loved this recipe but made some changes based on other reviews. I increased the garlic (I love LOTS of garlic) I deglazed the pan with some good red wine and let it reduce. At the end I wilted some spinach into the mix. The bread cubes are a must; I used 12 grain sliced bread that I had at home.

I liked this recipe. For everyone going on about proportions - a recipe is base, change it to your own tastes. It was an easy, tasty, cheap homely meal that I will make again. My only addition was to stir through some lemon infused avocado oil, because I love it.

Simple, quick, delish. Followed the recipe and served over brown rice. Even my two year old ate it (after I picked out the tomatoes of course, sigh). I would wilt spinach into it next time for added nutritional value.

this is yummy, great when you want a warm one pot meal. I sauteed kale with the onions to add some nutritional value and also doubled the beans and tomatoes. simple and great leftovers!

Absolutely agree that the dish should be simmered longer - it's one of those Bistro-style dishes that are better the next day. I also used red wine to de-glaze the pan and liked using panko instead of bread cubes too. Perfect for a snowy winter day like we're having right now.

Oh hell yes! I made this last night. Substituted the white bread slices for cubes of baguette (which crisped up beautifully) and added half a package of the pre-cooked lentils from Trader Joes and a layer of spinach and then baked it in the oven at 375F for another 20 mins or so. And then had a party in my mouth! Ha! I had made 1.5x the servings and my boyfriend and I managed to eat almost all of it that night, it was that good.

Easily doubled to feed a family, this recipe is delicious, and especially satisfying on a cold winter's evening. Friends ask for the recipe often. This is a marvelous addition to your "comfort food" repertoire.

A wonderful friend made this for me recently as I recovered from surgery and it was very flavorful. SHe made it with dried not canned beans at my request, as I always like them better, A winner and really easy! It also freezes really well.

I agree that this is not a Cassoulet, but that's what I like about it. Sometimes I find that the duck confit can make cassoulet a little rich. This dish on the other hand is sooo delicious and so quick to prepare for a winter weeknight meal. It is hard to believe that a stew prepared so quickly can taste so good.

This dish is delicous! After the dish is done, before adding the topping, I covered the top of the sausage mixture with baby spinach and put the cover back on the pan for a few minutes - the spinach wilts and it is so yummy!

This was simple and delicious. The onions retain a slight crunch, which I liked. If you can help it, don't skip the topping - it's divine!

very very tasty, and definitely serves more than two! maybe three? i cooked the onions a bit longer to pull out more flavor, and added a splash of red wine. this dish is lovely, especially on a cold weeknight.

This is very funny for me! This the exact same recipe from a SHARE newsletter I kept since my "hard times". For those of you not aware, SHARE trades volunteer time and a small amount of money for a monthly "share" of food. It's a wonderful way to provide reasonably priced, nutrition filled meals for families on a limited income, on a monthly basis. I popped in to see if I could find a nutritional breakdown for this meal. FYI: I use extra garlic and red pepper flakes. This is an incredible meal served with a green salad, a peasant bread and red table wine.

This dish is definitely a keeper. It is not a true cassoulet, but it is delicious nonetheless. I used a sourdough baguette instead of white sandwich bread- it added a great texture that complemented the softer texture of the cassoulet. You shoud try this!

I made this recipe using a pound of dry Great Northern beans. Had my husband simmer them in water with a little carrot and onion for about an hour and a half before I came home from work, then added them to the recipe with the cooking liquid (minus the onion and carrot). I omitted the olive oil since i took the sausage out of the links and it gave off enough drippings on its own (even after draining twice) to then brown the onions and garlic in it. I also omitted the can of diced tomatoes because I had fresh ones on hand and chopped up a gigantic one, along with a Tablespoon or two of tomato sauce for color. I forgot the bayleaf because I didn't have the recipe in front of me, but I did add some crushed red pepper for heat. Everything else I did exactly as the recipe requested and it turned out wonderful. Oh, and I simmered the whole thing about 40 minutes more after adding the beans. All in all, great recipe. Delicious and relatively healthy (maybe next time i'll use turkey sausage for even less fat)

I thought this recipe was only ok. I'd make it again with some additions to add depth of flavor. I thought the proportion of beans to sausage were fine, but I wished I had cut the sausage into smaller pieces. I added a couple pats of butter at the end to give additional body to the "sauce" and a little lemon juice to perk up the flavor. If I try this agin, I will try the Whole Foods northern beans and a different brand of sausage. I used 3/4 hot and 1/4 sweet and thought the sausage dominated too much.

Rating: 3
this was the first recipe i made from epicurious waaaay back in '99. it is still how i remember it, very homey and delicious. i definitely use hot sausages. i thought the proportions were fine, not sure what the fuss was about. it is kind of one of those "peasant" type dishes that you put in it what you got, you know? Make it to your liking, if you like more meat then put in more meat. I did let the tomatoes simmer longer than five minutes...brought it to the boil and let it simmer but not for too long, i liked that the onions were soft but still had a little crunch for texture. splashed a little of the red wine from my glass into the tomatoes. read past reviews, not sure if i would do the pepp. farm stuffing trick. i used stale bread, the bread stayed crispy but absorbed some juice. pepp. farm stuffing just gets mushy. definitely make this dish, and don't worry about the proportions!

This is a good, quick, comfort-food dish. I used a pack of sweet sausage + a pack of spicy Italian sausage (serving 4 people) 2 big cans of diced tomatoes, 2 cans white kidney beans - dried herbs. I would use diced onions vs. sliced (as mentioned below). Served with a green salad. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
I make this about once a month during the winter. I recently tried it using panko breakcrumbs instead of white sandwich bread and really preferred the flavor and texture of the crust. The quality of the white beans you use is key here. If you can find them, use the Whole Foods Market brand in the glass jar. They are very rich and flavorful on their own and make the dish much richer tasting.

Rating: 3
A really easy, week-day meal. Yes, more beans and a longer simmer makes it better. I also think a bit more liquid than is called for is needed. I add some chicken stock and about a 1/3 C white wine. I've used kielbasa successfully in place of the sausage.

Rating: 3
I, too, agree that the proportions are wrong. I would half the onion and double the beans. I let it simmer for longer that the recipe said. With those minor changes the dish is delicious.

Rating: 2
I disagree with many of the other reviewers. Although this dish has potential, the proportions are wrong and it is unbalanced. There are too many onions, not enough beans, and too much sausage. The tomatoes should be cooked much longer than 5 minutes - closer to 20 minutes to meld the flavors. It also needs an additional flavor - sauteed escarole would add taste, texture and color.

Rating: 3
I was inspired by the readymade Cassoulet from FreshDirect in NYC. This is very different, but delicious nonetheless. Next time, I'm going to deviate from the recipe and attempt to make it smokier and more homogenous. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. It went well with a strong artisanal beer, Ommegang, in this case. Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
I've made this several times, once with fresh sage which was really wonderful. I use a good quality plain pork sausage and sometimes cubes of ham and I don't bother with the unnecessary and disagreeable topping.

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy substitute for the real thing. Have also added chicken legs, which stretches it a bit (brown them well first, then be sure to cook all the way through with the other ingredients before adding the beans at the end), and I like to use dried Herbes de Provence if I don't have fresh herbs at hand. Terrific with a rustic bottle of red on a cold night ...

I made a comment on this recipe back in 2000 and it has since become a favouite in our home. I always use spicy sausage, navy beans, chop the onions up and I never bother with the topping. Very quick and easy, uses stuff easily available in the pantry and freezer.

Have made this dish many times, and in multiples of the original. The highest praise was when my dad said"this is good!"

Made this last night for dinner. A lot better than what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be very filling and kinda plain (like one reviewer said "tasting of sausage and beans" but it was actually pretty good. I did add baby spinach and some sliced carrots to make it a little more substantial. And a I added some wine because it was a tad too dry for me. Did try to cheat and use salad crutons (didn't like the crutons) and sprinkled some fresh Parm on top. Yum!

Re: "Wait, you put beans on top of rice?" Uh...did ya ever hear of Red Beans & Rice? A classic, staple, New Orleans food? Of course beans go with rice. This recipe is what it is--a fast, simple approach to a usually complex dish. I think it worked fine. I used chicken instead of sausage, though, because my wife hates any type of sausage. C'est ca.

So yummy! This recipe defintely serves more than two. I would use diced onions instead of sliced next time. Other than that, it was great. I served it with roasted garlic on thinly sliced and toasted bread. What a great flavor combo!

This dish was very tasty and flavorful! I used a spicy sausage, as suggested, which gave the dish a punch! Will definitely make again.

Very easy, and doesn't require a trip to the grocery store. I used spicy sausages, a 16oz bag of dried navy beans, added a can of water (filled up the can from the tomatoes), and let the crock pot go for 12 hrs. In the last hour of cooking I added a 1/2 tsp more of thyme. It was delicious, but even better the next day!

We found this recipe to be a treasure. I used 2 sweet and 2 hot Italian Sausages, resulting in a blend that pleased us very much. I cooked it for a week night meal for my husband and me. I used dry beans and cooked them to barely done. I find that canned beans seem to become mushy when used in a long-simmering dish. I cooked the Great Northern beans in the morning and finished the dish at dinner-prep time. Retired - LaConner, WA

Very quick and easy. And like another reviewer said you can use what you have. I used fresh thyme, rosemary and sage. Added more than the 1/2 tsp. Also I used lamb sausage and spicy italian. Next time will use duck sausage and maybe chicken to change the flavor. Served it with some slices of nice rosemary bread and a green salad with vinegrette.

WOW!!! I have been thinkng about white beans and sage all day! This was so quick and easy especially because I used canned beans...not to mushy if only combined for 10 minutes or so. Used fresh rosemary, sage and thyme. I only had sweet italian sausages and noted additions of hot italian... So I just added red pepper flakes to taste. Forgot to make the topping. Made brown rice bc my family would want to know "what are we putting it over?" Makes enough for 4. Will make again for another cold May night in Maryland!

Well this worked for me, but it is not an easy one, I had pork confit and turkey leftovers, and so I used the basic principals to produce the cassoulet. Confit can be pork, goose, turkey, the point being that it does not have to be a duck. From my experience a confit is one of the most time consuming and difficult of all things, but it is well worth the effort. Here the combination of ingredients worked, the pork confit, dark meat from leftover turkey, and the other ingredients. It was very good! Served it plain with a good red wine, simple fruits, cheeses and nuts for dessert. Careful note, if you do use a real confit, do not add ANY salt.

Rating: 3
Quick, delicious and hearty. It satisfies a desire for cassoulet on a weeknight with limited time and energy available after work. It is also a perfect dish to create from items already in the pantry.

I am always looking for something different to do with sausages, and this recipe is a simple, pleasant change. Like some of the other reviewers, I also prefer this with hot sausages, but sweet work well also. I have also thrown in leftover shredded chicken and that has worked well. A good, quick, weeknight recipe.

Just made this tonight and it was great. I omited the topping and would recommend serving it with some French bread to soak up the juices. I also used two 14.5 oz cans of beans and only one onion. I also added about half a can of water with the tomatoes and let the whole thing simmer for a while. All in all a wonderful dish.

Rating: 3
Yum. I used pork and apple sausage, substituted brown bread for white and leeks for scallions, added about 1/4 c. port when the tomatoes went in, and let the whole thing simmer a little longer than the recipe indicates. Delicious, and now I've got the fabulous sense of well-being that comfort food is meant to evoke. Again: yum.

Rating: 2
First off, my substitutions: I used meatless Italian sausage (from Boca) for the meat and croutons (from Pepperidge Farm -- thank-you, previous Chef!) for the topping. I thought the onions were a bit much and way too stringy. If I make this again, I'll use only 1 onion and double the beans. That said, my husband said he loved it just the way the recipe stated.

Rating: 3
I also made this with hot sausage, and for the topping I used pepperidge farm cubed stuffing (less work) and it came out very flavorful and hearty.

I added duck breast, broiled with the sausage. I also use french bread for the topping. We often eat this dish; my husband loves it. I like that it is quick and easy to make. One of these days, I'll make an authentic Cassoulet from scratch.

I used 16 0unces hot Italian sausage and 2 14 1/2 ounce cans of Great Northern Beans. For spice I used 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence and 1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley. This made a delightful savoury comfort food that I will certainly make again when I am too busy to prepare something more elaborate.

I have made this a few times, but I prefer it with hot Italian sausage ,I know that makes it stray even farther from the french roots of the recipe, but it adds a very nice layer of flavour. I also cut up the onions more, as I found with their method they were stringy.

I made it as described once, and it was so-so. I asked my friend how it tasted, and he said, 'like beans and italian sausage.' It was a mild sausage, but even so its seasonings dominated everything else. Made it again today. Used a little more garlic and two 14 oz cans of Great Northerns instead a 19oz one (19 oz cans not available at my grocery.) I also used stir-fry pork. I rolled it in seasoned flour and browned it. Then I proceeded with the rest of the recipe. This recipe though? Nyah. It's just a good starting point for cheater's cassoulet. (oh, and version 2 got rave reviews.)

Nicely-flavored comfort food for cold weather. I used scallions and parsley, and added some parmesan to the topping. We'll definitely be having this again before the winter's over!

This was great! I doubled it and used parsley, not green onions. Also, the sausages I used were pretty thick so preparation time took longer than indicated to ensure that they were thoroughly cooked. I think you could also add some diced cooked chicken or duck to make it even more authentic. I served it with a green salad with mandarin orange segments and crumbled bleu cheese. And I think the dish could be made a day ahead and reheated.
