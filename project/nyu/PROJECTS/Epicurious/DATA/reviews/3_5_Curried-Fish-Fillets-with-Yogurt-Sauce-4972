The curry in this dish is overwhelming for anyone who does not love curry. My husband loved the sauce with the former reviewer's addition of mango chutney but did not like the curry spice combined with the wheat germ. I found it fine but not memorable. Next time I will stick to my mom's recipe using mayo then wheat germ coating baked at a 350 degree oven. Results in a much moister product without all the funky taste.

this was my first experience with wheat germ - Wow! What an amazing ingredient. I made flounder for my wife and friends during Oscars night - I was only half paying attention to each. It was SO FAST and SO delicious. Everyone was impressed and licking their plates. Didn't have curry powder but mixed together the spices I did - some cumin powder, cardamom, coriander, ginger and chili powder. The wheat germ has great flavor so you'll be OK if you're missing a few spices. Served with a side of quinoa with tomatoes, cucumber and the extra chives. Highly recommended.

I completely changed this recipe to suit what I had on hand, but the principle remained the same. I used chicken, bread crumbs and put the curry in the sauce instead on on the chicken. It was quite delicious.

I suggest adding mango chutney to the yogurt sauce for additional flavor.

This is a good basic recipe; but I tweaked it quite a bit. I used plain, fine dry bread crumbs instead of wheat germ, because I had no idea how wheat germ would taste and I already had the bread crumbs. I also livened up the yogurt sauce by adding a dash of lemon juice and mixing it with a little Major Grays mango chutney. It was nice; the chutney complements the curried fish and adds a little tang. Next time I will probably omit the cilantro to avoid too many competing flavors.

I would try making this recipe again, but with some tweaking. To the yogurt sauce I would like add either fresh mint or dill. The sauce was just a little bland without. For the fish, I had substituted flour for the wheat germ and found the substitution a little too bland. I will probably use crushed pistachios the next time around instead of flour/wheat germ. Quick to make and definitely worth trying again.

JUST AN EXCELLENT, DIFFERENT WAY TO COOK OUR FAVOURITE FISH.

This technique has a nice taste/work ratio. I also used bread crumbs and was pleased with how crispy they got in the oven. I'd recommend using strained yogurt (and adding a little lemon juice!).

The curry wouldn't rub onto the fish but rolled around into big pieces. The flavor was OK. The sauce was adequate but sort of one-note. I didn't have wheat germ and used bread crumbs, which worked fine. What I like about this is that it is a general method that will lend itself to many different seasonings, which I'd put in the breading, rather than the fish, next time. There is so little fat in this that you can splurge on a big dessert!

The yogurt sauce makes it absolutely heavenly! I used catfish fillets and they were nice and moist.

I don't understand how others loved this. It was DRY. What did i do wrong? And not alot of flavour. Just curry which over took the fish. Ver y disapointed.

Used an orange roughy for the fillets. A superb dish!! Easy to make and we could not get enough of it. Yogurt sauce was perfect.
