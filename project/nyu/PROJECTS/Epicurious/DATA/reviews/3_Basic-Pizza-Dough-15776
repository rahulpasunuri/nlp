I followed the recipe exactly and was very satisfied with the result. The crust was chewy, not hard (as some other reviewers are reporting), and it browned nicely.

I made this dough, adding a little sugar to feed the yeast, pressed it thin, and cooked it over charcoal and it totally ruled. I topped it with manchego, capers, anchovies, tomatoes and arugula and promptly ate myself into a food coma. Top marks.

This was my 2nd homemade pizza and my first one was a disaster, although this one was amazing, crisp and very easy to work with. I put in a table spoon of sugar for the yeast to feed on and made my own sauce. I let it set for 90 minutes and it still turned out fantastic. I reccomend this for all 1st timers.

Yuck! awful,& un enjoyable. I thought it was strange for there to be a pizza crust recipe not containing at least a bit of sugar and oil in the crust! But I figured maybe the recipe writers knew a technique that I didn't so I gave it a try even though I was skeptical. I should have trusted my instincts and should not have bothered making this crust. Very hard, flat, thin, bland tasting & didn't rise in the oven while baking {I'm sure that was due to the lack of sugar for the yeast to feed on in this recipe. Definitely NOT A KEEPER. Not worth the ink & paper to print it out with.

I added a teaspoon of sugar based on other reviews, as this just makes sense to give the yeast something to feed on. I wish I had also added some olive oil as was suggested, as I found the dough very stiff and hard to work with...I actually got a pain in my wrist by the time the 10 min of kneading was up. It was ok, but back to the lab....

We usually add fresh rosemary, basil and oregano into the dough to add extra flavour in every bite. As well, use a mixture of whole wheat and all purpose flour to make it a little healthier. It is delicious!

Made this as written and it was easy and delicious. Easy to work with too. The final result, baked on a pizza stone, was nice and crispy.

The recipe definitely needs some sugar, there;ll be nothing for yeast to feast on. Might it be an authentic Italian way not to put sugar in this dough? I found it too dry and almost impossible to knead by hand - kept sprinkling water on. Although using mixer might help with that problem. Next time will try it with 3/4 cup of water...

Used this recipe to make the dough for the Three-cheese Mushroom and Spinach Calzone recipe on this website. Added 1 tsp of sugar and 1 Tbsp of olive oil as recommended by other reviewers. Also saved labor by using the dough hook on my mixer rather than kneading by hand. Though I can't say it's my favorite pizza dough ever, it certainly fit the bill quite nicely.

Easy and reliable, a great basic. I like to add a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and half a tablespoon of garlic powder for extra flavor.

Great and easy dough to make - I use it all the time - my 9 year old loves to make her own pizza and this is so much better than anything at the grocery store!

I turned this pizza dough from basic to quite good with the following substitutions/additions: As per earlier comments I added 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp olive oil and some oregano to dough. Substiuted 1/8 cup of flour with rye flour. Made in kitchen mixer with dough hook. Can be doubled. Baked one batch on pizza stone and one on jelly roll pan with very similar results - very simple, quick and quite delicious.

The dough is a little tough to work with, but well worth it. It's the perfect combination of crisp and chewy!

pizza turned out PERFECT! the only problem for me was baking time, it depends on the oven, u cannot pretend to get an exact baking time, so make sure pizza dough is lightly golden and cheese is bubbling before taking pizza out of the oven....also,make sure u use a 9 inch pie pan!! I made double the recipe for 2 12 inch pizzas!!! PAY ATTENTION! the flavor was just right. Don't worry if dough feels tough, it's part of the process

I made 17 batches of this dough for a pizza party at the yacht club. I used my kitchen aid and at first made 2 batches at a time. Then figured out my mixer was big enough to do 4 batches at a time. Everyone from young and old loved their pizza. And it didn't take much effort to make the 17 batches. It fed 2 dozen children and 2 dozen adults and with the left over dough we made breadsticks with cheese sprinkled on top! I've been requested do this annually!

Not the Best pizza Dough, But what one would expect from a Basic Dough as this recipe is called(add a pinch of Sugar so the Yeast has something to feed on also cook on greased pan for a crisp crust) Perfect for Stromboli!!

Made this dough once, with bad results. Thought it was our fault and just tried it again: with the same results. It's too dry or there's no food for the yeast. Kneading it is like massaging a roofer's shoulder. Even harder to roll out. But! The first time we made this it was apparent it wasn't going to make a pizza. So we flattened the dough as best we could, drizzled some aioli on it, and baked "breadsticks" that were awesome. When life give you bad dough, make appetizers!

try this recipe for making foccacia! I make this dough and divide it into 2 parts you can freeze it right away, and take out of freezer a couple of hours prior, freezes very well and you can keep it for months until ready to use I just sprinkle kosher salt, spread olive oil and some rosemary on top bake as necessary and voila!

the dough was a waste..i strongly recommend "Jaime Oliver" (BBC's Naked Chef)pizza dough.

very easy and very good. you do have to cook it on a pizza stone though, or the crust doesn't crisp.

All though this recipe took longer than I had hoped because of all the rising it was fun and yummy! I bought some sauce from a store and some cheese, put it on when the dough was ready and then I cooked it for about five minutes. It was crunchy and delicious! But you should add 1 tablespoon of sugar.

I have made this recipe on four seperate occasions and have had great reviews. The last time I added a table spoon of sugar and two of olive oil; this gave the pizza a rich color and crispy texture (a trick I learned from a very popular pizza palor in my neighborhood).

This dough is ok but if you add about 2tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of oregeno to it it makes it better.

Definately one of the most unappealing crusts I have ever made. I even tried it twice thinking I had done something wrong the first time. I use a pizza stone, so it should have been great. It was tough, dry, and could have been mistaken for cardboard. I won't be trying this one again!

This recipe makes an excellent crust when using a pizza stone. Turns out very crispy and good flavor. We have stuck with this recipe after try many other pizza dough recipes. Try adding a teaspoon of each dried basil and oregano to the dough for a nice variation.

This recipe (above) was bland, tough, and dry. This is how the pizzarias make dough: 1: use high gluten (14% protien flour)..can be ordered on-line 2: mix with electric mixer (use dough hooks) for at least 15 min 3: rise for 2 hours covered on counter, then rise 4-24 hours in fridge, covered 4: bake at 525F on preheated pizza stone, lowest rack in oven 5: before baking, brush crust with 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1 clove crushed garlic, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp oregano. 6: add sauce 7: add combination 1/3 provolone, 2/3 mozzarella 8: add topping sparingly Just like from the pizzaria; chewey, tasty, crisp on bottom. Guaranteed.

This is a very good, though basic, recipe. I've used it to make calzone, breadsticks, and pizza. When making pizza, I tend to make two small pizzas (8 inches). This is a great recipe for those who are impatient... you can just let it rise in the bowl.

I did use the semolina tip written by the reviewer below and that made the dough tasty. It is a very thin crust from the recipe. I would have to double it in order to have enough for my small family to have enough to eat.

First of all I don't like the dry yeast (the dough doesn't rise as well as fresh yeast which is easy to buy and easy to store). It seems a bit complicated. The recipe I found years ago was 1 cup water to 3 or 4 cups flour (depending on the flour), putting first only 2 cups flour and gradually adding more so that the dough is soft but does not stick to the fingers.

Very light and easy to work with. I added a TBSP each of chopped fresh oregano & basil to the dough and topped the crust with basil pesto, fire roasted San Remo tomatoes, buffalo mozarella slices, and fresh grated parmesan.

BAD recipe. The dough was too dry and too hard. I would NEVER try this recipe again.

If you like thin, crispy crust, you'll really like this recipe. I found that the dough was much more manageable if you let it rise (during the second rising period) in the refrigerator (wrapping the dough in plastic wrap). The chilled dough was better able to withstand the stretching and rolling that was needed to cover two pizza stones.

The cooking time on this recipe is too long and dries out the crust. the second time i made this, i cooked it for about 13 minutes at 500, just until the cheese melted and the dough was cooked in the middle. also, if you put it on the floor of a gas oven, the crust will burn! put it on the lowest rack.

Great pizza dough, however, when I froze the remaining dough it did not taste anything like the fresh dough.

We doubled this recipe for a super size pizza. Raised the dough using a low power microwave technique mentioned on a cooking show and it seemed to rise fine (though my spouse thought it could have been better rising the regular way). We brushed the edges with olive oil/black pepper for zip. Next time, we might add herbs/garlic too.

Crusty crust taste delicious. I shortened the preparation time to less than thirty minutes. I didnot let it rise the second time. The first risen time was 15 minutes in the regrigerator
