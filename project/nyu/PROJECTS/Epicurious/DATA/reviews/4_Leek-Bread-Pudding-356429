wow.. so good.. i did do some tweaks.. just b/c I used what I had on hand.. and due to forgetting the cream (oops).. and using a slightly smaller pan.. I could only stir in two cups of the cream, instead of three.. It did cook up in about 45 mins instead of the 1.5 hours as many others mentioned.. and I used three leeks, as opposed to measuring out 2.5 cups (why didnt he give a weight?) .. which looked like about 3 or 3.5 cups.. it could have used even more I think! Also, I used gruyere cheese, b/c that is what i had! Anyway.. it turned out AMAZING. I think I am going to keep with the 3 cup milk/2cup cream ratio in the future. .as it was almost pillowy, not heavy at all.. I love love love this .. I had been wanting to cook it from the very first time I purchased Ad Hoc.. finally broke it out for xmas dinner.. wow.

I made this dish for a French dinner party that I hosted and although it wasn't the main course, it stole center stage! I like the idea of single servings so I did them in individual footed soup bowls and cut the cook time in half. Kept them covered with foil until the last 10 minutes. UNBELIEVABLE! Will definitely make this again!

This was really delicious, although I used different sized pans and tried to reduce the recipe. I probably didn't do it correctly, and so I wish I had used more leeks and more cheese, but fewer bread cubes to improve the ratio and also have the bread fully submerged in the custard.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch last year and it was a hit with my family. I will definitely be making it again this year. It was easy and delicious!

Delicious! It was the starch for a ladies' luncheon. We loved it!

Pretty foolproof once you get the time down. I normally disapprove of altering the recipe the first time, but I did toss in some shaved black forest ham to shore it up as a main dish. Delicious!

This is in the oven now, and it smells heavenly. What's better than leeks in butter? Mmm. Thank you so much reviewers for the notes about the cooking time. I added a few asparagus tips to the last 5 minutes of the leek saute, so they'd look cute peeking out the top and to make it a little springier. I also split the recipe into two pie tins so I can bring one to a friend; the portions were perfect. A lovely spring dish!

I made this in the past getting the recipe instead from "SeriousEats.com. In that posting Chef Keller gave a 45 minute baking time which is what I used and it came out incredible.....fantastic side to my braised short ribs....needless to say, a special occasion meal ONLY! For those who got the recipe here, you should thank "CookingLover" from Salt Lake City.....I too watched Martha Stewarts video and Chef Keller's direction there was "about 35 minutes" yet on the post was shown as 1-1/2 hours as it is here. CookingLover, hope you make this.......wonderful!

I made this for a holiday party and people are still talking about it. The cheese and bread are the real stars so try not to sub something less than. I used emmenthaler and a pullman loaf. weird that bread and cheese could taste so refined!

Wow. This was everything I had hoped it would be. I did double the leeks, as we enjoy onions at my house. I also doubled the amount of cheese, but by mistake, but it was just right! I served this as a main dish with oven roasted tomatoes, sauteed spinach and poached eggs. I didn't bother with the whole parchment lid on the leeks, but did find that toasting the bread first really made a difference and I think it would have just been a soggy mess had I not done that. A bit time consuming, but well worth it.

Wonderful, an all around favorite. I doubled the leeks and used a crusty country loaf from Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, but any good quality ciabatta would do as well. I will make this again and again...

I've not made this. However, I noted one commenter mentioned that his/her dish cooked more quickly than the recipe indicated. I just rewatched TK making this on the Martha Stewart show and he suggested a baking time of 30-35 minutes. Huge disparity between 1-1/2 hours and half an hour. Same thing happened with his pave potatoes.

Delicious! I've made this twice already--first following the directions and then revising it a bit. For the 2nd time around I doubled the leeks (no need to double butter) and just sauteed them in the butter until they were soft (the parchment lid/emulsifying directions seemed unnecessarily complicated). I also did not toast the bread before adding liquid mixture so that the bread could absorb the liquid better. Finally, rather than layering, I just mixed all of the ingredient in a bowl first and then added to baking dish. Still great!

Not sure what went wrong...Mine cooked a good deal faster than Keller advised. Right pan size, check. Followed the directions,check. As a consequence I lost the wonderful custardy factor. The taste of leeks was also muted. I also agree that it seems to require a longer cooking time for the leeks than is really necessary. Trust me, this was still eaten right up. Even poorly executed TK is still pretty darn good.My husband saw the gorgeous picture of this dish in our new Ad Hoc book and simply began to drool. I will try again.

I got this book for Christmas and this recipe is the first thing I made from it. It is absolutely fantastic. I added spec ham, and it was a perfect mid-winter meal. Too rich for every day, but a clear winner.

Brilliant dish; Served as side dish with ham and Susan Spicer's pickled pear relish and southern braised string beans with black eyed peas for Christmas brunch and my husband, who's a well known chef (and delighted to get a break from the kitchen) raved. I will say that I am lucky since the bread I used was a loaf of brioche from Spago...spoiled, lucky cook that I am.

I served this as a main dish at a vegetarian Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit. As a main, I added oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic and just layered them on top. I would add more leeks, I think, but that's the only adjustment I'd make. People were a little surprised to be eating a savoury bread pudding and the lack of other veg in it made me wonder if it would be all that great as a main, but it worked really well. I would make sure to try the tomatoes on top, however - they added color and dimension.

I served this with Michael Psilakis' Beef and Leek Stew (recipe also on this site, part of this article), though I think it would be perfect with prime rib, as the header notes suggested. I'm not sure if the amount of leeks I used was too little (I halved the recipe) or if the Beef & Leek Stew that I served it with had an over-powering flavour, but the bread pudding was excellent, none-the-less. I'm not sure that the leeks need QUITE as much pre-cooking as the recipe calls for, but Keller's method is dead on the money. (Not that I would have any rights to question his methods :) Brioche, Pullman bread, or another airy, buttery, egg-based bread is definitely needed to get the correct end textures & flavours; I ended up using half 'regular' bread, and half buttery, flaky rolls (no Brioche at my grocery store!) and I noticed the latter bread style worked better. I also served roasted grapes with thyme & shallots, and the bread pudding was wonderful with the juices from the grapes. A perfect, more flavourful, and more showy side dish when compared to Yorkshire puddings. Next time I will add more leeks...
