Only made the dressing with several adaptations based upon what I had around the house. Used whole umeboshi which I pureed, instead of paste. Also used yuzu instead of umeboshi vinegar. Came out a little thick and salty so I had to add more sugar and some water. Overall a good place to start with adjustments to taste.

The umeboshi plum is too overpowering. Taste was better without it
