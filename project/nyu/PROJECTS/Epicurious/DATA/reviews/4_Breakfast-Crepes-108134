Generally I would not rate a recipe if I deviated from the recipe, BUT... I accidentally left out the brandy! I always add a dash of high quality vanilla, regardless if I intend on making sweet or savory crepes. This is the most perfectly simple, delicious, EASY recipe out there. Throw it all together in the blender, pour into a 1/4 cup measuring cup, pour into your crepe pan, swirl around the crepe pan, cook on medium until the edges dry up, flip, let them cook a sec, then separate the crepes between layers of wax paper and it makes enough to enjoy the following week, take to work and snack on! Two great ways to make them: Black Forest ham and Brie with bechamel sauce (and maybe a lil fig jam) if you like the sweet/savoy, or ricotta with a high quality strawberry jam to make a home-made blintz! Regardless of the prep, RAVE reviews are sure to follow! Another note about separating the crepes with wax paper.... ALWAYS do it this way! It you have a stack of left-overs, 20 crepes high, simply fold all four corners of the wax paper in towards the center, press gently to remove the excess air, and place the "packet" of crepes in a large freezer/type ziplock bag -again, don't forget to squeeze out the excess air. Keep them in the fridge for a week, or toss 'em in the freezer. They keep perfect in the fridge for up to a week. My co-workers delighted over week-old crepes w ricotta and strawberry jam!

This is going to be a regular thing for me for sure! I'm in love with making crepes in general and this is a keeper method. I substituted all the brandy with Disarronno Amaretto and it was stupendous. Very sweet though.

This is my go-to recipe for crepes! It does come out watery at first, but after sitting in the fridge overnight or for at least 2 hours, it become slightly thicker. I also used 2 pans when making them. I scoped the mixture into a small pan first then spread it around. It's easy as the mixture is thin, which should be the right consistency- you don't want a pancake. After afew minutes (when u see some bubbles), you flip it over onto a bigger hot pan. There's no need to use spatula! I made the mistake of placing the crepes in the oven to keep them warm as I went about making the crepes,... and some of the edges dried out. On my second attempt, I placed a lid over the crepes (when they are in the oven). Problem solved. You get warm and slightly moist crepes that are to die for! As strawberries are in season, I made a compote of strawberries/butter/sugar sauce to go with the crepes.

Excellent! No need to adjust amounts as others instruct. Simply make the night before and leave the batter in the blender in the fridge. Letting crepe batter rest is traditional and serves a purpose: the flour will absorb more liquid which both thickens the batter a bit and affects how it cooks. If you let it rest overnight this batter handles beautifully in a crepe pan and you can't taste the liquor---as someone else mentioned it just deepens the buttery flavor. I think this is the best sweet/breakfast crepe batter I have ever tasted (and I've eaten a lot of crepes in France).

LOVE this recipe. Have made it as written, and the crepes were just wonderful. But I am currently not eating milk protein due to my nursing son's allergy, and I tried it substituting Silk coconut milk for the whole milk and extra virgin coconut oil for the butter--perfect and delicious. Used Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey liqueur for the brandy (have also made these with brandy, bourbon, and port, all delicious). A great, flexible recipe that's also dead easy and can be made perfectly on the first try. Excellent!

Rating: 4
Phenomenal! The perfect crepe recipe. I made it to recipe with the exception of lessening the brandy to 1/4 cup. I think 1/2 cup would overwhelm it and taste too boozy. The 1/4 cup of brandy deepened the buttery vanilla flavour. I will absolutley make this again.

For my 38th birthday , my wife bought me a crepe pan. I have never made crepes before. This recipe was simple and excellent. I added 1/4 cup more flour and used cognac instead of basic brandy. They are a hit with everyone who tastes them. My first real experience with crepes was in Aruba. At the Palm beach mall there was a little shed no larger than 8'x8' with two people working the pans. The price and the quality was outstanding. We would go almost every day of our two week vacation. This recipe is better!

I've made this recipe twice now--once as written and once using a little more flour and a little less brandy as suggested by other viewers. Though I really enjoyed how thin the original recipe was, it was almost impossible to flip them in my crepe pan. My suggestion is to keep the brandy the same (we like 'em boozy!) and add a few more tablespoons of flour. We had these this morning with sliced bananas, raspberries and blackberries, smothered in balkan-style yogurt with a drizzle of maple syrup. Divine! The extra's are in the freezer and I'm sure they will get used up very soon.

the best crepes I've ever had!! I agree with some of the comments below, batter comes out a little too runny to flip as is so I added only 1/4c brandy and a half cup more flour and these were amazing!

I used Calvados (apple brandy) and we really enjoyed them. The only thing I might do in the future is reduce the amount of brandy because they still seemed a little alcoholic when done cooking. Since I was feeding them to my young children, I figure not getting them drunk at breakfast might be wise.

These tasted fantastic! A few modifications though; I've successfully made crepes before, but when I followed the recipe for these I came out with batter so liquidy that I couldn't flip the crepes without tearing them. I added a little flour until I could flip them without a problem. Used half brandy half and irish whisky - I think any similar liquor would have a great outcome. Served them with strawberries, bananas and nutella, and softened green apples and brie. The latter was the biggest hit!

Subbed dark rum for brandy, and it tasted utterly fantastic with strawberries and Nutella, or jam and sour cream, or honey, or powdered sugar...or just plain melted butter. All incredibly delicious. I've also modified the recipe to make savory crepes; it's very versatile and easy and consistently amazing.

I found this recipe accidentally while looking for something to do with 4 kiwi I got in my weekly "farm box". The reviews were so unwaveringly positive that I couldn't wait to go shopping for all the right ingredients. Like others who have written here, I used what I had and made substitutes as needed -- with absolutely no noticeable effect on the final product. These were amazing!! I will try them again according to recipe, but please know you can have a great crepe with whatever you have on hand. Of course, you must have the eggs! Here are my substitutes/changes: --unsweetened vanilla soy milk for milk --3 Tbs melted butter instead of 5 Tbs --irish whiskey for brandy/cognac (only had about 1/3 cup - added extra vanilla to make up liquid) --"Zero"(erythritol,fermented sugar, zero calories) for regular sugar --Trader Joe' white 100% whole week flour for all purpose flour I had only one cast iron skillet, so used one of my nonstick ironclad skillets as a second to keep the process moving along. Both worked beautifully - no particular advantage to the cast iron except maybe a bit more even browning. I cut up fresh fruit--strawberries, two of the kiwi, raspberries and banana. I added the juice of half a lime to the mixture and cut the fruit up pretty small. Also, I added a sprinkle of Zero to bring out the juices. Finally, Trader Joe's organic, low-fat vanilla yogurt made a delisious "sauce" and may be a bit lower in calories and saturated fat than whipped cream. It is rare that something tried for the first time comes out so well - particularly with so many substitutions. Please try this - it is well worth the little extra prep required and would be a great treat for company.

This is the best crepe recipe ever! The brandy and vanilla extract is key!. We found it is best to make all the crepes in advance and to let everyone stuff their own how they like it with various fresh fruits. We also like to serve them with a fruit sauce topping & whipped cream. An important item to have is a good quality non-stick "crepe" pan. This really helps with the flipping of the crepes. Fantastic for breakfast or brunch!

My teenage daughters and their friends request this for breakfast after sleepovers. I substituted Irish whisky and it was amazing.

I've made crepes b/4. These are great and very easy. I wanted to made a sweet savory crepe so added rum (didn't have brandy) and left out vanilla but included the sugar (brown). Tasted great & the consistency was creamy. Wrapped the crepes around a spinach/feta cheese egg. Fancy and delicious!

I altered it slightly, but I also think the recipe would be great as is. I sub'd 1/3 cup Grand Marnier for the brandy and filled up the remainder of the measuring cup up to 1/2 cup with vanilla instead of just the tsp of vanilla in the recipe. I also added almost a teaspoon of orange zest. Beautiful flavor. If you've never made crepes before, don't think that Pam spray will be a good substitute for butter. Melt the butter and spread it with a pastry brush on each flip of each crepe. That's where the flavor comes from, and oooh that flavor. Take a look at the Grand Marnier Crepe Cake recipe. These crepes would be perfect with that.

This is the best! The flavor is of the crepes are great by themselves. I froze them and reheated later. They are still great! This is a keeper.

Totally delicious. The brandy is responsible for a lot of the flavor, so I wouldn't leave it out--if you're concerned about the alcohol content, just use less of it. I used 3 tbsp. butter, and none in the non-stick pan, and they were still rich, lovely, nicely golden-brown, and crispy on the edges. There's really no need to use more. These were wonderful with powdered sugar, lemon, and fruit. For dessert I might try more indulgent toppings, but these are rich enough to be a treat on their own. (This will be my standard recipe, I'm sure, though I'll probably try it with two eggs, and using 2% milk to see what effects those changes have.)

Just joined this site so I could review this recipe....I live in Canada but I come from England - I was really missing a nice pancake recipe so I thought I'd try this - I didn't add the brandy or Vanilla - I just wanted a basic pancake mix.

These were very easy to make and delicious. We left out the brandy and spread jam and powdered sugar on them. I accidently put the 5 tablespoons of butter into the batter before melting it. The batter after blending was a bit lumpy, which was solved with 1 minute in the microwave before putting the flour in. My 6 yr. own son has now asked that we make these for all holidays!

I learned how to make crepes in France, but came home without a recipe because Murielle doesn't have a written recipe.

What liquid did they substitute?

I'm an American who lived in France for many years, and I can tell you that there are as many ways to make crêpes as there are to make gazpacho in Spain. I prefer mine more "salé" than "sucré"; however, these were a great rich, sweet crêpe and we really enjoyed them for brunch. (My normal recipe, from a friend in Paris, involves less butter and no sugar). The fact that this recipe came from a Frenchwoman, and that another called it "putrid," just goes to show.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and I find it exceptional. For those of you who omit the brandy because of children I would suggest that you are missing the flavor. The alcohol evaporates while cooking, leaving the essence (flavor) of the brandy. I leave the mixture to sit for about an hour to let the flout absorb the liquids. I also use a large covered frying pan sitting in another pan with simmering hot water to hold the cooked crepes. Keeps them nice and hot without drying out. Bon Appetit.

I made this with Amaretto--it was terrific! I doubled the recipe and used a 6 qt Kitchenaid Mixer instead of the blender. It worked just fine. I also made them a little bigger--used about 1/2 cup per crepe. Cooked 2 1/2 min on first side, 1 min on second side. Stored in oven at 220 until I was ready to fill and serve. I used the Nutella and powdered sugar/home made whipped cream on top. Fabulous!!!!!

I have always been intimidated by crepes but decided to brave it. This was the first recipe to catch my eye and the previous reviews were positively glowing so I gave it a go. I must say I was NOT disappointed. I did not have any alcohol on hand so I added a 1/2 a teaspoon extra of Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and I used half and half instead of whole milk which made it a little too thick. I used salted butter because that is what I had on hand and 1/8 teaspoon salt. It was great!! I will make it the way the recipe suggests and then let you all know how that goes!! This one is a keeper.

I've only made this once for breakfast for my husband and my 2 year old son but I had to chime in here about how delicious and easy this recipe was! Only variation was omitting the brandy since this was a family breakfast. I had 3 burners going (one crepe pan and 2 regular nonstick pans) so we didn't sit around watching the other person eat. We rolled ours with fruit spread and finished it off with powdered sugar. Since then, I bought Nutella and lemon curd and can't wait to make this again. It's so easy and so delicious! Much easier than the other recipes I've used in the past!

Delicious. Simple. What more could one ask for? This was my first try at making crepes and I was how amazed how easy it was.

A great way to begin a Saturday!

Hey! My first crepes and they were pretty good. These are super easy and actually hard to screw up. No brandy in the house for some reason, so I used, ahem, Captain Morgan's spiced rum -- it was that or tequila:-) My cast iron pan worked best I think. I'm looking forward to experimenting with fillings...Nutella sounds awesome!

My boyfriend and I travel to Paris once a year or so and LOVE to go to this one particular crepe stand in the Latin Quarter. I have tried about 12 to 15 recipes for Crepes in the last two years trying to duplicate the texture and flavor we find there, without luck. This recipe nailed it. I made them with Nutella and sliced bananas the first time, and then Nutella and sliced strawberries the next time. We have them for dessert, not breakfast, but they are splendid.

I have traveled all over Europe, spent months in France, and eaten many a crepe. I think these crepes are pretty darn good. But if I didn't, I would not be so RUDE as to say they are "putrid" I would simply say they were not to my liking. Americans may not have the reputation for cooking that the French have, but at least we have some tact.

It's been a while sine I've made crepes, so I felt a bit rusty at the cooking part. This was the easiest crepe batter I've ever made, partly because it's all in the blender, and there is no waiting time between making batter and cooking it. I added less butter in the mix (only 3 tablespoons) but they still tasted great, the problem I had was that about 1 inch around the edges was becoming very crispy... I don't know what I did wrong, I don't remember having this problem in the past with other recipes.

These crepes are a delicious dish for any meal of the day, and they are a quick fix. I like to omit the brandy. Also, I add jelly & cottage cheese to my crepes to liven them up.

In sum, yum! I've found my first 4-fork recipe on this site. My husband and I are in love (with these crepes, of course) and I've already made them about four times. The recipe cautions not to let the butter smoke and burn in the pan. But do! Your crepes will come out looking exactly as if you have just bought them from a street vendor in Paris. These crepes, which keep excellently as batter in the fridge for up to a week if you can't finish the whole batch in one meal, go extremely well topped by the "Peach and Berry Salad," also on this site. (This was also a great recipe for using some of the whiskey we have stashed in a closet, drunk only by my Dad on his infrequent visits from Pittsburgh.)
