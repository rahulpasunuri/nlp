I was not pleased with this dish. The broccoli puree was too bland for my taste and the balls would not hold together while frying. I tried to change it up and wrap the cheese in egg roll dough, it turned out okay but the puree made it just a very bland meal for my family. By wrapping the cheese in egg role dough it made them taste like cream cheese wantons (which I happen to love). I tried to add flavor to the puree by adding about a Tbs. of Tomato paste, but it still was not enough. I did not have the inclination to mess with the puree and find the right spices to make it more zesty. Overall will not be making this dish again.

This tasted great, but I found the proportions to be odd. I was left with a lot of leftover flour after I had floured the dumplings and way too much batter for dipping. There was also a lot of broccoli sauce left over. I guess I would make twice as many dumplings or halve the other ingredients.

I made this as the first course for my first ever dinner party (not to be the last). The presentation was so beautiful that it set the tone for the rest of the night. The dumplings were very fragile when pulling out of the oil because of the thin batter. I had thickened it a bit with some flour and extra seasonings, but there were a couple leaky spots with burnt cheese. (No one really minded, though.) The flavors complemented each other nicely.

This is a 2 part review. 1. The broccoli sauce was very good. The flavor was mild and complemented the cheese very well. 2. The cheese 'dumplings', on the other hand, didn't look at all like what I expected. The batter was way too thin. Consequently, the coating was unable to hold in the cheese which spread throughout the cooking oil. When I removed the cheese, it looked like mashed potatoes randomly covered with brown bits. It may be that the others who made this dish adjusted the amount of flour in the batter. Mine looked like a thin tempura batter. If you try this recipe, my suggestion is to use less water and make the batter heavier....

Thought this was divine! I made the broccoli sauce the consistency of a marinara so it was enough flavour but not overwhelming. To the cook who brought down the ratings average by complaining about the cost of the cheeses: Since when are recipes from Bon Appetit and Gourmet written for common households? The recipes are for those who appreciate fine foods.

My husband was a big fan of this dish. What's not to love about fried cheese?

I just made this side dish tonight and have to print the recipe for my files. Perhaps because my husband loves cheese or perhaps because I like serving him vegetables in disguise, this recipe is a keeper. Normally if serving cheese and vegetables, I serve the cheese on top of the vegetables. I enjoyed the variation of vegetables on top of the cheese. I served this alongside chicken breasts with tomato sauce. In response to the previous reviewers, the cost of this cheese is far less than most of the other cheese Bon Appetit's recipes call for; I spent only $3.00 together, which is less than the price per pound of cheddar cheese here. I did add 1/2 cup chicken broth (didn't have any vegetable stock on hand) when reheating the broccoli sauce. My sauce had slipped out of the bowl I refrigerated it in almost like jello, so I needed to add some liquid to it.

My problem with this recipe is not the price of the cheese - I think acceptable mozarella and ricotta is available at most better-class supermarkets. What would be helpful would be to know what the approx. consistency of the broccoli/potato puree should be - after all, I can drain and stop the cooking on the broccs withoput all those elaborate instructions.

The cost of the cheeses put this delicious recipe beyond the "common" household.
