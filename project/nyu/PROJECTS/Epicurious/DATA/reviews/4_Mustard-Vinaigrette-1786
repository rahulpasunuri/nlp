I loved this recipe. It was so popular that my fiancee has requested we use it again, even if not with the menu suggested on epicurious, and see what else we can use it with. :)

I made the mustard vinaigrette for the roast chicken recipe. I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used Marsala wine instead. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

I didn't have shallots so I omited that. Also did not have dijon or white wine vinegar. I had to substitute Spicy Brown Mustard and Rice wine vinegar. Too tart. So I added sugar to even it out. It was really good. Bet it's great if you have the exact ingrediants.

This was great on grilled chicken breasts. Ran out of rosemary so I used primarily sage - still tasted great. Will definitely make again!

I've been making this since it appeared in B.A. in 1994....it's easy, DELICIOUS, and I always get raves. A perfect recipe for entertaining!

DELICOUS - I made this for the potato salad and it was amazing. I'd use it to dress a regular salad or as a marinade as well. 3/4 of a cup of olive oil felt like a lot, so I tasted it after 1/2 a cup and liked the flavor, but added a 1/4 cup of water to thin it out a bit.

I initially made this for the haricot verts potato salad on this site. I had some of the vinaigrette left over and decided to marinate tilapia filets in it for a few hours before throwing them on the grill. What a wonderful combination! To quote my husband "Write this one down!"

I used dried herbs and green onions instead of shallots (what I could find). I also ran 1/2 cup short on the olive oil (thought I had enough) and filled in with 1/2 cup water. I thought it was great. I bet it's good on fish or chicken, too. Really, really tasty.

This is a perfect recipe. This vinaigrette has ended up in so many dishes. I have omitted the sage on occasion for a lighter, "summery" flavor. The roasted chicken with this is outrageous.

Delicious on shrimp salad; I took it to work every day last week! Would also be delicious on potato salad I would think.

The herbs and dijon mixed wonderfully... I only added 1/2 cup of oil to cut down on the fat content, and it didn't affect the taste at all!!
