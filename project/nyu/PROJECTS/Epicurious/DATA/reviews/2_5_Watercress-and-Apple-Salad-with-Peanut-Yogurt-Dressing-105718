I've used green apples (Granny Smith) for a more "acid" touch and replaced peanut butter with almond butter (I am cooking for my blood type B); you may also adjust the amount of lime juice to your likening. This recipe is definitely worth a healthy try. Bon appetit!

This salad was a lot more bland than I expected. Actually the flavor of the dressing was good, but very subtle. Not everyone appreciated it. One of the tasters actually said, for example, that it tasted like miracle whip with sugar in it. Uuuugh. Also, some of the people at the dinner actually avoided eating the apples. So, what's the point? I'd say this recipe is good only for people who are interested in trying new and very subtle flavors. Maybe adding a few more ingredients like sunflower seeds and dried cherries might enliven it a little.
