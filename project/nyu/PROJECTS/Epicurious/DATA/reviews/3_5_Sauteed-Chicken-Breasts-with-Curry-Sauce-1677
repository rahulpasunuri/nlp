This was a very good dish. It is simple. I did not bother with the egg separating, I used 3 whole eggs. My husband had seconds! So that is always a huge plus.

This was a great recipe...I make it time and again. Its a kind of no brainer when your in a hurry. I love this recipe!!!

Excellent. I really enjoyed that. Low fat, full of flavor, and easy to prepare (a little messy). I halved the recipe since I was making it only for myself -- I made bangers and mash for my British husband -- he'd rather eat pork than chicken!

This dish is OK. It is not at all an authentic curry, nor does it taste like anything Indian. It's what I imagine I'd get if I ordered the "Indian curry special" at Denny's. If you do make it though, I'd recommend 1) using a very good curry, because this is all you'll taste, and 2) using 1 egg, 1 egg white, and watering this down with water. I did it as written, and had very scrambled eggy chicken.

This was absolutely delicious!! The only thing I changed was to add salt and pepper to the flour and 1/4 cup of heavy cream to the sauce a minute before adding the chicken to the sauce.

I liked this recipe, especially the sauce. Wanted it to be more spicy though, but it was so creamy and good.

Relatively quick and easy. Added cayenne as suggested and twice the garlic (always do that anyway). Would suggest salt and pepper on chicken breast before sauteeing. Good weeknight dish. Probably would not make for guests.

we really enjoyed this quick and easy dish - I will definitely make it again and perhaps add a little more curry.

Bleck! How disappointing. I don't know what they were talking about with 2 minutes cooking time on each side & my "sauce" kept gumming up. I added cayenne and cumin in hopes to get more flavour, but the curry was so mild it was hardly noticable. I will not waste my time making this dish again...

We really enjoyed this dish! We did doctor it with extra and hot curry (v. good quality) cayenne pepper, more garlic and salt. The egg/flour coating came out thicker then I expected - next time I will use less flour. I served it over wilted spinach as we aren't really rice eaters. This was flavorful and spicy!

This recipe is fairly simple to make and was a hit with the kids as well. I served with jasmine rice and a mixture of cauliflour crumbs, tiny carrot cubes, and baby pea pods. Excellent combination. This dish will definitely make it to the monthly rotation for a while!

if you are expecting curry, don't make this. It is very mild as others have said and whilst it does not taste horrible or anything it is not very exciting. I doctored the sauce with more garlic, curry paste as suggested and even added a little milk to make it creamier. Incidentally, my children loved it but I think it had more to do with the chicken than the sauce. I too did what someone else did, added everything together and dipped the chicken in the resulting batter. Nice but not wow, hubby said he wouldn't care to eat it again so I won't be making it a second time.

A mild and very good curry dish. Think of it as an ethnically inspired American dish. I have been trying to expand the culinary horizons of my young children and they loved this. Next time, I would add some turmeric to round out the curry flavor. Also, I made the sauce with corn starch, which I prefer to use instead of flour. It was not cloudy and didn't have any floury thick taste.

Loved this chicken with the rice noodle dish on the side. Being Norwegian, there was plenty of spice for us but maybe not for others. A great way to introduce curry to the kids. They loved it too.

Very Good. Not a 4, but a strong 3. I too spiced it up with extra garlic and cayenne pepper.

My husband and I loved this dish it will be in the making for our quests. I paired this dish with rice noodles with cilantro, mint and peanuts a definite must.

I loved this recipe! You definitely have to use some more exotic curries like madras or hot curries. Dean and Deluca carry some nice ones..I think that makes all the difference. I added way more curry than suggested since we are big curry lovers at our house. This dish was fabulous and we added this to our "regular rotation" of dishes we love..

I have to agree with the other reviewers about the blandness. I added extra curry, garlic and cayenne but still found it lacking the rich flavor that I'm used to from a curry.

Very simple, very good recipe. We will be having this one again.

Great dish and easy to make. Always makes an impression at dinner parties.

I have made this recipe countless times since my husband brought it home over a year ago. It is his favorite! I doubled the sauce (to have more to put over rice) and made it a bit more garlicy, but the taste is pretty much unchanged. Also, for those who are concerned about its being bland, I use curries from a spice catalog and Asian food stores. They're spicer and more complex than the grocery-store varieties.

Can't review it right now as i am printing it out to make it again!!!!

I also made a batter out of the eggs & Flour,but I added an extra egg white,gave it a healthy dose of my 3 pepper blend and cut back on the curry. I changed the sauce completely..after removing the chicken, I threw in a chopped sweet onion, sauteed a tsp. of curry powder in the onion, then added a chopped red bell pepper and two cans of creamed corn. I returned the chicken to the sauce to heat through, and served the whole deal over pan fried chinese noodles(lo mein type) It was great! I'm gonna make it again

I have made this exactly like the recipe before and loved it. Last night, I salt and peppered some chicken thighs and browned them on the stove. Then I roasted them in the oven and when they were done, I doused them in the sauce made in this recipe and served it on rice with more sauce. It was delicious.

Love curry. This one, however, is bland and seems like a lot of mess for a so-so dinner. Even packaged sauces such as Golden make a much better curry than this. Sorry I wasted my time, and puzzled by the raves from other reviewers.

I made this last week, and I am SO glad there are leftovers. I love Indian foor, but my husband isn't crazy about it. But we both loved this one. It is a little mild, but it is still great.

A nice, warmly spiced dish. I jazz it up by increasing the amount of curry powder and garlic.

Okay...so I goofed and did something I NEVER do...I proceeded without reading all of the directions first and made a batter of the flour, eggs and other ingredients instead of using 2 steps...know what???It was wonderful!!! I did what others suggested and spiced it up with cayenne pepper. The results were fabulous!

I made this with 2 breasts and egg substitute. It was terrific!

It needs a little more kick. I found that a little cayenne takes it up to speed.

Somwwhat bland. It needs a kick.

This dish borders on comfort food, but the curry flavoring saves it from being too too bland. Quick to make. Reminiscent of another favorite (European) comfort food: veal cutlets. My toodler loved it too.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very good. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper & cayenne, and then added Tabasco to the sauce while it was cooking to add some additional flavor. When I make this recipe again, I would add even more seasonings - not for heat, just more flavor which would make this dish even more delicious.

Great dish and very easy. Following the notes of previous user, I only used 1 egg (no whites) with 2 chicken breasts, and it turned out great. Next time, I might skip making the gravy, as the sauteed chicken was excellent by itself--slightly crispy outside and very moist and tender.

We liked it! Had to pare it down for just 2 of us, so used 1 egg, no whites. Sorta guessed the rest of the measurements but it came out good.

Rating: 3
Quite easy...I used two whole eggs rather than whites. Also added some hot curry paste (which is really key since the dish is a little bland without it). Very tasty results!

Great dish, my 15 month old loved it. Basmati brown rice and peas; PERFECT! My husband wants me to make it again real soon.

Rating: 2
Fairly tasty and very kid-friendly (tender moist white-meat chicken gets 'em every time, regardlesss of the sauce), but rather one-dimensional flavor, and the cooking time was understated. Definitely needs an interesting, (fruited?) rice dish to accompany it.

This was absolutely delicious and a great success! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully.

Great easy recipe! I added one large can of mandarin oranges (drained) to the sauce and served the chicken over a fruited rice pilaf. Many compliments!

This was very yummy. We added some cayenne to the sauce also, because we like things spicy. We will definitely make this again.
