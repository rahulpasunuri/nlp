This is just an okay recipe. For a better shrimp po'boy recipe, check out my blog (http://betweencourses.blogspot.com/). There is also a great technique detailed there on how to make shrimp plump and crisp for any shrimp recipe.

I just can back from New Orleans and had a fabulous po' boy made with whole breaded shrimp that had a cajun flavor, not just cayenne. This recipe seems to lack the full flavor of what a po' boy was meant to have.

Even my kids, who aren't crazy about shrimp, loved this dinner. I used plain breadcrumbs, and I thought the shrimp was still very flavorful.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but have wanted it for several years. I LOVE Flo's. When we are visiting family near Murrell's Inlet we always stop for this sandwich and oysters on the half shell. If it so terrible, why is it packed every time we are there?

I have to admit to having never tried this recipe, but since I look to this site for advice I feel compelled to chime in with the others who have said the food at Flo's is terrible. I have eaten there and would never go back. Italian breadcrumbs in breading for a Po' Boy? Say no more....

If you try passing this sandwich off as a Po'Boy in New Orleans, (home of the authentic Po'Boy), you could get the death penalty for it. Real shrimp Po'Boys are made with whole, deep-fried shrimp, often beer battered, and they NEVER use Italian breadcrumbs. You have obviously, sadly, been sorely deprived of the exquisite pleasure of a real N.O. po'boy. Just as obviously, they ain't made in S.C.!! As a sort of shrimp patty sandwich, these are okay. I used freshly crushed saltine crackers instead of the breadcrumbs and cracker meal, only 1 egg, increased the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tspn, and added some horseradish. I was also careful to add the cracker crumbs a little at a time, AFTER I mixed everything else together, so I probably only used about 1/3 cup in the patty mix to get the texture right. Alot is going to depend on the shrimp you use. I wouldn't use good quality large shrimp for this, but every once in a while I can get small shrimp cheaply. This would be good for something different for lunch.

Even though I had the displeasure of actually eating at Flo's when I lived in South Carolina, I gave this recipe a chance. It stunk, just like the food I had when I ate there.

I decided to play it safe and used only 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. Turned out great! Also used a little mayo with the tartar sauce. Will definitely make again.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I thought the taste of the breadcrumbs overwhelmed the shrimp. Tasted too much like "filler". We needed lots of tartar sauce to give in any flavor. Bland and flat.
