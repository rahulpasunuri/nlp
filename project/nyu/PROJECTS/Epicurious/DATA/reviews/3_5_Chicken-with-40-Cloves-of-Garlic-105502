this seems like it would be really nice-BUT-not good. I use a lot of Gourmet's recipes, from their "best of" book...but this...I thought it looked easy & good. First-what a pain to peel 40 cloves of garlic. (but if recipe is great-who cares) Second-took way, way longer to cook than recipe, about 1 hour. (using less than 4lb chicken) Third-too much oil- So chicken ended up ok (barely), but I'd never, ever bother with this recipe again

Wonderful! Used less oil for 3 organic chicken breast halves and cooked for 20-25 minutes. The drama skyrocketed by adding 2 heads of black garlic I had been given. Cooked potato chunks along side but, will have to cut them smaller next time to allow for the shorter cooking time.

I was a charter subscriber to Bon Appetit and I remember a recipe by this name in an issue from about the same time. I was disappointed that this was not the same. I made the one from BA many times. If I recall, the garlic was put in the cavity and the pan unpeeled after rubbing the outside and cavity with a cut garlic clove and light salt and pepper. The secret to a moist chicken was to cook it on a rack with the breast down the first 40 minutes of the cooking time, then turning it over for the rest of the time so the breast would brown. I believe it was to be cooked 20 minutes per pound. The garlic could be squeezed out and used in a gravy or eaten with the chicken. There were several variations of the recipe. I would love to have the BA version again.

The chicken put off enough fat to be submerged and had a "cooked in soup" texture (overcooked) despite using dark meat thighs. The garlic was great...used it for garlic mashed potatoes afterwards.

This was really delicious and so easy, other than peeling all that garlic. I did halve the recipe, and use bone-in chicken breasts, because it's just my husband and I and I didn't want to eat roast chicken for days on end. I will definitely make this again, the smell was heavenly.

40 clove garlic chicken is one of the best and easiest things you can ever make. The only "hard" part is prepping the 40 cloves of garlic. It's incredibly delicious, subtle, rich, and the sweet roasted garlic is so good for spreading on bread and chicken both. I usually make this with chicken pieces as opposed to the whole chicken, but chicken + garlic = delicious no matter how you do it.

My guests loved this chicken. I used half the oil, tripled the rosemary, thyme and sage and left out the bay leaf and parsley. I also threw a few extra cloves and herbs inside the chicken. It's such great comfort food served with roasted cabbage and mashed potatoes. The garlic is wonderful spread on bread (I mixed some with olive oil and left some with the juices for people to drizzle wherever).

Other than using less oil this recipe is great "AS IS". I have tried other versions and this is by far the most simple and tasty one. I am sure it is good with chicken pieces but it is superb with the whole bird

I have made this twice. The first time I tried using Chicken Breasts and it was terrible. The breast meat just doesn't have enough fat in it for the meat to become tender. The second time I used thighs and the results were wondrous and the guests were wowed. I browned the thighs in olive oil, prior to placing in roasting pan, but never came close to using a full cup of oil. I served with a rustic crusty bread because you just don't want to waste those juices.

Haven't made the chicken yet, but I had to write in-- my mother grew up in Kaiserslautern....

Everyone is dead on with using pieces vs. whole bird, and halving the oil. I took the time to brown the cloves in the oil with two thai peppers and lemon zest before adding the chicken back for the oven. I also did 3x rosemary sprigs, 2x thyme, and the single sage. Everything else was pretty much the same. All I can say is 'wow'. Wonderful full garlic flavor that is not overbearing. Enjoy with some similarly roasted new potatoes, cucumber/onion salad, and a half dry German white!!! And friends or love of course ;-) Cheers from Kaiserslautern! NCF

I followed the instructions for browing the chicken--although I used chicken pieces. Then put the chicken and the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot for about 4 hours. Turned out really great! I have also done this without browning the chicken and while it still tastes good, it looks anemic. This is great with couscous and roasted vegetables. If you use the crockpot your oven is free for the vegetables.

I love this recipe. I have made a couple of variations, but this one is my favorite. I use 4 1/2 lbs of chicken pieces-- breasts and thighs, and just use the oil that it takes to brown the chicken--probably about a 1/3 cup total. I brown the garlic (i just buy pre- peeled garlic--much less hassle) and celery in the same pan as the chicken for about 3 minutes, too. I also either add about 1/2 a diced preserved lemon to the pot before putting into the oven or add a few squeezes of meyer lemon after the chicken has roasted. I did not run into any problems with the cooking temperature--it took about 45 minutes to roast, and both the breasts and thighs were perfectly cooked. I did not find that the chicken needed to be basted at all. This is great comfort food that can be prepared surprisingly quickly.

really delicious and tender. Used chicken pieces instead of whole chicken. Used 1/2 of suggested oil. Added 1/4 cup mixture of rice wine and chicken broth. Extra salt and paprika added. Garnish with fresh parsley and green onions. Would def. make this again.

Totally agree with the other reviews - it takes like 30 minutes just to get the paper off the garlic and that it takes closer to 90 minutes to cook the chicken. Fabulous recipe. The only thing that I will do in the future is use a clay pot to bake the chicken in. It doesn't need basting and it's the best way ever to cook poultry.

This was absolutely yummy! As suggested by another reviewer, I cut the oil to half the suggested amount-and it was just fine that way. This chicken was so wonderfully flavorful and so moist and tender it practically fell off the bone. I also put some herbs in the cavity of the chicken in addition to additional garlic cloves in there and it added great flavor. My guests just raved about this! I also took the lid off 30 min prior to it being done (It did take about 90 min) and it got a little brown on the outside, but not as much as I would have liked-so I think I'll take the lid off sooner next time.

The chicken was juicy and delicious and the garlic was buttery and mellow. It was a great dish. I took the advice of a previous commenter and cut the oil to half, which worked well. My only criticism is that I would have liked the chicken to be a bit more crispy. Next time I'll try taking the lid off after half an hour (it definitely did need an hour to cook.)

I had high hopes but this recipe is a pain in the ass. It uses too much oil (half would be fine!) and if you don't use a Le Creuset style enameled pot, it will stick like hell during the browning process and all the skin comes off. I used my good All Clad pot (which I have successfully browned and turned other large items) and I had the worst time. Then, as a reviewer below said... it's been 1.25 hour and I'm still sitting here waiting for my dinner to be done. Meanwhile my accompaniments are getting soggy and cold. I'm glad I don't have guests waiting! If I make a version of this again it will be using chicken pieces, like James Beard's version. ARGH.

Love this recipe. My friend turned me on to this many years ago. My method is by slow cooker. Once prepared, by rendering the fat in a frying pan, the chicken is placed in the slow cooker along with the remainder of the ingredients, including a little white wine. From time to time I've used the pre-peeled garlic (in the large container)from Costco's. I've also cooked this on low before leaving for work in the a.m. By the time I arrive home it's done to a turn. Surprisingly, this isn't overcooked.

There is a reason this is a classic, it's amazing. I've made it twice now. The first time as instructed and the last time at the end of the roasting process I threw in some carrots, onions, zucchini and summer squash. It was so good we just couldn't stop picking at it all night.

A much milder dish than you expect! My family loves garlic so we often add 50-70 cloves. It takes longer than 15 minutes to prepare though (even using the smash and shuck method of garlic peeling). Save the garlic and make a wonderful spread to go with a nice hot loaf of crusty bread,umm umm good.

My whole family loves this chicken!! As a time saver, I use peeled garlic in a jar. Also, I cook it in a browning bag instead, so there is no basting. So tender and juicy!!! This is a regular at our house.

Since you don't use all the garlic, much easier to just peel rough skin off of garlic heads and and slice cross wise. Place in pan "open side up." After cooking, squeeze out garlic in to mashed potatoes or emulsify in to a reduced white wine gravy.

My husband and I have been making this recipe for many years. It's so good but forget peeling all those garlics. Our original recipe from a Provencal cookbook said put them in unpeeled and when they are cooked squeeze out the yummy garlic and put it on the baquette. It's so much easier.

I made this following Emiril's rendition. I only lopped off the ends of the cloves, placed the herbs (sans sage) inside the cavity, poured 1/2 cup of white wine over it just before placing into the oven at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. Everything else was the same including 1 cup of chopped celery under the chicken with the garlic. Fantastic! four forks!

Would make this again, but the recipe's stated active prep time of 15 minutes was vastly underestimated... Took me much longer than that just peeling the 40 cloves of garlic. But it was tasty when all said and done -- and with amilder garlic flavor than one would have expected

The chicken doesn't taste like garlic - strongly or otherwise. I gave it only 2 forks because, as another reviewer stated, 30 minutes is certainly not long enough even if you can find a decent 4# chicken. Better to put a head of garlic with the top lopped off inside the chicken, salt the whole thing and roast it. The whole chicken is perfumed and you don't have to worry about fussing with it.

I cut the chicken in half before cooking. Took more than 40 minutes in the oven. Wonderful flavor. Served with baked potatoes - mashed the garlic into the potatoes.

This was a nice dish. I'd use the technique again, even if I didn't follow there recipe to the letter. The dark meat pieces turned out much better than the breasts - this dish is slightly flavorful, but a bit more mild than I like my food. The roasted garlic bits were the best part!

This is a great recipe. I usually use just chicken breasts, instead of the whole chicken, that seems to cut down on the time. Also, we add more spices, and serve with some crusty french bread.

I don't know how the chicken gets cooked in 30-40 minutes. Mine was in the oven for 1.5 hours and still could have been in there longer to be really tender (and this was free range French farm chicken). The garlic wasn't as soft as it should have been either. Could have achieved better results by stuffing chicken with the herbs, cutting tops off heads of garlic and roasting them together as usual.
