I used some reviewer suggestions--added a yellow bell pepper, shredded chicken breast, sesame oil, used hot sauce instead of chili garlic oil, and white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar. Seemed a little dry, so I also added about 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. This was easy and very good.

I made the dressing from three different Asian noodle salads recipes from this site using peanut butter. This recipe was far superior than the others. Make sure you thoroughly drain your noodles of all liquid or it will dilute the flavor of the dressing. I added a little more peanut butter because I wanted a more peanuty taste and a little more sesame oil. The amount of chili garlic paste called for didn't give it much spice so if you want your dressing spicier, add a little more. I wanted more color and veggies in my salad so added julienned red, yellow and orange bell peppers and sugar snap peas cut diagonally. I think shredded chicken would be a good addition if you want some meat in it.

Great, with some tweaks to make it healthier and more flavorful. I used 1 lb whole wheat linguine, low sodium soy sauce, "lite" rice vinegar, and creamy almond butter. I cut the rice vinegar in half, cut the honey to 1.5 tbsp and upped the almond butter to 4 tbsp. I also added the juice of 1/2 lime and 1 tsp minced ginger from a jar. I tossed the noodles with 1.5 lbs cooked broccoli florets, a cucumber cut into matchsticks, and 1 lb baked tofu cut into small chunks. I served with cilantro and scallions on the side, so that people could add to their liking. Very tasty and light -- this one's a keeper, especially for summer potlucks.

This is the fastest, easiest recipe for Sesame Noodles I've ever made, and every bit as delicious as more complicated ones. I used 1 lb. of linguine fini and found that one and one-half recipes of sauce was the right amount for me. I also cut the amount of honey in half and omitted the chili-garlic sauce as I didn't have it on hand, but I added a dash or two of hot sauce for a little zip (I don't like super-hot food). I had tahini in the fridge so I used that and the taste was fantastic! Shredded up some leftover chicken and threw in a couple of cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and cut into matchsticks, along with the scallions and cilantro. What a delicious one-bowl meal, especially for a hot, steamy night! I'm going to be making this a lot this summer.

This is a quick & simple recipe that can easily be tweaked to be whatever you want, as you can tell from the previous reviews. Loved it! 4 forks as it took less than 10 minutes to make & was delicious.

I loved this! The dressing is delish. I added carrots, bell peppers, and chicken. Next time, I'm going to try it with shrimp. I've not cooked with tahini before, but it was well worth purchasing a can of it for this recipe.

Pretty good and easy to make! Added carrots, peppers and cucumbers for texture. I would add less rice vinegar next time.

Sooo good!! Made mine with bits of steamed broccoli and baked tofu. Made the sauce exactly according to recipe but next time I'll double the cilantro and scallions and add more chili garlic sauce. Ate it next to the cabbage and lime salad on smittenkitchen.com and it was amazing! A great lunch for a hot summer day.

This is soooo good! I was grabbing tastes of this before dinner-great summer dish! I used ramen noodles, and they worked perfectly. I used a whole bunch of scallions (white and light green parts) and bean sprouts. For the dressing I added some soy sauce-it came out very well. Very easy to make, and inexpensive, too.

YUM!! Definitely be careful on how much chili garlic sauce you add. A little goes a long way. Really excellent noodles. Tastes like dan dan mien - a Chinese noodle staple.

I have been searching (though not very hard) for a good Cold Sesame Noodle recipe for a few years and this is by far the best I've found yet. I actually added sprouts and doubled the amount of cilantro in it because I love cilantro and the sprouts add a bit of crunch. The sauce is excellent and you can omit the Chili Garlic Sauce if you want it a bit more mild - I added extra for more heat. Its a very good recipe - I've made it a few times!!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I made it without the cilantro. I also omitted the honey, but it turned out really tasty and was easy as could be.

this recipe has too much vinegar...it actually made me kind of queazy..

Easy to make. Great tasting. My boys love it. Be careful of how much chili-garlic sauce you "add." It becomes much more powerful after it sits in the fridge a bit. Better to stick to the teaspoon and add later if needed.

This is easy to prepare and has good taste. Use 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of sesame paste to make a richer, creamier sauce.

Exceptionally easy for something so fresh and tasty. We double the green onions and cilantro, and halve the honey. I add roasted red pepper strips, steamed green beens and shrimp, and lots more pepper sauce. Yum! Leftovers are wonderful to take in lunch. This is now in a bi-weekly rotation at our house.

I made this for a picnic everyone really like this salad. Next time I am going to add more veggies to it like peas, celery and bamboo shoots. This is just as good or better than the stuff you get in the deli.

This was one of the best recipes of this sort I've seen. This is definitely as good as I could get from a local takeout.

Very easy and delicious. Tried it with sesame paste as well as peanut butter. Liked the sesame the best. Great with shrimp too. Nice balance of flavors
