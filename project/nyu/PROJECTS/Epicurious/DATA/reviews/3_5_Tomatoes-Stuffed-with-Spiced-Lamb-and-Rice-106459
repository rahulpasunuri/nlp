I made this recipe once back in 2003 and still remember it fondly to this day. The tomatoes came out perfectly -- firm enough to hold the stuffing in, but completely melted in your mouth. And the lamb was nicely flavored with mint, red wine, and cinnamon.

I used brown rice and olive oil rather than butter and tossed some fresh corn into the stuffing, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. We really liked it, and it was a good use of beefsteak tomatoes that were not as flavorable as I would have liked-- baked this way they had much more flavor.

I made this recipe as written but then made a sauce to go with it. I sauteed 2 garlic cloves, half a chopped onion in some olive oil still softened then added 4 large tomatoes from my garden, 1Tbls of cinnamon a pinch of saffron, chili flakes, salt and pepper to taste. Cook till the tomatoes have fallen apart, puree then push through a sieve. Put the tomato puree back in the pot and reduce to the desired consistency. With this sauce my lamb stuffed tomatoes were fabulous!

I chopped up some leftover lamp chops instead of the ground lamb, added lots of salt & pepper as suggested by previous folks, and I thought it was yummy! I will definitely make it again.

If you are like I was, searching for a good stuffed tomato recipe that incorporates ground meat and rice, do not dispair; this recipe has potential! Adding fresh herbs, spices, citrus and some sweet flavors definitely helps. I added lemon juice, fresh basil, chili flakes, raisins, a litttle sugar and feta to the existing recipe, salted the tomatoes and left out the bread crumbs and parmesan mixture on the top. The flavors were delicious and reminded me of the stuffed tomatoes I had in Greece.....fabulous!

I do not like mint, so I omit the mint in the recipe and add a tad extra cinnamon and some extra parsley. If ground lamb is not available at the grocery store, I will substitute ground beef or ground buffalo. The recipe definatly needs salt, and fresh tomatoes that are in season. But with the right seasoning and fresh tomatoes, this dish is delicious!

I took the advice of the previous reviews and added salt, pepper and garlic to the mixture and salted the tomatoes before filling, but they were still very bland. I don't think this recipe can be saved and I wouldn't bother making it.

The dish was bland until I added salt, pepper and fresh garlic. I omitted the cinnamon because I don't like it with meat and added more mint and parsley. I also used olive oil instead butter when cooking the onions, and I drained the meat mixture before adding the rice.

I like the variety of ingredients--lamb is a nice change--but the recipe didn't call for any salt or pepper, which left the stuffing mixture a bit bland. I added a dash of garlic powder and some salt, but I would use more mint, more salt, and more pepper next time. I served it with sugar snap peas and squeezed a fresh lemon over all of it, which also helped.

There was nothing special about this recipe. The tomato was bland and should be salted prior to stuffing. The stuffing was fine, nothing spectacular though.
