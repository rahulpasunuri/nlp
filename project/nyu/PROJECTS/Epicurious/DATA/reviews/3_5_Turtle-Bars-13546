Update: These bars leaked the delicious caramel after slicing. The problem might be using dark brown sugar rather than light: the greater molasses content may affect the finished product. Also, I didn't refrigerate them. Still good, but messy.

Toasted walnuts, addictive caramel, a hint of chocolate in the base: these are delightful and easy to eat. OK with regular corn syrup. The base is liquid but it baked up fine--no typo there, and there's no need to chop nuts. I wouldn't drizzle chocolate on top, though they feature nuts and caramel more than chocolate. Maida Heatter has a very similar recipe called Walnut Dreams, I think, which is a more suitable name.

The best part of the recipe is the caramel mixture. I'm going to keep it but I wasn't too thrilled about the chocolate. I'd suggest seeking a better recipe for the base. Oh and I'd chop the walnuts.

I haven't made this yet but I think there is a typo. I read reviews that said there is too little crust. I'm sure it is supposed to read 1 1/4 cups of flour and not 1/4 cup.

First thing - Jana from St. Louis reviewed the turtle bars from this site but from Bon Apetite Mag, not Gourmet! Second, these bars are really delicious. My only criticism is the size pan recommended. My brownie crust was almost paper thin so I quickly redid that part in an 8x8-inch pan and was glad that I did because the caramel cools quickly and I never would have been able to spread it over the entire pan. To make a long story short, definitely go with a smaller pan. About 1/2 cup less nuts also. I also used pecans.

I first made this recipe in 1991 and took it to a pot luck at my college. It is fun to make,really delicious,and it makes a great impresion if you are a Grad student, I think it helped me get my graduate degree!

I would make this again but instead of spreading semisweet chocolate on top, drizzle milk chocolate so you can taste carmel. Also, less butter is okay for the crust.

these were delicious but lacking in the cookie department, I think next time I will double the base butleave the topping alone as it was perfect.

Made it with pecans. This stuff is dangerous!

Love this recipe! I used whole toasted pecans instead of walnuts. Be sure to let the wax paper overlap the sides of the pan to help getting the bars out. Also, this is very easy to double. Since you are going to all that work already, might as well get 2 pans of the treats!

I didn't think this was totally awesome like most of the other reviewers. There's better bars out there.

This recipes was easy and great. I melted chocolate and piped it on top for added effect- adds to the presentation factor. Highly reccomend this recipe
