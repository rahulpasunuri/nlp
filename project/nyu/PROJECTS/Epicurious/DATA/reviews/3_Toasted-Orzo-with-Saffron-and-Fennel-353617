I rarely scrape leftovers into the trash after a meal, but there was no chance I wanted to see this on my plate again. In a hurry, I did not read the reviews before I tried putting this together, although realized pretty soon that I needed to throw a couple more handfuls of orzo into the pot. Bland, boring and weird, with the essentially raw fennel tossed on top (although I did steam it for a few minutes to soften). Fennel is expensive where I live, and I imagine saffron is pricey everywhere. I want my money back!

Ridiculous. Doesn't someone actually cook these recipes before they are posted? 9 ounces of orzo is a cup and and a half, which is what this recipe would require. Do you like raw chopped fennel with your orzo? That's exactly what you'll get if you follow this recipe. If you like your fennel cooked put it in when you add the liquid. With a few corrections this recipe is pretty good. As written it's inedible.

What a dull dish! From the reviews I was hoping for a decent side dish, but even substituting chicken broth for the water, this one was a total dud. Lacking any real flavor or balance, the only way to even eat it was with lots of pepper. Skip this and look for another easy pasta as a side

Just okay. The saffron and fennel are a wonderful flavor combination, but somehow this dish just ended up falling a bit flat.

This recipe was fine, nothing spectacular but not horrible either. The flavors came across too delicate and the saffron got completely lost. I don't think I'll make it again, it not being worth the effort.

Exceptional dish! I am very thankful to the others that caught the error in the amount of orzo--1.5 cups was perfect. I did substitute the water for broth. I added a touch of white wine. The fennel fronds at the end were great touch on top. Made this with the Greek-Style Mahi, Mahi--perfect together!

Definitely 1 1/2 C or Orzo, instead of 1/2 C. I love it with the Greek Mahi!

This recipe contains an error!!! I was reading through reviews of it coming out mushy and soggy and I went back to the original issue and it is 1 and 1/2 cups of orzo, not the 1/2 cup that is listed in the online version!

Despite the bad reviews, I made this with the Greek style mahi mahi, and I thought it was pretty good. I used 1 and 1/2 cups orzo, and substituted some of the water with chicken stock and white wine. I think it's supposed to be kind of a subtle flavor, because at least paired with the suggested dish, it can soak up some of the sauce and juices from the fish. I liked it overall

I made a couple of little modifications... Instead of red onion, I used shallot, I substituted chicken stock for 1/2 cup water, and added a little fresh lemon juice at the end to brighten it up a little. My boyfriend loved it.

i am a big fan of orzo but dont usually make it this way. i used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 of white wine with 1 1/2 cups of orzo and it turned out well. i agree the flavours were a little subtle and i think next time i might add fennel seeds to toast with the orzo. i liked how the fennel itself only cooked slightly. i served this with the greek style mahimahi and the combination was quite successful. healthy and light spring diner.

Is 1/2 cup of orzo correct for 2 cups of water? -- something is not right -- the recipe came out bland and mushy.

I doubled this for a large party and it just tasted blah. I wasn't working in my own kitchen, but it needed something more.

made with Greek mahimahi as well; used just under a cup of orzo and a little over a cup of liquid: combined homemade chicken stock and water and had no problem with sticking or it being undercooked. Did add fennel a little sooner than called for, but since it ended up sitting a little longer, probably didn't need to. Had more of the mayo & feta mix for the mahi than I needed, so added a bit to the orzo just before serving, which probably helped with the (lack of) salty flavor others mentioned. Good combination with the mahi and tomato salad.

I made this recipe and liked it quite a bit, but I ended up having to add more water (twice) to get the orzo completely cooked through. In addition, I added the fennel about halfway through the simmering process because I was unsure if my family would like it raw. I served it with the mahi-mahi and it made a sophisticated but fairly easy family meal.

Me again - I felt the need to come back and re-comment. I just pulled this orzo out of the fridge and ate it cold for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious! I just had to figure out how I like it best, apparently. Cold it is!

This was okay, but I probably won't make it again. The flavors didn't work for me as a summertime dish, or paired with the Greek-Style Mahi Mahi.

I found it to be pretty bland. I would definitely increase the saffron to 1/2 tsp and let it steep longer. It definitely needed more salt and a healthy dose of fresh cracked pepper. I'd think twice before making this again.

Perhaps the 9 oz. of orzo is by weight, not by volume, joelmc? Most dry ingredients are measured by weight, whereas wet ingredients are measured by volume. eddybacher, not all Web browsers will render 1/2 as a special character...though I do think if it is not possible to use the 1/2 special character, there should be a space between 1 and 1/2 as in 1 1/2 instead of 11/2

NINE ounces would be just over ONE CUP, would it not? So why does the recipe say "1/2 cup (9 ounces)"? Other than that confusion, this is the type of different side dish I've been looking for--easy to make with simple flavours to compliment fish or chicken, but can't see it with beef.

I thought this was good, but agree with the cook from Indianapolis that it needed something salty. I just put some salt on it and that did it. Maybe capers? IDK. Pretty good. Although, I really like fennel, so perhaps I'm biased. I did also find that the orzo stuck to the bottom of the pan.

This was a great recipe. I made it to go with the Greek Mahi Mahi. It had a great flavor and was quick and easy to do. I will for sure make again.

Certainly Epicurious' webmaster has the ability to type 11/2 as 1½, using special characters. The webmaster doesn't seem to care whether the recipe is easily readable or not. This is an ongoing problem along with ingredient links that don't look like links.

I loved the concept of this dish, and it did have a good texture, though you really need a heavy-bottomed saucepan so that this doesn't stick and burn. I liked the perfume of the saffron, but this sort of lacked something for me--maybe one more ingredient (preferably something salty) would help. Or one more herb.

Loved this dish. I put the fennel in earlier -- with the orzo and onion because I like fennel cooked through. Excellent side dish.

Gourmet magazine lists the orzo amt at 1 and 1/2 cups total (not 1/2 cups). Worked great with the Greek Style Mahi-Mahi!

Terrific!! Easy, "comfort food" of the orzo combined with the sophistication of the fennel and saffron. I halved the recipe for just the two of us, but then have leftover fennel which I will have to find something else to do with. Great side for grilled meats. Will definitely be doing again!

Recipe doesn't state how much orzo to add. Dinner was ruined as we had to guess...and we guessed wrong. Please fix.
