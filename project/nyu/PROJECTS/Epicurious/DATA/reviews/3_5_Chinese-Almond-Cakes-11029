Well guess what nikandandy, with your fundamental subs you didn't make this recipe, so please don't rate it.

This recipe came out awful! I substituted most of the flour for ground almonds, used margarine instead of the shortening and lard, added some extra egg and orange liqueur, and they came out greasy, flat, and overall "blech!". Definitely wouldn't make this recipe again.

I mixed 3/4 butter and 1/4 oil together till soft, and then beat in the sugar. Then I added the dry ingredients and usedI used 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. I kneaded the dough right in the bowl and then formed it into a log and refrigerated it for 5 minutes. Next time I would bnake it for 8 minutes at 375 and then 10 to 15 minutes at 300. The dough was great to work with and delicious cookies!

I couldn't find lard so I used butter instead, and I don't think the cookies came out what they were supposed to taste like. and I baked them for almost 30 minutes. the texture now is crunch and chewy. Help! where do I buy lard?!

I had to do this recipe as part of me and my partners project, and all of the students loved it! :) they all thought that it was great and the cake wasnt that hard to make neither and the recipes were easy to find!
