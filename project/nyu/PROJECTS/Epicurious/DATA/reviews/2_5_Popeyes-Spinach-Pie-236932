Weel, we used regular old white flour for the crust and added to the filling 2 eggs, sherry vinegar, red wine, oregano, and a healthy dose of feta. Detox it ain't, but it sure tasted good.

I found this surprisingly flavourful and filling. Also pretty with the red cabbage and dark greens. To the reviewer who commented on the lack of protein, all plant foods have protein in them, and not every meal that you eat needs to have a specific protein component. We eat way too much protein on our modern diets!

This dish was ok. I paired it with the breakfast patties also featured in the diet (which dont taste like breakfast food, but are good nonetheless) to transition from a real detox/jump-start diet to a more moderate diet after the holidays. My son adores spinach, but he didn't like this. I think the combination of spices turned him off, which is saying something, because we're a savory/herb-friendly family. It was surprisingly filling and obviously healthy, but the flavors didn't blend quite right, even after I added a quick shave of parmesan cheese, a few dashes of salt and some extra garlic cloves. I think those additions just made it palatable!

white flour/sugar/rice and co. are not recommended for detox. suggest forgetting these ingredients forever, they are poison!

Where's the protein? I don't understand how this can be a complete meal.

I made some slight changes to the recipe. I left out the paprika, added 1/2 tsp of crystalized ginger, and 1 cup crumbled feta cheese. It turned out really well. I think next time I will try some blueberries in the place of the ginger. It needs a little kick of a natural sweetness to it.

This is not a review but a few comments for those, who might be detoxing. Zucchini, peppers & tomatoes are not detox foods. I cannot find spelt flour although I buy spelt flour bread but I will sub for buckwheat. Hope it works. Will let you know

I cheated and used a store bought spelt flour crust and I thought this was a terrific dish. Didn't miss the egg, cream or butter a bit. The tomatoes are a fantastic accompaniment. A good friend and I went to a local "live foods, organic restaurant" and we both were surprised at how much flavor and taste healthy cooking now has. This dish stands well next other great dishes of this next phase in cooking.

This recipe is surprisingly good! I did find whole spelt and it had a nuttier flavour than wheat flour. Which complemented the vegetable mix well. I needed a lot more water to get the dough to form, and ended up pressing it into the pan. The veg mix looked awful but tasted great. I sautéed the spices with the veg, using double the onion. The dish needed salting, so I think the addition of feta cheese to the veg would be great.

I used 1c white and 1c wheat flour (both organic) to replace the 2c spelt white flour. Had to add ~8T of water to get dough to form. I would add the spices to the onion/cabbage/zucchini mixture before adding the spinach -- would make them easier to thoroughly mix in. Surprisingly filling. Needs more...something. Garlic? Some mushrooms? Will have to play around with the seasoning. Good for an uber-healthy meal, but not something I'd crave.

spelt flour is horribly expensive. It is not a substitute for wheat flour, it is a type of wheat flour. This dish is awful.

Like most, I read the recipe to understand the ingredients. I am a novice cook, so exactly what is "spelt white flour"?
