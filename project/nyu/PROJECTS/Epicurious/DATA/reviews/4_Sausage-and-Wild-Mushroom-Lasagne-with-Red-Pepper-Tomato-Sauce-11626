Very good and tasty recipe. 3.5 forks. I used hot italian sausage, and roasted the red peppers as others suggested. It took a LONG time to make but the effort paid off. Everyone had seconds.

This recipe is well worth the effort. I frequently use the no boil and find it works well. The two tablespoons of balsamic in the red sauce really adds to the complexity. The combination of the two sauces was amazing. I only had dried chanterelles. I agree with another reviewer, deserves more than 4 forks.

Rating: 3
The red pepper tomato sauce is wonderful. I added a quart of wild mushrooms and they added a wonderful richness. I had never tried the no boil pasta before and I never will again. This recipe deserves better. With a bit of multi tasking, it goes together quickly. I am not sure how it could possibly take all afternoon as some reviewers suggested. With home made noodles this dish would rank a 4.

I didn't change a thing. My 93 year old friend (whose niece makes the "best" Lasagne she's ever eaten) said this was just as good if not better. I couldn't believe I made something which tasted so good. The other dinner guests agreed. I gave everyone a copy of the recipe. Changes, additions and deletions are not necessary. Its perfect just the way it is. Deserves 10 forks. Definitely

WOW!!!! DH is not a big lasagna fan, but couldn't stop talking about this one. I halved the recipe, roasted the peppers, and subbed a 14-oz can of whole plum tomatoes for the fresh. Based on the other reviews, I initially reserved the juice from the canned tomatoes, but in the end needed it all. NOT watery at all. Made the red sauce earlier in the day and the mushrooms before assembly; it is labor intensive, but not prohibitively so. The earlier reviewer's suggestion of prepping the day before baking is a good one, too.

This really did take 3 hours to make...a lot of steps, but the finished product is good. My husband says its the best lasagna I've made. I didn't soak the noodles and forgot the balsamic. I used San Mariano's too..or it would've taken me 4 hours!

Rating: 3
I used a 28 oz. can of crushed San Marzano tomatoes to speed things up and substituted bellas for the porcini since my usual store was out of them. Letting the final sauce simmer for 15 minutes instead of 5 is a good suggestion to avoid the "soupiness" others have mentioned. I ended up with enough of both sauces to start another 8x8 dish, which I liked much better as I was running out of bechamel and cheese by the second layers. Next time I'll go lighter on the bechamel and cheese on purpose to be nicer to my tummy. But the mushroom-pepper-hot sausage sauce is definitely staying. Yum!

Rating: 4
We loved this as an alternative to more traditional lasagne. I prepared very close to the recipe. Roasted the peppers first, blanched and seeded the tomatoes and I think I might have cooked the tomato sauce down further than 30 minutes. Not soupy at all. My only other tip would be to NOT salt the tomato/pepper sauce until you've added the sausage back. I found that the sausage added enough salt for us.

Rating: 4
I enjoyed this recipe very much. I too roasted the peppers ahead of time,used some home canned tomatoes and cremini mushrooms. I did not add all the liquid from the tomatoes and it came out great. I saved the liquid to soak the noodles which seemed to work out fine. The mushroom cream sauce was killer. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor combination; nice twist on the lasagne theme. Although -- having read so many reviews below discussing the problems with runniness, guess what, I overcompensated and mine was dry! I have a feeling that if you are sure to let your porcini/white sauce thicken properly, that might take care of the bulk of the issue. Similarly you can continue cooking the tomato sauce down to a consistency that looks best to you. Note that if you do not soak the lasagne sheets, it can be hard to fit them in the pan -- you don't really want them to overlap, but when they're dry that shatter when you try to break them. I did roast the peppers, as many reviewers recommend. I used Deborah Madison's method so that they were soft but not charred and so that there would be no skin in my sauce: trim the peppers and cut in half lengthwise, press flat with your hand, brush skin side with olive oil, roast, stack to steam, remove peels, slice. Finally, to make the recipe vegetarian, I started with shitake then crimini mushrooms, kept separate (they cook at different rates) but both chopped fine and sauteed with thyme and oregano. They left some nice brown bits in the pan that got picked up by the white mushrooms (which have a great deal more moisture). A fun project that I will do again!

Really delicious, and not really that much trouble (although I did use canned tomatoes). But it did get kinda runny ... I think 2 1/2 cups of milk is maybe a bit much? At any rate, it was delicious!

An excellent dish that one of my guests called "the best lasagna he has ever had". Preparing it took about 4 hours for me, although, if organized properly beforehand, you can probably cut this time down by quite a bit. I prepared this dish with hot italian sausage and left out the red pepper flakes to arrive at, what I and my guests agreed to be, a perfect level of spice (exciting your taste buds while allowing you to appreciate all the flavors in the food). I didn't encounter the soupiness, probably because I left my tomatoes and red peppers on the skillet for 35 minutes or so (as opposed to 20 minutes in recipe), and let my red pepper and tomato sauce simmer for alot longer than the 5 minutes the recipe calls for. I would recommend this dish to anybody who is patient enough to prepare it. If not, I would also suggest preparing the red pepper sauce as a topping for short pasta. Good luck and good eats.

Rating: 3
This is good, not great. I wish I had read the other reviews, as my lasagne turned out soupy, and it sounds like there are some remedies. The flavor is good, but this lasagne is pretty labor-intensive for the outcome. I may make the red-pepper sauce again as a topping for short pasta.

Rating: 4
Great lasagna recipe. Mine turned out somewhat soupy as well and I didn't soak the no bake noodles, either. But, the flavor was exceptional. I chopped the red peppers with my handy-dandy Vadalia onion chopper, along with the tomatoes, onion and garlic. I didn't puree the red pepper sauce since the ingredients were chopped fine. Based on other's reviews, I tried to shorten the prep time, even forgot the balsamic vinegar at the end, but it didn't seem to subtract from the overall presentation. Some reviewers seemed to run out of red pepper tomato sauce. That wasn't my problem - I ran short of the wild mushroom mixture. But, in the end - it all worked out fine and the lasagna was a huge success. Well worth the effort. I didn't use enough nutmeg to actually taste it in the final dish, so that wasn't so much of an issue. I did make the red pepper sauce the day before to make the final process not so time consuming. All the guests raved about it!!!!

Rating: 4
This was a very time consuming recipe, but worth the wait. I did skip a few steps to move things along, but not that many. While cooking my sausage, I roasted the red peppers, so they were already soft when I stirred them in to the sauce. I also didn't puree the sauce, I like it chunkier anyway. One more thing I did, which I think made it extra delicious...I was running low on the red pepper tomato sauce for the last layer and had extra mushroom sauce, so I mixed the two together...delicious!!!

Rating: 4
This was out of this world! I love the savory, creaminess of the porcini sauce in comparison to the bite of the red pepper sauce. So good and not soupy at all (I dished the red sauce out with a finely slotted spoon, though. I feel like if I hadn't done this it WOULD have been a little soupy.) Delicious!!!

Rating: 3
This recipe came out quite good. The sauce wound up being the best part, as the overall lasagna was pretty soupy. Probably due to the fact that we used canned San Marzano tomatoes, would definitely used fresh tomatoes next time. We also used turkey sausage to cut the fat and could barely notice a difference. We also skipped the soaking the noodles part and I cant tell what it would have done. Overall it was delicious and would defintily make it again, probably even as a pasta sauce.

This recipe is entitled to 10 forks! Ten people said it was best they had ever tasted. Had no problems with ingredients. I added an extra pound of sausage, let all the mixture cool and drained the excess liquid and lasagna was absolutely perfect!

This lasagna takes quite a long time to make, so you really do have to LOVE to cook (which I do) It is well worth it though! This recipe is amazing! My husbands grandma (82 years old) thinks it's the best lasagna she has ever had.I follow the directions exactly, and have never had a soupy problem. I found these great no boil lasagne at hole Foods, and they work great.I just finished making it and my mouth is watering as I smell it cooking!

This sounded good and it was good but not great. The layer of the porcini wild mushroom sauce is quite ugly while making. It looks like you were putting mushroom gravy on lasagne. Strange. After baking it looked good and was ok but my favorite lasagne from this site is the Turkey sausage spinach with spicy tomato sauce. That is a 4 forker!

The market that I went to did not have dried mushrooms so I substituted baby portabellos which turned out fine. I thought the tomato sauce was great. I added ricotta like another reviewer and I thought it was a nice touch.

I've made this several times, always to rave reviews. Unfortunately, my husband has come down with diabetes so pasta is a big no-no. So, I made it last night substituting thinly sliced, firm tofu for the pasta noodles. I sliced the tofu lenghtwise with a cheese cutter, patted the slices dry and froze them to firm up the texture. I also used turkey sausage, fat free half & half and corn starch to thicken the mushroom sauce, to cut down on the fat and calories. With those few substitutions, I figure I saved almost 3,000 calories, 132 grams fat and 417 grams carbs. The difference in texture was minimal and the taste wasn't compromised.

Rating: 4
My wife and I agree that this is probably the best lasagna we've ever had, but I made some changes to the recipe that seem to have fixed some problems others were reporting. First, to avoid the soupiness, I didn't soak the noodles beforehand. Also, to help it maintain shape, I mixed two tubs of ricotta cheese with 1 fresh mozzarella ball, fresh basil and two eggs, all in place of the cheese the recipe calls for. Cook the lasagna covered for 40 minutes, then uncovered another 40 minutes. By the time it's cooked this long with dry noodles, all the soupiness is soaked up. I also added 1lb of ground beef to the sauce, which is in all cases exceptional!

Rating: 4
Love this recipe and so do my guests. Since it is time consuming, only make it once or twice a year. One short cut is using two 28 oz canned San Marzano tomatoes, chop them, drain well. I always make it the night before so the flavors gel. I haven't had the experience of other reviewers where they say it was liquidy.

"The best lasagne I've ever eaten" was the remark last night from one of our guests. We've made this three times now and despite the effort, keep coming back to it. To complicate matters, we also make fresh garlic pasta! Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.

Rating: 4
Wow! This took 3-4 hours but it was worth it. The agreement around my dinner table was that this is the best lasagna we'd ever had. The mushroom sauce was delicious, even though I couldn't find dried porcini and used a variety of wild mushrooms instead. I also used portabollos and shitakes instead of white mushrooms. I used lean turkey sausage, which was delicious. Amazingly, with all the mushrooms in this dish, the flavor was not overpowering at all. I also increased the nutmeg (1/2 TSP maybe) as the mushroom sauce tasted underseasoned at first. I'm glad I did, you could taste the nutmeg in the final product and it was deliciously unexpected. A lot of work, but I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will roast the peppers as others here suggested.

Rating: 3
This was really good. It was rather a lot of work, but I made the sauces and grated the cheese one day, and did the rest the next day when I served it. I roasted the red peppers first. I was a bit disappointed that it did not taste as red-peppery as I had hoped. I think next time I would use less tomato and more red pepper. The mushroom sauce was really good and the nutmeg flavour was so nice. I used only 2 c of milk and it was a bit watery but not bad at all. I bet it will taste even better tomorrow.

This is a FABULOUS recipe! As someone who is working to perfect various skills, this was a fun recipe to test out new techniques and what a reward once you have finished.

I've made this several times now and always receive rave reviews. I also use chicken sausage; I think it has a better texture than pork sausage. I also roast the bell peppers first, per another viewer's suggestion. Roasting the peppers does give the sauce a sweeter flavor, but I think it pairs well with the spicy sausage and the woody mushrooms. Overall an excellent lasagna recipe.

Rating: 3
My family loved this. I did too, but it took me 2 hours from start to putting in the oven - about twice as long as I am usually willing to spend preparing dinner. I could probably make it quicker next time, but it's still a work-intensive dish. I made a few changes: only 10 oz. of mushrooms (the normal size supermarket package), only 2 red peppers, and a 28. oz can of tomatos. As for the wild mushroom mixture, I used 2 cups of milk because 2 1/2 cups just seemed like too much liquid to add to the baking dish. I look forward to trying this again.

Rating: 3
The chicken sausage was a brilliant idea. Takes care of the vegetarians in the crowd who will eat poultry. I made two pans of this for a big family gathering. It got raves. It WAS soupy, like other reviewers have noted, but I also added ricotta on top of the white sauce. May have been my own fault!

Unbelievable delicious! To ease the feeling of too much work I cut up all the ingredients earlier in the day. Cooking the sauces and assembling the lasagne seemed less work that way. Skip the fresh tomatoes. A 28-oz. can of diced tomatoes, well-drained, works great and saves more chopping. I used flavored chicken sausage, diced, in place of Italian sausage. That also decreased prep time and imparted a great flavor. I had no problem with the lasagne falling apart at serving. Just make sure the mushroom sauce is thick and you let the lasagne sit for at least 10 minutes. I served this for a group of six. There wasn't a morsel left and I think people would have eaten more if I'd made it.

I was looking for a recipe that was slightly differnt from the norm and I found it. The red pepper sauce is quite yummy. I made a few changes such as using fresh mozzarella and wild mushrooms. Sauted the mushrooms and then folden them into the mushroom sauce. The final product was a bit soupy, as others have noted, but the flavor was good. I'll definitely be adding it to our list. In my experience, as far as time consuming, this recipe took as long to make as any home made sauce recipe. Enjoy! It is quite delicious.

A Low Fat Version is Great! I used turkey sweet Italian sausage, thickened fat-free half & half with corn starch and fried the veggies in Pam (there was no oil left from the turkey sausage). I also added a layer of fresh oregano, which really added debth. Finally, it was 98* and my air conditioning is broken so I baked it on the grill - Bring your gas grill up to temperature (use an over thermometer to gauge), turn off one burner and put the item on the other side - I also baked a loaf of bread with this - walla, make-shift oven and no heating up the house!

This is my second posting on this recipe, because I just made it without soaking the "no-boil" noodles first. (This was always the step I've dreaded the most.) I used Barilla no-boil noodles, and assembled the lasagne the day before. The next day, I let it sit out for about an hour before cooking as directed. It was the best batch I've ever made. The noodles were the perfect consistency and the whole thing held its shape beautifully. This is the way I will do it from now on. (Not to mention, doing it a day ahead is great for entertaining so you're not exhausted on the day you have people over!)

Yes it was time consuming but I think that the flavors were awesome together. I used shitake and oyster mushrooms, about a half cup each, sliced in the white sauce and crimini mushrooms in the pepper puree. I got rave reviews! This is so much more interesting than regular lasagne!

This is time consuming and expensive to produce, but I would make it again. I found it to be more than a little soupy, and next time I will make it with regular and not "no boil" lasagne.

I do not recommend making multiple batches. I made 3 lasagnes and it took me over 5 hours - 6lbs of tomatoes, 12 red peppers, 6 cups of onions, 4lb of mushrooms - ALOT of prep work and hard to find pots large enough to hold all the sauce. I recommend making extra sauce - I ran out at the end.

We served this lasagna at our gourmet dinner club. It was well-received. The flavor of the sausage dominated; mushrooms weren't overpowering at all. Only complaint is that it didn't keep its shape when cut (even after adequate cooling). Looks very sloppy on the plate...but it's delicious! I don't believe its the best lasagne I've ever tasted.

I would make this again and maybe tweak a few things to make prepping faster. I added different types of mushrooms, but beware of using dried Shittake mushrooms, or maybe where you get them, they can be a little too strong and overpower all the other wonderful flavors. I dont care if this takes too long, its well worth it!

Rating: 4
Like all the others, I found this time consuming, but not very difficult. We (and I say "we" because help is a big + when making this) added several different types of mushrooms rather than all white and used some wild dried mushrooms along with the dried porcinis. We forgot the balsamic (a little too much wine during prep!) and left out the red pepper flakes. Still divine! The guest all said it was the best they'd ever had.

My boyfriend was set on a more traditional lasagne with ground beef but I couldn't resist this recipe so I used 1/2 mild italian sausage, 1/2 gb. Also, couldn't find porcinos but was determined to get that wild mushroom taste so I used chanterelles (sp?) don't think they're similar but still came out good. Used about 1/2 the amount of mild as the mushroom sauce seemed runny. Tomato sauce was excellent! Served with roated garlic oil breat with blue cheese sauce from this site and a spinach salad. Boyfriend was pleased!

This is about my favorite lasagne recipe in the world but I only make it every five years or so because it's so time intensive. Prep averages around 2 hours, assembly about another 45 minutes and the actually cooking another 35 to 40. It is worth it, but have comfortable shoes on or a soux chef at your disposal.

We've been searching for a lasagne recipe that rivaled those we tasted in Tuscany. This came close. The combination of the peppers and mushrooms gave a nice intense flavor. I used other's suggestions and used a mix of white and portobello mushrooms. However, this is A LOT of work and creates quite a pile of dirty dishes. Allow several hours and enlist a helper.

Absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe to a T, except neglecting to add 2 TBSPs of vinegar. (I got distracted and forgot.) The dish did not suffer, but next time I will remember this final addition to the sauce. The consistency was very nice and firm, not too soupy at all, as noted by the previous reviewer. The porcini mushroom layer is delicious. Could have eaten that alone as a soup. In the lasagne it adds a perfect layer of distinctive flavor. A definite keeper. I don't think I'll ever make the ricotta cheese, meat sauce version of lasagne again.

WOW! Not your traditional lasagna. This is a very time consuming recipe but worth the effort. I used portabellos and tree oyster mushrooms for the mushroom mixture. Dried procini's were very expensive ($5.00 for 1/2oz!) Sauteed them in chicken stock and added the reserved juice to the milk. Also had some boccini's I added to the cheese mixture and on top. DELICIOUS!

Rating: 4
One of the best lasagne recipies out there. I typically use baby portabella instead of white mushrooms and add some assorted dry mushrooms in addition to the porchinis (a few morels go a long way). With the extra mushrooms, the white sauce takes on a more robust flavor and then matches quite well with the red.

Rating: 4
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! This is one lasagna that is truly worth the effort. Since I couldn't find good tomatoes, I used two large cans of Sclafani whole tomatoes (chopped and then drained 80% of the liquid). Also substituted the mushrooms and used portobellos instead of porcini, along with white mushrooms. Barilla no boil lasagna noodles and Sorrento mozzarella worked beautifully. Did find that I needed more sheets than called for in the recipe & a slightly larger pan. I really have to thank all the reviewers for their tips on this success! My family couldn't get enough!!! Can't wait to try the recipe as it is written with fresh tomatos and porcini mushrooms.

I am not a big fan of "runny" lasagne sauce, and this one was a bit watery for my taste. The flavor was great, but the consistency was not. If you can thicken it up a bit you will be better off. I am not a gourmet chef, but a damn good eater :))

Wonderful recipe, I have experimented with it for my vegetarian friends by subsituting 1-1/2 lbs sliced and sauteed Cremini mushrooms for the saugsage. I sautee them in olive oil, and add red pepper flakes, oregano, basil and a bit of sage to taste. Everyone rates this as fantastic, my vegetarian friends rave even more.

An excellent lasagna! Like the other reviewers, I used sauteed portobellos instead of the porcinis, and canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I didn't have any no-boil noodles, so I wrapped the regular noodles in a wet towel and microwaved them for about 6 minutes to soften them up - perfect! Roasting the peppers is a must! I saved a bit of the sauce and tossed it with roasted zuccini and parm. cheese for lunch the next day.

I followed the recipe very closely and the result was good but not exceptional. I had this once before and thought it was the best lasagna I'd ever tasted.

This is abslolutely delicious. I've made it 4 times now and everyone goes crazy over it. Like most Lasagne, it is a fair amount of work but worth the effort. I use a low-fat chicken/turkey/sun dried tomato/black olive/feta sausage from Cantella's and the Barilla no-boil noodles. Think the Barillas are the best; light and tender. Takes about 15 per 9x13 pan. Mix the mushrooms, white and brown, and mix of the dried mushrooms too (they are expensive, but so good). Make my sauce with low fat milk and use good canned plum tomatoes. Making a double batch tonight for a luncheon party tomorrow! The wild mushroom sauce is so good by itself, would be great on pasta. The quantity made here only spreads for two layers though, so don't worry about it. Top with extra Parmesan.

Rating: 4
This is a fun recipe for two cooks to make together. Our results were fabulous! Due to their cost, we used fewer porcinis than called for (1 oz instead of 1.5). The mushroom flavor (we used crimini) didn't overpower, perhaps because we used very flavorful (spicy Italian) sausage. Every one of our guests had second helpings!

Rating: 2
The red sauce is a DREAM. I could eat a whole bowl of it all by itself. But the mushroom sauce was 1) bland on its own and 2) COMPLETELY overpowered the whole lasagne. If you live and breathe mushrooms, this is the lasagne for you. If you want a nice mix of flavors, make something else. Me, I think I'll make this again with JUST the red sauce. (I used all spicy sausage in mine and it had a nice kick.)
