This recipe has a typo - it should be 4 Tbsp of parsley not celery (at least that's what's in my copy of the magazine from May 1996). I made it with a pound of chorizo and it was great.

Perfect for a quick meal, simple to make, and easy to cook. I put in italian sausage and it made a huge difference.

I found this recipe when I was looking for something to make with some jalapeno venison sausage that I had on hand. I tried it and I liked it very much. I would recommend that anyone making use some sort of more flavorful sausage. Otherwise, I suspect this dish could be fairly bland with just normal sausage.

This was a new addition to our St. Patrick's Day party this year. It will now land up being a staple (along with the Cottage Pie recipe on this site). Living outside of NYC enabled me to visit an Irish butcher to get the Irish Sausage & Rashers (bacon) needed for this recipe. I browned the sausage and rashers first to give them some color. I then boiled the sausage in the beef broth for a few mintues so they were cooked enough to cut up. Next time I will boil it in water because they sausages contained alot of fat. I had to skim alot of it from the broth. I also sauteed the onions a bit so I could get everything into the dutch oven that I used. It was really a big hit with everyone.

Delicious- The whole family loved it. The potatoes tasted so rich and creamy. I used garlic sausage from a local organic farmer, one regular onion and one vidalia, and organic chicken broth. I had already-cooked bacon (from the same organic pig, very mild tasting) which I crumbled on top. It was extremely satisfying and surprisingly complex. Good with a bit of cheddar grated over the top, too.

Made this for St. Patrick's day and really enjoyed it. I would only use one onion, though (unless you're a big fan). Also, a spicier sausage instead of plain ol' breakfast links would give some added flavor. Great overall.

This is great, but I made a few changes. I use hot italian sausage links, I also use a handful of precooked crumbled bacon,and before it it done, I stir in about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, and I also sprinkle some on the top and bake till it browns. This adds a whole other taste to the dish.

It was great! I made it at the last minute so I worked with what I had. Used italian sausage, no bacon, & chicken broth. Also added some fresh chicken stock. (Didn't measure anything; hardly do) It was excellent! Everyone wolfed it down, and I will definately make it again soon!

Easy to prepare, my husband loved it and so did my young son! I made it with a locally made smoked sausage, it was great!

Does anyone know if you cook the bacon first? Just seems like you should.

I used a smoked bacon, but truthfully it could have been left out all together. I also used Erich beef sausage instead of breakfast sausage links. Really great flavor, after all it is pork fat. My husband liked it so much that I was given "permission" to make it again sometime. Left overs made great fried pototas the next morning.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day potluck at work. It was so easy, and so good! I definitely would make it again & play with the herb and sausage combinations.

if amiable spouse were to rate this he would give it 4 forks, but since it's me i give it 3 this is so easy and wonderful and i can easily see doing this with potatoes and turnips, just bacon, different sausages, etc. the reason i gave it 3 forks is beacause as is, it's just a little too heavy for my taste - but the basic is there and will make again and again!

I used 2 Tbs. of fresh rosemary (no parsley on hand), and it was so great I doubt I'll try w/ parsley now. Also used mild Italian sausage, was very delicious on a cold winter morning!

Delicious! I made this for my 6th grader's report on Ireland (they had to take a dish from the country to share with the class) and it was a big hit! Everyone commented on how good it smelled and tasted and several teachers asked for the recipe. This one goes to the top of my Irish recipes list. It is so good and easy to make.

This is a great hearty dish, very easy to make. I used fresh hot Italian and Cajun sausages with the casings removed and it was very flavorful. The directions are confusing as to celery/parsley, so I added 4 stalks of coarsely chopped celery.

We really enjoyed this simple entree. We did, however, make gravy out of the liquid rather than simply reduce it. That was a wonderful addition.

I tried this recipe using Maple sauage links & it was delicious!

I truly enjoyed this recipe, but I found that the ingredients calls for 4 Tablespoons of chopped fresh celery, but was not used in the instructions. Could this be a mistake--perhaps it's supposed to be the Parsley?
