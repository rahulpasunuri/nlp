I really wanted to like this, but found it only ok. Not the best use of lobster tail and there are a bazillion more interesting ways to prepare shrimp.

Sorry, I meant to write halibut chunks, not monkfish, which is not Kosher.

To cescaca. Fish is dairy and so there is no need to substitute for the Yogurt. I'm a private chef and am getting ready to prepare this for a Kosher client. The only substitute I will make is monkfish cubes for the lobster. I am not reviewing this dish now, as I have not yet prepared it.

I thought this was just OK but my friend loved it. I used shrimp, added more spinach, added cumin as well skipped the serrano but added chipotle powder at the end and served over rice...it was good but a bit bland.

I keep kosher, so I made this with fake crab and non-dairy yogurt. And used frozen spinach. Even with these substitutions, my guests raved over it. I have also made it with non-dairy sour cream, but it was not quite as good.

I made this for dinner tonight with only 1 variation (didn't have a serrano, used a pinch of cayenne). We thought that it had very good flavor and certainly presents lobster in a different way. I will make this again.

Excellent. I am Bengali and rate thisw as pretty authentic. I used jumbo shrimp, frozen spinach and went heavy on the chile, added a pinch of turmeric and 1/2 tsp of cumin. I intend to make it again.

We made this with shrimp and thought it was worth a place in our 'do agains'. We used cous cous and found that that was a good accompaniment.

I have made dish twice for guests and it has gotten rave reviews. I smash the coriander seeds with a mortar and pestle for a little added texture.

I thought with all the rave reviews that this would be fantastic. Upon reading the ingredients, I thought it needed a boost so instead of using one serrano chile, I used four since we like our food spicy. However, this dish was still on the bland side. Definitely not worth the cost of the lobster.

Something weird happend to my yogurt, but it tasted good!!! I took the tips from the other reviewers and used shrimp - served over basmati rice! Yum!!!

I made it with jumbo shrimp, and it is now my new favorite shrimp recipe. Absolutely great combo of seafood flavors and spice/ginger/garlic. Not terribly hot, at least not with supermarket serrano chile, and a very nice balance of flavors. If I could afford the lobster tail, I'd try it, but this seemed perfect with large shrimp.

Really delicious! I served it with Jasmine rice which added a nice coconut like flavor. Cracking the lobster tails was no problem, I used kitchen scissors.

Was unable to get fresh lobster today, so used jumbo shrimp instead...loved the sauce, very easy to make. Next time I will use lobster..excellent!

very simple to make, lovely flavors. not sure that i would not substitute crab next time and avoid the "cracking the lobster tail" problem (also, crab is available fresh but not lobster here)

This was awesome! I changed it a little. Did not cut the tails, served them split and whole. Added lemon while baking and then plated and topped it with the sauce! Everyone just raved!

Very good and doesn't take long, except for getting the lobster out.
