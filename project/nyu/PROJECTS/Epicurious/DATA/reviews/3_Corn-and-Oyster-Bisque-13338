This is the most boring and bland oyster bisque/stew I have ever made. There's just nothing to recommend this dish. As if it's not bad enough to be an oyster...now the insult of ending up in this dish. Sorry guys.

I used frozen corn & oysters in a jar from the deli & my family still loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

Velvety smooth, and a wonderful flavor....substituted a cup of heavy cream for one of the cups of milk...easy, quick and everyone asked for more...

although in shell oysters were not available to me,I substituted standard's from deli.This worked fine, however liquer was scant. A little more Tabasco would not hurt. Over all taste was very good. Nice texture.
