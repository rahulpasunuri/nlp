I made this last night and was thought the results were "eh." My husband said it was a little more like baby food with fennel then an interesting soup. I roasted my vegetables much longer then suggested, put everything in the cuisinart and then simmered on the stove longer then 2 minutes. It still felt rough and bumpy. There is a recipe on Epicurious that I prefer - carrot and ginger soup - where the ratio and consistency are much better. We knew we were eating a healthy soup with dinner but I won't make this again.

I love a savory soup and this is definitely in that category. I doubled the garlic and roasted the vegetables about 10 minutes more than suggested to caramelize them further. As suggested by other reviews, I added some balsamic vinegar at the end. The added roasted garlic really added to the savory flavor. Definitely a keeper. BK, Boston, MA

Meh, that's all I can say. I followed the directions and added a balsamic vinegar glaze as well as some truffle oil. Still needed a little more punch, not sure what could help this? You could through in some maple syrup or more brown sugar as someone suggested but I can only handle so much sweet. It was just okay, although my guests said they really liked it, I think they were only being nice.

Wow! Easy, healthy and delish. I used all veggie stock (in lieu of water) and 1/2 cup of milk, and added extra cloves of roasted garlic as others suggested. This soup has a lot of flavor as is; nutmeg or white truffle oil would also be great additions.

Delicious. Feels creamy, although there is no cream in it! It´s healthy and real yummy!

With the exception of a few extra cloves of garlic, I didn't change anything with the recipe. The soup had such a gorgeous mellow flavour and was not bland in the least. Will definitely make again.

I disagree with reviews that this soup wasn't flavorful enough. I used a roasting pan, and when it came time to puree the second half of the roasted vegetables with the water, I put the vegetables in the blender and then deglazed the roasting pan with the water. I imagine this added some flavor. Recommended! I also blasted the soup with an immersion blender before serving.

Wonderful soup! The whole family enjoyed it. We found it to be quite flavorful and delicious. It would be important to choose fresh produce to get the desired flavor; this is not a recipe to use up the carrots that have been in your crisper for two months. Also make sure you sufficiently bake the veggies to get the true roasted, caramelized taste. We used this week's CSA carrots, fennel, garlic and red onions and it was fantastic! Because I was nervous after reading previous reviews that the soup might be on the bland side, I used all chicken broth (no water), two cloves of garlic, and three smallish onions. I also used brown instead of white sugar. I loved it with these changes, but it would have been good anyway. Enjoy!

made it as directed. onion overpowered the fennel taste. otherwise bland. wont make it again.

As is, the recipe needs a little extra depth of flavor. Roasting gives the carrots and fennel a great taste. I added a few orange wedges with the vegetables while roasting, then squeezed the orange juice into the soup. In addition, I added about 1 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar to provide a little more depth of taste. I also used all chicken stock and no water in the soup. When finished, it was excellent drizzled with the fennel oil.

I followed this recipe exactly. I thouht it was great. The flavors are very subtle; if you're looking for something to hit you over the head, this might not be it. It's a great appetizer soup and makes for a nice presentation with the fennel oil and fronds. It did need extra salt - maybe some of the people that thought it was bland just needed some more salt and pepper??

This recipe is very sweet and bland. I added some spices some orange vinegar, tamari and some roasted pine nuts. It got a bit better but not great. I think if you like bland sweet food you'd love it.

I was intrigued when I found this recipe but it looked a little plain and a few of the reviews said as much. I didn't use the sugar, used 8 cloves of garlic, added a large shallot and two pasilla peppers to the roasted veggies, used a large onion, and 4 slices of thick bacon (I fried it then added it to the soup before blending). Instead of water I used a ~48oz can of chicken stock, 1/2 a cup of red wine (syrah) and 6 bay leaves and reduced it on low while the veggies roasted. To serve it, I toasted walnut pieces and topped the soup with the walnuts, a drizzle of heavy creme and the fronds (instead of the fennel oil). It was amazing.

Not nearly enough flavor in this dish. The ONLY thing I changed while making it was the amount of onion, and I don't think that putting in the whole onion could have saved this recipe. The concept sounded delicious, the reviews sounded delicious, the soup itself was boring.

I really enjoyed this recipe the day I made it. However, don't try to freeze the soup for later. After freezing, the texture was still good but the soup had lost most of its flavor.

Very rich and complex flavor. Enjoyed it even without the fennel oil, which I will definitely try next time. I hope that the soup freezes well, because this seems like a great use for the fennel in my CSA box. Will definitely make again.

This is the first time I ever had fennel and I thought I'd try this recipe. It was delish. I did add 2 small potatoes and 2 stacks of celery.

Nice light fennel flavor. I agree with other reviewers, the fennel oil is what makes this so special. Made up quickly and looked very elegant on the table. I was nervous about so much fennel so I used 1 fennel bulb and 3 large carrots, which is a slightly higher carrot to fennel ratio than the recipe and threw in two small diced potatoes. Used all vegetable broth. Very good!

too much onion, no fennel flavor. turned out like babyfood.won't make this again.

Amazing! This soup is easy enough to make on a weekday, yet elegant enough to serve at a dinner party. Healthy, hearty, perfect! I used water to thin it, and didn't feel the flavor was sacrificed. Also used mortar and pestle to crush the seeds and got a nice strong flavor.

healthy change to not have cream, but I still added a little butter just for a touch of Southern love. I also omitted the water and added broth instead, but a little at a time so it didn't get too watery. Next time I think I'll add a little maple syrup for a real autumn taste.

Maybe I loved this because I thought I was making a roasted peasant soup for a rainy day and ended up with lunch at the french laundry! The picture doesn't do it justice, it comes out bright orange and the garnish with a small fennel frond in the middle makes it look like the cover of Gourmet! Don't be fooled by the simplicity of throwing everything in a roasting pan and then pureeing it with liquid (love that idea) this soup is yummy.

What a fantastic soup! I agree with previous reviewers, the fennel oil is vital, and very easy to make. We used a mortar and pestle because the coffee grinder didn't grind the anise seeds enough. After reading that some people found it too watery, I added the broth and water a little bit at a time. I actually ended up adding almost 2 cups of water because the flavor was too concentrated otherwise. The only other change was to add some cayanne pepper to give it a little heat. I will definitely make this again and again.

Not bad, you can taste the healthyness of it. However I am not sure if it is my oven but it takes much lnger than 1/2 hour to cook the veggies and I didnt dare to add water, just used broth. I served it with a spoon of creamy goats cheese and it really made it yummy.

Delightful. I used a 4 cups of broth, and 1 cup of water for a richer soup. I also added 4 cloves of garlic, instead of one. Great flavor. This is moving to the top of my "quick soup" list!

This was fabulous. I used more stock and less water than called for, otherwise made it as recipe appeared. Even my daughter who doesn't like fennel loved this soup, which has a complex yet subtle flavor. It was the perfect light beginning to a hearty Thanksgiving meal.

This was my first real soup- I had made stews before, but nothing blended. It was pretty tasty, although I wasn't pleased with the texture at the end. I attributed this to the fact I only have a food processor and not a blender. I also added a bit of ginger for some zing.

I thought this was delicious. Doubled the recipe and did not use water as I like my soups thicker. It wasn't velvety smooth this way, but the flavor was outstanding. The roasted fennel really added a nice flavor.

I found this soup to be a little bland and watery. Maybe I'm too much of a dairy glutton but it wasn't as hearty as I would have liked for an autumnal soup.

Judging from the leftovers in bowls, 2/3rds of my book club loved this soup and the rest not. I think its a fennel thing. You have to like that flavor. Next time I would strain it (to thin it vs. adding water or broth) and add a bit of creme fraiche with the fennel oil and fronds to make it even more elegant.

Flavors were decent enough but ended up undercooked and chunky. Poor old blender started smoking. Might have been okay if I had strained it or something.

Very easy and very good. I was tempted to add butter or cream or something but it really doesn't need it (and without, it's vegan). I made parsley oil instead since I don't like fennel seeds. The roasted carrots and fennel were good enough to eat alone.
