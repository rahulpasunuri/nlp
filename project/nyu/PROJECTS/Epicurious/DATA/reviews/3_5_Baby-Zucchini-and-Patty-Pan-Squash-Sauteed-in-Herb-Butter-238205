Not really sure how others found this bland. It's straightforward, quick and delicious. Added richness from the butter. Great to use up the plethora of zucchini and squashes from our organic delivery. Delicious and fresh.

Even with farmer's market fresh ingredients, this was boring and bland.

discovered with this recipe that I absolutely do not like mint with squash. The mint completely ruined the dish for me.

This was amazing!! I added mushrooms, onions, and fresh tomatoes bc I needed to use them. It was great!! Wasn't sure how the basil and mint would mesh but it was great!!

This is simple, quick and delicious! Made It with fresh from a farmer's market organic full sized green, green striped and yellow patty pan squash and it was really good. I used the herbs listed and added a tiny bit of thyme and rosemary because I had them left over from something else and hanging around on my cutting board. I don't agree that squash is tasteless. As is nearly always the case, any recipe is only as good as it's ingredients. Mine were individually great and the result reflected it!

Squash is practically tasteless on its own...so we're basically rating the herbs in this recipe...nothing to write home about.

I made this as a side for xmas dinner and it was delicious and simple. The flavors worked really well with everything on the plate. I'll definitely make this again and again!

The simplicity of this recipe speaks to my taste buds. I really enjoyed the basil and mint combo. I served this with the Fennel ragout cod recipe found on this site.

Easy and delicious. I used just patty pan squash, and added dried basil and mint at end of cooking -- it still came out great. Was too lazy to go out to snip fresh basil and mint, but next time I may try with fresh herbs. Nice to know that it is still delicious even with dried herbs.

This was so easy, and absolutely delicious. We had neither zucchini nor baby-size squash, so we used full-sized patti pan and summer squash cut into large pieces, and it came out just fine. I was skeptical about adding the herbs after cooking, but they wilted and adhered nicely to the vegetables, giving the dish a beautiful blend of flavors, without being overwhelming. A wonderful use for my garden-fresh basil and black peppermint.
