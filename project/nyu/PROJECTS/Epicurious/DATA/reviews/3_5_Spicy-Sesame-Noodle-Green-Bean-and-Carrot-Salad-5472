I have made this twice. I love this. It is a great summer spicy asian salad. I used chinese long beans this most recent time and loved it. If you can find these "yard long beans" definitely use them in this recipe.

Very good! I didn't have fresh lime so I used the other kind and i omitted the peppers, but it was easy to make and looked great on the plate. I had it with steak and crab cakes.

This was really good! I had to modify a bit due to an empty pantry. I didn't have orange peel, but had some peeled orange wedges. I threw a few in with the sauce and blended everything in a mini food processor. I also didn't have lime juice, so I added an equivalent quantity of RealLime granules. The noodles I used were udon noodles. Altogether, this was simply delicious. As another reviewer wrote, the sweet-citrus-hot flavor is excellent. Very good light summer dinner.

Would use less sugar. Did not use orange peel. Used soba noodles; probably less noodles than called for. You could toss anything in. I added freshly-boiled corn shucked from the cob. Great basic marinade/sauce. Relative immediately requested the recipe.

Made this to use some fresh green beans. Added some toasted peanuts and fresh cilantro as some here suggested. It was a nice light summer meal, very tasty. Trying to think of what to add to give it more protein for a better balanced meal next time, maybe tofu or edamame.

Loved this! I also added some fresh cilantro. Made herb-grilled chicken breasts, Thai style to go with. Excellent flavors. Also, did not use fresh pasta and instead a whole wheat linguini; was just fine. This would be excellent for a summer outdoor concert meal. All can be made ahead of time served at room temp. Yummy.

I leave out the serrano chilies altogether (my kids aren't into spicy foods) and it's still delicious. Highly recommended.

I did not rate this recipe because I only used it as a jumping-off point: I added about 1 Tbs minced fresh ginger to the dressing, changed the pasta to fresh chinese-style noodles and the vegs to julienned snow peas, carrots, zucchini, scallions and peeled broccoli stems; it was fantastic. I want to use the dressing as a shrimp marinade...

Very good. I recommend breaking the noodles in half, to keep everything mixed evenly.

Great noodle salad. I halved the recipe and it was just enough for two. Served with teriyaki chicken, which I wouldn't do again - there was no need for another strong flavour as the dressing is quite powerful. The salad was completely delicious though. I used Thai ribbon noodles instead of linguine and also added crushed peanuts and toasted sesame seeds which I would certainly do again. Don't miss out the orange zest - it was probably my favourite flavour.

Salad-Smalad. Toss in some cilantro and toasted peanuts (salted) and serve it as a warm main dish. Delish!!

Pretty good, but there are better asian noodle salad recipes out there. We used pickled jalapenos instead of seranos because we had some on hand, and they weren't hot enough. We tasted the salad once it was mixed up, and it was lacking something. We added a tablespoon of oyster sauce, a tablespoon of Thai fish sauce and some chopped cilantro, and that improved it.

This dish is awesome but 2 sliced serano peppers is fire ass hot. No joke. It calms down over night but be prepared and I have also seeded 1 jalapeno and finely diced it when my 2 year old is eating this with us and its considerable less spicy.

Delicious and beautiful. Also used soba noodles. Some reviewers thought it was too spicy but not for my crowd!

I've haven't made this dish for several years but was doing a Thai themed dinner and thought it would be a nice change from the usual jasmine or basmati rice accompaniment. It was even better than I remembered and the leftovers were sensational. I made the dressing a day ahead and then assembled a couple hours pre-dinner. I did cut down on the chile pepper to one and it seemed fine to me. I also used Japanese soba noodles and really liked that better than linguini. Some of my guests who were not into complicated foods didn't really go for it but the other true fans of Southeast Asian flavors loved it! I will be making this again soon!

Simple, straight-forward and it tastes good. We added toasted sesame seeds to it which was great.

I am all for fusion as long as it is an improvement from the original, but this dish just makes me want to have the real thing. There is a dish in Japan called Hiyashichuka which is pretty much the same thing. It is a cold noodle dish with a dressing made out of sesame oil, sugar, soy sauce, and rice vinegar. The noodles are usually topped with slices of ham, cucumber, egg, shoga (a pickeld radish), and on the side, some Japanese mustard for those who like it hot, not to be confused with Wasabi. The original version is far superior in taste, and presentation. For those that would like to make something similar but better, here is an adaptation that I have been making for the past year. In todays carb conscious tastes, this can either be served on a bed of lettuce or on traditional noodles (like ramen). The dressing is a mixture of the traditional Hiyashichuka sauce and peanut sauce for chicken satay. Over low heat, dissolve one part sugar with one part water. Add one part sesame oil. Add peanut butter ( I usually go over 1 part, but this one should be done to taste). Let it cool and work in rice vinegar to taste ( I like a lot of vinegar so I go around 2 parts, maybe even more). Toppings that work well besides the ones mentioned above are chicken, red peppars, corn, pretty much any sweet vegetable.

I made this for a barbeque last weekend for a group of guests including several visitors from Asia. It was a huge hit, so huge that I didn't even get to taste it before it was gone. One of my Asian guests said (as he worked his way through his third helping) it was the perfect combination of Asian and Western tastes. I used snap peas and added a red bell pepper. I also used Jalapenos from the garden, but my SO thinks it would be better a little hotter...of course this from a guy who eats whole habaneros.

I love this salad and always get raves on it. I have substituted all sorts of vegies with this and all seem to work as long as they are either raw (red onions, finely sliced cucumber) or tender crisp (asparagus, snap peas. The one substitution I always make though is using ramen noodles. It adds visual appeal and ease.

I was disappointed with this recipe after reading so many positive reviews. It just seemed to be missing something. I topped it with toasted cashews which helped a bit, but next time will try playing around with the dressing some more.

I substituted 2 tsp. of minced pickled jalapeno for the serrano chilis and it was great for those who are fussy. Excellent flavors. Using refrigerated fresh pasta is important. It didn't get mushy and didn't soak up all the dressing when made ahead. I also sprinkled it with toasted sesame seeds. Excellent!

this dish is a keeper...i've made it several times and i'm always looking for something new...last time i substituted a pinch of dried chilli for the serrano chilli and it was delicious...a picky little boy who came to dinner reached for more rather than the marinated chicken pieces i served with it...try adding shrimp for pizzaz

My guests and I loved this. I swaped out the beans and put in sugar snap peas instead -- we spent the whole meal raving about it. A touch too spicy though, next time I'll put in only one pepper and make sure to seed it.

I have made this several times, with the herb grilled chicken that it's printed with, and we have always enjoyed both

Delicious. Good 'covered dish' fare. HOT/ fiery(but good!) so I'll tone that part down. (My sesame oil is the HOT variety, so I thought I'd already compensated with only 1 small pepper, and adding some juice from the grated orange.) Interesting to me that the oj dominated the flavor rather than complementing it (so now it's SWEET CITRUS and HOT!), which I liked. Spouse recmdd omitting the oj next time. Included asparagus and few cashews. Pared with 'Seared Tuna Pepper Steaks" as a Calif. reviewer noted. (Thanks MarieW for the great suggestion!) May use this recipe's wonderful dressing on the tuna steaks as marinade and/or heated sauce.

I have made this a few times - first verbatim, and it was excellent. Last night I did not have green beans on hand, so made this w/ steamed summer squash. I believe it would also be good with julienned raw cucumber. For easier preparation I used chinese hot sauce, which worked perfectly. I plan on adding strips of browned tofu next time. This is a great recipe, especially perfect for summer. I will continue to make this dish again and again.

This was a big hit at a 4th of July party. The only complaint was that it was a bit to spicy for some. Next time I make will use only 1 chili. Did make the day before serving and this worked well.

Great dish. I used rice noodles (like the ones used for pad thai) and added cilantro and chopped, roasted, unsalted peanuts. Really delicious!

I found this to be a pain to prepare with not much of a reward. I followed the recipe almost exactly (used a little less canola oil) and I thought it was pretty flavorless. Too many carrots and pasta, not enough green beans...all of which is fixable, but I don't think it's worth it.

simply delicious--made it for a summer bbq with friends. Added some sweet peppers. Big hit!!

I made this dish the other night for my family - my mother and sister are true culinary experts whereas I am strictly amateur. The dish was a total success - both insisted on having the recipe and were very impressed with the unique combinations of flavors. Only thing I would change is I only added 2 tbsp of canola oil and even that seemed a tad too much.

At first, we were disappointed with this one, but by days 2 and 3, this was just wonderful as a light meal; a recipe that clearly benefits from a day to meld flavors. Personally, I liked it slightly warmed up, and also added a touch of red pepper flakes. Want to try with additional protein, such as shredded chicken, or shrimp, as another reviewer suggested. Used frozen french-style green beans to match carrot configuration, and thin spaghetti in lieu of linguine. Definitely worth a go.

Yep, this is a good one. There are some great suggestions on here already: the angel hair pasta substitution, sprinkling chopped peanuts on it, etc. I also thought it would be good with either tofu or shrimp added. Very nice for summer.

Fantastic!! Took the advice of one of the reviewers and used angel hair pasta. Used only one chili and it was plenty spicy. Served the pasta with chicken sate and peanut sauce and they went together really well.

This dish looks and tastes sensational. I made a couple of alterations to the recipe, I used Angel Hair Pasta as it looks more elegant, instead of 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, I used 1/2 teaspoon and made up the rest of the tablespoon with Bottled Sate Sauce. I also added roasted unsalted peanut and snow peas which made the dish taste and look more Asian. A real winner with my family.

Made this recipe for a cookout. Only used (1) Hot pepper. If I make it again I will use a lighter noodle. My family kept scooping out the pasta and leaving the green beans at the bottom of the bowl. I also bought pre-shreaded carrots and they worked great.

I always read the reviews - I may try a recipe that not everyone likes but I would never bother with one that is universally panned, This recipe is so good it deserves 4 forks! If you like asian inspired food you will love it too. I make it with spagettini, linguine is too heavy - add a handful of chopped cilantro at serving time. Lovely!

This is a favorite at our house. Light & easy w/ good fresh veggies. For a little more color I have thrown in thin red pepper strips. Also, I make the dressing a day or so ahead.
