I was disappointed, especially since this recipe got a good review from someone else.

Excellent! I used a food processor to blend the the eggplant with the herbs because the eggplant was too hard to mash. It was a big hit with our guests. Tangy and zippy. Next time I'll reduce the garlic (it was a bit over powering)
