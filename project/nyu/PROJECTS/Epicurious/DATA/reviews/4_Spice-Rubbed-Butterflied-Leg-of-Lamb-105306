Not only was thie one of the top lamb recipes I have ever enjoyed the left overs were even more amazing the next day

This was very good but I agree with another reviewer that it had a bit too much salt. I think it's a good way to grill lamb in a different way from either the Greek style or just rosemary or mint. I served it also with the spiced quinoa with zucchini and a salad with greens, pears, blue cheese and spiced pecans from Trader Joes someone brought me. I live in Jordan so the lamb was cut a bit strangely but I was so excited to get a leg,which is rare here. Where do they all go? We only see shoulders or entire sides.

Making this recipe for the third time. It is a definite keeper. We all love it. Next time I will try the marinade on some chicken.

Rating: 3
Didn't serve 6-8 in our household! Absolutely delicious, but would halve the salt next time as it overpowered the spices and lamb. Replaced the marjoram with cilantro with no issues. Butterflied the lamb myself and left the bone only just attached, so I can gnaw on all the caramelised marinade later :) Agree with some other reviews about the lamb being overpowered, so next time would probably use chicken or hogget (1yr old sheep)and cook slower

Simply one of the best lamb recipes I've ever had. I substituted the contents of a mint tea bag for the fresh mint and it worked beautifully.

Ive made this twice, once in the summer, on the grill and once in the winter, in the oven. Both were fantastic, but of course, a grill is always better :) Theres no need to marinate O/N, the first time i made it (for the grill) i only marinated 5 hours and the results were still delicious

OK. I thought there were just too many flavours competing with the lamb. It may be more popular with those who aren't lamb lovers. Next time I'll go back to something simpler.

Fabulous recipe. I use more garlic, just because we like it. I use this recipe for special occasions, like Rosh Hashanah. The guests rave, everyone has seconds (or thirds) and my hubby is overjoyed (he loves lamb). I have made this recipe for picky eaters and even those who don't like lamb, yet everyone raves about it. Absolutely perfect!!

Excellent! I've been using this for several years now, generally with chicken pounded flat on skewers and grilled. Only needs to marinate for 1/2 hr!

Rating: 3
I am not one to shy away from recipes with alot of ingredients but this one was overkill. The lamb was tasty but there are so many simpler marinades and spice rubs that yield fabulous results. Word of warning: If any marinade gets on your clothing the stain will never come out because of the turmeric.

As wonderful as all the reviews claim. Used the marinade for a whole cut-up chicken. Fabulous. Made the marinade without any alterations.

Fabulous and easy. Followed recipe exactly EXCEPT for mint. Really can't stand mint. Great taste, great crust, medium rare and extremely tender. The kids loved it as much as the hubby. Can't wait for lamb legs to go on sale again. This is now my staple lamb dish. YUM YUM.

This recipe lived up to the reviews hands down! Made no subs. Marinated 24 hours. Butterflied and cut in to 2 pieces. Grilled to 140(hubby insisted!). It was tender inside, a perfect crunch outside and everyone loved it at our Easter dinner. I am making a lamb chili with some of the leftovers and can't stop eating the meat cold! It is so tender I can pull it apart w/ my fingers. I even put some of the "juices" in with the stew...yum! Try this one...you won't be disappointed.

Great tasting with a picky fiancé I didn't tell him ketcup was in the recipe and he liked it even though I didn't have the time to marinate it. So it probably be very good if I had the time. NO Changes! Oh yeah, I left the ginger and garlic on the meat.

I made this for a family gathering. Everyone raved about it! Even my finicky mother had 2nd helpings! I can't say enough about how perfect this turned out! My favorite lamb recipe!

Rating: 4
Remarkable do-ahead dish for either a weeknight meal or a weekend party. I prefer 2TB cilantro over the marjoram and the heat can be increased slightly (if you wish) by substituting ground thai chili in lieu of the cayenne. Soften the marinade with a little plain yogurt for a 24-hour chicken marinade.

Rating: 4
Absent marjoram, which I didn't have, this was still perfect. Complex taste and uniquely satisfying the palate. What left overs were there also made the best Scotch Broth I had ever made!

Easy...fabulous. Got raves from everyone. Marinated the lamb for 48 hours and could have done it even longer.

This is a great, great marinade. I've not tried it with chicken, but it is incredible with butterflied leg of lamb!

Rating: 3
This is probably worth 3.5 forks, what an incredible marinade, but do yourself a favour and ensure that you are buying quality lamb and that you marinade overnight. I grilled this on a gas bbq, and while the marinade will char if you don't keep a vigil, it is an absolute crime to cook lamb beyond rare to medium rare, which shouldn't be long enough to burn the marinade on a medium flame.

Rating: 4
This recipe is excellent and better when done on the bbq (leaving the excess marinade on is fine). I made it for a dinner party and guests loved it. I cooked it on low to medium heat and still charred the outside slightly. Will definitely make it over the holidays despite the cold waether.

Rating: 2
Not sure what I did wrong, but thought it was just ok. It has sort of a spicy lamb kebab flavor (at least it turned out that way). Broiled it in an oven until it hit 118F internally instead of putting it on the grill though, so maybe that had something to do with it.

Rating: 3
Delicious flavors! Broiling worked well with this recipe, although I recommend removing as much marinade as possible first. Extra marinade collected and became mushy/soggy.

Accidentally overcooked it but it still got raves. Prepared it exactly as typed. Served it with moroccan salad and veggies.

Recipe is excellent. I just want to add a small contribution. I browned the lamb in my iron skillet and finished it off in the oven until the meat thermometer registered 128 degrees. It was done just right for medium rare and very tender. I deglazed the skillet with wine and broth. I've used both white wine and chicken broth and this time I used beef broth and red wine. This gave a delicious thin sauce/jus to add the the meat. I'm sure it could be thickened if that is your preference. I made the full amount of marinade for two and am using the rest for chicken breasts for tonights dinner. Great flavors.

Rating: 4
Wow this was delicious! I used lamb chops instead. I rubbed the paste on the chops, marinated for 3 hours and grilled on the BBQ. I was initialy afraid it would be too spicy but it was just perfect. I halved the spice rub for about 1 1/2 pounds of lamb chops.

Rating: 4
This recipe needs 5 forks. It is absolutely the best grilled leg of lamb I've ever tasted. I made it for my mother-in-law's birthday dinner and couldn't believe how much lamb this petite woman consumed (not to mention my husband). It is a surefire recipe for entertaining and worth all the fuss of the many marinade ingredients.

Rating: 4
This is my second review of this recipe. I typically make this with the butterflied,boneless leg of lamb...and it's incomparable. Truly one of my VERY favorite recipes on this site. In my previous review, I noted that this marinade is equally fabulous on boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I just made those again recently, which reconfirmed my original ecstatic response. Mind you, this marinade is so utterly delicious that it would make anything it touches just explode with flavor. I can't recommend this recipe highly enough.

I had never cooked lamb before and tried this recipe for guests last night. It was a smash hit. A repeat performance is already scheduled.

For those of you who think you don't like lamb, this will change your mind forever. I just made this again last week for friends who actually requested it. The first time I served it to them, they couldn't believe it...their comment was "we don't eat lamb". It is one of the best recipes I've tried on Epicurious...and that's a lot!! The combination of the different spices will just knock your socks off! I barbecue this over mesquite on my Weber for added flavor...and medium rare is the way to go. Recommend serving it with couscous topped with roasted vegetables (red bell peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, red onion, fresh basil, garlic and balsamic) and a sprinkling of feta cheese. Your guests will think they've died and gone to heaven.

This was the centerpiece of my Easter dinner, but never made it to the dinner table as bone-in lamb took much longer to broil than I had thought. The best pieces of lamb were lightly charred on the outside adding a great texture and bringing out the full flavor of the spices. Next time I'm definitely putting this on the grill to make sure every piece gets its fair share of char.

Great flavors! Impressive dish that's easy to make. I broiled the lamb per other reviewer's suggestions and it was great.

Wonderful flavors! I served the lamb on pitas with greek salad and tzatziki sauce and it was awesome. The day before I was going to serve it I cut up the onions and garlic for this recipe and the Jerk chicken wings (on this site) in the processor. Then I divided the mixture and finished each of the marinades separately. Served the wings the first night after marinating several hours and the lamb the next night after marinating overnight. Both recipes were excellent!

Fabulous recipe! Well worth the little effort required. Had to omit the hot sauce as family members can't take it, and broil instead of barbequing, and it was still wonderful. Served it with a tzatziki recipe (yeah, I know, mixing cultures. But honestly, if it tastes good, who cares!) that someone wrote in and middle eastern flat breat.

This was a great recipe. Unfortunatly I wasn't able to grill the lamb so I put it under the broiler. Still I got a delicious Browned outside and a beautiful pick middle. The spice rub was fabulous. I was only able to marinate for 3 hours but it didn't matter it was still great. Served with moroccan spiced vegetables and quinoa pilaf (recipes also on this site).

I've made this lamb several times since it came out in Bon Apetit. It's just truly delicious and easy. Great leftovers too! Just as a side note, the original article came as a part of a grilling special, several meat, poultry and fish recipes. I've made about 8 of them (porterhouse steaks with paprika butter, chicken/mint/onion kebabs, Grilled shrimp w/roasted garlic sauce...) and they are all frequent repeats at my house. Now I just have to make the rest. ;-)

All I can do is add my raves to the three pages of superlatives. I would urge folks who buy the boned legs of lamb pretied to take it apart and create two more or less flat pieces to grill. More meat surfaces are exposed to the exquisite marinade that way.

Rating: 3
This is an outstanding recipe, even with 2t. of tabasco in the rub! However, where it really shined was as left overs. With the meat sliced thin, make a mixture of diced cucumbers, feta, diced spanish onion, fresh parsley and dill, held together with a dash of olive oil and lemon juice (william Sonoma grilling book) ... a pita has never been so good! Definetly try this!

A company pleaser - this is now my standard lamb recipe. The 13 ingredients make a flavorful and fragrant paste and grilling adds the perfect smokey complement. I froze the unused marinade and used it as a chicken rub (prior to indirect grilling). Either dish goes well with a couscous salad and roasted asparagus.

I made this dish for friends who are "foodies" and they pronounced it "the best lamb ever." I'd recommend grilling the lamb only until it's rare to medium-rare because it will cook more after it's off of the grill and there's more jus that way.

When everyone sat down for dinner and finally took a bite, there was complete silence and a look of euphoria on the faces of my guests. We all thought it looked great, but didn't expect it to be THAT great! I didn't use the hot sauce in the marinade, because I didn't know what it was. I marinated for 24 hours, and then threw it on the barbeque. We ate it with fresh mint sauce from Trader Joe's. This marinade is now famous in our circle.

Fabulous. Made it for Easter dinner for extended family and everyone loved it. The leg of lamb I had had been rolled, so I marinated and grilled it as it was. It took a little longer than it might have otherwise, but when cooked to 130 degrees it had the full range from medium rare to medium well done. I had some problems with the fir flaring, so do wipe off excess marinade. This one will be back by popular demand.

I swear, this is without a doubt the most amazing lamb recipe I've ever made. The spice rub is to die for. It would be unbelievable on just about any type of meat. I made this for 10 people and everyone wanted me to open my own restaurant. you certainly don't need (and it would be foolish to use) any sauce. The spice rub does it all for you. I will make this again and again.

Hands down the BEST recipe I have ever gotten online (or anywhere for that matter). My entire family is still talking about it--my daughter who still refuses to eat anything with any sort of spice or herb can't get enough, the real cooks in my family were my guests that night and all agreed it was SUBLIME--and my husband looked like that dog on the Milkbone dog commercials from about 40 years ago, floating up to the sky with delight...I tried the recipe on the basis of the rave reviews and can only join the parade with my praise!!
