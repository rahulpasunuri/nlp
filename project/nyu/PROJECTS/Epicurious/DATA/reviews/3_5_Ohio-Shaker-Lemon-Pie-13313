This is a poor comparison for the terrific Shaker lemon pie I had in a restaurant: many layers of thinly sliced lemons with a definite bite. Even though I used 3 large lemons rather than the 2 called for, this recipe ended up with just a shallow layer of slices and a lemony custard top. I'll continue my search for a true Shaker lemon pie recipe.

This pie is to die for, especially if you, like me, find so many North American pies too sweet and lacklustre. It has a full flavour, wonderful texture changes and a pleasant tiny bite back. It can be a bit much for some, so I always serve it with vanilla ice cream, which is a wonderful contrast and takes it to new heights. LOVE it!

I forgot to mention that sliceing two lemons didn't seem like a big deal to me. Use a serrated knife.

This pie sounds crazy (including the peel in the pie?) but it's really delicious. Like candies lemons but better cause it's pie.

If you have a mandoline or your neighbor, mother or cube mate does - this is the occasion to use it. Think lemon slices so thin you can read a newspaper through them. I used the Rose Levy Berenbaum formula - 2 Meyer lemons, 2 cups sugar and marinate overnight. A pinch of salt mitigates some of the bitterness but this is a pie reminescent of lemon curd and marmalade. It's a lovely, complex flavor with tea at the end of a meal.

I'm giving this only 3 forks because I found slicing the blooming lemons a pain in the neck...and they MUST be sliced very thin indeed. It tastes just great, though and as soon as I find the proper slicing tool for the lemons, I'll bake it again!

I really wanted this to work because I loved the idea of the lemon slices in the pie, but yikes! The rind flavor was overpowering. Even the liquid part of the filling tasted of the bitter rinds. I let the lemons macerate for 36 hours and the slices were as thin as I could make them, but the results were basically inedible. I might try this again without the rinds, but more likely I'll stick to lemon bars.

One reviewer said, "my mother made this while I was growing up," and I had to laugh to myself. I guess I was making this while I was growing up. It's been on my recipe-roster since 1993, when I first read it, and I'm sure it will be in 2013, too--assuming I'm still here.

Does anyone know if this pie freezes well? My grandfather loves lemon pie and I was going to make this and freeze it before baking for him.

I have been baking this pie since 1993 and it has become a staple in my Holiday repetoire. Dust the top w sugar if you want to get fancy but this is good just the way it is

I also tried the proportions from Saveur given one of the comments below. It turned out wonderfully. Zesting, then removing the white pith before slicing the fruit is definitely the way to go. I also macerated for 36 hours, and results were blissfully lemonade-like. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to pulse the macerated lemons in the processor since the slices fell apart anyway and left a few rings of membrane in the filling. I love texture, but smaller bits are better.

When they say to slice the lemons thin, they mean really, really, paper-thin. If you have not recently sharpened your knives, I suspect you should simply give up on using the entire fruit, and follow the advice in which you zest the lemons, peel them, and then slice the fruit and add the zest. If the slices aren't thin enough, the maceration time isn't going to be sufficient to sweeten the rind, and there will also be a decidedly chewy quality to the pie. The chewy aspect was really the worst part of it when I tried it, with meyer lemons from a backyard tree. Meyers will not save you from the need to slice very thinly. Given the amount of time necessary to slice lemons so thinly, and the ho-hum outcome, I'd rather make a lemon curd tart when I'm looking for pucker power.

I made this for the Easter weekend, using Meyer lemons and following the recipe exactly. I don't know what happened, but it was absolutely disgusting--so bad that the only reason people kept eating it was to be polite. We had to pick out the rinds because the taste and texture of those was terrible; when the rinds were removed, it was somewhat more edible. Actually I think the crust and filling were good; it was just those nasty rinds that ruined it. Really disappointing. But on a positive note, I don't think my family will ever forget that particular Easter dessert!

The version of this recipe I made was from Saveur magazine, and it was amazing. I used my own crust recipe, and made it as a double crust pie. The filling recipe from Saveur magazine was slightly different: 2 c. sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt, 2 lemons, 4 eggs, 1/4 c. melted butter and 3 tbsp. flour. You zest the lemons, and add the zest and very thinly sliced fruit to the salt and sugar mixture, letting it macerate for 24 hours (I let it go 36 hours). You whisk the eggs until frothy, then whisk the melted butter and flour into the eggs until smooth. Then mix the egg mixture into the fruit and sugar mixture until blended. The taste is like a cross between a really zippy lemon curd, and the best-ever lemon marmalade (i.e., there is some bitterness, but more than enough sweetness to compensate). I used regular lemons, and I'd be interested to try Meyers to see if there's any difference. This is a great pie.

it's really necessary to macerate the lemons for 24 hours, if you're using ordinary lemons. 8 hours isn't nearly long enough unless you've got meyer lemons, or something else very thin-skinned.

Found this recipe many years ago via Esquire, never forgot its simple, mouth-vivid brilliance. Bur surely there is a way to free it from is reliance on Demon Sugar. Lots of Demon Sugar. Can anyone suggest what to use instead, and how much? Thanks.

I've made this pie several times and though it is unconventional, it is a hit. Make sure you allow the lemons and sugar to "marinate" long enough to soften and sweeten. It's a taste of Shakertown in Pleasant Hill, KY.

I'd agree that this pie isn't very successful with conventional lemons. The crust is a keeper, though.

My mother made this recipe while I was growing up. The main thing to remember is to slice the lemons very thin. This is a delicious pie. I like to brush my top crust with milk and sprinkle sugar on it. I have made this recipe many many times and heartily recommend it.

I have to disagree with the previous reviewer---the whole point of this pie is that the lemons are used rind and all. It should be noted, though, that thick-skinned conventional lemons won't work nearly as well as thin-skinned Meyer lemons. (Whipped cream with bits of candied ginger is a nice accompaniment.)

Recipe could benefit by grating the lemon peel or using just the zest along with the peeled and sliced lemons. It is a great two crust pie and most people have not had lemon pie of this type The recipe for Two-Crust Lemon Pie in Bon Appetit of October 1977 was similar but probably better for flavor of filling.
