I wavered between 3 & 4 stars, but for its simplicity and the fact that it's just a salad, I think it deserves 4 stars. Would serve on its own as a first course or as a side with a main course. I just shredded the brussels sprouts in my food processor as others suggested, and used pecans in place of walnuts because I had them (still used walnut oil), otherwise I left it as is. Definitely a more acidic vinaigrette, which I prefer, but the added components at the end balance it out so don't hold back on the drizzled oil, parm (I zested it) and lemon zest. Really delicious!

This recipe was just okay and I probably won't make again. It was a little bland. The walnut vinaigrette was definitely a keeper and I will use that again in other ways. If I made this again, I would increase the walnut vinaigrette amount.

Delicious - I also agree that it's too time consuming to core the sprouts. I'll just cut them up next time.

Made this last night and it was so good. We love brussels sprouts and are always looking for new and unique ways to prepare them and this was a keeper. The vinaigrette was incredible. So fresh and crisp and adds a great color to your plate.

I would definitely follow the recommendations of other reviews and perhaps just shave the sprouts or use a mandaline. This was an unusual recipe and for a person that DOES NOT like brussel sprouts I ate more than my share. Definitely needs more walnut olive drizzeled over the end result. For me this was a one time recipe.

This was delicious.Life is too short to prep the sprouts like that so I just sliced them in my food processor.

wonderful recipe, makes enough to serve 12 as a first course. used white wine vinegar instead of champagne and skipped the shallots because I added a mustard that contained them. added walnut oil to taste to vinaigrette, 1 Tbsp. not enough

Delicious! That said, I wouldn't prepare the sprouts as directed next time. Waaaay too time consuming. I will try shredding them with the mandolin - should be fine, and take about a quarter of the time.
