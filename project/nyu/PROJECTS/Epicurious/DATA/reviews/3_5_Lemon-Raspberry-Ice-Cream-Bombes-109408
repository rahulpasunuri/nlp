I made these as dessert for a birthday dinner and they were a huge hit. Very fussy and a little frustrating to make, but the lemon filling is to die for. Raspberries and lemon are one of my favorite combinations. My friend is very health conscious, so I lightened it a bit by using low-fat frozen yogurt. I have one left in the freezer, and I'm looking forward to enjoying it again tonight. If you're looking for an elegant dessert that is sure to wow your guests, this one is worth the trouble.

I made these last night and they were a HIT!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I also used plastic wrap as another reviewer recommended. Also after each stage of freezing, I smoothed each layer with a warm spoon because I found the layers settled during freezing and it made a nicer presentation - especially with the first stage (the outer shell). I found I was able to cut down the total freezing times by about half - each layer froze much quicker than the recipe calls for. I also froze the lemon cream for about 1/2 hour before layering it in the dishes - which cut about 5 hours off the chilling time for that component.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Very refreshing - I served with with raspberry sauce. Would make again.

Ok. Ok. So I haven't tried this yet, but I could not contain myself about the individual calling someone a moron over a spelling issue. Have you not made a spelling error? Ever? I gave the recipe 3 forks as it sounds so delicious and I have to bring a desser to a barbeque I'm going to. This is the one. I trust all the other reviews our there are about the dish and not my or the bomb(e)persons. Keep up the good work Epicurious, I love your site

Delightful! Makes a wonderful presentation and tastes great too. When I make this again, I will reduce the amount of ice dream by a little bit, leaving more room for the lemon cream and sorbet.

My husband said this was the best dessert he had ever eaten. We belong to a group that meets once a month for dinner and everyone contributes. This one was a big hit.

My son made this dessert for Easter for the family. His love of baking and desserts really came through with this dish. It was delicious and looked as if it came right out of the magazine. Bon Appetit once again had the right recipe for the right time.

If someone is going to call someone else a complete moron, perhaps they should learn how to spell bombe before they post.

This is a great spring time treat. As an aside, let's avoid referring to other reviewers as "complete morons". We need more civility, not less.

Anyone complaining about the difficulty of this recipe is a complete moron. This is as easy as easy gets. The foil was fine. I guess the people complaining about the bombs slipping around their plates have never served ice cream before. Ice cream should not be served rock hard. It should sit out for 10-15 minutes before serving. Hello? This is a great recipe. Really easy and everyone raved. I would make this again in a heartbeat. The best part is they can be made a few days in advance. Just cutting them in half is presentation enough.

Yum! I used home-made frozen strawberry slush type stuff, which worked well. I made them in tea-cups (we have very round ones) and then cut them in half, serving half to each person. It worked well, looked lovely and everyone praised them. The only change I will make next time is to add more of the lemon cream. It's delicious!

I don't like rasberries but everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. It is too time consuming for me but I would repeat - ONLY for verrrrry special occasions where I have allotted extra preparation time. 4 forks! for taste.

Delicious. In response to the cook from NY.....perhaps that is why it is pictured on a square plate with sides.

I agree with the first review,it is very pretty and very tasty, the reasons I would not make this again are, it slips and slides all over one's plate, it is an easy recipe but time consuming to assemble. tip: it is almost impossible to use the foil lining, I used plastic wrap and the results were excellent. Not worth the time and effort!

I made this recipe for a dinner club for 10, it was fabulous. I made the lemon creme one day and assembled the bombs the next. The flavors were fabulous. My only suggestion would be to possibly make it in a loaf pan and serve it in slices for a really nice presentation.
