Made it for my family and everyone loved the flavor but the cut of lamb was too fatty. I would use different cut.

The cut of lamb was indeed inexpensive but so fatty that it was almost too much. If it wasn't for the pesto, I might not have finished.

I got rave reviews on this recipe - I increased the quantity of pesto and added more garlic and mint than called for. The lamb was cooked as meat-only kebabs on the grill after marinating all day in the oil/garlic/rosemary (I didn't have fresh so the dried leaves were mixed in too) and the pesto was added on by each person as a condiment after cooking. We all loved it.

I loved this recipe -- although after reading the first reviewer's comments I compared the pesto recipe to other mint pesto recipes on this site and amended it. I used 2 cups of mint leaves, 2 large cloves of garlic, about 2 Tbsp. grated cheese and a substantial pinch of hot red pepper. It was delicious with the lamb, which we cooked on the grill. My husband is not a fan of lamb, and loved the dish.

I was completely surprised at how unpleasant the pesto tasted, because I was so sure it would be delicious. We all scraped it off and tossed it. Skip this one.

Something seemed "off" with the flavors of this. For my money, Grilled Lamb with Horseradish-Mint Sauce is a better bet.
