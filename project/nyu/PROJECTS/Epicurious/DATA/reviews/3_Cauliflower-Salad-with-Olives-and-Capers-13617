We loved this! Better the next day.

Eww. And I love what anchovies do to vegetables so it wasn't that. But this was bad enough that it got a bite or two and then tossed into the dustbin.

I made this years ago, when it was first published. I liked it, and it was an attractive addition to a buffet. However, it was not a hit with the in-laws, who admittedly are not adventurous eaters. The smell was very strong. I might make it again for guests with more sense of adventure - maybe for an outdoor event ...

This is a fine salad recipe but when I place it in my recipe box, it lists its main ingredient as FISH!

To make it more colorful and nutritious, I added steamed crinkle-cut carrots, and fresh red bellpeppers.

I liked the recipe but found it to be less of a hit with my guests. I think the smell of the olives and capers with califlower was the turn off to this dish

Outstanding dish for any summertime buffet. I actually steamed my florets, and added the (whisked, not processed) dressing while they were still very warm. I think the cauliflower absorbs better that way. I used celery, oilves and red onions, omitting the pickled peppers. To be sure, this salad was much better the next day, and even the day after that.

Excellent flavors and textures. I already had a homemade vinaigrette made without anchovies and it worked great. Leftovers kept well, but preferred it freshly made. Think it's important to add the dressing while the cauliflower is still a bit warm to absorb the best flavors.
