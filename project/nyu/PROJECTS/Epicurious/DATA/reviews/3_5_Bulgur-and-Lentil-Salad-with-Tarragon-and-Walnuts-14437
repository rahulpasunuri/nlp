This is a fantastic dish. Amazingly flavorful, vegan, and even fairly suitable for a rawtarian. I often double it and have days worth. I find quinoa cooked in vegetable broth to offer a better texture and nutritive value than bulgur, which also, I believe, makes it gluten-free. I make this often enough that I just add more rice and/or cider vinegar along with leftover tarragon to a bottle so it's ready for the next batch. Up the walnuts, add a drizzle of walnut oil...

Excellent! The fresh tarragon and tarragon vinegar give the humble ingredients great flavor. I would not change a single thing about this recipe.

this was "OK." other than using canned lentils, I followed the recipe. Seemed like it needed something. I tried the splash of lemon and extra tarragon vinegar, but it was still pretty boring. My vegetarian son weighed in that the carrots should be omitted, but it's more than that.

This was incredibly delicious, even though my tastes trend toward carbonara over healthy stuff. I added a half cup of sun-dried tomatoes, but I tried it before adding them and it was still tasty. I used coarse bulgur and French green lentils, which I think really make a difference here. The best part of this salad was the texture. The combination of ingredients gives it an addictive crunch, which made it hard to put down.

Even with 87% favorable rating, I didn't think it would be that good. Trader Joe's lentils made it really easy. I just used white wine vinegar and fresh tarragon. I'd keep the walnuts on the side until served, especially for leftovers.

very easy, great taste and reviews from eaters!

Easy to make and a great vegetarian dish. I added lemon juice with dijon mustard to give it a bit of zing and added some cubed avocado for some creamy texture. Both went great with the nuts, lentils and chewy bulgur wheat.

I've made this recipe a few times already. I use the precooked lentils from TJ's, and bulgar cooked in broth to start with. First time, I made it with red pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, and walnuts with tarragon and parsley, then garnished with good feta. We gobbled it up. it paired great with grilled trout topped with blistered cherry tomatoes and a parsley, tarragon, lemon vinaigrette and was an impressive meal fit for guests. Second time I stuck a little more to the recipe in terms of vegetables, but had only mint and parsley. I still added sundried tomatoes. I took it to a potluck and got tons of compliments. This will be a staple, and we love that it tastes great but is still very healthy!

Very easy to make. I didn't have all of the ingredients - had to substitute red wine vinegar for tarragon vinegar (though I added plenty of fresh tarragon) and used red onion instead of shallot. To make this a bit lighter I used only 2 T of oil and I only had 1/4 cup of walnuts - but the results are great! Light & fluffy. I'll definitely make it again.

This was marvelous. However, I doctored mine up with some additional items which made a huge difference in the overall taste. First, I added sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese per a previous poster's recommendation. I also doubled my recipe, however, I went easy on the tarragon (I only used what the original recipe called for). I did not have tarragon vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and was very generous with it. (I probably used more like 1/4 cup for the whole salad). Lastly, I added Greek Kalamata olives spread into the mix (diced olives will do). This made a huge difference and really put the finishing touches on the salad. My only complaint is the amount of time that it took to pull it all together. After chopping the ingredients and waiting for the lentils and bulgar to cool, about 3 hours had passed before I was finished. Nonetheless it was great and I will definitely make this again!

Tasty salad. I put in half the bulgur, some sun-dried tomatoes, more vinegar, oil and carrots. My kids would like cucumber in stead of celery next time. Nutritious and cheap...

This is delicious - one of our favorite bulgur salads.

I love this recipe. I used pecans instead of walnuts (toasted), dried tarragon, and threw in a handful of dried cranberries.

We love this elegant, subtle salad. I've made it for years. I usually add a bit more tarragon vinegar and fresh herbs; you can also add a little more olive oil if it's dry. French green lentils are essential. This is not a cook-out salad -- nicer with fish or lighter meats or as part of a salad buffet.

Really nice, delicately flavored salad--would make a great tabouleh alternative. French lentils, which are small, make a difference. I was generous with the tarragon, and I also tried it with toasted sliced almonds instead of walnuts, to add variety in texture.

Excellent, with a few changes: add chopped sundried tomatoes (in oil) and crumble some feta (or even blue cheese-- it's surprisingly good with tarragon) into the salad; it makes a world of difference!

I thought that this recipe was missing something. It's just not very interesting as is.

We liked this, but didn't love it. It is lacking something that I can't put my finger on--it's a little dry and needs a taste to make it more zippy. I did appreciate that it is a healthy and relatively easy dish to make. Would be great for lunch with a spinach salad. Since it's supposed to be served at room temp, it is a good dish to bring to a potluck or picnic.

It is an attactive, tasty dish but I added some olive oil and red pepper.

This is great and my 4 year old loves it! I chop the carrots fine and increase the amount. Definitely do not use brown lentils; the french green lentils keep the salad from becoming mushy. Like all vinegar-based salads, the "edge" comes off it if it sits overnight. Great the next day.

Like an earlier reviewer, I would add more vegetables the next time I make this dish. Still, I did think it was delicious -- albeit not the prettiest entree I've ever made.

I didn't have any celery on hand, but a zuchinni work well as a substitute. I also used dried tarragon and added just a dash of smoked chipotle chile powder to give it a kick. I might add some dried fruit next time like currants or cherries.

A nice change and a good balance of tastes.

Too filling; I'll try it again but with a few changes : double quantities of celery and carrots, half of bulgur . No need to cook the bulgur : just add enough hot water to cover, mix, let stand until most of water has been absorbed, strain keeping some moisture.
