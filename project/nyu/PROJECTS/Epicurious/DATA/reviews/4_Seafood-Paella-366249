Excellent starter - we used half smoked paprika and half sweet, added chorizo, which was sliced thin and cooked in onion mix before tomatoes then removed. Prior to adding shrimp to rice, we seasoned with smoked paprika and salt, and at the end added back in the chorizo, peas and finished with green olives with pimento. It also cooked 15 mins longer than perscribed time. Delish and lots of flavor!

We tried this recipe recently for a dinner party and it worked out great. Our local Costo has bags of mixed frozen seafood, which we used, so the prep time was minimal. I was able to have the whole dish ready before the guests arrived. When they showed up I poured in the boiling broth and put the pan on the barbecue (it didn't fit on the stove top). After about 15 minutes I put in the balance of the seafood, except for the mussels, which I just warmed over steam. It turned out the dish was very forgiving, as I had to start and stop while I separated the seafood. It presented beautifully!

I love this recipe. I've used it as a base several times and get rave reviews over and over and over. As for the squid's cooking times, I've heard with squid, you either cook it very quickly or you cook it very long and slowly. It's never been tough, as I opt for the long and slow. Also, I use smoky paprika, rather than sweet, as I prefer that extra depth of flavor. I can't wait to serve it tonight for Game Night with a couple different sangrias!

I've never made Paella before but this was delicious and our friends loved it. A little chilli would add a little more spice. I cooked the seafood (in our case: squid rings, salmon & shelled prawns) separately. The salmon was grilled, the squid and prawns fried off in a little garlic and the remaining sauce poured over the rice.

As previously mentioned, a good starting point, we added more seafood and the artichoke hearts and peas. Regarding the squid cooking time, 30 minutes for baby squid makes them soft and tender, it's like making pot roast.

This sounds like a great, simple Paella recipe. However, a total of 30 minutes for cooking the squid sounds like rubber to me. I'm wondering about adding it with the shrimp to avoid overcooking.

A decent paella. Not blow your mind good, but worthy of becoming a base line for creating something really good.
