This is sooo easy and so versatile. We loved it the way it is (even my extremely picky step daughter) but had a ton of ideas for next time. I will shred zucchini from my garden and lay the fish on a nice bed of veggies next time. Great weeknight dinner and even for casual company

This is a delicious, healthy, quick and easy meal to make. I used baby bay scallops, which weren't bursting with flavour, but were good. Could try it with shrimp as well. Served on a bed of grated zucchini (from the tip given in another review).

I have made this many times for my family, and is always a big hit! Very easy to put together, and makes a nice presentation.
