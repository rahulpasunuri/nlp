It is so hard to get my fiance to eat ANYTHING. He is very picky. But the first time I made this he LOVED it. He asks me to make it all the time now. The only changes I made were: - I don't use a food processor. It turns out just fine if everything is coarsely chopped. - I added two more slices of bread. It made it less mushy. - I'm a bacon freak so I use a whole package of bacon. What I don't put on top, I cut up and put in the mix. - I added cheese. I put cheese in the middle and formed the meatloaf around it... DELICIOUS. - I added green pepper. (just as much green pepper as onion) - I added an extra 10 to 15 minutes - And I don't add the left over ketchup until the last 20 minutes or so (if you do it at the beginning it burns and I don't like burnt ketchup)

Very good but a little mushy. Made with ground turkey and turkey pastrami.

Way too much onion and white bread, made it too soft, wet and mushy. It fell apart. One hour at 400 F was not enough to cook it through. I'd have to completely revamp the recipe for this to be edible.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! We love beef and bacon equally so the two flavors together are delicious. He surprised me one night after I gave him the task of cooking us dinner with this flavorful, hardy meatloaf. It's super easy to make and it was also a hit at our housewarming a few months ago! We used organic and lean ingridients and it makes for great leaftovers!

I loved the recipe. It was a new flavor expirience from just everyday meatloaf. Also we had some leftovers (it serves 4 and it's just my husband and I) So I broke it up and used it with potatos and eggs for breakfast burritos. Was delicious in both incarnations. I had some trouble with it holding together but I figure a bit more bread may fix the issue.

I made this recipe several months ago and didn't bother saving this website and was I sorry! Well, I now have it and I'm here to tell you that this meatloaf rocked! I have no idea what some of these other people are talking about when they say it doesn't taste good. If you are a "healthy eater" and you see bacon in the ingredients, you might want to move on. It is easy to make and I had no problem with it falling apart (I used 90% ground beef).

This is fabulous! Using stale bread is ideal but not essential. This is a keeper

Made tonight. Loved by the family. Mine held together great. Followed the recipe exactly as stated except my beef was only 7% fat. Poored what little grease it had off as soon as it came out of oven. This will be a keeper for a easy weeknight meal.

Mine turned out great the first time, second time, third time....I used half as much bread to cut down on carbs and didn't notice any difference in taste or consistency. My bread was kind of dry so maybe that helped like other people have indicated. Very tasty and I don't even like meat loaf that much....

Just made this tonight. The flavor was great, but it didn't hold together super-well. Using bread which is more on the dry side will help. The idea of a free-form loaf is good, for better draining of fat. Cooking bacon ahead and adding milk to the bread will not help:^)

The idea of a free-form loaf is good also, for better draining of the fat. The very first reviewer changed the recipe by cooking the bacon beforehand, and adding milk to the bread, and then thought the recipe was terrible?! Sorry, no sympathy - even being "originnaly" from the midwest. I'm originally from Mich., where we also ate meatloaf.

We enjoyed this recipe. Followed it exactly as written, but would make in a free form loaf next time. In the loaf pan the juices bubbled over and made a mess of the oven. Very easy for the results-no pre-cooking the ingredients and leftovers for the next day.

I thought this was a great meatloaf. I used regular bacon to cut down on the fat and slices of a firm semolina bread. Next time, I would use a vidalia onion as my husband didn't care for the flavor of the red onion.

Bacon AND Beef. How could this recipe possibly be bad?! It was. There was an unidentified flavor present that was not entirely welcome. Additionally, the consistency (probably due to the sandwich bread) is best described as "soggy." I am trying to decide whether or not to throw the leftovers away with the recipe.

YUCK!!!! This meatloaf was so fatty due to the bacon I guess. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but even using 7% beef resulted in a fatty, greasy end product. And except for the change to 7% beef, I followed the recipe exactly. Am throwing this recipe away! I'm wondering how others thought this was good??!!

fair. I prefer a mix of ground veal, beef and pork. I chop small onion, 2 celery,2 carrot and 2 garlic. Add with several day old sourdough bread crumbs and a mix ok chili sauce and ketchup. I put on a rack free form over cookie sheet and make a mix of open pit barbeque, brown sugar, and chopped crystallized ginger and baste all over and sides till done. Let sit 10 minutes before carving

We thought this was wonderful comfort food for a cold winter night. Great flavor and very easy to make. Beware: it makes a mess of the oven!

Incredibly moist and flavorful meatloaf. The combination of ketchup and bacon adds a smoky sweetness that heightens this American traditional meal. Following directions should lead to tasty results, i.e. do not pre-cook bacon or use additional liquid. Plus, this is the meal that keeps on giving -- delicious meatloaf sandwiches during the work week.

I really enjoyed this recipe also. Great winter dish.

I actually really liked this recipe. If I hadn't already bought the ingredients, I might not have made it, based on it's only review. I didn't have a food processor either, so I was careful to chop the bacon, onion and bread really fine. I always like the end pieces of the meatloaf so I decided to bake miniature ones with a jumbo muffin tin. I also didn't have any parsley so skipped that. It wasn't exactly the meatloaf that I'm used to, but I will definitly make it again.

This was so terrible we had to throw it out. I think it was my fault, as I was making it at my parent's house, and they didn't have a food processor, so I chopped up the bacon ahead of time, and cooked it. For the bread, I tore it into pieces, and added a bit of milk to soften it. It was total mush, and the worst thing I have ever made. Interested to hear about other's results by following the recipe. I am a good cook, and I am very embarrassed that I made something so terrible. Plus, even though I am originnaly from the mid-west where we ate meatloaf once a week, I never make this at home. It was a bad experience.
