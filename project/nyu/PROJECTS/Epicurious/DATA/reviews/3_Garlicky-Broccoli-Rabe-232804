This is pretty tasty. I don't think I use that much oil, but to be honest I don't really measure.

Made this for Christmas dinner to go with roasted potatoes and pork loin. Easy and delicious! Even the kids ate it. I did reduce the quantity of oil slightly.

This recipe was very good, but, to our taste, it would have been better with half the oil that the recipe calls for, so 1/6 cup of olive oil instead of 1/3. We used 1/4 cup and while it wasn't cloying it definitely could have used less. Otherwise, excellent yet simple side dish.

This recipe is outstanding. I will always use it whenver I make broccoli raab from now on! The texture is perfect and the flavors are bold and delicious. A perfect accompaniment for game and duck.
