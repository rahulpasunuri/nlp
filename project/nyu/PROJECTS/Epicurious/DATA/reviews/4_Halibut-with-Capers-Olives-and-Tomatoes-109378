Excellent as is! Since Halibut has become so pricey, I will try substituting chicken next time and using a Tblsp or two of lemon juice in place of the clam juice.

This is a lovely dish... I made the sauce first, and added some succhini too, then baked the fish in the sauce in a small dishes so that everyone had their own individual servings in the sauce. Baked for 15-18 minutes. minutes and then served in a small shelled dished baked Served with a green salad. I see other variations of this receipe I want to try out... Definitely a keeper.

I made this, subbing in cod for halibut and more wine for clam juice. It was very flavorful and very easy--worth repeating!

Execellent! I used grape tomotoes and served the dish over pearlized couscous. This is a delicious and beautiful meal that is easy to make.

I made this recipe a few months ago and it was delicious. I used cherry tomatoes instead of plums and baked the fish (did not dredge in flour) topped with the sauce in the oven for about 20 minutes or so. Served with rice and salad. Perfect quick dinner!

This was actually the first time I've cooked fish so I was a bit apprehensive at first but this recipe did not disappoint. I followed the directions verbatim and my dinner guests loved it. I'll definitly be making this again.

I made this recipe as written except I used whole wheat flour. Everyone loved it, both my teenagers and husband who normally does not like halibut. Its a keeper. Should work well with all types of fish.

Made exact to recipe except I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil because all I had on hand was extra virgin which tends to burn easily. Very tasty and I loved the sauce which is very versatile and could be used with just about anything. I would give this 3.5 stars if I could.

I was pleasantly surprised by this quick and easy recipe - it was really tasty! I had to replace clam juice w/ chicken broth, and the olives with a Tbsp of TJ's tapenade. I did not use wine - Sauce tasted plenty good w/out addition of broth or wine, but I added a smidgen of chicken broth at the end to release the "fond and cooked down the sauce. I doubled the amount of capers and pepper due to personal preference and it worked well!

This receipe was fast, easy and delicous. Even my 8 year old loved it! I did not have all the ingredients on hand so I substituted broth for the clam juice and canned diced tomatoes for the fresh ones. Also I omitted the crushed red pepper and basil because I did not have those items on hand either. The recipe was still delicious and presented beautifully. I can not wait to make it again using all the ingredients listed.

Wow! My husband loves good food and although he never complains I know when he really loves a recipe. He loves this one! I forgot the basil so put a tsp dried thyme in place of it. Forgot the capers, too, but I know adding them will just add more flavor next time. This one is a keeper!

Great recipe! I used onions instead of shallots and skipped the clam juice since I didn't have it on hand and it was still delicious. I paired this with Israeli couscous with toasted pine nuts (another epicurious recipe) and it was a hit--even my picky 5 and 3 year old children gobbled it up.

The first time, I made it with Chilean Sea Bass, it was out of this world, I used vegetables broth instead of clam juice which I didnt have at home. It was easy and delicious, the second time, I made it with Halibut. It is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious, if you love Kalamata Olives, which I do. I substituted Panko break crumbs for the flour, then realized it was intended to help thicken the sauce. So, I added about a 1/4 tsp. of corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce a bit. I didn't have plum tomatoes, so I substituted halved grape tomatoes. No problem. Didn't even deseed them. Other than that, I actually had clam juice on hand from a previous recipe (not usually a staple in my house) so it was very close to the original recipe. The halibut was wild Alaskan, so that helps, too. I served it with brown basmati rice (with the sauce on top) and it was a hit with the hubby. Definitely a keeper and would be great for company.

Rating: 4
This gives such a wonderful flavor to the halibut and you do not need all the ingredients for success! I substituted white onion for shallot, canned tomato for plum tomato, and dried basil for fresh and it was just as good as when I've made the topping with all fresh ingredients. Guests love this easy dish. I serve the fish on a bed of easy risotto--yum! I might suggest starting to make the this WHILE the fish cooks, rather than after the fish is cooked (as the directions state), as the fish cools quickly and it takes more than a minute for everything in the topping to come together.

This was absolutely delicious, and easy. I substituted sablefish for the halibut, and it was wonderful. Will definitely make again.

Great with fresh end of summer tomatoes (seeds and juicy pulp cut out ) & basil! The pan fried fish was crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. I added a dash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce and tossed it with some leftover linguine from the fridge to heat up the pasta. Boiled buttered green beans on the side (8 minutes in the boiling water).

This is an excpetional recipe for halibut! It is super easy. Since I didn't have just clam juice, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a can of minced clams (with its juice). I also decided to sub the tomatoes for canned diced tomatoes. Such great flavors for such a wonderful fish! A keeper!

What a surprise, I had no idea this would be this good going into it. I substituted sweet vermouth for the white wine and didn't use the clam juice, but it still turned out great. Will definitely make again.

I made this with cod instead of halibut, and didn't use the clam juice. It turned out wonderfully, "restaurant quality" as my partner called it. I think it would also be good with swordfish or tilapia.

Excellent dish. I did a few changes: I used the orange zest at the advice of other reviewers; I also used fresh-squeezed orange juice instead of orange slices; I didn't use olives either; and instead of canned tomatoes, I used peeled, fresh tomatoes. Everyone loved it.

This is a wonderful and simple recipe. I used chicken stock instead of clam juice and omitted the flour because I didn't have those ingredients on hand. I also had a very thick halibut steak so I sauteed it for much longer than suggested - until I could see on the side that the fish was opaque all the way through. I stuck the leftover tomato mixture with the extra couscous in the fridge and it was even more delicious the next day.

I have made this dish several times now and enjoy it each time. I actually keep coming back to it because it is super fresh and flavorful. Always a crowd pleaser. Make a whole mediterranean theme dinner; with hummus and tzadiski (sp?) appetizers, etc. and it is sure to please.

Starting with the freshest halibut, this recipe is easy to vary with ingredients on hand. I skipped the flour, for example, and used diced onion, sun dried tomatoes, and fresh mint as substitutes. An easy and flavorful pan sauce for the fish.

Rating: 3
This was delicious, and quite easy, once the prep work was done. Used red snapper, as halibut was $20/lb. at the store, and found it to be a good substitute. Very satisfying . . . added garlic, and doubled the clam juice & wine, as previously suggested . . . otherwise, wouldn't change a thing. Great for guests or just a delicious, relatively healthy weeknight meal. --Bisous

This dish was de-lish. I think the key is using good quality fish. I used chilean sea bass instead of halibut and it was really good.

Perhaps not beyond compare, but certainly something which brings out wonderful summer flavors from tomatoes and basil. A real Med style dish which would be good with some garlic in the sauce as well.

I halved the recipe and the only change I made was to add a 6.5oz can of minced clams with their juice instead of the plain clam juice. I served it over rice and truly impressed my boyfriend. This is a keeper....so is he!

I chose this recipe for the delicious sounding complex sauce because we had grouper, not our favorite fish. Although the taste is mild, the flesh is somewhat coarse. An excellent recipe. I changed little, except used regular tomatoes rather than plum, and fewer olives. Basically I made the same amount of sauce, although my grouper fillets weighted less than the 6-7 ounce halibut fillets. I served quinoa on the side, a good choice. Couscous or rice would also go well. I'll definitely make this again with any mild white fish. I'd add half a star to my review if I could!

Rating: 4
Hesitant to spend lots of $$ on a new recipe, I used cod which was 1/2 the price of halibut. It was DELICIOUS, and my boyfriend, not a big fish fan, loved it and called it "restuarant quality!" I served it over couscous with sauteed spinach on the side. Next time I'll add a bit more wine and shallots, as the olives and capers were a bit overpowering. Yum!

Rating: 3
I did as a previous review suggested and increased the amount of clam juice and wine. The sauce seemed to watery so I cooked it longer than 4min. I think by doing this I cooked out some of the flavor. I would recommend decreasing the cooking time of the fish to around 2-3 min. per side and keeping them in a 325 degree oven, they turned out perfect. I served them with broiled asparagus. Squeezing just a bit of fresh lemon juice over top just before serving added a good flavor.

This was a delicious way to cook halibut. Instead of using clam juice, I added a dozen small clams in their shell with the tomatoes, capers, basil and wine. It made a nice presentation.

This dish is really quick and easy once the ingredients are prepared (ahead). I substitute a can of diced tomatoes in sauce for the fresh tomatoes, which provides a more luxurious amount of delicious sauce. Also, reduce time for halibut searing to two minutes per side.

Excellent! Halibut is in season right now and in Seattle we get get it very fresh which probably added to the success of this dish. I did not make any substiturions but I decreased the cooking time of the fish to 3 minutes on each side and that was perfect. Overcooking halibut really dries it out.

Wow! This was delicious! My husband raved about this and went back for seconds. Served this with fresh halibut, couscous and fresh green string beans. My new fave for halibut. I followed the recipe pretty much as directed, although I never really measure ingredients throughly. Made some extra on the topping and glad I did and was nice mixed with the couscous. Next time will mix garlic with the shallots and maybe use a bit less dried red pepper. We loved it, but might be a bit much for those sensative to a hot spice.

This was a wonderful fast and easy recipe. I substituted chicken broth for the clam broth, minced onions for the shallots, and I added artichoke hearts as another reviewer suggested. I cooked the fish the same way somebody else recommended: 4 min per side in a pan, then I put it in the oven at 325 for a little while while I made the sauce. All the flavors were perfect together and I would happily make this again!

I'm lucky to live in an area that has abundant fresh halibut. So I thought I'd try out something for a midweek dinner to please my wife and young kids. I used sliced black olives, not Kalamata olives, I did't have any wine on hand so I used extra clam juice, I used crushed chili pepper flakes instead of crushed red peppers. I added a generous amount of garlic which I sauted with the onions. I did cook the halibut approx 4 minutes per side and placed the fish in the oven 350 while I made the sauce. The fish was perfect and the sauce was hit. Even I liked it and I'm my own worst critic. With wine and kalamata olives, I'm sure it would be even better. The real trick is not to kill the fish. Thanks for the recipe!! Even my kids wanted seconds..that doesn't happen often!

I've made this several times now, and the the four different couples we've served it to have given uniform praise and "clean plates". I think the thickness of the fish determines the cooking time per side.

I made this dish w/ only 2 halibut fillets but made the suggested amount of sauce for 4 fillets. Was easy to make and tasted great over yellow rice w/ asparagus. Used black olives instead of kalamata and scallions instead of shallots. Enjoyed it greatly and paired w/ sauvignon blanc - delicious. Will definitely make again.

Since halibut is out of season, I had to sub with grouper. I was very excited about this recipe as it calls for a combination of ingredients I love. As I was cooking, the fish and sauce looked and smelled wonderful and I became increasingly convinced that this dish would taste restaurant quality good, and then.....I was disappointed. The first thing I noticed was that the red pepper flakes dominated and drowned out the flavors of the other ingredients. In addition, there was an unpleasant bitter taste the origin of which I was unsure of....the clam juice, maybe? I'm not giving up on this recipe though. Will try again without pepper flakes, with chicken stock instead of clam juice, and with the halibut the recipe originally called for.

Rating: 4
A hit with with my family. Scrumptious! But, I made a few changes. To make cooking more efficient, I made half the sauce before hand. I sauted the shallots in oil, lightly pulsed the olives and capers and added them with the tomatoes (I used a 14oz can of drained diced tomatoes}to the shallots and set it aside. After cooking the fish, I quickly added the wine to deglaze and then the broth (I used low salt chicken,) and added the prepared sauce to the same pan. Reduced it on high for two minutes, and added the cooked fish. Garnished with chopped parsley,(I didn't have basil) and served it over couscous tossed with chopped fresh mint. Just a little twist to the original, but it was really delicious.

The fish I bought smelled fishy so I soaked it in salt water for 15 minutes (an old technique to reduce fishiness). Then I oversalted the fish (with sea salt) before sauteeing and it affected the flavor. I still rated it 3 forks because that wasn't the recipes fault. The reipe is simple and quick to make and the topping is very good. I served this with a Quinoa recipe for a nice light summer dinner. Definitely buy FRESH fish from a good seafood market.

This dish was a wonderful combination of flavors with each bite being different and exciting. Nice and light and fresh tasting, this will be a fovorite this summer.

Very easy to make!

This was very good - use good quality ingredients...makes a difference. To the cook from Texas who (several reviews earlier) mentioned she would like to use a "less fatty" fish - I think you are confused. Halibut is not "fatty" at all...it's a lean, simple white fish. Are you thinking of salmon...which has more fat, albeit the good kind?
