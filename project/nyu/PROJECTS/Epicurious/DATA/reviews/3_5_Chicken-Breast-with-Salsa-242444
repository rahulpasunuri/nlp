This was so good and really easy. My husband and kids loved it. I didn't make salsa. I used some pineapple salsa we had in the fridge.

my favorite part was how easy this was. i didnt have time to marinate, it was a last minute thing, BUT it was super yummy and i think it is healthy too. ill definitely use this again. lets see what the husband thinks ;o)

I tried this recipe with 4 chicken breasts and store bought salsa instead of the one shown with the recipe. I marinated the chicken for an hour and a half before grilling (following the reccomendations by other reviewers). The end result was good, but I left the table wishing for something more. I served the chicken with grilled zucchini, potatoes and a fresh salad. I reccomend serving the chicken with sliced mango, the citrus flavor mixes well with the sweet fruit. Enjoy...

All my friends who swear by the George Foreman grill need to try this recipe! I was just looking for a quick and easy chicken recipe to pair with pretty much any side. I didn't even make the salsa. Will definitely make again and probably marinate longer as other reviewers suggested.

Loved! Healthy, easy and quick. Changed cilantro for basil and added green scallions to salsa. Delish.

I made a couple changes and it was great - first, I didn't make the salsa in the recipe - I used my own salsa that was already made up. second, I didn't have time to marinate it so it only got about 5 minutes before hitting the broiler - the citrus flavour was there, but mild. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was great and very easy! Like the other reviewer did, I let the chicken marinate for a couple hours and that really helped the citrus flavor pop. I also added corn to the salsa and it was a very fresh and easy meal! I'm making this again soon.

A simple variation on boneless chicken breasts. I marinated the chicken all day and broiled it. Salsa was good. Made a nice dinner with a side dish.

The Salsa was not very good. Recipe might be good with a good Salsa. Never be a favorite with me.
