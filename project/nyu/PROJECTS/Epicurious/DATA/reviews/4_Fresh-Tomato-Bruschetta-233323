Very good! Got compliments from guests. Taragon is a great touch. I made a couple slight modifications. I used fresh home grown tomatoes. (They were not roma or plum types.) Had to drain a lot of juice from chopped tomatoes in a large strainer. I also drizzled the bread with a little bit of olive oil before toasting.

Just made this for guests last night and it was a huge hit! I did not follow the recipe exactly since my goal was to use tomatoes from my garden. Mine was a combo of yellow pear, orange and red cherry tomatoes and a few larger red vine tomatoes. I also left out the tarragon because I was afraid it would overpower the lovely fresh basil, but next time I'll include it. We sat outside and took turns oiling and grilling fresh sliced baguette while our guests sat around the table building their own bruschetta from a big bowl in the center. We sprinkled flake sea salt on top and drizzled with evoo. Four of us devoured an entire baguette and practically slurped the remaining juice out of the bowl. This was a great interactive appetizer! Loved it.

A great recipe! I like it also with a spread of goat cheese.

WONDERFUL!!! As per some of the other reviews, I added a dollop of ricotta cheese on the bread before adding the topping. We also drizzled some balsamic over the prepared plate. Finally, it was easier to simply soak diced garlic in some olive oil and use the infused oil to brush onto the bread before toasting- I broiled on a cookie sheet for about 2 minutes per side.

Very good. A little balsamic is a nice additional layer of flavour (but use the good stuff). I upped the tarragon a little bit because I had so much of it. It was great. The tarragon brings another dimension that subtly separates this from your typical boring bruschetta. I went for all the garlic, and thought it was great.

The bruschettas were delicious. At the end, I added parmesan cheese. In addition, I drizzled some aged balsamic vinegar.

Tasty and very easy. I added the balsamic vinegar at the end instead of including at the beginning before letting the tomatoes marinade. I was concerned my tomatoes would get too mushy sitting in it for two hours. I also pan fried slices of baguette on the stove brushed with olive oil instead of baking.

I LOVE garlic and normally find tomato bruschetta at restaurants a waste of precious stomach space and money... Even if the tomatoes are excellent, they are usually well underspiced in terms of basil and garlic and spiciness. This recipe overcame this with plenty of garlicky punch and a hint of heat. The tarragon was a nice touch though next time I will throw in some fresh oregano as well. I also took a chunk of blue cheese and crumbled it into the tomato mixture before letting it marinate at room temperature.

This was good and fresh, as all have noted. I similarly omitted the garlic extravaganza. I also toasted the bread with the topping on it, which worked out plenty fine.

Very good. Followed the suggestion of some of the other reviews and left off the extra garlic. Then I put ricotta on the baguette slices, spooned the tomato mixture on that and drizzled with a little bit of balsamic vinegar. Wow! Really really good and very easy. Definitely a recipe I will do again.

This recipe was a hit when I made it the first day! I have to double the recipe (making two separate batches) and add another clove of garlic (for my garlic fans) because it goes so fast. Not only has this become a staple, but has become a recipe I use to impress my guests.

I used shallots sauteed in olive oil rather than all that garlic for a more subtle flavour. I did finish with a bit of balsamic though and it was a hit.

I love garlic but 2 tbsp and 6 cloves is a bit much. So I cut it in half. I still have garlic breath from dinner. It's still delicious. I added a tbsp of balsamic vinegar.

Simply delicious!!! Also try "Slow-Braised Tomatoes" on this site...excellent!

Halved the amount of garlic (only 3 cloves), it was great. Perfect to be able to prepare ahead of time and bring to a potluck or serve at dinner party.

This has the highest of WOW factors! Used fresh tomatoes and herbs from my garden. Wish I had doubled it...I will soon!!!

Way too much garlic. It overpowered everything else and was the only thing that we could taste.

Everyone loves bruschetta, but this recipe is so fresh-tasting. Everyone went nuts for it. The tarragon adds that extra flavor no one can pinpoint.

I always follow recipes EXACTLY, but with this one, for whatever reason, we used canned diced tomatoes the first time and have been using them ever since. I also add balsalmic vinegar. It is delicious and fresh-tasting!

This was a nice, fresh appetizer - followed the instructions exactly, but next time I think I may add a little balsamic vinegar.

Made the recipe exactly as listed with one exception...I blanched the tomatoes by putting a large pot of water on high heat, removing the water from the heat once it reached a rapid boil, adding tomatoes into the water for 1 minute, and then draining them. This made the tomatoes much easier to peel and I think it made the topping (without tomato skins) much tastier. Great and very easy recipe!!!

This is a great bruschetta and an excellent way to use summer tomatoes. I used fresh oregano in place of tarragon and it worked well. I also added about a tablespoon of olive oil. Baked it on top of salmon filets one night, served it as crostini topping with crumbled feta, and just made quesadillas (with a mix of cheddar and goat cheese) and served the bruschetta as a topping- delicious.

Remember, your dish is only as good as your fresh ingredients. I used fresh end of the summer tomatoes and followed recipe exactly. Except I might have used a bit to much garlic, so it was a very garlicky bruschetta. But overall, everyone loved it. It was so fresh and tasty that I didn't even need to rub any extra garlic on the toasts.

This is amazing bruschetta as-is, but it is even better with kalamata olives as has been suggested before. Have made it over and over and it always gets rave reviews.

This was a fast, easy recipe to make and ranked right up there with Bruschetta from Italy! Had as an appetizer before the Gnocchi with Gorgonzola Sauce.

This was delicious! I left out the tarragon and the pepper flakes(didn't have any)and it was fine. I also did not use the garlic to rub on the bread (too lazy) and we didn't miss it as there was plenty of garlic in the bruschetta. Next time I may use some balsamic vinegar instead of the lemon juice just for a different taste. Overall this was very simple and delicious!

Great. The 2 Tbsp of minced garlic was too much for me, I love garlic, but I would suggest trying a scant Tbsp to start. Maybe if I had let it sit overnight it would have mellowed.

Tasty! I omitted the tarragon and parsley and subbed in dried oregano (which is what I had on hand). Great basic bruschetta.

I "butter" the crostinis with cream cheese before adding the bruschetta. It is always a crowd pleaser

Delicious. Didn't bother rubbing the garlic as the recipe calls for, just added the minced garlic stated in the recipe. Not sure what the tarragon added to this; will probably try it without next time unless I have some on hand.

This is a GREAT recipe. I added some fennel seeds to give it an extra kick and some fresh rosemary. I also didn't rub the bread with garlic.... just roasted it and added it to the bruschetta.

This is definitely a crowd pleaser, and perfect for an easy appetizer. I've found it best to leave the bruschetta at least overnight for the flavors to meld. I agree that there is really no need to rub the bread with garlic, but I did add a bit of butter to each slice before I put it in the oven. Everyone (even those who didn't like tomatoes) went back for seconds...or thirds!

Delicious way to use up lots of summer tomatoes. I added some crumbled feta and it was excellent! Don't see the point of rubbing bread with garlic unless you roast it first...I just added the garlic to the tomatoes.

This is the yummiest bruscetta recipe out there. It tastes great, but I add some finely diced kalamata olives too. My spouse is an olive addict. I also up the amount of oil to 1 full tablespoon, for healthy fats.

This was very fast and easy to make. It went together in a breeze and was just the contrast needed to a kalamata topping and a main course of lemony shrimp linguini. :) Enjoy!
