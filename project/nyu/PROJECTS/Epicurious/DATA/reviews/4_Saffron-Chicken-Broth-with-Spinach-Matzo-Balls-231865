I love it! This is a fun and tasty recipe. Another chicken broth recipe that I will definitely add to my list which also includes those I find in chickenbrothrecipes.com.

I made these matzo balls with my own low fat broth. Used 1 cup finely minced chicken in place of the chicken wing meat; and substituted 1/4c. melted margarine for the chicken fat. It was an impressive soup and so very delicious...a meal in itself.

With the modifications made to this recipe, it was the best matzo ball soup I've ever had. I used vegetable stock instead and added lots of dill and some chili powder to the stock along with the saffron. I added cumin to the matzo balls. I added chopped carrots and cremini mushrooms to the soup to give it more depth. It has become a regular soup to make now.

The balls were good interesting twist on a classic, but the soup tasted like dishwater. I like a richer soups with depth. Next time I'll make my own soup with roasted parsnips and carrots and use these balls.

Oh my, I truly believe this is the best chicken-matzo ball soup I have ever made or eaten. I brought this to Passover, and it was a huge success. I will make this over and over again.

I made this soup in cooking school. We of course moify it slightly but made it still delicious. I would for surely make it again. The balls are a little tedious to make.

Unbelievably excellent! The broth was very fragrant and tasty, and the matzah balls were flavorful and divine. No longer will I make chicken soup with all the usual vegetables (turnips, parsnips, carrots, etc.). The onions with the bay leaves and saffron were enough, and to my taste, produced a better broth. I followed the recipe to a "T" except for sticking a whole chicken in as part of the 6 lbs of chicken wings required for the recipe. This is a superb recipe!

My husband said that the matzo balls were absolutely delicious. I tend to follow recipes, so many of your reviewers always change things. Next time though I will add a pinch or two of powdered ginger which I used to do with the packaged mixes. I made them a little smaller, yielding 24 in one batch and 20 in the next. I tried not to think of all that artery clogging fat!

I actually made this earlier this year for a Seder for my Gourmet Group. I made the stock with about 6 lbs of chicken necks and backs -- was a lot richer. The matzoh balls were the best my husband has ever had ... I am planning to make this again for a dinner party this weekend and realized I never wrote a review. My only mistake was reducing a bit too long, so everyone had about one inch of soup. Very, very beautiful and rich, but light on quantity. Loved it and it is now a mainstay.

I made this recipe for passover this year instead of the traditional soup my husband grew up with - you would have thought I was committing a criminal offense. It ended up being delicious. I had forgotten to rate the receipe and I'm making it again today in October. The idea of making matzo ball soup more than one time a year is foreign in my house, but this is soooo good that it will become a regular soup for us. I am surprised that everyone didn't say they'd make it again. I followed the recipe and it was GREAT!

This was a delicious recipe, a nice change from traditional chicken soup with matzoh balls. The soup was very flavorful and rich, and the matzoh balls were delicious--the addition of spinach and chicken was very good.

I tried this for my first passover seder and it was a big hit. As an added plus, it pretty easy to make.

This made a beautiful soup and the matzo balls were unusual and scrumptious, so much so that my beau, a chef, adapted them for a special at his restaurant. He said mine turned out better :-) A tip for him and others: the longer you can let the mixture sit, the lighter your matzo balls will be.

DELICIOUS! I made this for Passover. I didn't feel like cooking chicken on top of my meal, so I just used bullion for the broth. For the matzo balls I added 2.5 tbsp of oil instead of chicken fat. It turned out great! Very tasty! If youlike floaters, this is a great recipe. The balls were light, fluffy and flavorful!

This was a fantastic recipe--the matzoh balls were great. I was dubious at first about how different they were from the usual ones we make, but they tasted even better than they looked!

Loved the soup and the matzo balls. Made it as a trial run and we couldn't get enough of it. The matzo balls were a great change from the usual. Saffron adds great color and scent to the soup.

Great recipe! A nice change from the traditional soup! I have to admit that I did add 3 carrots to the broth (hard to break old habits!) but not necessary. The matzoh balls were out of this world and a meal in themselves!!! Was a real crowd pleaser for Shabbat!
