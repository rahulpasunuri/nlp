Great. Loved the onion in the dressing with the papaya. After reading the comments about the ginger, I just grated it and threw it in the mix without any straining. Worked well.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for but found it to be quite bland. Good concept, it is just that the proportions were off. Too much oil, too little ginger and lemon (acid), not at all sure if tarragon belonged. It might also benefit from being made the day before. You also need a perfectly ripe papaya for the sweetness which I did not have. The papaya seeds were nice though, a trick I'll try again.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well all the flavors blended. Even the papaya seeds are not weird at all. We have papaya all year so this will definitely be made many times

This was surprisingly good..and I didn't know the seeds were edible, but they added a wonderful pepperyness to the salad. We did this with baby spinach instead, and when we make it again we'd either double the ginger, or perhaps add ginger matchsticks..we weren't able to detect the ginger at all.

Sort of strange. The papaya seeds taste like watercress, and that's nice, but the salad failed to excite. It might be better if made where papayas grow; you just can't buy good ones outside the tropics.

I haven't made this yet but will. I was doing a specific search and this appears to be IT. We fell in love with this dressing during our many trips to Hawaii where you can buy dehydrated packages of it at ABC Drugs - great take home gift idea. Add jumbo shrimp (peeled and deveined) and slices or chunks of fresh papaya for the perfect main dish summer salad.

Haven't made this yet but I certainly will. I was doing a specific search and this appears to be IT. It compares to a dressing that we love from our many visits to Hawaii. Add jumbo shrimp (peeled and devined)and slices of fresh papaya for the perfect main dish summer salad.

I was also skeptical about using the papaya seeds in the dressing, but the results are delightful. We have already made this salad 3-4 times. It looks nice for guests and is both light and satisfying. I like using romaine lettuce. (I agree that dried tarragon works well. The time I used the fresh herb, though, it was definitely worth it!)

Easy, do-ahead recipe for a warm Spring/Summer's night! I was worried about using the papaya seeds in the dressing, and was pleasantly relieved that they add nice texture and a bit of peppery, earthy taste without being too spicy or overpowering. The papaya added beautiful color to the table, and everyone oohed and aahed over the taste! I am making it again for other guests! I DID reduce the amount of oil by 2/3 and the dressing was still yummy and decadent. Also, I didn't have fresh tarragon and used a few pinches of dry, and it was still great!
