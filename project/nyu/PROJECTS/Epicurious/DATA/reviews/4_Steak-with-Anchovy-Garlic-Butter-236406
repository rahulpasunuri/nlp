Outstanding recipe. The sauce is to die for. I swapped out the strip steak for an Angus rib-eye, used EVOO instead of butter and replaced the parsley with cilantro.

this was great. The butter was so simple to make, and it really compliments and elevates the meat.

This was freaking AMAZING. I am due to have a baby any day now and everytime I cook, I'm aware it could be the last meal I am able to put my heart and soul into...for that reason, I have been trying to make something special for dinner each night for the past week. The anchovy butter is by far the best thing I have made in awhile. The flavor is bright and strong and complex and indulgent...but the butter does not end up being too rich or heavy...it's just right. I used jarred anchovy fillets (approx 3) and a smidge of anchovy paste because my tube of it was almost empty. Melted the anchovy fillets over the stove and probably had a bit more than a tablespoon but I added a little more butter to balance out the saltiness. Used lots of parsley, lemon juice, and fresh pepper and did not have the patience to make a paste of the garlic so I just minced the heck out of it. I also added an extra clove . Added some steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes to the meal and thought I had died and gone to heaven...until hubby ran out and brought me back a reeses peanut butter cup blizzard from dairy queen!!!! Leftover butter was frozen and will be used again soon, I'm sure.

sailaja87, Go to IKEA and pick up a pestle and mortar. They're like $10 and, if you chop the garlic first, they make short work of turning it into a paste. Lots of other uses, too.

made this for the first time last night and it is unreal! Sooooo good. Pan seared the steaks then stuck them into a hot 450F oven. Topped with wonderful butter mixture and then threw some caramelized onions on top. Restaurant quality at home!

i've already made this several times!! my husband and i love this steak. to make it light a little, i use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. still yummy!!

I was really excited to try this recipe, but I admit I was disappointed. I think my biggest concern was that the garlic was hard to mash into a smooth paste, even after mincing. I use another steak butter recipe where you roast the garlic cloves, drizzled in olive oil, in aluminum foil, for 40 minutes- it is a richer flavor and smoother texture. I did like the anchovy paste to add depth. I think the fresh parsley, which I had to omit because I didn't have any, would have really brightened the flavor as well. Will have to try again, modified!

WONDERFUL & EASY My husband heard ANCHOVY and said NO! I made it anyway, everyone loved it. The anchovy only adds a salty flavor. They put it on their baked potatos too.

aesthetically speaking, this looks absolutely disgusting. The lemon and butter never fully combine and the anchovy paste turns the butter a peculiarly awful shade of brown. However, once it melts on the steak......sublime. totally worth its ugly duckling appearance and I will definitely be making it again.

I hesitatingly tried this just to do something different with grilled steak. [me kicking myself] I can't believe I waited this long. It's a fantastic and simple addition that takes your favorite cut of beef to a new (and delicious) level. DO NOT let the word "anchovy" stop you.

Excellent. We used flatiron steaks and doubled the butter. Not exactly healthy, but absolutely delicious.

Made just as written but forgot the parsley. Used flat-iron steaks. Absolutely delicious. All 3 of my children ate this, and the one that said "no anchovies on mine" got the yummy butter (with anchovies!) and virtually licked his plate.

Excellent! Substituted a can of anchovies in oil for the paste and mashed the whole thing together. Really tasty.

I don't like the flavor of anchovies, but have been convinced to try recipes where they add background depth, rather than acting as a key component. I nervously tried this and absolutely loved it. The flavor is truly amazing. Our steaks were spectacular.

Yum! I used this on filet mignon, but agree it would probably best be used to soften a flank or flat iron steak.

Amazingly delicious! Restaurant quality good! I've made at least 30 recipes from this site, and this is one of the very best.

This recipe is superb. The taste explodes in your mouth. Don't be put off by Achovy in the recipe. This is one of the easiest and most satisfying meals you can make.

The butter is like a taste-grenade exploding all over your steak.
