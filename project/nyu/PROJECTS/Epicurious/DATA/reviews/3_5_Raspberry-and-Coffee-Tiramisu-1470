The recipe makes it sound like you need to assemble and serve immediately. I tried making this an hour ahead of time and refridgerating it. It turned out fine, not soggy at all.

A bit of work...but if you have done tiramisu before you get the hang of it. Very different. Creamy and rich..I think the key to a good tiramisu is letting it age. If you like raspberries this is the one for u. Oh and u can use pound cake instead of ladyfingers. Sometimes those guys are hard to find.

Granted - I haven't tasted that many Tiramisu recipes to compare this one with, but it was one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had. I substituted a grain-based coffee substitute for the coffee granules and espresso (upping the amounts slightly) and raspberry concentrate mixed with simple syrup for the brandy. The flavor was excellent.

The raspberry flavor was good, but it isn't what I hoped for in terms of a tiramisu. More work than it was worth.
