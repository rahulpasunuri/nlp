Delicious. My chops were more like 1" cut so it took a lot longer (35 min) than estimated in recipe. Had to put lid on pan to keep moist and cook, and they were perfect! Like another reviewer, I didn't have any apple juice handy so I used white wine and cranberry juice. Served with doctor-ed-up sauerkraut and green beans. Yum!

Great recipe- fast & easy. I brined the chops for about an hour in the extra apple cider. I'd make a bit more sauce next time as well.

I have tried this dish twice. The first time I followed the recipe. The second time I used herbes de provance instead of the caraway seeds. The chops were so succulent. This recipe is a keeper.

This dish was easy to prepare, and the flavors gelled nicely. I don't understand why earlier reviewers ended up with tough pork -- ours was very tender.

Just goes to show the subjectivity of a recipe; there are just too many variables not to use your own head! Maybe my caraway seeds were old, but after cooking just one chop, while leaving all other portions as posted, I found the flavor pleasant and mild. (I brined the chop, as well, ala Cook's Illustrated...nice and tender.)

It was so strong as to be overpowering. I had to thicken the "sauce". If you make it, recommend that you go easy on the coating.

Great flavors but whatever happened to tender, juicy pork chops ? Next time, I'll slice a tenderloin. Applesauce and Brussels Sprouts are good side dishes with this.

This was fast, moist, & delicious. I made it twice in 2 weeks. I made it ahead of time. I put the chops & the sauce in a square, glass pan & sealed tightly in a "just warm" oven. They came out incredibly moist.

I made this dish tonight for my husband who eats in fine restaurants all over the world (scary huh?) He liked it very much and said he'd like me to make it again. I did not have apple juice so I substituted cranberry juice. Yum, yum.

Found this dish to be ok but uninspiring. My borfriend wasn't thrilled with it either. Sauce was rather boring.

Very tasty - but I thought the caraway flavor was a bit too overwhelming. Next time, I'd cut back the caraway to 2 teaspoons.

Cooking this is like a good woman - quick, easy and delicious! I would use a little more butter. A cast iron pan adds flavor.

The other reviewers are right. This is really delicious. I'll make this one for friends.

I really liked this dish. It was so easy and fast to make and yet so good I would have been ecstatic if I had ordered it at a pricy restaurant. I will make it again I'm sure.

Good pork chops recipe, tasted like I put more effort into it than I did! Alas, my family prefers Shake'n'Bake.... (but what do they know?) I can easily make these just for myself next time!

Wonderful recipe.. our favorite pork chops. Tastes great with applesauce on the side. We have made this recipe several times and it never disappoints.

This was very easy and truly delicious. The caraway crust with the deglazed sauce made the dish a notch above the ordinary. I served with applesauce, steamed new potatoes and asparagus. Good spring dish. I will make this again!
