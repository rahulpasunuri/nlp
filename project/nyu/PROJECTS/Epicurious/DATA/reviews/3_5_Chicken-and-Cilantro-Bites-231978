I thought these were great. I couldn't find ground chicken at my grocer, so i got ground turkey instead. I also added just shy of a quarter cup chopped serrano peppers to the mix, seeds still in.

great base recipe--I used natural pork as opposed to chix agree about fresh ginger and will add rehydrated shitakes to meat with less egg and some fresh bread crumbs Do NOT understand why anyone would need that much soy dipping--2T low sod soy and 3T vinegar--plus 1T sugar/sweetener Really needs red pepper flake/oil and seame oil Love to use 1/2 apricot jam/swt chili sauce as optional dip Only needed 2T oil to saute--could bake them w/out cornstarch but it adds crunchy surface when sauteed I usually make dumplings from scratch so this is a simple way to egt favors w/out as much effort

These were delicious! I made them last year and I don't remember having any problem making them. I do spend quite a bit of time cooking so I don't know if the experienced cook would have less of a problem or the fact that I have more patience to cook than any thing else. Anyway, they are worth the time.

you know, i liked them and i ate them but i wouldn't say they were delicious. my guess loved them, with and without the dip. i liked with dip, although to add flavour, i actually chopped some cilantro into the dip and added chilli flakes. i needed more flavour. i made two helpings, so i had some left-over, which i threw into a stir fry with noodles and vegggies. that was yum.

In the recipe it looked like too much liquid to hold together so I added a little semolina. The semolina helps in holding it all together and it became real easy to form the patties. I also baked the patties instead of frying, and it came out really well!

These were hard to mold into balls, but I had ground my own chicken, so that maybe an issue. The flavor was subtle. I'd probably add more cilantro next time.

this is exactly what the previous reviews said, tastes like a chinese dumpling! definitely very easy. however, i did change a little. i used pam cooking spray instead of oil to save on fat. i found the cornstarch to be quite messy and unneccessary. i also added fresh ginger, as well as a little bit of the soy sauce, and used fresh breadcrumbs, which i add to all my meatball recipes. they came out incredible! will definitely keep this great recipe on hand.

Excellent! This dish tastes like the inside of a delicious Chinese dumpling. As suggested, I added one tablesoon of fresh ginger to the recipe. I made the bites one day before and they turned out great!

I made these for my son's 2nd birthday party, and they got rave reviews (even my son liked them, and he usually spits out his chicken). I fried them up right before the party, then took them to the park, and they were fine, even at room temperature. I'll definitely make these again, and keep them in my repertoire of party foods. My mother-in-law even said they were delicious, and I think that's saying something! The one thing I recommend, is that you get rid of the excess cornstarch, as best you can, on each patty; then clean out the pan and put fresh oil in it when it gets too brown & cloudy. I can't vouch for the dipping sauce, because I didn't make it. Maybe next time.

Made these 2 yrs. ago for a bridal shower at work. Raked in the compliments. My family loved them, too. Great flavors, not hard to make.

These were so easy to make but end up seeming much more fancy. I made these along with some other asian appetizers and my friends were all begging for the recipe. They really are very tasty and they freeze well too. I make them all the time now when I know we're having company because everyone seems to love them!

I have made this several times and have adapted them to burger size and grilled them on the BBQ. I rolled them in fine breadcrumbs to stop the sticking. Very good and low calorie dish.

Works great for an hors d'oeuvre. Very easy to make. Used ground turkey instead of chicken. Added the fresh ginger like many suggested.

I made this and for some reason, it just doesn't have much taste. I might try it again, but will have to put something spicy in to give it a taste

Feh! Boring! They looked and seemed appealing but not enough flavor. Gooey mess not worth the time.

I liked this recipe, however, as one cook suggested baking these, I would not recommend as they took longer than expected and they really need the crunchiness that frying them provides. Careful if adding chili flakes as they can be too spicy and overpower the chicken.

My husband loved these! I was pretty skeptical at first, but they turned out unexpectedly good. They were a little messy and hard to handle, but definately worth it!

I liked this one! I'd never have thought to use corn starch. The sauce was good, the 2nd time I made it I added a little fresh ginger and red pepper flakes! This one's a keeper!!

These were delicious made with ground turkey (could not find ground chicken), but extremely hard to deal with in their raw state since they were so soft and gooey. Next time I will add ginger to the mix. They were the first thing to go at our party the other night!

Like others, I added 1 Tbsp minced ginger...dispensed completely with cornstarch and frying and baked at 375 for about 9 minutes. Use a melon baller that you dip into water to help form uniform size bites. I serve with Rikki's Gourmet Soy Ginger dressing...it's a pretty color and flavor. We just catered our daughter's wedding with all asian hor d'ouvres and these were easy and popular. You can freeze after cooking and reheat for about 5 minutes at 350...

a big hit with my family! goes great with the sauce, but i would suggest maybe adding some garlic or a little red pepper. also, be sure not to overcook the chicken - it dries out quickly!

Like another reviewer, I made burgers from this recipe. I used ground turkey but skipped the egg. I added fresh ginger as others had suggested as well as some Korean hot chili paste. I really liked it but my husband (who does like cilantro) did not like having that much cilantro in every bite. I will make the burgers again but with chopped cilantro served on the side.

Great appetizer. Ginger is a must, and I added thai serrano chillies - very good!

I made with 1/2 ground chicken, 1/2 ground pork and 1 T grated ginger and served with Spicy Cilantro Sauce. Yum! They were a huge hit, first to disappear.

As I'm not a big fan of fried balls of things, I used this as a filling for gyozas, which I then poached. I also added about 1 tsp of minced ginger. These were soooo good, my one-year old scarfed them down as fast as I could get them onto his plate! My husband, who is less adventurous than our son, liked them, too!

I actually converted this recipe into cilantro burgers on the grill. They turned out great! And the rice vinegar and soy sauce was a tasty dipping sauce for the sandwich.

I made this for a buffet table; after they were fried I just put them in a small crock pot, and they were fine. Guests raved! They're easy, and quick, and flavorful. The sesame oil isn't too overpowerful, as it can sometimes be.

This recipe was very tasty. I added some red pepper flakes for zing!

The mixture was really, really wet when I made it. The end result was very bland. I bet with lots of ginger, and made with pork, they'd be good - but in that case, skip the corn starch and treat them like meatballs.

Made this for a dinner party, and it was gobbled up. Go easy on the sesame oil if you are not a fan of that flavor. I made these the night before and reheated, they were nice.

A very good and easy dish. I prepared the balls earlier in the day. It worked, but next time, I would not place them in the cornstarch until right before I was ready to cook. It seemed to get more pasty than it should, but no one else noticed.

Rating: 4
I thought these were excellent. I didn't have quite enough cilantro on hand so I used maybe one tablespoon instead of two. Also, to save calories & fat, I used the filling in gyoza wrappers and steamed. My husband loved them too. I didn't make the sauce so I can't review it, but it seems like the one given in the recipe would be easy to improve upon if it's not that great.

Sorry to say I found this ground chicken dish rather unappealing, as did the rest of my family. Bland. Perhaps I'm not a ground chicken person. In dumplings with ginger and more spices, I can maybe see it.

Rating: 2
Very ok for me...I think the problem is that I ate it as a meal. After about 3 bites it was a little too much. It did however give me some ideas. It tastes similar to pot sticker filling...so wrapping it in thin pasta dough...boil then fry might be very good.

I made the balls bigger for our entree, and flattened them somewhat. Even after adding minced gingerroot and red pepper flakes, it wasn't terribly exciting. It was quite salty and the rather mundane dipping sauce made it more so. If I make this again I will do so as appetizers.

These were really good. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Big hit with guests. Next time will maybe some ginger and a little crushed red pepper. Excellent!

Huge hit at my mini-dinner party. I made them with a bit more cilantro than called for, and added some red pepper and let the mixture stand overnight to make it more flavorful. There was not one single bite left over and everyone asked for the recipe!

Added another 1/2 c cilantro and also 1 t minced ginger to give even more flavor. Great!

I had originally copied this one down for my toddler. He initially stated he didn't like it, but when he saw his infant sister eating it, he tried it again...and again and stated he wanted more. Would definitely make again.

I made these and added them to a spicy red lentil coconut soup recipe I found on foodandwine.com. Let me say they were delicious on their own and absolutely fantastic in the soup. We finished dinner an hour ago and my husband is still raving!

There is a great recipe similar to this in the cookbook FOREVER SUMMER by Nigella Lawson. A simple first course, she uses ground beef, cooked basically the same way, but it's chopped in the skillet and served in lettuce cups with lots of lime and chopped chilis. Easier than making little balls. You could use chicken, turkey or beef. Try it!

I made this for a Mother's Day get together with family and they were gone instantly. Very easy to make. I would do this again, maybe adding some more flavor to liven up but they are good just as they are.

These are ok, but not anything spectacular, especially without any sauce. The folks I made this for liked it more than I did, and I served the bites with the 'Spicy Cilantro Sauce' from this site, which went over a lot better than the recommended soy & rice vinegar dip.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it looks delicious! Just wanted to reply to the question about ground chicken - you can buy it in the grocery store just like you buy ground beef. You can also buy ground turkey!

This is a marvelous dish. A small food processor works well to finely chop the cilantro and scallion. A little sesame oil goes a long way, so I'd use only 1-1/2 teaspoons of the oil. Clean the skillet between batches.

You can grind chicken in a food processor: cut it into 1 1/2 inch chunks and pulse until ground. Works great!

How do you ground the chicken?

Living in Hong Kong I have been exposed to lots of Asian foods. I have a Chinese friend who makes a similar dish, but uses a combination of ground pork and chicken and instead of the egg uses about 1C of soft tofu, that has been drained. I combined the two recipes last night. The bites are very nice and my kids don't even know they are eating tofu!

Made this with lean ground pork instead of chicken, since I had pork left over from making meatballs, but no other changes...GREAT.

Made these with ground beef instead of the chicken, taste great. Love the cilantro, sesame combo. Will be making again, next time with chicken.
