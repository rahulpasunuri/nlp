I was very worried about this when I was looking at the final product. It looks like lumpy slop in a pot. As predicted my 4 yr old wouldn't touch it but my husband, somewhat surprisingly, LOVED it. I think the bacon is what seals the deal-- do not skip it! I also can't imagine this served over polenta... I made white rice and that worked well with the sauciness of the chicken. One note on ingredients- I didn't have tomatoes and so used half a can of Muir Glen organic diced tomatoes w/ green chili and that gave it a nice kick (although turned the sauce pink... again, the bacon helps right all wrongs). I probably won't make this again unless my husband insists on it.

This was extremely rich and I feel the chicken would have been better over a bland pasta, rather than over cheese-laden polenta. Didn't care too much for the texture either, but I am not much for mushy things.

We loved this! Rather than fresh corn, I simply thawed 2 cups of frozen corn ahead of time and just heated it through with the meat and tomatoes. In addition I made my polenta "from scratch" rather than using "instant polenta". It just takes a bit longer. We will definitely make this again.

We don't generally cook with heavy cream, so I subbed in an extra tablespoon of flour, a bit of extra butter and all skim milk for the roux. Also used leftover fresh mozzarella instead of fontina. Absolute comfort food and much lower fat content -- one of my husband's favorite meals!

We had this last night just before going to a Christmas concert. I used applewood bacon and frozen corn. I also used half & half. A pinch of cayenne just kicked up to where it should be. I served it over smoked gouda grit cakes. Next time I will serve it over a hot slice of fresh baked cornbread.

Nice thick hearty sauce. Wasn't into the polenta thing tonight so it was just simply served over bowtie pasta. Chopped up about 8 basil leaves- it was just delish. I really would make it again!

Very good. we used left over grilled chicken, and our polenta on hand was the semi-prepared in tube (in our wholefood section). we sauted the sliced polenta in some bacon drippings, and put cheese on it to melt and then topped with the chicken/sauce. I think both of these saved some steps and we look forward o making again.

Eh - it was ok. A lot of work and it was a big sloppy mess. Don't skimp on anything - I used slightly less cheese because I thought it was too much, but it really probably could have used all the cheese. Definitely whisk the polenta in slowly to the boiling water, then remove and then mix cheese in....keeping it on the burner even at a moderate temp was too much. A little bland, the bacon was a great addition, but it just was too much of the same consistency..... Next time I may use rolled polenta and slice it into a dish, pour mixture on top and then top with extra cheese and heat to melt.....It may separate the textures and make the flavors separate a bit.

Wow! Loved this!! Had half a roast chicken, fresh corn & tomatoes & found this recipe. What a find. For two, halved the recipe, more or less. Also added some fresh Mexican squash because we have it in our garden in abundance. Used half & half & milk in lieu of heavy cream. Lots of fresh basil. I think fresh corn, tomatoes & basil make a difference in this dish. For the polenta, threw in a handful of Mexican style 4 cheese, which I had, & some parmesan - significantly lighter on the cheese than the recipe called for, but enough to be able to taste it.

Great comfort food recipe. I did substitute 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream. And frozen corn works just fine in the middle of Winter! This is a real winner!

I loved this, but I think it's possible to condense some steps in the recipe. We call it "the bowl of deliciousness" in our house. Great way to use up corn and tomatoes from the garden.

Comfort food at it's best!!!

Very good. Easy, flavourful, comforting and warming. Will make again. The tomatoes tasted a little bit too acidic and raw, so I may let it simmer a bit longer next time. Otherwise, there was no need to modify the recipe at all.

I bit heavy to make often, but good. I also thought it took longer than 35 minutes.

I changed a bit the recipe: I add potatos and cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes. I serevd it on a slice of garlic bread. Amazing!!! Try to match a chocolat dessert with it.... hum....

Very simple. You may substitute half-and-half for both the milk and the cream, simplifying your shopping list should you not have either on hand to begin with. The comfort-food-ish aspects of the cream and chicken are nicely offset by the strong, fresh flavor of the tomatoes and fresh basil: don't skimp on either. Received the boyfriend seal of approval.

WOW! Chicken a la King to the nth degree - whole family was fascinated and delighted. Served on chilled, olive oil fried Polenta and Bacon with Fontina (on this site - excellent), therefore left all bacon out of the creamed chicken. Shredded chicken breasts grilled with olive oil. Even with frozen corn, this took a long time - worth it. Use LOTS of fresh basil and parsley!

This is one of my family's favorites. I agree with the reviewer(s) who says cheese in the polenta is unnecessary - I simply make the polenta with chicken stock and some fresh herbs. Otherwise, the recipe's perfect as is.

I thought this was really yummy. I made it with half-and-half and used premade polenta that you can buy at Trader Joe's. I liked that it was different from the usual fare.

This was tasty and I enjoyed it, but there is a lot of effort involved. It's great comfort food. Not fancy enough for company and too involved for me to make time and time again. I'll keep looking for simpler comfort food recipes.

I've made this dish a few times so thought I'd add my two cents. I make polenta a lot and have never used instant. I'm too attached to the comforting process of stirring plus an inexplicable aversion to things instant! To reduce the fat content, forget all the cheese in the polenta--totally unnecessary; the dish is rich enough without it, though last night I tossed in about a half cup of grated cheddar, only because I had it onhand. Make sure the sauce simmers amply so the tomato breaks down and integrates, and don't be shy with the salt and pepper. For the added spice, I generously sprinkled my boneless skinless chicken breast with Hungarian paprika before frying in the bacon drippings and would probably work added to the creamed corn to kick it up a notch. This is wonderful with applewood bacon; I have always forgotten the basil...but I imagine thinly sliced scallion greens would be a fine garnish too. Yes, this does take longer than 35 minutes when you're working from scratch (and using regular polenta). Definitely great comfort food for a cold rainy night, which is why I keep it on my list!

The recipe states that it can be made in 35 minutes. I guess that would be true if you started with pre-cooked chicken. This is definitely winter comfort food. My kids did not like this at all, but my husband and I enjoyed it. I think if I ever made it again, I would add spice to the chicken and corn mixture.

This was a heavy comfort food. Delicious and different for a change. Not a make it all the time kind of recipe (little too heavy) but definitely make again. Just have to wait a while. Actually froze some of the leftovers in individual servings, worked out well. Just as tasty after defrosting!

I thought this recipe was fantastic. Minimal prep work and wonderful taste. I prepared the polenta and then cooled it before broiling in the oven - so had more of a polenta loaf vs. the polenta "mush". This worked out great. To make it even quicker, the bacon could be omitted but the basil is a must. A new take on comfort food!

I made this as prescribed (used left over turkey) and feel as though i must have missed something based on the other reviews. While the flavors were fine, this is a rich, rich, heavy meal to the point of implosion. I guess i should have known that but somehow, i thought that the end result would've been different. Nobody at the table finshed their meal...

I made this exactly as the recipe instructed. It was great. I had a lot of polenta left over, so next time I will make 3/4 of a batch - that would be my only change. Oh-and it's easy, too!

We thought this was great as is! Will definitely make again

Delicious! I also substituted milk for the cream (didn't miss it at all) and left fontina cheese out of polenta (didn't have it on hand). Husband LOVED it, my 3 little girls were wary of the basil, so may leave that out next time. Definitely a make-again recipe.

This is a relatively quick and very hearty one-dish meal. I made no substitutions, but I did leave out the fontina, and no one missed it. This is a good fall/winter weeknight dinner--it seems special without taking a long time.

This is a delicious dish! It is different and wonderful. The corn, tomatoes and basil are a fresh contrast to the cream and polenta. A hearty dish that my family and friends loved. Even my picky 8-year old daughter liked it! Way gourmet... Will make this again, for sure.

My husband loved this. The second time I made it, we topped mashed potatoes instead of polenta making a quick meal. We've also tossed the left overs in scrambled eggs... It was great!

I thought this was GREAT! I used milk instead of cream, and I left out the bacon (actually I forgot it) but didn't miss it. This dish is quick to make, and it's something more interesting than usual weeknight faire.

I was really impressed. As written, it's a heart attack on a plate, so I used the precooked packaged slicable polenta, substituted canned corn for the fresh, evaporated milk for the cream, canned tomatoes for the fresh, and used reserved bacon fat to cook the chicken breasts and packaged precooked chopped bacon (25% less fat) instead of fresh. This made it much faster to prepare. I made it to freeze in individual portions for quick meals. With all these substitutions, and even frozen and reheated, it was STILL incredibly delicious. It freezes very well, but it was gone too soon.

I make this dish at least once a month. It is also great for entertaining as the recipe can be easily doubled. The other nice thing about this dish is that it goes great with Chardonnay.

Delicious! It reminds me of my childhood creamed chicken, and even more. I substituted the whole portion of cream with chicken stock and use 2% milk for cooking the corn, and then add about 1T cream at the end to cut back on the fat-didn't miss a thing. I also didn't use the whole bacon fat to brown the chicken. I serve it over steamed rice, do add the chop basil, it adds so much flavor to the dish.

Absolutely wonderful... the flavors & textures make for an incredible experience. Even my four year old loved it, and he's a very fussy eater. I plan on making use of some thanksgiving left-overs the next time I make it.

Absolutely delicious. I substituted half-n-half for the cream and it was still wonderful. Great for a cold evening. Tasted even better (what little was left) the next day.

I used pancetta instead of bacon (only because I already had it at home) and left it in the sauce. It came out great! Real easy, no-brainer for a cold night with some crusty bread.

This is a nice home-y kind of dish - particularly good if you're fond of heart-attack-on-a-plate type fare. To that end, I subbed 1/2 2% milk and 1/2 whipping cream instead of the amount of cream called for, used way less fontina and just a tiny bit of the parmesan. Worked great. Also, used only a tbl or so of basil - basil and bacon???
