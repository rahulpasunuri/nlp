Excellent recipe. Great for a heavier lunch or light dinner. As suggested by another reviewer, I roasted the potatoes and agree that is MUCH better/more flavorful (425 degrees/salt, pepper, olive oil for 30-40 min or so, tossing halfway through for even browning). Didn't use the capers as we don't like them but that doesn't drastically change the major components of the dish. This is an impressive main salad and would definitely make it again.

Fantastic! I used salmon instead of the tuna

This was a great salad. Wouldn't change anything about the recipe. There is a lot of prep work, but much of it can be done in advance.

One of our favorite dinner recipes! I left out the capers and radishes (not a big fan of them). Substituted what I had available, ie, red wine vinegar, for the champagne vinegar. Added one more egg and more asparagus to the mix. I do alot of this prep beforehand and put it in the fridge until about 1/2 hr before dinner then let it sit at room temp.

Fantastic without the tuna. Otherwise the tuna overpowers the vinaigrette. I may try another brand of tuna given other reviews but my experience was not a positive one.

Had to make many changes as I'm a poor college student and cannot always make trips to the grocery store, but I and all my roommates absolutely LOVED this salad. Changes: didn't have any radish so we left it out, and used tuna in water, drained to cut down on the oil. Also didn't have shallot or chive, so used red onion, less and chopped fine, and parsley. Also used yukon golds as we didn't have reds...might have roasted them instead of boiling them, but maybe that's because we cooked them a little too long. Regardless, this was a one-dish dinner; very interesting and positively delicious.

I love this salad! I made it without the tuna and eggs, and it made a great side dish for easter dinner. Everyone raved over the vinaigrette. I'll be making this again and again.

A standby dinner entree. Amazing flavors and perfect for a California spring night. The asparagus & radish really shine during this time. Think Zinfandel for a pairing.

Absolutely delicious! Especially liked the do ahead prep. The vinagrette is wonderful. Company fare! I had a problem with the capers. I rinsed and patted dry and fried as receipe directed and the capers did not open like flowers. I tried a second batch without rinsing and just patted dry. They didn't open either. Suggestions anyone?

Fantastic! The chive dressing is a real keeper for any salad. I also loved the fried capers. This is an ideal one meal dish for a summer evening.

Really lovely - was an ideal potluck dish. A little time consuming to make, but definitely worth the effort and the presentation is impressive.

this was very good. i cooked tempeh and added instead of the tuna since i don't eat meat, and it was great! very substantial. there are several different parts to prep, but none takes a lot of effort, just plan ahead!

This was really delicious, but I found the preparation tedious with all of the separate boiling of eggs, asparagus, and potatoes. I may try to steam the asparagus over the boiling potatoes next time.

This takes a bit of prep time, however it results in a great light meal that is suitiable for guests. Everyone loved it. The fried capers were the hit of the evening. A keeper for summer entertaining. It would also make a great buffet dish.
