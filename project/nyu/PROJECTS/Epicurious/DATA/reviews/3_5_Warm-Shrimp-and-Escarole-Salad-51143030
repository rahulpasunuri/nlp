This was really tasty. Made as written except substituted 2 tablespoons of anchovy paste for the anchovies. Really savory - it reminded me of Bagna Cauda. My husband loved the sauteed radishes - he even commented "radishes are so good cooked! Are they expensive? We should eat them every day!"

I made this for dinner tonight. It's good. Not exciting, just good, which is why I gave it three rather than four forks. I think I personally would have liked the addition of a few hot pepper flakes at the garlic/caper stage. Following other reviewers' advice, I added the escarole when the shrimp were half-cooked and that worked perfectly. Otherwise, followed this recipe exactly. To those afraid of cooked radishes - they're delicious. Try them!

Read the reviews on this prior to making it. The recipe is pretty easy and straightforward. I cooked the shrimp first, then removed them from the pan, adding them at the end for just a few seconds to rewarm them. I love radishes, however, the addition of radishes in this dish (particularly cooked) did little to enhance the overall flavor or presentation. I would leave them out if I made the dish again. I would also increase the amount of escarole. Although escarole is a bit heartier than other greens and may not cook down as dramatically, a couple of cups more wouldn't hurt. My wife and I also like garlic, and I would increase the amount of garlic as well and probably throw in a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also added some drained, marinated artichoke hearts with the stem.

Timing is definately important on this one. My recommendation is to toss the shrimp in last, as mine were definately done too quickly. That way there is no messing around with removing them while the escarole wilts. We added some sliced fennel bulb which gave it a bit more flavor, and served it over linguine that was tossed in olive oil and fresh garlic. Really delicious!

Great recipe especially for late Feb time frame. Excellant flavor layers and pretty too. My shrimp where only half cooked when I added the first of the greens and the radishes. My husband who usually is not a big fan of lighter salad dishes was pleasantly surprised and really liked this dish. We served it with a side of pasta tossed with garlic oil, fresh parsley and parm.

This was a basic recipe and was fine, but it didn't blow me away, and the radishes cooked I did not particularly like.

This was okay, but not great. Gets points for being light, easy/quick to make, and fairly healthy. But I was disappointed in the flavor. Somehow, despite all the flavorful ingredients it was a bit bland. Plus, I thought the cooking times were a bit too long. Should have followed my gut, not the directions... If you cook the shrimp all the way through and then cook it even longer with the greens, it gets way overcooked. I might make again, but I'll remove the shrimp from the pan prior to wilting the greens, and play around with the seasoning.

This looks like a wonderful recipe. I am not a big fan of radishes. Do the radishes stand out in the dish or do they compliment all the other flavours? Any suggestions for a substitution?

Easy to make and wonderful favors. Very diet friendly...

Made and followed the recipe. Very good. I removed the shrimp before cooking the escarole because sometimes the escarole will take longer than a few minutes depending as to how old it is. The cheese 3 TBS is far from overwhelming and offsets the dish perfectly

I've not made this yet but regarding the "overwhelming cheese," try farmer's cheese. I hope to make it sometime soon.

We made this for guests and thought it was a nice, lighter, seasonal dish. Escarole does hold its volume and is tasty sauteed; love the addition of radishes in the saute for color and texture. The garlic, anchovy fillets and capers made a nice Italian flavoring. Highly recommend!

The cheese overwhelmed some of the other flavors. We probably won't make this again and if we do, we will probably make some changes.
