It would be tasteless if you used a lousy olive oil. (the world is full of wanna-be gourmets)Try a sweet Spanish Arbequina oil, stay away from the grassy Italian oils. Infused oils may be good also. Never refer to olive oil as "grease".

Okay, the recipe as is is absolutely terrible! But, it can be fantastic with a few changes. We rolled rosemary and basil into the pancakes and cooked them in less grease than it called for. Without these two spices the pancakes are basically just tasteless bread lumps with lots of fat. Garlic salt worked great in these, too. And roll out the dough as thin as possible before frying the cakes. Good Luck!

This looks complicated, but sounds delicious. I look forward to making it, but would like any input as to how left overs are stored. Any suggestions?

I am so relieved to hear the good comments. I had printed this out as soon as I saw it. It looked different & good. When I checked back, I saw the negative comments & began to wonder.

I made this for a pot luck lunch in my office and everyone loved it. I'll make this again using infused olive oils and other types of cheeses. At first I was sad to see there are still people able to form a negative opinion without knowing what they're talking about-- but they're part of the balance too, I suppose.

This is a great recipe and have made it twice. My relatives who migrated from Europe many, many years ago would prepare this dish for us when we were young. The taste and flavors brought back so many memories of years long past. It may be a bit of work in the preparation but that is how good food was prepared then. To me, it is well worth the effort. Plan the time for the preparation and enjoy.

I cannot believe the ridiculous comments from some of the readers. This is a cooking site for people that enjoy and respect the art of cooking. I can understand that many people would like shortcuts, but obviously those that have unneccessarily given this receipe a bad rating without even trying it are misusing how this site is set up. You should try the receipe before you rate it

The rolling/coiling process described here is very similar to that used to make the flaky indian flat bread called paratha, but instead of olive oil, you use ghee. as everyone has observed, it's very time consuming, but worth every minute!

I was thrilled to find this recipe! A Great-aunt of mine who had come to America from Samos, Greece used to make these for us and unfortunately, we never got the recipe. I did modify the recipe to make larger pancakes (as she did) and they were EXACTLY as I remember hers tasting! The technique for rolling the pancakes is authentic and is necessary to make them crisp and flaky. In the interest of making them a bit lower in fat, I did not use oil to form the coils - I used a little flour, as necessary. Olive oil is mandatory for this recipe - provides a delicate taste. I've e-mailed this recipe to all my relatives who remember this treat. Thanks!
