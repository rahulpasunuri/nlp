You should really consider using a different meat. In addition to the fact that veal is more expensive and less flavourful of other cuts of beef it is extreamily unethical. The torture that these animals go through (deliberate atrophy of muscles, induced anemia and confinement is discussing) It truly is the culinary equivalent to ivory: You should really consider using a different meat.

I had a piece of veal shoulder blade left and was wondering what to do with it. Certainly no expensive veal chop, but pounded thin, pan-fried (!), it was ready in minutes and a big hit with my husband, and a perfect meal for me (diabetic).

My husband and I enjoyed this very simple dinner tonight. It was absolutely delicious. I was very concerned about the breading on a grill,but it was just wonderful. The salad was great with the chops. I did not use the veal chops because they were ultra expensive, so I went with a thick bone-in pork chop which is a great substitute for the veal. Will definitely make this again. Great meal to make for friends because everything can be prepared before company arrives.

Really fast and really tasty. I pounded the veal to about 1/4 inch and cooked it for 4 minutes per side, which was a shade too long for medium rare. My wife thought the chops were too bready, but I thought that added a nice flavor (though could have used a little more Parmesan in the mix).

This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it using the fresh breadcrumbs as well as panko breadcrumbs and both work very well. This is good with pork but the veal is so much better.

Made this last night for my family and it was amazing. I used pork chops instead and it was simple and delicious. Also made the pasta with garlic and olives and the grilled asparagus wrapped in pancetta that was shown in the June 2008 Gourmet. Great combination.

So simple...so delicious. Left out basil. My butcher, Salvatore at A&S in Fairfield, cut the chops 2"thick, 1 lb each and pounded them into a work of art. Use less bread crumbs but do use the suggested am't of cheese (they grind it there for you). Placed cutlets on top of salad like they do in Tuscany, so the greens wilt. Served w/ Toscana Rosso red wine. AS a first course, the primi pasta, served the egg noodle pasta dish w/wild mushrooms another reader suggested. Served w/ a white Trebbiano. Bon appetito!!

I substituted the veal for lamb chops and it turned out great.

We loved this! Next time will try with pork chops, but the veal was pretty nice. Always looking for recipes that call for arugula this time of year!

Made this last night. We substituted boneless pork loin chops (pounded to 1/8th inch, note this cost us $11 to serve 6), and served with the suggested salad. We loved the pork, and found that it was even better with a squeeze of fresh lemon (like schnitzel). We'll definitely make it again.

My husband and I love this recipe although we have made it multiple times with pork. I also substitue sherry vinegar for lemon joice.We really think it is a terrific meal-easy and delicious!

The veal chops were absolutely fantastic (maybe because they were so expensive???). This is an easy dish, with the sear marks from grilling, looks very elegant, and flavor to die for. Remember to coat that grill with oil before starting, you don't want your crust to get left on the grill!!! Definitely a keeper for special "expensive" eating.

Interesting. Remember to run the bread crumbs through the Cuisinart to make them fine. I made this for dinner last night. Had the butcher(John Dewars, Wellesley) do the cut/pound work. They were good but not great. Could have been that I paid $160.00 for six people's meat. Served it with an egg and spinach pasta with fresh wild mushrooms and prosciuto. Was easy to prepare .Salad was ok as the dressing is very simple. No leftovers.
