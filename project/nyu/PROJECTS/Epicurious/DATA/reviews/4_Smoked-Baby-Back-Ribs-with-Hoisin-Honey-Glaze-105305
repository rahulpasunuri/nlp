I have not made this recipe but the Weber prep in IDENTICAL to my ribs. I use heavy duty alum foil to make the drippings catcher below (cheaper if you do often). Don't forget to strip the "fell" or membrane off the bottom of the rack of ribs. It allows the dry rub or marinade to soak into the meat better. I go for THREE hours and the meat falls off the bone every time. Personally, I am a dry rub fan but may try this recipe as it DOES look interesting.

Really enjoyed this preparation. When I tasted the sauce, I was very skeptical and bummed -- too spicy, too sappy. But once cooked onto the ribs, it was phenomenal, a rave for kids ages 6-11 too. Altered the prep slightly: Braised ribs covered with 1/3 c water at 300 for 90 minutes, let cool, then slathered with sauce and grilled for another 12-15 mins total. Served with Jasmine rice and steamed bok choy.

A serious BBQ person would not serve these ribs. They were the least favorite I have ever made and I have won contests.

Fantastic recipe - fingerlickin' good. After grilling outside, I did cook for 30 more minutes in my home oven while I made the other sides - steamed rice and snow peas w/water chestnuts make a great accompanyment - I got rave reviews!

This is a great recipe for ribs with nice sweetness to the flavor. I think it could use a little more spice from hot sauce, but then again, I have that bias on everything ;-) The Hot Sauce Collector http://hotsauce.zlio.com

I cooked this in a crockpot. I left out the five-spice powder and Sherry, and used garlic powder; my potluck group loved it. The pickiest eater asked for leftovers!

These ribs were succulent. Juicy and great flavor. We are going to keep this recipe for future grill events.

This is a wonderful recipe, I even made it without a smoker and in winter in a conventional oven. Tried it with Sweet Thai Chilli Sauce and some regular ketchup instead of Oyster Sauce (no Oyster Sauce at home) and it worked out really well too. Definitly a keeper

These ribs were very easy to make and tasty. I followed the recipe as called for except I had to sub star anise instead of 5 spice powder. I did not know the translation to dutch, in order to find the spice at the grocery store. Due to the dutch rainy weather, I baked these ribs on a rack, at 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. I basted them with reserve marinade every 20minutes. My husband loves ribs and not a morsel was left on the plate. He gave this recipe a 4 fork salute!

What an amazing rib recipe! So flavorful and not too hard to assemble. I don't have a grill so I cooked them slowly in the oven, basting often and they turned out wonderfully.

WE made these for dinner and thought that they GREAT!In stead of leeting them smoke-cook, we put them on a gas barbeque and letting them cook for 2 hours on low heat. These are some thing i will make again because of the flavors

This was the first time I made ribs and it turned out great. I used the exact ingredients but didn't have time to marinate overnight so I basted the ribs, covered them in foil and put them in the oven at 250 for 3 hours. I finished the basting on a gas grill and everyone raved about them. They turned out tender & flavorful. A real winner!

These ribs were DELICIOUS!! Have made them several times with exact ingredients using a gas BBQ. Always turn out moist and flavorful.

This was a great recipe, I've made it several times, but I have a different version for those who may not have access to the exact ingredients or preparation methods that they have listed. I used Japanese rice wine (mirin) instead of Sherry. I'm sure normal Chinese wine or even normal white wine would have also worked too, it is not critical to use the terribly expensive stuff. I didn't have black bean garlic sauce so I put in about three tablespoons of fermented black beans that I got from the local Chinese supermarket. I don't think you can really overdose on these, they give the ribs a good flavor, so feel free to experiment with adding more. I didn't have five-spice powder, but I had whole star anise from the local Chinese supermarket. I crumbled 3 or 4 (i.e. separated each into its 5 leaves) and used those. I didn't have an outdoor grill. I set my oven to 300 and baked the ribs for about 60 to 90 minutes in a roasting pan, following the recipe instructions to re-baste every ten minutes. The last time I made this, I didn't have time to marinate the ribs overnight and in fact just pressed the ribs into the marinade and then threw them into the oven. No problem, they still turned out well.

I made this recipe in my Weber kettle BBQ, and it was absolutely delicious. I did need to use all 15 of the second batch of coals, and even then, I never really got the temperature much above 250F. I did give the ribs an extra 15 minutes of cooking time due to the low temp., and they came out perfect! Next time I make this recipe, I will start out with 40 coals instead of 30 in order to bring the temp. up a bit. I'll also "lighten up a bit" on the five spice powder. I thought it slightly overpowered the marinade. I will definitely use THIS recipe whenever we are in the mood for ribs!

Delicious. I did make a couple of changes due to the fact that I live in an apartment and don't have a charcoal grill :(. I made the ribs in my oven with the broiler at 300f. I also added liquid smoke to the marinade. Yeah, it's not the real thing but it turned out well just the same. I tested this recipe out on a friend who gave it her thumbs up as well. I'm looking forward to making this recipe on a real coal BBQ.

I have made this twice for company and everyone raves about it. I also used on a pork tenderloin and it is also delicious!
