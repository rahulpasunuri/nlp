A *wonderful* recipe. A picky family of three all gave thumbs up when they didn't care for beets with only butter. Thanks!

Served these for Thanksgiving and they disappeared right away. Next time I will at least double it. We doubled the thyme and added about half a cup of crumbled goat cheese to the hot beets, which really made the dish.

I didn't include the herb but it was still great

I purchased some fresh beets still covered in dirt from the farm stand. Used this simple recipe to make a lovely side dish for tonight's dinner. I think I might increase the amount of thyme in the future. Am looking forward to trying the leftovers in the AM.

I make this dish every Thanksgiving and it's great. The beets are good hot or cold. I can't tell the difference in the flavor if they are roasted or boiled -- they seem the same to me.

I served this both warm and cold ... I liked it better warm, mostly because I added goat cheese and the warm beets melted the cheese. I also switched molasses for the honey and roasted the beets. Sprinkled with toasted walnuts, this was a huge hit with my friends.

This is an excellent dish. Thanks, NY, I had not thought of serving it as a cold salad. I am making it tonight so I will serve it at room temperature and if that works, I shall try it cold next time.

This terrific, simple recipe yielded a great cold beet salad with an incredible combination of flavors, including the fresh thyme, which was the perfect herb. How will we ever eat beets prepared any other way?

Absolutely delicious beet recipe! I used half golden beets and half red beets from the local farmers market; the slightly less sweet golden beets were especially tasty in this glaze. yum!

Not quite the same but- I do something like this only with beets, brown sugar, pecans and balsamic all wrapped up in tin foil. This can be done ahead and finished in a pan, served as is or what ever. Makes kinda a fancy camp meal. bob

Great recipe for Christmas dinner or any time! I baked the beets a day ahead, and premixed everything while the turkey was cooking- all I had to do was quickly heat it up and reduce the liquid to a thick glaze. a real time saver, and delicious.

This was a great dish. I too, roasted the beets instead of boiling. (Trim and scrub beets, wrap in aluminum foil packets, roast at 400 degrees for 1 hr - 1 hr,15 minutes until soft, cool and peel). I got rave reviews from my beet-loving friends. I served the leftovers cold with crumbled goat cheese. I think they were even better this way.

We love this. I also bake the beets rather than boil - they seem sweeter that way. I have made this for years and it's always a hit.

A great beet recipe - the kids loved it! Make sure you wear gloves when you peel the beets or your hands will be dyed pink.

I have made this dish on countless occasions and everyone loves it. I do however roast the beets rather than boiling them and also use yellow orange and red beets mixed when they are available - this gives the dish wonderful color and adds to the presentation

Love Beets, definitely need fresh for this recipe...it needed ...something..not sure what. I'll make it again and play with it.

I was convinced that I hated beets until I tried this recipe. Now I know it's because my mother always used canned! When my husband told me how much he loves beets I decided to make this recipe for him one night and we were both very impressed. These beets are easy and delicious (not to mention very healthy)!

This recipe is flawless. I like to cook it ahead of time until it reduces to a nice glaze and spread it on sliced beets and top with dabs of goat cheese. I usually serve this at room temperature. You can make the beets a day ahead as well.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and always come back to it. Definately.... fresh beets vs. canned; no comparison.

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition year after year.

This is the most requested beet dish in our house. It's actually very simple. Cook and peel the beets a day or two ahead of time. When the rest of the meal is cooking, it only takes 10 minutes to finish the beets. I made 4 pounds for 6 people and had NO leftovers. I agree, fresh beets are the only way to go.

Gorgeous to look at, earthy and intensely flavored. This recipe transforms a common root vegetable into a surprisingly elegant burst of color and flavor to a Thanksgiving meal. While others have suggested a short-cut with canned beets, I found this well worth the added effort. The size of the wedges and slightly firm texture cannot be duplicated with water-logged canned beets.

This has become a Thanksgiving staple in our house. It's a wonderful combination of earthy sweetness and the complexity of balsamic. Highly recommended.

Make this a day ahead. They taste much better the next day after the flavor soaks in. I loved it!!

I disagree that canned beets would give you the same taste or texture. They are easy enough to cook in the microwave and as long as you leave some of the root attached, it isn't messy. This is a great recipe.

If you did a blind test taste, you would be challenged to tell the difference between plain, canned beets and home prepared ones. Instead of going through the effort to cook them yourself, which is minimal, but with maximum mess potential - the beet juice gets everywhere - heat the canned ones with some balsamic and honey and you're there! Plus, the beets seem to absorb a lot of flavor so use an abundance of seasonings.

this recipe combines the intense flavor of beets with the floral bouguet of balsamic vinegar to create a savory taste that seems to satisfy the soul as well as palate. one will find themselves wishing for this delicate mixture to swoon their tastebuds yet again.
