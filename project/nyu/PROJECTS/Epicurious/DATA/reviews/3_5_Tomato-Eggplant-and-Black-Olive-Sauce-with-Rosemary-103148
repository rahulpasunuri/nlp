first made this in 2000 and just made it again. I did a quick run thru the food processor with the tomatoes which I think brings it together better. (chunky still, but tiny)

I would recommend omitting the rosemary, it was a little too floral for me, and add fresh oregano and basil instead. But overall the recipe is great.

I did not use olives, but I used red pepper instead. Instead of pasta, I served it with creamy polenta and freshly grated parmesan, and it was excellent.

This recipe was wonderful. We also doubled the rosemary and tomato paste as suggested. The smaller eggplant pieces worked well. This dish was even better served cold the next day, on crusty bread, dipped in a bit more extra virgin olive oil. I am a diabetic, and this dish seemed low on carbs as well.

Very good and easy. Next time I might replace half of the eggplant by zucchini or a red bell pepper. It is a good base for a pasta sauce recipe.

This recipe was delicious, the only tricky part is not to overcook the eggplant. I added extra juice from the canned olives (about 1/2 cup), more rosemary (nearly double), and doubled the amount of tomato paste in order to thicken given the extra olive juice. My guests thoroughly enjoyed this, and it was easy to make, giving you more time to visit with your guests and less time in the kitchen!!!

The more the rosemary, the better. This is the best pasta sauce Ihave ever made, hands down.

Pay heed to the reviewers suggesting more garlic and cutting the eggplant into smaller dice, they are right. One-third of the recipe actually serves 3-4. The sauce was quite tasty, but I wouldn't buy the ingredients specifically for the sauce, and would suggest making it only if all of the ingredients are conveniently on hand (including fresh rosemary). Much the same effect could be achieved by adding some eggplant to sauce in a jar and jazzing it up a bit.

this had all of our favorite ingredients in it and should have been a winner...but overall was rather bland and boring...perhaps as mentioned by another the eggplant weren't as good as they could have been... we did add goat cheese at the end and this helped improve it greatly.

If you like olives this is a must try recipe. Make sure to include some of the juice from the olives and don't be shy with the rosemary. If you are looking to impress a friend, family or new acquiantance this is a great choice but make sure they enjoy the flavor of olives.

Hate to rain on the parade but we really couldn't get excited about this. It was wholesome & healthy but rather dull. We made 1/3 of the recipe & it was plenty for 1 lb of pasta. Perhaps we should have added more garlic or rosemary. Perhaps the eggplant we used didn't have much flavour (it certainly looked good). Whatever the reason, I don't think we'll be trying this one again. Too many better pasta sauces out there.

Great recipe, the only thing I would change would be the size of the eggplant cubes to about 1/2" to 3/4" at the largest.

Some family members, who don't normally like eggplant, really enjoyed this. I served it a variety of ways and enjoyed them all. Easy to make, nice to be able to freeze, and above all very good.

Wish I could give it three and a half forks. This is delicious. I made a third of the recipe (one eggplant, one can of tomatoes etc, and it was plenty for one pound of pasta. Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious. Sauce is thick and flavorful. I added a little more rosemary. This could also be used with a Boboli or layered between lasagne noodles with ricotta cheese.

This sauce freezes really well. For variety, I added crumbled feta cheese which was delicious.

This was a hit in our home! I added a bit more garlic and made it a day ahead so the flavors really had time to blend together. I also took leftovers and spread them on slices of crusty bread.

This is a really nice sauce over any kind of pasta. Very easy to make. The only change that was made to the recipe was the addition of some extra garlic.

This was terrific. Cut eggplant small. The house smelled wonderful with the fresh rosemary.
