I made this as directed but substituted small white onions from my garden for the shallots. They were hardly browned in the amount of time suggested. I also served it over jasmine rice and with stir-fried broccoli stems with soy sauce, instead of the bok choy. I cut the tofu into eight pieces as directed, and cooked it for 10 minutes, turning more than once so that all the sides were crisp, but the inside of the tofu was not cooked. If I made it again (which I don't think I will) I would either cut the tofu in small cubes or maybe cut it into very thin "steaks". I also didn't really like the sauce, but I don't know if I overcooked the sugar because it started to melt a lot sooner than I expected, so that may have affected it. Too much sauce, as others have mentioned. As for the suggestion to reuse it, I will, but I don't like it...

This was delicious! It was a good bit of work for a weeknight meal, but well worth it. I put rice on each plate, then sauteed bok choy, then the tofu on top, then topped it all with the sauce, chopped mint and fried shallots. My best tofu dish ever, and the sauce was so good. I do agree with the other reviewer who said the fried shallots could easily be skipped, as it has tons of flavor without them.

This was really disappointing. After reading the reviews, I checked the caramel sauce before adding cornstarch. It looked too thin, so I added the cornstarch. Used more tofu as others said there was a lot of sauce. Fried the dried tofu to brown and crisp - and tough. The herbs sat on top, added flavor when you got a taste, but weren't integrated. I might try it again with a soft tofu, not trying to crisp it, and put the herbs in the sauce, or just make a different recipe.

After having a caramel tofu dish in a Vietnamese restaurant, I found this recipe. It was very close to the restaurant version and very good. I think I used too much ginger and will cut it back next time. Other than that the only thing I would change is the fried shallots. I'm not sure they added to this dish and might substitute mushrooms instead. But the sauce was fantastic. I'll tweak it a bit to my liking, but this one is a keeper.

this was really good and pretty easy to make. My husband who doesn't really like tofu thought it was really gooooood. i served it with watercress instead of boy choy

A great recipe. Interesting that some of the comments were - "to much sauce". Be creative and use a wonderful sauce like this on other foods - I used it over chicken breasts a few nights later - again great!!

Delicious exactly as written. Would also be great with tilapia (I would dust with flour and pan-sear in a little oil). The mint really makes it, could omit the basil in a pinch.

I don't get what all the shallots are for? I just served them to the side of the tofu, but it doesn't say. I thought the sauce had a little too much vinegar. Also, its really important to have all the ingredients for the sauce prepped and measured ahead of time because it cooks VERY quickly.

I was disappointed with this sauce -- it tastes just okay and the texture was too thick and sticky. If I ever make it again, which I doubt, I would leave out the cornstarch. If you do plan to make this dish, please take note of what previous reviewers commented about the portions. There was at least double the amount of sauce needed for one tofu loaf, which probably makes 2-3 portions. The sauce would work for other steamed or stir-fried veggies though.

I hate making huge messes, especially oily ones, so the combination of frying tofu and making a caramel sauce sounded like a kitchen nightmare. However, I had bok choy, tofu, mint, ginger, and shallots in my kitchen just waiting to be used, so I gave this recipe a try -- and it was worth it! Make sure you drain the tofu really well and get the tofu and shallots extra crispy; it really adds a lot to the texture of the meal. I made this without either cornstarch or basil. Just a note -- although the mint sounds odd, it went fabulously with the caramel sauce. I dropped a few extra leaves into water and green tea to go with the meal, and it went over exceptionally well.

Excellent Sauce! It is difficult to find outstanding meatless recipes, and this exceeds expectations. I think broccoli or some sort of green is a necessary addition to balance the tofu.

This is a great way to enjoy tofu. I only gave it three stars because of the time it took to prepare the sauce, and because it created a lot of dirty dishes to clean. I substituted the white parts of green onions for the shallots, and skipped the fresh herbs. I think the bok choy goes well with the tofu and sauce.

I found this unpleasantly sweet and certainly not worth the effort to make.

Delicious and quick. Followed the recipe as is although the next time I wouldn't bother frying the onions for the topping. As hubby said it after his first bite...the magic is in the sauce!!!

One of my few sucessful tofu dinners. Sauce would work for a lot of other asian style vegetables. I served it with the garlic bok choy (using vegetable broth instead of chicken) and sauted asparagus (1/2 veg oil and 1/2 toasted sesame oil). A great vegan dinner!

It's true, this did make a little too much sauce. It was a lot of fun to make, though! I loved melting the sugar and throwing the chopped shallots into it. It went together very well--even thickening with cornstarch went very smoothly. The dish was tasty and I would certainly make it again. I made stir-fried regular bok choy with garlic instead of steamed baby bok choy, but I think any green would be good. (It will be even better in the summer when I have herbs in the garden to use.)

Agree w/prior reviewer -- could easily double amt of tofu for same amt of sauce. In fact, the amt of tofu called for is not enough for 4 servings; maybe 3. Add some steamed brocolli to the dish, as it goes better than the bok choy. Did not think the herbs (basil and mint) added anything and in fact, thought they rather took away from the otherwise enjoyable flavors. sauce does v well made ahead.

I thought that there was way two much caramel sauce for the amount of tofu and vegetables, elsewise, a good dish.
