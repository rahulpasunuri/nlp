Excellent!I made it last minute and used a whole BBQ duck from our local Asian supermarket and water instead of broth. Did everything else by the recipe.So much flavor! Fussy family raved!

Excellent, but I made it with chicken thighs instead of duck.

I had duck broth and meat already on hand, so I adjusted this recipe by adding ginger to the scallions and fish sauce to the broth. I thought it was good (two forks), but my husband thought it was great (three forks). The duck flavor was lost with all those other flavors, but that might be because I didn't do the broth according to the recipe. This makes a lot of soup.
