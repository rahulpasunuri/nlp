Excellent, and even those not usually fans of vegetables like it. I tend not to like leftover vegetables, but this is still great the next day. I don't bother tasting the pine nuts, and either dark or light raisins work well. I've made it both with and without the anchovy paste (depends if anyone is watching me!) but I haven't noticed the difference.

Unusual. Any type of raison seems to work. Anchovy paste adds depth without a "fishy" taste. You can use canned, drained tomatoes when they are out of season. In a hurry? Toasting the pine nuts is not necessary.

I love this dish! I make it every few months for a change of pace. The ingredient list is so unusual, but the flavors come together to make a delicious "twist" on ratatouille. Serve it over rice for a tasty meatless (except for the anchovy paste) meal.

The three people who shared this dish with me also enjoyed it greatly.

I added some chopped, fresh basil and mint from my garden and red pepper flakes at the end. Very nice!

This was served as a side dish to lasagne at our dinner club. I'm not a big fan of zucchini, but I really enjoyed this recipe! The sweet/sour flavor is very good!

I prefer to add garlic after the zucchini. The garlic will burn, even on low heat, if it is added first (unless you use previously roasted garlic which is good. If the garlic burns the dish will be bitter. Otherwise a good dish.
