No offense to Johanna, but if you don't like bulghur it's probably not a good idea to make any kind of tabbouleh in the first place! :) I love the addition of corn, it adds a nice texture. I've made this a lot and often skip the tomato presentation, sometimes adding chopped tomatoes to the salad itself. Good stuff!

I don't think I would make this recipe again just because I don't care that much for bulgar.
