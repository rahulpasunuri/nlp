While not a knock out, it is a good recipe. Much of the flavor will depend on the glaze you use. I used an orange marmalade and added habanero salsa to it. Worked great. The corn relish is mild flavored but good.

Giving this recipe one star is even too much. The ingredients all sounded so good especilly since we love spicy, flavorful food. We had to choke this one down. Yuck.

I have to say that the corn, zucchini and toamto "compote" is the best thing I have ever had from a recipe here. The first timi I made it 4 years ago I had no cream cheese and I have never made it with the cream cheese. Yummy

I really liked this recipe. I used apple jelly insetad of pepper so it wasn't too spicy for my two-year old. The only corn I had was creamed corn, so I left out the cream cheese.

I would make it again, w/ modifications. First, the chicken was green. May be OK for Dr. Seuss, but green?!? The grocery store had a choice of mild green jelly or hot red jelly--maybe next time I will choose red. The dish was OK and looked pretty on the plates, but it could use more spice. I would make it again with more garlic, heat--also veggies would hold up to steak.

This was a great dish! I'm not a huge grilled chicken fan but it was pretty good with the pepper jelly. The vegetables were outstanding - similar to a cajun maque choux. I thought the tomatoes added a great flavor and unlike the other reviewers I really liked the ciliantro. I did add a little extra garlic, plenty of salt and pepper and I think I only added about half of the zucchini (2 small) but it was a good amount. The cream cheese was a good addition but it would still be good without it.

The cilantro was way too overpowering. I would eliminate it entirely and add some fresh basil and oregano instead. The pepper jelly made the chiken moist and flavorful.

This was a nice, sort of average, dish. It came together very quickly. I used mango chutney instead of pepper jelly and the chicken was moist and tasty. The veggie mixture (I added some diced bell peppers, yellow & red) needed more pizazz, though--more garlic, some ground coriander, black pepper, chilli powder, and lemon juice. The cream cheese was a nice touch. I served this with a bed of lemon-parsleyed rice topped with the veggies, then the chicken, then another tiny spoonful of veggies. It looked great and tasted fine.

The jelly made this very tasty. Even my daughter liked it and my husband and I loved it. The corn and zucchini was very good too, though the cilantro (I think coriander sprigs are another way of saying cilantro) could be perceived as too strong. The cream cheese was a surprise addition but made it nice although not as clean looking. I would definitely make this again. My husband said I should make it for company.
