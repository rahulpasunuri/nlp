This was one of the worst recipes I have ever tried on Epicurious. As others stated, I only got 2 plus one smaller cookie cup from the recipe, and, they were were greasy. Very disappointing.

I won't try these again. I made 2 recipes to get 10 cookies. They were very gresy and a little tough. They really weren't worth the trouble.

Double recipe. Used sliced almonds like other reviewer, makes a cooler effect. Using a tablespoon and this recipe doubled, I got 8 "cups". Baked them all on a Slipat. Edges cooked faster than middle, but at 7 minutes they were done.

Doesn't look like anyone has made this in awhile! I would definitely double the recipe and use a large tablespoon size for each cup. Otherwise they do not cook out to a 5" circle. Unless it is a 5" circle, there is no drama in the presentation. I watched it at about the 6 minute mark.

As others have said, this recipe does not make 10 - I managed about 8 using smaller than tablespoon amounts. That being said, and with the proviso that you have to be prepared to make two batches because of the potential of burning the odd couple, these are delicious, and look lovely, they're cheap to make, keep well, and work wonderfully with lots of different desserts. Bravo!

Delicous cookie cups, but you have to be very careful with the timing of both the baking and the handling/shaping afterwards. I had it down to the second in my preparation. A few seconds too late, and the cup is too hard to shape properly. Too early and it almost falls apart as you try to shape it.

Don't know WHAT I did wrong ... got TWO stuck almond messes per recipe. Ended up doubling the sugars which made it workable, but still only got two per recipe! The result was delicious but don't know if I would go to the trouble. Disappointing, because they make a wonderful presentation with chocolate mousse in them on raspberry coulis. :/

These are quite easy to make, but the recipe does not make as many as it states. I only got about 6 from it. I also used sliced almonds in lieu of the chopped...make for a much nicer presentation. I also made more than 2 at a time, if they start to firm up before you can mold them, just pop them back into a warm oven for a few minutes to resoften.

I thought these were very good and not overly difficult-although parchment or silpats are a must!I made mine quite small and draped them over the bottom of a mini muffin pan.I think the oven temp a bit high though,if the edges get overly brown they taste bitter.

The cookies came out quite greasy-although tasty. The recipe did not make as many as it stated. I doubled the recipe, measured out exactly 1 tablespoon onto the cookie sheets and still only came out with 11 1/2. they do keep well,however and make a very nice presentation with ice cream.
