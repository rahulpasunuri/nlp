Easy and delicious. I did what others recommended and added fennel and pine nuts.

Arugula is also known as "rocket". This recipe is delicious. I omitted the cherry tomatoes and added some Boston buttery lettuce, 1/2 cup slivered almonds, and nice thin shaved parmesan cheese on top to decorate. Refreshing and delicious salad.f

Simple, elegant and delicious. Rather than add parmesan to the vinaigrette, I put large shavings on top of the salad.

This is good...I ended up using finely grated cheese and in the future I'll use shredded.

Really good, simple salad. I've also discovered that this dressing is delicious on a nice white fish.

Love this. I skipped the lemon zest, added thinly sliced fennel and a bunch of pine nuts.

Delicious! We love lemon and arugula, what a great simple salad. Have made again and again, it's so easy.

I make this with lime. It is VERY limey. If you or your guests find it overwhelming, you can omit the zest. Me, I love lime. :) I also add about 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts, which complements everything.

Can't wait to have this again tonight.

Delicious, as my Hubby and I love a good dressing on Arugula and not to heavy on the leaves.I use minced shallots in mine and let it sit at room temp to marry the flavors for that slight hint of onion flavor.Adding grated parm to the dressing and topping w/ shaved parm and toasted pine nuts. Yummy!

I made this as a pizza topping and it was awesome! Arugula came in our CSA box this week and I needed a recipe to try it out - this was perfect. As others have suggested, the dressing would be great over asparagus, snow peas, etc.

Made yummy dinner based on this recipe. Cooked pasta with asparagus pieces, then tossed together with the arugula (which we call rocket in the UK) and dressing. Mmm-mmm. Really tasty!

Great simple salad. The dressing is refreshing and excellent on any salad. I used it on a spinach- arugula combo with cherry and yellow tomatoes.

I think my proportions were a little off because I was trying to only make one side salad's worth of dressing instead of 3.5 cups. But the flavors are great together and the parmesean definitely makes the flavor of the dressing. Sea salt and fresh ground pepper really rounded it out. I will definitely make again, but hopefully serving more people to have better flavor proportions. I also served over mixed greens/herbs (which did include arugula), just because that's what I keep in the fridge - but I don't think that impacted it much!

I made this tonight and everyone loved it. Only used arugula, no tomatoes, and it was still yummy.

This is a really good dressing and goes well with the arugula. I've used it several times, sometimes I add homemade croutons and grilled chicken and it is delicious.

a perfect dressing. I paired it with a braised pork, and the lemon cut the richness very well.

Absolutely delightful and refreshing. I could eat this salad every night of the week. The dressing recipe makes a pretty substantial amount for such a nominal amount of arugula and tomatoes, so I only used half. Think I'll save the other half of the dressing to try on a romaine salad which I think will be equally as good.

I agree w/ all the other reviews - this was indeed excellent and very simple, however, I found it needed more olive oil than the recipe called for. I also added crunchy persian cucumbers and it was delicious. A MUST try for sure!

I hate to be redundant but this is really excellent and so simple. I added some greek olives and cubed fajita for an afternoon delight!

Even having to stretch what little cheese that I had with the parmesan in the can, this recipe is delicious. The perfect dressing for arugula!

YUM! We tossed it on our pizzas and the lemony dressing really enhanced the flavors. It's also great by itself. A definate repeat!

This was as good as it sounds and as good as all of the reviews! Easy to throw togther and sure to please. I can't wait to try it on pizza. Next time, I might top the salad with toasted pinenuts for a twist. This dressing would go beautifully with many other vegetables as well. Enjoy!

It doesn't get much easier than this salad. It was a hit with my husband and mother-in-law. You can even forego the tomatoes -- the arugula and dressing alone are a delicious combination.

Love this! I could have it every day! I agree with the other poster, I prefer shaved parmesean as opposed to the grated. I just like the texture better. Fresh goat cheese is amazing on this salad too!

Love this salad--it's so fast! I used a meyer lemon and added 1/2 a clove of garlic, and used grape tomatoes, so I didn't have to halve them. It took about 10 minutes to make this. Definitely will be using again.

Fabulous! My asparagus is just peeping up. Can hardly wait to taste this dressing on steamed asparagus.

Wow! What a change from everyday salad! I did make one change though...I used baby spinach instead of the arugula. My husband and I are the only two people here and we ate the whole thing!

This was the first meal I've ever made using Epicurious and it was a great one! I literally had to lick the plate clean. I will definitely make this again.

LOVE this salad! I will be growing arugula in our garden this spring. The flavor is so fresh and is a great foil for rich dishes. Yum! Served it with manicotti for my husband's birthday (the manicotti was his request) and it was wonderful.

So far, everyone has loved this salad. I prefer to add shaved Parmesan to the greens, rather than adding grated Parmesan to the dressing. I haven't tried this as a pizza topping yet, but I'm sure it's delicious. It's also the perfect foil for something rich like a quiche. Great balance of bitter, sweet, pungent, citrus.

yummy! Reminds me of Italy! Very similar to something I had in Senigallia (Le Marche) for a New Year's Eve Dinner at a friend's home. It's a seaside town and every course that evening had seafood. The arugula was lightly dressed in olive oil, maybe a little lemon and on top were perfectly steamed shrimp and freshly shaved parmesan...wonderful combination of flavors!
