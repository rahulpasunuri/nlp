Thanks for all your comments. Based on them, I added fresh lemon juice and 2 cloves of garlic and used anchovy paste. Drained a small jar of diced pimento over the rinsed beans and did not rinse again. Used 2 freshly roasted red peppers, chipolte tobasco and smoked paprika. It greatly improved after chilling 48 hours ... great with bread, crackers and crudite.

This dip has potential but needs perhaps a fresh clove of garlic and some tabasco. As it stands it is is rather bland. I shall try again adding these ingredients and update.

Didn't like the color; flavor is bland; nothing special at all. Canned ingredients lack fresh flavor.

I made this dish with one can of white beans and about 4-5 fresh roasted red and yellow peppers. I didn't have any anchovies (boo-hoo) so I couldn't add them. Despite the lack of anchovies, I thought this spread was fabulous. I used it on sandwiches (in place of mayo), on crackers and veggies as an hor d'ouevre. The flavor definitely improves over several days so make it ahead of time!

The combination of flavors is great, but the proportions are odd and it really needed some acidity. I used a can of beans, a bottle of jarred peppers, doubled the anchovy and added a teaspoon of red wine vinegar and a few dashes of Tabasco. It was an instant hit! Very easy, and it comes out a beautiful color.
