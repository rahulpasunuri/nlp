The cheesecake filing is delicious! The orange flavor is very subtle and it was silky smooth. You might want to tent the cake with foil when you turn it down to 200. I opened the oven 1/2 way through the 200 setting and the cheesecake got very brown on top. Didn't taste bad, wasn't burnt just too brown. If you want to cut back on the sweetness I would recommend using graham crackers that are low on sugar or not use all the added 6TB of sugar. I found that between the filling, sauce, and crust I would have liked one of the components to offer relief from the sugar. I'll make this again but might make the sauce more tart or cut back on the crust sugar, or even both.

Very good. Need to bake the cheesecake longer or at higher temp, it was a little soft in the middle. The leftover sauce ban be used over French toast.

I made this recipe before and decided to try a few variations. I used fresh squeezed blood orange juice rather than orange blossom water, and I used 1/2 cup orange blossom honey rather than sugar. (it was too sweet the first time) I also added blood orange zest and a pinch of lemon zest. It didn't have the taste previously, but it was more light and I preferred it. It also had a pink tint from the juice, which made it prettier. I did follow the longer cooking time this time, and reduced the temp at 9 minutes so it wasn't too dark. Came out perfectly. There was also too much filling last time, and I was even using a 10 in springform. I suggest 4 blocks of cream cheese and 3 eggs.

I have not made this recipe yet, but I wanted to offer some advice for those who are coming out with runny cheesecake, from Mary Crownover's excellent book "I Love Cheesecake." Bake the cheesecake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees, turn the oven down to 200 and leave the cheesecake in for 2 full hours. Then, turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in for another 2+ hours. I use this method with every cheesecake I make, and I've never had one turn out runny in the center.

Really great. Big hit at the fire station. My only complaint is that the top browns way to fast and then keeps getting darker. Mine did not look any thing like the photo. I was really wanting a lovely pale top. I will make again and lower the temp sooner. I agree with others that the topping is way to much for one cheese cake. Topping can be halved or even quartered. I'm making another one right now so we can "use up the topping" any excuse for cheesecake.

This cheesecake was definitely the best I've ever had. The tart sauce complemented the sweetness of the cheesecake perfectly. We used the leftover sauce on apple crisp one night and vanilla ice cream another. I decreased the sugar in the cheesecake to 1 1/3 cup. Per previous reviews, I increased the cooking time at 200 to 1 1/2 hours, and it was still a little runny. The sauce took longer to reduce, but it was worth every minute.

Definitely one of the prettiest cheesecakes I've ever made. As per previous experience, I placed the cheesecake in a water bath. The cake cooked evenly and did not fall. The sauce is amazing! And while the orange blossom water is a nice touch, orange extract works fine if it's unavailable.

The best cheesecake I have made in my life. My only regret: I didn't let it cool quite long enough, so parts of the inside werea bit too runny, but my thanksgiving table LOVED in (I made a it last year). My aunt called me desperately last spring, wondering where she could find orange blossom water...

The very best cheesecake I ever had. I used whole cloves in the crust and it was pungent. Great for a holiday dessert.

A keeper. Thanks to all the reviews, I followed your advice and cooked it longer and the prescribed 1 hour 12 minutes. Great citrus flavour and yummy pomegranate sauce.

Made this on Xmas Eve and everyone loved it. Normally I follow a new recipe to the letter but I didn't have time to chase around for 2 tsp of orange-flower water, frankly, so I reduced maybe a half cup of freshly-squeezed orange juice to 2 tsp and added a bit more zest. Don't skip the sauce; it's color and tart flavor balance the cheesecake nicely. I did take the advice of others and used less sugar in the cheescake as well as cook longer than recipe says-maybe 20 minutes longer. I think 30 minutes longer would have been ideal. I also left some of the walnuts in small pieces in the crust for more texture.

This was my first time making cheesecake and it came out perfect. The crust is soooooo good. I could not find Orange Water Extract, so I substituted with freshly squeezed orange juice (about 2 tbsp). I also had to use sweetened rasberries, but it was still very good and tart. I definately recommend making the sauce 1 to 2 days ahead of time as the recipe suggests. The flavor is better the next day and it was a little labor intense trying to make the entire dessert in one morning. Also, the sauce goes a long way. I still have plenty left over and will freeze it and make another cake for Christmas dessert in two weeks.

I made this cheesecake twice already. I agree that the specified cook time doesn't work, it comes out way too runny. However, the flavors definitely work. I increased the cook time by 15-20 minutes and it turned out perfect. Also, I recommend decreasing the sugar by half because I found the sweetness too overpowering. I will be making this again for the holidays. Very delicious and different than your typical cheesecake flavors out there.

The cook time did not work well in my oven, so it turned out too soft. but it tasted great!

I made only one change to this recipe; used 1 pkg of frozen raspberries instead of 2. Made it 1 day in advance to let flavors develop. It was delicious!
