These are the BEST peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, hands down. I have made them several times, and everyone gobbles them up, and requests them often. Mmm....

I made these cookies about 2 months ago for a friend of mine .... My friend loved them, and as Thanksgiving is coming up this week, I decided that I would make them and a few other treats for the holiday, as I am a guest at my friend's home. The preparation process is quite easy, and I, too loved these cookies, so I'll gladly make them again, not only for my friend, but for myself as well. They'd be great with an ice cream filling as well, so I'll make these again for the rest of the holiday season, and with a vanilla ice-cream filling, I know that they'll be a HUGE hit !!!

I've been making this recipe for years...we LOVE it! It's my go-to cookie recipe. I have never ground the oats, I need things pretty basic, but love them. Make these today!!!

I agree with sprinkling salt over the cookies. I do this just as they come out of the oven and use Kosher salt. It enhances the flavor. Even people that don't like oatmeal love these cookies.

These turned out great. Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I made them vegan by substituting non-hydrogenated margarine for the butter and 4 tbls corn starch for the two eggs, plus a little bit of water.

A quick and easy cookie recipe. I used the full 1 1/2 cups oats whole instead of grounding 1 c. They turned out great. There is a nice balance between the peanut butter, chocolate, and the oats. I will definitely make these again for my family.

This recipe is awesome. I've made it about 20 times and tried some variations but the recipe as written is the best way. Only thing is I don't crush the oats. We have a big family so I usually double the recipe. Chilling the dough is critical. If you leave out the peanut butter the cookies will still taste good but the consistency won't be good and the cookies will appear kind of sickly. Follow the recipe as written and they're as good as Ms. Fields I think. Thanks Jose!

These cookies are delicious! I have made them several times as written, but last time just added the oats without grinding any first. I feel it is unnecessary to grind the oats. I love them just as much with the oats just added in whole.

Very good recipe. Formed dough into 2 logs, froze one for an hour, sliced and baked for 15 minutes. Got raves from family and friends. Kept other log in freezer for a quick fix. A Keeper

Not so much! Bland, too much chocolate,not enough flavor. Maybe one fork.

I like these, but they won't permanently replace my America's Test Kitchen chocolate chip cookies. They did turn out well using bittersweet chocolate for the grated; yes, definitely grate the chocolate in the food processor, and add a bit of the oatmeal and flour so that the chocolate does not start to stick to itself as the friction of the blade heats it up. I left all the proportions as written. 15 minutes at 325 yielded a great texture, once the cookies cooled. They look pale and underdone, but set up just right. Perfect for dunking in cold milk. I'm going to try the suggestion of a sprinkle of sea salt on the last batch. Hubby thought they were a little bland, despite all the chocolate. Maybe a bit of cinnamon or chili next time? Hmmm. The peanut flavor is not pronounced, but I always think peanut butter cookies taste better the next day; the proof will be in tomorrow's lunch. Final note: I got 85 cookies out of this batter, using big rounded tablespoons. Generously sized, when baked.

I just made these cookies... They are unbelievably good! I made only a few changes to the recipe based on other reviews. I cut down the amount of both sugars, added mini chocolate chips and only 4oz of shaved chocolate because that's all I had on hand. Baked for approx. 12 min in a 350 degree oven. They were crisp on the outside and chewy inside. Definitely a keeper!!

I made these for my husband's birthday and they received RAVE reviews- "best cookies I've ever tasted" reviews. I used quick cooking oats and didn't process them, and for chocolate I chopped a Lindt 70% dark chocolate bar and a Milka milk chocolate bar, then added a few semi-sweet chocolate chips. Per other recommendations, I used about 1/2 the granulated sugar and 3/4 the brown sugar. They were fabulous!

Rating: 2
The recipe from an ingredient perspective was promising, so I made a batch. After reading several reviews I concluded that these cookies should not be baked for the full 15 minutes so I adjusted the baking time to 13 minutes. I continued to adjust the baking time by one minute until the cooled cookie was not a crispy shingle. I found that at 10 minutes the softness factor was acceptable but over all the cookie is a lot of extra processing, ball rolling mediocre cookie.

Rating: 2
This recipe reminds me of the infamous Neiman Marcus $250 cookie recipe (a hoax per snopes.com), with peanut butter. I reduced the sugars and the chocolate chips by 25%, and I still feel like I'm in a diabetic coma. Next time I'll cut the salt, sugars and chocolates in half, using a 70%+ dark chocolate bar and add nuts per another baker's suggestion.

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe, rolled the dough into a log and refrigerated it for slice-and-bake cookies. We don't love chocolate, so I slice the cookies about 1/2" and bake; if I feel like chocolate in them, I slice about 1/4", put a few chips in, and top with another 1/4" of dough -- works great! Sprinkle raw sugar on the top.

I will make these cookies again. Next time I will not use as much sugar or chocolate. I will also make sure to under bake them to get that soft center.

I ran out of choc chips, and added 1/2 ground walnuts instead. I used a small ice cream scoop to freeze dough balls, storing them between layers of freezer paper. The text in the Gourmet article mentioned that Dr.Jose cooks them in a toaster oven. So my new guilty pleasure is a fresh cookie from the toaster oven On Demand. What a life.

OK....I have made these again! I cut back just 1/4 on the sugar and I added a couple sprinkles of sea salt on the top of each cookie. I could eat the entire batch.....

I found this recipe in Gourmet years ago. My mom and I made them all the time & called them Doctor Jose Cookies for short. They are my favorite cookie - the protein from the peanut butter and fiber from the oats make them a not-so-guilty treat.

I made these for my husband and he says they were very good! (I didn't actually taste them b/c I can't stand peanut butter lol). I made them exactly as the recipe called for and will make them again (for him)! Next time I will use less flour and more whole oats. Thank you for a recipe that I can make for my handsome man! :)

I too believe this is the best cookie recipe. I think the peanut butter is what makes them so light tasting. I followed the recipe exactly. I processed the chocolate instead of grating, much easier. Chocolate in every bite...yes.

These cookies are awesome! I saw on the internet that this recipe has won some best cookie contests, and they may be on to something! Make it just like it says. The grated chocolate is the key.

Rating: 4
Been making this recipe for years -- it's easy and everyone loves them. About grating the chocolate: I solved that problem by using my blender to chop up 8 oz of chocolate chips, it's done in a flash and there's none of the static thing going on as there is when you grate a block of chocolate. I have toyed with the idea of using bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet, but haven't done it yet. Why mess with perfection? I don't refrigerate the dough as the recipe calls for but it's nice to know you can keep the dough in the fridge for a week and bake them off as needed. (Not that the dough would last so long, it's that good raw.)

I'm so happy I found this recipe! I had an old photocopy of the magazine page that a friend had given me, and despite making multiple copies I managed to lose them all. This is my favorite cookie - and my husbands. I promised him a batch for his birthday, and now he can have it! It's everything you want in a cookie - I add walnuts.

Well, the good thing about these cookies is I get to skip the gym. Grating 8 squares of chocolate was a work-out in and of itself! I always like to follow a recipe to the letter the first time so I can properly "rate" the cookie. These are absolutely wonderful. The grated chocolate is a must! I'm thinking these will replace my annual holiday peanut butter Hershey's kisses cookies we all know and love & I'll put a peanut butter Hershey's kiss atop these for a twist!

Rating: 4
These are the most incredible cookies. I make them very often for clients and for myself. I don't bother too blitz the oats and I don't chill the dough. I almost always add a little extra PB too help hold the whole oats together. I also bake them @ 350 for about 10mins. I like the way this helps make the exterior a little crunchy while leaving the middle soft. I will say that the grated chocolate is essential, its worth going to the trouble! Someone actually told me these were the best cookies they had ever had, and It's hard for me to disagree.

Rating: 4
YUM! I needed a recipe to try some peanut flour I had bought. The first time I used 1/2 c. The second time 1 cup and each time adjusted the wheat flour. I was lazy and did not grate the chocolate. I found that slightly undercooking them produced a delightful almost melt in your mouth quality that after a day became a bit chewy. Crispy, chewy, pipping hot, or a day old they are wonderful. Thank-you Dr. Bowen and Gourmet!

I searched for a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie and when I saw this one rated for 4 forks and read the reviews I thought this had to be a great cookie. I was wrong. I do not know what the other reviewers saw in this cookie. For a comparison I backed the full amount of time indicated, then baked less time as recommended. It did not make a difference in the cookie texture. I thought it had a very grainy texture, not pleasing. The taste was OK but not a strong peanut butter taste. I did not use the grated chocolate as recommended by other reviewers and found that was a mistake. My husband thought the cookie was lacking for chocolate. I will not bake this cookie again. There are much much better recipes than this one.

Wow- a yummy cookie. I did try to make it 'healthy'. I used 1 stick of butter & 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I also cut down the sugars to 3/4 of a cup each and took out the grated chocolate. I went for 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose. Very tasty!!!!

This is my family's favorite cookie. After many years of regular, yet good, chocolate chip cookies, these are out of this world. They are more work, grating chocolate with any tool other than a sharp knife is impossible. This job i assign to a man of the house and they're willing because the result is so great. The cookies come out with thin layers of chocolate throughout. The oatmeal and peanut butter are hints of unexpected flavor and the texture is so different and great. Really worth the extra effort!

These cookies are one of my husbands favorites. They are easy to make and so delicious. I never really put them in the fridge over night, I just prep and bake and they turn out divine!!! If you are and chocolate chip cookie lover try these and I assure you, you won't be disappointed.

These have to be the best cookies in the history of the cookie-making world. I found this recipe when I was looking for something I could pass off as a relatively healthy snack for a girls basketball team. The coaches had been adamant that pre-game bus-ride snacks had to be healthy, so I was a little apprehensive after sending this (along with apple slices) when it was our turn for snacks. Not to worry, the players and the coaches loved them and politely asked for more. I have since made them countless times, with many variations, and they are always wonderful. I had a few disasters trying to grate chocolate (there is some static electricity thing that goes on and makes the chocolate fly around uncontrollably), so instead of adding grated chocolate, I have used a little melted chocolate, grated chocolate (the kind for making hot chocolate) and even Nutella. But generally, I leave the grated chocolate and substitutes out. I usually add lots of coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans. And I often add more oats than called for. Alway, always, they are wonderful. Sometimes I bake half the batch, then form the rest into slightly flattened disks, freeze them, then keep them in a zipper bag in the freezer for use whenever they're needed. (And I discovered in this way that the frozen dough is a pretty good treat, too!)

Rating: 4
These are great cookies! I was looking for a recipe just like this. Leaving out the grated chocolate cut down on the considerably long prep time, and since the recipe has lots of chocolate chips, I don't know what more chocolate would add to it. I don't agree with some previous reviewers saying that they're dry, but then I didn't bake them as long as stated in the recipe, so they came out nice and chewy. They didn't spread during baking at all, so I'm glad I flattened them before they went into the oven. Way to go, José!

Made this recipe tonight to satisfy my sweet tooth, they were delicious. I did take the advice of the previous reviews and cut the sugars to 3/4 cups and did not use the grated chocolate.

I can't cook. In fact, if I mention the word cooking to anyone in my family, they cringe. However, if I mention chocolate chip cookies, they run out to the nearest grocery store to grab the ingredients. I have to tell you, this recipe makes me think my old chocolate chip cookies were a hoax. I can't decide whether to shout this recipe out loud to anyone who will listen, or to keep it to myself so I can surprise people with my superb baking skills. Thank you for making me seem like a cookie genius.

Definitely a keeper. Didn't used the shaved chocolate but followed the recipe closely otherwise...twice even! Slightly under baked and allowed to cool on the sheet to set so they remained soft.

This is a very good recipe. I used 3/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1 cup, added 3/4 of a bag of chocolate chips and about a 1/2 cup chopped pecans. It added a crunchy/salty layer.It did not interfere with the peanut butter because that was a background taste. I made them on the small side and made sure they were slightly underdone. They were then not too hard when served room temp the next day.

Yes, Yes, Yes Now that is a cookie. I just scrapped all of my other chocolate chip cookie recipes. I was out of brown sugar so I used about a 1 1/2 cups of white plus a quarter cup of molasses and really liked it. I've made these a few times now and decided to cut back on the peanut butter, it's nice that it's there but I don't want it to be a predominant flavor. These cookies get destroyed in my house, if I made them more often we'd all be fat.

These are one of the best cookies I've ever made. I get rave reviews on them all the time and they disappear quickly wherever I bring them. I don't always grate the 8 oz of chocolate - but chop it finely with a knife, or sort of shave it. In order to do that I chill it until quite cold.

These cookies turned out amazing! I used about a 1/4 cup less of both sugars and they were still a little sweet. I also didnt add the semisweet grated chocolate, I thought that would be too much. They turned out perfectly! Definitly will make again

I made the recipe as written, except I was only able to incorporate about 6 ounces of grated chocolate, my processor having given up the ghost grating and leaving me with the remaining 2 ounces to grate by hand. No way! I also found that the cookies only required 11-12 minutes of baking in my ovens. I was confused about the direction to bake until golden. Incorporating the grated chocolate into the cookie dough resulted in a chocolate coloured dough, so it was impossible to read them as golden. Husband loved them: refered to them as having a depth of flavour.

I am alone in the house with a freshly-baked batch of these and it is a dangerous situation! They are so good! I used about 2/3 whole wheat flour instead of white flour, did not grind the oats,used slightly less of both brown and white sugars, and eliminated the grated chocolate altogether, and they turned out perfectly. Noticable peanut butter flavor and perfect amount of chocolate chips. Not too sweet and nice texture from the oatmeal. This is a keeper!

Fabulous recipe! Everyone raved, I made a simpler version, I didn't grind the oats, skipped the grated chocolate and just added some extra chocolate chips and only had chunky peanut butter.

Made these as part of the holiday cookie line up. They weren't my personal favorites (I'm more of a sugar cookie girl), but were an overwhelming hit with the coworkers and family members who ate them.

I'll definitely make them again - they're simple to throw together (didn't chill, just prepared like regular drop cookies) and everyone loved them.

This is a very forgiving recipe. It has become my pantry clean out. I have used white chocolate chips, peanut butter/milk chocolate chips and others to name a few. I like the addition of the grated chocalate to this recipe. Halloween candy is a great substitute too! I think what makes the texture in this cookie is the ground oats.

The 1st time I made these we loved them, tho I didn't add the grated chocolate. I think it's a great basic recipe to have fun with. So, I make these a little different every time, trying some of the suggestions I read here for making them less sweet, crispier, and healthier. I prefer my cookies crunchy on the outside and soft in the center. One of my daughters likes them crunchy throughout. So, I bake a few longer for her. I tried substituting some of the sugar with applesauce, but we didn't like them as much this way. I have never added the grated chocolate, as it always seemed like too much chocolate, but then some would say, "Is there such a thing as too much chocolate?. However, this time I will cut back on the semi-sweet chips to 6 oz. and add in 8 oz. of dark, bitter-sweet, grated or chopped chocolate. Also going to try using almond butter instead of peanut butter and a mix of butter, shortening and healthy margarine. Still making them my own.

YUM! I used half wheat flour, half white. Also, natural peanut butter... perfecto!

The recipe as is is great. Read the reviews and, for me, shortneing makes a cookie soft not chewy not cutting down on sugar helps with the chewiness. However, I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 c of each per others, upped the salt b/c I like salty-sweet, didn't use grated chocolate, used less chips, added some brittle, added dollops of chilled peanut butter so I would have ribbons of it in the finished cookie. Flexible recipe.

Everyone loved these cookies! They disappeared almost as fast as my Hammentaschen cookies, which everyone says are the best they've ever had. I did not add the grated chocolate as they seemed to have enough with the chocolate chips. I suggest adding raisins instead of the chocolate chips or in addition to. They're like a meal unto themselves. A healthful snack, tho sweet.

A winner for sure...my family loved these! So did I (very tempting to eat the dough pre-baked!!) Nice combination of all 3 items and a keeper for my recipe box. I followed the recipe to the letter except for two things: a. I used a combination of semisweet AND milk chocolate (like one reviewer, I raided my daughter's Easter stash!) for the grated stuff and b. I didn't flatten cookies before I baked them. The grating was the most challenging part for me; using the ol' food processor device saved me a lot of grief and mess -- tried doing it by hand...uggh!! One sentiment that I noticed in other reviews: DO use 'natural' peanut butter. It's better for you anyway, and probably makes the cookie not as sweet. (I contemplated cutting back on the sugars as other reviewers suggested, but felt I should follow the recipe the first time around...baking, unlike regular cooking, is a science, and I was worried about ruining my cookies.)

Rating: 0
Really good! Rave reviews. Mine were a little dry and I had to add extra water to the dough after mixing, but I think it's because I used an herb-infused ghee instead of butter... which just made the cookies all the more "special" :-) And they were still extremely delicious

Takes a little extra time to make but the final product is absolutely amazing. Reccomended for all cookie lovers.

I've now made 3 versions of this cookie, all with one batter. I did process a cup of the oats, and I did use the grated chocolate (I used bittersweet, tho). I think those 2 steps are critical to making this cookie special. Taking some tips from others, I increased the PB (natural, peanuts only) to 1 cup; decreased sugars to 3/4 cup each; decreased butter to 1/2 cup and made up the difference with 1/4 cup applesauce and the additional 1/4 cup PB. I baked some of the dough in an 8x8 pan for bars which I did not care for - soft and chewy - if you like that, you would like the bars. Then I baked some cookies at 325 until pale golden. Excellent cookie, but too soft for me. I then baked some at 350 until light brown, and those were PERFECT. Nice crisp texture on the outside, moist inside.

Still baking these beauties, and YUM! I can't leave them alone! The oatmeal provides the wonderful texture you expect from an oatmeal cookie, but the peanut butter makes them insanely good.

Otherwise followed the recipe exact. Will definitely make again and experiment with other chips.

I've made these several times and had great results : crunchy around the edges, soft in the middle. I've frozen dough and baked later, with great results.

Very good cookie! A note - the recipe says fifteen minutes for a reason. The first batch seemed under-done at 15 minutes, so I left them in for 20. After cooling, they were definitely too crispy. I took out the second batch at exactly 15 minutes, cooled on the tray and then transfered to a baking rack. Ten minutes later - PERFECT. I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter, but these were great - the peanut butter taste is perfect. I used crunchy because my roommate is a big fan of crunchy pb, but next time, definitely smooth peanut butter. Will definitely make again - they were a big hit!

These cookies were wonderful. I made them "as is", though I grated up the kids' milk chocolate easter bunnies instead of using grated semisweet. Everyone raved. Love the texture, love the flavor. Next time, I'll try using natural peanut butter and maybe some more grated chocolate. Definitely a keeper.

Hands down, the most delicious cookie recipe I have ever come across. For those who are mad about the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, this is cookie nirvana! I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was quite stiff, which had me concerned. But the cookies came out with a lovely chewy texture, and the children (not to mention me!) adored them!

Rating: 4
Wow....i can't say how the cookies were because I ate all of the dough! Seriously...I read most of the reviews and decided to compile the best notes. Less of sugars (3/4 cup), more peanut butter (1 cup) and I did grind up one cup of the oatmeal for texture. I also used an entire package of semi-sweet chocolate chips but I chopped up the entire package (coarsely) to get that residue of grated chocolate. For the remaining dough that was not devoured, I chilled overnight. Oh! I also did 1.5 sticks of butter and used one cup of shortening for a chewier texture...even as much as I love butter, it truly makes a difference in texture. All I can say is DELICIOUS. Pretty hard to screw these up!

I had high hopes for these cookies based on the reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter. I did like the idea of grinding the oats and using some whole-seems healthy. I don't know what I'd do differently but I like the peanut butter/Hershey Kiss cookie recipe I have much better. They seemed like much more work than just making Toll House and substituting half peanut butter for the shortening.

I've been making these cookies since the recipe first appeared in Gourmet ten years ago. My three boys have very distinct preferences, but are unanimous in their love for these. I usually substitute mini chocolate chips for the grated chocolate and don't process the oats. I just throw a cup of oats in with the chocolate chips. I also substitute some butter-flavored shortening for some of the butter to make a chewier cookie. The true "secret" to these is to not overcook them. I take them out when they actually look underdone and by the time they've cooled a bit, they are perfect. I love to try new recipes, but this one is the king of the cookies at our house!

These cookies are delicious! I didn't bother processing the oatmeal. I substituted white whole wheat flour for half the flour and grated milk chocolate for half of the semisweet -- they turned out wonderful. I shared them with a friend and she called after her first bite wondering how much she would have to pay to get the recipe. Don't skip the step of grating the chocolate, I am convinced that this is what really makes this a great cookie!

These are terrific. We made mini ones today without chocolate chips and while still hot dropped a dark chocolate pastille on top of each one. As others recommended I cut back the sugars. I used 1 cup natural PB (I just don't like the idea of my kids eating products with hydrogenated oils and all of the other additives found in other PB's). This produced a moist, delicate texture.

These were a big hit. The peanut butter was there, but not overpowering, and worked surprising well with the oatmeal.

For those of you who mentioned not liking the "taste" of the baking soda or baking powder (how you can taste these is beyond me), you can easily remedy this. First, baking soda is of course the leavening (in addition to the powder), but being an alkaline, it's used to neutralize the acidity from the brown sugar (molasses is acidic) and chocolate (also acidic). Just replace the soda with all powder. Just know that you're not mellowing out the aciditiy that is provided by the br. sugar and chocolate - not that it's bad! Use about 2 tsp. more baking powder. First smell your baking soda and make sure it's fresh. Those who don't like the taste of baking powder (which is even more odd to be able to taste this with all of the other strong flavors - esp. only 1/2 tsp in the entire recipe), omit the baking powder and add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. more baking soda. But I have a feeling it's not the baking powder itself you're tasting but spoilage. A lot of people keep this in their cupboards or refrigerators WAY past their expiration date. Or maybe you do have an aversion to aluminum-based ingredients! If that's the case, do try the other types of baking powders. Until then, try to just substitute baking soda (but be aware of the differing proportions used and the fact that the powder has a neutralizing agent that the alkaline soda doesn't have). I'm sure I'll see a lot of posts saying "you can't just substitute one for the other!" No, often you can't. But sometimes, with some ingredients, in some recipes, you can. Especially with baking, you have to know when you can and can't change or substitute something. I'm a baker. Baking is what I do. Through a lot of trial an error, I've learned what can and can't be changed. This is a time when you can. As most of you have noticed, these cookies are like muffins... they can withstand about 30 - 40% variation in several of the ingredients before you actually screw 'em up.

I didn't find these to be anything special. I added an extra 1/4 cup PB but did not cut back the sugar, as others did. Maybe that would help, they did seem a little overly sweet and I think that blocked the peanut butter taste. Also, I don't think semi-sweet choc is the way to go w/ PB. Milk chocolate all the way!

Rating: 3
I just made these cookies for an office party. My issue with this recipe is the baking powder. I could taste it and might try the non-aluminum brands next time, however, after looking at several other cookie recipes, I found most do not call for baking powder at all. Has anyone tried making these without it? I followed the advice of others by cutting the sugars to 3/4 cup and increasing the PB to 1 cup. I also used organic crunchy peanut butter and I did grind the oats as I find that a fairly easy step. Skipped grating the chocolate. Overall I liked the cookie and will make these again either reducing the baking powder or getting rid of it all together.

I added more peanut butter than the recipe called for...because I love peanut butter and the cookies were awesome. I also really enjoyed having all of the oatmeal flavor without all of the oatmeal texture.

Rating: 4
Mmmmm... I did grind the oatmeal, half the salt, 1 cup of smooth PB and left out the ground chocolate and made them into golf ball size dough balls and baked for 20 min. Stays moist for days. Looks and taste better than any of the fresh bakes from the mall!

Make it 3 1/2 forks. I really liked these cookies. I did not add the grated chocolate. I substituted about 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (1/4 pastry flour, 3/4 bread flour) and used a little less sugar, per previous suggestions. I also increased the peanut butter a bit. Based on this experience, next time I make these I'll cut the sugar to 3/4 C each, increase pb to 1 C and substitute at least 1 C whole wheat flour. Makes for less unhealthy cookie (as cookies go, that is!) Delicious!

I've already made these twice and everyone loves them. It's a good comfort cookie. I reduced both sugars to 3/4 cup and just used grated bittersweet chocolate. I like the texture of the cookie when you grind the oatmeal. A good dough to make a couple days ahead and freeze, then bake when you need them.

chopped up some peanuts and mixed them in becuase it didn't taste nutty enough to me. I don't chop up the oats or anything. Everyone likes them.

This recipe is bad news...for those trying to watch their weight! I have probably eaten 2 dozen by myself in the last couple of days! I used dark chocolate chips and ommitted the ground chocolate, used margarine instead of butter and didn't have quite enough oatmeal. Still they turned out soft, chewy and delicious. A nice change from my normal choc. chip cookies.

This little recipe stands up well to all sorts of modifications - thanks to all of you for the great suggestions about cutting back on the sugars and increasing the peanut butter, both of which I did. The result: a fantastic little cookie with lots of peanut butter flavor (I used all natural), oat-y texture (I didn't grind the oats this time; we're taking the cookies on a hiking trip, and I thought delicate little sweetmeats would be sort of inappopriate), and chocolate chips (all I had on hand were the miniature semi-sweet kind, and they've worked out well with these cookies, which don't spread much at all and stay pretty small). Thanks, too, for the tip about chilling the dough in the freezer - I was too impatient to wait the 2-hour refrigerator method - but I'm wondering if making that switch was what forced me to increase the cooking time a little? I have a batch in the oven right now at 350 degrees... We'll see how they do. Anyway, thanks for all the tips, everyone!

Once again, I am thankful for previous reviews as my cookies turned out great using suggestions from others. I decreased the sugars to 3/4 cup each and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. I did not bother with adding grated chocolate, just a bag of semi-sweet. I did, however, take the step of grinding the one cup of oatmeal, thinking there must be something to that. I was right. I honestly believe that is key to how good these cookies really are and encourage others to try it next time--it takes only seconds in your food processor or electric chopper. The texture is very different from traditional oatmeal and this lets the peanut butter shine through. Recipe does make a lot of cookies (small family). After baking two dozen, I prepared the rest of the dough and froze on cookie sheets before transferring to freezer bags. Give this recipe a try--good for October/Halloween parties.

Definitly the BEST cookies I have ever made. Added extra peanut butter and less chocolate (also had to melt the chocolate due to difficulties with the mixer) and they were amazing. Chewy and wonderful. MAKE THIS RECIPE! (Also, didn't do the weird step at the beginning with food processor and oats, and I "chilled" the dough by placing it in the freezer for 45minutes)

Delicious! I followed the recipe as directed and they were perfect. They don't spread much when they bake, which I liked. These are now at the top of my list to make again (and again)!

These turned out awesome - even though they are rather on the sweet side (I did not heed the advice of the reviews before me) they are amazing. Great texture. Next time I would definitely reduce sugar and increase peanut butter for more peanut taste. I baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfectly chewy on the inside, crisp on the out. Don't hesitate to make these!

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. I like that it doesn't spread; it stays chewy and high (not flat and spread out). I substitute the grated chocolate with 1 cup of peanut butter chips. This enhances the peanut butteryness which is perfect with the chocolate chips. I have never ground the oats- it is fine without that step.

ok, at the cottage, didnt have butter, didnt want to grind the oats (who does that anyway)and improvised...BY MOTHER IN LAW SAID ITS THE BEST COOKIE SHE EVER TASTED...olive oil instead of butter 1/4 cup OLIVE OIL. dont bother grinding the oatmeal..use 1/2 DRY QUANTITY oatmeal, 1/2 flour..everything else is the same and they are AMAZING...

Of all the "baking" recipes I have, this cookie recipe is hands-down the most consistent -- they always turn out perfectly, they stay soft and chewy (but cripsy on the edges), and are very "packable" for trips. While I do grind my oatmeal (I love the texture and wouldn't want to change it a bit), I usually make these cookies in large batches for lots of hungry kids, so I make them mini-sized with mini ingredients like mini chocolate chips and mini M&Ms. They don't spread, so many can fit on the same pan. I agree with the other reviewers about the subtlety of the PB taste (and the oatmeal, for that matter) -- but that's why I think they are so good; they suit everyone's taste. The best cookies around!

Rating: 2
This is basically a chocolate chip cookie recipe with a few bells and whistles. Personally, I prefer my choc chip cookies straight. This recipe is too sweet for me, I guess because of the pb. The oatmeal is a nice addition, though. Definitely NOT my candidate for "best cookie recipe."

Rating: 4
These are fantastic cookies and very easy. This is my most requested recipe. I do modify a bit - grind all the oats but just slightly and I do NOT add the grated chocolate, just a bag of Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips (not semi-sweet). These are perfect every time.

Rating: 3
Very yummy! Changes: 1. Did not grind oats. 2. Finely chopped chocolate instad of grating. 3. Did not chill dough - but my peanut butter and unsalted butter were both used straight from the fridge, so my dough was pretty chilly. I found them very very sweet, and as such will use less sugars and chopped chocolate next time. I used real peanut butter (just peanuts) so I can't imagine how sweet it would be with a Jif-sort of pb! Will add more pb next time, could barely taste it in this batch. A delicious, rich cookie. Will be making again - soon!

These were a hit at home and at the office. I don't normally like sweets, but I wanted to try baking something for an office party. As other reviewers, I didn't grind the oats, which saved some time (and cleaning). Rather than grated chocolate, I added reeses pieces, which everyone seemed to love. Per another reviewer, I didn't add as much baking soda as required. These were fast, easy, and delicious. I will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
I thought these were pretty good and a sneaky, unlikely source of whole grain. I took the previous suggestions of forgoing grinding the oats and added the grated chocolate. I also subbed whole wheat flour for half the flour. Next time I might add more peanut butter since I thought it didn't have that strong of a pb taste.

Rating: 3
I think this is a 2 fork recipe, but everyone else who ate them thinks this deserves 4 forks, so we'll compromise at 3! Used 1 c of peanut butter which produced a nice peanut butter flavor, but didn't compensate with more flour or oats because of comments about dryness. This worked out perfectly and produced a very stiff dough that baked into very thick, crisp cookies. Cut the sugar by 3 tbsp, which wasn't enough. I'll use natural unsweetened peanut butter next time, as these cookies were just too sweet for me. Didn't bother grinding the oats or adding grated chcolate based on previous reviews. All in all, these cookies are a snap to make and loved by everyone. (Well, ALMOST!) ;)

These are great cookies, if a little light on the peanut butter side for us hard-core peanut butter fans. I wonder if earlier writers were referring to a baking powder (not soda) taste, which would occur if they used aluminum-based powder. Using aluminum-free brands will eliminate this problem.

After reading the other reviews, I also did not process the oats. I usually prefer my cookies a little underdone (to keep them soft and gooey). However, by serendipity, I discovered that baking them until the edges are nice and golden actually makes these cookies better. Unfortunately, I didn't discover that happy accident until the last batch. But I will keep that in mind for future cookies.

Fantastic chocolate and peanut butter cookies. Don't bother grinding up the oats - texture is great without taking that extra step. Halved recipe and used 1/2 cup natural pb, threw in an extra handful of oats to offset runny pb as suggested previously. Omitted granulated sugar and used 1/4 c Splenda instead. Did not add grated chocolate, just used high quality chocolate chips and threw in an extra handful for good measure. My family thought these may have been the best cookies we ever made. Very easy, too.

The BEST cookie ever. My family just loves these. I don't do the grated chocolate--just add 2 c. chocolate chips instead. I also don't bother with putting the oatmeal in the Cuisinart--the texture of the cookie is better with the whole rolled oats. I use organic peanut butter, which is a bit runnier, so I add an extra 1/4 c. of oatmeal. I also substitute 1 c. of the white flour with whole wheat flour--it doesn't seem to have any effect on the taste or consistency. I bake them at 350 for 11-12 minutes. Divine!

We love peanut butter, oatmeal, and chocolate.... so these cookies satisfy each craving! Love em. I didn't use the chocolate shavings or regular chips, and simply used chocolate chunks. They are still great. I cooked some at the recommended 15 minutes at 325 (a little under cooked, I think, but really soft) and some at 340 for 20 minutes. That batch was more crunchy and great for dunking. Either way... very good. I will try it to the letter next time...

These cookies are delicious. I made these using 3/4 C white sugar, 1/2 C. light brown and 1/2 dark brown sugar. I also used only 1/2 of the vanilla (personal preference) and 1/4 C. crisco for the butter (to help keep them soft). I added 1 cup chopped salted peanuts, and used 8 oz. mini chocolate chips instead of the grated chocolate. They were delicous!

I gave this the fourth fork because it was so EASY! From the reviews I was expecting a mess, but they sounded so good I had to try them! You will not be disappointed I did what another reviewer had done and cut the recipe in half, but used 1/2 c of natural creamy peanutbutter and 1 c chocolate chips but no shavings. I rolled the dough into logs and threw it in the freezer for an hour then just cut off what I needed and baked it. They were bigger than suggested, so it took the whole 15 minutes. THEY WERE FABULOUS!!! I ate two fresh out of the oven, but they were gone so fast that I didn't get to try one cold. What a perfect cookie! The were SO soft in the middle and crisp on the edges and they taste HEAVENLY! Just because the dough was so good, I made a tripple batch of the oats for next time! I'm just going to keep some dough in the freezer! Oh, the only thing I can think of that I do differently with (all) my cookies is that when the dough is on the tray the "balls" are cylindrical and more tall than wide. So the middle is always soft :) Have fun!

These are really yummy cookies. I just baked them and am eating one now hot out of the oven with a glass of cold milk - I don't think it gets any better than that! I substituted whole wheat flour, sugar in the raw, and natural crunchy peanut butter for the standard ingredients to make these "healthier" (of course healthy is relative, since these have two sticks of butter in them!). I also used salted butter and then used only a pinch of salt. These are very good cookies. The peanut butter is subtle - I would add more next time. I like these a lot. I don't think they're out-of-this-world, but they're delicious!

Good idea, but the extra added 8oz of grated chocolate makes it way too sweet and the cookies loose the peanutbutter and oatmeal flavors. Should be called double chocolate chocolate chip cookies.

These were great and I got many requests for the recipe. I even halved the recipe because that's all the chips I had and they were great. Chilled the dough overnight so I had to flatten a bit when I baked them. I didn't do the chopped chocolate -- used all chips (Ghiradelli double chocolate chips, not semisweet -- much richer chocolate taste). Some said these were the best tasting choc. chip cookies they ever had. I lightly chopped the oats in food processor and used salted butter, not margarine. Highly recommend!

This recipe was delicious. I love peanut butter, chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies so this was a great combo of the three as far as I am concerned. The second time I made it I used half the amount of grated chocolate, which made room for more of a peanut butter flavor. I liked both batches, so I for one would adjust it according to my craving at the time of preparing the batter. It was a big hit with family and friends. This one is a keeper!

Excellent recipe...not "hard" as one reviewer stated. One substitution I made...butter purtist, cover your eyes...I tried the new Land-o-Lakes butter for baking with cannola oil. The flavor was indistinguishable from the regular butter, and this may be why the cookies didn't get hard.

I made these cookies today for my family even though I'm on a diet and couldn't try one. I usually don't struggle with the temptation of sweets but I think these were the best smelling cookies I've ever baked and I have to say it took a lot of willpower to stay away. I had to use salted butter and my family says they were a bit salty. Aside from that they loved them. I suppose when I make them again if I have to use salted butter I'll maybe just add a pinch of salt.

didn't use chocolate. used dark brown sugar, and added about a tablespoon of molasses, and a little bit of cinamon, ginger, and nutmeg. (about 1/8-1/4 tsp each) ground the oats, but only a little. basically put them in the blender and pulsed a couple times. baked about 9 minutes, until edges were dry. turned out nice and chewy, mellow peanut butter flavor, with an almost caramel-like quality

I followed the recipe and was very disappointed in this dry, crumbly cookie. Don't bake for 15 min. 8 min is plenty for a soft cookie. The shaved chocolate is a pain and overpowered the peanut butter. Grinding the oats is an unneeded step. Don't bother with this one.

I also used quick-cooking oats instead of processing. I think the grated chocolate added a lot. The peanut-butter-chocolate combo in the dough was really nice. I reduced the amount to 4 oz and used very high quality chocolate. Since I grated it with my microplane, it melted almost on contact with the dough, which resulted in a nice swirly cookie with pockets of different flavors.

Best ever, chocolate and peanut butter cookies. Second time I made them added more crunchy PB. Didn't bother with grinding the oats. I've made only with chips not grated chocolate.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but this is just a response to the cook from Washington, DC: I've found that an easy and fast way to grate a hunk of chocolate is to use a good vegetable peeler. It makes for bigger chunks that won't melt while you grate. No food processor to wash, either.

I thought this recipe turned out great, however, the peanut butter lover that I am, I would add more peanut butter next time. Just a tip... I find that rolling cookie dough into balls and flattening makes for a tougher cookie. Just drop from the spoonful, they will flatten on their own and will be much more chewy.

I loved these cookies. I did however skip the grated chocolate, as I found the chips alone to be a good amount of chocolate. I brought these to work, and my co-workers loved them too.

I'm not a big fan of chocolate chip cookies, but these are probably The Ultimate Cookie. My coworkers loved them. The oats and peanut butter add flavor and texture. The flattened-ball method gives a nice, tidy appearance. These are a LOT more work than your average cookie. The grated chocolate was a major pain. I tried two methods: a) grating into a container with a special grater lid, which made an ungodly mess of chocolate bits flying everywhere and led the chocolate to melt all over my fingers even after I chilled it first; and b) chopping the chocolate in the mini-food processor, which was easier but left the chocolate looking sort of chewed-up and crumbly rather than flaked and also made a huge din. Betweeen the two methods, I'd say only seven of the original eight ounces made it into the dough. In the future I'll probably stick with method b, or else skip the chocolate entirely. I used natural PB because I didn't want to buy a whole jar of the nasty hydrogenated stuff just for one recipe, and it worked fine. Chilling the dough makes it much easier to shape and prevents the cookies from overbaking. Hint: the bottom of a glass dipped in water is a handy tool for flattening the dough balls. The bottom line: I recommend this recipe highly, if you have a little time on your hands and are really striving for the ultimate cookie.

Although the recipe looks wonderful, I found the cookies to be hard to handle in dough form and very dry. I thought they lacked body and taste.

These cookies were delicious and when I took them to a party, I was asked for the recipe. Easy to make and I'd definitely make them again!

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves the cookies! It does make a lot. I keep part of the dough in the freezer so I can take these at a minutes notice.

I made these for the first time a couple weeks ago and am going to make them again this weekend to bring to a party. They are amazing!!! If you like a soft, chewy cookie, you can't go wrong with the combination of peanut butter and chocolate.

Delicious! I thought these were the best cookies I've ever eaten, and I'll make them again and again. Huge hit with our friends. And...the dough is divine. We only ended up baking about 1/5 of the dough :-)

Thank you Jose!!! These cookies are beyond belief. I make them about once a month and bring them to the office and they're GONE within two hours. I'm now famous for these cookies. Don't change a thing in the recipe -- remember to chill them long enough. One time I was in a hurry and didn't and they came out crunchy instead of that wonderful chewy texture, but they were still good. These are the cookies I make when I want to impress someone or give a "thank you" gift.

These cookies were so good! Everyone that I gave a cookie to, loved it!! Like one other reader, I did not use the grated chocolate in the recipe. The chocolate chips are enough. I think I'll experiment next time. Maybe not grind so much of the oatmeal so they are a little chunkier. And possibly add chopped walnuts!

Another note is that this recipe freezes very well--a good thing because one batch makes a ton of cookies. I squish it into logs and double wrap in aluminum foil. Makes an excellent gift for those who love home-baked cookies, and much better than store-bought slice-n-bake. The only problem is that most of the dough in my house gets eaten frozen and never makes it to the oven.

Great blend of flavors, perfect texture, and the perfect treat to give to friends during exam times. I used 2c of quick oats, and the texture was perfect.I tried different baking times, so that some were crispy and some were chewy - they were great both ways.

Looking for a recipe for peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies, I found this outstanding one. I used quick oatmeal and added spanish peanuts, and omitted the grated chocolate. These are super rich. I'll have to try to keep my hand out of the cookie jar. It will be difficult.

I too am ever on the search for that perfect chocolate/peanut butter combination and this is as good as it gets in terms of cookies. These are great! I used quick oats and still got a great texture (and saved some hassle). I thought the 8 oz. of ground chocolate overrode the peanut butter taste slightly, so next time I'll probably use lest chocolate (and sub some milk chocolate) and use a little more peanut butter. I underbaked mine a little (12 minutes) and got a nice gooey middle and softness that lasted for a few days. This is my new cookie recipe!

These cookies were nothing too special, especially considering the effort of grinding the oatmeal and grating the chocolate. I used unsweetened peanut butter (from Trader Joe's). Next time, I'm going to try adding raisins and bringin' these on the trail. Gorp Cookies?!

These cookies are GREAT! I make them in double batches and give them away, and people keep telling me I should go into the cookie business! I use cake flour to make them chewier, and add toffee or peanut-butter chips for extra flavor. They're fun to make with kids too!

This is my new favorite cookie recipe .. with a few modifications. I used quick oats and didn't grind them. Instead of chocolate chips/grated chocolate, I used a mixture of milk and dark chocolate baking discs (about the size of a quarter) and pressed them into the cookies just before baking. They are amazing! I refrigerated the dough overnight and had to bake them this morning since I couldn't wait to try them.

I made these cookies twice with a couple of small changes to the recipe and they were great. I followed the suggestions of the other cooks and did not process the oatmeal. I also cut the number of chocolate chips and added Reese's peanut butter chips to the batter. Everyone loved them!!

I gave it four forks, but I wouldn't make it again because I would end up eating the whole batch! I had to throw the recipe away, otherwise I would need a new wardrobe size. Tast test: My friend made a different kind of cookie over the same weekend and her husband liked mine. Batch makes PLENTY to give away to friends. Everyone loved them.

Four Forks AS MODIFIED. My 17 year old daughter made these last night. She skipped processing the oatmeal and omitted the grated chocolate. She did refrigerate the dough before baking. They are awesome, perfect texture, crisp but not dry. YUM

This is a great recipe. I didn't process the oatmeal, and the came out just perfect. Very rich, though, can't eat too many. My family raves about them, too. I will definately make these many times again!

I didn't add the chocolate or grind the oatmeal, and they turned out FABULOUS! They disappeared in 2 days, and my roommates miss them so much, they've started mixing peanut butter and uncooked oatmeal and eating that alone. Anyway, four forks, for sure!

Quite yummy! This is a very rich cookie, can cookies be classified as rich? I've made them many times and everyone always likes them.

YUM ... but, oh boy do I feel ill after eating way too many of them! :-) I didn't gind the oats and the cookies worked out wonderfully. Grating the chocolate took ages ... next time I'd look into another way of doing that. All my workmates gave rave reviews and ate them all!

They were excelent, I'll definitely make them again. I did use salted butter, and put the semisweet chocolate in the food processor, they turned out delicious!!! Great cookies.

This was an okay recipe. The cookies turned out good, but not fabulous. I like more of an oatmeal texture -- so if I did try these cookies again, I wouldn't grind up the oatmeal to a powder.

For a variation I added a dash of cinnamon as my family loves the taste of chocolate with a touch of cinnamon. Great!!

These cookies are very delicious! I have already made this recipe many times. I used Chunky Peanut Butter, Guttiard Chocolate Chips and Grated Callebeau Belgium Chocolate. I used a small ice cream scoop to place dough on silpat-lined cookie sheet. I did not need to flatten cookies slightly at all. Cookies seem to spread out on its own. I baked them for 10 minutes instead of 15 minutes--as soon as I saw the cookies golden brown on the edges. Get rave reviews every time.

I'd say this recipe is almost an exact copy of the 'famous Newman Marcus cookies'. Jose only added peanut butter and changed the recipe a little bit. The cookies are good, though.

Rating: 4
These were really good cookies, but I little labor intensive (the grated chocolate, grinding the oats, etc.) However they were really worth it and they didn't hang around long. My family loved them. They don't spread out during baking so if you want a nice shape you must flatten them with a glass.

OH MY GOSH! These cookies were amazing! My family and co-workers could not get enough. These will definitely become the "old standard" by which I judge any other cookie! A little time consuming, but well worth it.

These cookies are great! My family had them gone in two days and wanted more. I followed the recipe except I did not have enough chocolate chips so I added some butterscotch chips and they were tasty. Will definetly add to my cookie list.

I was very impressed with this recipe. My cookie jar at work emptied out in record time and several people asked for the recipe. Being both lazy and somewhat impatient, I skipped the grated chocolate and didn't chill the dough. Nonetheless, these baked up nice and golden (they're great-looking cookies) in 11 minutes and are now a permanent part of my recipe collection.

Everyone loved these cookies. I liked the subtle peanut butter flavor along with the chocolate and the oatmeal. An excellent combination. My only change was that I did not grind any of the oats, and the cookies were still delicious. My students, all picky teenagers, ate every one of them.
