Good for what the genre represents, comfort food with convenience. Fast prep time and easy to substitute ingredients. Very flexible recipe, we enjoyed it with almond extract.

This hits the spot every time I need a little chocolate fix... NOW! I usually have all the ingredients on hand and in about 15 minutes, poof! you have a yummy, rich desert. It took a couple of tries to figure out that you need to microwave the ramekins INDIVIDUALLY otherwise they turn out very runny/undercooked. And if they still appear runny after 1:20 I put them back in for an extra 20-30 seconds. It's kind of a pudding-ey flour-less chocolate cake.

The flavor was alright, and they were definitely easy, but way too greasy. Next time I would reduce the amount butter. Liked the cinnamon, but a little orange peel would have been nice too.

Flavor was very good but texture was uneven. Rubbery on the sides and goopy in the middle. Will try, as one person suggests, microwaving the ramekins one at a time.

These were really fast and easy to make, and I was surprised by how very good they are. I substituted 2 oz. unsweetened choc. and 4 T sugar for the 4 oz. bittersweet, since it's all I had. They aren't the prettiest things in the world, but a little powdered sugar and whipped cream fixed that.

For cooks who prefer specificity, you microwave EACH ramekin for 1 min 20 sec - not all together for 1 min 20 sec. It might seem obvious to experienced cooks but the recipe is not clear and newbies could be confused....like me. I re-waved each ramekin for 1 min and it turned out fine. No gooey center but really delicious. Otherwise, it's a really quick and easy recipe and I will definitely make it again, one ramekin at a time.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed with the results of this recipe. I made it exactly as per the instructions. After letting the puddings stand for 7 min "steaming" after microwaving them, I ended up with slightly cold, rubbery chocolate lumps. The flavour was rich and the spices were a nice combo but the texture of the cakes themselves was disappointing - spongey and tougher than expected. I might make this one more time to be sure I'm not prematurely writing it off - perhaps with the addition of grated orange rind next time to bring out the spices more. However, with all the chocolate, cream and sugar in this dessert it should be outstanding in every way to justify the calories, not just mediocre.

Delicious! Instant chocolate gratification without heating up the whole kitchen.

Fantastic! Just made it for Valentine's Day and it was the perfect finish: rich and delicious. I substituted ground cardamom for the cloves, doubled the vanilla, and used microwave-safe mugs instead of ramekins. It turned out beautifully and I am sure to make this again and again.

Dead simple and very tasty.

Chilled Perugina bittersweet chocolate in the freezer before pulverinzing in the blender (no processer). Worked well w/ some stirring up from the bottome to release the chocolate. Used microwave friendly juice glasses to mold (no ramekins) and forgot to butter, but no problem. A knife inserted up the side released the suction allowing the little puddings to slide out onto the plate. Served w/ canned whipped cream but would also consider a raspberry sauce, creme anglais or caramel to puddle on the plate under the pudding. Very easy. Very delicious. A sprinkling of powered sugar is pretty too.
