I made this for Thanksgiving 2012, along with 4 other pies, and this was by far the most popular! It was gone in a matter of seconds and everyone asked for the recipe! www.sweetspatulas.com

This never fails to impress and is a go to recipe for me. At the end of our drunken dinner parties while cleaning up, we're invariably sneaking bites from this amazing pie.

I am a VERY inexperienced cook...tried this 2 ways--using crushed chocolate graham crackers and a pre-made oreo crust....the graham crackers were far better--oreos was a bit too sweet. This is a great recipe

Delicious! Liked the suggestion of a square instead of in a pie form. Perfect and simple. Important to let set once cooked.

I placed first in a pie bake-off with this pie! It is absolutely delicious. I doubled the ingredients and made it in a 9x13 glass pan. I only used 4 cups pecans for the entire thing, though. I also used semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened chocolate. It turned out great and everyone loved it! I won by a landslide! :)

Not only is this recipe insanely easy, but it's always a huge hit. Someone actually told me this year that it was the best part of the Thanksgiving meal, which I take as a HUGE compliment. I don't even like pecans and I love these. I followed some of the feedback here and made these into bars this year-- I used a 9x9 pan and pressed the crust into the bottom of the pan (I find trying to mold cookie crumb crusts up the side of a pan a total pain). Since they're so rich, having smaller bite sized bars was really nice.

Big hit. Saved time by using store bought crust shell but regretted the skimping. This pie deserved better. Wonderfully fudgy, dense with pecans. Entering regular recipe rotation.

If you like chocolate and caramel you must make this pie! This is an easy and delicious holiday recpie. Much better than traditional pecan pie, less sweet and very satisfying. 2 cups of nuts is plenty, toasted first for best flavor. I will definitely add this to our holiday desert table again.

Delicious and easy to make. My husband loves pecans so he was in pecan heaven with this dessert. I also used creme filled chocolate cookies and discarded the filling as I could not find simple chocolate wafers. I thought it tasted even better the second day after it had refrigerated more. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is great, we have made it over a dozen times! Instead of 3 cups, I recomend using two and a half cups of pecans, and we find using half a box of "Mr. Christie's Chocolate Wafers" is the perfect amount of cookie crumbs for the crust.We find the whipping cream is not required as we never have it on hand and it seems to turn out fine without it, anyway. Also,we use a 9 inch square pan and instead of cutting it in slices we cut 1 by 1 inch squares. This recipe is great for last minute desserts and everyone always asks for the recipe and another serving after tasting it.

Wonderful recipe! I've made it three times now for various holiday gatherings and it has been excellent each time. Instead of the chocolate crust I used a normal homemade pie crust because I wanted it to look more like a traditional pecan pie. The pie crust help up great against the filling.

If you are looking for a decadent, rich, addictive and EASY impressive dessert for the holidays -- this is it! Made this 2x this week for two different events, once as a pie and once in 9 x 13 pan (doubled) as previously suggested. I liked both ways, but preferred the larger. Other previous suggestions that worked include toasting pecans before to enhance flavor and also cutting back just a bit on them 2 1/2 c instead. When I did the 9x13, I just used entire 9 oz. box of choc wafers, but doubled filling part. Also if you do 9X13, use pyrex glass pan (helps with nice crusty bottom) and it took more like 17 minutes to get to bubbly stage in oven since it was larger. This recipe is SO EASY, just pay attention on stovetop and it will become a new favorite.

I had to make my own chocolate wafers as there doesn't seem to be an equivalent over here and I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup as I can't buy that either! The result was really delicious everyone loved it, it was so simple to make too. I served it with the lovely caramel ice cream recipe from this web site, it was a fabulous pudding. I will definitely be making this one again!

I thought this recipe would turn out more like traditional pecan pie. The texture was more like a rice crispy treat. It had a good flavor but was very difficult to cut and eat. Now I understand why people make these as small bars and candy; the recipe lends itself to that. I'm glad I gave this a test run before Thanksgiving. If I made this again, I would definitely serve it that way rather than as a pie. We used Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers for the crust. They're by the hot fudge and caramel ice cream toppings of the grocery store - can be hard to find.

Great pie recipe, my kids loved it! Try momskitchenrecipes.com, it has an insane amount of recipes to choose from :)

I must say...this stuff rocks. I, too, had a hard time finding the chocolate wafer cookies, but cheap chocolate sandwich cookies with the filling removed worked just fine. So easy to put together, my S-I-L described it as much better than 'plain old pecan pie.' It also makes a great candy, just prepare in a square pan lined with foil, put crust only in the bottom. Refrigerate overnight, cut into 1" squares and place in small foil cups. I don't know why, but it just lends itself to eating it in little bites like that.

I loved this recipe with the few changes I made. I used chopped pecans instead of halved and it created a different texture. I also used a vanilla flavored homemade whipped cream on top with some shaved dark dark chocolate. My family adored this pie and people have been asking for more!!

Deeelish! My guests had a hard time deciding which was better between this and the Spiced Pumpkin Cheesecake ! This was SO easy (and I don't make desserts usually) and very rich...it tastes like it's more effort than it is! The Nabisco chocolate wafers were in the ice cream topping section of my Publix and the crust is superb with them!

I started making this when the issue came out and has been a go to dessert for me since. Simple, easy, quick to make and delicious. Always a crowd pleaser

This is a fabulous recipe! I followed the directions in the recipe, but used much fewer pecans making it more of a fudge pie with a nice crunch of pecans. I only made one last year for Thanksgiving but plan on making two this year. There were many desserts last year and this one was gone immediately!

I bake a lot... And this recipe consistently gets one of the best responses out of anything I make. Like some others, I doubled the recipe, baked in a 9x13 pan, and cut this up into bars. Everybody always says how it looks, smells, and tastes like something they would get at a bakery -- but better! I also used Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers... Found at a local food store.

Rating: 4
An amazingly simple recipe (especially if you buy the Oreo crust)! Took no time at all to make and was very rich. Make sure to at least halve the pecans to make it easier to eat. I got so many complements on it at Thanksgiving. I will definitely be making this one for Christmas as well!So freakin' good!

Rating: 3
Easy to make, unique. Found my chocolate cookies at lund's. I made this as a tart. The filling is quite firm, and with the nuts (unchopped) challenging to eat with a fork. I'm going to make these as bars, cut small, next time...thus guests will feel more comfortable using fingers to eat this treat

Rating: 3
It is easy and tastes great. I like that the filling is not too sweet and sticky. The crust is a bit crumbly, but I'm willing to trade crumbly for easy. I toasted the pecans and coarsely chopped them, so that slicing and eating would be easier.

Rating: 0
I can't review the recipe as I haven't made it, but for rmreiman and others who might wonder, for some reason those chocolate wafer cookies are almost never on the cookie aisle, but I find them in most stores if I know where to look. I found them recently on the baking aisle, top of shelf, not very noticeable... you may try looking there or ask the staff at the store. One brand is Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers, if that helps.

Rating: 3
The filling was excellent. I had a hard time with the crust; what exactly are chocolate wafer cookies? I couldn't find anything in Kroger named that--there were Nilla wafers and the cream-filled wafers, neither of which came in chocolate. So I tried chocolate graham crakers. These did not work and just crumbled. I will certainly make again, but I'll use a different cookie for the crust.

Rating: 4
SO easy and everyone raved. It's actually a 3.75 star recipe. I made it the night before and it was perfectly set for our Thanksgiving dessert. Served with spiced rum/vanilla whipped cream. It would be a 4 star recipe if it had a gooey-er filling, like a traditional pecan pie (in my opinion). A must make!

This is a tried and true favorite. I occasionally give it an extra kick with a shot of good bourbon. I add 2-3 Tablespoons just after taking it off of the heat. It adds a nice warmth and flavor without tasting like there is a lot of alcohol in it.

I must have messed up when baking. At the time it should have been done it was not really bubbly so I let it cook extra time. The cookie crust wound up burnt and the cake was very hard. When I tasted it, it was like a chewy candy.

This pie really needs to be made ahead of time to give it time to completely cool. The first time I made it the pie could better have been described as an ice cream topping; it did not hold its form well even after cooling for a few hours. After spending the night in the fridge it was well set.

What type of chocolate wafers do you use for the crust? It seems like different wafers would make a big difference.

Couldn't be easier, and for those who love pecan pies, it couldb't get any better. It basically melts in your mouth, and I think I ate half of it the first day alone. Great recipe when you are short on time, yet need something that will win over your dinner guests.

My pie came out hard as a rock and did not taste too good either! I'm not sure where I went wrong, but this recipe would be better with more details for novices about judging how long to cook at each step. I think I may have overcooked the corn syrup, and the chocolate did not gain sweetness. I was disappointed after reading the great reviews that it was not "easy as pie" for me!

This recipe is very good, though rich. My son, who is only 14, made the pie and said it was simple and fun to make. Everyone who ate it enjoyed it. My only recomendation is that you let it cool completely before serving so that you get a nice presentation because the pecans will be cut due to the denseness of the pie. A must make for parties!!!

I've made this pie twice and it was delicious and very easy to make. It's very rich though and it does use a lot of pecans so it is fairly expensive to make. Any leftovers taste great out of the fridge the next day.

What a waste of pecans! Even though it was frozen, the crust melted down; when warm, this was mush, and when room-temp, a solid chocolate block; and there was no caramel flavor at all! This is from a lover of gooey, rich, chocolate-nut desserts, too.

Rating: 2
I cheated and used a premade Oreo crust and it completely fell apart when I opened it. So I ended up saving it by adding butter anyway and didn't have time to freeze it. When the pie was done, it fell apart when I scooped it, maybe I didn't let it cool enough. It was a mess, but it tasted great as an ice cream topper. I'll make it again for ice cream topping.

WOW! Great as a pie but even better if you double the recipe and make it in a glass 9x13 pan....cut into very small squares....very rich, goes a long way at a party....rumour going around that my guests were pocketing these babies....had to do a purse check at the end of the night.

This is the first pie that I ever cooked. Everyone at the Thanksgiving dinner I prepared this for couldn't believe that I made something so that tasted so good. Very easy to make. I substituted Oreos for the crust, but I will not folow the suggestion of another reviewer to double the crust recipe next time. Too much crust makes too much mess.

This was really good, and so easy. I used the full 3 cups of pecans, and would not use fewer, because it would be too goopy. This is one rare dessert that tastes just as good a few days later, so next time I would definitely make this ahead of time.

Rating: 4
I loved the texture of this pie - more solid (fudgy) than your typical pecan pie. I used a regular (baked) pastry crust instead of the crumb crust, and used 8 oz. of pecans (plenty). As previous reviewers have stated, this was both easy and delicious. I like the idea of sprinkling extra chocolte chips over the top, and also the idea of baking this in a 9x13 pan to cut into bars. Will try these ideas next time - thanks!

This recipe was so easy! I used chocolate Nilla Wafers for the crust which I think are sweeter than the reg. choc. wafers, so it was a bit sweet. I made it in a 9x13 pan to make into bar cookies for smaller portions. It tastes like Chocolate Pecan Turtles! YUM!

Terrific pie--and easy too. I substituted semi-sweet chocolate for the unsweetened and everyone loved it, even my non-pecan pie lovers. This is a keeper!

Wonderful! And it couldn't be easier to make. However, the crust recipe was too skimpy. I doubled it and it still didn't come to the top of my 9" pie dish. I also used Oreos (with the icing as one reviewer suggested for the Black Bottom Chocolate Pie on this site, which is also a crowd pleaser) and it came out great. I plan to make this again for Labor Day. If anyone can suggest another good dessert recipe for a large party, I'd appreciate it.

I have been making a similar pecan pie that is in Cook's magazine for years, but decided to try this one. The crust was so much easier. The pie is really simply to make but wonderful.
