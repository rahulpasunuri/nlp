I made this pudding with some modifications: I baked it at 350 rather than 300 for a little over two hours, not three hours; I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of molasses or maple syrup; and I used cinnamon instead of mace. It was very good that way, and very easy to make.

Hmm...I dont think I would ever make this again. Someone would have to pay me to eat this. Strange flavor. Nothing like Rice Pudding. No wonder its a poor mans pudding, because no one else would eat it. Yuckk!

I envisioned that any recipe attached to James Beard would involve painstaking effort, but magnificent results. Well, it was a total pain to make, but it tasted really bad. I'm gonna take the halo off James Beard's head. This recipe sucks!

I tried this three hour recipe, it was a pain and the flavor was very bland. Maybe I should try the rich man's recipe. Tex
