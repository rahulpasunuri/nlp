Served over vanilla ice cream and it was delicious. I would cut the sugar in half next time.

yuuuuummmm!!! my variation: had only 2 cups of rhubarb, so reduced sugar to 1/3 c., and replaced water with fresh squeezed o.j. (about 2 T). cooked it till it was really broken down and sauce-y, and served it over a simple orange+spice cake, with a nice dollop of just slightly sweetened whipped cream on the side.

Stewed rhubarb (which is what this is) is one of my very favorite things. I ate it all the time as a kid (we had rhubarb plants in our yard and my mom was a "waste not, want not" kind of gal), but never really appreciated it until I was an adult. Anyway...after years of making this the standard way - adding water - I got a tip from a vendor at a local farmer's market. Add the amount of sugar you like to the rhubarb - NO water! - and let it stand at room temperature for a couple hours. Rhubarb will juice (just like strawberries), so you don't need to add water. Just cook it in its own juice. This will also allow you to use far less sugar than you might otherwise. (I usually use just a couple tablespoons of sugar to juice the rhubarb, then add stevia to taste after cooking - but while the rhubarb is still hot.) Ever had stewed rhubarb with cottage cheese? That's one of my favorite summer breakfasts!

Thanks to all the reviews that came before! I reduced the sugar amount and added a couple of whole star anise seeds. The compote came out with a wonderful flavor and it'll go great with brioche french toast! Such an easy thing to do with rhubarb if you suddenly find yourself too busy to make a pie.

Just like your grandmother made! Very tasty. Would make it again!

Hey, this is like old fashioned rhubarb sauce eaten at breakfast time, except i add fresh strawberries too, and let the ingredients all cook down together. Yum!

Ease and excellent. I used onl 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda to cut the sugar down and it was a hit. I added a dash of vanilla - great on pork and chicken, or even ice cream.

Delicious and super-easy. Added less sugar than directed and cooked it for only about 10 minutes so there were still chunks of rhubarb. Served it with a thin English custard over top and again the next morning as a topping on plain yoghurt.

I've always called this Rhubarb Sauce and I've also always called it heaven! My favorite way to have rhubarb - simple and delicious. Made this twice this week. Soooo good. I use a bit less sugar as I like it more tart.

Adding a small amount of savory seeds such as one or two star anise or a 1/2 tsp of cumin once you reduce the boil to a simmer adds a nice "exotic" flavor, useful when pairing the compot with, for instance, vanilla ice cream (star anise) or pork tenderloin (cumin). DO NOT grind the seeds; instead, make sure you can remove them before serving.
