A simple, delicious and unexpected sauce for ice cream. If you like pine nuts this combination is for you.

This sauce had a consistency more like a syrup than a true caramel, but it was easy to make and very tasty. I would imagine that chocolate ice cream would stand up to its sweetness and richness a little better than the coffee, so I'll try that next time--and may even substitute pecans for the pine nuts. It would probably also be fabulous over French toast for a decadent brunch entree.
