My guests really liked this dish! I marinated the zucs in the sauce as written, then made an extra batch of it with some red wine vinegar, and served the zucs on a bed of greens with tomatoes.

I thought this was very tasty. Because everyone seems to be on a diet, I used low-fat sour cream. My guests enjoyed it. Also, it used up some of the zucchini growing in my back yard.
