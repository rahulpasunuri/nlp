After reading the reviews I made quite a few changes. I subbed 5 T lemon juice, and 2 T water for the orange juice. And followed the last reviewer's recommendation to use half the sugar. It is tart but that is how I like it. After the changes I would say it came out great!

This went perfectly with chocolate torte. Usually I only like cherries in their natural state but this was lovely. I'm looking forward to having some again tomorrow.

I really wasn't a fan of the cinnamon flavor with the cherries - it really ruined it for me. The cinnamon flavor was very strong, and I don't think it paired well with fresh cherries. It made it a bot one note!

This is very good. I also used frozen cherries. I added 1 cup of cranberries and used 3 Tbl of Splenda instead of 6 Tbl of sugar. Perfect degree of sweetness and beautiful color for Holiday table. Would make a fantastic cheesecake topping.

Used a 10 oz bag of frozen cherries. First taste was way too sweet, so I added a couple big squeezes of lemon. Then it tasted perfect. Next time, I would use half or less sugar and still squeeze some lemon in. Keep in mind using frozen berries makes more sauce. Easy, quick, and delicious.
