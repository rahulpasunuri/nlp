Absolutely delicious. I used Gruyere cheese and added some Proscuitto. We ate them with a green salad and french bread. Easy to prepare and a lovely presentation.

These are wonderful. I served as a side at a five course dinner party to RAVE reviews. They are delicious, lovely presentation and not difficult to make. What could be better than that!

I loved this recipe...I think I added a little aged gouda to the mix, and used Jarlsburg....yummy :-).

Have made these a few times now, great delicate flavor to balance out a complicated main course, and not difficult at all!

This looked very pretty (especially if unmolded onto a plate), but tasted only so-so. Granted that I think I overcooked the yolk mixture -- be warned that it thickens quickly.

Very lovely meal for two. Simple, easy and very tasty. Have made several times.

This was so easy, so good, and so impressive. I used 1-cup souffles and, unlike the previous reviewer, didn't have any remaining souffle filling

Made this for supper last night and my husband and I really liked it. I found there was more batter than necessary for the suggested size of the souffle dishes. Next time I will put it all in one 8" souffle dish. And there definitely will be a next time!
