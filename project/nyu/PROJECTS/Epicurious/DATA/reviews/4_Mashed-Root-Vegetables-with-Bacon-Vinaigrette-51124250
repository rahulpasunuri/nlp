We only made a 1/2 portion with Turnips, Celery Root and Parsnips and did not let it rest overnight. We liked the change of pace from roasted root veggies, taking on that "german potato salad" like taste. We didn't reheat them and they got cold fast, looking forward to the leftovers and trying them again when I might get a slight crisp crunch on the top.

i did a variation of this and it was great! used turnip and sweet potato, and amped up the smokey flavour a bit using some apple juice. a great christmas side dish, cheers!

The big hit of the our Thanksgiving dinner. The applewood smoked bacon vinaigrette added a wonderful taste to the root vegetables. Used all the root vegetables as listed except for the kohlrabi. Our farmer's market source told us kohlrabi was more of a spring vegetable on the east coast. Never tasted kohlrabi therefore do not know what it might have added to the dish. Bottom line this was an easy and very tasty addition to our Thanksgiving Dinner. A keeper

Made the recipe exactly as written except for kohlrabi which I couldn't find. Definitely do not skip the rutabaga as it gave the dish extra sweetness. I might add more mustard seeds next time. My teenage son called it the "surprise hit" of Thanksgiving dinner.
