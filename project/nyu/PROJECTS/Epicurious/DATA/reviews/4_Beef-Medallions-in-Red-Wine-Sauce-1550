I used this sauce recipe for filet mignon, and was pleased. But the recipe itself doesn't make sense to me. Is it really supposed to be 1/4 inch thick medallions (that's 6 millimeters!)? Cooked for 2 minutes (or even 30 seconds) per side, there's no way they are still going to be pink inside. (I had 1 1/2 inch thick medallions, cooked 3 minutes per side to perfection.)

I made this to go with a whole beef tenderloin and it was delicious. I did feel the need to reduce the wine to beef ratio since it cooked seperately (and I used cheap wine). I thought it was a little heavy on the shallots, so I'll reduce them by half next time. I also added a splash of brandy and brown sugar to broaden the flavor. It takes more time to reduce, but can be made in advance to ensure there's time to thinken as needed. I also added the beef juice at the end and that rounded out the flavor perfectly.

Very good sauce. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and I will make again. Takes longer than indicated to reduce, but it eventual gets there and is thick enough...just have to be patient.

What a disappointment! I am sorry I wasted such good meat on this!

Made this twice and got raves both times. I added soaked dried porcini mushrooms along with fresh mushrooms to the saute pan with the shallots. Served with roasted carrot sticks & garnished with chopped parsley. Sauce is delicious!

This was delicious. I reduced the sauce just a bit more than was called for as I prefer a thicker, stronger tasting sauce and it was excellent. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent ... I roast a whole beef tendeloin and make the sauce separately (doubling the ingredients) and serve for Christmas dinner each year! Now a tradition in our family.

This recipe is delicious. I did find that the sauce was a little thinner than desired. I added cornstarch/water to sauce to thicken it up. I will try adding additional flour next time.

Just made this for Christmas dinner with fillet tips instead of the whole tenderloin. As one other reviewer noted this is a good use of those smaller pieces since the medallions don't need to be a uniform size. I also used a Shiraz as that's what we had and mistakenly left out the thyme. Delicious! Everyone loved it including my kids ages 8, 10 and 12. Be patient and let the sauce cook all the way. If you like this you may also like the Mahogany Beef Stew on this site - another great cold weather dish.

So easy and so delicious! I made this for Valentine's Day using tenderloin steaks. Taking the advice of other readers, I used 1 1/2 cups of a pinot noir, added portobello mushrooms and extra flour. Tasty!

This recipe is amazing! My college age son has recently started cooking and made this as a Christmas gift. It looked elegant and tasted incredible!

This was a delicious dish but I am sorry I used the cheap cut of beef instead of the tenderloin. I also used a non-alcoholic merlot and I thought it tasted great. Probably a "real" red would make a difference but using alcohol is not an option for me. Having done my trial run with this recipe, I would to make it for guests. I also agree that that the extra teaspoon of flour made all the difference.

This dish was outstanding, but I didn't use the shallots, I only had onions, so there was a slight bitter aftertaste, but I seemed to be the only one that noticed it. My family and guests loved it and told me to add it to the general rotation! The sauce was delicious, I used a claret and it was rich and silky, I wish we'd had bread to soak it up, but I did serve it with mashed potatoes, yummm.

Rating: 3
I will make this one again, it was a big hit with my family - they all said "this is a keeper!" I didn't have shallots on hand, so I used onions, next time I'll go with the shallots, and I had barely any thyme, so next time I'm sure it will be a four forker. There just seemed to be a funny aftertaste, and I used a very good wine, so I know it wasn't that. Maybe it was the onions...

This is another old family favorite. I did it again last nite and it was fabulous as usual. I did it exactly like th erecipe - no variations. We often have the sauce left over and it is great in stews and other gravies

This is an exceptional dish. The next time I will only use one cup of red wine and one can of beef broth. I really did not need two cups of each.

We usually purchase a whole beef tenderloin and cut our own filets. This always leaves us large portion of the tenderloin that is too small in width to cut into steaks. I now have a recipe that allows me to cut this piece of meat into medallions and make this delicious recipe. Sauce is fantastic.

Rating: 3
Ohhhh baby! Was this ever good. The sauce was so easy and delicious. I made it exactly as written, and would maybe reduce the shallots by one next time, but other than that, no complaints. The sauce did take longer than noted to reduce, but was well worth the wait.

Rating: 3
Yum! This was a big hit. The sauce was great, although I had to tone down the wine with some sugar. I think tenderloin is too nice a cut because even though it's tasty it's awfully expensive to use for an entree where it will be covered in sauce.

Very tasty. I added carrots and served it over baked potatoes. We ran out of "gravy" though. I should have doubled the "gravy" part of the recipe. We thought the recipe was great and will definately make it again.

We had a dinner party for 8 and made this recipe with filets mignons wrapped in bacon, and added chopped portobella mushrooms to the sauce. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

I made this the other night and it was fabulous. I was a little gun-shy with the wine after reading a few people saying how over-powering it could be, so I cut it down to 1 1/2 cups and used a red table wine that I had in the house. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour as suggested by another cook and took advice to be patient and let the sauce reduce. Other than that, I followed the recipe as directed and we loved it. My Puerto Rican husband demanded white rice (as usual), but it was a great alternative - I poured that wonderful sauce all over it!

Wonderful! We made this for a party of 14 & every single person loved it. We followed the recipie exactly. The full garlic flavor came thru without getting lost or overpowering the flavor of the wine. A winner all around!

This is a solid dish. I would agree that it is a waste to use tenderloin. I used eye round. It was just fine having to cook it a bit slower. I used a cabernet that was good and dry. The sauce is wonderful. It adds a depth to the dish that is very appealing. I cooked with it with roasted potatoes and grilled summer squash. I will make it again.

The reduction sauce was wonderful: I added mushrooms for some interest and served it over linguini. It was fantastic! Be patient with the sauce and let it thicken; makes it cling to the noodles.

YUK!! Now, this could be attributed to the wine I used (burgundy)as it was just plain "too winey". As a Personal Chef cooking this for the first time at a client's, I had to try to save it, but alas recovery was impossible. In the end, Beef Med. in Red Wine Sauce became Beef Meds. with garlic Mash.

This was simply fantastic. I used natural prime filet and added 3 sliced portabellos to the sauce. The reduction can be started ahead of time by sauteeing a few slices of the beef and using the butter for the garlic and shallots. This prevents the beef to be served from sitting since it can be added to the sauce immediately. Definitely strain the sauce before serving. Great for parties. I served 10 and put it together in the time it took to eat the salad.

I thought this was wonderful and so easy to make. I don't cook much at all but tried this and was quite surprised (as was my husband!). I used a good Cabernet and thought it was great. I'll definitely throw some mushrooms in next time though.

The dish turned out to be a fantastic dish! I would agree using a less overpowering wine like a Merlot as the heavier wines will overpower the beef. I added sliced shitake mushrooms to the sauce, and also recommend accompanying this dish with sweet pod beans and roasted potatoes.

This was very easy to make! I added a second tablespoon of flour, strained the shallots and garlic, and added a pound of sliced sauteed mushrooms - the sauce was like silk! My husband, a very fussy customer, really liked it; I'll definitely make it again!

I made this entree for my future parents in law at a large family gathering, and that was the night they first called me their daughter! Wonderful recipe, though I heated the sauce longer than reccommended in order to make the reduction even more rich and savory.

This dish was heavenly! I added wild mushroom (soaked in beef broth) to the reduction. I started the "12-minute" timer AFTER the sauce came to a boil...it reduced down nicely then. However, it was still a little too runny for my taste, so I added 1 tbsp cornstarch to 1 cup beef broth and mixed it in the reduction and let it cook for about 5 minutes. One of the best recipes I've ever made!

This was pretty easy to make (as I'm all about simplicity!) and was SOOOO great! I served it to friends, and they both had 3rds! The sauce was wonderful and I used a merlot, it gave it such a great flavor! Have made it twice in the past month with great success! :)

My two sons girlfriends and I scoured my Bon Appetit magazines for a main dish to serve for Christmas dinner last year. It was their first stab at gourmet cooking and a chance for me to be the supreme example of the most exemplary potential mother-in-law possible. The dish was a success but alas, one of the relationships failed. I passed the recipe on to my daughter and her husband, both stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma who run what I laughingly call an orphanage for homesick soldiers in their home. It was a success there also. I use Merlot and have served it with a rich potato gratin, green salad and rustica bread.

Excellent!!!! Grilled the tenderloin & added two huge portabella mushrooms to the reduction(sliced & sauteed). My Grandma Mabel loved it & had no room for dessert. My Dad liked it so much he ate about a half a cow!!!! Thumbs up. For reduction used a cheap cab.

Rating: 3
The sauce turned out really sour-grapey at first. It seemed like a lot of wine to add, but maybe it was the type of wine I used (Cab. Sauvignon). Either way, I was able to save it with a bit more beef broth and let it reduce down some more, then stirred in a couple dollops of sour cream to mellow the flavors a bit more. Then it turned out all right. I give it three forks and would make it again only because my husband liked it more than I did.

elegant and easy. instead of slicing into medallions i had four 6oz pieces and that turned out very nice as well. i also added a few mushrooms and served some french bread to soak up the sauce. delicious. i will definitely be making this again.

Outstanding! This is the first recipe I turn to when having friends over for dinner. Serve it with buttered noodles or garlic mashed potatoes, if you're a big garlic fan. A full-bodied red wine is a must for this wonderful meal. My friends have loved it, yours will too.

Rating: 3
Good dish - make sure you get high quality tenderloin. Makes the dish just that much more enjoyable. Use a medium - light bodied wine, as a strong wine can overpower the dish. I've made the dish with both noodles and garlic mashed potatoes, and we agree that it was better with potatoes. This dish is so strong flavored that the noodles are completely flavorless.

Sauce took alot longer to reduce than time noted. The sauce is almost too rich. I cut filets in pieces. Definitely need buttered noodles.

To us, this was a waste of good tenderoin, by smothering it in a strong sauce like this. I would recommend making the sauce again, but with a cheaper cut of beef that had been slow cooked, but then I'm not a fan of disguising the delicious flavour of good beef. Canned broth doesn't seem right somehow.

I made this for a romantic dinner for two. Excellent! It is a very easy, but elegant dish with wonderful flavors. I served it with french onion soup, potato onion cakes (also found on epicurious), steamed fresh green beans, and pound cake with raspberry sauce for dessert. (raspberry sauce on epicurious too) The red wine sauce was a bit too salty, but the potato onion cakes were a little bland, so the flavors complimented each other. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This dish was wonderful! I did't really stick to the recipe, I actually borrowed from two very similar Epicurious recipes, Beef Medallions in Red Wine Sauce and Beef Medallions with Cognac Sauce. I used Sherry....and WOW was this delicious. Use a good cut of beef, it really makes a difference, and don't forget to serve with bread to sop up the amazing sauce!
