Flavorful and delicious, not "bland" or even subtle - both sweet and savory, with just the right amount of smoky heat. Don't skimp on the garlic or the reduction time, and let the chipotle simmer for a minute before adding the mussels. Just really, really good.

I made this and everyone raved! Double the chipotles and garlic and trust me it is a winner!

I found this to be very unpleasant. Despite the cacophony of ingredients, it was very bland - a quite tasteless base, with the chipotle striking the wrong note. Would steer you away from this recipe. My guests ate this, but we all preferred the pernod/celery mussels.

Well, after reading the other reviews I thought this might be wonderful - well, I was disappointed. The recipe was a little bland - compared to, for instance, the mussels with pernod recipe. As others said, the mint/cilantro/coconu t milk was a very suttle combination but a little too suttle for me.

Will never make a mussel dish except this again. The flavors really work. Guests rave about this dish. Lucky for us in Oregon we only have to go to the coast at low tide to get all the mussels we want.

very versatile recipe, used it lately as a sauce with shrimp and crabmeat in it, because fresh mussles are hard to get by in the desert, skipping the broth to make it thicker. Great over rice or penne pasta.

I added some shrimp incase my guests didn't like mussels. It was great but no need for shrimp because everyone loved them. I am making them again next week for different guests. This time I am going to add some spicy sausage to the mussels for a change.

Made this with talapia, it was fantastic! The mint and chipoltes were an unusual and great combination.

This recipe is fabulous! I've made it several times for guests, as written, and have received raves every time.

This recipe rocked. Very flavorful. Made the mistake of having chipotle sauce instead of actual chipotles, so i used that, and added some chipotle chile powder as well. Otherwise, made it as is. Very satisfying meal with Avocado/grapefruit salad and french bread.

The mint/chipolte flavor combo was great! Would never have thought to put the two together.

This was an excellent starter dish for the romantic dinner I served to my boyfriend. It was filled with flavor and soooo easy to make! I will definitely make this again! YUM!

We enjoyed a similar dish at Mustard's in the Napa Valley this past winter and I've been trying to duplicate the taste ever since. This comes very close. I think the flavors of some of the ingredients, while bold in themselves, combine to make a very delicate and delicious result.

This was pretty good-as in, my husband and I ate the whole thing ourselves....however, I probably won't make it again. There seemed to be too many flavours (garlic, wine, coconut, onion etc), and they didn't really go together for me. I guess I prefer a richer snd simpler sauce.

This was really good. I make mussels all the time and this was one of the best.Just spicey enough, and not too rich. I made this as an opener to a dinner party and everyone loved them.
