I discovered muesli on a Royal Caribbean cruise last year, and have been craving it ever since! This recipe is delicious, a light and healthy start to the day, and just as good as I remember! My only suggestion would be a little less orange juice, as it gave a definite orangey taste. I also replaced the apples and mixed fruit with strawberries and blueberries - any seasonal or favorite fruits would be a great addition!

I made this a few days ago and am about to make it again. It's SOOOOOO good! I would recommend it especially if you're an athlete for both before and after your workouts. It's just amazing, filling, and YUMMY!

Delicious and easy. Used thick cut oats, prefer a chewy texture.

This made a LOT of food, but it was very tasty, filling and healthy. The orange juice really makes the recipe, and I think it would be great with almond milk, though we made the regular version. It's kind of like cold oatmeal, so mushy, but very flavorful and crunchy with the nuts. Definitely a keeper!

This was absolutely terrible. I ended up throwing most of it away, and I hate to waste food. It just tasted like a big mushy mess. I was so optimistic when I saw the recipes and the reviews. But even though I love all of the ingredients, the finished product was much less than the sum of its parts

I love oatmeal anyway, but this way makes it even better. It's very easy to make, and tasty. Also, you can customize it to the season or your own tastes. I added craisins, currants would be a good alternative as well. The possibilities are endless! Having it in the frig and ready to eat is a big help.

From someone who detest oatmeal, this is my new favorite for breakfast. I love the fact that you can change the fruit with the Seasons. Excellent start to any day.

For anyone using "flavored" yogurt, remember that this is supposed to be a healthy breakfast! Almost all flavored yogurts contain high-fructose corn syrup. Yuck! That kind of blows a hole in the healthy food theory. Go with plain and let the fruit do the flavoring!

Easy, tasty recipe. I tastes a lot better after it sits overnight. This is going to become my go to, weekday breakfast

Delicious & healthy and nice cold alternative to hot oatmeal - it'll be even better in warm weather! I usually mix vanilla yogurt w/ an organic (Baker's forest berry) unsweetened muesli, so this was not too different from that, but was more refreshing w/ the fresh fruit and orange juice. The 1/4 cup of honey made it too sweet for me, so I added more plain yogurt - next time will use less. I tried it w/ cut up navel oranges, blueberries and blackberries ---I think any fruit would be wonderful.

This was very good. Muesli is muesli, but this is a "grate" recipe -- I think the grated apple really makes it. Definitely keeps fine and makes a large amount.

This is our new go-to breakfast receipe. I was skeptical about how long it would keep in the fridge, but last week we doubled the recipe and I ate it every day this week for breakfast & it was still very delicious!!

This was terrific--it really is the perfect muesli, better than any I've purchased. I made about 1/4 of the recipe just for me this morning. The only changes I made were to use roasted instead of raw almonds, and just used an entire unpeeled grated apple as the fruit. I'll try it out on my kids tomorrow.

I was searching for an "overnight oats" recipe, and this was the closest thing I could find. I used vanilla soy milk instead of 2% and omitted the vanilla extract. I also used half the amount of both the honey and OJ because I don't like mine too sweet. I also used raspberries and bananas, which was delicious. Though if you want more texture, I would recommend strawberries or crunchy apples. Enjoy!

Not only delicious, I feel really good about serving this to my family.

This is the best museli recipe EVER. You don't even need to add the chopped fruit to make it delicious, it's perfect on its own. It's quick to whip up in the morning (let the oats sit in the yogurt mixture while squeezing the orange juice and shredding the apple) and tastes unbelievably good. I think this is my new go-to breakfast recipe.

This is a great basic recipe for muesli; the kids love it, it's healthy, what more can you ask for? I'd say it NEEDS to be made at least 8 hours in advance, the flavor & texture are just better. We use a flavored yogurt and fresh fruits like banana, grapes along with dried fruits like raisins.
