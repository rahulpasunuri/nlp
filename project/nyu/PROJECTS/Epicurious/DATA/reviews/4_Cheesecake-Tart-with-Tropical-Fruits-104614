This was totally amazing! I made this for a dinner party and it looked so beautiful and everyone was impressed. The only change was that I used a mixed berry jelly because I could not find either of the jellies that had been suggested, but it turned out really really incredible anyway! I will definitely make this again. It is time consuming, but very very very very worth it!!!!!!!

I only made the pie portion of this recipe (without the topping) because I was looking for something to top with the lemon curd I made from another recipe on Epicurious. So I can only comment on the filling, but it was delicious and got rave reviews from the guests at the dinner party I brought it to. I added lemon zest to the filling but otherwise made it as written. It worked really well with lemon curd on top instead of fruit (though I'm sure the fruit would be delightful too).

This was really, really good. I used a combo of guava paste (on the crust) and mango jam on the filling, both of which were excellent. The presentation is impressive and perfect for entertaining.

I loved this recipe!!! I've made it twice already. Since I was short of time when I first made it, I used the crust of the "mango cheesecake" which was pretty easy to make and it turned out great (not very sweet and crunchy). The feeling is simply heavenly! Instead of kiwis, I used "uchuvas" or gooseberries. I made it a second time, but I made three different coulis (blackberry, passion fruit, and "lulo") and it was wonderful! The sweetness of the filling combined with the three sour coulis was fantastic!

I made this with loads of fresh berries. Very delicious and impressive presentation. A good replacement for the often too heavy NYC cheesecake and not too complicated to make.

This is EXCEPTIONAL and simple! I could not find tropical fruits, so I used canned sliced peaches and apricots, and sliced kiwi for the top, and I used apricot jam for the spread, and I have made this for a few different gatherings and it has been RAVED about by all! If you have not tried making cheesecake before, try this one. It is outstanding, and will definitely be the hit of the party for you. The presentation is so beautiful, everyone will not believe you made it yourself!

This is my husband's favorite dessert. I use light cream cheese and light sour cream to lower the calorie content and use in season fruits. I have made this at least 10 times!!

I made this for a moving away party. We had four desserts and this one was the favorite!! I used the crust for the tropical cheesecake located on this site (gingersnap cookies and toasted macadamia nuts) and added fresh lime juice and lime peel to the tart filling. Instead of papaya, I used fresh pineapple. The result was a light, creamy, tart and very flavorful. I used a 10" springform pan and it came out very easily. This recipe will be in my go-to file. You won't be disappointed!!

this cheesecake tart is exceptional. i have made it four times already. try making individual tarts, using cupcake molds. that way the cheesecake will never crack. this recipe is a treasure. EVERYONE will love it.

Made this dish for a July 4th barbeque. Everyone gave rave reviews. Used strawberries and blueberries, with a strawberry jam instead of the tropical fruits in the recipe. Also used smaller, individual-sized pre-made tart shells for convenience, and still turned out great.

I am making this recipe again today for about the 10th time. It is a winner! With the exception of using whatever fruits I am in the mood for at the time, I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe....just wonderful!

I wasn't as blown away by this recipe as the other reviewers. I thought it was good but not amazing; served it at a dinner party and it didn't get rave reviews. I think it would have been more successful if the guava flavor were more pronouced -- if I were to make it again, I'd try guava paste instead of guava jelly. The jelly was very sweet and mild-flavored, but the paste would give it more punch and contrast of flavors.

I baked the tart for a competition of cakes with fruit at work, and came in #2 (deserved #1!!) I topped the cake with Kiwi, orange filets and pomegrante seeds. It was both beautiful and delicious

This was a hit. Very pretty and fresh presentation. As a time saver, I substituted pre-made graham cracker crust and it was great. Also substituted apple jelly since my area stores don't carry the recommended flavors. This was also fine. Definately will make again.

i have made this tart many, many times and each time it receives amazing raves! i have used both berry-type fruit and tropical fruit as the recipe calls for and both are truly fabulous. a tip for this dessert is to use european-style butter (higher fat content), which makes the crust flaky, tender and buttery tasting. this is truly an exceptional recipe and deserves 10 forks!!

I love this recipe! Instead of making the crust from scratch, I often use the new Golden Oreos and put them in the Cuisinart with a half of stick of melted butter. This is delicious! You can always use different fruits depending what season it is.

Made this tart and topped with glazed fresh strawberries. It held up beautifully, looked fantastic and tasted great. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to add a little more sugar to the filling. I think it was a little less sweet than the cheesecakes I love and am used to.

Made this for the 1st time for Lunar New Year. My picky mother loved it! Will make again. It was hard to roll the dough so it spreads thin evenly, but was still delicious!

I make a lot of cheesecakes, but I really liked this as you get all the flavor of cheesecake but in a lighter package. I made for Christmas dinner in Hawaii, and it was a big hit. Will definately keep this recipe.

Everyone loved this recipe! They ate them up! I also used little tartlet shells. I had to make 1.5 dough recipes to fill 35 tartlets. I refigerated the dough for 2/3rds of them but when I realized that I didn't have enough, I just made more dough and rolled it out immediately. In the end you couldn't tell the difference. I froze the tartlets for about 15 minutes before baking. I topped them with blueberries, raspberries, and mandarin orange slices. They were a real hit!! I am making them again for a baby shower in a week.

I made this recipe but used individual tart shells instead of one tart. It was a HUGH success! Everyone thought that I had bought them from a gourmet bakery!! I topped each tart with a mixture of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries, then glazed the fruit with a mixture of seedless raspberry jam and liqueur. One recipe makes approximately 30 tartlets. I am making these again tomorrow for a housewarming party. They are GREAT!!!

This is now the second time I have made this. I reduced the time for the crust in the freezer to the time it took to heat the oven to 375 degrees after only having left the dough in the fridge for 15 mins before rolling. But if you have the time the more time chilling is safer I am sure. Last time like another reviewer I froze the tart crust after baking and this time am going to freeze it with the cheesecake filling as well (you can buy frozen cheesecakes can't you!). We'll see how that turns out when we eat it in a week. A really good recipe as the tart is perfectly balanced and needs nothing else. Last time the papaya shrunk a bit after sitting in the fridge for a few hours but the other fruits were fine.

I know exactly why this recipe has a 100% rating, it is wonderful. I accidently printed this recipe thinking it was something else I had already made, and never really reviewed it again after printing it. Bought the ingredients, and it wasn't until starting to make the recipe that I realized it was the "wrong" one. Well, what a blessing this "mistake" turned out to be. I made the recipe using strawberry jam and fresh sliced strawberries on the top. It was beautiful and tasted beyond belief. It is the first time that I have made a "cheesecake" that didn't crack on top...maybe because it wasn't too deep...I'm not sure. All I know is that I wish I had made two of them it was so very good. Give it a try, you will not be sorry!

A wonderful, beautiful dessert. I made it for a family dinner. Everyone was going ohhhhhh, ahhhhhhhh and yum! After tasting it, everyone at the Easter dinner raved about the dessert. I used the following fruit - strawberries, mangos, papaya, green grapes, kiwis. Terrific!!

Rating: 4
really good I made the shortbread in my processor and then patted it into a springform pan, baked it, cooled it and did the middle part. I used mangos kiwis and pears (no papayas to be had ) I used a mango passion fruit papaya spread for the topping it was wondeful

Excellent. Made for a party of 25 people. The whole dessert was cleaned up. The crust came out wonderfully. Just the right texture. I used the same combination of fruits, Mango, papaya, kiwi and strawberries. The fruits make this cheese filled dessert really light. A must have recipe

Not too difficult and delicious. This recipe is a keeper. Experiment with different fruits to see which ones you prefer. We like more ripe mango, less papaya and kiwi, with a few strawberries.

My friend Helen and I tried out this recipe after searching the web for the perfect tart recipe. And let me tell ya that of all the tarts I've ever made, this one was easily the best...but then it was also my first =P But seriously, the crust came out flaky, the filling was scrumptious, and the toppings we chose (your typical peach, kiwi, strawberry, etc.) complemented fabulously! We opted not to use our 'Barbadoanese' guava jelly because it looked more like a cell culture plate (ie. dem bacteria was a growin' after having left it in fridge for a few months ;)

This recipe is good for important occations. I thought that it was very delicious. I had a few important people over for dinner, they absolutly loved it. They even wanted seconds some even wanted thirds. Thanks

Great recipe. The flavors of the fruits are a mix of tart and sweet. You only need 1 passion fruit for putting in the middle. I used 1 pkg of reduced fat cream cheese and non-fat sour cream. Can easily be made ahead and a wonderful presentation for company.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I can assure you that guava jelly and cheese are perfect together. I use guava jelly on the top of my New York cheesecakes. I don't think the papaya will do any good for this recipe, hope someone tell me about it. By the way, here in Brazil we mix in the blender papaya, vanilla ice cream and a little bit of "crème de cassis", and it's served at once, with more creme de cassis, it's the best summer dessert EVER, it's delicious.
