I can't rate this recipe as I will never make it, because it's just too complicated, but please, someone, please tell me what is meant by "sprouted whole wheat flour" - I just can't imagine sprouting wheat kernels then turning them into flour - what's the point?

I haven't tried these buns yet, but I have been adjusting other recipes in order to use agave instead of sugar (for my diabetic partner) with varying success. I am writing, however, to assert that we have *never* detected any aftertaste from the raw, organic agave nectar that I have been using.

I would venture to say the bitter after taste is most likely from the agave nectar. This recipe has a huge amount of it in the filling.

I wound up making these in two stages. I made the dough, wrapped in plastic wrap and put into an oversized plastic freezer bag and refrigerated overnight. The following morning I brought to room temperature and continued with the recipe. I also made the filling the day before and refrigerated overnight. The dough was very good, but no mistaking that these were whole wheat and not regular sticky buns. I didn't love the filling either. It was "gloppy" to work with and fair tasting at best. I'm not sure why, but there was a slight bitter aftertaste to these sticky buns. Worth trying once, but I probably won't bother with them again.

No forks, as I have not made it (I cannot believe I am doing it), but isn't it the least appetizing photo on this website. I get the point of food allergies and restrictions, but please do not call it "healthy". There is nothing unhealthy in real butter and milk and eggs. If you want a sticky bun, and you can have it, have the real thing - once in a while, but a real thing!

I made these for Inn guests. I got great complements, even from those who do not like sweets as a general rule saying they seemed "decadent" but we not icky sweet. The dough was very slack and there was almost too much filling. I could have added more flour, but I was hesitant too because I wanted to keep them moist. It was a bit too moist, though. When I first served them about 15 minutes after they came out of the oven, they seemed pretty doughy. Interestingly, they got firmer throughout the day while still maintaining their moist nature. I think next time I will add a bit more flour, roll it out larger so as to incorporate all of the filling, and allow them to "set" a bit before serving. Thanks, Epicurous!

Fradie, I'm with A Cook from Missouri. My husband, in whose family diabetes does not run, was diagnosed two years ago. It is difficult for him to find foods he enjoys, especially sweet breads. I haven't yet tried this recipe; I rated it four forks just from a thorough read-through, but I've made other similar recipes. I'll rate it again once I've made and tasted them. Also, in response to jbackler, you neglected to mention the 5 grams of fiber per serving in this recipe as opposed to ZERO fiber grams in the Pillsbury equivalent.

I cannot wait to make these! For all of us out here who have children with dairy allergies, thank you for offering a recipe that does not include butter, milk, or cream cheese!

If you make these with unsalted butter and (powdered) soy milk, according to myfitnesspal.com, the nutritional info PER SERVING: calories 387 carbs 65g fat 20g protein 8g Or, you could just bake the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls for 400 calories...

This might be a great treat! Where are the nutrition/calories listed?

No rating, because I'll never make 'em. When I want a Sticky Bun, I want a Sticky Bun. And I want it with a big glob of real BUTTER right on top. If I want healthy, I'll eat a carrot with cinnamon and honey!
