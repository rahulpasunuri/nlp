Quick and yummy. Had to substitute fresh ginger for ground, but it worked out nicely.

Meh. Spices were OK, but the yogurt sauce overpowered the delicacy of the salmon and spices. Maybe it was the yogurt, but it was just too tangy. Flavors didn't seem to come together into a pleasing overall taste experience.

Delicious and EASY! so, i didn't have fennel seeds, but i DID have fenugreek, and i thought "hey, sounds similar.." apparently they are 2 very different things, but the product still turned out delicious. also, use a mortar & pestle for grinding if you can, otherwise consider a coffee grinder. this banging the seeds with a gavel thing feels a bit over the top. otherwise, we were very pleased--it looks and feels like high end gourmet cuisine! my husband said we need to make it again if company comes over!

This impressed my wife - and took moments to make - you can actually chop the stuff for yogurt while the fish is cooking. Smells terrific, looks tasty and tastes great. We'll make it again.

The sauce is delicious! I made this for my girlfriend on Valentines day, I paired it with roasted asparagus and pesto penne, both of which were tasty to dip in the left over sauce on the plate. It takes just a little time to prep, but it it very easy to cook. I impressed her with my cooking on this dish, and to be honest I was a little impressed with myself as well!

what a nice recipe for salmon! i used soy yogurt for the sauce (lactose-intolerant). i increased the lime juice in the sauce and was very generous when i squeezed it on the salmon. also, instead of coriander seeds, i brushed the fish with ground coriander and omitted the fennel seeds altogether. my kids liked it and so did my spouse.

My fiancee and I really enjoyed this recipe. The yogurt sauce was very tasty! I tried to crush the seeds the first time I made it, but it didn't work very well. The second time I made it I just used them whole and it turned out just as tasty! This recipe was very quick to prepare. It's a wonderful weeknight dish. I've made it twice and will certainly make it again. I prepared this dish with wild rice and asparagus.

Cooking the salmon was not as easy as I had anticipated. Then again this was probably not the ideal meal for a really really beginner cook. Anyway after it was done cooking the salmon didnt look terribly pretty - a bit burnt and kind of messy. Tasted superb though. I recommend adding a bit more lime juice than the recipe suggests.

This was so easy and delicious. I will definitely be making it again. The sauce was wonderful. I didn't have yogurt, but used plain goat's milk keifer and it worked out well. Next time I'll probably use the plain goat's milk yogurt as I am lactose intollerant, but can tollerate goat's milk. I agree with another review, the cooking time for the salmon was definitely longer than 3 mins per side and I like my salmon very rare. I used wild caught Alaskin salmon.

This was excellent. I used wild salmon. The only thing I would add was that it took *way* longer than 3 mins/side to cook the salmon fillets. I'd say closer to 6 mins/side. I covered the salmon for the last few minutes (skin side down) to hurry the process. Also, next time I might use Greek yogurt or drain plain yogurt for a thicker consistency. I served this with lemony garlic green beans. I will add this to my regular rotation of salmon recipes.

Love this dish! I double the yogurt sauce.

The yogurt sauce has great flavor and could be used on any meat. I am looking forward to trying it on chicken. But it did go very well with salmon. Make this even if you don't want to bother crusting the salmon. It will still be quite good.

This was a very tasty and easy dinner to make. Great week night meal. My husband loved it.

What a yummy, simple recipe! I didn't have any yoghurt so used real (not artificially soured) sour cream instead. Let the sauce sit for at least an hour to develop the flavour.
