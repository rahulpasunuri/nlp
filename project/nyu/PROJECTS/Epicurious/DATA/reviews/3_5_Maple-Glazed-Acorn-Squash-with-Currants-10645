I'm not a maple syrup fan unless its pancakes; so used honey and was very fab! I also used apricots and prunes instead of currants! Was delicious!

This is an excellent and easy way to prepare Acorn Squash. My guy doesn't care for currants so I omit these and it is still very good.

Very tasty. Added the dried cherries as recommended.

Good, but I thought it was dry. Will look for another recipe for future acorn squash dishes.

I don't like currants so used dried cranberries - I made this for easter dinner, and my whole family (22 of us!) loved it. It was such a nice change from the tired old baked squash that gets trotted out all the time. I will make this again and again.

This was easy and delicious and even my picky kids liked it! I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and did not have allspice in the house so instead used a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg and a sprinkle of ginger.

I made this recipe exactly as written for my kids and it was a hit, but I had to tell them that the currants were blueberries so they would try them! My 5 y.o. loved everything about it.

I made this recipe for Thankgiving dinner, and it a smashing hit. As i could not use the oven (the turkey was cooking) I used my Barb-e-que to bake the sqaush. A neat method to cook it.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was delicious and easy. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and I wouldn't change a thing. Makes great leftovers too.

My six year old raved about this squash. Pretty high praise!

Yum! What an easy and delicious dish! I followed the recipe exactly (except that I only made one squash and adjusted measurements accordingly) and we loved it. The currants were great and in all I think I spent about 5 minutes doing prep. Definitely a keeper.

I served this last night as a side dish to the Lemon Tarragon Roast Cornish Hens (also from this site) and was absolutely blown away by the lovely texture and decadent flavor of the squash. My fiancee loved this dish, and he rarely says he loves anything I prepare (he's one of those...)I will definately make this again and try addin some chopped butter toffee walnuts as another reviewer suggested.

I also used dried cranberries (double the amount), and added coarsely chopped butter toffee walnuts which was an excellent addition. The flavor didn't penetrate the squash enough, so next time I'll score the half-baked squash and also add more butter. Also, I used white acorn squash - next time I'll use green for more flavor.

I subbed dried cranberries for the currants and it was delicious. Next time I'll halve the glaze and double the cranberries.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used Becel margerine instead of butter and also used raisins. Will definitely keep this recipe on file.

What a fantastic recipe for a cold autumn night! I used dried cranberries("craisins")instead of currents, which substituted perfectly. We served this alongside a roasted chicken and green salad, and it was truly outstanding. It's a little on the sweet side, but delicious and easy!

My guests enjoyed the sweet squash. I didn't use currants since I didn't have any. If in a hurry you could microwave the squash first.

Obviously this is a pretty sweet way to eat acorn squash. I think a really flavorful squash (organic is always best) doesn't necessarily need all that maple syrup, but it's still delicious and I must admit I finished my half with gusto!!

We really enjoyed these squash. I had golden rasins on hand so I used them in place of the currants and it was delicious. Very easy to prepare. You can even cook through the first 30 minutes and complete later on.

A good recipe for roasted acorn squash. My currants must have been extra dry since they didn't plump much. Next time I will soak them in something first. Otherwise a delicious dish that everyone loved. PS I used half honey and half teacle/golden syrup. Seemed to work if you ask me.
