Reviews of the ice cream recipe say it is bland. It was OK on its own, but very good with the glzed pineapple. I supplemented the ground ginger with some ground up crystallized ginger. I cut the pineapple into wedges then cut each wedge into 3/8" slices so that each piece was coated in brown sugar and it was easier to eat.

The caramelized pineapple, homemade brown sugar ice cream, and the toasted coconut are a great combination. Definitely worth making the homemade ice cream. This dessert comes together very quickly and easily after a meal, since all you have to do is broil the pineapple.

INCREDIBLY easy to make. a nice light dessert too -- since it's mostly just fruit -- but the carmelization, toasted coconut, and sorbet (i used mango) add little bits of complexity to the taste. great for a dinner party since it doesn't need much attention.
