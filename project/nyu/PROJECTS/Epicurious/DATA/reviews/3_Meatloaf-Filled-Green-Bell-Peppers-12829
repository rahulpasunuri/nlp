I made a vegetarian version of this with quorn mince. A 300g package was the right amount for six smallish peppers, and the creamy breadcrumbs really helped the mince stick together (often a problem with quorn mince). The cloves gave it a nice smoky flavour. Definitely a nice alternative to my usual rice or couscous-stuffed peppers.

This was delicious! Made this for my boyfriend so I only made 2 peppers. I used the leftover meat mixture to make awesome meatballs. We both loved it!

This recipe turned out pretty good--but a bit heavy for me. Next time, I will try mixing in some veggies. I really enjoyed the leftovers sliced and used for 'meatloaf/bell pepper,' toasted sandwiches. Those sandwiches added a fork to my rating.

A little rich but very good. I didn't blanch the peppers due to time constraint but they still turned out yummy.

I thought that this was easy and very good. My husband doesn't not care much for green peppers, but he liked these. I sauteed the finely chopped pepper from around the stem with the onions, and substituted nutmeg for cloves. I also used pork sausage instead of plain ground pork. I think if the meatloaf was too "seasoned" it would deter from the flavor of the peppers. I also put fresh parmesan on top the last 15 minutes.

Duh! You used chicken instead of beef and had the nerve to give this recipe 1 fork. No wonder it was bland. This recipe is delicious when you use the the ingredients it calls for!

I thought that this was pretty bland. I used chicken mince instead of beef but I don't think that that change should have effected it that much. I won't make this again.

I've used regular milk instead of heavy cream which reduced the calories without significantly changing the flavor.

With a few variations - this has become a favorite in our house. We use equal parts spicy sausage and beef. Also, I pre-cook the meats. Therefore, after assembling the peppers, they only have to cook for about 20 minutes and I KNOW for sure all ingredients are cooked through.

This was really good. I didn't blanche the peppers (they still were very tender) and omited the ground cloves. I also added oregano and used italian pork sausage, and added cheese the last 5 minutes of baking. I would add a little more cream next time though.

I thought that this was a pretty good stuffed pepper recipe. I omitted the cloves and subsituted pork sausage for ground pork. I also used Italian bread crumbs and added a couple cloves of garlic in with the onions. It might be good to add some cheese on top during the last 15 minutes. One of theses peppers and some yellow rice is a great meal.
