Not too impressed... perhaps because I didn't have enough mint and used only 1 teaspoon. It was much more spinachy than I was expecting.

This unique spread has a great flavor. Don't skimp on the mint, it makes the recipe. I served with Wheat Thins for my cooking group and it received many praises.
