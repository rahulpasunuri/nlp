This isn't far from a French breakfast treat, thinly sliced radishes on heavily buttered bread--not an uncommon combination! I say this only in support of this fun snack. Love it!

I had to join epicurious to respond to dmcpdc's minor bash of Clinton. This may not be a complex recipe, but it's a great reminder t's reminder that simple things can be wonderful. Some of us grew up with these 'treats' -- in fact they were my mom's favorite. The butter does have a purpose, it tempers the heat of the radish. And if you want fancy, use some finishing salt instead of table salt or kosher salt. Nom. Thanks Clinton!

Clinton, I love you on What Not To Wear and think you are the height of style and sophistication. However, my admiration for your sweaters got in the way of my good cooking sense when I made these radishes. They were pretty. That's all. Radishes and butter and kosher salt? I might like one with a vodka martini, but only if it is ice cold (and they are not after sitting on the cocktail table for 10 minutes). Don't bother. I still love you, Clinton.
