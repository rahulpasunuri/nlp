We were very disappointed with this dish. My husband found the mango relish disgusting and inedible. I've tried hundreds of recipes from this website, and this was the worst recipe so far.

Perfect meal for a summer's day.

This was good--I'd have given it 2.5 forks if I could have. It was pretty simple to make.

Ugh! Guess I'm just not a fan of nuoc mam--way too fishy and overpowering. I much prefer the mango salsa's that are hot and sweet, not sour. Sorry! LOVE THIS SITE!

For someone who doesn't do to well with fish I thought this was easy and pretty tasty. My husband thought it was great too and he is a pretty picky eater. Loved the mango relish.

We did not have Mahimahi, so we used Talipia. I would have liked it to be more hot, but it was delicious. I'll use more chilies next time. And the mango was better blended than cut in big cubes.

I love seafood and the combination of mangoes and mahimahi was excellent.

This is really good. Very easy for a weeknight dinner. I think the relish would be good with any kind of fish. I'll probably try it with salmon next. I used two serrano chiles, seeds and all, and it was just zippy enough.

More like 2.5 forks. I made the recipe as written and didn't find it hot or sour enough for my taste. Maybe I didn't use the right kind of chile? They're never marked properly at the store. The relish mostly tasted like mango. It was very easy, though. I will make this again, but next time I'll add more chile and probably some rice wine vinegar to give it a little more of a sour taste.

I cut the mango into a small dice to create more of a sauce than a relish, and then added about 1 1/2 tbsp of mirin sauce along the way. Everyone loved it. This sauce would work over any white fish and possibly chicken too.

delish and easy to make. organically grown mango makes a huge difference. also, used 1 freshly squeezed lime, which enhances the flavors of the mango. served with basmati rice, this is definitely a very tasty dish.
