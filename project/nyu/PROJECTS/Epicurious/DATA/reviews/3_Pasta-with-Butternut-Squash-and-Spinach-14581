I didn't rate this -- because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. But what I did make turned out fabulous ... I had a carnival squash -- so I roasted that in a 400 degree oven (cut in half, drizzled with olive oil and some sea salt) for 45 minutes. Scooped out the squash and kind of mashed it up -- and then sauteed with a small shallot. Followed the rest of the recipe as written.

I liked this recipe and thought the favors were fine although I also added one chopped leek to the squash as it cooked. I also used fresh egg noodles instead of dry spirals. I will absolutely make it again.

The recipe is missing something...herbs! I added thyme and cayenne and it was great. I think sage would also well too. I have made variations of this many times and find it easy and tasty as a base recipe. Other changes I have made: butter instead of olive oil, extra garlic, balsamic vinegar instead of lemon, and cooking the squash in chicken stock (there are little 8 oz containers at trader joe's)

I agree with other posters who found this bland. I made many of the suggestions to increase/deepen flavor but still was not very flavorful. Noone in the family liked it. I increased garlic, added leeks, used vegetable broth instead of water, and added toasted pine nuts. Once I tasted it, I even added a little blue cheese, which helped but still won't make it again.

This is one of those recipes that is pretty good if you tweak it a bit. Spinach and onion pair so well with cheese, that you kind have to saute a large onion along with the squash, maybe with a little extra olive oil and some basil. A quarter to a half cup of chicken broth deepens the flavor of the squash if you use that instead of pasta water. I tossed in frozen spinach after the squash was already pretty well cooked (but not too soft!) Then if you also happen to have a little bit of extra mozarella lying around to toss in with the parmesan while your mixing in the pasta... Everyone likes this, including the kids. This is a tasty, healthy, and fast dinner (extra fast if you use frozen spinach) that includes your greens.

I used acorn squash instead of butternut squash, and it was fine. I might cut the pieces of squash up smaller next time. I loved the way the spinach coated the pasta. The parmesan paired really well with the other flavors.

It was okay, next time i will add a bit more spinach and squash, I used whole wheat pasta and chicken broth instead of cooking water. It was decent.

I didn't care for this. Texture was mushy, taste just ok. Also, roasted the squash and had high hopes. Definitely wouldn't make this one again.

Three stars as is, three & a half w/ the modifications I made the second time around: added some leftover chicken, some dried red pepper flakes, and feta cheese instead of parmesan. Yum!

I baked the squash ahead of time and added it to the sauteed spinach. I added some toasted squash seeds for texture and crumbled gorgonzola on top. It was good but not amazing.

I have made this dish several times and enjoyed it, but I found myself modifying it as it can be a bit dry and bland. I now use whole wheat pasta and increase the olive oil to 4 tbsp and the lemon juice to 1.5 tbsp. I also add a couple of tbsp of lightly toasted pine nuts. The additional liquid, flavor, and texture improves the dish greatly.

I added about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper to liven it up as the recipe looked to need it. It worked out well. Also, used asiago as I was out of parmesan which surely gave it a different flavor.

Needed to use up leftover squash that had been cut in half and baked with a little bit of brown sugar. This recipe was a delight, and with baked squash, all I had to do was scoop it into the pot--no peeling or cutting.

We made this dish for the first time for guests coming over and were extremely disappointed. It was bland, and we made a further mistake by using whole-wheat pasta that completely overcame the flavor. The butternut/spinach combination is interesting, but the flavor is too delicate and gets lost.

This dish is fabulous. I dont get the bland part. Use plenty of salt and pepper and ad it in stages to layer the seasoning. The squash, spinach, garlic, and lemon juice are perfect together. The cheese brings it all together. The dish sounds strange, but give it a try you will be suprided.

Was looking foward to this but was extremely disappointed. I did increase the garlic, added shallots and more cheese. Even so, I thought it was lacking good flavor. Oh well..........

I was prepared for bland so ...I upped the fresh parmesan cheese, added some asiago, sauteed the spinach separately with the garlic, cut the squash into small chunks, used vegetable broth, and it turned out really well. We were able to taste everything and found that squash was not overwhelming in flavor. It looked pretty - very autumnal. Getting the really good cheeses is the key, I think.

I have always been quite pleased with this recipie (made it a few times now). I just wish the prep work didn't take quite so long (working with the quash). The previous reviewers suggestion to saute the spinach separately with garlic very briefly and add last looks good, I'll try that next time.

This recipe was a big disappointment! I love all the ingredients involved, but I found it rather dry and bland!The dish was overwhelmed by the squash which should have been cut in much smaller pieces.I would not make this again.

I had never tried butternut squash before, but now I realize I don't care for it much. Based on the reviews, I was expecting to be wowed by the fusion of flavors, but it turned out pretty bland. What you see is what you get. I used whole wheat pasta and chicken broth as suggested too. I love that it's healthy, but I know my husband would hate it (I made it while he was out-of-town). You can make it a little more palatable by upping the salt or parmesan.

My husband and I very much liked the flavors of this dish (although it could be augmented somewhat -- I like the suggestion of blue cheese and pine nuts, or perhaps a little cayenne wouldn't be out of place). I found the spinach overcooked and stringy, however; I'd recommend sauteing the spinach with some garlic separately, and serving it on top of the pasta so as to preserve its consistency.

This was a great dish which I had all ingredients on hand to make. I read all previous comments and went with adding chicken broth vs. pasta water, added just a bit of blue cheese and toasted pine nuts. Delish!! I never restle with the butternut squash anymore, just roast it in the oven for 25 min and then cut cubes. Nice veggie meal.

This is an excellent recipe. I tripled the recipe to serve six peope -vegetarians and non-vegetarians and everyone asked for seconds. This is definitely something I'll make again. Thanks for the idea of adding walnuts.

This was very good,very easy and filling,I added more lemon juice and black pepper and I couldn't stop eating it. Next time I'll use whole wheat pasta as other reviewer suggested. Try it!!!.

This was very easy and very tasty. The "bang for your buck," though, does come from high quality olive oil and parmesan. I'm wondering if it will work out as well if I use dandelion greens in place of spinach. Any thoughts?

I served this for company and everyone but one person raved. I was surprised with one of my guests who really isn't into squash. He couldn't stop talking about how good this meal was. I used chicken broth instead of water and it worked beautifully. The parmesan cheese finished the meal well. I also used whole wheat pasta. This is a great low fat recipe.

I made this the other night when I had some squash and spinach that I needed to use. I really love butternut squash and spinach and they work really well together with the parmesan. I also used chicken broth instead of water at the end. My meat-eating husband thought it was just "ok", but I would definetely make it again for myself.

Delicious! I used whole wheat pasta, and took advice of adding 1/2 cup vegetable broth instead of the water. With regards to the cheese; I added 2ounces (about 60g)of goat cheese and the regular amount of parmesean. The squash was wonderful; much more than I expected, especially with the spinach. Great recipe, and will make again soon!

I modified this recipe by adding chicken stock instead of pasta water and I added 4oz goat cheese instead of parm. When blended in, it gave it a nice, creamy taste that we really enjoyed. We both really liked it and my husband isn't even a squash fan. I'll definitely make again this way.

Very good recipe. My family loved it. I made it just as the recipe called for the first time. The second time, I added some roasted red pepper because I had some that I needed to use. This was a nice addition. For the record, I disagree completely with the cook who says that most recipes on this site are mediocre. I use many recipes I get from here and have run across very few that are only so-so.

As with most recipes on here, this one is mediocre. It lacks depth and complexity of flavor. I would cut the squash into tiny pieces and saute them in butter rather than olive oil to add richness. Then, instead of using the pasta water, I would use chicken stock. This might go up to a three then.

Very quick, very easy. I used blue cheese instead of the parmasean-delicious.

I baked the squash by cutting it in half and putting it face down. I used 1/2 of the squash for another recipe. I then cubed the squash and only put it in the dish to warm it after sauteeing the garlic and right before adding the spinach. I added pine nuts. Loved it -- light and delicious.

I combined tips from the cook in Chicago (6/22/99) and added my own changes: I used gemelli. Added salt and pepper when sauteed squash. Sauteed the garlic in at the last 30 seconds of cooking the squash, just until it got fragrant, then added the spinach. Stirred in 1/4 cup lightly toasted pine nuts just before adding in the drained pasta. Omitted the lemon juice. Removed the completed dish from the heat and tossed in 2 tablespoons of a very flavorful Balsamic vinaigrette (2 parts olive oil to 1 part Balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard and salt and pepper). Sprinkled with Parmesan just before serving. Delicious!

This recipe reminded me of a salad that is made at Corner Bakery in Chicago. I used gemelli pasta and feta cheese instead of the parmesan. It's great hot or cold. The second time I made it, I omitted the lemon juice and after it cooled, tossed it with a balsamic vinaigrette and served it as a cold salad. Next time, I'm going to add pine nuts.

A tip: I blanched the squash for a few minutes to make it easier to peel. The sweetness of the Butternut Squash is a little overwhelming when it is in such large pieces. I pureed some of the pieces together with some milk, which made a nice sauce. If I make it again I'd use about 1/2 the amount of squash and puree it all.
