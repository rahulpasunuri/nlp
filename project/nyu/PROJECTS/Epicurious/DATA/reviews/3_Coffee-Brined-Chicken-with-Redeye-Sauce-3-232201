Did not care for this recipe and will not add it to my collection. The brine really didn't add anything and made the chiken breasts way too salty. I have more luck simply seasoning chicken breats and grilling them super hot, then turning down heat until they are cooked through covering with lid to hold in moisture. The sauce was WAY WAY too sweet. I ended up adding more vinegar, more coffee and vermouth to try to salvage. Was pretty tasty on rice after all of that, but I won't make again. Too many other options out there!

We really liked this recipe, especially the sauce. Next time I'll half the salt for the brine, and double the amount of sauce, which I reduced a bit too much, perhaps. Otherwise, a great summer recipe. Pairs great with a red cabbage slaw and some fresh-squeezed lemonade.

I loved this recipe soooo much i am going to make it a favorite. I did change up a few things: 1. I brined the chicken overnight. 2. I parboiled the chicken in the brine plus i added to cover the chicken in water adding a little maple syrup and another cup of espresso and sprinkled a little franks red hot in there. 3. i grilled the chicken by brushing melted butter on the outside for 99% of the grilling time. at the very end i brushed on the redeye sauce a couple of times. 4. as the big amish chicken wings were the fave- i think i will make it a wing-only recipe.

To the cook in California--I haven't tried this recipe but I believe the "Redeye" sauce is the espresso flavored mustard bbq sauce. It's confusingly worded, though.

Made this per the recipe and it was quite good. Kids liked it too, somewhat surprisingly as the sauce is "tangy!". I agree w/ previous reviewer that the seeds/peppercorns were a waste of good spices in the brine. Also, if the recipe author is going to "propose serving the chicken with an express- flavored mustard bbq sauce" why not include the recipe for that? Last I checked there was nothing answering that description at Safeway...

Brine always makes chicken or pork more moist, but I don't think the spices in this brine are necessary. Next time I would just use the salt, sugar, & espresso. The sauce was easy, fun and interesting. I am going to use this for thick pork chops for the grill too. Try it.

A little skeptical about it when I first read it, but thought it would be interesting. I was wrong... it was pretty spectacular and very easy. A new take on grilled chicken! Will absolutely make it again.
