Really good. I won't put in the olives next time. Too salty. Fantastic dressing.

I made this salad about five years ago and just thought about it again. I made this salad twice in one week. The first time I had the mushrooms raw as per the recipe. The second time I decided to saute them. It made all the difference in the salad. I love this salad. Am making it again this week.

We wanted to love this, but found that it was just okay. The dressing was fantastic, but I think it needed to go with a different set of salad ingredients. Maybe it needs homemade croutons or something crunchy for texture. The raw mushrooms were just not right for this salad. I would make the dressing again, but put it with spinach, bacon, fried crispy shallots, avocado (or nuts) and croutons.

This salad was awesome! I'd bought spinach and mushrooms and bacon on sale, so was looking for a recipe that would use them. This was great! I love all sorts of spinach salad, but this one was special. The cheese and cream in the dijon vinaigrette was a great idea that would not have occurred to me. I used raw honey and subbed Pinot Grigio for normal white wine vinegar, but followed it to the letter otherwise. One caution: the bacon and olives should give you pause when seasoning the vinaigrette "to taste" because those two ingredients are already pretty darn salty.

I made this for a dinner party recently and it was a hugh hit! I did alter it a bit. I used mini bellas for the mushrooms and skipped the olives. Instead of Gorgonzola I used feta as suggested by a few people. In addition I needed to add a bit more honey as the dressing tasted too much like vinegar for my liking. Everyone loved it and I will make it again! Next time I am going to use the gorgonzola to compare wiht the feta.

Our whole family enjoyed this salad. It is quite thick, but no one minded and the flavors are a nice combination. We are not all big fans of blue cheese either. The only alteration I made was reducing the cheese to 1 1/2 cups.

I am not a big fan of Blue Cheese but I thought this salad was delish! I will be making this again!

This was tasty and everyone I served it to at my dinner really liked it. I enjoyed it as well but not enough to want to make again.The dressing was just a bit too rich for my tastes. One caution: my kitchen smelled awful while that gorgonzola was melting in the pan! whew!

Not as good as I hoped it would be.Definitely not even in the top ten of my favorite spinach salads. The dressing was too tart and way to thick. Next time I would reduce the amount of Gorgonzola (and I love gorgonzola!). I recommend trying it out first before serving it for a dinner party. It wasn't horrible or anything, just a little off...Good in theory, but definitely needs tweaking.

Everyone went crazy for this salad! I made a couple of changes. I cooked the bacon ahead of time. I sauteed the mushrooms, and set aside. I then added the bacon, mixture, etc. to the mushroom jus rather than bacon fat. So yummy!

Delicious? Yes! Heart clogging? Yes! Sometimes you have to splurge.

A wonderful combination, the salad has bold flavors that would overpower delicate entrees. I served it with lamb patties and yoghurt and mint sauce, fresh asparagus, and couscous with apricot chutney. I omitted bacon and cream but added bacon drippings and roasted pine nuts. For 1/4 of the recipe I used half the amount of mustard specified. The dressing just barely coated the greens. I'll make this often. It's delicious!

I was impressed by the complexity of flavors this salad brings to the table so to speak. The only thing I changed was I sauteed the mushroom instead of keeping them raw. Everyone loved this salad, will be making it again.

Dressing for the more refined palate! Gorgonzola is a wonderful strong flavored/scented cheese; if you do not enjoy it you won't enjoy the dressing. If you do, this is the salad for you. Every time I make it, my family/guests are lapping up everything on their plate with the dressing, not only the salad. Two hints: your choice of mustard will make or break the recipe (get the good stuff) and use hard, crumbled gorgonzola; the softer gorgonzola tends to be richer and more overpowering. The strong salted olives perfectly compliment the flavor of the cheese. The recipe can be done without bacon, just add a touch more vinegar/mustard to get the right consistency. It is a sinful salad and everyone I've served it to has raved and demanded the recipe. Enjoy!

Wonderful salad, rave reviews from everyone. I'm not a big fan of gorgonzola so I substituted feta. Also added roasted red peppers and toasted pine nuts.

Wow, this was bad. This may be the first bad review I've ever left here on E. The recipe sounded great, but in retrospect, I should have seen it....Kalmata's and Gorganzola? YUCK. I can see gorganzola with green olives (great in martini's!), but not with kalmata's. The dressing was way to over powering. I used all excellent ingredients, including $7 for a small chunk of Mountain Gorganzola. Sum it up in one word - disappointing.

This is a wonderfully rich salad. I love the warm dressing. Easy to whip up. Has become a famiily favorite. Can easily be mixed up to take to friends home. Take the bowl with the ingredients and have the dressing in a container that can be easily heated in microwave before serving. EXCELLENT!

This is a delicious salad which I will be making frequently.

For me, the key to a good salad is to take something low-fat and put a lot of fatty things on top of it. This certainly fits the bill. Every time I serve it, somebody asks for the recipe. Delicious.

I first read this recipe years ago and have been making it ever since. I have a lobster party every year and always serve this salad. My guest call ahead just to make sure I am going to make it. This one is a winner!

Very tasty and obviously very rich - indulgent way to have spinach when you have an abundance.

This salad was wonderful. I used roquefort cheese and the salt in the cheese was fine, but I would omit the olives if using roquefort again. I added sprouts and sesame seeds.

Did anyone else think that the recipe called for too much gorgonzola? I thougt the olives, bacon, and mushrooms over spinach were tasty, but the dressing was too thick and not tart enough for my taste,

I used the same amount of dressing (made with extra honey, yellow mustard instead of dijon, and fat-free half & half instead of heavy cream), but half the amount of spinach (only 1 bag in all). Since it was Christmas, and I wanted things to be a little nicer, I used sliced portabellas instead of white mushrooms, and sauteed them in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, then cut them bite-size. I don't like olives or bacon, so added other ingredients, thinking primarily about color and texture instead. I first layered the spinach on a platter, then topped with the portabellas, then with thinly sliced yellow bell peppers (1 in all), then with half a bag of dried cranberries. The dressing I poured over all just before serving--it was a beautiful and delicious start to our Christmas dinner, and by far the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. Definitely try it with the portabellas.

I used balsamic vinegar, only 1 tablespoon of honey and only 1 cup of blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. We had no olives, so I used toasted pecans. It was delicious, and I can foresee many variations on this theme.

Had this salad many times at the resturaunt and before I was able to get the recipe I tried to put it together myself and it was good.But now that I actually have the recipe I will be making it often for me and my friends.MMMM Good!!!

This was a very easy recipe to make that was very tasty and comes off as very elegant for dinner guests. I couldn't find pitted greek olives, so I used pimento stuffed green olives. The pimento's added a nice dash of color. An extra bonus was discovered by accident. The refrigerated leftover dressing made a great cracker spread! Now I double the dressing recipe to ensure leftovers!

This was the best! Not your run of the mill spinach salad. I halved the recipe for three of us and it was perfect. This is definitly a keeper.

This was a very delicious spinach salad - not your run of the mill with the addition of olives -and the gorgonzola dressing served warm over it was wonderful!

I was disappointed with this salad as the reviews were all good. Perhaps it was the fact of the warm dressing. I love gorgonzola and use it in salads frequently. Guess I will be sticking to cold chilled greens from now on

Valentine Dinner: Loved it. Second time tried non-fat milk instead of cream; consistency was lost. We cut out more fat by omitting the bacon drippings. Used lean turkey bacon, which was ok. Still love this recipe. So Easy to make! How can I thicken the sauce if I skip the cream? Suggestions?

This was easy and very tasty. I used very lean turkey bacon which was delicious, but didn't give any drippings at all. I used a littl olive oil to crisp the bacon and then used 1 T olive oil for the dressing.

I thought this was one of the best salads I've ever made. I have brought it to two dinner parties and both times everyone raved! This recipe makes a lot of dressing, I did not use it all- would have drowned the salad.

This is a great starter salad to serve with a light pasta dish. I omitted the olives and bacon and added chopped toasted walnuts to give the salad some texture - the subsitution worked wonderfully.
