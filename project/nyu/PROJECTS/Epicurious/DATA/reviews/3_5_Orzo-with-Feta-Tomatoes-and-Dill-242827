This was delicious! I love the fresh dill and juicy cherry tomato combo with the creamy orzo. Yum.

I've made this recipe twice in the last week. The only change I make to this recipe is to add the juice of one lemon to the pasta. Otherwise it gets a bit dry. It's such a wonderful, refreshing salad for summer!

has a Greek taste to it. I recommend putting a little extra zest.

AMAZING! SO EASY & FRESH! Loved the lemon and the explosion of cherry tomatoes in your mouth! My 9yr old calls this one of his favorites :)

Easy and really tasty. I doubled the lemon (essentially the zest of one large lemon) and we found all the flavors very nicely balanced. Will definitely do this again with all the cherry tomatoes and dill our garden is producing!

I thought this was excellent & very refreshing. I made it with the Epicurious Lamb Chops with Lemon, and Epicurious Tsatsiki with whole wheat pita. One of the best meals I've ever had - seriously, and that's saying a lot.

Last I made this with this chicken breast recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chicken-Breasts-with-Tomato-Herb-Pan-Sauce-366432 Great combination. I used a bit more Orzo than in the recipe. The flavors of the lemon zest, dill, and feta blend perfectly to form a refreshing zing.

First of all, this dish looked so pretty and was practically effortless to make. The only thing that takes time is allowing the orzo to cook, which takes less time than pasta. This dish is also very delicious and the final product/taste look deceptively labor intensive. Two things to note: definitely add much more orzo as there is a large amount of tomato and olive oil for the amount of orzo the recipe calls for and adding more extends the dish. Also, I used about a tablespoon of dried dill from a spice bottle rather than fresh dill. It still tasted great and 1 tablespoon was a great substitute if more orzo is added. The red of the tomatoes and green of the dill makes this a very festive dish for christmas, if good tomatoes could be procured.

Very refreshing and tasty. Served with the Grilled Jumbo Shrimp with Lemon and Oregano. Would be great for a large gathering, easy and fresh. I did add some fresh lemon juice to the dressing and let the orzo cool before adding the cheese. I might try with some greek olives and oregano replacing the dill for something different, but will make again.

My husband made this dish for me on our second date. It is my GO TO dish for parties and wins every time! We use a mustard vinaigrette instead of just olive oil. We mix yellow mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, honey, salt and pepper to taste... wah la! It's so good. This dish is good warmed or chilled.

I made this one for dinner today as i did not have enough time to go for something more complex - the taste is amazing for the amount of effort it requires (prep time 20min!!), really good taste, love how it felt fresh - must be those juicy tomatos! Only change i made was adding a bit of lemon juice :P

This recipe is one of my husband's faves. One thing the recipe doesn't say and I think is important: let the orzo cool completely before assembling the dish. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins. http://recipes-that-worked.blogspot.com

I have made this recipe as written and it is quite good. I have also made changes that include: Substituting couscous for the orzo. Adding cucumber and red onion. Adding 1 tbs balsamic vinegar. Any way you make it, it is a nice summer side dish.

As a side dish, I think this recipe is ok. It's kind of bland, so I think of it as "rice" or "bread." I probably needed to add more salt. It's quite healthy and easy to make for large parties.

I used marinated chevre from Whole Foods instead of feta, and it was fast and delicious!

I've made this dish several times - for ourselves as well as for group meetings, potlucks, etc. It always gets great reviews, and is a nice tasty, but not heavy, dish and easy to make, take, and serve.

This was excellent, and really good as leftovers. I used the full amount of dill called for and thought it was perfect. I also didn't notice the lemon zest as much as some of the other reviews suggested.

Delicious! I added half an English cucumber and a small amount of red onion, as well as radishes and balsamic vinegar. Full of flavor and crunch!

This dish tasted like lemon cake with lemon frosting. Usually that would be a good thing....for dessert, not for dinner/dinner side. Make lemon cake instead of this dish!

Rating: 2
I thought the dill was a little overpowering to the rest of the dish and that it took away from some of the other flavors. I'd definitely use less next time even though I love dill! The recipe is easy to make and looks great on the plate and I'd definitely make it again as a quick, tasty side. Just half the dill though...

Fantastic! Can't stop nibbling it and it is supposed to be for dinner tonight. Not sure it will make it that far. Made recipe as-is. Love it.

This was a great recipe but I jazzed it up based on some of the feedback. Rather than 3 tablespoons of olive oil, I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of basalmic vinegar. It was really flavorful and perfect for a summer night.

Okay, I sure didn't want this to taste like a lemon cake or any other pastry as someone scared me below. . . nonetheless, we thought this was refreshing, tasty and went very well with the oregano grilled shrimp - as these 2 recipes are mediterranean-like. Oh yea - I did change it up only because I didn't have enough dill or any feta. Used about TWO tsp of finely grated fluffy lemon zest; about 1/4 cup chopped dill; roasted the cherry tomatoes in olive oil, kosher salt and pepper first. Even used a bit of the roasted tomato juice from the pan and mixed it in. And since the oven was on from roasting the tomatoes, I toasted some pinenuts to roll in at the end. Was yummy even without the cheese.

I can't say I was too wild about the dill, but the rest of it was good. It disappeared quickly at the party I took it too.

This was weird. Not bad, but weird because of the lemon. Don't get me wrong: I love Greek food, and I like lemon...dill's cool too -- but for some reason the lemon seemed to conflict with the tomato and dill in this dish. The lemon screamed, "Mom's birthday cake!" at me (and yes, I used exactly the amount it called for in the recipe), and the dill was kind of overpowering. I thanked my lucky stars for the tomatoes, otherwise I don't know if I could have eaten what I cooked. It kind of grows on you, though -- enough to make it "finishable" but not necessarily "re-make-able".

Loved this with some grilled shrimp. Very light though...my partner felt it was more of a summer dish

Great side dish, especially on a summer night, but any time really. It is light, flavorful and refreshing. Added a few pitted calamata olives which was a nice addition. Served with grilled lamb chops and grilled flatbread. Wonderful meal.

The flavours in this are great together, however, it does not go with the grilled oregano shrimp. They clash visually on the plate. But it's great with pork tenderloin or pork chops, and is very easy to make.

This is such an easy a wonderful dish. I make it all the time and frequently add shredded rotisserie chicken to it. It's sooo refreshing and full of flavor!

Very good. I enjoyed this fresh one day and enjoyed it even more the next day when the flavors had a chance to mingle. I like it as it is, but I might add some tuna next time for a complete meal. Easy, breezy to make.

Tasted great! Eating it right now actually! However, as someone who is conscious of serving size and daily calorie & nutritional intake, it would have been convenient to have the serving size and nutritional analysis available.

This was an excellent dish, but I found it to be a little too salty. I liked it better using just the salted water, and not adding any salt. A little crushed garlic also added a nice kick.

This is a great side dish! I didn't have any orzo so I made it with whole wheat rotini pasta. After I finished making it, I let it sit in the refrigerator for 2 hrs to let it set into the pasta itself (wheat pasta takes a while to take on flavors). This was a huge hit within the household and def on my list to make again. I loved the dill and feta together. Never realized they went well together!

I would use less dill the next time I make this dish but besides that it was great. I recommend serving with grilled salmon.

I really liked this dish a lot. I found out during dinner that more than half of my guests don't like dill, though, so that was a bummer. Those who like dill raved about this dish. I made as directed, except I used only about 4oz of feta-- that seemed plenty, even for me, and I LOVE feta. Don't skip the lemon zest, and don't overcook the orzo (I had to start over b/c I left it on WAY too long). This will be a staple for me, just not with that particular non-dill- loving group.

I love this. It has become one of my standards. I add browned tofu and roasted zuchinni & summer squash to make it a good veggitarian meal.

Super easy & great tasting! Brought to a BBQ and everyone raved! I would suggest using Bulgarian or French feta, Greek can be a bit overpowering.

I loved this receipe and found it to be quite refreshing. I thought it needed more bite to it and added the zest of an entire lemon along with 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. I also added a couple tablespoons of chopped cilantro. Everyone loved this.

Not only did I love this the first time...I substituted the feta for grated parmesan two weeks later for even better reviews. I am however a dill fan.

We thought this was very tasty and it went really well with some grilled salmon. Best quality summer cherry tomatoes and godd feta and olive oil work well with the dill,lemon zest and orzo. Season to your own personal taste!!

After reading the reviews, I used only half of the dill. I tried this dish before I put in the feta. It was soo good! I loved it. After I put in the feta, I was so disappointed. It completely changed the flavors. I was so mad I had messed up something so good. I love feta, but not in this dish.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect! The flavors are amazing together! I will certainly be making this one again and again!

I am shocked to see so many poor reviews of this! We loved this dish - bright and flavorful and definitely a unique use of dill. We will add this to our summer recipe box. I don't cook exactly according to the recipes, rather, just add until I think it looks or tastes good, so I'm not sure how much dill or feta I used - but the result was a perfect summer dish. Experiment, follow your gut, and enjoy!

I usually don't like pasta salad, but I liked this. I didn't have any dill, and maybe that was a good thing according to the other reviewers. I had very, very good cherry tomatoes from my own garden, and maybe that carried it. I used low fat feta which tasted fine.

The dill was overpowering. I would probably not make this again.

I followed the recipe and loved the result - not too much of anything, and the flavors blended nicely. I happen to love both dill and feta cheese... I made this to accompany the grilled shrimp with oregano and red onions. It made for a delightful summer meal: light but full of flavor.

After making this once I halved the amount of feta cheese, and was much happier with the result. I do NOT think this is as good the next day; the dill flavor is really overpowering. Good thing the recipe halves easily.

This salad was terrible. All the ingredients seemed to stand alone instead of mix together in your mouth, especially the lemon zest. Overall it was bland and a waste of good ingredients used better in other recipes.

I absolutely loved this recipe... as did everyone else who was over for dinner. My husband tends to make his pasta rather salty, but we both enjoyed how simple and fresh this dish was. We paired the orzo with steamed asparagus and grilled chicken sausage (for a side of saltiness). YUMMY! *also tastes great cold the next day!

I used about 1/3 less dill, it was just too much, and extra orzo for a main dish. also threw in some thinly sliced sopressata. Would be great cold too.

I didn't enjoy this particularly... it was nothing special. The fact I'm not the biggest fan of dill probably didn't help, because its powerful flavour comes through quite strongly in this dish.

This is super easy and delicious. I made the recipe exactly as is and served it room temp with grilled salmon, grilled vegetables and a good bread. It was perfect and delicious. I will definitely make this again.
