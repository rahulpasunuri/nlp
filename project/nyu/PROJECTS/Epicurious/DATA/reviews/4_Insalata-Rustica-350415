I've made this, exactly as written, a number of times as a part of a large Italian meal. EVERY time, my family MmmMmMms loudly, proclaiming it to be the best salad they've ever had. It really is lovely, and perfectly balanced as is. The roasted grapes and proscuitto really take it over the top - it could practically be a main course.

One of my favourites now! Absolutely mouthwatering. All the different tastes and textures mix together wonderfully. Try it!

This is a wonderful salad even though I felt it was a bit labor intensive due to all the separate steps. However, because of the unique flavors and combination of ingredients it was well worth it. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using a pear infused aged balsamic over the top. I will definitely make this again. Try it, you will love it!

This salad tasted unique and flavorful. I like to have a salad for dinner at least a couple of times a week, and this was very tasty and filling. It was kind of expensive with the prosciutto and pine nuts so I might not make it too often, though.

I made the salad as closely as possible to the recipe but I forgot to pick up the pears and I forgot to drizzle the balsamic. The salad was FANTASTIC!!! The combination of textures and the salty and sweet kept everyone coming back for more. A keeper for sure! I made this last weekend for guests, and will be making it again, for guests, for the next two weekends!!!

Great salad. Served as a starter to a beautiful Italian Timpano. I prepared the salad per the recipe, including the cherries that some other reviewers omitted. I love the idea of layering the flavors, starting with the simple EVOO & Lemon juice dressing, then ending with a drizzle of balsamic. Yum! We served the salad with a bottle of 2008 Jose's Rose from Joeseph Swan Vineyards, Russian River Valley. It was perfect.

I didn't have the cherries, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was a great fall-time salad. I will definitely add this to my collection. Of note, it took about 45 minutes for my grapes to roast

Made this for my foodie friends one night because it was pretty quick & easy to put together. I did use goat cheese because it's what I had on hand. It was fantastic! The roasted grapes were seriously yummy! A keeper that I will use over & over now.

I made this salad to bring to my future father-in-law's b'day dinner. My fiance's family is picky, but this salad was devoured! I left out the cherries, but everything else was the same. I tossed everything right before it was served. Don't leave out the grapes! The roasted grapes add a great texture and burst of sweetness. Also, fresh lemon & zest is key in the dressing. I used Wegman's "Italian blend" for the greens.

This salad received raves at our "dinner group" gathering last evening. I omitted the cherries as suggested by previous reviewers. The roasted grapes were a unique addition to a salad. I made sure to use authentic aged balsamic vinegar. It is a definite do-over!

This is my favorite salad. The flavors are complex with the sweetness of the roasted grapes, pears, tart cherries, crisp- salty prosciutto, tangy cheese and nutty pine nuts all blending together to make this salad a culinary delight. Instead of making a lemon vinaigrette and drizzling balsamic over the finished salad, I prefer to make a balsamic vinaigrette. I've also left out the pecorino cheese and baked individual rounds of goat cheese (about 2" across and 1/2 " thick) coated with the lightly toasted slightly chopped pine nuts. The nut- covered rounds briefly visit the broiler so the cheese can soften. Watch and check as this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes, depending on the height of the broiler shelf and the heat of the broiler. The completed cheese rounds are slid onto the plated, dressed salad. You have to serve it immediately so the softened cheese melts into the salad. Either cheesy way, this salad is a culinary delight!

Loved this recipe. I added some mozzarella chunks, too, just because I love cheese with prosciutto. Very good salad for entertaining because it looks so pretty. FYI, I have a picture of it on my blog (shirleyjump.blogspot.com). loved it!

I enjoyed this salad, but agree with other reviewers that the cherries were a bit too much sweet with the grapes and pear. The roasted grapes are a unique touch.

Made for Girls Gourmet group and all eight of us loved it. All are wanting recipe to make again.

Like the last review, i found that the dried cherries and baked grapes were too similar, and next time would probably skip the cherries because they were expensive, and the grapes were more unique. Also, I had soaked dried figs in orange juice for another dish, and used the juice in place of the lemon juice here, delicious! Everyone at my dinner party loved it.

Really delicious. I used arugula which was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the fruit. Both my husband and I loved the salad but felt so many different fruits were unnecessary, and baking the grapes and softening the cherries added a lot of extra work. Next time I'd make it with pears and maybe fresh grapes cut in half. Also, I used a potato peeler to make shreds of cheese. Excellent!

I made this for a new year's eve dinner party and all plates came back clean. One guest said that if he got salad like this more often, he'd eat salad more often. I threw in some leftover pancetta along with everything else---delicious!

Fantastic recipe. I served this for Christmas dinner (no changes at all) and it was fabulous. i did use fresh lemon juice and good 10 yr old balsamic. Everyone finished their salads. I will definitely make this again.

My cousin made this for Thanksgiving and it was unbelievable! I literally demanded two seconds after the first bite that I have the recipe. I felt like I was eating at a fine dining restaurant! So, I'm making this for Christmas dinner at my brother's house and just know everyone will love it!!! Thank you for the amazing recipe!!

This was fantastic!! I made this and a risotto with seafood for four of us and we fought over the stuff left in the salad bowl. I used extra prosciutto, dried cranberries and an organic mix of greens. I can't wait to make this again

This was an outstanding salad; a wonderful balance between sweet and salty and crunchy and soft foods. I did put a tiny bit of the lemon juice on the pears so they wouldn't brown as they waited for the salad to be served. I also found the dressing to be a bit bland and used a tiny bit of fresh meyer lemon zest in the dressing to brighten the flavor.

I made this recipe this weekend for an 'all-Italian' menu dinner party. I kept the dressing on the side, juse in case there were left-overs, but not to worry - we ended up finishing it for dessert!!

Excellent - guests ate every bite. I used more prosciutto - about 1/4 pound. Dried cranberries are a good subsitute for the cherries and easier to find. I used less oil in salad dressing. I'm making this again and again!

I made this tonight with ingredients I already had on hand. I substituted sherry vinegar for the lemon juice, bacon for the proscuitto, and shaved parmesan for the pecorino. Everything else was as printed in the recipe. This is a great salad! I've never roasted grapes before and was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. I'll definitely make this again.

Making this tonight, but I am pretty sure it's going to be a winner.
