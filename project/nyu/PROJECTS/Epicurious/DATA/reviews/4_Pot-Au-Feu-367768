I made this with beef bones but not marrow bones. I also added a whole chicken (small). It was very delicious, and we had it for dinner for a few nights as it makes such a large portion. Yum!

Took all day, and couldn't find any garlic sausage or veal, but it turned out fabulous. My boyfriend had never had it before and really liked it. I had so much meat and chicken (I put a small chicken in the pot ala Julia Child) that I didn't even serve the ribs - I guess we'll have them tomorrow!

Served this for a table of 10 for a holiday meal. One guest told me it was the best meal he ever ate. My mother-in-law said she would love her other daughter-in-laws to taste it! I did add more flavor to the broth. I squeezed half a lemon, added 2 tbs tarragon, 1 tbs turmeric, and a dash of white wine.

I made this when we had people over. It was delicious, but required a colossal amount of ingredients from the butcher. I have very big pots, and ended up using my two biggest pots and the ingredients were almost bubbling over. Be prepared. Also it was puzzling that some ingredients were not eaten but just used for the broth - the veal for example. I could have served an army with all the meat involved, but the leftover meat and broth was incredible in soup. The broth was over the top, really. Next time I'll try Julia's recipe from Mastering the Art of French cooking, which includes a whole stewing hen, but no veal.

This sounds absolutely amazing, but the amount of ingredients and all the things to be done is "offsetting" I would love this if somebody else made it for me. Again, I'm sure it's great.
