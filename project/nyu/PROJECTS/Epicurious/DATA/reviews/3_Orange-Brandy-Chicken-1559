Ok I read the reviews and still tried it with a few major changes first off I used 3/4 cup orange tangerine juice and 1/4 cup cherry brandy added 1/2 tsp ginger and that was the sauce. I cooked the chicken to recipe but did not use rosemary just salt and pepper. The sauce thickened great I cooked over med-high/high heat with the chicken still in the pan. After about 15-20 min the sauce thickened perfectly. As a side note I was only cooking 1 chicken breast so if using more chicken double the sauce. This version based off the original recipe was great and quick perfect for a mid-week meal.

I've made this recipe many times and my friends have always loved it. It's a great thing to make for a weeknight supper since it's so fast and easy.

I followed the recipe, and somehow it came out too salty. Otherwise, the flavors were just so-so.

I agree that this much concentrate is a bit too much, otherwise it's great.

Excellent and easy--my husband made it! Worthy of serving to company. Very good with wild rice and fresh green beans.

Although it was good, the chicken was a little bland and I couldn't get the sauce to thicken. I did use orange juice instead of concentrate and I used the tip of adding cream to thicken. It certainly was easy to make, and I might try experimenting next time with adding some fruit to the sauce and looking for something to thicken the sauce with.

I thought the orange juice concentrate was a bit *too* sweet and too sour, so I will be using less. But everyone loved it otherwise.

This was ok. I probably screwed it up by putting some finely shredded orange peel in for more flavor. I was very careful to avoid pith, but it still had a bitter edge to it. I didn't have concentrate, so I squeezed oranges for the juice. My husband liked it. I served it with rice and doubled the sauce. Next time I'll use concentrate and make a little more than double the sauce. My sauce needed help thickening, but not much.

Thought this was great, easy. Used Hawaii's Own brand Passion Orange juice and it came out very well.

This dish was blah. Did the suggestions too. Still didn't help.

What's with all the 4-forks? It was good, but not amazing. We did like that it was so quick and easy to prepare, and we will be making it again for a quick mid-week dinner. But - if you really want to wow your company - this may not be the dish.

Even though many people have reviewed this recipe, I felt compelled to submit my own review. This recipe is as good as it gets... easy, readily accessible ingredients,and fast. It tastes good enough to make for a dinner party and yet is so quick to make it also doubles as a regular family favourite... when this dish shows up on my monthly meal rotation schedule, it gives my whole day a boost. You just can't say too many good things to say about this dish... Does the woman who contributed the recipe have any others for us to try?

I made this for a holiday dinner and it was fantastic! I did use some of the suggestions--added cream, Grand Marnier, used orange juice versus orange concentrate, and added some garlic as I sauteed the chicken, but was told this was one of my best ever. Presentation was enhanced by the fresh orange slices--spectacular!

I made this for dinner last night and everyone liked it. I used Grand Marnier in place of brandy for an added taste of orange, and added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce to help it thicken. Very nice dish.

This was really easy but I would rather have a different flavor than simplicity. My husband gave it a two and a half only because I made risotto with it. I finished it with a bit of heavy cream, taking a suggestion from another reviewer and I'm glad I did since it cut down the overly strong orange flavor - I should have listened to the other reviewer who suggested orange juice and not the concentrate. Its okay.

Good and easy.

Excellent dish! Quick and easy to make assuming that you have all the ingredients on hand. Goes well with herb-roasted potatoes.

Made the full sauce recipe for 2 chicken breast halves, using just 1 tablespoon butter, thyme instead of rosemary, and threw a couple of minced garlic cloves in to saute with the chicken when I turned it. Yummy and easy; we'll make it again the same way.

Great, easy recipe. Takes no time at all. Everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it!Friends have called to ask for the recipe!

This dish was wonderful, particularly with the addition of cream in the sauce (as suggested by another reviewer). The flavor was subtle and went well with rice pilaf. I will happily make this again.

I'm not sure if I would make this again the flavors were overpowering and I would have to adjust the flavors to my taste......it was very easy to make and if I could adjust it I might try again

I used only two breast halves, but made the full sauce recipe. The cooking time was perfect and I used nice plump breasts, and it turned out very moist!

The chicken was moist and juicy, but I will tinker with the sauce a bit next time. The chicken broth flavor seemed to overpower the taste of the other ingredients. I will use a differnt brand if I try this again.

We found this recipe to be incredibly quick and easy. Great for dinner after a busy day of work! We did double the sauce as suggested and used cognac instead of brandy (we were out) which turned out just fine. This recipe will be in our rotation for a while.

Add Cream or heavy cream to this dish and discover that it becomes 4 forks. And do make more than suggested.....

I tried this because of all the good reviews. I also made rice, white basmati cooked in chicken broth with a little saffron thrown in, and it was perfect with the chicken and sauce. A green salad with an orange juice concentrate vinagrette rounded up the plate. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 2
I thought the sauce was a little too tangy for my liking - maybe just regular orange juice would be better rather than the concentrated kind. It was good mixed up with the rice but on it's own with the chicken it was too orange-y and I couldn't even taste the brandy.

I substituted the orange juice concentrate with the same amount of orange juice (I had no concentrate), and I also used cognac. It turned out very tasty. I will make it again.

Delicious! Easy. I agree, double the sauce part of the recipe. You'll want plenty of sauce. It is sooo good! I can't wait to make it again.

Solid 3 forks. Very simple, yet very good. Add extra amounts for the sauce and cook the chicken longer than indicated. At a working bachelor, I don't get home until late, and this meal amost cooks itself. Great with rice.

Based on previous reviews, I doubled the sauce. I also grilled the chicken rather than frying it. My husband rates this recipe three-folks because he is not a fan of citrus marinades but I think this is sooo delicious and easy--merits a 4-fork rating.

My co-worker and I both made this last night and both agreed it was delicious. We both found that the chicken needed to be cooked a little longer than recipe called for..maybe pound the chicken first? We also found that we wanted more sauce, it was delicious!

Really good, really simple. Great dish to whip up for the family after a long day at work and good for company too.

This is a good, solid "three forks." Soooo easy! We served it with rice and baked asparagus(450 degrees for 10 min). I agree with the other reviewer about the weekday convenience factor. To make it even easier, we used mandarin oranges instead of segmenting oranges.

If dishes were rated for deliciousness per amount of effort this would earn 10 forks. What a fabulous dish for very little work!

Delicious, fast and very easy. Perfect for a weeknight. I took previous reviewers' advice and doubled sauce ingredients ... sensational over rice. I'd like to make a suggestion about using dried rosemary in a recipe that cooks very quickly like this. I grind some up in an electric coffee grinder I keep just for spices and use the rosemary "powder" instead of the leaves. I dislike getting those hard little sticks in my mouth, and you also have better control over how strong a rosemary flavor you want.

This was a wonderful recipe! I'm glad I made it, I will add it to my frequent dinner recipes. I served it with rice, I added a little extra wine & broth for enough to pour over the rice.

I first tired this recipe when it first published in Bon Appetit Magazine and I loved it. I actually had all of the ingredients in my kitchen. Very economical and that's coming from a struggling culinary student (at the time). Now this recipe has come as part of my dinner ideas for my family.

This recipe is easy and yummy! I served the chicken with garlic bread. Adding some vegetables to the sauce is my suggestion. (I added celery and red bell pepper.)

WOW! What a surprise to find such an easy recipe that packs a whollop of a taste. This is company worthy. Make extra sauce; it's great over rice.

I found this to be an easy, quick, flavorful chicken. For extra flavor, I put slits in the chicken before putting the sauce on it.
