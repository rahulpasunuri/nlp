How in the world did you get 16 cookies out of this recipe? I used a 4" Heart Cutter and got only 8.

I made these for valentines day a couple of years ago, they are very good. I sliced them open and on the bottom one I placed some strawberries that had been marinating in sugar and then I topped that with whipped cream and place the other half of the heart on top, it makes for a lovely presentation and a great end to great meal.

Well it's obvious there isn't much to go wrong with this.These are very simple to make.The nutmeg flavor isn't strong,so I adjust the sugar/nutmeg combo if you like nutmeg. I served these along with chocolate dipped strawberries.I think I would try them with cinnamon next time.
