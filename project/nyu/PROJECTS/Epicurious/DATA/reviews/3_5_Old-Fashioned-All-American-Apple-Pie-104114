The pie was delicious although I did change it a bit - I used Granny Smith apples and then some orange juice and walnuts in the apple mix. Great balance of sour/sweet.

A very nice, simple apple pie that is easy to make. Delicious crust! I made the mistake of not adding enough sugar after reading the warning.

This pie is simple and an excellent addition to your recipe box! I used all cortlands (firm and tart) and threw in a few spoonfuls of white sugar and light brown sugar. I let it sit and then tasted it. Next time I will use all dark sugar to try and punch up the flavor. I can't see why other people would has this is too bland and the crust boring. It was perfect for me and SIMPLE which is the way a classic OLD- FASHIONED ALL- AMERICAN pie should be. If you're looking for infusion cuisine, try another website.

I love this apple pie. I use 1/3c of white sugar, 1/3c of brown sugar. I also use a variety of apples. Everyone always raves about this pie.

This was a real disappointment! The crust recipe turns out a beautiful, easy to work with crust, but the wheaty flavor of the pastry flour makes it taste like a doctor's prescription. The apple filling was so-so. Next time I'll go back to my apple crumb pie.

The perfect apple pie! I usually use 2/3 c. sugar and it comes out perfect with a mix of apples. Courtland, Granny, Fiji, and one Macintosh. Simple and the thin butter crust is always commented on with any pie I bake.

I was never a number one fan of apple pie. I liked it, but didn't love it. Therefore, I think it's fair for me to say, the apple filling, given that you're a fan of apple pie, is good. I know however, that the thin butter crust recipe was very, very good. The crust was flaky, the outer edge is crunchy, and has an elegant colour once baked. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a great pie recipe: beats the pants off of the other ones I have tried. Simple ingredients, though you can certainly spice things up if you choose. Very easy and pleasing.

A lovely pie - just what this Vermont native needed to stave off October homesickness. I used 2/3 cup of sugar and some nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. The apples were labeled "Stark" - I don't know if over here that means Gala or if they just haven't bred all the flavor out of the Red Delicious like back home, but they were flavorful and held their shape very well. I found the crust a little tricky to work with as the dough is quite crumbly (my old family recipe calls for shortening, which I have not been able to find here), but the end result is worth it.

This was tasty. I added much less sugar (about 3 tablespoons) than the reviewers recommended below, but the pie was sweet enough because of the apples I used (a mix from the farmers market).

I have made this apple pie since 2001, for every holiday, party, event... Everyone totally loves it. I use frozen premade crusts. I also top it with another premade crust and cut vents. It is easier and saves a lot of time. This pie is awesome!

I never baked anything before this apple pie. I made it myself, and luckily I did not burn it or ruin it in any way. After my mother had the first bite, she said that I am going to bake this for every family party. It was enjoyed by everyone who had a bite of my pie. As a suggestion, use a cup of sugar, and make 2 pies instead of one, and it will save you time and you can feed more people!

A tasty, simple recipe. Go ahead and mix the crust in a blender--it saves time and turns out just the right texture. I took another user's suggestion to add just 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar, and it worked out great. (S)he suggested a mix of apples (which I did, because it was what I had), but I strongly suggest using only green (or sour) apples. Next time, I'll use green apples and a touch more sugar to balance it. I found that there was way too much filling.

This is such an easy recipe & always gets rave reviews. I use 3 to 4 different apples & 1/3c brown sugar & 1/3c sugar. Not to sweet or tart.

Fantastic and oh-so-simple. The crust was easy and very good: I added cinnamon to mine as it is very plain and seemingly versatile. I used 1/2 Granny Smith and 1/2 Gravenstein apples - a nice mixture. To be honest, I wish there was a little more specificity to this recipe. I used about 2/3 -3/4 cup of sugar - 1/4 of a cup was brown sugar. Some of the filling boiled a little over. That isn't something that bothers me, but did make it look less clean. I used 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon and that seemed pretty decent. Seems like you could play with the seasoning to your own tastes - I wouldn't say no to a bit of allspice or vanilla bean. Overall easy and lovely(it was gone in less than a day, with only 4 people eating it).

My first apple pie and it was a winner. I used local organic gravenstein apples and 2/3 cups sugar.The texture was perfect.

First of all, the bad news. The end result was that there was too much liquid in the pie, this must of been from the apples as I did not add any water at all. I used the recommended Granny Smith. The good news is that the pie had a fantastic flavour, I added a hint of nutmeg & all spice and three cloves. I used about 1/2 cup sugar. Next time I make it, when I mix the apples with the sugar and spices, i will also sprinkle in some flour to soak up the excess fluid and to make it thicker. The crust was fantastic. Overall a good pie with a great apple taste and great crust.

I didn't make the crust for this recipe, but the filling was easy to make and tasted very good when served with ice cream but seemed a bit too tart without the ice cream.

All in all a very good recipe, we found the number of apples it calls for in a little bit excessive, unless you are using very small apples. Crust was very flaky, truly delectable!

This was my third attempt at baking a pie. I used my "tried and true" butter and shortening crust that was the best part of my other two pies. Since the recipe was vague on the amount of sugar and cinnamon to use, I found the reviews helpful. I used 1/2 cup of sugar, a Tbs of brown sugar (my idea based on other recipes), a Tbs of cinnamon and two dashes of nutmeg. I used a mix of Jonagolds and Macouns that didn't seem very tart so I added the juice of one lemon. It was probably dumb luck but the pie was great - juicy and sweet and not soupy. My grandson said it was real yummie!

I made this pie, two actually, for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved over it! Every person said it was by far the best apple pie they'd ever had! I used about 8 small granny smiths for one pie, and about 4 large granny smiths for the other pie. I used 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, and two dashes of nutmeg, for each pie. I didn't use the crust recipe here, so I can't comment about it. However, the pie was delicious!

I found White's note about over-seasoning unhelpful. I was conservative with the sugar & cinnamon and regretted it. I realize more experienced cooks prepare by taste, but actual measurements would have helped this beginner. The pie turned out to be absolutely unremarkable.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2003 with Granny Smiths and it was a hit. I used the "Pastry Dough" recipe for the crust. Don't be afraid when sprinkling the sugar and flour. Highly recommended.

The pastry was wonderfully crisp and tasted buttered and delicious. The filling too was great. My boyfriend was extremely impressed. I only used 4 apple and it was enough (3 granny smiths, 1 regular) and 1/2 cup sugar. The only problem was that a few hours after making it, the apple looked a light brown and rather unapetizing - a bit like sauted onions and green peppers!!! Maybe tossing it in lemon juice first could have prevented this.

This is a nice basic apple pie recipe. I used about half the sugar called for in the recipe because my apples were sweeter than granny smiths. My pie crust was easy to make and held it's shape very well. It helped that I chilled my bowl, my rolling pin and my board. I also cut my butter into the flour with two knives instead of mushing with my fingers or a fork. If you start out with fairly small pieces of butter to begin with, cutting it down is simple. Cutting it kept the butter a little cooler and better incorporated into the flour. My crust was a bit dry, but I think it's because I baked my pie at too low a temperature (325 F. 375 F was too high for my oven) for a longer period of time, to ensure that my crusts don't burn, but that my filling would be adequately cooked.

I did the same as before me, I used 1/2 c of sugar and 1 tbls. cinnamon, but I also added I tsp. of vanilla. I also used the refrig. already made crust and it turned out awesome! This was the first time I have made apple pie, and I will never eat store bought again! Everyone loved it, and it was so easy to make. I highly recommend it!

The pie tasted great. Had too much apple though, used 4 granny smiths, 1 packham pear and 1 gala. Added 2 tblspns sugar and 1 tblspn cinnamon. But can someone help me with the crust? It was so fragile, it broke up as soon as I touched it. Did I put too much flour?

This recipe was delicious! I used about 1/2 cup of fructose (fruit sugar)in place of cane sugar and topped the pie with a crumb topping (consiting of brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter and walnuts)instead of the pastry crust. I was amazed at the result. This apple pie tasted better than ones I have had at restaurants. I found that a nice scoop of vanilla bean ice cream goes great with the warm pie. YUMMY!!!!!

I never liked apple pie until I made this recipe! I picked it out for a friend looking for a good apple pie recipe and when she raved, I decided I had to try it out. I'm so glad I did! I'm making it again for my parents this weekend who adore apple pie. I followed previous comments and used Granny Smiths, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tbsp cinnamon. I also used a store-bought refridgerated fold-open pie crust, which I'd never used before, but it turned out well, esp. since I didn't feel like making the crust! Highly recommended!!

This pie came out just like my moms, who always grannie smith apples to give it a little kick. But I used my own crust--basically the same thing, but with Crisco instead of butter. Shortening and lard have less water so they make a better pie crust.

Rating: 4
yes it is very delicious, I had way too much apples as you all found out. my question is, how can I make my pie crust as flaky as the top crust? is it because the extra apples wet the crust and made it less flaky than the top part? I did try to throw in as much apple as I could though. Can someone give me the answer?

To the cook from Boston on 9/18/02. One possible solution to toomuch juice in pie, I put about 1-2 tablespoons of semolina in middle of pastry base, this tends to soak up fruit juices.

Help please. I have a question and you cooks sound like you know what you're doing. Why is it that sometimes I get too much liquid at the bottom of my pies? This can happen with apple or blueberry fillings. I would like to know the causes before I try again with this recipe, which sounds terrific. Thank you

First pie I ever made, and was it ever yummy! Too many apples, but the taste more than made up for it. I'd definitely making it again, only next time I'm upping the dough (it was a stretch to get it to fit) and adding more sugar to the Granny Smith apples. Best apple pie I've ever had!

I made this as a get well gift for my husband, and it was an instant cure! Three pounds of apples was way too much, and since I used Granny Smith, they needed a lot of sugar--they gave it a mild citrus flavor, which was great. The crust was excellent--I zipped it up with mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and I topped the top crust with a mix of brown sugar, ground pecans, a small amt of ground up oats, some spice, and half a stick of cold butter chopped into the mix right before baking (helps with adhesion and taste). Next time I will be sure to make more crust, since this one barely met the edges at 1/8". Don't be afraid of overseasoning if you use GS apples. They can stand their ground very well.

The crust on this pie was very nice....However, I believe the pie was not sweet enough. Admittedly, my fault and a mistake that I will correct next time. I was worried about "oversweetening' the pie and in the process, ended up with a slightly bland, uninteresting filling. Next time I'll add a nice dose of cinnamon and more than a few tablespoons of sugar.

This recipe was so good that even some efforts to totally ruin it were easily corrected. I teach a cooking class to beginning cooks and pie dough is a tough(sometimes very tough)lesson. All three classes were successful with this dough and the pies were gorgeous and delicious(only one student said that the pie wasn't sweet enough). It earns a spot in the hall of fame.

this is the pie of my childhood, my mother used a yellow crockery pie plate, and the aroma as the pie came out of the oven was heavenly...In fact my husband married me because he loved my mothers apple pie. People always look askance when I say put dabs of butter on the top of the pie. But that adds to the flavor
