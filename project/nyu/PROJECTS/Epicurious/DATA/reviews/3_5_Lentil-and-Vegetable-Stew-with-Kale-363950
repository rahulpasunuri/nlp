I found this stew rather bland.

This was a simple recipe and it's quite tasty and healthy. I used parsnip in place of the rutabaga and celeriac. I also used chicken stock. I really like this! It's filling and low fat. Yay.

I think I initially added this recipe to my box when I was collecting recipes for kale. I was looking through my box for a vegetarian legume dish. This fit the bill and I also had a celeriac to use up (first time I bought this vegetable), so it was perfect. I have made a lot of lentil-based recipes similar to this, but so many people stated that this was bland that I was expecting the worst. I cooked it for a full hour (20 minutes for lentils??? I tasted it after 25 and they were still uncooked, but I expected no less!!!). Once cooked I poured myself a bowl, topped it off with a bit of flax oil for omega3, and some millet I had cooked earlier. It wasn't bland at all! I love lentils, kale, and root vegetables and this was a very comforting dish. As soon as I looked at it I knew I had to make some caramelized onions to top it off, but I ate the whole bowl with no need for that even though I wasn't especially hungry--it was just too good! I didn't even use broth, I used plain water, with a little bit of a hunk of salt from making a recipe for salt-crusted cornish game hen which ended up with salt left over (I'm trying to use this up before my bouillon cubes, but I don't think it does add much other than sodium). This recipe really does make a lot and I expect it will be around for a while. As for those who said it had a lot of prep, it did take me an hour to get everything in the pot, but that's pretty standard for a full-course vegetable-based dish (of which I've made many). It didn't seem to have too much prep work as there really aren't too many vegetables in it, other than the kale which I think is a bit of a job.

Pretty bland. I liked the fact that it was healthy and vegetarian but it needs something more. The vegetables were tasty but a large serving is too bland to get through. Would recommend some good bread and butter to serve along side or adding parmesan cheese. Prep takes a lot of time. Lots of chopping.

Delicious and hearty! I substituted the rutabaga with parsnip and the vegetable broth with chicken broth (low sodium). I also added 2 bay leaves when I added the broth. It turned out to be the perfect dish for a cold and rainy evening around a fire. Tomorrow we are going to reheat it with some ground turkey. Hope it is as good as tonight's meal!

This stew was amazing. Very fresh, healthy, and I added a little extra herbs de provence because it smells so good. This recipe was very quick, and pretty large, so I think next time I make it, I'll be sure to invite some friends over to help out. It was a lot for just the two of us.

I enjoyed this stew. It was hearty and filling. I swapped the rutabaga for sweet potato which in concert with the celery root was very rich. I would definitely make this again on a cold rainy day.

I make vegtable soups all the time. This one really was lacking on flavour. I wouldn't make it again or recommend it. There are many other great soups out there which are equally healthy and taste far better.

I wish this was better. The flavor was okay, but since my husband came of age in the 70s this stew quickly became known with much hilarity in the house as "hippy stew". Again, taste is okay. Look? Not so great. It's a brown mass on the plate. After braving three meals to get through what we made, we decided that we had done our duty and tossed the rest. We doctored it up with plenty of grated Parmesan and soy sauce.

Great recipe. Lentils are an excellent source of protein and fiber. This is a good week-day recipe for the whole family. www.holistichealthandlifestyle.com

I am always a bit nervous making lentil soups because I am afraid they will be bland. This one was anything but I really loved it!

I'm a vegetarian and have eaten a lot of lentil soups. This one was blah at best. I kind of envy the previous reviewer who had the option of adding sausage! I'm sure it must have helped!

Delicious! It is a lot of chopping but worth it. I added sausage (browned first and then removed before the onion & veg was added). It has a great, rich flavor. Can't wait to eat leftovers for lunch!
