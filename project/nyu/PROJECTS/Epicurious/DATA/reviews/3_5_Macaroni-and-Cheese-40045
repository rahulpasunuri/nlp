This is the best macaroni and cheese that I've ever made! I have tried numerous recipes for this traditional classic comfort food and decided to try this one for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe for the cheese sauce and took the suggestions of other reviewers to double it. I used a mixture of sharp cheddar, Romano and Parmesan cheeses for the sauce and added cayenne pepper, nutmeg and a pinch of Mrs. Dash's. What resulted was a creamy and flavorful dish that my husband raved over! I will definitely make this again.

This was yummy comfort food. I didn't realize that you needed to double the cheese sauce when I first read the recipe. I thought it could have used a little more sauce, though, so that made sense after I read one of the reviews. I added more cayenne and some paprika after the bread crumbs. I crumbled up garlic bread crumbs from Stew Leonards (if you live in the NY/CT area, you know what I am talking about) for the topping, and it was delicious.

This Fanny Farmer Cookbook recipe for Mac & Cheese is perfect. For the bread crumbs, I use sourdough bread. Depending on what cheese is in the refrigerator, I will ofen use a blend of cheddar, brie, etc. The recipe freezes well, making it a great dish to make and send to your children in college who may be longing for a home cooked meal.

I've never had a problem with this recipe being anything but delicious, but I always add a dash of cayenne pepper and some cinnamon or nutmeg to my bechamel before turning it to cheese sauce. I then also triple the cheese. Maybe it's also because I use a few different types of cheese: two type of cheddar, usually a white and a yellow, and whatever else I have lying around. Gouda, parmesan, manchego, anything. All of my friends and family love it.

Yes, it's bland. Mac and cheese is a favorite food of toddlers. It's supposed to be bland. I made this and my husband loved it. Tried a fancier, more interesting mac'n'cheese recipe and it was voted down. This is a classic. I only give it 3 forks because doubling (or quadrupling) the sauce recipe every time is a bit annoying.

Rating: 2
I'm sure that it's delicious with all the other reviewers add-ins and beef ups but as the recipe stands on it's own--- it's just not that good. I used 2 cups of the cheese sauce for a full pound of pasta and has more than enough. I also tripled the cheese. It was bland.

I didn't check the reviews first because this is EPICURIOUS :) That was a mistake. It was very bland. Next time I will use this as a base and add sautéd onions and garlic...or something. As is, this just did not do it for me or my family.

I LOVE this recipe! It is so delicious, and the simplicity allows for creativity. You can play with different cheeses (try half cheddar and half asiago fresco- YUM), and different add-ins (veg/fish/meat). Once I added 1 lb of fresh scallops (quartered) and a can of artichoke hearts- just mixed them in before putting the dish in the oven- and it was divine. I typically use whole grain macaroni, and panko breadcrumbs instead of homemade.

Rating: 4
Very basic recipe to elaborate with. I added a touch of chicken broth to the pasta water. I added a small bay leaf and a cayenne pepper/paprika mix to the heating milk before adding it to the roux mix. I also added a finely chopped small onion and one garlic clove to the roux mix before adding the hot milk. After milk was added, I added 1c sharp cheddar and a handful of parm cheese. For variation, I add chopped up fine ham and frozen peas. I double the cheese for the topping before adding the bread crumbs. So yum!

OK, I've reviewed this before. But I do take issue with those who write it's bland. Use better quality (and possibly more) cheese! I hate to sound like a snobby cook, but your food will only be as good as your ingredients. If you're going for this kind of fatty, carb-filled comfort dish, for goodness' sake, do it right. Tonight, I made it with fontina, maytag blue cheese and sharp cheddar, with jalapeno tabasco sauce. Almost ate the dish I baked it in!!! Don't forget to double the sauce recipe.

Pretty solid. You can experiment with different cheeses. The topping is good...I'd use low fat cheese...I used half whole grain macaroni and half 'regular' macaroni.

I have to agree with captcook66. The first time I ever made this I made this mistake: No offence to anyone, but I think the mistake most people are making with this recipe is : The Macaroni and chesse recipe calls for two cups of cheese sauce, and the recipe for cheese sauce makes one cup

Rating: 3
I liked this. Several people seem to cut on this recipe as bland, but it really depends on your Bechamel sauce. I did have to add more macaroni to the recipe, though. Maybe it is just me, but this was a bit heavy on the sauce, even though I could just sit and eat a bowl of cheese sauce.

Rating: 4
Yummy. The cheesey bechamel sauce isn't hard -- just follow instructions and have the macaroni cooked before you start the sauce. I used whole milk and think that probably works best. It is not spicy, but then mac and cheese isn't supposed to be. Adding chopped ham and peas makes it lovely full meal.

This is the one great recipe for mac and cheese. You can add just about anything to it. I have added jalpenos to it before baking it and it's awesome. When making it, use the expensive cheddar and I use canned milk for a creamier taste.

Like other reviewers, I needed to double the sauce recipe, and added chopped onion and garlic to to the roux for flavor. However, I strained it with a sieve as I poured the sauce over the pasta. I also used extra sharp cheddar (doubled the amount), and added some shaved parmesan as well. I've never attempted homemade mac and cheese, but I think it's the best I've tasted yet! And I couldn't believe how easy it was to make. Definitely a keeper!

It's true that this isn't the most earthshaking recipe for adults (for that, try mac with gruyere and prosciutto on this site), but if you're cooking for kids and adults, this totally fits the bill  bland enough for children, comfort-foodie enough for adults. the bechamel was easier than previous attempts i have made  and i got lazy and just nuked the milk, but it still worked perfectly. i did use a lot more cheese than called for, extra sharp  it needs the sharpness to keep from being too boring.

Dude from River City is way wrong. This is THE classic, traditional recipe. You can make many variations of mac & cheese, of course, but when you want the real thing, this is the recipe to follow. Just double the amount of cheese for the cheese sauce, double the cheese sauce itself, and double the amount of cheese sprinkled on top before baking and you've got THE perfect, classic, All-American mac and cheese recipe. Oh yeah, find yourself a real good (i.e., expensive, for you cheapskates) cheddar for best results. If you use a cheap cheddar, you've only got yourself to blame if your mac & cheese sucks hairy donkey balls.

I've made a few variations of this recipe to cure it of the "blands" that I had when I first made it - they can make a difference in the final results.. When making the cheese sauce, right after melting the butter, I add crushed garlic and finely chopped onions or shallots. Once the onions are translucent, I'll continue the recipe as noted, but I'll use different cheeses as my taste buds and cheese selection vary - provolone, muenster, extra sharp cheddar, a little parmesean, and monterey jack have all been successful in different combinations thus far. I also like to add a good pinch of seasoning salt or Adobo to the sauce prior to mixing with the pasta. I've kept this recipe on file (print and online) for years - it's a keeper!

Very tasty! I made it with smoked cheddar for a nice twist. I added an extra half c. of cheese to the sauce (note: the recipe requires 2 recipes of sauce!), and don't leave out the cayenne! I made it GLUTEN-FREE by using gluten-free pasta, gluten-free bread crumbs and sorghum flour in the cheese sauce. Yum!

Great dish, better with a generous pinch of thyme in the cheese sauce as well as more pepper.Colby blends well with the cheddar for extra flavor and if you are more adventurous, stewed tomatoes mixed in before baking is delish!

This is a great base recipe. I have tried white and yellow cheddar and for some reason the white cheddar seems to taste better. I definately use more cheese than called for and usually make extra cheese sauce, and for more zing I add white pepper and cayanne pepper to taste (I like a little more heat to mine) and it is a hit every time!

Easy and good

Rating: 3
This is a very easy recipe that produces pretty good results. Two things that will make it better are: 1) using more cheese, and 2) throwing a little bit of some other cheese besides cheddar, maybe gruyere or a bit of feta. I used an entire 8 oz package of tillamook (sp?) sharp cheddar split between the cheese sauce and the cheese that gets mixed with the pasta, and I did not feel that it was too much cheese. But as other commenters noted, it's a very mild dish. So adding a little bit of cheese variety can help keep it interesting. ... Or you can vary the recipe in a million other ways. The point is, it's a very good basic recipe, a place to start your mac n cheese explorations.

How many of you raised your kids on package mac & cheese? I can recall a famous brand for 5 for $1.00. Started getting expensive when it was 4 for a $1. Really expenisive when it was 3 for $1. And our kids were hooked. Is it bland? Yes. That's why the kids all love it! Ever gone to a Mexican restaurent? Bland mac & cheese. ANY buffet--bland. ANY deli--bland. Mixing cheeses gives this a good zip. Help me to understand---before putting it into a pan to bake, the cook has to know how bland it is for her family/friends. Right? Add jalapenos, chipotles, Tabasco, lots of pepper flakes, garlic, onion--whatever. Most people want a simple recipe for mac & cheese. Pure comfort food--bringing back memories of childhood. The + for using this recipe? You can pronounce everything in it.

Excellent mac&cheese. In response to other reviewers, Epicurious seems to have fixed the cheese sauce link... simple bechamel, the same as given by a previoius review. My only hint - cook your pasta first. I dont often make bechamel, and forgot how quickly it all comes together. To avoid that yucky skin on top, have the pasta in the cassarole dish ready to go.

I love this macaroni and cheese. The recipe is so simple and you get perfect results every single time. However, I agree with what Linda Smith and winter wrote - do NOT use the cheese sauce recipe linked with this recipe. For some reason Epicurious have mixed-up the links because it used to link to another cheese sauce/bechamel recipe by Fannie Farmer.

I've made this several times and it's great as written, though I (of course) add more cheese. DO NOT make the cheese sauce from this link. I found the other sauce that's supposed to go with the recipe. I'll try to cut and paste the URL but in the event that it doesn't work, search for white sauce or bechamel sauce. It's also an FF recipe so you can't miss it. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/40046

This recipe is great as along as you can expect failure the first time. I did it the first the way it was printed and it was ok. The second time, I decided to use yellow sharp instead of white.

Play with the ingredients a bit and I assure you success.

Broken links within the recipes is so irritating, but I'm usually successful if I look for them separately. Searches for Bechamel Sauce, White Sauce and Fannie Farmer all came back with results that included the Cheese Sauce referenced in this recipe. I hope this helps others who are as frustrated with the "missing link" situation. :) BTW, this recipe produces a creamy, delicious Mac n Cheese w/ a crispy crust that my family (and hubby's coworkers) love(s). I always flavor the simmering milk w/a small onion w/a clove stuck in it, a cracked clove of garlic or two and a bay leaf. We like ours w/very sharp cheddar and a bit of parmesan, which I also add to the bread crumb crust. Deeelicious!

This is a delicious version of homemade mac n cheese. However it does need more cheese. The noodles were a little dry. I will definitely make again but I will double the cheese sauce and add a little bit more cheddar. Otherwise very good and very easy to make. Even my toddler liked it!

This recipe is identical to the mac'n'cheese I grew up on and I love it. I made it for my husband tonight and he didn't. I found it a little grainy but I blame that on the extra sharp cheddar. He found it bland and not cheesy enough, or should I say cheezy? He prefers his mother's recipe for Mac and . . . well, whatever Velveeta really is. I'll make it again but eat it alone. His loss.

This is my standard mac & cheese recipe, though I substitute hot sauce (frank's red hot) for the cayenne, and I use crushed saltines rolled tossed in really soft butter for the crust-you can also add a little onion or garlic powder here. it's way better like this.

Another tip if you found the dish dry -although the mac & cheese recipe calls for TWO cups of cheese sauce, the sauce recipe only yields ONE cup, so you need to double the sauce recipe in order to have the proper amount. Once I corrected this mistake that I made the first time, the dish was delicious. I served it like they do at a Noodles restaurant in our area - with separate layers of noodles, sauce, extra cheese, and then buttered bread crumbs (I used panko) on top. Yum.

I really liked this recipe once I figured out the proportions! In addition to noticing that you should only use 1/2 lb of pasta, you also have to DOUBLE the cheese sauce recipe as written. The mac & cheese recipe calls for TWO cups of cheese sauce and the recipe only yields ONE cup.

If you are complaining that the dish is too dry, you are probably not actually using the right amount of pasta-1/2 pound of cooked pasta. For a full box of pasta, you would need to double the recipe.

Delicious. I doubled the cheese both in the sauce and for the topping and used a combination of cheddar, asiago and monterey jack. Really, really good.

Because I rely on the reviews often on this site, I'd like to try and clear up some confusion I had about them regarding this recipe. (Though maybe I'm just a little slow!) Many of the reviewers recommend doubling the sauce for this recipe, while some acknowledge that they missed the fact that the recipe calls for 2 cups of cheese sauce after directing you to a recipe for cheese sauce that makes only 1 cup. Add to that the fact that almost everyone recommends doubling the cheese and that the recipe itself only uses 1/2 pound of pasta and I got a little confused! Anyway, here's what I recommend: I doubled the recipe to make 1 pound of pasta, but left the sauce at it's recommended amount. Note that this means you have to quadruple the sauce recipe. I did follow the recommendations about doubling the amount of cheese in the sauce and on top and highly recommend it - the sauce is lovely and creamy, not clumpy like many mac and cheese recipes. I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of dry mustard, a pinch or two of cayenne and a healthy splash or two of Worchestershire to the sauce before adding the cheese - turned out very nicely. Lastly, I added a clove of minced garlic to the butter I toasted the breadcrumbs in - easy, yummy comfort food!

This is absolutely the BEST basic mac & cheese recipe. For the bread crumb topping, i mix 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs, 1 clove finely chopped garlic, 1 tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley into a crumbly topping. This makes a delicious, crunchy topping that really seals in the moisture of the mac & cheese.

This is a brilliant mac and cheese recipe. I used sharp white cheddar cheese only, adding about 1 and 1/2 cups more cheese to the recipe. I also used a garlic/parmesan crumb topping. It was fantastic!

I made this mac-n-cheese for my mom, a true aficionado, and she declared it the best she has ever had. It was very good. I would suggest adding about 1 cup more cheese to the sauce.

This is an excellent mac and cheese recipe! My husband and I just recently moved to England, and it was nice to be able to make mac and cheese from scratch, since there are no good boxed ones here. I added prosciutto di parma, used sharp cheddar cheese for the sauce, and topped it with bread crumbs that I toasted with butter and garlic mixed with some parmesan and a little more sharp cheddar cheese. It was so good that we made it two weeks in a row! I highly recommend this dish! The next time, I'll try it with some bacon.

So my husband asked me to make him macaroni and cheese from scratch and when I served it he said, "This is exactly what I was picturing." The crusty topping absolutely makes this dish in addition to the cheese sauce which is easy and fun to make.

THE BEST MACARONI AND CHEESE EVER! Yes, be sure to double the cheese sauce recipe. I also added dry or regular mustard, paprika, a little cayenne and lots of green onions. Also, use lots more cheese. About two cups for the cheese sauce and two for the top.

Don't do what I did the first time I made it... make sure you use 2 cups of sauce as the recipe states and not one (you have to double the cheese sauce recipe)! The first batch was awfully dry. I'm glad I went back and realized my error because after I made it the second time I absolutely loved this. It's a favorite around here. Quick and easy, too!!

Awesome recipe. All of my mac and cheese recipes have always been so-so. Ok, but a bit bland. Everyone devoured this macaroni and I hade to make more the very next night. I was very generous with salt and peppers (black and cayenne) and a good splash of Worchestershire.

I loved this dish though it turned out a bit dry. Next time I'll use more Bechamel (I used one cup of Bechamel for more than 1lb of cooked pasta). I also added 1/2 cup of Parmezan on top with the bread crumbs which gave a nice crisp to it.

As good mac & cheese should be, this dish was comforting. Like most everyone else, I used sharp cheddar and at least doubled the amount. Yum Yum!

Very easy and oh so tasty! I added more cheese to the sauce and to the topping leaving out the bread crumbs. I also added cayenne and lots of cracked pepper to the sauce which gave it a little pep. Everybody loved it and I had no left overs.

You really can't lose with this classic recipe. I always use extra sharp cheddar cheese and double the amount that the recipe calls for to the sauce. I use garlicky store made croutons, crushed, for the bread crumbs. I grew up eating this at home and my Dad always included chunks of ham, which was delicious too!

This is you basic (and perfect) baked mac and cheese. I too added a bit of worcestershire sauce and cayenne to the bechamel sauce, which is easy and fun to experiment with. I used extra-sharp cheddar which certainly doesn't make a "bland" dish. It's worth it to take care to make good and flavorful breadcrumbs. I'm sure simple additions like prosciutto, jalapenos, tomatoes or various cheeses would be yummy too!

Excellent Mac & Cheese! It was easy and delicious. Added extra chedder to the sauce as well as a touch of dry mustard. Also added extra shredded chedder to the topping & deleted bread crumbs. A great comfort food dish.

Excellent, classic version of macaroni and cheese. I used a lot more cheese than the recipe called for (10 oz. bar of sharp cheddar.) Put all but 1 cup of grated cheese in the sauce. I also added some dried mustard to the sauce. Everyone in the family loved it!

Very easy to make, but benefited from some extras. I borrowed from other recipes, adding mustard, paprika and some onion to the sauce for extra flavor. Also added some grated Romano underneath the bread crumb layer for extra flavor. Next time I'd try less cheddar and some asiago for variety.

This was my first attempt at "real" mac and cheese and it was so easy and soooooo yummy! I added some garlic, dijon mustard and some plum tomatoes and it was amazing! I can't wait to make it again!

This was my first time ever making mac & cheese, and it came out GREAT! I would definitely make this again. I followed the directions pretty closely, just adding more cheese than called for. When making the sauce, I used shallots, peppercorns and a bay leaf while warming the milk mixture. Also used half & half and chicken broth instead of milk. To the cook who thought this was bland....try adding more salt. I found it really brought out the cheesy taste.

This is a good basic recipe and the instructions on how to make a white sauce are very good. I used sharp cheddar and a bit of gorgonzola for extra flavor. I just wish I knew how to make a white sauce that didnt have such a floury taste, I have tried corn starch and it is a bit better. Used rotini instead of elbows and breadcrumbs sauteed in garlic and butter. I used alot more cheese than the recipe calls for and still found it to be bland.

Simple and delicious: the way macaroni and cheese ought to be. I tripled this recipe for a large gathering of friends. Not a scrap remained. I used Cabot Extra Sharp Cheddar (I put and extra cup in the sauce), and buttered seasoned bread crumbs on top. Everyone loved it. I'll be making it again.

Just like my mother used to make on Fridays when I was a kid. Definately a keeper, and I liked the tip about using hot milk in the cheese sauce, it speeds up the process.

Hi! I tried it with smoked cheddar and fontina on top, and sharp cheddar in the white sauce. Tasted wOnDeRfUl. I also recommend tossing the breadcrumbs in butter AND garlic. I added broccoli and red/yellow/orange peppers and cayenne. My marathon-running fiancee even had seconds...

The first time I made this, I followed the directions to the letter...but now, every time I make it, I add something different. Last time, I added green onions and broccoli. mmm

I used pepper jack and added diced sundried tomatoes and some cayenne. My husband and I really liked it. I didn't do the bread crumbs or baking, I just made the sauce and combined with cooked pasta. Good basic.

Instead of buttered crumbs, I drizzled the fat from 2 slices of bacon over the fresh crumbs, and then crumbled the crisp bacon over top. Hey, this is comfort food, right? Also mixed cheeses in sauce and used more as other reviewers advised. Added 1 tsp. dry mustard to give it zing. Omitted the cheese on top (by accident). The macaroni was a bit dry, but I used more pasta than recommended. Playing with proportions should solve for next time. Served with grilled hot dogs and steamed broccoli. Big hit all around.

This recipe is a great start, but the cheese sauce definitely benefits from a little doctoring. I add vermouth or white wine, a dash of cayenne, and a dash of Worstershire sauce. I play with the amounts until the sauce tastes right. It also helps to use the sharpest cheddar you can find. It is important to remember that pasta blands the sauce, so you need to give it some umph upfront.

I use sharp white vermont cheddar and also sprinkle some parmesian in w/ the bread crumbs. Besides adding a pinch of cayenne, like one reviewer suggested, I also add a pinch of nutmeg. This dish is a family and crowd pleaser.

I cut this recipe in half for two people. It had good flavor but it was awfully dry, and I used too much bread crumbs on top. I'd make it again, but I'd make the entire amount called for before scrapping this recipe.

I've used this recipe as the basis for my Macaroni & Cheese. I add a lot more cheese which consists of cheddar as well as American. The American really adds the creaminess & the cheddar gives it a little sharp flavor. I sometimes use Asagio or Fontina if I have it. Add a dash of cayenne pepper to the cheese sauce--really makes a difference.

Crunchy top crust was good. I admit that I used a little extra crumbs, cheese, and dotted it with butter. I don't think I seasoned the cheese sauce enough (to taste is a little vague for me, I need specifics : ) ) My husband, who hates pasta, loved it. Now that's proof that it is good!

I tried making this with mild cheddar first, and then used sharp cheddar the second time. It was much better with sharp cheddar. I also doubled the amount of fresh bread crumbs and it came out great.

I have to say I like kraft deluxe for my mac&cheese but I had a craving and had these ingredients, ---it's cooking----I used the whole 2 cups of sharp cheese in the sauce, it came up very well,---still waiting---I think it's just about done- nice, the pasta on top is crunchy, and the sauce had a chance to develop their flavors so I would make it again, except I still love Kraft Deluxe

This recipe is simple and very good. I am very picky when it comes to Mac & Cheese and this is great. It did, however, need more cheese than suggested, but because this recipe is so simple, it makes it extremely versatile. A definite keeper.

Good, basic recipe. Cheese sauce is easy. Fun to experiment with; Fontina cheese works well in place of cheddar and a can of diced tomatos with green chili's added w/the sauce makes for a good southwestern kick. Didn't have saltines to try as the young connosieur suggested, but Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix was really crunchy!

Dear Epicurious I thought this recipie was good but only with my modefications.My father makes this recipie ( I'm 11 years old) and adds crushed saltines to the top of the casserole, that's the only way to do It ! it makes them crispy and appetizing. Secondly , what's mac and cheese without paprika?! come on P.S. NO KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE !!!!!

Moist and creamy, not like the usual dry homemade Mac & Cheese
