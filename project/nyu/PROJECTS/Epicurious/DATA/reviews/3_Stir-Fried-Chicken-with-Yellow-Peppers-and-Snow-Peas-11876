I found this flavorful, but felt the oil and salt were heavy handed. 2 Tbs of oil and 1/2 tsp of salt are sufficient.

Yes, there is way too much of the vegetable oil but just enough of the sesame oil. But the rice vinegar took over the flavor, I will not add any of it next time and see if I like it better.

I skipped the ginger, scallion, and yellow pepper and this was still delicious. A real keeper. The only tweak I would suggest is cutting the salt in half. The soy makes it salty - no need for so much extra salt.

I added shitakes to the dish and it was great.

I made it exactly. While it was good it just wasn't that very exciting.

This will now be my basic stir-fry recipe. The sauce is just right and the chopped up ginger (rather than leaving it whole as many recipes suggest) lends zip. I used only @ 2T oil as the amount called for is excessive. I also added my own choice of vegetables: bok choy and mushrooms this time.

I think this recipe is fantastic, and have made it several times following the recipe exactly. I do use less oil, but I don't worry much about the excessive oil since I strain the chicken per the recipe - using only 2 tablespoons for the next step. The flavor is excellent, and the chicken is tender and fragrant after only 15 minutes in the marinade.

What a ridiculous amount of oil! Two tablespoons should be plenty. Apart from that a nice recipe in itself, but all of these dishes are in fact variations on Chop Suey, so nothing spectacular or new here. I prefer the Chop Suey recipe on this site (with a few adjustments).

I doubled this and found it too be quite bland. I wouldn't waste my time again.

I doubled the sauce, and added zucchini and a red pepper. I think way too much oil was used, and the sauce was rather sweet. I love sweet, but prefer a stir fry with a little kick. I kept adding soy sauce to my dish. I will not make this again, there are many other dishes to try.

I've made this twice and will make it again, but with some minor adjustments. There's no need for so much oil to cook the chicken; I found 3 tablespoons sufficient. And I omitted the salt (my soy sauce was not sodium-free and the chicken broth was salted). I used both yellow and red pepper for colour, served it over jasmine rice and topped it with finely chopped cilantro.

Very nice. I marinated for 4 hours and used sugar snap peas. It was wonderful. Love the leftovers.

Great new dish to add to our meal planning! I am just learning to cook (without a microwave or mac-n-cheese in a box) and this was very easy for me to do. Plus it tasted amazing!

This is a wonderful delicious dish the whole family just loved. I made it again the second time with zucchuni in adition to to the other veggies. The marinade is wonderful. Its quick, easy and full of healthy vegetables. We just love it!

This stir fry is terrific. Even the children liked it. Instead of using all that vegetable oil I used minimal amounts of butter and it was awesome. The fresh ginger was delicious, not too much or too little. This recipe will become a weekly meal at our house.
