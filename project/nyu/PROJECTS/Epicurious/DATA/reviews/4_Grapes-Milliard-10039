This was really easy to make. It's basically a lighter version of the breton dish "far," rather than a clafoutis (although clafoutis is pretty close to far anyway). I cooled the grapes in the freezer while I made the batter. I didn't bother to grease the pyrex dishes I baked these in and it was fine. Instead of Armagnac, I used amaretto.
