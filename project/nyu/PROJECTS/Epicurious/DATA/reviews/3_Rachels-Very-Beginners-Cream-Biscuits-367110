This was a super easy recipe. I am not a biscuit maker, but feel like I am now. No lard, no butter, no salt. Very fluffy.

These biscuits are incredibly simple; hardly more difficult than making cake from a mix. I'm not a highly experienced cook, but still had almost no trouble with these. They came out very tender and fluffy, and I probably didn't do them completely right. The next time I make them, probably tonight, I'll be sure to add the whole extra quarter cup of cream to make the dough easier to work with, and I'll fold it several times as opposed to just a couple. I could tell that with another fold or two, the biscuits will come out really well layered. I also didn't use a biscuit cutter the first time, instead cutting the dough into pieces and shaping it by hand. I bought a biscuit cutter and expect more uniform, attractive results the next time around.
