A great end to a great summer. Made this for pals and we loved it. As suggested: I added more garlic, more sausage & some chopped peeled plum tomatoes. I added a touch more wine mixed with some butter as I was serving this brothy dish over fresh linguine. Crusty bread is a must.

Fantastik!!!!This is the easiest / best mussel recipe out there.I've heard nothing but rave reviews from those I've served it to.The only changes I've made is adding 1 more sausage(3),double if not triple the garlic and add a couple coarsly chopped tomatoes(seeded).Also a very large fresh loaf of bread for dipping is a must!!!!NOTE*use quality sausage or results may be greasy

We did not like this recipe at all, and we generally love mussels and any kind of seafood chowder/soup/cioppino. The wine tasted sharp and uncooked, the sausage turned pale in the liquid and didn't add much flavor, and the rosemary was too strong a seasoning for this dish. Alas, not a keeper!

This was awful. Very greasy. Sausage and mussels just don't belong together.

This is a great quick recipe. I make this with Basil and Articoke Chicken sausage that I get from my local butcher. Don't use the hard sausage, the results are not as good. I like to let the mussels steam a minute or two after they open. That way, the mussels really get infused with a lot more flavor.

There are Mussels and there are Italian Sausages. This is a marriage that sadly, needs a divorce. The flavours of the mussels and the italian sausage do not compliment one another. At a table of six, all agreed that there are many other OUTSTANDING "epicurious" recipes for mussels or italian sausage that are most worthy of 4 forks. Gourmet, Bon Appetit we know that you can do better.

Wonderful!! Perfect for company. I did add one chopped tomato to the broth but you wouldn't need too.

This was tasty - be sure to use good quality sausage. My daughters love mussles and they don't like tomato, so this is a great recipe.

To the cook from Baltimore - the sausage is for flavor, the clams are the 'meat' of the dish. This is a great dish. By far my favorite way to prepare mussels!

2 links of sausage for 6 people??? That wouldn't feed the people I know.

My husband liked this but didn't go into raves as he frequently does with recipes I get from this site. I thought it was just palatable. I made it exactly to the recipe as I always do the first time but didn't find it had enough of something or other.......more garlic?.......maybe a little lemon? Don't know. Just didn't do it for me. Had a wonderful, fragrant aroma that filled the whole house, though. I will give it that!

awesome. there are a few spicy mussel dishes on this website that i have tried and truly liked but so far this the best. i added ginger, maybe a tsp, and omitted rosemary because i forgot, but i loved it. my wife really liked it also, but she preferred the recipe with the red pepper flakes more.

Yum. I added more sausage, but I only had sweet, so I added red chile flakes as well to spice it up. Added a can of chopped San Marzano tomatoes, some fennel pollen and doubled the shallot and garlic. I sauteed the bread crumbs in butter before service and mixed in some of the parsley. I had last minute surprise guests and only had 3 pounds of mussels, so I seared some scallops and prawns and added them at the last moment to the sauce. A hit.

I concur, this was awesome. I used the suggestions from cook in Toronto concerning the garlic and tomatoes and it turned out scrumptious. My husband and son both thought it should be served over pasta, so maybe next time. Enjoy!
