An excellent recipe, one I've made several times on holidays and other occasions. They are best the first and second day, however. But they seldom last after the third day anyway.

My friends liked it. I changed the temperature setting on the second batch to 275°F and baked it for 18-20 minutes - the cookies turned out perfectly done.
