1 out of 1 Elles approve this dish! I followed the recipe exactly with the following exceptions: - Added a chopped, crisped strip of bacon to each serving bowl. Delicious! - I used "live" watercress from Whole Foods and the flavor transcended beautifully from the stem, potato and onion puree. - Instead of black pepper, I used white.

This is a great base that you can do a lot of different things with. I sauteed red onion, carrot, garlic and dried thyme, then added some yukon gold potatoes. I had to use twice the amount of broth and about a cup of milk to thin it. I then topped it with shredded parmesan and micro greens, skipping the watercress and other herbs altogether. It was wonderful.

This only gets 2 forks. Very easy to make but seemed to be missing something. Didn't have any carrots or celery however I did have cheese and that added a little something. I cheated a little and added two strips of crushed bacon (from breakfast). Adding bacon to anything makes it good. I'll try this again. Does anyone know of an effortless technique for removing leaves from stems. Pulling them took me around 10-15 min and was quite tedious.

For some reason, mine was very bitter. Anyone have any idea why that might be?

I agree with Manchester - I found this too potato-y and didn't think the flavor of the watercress came through well. I served it warm, and it seemed like some kind of potato soup with a crunchy green in it. No spicy taste of the watercress. Not a bad soup but not the flavor I was expecting. Might try again with less potato.

We LOVED this soup! In all fairness, I tweaked the recipe because I had leftover watercress and mint salad that had been tossed with parmesan flakes and herb oil (served with lamb). Used homemade broth as I always have it handy in the freezer (make it when chicken is on sale). I also added about a half cup heavy cream that needed to be used up. Served it hot with a goat cheese encrusted crouton floating in middle. I would make it again the exact same way but will try the recipe as is next time.

Loved this soup. I'm not really a watercress lover, but this was delicious. I added extra parsley, thyme and milk to get the thickness I wanted. Sour cream on top was nice.

Unless it's fruit, I don't really enjoy cold soups, so I served this soup warm on a cool fall night with some homemade garlic/rosemary focaccia bread. The soup needed a little something, and I happened to have some Asiago cheese in the fridge, so I grated and sprinkled a little on top. Wonderful! My husband and I loved it.

The soup was way too thick, but I am going to make it again with less potato - I think I'll use about 1/2 pound. The soup wasn't really really tasty, so I think next time I make it, I'll add some more flavourings - like a bit of salt and some herbs. A major plus point is that it's so good for you with all that watercress!
