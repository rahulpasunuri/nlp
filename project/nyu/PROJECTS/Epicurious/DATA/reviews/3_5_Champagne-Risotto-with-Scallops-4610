This is my "go to" risotto recipe. It's easy and delicious. At times, I substitute the scallops with shrimp and it's just as yummie!

This is actually a perfect dish. The only thing that might be misleading is that, in keeping with typical risotto fashion, you add Champagne gradually and stir, and the same for the chicken broth. Make sure you use super-fresh scallops and definitely don't do without the Champagne. It doesn't have to be expensive Champagne but it should be dry and light (not rose or blanc de noir) since it'll add a bit of a tart taste to an otherwise rich dish. Really, really nice recipe.

Like many, I made some substitutions based on previous experience with risotto. I sauteed up from chopped bacon and reserved that before adding shallots and garlic with fresh sage instead of green onions. I followed the rest of the recipe as written, save for pan searing the scallops rather than adding them to the risotto. Delish!

I too made some additions: one clove of garlic while sauteing the scallions, a couple handfuls of baby spinach, and about 1/4 cup chopped bacon added after all the liquid was added. Finished with the seared scallops and their broth and of course, the cheese. Very creamy and flavorful, with color and interest. Quick enough for a weeknight but elegant enough for company.

Excellent! I added baby bellas too with the green onion and finished with a drizzle of truffle oil. Don't substitute or decrease the amount of champagne. If you cook this properly and for the correct amount of time you will only get a hint of champagne flavor.

I used shallots instead of green onions and although it was good, it seemed to taste too much like champagne. Now, I love champagne, but it was a bit much. I made double the recipe so I used 2 cups of champagne. Maybe that's why it was too much.

Just ok and wont make again. halfway through making this, I realized I had made it once before and wasn't wowed then either. I think it could benefit from more flavor (though I had added garlic, salt & pepper) and the parmesan at the end helps. I dont think green onions are the best, it might be a little better with shallots or regular onions caremelized a bit for flavor. Its not bad but I wasn't totally impressed either.

Excellent risotto with small revisions: I used the white and light green part of a leek instead of green onions, and I added 1/4 cup of diced yellow onion. I pan-seared the scallops to get the liquid out before adding them to the risotto. A drizzle of truffle oil to finish it off, and this dish will knock your socks off!

This recipe is fabulous! Easy risotto recipe comparing to other risotto recipes. It did impress our guests! I will be making it again and again. I did the same as some other cooks recommended here. Used garlic with the green onions and grilled the large scallops separately instead of putting them in the risotto. When presenting, I used a large deep bowl and put the risotto at the bottom, added a little bit of boston lettuce chiffonade on top of the risotto and then 4 grilled scallops. Finished with chopped fresh parsley and a drizzle of truffle oil. delicious.

This was incredible.. and quick! My first risotto ever, and this was so good, it's something I would have ordered if I were out. As a lot of people did, I seared the scallops, and used garlic because I didn't have any scallions. My husband loved it, and it will definitely be in our regular rotation. Very fun to make while enjoying a champagne cocktail.

I made this recipe as written in order to use up a small bottle of champagne, and it didn't appeal to me much. The flavor of the champagne was too strong.

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner. Combined it with a Lobster risotto from NYT 7/6/08 and made some of my own improvements. Made my own Lobster stock from the carcasses of 2 1.25 lb lobsters. Added the almost boiling stock a ladelful at at time to the risotto. Also added 1/4 cup of porcini mushrooms (rehydrated) and some chopped parsley at the end. Like other reviewers, I also pan seared the scallops rather than cooking them in the recipe. I chopped all but 6 (3 for each dish) and mixed the chopped scallops with the chopped lobster meat. I also recommend the addition of garlic and parsley. And a splash of dry vermouth into the stock brings up the flavors nicely. Overall, a fantastic recipe! Only wish I had made more!!

Loved it...ate both servings myself had to finish the champagne as well since the bottle was open anyway :) Will definitely cook it again.

Cooking the scallops in with the rice made the dish overall too 'fishy' for our taste. The champagne added some tang but regular white wine would have been adequate. Expensive ingredients & a lot of effort for a so-so result.

Rating: 3
My first attempt at risotto, the recipe worked well. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and served large seared scallops on top, added a tiny bit of garlic and fresh parsley. The parsley served well as a garnish to make the dish less monochromatic! It was nice drinking the leftover champagne with the meal too.

Great, delicious, easy risotto. Follow the other reviewers and add garlic, parsley... and, as I did, a few shakes of hot pepper flakes (to make it arrabiatta!) porcini mushrooms (i used dried, which i soaked in the chicken broth) and a bit of truffle oil. Wow, a superb dish.

I've made this twice. Really it's a good place to start for all kinds of risotto options. Most recently I added garlic, parsley and asparagus with loads of parm/reg at the end. Served it with arugula, fennel and red onion salad.

Made this dish for my family. I used a Korbel extra dry champagne, and it added a ton of flavor. The Rissotto was thick and creamy and perfectly cooked. I pan seared the scallops in olive oil seasoned only with salt and pepper.

My husband and I really enjoyed this one. Had it for Christmas dinner for two. Used jumbo scallops instead of bay and seared them and laid them atop the risotto. Didn't find the champagne as too rich or overpowering. Drank the open bottle with dinner as a matter of fact. I did cook the risotto by adding stock a ladle-ful at a time to allow it to do its thing. I found that I needed more stock doing it this way. Still very easy and wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

Amazing!! Only changes (not necessary I'm sure) I seared scallops & served them on top, browned the rice in the butter instead of only cooking 2 min, and doubled the parmesan. So incredibly good. My husband kept uttering little happy sounds the whole time he ate it.

This was very easy. I used it as a side dish for salmon, so I left out the scallops. Although if I make it as an entree I will us the scallops as I am sure that it will taste fabulous.

This was wonderful and easy though you do have to stir it often. I added a bit of garlic with the scallions and some pieces of asparagus when adding the scallops (threw in some shrimp as well) and it was really, really delicious. Used champagne that had been open a few days and that was fine.

Can't enter forks because I haven't made this yet, but I will make it tonight because of Pequot Lakes cook's review. Very funny! I will use white wine instead of champagne, garlic (lots) and I will sear the scallops and serve them on top. Thanks epicurious.

We made this the other nite sans scallops but with lobster tails. I increased the recipe to serve 8 and took down the amount (in half) of champagne per previous reviewers. Next time I won't cut it in half - we couldn't really taste it. I also added the liquid one ladle at a time - doubled the cheese, added parsley and asparagus tips. It turned out well.

This was a great dish for our anniversary dinner... and the rest of the champagne (and then some) was perfect to enjoy as we ate. I added mushrooms and extra cheese. Fabulous.

Great recipe. I made this as my starter course for valentine's dinner for 18 people. I did change it slighly in that I blackened the scallops and layered them over the risotto. The best part was I made the risotto the day before and when it came time to serve, it reheated nicely. Everyone loved it as the empty dishes were proof.

Love it! I have made this recipe countless times, refining it each time. First of all, the addition of garlic is a must. Next I added chopped fresh rosemary to the saute. My next rendition added sauteed mushrooms at the end. My latest rendition is to add sauteed radicchio as well. No matter what, it is always a hit.

I thought this was very good (my husband said 'Restaurant Quality') high praise indeed. I thought it needed chopped up mint so added a handful at the end - but I should have trusted the recipe - I think the mint overpowered the scallops. Quite fun guzzling the rest of the champagne as you cook - my type of recipe!!

It was good, but other risotto recipes are as good or better (and they don't require a bottle of champagne). I followed the recommendation of other reviewers and seared the scallops - definitely a good move.

Absolutely Wonderful for Parties I must say!! I ended up using more champagne and it tastes great. Just trust your taste palette when you adjust the amount of champagne and broth. Unless if you're a big fan of scallops, otherwise, they don't do much for this recipe. A drizzle of truffle oil was certainly a bright idea!

Great recipe, I've made this several times. Agreeing with the other reviewers, I massively cut down on the amount of champagne. Also, the key to good risotto is to stir CONSTANTLY. Finally, I rather enjoy searing scallops and laying them on top versus mixing them in if I have large fresh scallops. This is trivially easy to do, you can e.g. use the searing instructions here (ignore the part about the sauce of course): http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=106527

Yum, yum. Have made this several times and served to friends who licked their plates! One of the best risotto recipes in my collection. I did make several minor changes, which gives the dish some color. I added a bit of saffron and also sun dried tomato...maybe 1/4 c. And definitely drizzle the truffle oil before serving...worth the cost. Also, as a lover of Italian food...I NEVER add all of the liquid at the same time. A purist would tell you the secret to the creamy texture is to add the liquid in small batches and keep stirring. Love this website and have scored some real treasures here. And it's always so helpful to read the comments of other cooks who have already tried and experimented. Thanks Epicurious!

Excellent risotto! This is the second type of risotto I've made; this one is different in that you add all the broth at once rather than a little at a time. Texture/consistency was perfect even though I doubled the recipe for guests. Cooking time was probably a little longer. Just judge by the look and the taste. It should be creamy but have a little bite to it. I substituted salmon pieces for the scallops and added asparagus tips. Very satisfying!

Fantastic risotto recipe. I found the cooking times off (had to cook much longer) to achieve a rich, creamy texture. Once you think it is done, add a tad more liquid and cook a few minutes longer. Also great with white wine instead of champagne. Just as tasty if you double the recipe. Make sure to use high quality parmesan.

My best friend made this dish for Valentine's Day. She doubled the recipe and was very disappointed. I was able to taste the leftovers the next day. She was right. This recipe shouldn't be doubled.

I made a few changes in this recipe, primarily because of ingredients I had on hand. I used Chardonnay instead of Champagne and large shrimp instead of scallops. I always cook Risotto in a pressure cooker....so fast and easy and foolproof. I cooked the shrimp in shell separately, peeled them, then added it to the finished Risotto just before serving. (It would be overcooked if I did in in the pressure cooker.) Also....most important...I drizzled White Truffle Oil over the finished dish just before serving, as I think it adds the perfect and elegant touch! I sprinkled chopped fresh Parsley on top for a bit of color. If you like this....try the Truffled Lobster Risotto also available on Epicurious! It is to die for!

I made this for my sweetie for Valentine's Day & was pleased by (1) how easy and (2) how tasty it was. Served on beds of asparagus roasted with olive oil and lemon, it was an elegant, simple meal that fit the holiday perfectly. I did add a little more champagne and less broth for liquid, but other than that went pretty closely to the recipe. Since then I've made this dish a couple of other times with extra touches and using a dry white wine instead of champagne - most recently with criminis and snow peas, sauted beforehand and added just before serving. Freshness is an absolute MUST for the scallops!

Easy and delicious. I also added 2 tsp. truffle oil at the end - really completed the dish nicely. Be careful adding liquid near the end of cooking. The rice needs to be the proper consistency before you add the scallops. If you add too much broth, you'll end up overcooking the scallops when you try to boil it off. (-:

Lucky for us that we opened a flat bottle of Mumm DVX on Christmas. We saved it and I searced Epicurious for Champagne and found this incredible recipe. I used Sea Bass instead of scallops. I quickly sauted bass in champagne (bit of olive oil), browned and then baked 400' oven for 10 minutes (1 inch bass). I topped the risotto with the bass. All this, and easy, too!!

I've made this recipe 3 times this month alone! My friends and family all raved about it and they have widely different tastes.
