As written this is a two fork recipe. I gave it three forks because it's MUCH better with a few additions. I sauted about 4 cloves of garlic with the onion, tripled the amount of cumin, and added an equal amount of curry powder. However, the one thing that made the most difference was adding a couple handfulls of baby carrots while blending the soup. With these additions the soup was quite good.

Yummy, healthy and SUPER-easy! I liked it even more hot. Next time I may throw in some other veggies like carrots.

All I have to say is: DANG. Nice soup. It's great as written, warm or cold. It got rave reviews from some very scrutinizing ladies. Try it! Don't be afraid of the yogurt--it's better with it in.

Deliciuos! I added tomatoes and carrots based on another reviewers suggestion. I also sauted garlic with the onion and added a teaspoon of whole cumin seeds.

This is a fantastic soup! And a great thing to do with those zucchini that grow too big for anything else. We made a few changes: used Consorzio garlic olive oil, increased the amount of cumin to 1T, added 1/2T biber (turkish red peper flakes, if you can't find it, domestic will do), added a kafir lime leaf, increased the yogurt to 1C and blended it in (right in the soup pot with an immersion blender as suggested above.)

This soup is delicious! I added a few tomatoes and carrots, and used green & purple basil leaves. It's good chilled or heated. My family loved it!

This soup was easy to make, delicious, and low fat as well! I had to increase the amount of seasoning, as it came out too bland for our taste. Instead of transfering the soup to the blender, I used a drink hand mixer right in the soup pot and it worked fine. I added the yogurt to the soup instead of using it as a garnish.

This was EXCELLENT! Easy to make, tastes even better the next day. Was nice and thick and very flavorful. Serve it with a dollop of tangy plain yogurt. I love chilled soups -- this one had tons of flavor for very few ingredients. My boyfriend, however, ate it (twice!) but isn't a huge chilled soup fan.
