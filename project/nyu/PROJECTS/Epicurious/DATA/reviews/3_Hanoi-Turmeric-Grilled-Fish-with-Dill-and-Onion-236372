Agree with jfain that cutting back on fish sauce is probably a good idea (I did but to 2/3 recipe), and I further sweetened w. a bit of honey. Also ignored the last part about the cast iron pan and used a stove-top grill to cook fish... to excellent results. The combinations of flavors this dish offers up will make this a go-to for me. :P

I enjoyed this recipe but found it incomplete. At the end of the recipe it tells you to but the pan on the grill but doesn't tell you what to do with the pan. I put some oil in it and grilled my onions and then put if on the fish. I then plated the fish over the vermicelli noodles and sprinkled with dill. I thought the amount of fish sauce was perfect once you diluted with water.

This was very tasty and healthy. The only change I made was to cut the fish sauce for the dresssing in half. We like fish sauce to be the the je ne se que in a recipe. We don't like to be banged over the head with it. cut in half it was the perfect amount.
