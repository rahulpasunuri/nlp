Ah! I wrote Bartlet but they were Anjou pears.

Rating: 4
This was for a crowd at Christmas. Extremely well received by guests. Made 8 tenderloins, just browned and then sliced the whole tenderloins. The Bartlet pairs were a little less ripe than I would have eaten them out-of-hand but browned beautifully (skipped the small amount of sugar) and held together which surprised me - I was sure they would go to sauce before they browned. Somehow my pear brandy was not on the shelf when I reached for it (I guess it was pretty tasty) so used regular brandy. I had some diced pancetta in the fridge so I browned that and tossed it in as well. Applesauce had to stand in for the pear nectar. For the 8 tenderloins I made two batches of the sauce and pears and poured that over the sliced meat in two baking dishes. Held one in the oven while the other went out on the buffet. Given the alterations, on taste alone I would have gone with 3 forks - still a solid, yummy recipe - but added the last fork for its holding power and flexibility on ingredients. Next time I will also add more or fresh thyme. I would recommended this to friends looking for something either for a fancy dinner or a buffet and will consider making it again when I get more pear brandy and can do it right.

This is ambrosia. I made it exactly as written, using Mathilde Poire Liqueur. However, as noted in other reviews the pears didn't brown but rather released a lot of liquid and became quite soft. I'll try not so ripe ones next time but it didn't affect the heavenly flavor.

Substituted Pear Vodka for the brandy. Made it for a large group (50)served it family style with the pork shingled around a large shallow bowl, poached pears in middle, and sauce over the pork. Fantastic!

Made it with apples and Calvados....absolutely delicious. Have made it several times for guests always gets rave reviews. Did try the pear version but found it too sweet. My Dad is not a big pork fan but he loved it. Have made this ahead to the point of adding cream to sauce( I put cooked meat in a foil sealed pan in a warm oven and it remained very moist) When entertaining I like things (mostly) prepared before the guests arrived. This worked out very well for a fall dinner party with date pudding for dessert.

This was a great recipe and a definite crowd-pleaser. It tastes like it was more difficult to pull off than it really was! I brined the tenderloin for about 10 hours and then seared it and baked whole, instead of slicing and sauteeing as the recipe directs. Also I used pearsauce (you know, like applesauce, but pears) in place of the pear nectar and regular brandy instead of pear brandy. The meat was moist and flavorful and the sauce was to die for. Next time I'll try to get more of a crispy sear on the pears, or dice them up smaller for a sort of chutney, or else skip them entirely. Served with roasted asparagus and chardonnay - a great meal.

I love this easy impressive subtle entree. One change: I make it with a whole tenderloin and slice before arranging on plates. Also, if you find the sauce too sweet, chicken broth can be substituted very nicely for the pear nectar (I prefer the broth).

Followed the recipe as written except I just sliced the tenderloin on a bias to get 1/4" medallions and I used Apricot brandy instead of pear (wasn't available at the liquor store and I was running out of time). Delicious. Next time, I'll try it on a pork chop. Thinking a pear chutney might be an option.

This recipe is to die for. The 7% who wouldn't make it again didn't try the finished product. The flavors blend with vigorous subtlety, like exquisite sex on the beach. Indeed, have one of those beforehand, and you can't go wrong.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and we love it. I buy the pear brandy because it smells so good, like the essence of pears. My kids keep opening the bottle to smell it, too. I adapted per several comments: brined, roasted whole, rolled in chopped herbs (parseley and thyme). And I didn't peel the pears (bartletts).

Rating: 4
This is one of the very best meals I have made from this website. I couldn't find pear brandy so I "liquified" a canned pear in my blender and added it to regular brandy. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with a side of Israeli couscous, mounded in the center along side the pears. It was our New Year's Eve dinner and absolutely fabulous!

Rating: 4
OMG, so delicious! My changes were to use apple schnapps instead of pear brandy because I am cheap and apple nectar instead of pear because I couldn't find it. Only one concern. My pears turned pretty soft and had a lot of liquid after cooking on high 8 minutes. They never really got a caramelized look or texture, but they still tasted great with the pork. I adore pears and wish I could have found the pear nectar and afforded the brandy to see how different it would be. My husband really liked this recipe too. I'm already trying to think of occasions when I need to make something that seems difficult, but really isn't. Love to show off and this one makes it easy ;-) Wonderful!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe with a few changes. For the pears I used 2 tsps. of sugar because I like things sweet. Based on an almost identical recipe in a local magazine and the other reviewers comments on the lack of color in the dish, I used 1/2 cup chopped chives instead of the shallots and 2 tsps. fresh thyme, not dried. Amazing!!

Rating: 1
I was excited to try this after the rave reviews. I thought it was boring. I ended up adding some nutmeg and Dijon mustard to the bland sauce which helped, but still, * yawn*. My kids said the pears were like pie filling and my beloved and I thought they were like applesauce only with pears. Not worth all the effort.

Rating: 4
My family now asks that I double the sauce ingredients in this recipe so they can dip their bread. The combination of shallots, pear and thyme really does a great job of setting off the taste of the pork. Great recipe for a small dinner group up to 10.

Rating: 4
Delicious and simple if you don't go through the steps of slicing and pounding the tenderloin. I browned mine with the herb mixture and then transferred to the oven to finish cooking. That way I still had the yummy pan juices to make the sauce. I used 3/4 c chicken broth + 1/4th c heavy cream to lighten up on the calories and the sauce turned out great. I would not sub the pear brnady for triple sec as some have suggested--totally different flavor. My family loved it and it was easy enough for a weeknight meal that tasted more like a gourmet meal.

Rating: 4
Fantastically easy and delicious. I made this dish in just over 30 minutes using our own home-grown pears. (Move over, Rachel Ray!) I reduced cream to half as suggested by other reviewers, and substituted Triple Sec for the pear brandy. I'll make this again soon.

Rating: 4
Excellent as written. The second time I tried this, I used canned pears and they were quick and easy. If you can't find pear nectar, try blending a bit of canned pear/juice together. Half and half works well and cuts the calorie count just a bit.

Rating: 4
Thought this was excellent. I would use less cream next time to give the sauce a stronger flavor. I also roasted the tenderloin whole (as it was a dinner party for 10, so a fair amount of meat) and to add my own twist, I rubbed the meat down with Cinnamon, salt and pepper before roasting.

AH-MAY-ZING!! This is so good, it's unreal. Followed the recipe precisely.

This was a hit with 5 teens. I had to make sure I sat down before they started with seconds. I splurged on the pear brandy and it was amazing, even the fragrance was just pure pear-i-ness. The sauce was delicious - I wanted to lick my plate. Briend and roasted the tenderloins whole, and could only find ripe Bartletts - they were fine.

Rating: 4
a great recipe - i can't keep it out of my mouth. worth every minute.

My friends love this recipe, and ask me to make it whenever they come for dinner. When I'm pressed for time, I'll just roll the tenderloin in chopped herbs and then roast it, rather than cooking slices in batches. I've also substitute grand marnier or dessert wine for the pear brandy in a pinch, and it's tasted just fine.

I made this recipe for xmas dinner for 18 people: everyone loved it! Suggestions/cautions for cooking for a large group: 1.I brownded and cooked two 5 lb. pork tenderloins (@1 hour @ 350) and added sauce to pour over cut servings, which worked fine; 2. A word of caution about cooking for a large group: the pears do not become "deep golden" if they are crowded in a pan. Cook them in smaller batches (cooking 8 pears in a large skillet was too many pears). I added dried cranberries to the sauce to help add a color contrast, which was very effective and did not change the wonderful pear flavor. Enjoy!

This is one of my all time favorite company recipes. It is unusual, absolutely delicious and not too difficult to prepare.

Rating: 0
Fabulous! Prepared 3 tenderloins roasted whole for a crowd of 8. Prepared the meat per American Test Kitchen's directions...brined for an hour in 2 qt water/.25 cup sugar/.25 cup salt. Browned meat in oil then roasted for 12 minutes in a 450 degree oven to temp of 135 (God bless instant read thermometers!) Put sauce in roasting pan to soak up last bit of goodness and let it sit in the warm oven while the meat rested. Rosy, moist meat sliced thick.

Well, WOW! This was a recipe I had been looking at as I actually had some pear brandy and love pears with pork. This came together in about 45 minutes and was just lovely. I did season the pork cutlets with salt and pepper plus a bit of natures seasonings spice blend and added some fresh parsley to finish the sauce. I gave the pears just a light dusting of nutmeg as it complements the pork. Yummy with parsley and garlic new potatoes and salad of spring mix with fresh pear and gorgonzola cheese. Pour a nice glass of Pinot Noir and enjoy!

"Honey, you can make this recipe any time you want to." That's what my husband said when I asked if he wanted this again. I've already rated this, but had to add this rave review. Delicious and easy!

Rating: 4
Delicious and interesting. Several pears and a pint of cream were languishing in my fridge after a dinner party, so I was looking for a Monday night dinner to use up these leftovers. This was simple enough for mid-week and delicious enough to justify the calories. I used good quality brandy and thought it sufficed. The sauce's color was that of old dishwater, so I added yellow and orange bell peppers as the side. They served to cut the richness of sauce and pork as well as give color. Will make it again!

Rating: 1
I use a simple formula to determine if I will make a recipe again. Hands on time + $ + mess must be less than the family approval rating. This recipe failed. The cost of the ingredients and number of dirty pots and pans plus the prep work involved simply didn't have enough of a taste payout on the table. It certainly wasn't bad, just not great enough for the trouble.

Rating: 3
I was unwilling to pay $35 for pear brandy as well, but I did substitute the pear brandy with 1/2 brandy, 1/2 Calvados (b/c I already had this). I think this worked equally as well. Being big on presentation, I don't think that the colors created in this meal were as "delicious" as the taste. Lots of neutral colors in my opinion. Meat was really tender though, even more so than pork tenderloin usually is.

Fabulous! We have a pear tree, and I'm always looking for recipes using pears. This was absolutely delicious. I used half & half rather than whipping cream, and didn't have pear nectar, so I poured the liquid off of the cooked pears and added that to the sauce. Lovely.

I would not pay $35 for pear brandy and used plain ol brandy and it turned out fine. My pears were not ripe, just about there so they held up their shape just fine and tasted great. I would make this again, only because it comes together fast once you get the pears done. I used two pans and kept cooking the pears as I made the pork and sauce so everything came out at the same time hot. Will make again for dinner party because it looks and tasted great.

Rating: 3
Well, this was good, but after the reviews I was expecting something with a little more WOW. The sauce is pretty delicate, so be sure to fully season the pork and the sauce w/ salt & pepper. The main thing I didn't like about it is that the final dish is all the same color. Next time I will brighten it up with some chopped parsley to finish. Good...but not out of this world.

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious. It was my first time making it and had to substitute regular onion for the shallots and clavados (apple brandy) for pear brandy. I thought it was very easy to prepare and cooked quickly. The pork had great flavor and I enjoyed the pears with each bite of pork.

I definatly impressed the inlaws with this one. Just follow the recipe and your tastebuds will be very happy. Use ripe anjou pears and dont forget to peel them. You can find Pear Nectar in the Spanish isle at your grocery store. I used the left over pear brandy to mix with hot apple cider and that was great as well. Enjoy.

One of my favourite pork loin recipes. I've made it a couple of times, and if you get ripe Anjou pears, I find you really don't need the sugar, the Pears will carmalize just fine without it.

Fabulous dish. I used very firm pears and increased the sugar to 1.5tsp, the pears caramelized beautifully and kept their shape. Used regular brandy. Not too sweet, it was just perfect.

What happened to mine? I was so excited to make this based on the reviews and it was TERRIBLE! The sauce had so many shallots that they completely overpowered. The taste of the sauce was weird. The carmelized pears were a big soggy sticky mess (they tasted OK, but were ugly). The only saving grace about this recipe was that the pork was very tender. Once I scraped off the sauce, it was edible. I would definitrly NOT make this again, expecially when there are so many fantastic tenderloin recipes on this website.

Rating: 4
I got this recipe (with a few differences) from a cooking class I took recently and it is absolutely delicious! My husband thought it was the best pork tenderloin he'd ever had. The recipe I used called for two 1 lb. pork tenderloins that you browned whole in 1 tblsp butter and then roast at 375 for 25 - 30 minutes (until it gets to internal temp of 155). Then, let it rest for 7 minutes before slicing. Everything else was the same. So yummy!

Rating: 4
Well, if you want to put a new twist on this dish try substituding apple juice for the pear juice and Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum for the brandy! Talk about rich, creamy and warm! Wow, this one is a winner. Last touch I did was to top it with a little crumbled gorganzola cheese.

I made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews! I couldn't find pear brandy so I used regular light brandy and more pear nector and since it was d'lish, I think the substitution worked. Then I served it with glazed pearl onions and roasted rosemary fingering potatoes and the combination of sweet, tart and creamy really worked! Oh and paired it with a German reisling. Yum!

This was delcious and very easy to prepare. I used canned pears in light syrup in place of fresh, peach schnapps in place of the pear brandy and didn't put in thyme. Very nice with a Sterling chardonnay.

Rating: 4
This is a phenomenal dish. I've made it before with apples and Calvados, but this recipe outshines it by a mile. The pears with the sauce are so concentrated and velvety. I let the pears carmelize at low heat for about 30 min (until very golden brown), therefore needed to add the pork back to the sauce to reheat before serving. Got the good pear brandy for entertaining but for weeknights will probably substitute as others have. Our guests loved it, and were scraping the sauce from the platter!

Rating: 4
We really liked this dish--there were no leftovers. I used the amaretto instead of pear brandy because I couldn't find pear brandy and I left out the pear nectar. Bearing in mind the bland color people have commented on I used Starkrimson pears which kept their color. The sauce was great and the pears were fantastic but another time I'd only make one or the other because both were overkill. Served with snowpeas and parmesan potatoes.

I served this dish to company and everyone liked it. I did it all ahead except for the cooking of the pork. I seared it first then baked it wrapped in foil. I served it with garlic roasted red potatoes and green beans with lemon and nuts. I had tried this dish before and served it over mashed potatoes and it lost all it's sauce flavor and was colorless.The pork was much better served alongside the potatoes with sauce drizzled on the meat. I will make this again.

This is so amazing it's been written into my best recipes notebook. I used apples as I had no ripe pears, with some Pommelle apple liqueur I found at Trader Joes, and the only nectar I had on hand was mango. After months of keeping an eye out I finally located some Mexican Jumex Pear Nectar at a Super-Target, so next time I'm definitely trying the pear pork version. I added about a Tbsp of sugar rather than a tsp.; took about 30 minutes for the apples to carmelize just a little, but otherwise followed the recipe. Unbelieveable for so little work!

This is an unbelievable dish. I've made it over and over - have used boneless thin-cut pork chops and it's just as delicious and easier than using the mallot on the tenderloin. I also substituted Frangelico liqueur for pear schnapps and jarred pears to cut the time so I can make it during the week - still turns out perfectly.

Wow! Everyone was impressed. I am a beginner in cooking and this was EASY yet had FINE DINING quality all over it. If you enjoy sweet meats, this is the one to choose. I, too, substituted peach schnapps for the pear schnapps and could find no pear nectur. And the pears took more time than the recommended 8 minutes. Nevertheless, the sauce and everything else turned out delicious. I recommend this to anyone that wants something easy and delicious!

Is this the BEST recipe, or what? I made it for a dinner party and it was awesome and very unique. I made everything in advance and reheated it all before assembling/plating it. After the guests left, my husband asked me for the recipe and I handed it over to him. The next day, when I asked him what he wanted for dinner, he said, "The same thing as last night!" He had already purchased the ingredients from the list. That was easy! This recipe truly earns the 4-fork status.

I made this as described except for the brandy, for which I substituted Butter Shots butterscotch schnapps as suggested (we've had a bottle hanging around since someone brough it to a party ages ago!) It was delicious and received wonderful reviews from my husband and guests. I found the pear nectar in the spanish foods section at the supermarket. I served it with buttered egg noodles. I do agree with a previous reviewer about the dish's lack of color. I ended up adding some sauteed carrots to the platter to brighten it up. Would definitely make this again!

I did a modified version of this, but I started with the pears, the pear brandy, and fresh thyme, so it seemed to be a natural. I didn't have pear nectar, so I added more brandy. And I added just a quarter-cup light cream. It took about 20 minutes to make (I started the pork as soon as the pears were starting to get brown), and it was delicious.

I made this dish for company and it was delicious. I have now made several versions using different fruits and nectars. The best was mango and mango nectar, I used mango vodka instead of the pear brandy. For those who can't find nectars subsitute a jar of baby food. Add additional liquid to make up for the thicker consistency. Also delicious with chicken breasts.

Great comfort food. Clear pear brandy is worth the effort to find. Fruit nectar is easier to find now - just look in the juice section of your local store or maybe in the organic foods section. French cooks have always matched the fruit nectar and the brandy for the best - and most intense flavor.

My fiance and I loved this. I can't wait to make this for a dinner party! ButterShots worked great for us. Probably won't bother with the pricey Brandy - I can't imagine anything tasting any better. We served it with oven-roasted asparagus and red potatoes mashed with Boursin cheese, milk, salt and pepper. A perfect meal. My question, and I pardon my ignorance, is: where do we find this pear nectar? In the juice section of the grocery? By the canned fruit? At a gourmet market? My fiance called from Harris Teeter saying that they don't carry the nectar. I'm wondering if he just didn't see it... We ended up using the syrupy liquid in the canned pears. It worked fine! But can anyone answer this for me? thanks.

I made this recipe using the butterscotch schnappes, as suggested by several other reviewers. Since the schnapps were so sweet, I added 1/2 tsp. of white pepper to offset it. I made the pears and the sauce ahead of time (I was taking the entree to a potluck dinner), and I seared the pork loin, so that it could cook in the oven once we arrived. The recipe is delicious, and would be best served with something excessively savory and of contrasting color, since the sauce and the pork are so beige in color, and the sauce is very, very sweet. I actually made the same sauce (minus the sage) and served it over crepes to rave reviews.

Wonderful! I made this for the first time for my family's New Year's Eve dinner, in an attempt to get rid of some of those gift-basket pears. My father and brother are incredibly picky eaters, and they've asked that I make this every time I come home. The sauce is just excellent!

Fantastic - entire family of 5 went nuts (including some picky eaters). Suspicious of any pan fried pork (always tough), I oven-roasted my tenderoin wrapped in foil for 1 hour . Added pork juices, more brandy, less cream to the reduction. Excellent presentation - perfect for guests.

I used this recipe to make a pork loin with the pears stuffed inside and served it sliced with the sauce on top.

So very yummy! 18% cream works too, if whipping cream seems too decadent. Poire William is a fine brand of pear brandy.

I didn't love this dish. It was a little bland. I think it would be better to cook the pork in the oven. I also wouldn't use the eau de vie again. It's not very flavorful, and the resulting sauce was bland. I've seen the buttershots recommendations on this site. That might ad some flavor. The saving factor of the recipes was the pears. If you had them with the pork, they gave the flavor that the sauce lacked. I've read all the great reviews of this dish, but I just wasn't that impressed.

Rating: 4
Okay, first of all this recipe was one of the best I have found on Epicurious, and I use it a lot. The pear brandy is really worth the search because it was delicious and not too sweet. Also, generously pepper the pork to give the sauce a nice contrast of flavor. This was better than most fare I have had at restaurants, simple too.

Very good recipe. I substituted calvados for the pear brandy (went very well with the sauce). To my opinion it is not at all too much work (as other reviewers claimed) and the result was well worth it. I prepared the pears and the sauce about an hour in advance and when the guests arrived I quickly pan fried the meat and served with the sauce and pears.

This is one of my favourite recipes. It's worth the search and cost of pear brandy. I wouldn't change a thing. Everyone I serve this to raves about it and wants the recipe.

I waited until I made this dish a second time before I decided to submit my review. I used Buttershots both times and have to say, this dish is magnificant. I did not find the pear preparation time consuming at all. When we entertain (which is quite often), we try our best to prepare as much as we can ahead of time. Both times, we peeled, sliced and sauteed the pears until they were barely soft but not caramelized. Then, once we were ready to sear the meat and prepare the cream sauce, we turned up the heat on the pears and caramelize them then. The timing was perfect. I really appreciate reading all the reviews on this recipe. I don't think I will bother with eau de vie as we enjoy the butterscotch flavour so much. It's unusual and we have received rave reviews.

I served this dish for my dinner club and got rave reviews! The dish is a bit time comsuming with the pears but I feel is well worth the time. Pear brandy is hard to get but I managed to get some. The buttershots is a bit sweet - maybe try half and half. Garlic mashed potatoes and green beans almondine are a perfect accompaniment. I made this twice and will make it again!

I agree with the other person from Hamilton, this recipe was a lot of work and only so so results. I have made many pork tenderloin recipes and this did not come close to some of my favorites and yet I worked really hard at it. I am wondering if the success lay in the liquor, I used what the recipe called for the 'eau de vie' (that will be difficult to use up; costly and wayyyy too boozey for my liking). Maybe a sweeter more schnapp like liquor would make me like it more. But overall an expensive dissapointment.

This recipe is in my view is more trouble than it is worth. The pears are fairly time consuming to prepare and by the time I was ready to serve they needed to be reheated again. The sauce was also very heavy, too much cream for my liking.

What a great dish! Couldn't get Pear Brandy so substituted Ameretto and it was great! We used a rub on the tenderloin and let it stand in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Instead of preparing at the last minute when our guests were here we did some of the preparation a few hours ahead: we cut it, pounded it, and seared both sides for a minute and sealed it in foil. Before serving, we baked it for 40 min. @ 325 degrees. You could cut it with a fork and we had rave reviews from our guests!

Fantastic dish. I did substitute buttershots for the brandy. I would definitely make it again again. The next time will be for more people. Terrific with Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay.

This was soooo good! My guests asked for seconds. I used fresh thyme instead of the dried and doubled the amount. It was exceptional. I also served this with Jo's roasted garlic mashed potatoes (I increased the butter in the mashed potatoes a little bit) and green beans almondine. The almonds and the pears compliment each other well.YUM!!!!

I made this using the Buttershots instead. What a good recommendation. It turned out delicious. Next time, I will roast the tenderloin in the oven, then slice it to serve. A great dish!

I absolutely adore this recipe. I've made it about four times now and it never fails to taste great and impress the company! It is a bit of work but I always savor the outcome.

We have a very popular BBQ Restaurant which is being increasingly asked to cater off-menu. One such event was just last weekend for 100 women including our Oklahoma First Lady and the Lt. Governor. Smoked Pork Tenderloin was the entree with this pear brandy cream sauce accompanying. We also substituted Buttershots Schnapps (OK doesn't seem to even allow Pear Brandy in...) and pureed the pears. . .too many to try to handle for 100 servings....they weren't missed a bit with the pork tenderloin and added a nice balance to the flavors of the sauce. MANY said it was the best food - and not just banquet food - they've ever had!

I made this for Christmas dinner for my family and everyone loved it. It was defintely exceptional. For a dessert to finish it off though I again started cooking more sliced pears with sugar and butter. Once the pears had achieved somewhat fried looking sides I removed them from the pan, spooned off some of the butter and added some pear brandy and pear nectar. I reduced the sauce until it began to carmelize and then poured it over the sliced pears which I had someone else arrange atop individual bowls of vanilla ice cream. Christmas dinner was certainly memorable this past year.

This was fantastic. Due to price of pear brandy, I also substituted the buttershots. I made this with Joe's Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes. A great dinner. My friends were fighting over last few pieces. I rarely make a dish twice, but this will definitely stay in my file for another time. I think I will try with chicken breast next time.

We have used this recipe with pork chops and it works very well with them as well. Makes a very nice meal for company. Has the components of meat with gravy served with an unexpected light flavor.

The recipe went together rather easy. I could not find a resonabily priced pear brandy (other than "Pear William"!!). The first time I made it I substuted "ButterShots" Schnapps for the pear brandy..it was EXCELLENT. The little shot of butterscotch was great. The next time I used regualr brandy. I like the ButterShots better, so did my guests. I dressed the plate with mint leaves and fanned strawberries to add some color. Served it with Roasted Garlic mashed potatoes and Spagheti Squash. And I served a a Clos Du Bois Pinot Noir (1996) with it, (I perfer Reds).
