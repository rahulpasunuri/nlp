After trying another lebkuchen recipe, I gave this one a shot. THIS is what I was looking for. It is very similar to the Schmidt & Sohne lebkuchen that I have been rationing for weeks. This is a very authentic recipe, and absolute delicious. I did, however, use a lebkuchen spice mix that I got from about.com. Fabulous!

These are truly better with age. We make huge batches and store in a popcorn tin with an apple. Great recipes!

My dad was born in Germany and Mom always made these cookies every year for the holidays. This recipe was great, although I couldn't find the type of candied fruit that I like, so I made it. They really do taste better after a week or so, with an apple in the cookie jar!!

Made these for my Christmas cookie plates and they were a big hit. I had to change a couple of things due to inavailability at the stores. First, no rice paper. Second, for the candied fruit, I used 1/3 candied citron, 1/3 candied ginger and 1/3 maraschino cherries that I dried out in paper towels. The end result, spice cake meets fruit cake cookie.

I made these a few times around Christmas...everyone loved them! I even had a friend from Germany try them, and she said they reminded her of walking through the streets of her hometown in Germany.

I made these a few Christmases ago and my father-in-law, who is a native of Germany, loved them and told me they tasted authentic. I think they are ideal with a cup of coffee or tea --a sort of German biscotti!

Great! Taste like the cookies I ate in Germany. They are supposed to be dry (but not like toast), light, spicy and flavourful. They are a nice change from the over-the-top gooey things. I froze them with good results - next time I will try squirrelling them in a tin to see how the flavours improve.

While these are quite taste cookies, they are hardly authentic lebkucken. Their texture is far too light. The hazelnuts are overbearing and do not allow the flavor of the spices to come through.

The only cookies that i have made and turned out right. They will be my christmas special. Thanks for the Recipe. Niamh.

This will be the third year I am making it. This recipe brings back the childhood memories of the Lebkuchen my grandmother received from family in Germany. Instead of rice paper I use 50 mm Back-Oblaten from Kuchle.

This cookie is delicious. Super moist and spicy, they are best after storing in an airtight container for a couple of weeks, if you can handle knowing they're hanging out in the cupboard without wanting one. I also tried freezing some and they were ok. Instead of the 1/2 C citron, etc, I used 1/4 C finely diced homemade candied orange peel. I also spread a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom of the cookie. I think these are better than Bahlsen!

Unfortunately the Lebkuchen turned out to be very dry and hard and I am now going to feed it to the birds! Maybe it needs less flour and more eggs - but even the flavor was not as good as the Lebkuchen you can find in Germany.

This recipe was fabulous! Just like the Bahlsen (sp?) bags I buy every year. Few things I mention I don't like chunks of citronat, so I pulse them in the cuisinart to small pieces. I also add a bit of orange peel. When storing, add a curl of apple peel in the tin to keep cookies fresh. Great!
