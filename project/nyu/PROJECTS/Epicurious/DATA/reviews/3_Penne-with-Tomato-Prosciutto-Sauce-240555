this is an awesome traditional dish from Italy. The way to make it taste awesome is to use fresh compari tomatoes, and really, no sugar is needed. I do this from scratch all the time and simply put olive oil in a pan, add garlic and onion, then prosciutto. When the prosciutto is cooked a little I add cut up juicy tomatoes, usually compari. My friends all rave and are made when I make this and they didn't come over for it. I also prefer to use spaghetti! Yummy!

This was fine, but I'm not tempted to make it again. There are so many wonderful things to do with penne and prosciutto that I'd rather expend efforts in another direction.

It was very good, but no herbs? I added parsley. Next time I'll add red pepper flakes as well. Remeber to cook one day prior.
