I added freshly chopped cilantro instead of parsley. Love, love love this recipe!!! And everyone I have served it to loved it also. First made this dish about 15 years ago when it was featured in Gourmet magazine. Superb...and I use all of the ingredients. CKB in Laguna Beach

Deciding between multiple Epicurious linguine and shrimp recipes, I created the following simplification of this recipe: take out the fennel, bell pepper, saffron, and parsley. Add the canned tomatoes with tomato paste and chicken broth. Add a 1/2 cup chopped basil with the spinach and shrimp. Top with Parmesan. Although I'm sure this recipe is delicious in its original form, if you are short on ingredients this modification is also pretty good!

For a delicious stock you can try the one GFS carries. It is expensive but great. It is called a seafood base.

I made this dish at random, to use up some cupboard items. Based on what I had on hand, I replaced the shrimp with calamari, the yellow pepper with a green pepper, the white wine with rice wine and used all fish stock. This was a really delicious combination, and I look forward to making it again! One thing though- I used "Kitchen Basics" brand fish stock, and thought it smelled *disgusting* while cooking, even though it was great in the end. Can anyone recommend a good, trusted brand for commercial fish stock?

This really was delicious. We feel fennel is essential. Without it, the dish would lack flavour. We used our own homemade fish stock in place of the chicken stock, and feel it added an extra flavour boost. Fantastic color!

My family loved it. Unfortunatley, couldn't find fennel at our grocer so we probably didn't get the full effect, but I really can't imagine it getting much better. Absolutley delicious!

I have been making this recipe since it was first printed in 1995. It is always met with rave reviews. The combination of flavors is excellent and while it is okay to add something new (like Kalamata olives), to leave out the fennel, fish stock, etc. really results in a less flavorful dish. I saute the shrimp with the hot red pepper flakes as the recipe states, but serve the remainder on the side for those who really prefer it "hotter."

This is one of my all time favorite recipes! I think it is full of flavor and the fennal gives it a punch of something different. I have made this recipe for years and will keep doing so!

Love saffron and all the ingredients in this pasta dish but was disappointed in the finished product. I did not mind the prep work at all and you can definitly put it together quickly when you prep ahead but both my husband and I found it pretty boring and would not make it again. I can make low-fat dishes with a lot more taste.

I would like to give this recipe 2 1/2 forks. It was pretty good and it was nice to have a low fat dish. It just seemed to lack something. Maybe I will try some sundried tomatoes next time.

I couldn't eat this. Unbelievably painful.

while this was beautiful to look at, it was missing something in the taste department. I'm wondering if a bit of cream would help? The sauce was so thin it really din't cling to the pasta. Wouldn't make it again without some modification.

This is great. I made in back in 1995 when it first came out and a few times since. Those reviewers that left out the saffron and fennel really cannot properly review this recipe. The saffron (don't substitute with anything) and fennel are predominant flavors. I reduce the fennel somewhat but it is wonderful with the seafood and safffron. I also add more olive oil than called for. I made with fresh Kodiak scallops last night instead of shrimp -- YUM!

Great recipe. I added more hot pepper, Scallops, red pepper, mushrooms, and a bag of frozen baby peas. It was great. I also used bow ties instead and basil instead of parsley on top. Serve with a nice white, pinot gris. Be experimental and add veggies to the stew for more fun.

Huh - After making this, I thought I must have followed a different recipe - we found it to be ok, but not at all great (left out the fennel and fish stock.) I don't plan to make it again!

We left out the saffron, fennel, fish stock and linguine. Serve over bow-tie pasta and everyone loves it!!!! (Use Baby Spinach for ease)

This took quite a while to prepare but the result was worth the time spent on prep. Presents well and is full of flavor. Keeper for company.

Nice Combo of flavors--especially the shrimp/spinach duo. Don't drain the tomatoes--it makes a glorious sop for good crusty bread. No salad needed to make a great meal...and low fat, too!

This is one of my favorite pasta recipes. All the work is in the prep. I leave the fennel out. Save time by using packaged baby spinach leaves - no need to chop them. The finished dish is full of color and flavor!

Excellent. However, Saffron can be expensive. It can be substituted with anotto oil, which is cheaper.
