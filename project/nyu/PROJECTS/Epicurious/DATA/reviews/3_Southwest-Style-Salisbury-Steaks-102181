A friend of mone served this to me last night along with the lime-pickled onions, salsa and avocado. It was wonderful. A perfect late night dinner.

My boyfried and I loved this recipe. We live in an apartment and we dont have an outdoor grill, so I did these on my George Foreman grill and they came out great. The pickled onions, avacado, and salsa added to the flavor and made them perfect.

This is good for a low effort dinner. I spiced it up with seranno chilies. Served with the lime onions, corn avacado salad and warm tortillas.

Burgers were okay, not spectacular but as another viewer noted, the lime-pickled red onions are great! They are definitely a keeper and could be used as a condiment in many recipies.

Good flavour but too much cilantro. Would make again but cut the cilantro in half.

The patties themselves are okay but I LOVE the lime pickled red onions. I make them to go on sandwiches & in salads.

After reading the reviews, I tried to spice this recipe up. I added chili sauce to the recipe and it helped a lot. Also, instead of canned green chiles, I roasted 2 pasilla chiles on a stovetop grill, and added them. I also had a red pepper and threw it in. It was good--certainly not the best. Probably could make it into a meatloaf with the addition of some bread crumbs.

I used Ground Buffalo for this recipe and it was great.

OK but Ho Humm! my wife has been making a variation of this for years but she calls them "stuffed hamburgers. Would be a little more zesty using green bell peppers instead of canned chilies. And maybe a pinch of Chiltepin pepper.Definitely no tums required!

My 20 yr old daughter who is at university and just beginning to cook prepared these patties several times for us last summer- everyone loved it. We used ground sirloin and served the patties with a rice, black bean and pepper salad with a lime pie (from Bonn Appetiti archives "old fashioned lime pie". It was a really nice easy menu. No objections to "updating" the recipe from my house.

I agree. The traditional is much better. Lets stick with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes.

I REALLY OBJECT TO PASSING SOMETHING OFF AS HISTORICAL AND THEN "UPDATING" IT. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO HISTORY, LET'S DO HISTORY. BESIDES, I'M SICK TO DEATH OF SOUTHWEST STUFF. THE RAGE IS GETTING RAGGED AROUND THE EDGES.

This was great. The red onions taste wonderful, but keep the tums handy. Will definitely make this again, but I might carmelize onions to mellow them out a little.

These steaks were absolutely delicious and very easy to make. The flavors are wonderful. I made this dish about a month ago, and I still dream about it. I was put off at first by the thought of the pickled red onions, but they are very tasty, and the flavors blend nicely after several hours of marinading.
