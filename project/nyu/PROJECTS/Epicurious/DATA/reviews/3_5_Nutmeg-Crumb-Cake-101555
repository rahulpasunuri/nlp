I first reviewed this recipe in 2005; I have since made it so many times I can't even remember! I have used different spices instead of nutmeg, like cinnamon or ginger, but always go back to nutmeg. One thing I did realize along the way--the recipe does not call for salt, so I began adding just a bit, probably about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp., depending on my eyeballing abilities. It really makes a difference! Oh, and I still think this is absolutely the best crumb cake ever.

Very quick and easy with a moist and flavorful result. I used freshly ground nutmeg which could account for what I thought was a not-at-all-bland result.

Easy to make but rather dull, bland Disappointed; wanted a denser, richer cake

Easssy Peasy. I doubled the recipe -- using a whole egg -- and it made a fine, lofty cake. (Who wants a skinny cake?) Also added cinnamon for more kick. Love the easy clean-up. A perfect fast snack cake.

This was such an easy cake to prepare, but, in the end, I just didn't like it very much. I didn't really care for the overpowering nutmug taste.

This was, sweet, spicy and just wonderful! And very easy! I had no trouble with the crumb topping - maybe my crumbs were bigger than other readers? My sons both devoured the cake.

Definitely don't use more nutmeg than the recipe calls for! I decided to add a little extra, and I wouldn't advise it. Otherwise, I liked the crumb cake. I did encounter an issue with the crumbs on the top melting rather than staying crumbly, but I think that's something I can with practice figure out how to fix.

It tasted very nice indeed and was well received, but I was confused...there was no crumb topping. It all melted into the cake by the time I took it out of the oven!

I was looking for a simple recipe to satisfy my sweet tooth while away from the comforts of my home kitchen. This certainly hit the spot: spicy, sweet and practically fool-proof.

This is simply the best crumb cake recipe ever! The only thing I changed was I added a bit more nutmeg, but that's it. It's heavenly at six in the morning with a good stout cup of French press coffee. Makes getting up early a pleasure!

At first we found serving size small, too. But I suspect that what's wrong is our idea of portion size vs actual portion size? With six pieces, each piece has 321 calories. That should be plenty ...

In its simplicity, a lovely morning cake. For a flavor bump vs a sugar hit, I doubled the nutmeg and used only 1/2 cup brown sugar - a reliable technique to make a single flavor really stand out. Gone in a flash ...

I wanted to make this cake but realized that the only eggs I had in the house were 2 egg whites. I experimented by following the recipe but substituting, for the egg yolk, the two whites whipped to almost stiff peaks. I folded them into the batter and the results were very good. The cake was moist, had a good rise and was a bit healthier than the original.

This cake is very tasty and so easy to make! To the reviewer comparing it with the coffee cake in The Cake Bible, I have made that one too and it is very good and pretty to present, but SOO much more time and effort to make. This recipe is perfect if you want a nice cake that you can just put together easily with things you already have in the cupboard

I just made this (basically in the time I took to read the reviews!). I used vanilla yogurt and didn't change the amounts of brown sugar or vanilla to compensate. The nutmeg smell is quite strong (but enjoyable), and I was worried that it might be too much, but one bite reassured me. It turned out nice and light in my 8x8 pan, and I'll definitely repeat this. Maybe we all need to ask why the previous reviewer knows what dog biscuits taste like?????

This was a delicious, easy cake. The dog biscuit review is bizarre. I would never have come up with that analogy. What kind of biscuits do your dogs eat? The brown sugar gives it a slight caramel flavor and darker color. If you are expecting a light fluffy cake you should try another recipe. I used cardamon as well, and it is fantastic! I think this would be even better with some sauteed apples added. It is moist, slightly dense and wonderful.

Absolutely delicious. I recommend also replacing the nutmeg with cardamom for an even more sublime breakfast cake.

Ok. The cake is very easy and quick to make but that is the only redeeming virtue. My family and I felt that it tasted like nutmeg flavored dog biscuits. For a really great, but more complicated crumb cake, see The Cake Bible, by Rose Levy Beranbaum. There is a great sour cream coffee cake recipe included.

mmmmmmmmmm...instead of buttermilk/yogurt we used sour cream. why? we didn't have any of the above. i saw sc used in another recipe on epicurious.com and thought, what the heck. the result was fantastic! i think this made it a little more dense and super tasty. my husband likes it, the dog loves it (she got the rest of mine when i wasn't looking) and i will make it again. very easy.

I found this cake only so-so. I was looking for a very light, airy crumb cake that rose much higher than this. This just didn't do it. The cake was fine, but not great, and was a little denser than I had wanted. It was VERY easy and quick, and was tasty enough for a quick go-with-coffee sort of thing, but I will continue searching for a REALLY good crumb cake.

This was a yummy cake that was very easy to make. I also wish I had doubled the recipe - it makes a thin cake in the 8x8 pan and could have also served 6 people nicely if a bit thicker.

We were looking for a recipe to use leftover buttermilk-we added a little cinnamon to the wet ingredients and made 11 cupcakes instead of one big cake. They were moist & very yummy! We only wish we had doubled the recipe!

It was so quick & easy. It's very light cake. I quite like it, but my husband said "so-so". If you like light cakes, it's worth to make it.

This cake is the best! It's so easy you could make it in your sleep and it's sooooo good. The first time I made it and served it to my husband while still warm and he said that it was the best cake that he had ever had! A perfect cake to make for breakfast or a quick dessert. It stays nice and moist for several days if you keep it covered in plastic wrap at room temp.
