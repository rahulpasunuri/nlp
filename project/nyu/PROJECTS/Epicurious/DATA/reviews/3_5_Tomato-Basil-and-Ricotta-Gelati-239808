Had this at a tomato tasting party, OMG! it was the hit of the party. Fabulous! Will try the candied cherry tomatoes when I make this recipe :o)

I only made the ricotta version & substituted honey for about 1/2 the simple syrup. It was fantastic & got rave reviews. I used fresh ricotta that I made the day before. I wouldn't recommend using the variety in the plastic tub for this recipe. Making your own is very simple & doesn't take much time. Totally worth it.

I have only made the basil so far and what a different taste. Kind of minty I think I am going to like it. Not sure if I will make the tomato but if my tomatoes are plentiful, I will. I did make a pineapple sorbet that I am going to try the basil w/ I think it will be a good combonation

I stacked each gelato so it was a neopolitan and looked like the Italian flag when sliced. The whole thing was very harmonious and delicious. The tomato was like a sorbet, and the heaviness of the ricotta was balanced by the light and slightly bitter notes of the tomato and the basil. Everyone loved it and couldn't stop talking about it. It was a awesome!

I wasn't brave enough to try making the tomato flavor, but the ricotta was delicious -- like cannoli filling -- and the basil flavor, once everyone got over the weirdness factor (never mind that mint, a relative of basil, is a popular ice cream flavor), was a big hit. I used toasted pine nuts and shaved dark chocolate to garnish.
