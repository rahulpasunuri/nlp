As a child growing up in a French-Canadian area of Massachusetts, I learned a variation of this recipe that I still make for a special breakfast. Leave out the black pepper and bacon. When done, serve with butter and maple syrup. The combination of sharp Vermont cheddar and the syrup is absolutely delicious.

These are also good when cooked in a Panini maker. We substituted prosciuto for the Canadian Bacon the second time making this recipe. Less substancial a sandwich but the flavor is awesome.

Great for toddlers! This recipe (without the bacon) was devoured by our 12 month old. With the bacon (or ham) it's great for grown-up breakfasts and lunches. Easy, nutritious and delicious. We use whole wheat bread as well -- just as yummy.

This is my new grilled cheese sandwich of choice. Loved the mix of flavors and the outside crust of the dipped egg. Made it with wholewheat bread... didn't have white. Will make it often.
