I have made this recipe many, many times and it always tastes great. I use shiitake mushrooms and substitute truffle butter for the truffles/truffle sauce under the chicken's skin. I agree with the poster who said real truffles are too delicate for this recipe; hence, the truffle butter, which delivers the flavor and also keeps the chicken moist and tender. I also add truffle butter instead of truffle oil and regular butter to the sauce at the end, and use truffle oil instead of olive oil to toss the potatoes, mushrooms and bacon. Finally, two tablespoons of oil will make the recipe too oily; you only need about half that amount.

At first I doubted this simple sauce made of chicken wings...but it turned out fabulous! Extraordinarily rich with superb mouthfeel. I now use it as a jumping off point for other sauces - added blackberry preserves to make a great sauce for duck. To overcome the overly fattiness mentioned by one reviewer, I chilled this over night, then removed most of the solid fat that had risen to the top.

Followed instructions except used less oil and did not add butter to sauce. It was VERY oily. We used truffle sauce and we were really glad we didn't waste an actual black truffle on this recipe.

This was great, but...I would add all the vegetables towards the end. Otherwise they will get charred.

We had this for an elegant Christmas Dinner & it is worth every minute it takes to make. Do NOT skip the 1st step to prepare the broth with chicken wings. It really elevates this dish. We did thicken the sauce before serving & have had it both with & without the mushrooms & bacon. Fantastic both ways!

My partner and I recenty returned from Spain with black truffles(in a jar). Decided to try this recipie. Followed it to the "T". WOW! we loved it! Not only were we amazed at the incredible taste, the house smelled wonderful as it cooked, too! This will be on my "keeper" list.

I didn't make this, but it seems like a waste of truffles to me. Their delicate flavor can't stand up to long cooking times or temps. Just my 2 cents, or your $20....

Wow! This is the absolutely best chicken recipe/dinner I have ever made and consumed. Added soften butter under the skin along with the truffles. Used button mushrooms and eliminated the bacon. Extremely delicious!

I have made this recipe 10xs now since it was first released in year 2000. Everyone who tasted this recipe gave me a rave review. I have been serving it during christmas and I will be serving it for thanksgiving this year using the same recipe but turkey instead. We will see how it will turn out. But this is one marvelous recipe worth trying. Make sure that you have black truffles as it is the key to this recipe or use truffle oil.

I thought this was delicious! I have 2 small kids and I didn't think it was too time consuming. On top of the fact that the kids ate it!

to be fair, i didn't have any truffles or even any truffle sauce. and maybe shouldn't rate this recipe. i was hoping that some lovely truffle oil to make mushrooms duxelle might help with the shortage in my pantry. it was fine but clearly not what the recipe intended at all. so to anyone else who might be thinking along those lines, i'd suggest waiting until we are fortunate enough to get some of those "black beauties".

This is a fantastic roasted chicken,and well worth the effort.I bought 2 Oregon truffles for my brother in law and we were looking for ways to use them. I used portabello mushrooms instead of wild. After making this dish my brother in law offered to send me to cooking school so that we could open a restaurant. Was it the chicken or the lovely Merlot that we drank with it?
