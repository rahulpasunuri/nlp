It needed a lot more corn than the recipe called for. I put about three times as much. That made it good.

Ok. So I didn't make the arugula and warm tomato salad. I'm sure that's a great salad, but let me tell you about these fritters! Oh my gosh were they delicious. I couldn't believe how easy they were and how good they turned out. I didn't cook the corn at all, but used a leftover corn salad with onions that I had made. The cumin/honey/lime dressing on the salad added a bit of extra juice and so I had to add some more flour to the fritter mix, but wowza! Also, you must sprinkle the freshly cooked fritters with more salt. Everything fried needs a touch more salt once it comes out. I will make these again and often.

Loved this dish. I served it as a main course along with black beans. I used finely ground cornmeal and did not have the same problem with grittiness mentioned by some of the other reviewers.

I made this dish after eating so much over the holidays. We found it to be an excellent light dinner. It hit the spot.The arugla and tomatoes were great. The corn fritters were good and were a nice compliment to the meal. Garlic shrimp might go better. Overall, simple to make and a good light meal.

This meal is most likely in the top 10 of my favorites. Per some of the suggestions, I added minced jalapeno pepper to the corn fritter mix and I made sure to be liberal with the salt to balance the mealy corn flavor. I also added a few pieces of bacon (veggie bacon, but all the same) to the EVOO I used to cook the fritters in. The textures, flavors and colors of all three pieces come together to create a favorable vegetarian dish that's easy to make at home.

I just found this recipe while looking for ways to use fresh corn. I was disappointed in the fritters as was my husband. These did not taste like my grandmother's fritters. I realized she used bacon fat to fry them. Her were also lighter. If i try them again, I'll definitely try to flavor them up with green chilis and bacon. Not sure how to make them lighter. The tomato salad, however was delicious, I give it 4 forks.

Yes, just finished this dinner & it was yummy! I added 1/2 a jalapeno pepper chopped fine to the fritters, and some cilantro to the tomato salad (which seemed more like a sauce or salsa to me.) My husband liked it, too.

I've been making this a lot. If you make the fritters in the morning and put powdered sugar and syrup on them they are Jonny Cakes. I've also replaced the arugula with arugula sprouts and/or radish sprouts. How yummy is that?!

I thought this was good, but not as good as I'd expected. The salad and tomatoes were great and combined well. The flavor of the fritters was good with the salad, too. But I thought the fritters were a bit too dense and heavy. And, I didn't taste the corn as much as I'd have liked. I'd make again because I liked the combination of flavors, but I would work to lighten the fritters and bump up the corn flavor.

the simplicity of the recipes allow the genuine flavors of the vegetables to shine. freshly picked sweet corn is absolutely key to the success of the fritters; otherwise they're boring. do not overcook the corn before adding it to the batter. if it's barely blanched, it will provide a nice crunchy texture. the peppery arugula is an ideal contrast to the sweetness of the tomatoes and corn... bake some fresh peach cobbler while you're eating dinner, then serve it warm with vanilla ice cream to round out a meal that truly celebrates the bounty of late summer!

I really loved this (as did my boyfriend) but made the following changes: I used three ears of corn, included the (olive) oil in the batter and fried the fritters in peanut oil. Also I added Tobasco sauce and one small finely chopped clove of garlic to the batter. They were flavorful, substantial, and held together well. Also I added another clove of chopped garlic to the tomatoes while cooking, and a handful of chopped fresh basil and after taking them off the heat. Yum, yum, yum.

The fritters could definintely use something to jazz them up, but this salad and the presentation of the dish are fantastic!

The presentation of this recipe is nice with the salad and tomatoes. I think the success of the corn fritters depends on the quality of the corn. I would recommend using swet corn and a pinch or two of cayenne. I am going to try Martha Stewart's recipe for corn fritters from the food network. She does not use any cornmeal in hers and one tablespoon of flour. Also no baking soda. She serves them with maple syrup. Maybe the cornmeal overpowers the corn.

I used Spinach instead of Arugula, cooked some sliced mushrooms with the scallions before adding the rest of the ingredients and thoroughly enjoyed the dressing! The Corn Fritters were a tad bland but otherwise, we really enjoyed this combination.

My mother used to fix corn fritters for dinner regularly when I was a child. My brother and I absolutely loved them. I'm sure her recipe is similar to the one here but the difference being that we used to drizzle maple syrup over them. Yum! Might be worth a try.

I had never made fritters of any kind before, I thought these were good, not too greasy or heavy. The two salads definitely "dressed up" the fritters, probably a good idea to serve them all together.

I'm thankful to this recipe for introducing me to the world of fritters... but I will be unfaithful and move along to the next recipe right away. These were tough, tasteless little hockey pucks which delighted my 1-year old but certainly disappointed the more mature palates among us. This time around WE threw the food on the floor.

Well worth the time it took to prepare this recipe. The salad, the tomatoes and especially the fritters were mouth watering. A definite keeper.

We only made the fritters so do not know if the salad would be a good complement. Not a lot of flavor in the fritters. Needed more salt and pepper or just some flavor in general. We added more corn meal and deep fried them. Once we realized how plain they were, we rolled them in sugar which helped tremendously.
