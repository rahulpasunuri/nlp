Rduce the olive oil as it will be way too greasy!! Otherwise is very good.

Reduced garlic in half, and added toasted pine nuts. Be certain to use good quality cheese. Served with grilled chicken. Just heavenly!

A tad bland although not bad. I was a little put off by the texture and appearance of the sauce. The romano in the olive oil was awfully gooey. Think I would have just rather added the cheese after the fact.

Very good, simple. Following suggestions found here, I made w/ Lemony Chicken Milanese (url below) for a great match. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lemony-Chicken-Milanese-with-Arugula-Salad-237101

After reviewing the ingredients i had on hand, i decided to make this recipe, paired with grilled spicy italian sausages. It was simple and quick, and pretty good. Would definitely add more garlic next time, as i was expecting a little more spice. Overall, a fairly pleasing, easy recipe.

The combination of the Spicy Spinach Linguine and the Lemony Chicken Milanese with Argula Salad is my go-to meal for quick dinners and impromptu parties -- and it has always been a big hit. Those with a Trader Joe's nearby should consider using the Spinach and Chive Linguine - it's perfect! Also, preparing the sauce over low heat in a small saucepan helps maintain the temperature of the overall dish vs. adding cold white wine and room temperature olive oil to the pasta.

This recipe is perfect for a weeknight dinner. Full of flavor. I sliced a skinless chicken cutlet into 1/2-inch thick strips (so they would cook faster), rubbed them with garlic, then sprinkled salt and pepper on them. Pan-fried for 2-3 mins each side. Served the chicken over the pasta. Yum!

I thought it would be a little bland, but it was great! It was a big hit with my family.

A delicious and easy side dish. I make it regularly with chicken parmesan and pan fried sole. Love the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.

this was so balnd and a waste of time for such poor results. You are better making an arribiatta sauce -- this recipe is terriblly boring and not flavorful

A very tasty, simple vegetarian meal. Next time, I will use about half the olive oil (there is really no need) and just add more cooking liquid to keep it moist. I would also add the cheese much more slowly, mixing thoroughly between additions, to keep it from clumping. This recipe can get a bit garlicky, so just keep that in mind if you aren't a huge garlic fan, like I am!

Delicious! I will definitely make this again! I topped each serving with toasted pine nuts just before serving. This will go into the regular week night rotation.

I won't rate this until I make it following the recipe, but even with a bunch of substitutions it was very tasty. I made this with what was available, so I used regular fettucine, steamed chopped spinach, and dried basil. It was still yummy!

I would definitely make this again. I added a bit more rep pepper and it got a little spicy for my wife but I LOVED it that way! The spicier the better.

Very yummy. Nothing too fancy or over the top but a nice week night dish that's easy to make. It was a little dry at the end, so next time I will add more cooking liquid (I probably only used about 1/4 cup) and maybe a little olive oil at the last minute. Otherwise, it was tasty!

Everybody loved it and it was incredibly easy. Weeknight staple.

I love dishes like this, but the one thing that irks me about A LOT of the recipes on this site NO NUTRITIONAL INFO. I'm a total foodie, and have my days..when I just don't care, but sometimes I need a little more than "low fat', "meatles" "low sugar," ya know? cookinglight.com, eatingwell.com...they have that information. Am I just being too much of a stickler? Or am I totally not in the know-- do they have it posted somewhere else? Regardless, I can't turn away pasta, garlic, olive oil *drool* Epicurious.com steals my heart all the time!

Fabulous. Easy. Delicious. A wonderful weeknight dinner - I tossed it with flash sauteed pea shoots from Farmers Market and we were in heaven. I used the spinach chive egg linguine from Trader Joes and it was exceptional - tasted like a million bucks. Would be a great veggie dinner if you paired it with any sauteed greens. Husband RAVED!

This pasta was a big hit in our house and was so easy to prepare. I used fresh linguine which cut down the preparation time even more. Will definitely be making this again!

Easy great tasting weekday dinner. Fancy enough to serve for company as well. I like spicy, so I double the red pepper, and of course, the garlic as well.

I definitely would make this again. However, Trader Joe's did not have the Spinach and Garlic Linguini, so I used fettucini instead which ruined it (pasta was too heavy). Next time, I'll use a finer pasta, more garlic, less basil and stronger cheese.

Easy to make with restaurant quality taste. Wonderful with the Lemony Chicken Milanese! Would definitely make this for next dinner party.

This was wonderful! The flavors were very complementary; the spice of garlic and pepper with the balance of basil was excellent. I only used half of the olive oil the recipe called for and it was plenty. Served with a salad and fresh baguette its a meal in itself. We also drank the rest of the wine we used in the recipe - no waste!

Wow - the flavors were fantastic! I made absolutely no changes and will be making this meal quite often! The pasta took no time to make and it tasted like restaurant quality. I felt no need to add any meat - it was great on it's own!

This was a great quick pasta dish! I would like to try adding some shrimp to it next time.

I just am cleaning up from making this pasta and the Milenese Chicken that goes with it. Outstanding! I'd give it almost 4 forks. I used an 8 oz. bag of Trader Joes Spinach & Garlic Linguini & the full sauce recipie less a little cheese and it was perfect. Spicy but not overwhelmingly, just a hint, and it went very well with the chicken & arugula. My boyfriend raved and he never does. Very nice!
