These were good in the oxtail bouillon for Christmas dinner. Next time I might make baked cheese puffs. Cheese puffs definitely made the soup more festive.

1.) Yes, they *are* easy to make. 2.) I used a deep fryer, and they were puffs, but not round ones--strange, mutant shapes, actually, but maybe with practice... 3.) however, I think they need more flavor--maybe herbs or a tangier cheese, and they are pretty unappetizing once they cool.
