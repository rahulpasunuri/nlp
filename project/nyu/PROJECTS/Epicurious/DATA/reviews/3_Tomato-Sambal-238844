I make this salad often when tomatoes are at their best, January to March. Yellow tomatoes are not so easy to come by; I use just red, juicy ones. This will, however, NOT be served with lamb tomato bredie -- I reviewed that recipe, which is really not correct. This salsa or sambal or salad would be served as a SALAD, and sometimes as a sambal (a small side dish with curries). A refreshing and very simple salad made by all and sundry in these parts. Using one's own garden tomatoes, sun-ripened, it is ambrosia, and can well rate 4 forks!!
