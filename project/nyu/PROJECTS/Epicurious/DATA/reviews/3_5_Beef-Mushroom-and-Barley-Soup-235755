This was excellent. We used more meat than the recipe called for - 1lb of short ribs and another .7lb of some other bone-in cut. I also added two more cups of water and a couple of beef boullion cubes. I think it needs another root vegetable, so we diced a couple of turnips and added them at the same time as the vegetable/barley mix. Used freeze dried dill instead of fresh - the soup is still super flavorful.

Very rich and filling, perfect for a cold winter night. I used about 1.5 pounds of beef short ribs, about doubled the veggies and like other reviewers, deglazed the pan with sherry. I didn't have fresh dill so I used about 1 tablespoon of dried herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano. This was very tasty despite the relatively short time used in cooking. Thumbs up!

The soup was quite good. I cooked the barley separately with the broth and added some to each serving as was suggested. The dill gave it a great flavor.

I used thyme, and dried chanterelles... wonderfully earthy! Added beef stock, afterwards, to the last few helpings... it's a new family recipe in our house!

Fabulous Fall soup! Made this according to the recipe except used 2# of cross cut short ribs. I used water instead of the stock like other recommended and the soup had a rich flavorful broth. I made it the day before serving and was able to skim the fat which intensified the flavors and made the soup more healthful. Definitely a keeper!

When I went to the store they were out of short ribs. I picked up the smallest package of soup bones and about three-quarters of a pound of stewing beef. I made one small change during cooking. I threw a 1/2 cup of the stock into the pot with the veg and barley to get all the tasty brown bits up into the soup. Lastly, I somehow forgot the dill. The soup was quite delicious. Perfect for a snowy winter dinner.

I made this with dried lobster mushrooms(because they were on sale) and I used farro instead of barley. It was totally yummy! It got even better the second day after all the farro soaked up the flavor and everything had time to blend. It was hearty but light at the same time. Great winter soup with a nice clean broth!

Very good recipe and worth making again. I made the following changes: sub'd a quart of beef broth in place of water to deepen the flavor; seared beef stew chunks (rolled in seasoned flour) in EVOO before adding them to the liquid; added five cloves of minced garlic and a half-bulb of fennel to the veg saute; and added splashes of amontillado sherry and soy sauce to brighten flavors.

Like other reviewers, used beef stock rather than water. Used short ribs on the bone. I thought the short rib meat didn't add anything and regular beef stew meat would work fine and be cheaper. That said, the broth came out really really rich and flavorful, and the bones may have been important in that. Loved the dill flavor with the barley.

This soup is fabulous! I used beef broth instead of water as advised from previous reviewers. I used boneless short ribs and found very little fat needed to be skimmed from the top. I mixed up different types of dried mushrooms for more mushroomy flavor. Will make this over and over again!

I was pleasantly surprised by this soup. I was searching for something to use up the last bits of random cuts I have from when we purchase a 1/4 of a grass fed calf. I believe I was using cuts from the spine as the bones look a lot like vertebrates. I'm not sure if there is a name for that cut. I didn't have dried mushrooms so just put some fresh in with the meat at the beginning. I browned the meat/bones in a bit of bacon fat to get started. Then added some extra fresh mushrooms and water. I simmered for about 4 hours before moving on to the veggies to get a full flavor in the stock and just because I wasn't sure exactly what this meat I had was going to be like. I followed the recipe to a tee from that point forward, except I did add a bit of Worcestershire sauce in the mix as I think it always goes nicely with strong beef flavored dishes. I did find I had to cook for about another 30 minutes in order to get my barley fully cooked. The end result was delicious. I was worried it would be too mushroomy while it was cooking, but it ended up just fine.

This was really good-- hearty enough to satisfy on a cold day, but with depth of flavor from the mushrooms. I used dried porcinis, beef stew meat and beef broth rather than water. I also browned the beef in the skillet before putting it into the soup liquid. Also used closer to a cup of barley. Would be good with other fresh herbs besides dill... would try thyme next time.

Lots of depth in flavors here. I basically made according to recipe except using 1/2 beef broth, 1/2 water. I think I'll try the bone-in chuck next time for less fat and more meat. I tried it both without skimming fat and then the next day after removing the fat that solidified on top (a lot!). I love the taste of the unskimmed broth but it was pretty oily. Company loved every bite. Served with a butter lettuce/escarole salad with hazelnuts, apples, pomagranite and citrus dressing. Wonderful.

Just in time for fall, this is a hearty and earthy soup! I skipped the dill and used thyme instead. So good. Enjoyed with a big fat Syrah and some crusty bread.

This is a lovely-to-look-at, clear and delicate yet stick-to-your-bones and rich soup. I have made it many, many times and even given it to friends recovering from the flu. It is one of the many reasons that I am heartbroken ofer the demise of Gourmet, which I first discovered when friends left it for me in 1969--the magazine was August 1968, and I still have it!

This is a delicious, earthy and filling soup. I followed a lot of other reviewers modifications and used two cans beef broth, 6 cups of water, along with 2 cups of the mushroom liquid, and the broth was very rich. Instead of short ribs, I used beef for stewing, and two soup bones, that way I didn't need to cut the ribs off the bone and all that. I also used 2 leeks instead of onion and used a dash of oregano and two dashes of thyme as I didn't have dill. It was delicious!

Excellent soup, very good for a cold day. I did not have dried mushrooms and ribs, so I added chopped ham and potatoe and used beef stock.

I followed the other cook's advice and used beef broth instead of water. I also braised the short ribs and used fresh shitake and oyster mushrooms in lieu of the dried mushroom. It was wonderful delicious.

This is marvelous, but next time I'd cook the ribs with the soaked mushrooms a day before and get the solidified fat off before putting in the barley et al to cook. The barley absorbed too much liquid, so the fat was just all in the soup. Delicious, but not exactly diet food! Also, thyme and oregano would be a good substitute for dill in the winter.

As a child, I always loved my mother's beef barley soup. So this one had to be killer to move into my repertoire. It was! I went a little overboard on the short ribs, and when I started cooking, found to my dismay that I had no porcinis. I had some fresh shiitake in the fridge, tho, and their meaty taste and texture made them a decent substitute. I'll definitely do this again, especially when I can try it with all the ingredients the recipe calls for.

Following the advice from previous cooks, I used beef stew meet, added beef marrow bones and used sherry to deglaze the pot. I also used low sodium beef broth instead of water, but omitted the dried mushrooms & dill. Perhaps the soup will be more delicious with these ingredients, but it is scrumptious enough even without them... YUMMY!!

Delicious! Hearty and flavorful. The dried mushrooms really give the broth a rich earthy flavor.

Excellent soup; I did adjust the seasonings (garlic powder, more salt, etc.) and added a "splash" of red wine before serving; served with rustic bread --- Yum!

I thought it was fabulous. The dill was a nice touch, but I did not use it on the leftovers and it was fine without. I used mixed dried Minnesota wild mushrooms which added and interesting touch. It freezes very nicely.

I liked this well enough, but dill seems an odd touch. Try thyme, maybe some sage, and finish with parsley instead. A little sherry to deglaze after browning the veggies in oil from the beef adds nice flavor, too. Bone-in chuck sounds good.

Nice, but I used sage and a little thyme instead of dill. A bone-in chuck steak is easier to handle, and just as flavorful.

Nice enough, but I was raised on BMB soup with earthy Eastern European dried mushroom. They're difficult to find, so I usually use dried porcini. Oxtails can add a lot of body, but I like to include some beef marrow bones (brown either or both on all sides); the marrow is a tasty lagniappe!
