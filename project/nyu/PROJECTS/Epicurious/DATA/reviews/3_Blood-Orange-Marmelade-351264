I, too, made this for the Cocoa Nib cake. It came out hard as a rock and I am now going out to buy orange marmalade. I am crossing my fingers for the rest of the cake...

This was delicious for the purpose in which it was intended, as part of the Cocoa Nib, Chocolate, and Citrus Dacquoise (fancy cake) recipe. I'm not sure what I would use this on besides the cake. I bet it would be good baked on top of a white cheese of some sort and smeared on crackers. Make sure you watch this while it is cooking. I had to make two batches because I burned the first while I hopped in the shower. I think the Campari gives this an extra special flavor. Not sure what I'll do with the rest of the bottle though.

I used this for the Cocoa Nib, chocolate & citrus dacquoise - not as a marmalade. It was a delicious flavour in the cake but the rind went way too hard and I had to cut it off. I think the second cooking time should have been much less. I also used grand marnier as I don't care for campari.

My family and friends loved this. I also used Grand Marnier and the second time I made it I couldn't find blood oranges so I used plain navel oranges. Still great!

Intense orange flavor. I didn't have a problem with it...it's a bit runnier than the store bought marmalades and has a more intense flavor.

I followed the recipe with the only exception being that I added Grand Marnier since I didn't have Campari. The result was marmelade that was so hard you couldn't put a spoon in it. What happened?
