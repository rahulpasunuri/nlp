This is a good recipe if you need a mild side dish. The latin spice mix is not very strong and the slaw could use more as well as more cilantro. I used a whole medium poblano for 1/3 the recipe and that was fine. Also, try sauteing the chayote without any oil or use very little. I used too much and the chayote was too oily.

I don't like the taste & texture of chayote -- and there seems to be too much of chayote in this receipe. Since there's only a little nutritional value to it, I pass on chayote.

Great slaw. I had left over dressing at the bottom of the bowl so I added grated jicama to the remaining veggies. Just as good as the chayote!

This was my first time trying chayote and after trying it I will have it again, but I won't rush out to the specialty store for it soon. I really like the idea of the all of the ingredients, It just did not have enough flavor for me and I did add extra Latin Spices.

I have made this recipe numerous times! There are a lot of steps involved. The Latin Spice Mix can be made a couple days ahead of time. The Chayote can be julienned and sauteed the night before and refrigerated. If you have not tried Chayote, this recipe will keep you coming back for more!
