It was tough to choke this down. The fennel definitely contributed the most to this. The dressing seems like a good concept, but needs work - it was too thick and too bland.

I love roasted pears and I thought I would like roasted fennel. I don't think the issue is with the recipe- I am just not a huge fan of fennel. I didn't use the chicken stock as I thought it would steam, rather than roast. The pears turned out very well with the olive oil and balsamic. I normally use butter and balsamic. Another spin on this is to use arugula, roasted walnuts and shaved parmesan. The sweetness of the roasted pears with the tannins of the walnuts is always a hit!

Had pears and fennel in the fridge, so searched for a recipe with both and found this salad. I played with another recipe I found for apple and fennel salad and combined the two for a delectable salad course to my fall meal. I roasted apples along with the pear and fennel, and added those to the dressing, as well as EVOO. I also added fresh apple dices to the arugula (& spinach, arugula is too strong for me on it's own) and topped with maple glazed cashews and shaved aged gouda. It was definitely a hit at my dinner party!

I picked the recipe out of the magazine prior to reading the online reviews. THE DRESSING WAS SPECTACULAR! I would make it again in a second. The pears and fennel were watery. Perhaps roasting them without the chicken stock would give them more flavor.

Enjoyed this recipe alot. Have made it quite a number of times. Always a hit...p.s. my guests are brutally honest.

Yuck! This recipe needs some help! I would consider making it again with raw fennel instead of roasted, and perhaps a sprinkling of toasted pine nuts or pecans. The roasted fennel almost gives it a "squash" type of flavor. Yuck!

It was ok, but the dressing ends up much too thick. I ended up doubling the vinegar & oil in it. Also, just balsamic vinegar made the dressing way too sweet. I used 1/2 balsamic & 1/2 red wine vinegar. Does not make a particularly attractive presentation.
