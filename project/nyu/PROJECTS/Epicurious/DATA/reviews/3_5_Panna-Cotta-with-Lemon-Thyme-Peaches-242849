This is one of my all time favorite things. A lot of reviews say the yogurt flavor is overpowering. Mine never have been, but I use Organic Nonfat Plain Yogurt. Maybe that's the difference. I also use closer to 1/4 tsp. of PURE Almond extract (because I like almond/honey flavor combination). This is my go to dessert every summer once the peaches come in. Absolutely simple and perfect. I have also used standard thyme with some lemon zest when I couldn't get the Lemon Thyme. It's not as good, but works in a pinch.

The peaches were great, and I'd make them again to serve with a different panna cotta recipe. I usually love panna cotta, but the yogurt and honey really were too dominant in this recipe. This panna cotta was not my cup of tea.

As previous reviewers have noted this sets sooner than 8 hours and has a strong yogurt flavor. BUT i happened to leave my over night (we decided not to have it for dessert) and the next night it was PERFECT! Seems as though the longer it sat the more subdued the yogurt flavor became. I'll definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe to a T and it turned out great. This was my second time making panna cotta and the first time I had used another recipe and had trouble dissolving the gelatin. This time there was no problem. I love the peaches with the thyme (I used regular thyme because that's what I had in my garden). The reason I rated it 3 stars is that the yogurt flavor was almost too strong. Although I would make this again, I will probably first try a recipe that has less/no yogurt.

The peaches deserve four forks but the panna cotta only gets three. It was a great consistency and I liked the almond flavor but I found the yogurt flavor to overwhelm all other ingredients. Will definately make it again and play with the flavors.

So good. So easy. Velvety smooth!

This is a heavenly dessert and very simple to prepare and it doesn't need 8 hrs to set. 4 are fine. My kids thought the almond extract made the peaches taste like cherries so I used orange extract today instead. We'll see how it tastes on Saturday.

This couldn't be easier or quicker to make, and it was tasty. The honey flavor, however, was very strong (almost overpowering), so next time I will try it with less honey. I had it in the fridge for about 4.5 hours before eating it and it was completely set. Finally, the peaches with thyme (I only had the non-lemon variety in my garden) was really delicious. This combo would also be great with plain yogurt or vanilla ice cream.

perfectly easy, delightfully fresh- with peaches at top form, the lemon thyme adds a delicious dimension to a simple recipie. The individual portions made for a perfect end-of- party sweet.

I made it in custard cups but also tried to unmold one. It worked with a bit of help with a knife around the edges. The gelatin wanted to clump up at first. I found it worked better to whisk it in without the standing to soften time.

Does anyone know if this will work in a mold?
