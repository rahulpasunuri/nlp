We have so much watermelon on hand I was at a loss trying to figure out what to do with it, so I decided to try sorbet. I altered the prep method a little, and used lemon juice from concentrate I had on hand. I also had rich simple syrup already made, so I used that to taste. The flavor is really good. Instead of cubing the watermelon, I used a round metal 1/2 tsp to scoop out little balls/chunks. I used my blender instead the food processor. I started with a 1/2 cup of rich syrup and adjusted to taste since my melon wasn't very sweet. While my freezer bowl was freezing I chilled the pureed melon, lemon juice and syrup mixture. After adding it to the machine I stirred in a splash of vodka. After it ran 35 minutes I sprinkled in 2 pinches of Fleur de Sel. My mixture was quite slushy, but I think I added a bit too much vodka. I am waiting to see if it firms up a bit while in the chest freezer. Either way my results are very refreshing and I can't fault the recipe for my adding too much alcohol. I can't wait to try different flavor accents like lime zest or basil or possibly cilantro.

another plus to having syrup left over is it can be used for other sorbets and makes a great ginger beer.

good: but with following modifications. syrup-1C sugar,1/2 C water, pinch of salt, 1lemon, 3/4 lime some grated rind from both and grated ginger(I used 1/2 of this syrup). I increased watermelon to 5 C's. It;s delicious when first made. After being in the freezer it tends to ice up. Next time, I would add vodka as one reviewer did as this would solve ice problem. It did however get rave reviews.

Nice and easy. However, a food processor is totally the wrong tool for the job. This is a job for a blender. There's no need to make 8 cups of puree just to use half of it (unless you're making a double batch!). A typical watermelon will yield about 16 cups of puree, so it's easiest just to carve off a quarter of the melon, smash it up in the blender, add the lemon/lime and sugar, and chill.

I used lime too and have made it more than once. The flavor is subtle and I do cut down on the simple syrup as others have suggested. This is a primo summertime cooler.

try adding a little bit of fresh chopped mint leaves

Yum! I do think that it could be a little less sweet, but in general v. tasty. It's nice to have a little at a time.

I loved this. I did substitute lime juice for the lemon and also added the zest of the lime. It was very refreshing & delicious -

GAG! Maybe I didn't use a ripe enough watermelon but this was sick!

Yummy! I strained the watermelon after processing, and I think it prevented the iciness problem (though I tried it after a week in the freezer and it was frozen solid at that time). A few hours after making the recipe, though, it was smooth and silky and just like very cold, fresh watermelon.

this was so delicious! mine wasn't icy, but rather velvety. the lemon juice is a must as it really sets off the sweetness of the watermelon. i'm in agreement that it is very refreshing.

This was way too sweet. I would cut the sugar in half if I made it again. Don't know that I'll bother.

I made this sorbet to go with the Ice-Cream Bombe (from this site) and it wasn't very good. It was really ICY, not creamy like the other sorbets that I have made. The flavour was really dull and too sweet.

This was a very refreshing sorbet. We ate this on a very hot night after eating a heavy dinner and tongue-coating roquefort. It was a very welcome ending and quite nice. I am only giving it three forks, however because it wasn't, "a dish beyond compare."

a simple, refreshing summer time treat. I followed the recipe to the T except adding 1/3 cup of vodka... YUMMY!!!

Outstanding! This is simple and very refreshing. I think the secret is quality of the watermelon. We used a locally grown melon from a town known to grow excellent melons (Norfolk, NE). Most states have similar places. The melon was tremendous and so was the sorbet.

Simple to make and refreshing especially in the sizzling summer heat!
