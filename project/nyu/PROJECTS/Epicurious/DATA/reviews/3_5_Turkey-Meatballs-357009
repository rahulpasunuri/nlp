Great recipe for kids - 12 year son helped to make them and 9 year old son devoured them. Very easy recipe - thought it was a little heavy on the breadcrumbs. Ground turkey can be dry - so next time I will slightly reduce bread crumbs. Also will add spices/herbs suggested by previous posters.

I've added fennel and some other herbs based on other people's reviews. The fennel really packs a punch. The meatballs came out very flavourful. The recipe made 22 small (cocktail size) meatballs, which is hardly enough to feed a family of 4. I will double the recipe next time and hopefully have some left over for lunch. Very quick to make. The longest part was making my own bread crumbs.I am thankful for my Magic Bullet.

Terrific Quick Recipe. I added some a few cloves Of fresh garlic, 1/2 cup grated romano cheese, 1/4 - 1/2 cup minced onion (depending upon your taste). I like the texture best with 2 eggs. Definitely use Dark Meat Turkey (it's moister) & be careful not to overcook. Easy to make & a great dinner.

Delicious! I scoured the reviews,as per-usual,and decided to add in a little shredded carrot ,finely minced onion (which I also grilled on stove briefly for flavor), generous pinches of herbs like basil ,thyme and parsely.And,for an added flavor kick I ground some fennel seeds myself and threw this along with the herbs into the meat.So Tasty! And there were enough meatballs to have a quick leftovers.Even frozen,these homemade meatballs awe Waaaay better than store-bought!

Great Quick Recipe. I took advice from other reviewers: added parm/romano cheese, real minced garlic (and more of it), more onions. Use dark meat turkey for greater flavor and moisture.

could have used dried ginger ale a delicious moisterner

I added chopped fresh rosemary and thyme based on others' reviews of the recipe but left out the onion (because I didn't want to waste an onion for such a small quantity) and substituted a clove of minced garlic for the garlic powder, and it was a huge hit in my family. I usually detest meatballs because of their dense yet crumbly texture, and these were perfect--moist and flavorful and meaty without being reminiscent of bad meatloaf. I will make these again and again.

I was interested in this recipe because it was so simple but I had extra time so I added rosemary, oregano, fresh chopped garlic and additional onion (red and Vidalia). The meatballs were not at all dry and they were very flavorful.

This recipe is super easy and will please everyone in your family. It's definitely better if you use dark meat and beware of overcooking the turkey- it drys it out. Fantastic with red sauce and pasta or in sandwiches. I reviewed the recipe in detail on my blog http://misschefy.wordpress.com

Agree with other reviews about being a quick and easy recipe. In my case, I substituted curry powder for the garlic powder and served the meatballs with Bombay potatoes (a spicier side dish) and corn. Very good overall.

Tried this last night after a long day of work and it was super fast and easy! Personally, the meatballs were a little bland...I added fresh herbs - basil and oregano and sprinkled on red pepper flakes for kick! Yummy over whole wheat pasta and marinara sauce.

This was a good recipe. Very easy with ingredients I always have in the house, which made it especially appealing. Per suggestions from the two previous reviewers and from other recipes I've looked at, I added half of a shredded carrot, 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese and a sprinkling of dried oregano. This gave it more flavor. I made the meatballs a few hours in advance and then re-heated them in a tomato sauce I made and then served it with pasta. My kids loved it (and they don't usually like meatballs with their pasta). I would recommend this as a quick, easy family-friendly recipe. I will definitely make it again.

Sure, this recipe is easy, but as is, the balls are bland. Might be better with chili pepper flakes, oregano, worcestershire sauce, carrots, zucchini and mushrooms. This is a workable base recipe but needs additions for flavor.

We loved these turkey meatballs. I grated 1/2 a carrot & 1/2 a zucchini onto the mixture. The kids loved them and so did my husband!
