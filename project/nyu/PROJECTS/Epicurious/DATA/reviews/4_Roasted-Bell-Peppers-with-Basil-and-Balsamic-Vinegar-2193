You can't go wrong with roasted bell peppers! However, I remain a bit unconfident with the execution of the orange peel matchsticks.

Used the red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, and loved it! There is a little too much olive oil with the recipe recommendation, but it doesn't hurt anything. Great picnic food.

I have tried this twice. It is so simple and tastes sooo good! There have never been any leftovers which is really surprising considering that bell peppers arn't very glamorous

I have been doing something similar for years. If you are a garlic fan..add as much as you want. Try with difference coloured peppers for a beautiful contrast. On a whim, I sometimes add fresh boconccini cheese and a small chili pepper for a kick, plus lots of salt and pepper

These were absolutely fabulous. Some of the best roasted peppers I have ever had. The orange peel gave a very nice, complementary flavor to the peppers. The only adjustment I made to the recipe was to use a bit less olive oil than suggested.
