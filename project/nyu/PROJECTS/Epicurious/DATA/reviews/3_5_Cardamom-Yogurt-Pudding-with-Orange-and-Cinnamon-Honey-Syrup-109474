Delicious. The cardamom really works.

This turned out great. I used 2% fat greek yogurt. The syrup was amazing and made my whole house smell wonderful. The texture of the pudding was similar to a panna cotta. I recomment making this. Simple and delicious.

I really liked this. I used regular whole milk yogurt (not Greek or anything) which was fine. I wouldn't have wanted it any thicker. It tastes almost just like panna cotta.

EXCELLENT, one of my favourites. Note: the whole-milk yogurt (or Greek yogurt) is important to get the creamy texture and taste. If you do not have access, drain regular yogurt in a fine sieve over a bowl in the fridge overnight  extra gelatin will result in a very different texture.

I only made the yogurt part, but it didn't set up. I left it in the fridge overnight, and it was still something that could be poured rather than turned out the next morning. More gelatin, maybe? The flavor was delicious, though. I didn't make the syrup-- just the pudding and then drizzled with honey and sprinkled with cinnamon. I'll try it again some time.

This was just okay, but I might make it again. The yogurt is quite tart in the custard, so I would use Greek yogurt next time or go all the way and use cream for a milder taste. The sauce added nice balance to the sharp custard. Workable, but needs some adjustments.

Made this as written, except for using non-fat yoghurt. It was sublime. No problems getting it to set; the sauce is perfect. Yum! (with no guilt...)

excellent. served this when our health conscious neighbors came to dinner and it was a huge hit. Used chestnut honey instead of a bland one.

Added a tiny bit of orange flower water, increased cardamom a bit, used yaourt brassé (basically yogurt without gelatin already added - it has a smooth texture but a thin consistency), and skipped the sauce entirely. Next time the sauce will happen - I was just impatient this time around. I worried the yogurt wouldn't set, but after leaving it in the fridge all night it was perfect. Glad to find a panna-cotta-like recipe (without the heavy panna) to experiment with different flavors - my next will be rose water, inspired by a Lebanese dessert I had in a restaurant last year. To the reviewer who had troubles with the "hot" gelatin foiling their attempt: I noticed that my gelatin never got hot. All it took was a little warmth to dissolve it, so perhaps that's why it didn't work for you???

I loved this light and exotic dessert. It was a perfect finish for our meal. I used Greek yogurt which is very thick and I had no trouble with it not becoming solid. If you can't find greek yougurt try putting the yougurt over a mesh strainer to get some of the liquid out.

The second time I made this I used nonfat yogurt but doubled the gelatine, and it stayed firm when unmolded. Also works well with fruits other than oranges, e.g. berries or peaches, fresh or canned.

I dont understand how there isn't a single comment reflecting the very large problem I had with making this! I followed the directions exactly - but when I poured the hot gelatin into the cold yogurt, it immediately started to solidify, and the gelatin misture ended up solidifying in chunks throughout the yogurt rather than dissolving evenly! And therefore it did not solidify the whole dessert! Is it an unwritten assumption that the yogurt needs to be at room temperature or something before you mix the gelatin in?? I just can't see how to resolve this! I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to creating this beautiful light dessert for my fiance!

Delicious, and I will try this again, but it didn't keep its form after unmolding, even though I increased the gelatine by half and chilled it for several hours. This is a only minor problem if served in a dessert bowl or glass instead of a flat plate.

Overall, a good recipe. Very easy to make. I followed it closely, but it didn't really set well. I also thought it a little too sweet. Next time, I will increase the gelatin a tad bit, decrease the sugar and put a bit more cardamom and cinnamon in.

This was incredibly delicious, as well as super easy to make. I made it for a dinner party and followed the recipe exactly. My guests were delighted with it. It was a refreshing and perfect ending to the meal. I most definitely will make it again and again!

Complex flavor, but great!

We had low-fat yogurt on hand, so that's what I used, and it turned out beautifully. Light and custardy, we really enjoyed this. Like others, I went a bit heavier on the cardamom -- about a scant 1/4 tsp for 2 servings, I think. Next time I'll increase the cardomom -- we really love it around here! (BTW, Penzey's sells both whole and a good quality ground, which is MUCH less time consuming than cracking and grinding yourself) I subbed Splenda for the sugar as well, and it's great to know that we can keep low-cal/low-fat while enjoying something as satisfying and delicious as this! Yum. This will be a regular around here - especially during the summer.

Couldn't be easier! Great presentation - your guests will love it! Nice light and refreshing not to mention very different. Made recipe X6 I went a little light on the cardamom should have added a little more - that is what really makes the dessert interesting.

I was very skeptical about this recipe, as it sounded like a strange combination of ingredients, but I loved it. It has continued to grow on me; I have made it several more times, and it's better each time.

Absolutely Fabulous. So easy and so delicious! I used strawberries and oranges and both were fantastic. Fights were breaking out over the leftovers!

I played with idea of making it without the gelatin, which would have had the same flavors, but did make the entire recipe and the firmer texture was worth it. I tasted it during mixing, and did add more cardamom (obtained from an Indian grocery store, then ground in my coffee/spice grinder). I doubled the recipe, had the first serving with sliced, sugared strawberries & their juice which was wonderful. Had the second with the orange, using most of the segments from a whole peeled orange, then squeezing the remainder for juice; the cinnamon didn't conflict with the cardamom at all. With summer coming, this is definitely a keeper.

As a huge fan of custard, I have to say this was soooo good! I made it for dessert and everyone LOVED it! I ate the leftovers for breakfast and it was just as wonderful. The odd thing about this recipe though, is that is serves 1 and I had to make it for 8-10! I made the following changes: Use mandarin oranges instead of the navel orange. Just increase the honey sauce to what you need and use approx. 1-2 cups of oranges (it does not matter if you have a lot. If you do not have enough, add more!) & use the juice from the can in place of the orange juice. This makes it tasty & much less work than cleaning the orange slices. I am pretty sure I used more cardamom than called for (about 1 tsp?) Do not leave it out!! If anything, use a little extra. Also, I chilled the pudding in a large, fairly deep serving dish for a couple of hours and poured some of the sauce and oranges over the top. To serve, I spooned a portion into a glass, added more sauce & oranges & garnished with a fancy cookie. AMAZING! Simple, healthier than custard, different & wonderful!
