I used Lindt 99% cacao content instead of unsweetened chocolate for both the cake and the frosting since the only brand of unsweetened chocolate I could find was Baker's (which I don't think of as "fine" chocolate). I used Valrhona 70& cacao for the semisweet chocolate. I thought both the cake and frosting tasted wonderful (and "dark"), and that the chocolate I used probably improved the taste a lot. I made the full recipe and didn't think the cakes were thick enough to cut in half, so I made another half recipe of the cake and used that as a third layer. Next time, I'll make one full recipe but bake in two 8-in pans instead of two 9-in pans to get thicker cakes that I can surely slice in half. I added Bailey's to the coffee syrup and the cake batter. I added caramelized pecans to the the filling since I prefer some crunch, plus some toasted pecans on the side of the cake. I also added fresh strawberry compote to decorate the top of the cake. I served it with creme anglaise on the side. I thought the cake and frosting were delicious, yet coming from a self-confessed chocoholic, I thought this cake had too much of the same flavor: coffee and chocolate in both the frosting and the cake, which made it a little boring and much too rich. Next time, I'll frost it with something that has a different flavor like vanilla buttercream or Swiss meringue buttercream and leave out the cinnamon. But I'll definitely add the nuts, strawberry compote, and the Bailey's again.

I did everything but the cinnamon and instead used Nutmeg (I prefer nutmeg over cinnamon when it comes to chocolate) and left out the coffee because the person i was making the cafe for said just wanted to taste chocolate. I used semi-sweet chocolate instead (same quantity) that's what I had at home, and removed 1/4 cup of sugar and added some cocoa unsweetened powder (i like the different flavor it adds. The rest remained the same and it worked, it serves at least 10 people because (I couldnt eat it it was a gift) the birthday person said it is for chocolate lovers and a decent slice is good enough for a person. (I just recommended it to a friend).

This cake was not difficult to make, and is delicious! I agree that the frosting is incredibly sweet, but I only got compliments on it. I do like the cinnamon flavor in it, but next time I may cut the measurements for it in half. It is a little strong, but the taste definitely reminded me of a cappuccino. Great cake, tasted and looked professionally made.

I just made this cake for friend's birthday and it was delightful. My friend's request was for something with coffee and cinnamon so I did include the cinnamon and found the combination of flavors to be quite complimentary. The recipe is not too sweet as previously suggested if you use unsweetened chocolate as the recipe calls. I suspect the previous reviewer may have used semisweet chocolate, which would have yielded a too sweet product. I checked the sugar/butter proportions of other chocolate cakes prior to making this one, as suggested, and those using unsweetened chocolate were similar in ratio.

FAR TOO CLOYINGLY SWEET--this coming from someone with an enormous sweet tooth. One look at the proportion of sugar to butter should raise some flags--but I was determined to follow the recipe. I would CUT THE SUGAR IN HALF to only 1 cup. I'm surprised no one has mentioned this before. Otherwise, this had a tender, fluffy, velvety texture--I took it out 10 minutes early to avoid dryness; worked beautifully.

This should satisfy any chocolate-lover's desire for cake. I omitted the cinnamon; served it at a family gathering where it vanished in short order. Made it a second time to enjoy alone. This is one big treat! For a wine pairing, try a gewurztraminer ice wine. Life is good.

I spazzed and read the reviews after mixing the dry ingredients, but I very much enjoyed the flavor of cinnamon in the cake. I also really enjoyed the fudge frosting, which is truly fudge.

This cake is a WINNER. Lots of compliments. I was especially pleased with texture of the cake- it really is "velvety" as the recipe describes it. Some hints: Don't bother refrigerating the frosting. They're not kidding when they describe it as "fudge" - when it cools, it turns into a solid block of fudge. I refrigerated mine but had to re-beat it several times after taking it out of the fridge, and even then it kept thickening and getting hard to work with and make attractive. LUCKILLY I tried another reviewer's tip, and smoothed out the frosting with a knife dipped in hot water - the result was GORGEOUS and so professional looking. Also, this is one of those dense types of cakes, so I recommend serving small pieces with some vanilla icecream. Finally, next time I make this cake I'm gonna do it without the cinnamon, or at least less cinnamon, as other reviewers have suggested - i think the cinnamon made it a little weird.

Very rich, VERY chocolatey. It was pretty good, but not great. I would still would make it again. Definitely leave out the cinnamon, as others have suggested.

I omitted the cinnamon in both cake and frosting as I felt it didn't belong in either. I had to make two cakes for the number of people it was requested for and felt that it went together smoothly and wasn't at all difficult. I made it for a friend's birthday and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe from nearly all 30 attendees. The frosting is to die for and I agree with the reviewer who said it is good enough to eat on its own. I felt that there was just enough frosting for this cake too, I wouldn't decrease the amount as one other reviewer recommended. I can't wait to make this again. My husband is a diehard chocolate fan but only of flourless choc cakes and he loved it anyway. I also made it look special by shaving chocolate curls on top and onto the platter as well. In addition, there is no such thing as unsweetened chocolate here, so I used cocoa powder and butter for the amount needed.

Rich and dense cake. The frosting was good enough to eat on it's own! I also omitted the cinammon from the frosting. I definately make this again.

I don't understand some of the negative comments unless proper measuring of dry indgredients was not done; this cake was delicious and loved by everyone in my office that ate it for a birthday celebration. It also kept well, leftovers with coffee break were in demand.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The coffee syrup made the cake especially moist. I left the cinnamon out of the icing but put it into the cake and people raved about it. A little goes a long way, because it is both rich and caffinated.

I agree with the reviewer below me I found the cake too dry and the cinnamon flavour just over took the cake. Way too much frosting for this cake.

Dry cake! Don't bother with this recipe...find another one. Too much cinnamon.

Some of my sons found the coffee taste too much - or perhaps it was just too sweet, so the 2nd time, I omitted the syrup and just did the cake and frosting. It is terrific with vanilla ice cream..

This is a great, relatively easy cake which looks very fancy. I have made it twice for special occasions and everyone loved it. It is very rich though, so a little goes a long way. TIP: After frosting the cake I took my cake frosting spatula and submerged it in hot water then ran it across the top and sides of the cake in long smooth strokes. This created a great finish on the cake (it had the smooth, shiny look of a chocolate ganache frosting)

Terrificc. I actually baked this in a 9" X 13" pan and then split the cake in half horizontally to create layers. Everyone loved it, but thought it was too rich and immediately grabbed for their drinks after the first bite. Too cheap to buy 2 boxes of unsweetened chocolate (8 squares come in a box), I substituted two squares with unsweetened cocoa and Crisco in the frosting and it tasted no different.

made this for my son's bday party and every chocolate lover raved about it a definate hit

although it states that this cake is not too sweet everyone thought it was.I would say this cake would easily serve 12 to 14 people because it is so sweet and rich you really should slice the pieces small. I definatly thought there was too much frosting .I think if i were to make this again I would cut the frosting in half.

I love this one! It's simple enough (didn't have access to a lot of ingredients) that one doesn't need to go running for a bunch of extraordinary supplies but it still combines the perfect balance of taste and sweetness.

Excellent - I made this for my husband's birthday, and he and all of our guests loved it. I thought it was fairly easy to make, too. A couple of things: 1. I bought pans w/ 2" hight sides, but the cake did not rise all that much...maybe my baking powder has lost its zing, or maybe a pan w/ 1" or 1.5" sides would have been fine. 2. I didn't notice that it said to chill the frosting for 1.5 hours.....I put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, then mixed and frosted and it worked well. SO, you can get around that 1.5 hours.

Yummy and not incredibly sweet!

This is a nice recipe, not overly rich like some chocolate cakes. I wouldn't skip splitting the cake into four layers as the recipe directs, because the extra layers of frosting and soaking syrup really make the cake. The frosting stays pretty soft at room temperature.

My friends have raved about this cake everytime I've made it. I substitued Kaluha once for the vanilla and really liked it that way too.
