I've made this cake dozens of times for Pesach and general entertaining. Always a big hit. Now that I have a child who must eat Gluten Free this is a great option for him as well.

I'm also the Bubby mentioned by Marcy Goldman and I am so delighted to discover her delicious alternatives to the boring Pesach usuals that I schlep over in a white CorningWare dish covered with foil. Well - probably in a Tupperware container. By the way, my Tupperware collection is slowly dwindling; if you find any strays hanging around, please return them and I promise to fill them with Marcy's gorgeous goodies next Pesach.

I've already made this (and reviewed, 4 forks for sure), but I'd be interested in making it with Japanese sweet potatoes - has anyone tried it? Their taste is really close to chestnuts. Texture might need an adjustment, as they are drier than conventional sweet potatoes.

This cake is so decadent. i cooked the sweet potatoes (which was actually a orange yam) in my crockpot all day with water and cinnamon stick. i made one with semi sweet chocolate, and one with 70% dark chocolate. equally as good. i also used cream in the ganache which helped cause the cake would be a little dry without it. also tasty with frangelico drizzled over the top.

Ms Goldman's insensitive remark about me (the "bubby" she refers to) indicates that, while possibly a very good cook, she is not a human being I'd like to emulate.. I would not tolerate an anti semitic or a sexist remark such as this one and I will not tolerate this remark either. I would hope that epicurious.com will have the good sense to understand that such remarks are simply inappropriate, but if that is not the case, and this author remains on the site, I will certainly stop using epicurious.com and I will talk to my many contemporaries who I have referred to epicurious and request that they, too, stop using it.

Have not made this recipe, but the comment about "Not something bubbe would schlep over in Corning Ware with foil on top" is offensive. Even bubbe could make this, probably not in Corning Ware, but a regular cake pan. "Bubbe's" recipes are often tasty, and also beloved for their tradition. Even Bubbe can learn, too! Not necessary to be mean. Thanks, anyway.

Well, I was expecting after these reviews to be blown away and really just wasn't. The texture was indeed good - quite moist and fudgy - but for some reason I found the flavor lacking. I used Ghiardelli semisweet chocolate - perhaps not the best but certainly good, yet the chocolate flavor seemed somehow off to me. Still, I might make it again just because it's the best of the Passover recipes I've tried.

Excellent!! In addition to using high quality chocolate, I made a real ganache as reviewers suggested. It would probably taste equally as good and slightly less rich with just a dusting of cocoa powder.I will make this again!

I love this recipe & make it every year for our seder. I make no changes & it is a hit every year.

I made this for our seder. It definitely has 'wow' factor and tastes delish. The only unfortunate part is that I am expected to bring this to every holiday now!

Best part of this recipe was that I got my son to eat a vegetable without his knowing it! It was good. Not the best, but certainly worth making again. It's also a nice one to bring to a seder. I did use a little butter and cream in the ganache since we aren't kosher, so I didn't need to worry about the no milk with meat rule. I think this makes a nice, shiny topping for the cake which really adds to the flavor.

This recipe was the hit of the seder. It tasted like a thick and rich chocolate cheesecake. I was very proud to say that it was all kosher and made with sweet potatoes. I did, however, listen to one of the reviewers of this recipe suggestion to use a little butter, additional chocolate chips and cream in the ganache. It made it much thicker and easier to spread. I think this will be my new seder dessert tradition.

This torte was amazing. Nobody at the Seder last night could believe it when I told them about the sweet potatoes. In fact, one Mom proudly proclaimed "my kids ate a vegetable". Follwed the directions of others and used chocolate, butter and water for a thcik solr of ganche which we decorated with strawberries. Major hit. Very lovely, light and most importatly CHOCOLATEY! Thanks a lot

I have made this recipe a number of times, and it has become a sedar tradition. I've made it with both canned sweet potatoes (well-drained), which is much easier, as well as regular sweet potatoes. I think it is better with regular sweet potatoes. The canned sweet potatoes seem to make it too gooey. I serve it cut like brownies or petit fours and don't use any topping. It's too rich on its own, IMO. I might try a dusting of cocoa for appearances sake, except that I'm usually in too much of a hurry!

Remarkably good! Not just for Passover. I Used Smart Balance margarine and was worried - but it worked beautifully.

To die for! A great gluten free recipe all year round. I will try less egg yolks next time, as it is quite a lot. I roasted the yams peeled for 2 hours on 400'F before they were soft enough to use.

I had this for the first time tonight, and couldn't for the life of me guess the "secret" ingredient (sweet potatoes). This cake is so sweet and creamy, if I hadn't known it was kosher for Passover and parve, I would have sworn it was chocolate cheesecake. My mother made it for my kids, and once I found out it's made substantially of something as healthy as sweet potatoes, I didn't mind them eating the huge slices they asked for! (Note: I own the cookbook this is from, "Jewish Holiday Baking", and it's a fantastic book; all the recipes I've ever tried from it have turned out great - though this cake might just be the best!)

My husband was hosting his first Seder this year, and we wanted the meal to match his preparation. I chanced on this recipe--along with caramel matzah--for dessert. WOW! A major hit, and only minimal leftovers--my sole regret!

my grandma hats chocolate and so does my mom. my grandma asked me to make this again for her n her friends. has the consistency of cheesekcake. very good but i would add a little bit more sugar as it was a lil bland.

Torte had very little taste. Reminded me of Passover cakes growing up. Too much work for the result. If you are going to make it, use a springform pan & it will come out perfectly.

Very moist and a big hit! Chocolate and water didn't sound too great for a topping, so I made a cream-based chocolate ganache and dusted it with cocoa powder after refrigerating. Cut away the crispy outer edges for extra smoothness.

Rating: 4
This was very easy and an enormous hit with everyone, made using butter, no glaze. I sprinkled some cocoa around the edges and spooned cooked berries in the middle - looked quite gorgeous and professional. I used a greased springform pan, no parchment, served after removing the sides of the pan but not the bottom. I thought the texture was perfect, slightly crusted, soft and moist inside. I'm amazed that anyone can actually taste sweet potato through all the chocolate. Now I want to make a real chestnut torte and compare!

Fantastic!! This is one recipe worthy of making all year. Even my picky nephew enjoyed it. I did not like the Ganache because it was much too thin. I melted a cup of chocolate chips and added about 3/4 of the thin ganache to it. Next time I'll use 3 tablespoons of cream in the ganache instead of the water.

In the world of Passover Desserts, this deserves 4 forks (regular desserts a 3). I made this one last year and told no one the ingredients. EVERYONE LOVED it, even our non-kosher attendees. When I told them it had sweet potato, they almost passed out. It is honestly very delicious and I have people asking for it already for this year.

Rating: 4
Looking forward to making this again for Passover this year--an absolute hit! Although it looks like a super rich chocolate cheesecake, it is surprisingly light but with a huge chocolate taste. Cook fresh sweet potatoes in a crock pot the day before so they have a slow roasted flavor and are ready for this recipe.

I was invited to Passover dinner, I offered to make dessert. Like other reviewers, I was told that Kosher for Passover dessert were a waste. I proved everyone worng with this one! I even got a marriage proposal out of it. As some of the ingredients were not in line with the strict directions I was given I simply used coco powder for the finish and it was beautiful. Thanks for making me look like I knew what I was doing!

The amazing thing is that one does NOT taste the sweet potatoes . It is the mystery ingredient. I have a grandson who is on a gluten-free diet, and a pickey eater. He loved it, and I got him to eat his vegtables. And everyone else who has eaten it wants the recipe. This one is truly a WINNER !!!

I made this cake for Passover and got very good reviews. My only issue was that the glaze didn't seem to be very smooth - so I ended up adding some additional chocolate and some kosher for passover pareve whipped cream (I essentially made a ganache) which worked very well. The cake also had a slight sweet potato after taste - which was fine.

Rating: 4
outstanding! I was asked to bring dessert to a Sedar. The host said don't worry, there aren't any good Passover desserts. He ate his words after eating this torte. He and every guest, children included, said it was the best Passover dessert he has ever had. Everyone wanted the recipe. Simply delicious, light, and moist.

Wonderful Passover dessert. Received lots of good words from Seder. Have to try and top this for the next one! Very interesting use of sweet potatoes. Used pareve ingredients, but added extra sugar, sweet potatoes. Turned out very moist and delicious!

This was good, but a little soggy. Maybe draining the sweet potatoes before mixing them in would help with this. If Kosher is not an issue, make the glaze with cream... it makes the cake.

Oops, I forgot to add that I made the glaze with butter as one of the other reviewers suggested. It was a wonderful addition -- thank you.

Wow. What a surprise! I never would have thought sweet potatoes could make such an amazing torte. It was not too sweet (as most flourless chocolate cakes are), not too dense -- just perfect. This will be a mainstay in my dinner party menus all year round. Thanks Epicurious for giving us this wonderful recipe!

This dish was alright. The problem was, it still tasted like sweet potatoes. I made it exactly the the recipie said, with ghirardhelli chocolate and...well...yuck. But that may just be because i personally just don't like sweet potatoes. Other people said the dish was "good" but no rave reviews.

Excellent dessert (I serve like petit fours-cut torte into small squares, and I don't garnish at all. Light, yet rich, and everyone always asks "what's in it?' They are surprised that it's sweet potatoes!

This recipe was quite manageable and foolproof, and resulted in a very elegant torte that wow-ed a table of seder participants. I would definitely make this again, even "off-season". truly delicious! rich, yet light..and the "secret ingredient" (sweet potato) surprised everyone, myself included! i was very happy with this cake.

I made this for Passover and it was wonderful. I used an 8 inch spring forms, so I was able to make a mini sampler, yum, but made me rethink the glaze. I baked it the night before and glazed it the day of. I decorated it with fresh raspberries. It definitely needed the refrigeration over night, and glaze 'fixed" any imperfections. I also would recommend not having to move the cake. I tried to lift it to place parchment underneath before glazing and almost lost the middle. Luckily it solidified back in the refrigerator. I also thickened the glaze with butter.

I made two tortes--one for each Passover seder. The first one was tasty, but soggy;the second one was delicious and elicited lots of praise. For the first one I used the water and chocolate glaze as recommended, but it was very thin and seeped into the torte. For the second one I used 4 ounces of chocolate, 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of water. I melted the chocolate in the water over a double boiler. The butter was stirred in when I removed the chocolate from the heat. This glaze was thicker and easier to spread than the first one and did not seep into the torte at all. I decorated the glaze with shaved chocolate. Definitely, a keeper!

Great recipe for Passover or non-Passover occasions. I'm a very experienced baker-don't usually like flourless chocolate cakes- but this was outstanding. I used unsalted butter and regular rum extract since the kosher for Passover designation was not necessary for me to follow. When I turned out the cake, it cracked almost in 2 but I got it back together and froze it. It came out fine from the freezer and was very pretty when glazed. Decorated with white chocolate leaves.
