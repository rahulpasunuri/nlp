This was sooo easy and very tasty. I served it with fish and some sautéed greens; it made the perfect starch accompaniment. Used chicken bouillon instead of broth. Made half the amount since we were two, but still had a ton of polenta. Looking forward to frying the leftovers for breakfast!

I make this recipe on a regular basis for entertaining or just to treat myself. When it's just for me to enjoy through a work week, I've simplified the recipe by using chix thighs, and instead of shallots, I use 1 bag of frozen pearl onions (thawed before sauteing) w/2 cloves of garlic near the end of sauteing. Its so much simpler that peeling all those shallots (and cheaper). I find the resulting sauce a bit flat so I finish with butter and white wine vinegar(after removing chix and veg. Just gorgeous. And I always serve over/with parmesan polenta(there's great recipe for it here on Epi)

Excellent polenta! So easy and if you use instant polenta it's done in about five minutes. I added a bit more milk, a whole cup of parmesano reggiano, and a little more salt and pepper. this recipe makes a lot of polenta but it's so good!

Very good but it makes ALOT! Serves 12 rather than 6!

I made this over at a friend's house who does not own a whisk. Unfortunately, not whisking ended up making the polenta rather lumpy. Oh well. Still tasted great!

Delicious!! I used low fat milk instead of whole but otherwise followed the recipe and it was wonderful. I made an Italian Pot Roast recipe in my slow cooker and the flavors together were out of this world!! Very simple and tasty.

Awful.....this was a waste of time to make....followed directions and it ended up being mush with no taste whatsoever - not even top quality parmesan could help....

Excellent and easy. Be sure to watch the milk and make sure it doesn't boil over. Also used a 4 Cheese Shredded Mixture including Parmesan and Asiago and it was excellent. Will try next time with added some cooked shitake Mushrooms.

Simple & oh-so-yummy! This was my 1st attempt at polenta and it was a hit. I used 2% milk and it still came out creamy. Definitely making this again.

I used a quick cooking polenta and added more liquid as I prepared it before everything was ready. Turned out fab.

So so good. Added 1/4c grated Gruyere. Served with Veal Osso Bucco from which I siphoned 2T reduced gravy and whisked into polenta.

A great base polenta. I really liked the combination of milk & broth - wasn't as flavorless as just broth or water, but not crazy heavy. I added sauteed mushrooms and a heaping handful of shredded smoked gouda - delicious.

I made this recipe, substituting the corn meal for belini instant polenta and it worked fine. Cut the cooking time to about three minutes let it rest one more minute and then served. The time is from the liquids boiling.

This was my first time making polenta and everyone loved it! I made squares out of the leftovers and fried them in olive oil the next day. The cheese really makes it yummy!

I made this last night to accompany Morel-Crusted Ribs with Polenta (this site). the only thing I change was to add a little more cheese and 1 1/2 T butter. Great flavor and very rich!

So creamy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.

This was my time to make polenta, this recipe was both tasty and easy to prepare. I searved it with short ribs in a shiraz, mushroom reduction and sauted spinach. we will definatly repeat.

Followed the recipe exactly - it was easy to make but really rich!!! Polenta is a new flavor for my family, perhaps I would prefer it without the milk and cheese and with a vegetable topping to lighten it up. If you are looking for a hearty side dish - this is it.

This is one of the better polenta recipes I've used. I added a little more cheese than called for, and, as it finished too soon for my entree, found that I could keep stirring in a little cream at a time to keep its creamy consistency. Served with garlic-herb pork chops and got raves from guests. Polenta (not just this recipe) typically is a little bland, so be sure to serve it as a counterpoint to something highly flavored.

Really good. I'm just starting with polenta and often find it be bland and lacking. I too used 2 cups skim milk and 1/2 cup cream (I never have whole milk in the fridge it seems) and lots of cheese. I used a le creuset heavy pan and a silicone coated flat whisk and no scorching or sticking at all (I did have to stir in about a cup of boiling water halfway through cooking as it was getting wayyyy too thick). Delicious. One final note: unless you are using unsalted broth, the tsp of salt would likely be overkill (even the low salt broths are salty, and parmesan is as well).

Mmmmm. Creamy cheesy goodness. It was nice with the Italian Chicken with Mushroom-and-Wine Sauce

Great polenta recipe. I made this without using any of the parmesan at all and served it with the "chicken with port-mushroom sauce" recipe on this site. It was wonderful. I will definitely make it again using the parmesan when I want a cheesy polenta. It's a great versatile recipe.

This was good if you like polenta???? If you don't like polenta why would you make it? All polenta should be eaten right away or spread out to dry and then cut up. This was a good, simple polenta recipe. Some people.

This was good if you like polenta. The big problem was that you had to eat it right away or it became like paste and got very gummy.

Great polenta! I used a full cup of cheese too.

This is my favorite parmesan polenta recipe. I do increase the cheese to 1 cup. I made it last week to go with the "Short Ribs Provencale" recipe and it was just so good. I stuffed the leftover polenta into a bread pan and then cut slices the next day and sauteed in a little olive oil for breakfast (with some sauteed mushrooms). This is rich, but oh so good!

Having never made polenta before, I thought this was delicious. Had Italian friends over for dinner and they loved it! I will definitely make again.

This was delicious! Paired it with the Naked Chef's Slow Spiced Lamb Shanks and my husband loved it! Used 1 1/2 cups non-fat milk and 1 cup cream instead of whole milk and added 1 cup parmesan cheese as was suggested. Will make this again!

This dish is very easy and delicious, we are serving it all the time. I added more butter and parmesan cheese at the end. Everyone raves!

Simply delicious! I had never had polenta before, and I was quite surprised at how good it was. I used part cream and part 2% milk because I had no whole milk. The pepper and parmesian gave it wonderful flavor.

This was my first attempt at polenta. I used a mixed cheese of asagdio, parm, and serveral others (prepack stuff avbl at the store). It turned out ok, but it needed a sauce or something to spice it up. I served it with a rosemary seared pork chop and that saved the recipe (I think it was the rosemary). If you do the same make sure your meat has a sauce.

The first time I had polenta and it was just great. So creamy and very complimentary to the chicken. I think it would go well with pork chops. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was the creamiest polenta ever. I made it for my entire family and it was a huge hit. I have made it at least 6 times since. My 2 year old can't get enough of it!

yummy yummy yum yum. Made it on recommendation with a chicken dish and it was splendid! Don't forget to add the corn meal GRADUALLY while constantly whisking otherwise it won't turn out well. There was too much left over so I chilled it in a loaf pan, sliced it and used it in altered lasagna recipe.

I made this upon the recommendation of the Italian Chicken with Mushroom-and-Wine Sauce recipe. This was the first time I've made polenta, the second time I've eaten it. Polenta fans probably would consider this top-notch; even reduced-fat parmesan and 2% milk made it taste incredibly rich and buttery. I'm just not a polenta fan, though. BTW, add the cornmeal very gradually so that it doesn't clump together; I struggled to mash the clumps the rest of the time. Also, even though I whisked constantly, the pot bottom was covered with a stubbornly, cooked-on layer that took many soakings and scrubbings to remove - from a teflon pan, believe it or not.

I made this for the second time last night. Words cannot describe how tasty this polenta is yet so easy to prepare. I substituted a combination of skim milk and fat free half-n-half for the whole milk. I can't wait to make it again!
