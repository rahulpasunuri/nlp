Made "as is". Very delicious. I used fresh herbs. Pork took roughly 30 min for me. Pork is super tender and juicy. Sauce is amazing and easy to make. I may have added a bit more Port. Beautiful and highly recommend.

I made the recipe at first with the cranberries and then as leftovers, we had the roast pork with "Green Olive and Coriander Relish". First sweet, then savory. The pork was so tender and moist - at first and then again as leftovers. We will make this again.

Excellent. Be careful not to serve the cranberry sauce smothered over the pork though - the flavors could be overwhelming. With the sauce served on the side this is great.

Made as directed, and also again with pork loin roasts (tenderloin is not my favorite). Both versions were delicious and received rave reviews at my holiday gatherings. I did all the advance prep I could, and it worked beautifully.

Was familiar with this from previous experience and decided to return to it for the family Christmas dinner as a break from the expected ham or prime rib. Together with the polenta triangles and green beans with shallot butter, this is a symphony of flavors and textures. Started with a smoked fish pate, followed by the salad with manchego cheese and pears from Epicurious. Family tradition dictated a Coconut Cake for dessert, and the one from Bon Appetit December 1999 drew rave reviews.

I know why this recipe has gotten consistently great reviews over the years. The pork is so easy to prep the day before and the sauce is easy to put together and reheat the next day. I could not find cranberries, frozen or fresh in January so I used dried cranberries - I also did not strain it as detailed in the recipe. It was delicious chunky! I made it with the Rosemary Polenta Triangles and the Green Beans with Balsamic Shallot Butter on this site. I would make all of them again. 4 forks for the whole menu from the October 2001 cover of Bon Appetit!

Fantastic!! Easy and delicious, as all but the actual roasting of the meat could be done before guests arrived. A definate keeper and would make a lovely alternative to turkey on Thanksgiving.

I decided to try this recipe after searching for a new meat dish to serve at a family get together. I have never prepared pork like this, but this recipe is PHENOMENAL!! I would highly recommend this to anyone. It was SO easy and everyone raved about it all day long! I tripled the recipe and cooked 9 - 1 pound tenderloins and tripled the sauce. I did not double the port/cornstarch like some others did to thicken the sauce, for fear of the sauce having too much of a port flavor. I did let it sit for a little while though to thicken, and then reheated it right before dinner service. It was perfect, and no one could get enough! I will absolutely make this again, and highly recommend this to anyone who likes easy dishes. I did not prep the day before, but that would make it even easier! I am not a gourmet cook by any means, but this recipe sure had everyone thinking I am, and everyone asked when we could have it again!

Rating: 4
I always brine all cuts of meat for 1 day prior to cooking. In place of the orange rind, I used a leftover kumquat. I also added more cornstarch as the sauce wasn't quite thick enough. The sauce dresses up any dish, such as green beans and mashed potatoes. I roasted the tenderloin to 143 degrees, but forgot to brown it first; no big deal as I don't usually sear meat anyway.

Rating: 4
I made this last night for my supper club to make something that seemed like fall but wouldn't just be a Thanksgiving preview. They loved it, and especially loved the sauce. The sauce was a beautiful color, and the sliced pork with sauce on top made a very nice presentation. My husband pronounced it one of the best meals I've ever made. I didn't have an orange on hand, so I just left it out and increased the port/corn starch by 1/2. I also used olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil, and it took 35 total minutes for the pork to reach the right temperature, but it was extremely moist and juicy, with no pink. I've never made pork roast before, and I couldn't believe how easy it was. The sauce is definitely worth while; it's complex and delicious. I will follow other reviewers suggestions and make double next time!

This has become one of my "go-to" dinner party recipes. It's delicious, beautiful, and easy to prep ahead of time. I use a meat thermometer that beeps when the desired temp is reached, so we can be sitting down enjoying our first course without having to constantly check on the roast. The cranberry sauce is excellent, especially if you throw some of the onion mixture back in. I highly recommend this recipe!

Rating: 4
This dish is a winner! I've made it for dinner parties, holidays and so many other times...all to rave reviews. There's something about the combination of the thyme crust and sweetness of the cranberry sauce that elevates it above the normal tenderloin dish. I've also served it with the polenta triangles and haricot verts as shown...delicious.

Rating: 4
I love this dish and the cranberry sauce is good with anything you would normally serve cranberries with (i.e. turkey). The first time I made it I followed the recipe to a T, but the second time, I modified it a little and it was really tasty. I made the sauce the day before, and instead of just tossing the solids (onions, sage, orange peel, etc.), I added a bit of oil and some more port to them and used it as a marinade for the pork. I marinated the pork overnight, then roasted it as specified. Although I do not really brown the tenderloin--I just sear all sides to seal in the juices before roasting it. This is how I always cook pork and beef tenderloin and most types of fish--it never gets overcooked or dried out. I highly recommend this recipe.

Rating: 4
I think this is an attractive presentation and offers advance preparation which people seem to like when entertaining. I don't bother to saute the pork - just bake it at 325 for about 35-40 minutes. I have taught this in a class and also served it at catered events.

I'm not quite sure I understand the reviews that say that the sauce isn't worth the effort -- the sauce is not difficult to make, and it is outstanding. I recommend cutting in half the amount of salt used in the thyme mixture that you rub on the pork tenderloins -- if you use the recommended amount, you'll need to have a pitcher of water handy. Other than that, this recipe is outstanding. Excellent with mashed potatoes.

Made this main course for friends , plates were cleaned and recipe requested. The sauce was not as labor intensive as previous reviewers seemed to indicate. It was an easy dish when you make the sauce ahead and pan sear the pork earlier in the day and roast at meal time - I served it with oven roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes. The presentation was great. Served a Clos du Bois Merlot.

Both my sister and I made this for our boyfriends, and now they are our soon-to-be husbands. They both describe it as the best dish ever. I suggest trading out the cranberries for sour cherries and cherry juice. It pairs very well with Ferrari Carrano Fume Blanc.

Rating: 1
I agree with the reviewer below: the sauce is ok but not worth the effort. The instructions seem needlessly complicated. Why, for instance, do they tell you to place the pork in a "baking dish" just to put the oil and seasoning on it, only to then put it in the hot skillet? It's almost like a pan-sauce recipe written by someone who never learned how to make a traditional pan sauce and is trying their best to re-invent the wheel. I also thought it was too sweet and prefer a more complex sauce.

Sauce is not worth the trouble. Too sweet or my taste. There are much better rubs for pork than this one.

I made this twice following the exact recipe, except I cooked the pork a bit less. I had leftover sauce the 2nd time I made it, so I froze it. 2 days ago I made this dish with the leftover frozen sauce and pork chops (rub the thyme, salt and pepper on pork chops and pan fried in butter & olive oil mixture for 4 minutes each side). It turned out fabulous. The sauce got more concentrated and developed even more flavor. Don't be afraid to make more sauce and freeze some for next time.

Great dish. The cranberry/port sauce went perfectly with the pork tenderloin. After straining the sauce, I added back some of the onion and orange zest. I made only 2/3 of the pork, so I have a one pound piece left over; I think I'll try crusting the pork this time.

To the cook from White Bear Lake, Minnesota: if your sauce didn't turn out bright red, you didn't cook the cranberries long enough. I found the sauce a little too sweet, so I added more cranberries. I used ruby port instead of tawny which gives a nice colour.

I just made this for an early Christmas dinner for friends and they all loved it !!!! Everyone asked for the recipe. It's a good recipe for a dinner party because you can prepare much of it the night before , gives you more time with your guests. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled the cornstarch after reading some reviews of the sauce being too runny. Just wonderful !!!!

Rating: 3
Here's my view on the dish: Too much salt on the pork (I knew this when I was putting it on but I followed the recipe anyway). That's pretty easy to fix. The sauce was just a combo of the WRONG flavors. I fixed it this way: I eliminated the orange peel, replaced ALL the chicken stock with more cranberry juice and used cabernet instead of port. The result is a more flavorful and beautiful sauce. The color of the original sauce was sort of puce and my version is a beautiful ruby red. I'll be serving this to 50 people at a retreat I host so I hope I made the right changes. If so, it'll be a 4 fork recipe!

This dish is delicious! I too had trouble finding fresh or frozen cranberries so I used canned whole berries. I reduced the liquid requirement by 1/3 and omitted the sugar completely and it was wonderful. I added back a small amount of the onion mixture for texture.

I thought this recipe was great. Like other readers I wanted to make it recently and cranberries are not available. I made it eith rasberries and it turned out excellent. The rasberries are much softer than cranberries so I added them in frozen just at the end of making the sauce. Also, the sauce is great in the fridge for a repeat dinner 1-2 weeks later.

Made this for a sit-down for 12. Used 4 tenderloins, browned them before guests arrived, and used a meat thermometer to ensure they were cooked to medium. I did thicken the sauce 2X, as it was thinner than expected. They turned out just great, an easy prep for alot of guests. Great reviews.

I made this recipe for an intimate dinner party and everyone loved it! The sauce is the perfect mixture of tang and sweetness, which compliments the pork beautifully.

This was possibly the best pork tenderloin I've ever made. The cranberry sauce was to die for. Definitely make it ahead of time to let the flavors meld.

Served it with parm mashed potatoes and french green beans--yum.

This is an amazing and simple recipe. I even know some one who served it at a very formal catered Christmas dinner for 30+ guests! Everyone said it was the best they had ever tasted. Try it for yourself! I often substitute whatever red wine I have on hand for the port, and it is still wonderful.

I made this for a dinner party. It got rave reviews. I did make a few modifications. I felt like it needed a little kick so I added a couple of (rather mild) fresh red peppers to the sauce and let it simmer a while. Also, I found that when only a small amount of sauce was poured over the tenderloin, it tasted kind of odd. But if I applied the sauce liberally, it was fantastic. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I'm not much of a cook but I was tired of the usual turkey/ham for Christmas. This was absolutely the best!! My guests raved and I will definitely make it again! I did substitute 2 cans of whole cranberry sauce for the raw cranberries and reduced the amount of liquid. I think it worked very well.

This was very delicious, and beautiful presentation, especially for the holidays. I did feel the sauce was a bit time consuming, yet the plus is you can make a day ahead. Also, I don't understand why you have to chop the onions finely, (again, more time consuming), since you end up discarding them anyway. I feel you could just cut into chunks and separate, to save time. All in all, I will make again, and will be making sauce a day ahead!!

Delicious holiday meal with a great sauce. Not the sweet and thick traditional cranberry sauce but a spicy one and it goes perfectly with the pork. I made the sauce one day ahead and just reheated it, didn't put it back to the pan and didn't add the extra orange peel. It was still really good.

Even after making various substitutions with the sauce this was wonderful. I cooked the pork until about 135 degrees and then let it come up to temperature while wrapped in foil on the counter. I was afraid the amount of sage would prove to be overpowering, but it was fine for two tenderloins. I will definately do this one again, only with all the proper ingredients

This is a fantastic recipe. I highly recommend it for company or midweek. The sauce doesn't require much work and it dresses the tenderloin up marvelously. I served it with sauteed rainbow chard, which made for a nice presentation on the plate. P.S. I'm not much for keeping track of details. I made this recipe without the thyme, of which I had run out. I also had to substitute fruit juice for cranberry juice because I didn't see that it called for cranberry juice until I was in the middle of cooking. Still -- the dish turned out superb.

The Cranberry Port Sauce with this pork earned raves at a recent holiday dinner party. The leftover sauce dressed up steamed baby carrots later in the week.

We loved this dish. This is the only way that my husband ever wants to eat pork tenderloin now! He constantly asks me to make it for him.

Excellent dish. A tip I use to thicken a sauce that may need it. If your recipe has a butter content - as with this - add a little roux until you reach the desired consistency. If no butter, or you are concerned about the fat content, use cornstarch and water.

While cooking this dish, I commented that it had better be phenomenally good to go through the trouble, since there's a much, much easier recipe on this site for pork tenderloin with cranberry balsamic. I'm glad I didn't give up. It was a BIG BIG hit and tastes perfect. As for the sauce being too runny, you simply need to cook it longer so that it reduces more to thicken up. I can't wait to eat this again, even though making the sauce is pretty intensive.

I modified the recipe since at the last minute, I realized I had overlooked buying cranberry juice. So I used orange instead and omitted the orange peel. The flavor was excellent. Same comments for me - time consuming sauce and the sauce was too runny. I just made it for my husband & I but it will definitely go on the list of "things to serve when we have people over for dinner." I would also probably half each cranberry so they're not so tart (I have a sweet tooth!).

Part of my holiday food list from now on. (only one change. I have reduced the salt and pepper coating on the meat. The thyme is great, during my test dinner, my husband almost fainted.) Much better with less salt and pepper on the coating. Yummmy.

This dish is wonderful! I made a stuffed pork loin (with cornbread & green onion stuffing) and then used the seasonings from this recipe. It turned out great! Also, the cranberry port sauce is fantastic; I had leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving and used some of that to supplement. Everyone wanted the sauce for the pork AND their mashed potatoes. Definitely a winner that I will make again and again.

This came out great. I used a very nice madeira instead of port as the flavors are pretty similar. This is a good one to cook for a crowd.

I loved this recipe too. I used pork chops instead though, and did not have any port, but used sherry (a good one) and used the whole berry cranberry sauce left over from thanksgiving. Also added a touch of orange extract, and orange juice, but no peel. We loved it. Served with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.

Yummy, and the leftovers make a great sandwich!

I used a boneless pork loin rather than tenderloin. Altered the sauce by using 1 T orange peel, 1/2 the amount of cranberries, and 1 heaping teaspoon of Milnor's Chicken Base. The results were well received by my client and her 40 guests!

I LOVED this recipe! It was easy to prepare, but still elegant enough for a fall dinner party. I served it with a butternut squash risotto which complimented it perfectly. I have already passed this recipe on and will certainly make it again.

The pork in this dish is fantastic. The flavor is wonderful and it turned out perfectly. The sauce is where the recipe could use some improvement. It is just okay. I think it needs a little kick-will probably add a dash of balsamic vinegar to it; or make it with dried cherries instead of cranberries next time.

I made this for a family dinner party and although it was well received, I personally thought the sauce was a little too sweet. It looked beautiful! I served it with wild rice with toasted hazelnuts, brussel sprouts and Cape turnips.

I was a little disappointed although my family enjoyed this. I did substitute loin chops for the tenderloin. If I make this again, I'll go with the tenderloin.

A straightforward dish that tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen!

This recipe went over very well! I made it for my mother who is trying to watch fat intake, and for my fiance who can be kind of picky. Both loved it. I had to make a few substitutions/adjustments based on what I had in the house. I had pre-made cranberry sauce and a bottle of cabarent-sauvignon. It worked fine. I also added mushrooms and dijon mustard. I'm not a big fan of cranberries, but I loved this too. I served it with pesto penne and petit peas. A great fall meal!

I have made this for 4 different people who have all raved about it. The sauce is a nice change of pace for pork. It is a very impressive dish that is easy to make.

Awesome and easy. Made this in advance of a dinner party to test it out. My husband raved about it and we will be serving it at the party. I made extra of the cranberry sauce since we like sauces.

Very Easy to make and delicious. It was a big hit with all of the guests at my dinner party.

Delicious and beautiful. Loved the cranberry, orange, pork combo. I skipped the step of browning the meat in the skillet (time and mess) and it still turned out great. I just used the pan in which I roasted the meat to heat up the sauce and deglaze.

This was ok but my husband and I prefer the recipe with cranberry sauce and balsamic vinegar that's on this site. We found this a little too sweet for our taste. The other recipe is easier, too.

This is excellent: the colours, texture and taste!

My husband, an avowed pork hater, loved it. The leftovers made great sandwiches (with the sauce) the next day. The prep time was a little longer for each step than the recipe stated. Maybe it was my stove, but I did get a little frantic, since I was making it with a friend for a dinner party. Happily all of the guests were late! Would make again for a holiday dinner. You were also right about the wine choices. We served both a rich Chardonnay & a Cabernet. (& didn't have any wine left over!)

Made this the weekend before Canadian thanksgiving to raves!Had some of the cranberry sauce left over and combined it with additional cooked cranberries to serve instead of my traditional, sweeter sauce on Thanksgiving day. The sauce was savoury and again, rave reviews when served with turkey.Will definitely make again

A friend tested this recipe for Thanksgiving, as an addition to the turkey but as a substitute for the usual ham. It was delicious and beautiful.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I agree that this would be a great dinner party recipe, since you can have it finished in advance and just heat it up before company comes.

This was fabulous!! I enjoyed making it and even able to get creative with the port by substituting a red. It made for a beautiful dish and wonderful leftovers! I can't wait to make this again!

Forget my previous review. That was for the pork tenderloin with Cranberry Sauce. THAT recipe is easy to make and full of flavor. If you like this one, you love that one!!

I also prepared the full menu this recipe was included in - everything worked well together. My guests loved the smoked trout appetizer and soup -and raved over the green beans. I made a few exceptions - I used less fennel and more potatoes in the soup, used fresh herbs throughout the menu and I prepared a chocolate cake for dessert. The cranberry sauce was good, but not as good as I might have expected. I think I would improvise the next time around, use less onions, more sugar, and more port/cornstarch. The pork was perfectly seasoned and very tender. Overall, the dinner was a wonderful success.

I prepared the whole dinner in the October 2001 issue - smoked trout appetizer, green beans, polenta, pork tenderloin and pear fig strudle. (I substituted leek and potato soup for the fennel soup.) It was wonderful. The prep was very well explained and I did most of the cooking the day before. The food was great, I had most of the work done before our guests arrived and everyone was very impressed and had a wonderful time. I'm looking foreward to preparing some of the other menus.

Used this recipe for our Couples Gourmet group, but substituted boneless pork loin roast for the tenderloins. Very easy, non-fuss recipe - and very tasty. The pork is very flavorful even without the sauce. Perfect dinner party recipe - I had every thing done the day before, and just had to throw the roast in the oven and warm up the sauce. We also served the polenta and green beans from the same article, and they were wonderful together.
