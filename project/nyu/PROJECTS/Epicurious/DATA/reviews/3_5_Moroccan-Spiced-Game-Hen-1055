Excellent recipe. The only change I made was to add some lemon zest to the spice rub. Also let marinate for a couple of hours prior to baking. The flavor was really good. I think this recipe will be my standard for cornish hens from now on.

Simple and delicious. Next time I make it (and I will), I will add a bit of olive oil to the spice mixture to make it a bit easier to distribute under the skin

Though easy and good, it lacks flare.

I don't know what's wrong with the tastebuds of the cook from Burlington, VT, but this dish is wonderful and very flavorful. Instead of cayenne I use ground chipotle. Yummy!

This has become a new all-time favorite in our house. I leave the hens whole for each person, stuff each with a piece of lemon and tie up the legs. If you leave them whole, you have to bake for about an hour, but it makes a gorgeous presentation.

YETCH!! This was the worst recipe I have ever tried here. Boring, bland. What a waste of a game hen. And I love trying different things.

I'm a novice to say the least and i was able to make this tantalizing dish with no problem. It's easy, quick and well worth the pay off. I paired with mint yogurt (yogurt, milk and salt sometimes with cucumber) and goat cheese mashed potatoes as one reviewer wisely recommended. And my severest critic loved it so much they were unable to suggest any changes. That makes this dish not just deeeeelicious but mirrrrraculous! Fantastic!

I have made this recipe many times, most recently for my fiance's parents, who asked for the recipe! It's my favorite poultry recipe, I think, and it's very hard to overcook. I cut the hens in half and rub about 1 Tbs. olive oil onto them before roasting.

I've made this a number of times.

This was stellar. My husband, who made this, served it with fresh peas and mint --the mint was a good complement to the dish. Next time, definately the couscous and carrots. He says that after you stuff the spices under the breast of the bird, put it in the refrigerator for at least an hour so it can marinate.

This was delicious, quick and easy! It needed a bit more spice. Next time, I'll definitely double everything. But it was wonderful (and very juicy) as is, accompanied by the goat cheese mashed potatoes, which worked really well on the side. My husband loved it too!

Very, Very good. It was easy and fast to make.

My husband lives for this recipe (I think it's good, but not as good as he does). Make sure to have the butcher at your grocery store cut the hen for you, it makes this recipe *loads* easier.

Simple and good. Definitely serve with the couscous. I also accompanied it with grilled Med. vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, etc.) and a "raita" of yoghurt mixed with cilantro.

This was so tasty and easy! Loved it!!

Fabulous! I also kept the hens whole (for presentation). The spices gave the meat a wonderful flavor. The carrot salad and couscous (used pistashios instead of almonds) were perfect complements.

Very nice recipe. Very high result/effort ratio. The spices meld very well with each other. I added some white wine to the roasting pan about half-way and used the drippings for basting. To finish off the hens, I broiled them for about 2-3 minutes to get the skin crispy.

I've made this twice and both times it was fabulous. I roast the hens whole instead of quartering and I save the pan drippings, add a little extra spice rub, chopped shallots, some chicken stock, and white wine, and reduce to make a spicy savory gravy. I serve them with roast cinnamon rubbed sweet potatoes and wilted greens. Yummy!

I made this for supper after work and after exercising the dogs for an hour on a very hot humid day. An excellent choice, it was easy to prepare and was delightfully pungent. The suggested carrot salad made for a refreshing foil, and the nuts in the couscous added texture.

I made this for the first time and my guests loved it. I cut the hens in half, used powdered ginger in lieu of fresh, and added a splash of OJ to the paste mix. Served w/basmasti rice (slivered almonds, raisins, shredded carrots and orange zest)and steamed broccoli and had chilled orange slices sprinkled w/ground cloves and honey for dessert.

i have made this dish over and over. We also grill the game hens and serve with a spicy couscous.

An excellent main dish for a special evening. We had "A Night in Morocco" with several guests, and this recipe is worth the time and effort. The sauce was a bit viscous when boiled down, but scrumptious nonetheless. We did vary it a bit; we grilled the marinated hens instead of baking. A nice alternative.
