We thought it was good, but not amazing. Maybe a chipotle chile would help. The Spanish paprika was not very hot.

Absolutely amazing!

I made this for our Gourmet group as an appetizer (see Bobby's menu) - rave reviews all around. The tenderloin (very expensive!!) was so tender and the flavor so fantastic. We actually coated the skewers with all the glaze about 6 hours before grilling - so much flavor.

Made this easy recipe to test my new outdoor infrared grill--used a cheap sirloin to test this and it was delicious, easy, and everyone loved it. This would be a good baste for pork as well.

Truly the best beef kabob I ever made. Quick and easy too! Resist the urge to turn them too quickly or often and let them have nice grill marks. Brush your grill first with a little oil. The whole family loved them!

Excellent. We used beef tri-tip steaks and marinaded them in the glaze overnight. The flavor really penentrated the meat and it was so flavorful. Even our picky 8 year old who doesn't like marinated meat enjoyed this.

This works very well on other cuts of beef if marbled well enough. Loved the smell in the kitchen and they tasted great. Pretty much followed recipe exc I used Hungarian paprika and stone ground mustard as I didnt have any whole grain. Served with kicked up scalloped taters and drank a cab franc. Delicious.

Great flavour...I used sirloin & it still delicious...definatley a keeper

Excellent! Very good flavor and easy. Marinated only about 45 minutes and it was still full of flavor. I cut back on both mustards just a tiny bit, per the other reviews, and it was perfect. I also used smoked paprika, which was in my pantry, and it added a nice flavor dimension. Will definitely add to my list of "regulars".

Very, very delicious and very easy. Most of the ingredients are always in the pantry. Tenderloin is low calorie, yet this glaze gives it incredible flavor. I will make this a summer favorite for the grill.

Fantastic! Made this with grilled red potatos with the garlic lemon aioli. Will make this again soon.

I used this recipe for pork tenderloin (as a cheaper substitute) and it was perfect! I did cut back on the mustard a little after reading earlier reviews, which allowed the other flavors to balance the glaze a bit more. For such as simple preparation,the flavors are complex and intriguing so I am going with 4 forks!

I have used this for both tenderloin and for pork and it is excellent on both! I either marinate pork chops or I slow simmer pork in the sauce and both have gotten rave reviews with my dinner guests.

Rating: 4
A strongly-flavored marinade that's more like a paste and could easily overpower the meat. For a party, I doubled the marinade, then split it into 2 Ziplocs. Added red wine to one and white wine to the other to marinate beef and chicken, respectively. Will definitely do this again.

I made this for a supper club dinner and everyone raved about it. I used tenderloin along with grape tomatoes and baby bellas on the skewers, marinated the meat for about 8 hours - great flavor. Will definitely make again.

This became one of my go-to BBQ recipes this summer. I love the flavors. Made it with both sirloin tips and filet, both worked well though I thought the sirloin was more flavorful. The grilling worked better for me without the skewers, and its pretty easy with a hot grill to get a yummy caramelized charcoal coating on the outside of the beef. Excellent!

I give this 5 Forks! for flavor & quick & easy prep. Served as a main course with pieces of sweet onion between steak. Wow'd everyone! Definately a Great Recipe!

I'd give this six forks if I could. I've used it on tri-tip that we put on the charcoal grill. The first time I left it in the marinade a couple of days. The second time I had only 6 hr to let it marinade. There was no noticeable difference. I use Creole mustard for the whole grain and maybe a little more rosemary from my plant. For years we have grilled out at least once a week, so I have made my share of different marinades. I believe this is the best marinade for beef I've every made.Thanks to Bobby Flay and epicurious.

a waste of good ingredients. the mustard flavor was overpowering.

The glaze was very delicious, I followed one person's suggestion about using sirloin...not such a great idea. I will make this again but use the less tough tenderloin!

Very, very tasty. Great way to use those trimmed pieces off of a whole tenderloin after you've trimmed and portioned out your steaks. My teenage son and daughters left nothing but the lingering aroma.

Very, very flavorful and perfect for company. I made it exactly as it directed and the flavors were excellent. One thing, I used 2.5 lbs. of tenderloin, served 4 people and it was all gone! Perhaps the 2 lbs. in the directions were meant for appetizer portions? And forget the fat jokes, mean reviewers, we weren/t piggies.

This recipe was easy to put together and extremely flavorful. I will definitely be making this again. I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

This has become my standard glaze for beef tips. Very good!

Rating: 4
I hardly ever rate something 4 stars, and I also hardly ever eat beef because I am so picky about it. All that being said, this was really excellent! First of all, I marinated beef loin sirloin tip (less expensive) in the glaze for 5 hours. I do not have a grill, so I preheated the oven to 375 and then heated a grill pan sprayed with olive oil to very hot and seared each side for about 2 minutes. Then transfered to the oven for about 6 minutes. There was a nice collection of juice in the bottom of the baking dish and flavor was wonderful! I seldom rant about dishes or make them twice, but I could eat this over and over again.

Yum. This was excellent. We used the much cheaper sirloin steak tips and marinated them for a half day. They came out beautifully.

Rating: 3
Good dish. I used sirloin instead of the more expensive tenderloin and it was quite tender. I also marinated it in the glaze for 5 hours or so and skewered grape tomatoes and baby bella mushrooms with the meat to add some veggies. Make sure to use high heat and resist the urge to turn them to ensure a crusty coating on the meat. Looking foreward to using on pork.

I made this as the recipe called for with beef tenderloin as well as with a bonless leg of lamb and it was delicious for both.

This was a very good baste. Thanks Eddy from Chicago for pointing out that it wasn't a marinade. Made it for Father's Day and was a big hit with everyone. The reason I only gave the recipe 3 forks was because I used fabulous filets, that were fabulously expensive, and while the baste was very tasty, grilled filets are very tasty even without any baste.

I didn't have filet on hand, so I decided to try it on a small pork roast - it was delicious. Used half as marinade and half as glaze while it was cooking on the grill. Wonderful flavor. Try it with pork, you won't be sorry.

Haven't made this yet; just read the reviews. Reading between the lines, I would guess that some people used the "glaze" as a marinade. As a glaze on tenderloin grilled for 6 minutes or so, it will only complement and not ruin the delicate taste of the filet.

Made this for my gourmet group - it was a big hit! I used a top cut tenderloin and cooked on a very slow fire. Meat came out tender and delicious!

This was delicious and a huge hit (we served 15). The only downside is the expensive cut of meat, but it was really great.

Will try again but unsure if this is the best use of filet. Quick appetizer if you have a small amount of filet.

My boyfriend and I love mustard and powerful flavors, so this was a fantastic marinade for us. Delicious and aromatic. I used smoked Spanish paprika from Williams-Sonoma, which is out of this world. It's actually quite strong though, so we tasted more of the smoked paprika than we did mustard (we didn't mind). Next time, we'll try the marinade on a fattier cut of meat, as the tenderloin dried out relatively quickly on the grill.

What a shame to waste good filet on this marinade. I so looked forward to making this and it smelled sooo good on the BBQ, but the taste was terrible. The spices overpowered the delicate filet. May be more appropriate on a tougher grade of meat. What a disappointment :(

These were very awesome! I marinated them for about 8 hours and the rosemary flavor was heaven!

This is a real nice recipe. I doubled it and used it on tenderloin and some boneless chicken as well. 45 minute marinade and still tasted great. The tenderloin definitly tasted better than chicken but of course its 3-5 times the price.

I would actually give it 2 1/2 forks....I did use hungarian hot paprika because that is what I have and it gave it heat...which I like. However, if you do not like mustard you will hate this. I personally loved it.........kids and hubby were not quite so impressed. The mustard is overpowering so maybe you could tone that down a bit.

Wow - that is one tasty recipe! Easy to make and quick-cooking too. I couldn't find Spanish Paprika so I just used regular and it seemed to work. My husband is a meat snob, and he loved it, too. A definite winner!
