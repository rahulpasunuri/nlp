OMG..this is one fabulous recipe! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used beef stock and thought I needed to double the sauce as I was making it for 6...WRONG! There is plenty of sauce in this 4-serving receipe for 6-8 shanks. I served the shanks with Emerald's Risotto and Wild Mushroom Casserole (sorry epicurious) and sauteed broccolini. For dessert we had Roasted Pears with Hazelnut Syrup and Candied Hazelnuts from this site. YUM!

Wow. Terrific. Husband couldn't stop raving about it. I couldn't believe how good it was. We can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow. Also, one note: I made two 1 lb. shanks--we shared one for dinner and will share the other tomorrow. Highly recommended.

Terrific osso bucco recipe, the orange peel in the braise was a great addition! Made it with the mushroom risotto Bourdain recommends. Added a bit of white truffle oil to the risotto and it was devine!

This recipe is fairly simple and great for making for a large dinner party. All the work is done hours ahead of time and once guests arrive, all you have to worry about is sides and plating. Every time I have served this, it has been a huge hit. A couple of helpful hints. Veal demiglace can be hard to find. I generally use low sodium beef broth which works just fine. Also I am not crazy about the parsley in the gremolata so I use scallions or chives instead. And don't use too much orange zest or it can get overpowering. Lastly, the meat will be so tender that it falls off of the bone so I use a spatula under the shanks and tongs to lift them out of the pan so that they don't fall apart. Serve over egg noodles or with mashed potatoes. It is DEEE- licious! You can scoop the marrow out of the bones while you are eating and spread on warm bread too. Yummy.

I made a minor modification & we loved it. I added 8 cloves of garlic, since we love garlic and I waited till the last few minutes of sauteing the veggies to add it in. Some have complained about a bitterness, and this maybe due to over cooking the garlic if it burns it gets bitter. I also added young whole baby potatoes to the pot for the last 45 minutes of braising and then served them on the side...this would also work if you wanted to mash them afterwards as they came out perfect and tender.

This was SOOO good. I got the shanks (about 2" thick) from Plowboy's Market OC, CA ($12.99/lb.). I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and used low sodium beef broth for the veal demi-glace. I actually added 3 teaspoons of beef bouillon granules to the beef broth and omitted the salt. I'm not sure the gremolata is worth making because the shanks and gravy are so wonderful. I served this with mashed potatoes and a caesar salad (kit) + garlic toast.

This recipe proves that classic and simple is the best. This traditional take on a classic dish is superb. Most home cooks will not have access to a whole pint of veal demiglace. It is hard to make and rather expensive in prepared form. If you cannot get demiglace use some reduced low sodium beef stock. Awesome dish.

I made this for my husband's birthday, and he loved it! The house smelled amazing, the meat just fell off the bone. I will make this again and again!!

This was excellent. I did add a few more garlic cloves but otherwise followed the recipe right until the end. Then when I took the pot out of the oven and removed the veal, I strained the sauce, reduced it, and served that over the veal, omitting the gremolata. Served with mashed potatoes - delicious. Next time I will plan ahead and make a day in advance, which I think will enhance the flavor even more.

This is an exceptional osso buco recipe. I used organic farmed raised veal shanks, which themselves were outstanding. The only change I made to the recipe was that I added more garlic than just one clove- it seemed like too little. I ended up adding about 5-6 cloves and it was perfect. I served it with mashed potatoes and turnips with rosemary. Yum.

This is the best Osso Buco recipe by far. I have tried a few others including Mario Batali's and they do not come close to the deep flavor of this one. This is very easy and perfect for holidays/special occassions. The wild mushroom risotto recipe that is linked to this recipe is truely the perfect side.

This was excellent. The gremolata is a must, it brightens up the flavors. I had a lot of sauce left and used it to make a pot of veal stew.

One of the best recipes I have ever used, absolutely wonderful! I substituted the veal shank (couldn't find it at any local groc.) with a ribeye roast cut into steaks (from Costco) and it was even better than planned. Also used beef broth instead of demiglace for great results. Placed the Braised meet and juices over the mushroom risotto for a perfect dish!

This is the perfect dinner party meal. It is delicious, fool proof and you can do much of it ahead of time. Plate the osso bucco first and then the sides because the sides will cool quicker. I served with mashed potatoes and broccolini. A huge hit!

Melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The gremolata finished it perfectly. Served with Creamy Polenta with Parmesa & Gruyere. Took 2T of reduced gravy and added to polenta. Not gamey like lamb osso bucco I've made in the past.

This was so delicious. A big hit with the whole family.

Excellent recipe. Was confused about the demiglace- does the recipe really mean to use 2 cups? I compromised and followed the directions on the demiglace jar- but reconstituted with twice as much demiglace to cover my bases. Time-consuming, but fabulous.

This was fabulous. I have never tried nor have made this and it turned out great. Great for a dinner party of 4.

I have made this with veal shanks, lamb shanks, and stew meat. Every time, the meat is delicious. The stew is uncomplicated and easy to prepare. Even my fussy 9 year old will eat it without too many theatrics.

This is a good osso buco--weirdly almost identical to Terrence Conran's--...Like another reader, I also add a little citrus peel, but I use only half of the wine (white), and add 2 tablespoons of a very smoky Scotch Whiskey, such as Ardbeg.

A wonderful recipe, indeed, this is classic osso bucco at its best. I used tawny port instead of red wine, and it was sooooooo good ~ deep, rich, smokey flavor. The best part about this recipe is that all the work is done ahead of time; I had plenty of time to get ready and enjoy the company of my guests before we sat down to eat. I did not make the mushroom risotto as suggested, instead I made fried polenta which soaked up the incredible sauce beautifully. This is not as time consuming and difficult as one might think, so try it and enjoy!

This is a very good osso buco recipe, but I think I like Sara Molton's better. Her's uses less tomato, white wine (though I use whatever leftover I have on hand) and has an addition of lemon and orange juice and zests before braising. This gives an extra layer to the depth of flavors in my opinion. This dish is definately better the next day.

One of the best!!! I make this the day before serving. Believe it or not,it's even better...if that can be possible! I'm giving this one 5 forks!

Super comfort food!!!!! The price of this dish was a little on the high side, but well worth it after the first bite. I did not have the demi glace, instead I reduced a good quality beef stock and added 2 beef boullion cubes for a deep, rich flavor. Worked great and the sauce barely needed any thickening at the end .I thought the key ingredient was the grated orange peel in the gremolata sprinkled at the end. A+++

I do not eat osso buco but I made this for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and it came out great! Make sure the shanks are tied because they WILL fall off the bone!The sauce was amazing...the demi glace is the key. I served it with the wild mushroom risotto drizzled with truffle oil and my guests LOVED IT. My sometime vegetarian friend could not keep her hands out of the pot and my boyfriend ate the leftovers for several days.

This is a wonderful recipe that my dinner guests loved and I would definately make this recipe again. I made the recipe a day before and cooked it for 1 hour, the next day I finished cooking it for the remaining 1.5 hours. The sauce was very flavourful and the veal tender.
