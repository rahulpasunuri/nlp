I have made this for dinner parties on several occasions now. It always gets rave reviews, and is so simple to make.

Delicious and so simple... though haven't figured out a way to eat them without the cream squeezing out the sides!

I have liked this recipie for last minute, impressive dessert. It is easy to adapt--halloween with a drop of orange food color and halloween sprinkles on top; pink whipped cream for valentines day, red and green with peppermint flavor for Christmas, etc. I have made it with home made refrigerator chocolate wafers which have made it extra tasty. Typically I only use 3 cookies per stack.

I received rave reviews on this dessert. Instead of the OJ, I used 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract and 1/4 cup of Splenda. I also used 1 teaspoon of the whipped cream in between each cookie instead of 1 tablespoon. Delish!

The idea of this recipe is great! A girl in my class made it with very thin chocolate cake stacked with orange cream, orange zest on top. She made an orange sauce to go with it that completely made it! It was also very pretty :]

This is a great recipe. It's flexible and you can get creative with it. I made two different kinds here, one as the recipe stated, and one with thin ginger cookies. Both work really well with orange. I added a little bit of vanilla to my whipped cream and it gave it a bit more of a dreamsicle flavor. I read the other reviews and reduced the orange concentrate to about 1/4 cup. Think of the possibilities with other flavor combinations! Definitely getting book marked.

I have not made this particular recipe, but a nearly identical one with bananas instead of orange whipped cream. I make whipped cream in the usual way: one pint of whipping cream, 1 tbl sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I put the whipped cream on a cookie and add two thin slices of fresh bananas (enough to cover the cookie with the whipped cream). The next stack repeats with bananas and whipped cream for each layer. Rest of procedure is the same as the recipe except the last cookie on the stack has a whipped cream topping (no banana on the last stack) Always a favorite.

I have made this receipe twice for dinner guests, one including children and they all loved it! I cheated and made the whipped cream with the oj concentrate in my whip cream whipper. It was perfect! Definitely a keeper, simple, tasty and lovely presentation.

Beautiful presentation, delicious and best of all, so easy! My guests loved this both times I made it, first with the orange juice concentrate(I only used 1/4 cup - perfect) and the second time with mint...I topped it off with grated semisweet chocolate and an "after eight" mint.

I've made this a few times now and it has always impressed. It is so simple and a great light dessert that everyone will take even after a big meal!! I add Cointreau to the whipped cream. It's fabulous!!!! Also, you can use any type light cookie. I can't find chocolate wafer cookies so I use a thin orange flavored and spreak a thin chocolate layer on them.

I can't agree more with the other users. I loved the presentation and the taste was wonderful, but it was very difficult to make peaks. I read and reread the recipe thinking I might have done something wrong. Thanks for the other suggestions!!!

Simple, simple, simple, yet very sophisticated. Fooled a number of people.

Was unable to form stiff peaks. The orange juice concentrate way was too strong. If I ever made this again, I would use only half the amount of concentrate. Guests were impressed by the visual presentation, but overwhelmed by the flavour!

Had a very hard time with the whipped cream - had to go out and get more and start over 3x. The cream and OJ concentrate would not whip up at all, and definitely not to "stiff peaks". I ended up using orange extract and Triple Sec to flavor the 3rd batch of cream. Other than that, the presentation was very nice, and the flavor was good. Would probably make again, but not with the OJ concentrate!

I made this for a women's club at my church and received rave reviews. I also shaved chocoate over the top and did not add any of the orange juice. I added vanilla to the whipped cream. Everybody thought it looked so good--and it is so easy!

Made this last night for my bookclub. Very pretty and super easy to make. I shaved chocolate over the top and skipped the orange zest. Next time I will just use sweetened whipped cream as the filling.

The back of the Famous wafers box recommends making a long log of the stacked wafers and cream, then frosting it with whipped cream and cutting slices on the diagonal to get a pretty striped effect. This is a nice variation. Try other flavors of whipped cream -- vanilla, mocha, chambord.... this is an easy but delicious recipe.
