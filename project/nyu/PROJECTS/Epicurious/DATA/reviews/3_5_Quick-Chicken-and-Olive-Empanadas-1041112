I forgot the tomato paste, but the filling was fine without it - a bit dry, but easy to handle. Also, I couldn't find the gyozo wraps, and substituted refrigerated hot dog wrappers (like pigs in blankets) - anyway the little buns that resulted were great. We called them "American Samoa Samosas" and served with ginger chutney.

The filling was very delicious! It reminded me of the empanadas I used to eat in South America. I added chopped eggs to make it more authentic. This recipe is for keeps!

I made this using the Cafe Azul's pastry dough from this site. It was fantastic. I added a bit more cumin, a dash of curry and doubled the garlic. I omitted the bread crumbs as it has plenty of carbs with the dough. I used chopped carrots instead of peppers. Very complex flavor. Guests really enjoyed it.

I made real empanada dough, from the Pork Picadillo Empanda recipe found on this site, but used this chicken filling for half. Everyone preferred the chicken! The filling mix here is great. Definite recommend.

These were in fact easy to make, and were just as good baked in actual empanada dough, in a 375 degree oven until browned. Would definitely make it again. Easy to make variations, with other vegetables and herbs.

I made this dish for two parties and was forced to give the recipe to everyone! Absolutely spectacular! Note: it was much easier for me to find actual frozen empanada wrappers in my grocer's ethnic foods aisle or at a Mexican grocery store than to find the potsticker wrappers! The empanada wrappers are probably easier to work with and tastier, too.

This recipe was delicious. I used pastry dough and made individual empanadas, so it took time but it was well worth it. I rolled out the pastry dough really thin so that the buttery taste did not overpower the filling. Also, i made sure there was a lot of filing in each one. My guests loved it!

Very yummy, I made these for a pot luck and they were demolished with complements. I did add more olives and raisins to taste as well as a dash of cinnamon and used pie crust instead of the wrappers which is why I only gave 3 stars but it become 4 with easy alterations:)

My husband, being Venezuelan, was aghast at my making empanadas using wonton skins, but he ended up eating more than anyone else! They didn't last long. They freeze beautifully and cook straight from frozen. A definite 'do this again' recipe.

Really good. But the only quick part about this recipe is that you get to use won ton wrappers. Filling and frying still takes a while. The flavor was wonderful.

These are very good. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and sprayed them with oil and baked them at 350 degrees. I didn't use all of my filling on the first day. When I made the next batch, I added some mild shredded cheddar, and liked that batch even more.

This is very good and very easy. They were inhaled at my party.

I have made these several times, both with chicken, porabella mushrooms, or both. My husband and I do not care for fried food, so I spray a little olive oil on them and bake them for 12-15 minutes in a 350 oven, until crisp and brown. I usually make a double batch and freeze several for quick lunches. Pass the salsa!

We have made this dish over and over. It is an easy appetizer that is hard to mess up. I used a food processor to grind the stuffing. We topped them with non-fat yogurt and tomato salsa. Also good with pheasant, quail and chucker breast.

This was a very good-tasting addition to our Cuban-theme dinner party. For vegetarians, I substituted cubed portabella mushrooms for the chicken. It turned out excellent; my wife said she liked it better than the ones with chicken. If you make it with mushrooms, it tends to be more moist, so you may want to increase the amount of bread crumbs.

I made this dish for a dinner party of 14! They didn't last long. These were GREAT. I plan to make them for the next party. Everyone loved them.

I made these empanadas for a New Year's Eve party. The were quite delicious. I would make them again. Next time I will make them for a small dinner party. Maybe 4 or less people. Making an appetizer for a crowd of 14 was too difficult.
