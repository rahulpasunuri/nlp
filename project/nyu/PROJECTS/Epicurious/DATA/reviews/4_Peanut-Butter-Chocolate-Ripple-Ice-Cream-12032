I am making a peanut butter ice cream using a different base than this one, but I wanted the chocolate ripple recipe from this one. It did not come out at all. I tried reading reviews b/c the ingredients didn't sound right but it seems few actually made the chocolate ripple part of the recipe. I thought the chocolate would seize mixing it with water and it did. I also found it took liquidy and too sweet. The search continues....

I changed the recipe. I used 1 cup of light cream, 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of half and half. I also mixed 2 eggs with the sugar and tempered it with the hot cream and crunchy peanut butter. We didn't have enough chocolate so we used peanut butter M&M's.

Delicious. I swapped marshmallow fluff for the chocolate ripple. It floored everyone who tried it.

This ice cream was absolutely wonderful! It was the easiest ice cream I have ever made and quite rich. I also did not add the chocolate ripple because I wanted to be able to use lots of different toppings with this ice cream (grape jelly, chocolate sauce, dulce de leche, bananas, etc, etc). When I was making this I noticed that my peanut butter would not fully incorporate into the milk and I had to whisk the base together (it separated) after chilling in the fridge for the ice cream maker. I think that this happened because I used Smart Balance peanut butter. In the end it didn't matter because the ice cream came out with a perfectly smooth texture.

This was a big hit at our latest dinner party. We omitted the chocolate ripple and opted for Reese's Pieces instead. We checked out the blog entry mentioned below (kitchen perfectionist) and followed her suggestions. The ice cream is EXTREMELY rich, not overly sweet, and very yummy.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and SO easy. I used natural peanut butter and 2% milk. I was a little worried about not using the whole milk, but it turned out great. I noticed some separation when the peanut butter melted, so I actually put an electric beater to the mixture for about 5 minutes after adding the vanilla. This actually accelerated the cooling process and turned out amazingly smooth. I omitted the chocolate swirl, but stirred in some chocolate chips which gave some crunch and tasted great. This is VERY peanut-buttery, so if you're looking for something more subtle, you may want to try another recipe or cut way back.

Amazing. I am not a huge ice cream fan in general, but I am hooked on this. easy to make, and delicious exactly as is. It is very peanut buttery, so if you are not a PB fan, this might not be for you.

Understanding it's p.b. ice cream, it's still overkill on the peanut butter. Balance of flavor is not there.

3 forks as is. 4 forks once i pimped it out with half milk/half cream, fudge swirl and tons of peanut butter cups. check out my adadpted recipe here kitchenperfectionist.blogspot.com

This didn't freeze *quite* right when I used chunky organic peanut butter, but still tasted great. Will try again with regular creamy and see what happens. So great to be able to make ice cream without heating up eggs!

An easy recipe as you don't have to make an anglaise base. Pretty rich and I used chunky because we like crunch in our ice cream.

YUM. I made this with reduced fat peanut butter - I was nervous that it wouldn't melt properly, but it did. This is a great, easy recipe for peanut butter lovers, either with or without the chocolate ripple.

I made the ice cream for an Iron Chef competition at work featuring peanut butter - and WON. It's super rich but not too heavy becuase there isn't any cream. I left out the chocolate ripple and will definitely make it again.

This rocked! It didn't even make it to the dish!

Excellent. Also didn't freeze too hard or too soft.

I make a 5-course meal for my Mom for her birthday every year. This last year, I made this ice cream, using bittersweet chocolate for the swirl, to compliment the peanut butter pie she wanted for dessert. This was wonderful, quick and easy. Although making ice cream on Christmas Day was a little weird. The only possibly negative comment I have is that this became rock hard in the freezer and was very difficult to scoop.

Great and exquisite and simple recipe. I used chunky natural peanut butter and 2%fat milk--it turned out great!! Highly recommended.

This will probably seem like overkill to some, but it also works to use a high-quality chocolate milk in place of the regular milk. I wanted the chocolate-peanut butter flavor, but didn't want to make the ripple, so I just substituted chocolate milk. It is truly excellent.

I adapted this recipe to impress a visiting vegan, using Rice Dream (regular, not enriched or flavored) instead of the milk. Used Arrowhead Mills Valencia peanut butter, which has especially good flavor. When you simmer Rice Dream, the starch thickens. The result is astoundingly smooth and fabulous. Substituting Amaretto (almond liqueur) for the water in the chocolate ripple part probably helped too. I don't normally approve of Rice Dream -- looks like milk, but has next-to-no protein and not a lot of vitamins -- but now I'll start using it for vegan and pareve things.

Regular peanut butter is too sweet and thin for this recipe, so I recommend using organic peanut butter (basically, just mashed peanuts and oil), which will give a more balanced flavor. I like that this recipe uses whole milk instead of cream, as that makes this ice cream not quite so rich. The consistency is quite unusual and almost does not taste frozen. An exceptional dessert -- quite a good complement to a simple meal on a warm evening -- best when eaten outside!

Wow, this is so rich! It's really more like frozen peanut butter than ice cream, but it's pretty good. I highly recommend it to those who love this combination. I feel that it would have been better with more ice creaminess to it, I substituted heavy cream for some of the milk.

This is outstanding! I can also suggest that you can make it sugar-free by substituting 12 packets of Equal, after the mixture has cooled. I have also substituted some half and half for part of the milk (2/3 cup). It is one of the few recipes that have converted well to eliminating sugar!

I used crunchy peanut butter instead - scrumptious! The bits of nuts were a crunchy contrast to the smoothness of the ice cream. I'm wondering how it would taste with hazelnut butter...
