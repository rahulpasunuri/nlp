I've been making this bread for years. And for years I went through the whole cider-boiling routine. Now I just substitute a quarter-cup of thawed frozen apple juice concentrate. I really can't tell the difference. I also can't be bothered with zesting an orange so I substitute a few drops of orange oil that I always have in my fridge. And yes, you have to check it before the 1-hour cook time is up to make sure the top is getting too dark. Otherwise, everyone always loves it and ALWAYS asks me for the recipe.

Just made this today. I used unpasteurized cider from an apple farm instead of the "dead" cider you get in supermarkets. Really adds a bit of an edge to the bread. It's flavorful, but could use some additional "oomph" with ground ginger added to the spice mix. Also, the batter almost overflowed the 8x4" loaf pan - there were some edges I had to cut off to slide a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen it. But I'm not sure if a 9x4 pan would be better, as the it would be more shallow and perhaps cook faster than it should. But I do like the flavor. And my coworkers should enjoy it tomorrow as well. :-)

Greetings Home Cooks, It is important to plan ahead when wanting to serve a delicious "quick bread". Wrap and store bread overnight before slicing. Why Wait a Day to Slice? Quick breads require a little patience. The day they're baked, they're just too soft to slice. If you try, they'll break and crumble. Store them tightly wrapped for a day and they'll firm up enough to slice cleanly and easily.

Have made this recipe serveral times over the past few years. I've not had any problems others are reporting. It always comes out nice and moist and very flavorful. I don't always have time to wait for cider to boil down, so I usually just substitute a 1/4 cup of apple juice concentrate. I've never been able to tell the difference. I usually make several loaves around the holidays to give away.

Wow. I have not made anything this bad in a long time. Could barely eat one slice then threw it out. Followed directions 100%. Found it extremely sour.

The bread was too moist. To it's credit, it's not greasy or oily, but it's pretty bland. Also the top burned early in the cooking process. Needs more spices, an din larger proportions. The apple cider flavor overwhelms the pumpkin flavor.

WONDERFUL!!! I have made this a couple of times now. Each time it is great. My picky 2 year old son loves it. Big Hit with my family and friends.

One of the most versatile fruit- or veg-bread recipes I've ever made. I make this constantly, varying the veg or fruit used, the spice, and the flour, and it has not let me down ever. The fiddly apple-juice-reducing step can easily be omitted or modified. Can be made with a wooden spoon or whisk so no clean-up of a mixer required.

This pumpkin bread is similar to others but definitely more moist then most I've tried. I made it for a group of women at a gathering and everybody loved it. I too increased the zest (with organic oranges so no bad pesticides which reside in the orange skin of commercial inorganic varieties) Very easy to make. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and for a "Fall-theme" baby shower. The second time I made a mistake and grated too much orange zest but it came out so much better than the first time! I would increase rather than decrease the zest and I also think reducing the cider is what gives it just the right flavor. Also, if you're not so hot on nuts, it's just fine without them.

I have been making this recipe for years and its great. My trick is to use 1/4 cup of frozen apple juice concentrate -- it is much less work than reducing the cider, and I usually have it handy in the refrigerator.

Like other comments, I too decreased the amount of zest and increased the soda and powder. Also, I increased the amount of cider to at least two cups and let that reduce to 1/4 cup, I also added a couple cinnamon sticks and the spices to the cider as it reduced. The bread had a great flavor, but the overall recipe is just alright. I prefer the Spiced Pumpkin Bread that can also be found on this website.

Left out the orange zest, and used melted shortening instead of vegetable oil and it turned out great. Better after it sat a day or two.

I followed the advice of two cooks with comments here and increased the soda and powder and decreased the zest to 1 tablespoon. It was a great tasting bread, moist inside firm outside. The cider is not a strong flavor in this recipe but it gives the bread an extra zip. Try it!

Quite disappointing, and dry. Too much orange zest, and too little apple flavor.

Very tasty! I increased the baking powder by 1 tsp and the soda by 1/2 tsp. This gave it a little more volume

This bread is moist and delicious, but 2 tbsp of orange zest overpowers the other flavors. Next time I'll use one tbsp or less.

Was wonderful- easy and elegant for a quick bread
