DELICIOUS!! I found that it needed about 1 tablespoon more butter and I used half & half instead of heavy cream and served it cold on a hot humid day. My husband, who hates cold soups is now a firm believer!

Exactly what I was looking for, a very good basic recipe for leek & potato soup. Easy to make, too. I could definitely see adding more cream if you want a richer soup. Also I tried tarragon instead of parsley as another reviewer suggested and didn't care for it, I found that the tarragon overpowered the other flavors (but my husband loved the change).

A great basic recipe. I use dill instead of parsley and add bacon. YUM!

Eating this now right out of the pot. I used just as many potatoes as leeks and added carrots and some tarragon. Delicious.

added truffle oil and guda cheese.... turned out amazing

I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken broth; left the peel on the potato; added a pinch of saffron; and finally pureed everything except the cilantro (this I added after). All resulted in a very delicious, hearty, though not too heavy, soup.

I made this soup on a chilly, rainy day, It was perfect and very filling. I doubled the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of butter and a bit more cream. (this is definitely not the low calorie version). It was delicious. Miss Piggy

This is somewhat like a warm vichyssoise. I remade this for my lunch and did the following: I added the same amount of leeks to potatoes. Added some ginger root and some ground cardamom seeds as well as cracked pepper. When the potatoes where done I passed the blended mixture au chinois. Upon serving I added a filet of heavy cream and some parsley. Next time I am thinking of adding a zest of orange. What do you think?

I've been making this soup for a number of years and as I am standing here making it once again I thought it was time to add my two cents... It is a wonderful, quick and harty soup. I agree with Sydney Australia - fresh leeks and a flavourful potato make all the difference. My family loves it.

I cannot understand why anyone would find this soup bland. It is meant to be subtle in its flavour. By using the right kind of potato and leeks when they are in season will make all the difference. The parsley should not be left out and nor should the butter and cream be skimped on. It is these things that give that extra flavour dimension and round out the soup. My partner and I loved this and he thinks this is nicer than the Vichyssoise recipe from the 1960s that appears on this site. I love both.

Excellent for cold, winter days. I substituted celery leaf for the parsley, and also added 3/4 tsp fennel seed for extra flavor. Garnished with gorgonzola cheese..really tasty!

This is an excellent soup just as is. People who complained of this soup being bland shouldn't try recipes that are low in spices. This soup has a lovely light taste of potato and leek which is what the soup's name is. You want something with kick try Mexican potato leek soup or ask Emeril to 'kick it up' for you.

Very good winter supper. Modifications: upped the garlic to 3 cloves & used about 5 tbl. of cream. Fresh parsley is a must. I think cooked ham or even a leftover ham bone would add some good flavor; bacon would be overpowering in what is essentially a light dish. Save some leek greens for garnish.

It is really good, but I was glad that I read the earlier comments the second time I made it - using red potatoes was better.

After searching for years for a perfect soup for Thanksgiving dinner - this one worked. I wouldn't call the flavor bland, I'd say it was subtle. We use vegetable broth instead of chicken to accomodate our vegetarian friends. We also garnish it with chopped chives. Guests ask us to pack up leftovers of this for them, so I'd say it was pretty good.

I added cooking sherry and a bay leaf and substituted cilantro for parsley. This greatly improved the taste. My soup was thin, maybe I needed more potato or less broth.

I tried this to see if the added complexity improved the basic recipe. I was underwhelmed. The basic recipe is still the undisputed winner, that is: 1 cup sliced leeks, 1 cup 1 inch square cut potatoes, 2 cups water, salt and pepper to taste.

I love potato leek soup and I have been looking for a good recipe. Well, I am still looking. This soup was bland and looked awful. The family hated it.

A very simple and elegant starter. I used yellow potatos and a hand blender, not gritty at all.

This soup was really quick and easy to make and tasted really good. I suggest adding celery in addition to the onion. Be sure not to over blend in your blender...that will give you the undesirable sandy texture described above.

Soup was nor good. Possible I used wrong type potatoes or didn't cook long enough. Once pureed the soup was gritty and when it cooled the potato was like wet sand. Had to descard. Very disappointed. Suggestions welcome. Used Burbank Russett potatoes

This soup was not very popular when my family tried it out. There should be more spices or veggies involved--it was quite bitter and a little bland when I made it. My mother enjoyed it, but everyone else said, "Well....it's okay."

It was fine, but nothing special.

To make it more nutritious as well as tastier, try using unpeeled red potatoes (provides some nice color too!) and use "fat free half and half" instead of cream. I also added red pepper flakes, and -- just before pureeing -- a goodly amount of cilantro (even more color!). Since I didn't have leeks I just used onions. So report me to the food-snob police.

The recipe was a good starting point. I used bacon and cooked carrots, onions, garlic and leeks in the fat then reduced white wine. I also added thyme, sage and red pepper flakes. I also added red pepper after blending 1/2 of the soup.

Rating: 3
Excellent with some modifications: Instead of butter I used 3 strips of bacon cut in one inch pieces cooked over medium until all fat was rendered ... then browned onion and garlic in bacon fat and reserved bacon to be crumbled and added at the end of cooking. I also, added 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme and pureed all but one cup of the soup before serving.

I substituted turkey drippings (strained and frozen from the last time I baked a turkey) for the chicken broth. It added the richest flavor! I used a hand held mixer to blend the soup, which was not as messy as using a blender. I also used dried parsley and it didn't seem to compromise the flavor. I will definately make this again.

Incredibly simple to make...I increased the garlic to three cloves since we love garlic and used chicken broth that had roasted vegetable bits (which made for nice color in the broth). Also, I used thyme instead of parsley and 2% milk instead of cream. I thought the consistency was perfect, not too thick or too watery and it looked great too. Made wonderful leftovers for lunch the next day.

Tried it with one cook's suggestion of cooking sherry. Actually forgot the heavy cream. But I did add an extra potato. Pureed 2/3 of it so it still had chunks. Topped with a few croutons. Excellent and simple dish. Would make a nice, light, vegetarian dinner with crispy french bread and a salad.

I've made this recipe several times since it first appeared in the 1997 issue. I substitute evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream and add a lot of fresh ground black pepper when serving. Great comfort food that's relatively low fat with the substitution.

Found this soup to be very bland even after adding garlic and scallions. I would not make it again.

Right from the start this recipe needs help...there was no flavor content...we decided to start with bacon and garlic to add flavor. Used the drippings and cooking sharry to saute the onions,leek and potatoes...then continued with the rest of the recipe. We processed 1/4 of the soup in our VitaMix machine and added a pinch of terrigon. Once all was combined we thought the soup looked and tasted more like a chowder..we added corn! All at the table were delighted!
