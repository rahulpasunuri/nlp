I made these for the second time this year and I'm sorry the previous reviews are so unenthusiastic. These cakes require a lot of prep work but the results are absolutely delicious. The important thing is to really soak the cakes, the longer the better, and let them sit for three to four weeks to develop their full, complex flavour. They are rich, and each mini cake can easily serve four to 6 people. They are best eaten as an afternoon or late evening treat, not as a dessert, and they make great gifts for discerning friends.

I added dried cherries, dried pineapple to this recipe, and it really was authentic in flavor. Delicious!

I made this last year one week before X-mas. It wasn't ready. It was dry. However, after 10 days of brushing them down with frangelico every few days, they were absolutely delicious. I'm making them now for New Year's Eve.

This recipe sounded great and I was very enthusiastic about trying it. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as I expected. The Frangelico was too overpowering. I followed the directions and kept them chilled for the minimum time but it was just way too strong. I also used the minimum amount of Frangelico (it just turned out that way, wasn't planned). I even had a hard time giving them away. What a waste...

AWESOME!!!!!!! Just be sure to chop the nuts and dried fruits finely. The cakes are very dense and rich - we only ate 1/2 of one per person. The chocolate sauce is divine. Great holiday dessert.
