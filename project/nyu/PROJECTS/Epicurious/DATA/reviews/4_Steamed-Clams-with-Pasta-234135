This is EXACTLY what I wanted tonight! Delicious AND easy... with lots of juice to sop up with crusty bread. Loved it! I'm adding this to my rotation for quick weeknight dinners (to have at least as often as we feel like splurging on clams). I even through in some cherry tomatoes, which was great. My husband even said to put more tomatoes in next time. We'll be making this one again and again!

Simple, yes - but delicious. And easily customizable. I used basil and oregano instead of parsley, and shallots instead of garlic - basically, you can use whatever you have in the kitchen/garden. :) Oh - and I totally agree with Mequon - some nice crisp white wine makes a big difference. :)

Great and quick. My husband said it was good enough for company. Sorry to the guy who said it was like PB&J...some of us need the basics and this one is a keeper.

Exceptional because this is a classy, quick dish my 10-yr- old will actually eat! He requests it regularly. I serve the hot peppers on the side, and add a dash of nice white wine too.

Absolutely delicious, and super easy. The crushed red pepper is a crucial component.

This is the second recipe I've read this week on this site that should not qualify as a "recipe". Next thing, you'll have a "recipe" for pb&j!

Very nice recipe. I did add 1.5-2 cups of good white wine to clams for a more flavorful broth for topping the pasta.
