I made these from the magazine before I read the reviewers' comments. Had I read them, I wouldn't have bothered, and I won't make it again. I struggled and ended up making them just as chezshea instructed--if you are interested in this recipe, follow what she says. Even so, I didn't like the flavor or the grease of this dish. There is a recipe for parmesean fricos on this website that is similar but much better.

Very easy and impressive. Let them cool completely for the crispiest texture. Be patient taking them out of the pan. If some of the cheese starts to tear while taking them out of the pan, cook for a minute or so longer. I did not find them to be greasy, perhaps due to the high quality cheese I used.

I've made these three times now. Tricks: preheat the pan for the first batch, over low heat (don't add cheese to a cold pan). Once the pan is preheated, I found that I could crank these out pretty quickly. The heat needs to be just right ... enough to melt the cheese and turn it golden brown. Then I found it was easy to slide a thin metal spatula underneath and lift them from the pan, and then drape them over a rolling pin. To those who said they were too greasy: I wiped the rolling pin after each "batch"; removed from rolling pin after only a few seconds and put on a metal rack. My husband and I and guests thought they were great. Once I made them a day in advance and put them in zip-lock bag and they were fine. I found them to be very crispy (though I would not attempt on a very humid day). If you don't cook them enough (til browned all over), they will not be crisp.

Way too greasy. Now I understand why you add flour, freeze and slice.

easy to do with a little practice. good with out the caynne too. Great "crunchy" for atkins dieters.

Funnily enough, I inexplicably quadrupled the cayenne pepper in the recipe. Even funnier, the extreme heat this resulted in was the only redeeming thing about this recipe. While I did manage to get a crispy texture, probably by using a really good pan on low heat, the entire idea of a chip made entirely of cheese is something that may need to be left to the theoretical rather than the practical. This recipe can make even the most accomplished chef look as if they had an accident while trying to make nachos.

As other reviewers have said, these did not come as crispy as advertised. But my husband, like so many others, is on the Atkins diet and desperate for something with a crispy mouth-feel and that looks vaguely like the salted snacks he has left behind. He was quite pleased with them so I have made them now a couple of times. I will make them again, following the recommendations of the other reviewers.

Lacy? Chips? Crispy? Blobby is more like it. And when I finally got it "right" I was doing them one at a time. Naw, too much trouble.

This can be accomplished much, much more easily by using a Silpat and baking them. Refer to the Parmesan Crisp recipe on this site. I usually omit the flour or cut it back on that recipe. It doesn't have the lacy texture...but it isn't nearly the pain to make.

This recipe can be made in a much easier manner. Set your oven to broil, about 350-400. Put the cheese in small piles on the cookie sheets. Watch carefully... as soon as the cheese gets really bubbly, pull out of the oven - This works well with any kind of cheese! Note - you don't have to make the chips "curl" to make them taste good, but if you choose to, use something metal or glass and spray it with coooking oil. (A drinking glass works well!)

Have to agree with other reviews that it takes longer than 4-5 minutes. I worked on other things as they were cooking, so time-wise it wasn't too bad. You just had to keep an eye on them. I thought they tasted pretty good, and my guests all liked them. I had two complaints. 1)Mine didn't really achieve the "crispiness" I was hoping for. 2)Visually they didn't look as "lacey" as they did in the magazine. Not sure if that was too much cheese or what. I didn't think it made for a very attractive presentation. I think in the future I'd just use cheese straws or something similar.

This dish just doesn't work. I did have some success after waiting longer (8 minutes + ) just as some of the other cooks have stated, but I was forced to do them one at a time and they ruined my rolling pin in the process. If you still want to try, put foil on the rolling pin first. The flavor is ok, the process stinks and the results are only iffy. Not worth it.

Yes, patience is required! But they certainly disappear much more quickly than they appear...in my enthusiasm I also tried this with pepper jack. Also yummy! I can't wait to experiment with different cheeses and different seasonings.

These require PATIENCE! They are not hard, but it's tricky to decide when they are ready to go - I found (on my stove) that 4-5 minutes were not long enough on low for them to be removed... so, i ended up on a medium low for about 8 minutes... they looked beautiful and tasted great! But don't get frustrated, they'll work for you - you just have to watch them, and play with them to see if they'll pick up...

Delicious and so easy! I used preshredded cheese and cooled the chips flat, so they took much less time. Addictive!
