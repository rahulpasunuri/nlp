note re the calorie count: the "classic" version of an apple galette could give you the high count. Notice at the bottom of the recipe where it has nutritional info that this version is considerably lower in calories, as you would expect from a "healthy" dessert !

I followed the recipe exactly. I did make my own pie crust though. I had to roll it out a second time, my first attempt with 12-inch diameter did not allow me to use all of my apple slices. I used 3 large Pink Lady apples. The recipe is easy and relatively quick. Loved by everyone who tried it. The ginger really added a wonderful flavor. I highly recommend that you include it. It is a wonderful alternative to regular apple pie with little more effort. Will definitely make again.

Sooo good, soo easy. I've made it with and without the ginger and it's great both ways. It will be gone by the end of the day. Great dessert, snack, breakfast, or just because! Also-- it looks gorgeous.

The intro says the "classic". This version is from Self magazine is it's obviously a low-cal option.

Haven't made it yet, but calorie count is suspicious. Introduction claims 480 calories/serving and Nutritional Info at end shows 178 calories/serving. The latter sounds more reasonable
