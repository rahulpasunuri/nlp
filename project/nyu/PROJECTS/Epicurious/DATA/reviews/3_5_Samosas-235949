I've made this recipe 3 times. The first time I made the dough, but the last two times I just used wonton skins. I usally have extra filling leftover and it is great to saute it in the morning for breakfast. The potatoes get alittle crispy. yummy!

The dough was incredibly easy to work with. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the nigella seeds anywahere (Trader Joes, Whole Foods, local supermarket...) Also - does anyone feel that the dough needs to be thinner? The filling lacked some flavor - I would fry some onions, add garlic, ginger, jalapeno, garam masala. Then add this to the diced potatoes, add cilantro, skip the green onion. I made this for an appetizer for our Indian night (along with butter chicken and basmati rice). All together a very good meal. But the recipe needs a bit of work. For full recipes: http://wonderlandwithlove.blogspot.com

I tried to find a recipe for chicken samosas but potatoe samosas are great too. I wonder if it would taste ok if you added shredded chicken in this stuffing mixture if that would work will have to see.

Something was just missing. I ended up using a lot more salt and cumin. The dough was really hard... not reminiscent of the doughy, almost flaky crust I'm used to with these. Plus I had more mixture than dough.

This was very flavorful and savory, I used some leftover pie crust from the holidays and just prepared the filling. I also baked these in the oven instead of deep frying.

Good basic recipe. I will make these again but with more cumin and chile powder. I didn't have any trouble with the dough (do knead for the full ten minutes).

question: what type of peas to use? I love samosas with peas but have never made them. Do you use canned, drained peas or frozen peas, thawed? Or go through the trouble of shelling fresh? Just want to get great results. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious even without nigella seeds. Although the dough was a bit wet too and I wasn't too impressed with its taste. I will try by adding a bit of salt to the dough this time.

These were delicious. I added about a cup of peas and doubled the spices. I wasn't super impressed with the dough. I didn't have any nigella seeds, and I found the dough to be very wet. I ended up kneading in probably about an extra cup of flour.

First samosa recipe which mentions "Kalaungee"- which is the right way to go for the dough. However, never onions in samosas please. Use dried mango powder instead of lemon and some garam masala.

Honestly, why deep fry???? Baked them in the oven. They are even more delicious and a lot less greasy... Then it is a healthy snack! I love samosas stuffed with any type of curried left overs.

Wonderful little packages of taste. Mine were delicious though not so pretty. I had trouble with the shape but they were still good and all of my guests loved them - couldn't believe I had made them from scratch. Don't leave out the nigella seeds in the pastry. It gives it a nice little hit of colour. I served them with mint chutney and tamarind chutney. Yummy!!!!

Excellent recipe. They taste just like the ones I often had for breakfast when I lived in Abu Dhabi. A couple of things, however. I added a half a cup of green peas (I just can't imagine samosas without them), and after struggling with the dough a couple of times, I started using wonton wraps instead. Just use two wraps for each samosa and seal by wetting the edges and pressing them together. Much, much easier and they fry up nice and crisp. They freeze well and can be eaten cold or heated in the oven or microwave.

I did this recipe and it turned out as expected. My husband and children said they tested better that the ones you get outside. They were awesome, and so easy to make.

My first time making samosas, these were really great. I have a deep fryer, so did them in there to crispy, crunchy perfection. I can recommend that you don't try to assemble them ahead, refrigerate and then fry later. I tried this and ended up with a massive mess of raw dough stuck together with pockets of filling, despite trying to flour each to avoid this. After correcting my mistake, they were glorious.

I made these with ground sirloin and peas mixed with the potatoes making the whole pocket larger - Awesome! It made a great snack for our holiday road trip.

I didn't make it yet, but from the ingredients I can taste it with my mind. Awesome for vege lover, simply diet snack if you fry with olive oil. My mom cooked the filling with beef and chicken it was marvelous!!! I had a tip from the local chef, if you out some green apple you double the taste, I didn't try it yet.
