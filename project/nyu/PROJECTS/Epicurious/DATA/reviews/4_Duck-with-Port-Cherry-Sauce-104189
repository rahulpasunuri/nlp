Took the advice of several other reviewers and used dried cherries in lieu of frozen cherries, which worked great! The cherry did plump nicely. I paired this recipe with a dried sour cherry wild rice salad mixture I found on Chowhound, which worked wonderfully with this dish. I have been making Valentine's Day dinner for my wife for ten years, and she said hands down this was the best one yet.

This has become a Christmas Eve tradition. It' very simple to make, yet presents as an elegant dinner. I follow the recipe exactly. A real winner.

I made this recipe for dinner and my husband, who loves duck breast, just raved! The recipe is superb. I followed the directions as stated with one change. Instead of adding cornstarch at the end, I added a beurre manie at the end, to thicken up the sauce. The sauce compliments the duck breast perfectly. I served this dish with wild rice, which went well with the duck and sauce. This recipe is a keeper and will be made again and again, per my husbands request.

I always get rave reviews for this meal. I serve it with chipotle sweet potatoes, which are fabulous with the sauce. For me, the sauce takes much longer to reduce, and twice my cherries have charred just as the sauce reduced to the right volume. I now turn the heat down for the last part of the reduction.

i found myself in possession of skinless duck breasts. this recipe, as described, made a fantastic preparation of the meat. the sauce is exceptionally rich with flavor, and pairs best with sides like plain mashed potatoes or greens. in my case, i had 3 breast halves and cut the recipe in half. i also used dried thyme and found the result acceptable. for the cherries, i was not able to get these in the normal frozen section, but they were available in the organic-only section of the supermarket.

Excellent as written! My reduction took at least twice the time. Next time, I'll just make the sauce ahead. Used low-sodium soy sauce.

This was my first time cooking duck breast. I found the recipe very easy to follow & my guests just loved it...will definitely make again, and again, and well until I run out of friends to cook this for!

The sauce needed much more cherries so I had to add this in and also a lot more port, more like a cup and a half, in relation to 2 cups of stock. When I first started the sauce and cooked it for about 45 minutes, it wasn't sweet at all so I spilled out some broth and added more ruby port and cherries and reduced that and it came out fabulous. For me not fabulous as the recipe says. Duck was fine, very good, but the sauce recipe was way off.

KeMDee--, tawny and ruby ports have significant flavor differences, so it will definitely change the nature of the sauce. Ruby's offer flavors of dried cherries, blackberry, raspberries, etc.. Whereas Tawny's usually have more nutty qualities vs the fruit flavors of the ruby. Might be good, but it will be different. Wanted to give you my two cents..

Loved this. The results were fabuous, particularly considering how easy it is. The marinade added an incredible depth of flavor to the duck. I'll consider using it any time I'm cooking duck breasts. Made pretty much as-is, although because I'm a seasonal food fanatic and feel that frozen fruit is a violation of my principles, I substituted double the number of dried cherries for the frozen. Don't know if it's because I was using dried cherries, but the corn starch wasn't necessary to tighted up the sauce. Came out great.

I wish I had made more. the reduction made it such a deep flavor and the butter... ahh... I'll make this with other meats.

I only used the sauce from this recipe. I roasted a whole duck, following a different recipe. BUT the sauce was AMAZING. I loved how complex the taste was. Everyone enjoyed it. We had duck and also prime rib. It was great with the prime rib too (the beef broth made a big difference).

Does anyone know if you can substitute Tawny for Ruby Port? I have not made this before and plan to for Thanksgiving but don't want to go buy a Ruby port if I don't have to! I appreciate any information!

I had saved this to my "Recipe Box" some time ago. Today I found some great looking fresh cherries at the market. I stemmed and pitted the cherries and ended up with about four cups of fruit. Otherwise I followed the recipe... except it took much longer to cook the sauce down to an appropriate point. The results were fabulous. I will definitely make this dish again.

I have cooked this 10+ times since 2000. I use a low sodium Soy, marinate 1 1/2 hours, use Maple Leaf Peking/Long Island Duck Breast. I usually cook for 8-10 people so I have to double sauce. to get to reduce quicker, just use a 12' heavy killet or saute pan...everyone ALWAYS wants this again...simple and great taste..

I was really excited to try this dish, based on all the amazing reviews. I'd never cooked duck breast, but neither had several of the other reviewers so I crossed my fingers and did my best. Possible errors on my part: per other reviewers, skipped the marinade. Have a relatively old stove, so medium heat ended up being turned up later to get what "medium" should be, so heating wasn't quite what recipe called for. Used a bit more time (two sprigs) than called for as I love thyme. Overall the dish was good... but not amazing. In my rating scheme 2 forks means "average". I thought it was good, it's not that I wanted to throw it out... but there was no zing, no memorable impression of the dish where I just knew it was worth the effort to cook as a special dish for the family. Is it good for a regular meal? Yes absolutely. However the sauce just wasn't as amazing as I'd come to hope from the other reviews. Was looking for a dish to impress my (potentially future) inlaws, and this wasn't it.

Rating: 4
This was a good recipe, but I would cut down on the soy sauce next time. And in a few other reviews they suggest doubling the sauce......DON'T! The amount that is made is more then enough. Otherwise the sauce floods the plate, and the presentation is horrible. I served this with saffron risotto and steamed carrots. My wife loved it!!

Fantastic! I have made this numerous times to raves of husband and kids. My 4 year old daughter will ask if we can have duck with cherry sauce, with a loud smack of her lips and a yum yum! We prefer the the d'artagnan magret breasts over the maple leaf muscovy. We sear fat side down for 6 min and then bake for 8 minutes....perfect medium rare.

My family loved this, although I liked it less than the recipe on this site with a chipolte/orange sauce. As in that recipe, I broiled the breasts.

Absolutely delicious! The sauce for this dish is incredibly easy and scrumptious!! It could probably make the worst duck taste good. My husband wasn't the most thrilled that we were having duck this evening but soon changed his mind when I served the black duck he brought home with this recipe.

Excellent! I forgot to buy cherries so I used a few tablespoons of a cranberry-cherry relish I had on hand instead. Turned out great! I marinated the duck, but next time would do without as it doesn't add much too the duck.

I made this for Christmas dinner. The marinade is way, way, way off. I used about 1/3 of it, patted it off as another responder suggested. I would definitly doubled the sauce. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and gourmet greens salad. It was a hit! Iplan to make it again. I used Maple leaf Farms duck, quality!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Quite possibly the best duck I've ever had. Definitely will do this again (and again). Served it with baked mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and roasted asparagus, for a great Christmas dinner. I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee, marinating for about 2.5 hours. And it was doubled and that worked fine. I may have taken longer to reduce the port-cherry sauce, I didn't exactly time it, but it seemed like it.

Rating: 4
This was outstanding - a very elegant company dinner or Christmas meal. As an alternate cooking method, after searing fat-side, I placed breasts in a baking dish and baked at 200 degrees for an hour. This made it easy to spend time with my guests before dinner. I served with parsnip soup, sweet potato puree and haricots vert w/shallots. Excellent!

I agree - this is great. Couldn't find frozen cherries, so I used fresh. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to have a lot of taste so I added 2 tsp. of cherry preserves to up the flavor. Otherwise I followed the recipe and we thought it was great.

This is my first time cooking duck breast and it was nothing short of fabulous and easy! I used fresh cherries for the sauce and 2 tbls. of sour cherry jam - YUM! The duck was tender and skin crispy. We enjoyed a bottle of Justin wine (Orphan) with dinner along with creamy mashed red potatoes and glazed carrots. I WILL be making this again!!

Rating: 4
Very good dish. As previously suggested, I skipped the marinade step. For the sauce, I started with sauted chopped shallot. After the initial reduction of the liquid, I added another 1/2 cup of port wine and continued the reduction ... one for the sauce and one for the cook. Oh, I left out the corn starch thickening agent; it didn't look like it needed it.

My wife and I both took our first bite of this and at the same time said "best duck recipe I've ever made". For that matter, it was better than any I've had in a restaurant as well. My previous favorite (and my wife's too) was the Duck with Pears and Green Peppercorns, also on this site. But no more. This dish was fantastic. Didn't read the prep part of the recipe closely enough and only ended up marinating for 1 hour, but that was more than enough.

You know, this is one of those schizophrenic kind of recipes. When I think soy/sherry marinade, I don't think of cherry/port sauce. Some kind of cultural conflict. And, while I made the dish according to recipe, next time I would skip the marinade. Seems like the sauce has to overcome the marinade flavors. I just don't see how the marinade contributes. Saute the breasts, and go with the sauce, I say, but "a chacun son gout". I used dried cherries, FWIW, and brown homemade duck stock in place of the chix/beef stock combo. Don't get me wrong. Very, very good. A keeper. Pair with pinot noir. Happy New Year! dr bob

I am not a huge fan of duck, but my husband loves it and I always make it for Christmas. I have roasted whole ducks and once made duck breast. As a cook, this was by far my favorite recipe---very easy! And I thought it turned out well. More important, my husband raved about it!

Made the sauce to go with a whole roasted duck; the sauce was amazing; the duck I should have given anohter 30 minutes at the high temp to crisp up; didn't have sherry, used red wine; didn't marinate for hours; just about half an hour; but cooked the duck on a rack so the fat dripped down and could be used along with the marinade for basting.

Excellent recipe -- have made it twice now. The first time I used fresh cherries and the sauce was good but lacking a bit. This time I used dried cherries and it turned out great. To keep the skin of the duck from burning, I finished it in a hot oven after searing in a frying pan. It was a big hit with all the guests.

Yum! and then some! I am stingy with the 4th fork, but this one was truly beyond compare. I made a whole duck and cooked it on my farberware rotisserie (that goes with their table top grill). The duck was crispy and the fat drains off beautifully, I basted with the sauce at the very end of cooking and served with sauce on the side as well. It was very ambitious for my first Christmas dinner with my fiance, but well worth all the work!

This recipe is awesome for the fall and winter seasons. I did make some alterations out of convenience. I grilled a pork tenderloin instead of using duck, and I also used fresh cherries since they were on sale. Also, I prepared the dish with a favorite mashed sweet potato recipe to accent the sweet and rustic flavor of the cherries and pork. My dinner guests loved this recipe and I will most definitely make it again.

Made this several times and it is EXCELLENT! I marinate between 2-3 hours at most. Anything longer will be too salty. I always double the sauce and plan for a much longer reduction, 30-45 min...but it is worth the wait. Serve medium rare for best flavor. DO NOT OVERCOOK, unless you like liver taste. 8 minutes on skin side and 4 minutes on other side. I usually stack the sliced breast on a bed of sauteed spinach and Port and Balsamic Vinegar marinated portabellas, grilled.

this was very yummy. restaurant quality flavors. relatively easy to make and we served with wild rice and carrots which was a good pairing. the hardest part was finding a store that carried those kind of cherries. will definitely make again.

The sauce for this duck makes the dish. I don't know if I was crazy about the marinade. I did, however, drain the duck breast on a paper towel before adding to the pan. Thanks to those previous reviewers...no burning soy here. Another note...I did not use 1/2 stick of butter as it called for. I probably used about half and felt it was sufficient enough. A keeper all in all.

I had a whole duck, so I quartered it, marinated it, then roasted it. The sauce was great over the duck, I even doubled the quantity because I never have enough. It's been hard finding a good duck recipe that's not too sweet, this was great. Also a fast and easy recipe that seems top-notch.

I made this for an anniversary dinner and wowed my husband. The sauce is awesome.

Despite my worries that this would emerge from the marinade too salty, this turned out to be delicious (but we DID use low-sodium soy sauce). Next time I would not marinate it so long -- 3 hours is just about right. And since we couldn't find the frozen cherries we used Del Monte dark sweet cherries in a can, which were also delicious. Cooking time for us was 12 minutes on the skin side, 3 minutes on the other. Result was just barely pink and perfect. This was really simple and tasted harder to make than it was. Ideal for dinner parties! Serve it with maple-spiked, mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed sugar snaps. YUM!

I was a little hesitant to try this because I try to avoid too many fried foods. But this turned out really well. My friends loved it. I made it a second time and roasted the duck breasts instead of frying them and they were just as delicious and the skin just as crispy.
