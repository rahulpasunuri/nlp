These are amazing. Very sweet, salty, and spicy. I would reduce the amount of ketchup next time, due to it's sweetness, and add another tomato based product in it's place. (But still use at least half of the ketchup) Like others, I significantly reduced the water. I also used dried cannellini beans that I pre-cooked.

These are faboulous and oh so easy. Having obviously not read the recipe closely enough, I never saw the part about adding 4 cups of water, which is why mine were not overly soupy, and I baked them for only about 45 minutes. Perhaps next time I will add some water, but they were delicious and the right texture without, so who knows?

These were pretty good except for a few issues. After 2 hours in the oven, the beans were like soup. I had to reduce them on the stovetop for 15 minutes. Also, way too sweet and too spicy. next time I'll cut the molasses and sugar by 1/3 and reduce the hot sauce. the breadcrumbs make this dish. def worth trying again.

OMG, what the hell's not to love about bacon breadcrumbs?!? I admit I am a purist about my baked beans and prefer them cooked from scratch (dried), and on the face of it it's hard to respect a recipe that calls for 2 cups of ketchup, but I will say the kids loved this. However, in the future I will add the breadcrumb topping to the maple baked beans I usually makethey will be delicious.

I made the sauce and added an additional can of beans to the pot the day before I planned to bake it. The next morning I realized I had skipped the part about adding 4 cups of water to the sauce. That seemed excessive so I added about 2 cups of water to the mixture, and baked it a little longer to thicken the sauce. The bacon breadcrumb topping was a wonderful addition, adding both texture and flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Really liked the beans. Added more hot sauce and an extra clove of garlic. I also had to let them bake an extra 40 min to reduce the liquid. The only complaint too sweet. will make again with the added cooking time and I'll cut back on the brown sugar and molasses Very easy recipe and I can taste the potential.

I'm in the middle of making these, not sure what is going on. The flavor is there, but with 4 cups of water added, it's like baked bean soup! I even added an extra can of beans. What the what? I don't think a breadcrumb topping will do anything but sink into the soupiness. I might take these out of the oven and boil off some of the liquid.
