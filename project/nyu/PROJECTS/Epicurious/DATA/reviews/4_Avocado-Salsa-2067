What a great alternative to smooth guacamole. I've made this since it was first published & people request recipe each time!

very good, yet mild. I will make again but will make it hotter

I loved this salsa, and everyone I served it to did also. However, it is very mild. If you like spicy salsa, add more jalepeno seeds.

I liked it very much. I placed it on top of grilled spicy pork chops and it was a big hit at our barbecue. Everyone loved it.

This was really good but I might add another tomato. I used three medium sized tomatos and it still seemed heavy on the green stuff. I also only used a quarter of an onion but that was just personal. I used it on chicken fajitas and had plenty left over. Unfortunately my roommate found it when he came home at 3am and it was gone the next day.

With Chicken, black bean and goat cheese tostadas. The olive oil seems to work nicely here. Very nice.
