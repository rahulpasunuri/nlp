Really tasty, but the rice was mushy and somewhat scorched at the bottom already after 30 minutes of cooking (cast iron enamel dutch oven over low gas flame for anyone wondering). Next time I'll check at 20 minutes. I scaled back on the salt a bit, which was a good move and used Eden canned beans which don't have any additional salt. The other seasonings (cumin, bay leaf, oregano) were good in the listed quantities, but adding a tad more wouldn't hurt. Overall, a great recipe which I definitely see myself making frequently! In the future I really need to incorporate plantains in some form into the menu though..

Already have made it twice and served with the fish tacos recipe I found on this site as well. took a lot of advice from the other comments... Less salt, more spices, etc. Really, really good, all by itself, but especially with a good green salsa... :)

Would have been four stars but for the love of God, cut the salt in half. I may have to remake it since I don't think my heart can handle that much sodium.

Flavorful, easy, and inexpensive. Followed the recipe to the letter and was very pleased with the texture and flavor. The recipe makes a very generous amount, and it freezes well. Planning to use some of the leftovers for lunches and in enchiladas.

Nervously made this last night. I was determined to make it with brown rice but none of the reviews mentioned any liquid adjustments when doing so. Using brown basmati rice (long grain), I went ahead with leaving everything as is. Turned out well. Of course it just needed longer cooking time. Checked it after 40 mins, still needed another 10. Used a can of chicken broth instead of water, bumped up the seasoning qty and overall everyone really enjoyed it. Made it to go with crockpot Cuban pork, awesome pairing!

Three for three. Cheap, easy, and delicious! I halved the recipe and substituted 1 1/2 TBSP olive oil for the bacon. It ended up being done after simmering for about 20-25 minutes. Excellent recipe, I'll be keeping this one around.

This is tasty, but, as others have noted, had too much salt for my taste. I omitted the bacon to accommodate a vegetarian and added one tbsp of olive oil. I read that others who omitted the bacon increased the salt, but that is not necessary. I will definitely reduce the salt next time, probably half is plenty.

This recipe is easy and so yummy. I made it with an extra 4T of olive oil and no bacon. I will definitely make it again and again.

Great, easy recipe. I had some Vegetarians for dinner so I left out the bacon and added about 4 tablespoons of olive oil and a teaspoon of salt. It was delicious even without the bacon. However, the next time the bacon is staying in.

As someone who normally cooks black beans from scratch, I love this recipe. I use pancetta instead of bacon and I skip the green pepper.

My family LOVED this! I added an extra can of black beans at the end but this wasn't needed. We just really like black beans. My seven year old son's favorite meal is Chipotle's burrito bowl. He said he liked this better...because of the bacon.

Yeah, it's pretty freaking delicious and smells amazing while cooking. So easy and inexpensive! Made as written, any changes would be superfluous.

Tasty and cheap! The first time I made this I tried to substitute brown rice but it takes forever to cook. Like hours. Maybe it's just the altitude we live at (7300 ft). So be warned if you decide to use brown -- I ended up throwing it all in the slow cooker for a few hours and then it was done. But the beans were a bit overcooked that way. Now I just use white rice -- we eat brown the rest of the time and I figure the occasional white rice won't kill us. Don't skimp on the garlic, onion, or bell pepper. The amount of salt really depends on whether your beans are salted or not, and your salt preferences. You might add half the amount and then wait a few minutes and taste before adding more.

Prepared as a vegan dish for our Cinco de Mayo buffet by substituting olive oil for bacon. The final dish was still full of flavor, the rice was perfect, and the seasoning was excellent. This dish was easy to prepare and thoroughly enjoyed by our guests.

Very easy and a real family pleaser, even the kids loved it!

Used olive oil instead of bacon, added 1/2 tsp smoky paprika, increased cumin to 1 tsp and oregano to 3/4 tsp. Had to add an additional 1/2 cu liquid at the end, no big deal. It was pretty wet when all was cooked, I just left the lid on and 15 mins later it was the perfect consistency and still piping hot. Salty for sure, but since I'm not eating it with meat I don't mind :) that's what the mojitos are for!

Very Good! Only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water.

Satisfying, healthy, delicious meal everyone loved! I substituted brown rice for the white rice; yummy! I put in just a bit of low-sodium bacon for flavor. Instead of green pepper, I used 2 large finely chopped carrots. I cut back on the salt, using 1/4 tsp for the garlic and 1/2 tspn for the rice stir. I added freshly ground pepper along with the cumin and oregano.

It's great, but by GOD it's got way too much salt. I should have trusted my instincts before following the recipe. Yuck. Please amend!!

I haven't tried authentic Moros y Cristianos, but this recipe was great and very easy. Didn't have bacon or bell pepper, so substituted carrots (per someone else's suggestion). Also, ran out of regular rice and subbed half cup of risotto rice; still turned out well. I look forward to trying this again, this time with all the ingredients.

Fantastic and authentic flavors. I am Cuban-American a this is the first time a Moros y Cristianos cooked perfect. Bravo.

Would have preferred to see a recipe advertised as "healthy" with , at least, healthy options given: without bacon, with brown rice instead of stripped grain, whole spices instead of pre-ground, dried beans instead of PCB canned, no microwave. . . . etc.

I made some substitutions, but it still came out great. Omitted the bacon to make it vegetarian (but used the same amount of olive oil as in the recipe), subbed chopped carrots for green peppers (that's what I had on hand), and reduced the salt. Simple, flavorful, and healthy.

I make this every Sunday night...and I always have enough for leftovers. I like to put a small dollop of sour cream on top of my rice/beans because it adds a bit of creaminess ! Easy and delicious recipe...tried and true.

Yummy and easy. Reduced the salt by a tsp, as suggested by other reviewers, and added about 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro with the rice.

I used cubes of yesterday's cuban grilled pork instead of bacon; great and much less salty. I'm a bit surprised several commenters complained about too much chopping; one onion and one green pepper?

Loved this recipe and will def be making it again. The only teeniest tiniest issue I had with recipe, it was a little too salty for my taste. I think bacon added a good amount of salt. I even cut down the amount of salt suggested, and it was still a just a teeny bit too salty for me. Next time, I might wait to add the salt till the end, just to see how much I really want. But it was a huge hit!

Love, love, love this recipe. This is the best rice and beans I have had in a long time. I ate it straight from the pot, I ate it cold, didn't need any meat with it, it was so wonderful just on it's own. I will definitely be making it again.

Very good, surprisingly mild in flavor so might increase spices next time.

So very good. Left overs made for great bean burritos too! I didn't have a green pepper so I just filled in with more onion.

I recently moved to SoCal after living in Florida for along time. I have tried and tried to find a decent Cuban place here= FAIL! This recipe was a life saver. The flavors were delicious, just enough smokiness from the cumin and it definitely reminded me of the Cuban restaurants in South Florida. I made this with the Braised Pork with Mojo sauce and my husband absolutely loved it! I would only make one change- I would recommend using 4 strips of bacon instead of 6. It will still render enough oil to coat the rice without the bacon flavor being too prominent.

This recipe was delicious, but was also on the salty side. Next time I would decrease the salt by 1 tsp. This recipe also takes a lot of chopping which is fine if you're in a cooking mood and it's raining outside.

Wonderful! Went beautifully with the pork asado.

An outstanding sidedish that went great with Cuban Grilled Pork (Lechon Asado). Made exactly as written. The only thing I would caution is to check your black beans to see if they have added salt. If they do, you might want to dial back the salt in the recipe by 1/2 to 1 tsp.

This is the easiest, most authentic tasting black beans & rice recipe I've ever tried (and I've been on the hunt for a good one for a WHILE)! I used dried beans cooked on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours, as well as some of their liquid. I also doubled the spices (including the salt), and cut the cooking time, as the package directions on my rice said it cooked in 20 minutes. Even with my impromptu modifications, it turned out perfectly -- will definitely make again!

I cut out 2 tsp of the salt and it was just fine. This a great recipe for rice and beans, but very time consuming- unless you buy all the ingredients pre-chopped.

I made this for a small party to go with the carnitas recipe on this site. It was so tasty and easy to make which is great when your also trying to get the house in order. One change- I used a poblano pepper instead of a bell pepper and enjoyed the little kick. Our friends' children who are 1 1/2 and 4 wouldn't stop eating it. Delicious.

This was the tastiest black beans and rice I've had. Take out the bacon and serve with a salad and it's a good vegetarian meal.

I made exactly as written and it was a HUGE hit with my family and friends, including several picky children. Next time I'll probably use less bacon and replace the fat with olive oil - you'd still get the bacon flavor without all that bacon fat.

This is a simple, one-pot dish. It is easy, fast and delicious. Served with flour tortillas and salsa it's a complete meal.
