The patty wasn't as crunchy as I was hoping, the consistency was more spongy. I would reduce the number of eggs and increase the breadcrumbs to make a crispier patty. I'd also add some extra salt to the patties, sauce, and greens. Otherwise, this is a really beautiful and tasty dish. It requires a little more work than I usually prefer, but it would be perfect for entertaining.

This was a big hit! Nice presentation and a fun twist on eggplant parmigiana for my guests. Was tasty and relatively light. I didn't use all the olive oil it called for. Easily made six servings instead of four.

This is a crowd pleaser! It is a bit of extra work, however, it can be made in stages....tomato sauce far in advance, arugula and basil ahead of time. Eggplant can be roasted early and just heated up. The patties need to be made at the moment, but then, the whole prepared stack also reheats beautifully. Each time I make it we wonder why it has been so long since we had it! I have substituted spinach for the arugula, dried basil also for the fresh basil. It works, although the fresh items are best. This time I made it I had mezclun that was near the end of its freshness so I sauteed that and it was great! You can substitute jarred sauce, but if I must do that, I will slowly cook onions and garlic in olive oil and then add them to the sauce and blend with a stick blender for a creamier sauce. I normally grow my own tomatoes so I use my own tomato sauce that I keep frozen. The patties are truly what adds the special taste and texture. We love it!

This was great. Agree with not adding water to the tomato puree, as I had to simmer for longer to reduce the liquid. Both tasty and a great presentation.

I served this to friends who are meat lovers and scoff at vegeteraian meals-they didn't miss the meat one bit! Huge hit!

I made the tomato sauce a day ahead and thought this was a perfect recipe. I would eat vegetarian completely if all the dishes were this delicious.

It is definitely time consuming, but so impressive and elegant. This is my most requested dish. I love the egg patties - I use fresh breadcrumbs for a lighter consistency. Also, I would suggest omitting the water from the sauce and the egg patty mixture - I don't really understand why it was necessary to add it. The egg mixture makes many, MANY patties - I made this again last night and I made 12. Overall a fantastic recipe and one of my top 5 favorite recipes ever.

This was quite delicious. I agree with all the cooks who said that it was more time consuming than stated in the recipe - definitely a Friday night or weekend dish. Also agree that the water in the tomato sauce was not necessary (I had to boil it down a lot to get back a 'tomato' flavor) and that the egg patty was quite large (I halved the recipe but still had enough to make 4 patties). However it was very elegant and flavorful. Will definitely be making it again. I had the thought that you could make all the individual parts of it ahead of time and then put it together for a very elegant dish at a dinner party.

This was more time consuming than I expected. Would advise making the sauce ahead of time and definitely puree it. It seemed that the egg pancake mix was too much. The four pancakes were very large. I might try making less next time and agree that the water must be added gradually or the mix is too soupy. Did anyone else have this problem?

Made this for the non fish eating guests on Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit with everyone! I'm going to make it again for Easter. It froze well and I loved not having to stand over the stove frying all that eggplant. This one is a keeper!

I found this worth the time it took to make it. It was tasty and my family loved the presentation. It's a nice vegetarian twist on a traditional dish.

A little more time-consuming than I expected, but worth it. My husband and I rarely eat vegetarian main courses, but both loved this one. My only change was to substitute spinach for arugula (not an arugula fan).

Very yummy, and I don't even like eggplant. Used all basil and didn't pureed the tomatoes. My egg patty was more of an omelet than a cake, but my 4-yr-old ate it up, so there you are.

I followed the directions exactly, and was not impressed. We thought the breadcrumb cake was very eggy and tasted like an omelet. The result was nothing that reminded me of eggplant parmesan.

My guests loved it. I used spinach instead of arugula. Next time,I will make them smaller and use as an appetizer.

Much more time consuming than an hour - and all in all not a good use of eggplant. All of the other layers were delicious. Wish I had read the tips from the readers about adding the water slowly and having it on 425 (smoke detectors went on at my place)

Oh, yum. This was a delicious surprise for a midweek dinner. Not too time consuming if you have your own marinara already, either. Easily halved for two, and impressive enough for company. I would consider adding a layer of prosciutto after the cheese if you're non-veg, but other than that, would make just as is.

I thought it was great. I didn't puree the sauce so I only ended up with enough for one layer, but it was really good and saved me some time and clean up! Next time I would make the egg patties a little thinner, maybe use 1/4 cup/patty rather than 1/3. All in all it is very tasty and very pretty.

Presentation was great, however, i found it lacked the deliciousness of a real eggplant parmesan. Next time i would batter the eggplant slices and stack them as in this recipe; then i'd have the taste and the unique presentation. And it would be less work too.

Very scrumptious and well received by guests. Rather time consuming, but definitely worth it. In the patties, do not add all the water at once, rather slowly until the patty "dough" is wet enough to all stick together, but not so wet that you can pick it up and mold it into balls. I added it all at once, and ended up adding about double the bread crumb amount to compensate, because it became so soupy.

Absolutely Fantastic! Made twice. Used spinach instead of arugula. Second time decreased heat to 425 convection with parchment paper lined pan on lowest rack 9 min. on each side and just sprayed eggplant with EVOO spray (Trader Joe's)w/alittle S&P before I baked it. Came out much better. Loved the egg pattie. Some said it was time consuming but you could do everything in advance, refrigerate it, assemble it and bake it at 425 convection for 10-15 min. I've done it and it works great. This recipe is one I'll make over & over.

WOW Yummy is all I have to say. This was very easy I did not change a thing except more garlic. I used fresh mozzarella great flavor. A keeper will make again.

A little time consuming but worth the effort. We didn't do the breadcrumb cake at all and it was great. Substituted spinach for the argula, and used an italian 4 cheese blend instead of mozzie (more flavor). We loved it - quadrupled the sauce and had only a tiny bit left.
