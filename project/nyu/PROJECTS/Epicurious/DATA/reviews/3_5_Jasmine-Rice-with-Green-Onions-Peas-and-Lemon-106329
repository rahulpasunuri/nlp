My husband and I really loved this rice. The lemon sparked it up to a whole new level. May well be my all-time favorite jasmine rice recipe.

Great accompaniment to fish. Lemon is key. Simple and tasty.

I must have done something wrong. All the great reviews and mine was just okay. Maybe I needed more salt. So disappointing.

Made this for guests the other night. I was serving it underneath miso black cod, I felt the flavors really went well together, particularly the lemon. To me, the lemon takes plain jasmine rice to the next level. My edits: I swapped frozen peas with shelled frozen edamame (added a great velvety texture) and didn't put the parsley into the rice, rather used it as a sprinkling around the sides of the plate.

Oh ya, this ads another easy tasty side dish to the repetior. Only had frozen peas on hand, just let them thaw a bit and added at the last minute of stirring.Keeps them bright and fresh. Yummy and light.

I have made this recipe many times and have gotten rave reviews every time! I increase the amount of peas to up the veggie quota. I served it last night with roasted lemon thyme chicken from this site...fantastic!

I don't usuallyget excited about rice, but this is really good. It is definitely a keeper. My first time cooking Jasmine rice. Can't wait to try basmati (sp?).

This recipe is a keeper. It's the perfect bed for a grilled fish served with a nice white wine. It's so FRESH tasting. Good for Spring dishes, I think. Easy, too- I throw it all in my rice cooker. I do like to add the peas at the end so they retain that vibrant green color when ready to serve.

This was good, and very health-conscious. I doubled the recipe as we were having company-who raved about this and the steamed red snapper on this site. Made as directed-was great as is.

Rating: 4
I did as the recipe called for except that I substituted white and green asparagus in place of the peas and it was delicious and so light. The lemon flavor went so well with the Ginger and Shitake Mushroom Seared Ahi that accompanied it. I was VERY pleased with the flavor combination and made it for a first dinner date with my new beau and it was beyond impressive. We're getting married next week...wink!

I made it with basmati rice which I like better and also added some slivered almonds. I served it as a side-dish to Greek-style pork kebabs with tsatsiki and it was delicious.

This was one of the nicest rice dishes I have ever had. It was very light, and the lemon gave it a lovely distinctive flavor. I served it with seared tuna and it made a wonderful meal.

This is very good and easy. I cooked the rice a couple of hours ahead of my company. I had the rest of the ingredients ready to go so all I had to do was finish it up at dinner time.

So simple and so good! I do think that sesame oil is a better choice than EVOO, but other than that, this recipe is perfect!

It was lovely, would absolutly make it again- the combination of the Jasmin rice, lemon and green onions were perfect - the peas gave it the added color

Loved it. Would definately make it with grilled fish or Thai food.

Great rice recipe. Really simple, light and lemony-tasting. I served it with tilapia. I added very few peas as I only had canned peas and found that their taste did not really accentuate the dish. Next time I might add a bit more zest. I will make this often!

I added this to a Thai menu for my son's birthday dinner. His friends loved it. The lemon brings a lovely freshness that was a good counterpoint to the Thai whiskey pepper chicken I served. BTW, I opted for sesame oil in place of the EVOO.

I served this as a side with pan seared tuna -- deliciously light and easy too. Very flavorful.

Super easy and flavorful, great with fish. I didn't bother to cook the peas first.. just threw in them in with the rice and they cooked through fine at the end. I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.

This was a perfect compliment to my pork medallions with mustard sauce. I made the rice into timbales which made the overall look on the plate beautiful with a touch of color.

Light and refreshing side dish. Great in the summer with BBQ.

Not a bad dish. I liked it, but was not overly impressed by it. However, I will admit that I could have done a better job with the final step of it. I used this as a bed for some fish I was making, and it all went together wonderfully. This is a great side dish. [oh. also, i excluded the peas entirely, as I'm not a huge fan of them]

Delicious! Wouldn't change a thing in this recipe... the tartness is a wonderful switch from plain ol' rice. Served this with a Cooking Light recipe for "Drunken Beef", using lemongrass and they complimented each other nicely.

Rating: 4
This dish is excellent! I made it as part of a birthday dinner for my husband, along with the Skirt Steak with Cilantro Sauce recipe from this site. My local grocery store was out of jasmine rice, so I used basmati, with a liquid mixture of 1.75 cups chicken broth and .5 cup water. The end result was lemony and addictive. I'll definitely make this again.

My family loves this recipe! I have used fresh soy beans instead of the peas which are delicious. I also toast walnuts with a couple of dashes of soy sauce and add these to the top of the rice. Yummy!

Rating: 3
This was very good. I did't have any peas so cut up some frozen green beans, about the size of peas. It was a bit too "lemony" for me so maybe next time I'll skip the zest. Or maybe use half the zest and half the lemon juice.

Wonderful, fresh flavors. Can be a meal in itself.

Nice melding of flavours. Served this with the spicy hoisin chicken and warm asian slaw from this site. Great combo of flavours.

Excellent!!! The rice smells sooo good!!! It tasted like fried rice from a restaurant! It was nice and crunchy and fresh and easy to make. I will deffinately make it again, because I have more jasmine rice left over. Getting jasmine rice instead of long-grain rice is deffinately worth it. :)

Pretty but a little sour, I'll stick to plain rice.

This is a pretty easy rice dish to make. I have yet to screw up the rice as I usually do. I have made this a few times already and find it best exactly the way the recipe reads. I cooked it for a large crowd and it did not go over well though. I will stick to small gatherings where I know their likes and dislikes!

Rating: 4
A superb dish! I served it with sliced turkey and ham drizzled with honey garlic sauce. Following another reviewer's suggestion, I added 6 sliced button mushrooms, cooked in the olive oil 30 seconds before adding the first green onions. I used dried parsley (1 tablespoon), as that's all I had, but added 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, as well. My husband, who usually doesn't like cilantro, LOVED this dish, as did my guests. I will definitely make it again!

Rating: 3
I took the advice of the reviewer who served it with the Spicy Hoisin Chicken but I added sauteed mushrooms to the rice and subbed frozen snap peas for the green peas because I didn't have any. My family loved it served with the sauce from the chicken. Great combo! Thanks for the tip!

Great change from plain rice. Really enjoyed this and will definitely make again. Did not add as much lemon peel as it called for but next time, I might.

We had this a dinner party and everyone thought it was very good. Some added soy sauce for an extra kick. I think it would also be good as a main dish by stir frying some chicken first.

easy side dish and nice change of pace from plain rice. Now that I've made it, I like another cook's suggestion to add asparagus and mushrooms, which I think would dress it up a bit. This was not the "star" of my buffet, but a nice addition particularly b/c of ease of preparation

Have mad ethis dish many times, quick and delicious. MUST use the Jasmine rice for bet flavor. I also add a bit more lemon for more flavor. This goes well with the chicken marsala with sage recipe on epicurious.

I served this at a dinner party and it was a big hit. I left out the parsley - my guests weren't parsley fans and we didn't miss it. The lemon and scallions really complements the rice. The peas make it colorful and pretty. My rice got a bit gummy though - maybe I overcooked it? Any suggestions?

This is a great dish---easy to make and adds flavour to a meal when you want to go beyond just plain rice. I served this with a cilantro-pesto chicken. They went great together!

Rating: 4
Yummy! This was great. I did add a bit more lemon juice and it was too much (and I love lemon). I had to add water to cut down on the super lemony flavor, so I don't recommend adding any extra. Add the peas in during the last 2 minutes of cooking or they may lose the great green color and get too soft. I also added a little chopped red pepper on the top as garnish with the green onions. This one is a keeper.

Great recipe. The only change I'd make is to add more lemon zest and lemon juice. I served with flank steak this evening and had plenty of leftover rice. I'm planning on using the rice with garlic and lemon baked shrimp (recipe on this site) tomorrow evening.

Simple to prepare and delicious! Nice presentation, too. I concur with another reviewer's advice to hold off on adding the peas so that they don't overcook and lose their color. The Jasmine rice makes it!!!

This rice is the perfect side dish to dress up a run-of-the-mill entree. It's my go-to dish for summer dinner guests and never fails to get rave reviews. Definitely make the effort to get jasmine rice - the flavor is totally unique and it smells UNBELIEVABLE when it's cooking.

Easy and Delicious. Jasmine rice is so aromatic and the peas and lemon complement it well. I made a 1 cup more of rice for a group of 8 and there wasn't a bite left. I also didn't add all of the onions.

This was great with Ahi in the ginger shitake cream sauce. Don't cook the peas as long as the recipe says or they will lose some of the color. Add them last.

Absolutely delicious! Perfect accompaniment to any Asian-style fish preparation. After having made this several times, I double the peas and add them in at the last minute- they don't turn dull green and get mushy that way. We will enjoy this recipe for a long time!

We loved this rice, even me-rice is not may favorite thing. The jasmine rice is a very flavorful rice by itself but with the addition of peas, onions and a little lemon it's just that much better. I didn't have green onions so I used sweet onions and a little more peas than called for.

This was a really good savory rice blend- flavorful and good- I was a little worried because my rice was so clumpy in the saucepan but it seperated really good in the skillet and had great texture. I had it a long with a Thai grilled beef skillet supper and was great.
