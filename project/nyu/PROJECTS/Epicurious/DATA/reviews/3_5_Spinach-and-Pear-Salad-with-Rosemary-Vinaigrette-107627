I really liked this dressing. It was very flavorful for such a low calorie dressing. It also melded well with all the other ingredients.

Wonderful salad, it was a big hit with my husband. Served it with "Rosemary Endives" from this site, and roasted chicken. What a great, simple, wholesome weeknight meal!

This disappointed me. It was so salty with the miso and veggie broth! I did use red miso, maybe that's why? If I made it again I'd omit the miso and sub olive oil. Also the rosemary taste was too strong.

This was terrific! I added a little olive oil to round it out at the end because it was a little acidic.

I've had a blue cheese and pear salad before, but what makes this recipe special is the rosemary dressing- wow! I didn't know rosemary was so versatile on salads. Now I'm using this dressing on my everyday salads. Very good, I'll definitely make it again.

I love this salad; it is such a hit with company. I omit the miso because it takes an extra trip to get it, and I substitute good feta cheese for the blue cheese. It is delicious!

I'm not a big salad fan, but wanted some raw greens with Thanksgiving dinner, so made this. Definitely the best salad I've ever had at home. I'm sure making the dressing with olive oil instead of miso would work, but definitely not be the same - the miso in it is wonderful. I also don't like pears but with the blue cheese they were wonderful. I'll make this one again & again.

This salad is delicious - the rosemary gives it great flavour. I made it without the blue cheese and used olive oil instead of miso and it turned out fabulous.

I didn't have white miso so I used red miso instead. This salad is delightfully delicious! The miso flavor adds a very interesting "oomph" to the dressing. Received lots of compliments! Will definitely make again.

I have already made this salad at least 6 times since it was printed and will continue to make it. It continues to recieve many compliments and id so easy to prepare. I love that it is a healthy dressing that actually tasted great! I do not have miso so I have been subsititing 1 Tbls of oil. Maybe I'll look again for the miso....

I would definitely make this salad again! We use alot of miso in our 1/2 Japanese household so it was right in our refrigerator.You can find it in most grocery stores now. It's so nutritious that it's worth looking up other ways to use it. There are other miso dressing recipes that are delicious, too. I happened to find little red heirloom pears for the salad that were delicious. I would put less bleu cheese in next time. It overpowered the salad a little.

Excellent. Easy, lovely presentation and a big taste hit at our dinner party. Will definately make it again - in part because I have a lot of miso to use up!

Great salad! I've never used miso before, and was delighted with the results. The vinegar taste was a little bit strong, which I happened to like. This was a very easy recipe to make.
