I found this to be just as good as a cold spread as it was as a warm sauce. I've been in love with rarebit since stopping for tea at Fortnum & Mason when I was ten; this is nontraditional, but maintains enough of the original spirit that I can get my fix without a plane ticket to London.

I had never had Welsh Rarebit/Rabbit before, and neither had any of my 9 guests. I made the cardinal sin of not testing a recipe before serving it to guests, but everyone loved it! Only my boyfriend refused to taste it, due to an English muffin phobia. Maybe next time I will serve it on toasted bread so he can enjoy it as well.

Ah! The world's greatest comfort food. As fast as Kraft Macaroni and Cheese but far more wonderful. It's easy, quick, delicious and reasonably good for you. It's also pretty adaptable and can usually be made with what's in the cupboard. But in this house, it's certainly not enough for 6!

I've been using this recipe for 10 years. Everyone in my large family loves it, even my pickiest eaters. And it is quick to produce!

I've been making this dish since it first appeared in Gourmet. It's heavenly! The first time I made it for three of us (recipe says it serves 6) and there was none left. I'm sure you could play around with the recipe a bit, but it's terrific like it is, and, I think, nicer than plain rarebit recipes. Great for a light supper; great for kids and adults alike.

(Welsh Rarebit was originally called Welsh Rabbit) A few extra ingredients here compared to the traditional but a nice twist!

tastes curiously like welsh rarebit.
