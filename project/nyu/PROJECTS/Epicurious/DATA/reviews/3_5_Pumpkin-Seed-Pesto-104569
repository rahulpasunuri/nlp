My only complaint is that I didn't make enough! The sauted pumpkin seeds are even better than roasted and I love anything with cilantro. am definitely making this again.

This was delicious. It was very like a pepita hummus I've had before. Great vegetarian recipe.

I think pesto might be a bit of a misnomer (tapenade?) but it is very good. I had it on crackers with sheep cheese. Delicious.

Intersting addition to a squash soup.

This pesto had great and (for me) unusual flavor. Be sure to season it well to bring out the flavor in the dish; otherwise it could be underwhelming. I made it to go on the crouton with the butternut squash soup and the whole dish was really superb.

This was SO delicious! I used lime juice instead of lemon. Served it with vegetarian chili (three beans, chilis, roasted butternut squash) and corn bread. I will definitely make this again. I don't usually add an onion to pesto, so the scallion was a great addition. I subscribe to a community supported agriculture farm and needed a good recipe for cilantro. This is it!

My first thought when I blended this together was that it looked and smelled a lot like guacamole. I used limes instead of lemons, so maybe that contributed. Because of that, I see myself using this as an accompaniment to Mexican food rather than over pasta, Italian-style. Today I ate some over a (meatless) "chicken" breast with black beans and smoky chipotle salsa. I think I'll be trying it out in quesadillas next. Also, I think mixing it into some whipped cream cheese would make an excellent spread for crackers or tortilla strips. I would love to find more ways to use this!

Used this atop a light cream of pumpkin soup. Unfortunately it doesn't float but it is scrumptious and gave a rather boring holiday soup great texture and flavor. Most guests added more. I need to think of more ways to use this pesto. I liked it a lot.

This is a beautiful pesto, and very fibrous. I don't think I cooked the pumpkin seeds long enough, or they weren't dry enough to start with (I used seeds from a fresh pumpkin), but it still worked. I also used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup fresh pumpkin puree instead of 1/2 cup water. Delicious! The lemon really adds to the concoction and it goes great over pasta or as a spread.

This was a big hit. I made the pesto exactly as written and got rave reviews. I served it as a dip for lightly battered squash blossoms and it worked really well. All the flavors in the pesto were distinct and blended great together. My pumpkin seeds took a little longer than four minutes to brown, but tasted delicious. I will be making again with the soup for sure!

I served the pesto warm with the beans as a side dish. It was very tasty and different. I only made it because I had the pumpkin seeds already. I would not go out to get the seeds just to make this recipe; but we did like it. The pesto did not taste as good when cold. Also, it was very thick.
