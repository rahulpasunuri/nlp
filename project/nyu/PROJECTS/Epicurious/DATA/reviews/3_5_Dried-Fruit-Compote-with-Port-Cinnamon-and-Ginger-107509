Very simple and delicious. It does not need a 1/2 cup pf sugar, though. I used a little over a 1/4 cup and it was still sweet.

I made three different dried fruit compotes from this site to serve with home made pound cake, for a party. This was the only recipe of the three that I used. It is outstanding - and easy! It was the first dessert finished and I wish I had doubled or tripled the recipe. I made it exactly as written, with the Port (no orange juice). I am surprised that no one has tried it or reviewed it.

I am the original sender and just wanted to add that at one point, my sister found herself without the requisite Port and made the compote just with orange juice and really liked it that way too.
