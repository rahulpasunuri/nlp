I used the sauce ingredients as a marinade for pork tenderloin, letting it marinate for 3-4 hours. Delicious! The pork was super juicy and tender. I boiled the marinade and used it to spoon over the sliced pork. Will definitely make this again.

Cut down on soy sauce - halve the amt. quality of soy sauce matters. The cheaper it is, the saltier usually. Otherwise, it's so easy and so delicious! I sub with lemon juice, double the sugar. Reckon a little cooking wine (Hua Tiao Chew) , star anise and cinnamon won't hurt. next time.

I wasn't worried about some of the "too salty" reviews in making this, my boyfriend and I both like salty foods. But wow, no kidding. It was much too much. (For me anyway, it was actually ok for him.) I prefer the depth of flavor that you get in the Soy- Braised Pork Country Ribs with Carrots and Turnips recipe, and will stick with that one instead.

The sauce was lovely, but the ribs were dry, tasteless, etc. Perhaps this was the fault of the ribs themselves...I'm not sure that the ribs never boiled in the sauce...this could have toughened them. Not a keeper, in any case.

The meat was very tender. I omitted the salt and this was so salty my husband and I hardly ate it. Stuck with lots of leftovers. Not sure what went wrong. Even used low sodium soy sauce. Would not make again. This was my first Epicurious recipe that I did not enjoy.

These ribs were easy to make and amazing, very tender and flavorful. I took the advise of others and added a little Sriracha sauce and red pepper flakes to spice up the sauce and used a little less soy sauce and went light on the salt. Perfect!

Easy and quite good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more heat (in the form of srichacha). I didn't find it too salty, but I did add some water to the final liquid to make some more sauce. Maybe I cooked it too long, but I didn't think there was enough sauce to cover the amount of meat I had. Very tender and tasty. I served it with brown basmati and sauteed asparagus with sesame. Nice meal.

So easy and delicious. My only addition was 1 star anise pod to the braise which added a nice dimension to the sauce. My only complaint was that the sauce, while beautifully sticky, was much too salty. Next time, I'll not salt the meat and reduce the soy sauce adding a splash of water to the liquid. Like the idea of honey rather than sugar as one reviewer suggested.

Made this as directed - okay, maybe with a smidge extra garlic! - and it was delicious! Nice, sticky sauce on meat falling off of the bone. Exactly what I am looking for in a nice slow braise. This was universally adored by friends and family alike! I'm making this again tomorrow for a friend's birthday. Another nice bonus is how affordable this cut of pork is! I just picked up 4lbs. of country pork ribs for about $6 from my local high-end market, which is enough to feed 6 people easily. Delicious, super-easy, AND affordable = right into my recipe box. YUM!

Other than omitting the salt, I followed exactly and it was perfect. Didn't have problem with too much liquid -- my sauce clung to the meat as shown in the picture. After 2 hours, there was A LOT of fat in the pan so I scooped out, then broiled in oven for 5 minutes to get a nice sear on the surface of the meat. Delicious!

Good basic ingredients but definitely lots of room for improvement. Next time I make this, I will add honey instead of sugar and add red pepper flakes and add a little bit of sesame oil to the glaze.

Absolutely yummy. I used Orange Mango high quality juice, but only because I didn't have OJ laying around. Found the directions a bit confusing, but eventually figured it out. I didn't use a roasting pan, but should have. I used casserole dishes. I couldn't get the glaze to thicken, but it didn't matter... they fell off the bone and were very tender and yummy. I used the country style pork ribs on the bone, but am sure it would work with any kind of ribs.

This recipe is perfect as is. We never fail to have the most amazingly tender ribs. However, I do prefer the chinese- style or regular spare ribs as opposed to the country-style. It's more tender and it falls off the bone. Finger- lickin' good. It's so simple too!

I really liked the braising liquid for the ribs since the ingredients are orange juice and soy sauce. The recipe doesn't tell you if you need bone-in or boneless pork ribs. I used bone-in pork ribs and the meat stayed tender.

Rating: 2
Tasty and tender but unremarkable. There's something not quite right about this combination of flavors; too much soy perhaps? If you make a glaze from the pan drippings, you would do well to skim the fat off the top first. I followed the recipe instructions and found it greasy.

Cooked as written except I used back ribs and ran them under the broiler to brown after applying the glaze. No problems having the glaze thicken, I boiled it down in the roasting pan over two burners like making pan gravy. Yummy. Would make a good appetizer too.

I loved this recipe! It was easy and could be fast, (if it wasn't me preparing it)! And it's a great way to serve country ribs, a delicious alternative from the regular old barbequed treatment. I took previous cooks advice and excluded salt, used low-sodium soy, and added red pepper flakes. I also used the regular orange juice in my fridge (the only thing I had to buy was the ribs!) Yum yum!

I found this a recipe I would make again, but with subtle changes. Definitely agree about salt. I did not add much and the soy sauce made it sufficiently salty. Also, I had about 2.5 pounds of boneless country style beef ribs (from Walmart--yes, Walmart--limited options here in southcentral KY!). So I halved the recipe. I did not have fresh ginger so used a heaping teaspoon of powdered ginger. Also, added honey in lieu of sugar and a heaping tablespoon full of this marmalade I had with large shreds of orange rind. Finally, I made it in my 4 quart covered Le Creuset and braised the ribs on both sides for about 3 minutes a side on very high heat in a bit of oil. Then I prepared the glaze in a separate pot and poured it over the ribs, put the foil on, then the lid, and cooked as instructed. I was glad and surprised when I took it out and the glaze had reduced on its own to a lovely, thick, syrup. I served the ribs with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Definitely a HIT!! The only thing I would do differently next time is to add a bit more sweetener, perhaps more honey, to have the fresh ginger on hand, and to not use any salt at all.

This recipe is nothing special. It does help to remove the foil for the last 20 minutes or so to allow the ribs to brown a bit. I am not adding this to my repertoire.

This recipe has not been reviewed for awhile and I feel it is time again. My sister gave me this recipe and it is superb! She doesn't eat poek so we use beef short ribs. No added salt and low sodium aoy sauce is a must. Very easy and tasty. I make this often.

This recipe is such a yummy change from barbeque sauce on ribs. A little bit sweet and the right amount of zing from the ginger. It's easy, too; the hardest part was reducing the sauce. We got impatient and probably could have let it reduce longer so it was more syrupy, but we were still scraping the bottom of the pan for more. After reading reviews, I also skipped the salt, and used only 1/3 cup of soy sauce. I also left out the sugar. At reducing stage, I added a tablespoon of maple syrup. I highly recommend trying this.

Rating: 3
This recipe was great, very easy. I did not salt the pork but did flour and blanch it in olive oil then put in the soy sauce mixture. Cooked for about 2 1/2 hours. I needed a ladle to get it out of my dutch oven it was so tender. Adding the flour seemed to cure the concerns of other cooks as the sauce was a perfect glaze when I pulled out the pork and did not need to heat up the sauce. I did add red pepper flakes, great addition.

Rating: 3
This was very good and reasonably easy. I followed the directions other than utilizing a little less soy, dont think it mattered though. I would like a bit more kick to it and would add some heat such as ¼ Teaspoon Cayenne pepper.

I followed the good advice of several reviews and left out the salt and used low sodium soy sauce. Instead of fresh orange juice, I used thawed frozen orange juice concentrate. I thought it would add more of an orange taste. After braising the pork for two hours, I poured the liquid into a pot to reduce after removing as much fat on top as I could. I periodically tasted the liquid while it was reducing, I found I wanted a sweeter taste. So, I added an additional tablespoon of sugar and three heaping tablespoons of orange marmalade. The resulting sauce was great! Next time I plan to add chili flakes to spice up the flavor!

I made this last night with country style pork ribs. After reading all the reviews I did not salt the ribs. I always use low- sodium soy sauce but I did not use as much as the recipe called for. I only had a little over 1 pound of ribs so I only used 1/4 amount of ingredients except for the orange juice--I used 1 cup (not fresh, didn't have any oranges). I sprinkled the ribs with black pepper and Chinese 5 spice powder and browned in olive oil. I then sauted some chopped onions along with the garlic and ginger and then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. I had a bottle of Ken's Sesame Ginger marinade so I added a tablespoon of that and a splash of rice vinegar. After braising for 2 hours I removed the ribs and reduced the sauce, adding a splash of sake which added a great flavor. I then brushed the ribs with the glace and put under the broiler for a few minutes. They were great! I served with steamed white rice, broccoli and carrots. Will make again for sure. I'm also going to try the sauce with different types of pork...definitely a keeper!

My family enjoyed this recipe very much. I used boneless ribs and would consider this a four person, max, meal. Also, I reduced the sauce, as described, but added a table spoon of corn starch to thicken it up a bit...perfect!!! Thank you.

This is a very good do ahead meal.An excellent blend of basic flavors.I made the recipe the first time as listed and it was too salty. After that I did not add any salt. I also used good quality soy and I increased the OJ by about one half cup. Also, I have a Le Crueset bistro pan which helps keep moisture in while cooking. Finally, cook these ahead. Once cooked, let the sauce chill. The grease will separate so that you can skim most of the fat off the top. As for making the glaze, reduce- reduce-reduce.Serve with cole slaw and cheesey grits.

Rating: 3
Yep, salty. It's the boiling down of the sauce that does it. I skipped the initial salt and used low-sodium tamari for the sauce and it was still on the verge of too salty. Delicious anyway. I might try with 1/3 cup of tamari next time.

Rating: 4
I agree with those reviewers who suggest using low sodium soy sauce and not salting the ribs. I added 1/4 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder and it gave a nice flavor. Also added more OJ as I reduced the sauce which became a nice glaze, I strained the sauce and served it with some rice and steamed vegetables. My guests enjoyed it.

The first time I prepared this recipe I found it far too salty. The next time I used lowsalt soy sauce and did not salt the ribs before braising. Before I boiled down the sauce to make a glaze, I carefully removed as much fat as possible to avoid boiling off liquid to the point of too much salt. It was delicious.

I must have done something wrong, but I re-read the directions and can't figure out what it was....my sauce was way too salty...the 'sauce' never quite got thick, even tho I boiled it down to about 1/2 cup.

This recipe was excellent and very simple. I did use 2 1/2 cups of fresh tangerine juice, half the salt and a honey-ginger terriaki sauce. I strained the ginger and garlic out of the sauce prior to reducing. The ribs are ver tender and savory and takes very little effort.

As suggested by a prior reviewer, I increased the OJ by a cup, and it was simply perfect for the thicker, (cheap) ribs I was using. The sauce reduced perfectly, and was literally chased to the last drop out of the pan. Meat was super tender, and served with some homemade coleslaw, was a big family hit.

These ribs were outstanding. I will definately make them again. I sliced one large onion and sauted it, added it to the sauce. I also sauted the ribs for a bit of extra flavor. The sauce was amazing when drizzled over the ribs and rice.

I have reviewed this recipe below. Just wanted to update and let you know I cooked a pork shoulder whole in the cooking liquid for about 4-4 1/2 hours (a 10 lb shoulder) I mutliplied the ingredients for the cooking liquid by 1.5 because I didn't want it too salty. WHen it was done I shredded it and spooned some of the cooking liquid over it. Everyone loved it. It was delicious.

I substituted Kecap Manis (Sweet Indonesian soy sauce)for the soy and sugar. It's already thick and syrupy and doesn't over-salt the dish. Used grapefruit juice as well. Braised the meat for exactly 2hrs and it was so tender the ribs fell apart while I was serving them. To make the glaze I just added a spoonful of sugar and reduced for 10mins, perfect. Served on a bed of slaw with the glaze for dressing and it was a truly delicious and easy to make meal. I will definately use this technique again and next time try different citrus fruits.

This recipe is very delicious. I used a Le Cruset baking pan to bake the ribs and the pork ribs were very tender.

delish. made this last night ahead of time for dinner tonight. i think allowing the ribs to rest in the sauce overnight helped and thickened the sauce as well. i did not add the salt as people had reviewed it was salty. still found that it was still a little salty, next time might cut back the soy to maybe 1/3 and up the juice. I didn't find there was enough juice for the ribs to braise so added an extra cup. did reduce the sauce ALOT and never found it got that glaze-y but no matter the braising had made the meat so tender, you didn't consider the glaze while inhaling the ribs. did not play with the time or oven degree, didn't need it. made with the "fried rice with cilantro and peas" recipe (make sure to toss with some hoison and extra soy) on this site, which has become a staple weeknight recipe if you're looking for one.

I tried this last night and loved it, it was very easy and the flavor was all the way though the ribs they were so tender I had a hard time getting them out of my pan in one piece. They kept falling apart. I had a hard time with reducing the sauce, I boiled it for a half hour and it wasn't getting thick at all. I just used it as juice for the ribs but it wasn't even close to glaze.

I made the recipe as is last night. I feel it has too much salt. today, I experimented. I used low sodium soy, omitted the salt, and before I reduced the liquid, I strained out the garlic as it had tended to put a slight bitter taste to the finished product. I served it with rice with pineapple juice and pineapple rings on the side. was perfect! I also make something close to this except I use pineapple juice in place of the orange juice and teriyaki sauce in place of the soy.

For those who are familiar with Filippino foods, this tastes like Pork Adobo, but not as tart for Pork Adobo uses white distlled vinegar instead of fresh orange juice. Baked pork ribs for about 2-1/2 hours because some of my ribs were quite thick. At this point, I didn't think the dish looked as appetizing as in the magazine photo. Cooled and rifrigerate for the next night's dinner. Next night, discard the cold fat and proceeded with the recipe to reheat ribs and reduce the sauce to a glaze. After brushing the glaze on the ribs, the ribs magically looked exactly the the magazine photo. The glaze does get thicker and adheres to the ribs nicely plus there is extra glaze to spoon over the ribs. The day before, I was thinking that I would not try this dish again, but the end result was a success so now I think I will make this dish once again.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times, and will make it again tonight. It's quickly become a favorite in my household. I eliminate the added salt or use low-sodium soy sauce. I've also added toasted sesame seeds and scallions for texture. Reducing the temp to 275 and lengthening the amount of time also yields more tender result -- these ribs can stand up to a longer braise to break down the fat and tissue.

I made this recipe last week and it was delicious. Very easy and inexpensive to make. The ribs did take a little longer to be as tender as I wanted them. I am making them again today to have for tomorrow. Wanted to try making them once ahead of time to see how that works.

Rating: 2
I took another reviewer's advice and ran the ribs under the broiler before serving. I think that improved the texture -- the fat turned nice and bubbly brown. It had looked unappetizing and white even after 2 hours' braising. I cooked these one night ahead & they tasted fine; served them with short grain Japanese rice & a salad. It's a good quick at-home meal, don't think I'd serve them to guests unless I figured out a foolproof cooking method.

Rating: 3
I didn't even add salt to the ribs, and it was still too salty. Otherwise, the flavor was very good. Next time, I will use a low-sodium soy sauce. I wrapped the pan in foil and then after braising the ribs, I poured the sauce into a sauce pan and simmered it down until it turned into syrup. I then broiled the ribs for a couple of minute to get a crispy coating. Wrapping the pan in foil sure made it super easy to clean up.

I either cooked it too long or the meat was the culprit. Half the pork was melt in your mouth tender while the rest was dry as a stick. The glaze didn't resemble the picture at all.

This is one of those timeless recipes with lots of integrity on its own but plenty of possibilities for variations. Letting a tiny bit of steam escape meant that by the end of the cooking time the liquid in the pan was already the consistency of a glaze--a rich, dark, caramel sauce that one could scrape from the corners of the pan. For interest, I plan to add some Chinese five spice powder or broken up star anise or cinnamon sticks. Or maybe some lime juice in with the orange juice. Given that the oven was hot for 2 hours, I roasted some potatoes and other root vegetables. And I made an Asian slaw with more ginger, garlic, and some peanutes puréed in the blender with lime juice. Was a great side for the hearty but somewhat mild pork.

Flavors were very good and the meat was wonderfully tender, but I was not able to make the glaze truly syrupy and that detracted from the dish. I boiled liquids for almost an hour and it reduced, but never became glaze-like.
