Marinade and resulting grilled shrimp...exxxx-quisite! The relish read better than the result. Definitely too much celery salt. And for the weight watchers among us...the yield indicates two (2) shrimp per serving? bummer...

Delicious. Easy dinner for guests. One of those meals that's better than what I frequently find in restaurants. I used a grill basket for the shrimp and added red bell peppers, zucchini and sliced mushrooms. Added mango and purple onion to the relish. (cherry tomatoes might be nice too for color). Then served it on quinoa.

One of my favorite recipes of all times. The celery salt really makes the relish. I have served this at several parties and everyone is stumped trying to guess the secret ingredient.

I only made the fritters, but they were excellent. I think this recipe is much easier than the others I have tried. I attempted broiling to lower the fat, but that was not such a tasty idea.

I should also add that we did not use skewers. We have one of those grill pans for the BBQ and that is what we cooked the shrimp on.

This recipe was amazing. I served it over white rice and it was delicious. I also cooked extra pineapple and corn with the shallot as we like cooked pineapple and thought the corn a little brown would work well. So we had some of it fresh and some of it cooked mixed together. This recipe is easy to make, healthy, refreshing and a keeper!

Loved the corn- pineapple relish. Even skeptical husband loved it. It was a great healthy side dish with beef and pineapple kabobs and grilled corn on the cob. Very tasty. Don't be shy with the chili powder.

I have made this recipe many times and in the process it has developed into a favorite. I do not make skewers, instead the shrimp is grilled or sauted (depending on time and season) and served on a platter surrounded by the relish. I prefer to cook the shrimp with the skins on for flavor but if the crowd is lazy I do all the work 1st. I add red bell pepper and mango for color.

The relish is great. I cut back on the lime juice and the celery salt and added a tablespoon of fresh chives and an entire red jalapeno shaped pepper (name?) - will serve it tomorrow night with fish or chicken and rice on the side.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was very good for how healthy it is! This would make a nice summer lunch for guests or a light dinner. The one thing that I would change is that I would serve the shrimp on the side instead of over the salsa. The shrimp cooled down too quickly.

I only used the marinade which was very tasty and simple. I added some lemon juice to the marinade and only let in marinate for 45 minutes so that the shrimp didn't get cooked in the marinade. I used it on top of the mexican chopped salad which made for an out of this world, light and healthy dinner.

We made the recipe exactly as written and it was very good. We marinated the shrimp for just one hour, next time we would probably let it marinate longer and would probably add a little more chili powder or perhaps some finely diced jalapeno

Though I didn't have all the ingrediants and had to make a few adjustments to compensate, this turned out wonderfully. I didn't have a lemon, so I added 1 Tbs of lime juice instead of the zest. Not everyone in my family likes spicy dishes, so I omitted the chili. My family is on a health kick, so I cut back to one tablespoon of oil (and used lime-infused olive oil)...and that was just enough to prevent the shrimp from sticking to the grill, and give it a smoother flavor. I will definite make this again.
