These were ok - not worth hunting down the cumin seeds.

It was an unexpectedly delicious way to serve the cauliflower. The outside is crisp and browned, and the inside is tender.

Thought this was good but not great. Much prefer Lucy Waverman's version - Indian Spiced Cauliflower - 1 tbsp mustard seeds and 2 tsp cumin seeds. More flavourful than this one.

This is AMAZING with a few revisions: 1) use ground spices 2) double or triple spices 3) add salt & pepper 4) optional: serve with yogurt & lime juice or sour cream dip on side. This would be fantastic with Indian food, Mexican food or whatever...I can't wait to have this again. Next time I'd double the recipe for sure!

This is wonderful and quick. I make it all the time and often eat it as a snack.

This recipe is very rich and I made the mistake of preparing it with scallops. The combination was not good. Too rich. I would not reccommend this recipe.

This is such a different way to cook cauliflower, this bland vegetable looks and tastes so "dressed up" with these spices! I would definitely make it again, but I will add more cumin and coriander next time. I also think it is a good salt-free recipe.

I really liked the flavor and texture of the cauliflower. I found it a bit dry alone though, so tossed it in a creamy vinaigrette before serving. I would definitely use this method of cooking cauliflower again.

Nice little recipe. A nice change of pace from the goopy cheese sauce.

I love cauliflower and was looking for a different way to cook it. This was absolutely delicious. Nice & light....will make again.

I've always liked cauliflower in theory but found that unless I had a cheesy sauce on it, it was bland and boring. This recipe however, has changed my mind for good. It was easy and extremely flavorful and didn't have all the calories of a cheese sauce. I think the addition of another vegie like onion or pattypan squash would work well too. The only downside was heating the oven for just one little vegie dish. Next time I'll cook something else at the same time.

I am not a fan of cauliflower, but really loved this recipe. Super easy, interesting dish I've made several times now.

What a wonderfully simple and tasty way to prepare cauliflower! Measurements don't have to be perfect. Just drizzle on as much olive oil and seasoning as you want and it comes out good every time. Sprinkle with a little salt after it comes out of the oven.

waste of cauliflower

Onion? Where's the onion in the recipe? Though I suppose one can adapt this by adding our substituting other veggies. At any rate, it was delicious!!

This recipe was superb. There isn't all that much that one can do with cauliflower, and this one beats using breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese by a mile. We had to triple the olive oil in order to coat all of the cauliflower in the pan, and we doubled the spices for extra flavor. What came out was a veggie side dish that we will now prepare regularly.

I doubled the spices, but I think it needed a little more oil. Not great, but something to add to a vegetarian menu for variety.

I think this is a delicious and easy way to prepare cauliflower, a vegetable for which I have only a few recipes. My best results are mixing the florets with about 1/2 to 1 tsp. each of curry powder, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper and 1-2 tbl. olive oil. Place on a baking sheet and roast at 450* about 20 minutes, turning pieces half-way through.

Delicious! My husband and I both loved it. I used 1 tsp each of the seeds, plus salt and pepper. I used less olive oil, and stirred it once halfway through cooking. Instead of onion, I chopped up 4 garlic cloves. I will definitely make this again!

Recipe does need the additional spices that previous commenters suggested. good and easy (add lots of onion!) but not something that I'd serve to guests.

This is an excellent, tasty, low-fat sidedish for Asian or European meals. I use 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp ground coriander, salt, ground black pepper, and just a dash of garlic powder. I also chop half a yellow onion into eighths and add it to the pan with the spices and cauliflower. Very good taste for extremely little effort.

I'm so happy to find an easy and delicious recipe for cauliflower. It definitely needs some salt, though, and the spices could be increased. I used 1/2 teaspoon of each and it was still very subtle.

I combined this with Cauliflower with ginger & mustard seeds and the results were spicier and quite tasty

Cauliflower tastes great when roasted, and the cumin and coriander add to its nut-flavored qualities. For such an easy dish it's sophisticated enough to serve to discriminating guests.

I rarely served cauliflower before I discovered this terrific recipe, but it's perfect for those days when I don't have much time to cook. It's easy, quick, and delicious (and even better with a little salt added).
