This is not for dieters, but if you use quality Roquefort it's a fantastic blue cheese dressing/dip for wings or crudites. I promise it will make you fat.

A party hit! I used 4oz. blue cheese as that was the pkg size. I think extra blue cheese is delicious. Didn't need to dirty the mixer...spoon/spatula works perfectly. Very thick dip that goes a long way.

I've been making this one for a few years, and it's a hit everytime. I'm always asked for the recipe, a real winner.

I love this recipe. I've made it exactly as written and loved it. Yesterday, I messed up did not have any sour cream, so substituted 4 oz. more cream cheese and increased the amount of celery, onion and garlic. OMG, even better. Am making another batch today.

I doubled the blue cheese and approximately halved the cream cheese, mayo and sour cream. It was nice and thick and held up well. Made 1 1/2 pints. Celery and celery salt? No thanks. Everyone who loves blue cheese will love it and love you for making it. We dipped veggies and crusty bread chunks. I'll make it again to top steaks, burgers, chicken wraps or tomatoes...yum.

I cannot even count the number of times I have made this dip. I have to admit, because I and all my friends and family love garlic AND blue cheese, I often add even more garlic and blue cheese than the recipe calls for. It is just wonderful!!! I am not invited to any event without being asked to bring this!

Made 3/4 of this recipe for New Year's Eve (Only had 6 oz. of 1/3 less fat cream cheese). The changes I made to my 3/4 recipe are: used low fat mayo (only 1/2 cup), low fat sour cream, decreased the celery salt and black pepper to 1/2 tsp. each, and added a healthy sprinkle of celery seed to compensated for less celery salt. We don't much care for blue cheese, so I used 4 oz. of Feta in my 3/4 recipe. No need for a mixer--it mixed well with a wooden spoon. A VERY DELICIOUS DIP for carrot and celery sticks (for the weight conscious--also not so high in sodium as the original recipe) LOVED IT.

I used cottage cheese instead of cream cheese (too lazy to go shopping), also doubled the amount of blue cheese (oops) and topped with toasted pecans. It turned out vey well, though probably a bit softer than the original recipe. I made it in the food processor and served it with sliced apples, grapes and crackers.

I made this dip again at my son's request, but addded almost doulbe the chopped celery and onion (too much as it goes a bit runny the next day), but still tasty, I wanted to use it up, and was debating making either cheese biscuits or cornbread for dinner, saw this in the fridge, so did a combo of all three ideas. Used this recipe: Ingredients: 1 egg, beaten 1 C. sour cream (substituted in 1 cup of blue cheese dip) 2 Tbsp. sugar 1 Tbsp. shortening 1 1/2 C. flour (substituted in1/2 cup of cornmeal for 1/2 cup of the flout) 1 tsp. baking powder (I used 4 tsp.) 1/2 tsp. soda salt Preparation: Mix well and bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes. I put almost 1/4 cup fulls on a baking stone and baked as directed- they were awesome- my mom and aunt took home the 3 leftover ones and my aunt picked all the crumbs out of the bread basket and ate them- quite the sight! They were brown and absolutely declicious.

Made this tonight with the wings, but lots left over. Will try it again tomorrow after it has sat a bit. I too do not eat blue cheese, but this dip was really great. I had to add a bit more mayo and sour cream as it was really thick in my mixer. My husband and son loved it!

Made this for a family dinner party, but had to make some changes to accommodate everyone. I left out the celery (I hate it) and onions (my fiance hates them). Instead used more bleu cheese. I also substituted low fat sour cream and cream cheese(who needs all the fat?), but stuck with regular mayo(let's not get out of hand). Next time I'll probably try roasted garlic instead of raw. As is, it has a nice garlicky flavor, but it's a little biting and pungent. We loved the finished product, especially with fresh sourdough bread.

I loved this! I used it for crackers, as salad dressing and as a topping for rib eye steaks. Great flavor, easy to make and lasts a long time.

This dish had great flavors, but was very easy to whip up in no time! I usually hate blue cheese, but its flavor is not very pronounced in the dip. I just used a wooden spoon to blend it and the dip came out perfectly. I tried it with full-fat versions of the dairy products for one Christmas party, and with low-fat versions for the next. My whole family was unable to tell the difference. Those wanting to cut down on a few of the calories, I'd try the low-fat (not non-fat) versions.

Very good, and quite easy. We had a little left over (it makes a good amount) which we used on hamburgers and baked potatoes. I would definitely make again!

I thought this dip was a bit thick. And, despite the other ingredients, it was all blue cheese. I like blue cheese but I was expecting a better blending of flavor than I got. I feel the finished product doesn't distinguish itself enough to bother making again.

This had a good blue cheese flavor, and the celery gives it a nice crunchy texture. I had this on a buffet at a party with numerous other dips, and this is the only one that was completely gone before the end of the night.

I loved this dip. It is quick, easy and very versatile. Making it a day ahead makes a big difference as it allows the flavors to blend well. Great with veggies and on spuds. I highly recommend!

I used celery seed and minced dried onion instead of fresh celery and onion but I did not like it very much. The altered recipe could've been the problem but I really thought it was too thick and too strong a cheese flavor. I've tried other blue cheese dips that were better.

This is a great dip to serve with crackers. My family and friends rave about it. I have made it twice now and used gorgonzola the second time with great results. I too only used one clove of garlic.

I HATE blue cheese - but I LOVED this! A friend brought it to a party and no one knew what was in it and there were LOTS of guesses. I was pretty surprised my favorite dip at this party was one made with an ingredient I had sworn to never eat. Several of us had to have the recipe! Try it - you will love it.

I used this dip instead of the boring ranch style dip I normally make for crudite. It was a hit with my family! I also substituted with low fat ingredients and it came out fine.

I served this dip with red, yellow, and green bell peppers, baby carrots, raddishes, and cherry tomatoes. It was very good, especially if you like blue cheese - its flavor is very pronounced in this dip. I did leave out the celery as I do not like it, and did not use as much onion. Worth making again.

I made a variation of this recipe and am writing others to encourage experimentation. I didn't have many of the listed ingredients so I improvised. I used about half a cup of crumbled blue cheese, half a cup of feta and 3/4 of a cup of sour cream, raw sliced almonds and will likely serve this tasty combination with celery and carrot sticks and crackers.

I made this with veggies for thanksgiving, and it was OK. Next time i would use better cheese, and perhaps some hot sauce to give it a kick. It was pretty bland.

Blue cheese lovers will devour this. But then, why would you make it if you didn't like blue cheese? I soaked many varieties of fresh vegees in cold water in the fridge overnight and had them cold and crisp the next day to drag through this delicious dip!

This dip was way too strong made with 2 cloves of garlic!!! The garlic flavor overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients and ruined the dip. Only the most "garlic hardy" party guests liked this dip.

Very good - but some suggestions. The recipe says it can be kept for 3 days. But, if you plan to make this ahead (as I did), let the onions and celery drain well on paper towels before adding them. Otherwise you can end up with a soupy mess (as I did)on the second day.

This was so good and very easy. I served it with carrots. I've already made it twice. If you like blue cheese you will love this. The first time I used gorgonzola (milder) and the second time I used regular blue cheese. Both were excellent.
