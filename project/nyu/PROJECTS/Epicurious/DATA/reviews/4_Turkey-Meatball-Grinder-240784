I was looking for a turkey meatball recipe without breadcrumbs or cheese in it, and Im so glad I found this one! It was delicious and easy! First time making meatballs. Made a few changes: used only 1.25 lbs ground turkey, 2 tsp of italian seasoning (instead of 1tsp of each basil and oregano), and baked them on a cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick spray for 20min at 350deg. I then added them to marinara sauce I made from this link (http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-marinara-pasta-sauce-vegetarian-136292) and let them simmer in there for ~15min. They turned out perfect! Will def. make again.

This recipe was amazing. I made it for my friend who is a very picky eater. He loved it. I was nervous to put the fennel in, but it turned out to be perfect. Instead of serving it as a sandwich I made it a pasta dish also I added more fennel than the recipe called for, which made the meatballs a bit more zingy. Loved this recipe and will make it again.

A home run with everyone--husband and two kids (8 and 11). A great choice for casual summer dinner on the porch. The fennel is an essential ingredient.

Do not change the recipe. You will love these meatballs. The mixture is very runny when you make it. You may be tempted to add breadcrumbs, but don't. When the meatballs are cooked through, they are moist and delicious

Great meatballs. I was worried that I would not like the fennel as I had never added fennel to meatballs. But because the recipe had 4 forks, I went ahead and added the fennel. The dish was delicious. Don't change a thing.

These have become the standby recipe for meatball subs. Used ground pork instead and halved the meat but used the same amount of spices. Also doubled the fennel (anise) seeds as that is the taste that really makes these authentic.

I halved this recipe. Didn't put in the fennel because I didn't have it - that might have made the meatballs more flavorful. Added some dried breadcrumbs and a few splashes of Wocestershire sauce. Made the meatballs a little too big, and they did not cook through in the pan. I fried them for about 10 min, then transferred to a casserole dish, poured sauce on top, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. I'll probably make this again, but this time will definitely add salt to the mix and some more herbs/spices.

These meatballs are great! Based on prior reviews, we used half of the meat, but the full amount of other ingredients (with herbs from the garden). The meatballs are very moist when cooked through, which is unusual for turkey meatballs. The grated onion is essential!

These were the best meatballs I've ever had! I used half the turkey as I only needed two servings, but I kept the measurements for the spices and onion and put tons of garlic, which I love. I served them up in a whole wheat hot dog bun and added red peppers and sliced mushrooms and covered the whole thing with mozzarella, then put it in the oven to melt. Soooooo good! Can't wait to make it again! I'm gonna try the meatballs on spaghetti next time.

Don't let the simplicity fool you - I really enjoyed these meatballs. I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and the basil. The onion is the key to keeping these nice and moist. Don't omit the fennel seed. I will definitely make these again. A great healthy alternative!

I used the turkey meatball recipe for spaghetti and meatballs. They were definitely satisfying, and I'll make them again. I may add one or two more things next time around, but they were tasty and did not disappoint with veggie marinara and parm over spaghettil.

Okay these were the best turkey Meatballs I have ever had. Although I had to substitute a few things. I had only one package of turkey meat, 1/2 an onion, 2 T garlic, 1 T dried Italian seasoning, 1 T dried parsley. The rest was the same. Instead of cooking the meatball until they were done, I browned them added my homemade tomatoe sauce to the pan covered them w/cheese and put them in the oven 350 for 20min. My husband said they were the best meatballs he has ever had.
