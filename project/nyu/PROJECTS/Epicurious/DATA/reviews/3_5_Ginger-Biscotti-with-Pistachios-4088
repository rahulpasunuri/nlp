Too much sugar, not enough flour, not enough egg . . . which ever way you look at it, this recipe is a complete disaster!

I have been making this recipe for at least 5 years. My family doesn't ask for much, but my father practically demands these appear in his Christmas package each year. They are absolutely delicious. I modify slighty and use macademias instead of pistachios and I dip one side in white chocolate. Perfect with morning coffee any time of year!

I used to make these biscotti every year for the holidays. Back then I made the recipe right from the magazine--and it seems this online version has an error with the "1 egg yolk." Wish I had read all the reviews BEFORE I made them, but now I know, 2 eggs! Still unique and delicious!

I'll try it again. The result was some very delicious crumbs. Pay heed to those who warned about how crumbly these were. I'll give it another go with another egg...maybe not cook so long the first time. Also, the directions to make a 1/2 inch roll don't make sense unless you want biscotti smaller than domino-size.

Always a hit!

I have made this recipe several times already and have received rave raviews every single time, including from some Italian friends who wondered if I had gone to their home country to learn to make these delicious confections! My boyfriend is especially taken with these, another plus! Instead of the refrigeration, I freeze the logs for 20 minutes and bake on parchment paper. Do let them cool for the recommended time before cutting. Also, I add more pistachios than the recipe calls for.

This recipe is terrible! I consider myself a good baker and have rarely had any "flops" but this one was my first. I tried making this recipe twice and even tried to doctor it up the third time, but it was still a disaster! It completely fell apart when I attempted to slice the logs. Bon Appetite should be ashamed of themselves for printing this recipe!

By far among the best tasting biscotti I've ever had. Found similar problem like others with dough being too crumbly. Just added another egg and about 1/4 C more flour. What really gives these a nice zing is to add 2 T. coarsely chopped crystallized/candied ginger. YUMMY!

This biscotti is delicious and very easy to make. The only difficulty I had was that the dough was too floury (maybe because I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour?), so I added a whole egg and then the dough was perfect.

This is my third year making these biscotti. I skipped last year in order to try a new recipe and was severely chastised by my husband and daughter. These biscotti have definitely become a part of our Christmas tradition.

This is one of the most requested recipes when I serve these cookies to guests. I use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour and I dip the biscotti in chocolate once they've cooled. I think they're also fabulous without the chocolate.

Could not shape into logs, as the "dough" was so crumbly it just fell apart. Tasted OK, but not nearly as good as the chocolate walnut biscotti.
