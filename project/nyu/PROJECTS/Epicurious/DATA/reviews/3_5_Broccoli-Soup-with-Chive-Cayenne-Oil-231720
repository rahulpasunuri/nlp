Simple and delicious! The recipe as presented produces a soup that I thought was flavorful but a little anemic. So I added one-third cup of sour cream, which brought it from three to four forks.

Just okay. I added a little cheese and potato to give it more body. I also thought the chive oil was interesting, but not outstanding. Doesn't come close to my standby broccoli, white bean, and barley soup from Marcella Hazan's "Cucina" cookbook.

It was easy to make and good, but not 4 forks. Someone suggested adding pine nuts and I would do that if I were to make it again. I did add extra cayenne and after tasting it, added a dollop of non fat sour cream.

I agree that the Dec 93 cream of broccoli recipe is better. I think that the mustard powder gives it a nice flavor. I also added 1 chopped jalapeno pepper sauteed it with the onions. It was not too spicy but you can add a dollop a sour cream or yoghurt on top when serving for contrast. I personally also add some cheese on top as well.

Very good and very healthy. I ate too much of it - it was so good!

This soup was easy, but it sure it good! I followed the recipe except I doubled it, as I had 2 lbs. of broccoli to finish up. Very tasty! Also good with a few toasted pine nuts sprinkled on top for a bit of crunch.

A great, simple, healthy and inexpensive recipe. I made it the first time (exactly as written) for a dinner party to rave reviews. Since I have served it countless times...hot, cold (in shot glasses), with the oil, or sprinkled with walnut oil and red pepper flakes...and make a smaller batch any time I have extra broccoli on hand. If I have potatoes, sometimes I'll add one or two. Also benefits from a swirl of butter before serving. By all means use an imersion blender.

This is a great basic recipe, but I kick mine up with some cheddar, sour cream, and parmesan. This adds the depth of a heavy cream without the calories. I also add more cayenne to balance out the sour cream, and chive oil is fantastic. I always make a huge batch to last 3 days!

Very disappointed in this soup. First, it was waay to watery for our tastes so I ended up thickening it with a potato blended in. I was already annoyed with it so I didn't want to make the chive oil, so instead we just added cayenne and blended in some chopped chives to maintain the spirit of the recipe flavors. Still - ho hum, ok but there is better out there.

chive-cayenne oil GREAT, see many uses for it... soup is just OK, CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP, Gourmet, December 1993 is better

This was quite tasty and healthy, and gets four forks for ease of preparation. The only real work in this recipe is blending the soup. The oil is a nice touch, and the soup is especially good with some crusty bread. Surprisingly filling as well. Not the most impressive recipe, but a great quick weeknight soup.

This is a nice, simple soup. I used scallions instead of chives, and veggie stock instead of chicken. The soup definitely benefits from the addition of some sour cream or 1/2 and 1/2, and can stand more than a pinch of cayenne (depending on how much more kick you want!).

Loved this soup. I'm not one to typically go ga ga over broccoli. Added a little bit of half and half at the end to make it creamier. The chive oil is to die for. Seems like it would be a good way to make kids eat vegetables.

Read my lips: Blah. Why go through all the trouble and ingredients to make this soup when washing and eating broccoli on its own would be easier and much tastier. The chive oil recipe is a keeper, however, and is great for dipping bread.

I thought the soup had plenty of "body". The soup is low-fat, and delicious. Oh, and the chive-cayenne oil gets 4 forks! My husband enjoyed it as a dip for bread.

this is a great base-I added 1 jar of chestnuts & then purred the whole batch in the pot w/an imersion blender- the oil is top notch... & the chestnuts added the body that was missing...

The soup was very nice but not the best ever - easy and good, though. The chive cayenne oil is a real winner - great on this soup or cauliflower soup or drizzled on steamed potatoes and green beans or all sorts of roast vegetables and other uses - simple and lasts for at least a week.

I added some dried thyme (didn't have fresh onhand) and garlic to the onion as it was cooking. Excellent and simple soup. I also topped with a spoonful of fat free sour cream with the oil. Be sure to cool off well before putting in the blender or you'll have brocolli on your walls like I did!

Wow!!!!! Easy, spicy, different and the ciboullet oil perfect as a finish touch. I have done it twice and I will do it again. Try it.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I found the chive-cayenne oil fantastic and the soup just OK, although it is a great basic soup. I will make it again and add some garlic or maybe even cilantro for added kick.

The soup was terrific, though I thought the cayenne-chive oil was too weak. I added a healthy dose of chipotle powder. It was phenomenal.

I love Broccoli and this is one of the best broccoli soups I have made. It was a lovely first course. I mixed the left over chive oil with mayo to make a fabulous BLT!

I have made this recipe 4 times since it came out. It is very simple and yeilds surprisingly satisfying results! It is unexpectedly hearty, filling, and healthy! It also adds a beautiful vibrant green color to the meal. I also tried using leftovers in an omelet- it was a little messy for an omelet, but the flavor was awesome! I will keep this as a staple in my kitchen as it is almost as good as a hot soup as cold- great for the whole year!

I made this because I thought it would be a unique way to get our vegetables, and it turned out to be much better than I anticipated. I mixed some of the cayenne oil into the soup just before serving as well as added some on top.
