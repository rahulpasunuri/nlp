This is my favorite base recipe, you can add savory spices like garlic and rosemary to make it even better. I like to baste the bread with melted butter and garlic just before baking. You can also use whole wheat flour, even oats.

I've made this recipe a number of times and love it. I have close to zero baking experience and this baguette comes out good every time. Whenever I bring this to a party I always get a, "you MADE this?" - which I think is a good sign.

I'm a woman who always wants to try to cook but never has the time, that being said, it is fair to assume that I do not have much experience baking bread. I tried this recipe for the first time and I have to say I love it, as do my family!! This has given me courage to try something else.

This is a good recipe for last-minute bread baking. I made the recipe as written except rather than brush the bread with water, I put a pan of water in the oven for the first 15 minutes. I have also made a whole wheat variation. I substituted 1.5 cups whole wheat flour for 1.5 cups of the white in the first 4 cups. I like this version much better and will made it this way from now on.

This was very good for a fast rise bread. I let it rise for about 4 hours and it came out very good. It was salty, but in a good way - it needed it because the short rise doesn't lend much flavor. Will make again!

What a great recipe (including the tweaks)! I followed reviewers' advice and used a whole package of yeast, 2 tsp of sugar and about 4 and a scant 1/4 cup of flour. Let bread double rise (about 2 hours the first time, then shaped into two loaves and let rise another 3 hours before putting them in the fridge when they looked big enough...in the future I wouldn't put them in the fridge at all). Put a Pyrex casserole full of boiling water in the bottom and set at 500--then lowered the oven to 400, popped the bread in and baked for 35 minutes. I would have liked to leave them in another 5 but my eaters were getting impatient. Oh, and I skipped adding water to the bread crust. I covered the loaves in flour and sprinkled chopped fresh rosemary over them and drizzled with olive oil before baking. Seriously delicious, but more like an Italian country loaf or a French peasant loaf than a real baguette. Still highly recommended for dinner bread in one day!

I just made this recipe for the first time. Ok, so, I'm an idiot, and I ran out of AP flour after cup number 2. I used self-rising flour for the rest of it. I let it rise the first time for about 4 hours, instead of the 1 1/2 in the recipe. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. My bread turned out really tasty! The outside was nice and crusty and it wasn't super dense on the inside. I'm wondering if that was a product of the baking powder in self-rising flour. It is a tad salty for my taste, so I may cut down on that next time, and I'll probably use sea salt instead of the table salt. The only other thing is that it's not golden on the outside. crusty? Yes. Done? Yes. It's just not browned properly. Would using butter brushed on the outside instead of water help?

I just made this bread for the first time, but I used bread flour instead of AP flour. I only ended up using 4 cups, and didn't need the last 1/2 cup. Also, I let the bread do the first rise in the fridge overnight, which tends to give bread a better flavor and texture. If you've got the time, I'd recommend trying this. Just let it come to room temperature the next day before letting it do the final rise. Also, I brushed the outside with water mixed with a little corn starch, which helps with crust development. I reduced the salt content to only 2 teaspoons and it was seasoned perfectly, but I might try the recommended 2.5 next time. Also, I kneaded it in my stand mixer until it was very firm, because I like chewy baguettes.

I think you need Parisian water, air or attitude to make the perfect baguette. With that said, after reading the reviews and taking notes I don't even know what the original recipe was. I used one package dry yeast, 1tsp sugar, 2 tsp's salt and 2 n 1/2 cups flour. After letting it rise for 1.5 hours I punched it down and folded it and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I placed a pan of boiling water in the bottom of a 500 degree oven and threw a cup or so in when putting the loaves on a baking stone. Crispy gold crust, a little dense and a bit too salty. Over all a pretty good loaf. I'm going to try Julia Child's recipe.

To the cook from Halifax -- thanks for your input - I guess we need ESP to know that the only modification needed is letting it rise overnight -- oh and it also appears that it makes 3 baguettes not 1 according to your post :). I just bought a baguette pan from Williams & Sonoma with perforations to make a crisp crust. Their ingredients are almost the same as this recipe but the yeast is increased to 3 1/4 tsp. Their recipe states it makes 2 baguettes and says to put a pan of boiling water in the oven per other peoples reviews here. I will try the recipe tonight and report back. And I will also try letting it rise overnight another time. I hope I can find the perfect baguette recipe like the ones in a boulangerie in Paris -- crispy on the outside and a light airy crumb on the inside.

Rating: 4
I don't know why others are having a hard time with "getting this right"...over night is the only modification required here, per the other reviews. I've never made bread before this recipe, and I impressed many, including myself, with this bread. This recipe made 3 fantastic french baguettes, which all fit onto one medium-large cookie sheet. I followed the ingredients of the recipe (except I used olive oil to grease the bowl and cookie sheet). After letting it rise the first time (per the instructions), I then punched it down, took it out of the bowl, and separated it into 3 portions. Then i hand rolled/stretched them (with some flour on the table and on my hands) onto the oiled cookie sheet, and let it set overnight (approx. 7-8 hours). When i woke up, they were HUGE! I thought "oh no, i messed up"... we'll see! I then cut the baguette-lines with my knife (this was a bit tricky, since the dough was so fluffy), brushed them with olive oil, and stuck them in the oven for 30 minutes. BOOM! 3 beautiful looking and wonderful tasting baguettes. We ate one of them first thing that morning before we left for work, and cut another in half for us each to take for lunch. Easily four forks. I'll be making this again tonight. I'm just that impressed...

oops, meant 2 forks below :)

Rating: 2
This is NOT a baguette which is why I give it 4 forks. It tasted good though. It is more like a somewhat dense italian loaf. I made it according to the directions but per other reviews, doubled the yeast and also only ended up using a total of about 3 3/4 cups of flour until it felt right while kneading. I also brushed water on it a second and third time while cooking. I can only assume more flour would have made it more dense (unless it was the brushing of more water). Back to the drawing board to find the perfect french baguette like in Paris....

I gave this recipe four forks because it is so *easy* and very good. Love it.

The loaf came out pretty dense. I let it rise for more than the 1.5 hours the recipe suggested, but wasn't able to let it rise overnight. I'll definitely make time for that in the future. Other than that, it turned out really well. I used a little less sugar and a little more salt than recommended, and the bread had a really great flavor.

Made this recipe-very pleased with the crust-i sprayed the bread and the oven with a sray bottle of water 3 times while baking-beautiful crust-but way too much flour-making it too dense-next time i am going to use about 3 cups-and make 2 baguettes instead of a huge one-very good taste -love the salt.

If you really want a flavorful baguette, make a starter by mixing 1/2 C water, 1 C unbleached bread flour and a pinch of active dry yeast and let sit at room temp overnight. Add the rest of the water, flour, yeast and salt (skip the sugar), mix well and proceed with recipe with suggested modifications in my earlier review.

Rating: 0
substitute 1 - 1 1/2 C unbleached white whole wheat flour (King Arthur is a good brand) for a more rustic loaf. Put an old cast iron frying pan filled with lava rocks in the bottom of the oven before pre-heating and fill with water when the loaves are put in the oven. I also have a HearthStone in my oven that replicates the even radiant heat needed for oven rise and crisp crust. If you want big holes so you can sop up olive oil, put the loaves in the refrigerator overnight after they have risen for about 1 hour. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before putting them in the oven.

Rating: 3
This was my first time, and the results taste great with a nice crust and lots of holes after rising overnight with double yeast. I made it on parchment without oil, though, and it ended up sickly pale despite brushing with water and using the pan of water in the bottom of the oven. Will use oil for a better color the next time!

We make this bread several times a week and it seems to get better each time. It has replaced our store bought bread for the most part. Someone suggested letting it rise overnight and I strongly agree - it tastes much better every time we do that. We usually top it with sesame seeds prior to baking. We always double the yeast, and maybe a little more than double.

i have never made bread before, and this was a great beginner recipe, as it came out great! i will definitely make this again, rather than buying those stale loaves in paper bags at the store. i doubled the yeast, per others' suggestions. also, in one batch, i used whole wheat flour, and it turned out just as well.

Super easy and nice to have in one day. Mine had more of a dense french bread texture, but still delicious. I think I'll nix the oil next time in hopes of a crispier crust. I used bread flour because I was short on AP. Will definitely make again, a great quick loaf.

Rating: 0
To get that crisp crust, first heat the oven to 450 deg for 1/2 hour with the baking stone on the second from the bottom notch. While the oven is heating, put an old cast iron skillet on a HOT burner and leave it there. You want it as hot as you can get it. Whenthe oven is hot, slide the baguette onto the baking stone, slide the skillet into the oven bottom and pour some water into the skillet. Lots of steam will result and your baguette will have that brittle, crisp crust. I have farted around with various methods for about 5 years and this one works just fine, thank you.

*sigh* taste is great...except for my little brain f*rt, made one baguette, put it in my rectangular cloche (stone baker w/ cover) made "kaiser rolls" of the others, put them right into the oven, sorta forgot to give them time to rise again. But like I said, the taste is great. Used only 1.5 tsp of salt, added sesame seeds, almost broke a tooth, etc.

Rating: 3
Ok, I'll admit I cheated a bit--I used a bread machine to make the dough (which I only used about 4 cups of flour for, a mix of 12 grain and whole wheat), and I, too, doubled the amount of yeast. Before baking, I topped the bread with whole oats, poppyseeds, and a grain mix, which not only completed the look of this loaf, but added a little something to the flavour. Speaking of which, you dont need as much salt to give this bread flavour if you serve it with some spreads such as dates and raisins (2:1 ratio with water) or carmelized onions and garlic. All around, soft, wholesome, and sumptuously warm from the oven!

I've made about 20 loaves so far and this is a keeper. I do, of course, make changes! I use one package of yeast and exactly 4 cups of flour. Here is what I do: Whiz everything except water in food processor with dough blade. I have a KA, a big one. Slowly add warm water and knead for about 1-2 minutes.I use unbleached regular Gold Medal flour. Transfer to greased bowl and let rise until double. The kicker: I use a 3 loaf baguette pan. Worth the 11.95 it cost from Amazon. Gets more use than my tube pan... Anyway, wet hands under the tap and punch down dough and divide into three balls. Keeping hands wet, stretch the dough into 3 long skinny loaves and place in Pam sprayed pan. Let rise for an hour. Brush loaves with water and bake at 400 for 30 minutes.No pan of water in oven. Transfer to wire racks and, we LOVE it this way, brush loaf while hot with evoo and sprinkle with dried thyme and garlic powder (or minced fresh). This is better than most bread I have had at nice restaurants!

This is a great recipe! I also, as others have recommended, preheat my oven to 500 for about 30 minutes with a pan of water in the bottom. When I put the bread in I lower the heat after 5 minutes or so.

Lesson learned after 50+ loaves: forget the grease. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper instead. Clean up is instant (crumple and toss), and it tastes exactly the same!

I have now made about 25 loaves with this recipe. This is "the one". However, I find it tastes better and the dough is easier to work if you use King Arthur unbleached bread flour, instead of all-purpose. This bread is also very appealling as a big, round "peasant loaf".

Rating: 4
This is great (and very easy). Bread is just out of the oven and my husband and I are sitting here munching - he's eaten almost half the loaf already. And, I'll quote him - he said, "I don't think you should ever make another bread. This is the one." Its very, very good. I followed some previous posters' advice and used less flour than called for - I just kneaded until the dough felt right - about 3.5 cups in the end. I also made more than one loaf since the one wouldn't fit on the cookie sheet I used. Tasty. I think I'll be making it again tomorrow!

This is wonderful bread.I've been trying to make bread for 6 months (allergies have forced me to) and this is the first recipe I've succeeded at on the first try. You need to understand that all bread recipes I've ever tried call for twice as much flour as needed, and this recipe is no different... Use 2 1/2 cups of flour... your bread will be moist and lovely. The salt really does make the flavor... don't leave any out. Like the others, I doubled the yeast, and I put a pan of water in the oven while it baked. Also, I used kosher salt because I can't have processed salt. I used a double baguette loaf pan I bought at Williams-Sonoma.

Made the dough with the Kitchen-Aid. Started after lunch and had fresh bread for dinner. Nothing complicated or complex; just crusty-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside, yeasty loaf. A little butter, a little preserve: heaven! Will be making again soon (may bake on a slate next time)....

a fabulous recipe. i make it with the cuisinart and reduce the salt to 2 tspns- no other alterations warranted. for cuisinart: put dry ingredients (salt and flour) in cuisinart with dough blade. while processing, slowly add wet ingredients (water, sugar, yeast). after dough forms ball and cleans side of cuisinart, continue processing for about 45 seconds to knead. transfer dough to oiled bowl for rising and continue with recipe as written. definitely add steaming water to oven to aid crust development. with a dish of olive oil and some savory little tasting dishes, a glorious meal in itself.

Rating: 3
I used the recommendations from the first comments to modify, and used fresh yeast... in summary, 2 1/2 tsp fresh yeast, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 1 cup water to reduced (1 tsp) salt. I also made 2 loaves instead of one. Although the presentation before baking was, um, a little flat, the final products were two great loaves - soft and lightly browned on the outside, and delicate inside. My only change would be to perhaps bake a little longer to crisp up the crust.

Rating: 3
well, I used the suggested yeast amount, but only about 2.5 cups flour. everything came along nicely. this is not boulangerie baguette but it is quite good. I never use salt in bread dough, but added about a tsp. for this recipe, since it is apparently so important. Advice for those of you who say the dough was too stiff: baguette needs a stiff dough especially if you do not have a specialty pan, as it needs to support itself. however, use only as much flour as it needs to be non-sticky-use your common sense, adn add the flour in dustings, working it in while you knead. Also, for those who can get it, white lilly unbleached bread flour is as close as i have found to french style bread flour.

Rating: 2
I do agree that it would be as hard as a rock. Adding 2 1/4 tsp of yeast would make it softer. I also discovered that adding steam in the oven helped. Pouring 1 cup of hot water in the oven 5 minutes before baking will add crispiness on the outside, and softness on the inside. This helps the dough rise a couple of minutes during baking and steam will make the outside crispy.

Rating: 3
After trying the original recipe, I made a few adjustments that have yielded great baguettes. I took the advice to use more yeast. I used an entire packet (over 2 teaspoons, I think), and that made a huge difference. Also, USE BREAD FLOUR. All-Purpose flour will work, but the baguette will be more dense on the inside and less flaky on the outside. I have a 3-baguette pan (bought at Amazon), so I divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and end up with 3 lovely, small baguettes. These keep well, too. Just wrap in foil and reheat the following day.

This bread was as hard as a rock on the outside, mind you it was tasty. Next time I'll use best for bread flour and I don't know where all that flour is supposed to go- it was a dry flour ball and dificult to need. It doesn't even rise. Maybe with the other flour it would have been better. I suggest looking for another bread recipe- Cheers!

I agree completly with the cook who said it was too dense. I did two smaller baguettes from the dough and the one I couldn´t eat I will make a bread pudding... what to do? In fact I have a wonderful recipe for baguette, but I decided to try this one and was a disappointment!

We have been making this bread almost every day since I found the recipe. It is easy but you must let the dough rise for longer than is stated. While it is crunchy as a true baguette should be, I don't find it quite as light and fluffy as I had hoped. I have tried using bread flour instead of all purpose flour with some improvement. I have used a dough hook with my Kitchen Aid and I have also used my Cuisinart with the steel knife. Both work well. All in all, a great bread with very little work.

This is a fantastic bread recipe, even though it doesn't taste like a true French baguette. I have also substituted 1C of wheat flour for the regular wheat flour (definitely add an extra tsp of yeast for this) and it makes, and I'm quoting my husband, the "best bread" I have "ever made!". It's so easy too.

I made this recipe yesterday and found it to be very easy and quite tasty, a really good bread. I usually follow recipes exactly and decide from there how to alter if necessary, but the comments regarding the amount of yeast made me double the yeast. I was pleased with the result, as the bread doubled in bulk as it should and was moist inside with a beautiful crunchy crust. I gave it ample time to rise both times, even extending the second rise by 10 minutes. I served this with shrimp pate, and my guests raved.

I tried to let my bread machine do the kneading, and maybe that was my problem, but this was impossibly dense and hard. Since making this recipe I have consulted several other recipes that call for 1 1/2 to 3 times as much yeast as this one. Also, as I understand things, the larger-than average amount of salt probably weakens the already insubstantial amount of yeast in this recipe. I would recommend a recipe using more yeast, especially if you are using the knead function on your bread machine.

Am about to try this recipe. For those who want a crispy crust, use a baking stone and be sure to mist the oven. For an inexpensive baking stone, measure you oven rack,go to your local home improvement store, and get some unglazed quarry tiles cut to fit your oven. It may take many pieces but it is cheap and it works well. I use them on the middle shelf and the bread comes out crispy all over (don't use a pan) without getting too brown on the top or bottom. Hope this helps.

This was absolutely wonderful! I didn't alter any ingredients, and followed the directions exactly. Under someone's recommendation, I have recently begun putting my yeast in the freezer. I don't know if this had some sort of adverse effect, but the first two batches I tried to proof weren't very foamy. At the third, I simply went ahead with the rest of the recipe. I almost threw it out when I checked its size after an hour and a half, and it had only risen perhaps a quarter of what it should. I'm so glad I didn't. I made two smaller loaves, finger brushing both with water before placing in the oven. I was cooking a vegetable dish at the same time, so the oven was already warm and slightly humid. They came out like a dream- soft on the inside, tough and crusty on the outside. My fiancee, who doesn't really care for bread, went back for seconds. I can't wait to try this again!!

Could someone please tell me if a baguette is supposed to have a crispy crust? This one didn't come out crispy for me and it's really frustrating!!! What should I do to make it better? Please write me if you have suggestions. For all you guys who came out with bread that was too dense, try making the dough a little differently -- a less stiff dough and more sticky might help. Also, maybe you could add an extra teaspoon of yeast. I did this and the dough was really hard to work with it, but the results (on the inside) were fantastic!

This bread is great and I do make it all the time but it is by no means a true baguette. Then again, if anyone out there has ever been able to re-create a boulangerie-quality loaf in a humble home oven, I haven't heard about it. For novice bread bakers: It's super easy. I do it in my boyfriend's kitchen which is totally rudimentary -- 1 pot, 1 pan, a baking sheet and a casserole dish. Just remember, the key is in using absolutely fresh yeast and kneading like mad. Also, put a pan of H2O in a 500 degree oven for about an hour before baking to insure a crispy exterior. Failing that, spritz interior of oven with a water bottle every 10 minutes or so while baking. Don't cut salt if you want real French flavor.

I was bitterly disappointed with this recipe--it was inedible. The first rising went fine, but after shaping loaves the dough was like lead. Not sure what went wrong, but boy was that a lot of work and mess for nothing!

I also added less salt (2 tsp.) and put a large pan of boiling water at the bottom of the oven. After the first rising I cut the dough in two and rolled two smaller loaves at about 11 inches long each. Finally, instead of using a cooking sheet I used a Perforated Baguette Pan. The result: wonderful round baguettes with a nice crust, soft bottom, and chewy centre. This is a recipe I definitely plan on using more often.

I like a less dense baguette than this recipe makes, but it was very good. I had to let the dough rise a lot longer than expected - probably either because of the small amount of yeast or because my kitchen was fairly cold, but keep that in mind when you're making this.

Excellent as is! I use King Arthur classic flour and nothing compares. I created a loaf variation of the recipe that was devoured by my guests: After the loaf has proofed, rub the surface with a frozen cube of Pino Grigio or Chardonay (as opposed to cool water). Imbed sprigs of thyme along the top surface and dust the loaf with a good hard cheese such as pecorino or asiago. Follow the 30 minute bake time and enjoy a very pretty robust baguette.
