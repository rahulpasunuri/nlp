I made this yesterday, and am waiting to serve it at a party tonight... for about 30 people. In multiplying the recipe, I used 5 batches of batter to fill 7 12x17" cookie sheets, plus one that didn't work out at all. The final top layer was an entire batch of batter -- I found it very difficult to spread the batter thinly and evenly over that expanse. Larger layers also seem to take much, much longer to bake, more like 20 minutes than 7. Parchment paper was very important in getting the layers off of the pans and onto the other layers at this size. I managed a few layers without it, but they were ugly. Thankfully, the buttercream (which is delicious) covers all that. I did not manage to get the caramel to set correctly, but I think the double recipe I'd made would have been the right amount if it had turned out. I will try this again in a smaller batch. Making it for 30+ people was a bit insane, but do-able, an all-day kind of project.

Ladies....Relax, make the cake again....The layers of cake are supposed to be hard. They soften as they sit with the cream. The caramel top is supposed to be cut all the way through before it hardens completely. You can make the caramel top on the nine inch pan that you used to bake the cake layers, cut it and place it over you Dobos. For a nice effect, put a dollop of cream under each caramel "slice" right at the edge of the cake and tilt the caramel slice a bit... I hope you know what I mean. It was my favorite cake growing up and it is still one of my favorites.... You can make the buttercream more chocolaty if you wish. That is how I like it. And I wish I can convince you to give it another try. Especially the ladies that are accomplished bakers.

This was a lot of work for a very disappointing result. The cake layers were either too hard and crispy or too soft and chewy. I tried to find a balance, but despite seven attempts (and a lot of baking experience) I was unsuccessful. To boot, the flavor just isn't great for either the buttercream or the cake layers.

I am only a moderately experienced baker, but I did not run into the challenges others did. For each layer I drew a circle on parchment paper, ladled ~1/2 c. batter inside & smoothed it out to fill the border, and baked it for 7 1/2 mins. on top of a cookie sheet. When I took the layer out of the oven, I inverted it onto a second sheet of parchment paper & carefully peeled off the first one. One note about the caramel topping: yes, it's supposed to be hard, so I only used about half of the caramel to keep the layer from being too thick. On other sites with this recipe, they tell you to cut the caramel layer all the way through into separate wedges, and I will do that next time so that serving the cake at the table isn't such a mess. This cake was a big hit with my guests, and I'm adding it to my regular repertoire of pareve (dairy-free) cakes.

i agree with the person above. the icing was no sweat, but the cake was challenging. And I'm an experienced baker. I tried it a few ways (and had to make triple the batter) but finally realized that the easiest thing is to put the 9 in circle of parchment, greased and floured IN the 9in pan. Then it came out perfect and was even all over. As for the topping. I used a the butter cream in the middle, and a chocolate ganache on the top and sides. Just like i had as a kid.

The icing was fabulous but the cake layers tasted like card board???? Is there something missing in the batter? I used the oblong pans.

Is delicious but took some learning (and initial frustration) to make it work. Icing was easy but the cake part was a bit tricky for me. Made this two times unsuccessfully - determined to make it work because it was for someone who has fond childhood memories of the cake - and on the third try was successful with the cake layers by using the alternative recommended method of cutting out 9" parchment rounds, buttering & flouring them, and then baking them on cookie sheets. Takes a number of cooling racks to make the transfer out of the oven successful. Also, took much more than 1/4 cup to cover the parchment - probably closer to a 1/2 cup but there was enough batter. Found it easiest to prepare all the parchments on the cookie sheets first and then bake them quickly in succession. Had no trouble with two cookie sheets at a time (2 per sheet) if I rotated them halfway through baking. Didn't bother with the caramel topping option because the friend I was making it for said it was never on the NYC versions she grew up with.

To the professional cook from Peterborough: note that the recipe says to cook the batter on the BOTTOM of the cake pans. That means you must turn the pan over, using it as a small round cookie sheet. The extra batter will dribble over the side a bit, but it's easy to shape this way and slides off nicely. Don't over-butter the pan or it will slide off too much before it cooks.

Made this for my hungarian boyfriend and family - it reminded him of his grandmother's cooking. For the buttercream - I just left the kitchen-aid going and very slowly added the ingredients - it was truly amazing! Did the oblong variation and it made it easy to work with. The caramel was sticky to clean but great on the cake! Its a must at least once!

After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to make this for my mother's birthday. I'm an experienced baker, and it was a major disaster. The layers were so thin they basically fell apart when I removed them from the pan. When I tried a slightly thicker layer, it browned on the edges but was uncooked in the middle. I can't believe nobody else has mentioned how difficult this cake is to make! I tried both with parchment paper and without, and no success. I'm sure it would have been delicious, but this cake is a major challenge!

Whew! This is delicious, but rich! The preparation wasn't so bad. My only question is, Is the caramel topping supposed to be hard as a rock? We almost broke out teeth biting into it. Make sure you only eat small slices of this cake. I ate a big piece and I could feel the cholesterol moving in my body. But it's worth it.

this is a lot of work and definitely worth it... i use a large cookie sheet to bake half the batter and then cut into thirds so i end up with just 6 oblong layers..... it is wonderful... i do not use the caramel sauce but use an easy ganache for the entire outside... my most requested cake!

The reviewer who said that it is not the Hungarian Dobostorte without the caramel topping is correct. Without the caramel this cake becomes a German tort called a "Prinzregentetorte," or Prince Regent Cake.

Easiest way to make cake layers is to make circles on parchment paper, cut out, then grease and flour them. Bake on cookie sheets. If you make circles smaller than 9" you'll get more layers!

If you want to make a real Dobos cake, the caramel topping is not optional - without it, its just a chocolate cake.

This cake definately is a big job, but the results are worth it. The cake looks unbelievable and it would be a sure show stopper at any occasion. The only comment I would have on the recipe itself is that the batter was pretty thick and a 1/4 cup was not enough to cover the bottom of the pan. I would skip measuring and just coat the bottom of a nine inch pan with a thin layer of batter. Otherwise the rest of the instruction were clear and the cake came out great.
