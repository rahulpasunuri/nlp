This would be more interesting if the cakes would actually stick together and have some density. Wondering if using jasmine rice (Trader Joes, brown jasmine)might help them hold their shape..or mixing in a beaten egg?

Excellent!!!!! With or without the butter glaze on top.

Have had this rice as cakes or just caraway rice and enjoyed it both ways

My husband and I were not big fans of this recipe at all. You might as well just make plain rice or orzo. We will not fix this recipe again.

Wonderful and easy. My kids loved them. Made some without the butter and they were excellent

A disapointing result. The above recipe seems quite pointlesss as far as it goes. I'd like something with rice flour, actually. This is a great magazine for us with first world taste living in a third world country.
