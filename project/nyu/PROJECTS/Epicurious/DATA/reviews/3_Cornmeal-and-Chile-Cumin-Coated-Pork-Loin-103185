I used this recipe as a last resort to try to cook pork that you didn't need a saw to cut or steel teeth to chew. It was a roaring success, tender juicy pork. Even my wife was impressed with how good it was. I used a cast iron frying pan to brown it and then used the same pan in the oven for 40 minutes. I let it stand longer than 20 minutes and did put it back in the oven at 200 degrees for a short while until the wife got home. Don't know if the additional standing time made a difference but again, it was delicious and so simple,

Meh. It makes a great mid-week, haven't been to the grocery store, but I have some pork and cornmeal kind of recipe... I happened to have a really thick pork chop, so I made the recipe with that. I also cooked it in the skillet instead of baking it. Since the chile was completely absent from the recipe, I added some ground chipotle powder. It was ok, but certainly far from remarkable. I served it with brown rice and wilted spinach.

This was good but it needed something. It was a bit dull. It would be good with some sort of salsa or possibly a BBQ sauce, of some sorts. It was extremely easy to make, if you are in a hurry to get dinner done.

Why is this called "Chile" pork loin?

Maybe is it my inexpert cooking, the flavors were good but simple. The pork was dry. Solutions could include: use a better cut of pork, roasting the pork for a shorter time period, covering the pork loosely with foil while baking, cooking the pork in the skillet instead of transfering to the oven.

As suggested, I added caraway seeds and the result was very good. Even my little picky daughter liked it. This is one of the best-tasting pork loin recipes I've seen. Will definitely make it again for company.

I've made this many times and it is always a hit. In my case, I grill the pork over indirect heat, usually with mesquite.

this was very simple to prepare. as per other reviews i also added some cayenne, salt, pepper, and a few caraway seeds to the corn meal mixture. i also just left the loin in the ovenproof pan i browned it in..poured off the excess oil..straight to the oven w/ less dishes to clean. went well with mashed potatoes and swiss chard.

I made this dish last night and thought it was very good and simple. I added cayenne, salt and pepper to cornmeal mixture. Made a quick sauce in pan with wine, roasted garlic and herbs while roast was resting. Will make again as a weeknight meal.

I made the recipe with pork loin chops instead of loin. I added a little bit of cayanne and coarse sea salt to the cornmeal coating. The chops were finished in the pan instead of the oven. The chops turned out great with a nice crisp coating.

Good thing the other reviewers noticed that the chili wasn't mentioned in the recipe. I used 1 tsp. and thought it was enough. The pork was so tender. I made sure to let it sit after it was done cooking, for about 20 mins. Was realllly good.

Easy but boring.

I had the cumin seeds and I toasted them crushed them to release their maximum flavor. However, the original recipe does not include any chili powder so I added 1 T chili powder to the cornmeal and cumin.

This recipe was so quick and simple to make, and it tasted delicious. I didn't have the cumin seeds so I just used ground cumin. And I followed the suggestion about tenting the roast with foil when it comes out of the oven - the result was great.

Yes, add half a tablespoon of chili powder to this recipe. Coat the meat with oil to really make the cornmeal stick. Also I just put the S&P in the mixture. My family loves their sauces, so I made a pan sauce for this dish that was pretty good. In the pan you cooked the pork in, deglaze with 1/2 cup of beer. Add 1/2 cup stock, reduce by half. Add a dash of cumin and chili powder, and about a teaspoon of honey and your done.

This has become a staple in our house for special dinners. It's great with roasted sweet potatoes and baked green chiles. A great fall meal.

I thought this dish was a fine weeknight meal. Not terrificly special, but tasty and easy. My boyfriend was more impressed though - he proclaimed it delicious and said it tasted like something he would order in a restaurant. I served it with a tex-mex rice salad w/ diced tomatoes, green chiles, black beans, and corn.

This was wonderful. I didn't have any cumin seeds on hand and it was Christmas day, so I simply toasted some ground cumin in a hot iron frying pan. The chile is a great addition. Being from the Southwest, I probably added more than most people would like. I'll be making this again.

This was very little effort for big results. Since the recipie did not say how much chili to use, I used a pinch. I had no problem with the coating falling off in a non-stick pan...and tenting the loins for ten minutes, before slicing, produced a moist piece of pork with an unusual zip.

I think this is one of the few recipes that I have tried from this site that wasn't overrated. It really is delicious! And easy. I have been searching for a pork loin recipe, and I think that my quest might just be over ... I will make this again and again. Thanks Epicurious!

In reading the recipe from the March Gourmet issue, there is not actually ANY chile powder. The amounts given are perfect, and we added a few caraway seeds as well. Roasted at exactly the amount of time given, to 155°F; it was GREAT.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but when I do I'll add the chile (powder, I assume) that is missing from the ingredients. I'll probably put in a tablespoon with the cornmeal and ground cumin. But now I wonder if just 2 Tbl. is enough cornmeal--maybe that's the amount for the chile. When I get the ingredients right, I'll bet this is a 3.
