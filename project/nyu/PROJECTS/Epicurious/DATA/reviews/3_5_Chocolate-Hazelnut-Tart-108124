I have made this many times and do not understand how anyone could give this less than three stars! I follow the recipe, no modifications, and it always turns out great. It usually takes longer to bake- an hour rather than 30 minutes. To dress it up a bit, I add strawberries to the top or drizzle with chocolate.

As Chocolate Tarts go, this one was incredibly sweet...too chocolatey, if that's possiblem It didn't have any depth of flavor, nor did the crust, shich seemed exceedingly bland. If I make this again, I will decrease the amount of Semi-sweet chocolate in favor of adding some bittersweet and/or cocoa powder. Overall, all my husband and our friends rated it as very one-dimensional. BTW, I'm not a novice cook and I did follow the directions, even reading other reviewers comments.

Totally decadent, and not as hard to make as you might think. I've made it several times now, with consistently wonderful results. If you can't find creme fraiche, substitute sour cream. The taste will be be a little different, but no one will complain. I top the tart with chopped hazelnuts and chocolate chips, and serve with a chocolate shot glass filled with frangelico. It is OMG good.

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving and wow! What a beautiful presentation. I love the crust. Everything was lovely!

Not only is this delicious and fairly simple to prepare, it freezes well. The only change I made was suggested by others; Frangelico in place of vanilla.

Very easy to make, but a little rich after a big meal. Tastes like a candy bar, yummy!

This tart was very easy to make, and gets a lot of complements. I will make this again, but I thought it was too sweet. Next time I will try bittersweet chocolate instead of the semisweet chocolate. I would also like a stronger hazelnut flavor, so I might try Frangelico instead of the vanilla.

Excellent recipe! It was very simple to prepare the evening before, and was easy to transport. We served this as part of a dessert sampler for an extended family Valentine's dinner, and got rave reviews. For anyone interested, the desert sampler we made consisted of the Choloate Caramel Frozen parfaits, a 1/2-inch thin slice of the tart with two sauces: low-fat vanilla custard and raspberry coulis. All the recipes except the berry coulis came from epicurious, and they were easy to prepare the day before. I also have to write about the beautiful dessert presentation my wonderful sister-in-law created. On each dessert plate, she spooned 2T of the vanilla custard off-center, set the parfait into the center of the pool, and then placed the tart slice diagonnally. She then put a dab of the custard on the top of the parfait, added a drop of the coulis and shaped it like a heart. She added more hearts to the vanilla sauce pool, pooled more coulis on the opposite side of the tart (away from the parfait), and added a reverse heart in custard. Three fresh raspberries on the tart, and more raspberries and candied hazelnuts around the perimeter of the plate. Divine! Feel free to E-mail me for the entire menu (I have it in a word doc.)

This is an excellent and easy tart. Not enough hazelnut flavor in the filling, though. Next time I would substitute hazelnut extract for the vanilla and possibly add a tbs or two of Amaretto.

I did like this dessert, I just didn't love it. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was very good and everyone really enjoyed it at my dinner party. I might make this again if I had all the ingredients on hand, and wanted an easy dessert to make.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. Instead of adding vanilla extract, I substitued hazelnut liqueur (I also reduced the amount of sugar a tad bit since the liqueur is sweet). I served it with fresh whipped cream that also had hazelnut liquer added to it. I candied some hazelnuts for a garnish. Very good.

Really good tart. I thought the filling suited the crust well and neither was too sweet. It lasted a week in the fridge just lightly covered. I will make this again as an easy make ahead dessert when having people over on a week night.

I found the opposite to be true. I loved the filling but wasn't wild about the crust. I now make a tart using the walnut crust from a chocolate-strawberry tart recipe on epicurious, and use this filling, and serve it with fresh strawberries. It always receives rave reviews.

I agree with the reviewer from Caracas: excellent crust, but the filling was a bit odd. It had too much tang from the creme fraiche, although the texture was great. I think some hazelnut flavor in the filling would add alot. Maybe substitute Nutella for the creme fraiche? On the plus side, this was easy to make and looked beautiful.

Very nice... I the chocolate part was though, uhm, not outrageous... Next time I bake this dessert I would use this crust and fill it with the Gianduia Mousse recipe (also in epicurious.com).
