This recipe is a good starting point, but it needs what other's have suggested (lime juice) and also a little more kick. Try adding some pasilla or chilis de arbol, ground up. Also, a handful of toasted pepitas ground up with the tomatillos would add some nice texture and depth.

Ho-hum. I agree that lime juice helped, but the flavor didn't do it for me.

This is a great recipe, but with one addition - a little lime or lemon juice is a must. Not much salt is needed, but be sure to add at least a little, as it really brings out the flavor.

Have made many times since recipe came out in 1993. It's chunky with avacados and it's great! I've only served it with tortilla chips but imagine it would work well with other things.

Everyone I serve this to raves about it. It's wonderful with chips, eggs, burritos - almost anything. I used 3 cloves of garlic and almost twice as much clilantro as the recipe calls for, but everyone may not love cilantro and garlic as much as I do. I will definitely make this again and again.
