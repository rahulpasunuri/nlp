Actually, I would have preferred to rate this recipe as a zero. This may be the worst couscous I've ever made; after tasting the dish, I was astonished to read back through the reviews of other epicurians who had tried this recipe. Take my advice and try a different Epicurious recipe such as Saffron Couscous with Fresh Peas and Chives.

This couscous was wonderful. I added tomatoes at the end with the chives, along with chicken broth instead of water. I will make this again in the future when basmati rice is /overdone.

I have prepared this dish for as many as 40 guests! It is always a big hit. I do add a bit more balsamic vinegar and substitute vegetable stock for the water, as I like a bit more flavor. I use vegetable stock as it imparts a nice flavor and my vegetarian guests are able to partake.

Perfectly nice and easy couscous recipe, great when you want something more than just plain couscous or rice.

This is a very good side dish. I have served it with Lamb Chops and a Stuffed Trout. It doesn't overpower your main dish. My only substitution was chicked stock for the water. I will be making this again.
