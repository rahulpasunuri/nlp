Quite disappointed with the flavor of the recipe as written - not nearly enough tang for us. Maybe more goat cheese would have helped. Doctored it with sour cream and horseradish to save the dish.

Fabulous, although while I used smallish potatoes, this served three people. I think you'd want to make more if indeed you wanted to make enough for six.

A great side dish. Went well with the *Filet Mignon with Port Wine Glaze. *Also found on this site.

Great potatoes! A nice balance of bitter and sour flavors - goes well with many different kinds of meat.

these are mashed potatoes like never before!!! I made them for a dinner party and everyone loved them. However, I would add more butter!!!
