Looking to use some red lentils I had lying around, I came upon this recipe. Slightly apprehensive, I must say: this rocked. Way better than I could have hoped for. Only variations: no spinach used and I substituted quinoa for couscous, and frankly, I think it improved it. Possible positive variations: pine nuts, maybe sliced almonds.

This was good! The mint really adds a lot to the dish. I used 1 large kohlrabi and 1 cucumber. Additionally, I added some garam masala and cumin to the dressing, and cooked ~1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger with the lentils. I also added barberries to the couscous, and really liked the sweet tang they added - I think raisins or apples would be good as well. This is a good base recipe that is easy to tweak!

This was good. I also used what I had around -- green lentils instead, pearled barley instead of couscous, shallot instead of green onion, cilantro instead of mint. I mashed up the garlic with salt to help the flavor and parboiled the kohlrabi for just a minute or two.

I was a little disappointed in this, after reading all the great reviews. It was good, but not too exciting. I halved it (and it still made a boatload!). I'll probably add some garam masala to the leftovers, to give it a bit more flavor. It was just okay, for me.

Loved this recipe! I served it without the bed of spinach, with rosemary focaccia and tomato focaccia, and a selection of cheeses. Personally, I found the salad lacked a hint of sweetness to balance the curry flavour, and could probably benefit from the addition of a diced apple next time. Otherwise, this was an excellent and easy weekday dinner.

This is a really good dish, I followed the lentil recipe exactly and used a high quality spicy curry powder.I did use whole grain cous cous for health reasons and it added a nice texture and held up well to the curry. It does make a huge amount of food. A lot of work. I might make just the lentils next time.

Fresh and delicious. Served this to guests, and everyone went back for seconds. Would make this dish again in a heartbeat. Made the following modifications: - Used one small Kohlrabi and 1 large cucumber. - Supplemented Kohlrabi greens with Swiss chard. - Substituted small amount of red onion for green onion. - Substituted champagne vinegar for white wine vinegar. - Omitted bed of spinach, doubled cous cous. - Made 1.5 times the dressing (with a higher vinegar to oil ratio).

Really, really good. I had never eaten kohlrabi before my daughter brought some home yesterday. This was delicious. Simple, healthy.

This was unbelievably good. I supplemented the red lentils with some precooked brown ones, as I had only half the amount of red lentils called for by the recipe. In the future, I'd use only red, as they really absorb the delicious dressing much better. My curry powder was very hot, so I did add a pinch of demerara sugar to the dressing. We thought the heat really complemented the other flavors, so don't be afraid to use spicy curry powder. This does make a lot, but everyone had seconds.

My fiancee and I really liked this dish; it was anything but bland!

Would give this 2-3 forks, but I deviated a bit from the recipe based on what I had on hand (rice vinegar,yellow lentils, quinoa instead of couscous, no mint). I had never used kohlrabi before, and thought it was great this way - very healthy, and even better the next day. As other reviewers said, the flavors are subtle. I recommend using sauteed kale as a base!

We didn't love it. The lentils must have cooked faster than stated, so it was a bit mushy. Also, after reading the other reviews it seems that others would agree it is somewhat bland if you use ordinary curry powder as we did.

Whole Foods had sold out of kohlrabi, so I substituted bok choy and Napa cabbage. The salad was subtle, but flavorful, overall a great accoutrement to a bold entre. Like the above reviewers, I would recommend halving the recipe, and using a good curry powder. I would also recommend adding a splash of lemon juice to the dressing to brighten the flavor.

After seeing this in the magazine I thought I'd give it a try. I halved it because I didnt know how it was going to be. I actually used garam masala instead of curry. I think the taste of this dish greatly relies on the curry powder you use. Hopefully you mix your own for maximum flavor. I found that the lentils cooked a lot faster than stated but otherwise this was a really good recipe. I will post it to my blog, Lori's Lipsmacking Goodness today.

My husband wants me to give this recipe 4 forks. He absolutely loved it and he is not a very adventurous vegetable eater. I really enjoyed it, but it didn't send me over the moon like it did for him. It is just a tad bland for my taste - maybe I needed to use a stronger curry powder. But, it is a great way to use lots of veggies from the garden or CSA box. Kohlrabi doesn't get enough attention - it's a great vegetable.

HALF THE RECIPE!! It really is a lot and I started making it before I read the reviews. So, I have lots of leftovers. But, it's very good and great way to use the CSA kohlrabi. I didn't have red lentils so I used regular / green ones. It tasted good but I would get red ones if I made this again. I'm sure it makes it look more attractive.

Also pleasantly surprised: delicious! Makes a boatload, but keeps well. Used 2 small kolhrabi with total weight of 1.5 lbs which was plenty. Also used israeli couscous for texture contrast and because it was what I had on hand, but would do it again. Definitely a keeper for those pesky vegetarian guests as it made a great side dish for the carnivores.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! I cut the recipe in half as well, and it still made quite a lot. I only used one kohlrabi and that was enough for me. I might try it with a bit more couscous next time, but otherwise it was a really well-balanced and very flavorful dish. Even my 2-year-old daughter liked it!

I've been looking for a recipe that uses kohlrabi after I spotted some at my local farm and have been wanting to try it. My husband and I thought this was a really delicious dish...perfect for a dinner party or buffet as it's a very elegant looking dish on the plate. I halved it as it we were just having it for dinner. Instead of a main course, I think this is probably better as a side. And next time I will dice the kohlrabi smaller as it's a very strong cabbage flavor. But very pretty, tasty dish. I think it would even be delicious without kohlarbi...other veggies like cucumbers could work nicely.
