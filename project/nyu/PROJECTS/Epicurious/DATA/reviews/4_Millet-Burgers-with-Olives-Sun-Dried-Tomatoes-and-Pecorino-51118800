I have had many veggie burgers in my day and usually I have found them to be unimpressive. Well this recipe changes that. This is the best veggie burger I have ever had in my LIFE. I will mention that I substituted black olives for the green ones, used regular capers instead of the caper berries and added some salt. But wow, this was incredible. To add...I did a little research on millet (I've never eaten it before) and it's so healthy! It's packed full of protein, and important nutrients. It's an overlooked grain in the American diet but it shouldn't be! A great substitute for grits as it's actually healthy for you and not corn based (which is not good for you). In summary, this burger will fill you up (it is full of protein, remember) and is as tasty as can be. I will be adding this to my list of standard recipes from now on!
