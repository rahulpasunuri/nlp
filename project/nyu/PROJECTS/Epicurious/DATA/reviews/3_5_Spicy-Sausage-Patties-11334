This is the best sausage recipe I've tried to date. The fresh thyme and fresh garlic make a big difference. The level of spiciness is right for breakfast.

Since I live in Kenya, where tasty breakfast sausage is not available, I was thrilled to find this. Make small variations each time I make this: I use 1 lb beef, 1 lb pork, no extra pork fat. Used rubbed sage and 1T syrup, added 1 t red pepper flakes.

Very good. These are spiced, not spicy patties -- might add red pepper flakes for kick. Also omitted the pork fat; the Asian market's ground pork contains more than enough fat. When fried, there was alot of oil excreted, but it's yummy and economical.

I halved the recipe ( using 1# of regular groud Pork ). We had been buying pork patties, but my husband & I thought they haden't the same quality as previously,so we stopped buying them. After a long time of not having them at all, and trying other recipes - which was like not having them at all! - I searched the Breakfast Menu and there it was. I decided to try this one, divided it into 4 patties and we ate them all ( there are only 2 of us !)EXCELLANT!!!!!!!!
