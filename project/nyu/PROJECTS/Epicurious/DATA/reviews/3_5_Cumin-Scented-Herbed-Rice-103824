Excellent! I use brown long grain brown rice and olive or coconut oil instead of corn oil.

Used basmati rice and the result was both colorful and flavorful even though I only used a bit more than half the called for cilantro. I paired the rice with curried tofu and tomatoes, while my meat eating children had it with oven "fried" chicken.

Sounds wonderful. But, does not "rinsing the rice off, until water runs clear", remove all the added vitamins that the Gov't requires to be added to make the rice "enriched". If you use long grain rice, 2 parts water and 1 part rice, bring it to a boil, and turn down heat to low, with a lid, for 15-20 mins, it won't be sticky.

I did not care for this at all. Used a bit more cumin per other's reviews, and otherwise stuck to the recipe. I really like each ingredient on it's own, but to me this just didn't work. Would not make it again.

I thought this was good and I'd make it again. I served it with plain salmon and it worked well--I think it would go with a variety of main dishes.

Wonderful smoky flavor! (But I LOVE cumin.)

This was a nice change from ordinary rice and cumin seeds, cilantro and green onion are some of my favourite flavours. I ended up just making the rice in the normal ratio of 2:1 (1 cup rice and 2 cups broth) and it turned out just fine - but I like my rice sticky.

OK, so what's wrong with me? Everyone else gave 4 forks. I won't make this again. We did not like the texture differences between the scallions and cilantro and the hot rice. I hardly tasted the cumin but what I tasted, I really liked. This recipe yielded about 3 small portions for us. I'll just keep searching for a cumin-rice dish!

This is my new favorite rice side dish--and notice: no onions or garlic to chop, yet flavorful, even complex. I added corn (frozen last time; grilled next) to turn the corner into a southwestern dish. Ignore the puzzled chef who couldn't overcome the difference in temperatures. Just add the scallions and cilantro to the pot a few minutes before serving and let them warm through. I brought it to a dinner party and it stole the show.

This is absolutely yummy. I served it with Salmon with chili-mango salso (on Epicurious.com). The recipe really makes 2 servings at the most. Substitued chives for the scalions.

Easy and very nice flavor. Next time, I might add some sauted mushrooms.

Excellent, easy, healthy recipe. Every bite was gone. This is one we'll be having again and again.

A definite hit with everyone. I don't know if it is me, but the recipe didn't seem to make enough for 4 servings, 2 at most.

Low fat & easy are NOT two of my favorite recipe descriptions & so I usually avoid trying those as I just want yummy food when I cook...this recipe is an exception. Next time I would increase the cumin seeds (I can't get enough cumin) otherwise it's perfect. Rice is dry till scallions & cilantro are added. Nice change.

I never make the same things twice but since trying this dish opposite the low-fat stuffed poblano peppers (also delicious), I have made this recipe several times. A total turn around from typical tomato-based rice dishes, it's fresh, flavorful and the cumin/cilantro combination is a winner.

Wonderful. Nice variation on plain rice.

This is an absolutely wonderful rice dish. I did not have cumin seeds on hand so I used ground cumin. I imagin it would have been even BETTER with the seeds. I will make this often. I think next time I will try it with brown rice.
