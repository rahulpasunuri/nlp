Very simple to make. Virtually no prep required. In an effort to make this a little healthier, I used Chicken Sausage and went without the Cream (Added some Pesto in its place).

This is a terrific recipe. I used all sweet sausage, fresh basil, spinach and peas and let the sauce simmer for 2 hours to let the flavors blend. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream. Yummy, I will make again.

Very good. This will be in the monthly rotation for a quick week night supper. My kids don't like super spicy so I left out the crushed red pepper but used some hot sausage w/ majority (80% sweet).

I was very impressed. I used a mix of sweet and hot sausage and simmered the sauce quite a bit longer to develop the flavors. I also added a bit more onion and garlic. It was very, very good. Restaurant quality!!

Super easy and delicious. I use hot sausage rather than sweet because I like the added heat, and I up the red pepper, as many have suggested. If I have time, I simmer the sauce without the cream for a couple of hours and then add the cream at the very end.

This truly is a quick,easy and very tasty dish. My thanks for the helpful suggestions from others.I tried this with sweet & spicy chicken sausage - delicious. I added peppers, mushrooms, peas, roasted garlic and increased the red pepper flakes since I like a little more heat.Didn't have pecorino so I grated in fresh mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano.It was a big hit.

Pretty darn good after one try, though I found the leftovers surprisingly bland and not as good as when fresh -- the opposite of what usually happens with Italian food! I supplemented with some extra red pepper and that helped a lot. May also try with hot sausage next time and/or cut down a bit on the cream. But overall very easy and worthy, regardless.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! I make the sauce and meat portion ahead of times so the flavors can blend. depending on how much liquid I have in the sauce determines how long I cook the pasta. I like it saucy so that my undercooked pasta finishes cooking when I add it to the meat mixture, absorbs the excess liquid and is more flavorful. Freezes well too.

Rating: 4
We make this recipe quite often-- it is a tasty staple! We change up what veggies we add in (sometimes peas, broccoli, etc. in addition to mushrooms), use turkey sausage, and put only the smallest splash of cream or half-and-half. The pecorino is a must... it binds everything together so well.

Perfect middle of the week go-to. I like to switch it up with some dried tarragon instead of basil as the pairing goes quite well with sausage....Both ways a winner.

My boyfriend and I made this recipe for dinner, and it was incredible. The proportions for the ingredients were spot on. The sauce was flavorful, just spicy enough and slightly sweet. We did, however, add a little flour near the end to thicken it. Needless to say, there were no leftovers...!

Been making this for years and it's a go-to favorite. My biggest change is that having made it with standard sweet Italian sausage (pork) I actually found that the chicken sweet Italian sausage is much better in flavor and made for a less oily dish so it's the only way I make it now. The best chicken Ital sausage I've found is New Seasons.

Rating: 4
For as easy as this dish is it is exceptional! I just returned from a semester abroad in Italy and this is actually very similar to some of the neighborhood trattorias that I went to. Simple, flavorful, and delicious! If you are cramped for time you could skip the basil (However, its one of my favorite parts). One thing I think helps is if you get some crushed tomatoes that has the added Italian herbs in it to add that extra flavor! All in all and wonderful dish that will be made over and over again!

I made this recipe and at first didn't like the color of the sauce. It was absolutely delicious however and was so easy to make. I would probably use half the amount of pasta as I like my pasta with more sauce. I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe pretty much dead on-a little extra sausage (more than a pound in the package) and extra red pepper flakes as we like spicy food. When the sauce was finished and I tasted it to check seasoning my immediate thought was "grown-up spaghetti-o's!!!" It was very good, and I can see why it has such wide appeal. I'll probably make it with rotini next time, to hold the sauce better.

A very delicious and easy dish, I will often make this for last minute dinner guests. I never have fresh basil and it is still great without. Definitely recommend.

mmmm so tasty and easy. I used the sweet italian sausage from trader joes which is precooked so you have to slice it rather than crumble it but still very good. The pepper adds some nice spice and the basil and cheese take the flavor up to something fancier than your average pasta. You'll look like a pro with minimal effort!

Rating: 3
This is quintessential comfort food: a lot like what youd expect from a good neighborhood Italian restaurant. The best thing about this is how easy it is to make, this is definitely one of the quickest pasta recipes I've tried. Id add a bit more garlic next time to up the flavour, and maybe a bit of tomato paste. Definitely one to add to the rotation!

I made this last night for friends coming over for a casual dinner. It was perfect, fast and easy to prepare. Great results that belie the ease in preparation. Made as written except used ziti.

This is one of my go-to recipes for many years now. It is always a crowd pleaser and a good option for an impromptu dinner for four-six. It looks very pretty when served, especially with the fresh basil. I make it as directed. I have tried it with spicy sausage as well, but think the sweet sausage/red pepper is a more successful dish. I love this dish because I can rush to the grocery store to grab cream, sausage, basil, romaine and lemons and have everything else I need in my pantry. The shopping and the cooking take an hour all together! Thank you epicurious!

This was the perfect cozy comfort food I was craving tonight. I used sweet chicken sausage and added extra red pepper and garlic.

I used this recipe because of the ingredients I had available but really wanted to use fennel. I only used a 1/2 lb. of sweet sausage which did not have fennel so I added 1 1/4 tsp. fresh ground fennel seed. I also added 1 1/4 tsp. dried crushed red pepper. It does not need 1/2 cup of cream, 1/3 cup is easily enough! I also used fresh parsley instead of basil. It's a personal preference, the parsley balances the flavor of the fennel I added better than basil would. I used Orecchiette which is my all time favorite pasta.

Rating: 4
I rarely give 4 forks, but this recipe really deserves 4, if only for it's exceptional ease! I had both hot and mild sausage to use up, so I used both of those and left out the red pepper. Also left out olive oil; most sausage has plenty of fat - no need to add more. I sauteed the meat, then drained it. Added the onion & garlic for a about 1 min. I used half and half instead of cream since I really don't need the extra calories! Garnished with fresh basil. I resisted the urge to add other seasonings; glad I did because I couldn't believe how flavorful this was with just the sausage! My husband raved and raved. Will be a go-to meal from now on!

I also used 2 chipotle peppers instead of red...because i like it spicy and smoky!

This recipe is fantastic for a mid- week, fast, yummy dinner. I don't think that I would make it for company, however. I have made this on many occasions, the first time exactly as written, but I seem to get the best results when I tweak as follows: I use a high-quality lower fat free-range pork sausage flavoured with fennel and white wine. I cut down on the cream a bit, and add tomato paste. It is best with bow-tie / farfalle pasta, but I have made it with all types of short pasta. I'm making it again tonight. Yum.

This was indeed a very simple and quick recipe! It cooked up so nicely and the basil to sprinkle on top of each serving along with the cheese, was exceptional! I also liked that I now know what to do with those cans of crushed tomatoes sitting in my pantry. I will be making this quick pasta recipe again. A few nots about the recipe: * I used rotini pasta made with Kamut since I am trying to eat as little wheat flour as possible. The veggie rotnis made the pasta very colourful and flavourful. * Don't use cheap, sausage - next time I think I will try using chicken or turkey sausage, as the pork was really greasy and had to drain off a significant amount of fat. * This recipe makes a LOT of pasta. Fed two, large men, and me for two days.

A great Sunday meal that my family really enjoyed! It is also so easy to make. I recommend a Pinot Noir as a nice accompaniment. I did deviate from the recipe slightly, as I added five cloves of garlic instead of three, and used cheese and parsley sweet sausage. Even though I enjoyed the meal, I would make the following changes based on my personal taste: 1) Cut the amount of red pepper in half, and 2) toss the basil in with the sauce while it simmers, to let it infuse and soften.

This dish is something that I fell in love with at a local restaurant. I liked it enough to search the net to find the recipe. I'm sure this is it. Except that when I make it at home, it tastes so much better. That may have to do with the fact that I know I don't have to get dressed up to eat it, or it might be because I do use hot sausage instead of sweet (we like it hot). Whether you like it sweet or hot, this recipe rocks! This is now a staple in our house. Sadly, I now have one less restaurant that we go to.

I have been making this dish since it first appeared in BA many years ago. It is always requested when the kids visit for dinner.

This was much better than I expected. For a quick dinner it is great and inexpensive even with the best imported ingredients. I followed the recipe and advice, using 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage with penne pasta. I added the basil with the tomato and cream. Other than those minor modifications I was true to the recipe. Very, very rich. I used the pasta water for leftovers only. Next time I plan to use chicken Italian sausage and FF half and half. A good imported Pecorino is key.

This was such a simple recipe, I doubted it could be very good. I was wrong....one of the best "quick" recipes I've tried and should be followed exactly. You must use the fresh basil...it elevates the dish from good to addictive!

Hummm....This looks very (very!) much like a recipe I used to do that was on this site several years ago, and for some reason disappeared! So glad to see it is back. In the meantime I've been using the Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage, also on this site.

This dish is so good that I invited people over for dinner a week after I first tried it so I could have an excuse to make it again! I used Trader Joe's chicken Sicilian sausages because they didn't have sweet Itallian, and added a bit of sugar to make up for their lack of sweetness. This is a fabulous recipe to serve a large group of people, especially if you don't want to spend a lot of time or money. When we came home at 2am after a night on the town, I passed around forks and everyone ate the leftovers straight from the pan!

I've made this about 10 times now because it has become my husband's favorite pasta dish. I like it better with half and half instead of heavy cream and I probably add more basil than called for. It's really fast, easy and delicious.

I would definitely make this again! I think next time I'll drain the sausage drippings before adding the tomatoes and cream in (I used 1/2 and 1/2). At first I didn't think the sauce would come out well but after it cooked down a bit, thickened, and was seasoned with salt and pepper, it was delish. Easy, yummy...one to keep on file.

I'm surprised about all the rave reviews. I made this (following the recipe except used turkey italian sausage) and I found it pretty bland.

First time, followed the recipe exactly, and it was a big hit. Second time, we added mushrooms and made fresh pasta, and it was an even bigger hit. This is easy, tasty, hearty, and totally worth the minimal effort.

I loved this, it was so simple to make, yet so tasty. I made it last week, and my husband ate all the leftovers in the following couple of days. Now he is begging me to make it again, which I am tonight!

This is a slight variation of a recipe from 2000, Fettuccine with Creamy Tomatoe and Sausage sauce, which I've made many times.

This was so easy and so good. I used Chicken Sausage to try and make it a bit healthier, and it was great. I didn't like the raw basil on top, I think it is just there for presentation, it did nothing for the taste of the dish. This is a keeper!

This recipe was extremely easy to make. We liked it, but it wasn't anything amazing - just nice, hearty comfort food. We'd make it again for an easy weeknight meal.

This was the best! From the rich and creamy sauce to the bite of the hot and spicy sausage and everything in between, this dish is one I will not change. It's perfect the way it is.

I needed a recipe that would fulfill many needs at once: 1. simple and quick to serve to a crowd; 2. inexpensive; 3. delicious for adults; 4. palatable to picky children; 5. no fish, no red meat. With the substitution of turkey italian sausage for regular, this dish fit the bill. The adults loved it (and asked for the recipe), the children gobbled it down (although I left off the "icky" green basil for the pickiest). I'll make this again, many times, but I think next time I'll saute the onion and garlic first, then add the sausage. I doubled the recipe, and there really wasn't room in my pot for the onions/garlic to saute properly.

A great weeknight meal! I did not, and would not, change a thing.

This was great. Tasted really good and I prepared it while the pasta was cooking. The first time I made it, I used rotelli insead of the bow ties. I subbed 1/2-1/2 for the heavy cream. Delicious both times.

My hubby said it tasted like a restaurant dish. Even my picky eater enjoyed this dish. I lightened (just a bit!) by not using oil to cook the sausage and substituting half and half for the whipping cream.

Easy and delicious! I drained the sausage after browning, used diced (canned tomatoes)for 1/2 of the called for tomatoes and cayenne instead of pepper flakes.

Absolutely delicious! I added orange bell pepper, peas and mushrooms. I also used a bit less pasta (pappardelle) so there was more sauce. Will make this again (but use more basil the next time), it was wonderful for company on a very cold evening.

Not astounding, but way better than average for the minimal work required. One note...the grated, fresh romano is an absolute must. Don't substitute canned parmesan unless you've no choice

My husband made this for our family tonight. He said it was so simple. I thought it was so delicous and would have him make this again and again! He used rigatoni and said basil was way too expensive right now (February) so he used canned tomatoes with basil.

DELICIOUS! This recipe is perfect, definitely a keeper. So easy and inexpensive. I will definitely make it again, without any changes. I made this for my boyfriend and he went back for seconds, then thirds. If you're looking for a quick, satisfying and impressive meal to make for Valentine's Day, try this recipe. Perfect for any occasion.

This is just one of those recipes that is too good to pass up! It couldn't be easier, more delicious, or inexpensive! We looked like we hadn't eaten for days! Used Publix sweet Italian Sausage and left in chunky pieces...almost like tiny meatballs. Served with salad and crusty bread. OINK, OINK!!

I recognized this recipe right away as almost the same as one of my favorites from a 1990 issue (as also noted by a previous reviewer) and I was excited to be reminded about making it again. The previous version used sage instead of basil which was also excellent and different. My family has always loved this recipe.

I found this to be so light and tasty. I only used 3/4 lb. of pasta. Since I was reheating it during the week, I wanted to be sure I had enough sauce. Being such a light pasta dish, it will be great in the summer especially when I have fresh garden basil!

Rating: 3
YUM! Quick and so easy. My husband can be hard to please, but he pronounced it "delicious", cleaned the plate and went back for seconds. Then he asked for the recipe so he can make it if I'm out of town (THAT was a first). My picky 11-year-old loved it too. I followed the recipe exactly but would like to try a combination of hot and sweet sausage next time. A really great winter dish that would be perfect for a ski trip. Don't skip the fresh basil!

This pasta dish was fabulous, quick and easy, and required very few ingredients. I didn't have any fresh basil, so I put some dried basil into the sauce while it was heating. I also add more garlic than was called for in the original recipe. This also reheats nicely for lunch the following day. Yum.

This recipe is delicious but needs a little more garlic. I would definitly make this again.

Yumm! And so fast & easy. I made this tonight, and before I could ask for an opinion, my husband said this is a keeper recipe. I followed the recipe and don't feel the need to change anything. The crushed red pepper adds a nice kick, and the onions give a nice crunch. Seems like adding peas, as a previous reviewer did, could be tasty. I used bulk sweet/mild Italian pork sausage from Whole Foods Market, and I highly recommend that if you have this store near you, as their store-made sausage is really tasty.

Rating: 3
Terrific, easy recipe with solid flavours - perfect for a cold winter weeknight. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer who simply used hot Italian sausage. I skipped the basil and didn't miss it, but I would use more garlic next time. Otherwise, the recipe is great as written.

This was such an easy recipe. It will now be in the week night recipe box. I added a generous handful of peas to the dish just to give it a little more color. I also used 1 hot sausage link and 2 sweet links. This was a great way to get a kick of heat.

This was a big hit at our house last night and took less than 30 mins from start to finish (eat your heart out Rachael Ray). In my opinion, it makes too much sauce for 1 lb of farfalle, but that's more a personal preference than a flaw.

I really liked this. My grocery store sells sweet italian sausage in a big lump (similar to ground beef) so there weren't any casings to remove. The sauce was delicious and the basil and romano cheese was a great way to top it. Fast, cheap, easy and I can't wait for lunch, since I have a giant container waiting for me in the office fridge.

Agree with others - this is a simple and delicious meal; couldn't have been faster. Used hot italian sausage (so omitted the extra crushed pepper); fresh basil and cheeses (used both romano and parmesan) are key here. Also added some klamata olives as a garnish - great punch of flavor. This absolutely becomes a regular in our house!
