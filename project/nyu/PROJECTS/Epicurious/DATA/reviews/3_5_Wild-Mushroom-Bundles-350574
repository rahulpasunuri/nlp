It's a good thing I tested a couple in wrap before I made them all. the chard/collard greens (one of each) really overwhelmed the mushrooms. I ended up searching for alternatives and made some mini-quiches that were okay and a good way to use the already prepared mushrooms.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2011 and although one friend commented "collard greens with turkey), he instantly became a fan. I made one change, I used shitaki mushrooms with baby bellas because that is what they had. I also had trouble with the collard greens tearing so make sure you don't cook it for too long. I misread the directions and cooked it for the full 8 and it was probably good at 6. Really wonderful flavor and I will make this again.

We don't have chard or collard greens up here - so I used savoy cabbage (I'm Polish and always use savoy - which has a more delicate flavour - instead of regular cabbage when I make cabbage rolls)... and the results were fantastic! The combination of onions, mushrooms (I added morels and some dried cepes which gave the mushroom mixture a more earthy flavour) in the savoy packets was perfect... and a great hit at my Canadian Thanksgiving dinner! Even my mum, who critiques everything put in front of her, raved about these and never uttered a single negative comment... that's high praise indeed! As my husband said, "make these everytime she comes, it keeps her quiet!" This recipe is a keeper!

I was looking for something special to serve for a new Year's Eve buffet and I found this recipe. What a find! I read all the comments and decided to try some variations. After tasting the basic mushroom recipe, I thought it was a little bland so for depth I added some fresh thyme from my garden (dried will do as well) about a tsp (half that for dry) and a couple of shakes of Tony Chachere's which adds a little heat and a little salt. That was my basic recipe. I experimented with the greens and discovered it doesn't really matter what you use, they are all good. So get a big strong leaf, it makes assembly much easier. Even cabbage is fine for flavor, but a dark green makes a better presentation. Whatever you use, take out any big ribs, they just get in the way. I got together with my friend, a fellow foodie who is having the party, and we taste tested the following variations with and without lemon or lime. We took notes, this is what we discovered. No citrus, It kills the earthy richness of the mushrooms. The basic recipe with the thyme and Tony's was extraordinary; velvety and complex, the mushrooms really took center stage. Cheese was good but heavy. We tried goat cheese, Boursin and greyere. My friend is also a cheese fiend and I was expecting her to prefer one of these, but after tasting all of the variations, cheese was not on her list of favorites. Anchovies: anchovies and mushrooms, a great combo on pizzas and salads, very, very good, a winner until we tasted: Smoke: a couple of tablespoons of Tabasco chipotle and a couple of drops of Liquid Smoke. Wow! Just enough heat and it tastes like it came right off the grill. So we will be serving my version of the basic recipe and the smoke. I'm going to be busy for a couple of days. Try your own variations and post them. This is such a great party dish.

That "something missing" may be goat cheese. I put some in with the mushrooms before wrapping it all up, and it was delicious! Haven't tried the recipe without it, since I am a cheese-fiend. I also went easy on the butter.

I also used chard, because our grocery didn't have collards tonight, and the taste was fine. Collards might have added a nice bitter zing. To make it more of a meal, I added some cooked brown rice to the bundles. I also squeezed some lime juice on the top while serving, which made a world of difference to my pallet. And as others have said, less is more with the butter.

This little packet of goodness was my favorite thing on this year's Thanksgiving plate. I prepared exactly as directed and would have loved to have twice as many. I used chantrelles, oysters, and cremini.

This dish definitely looks elegant and impressive, but personally I felt it lacked depth. I LOVE mushrooms too. I did cut down on the butter some, which could likely be the reason why we didn't love them. But even with all the butter, I think it's still missing something. Perhaps paring the mushrooms with something that would give the dish more of a bite would help.

These are fantastic. i made them last year for Thanksgiving and it will be one of the few I do again this year.

I served this at a clients Christmas Party last year. The presentation was just perfect. I always prepare a little more then the recipe calls for and in this case it was for a group of 30 people. The flavor was outstanding and many of the guest had grown up with collard greens and thought that these were so sweet. My client raved and everyone was happy. Also used the Sweet potato recipe in the same edition and that was a big hit as well. This is a keeper.

Thought these were inventive and delicious...cook more collard leaves than the recipe calls for, as they are delicate once cooked and you'll need extras for those that tear. I sliced the mushrooms (not too thinly -- maybe 1/4 to 1/2 inch?) and found the texture just right. Agreed w/other reviewer -- just barely enough mushrooms for 8 wrappers...and this recipe only serves eight if you allow one "bundle" per person. Double it so that each person can have two each if you plan on serving it to 8 people.

i made this also last night, i thought they were excellent. used crimini, oyster and a hen of the woods mushrooms, one pound was just barely enough mushrooms. the collard greens were a little slippery to deal with, but overall, this was an excellent recipe.

I made this last night, using green chard instead of collard greens. The smell and flavor were delicious, but they were a little hard to handle (maybe collards would have stood up better to the task of wrapper, but I had the chard on hand). I used three types of mushrooms and the instructions to chop them into wedges weren't helpful--how big are the pieces supposed to be?
