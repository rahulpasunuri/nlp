I made this for a friend when I was visiting her in Paris as a Thank-You for my stay, and OH MY GOD she and her roommate LOVED IT!!! I didn't follow the recipe to a T, but I threw in couscous and some meat and some tomato sauce and as many spices in their apt as I could find. I actually had to microwave the zuccini because they didn't have an oven and it STILL turned out great!! This is a total no-fail recipe. Bon appetit!!!
