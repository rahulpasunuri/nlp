Its a keeper. I just used broth as I didn't have ribs and omitted zucchini. There are many ways to alter this recipe but the basic is very good,

This was pretty good. I substituted the puff pastry for some phyllo dough that I had laying around and well, I definitely don't recommend that you do that. The Phyllo didn't hold up at all with the liquid, and my husband got a chunk of the soggy stuff stuck in his esophagus for a good half hour. That pretty much soured him to the dish.

Took much longer than I expected but generally worked fine. I added some thyme as I didn't feel the recipe had enough herb (just bay-leaves). Very deep beef flavour.

I used half crimini mushrooms, half shitakes. Also, since I'm a college student, I used the cheapest beef I could find and subbed out some of the beef broth for red wine. It was great!

Would like to rate this recipe, but have not tried it. I was looking for a short rib recipe and this popped up. Although short ribs are cheap, I guess you can discard them when using tenderloin. I actually may try this for my Dad as he loves meat pies.

Loved this recipe - used only 900ml of beef broth with 650ml of tomato sauce and one beer, left out tomato paste. Substituted one head of broccoli and one small head of cauliflower for the zucchini and chopped mushrooms, and added 2 heads of crushed garlic, and some Worcestershire Sauce. Used only beef tenderloin - did not have ribs - so the meat cooked throughout and was incredibly tender. Used Phyllo for topping - delicious and beautiful.

I cooked the carrots in baby formula to soften them. Delicious! It adds a unique taste to this dish.

Much too bland, even after adding tabasco, nutmeg and thyme. The pastry crust remained soft and sticky on the inside, not good at all. Won't make it again.

Excellent dish.... I added roasted garlic to the stock with the vegetables - yum!

Haven't tried the recipe yet, but wondered if anyone has tried substituting other vegetables for the zucchini & tomatoes, and if so how it turned out.

Good flavor. I used portobello mushrooms and sauteed them for additional flavor. I think this same recipe would be good to use with chicken or turkey as well, using chicken broth.

Wonderful dish! I served this to my Gourmet Club group at a dinner recently and everyone raved. I used low sodium beef broth so I had no trouble with the gravey being overly salty. Though a lenghty recipe, it's quite simple to make and the puff pastry makes the crust effortless.

These were a big hit with my husband and kids. I suspect the cook who had a problem with them being too salty perhaps didn't notice that Campbell's canned beef stock is double strength and has to be diluted. We are crust-lovers and will line the bowls with extra pastry next time.

This was great! I will make this again. It was worth the time to make the beef stock. I had no problems with it being salty at all. Next time though I will get extra puff pastry and alittle bit bigger pot pie dishes and line them with the extra pastry.

This recipe is well worth the effort. The homemade stock makes the pot pies exceptional, so I would hesitate to substitute canned. This is an easy (but somewhat time consuming) recipe. I've made this several times, and added other vegetables that I've happened to have on hand. With some warm bread, it's a hearty winter meal.

Delicious! Homemade stock is worth the effort -- but could easily substitute best-quality canned or concentrate to save a lot of time. My guests were most impressed. Will definitely make again.(PS/Didn't have a problem with saltiness that the other cook had.)

This is fabulous - rich and decadent. The trouble of making your own stock is well worth it - it gives the finished dish such a hearty, meaty flavor. I used more veggies than called for, but otherwise, it's perfect!
