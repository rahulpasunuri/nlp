SORRY 2ND NOTE: I'm noting that people used butterscotch chips...I used Werthers chewy caramels about 9 of them, and I had no issues of the mixture sticking to the bottom

I used a corningware pot with excellent results. I used an extra apple with the caramel Also added Himalayan crystal salt to the apple carmel mix, just before putting the cake batter in, with amazing results, for those of you who like salty caramel. Found that it was undercooked at 30mins, and could have been in another 10-15. Delicious! I'd make it again.

I made the recipe as written. It was easy and smelled great. Unfortunately, the butterscotch apple mixture burnt in the oven creating a sticky mess. That said, I will make this again because the cake was easy to make and very yummy. It has the texture of a coffee cake. Next time I will: 1. Double the amount of apple in the cake. 2. Cook the cake without the apples on the bottom (top) 3. When the cake comes out of the oven, I will serve it with the cinnamon apples caramel mixture and some vanilla bean ice cream.

I sauteed the apples with 1 TBL butter in the pan I baked the cake in. Then I set aside the apples, melted 2 more TBL butter, layered brown sugar, then apples, and 1/2 cup chips scattered on top of the apples. Batter on top of apples, baked 375 for 30 min. This was rich without being overpowering. We had it with buttermilk ice cream, but I think vanilla would be best.

This was very good with the following modifications: no butterscotch chips; just apples, sugar and a few tablespoons of butter and for the cake, the addition of 2 tablespoons armagnac and some graham flour mixed in with the regular flour and no apple pieces but instead, a handful of toasted walnuts. Excellent with vanilla ice cream.

Very sweet, think it would be better made with a tart more tart apple such as Bramley

I honestly thought this cake was a little bland, apart from the strong sour cream flavor of the cake base. The butterscotch mixture was too sticky and not flavorful enough. It was well received by my guests, though, and it goes very well with vanilla ice cream.

This was disappointing in taste. At least I was warned by many of the other reviewers. It came out of the pan easily and looked great, but the cake had too strong of a sour cream flavor, and you could't taste the butterscotch in the apple part.

I made this cake for the Christmas holidays, and it was a huge hit! Some people said it was the best cake they had ever had. I served it warm with some vanilla ice cream & a blackberry "port" that a friend had made & it was scrumptious! It reminded me of a very simple comfort-foody early Americana-type dessert. I will definitely make this again!

Definitely yummy but the cake was somewhat denser than I anticipated. Even so, it was a really great treat hot out of the oven and drizzled with heavy cream, straight up not whipped...yumm.

Did not enjoy. cake was way too dry and had a slightly salty taste. Half had to be thrown away, no one wanted any more after they tasted it. Definitely would NOT make again.

I can't wait to make this cake again. Mine turned out just like the picture. It was warm, gooey and the cake was moist. My guests raved about it probably more than any other cake I've made. I used a cast iron skillet to make this recipe and I wonder if that made a difference in my results.

This is an easy recipe and tastes good, but is nothing like the photo in the magazine. The butterscotch was absorbed in the cake and there was no syrup to add flavor and moisture. I don't think this is any more interesting or delicious than a very ordinary pineapple upside down cake.

I loved this cake and the family was very happy with it. We do a lot of chocolate desserts and this was a nice change. So very easy I would say the hardest part is trying to get concentric circles out of the sauted apples. Warm room temp. whatever it was good and my cake was very fluffy and light although rich in flavor, yummy.

The sour cream cake itself was excellent (very tender), but the butterscotch apples on top were too sweet. Next time I might forget the apples and just bake the cake. Yum!

Delicious! Easy to make, too. I was worried about inverting the cake, but it didn't stick to my pan at all.

I made this in a cast iron skillet. I added cinnamon to the cake but kept everything else the same. It was delicious and was very pretty. I will make this again because it's a good alternative to apple pie or apple crisp. It was quick and easy to make too. It is better served warm with vanilla ice cream.

My family loved this recipe! I agree with some of the other reviewers--it was not as hard as it looks. I didn't saute the apples, just lay them in the melted carmel mixture and added the cake batter to the top. I used apples from our tree--who knows what variety they are. I also substituted vanilla non-fat yogurt for the sour cream (less calories, and I didn't have enough vanilla anyway) and added more chopped apple (I had chopped more than 3/4 c.) It was delicious.

Delish! The cake was really light, the apples had great flavor - all in all, wonderful! Definitely needs vanilla ice cream, though.

I'm not a baker and this cake makes me want to bake again. Store was out of butterscotch morsels so I used cinnamon instead and it was delicious. Don't let the long directions fool you -- it's fairly simple to make.

Made this as a dessert for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I made the batter earlier in the day and kept it in the frig until I was ready to add it to the pan to bake. It turned out great...would definitely make again.

I made this because I had everything on hand. What a pleasant surprise! It was the best new dessert I have tried in a while. I served it warm with Bluebell Homemade vanilla ice cream. I would also probably add more apple to cover the bottom of the pan as one reviewer mentioned. Also, I did not use a non-stick pan, just regular stainless and it turned out perfectly.

This cake was delicious! It bubbled out of the pan a bit, but I didn't even care once I tasted it. It was still good heated up the next day. Next time I might add some more apples.

I made this recipe for company. I stuck with the recipe as is however next time I would add a touch of cinnamon, double the apples and add a few small pieces of pecans. It was quite tasty and really MUST be served warm. I would also try Apple Strawberry.

excellent! Everyone loved this cake! A word of caution.....place skillet on a cookie sheet or lined oven rack, as my gooey top bubbled over!

The sour cream gives it a light consistency with plenty of sweetness from the carmelized apples.

i made this once not happy so made it again. to the cake batter i added cinnamon and ommited the sour cream the cake was alot lighter and tastier. as far as the bottom i melted the butter, butterscotch chips, and the brown sugar in the microwave a minute and then stirred well. then poured mixture onto the bottom of the pan and added apples poured batter on top.i was much happier with the outcome of this.

...Also, I'd compare the cake to the dense texture of poundcake. If you're looking for something gooey, this is not what you're looking for. And to the person who asked-- it can be made in a cast iron skillet successfully.

Very delicious! I followed the recipe to the tee (as I always do when baking) and it was a definite success. I took it to a potluck, however I would not suggest this to be the best "potluck dish". It would have been much better served right out of the oven with french vanilla ice cream! I love the butterscotch- a very comforting flavor!

I made this over the weekend, served with Breyer's vanilla ice cream. Got rave reviews from my whole family. Make sure you have enough sliced apples to cover the entire bottom of the pan.

I have made this twice. Both times in a cast iron skillet and both times it was gooey and terrific. The secret is to serve it warm not room temp or cold. This has become a favorite for company because you can make the caramel ahead of time and just keep it in the skillet with the apples and you can make the cake batter ahead of time and either just keep it room temp for an hour or so or pop it in the fridge. I have even put the batter on the top and left it for an hour before it went in the oven.

The recipe was straightforward to make and good - but not great. The sour cream taste came through well, but it wasn't as rich and gooey as I'd hoped. With so many fantastic dessert recipes to try, I probably won't make again.

Does anyone know if this could be made in a cast-iron skillet?

This cake was nice and tasty enough, and it looked pretty, but it wasn't nearly as gooey or rich as I was expecting. Really the only part that had a good caramely taste was around the edges; the rest was just... cake. However, I served it a couple of hours after it came out of the oven, so that may have hurt the gooey factor. The people who I served it to said they liked it, but I'll probably look for a caramelier and richer cake recipe in the future.
