I made these cookies with my little sister around Christmas and everyone said they were the best cookies they ever had. We couldn't find the Crystallized ginger at the time and they were still very good. I look forward to making them again with the crystallized ginger.

This is a must keep recipe. I have made these yummy cookies several times. To add an extra kick, add a bit more Candied Ginger.

I too used regular molasses and 1 cup of dark brown sugar. The cookies turned out dark but the taste was still fantastic. My husband & I loved them...they are an "adult gingerbread" and much easier to make. This recipe is definately a keeper and will be put into my christmas rotation.

They didn't blow our minds, but the fresh ginger was delightful. We used normal molasses and rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar instead of granulated sugar. We did an experiment, and discovered that maximum crinkleage can be achieved by flattening the cookies slightly and cooling the baking sheets between batches.

This is fantastic! I used 1/4 teaspoon of all spice instead of cloves. I used normal brown sugar for the whole cup, and regular molasses (only kind at the store). It's a gross color of yellow-brown when you are rolling them, but they turned out great! I'm taking them to a cookie exchange tomorrow to have something different for everyone.

I made them as written except that the molasses was regular, not light. I used a small ice cream scoop that measured 1T and rolled them in sanding sugar. They did not crack as in the picture so I kept baking and they were a little crisper than I had hoped. Also, the ginger flavor was overpowered by the molasses. Had some dough left over so I refrigerated it. Today I made the rest using the same method and they came out exactly as pictured. Also, the ginger flavor had come out and they were more spicy. It's possible that, had I had cookies left over from the first day, they might have become spicier after a day or two, but a double batch disappeared in record time.

These are SO good. My husband and I love Trader Joe's triple ginger cookies and these are just as good! A pot of French press and a warm batch of these...delicious!

Yum! I used blackstrap molasses, since that's all I could find. No other substitutions. Pretty easy to make, and very tasty.

These are amazing! I love molasses crinkles and these are even better. Adapts well to healthy substitutions: whole wheat pastry flour substituted for the white flour, coconut crystals for the light brown sugar, & roll in xylitol instead of white sugar.

These are amazing! I made these for my boyfriend who loves the triple ginger cookies from Trader Joe's. His response when he tried them was, 'this is Christmas'! I followed the recipe exactly except used regular molasses as there wasn't any light at the grocery store and rolled the cookies in raw sugar. They were a little crispy and chewy, which is a perfect combination. It made about 50 cookies for me.

Delicious and addictive. As an impatient baker, I put all the ingredients into the food processor at the same time and they turned out great. I also added chopped slivered almonds to the coating sugar for a nice crunch.

Just want to add one thing. The first time I made this, I think I used 4 oz or 4.5 oz of flour per cup (did not mark it down). I made them again last night and used 5 oz/cup (so total 12.5 oz) and they came out like the picture and were much easier to roll. Just FYI for those who prefer to weigh. I wrote it down this time so I remember next time!

I love these cookies! I was looking for a ginger cookie recipe that did not contain shortening (trans fat--ew!), and the dough didn't have to chill. It was quite sticky but not too sticky to roll w/o chilling. The flavor is great! I used raw sugar for rolling them in and will do that again, but maybe only the top half of the cookie. I don't think they need to cook as long as the recipe says--watch them. I made mine bigger and baked them for the suggested time. I froze half the batch and they hold up well. I only have a few left so I need to make more soon.

Simply delicious! I used light brown sugar (no dark) and dark molasses (no light!). Was out of ground cloves, so I substituted Jamacian Allspice. Rolled in raw sugar until I ran out then switched to granulated white sugar. Those rolled in the raw sugar were lovely and tasted better, too. Nom Nom Nom - love these cookies!

Love these cookies. I make them bigger and used minced ginger in the jar as I hate grating my own. Also added some of the crystallized ginger in with the rolling sugar. Baked for 12 minutes as I like them to be a little gooey. Great cookie to share as everyone loves them.

Rating: 4
Soooo awesome. The store only had one type of molasses which was pitch black, so I'm assuming it wasn't the light kind specified in the recipe, but other than that I made no alterations. The cookies have crispy edges, soft chewy centers and an amazing flavor. I might add a little bit more crystallized ginger but other than that wouldn't change a thing. 4 forks!!! Can't wait to take them to a christmas party tomorrow.

This is my go-to ginger cookie recipe. I increase both the ground and grated ginger to a tablespoon each. Roll in turbinado sugar, if possible- better presentation. I have a friend who says that these would be her choice if stranded on a desert island...

I just finished making these cookies for a cookie exchange and WOW! They are sooo good. I had to double up the recipe and I did make some changes: I used a combo of whole wheat and white flour; I used salted butter but then just used less table salt; I used 1/2 cup of Organic Sucanat out of the total 2 cups of sugar needed; used dark fancy molasses; used ground ginger instead of fresh; added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of EPICURE Maple Spice. These are the best cookies I have EVER tasted!

I agree with a previous post - the ginger flavour doesn't pop in these cookies. Still, they're really delicious and give a hit of butter, salt and sweet all at once. I'll make them again but will increase the amount of ginger.

These are delicious! I made them for a holiday party and they got rave reviews. Don't overcook them or they get really crispy. They're still good, but I prefer them to be a little chewy.

I haven't made these yet but tried them when someone else made them -- just have to say they were the best cookies I'd ever had. I do really like ginger and if you don't they might not be your cup of tea. But if you're a ginger person you will LOVE them.

With the blue ribbon rating, I expected an exceptionally superb cookie - an all-time favorite. Unsurprisingly, I was disappointed : ( It was a great cookie and perhaps the best ginger cookie I have had: soft and chewy with lots of spices. But even with the three types of ginger, I didn't feel the flavor came through quite strongly enough. However, I will make these again.

Rating: 4
Great cookie! Made exactly as written. Used walnut sized ice cream scoop to measure dough...44 perfect treats. Next time will use raw sugar to enhance presentation as granulated sugar almost disappears. I have searched for a good ginger cookie for a long time. So yummy/

These were a huge hit in my Christmas baskets. All my spicy-food-loving friends raved about them. I refrigerated the dough and used a melon baller to make them - the fastest and easiest cookie in my basket. And delicious. I baked them for 11 minutes. I will make these every year.

I made these a second time (I have a review a few down) but I messed up and used 2 sticks instead of 1 1/2. The cookies came out fine- they spread more and were crispy, but everyone loved them too. If you find you made the same mistake (or want a crispy cookie), bake for 10, instead of 15, minutes.

Great recipe. Zippy ginger flavor and easy to make. I will definitely give these to friends in the cookie tins this year and save this recipe to use again and again.

Intense is the right word. Once word got out at that these are fabulous, they were gone in what seems like an instant. I took them, along with lemon curd cookies and pistachio lace cookies, to several family events and these were invariably the hit of the sweets table - even more than cheesecake in one case! Easy, keep well, freeze well...the perfect cookie!

Very yummy. I used regular molasses since that's what I had on hand. The ginger flavor could be strong- considering how much is in there. Also, the dough was alarmingly soft. I had to refrigerate it for an hour before I could form the balls and bake them. After that, however, they came out perfect- great texture.

I love making and eating these cookies. A tip about crystallized ginger... The bottled variety in the spice aisle cost around $10 / bottle. Go to the Asian food section of your supermarket or an Asian market and buy the Ka-Me crystallized ginger slices. About $1.50 per 2.5 oz box - which approximately equals 1/3 C as called for in the recipe.

Superb! Miles ahead of your typical (even homemade) ginger snap. I made these with petite lemon curd cookies and pistachio orange lace cookies and they were gobbled up by 8 people in 2 days!

I've already reviewed this cookie but this time I threw in some chocolate chips and thought I'd report my result in case someone was thinking of doing it too. Result was meh, not great, not horrible. I hoped it would be better.

This is an awesome recipe: easy and reliable. It is a hit every time, and I have yet to make it and NOT have guests insist on getting the recipe. I replace the white flour with a combination of white-wheat and whole wheat flours; I use Smart Balance instead of butter because my husband is lactose-intolerant; and I use whatever molasses I have in the house, usually dark. The cookies turn out perfect absolutely every time and are always devoured to rave reviews.

No. Flatter than flat.

I tried to follow the recipe as close as i ever do. I had a ton of fresh ginger to use up, so i used probably 4x the fresh ginger called for, but didn't use any powdered ginger. As a result the batter was a bit too liquidy to begin with and so first batch that went in the oven spread too much. I added a few extra tablespoons of flour to the batter and the rest turned out perfect. yum!!!! i will make these again soon.

I was really excited to see a picture of these cookies as they are what I expect a soft ginger cookie to look like. However, these did not crack like the picture and flattened at the end of the baking time and look like ordinary cookies. The flavor is fine, but not a good presentation!

Rating: 4
I made these as part of my holiday cookie baking of 5 different cookies with the theme of spices. These were judged the best by my son. I made them again tonight and added more ginger than called for in all 3 forms, and they are phenomenal. I didn't have the mix of sugars, just used dark, and also regular Grandma's molasses. These are going to be gone before they cool off.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I'm not a baker and I found the recipe very easy to follow. I used agave syrup because I couldn't find mild-flavored molasses. I may try regular molasses next time for a fuller flavor. My batch only yielded 24 - the only disappointment with this recipe. :)

Rating: 3
I agree with the cook from Chicago. Not special holiday cookies. For some reason mine did not "crack" at all and looked very plain. However, I would say the taste was delicious. If you like ginger this recipe is a must. I'll have to play around with it a bit, however, to work on the appearance.

Rating: 1
Sorry to be a wet blanket on all the good reviews, but I was not impressed with these cookies, even though I am a big ginger fan. The finished product looked like ordinary lunch box cookies rather than cookies suitable for a holiday assortment. This could be forgiven if the taste was outstanding, but it was nothing special.I did follow the recipe exactly.

Rating: 4
Simply amazing. I used blackstrap molasses--good if you want a darker cookie and a richer molasses flavor. The first batch I made with soft diced ginger from King Arthur Flour. I had just over 1/3 of a cup left from another baking excursion and added it to the wet ingredients instead of the flour because it was quite sticky. On the second batch I made I upped the fresh ginger to 2 tsps. (will repeat in the future!) and used regular crystallized ginger (and "accidentally" diced more than 1/3 of a cup). Both batches were rolled in demerara sugar, and both came out excellent. I think I like the King Arthur soft diced ginger a little more than the regular crystallized ginger, though.

The cookies are even better after a couple of days, as the flavor mellows! I cut back the butter by one tablespoon to limit spreading a bit, used whole wheat pastry flour because I love the texture it gives most cookies, and used Patak brand ginger paste as a substitute for the fresh peeled ginger. I also prefer to use all dark brown sugar. As suggested by others, and per my personal practice, I used raw sugar crystals for the sanding sugar. The results were exceptionally good.

I made 5 types of cookies for my xmas cookie gift bags this year, with the theme of herbs & spices instead of the usual chocolate (ginger, rosemary, cardamom, cloves, sage). This was the ginger entry, and according to my son the best of the five. Unfortunately I only got to eat half of one cookie that got broken! I will make them again this week so I get to have some too.

These cookies were easy to make and were delicious; the bits of crystallized ginger was particularly nice. Next time, I would reduce the portion size from 15 ml to 10 ml since these cookies spread a lot, and made the cookies too big.

I'm baking these as I write this review - I used all light brown sugar, I didn't have fresh ginger so I doubled the ground ginger (really good quality), and my baking soda is expired, and they're still the best ginger cookie I've ever eaten. The first two batches are harder and darker than they look in the picture after only ten minutes, but they're still chewy in the middle and there's the perfect amount of heat and spice. Absolutely delicious. It's going to be hard to give these away. I also added a little more of the crystalized ginger for a total of 80 grams. Wonderful cookies!

Rating: 4
Excellent. Made these twice and they have replaced our old favorites (Ginger Molasses Cookies, BA 1996). First time I chilled the dough for an hour prior to baking as in the Ginger Molasses recipe; these cookies hardly spread and were therefore puffy and soft. Second time I followed the directions and baked them immediately. They spread, crisped, and we preferred them. Try them either way, but definitely use the raw sugar suggestion from another reviewer. Enjoy!

The after-taste was way too bitter! My guess is that it's from the fresh ginger (and possibly ginger juice that came from the grating). I had to throw them out. It's too bad... Otherwise, the texture & other flavors turned out very nicely.

If you like ginger cookies, these are fantastic. Unlike rock-hard ginger snaps, these are moist and chewy. Instead of rolling in regular sugar, I rolled the cookies in turbinado (raw) sugar. I also found that 15 minutes was too long for the cooking time; for my oven I only needed to bake them 9 minutes.
