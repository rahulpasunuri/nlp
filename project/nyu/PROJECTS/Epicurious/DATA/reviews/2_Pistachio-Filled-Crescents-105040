These are possibly the worst cookies I've ever made or eaten. I thought the dough would be interesting, since it uses oil rather than butter and sits at room temperature. The result was a very elastic dough. When baked, this was not at all appetizing. And the filling was just OK.

I wanted to like these much more than I did. Despite the large amount of sugar, they weren't very sweet and the filling didn't stand out as much as I would have liked. Next time, I'll experiment with some honey and orange zest.

From the Editors: The procedure for this recipe was erroneously switched with the procedure for making a pistachio cake. (See comments below.) It has been corrected.

Clarification please! The title of the recipe states they are filled crescents, yet the instructions are for a 9x13 cake that is cut into squares to serve, with no indication of filling.
