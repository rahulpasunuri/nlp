Very tasty! and FRESH!!! It was all delicious, I used mango as well and only had apple cider vinegar but it was great!!! I didn't use much onion either, it was all proportional!

Nice diversion from the everyday -- interesting food combination. Tasty and good but not great....would make again. We followed advice of other reviews and added garlic to the steak before grilling.

The cantaloupe was delicious but would have been better suited to a white meat. If you do decide to make it with the flank steak, perhaps add a little chili.

The relish also goes nicely on pork tenderloin. Made it the first time with a honey dew instead of canteloupe (because that's what I had). Worked beautifully, as the honey dew was very ripe and sweet.

I thought it was great. I prefer my flank stake as is. I also fixed a nice bulger pilaf where I added a little spice.

Reading reviews once again proves to result in another great meal. I also added some garlic and rosemary to the steak which turned out great. I do feel the relish could use some heat, it reminded me of the salsa paired with a past cochinita pibil recipe (mainly heavy on the onions). Ill give the salsa another whirl but next time with some added heat.

A great tasting recipe! I added more seasoning to the flank steak (garlic/rosemary) and another splash of the white balsamic. My 8 year old even ate it up!

My wife and I enjoyed this recipe vey much tonight. The melon made an excellent salsa and was perfect on this great cut of meat. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

The relish is terrible. The flavors are a poor blend and do not add positive flavor to the flank steak. Some guests complained about the melon. Some complained about the mint. Others complained about the onion. Overall, very little can fix this recipe.
