The broth was too thin - maybe adding potatoes and using chicken broth instead of water is a good idea. Also, it was quite spicy - although I might have used too much red pepper since I rarely measure things anymore.

this was all fine and good as the clams and the keilbasa are a nice combination in general, but i was hoping for a bit more substance to the broth. next time, i might try to put in fennel seeds and a bit of white wine, like the other reviewer mentioned. its a good start to something great.

This was very easy to make. I few things I would do differently. Instead of adding in the 6 cups of water, I would add 6 cups of chicken stock to give the broth more depth. Also, I added finely chopped potatoes as well. I also used lime wedges, dried oregano, chopped onion and slicedcabbage and red pepper flakes as condiments. Very tasty

This recipe was outstanding!. Like someone alse had mentioned i also added around a 1/2 lb of cooked shimp, this gave the soup even more body to it. So far eight people 1 being a cook have tried it and they all love it. Look forward to making this again on that cold winter day.

Loved it. Used sea clam juice in lieu of water.

This is an excellent soup-- I have had to make it twice in the past month for Soup Sunday, a tradition my fiancee and I started this winter. I added mushrooms, a can of drained chick peas, a few bay leaves, more garlic, and 2 cups of white wine to dress the soup up a bit. Also, the last time I made it I added 1/2 lb of cooked shrimp to it as well. A note: I do not add the clams directly to the soup to avoid getting gritty sand in the broth. Instead I steam the clams open in a large skillet with about 1/2 cup of water, then strain the liquid in a sieve lined with paper towel, reserving the liquid to add to the soup.

A most delicious soup/stew. My (Polish and Irish) Family loves it. I use Raw kielbasa, to avoid nitrites and other additives, and cokk it just a bit longer. So glad I was recipe surfing!
