AWESOME soup!! Made exactly as directed except used veg stock instead of chicken and had more generous portions of fennel, onion zucchini vs water. Can't believe how flavorful this is considering so few ingredients! Iliked it with the tomato relish and poured into white bowls with the green from the fennel.

Delicious flavorful soup. I'm thinking about trying it again as a cold soup for a hot day. The tomatos are a must. I also added some of my favorite spicy salsa with the tomatoes. A few other adjustments i made: -1 small pad of butter to finish it -fresh oregano to the veggies while they were sauteing -a tablespoon of lemon juice at the end -a cup more broth at the end because it was a little thick -salt and pepper throughout the veggie cooking process

This soup is light. I could taste every ingredient including the broth. It was a great way to get a serving of vegetables with no carbs and very little fat. I didnt make the relish. I used 2 large fennel bulbs and 2 yellow squash. I will definitely make again.

Yum! I love this soup! The only addition I made was adding thinly sliced radishes quick cooked in with the tomato relish. Perfect crunch. **I suggest using more fennel to zucchini ratio. The first time I made it I used two bulbs and two zucchini and it was exceptional. Second time four zucchini and one bulb- total "meh"

Given some of the middling reviews, I was a little bit hesitant to make this. But hey, I had a bulb of fennel and a zucchini languishing in my fridge and had to use them up somehow, so I gave it a shot. I was very pleasantly surprised! Actually, with a couple of modifications, this soup was outstanding. I took another reviewer's advice and squeezed a bit of lemon in at the end to brighten it up, and finished with a tablespoon of butter to give it a bit more richness, skipped the tomato relish (didn't sound appealing to me). Super delicious! Serves two as a main course.

This turned out really well. I actually used cucumber instead of zucchini and added a dollop of spicey mustard at the end.

Good and easy. Unlike the previous reviewer, I think this soup absolutely needs the tomato relish for color and flavor.

Something went terribly wrong with this recipe, and I know exactly where. It was the mess of cooked tomato and oil that went on top of the soup. I just feel like it messed up the texture and flavor of this otherwise nice tasting soup. I am a huge fan of fennel and zucchini and tomato...the colors look pretty together but it does not work together in this soup.

This was a spectacular recipe for a creamy vegetable soup. I made this pretty much as described, but as I am lazy and don't like measuring everything; I just used 2 fennel bulbs, 2 zucchinis, 1 onion and fennel seed. After pureeing it with an immersion blender, I found it lacked a little brightness of flavors. So I just added a tsp or 2 of lemon zest (I keep some around frozen). It seemed to increase the depth of flavor. I also added a cup more of stock to thin the soup. The tomato relish is a nice decorative addition, but, in my opinion, certainly not necessary. My persnickety wife loved it, so I definitely will made this again.

This soup has a great light flavor, perfect for Spring. I love pureed soups because of the creamy consistency, and yet there is no dairy. I just use my stick blender right in the pot. Don't forget the tomato relish - it is so pretty on the soup and tasty too. Also, I made the mistake of browning some of the veggies, and the soup came out darker than it should be.

This was okay, but rather bland. In spite of using two medium sized fennel bulbs. I don´t know why it didn´t have more taste, but I´ve made veggie soups that were much tastier.

My partner hates zucchini, but when I fed him this, he had no clue it was in it! I didn't have any fennel seeds so I used a star anise, which gave it a really yummy taste! It turned thicker then it looks like in the picture. But the it was still so good, and the relish gave a nice salty bite to the savory sweet soup.

This recipe was awesome. Turned out great and super easy to make. I sauteed the tomatoes in italian herb seasoning before adding them to the soup.

This was amazing and super easy! I'll try lemon zest next time like the cook below suggests. I also think bacon could be good in it, but kind of ruins the "low sodium" thing it's got going on otherwise!
