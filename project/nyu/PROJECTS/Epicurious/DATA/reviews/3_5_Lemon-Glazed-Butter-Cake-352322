I've made this cake 5+ times and it's always moist, lemony and sweet. Everyone loves it. It's a good, reliable recipe. The batter converts well into muffins, too, just keep an eye on it whilst in the oven!

the cake came out great next time I will double the recipe though and use a lot less glaze other then that it was exceptional

Friends and family were genuinely sad when they realised they'd finished devouring this cake. Light and lovely. It did need a little longer in the oven though.

Made this wonderful cake for my Aunt's birthday and she absolutely loved it! Everyone raved about it and wanted to know the recipe. In my opinion if you want to have the dish that is the talk of the party this spring and summer make this cake!

This cake didn't wow me. I won't be making it again; instead I'll be looking for a denser, more flavorful cake -- perhaps a lemon pound cake.

Delicious cake! Easy and light (but not inconsequential). Don't understand reviewers who didn't find it lemony enough? I used really ripe Meyer lemons - perhaps that made a difference - and packed the fresh zest into just one tablespoon. No need to poke any holes in the cake, the glaze was perfect and my cake was moist. Yes, finishing with powdered sugar gives a nice presentation.

moist and lemony - great for finishing a summer meal. i added a lot more zest.

I added more sugar to the glaze and agree more zest in the cake would be good. I also used a 9" pan and decreased the cooking time--it turned out fine. We all liked the cake but it did not particularly have that "wow" factor--the lemon icebox cake was a bigger hit at my house.

I made this recipe into madeleines and they were a huge hit. Everyone asked me for the recipe. They were so moist and delicious.

Made this cake for Easter brunch. I only had a 9x2 non-stick round cake pan on hand so I lowered the cooking temp to 325 and it baked for exactly 27 minutes. Everyone loved the cake. I thought it was very good, may increase the zest next time but would not change the glaze. I dusted the cake with powdered sugar before serving for a pretty presentation.

I thought it was easy to make and smelled great. I thought it was a little dry though. May try to poke holes in top to let glaze seep into cake better.

This cake is lovely. I served it after Easter dinner and everyone enjoyed it. My father, who isn't big on cake, even had seconds. I agree that the cake itself isn't very lemony but it doesn't need to be.

Pretty simple to make, and really delicious to eat. Clean, light flavor that doesn't overwhelm. Prep notes: The recipe says it takes only 10 minutes of active prep. It took me about 30 minutes. I'll still cook it again soon, though.

I too went heavy on the zest, and also added more sugar to the glaze as one reviewer recommended. Also, the recipe suggests baking for 35-40 mins--I only baked for 32 and it was perfect. I really liked the flavor and size of this cake--definitely feeds more than 6! I will make again!

I doubled the lemon zest based on reviews and it had a nice mellow lemon flavor. The glaze definitely adds the lemon zing.

I am not much of a baker, but my teenagers are always looking for dessert. This was easy, and absolutely disappeared! I agree with a previous reviewer that this recipe easily feeds 8 (or maybe 6 teenage boys . . .!)

I made this recipe, without modifications, looking for a new dessert in which to use the lemons I had on hand. I normally make the Lemon Pound Cake found on Cook's Illustrated website. While Lemon Pound Cake is good, the icing is a little too lemony. While this Butter Cake was good, it was not the best "lemon cake" I have had. I wish the cake had a more lemony taste. It also had a heavier/denser taste than I expected. Perhaps, it was the addition of the milk? The glace was excellent, though. Was not good enough for me to make again. Think I will stick with Lemon Pound Cake and use the Butter Cake glaze!

This is a simple, rich, cake. I liked the fact that it had a simple glaze and it wasn't huge. The recipe says it serves 6, but they would be huge pieces! Taste the glaze before you add it. I added a little more sugar. Next time I'll increase the lemon zest too.
