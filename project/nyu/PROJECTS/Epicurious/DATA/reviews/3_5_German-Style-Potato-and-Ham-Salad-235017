LOVED this!!! I tweaked the recipe to my personal tastes as I made it but basically stuck to what is listed here. I made double the amount of dressing to pour on top because it didn't seem to be enough at first (it wouldn't have been enough in the end). I also used pancetta instead of ham and cooked that up in the bacon renderings before making the sauce. Asparagus gave a nice contrast to the potatoes and the dijon in the dressing gave it an amazing taste. Will definitely make this again (and again, and again)

This was very good... my family really enjoyed it. It didn't taste the greatest cold so make sure you're serving it to a big crowd. The previous reviewers were right. It's very labour intensive but it's worth it.

Very tasty as written, but it took over an hour of chopping and cooking to put it together. Also, the quantity (think about 3lb of potatoes!) could have fed 20 people. I took it to a party for 8 and only went through 1/3.

This is a great recipe. The addition of blanched asperagus really made it interesting-gave it a little crunch if done correctly. I only made half of the recipe and it made tons. The leftovers were great too. I just warmed them up in the microwave to room temperature and it worked well.

This is a really good potato salad recipe. It is a bit labour intensive but worth it. Next time I will assemble the salad the night before then fry the bacon and make the dressing right before I serve it.
