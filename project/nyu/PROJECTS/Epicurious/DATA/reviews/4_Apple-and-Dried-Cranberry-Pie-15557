This made a great pie, though I must admit I had dried cherries, not cranberries, and I followed the tip to soak them in the brandy first. I also added some walnuts for crunch, and will keep that in. Making it again tomorrow.

This made for a memorable, which was both complex enough for the adults and also sweet and simple enough to please the kids. I left out the brandy (we don't use alcohol) and the vanilla (none on hand), and added a generous pinch of cinnamon for good measure. The one question mark in my mind about this pie concerns the egg yolk glaze. For me, the top of the pie seemed to brown too quickly -- I ended up turning the oven down a little bit because I was afraid of it burning.

This pie has been met with rave reviews the past several times I've made it. I use the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe for the crust as it's my go-to recipe and I can make a nice lattice top with it. I also soak the cranberries in the Brandy as I prepare the rest of the ingredients. Also, I'm a HUGE cinnamon fan - so I add in a dash of cinnamon to the recipe as well.

I am afraid I was dissapointed with this recipe. I substituted whole dates and marshmallows (my husbands favorites)for the cranberries. The pie came out too gummy and sweet. My guests barely touhed it.

I've made this pie many times and never had an unpleasant result. I always follow the recipe exactly. I think it's perfect, just the way it is, and the pie crust recipe makes the lightest, flakiest crust I've ever made. Just an FYI; the dough for the crust should look like marble, with visible tiny chunks of butter showing. The melting butter bits create the flaky texture.

I just made this pie yesterday. But it did not turn out to be the old- fashioned dessert I had hoped for. I skipped the cranberries because my children vetoed them as I was getting ready to add them. Though I proceeded with every other ingredient and step according to the recipe. The egg yolk/cream glaze adds a beatiful golden shine to the crust, but it was still unimpressive, more on the thick side, not light and flaky. Finally the brandy in the filling was a bit overwhelming for my kids' taste. I don't think I had ever added any liqueur to an apple pie filling before. It's quite a flavor twist and in my opinion makes it appropriate mostly for very sophisticated palates.

Excellent. The pie looked pretty not only from the oven with the golden crust, but when served on the plate with the red cranberries and "yellow" apples (and the filling stayed put when sliced). I did use only 1/2 cup of sugar and Calvados for the brandy. There is another Bon Appetit recipe for the same pie on this site with outstanding reviews. This other must be tarter because it uses much less sugar and fewer cranberries. I may try it next time although I am glad I made this one (from Oct. '98) first.

I use epicurious all the time and haven't had a mind to review a recipe even though I've found many very agreeable. THIS pie is a hit! so simple, so satisfying, everyone thinks I'm a whiz baker when it's presented at dinner parties... 'tis perfection... perfect for the holidays

I guess I'm the only one who didn't like this pie. I couldn't find Pippin apples and used Granny Smith instead...perhaps this was the problem. The crust was quite good and I'll use that part of the recipe again.

Good if you want something different than regular apple pie. The second time I made it I used dried cherries instead of cranberries and it was much better.

Best pie I've ever made. The crust was spot on. Lots of raves.

You betcha, this is a keeper. As the others have said, the crust is wonderful -- "short" and flaky, and there's plenty of it for a 2-crust pie. I used craisins and cut the sugar in half. The brandy gives it a nice deep flavor. Usually the Thanksgiving cranberry-apple pie is the last of the desserts to disapper; this year it was the first! Wonderful warm with vanilla ice cream.

This pie was delicious. The crust was wonderful. I have been experimenting with different crusts, and this is the best one I have ever made. Light, flaky and buttery. I did find that it flaked quite a bit at the edges and I had a hard time serving the pie but I'm sure there's a way to remedy that - just don't know what it is. The filling is also wonderful. I really liked the allspice flavor. I added a little cinnamon as well. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream.

I've made this pie a bunch of times and it's always a big hit. I've made it with Splenda and it tastes just as good as with sugar. The crust is awesome. I use this crust recipe exclusively.

I absolutely love this pie recipe!! I have played with the recipe a bit and added my own twists, like using a variety of apples in a single pie, used Mead instead of the brandy etc.] It has always turned out great! I have also created a low carb variation by using splenda instead of sugar and a low carb baking mix instead of flour. It turned out pretty good.

I actually can only comment on the crust. It's the best and I use it for all my pies. It's one of the few recipes which only uses butter. Enjoy

This pie was fabulous! I used cinnamon instead of allspice, and I used Calvados (apple brandy). Also, I used Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) and cut down on the sugar just a little bit. The apples I used were probably either Cortland or Fuji. I had never made my own crust or pie, and both turned out wonderfully. The pie looked like it was taken right from the bakery, and tasted great too. I thoroughly recommend it!

I had given up on making crusts...until this recipe. As everyone said, it was easy and delicious. I substituted fresh cranberries (~1 1/3 cups) for the dried cranberries, increased the sugar to ~1 1/3 cups and added 1T flour. It was wonderful - my husband felt that vanilla ice cream was a necessary companion!

This is my favorite pie recipe. I love cranberries, but prepare this pie without them. I have received wonderful reviews on this pie.

My husband, family, and friends rave over this pie. I have made it many times, it's simple to put together. I use the Spiced Korbel brandy for extra flavor. This pie ALWAYS disappears quickly.

I enjoyed this pie. However, my family wasnt as crazy about the combination of flavours, I think particularly the allspice. The crust was very good.

Rating: 4
This is probably the best crust I have ever made. I use it now for all my tarts. The secret is using the food processor because it keeps the crust from getting tough. I have also used dried cherries and golden raisins. I prefer fresh nutmeg instead of allspice.

I made this pie last Thanksgiving. I am now requested to make this pie for my wife's family gatherings. They find it hard to believe I can make a pie this good. It is a great combination and the cranberries and brandy give it a unique, memorable flavor.

A delicious pie. My first attempt at pastry/pie making and it turned out incredibly well. The combination of flavours is a real winner.

This is my FAVORITE pie! I love the sweet/sour combination. I have always made it with fresh cranberries (they're cheaper, just add a couple extra)but this year I dried my own so I'll try it the "right" way now.

Absolutely great pie recipe. I made it for friends at Thanksgiving and one friend who doesn't like desserts much had 2 pieces. He wanted more to take home!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners at my then girlfriends familys dinners. This year I have been "told" to bring the same pie and I have to make an extra one just for my new wives niece. It's definitely a hit!! Who would've thought I'd have gotten married because of a pie recipe?

excellent combination - note that the cranberries plump up and appear almost fresh (i.e. not dried).
