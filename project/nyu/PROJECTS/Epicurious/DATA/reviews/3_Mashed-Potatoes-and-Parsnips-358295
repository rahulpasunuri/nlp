I enjoyed this recipe. The texture was perfect and I loved the flavor. I added about two tablespoons of chopped parsley and as a result of how finely chopped it was, the whole thing turned a pale green. Worked really well for St. Patties day. I did get complaints from two people that it was too bland, so if your guests like stronger tastes then probably add more salt then suggested in the recipe. For myself, it was perfect.

This was a lovely alternative to plain mashed potatoes. I served this with a recipe for lamb shanks. It was the perfect compliment. The only deviation I made was to skip the cayenne. I definitely will make this again.
