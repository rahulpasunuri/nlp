Wow - there I was, 6:45 and I had no idea what to serve for dinner...noticed a box of cilantro lime rice in the pantry, can of tomato sauce, had a couple of chicken breasts in the freezer, thought "I wonder if I could make some sort of quick Mexican dish out of these" and to Epicurious I went. Popped the chicken breasts in the microwave to defrost for 20 minutes and started cooking the rice while I figured out what I was going to make and found this recipe. Let's talk substitutions: Like I said above, had tomato sauce, not stewed tomatoes. I had no orange juice but I did have apple juice so I said "what the heck" and threw it in there. Luckily I always have chicken broth in the pantry and organic bottled lime juice (and lemon juice for that matter) in the fridge. I had just run out of garlic, but did have garlic powder (kept on adding by 1/2 tsps until it tasted right at 1.5 tsps). I seriously couldn't believe how tasty this dish turned out to be. Bottom line - within 40 minutes, including defrosting the chicken and cooking the rice, I had dinner on the table and everyone ate every last bite. This will now become a staple, and I'm sure it will taste even better with the right ingredients!

I was looking for a recipe with chickens and tomatoes, So easy to make. and delicious to enjoy! instead of pan-frying the chicken I roasted the breasts in the oven. I also substituted oregano for fresh basil. Also I needed to get rid of my fresh tomatoes before they went bad so I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Fresh is healthier anyways!

the chili powder used in this recipe really makes a difference! I used a chili powder bought froma local persian Mkt.So hot my family calls it "MAKE ME LAUGH CHICKEN" a wiiner.

This makes for a great burrito filling, but I would be sure to add 1 or 2 poblanos, and don't forget the brown sugar. Otherwise, this would probably be a bit bland.

I have to say that this recipe is very mediocre. I'm going to stick with my usual easy weeknight Mexican-American meal. For my recipe, see below. It's the most processed meal that I ever eat, but it's delicious. I should say that when you take out the chicken to reduce the sauce, it will look like A LOT of sauce. However, do not make the same mistake I made and reduce the sauce too much, because when you go to put the chicken back in, you'll find that it becomes very dry. I think that it's nice to throw in some corn near the end of the cooking. My recipe: Begin cooking a package of Lipton's Spanish style rice. Preheat oven to 400, and heat oil in large non-stick skillet. Add 1 package ground turkey with 2 or 3 gloves minced garlic and thoroughly chop up as it browns. As it's about halfway browned, add salt, black pepper, corriander, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, red pepper flakes, and fresh lime juice to taste. (It'll seem like a lot of spices) Then add a can of drained diced tomatoes, a can of minced jalepeno chiles, and a can of corn. Layer on tortilas over rice, top with taco sauce and cheese, roll up, and line up in casserole dish. Top with more cheese and cover with tinfoil. Place in a 400 degree oven and cook until the filing is bubbling. Remove foil and brown the edges of the tortillas. Eat.

Very nice - added a whole chopped jalepeno - might take it down to half next time.

Fantastic combination of flavors. I was tempted to leave out the orange juice- so glad I didn't. I mashed the garlic with a mortar and pestle, upped the cumin and used fresh OJ and plain crushed tomatoes. I also mixed it with poached and pulled chicken and put it in a burrito with extra sauce on top. Everyone raved. I am sure that another reviewer's suggestion that the quality and age of your spices is important. Wonderful, easy, and fast to put together.

This is just chicken in spicy ketchup. It works okay as a quesadilla filling (the only reason it even gets one fork), but it is fundamentally boring.

Great recipe! I usually tweak them, but I wouldn't touch this one. It's perfect as written. Make sure you have a high quality chili powder though, as I think that could be the key as to why some folks like it and others do not.

This dish is a puzzler. On it's face and with the previous reviews, its a no brainer. Yet, it could do with a little help. I'll continue to use it and try to "perfect" it for my family. Maybe use a favorite jarred sauce x 2 in place of the canned tomatoes and marinara. Good potential, its just not there yet.

Made this for dinner tonight and served over rice. Liked the sauce a lot, the chicken was ok, but did not like it over rice. May try the casserole idea with leftovers. I think cheese would definitely improve the overall dish and maybe some crunch.

This is one of my favorite standbys. Sometimes I use corn syrup if I have no brown sugar. Make extra and use the leftovers to make a casserole by layering corn tortillas, the chicken and sauce and grated cheese. Deelish!

I was really surprised at how much my guests and I liked this dish! It was relatively painless, and very tasty. The only alterations I made to the recipe were to leave out the brown sugar (I used fresh squeezed orange juice and found the sauce to be sweet enough) and I added some chopped freshly-roasted poblano chiles into the sauce. They added a great flavor, and tied in nicely with another recipe that I got from epicurious (the chile relleno tart - also very tasty and a nice accompanyment to this dish). I would definitely make this dish again, especially for gourmet burritos or just served with rice, as suggested.

This has been a standard in our house for the past year for leftover grilled smoked chicken. This spicy sauce complements the smoky flavor perfectly! Excellent for the crock pot too, for an easy-to-put-together meal. Even my eight-year old asks for it by name.

Wow! Fast, easy, absolutely scrcumptious and low carb - can't get better than that! I added two 10 oz cans of diced tomatoes with lime & cilantro rather than 1 14oz, so ended up with a bit more sauce. I also added a full teaspoon of cumin rather than half, but otherwise stuck strictly to the recipe. Served in bowls over a layer of black beans; put chicken, then sauce and topped with grated cheese. I think it could have used a dollop of sour cream as well, but spouse declined. Definitely a keeper. I'm even thinking of using the sauce combo as a base for my next chili recipe. Try it!

Made with beef, which came out a little bit tough, but people couldn't stop talking about the sauce. Served with Cilantro lime rice, will definitely attempt again with chicken.

Rating: 4
Here is the beauty of this dish....I served it on the first night with rice flavored with cilantro and lime as suggested by another review. The second night I made the most fantastic quesadillas by mixing the remaining chicken (cut into small chunks)with sauteed red onions and shredded monterey jack cheese and filling up flour tortillas. Delicious! Maybe even better than the first night. I will definitely make this again and will probably just use the chicken as a burrito, enchilada or quesadilla filler. It will make those type of dishes even better as I usually just use lightly seasoned chicken.

Rating: 3
This was really good and healthy! The sauce is delicious. I couldn't figure out what to serve it with though. I used brown rice to keep it healthy and it was just ok. I also think adding onions and zuccini might give it more substance. I will defintitely make this again and might use tortillas next time.

This is a delicious, easy meal. I served it with rice as a burrito filling. It was a little bit sweeter than I expected, so I may reduce the brown sugar in the future, but overall so good and so quick!

Mmmm! Delicious. I mixed it with rice, black beans, and corn-- an excellent burrito filling. And I made extra sauce, too, in order to fully coat the rice. Makes excellent leftovers, too!

I've made this several times and each time I'm surprised just how easy and delicious this recipe is. Once I had to substitute a lemon for the lime, it works but I prefer the flavor of the lime. My husband and I like hot, spicy dishes but with our children at the table this is just the right amount of spicyness for them. So, we add peppers or hot sauces to taste. My favorite sauce to add is one made with chile de arbol. I love the flavor chile's flavor and degree of spicyness. I've served this as whole or shredded and agree with other reviewers that this sauce works well for other dishes.

WOW! A fine, family-pleasing dish, and fast -perfect for a weekday dinner. The sauce is terrific. I served this with fresh flour tortillas. You can tear off a chunk of tortilla, fold it, place a piece of chicken (or two) in the fold, add sauce, and MMMMMM....

"Good Eats" - This was a fantastic-fast weeknight supper. I used 1.25 Tbls Chili Powder but at least one Tbls Cumin (love cumin) Since I had only a small can of Tomatoes - I tossed in a cup of Salsa and some Onions and Peppers. Sliced the Chicken in slices. After it was done I poured it over some Nachos and sprinkled Mexican Mix Cheese over the top. Put in oven till cheese melted and served with Basmati Rice - This goes in the Favorites Binder!!

This dish was easy and yummy! I used boned-in chicken thighs instead of boneless chicken breasts. Added chunks of carrots and simmered this for an hour with the lid on. After an hour, I cooked it for about half hour with the lid off to reduce the sauce. It was fantastic!!!

Easy to make. I reduced the amount of chili powder to 1 Tbsp.; may try 1 1/2 Tbsp next time. Great leftovers as a burrito filler!

Rating: 3
This recipe was a find. I'll begin by saying that I used skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and I think they truly suited the dish. I did not have Mexican-spiced stewed tomatoes so I dumped in about 1/2-cup green chilies with the regular tomatoes. I also took the advice of other reviewers and cut back to about 2 teaspoons chili powder, but added one whole chipotle pepper, although another would have given it just the right kick. Because because I used the thighs I cooked until they were done and the sauce was plenty thick enough. Definitely worth a repeat.

I used a 10.5 oz can of Rotel (tomatoes and chili)and doubled the lime juice and it turned out great, though a little more spicy than some may like. I had so much oil left after browning, that I probably could have used 1.5 T instead of the 3 that is called for. Still, a great and easy dish.

Nummies! Nummies! Nummies! There is nothing bland about this dish, it is loaded with flavor and is spicy but not scary unless you just don't care for spicy food. We loved it! Since we are only two people, I made the sauce in the morning and froze half of it for another time. I just had to cook the chicken at supper which I had on the table in 25 minutes. I served this with mexican rice. This is definitely a keeper and will now be in my tried and true recipe file and the sauce is so good that I will be using it with other foods like meatballs, pasta and veal.

This was a really quick and easy recipe - excellent for midweek meals, although my fiance thought it was good enough to serve to guests. I used chicken thighs (skinless), but I would consider using this sauce for pork chops, or even shrimp. I also added a fair amount of fresh cilantro. I didn't shred the chicken, just served with basmati rice.

Great recipe but I felt that 2 tbsp of chili powder was way too much. On my second attempt, I reduced the chili powder to 1/2 tbsp and added 2(mabey start with one and taste before adding more) canned chipotle peppers. Not as spicy as with just chili powder and the peppers gave the sauce a nice smoky flavor.

Rating: 3
Wow..most of family, me included, found this to be VERY HOT and spicy. Quickly before serving I scooped out 3/4's of the sauce and added a small can of stewed tomatoes and 2 huge spoonfuls of sour cream....fantastic! Next time I will just put in 1 tbsp of chilli. Quick and easy, which is great for week nights. I didn't shred the chicken as we had it served on a bed of basmatti rice and fresh baked buns.

Excellent. I would definitely make it again. I took the suggestion of the Cook from Boston and cooked the sauce down alot more - very delicious. I much preferred it mild. I purchased some chipotle chilles as this cook suggested (before adding it to the sauce, I took a bite of the chili and my mouth caught on fire - so I tossed that idea out the window - though it is a good suggestion for people who really like heat to their meals) but did not care for the chillies. Try this recipe, I promise you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 3
Easy and very flavorful. I made a few adjustments that worked well. First- I added chipotle chillies to the sauce for some heat and flavor. Also, after the chicken was cooked through, I removed it from the sauce (per the instructions) and then shredded it. I cooked the sauce WAY down and added the shredded chicken back in. I used it a buritto filling and it was really amazing. This will become a standard in my kitchen.

This was really easy and very tasty. I agree with the previous reviewer who said that it was not spicy, but rather well-spiced. A couple dashes of hot sauce would add a nice kick.

This was GREAT! Husband and I loved it! In fact, my husband hummed as he ate it, that is when I KNOW it is good! I took the suggestions from reviewers and put less chili powder. I put 1 and 1/4 tblspns instead of 2. I also added plenty of cayenne pepper to the puree in the blender. An additional thing I did was add a few pinches of flour at the end to thicken sauce. We filled this delicious dish to flour tortillas with a bit of shredded montery jack cheese. YUM YUM!

This was a good recipe. We used home canned tomatoes and served it on spagetti noodles. Do not put in the hot pepper right away, do it after the dish is cooking so you can put enough in to suit yourself.

This dish was really good. However, I did make some minor adjustments. I used extra hot rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes and regular chicken broth instead of the low salt broth. I, also, used less cumin and chili powder which was added to taste once the sauce was simmering. I served it with mexican rice which was a perfect compliment for the chicken.

Very good chicken dish, and so easy to make. I would actually give it 2.5 forks, but not quite 3. I needed to do some carbo-loading for a race this weekend, so I also made a pound of penne regate and added the chicken and sauce to it. Also added a half cup of black beans and a half cup of frozen corn kernels. Top it off with shreaded cheddar cheese. Yummy! I think next time I would use a tad less chili powder and maybe throw in some hot sauce.

I made enchiladas with this sauce recipe and they were the best! I just made the sauce and reduced it a bit till thick and then bought a rotisserie chicken. I shredded the whole chicken, mixed in a little sauce and then rolled up 8 corn tortillas and then poured the sauce all over and covered with shredded cheddar - they were to die for! It was like a Mexican restaurant. Really, this is the best recipe and I'm changing my review from three forks to four - it's the best!

Loved this! I too would reduce the amount of chili powder though and maybe use a tangy-spice like Durkees or something.

This dish is so easy to make and low fat - I loved it! I think next time, I will bake the chicken in the oven first, just because I think it will be easier and I don't like sautéing. I simmered the chicken in the sauce longer than the 10 minutes it says to - it made the chicken even more tender and shreddy. Then, I shredded the chicken after with two forks and placed back into the sauce. I used to make enchiladas for a dinner party. With some Cheddar cheese melted on top and sour cream on the side, as suggested by the first reviewer (cook from Broughton), it was so delicious! I will definitely make this again.
