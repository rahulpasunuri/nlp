I love coconut so deciding to make this relish was easy. I couldn't find black mustard seeds, so I used yellow mustard seeds. FYI: I suspect the yellow seeds will make the same mess on your stovetop as the black seeds. Once the sesame oil started to heat up...the smell was rather strong and I wondered how the oil would complement the coconut and cilantro. It was delicious. My guests loved it.

This is a delicious relish. I really enjoyed the coriander for both the color and the fresh, clean taste it contributed to the relish. I used ghee and it seemed a little rich to my taste. Perhaps next time I'll use half ghee and half sesame oil. BTW, there are two variations of sesame oil. One is the Asian (toasted) oil that is used primarily for flavoring. The other oil is made from sesame seeds that have not been toasted and therefore is neutral in flavor.

Surely if you're going to substitute oil for ghee you would use 4 tablespoons of, say, sunflower oil. Sesame Oil is a flavouring not a cooking oil and should be used in small amounts.
