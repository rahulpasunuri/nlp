Amazing - Amazing summer salad! I usually make a traditional tomato and cucumber salad with balsamic vinegar but this one is not going into the rotation. Check out my blog for pics! http://randomactsoffood.blogspot.com/

This was a fresh, interesting way to use part of my mountain of cherry tomatoes. My lemons were very tart, next time I would only include the segments from one lemon, and reduce the sugar to 2 teaspoons.

Wasn't sure reading this recipe if this would be too tart, but it turned out to be a great summer treat. The flavors were very bright and interesting and a perfect pairing with grilled fish. Definately a keeper!

A flavor combination I'd never encountered. Fresh and interesting, though I didn't fall in love with this dish.

Delicious and different. My only watchout would be to handle the lemon segments with kid gloves - mine got a bit messy prior to serving. I'll definitely make this again.

When I intially tasted this it was still pretty sour. But by the time I served it, wow!! Terrific. Even better the next day. Next time I will make it the morning before my dinner to give it a chance to marinate a little more. Highly recommend this.

Loved this. I used tomatoes from the farmers market, because mine aren't ready yet. A real keeper. Doing the lemon is easy--just like an orange. Use thick skinned lemons and if you have it, a filleting knife.

I gave it three forks because it is delicious,but I wouldn't elevate it to exceptional. It is a recipe I will definitely add to my favorites. It is very light and very flavorful. To the reviewer who said it takes too long to separate the lemon fruit from the membrane -- BS. Took maybe 2 - 3 minutes. Worth the effort. Add a slight (3 - 4 leaves) amount of basil cut into small strips -- yeah baby. Next time I'm going to try adding some feta or goat cheese. Add a Sauvignon Blanc and serve it on the deck with some good crusty bread -- that's money!

WOW! I usually do not like tomatoes but I went out the next day and bought the ingredients to make it again. I plan to make this often. It is simple and delicious.

Insanely delicious. I love lemons and tomatoes and this is very simple, fresh, delightful salad. Like other reviewers said, it actually makes the tomatoes taste like fruit. It's drawn rave reviews every time I've made it, and is quickly becoming a staple in my arsenal of recipes.

A wonderful summer salad - especially for those August weeks when your tomato plants are producing more tomatoes than you know what to do with!

It was very tasty and light. I served it in butter lettuce cups once and another time I added just a handful of organic garbanzo beans to the dish.

Unexpected and delicious!! Makes the tomatoes taste fruity (as opposed to vegetably).

Fabulous. A must-make for anyone who loves lemons. I did not have enough cherry tomatoes on hand so I filled out the recipe with diced cucumber.

tasty, beautiful, and fresh. pefect side dish with grilled chicken or fish.

Very light and summery. Obviously, if you do not enjoy the tartness of lemons, don't make this. I enjoy the sweetness of the tomotoes in contrast to the lemon flavor.

Love the recipe but carving up the lemon takes too much time. I skip the lemons and use just the tiniest amount of lemon extract to coat the bowl. It's tricky to get right but if you can do it, it still has all the taste but becomes incredibly easy to make as well.

Sorry, San Francisco, I can't agree with you. An intriguing combination of ingredients but the recipe was too tart and I ended up using about 3 times the amount of sugar to counteract it. We forced ourselves to eat about half of the recipe over two days, then ended up throwing the rest out!

Wonderfully light and refreshing. The tomato, lemon, sugar, oil and chives flavors work very well together.
