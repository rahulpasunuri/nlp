As others have said, instructions are a little vague, and some familiarity with Asian cooking is helpful. I've made this several times and it is always loved in this house. Subbed chili de Arbol and lemongrass this most recent try, added ginger and kumquat slices (using up stuff in the fridge.)

Wonderful and tasty but lots of work. Great taste of Vietnamese cuisine. I made it with lemon grass and served it over normal white rice and me and my friends loved it.

I made this soup using lemongrass. It is quite time consuming, but delicious. The directions for this recipe are poorly written and leave room for error. Being familiar with Asian cooking will help minimize disappointment in the finished product.

I was so hoping to like this recipe. It was alot of work and made a total mess of my kitchen, but it was really horrible. I would have given zero stars if that was an option! I love everything Asian and incorporated all the wonderful suggestions in other reviews, but nothing helped. I'm going to stick to pho when I want Vietnamese soup in the future.

Made this tonight for a book club meeting and all 20 people LOVED it!!(doubled the recipe) I did add fresh grated ginger and used chili garlic sauce as a substitute for the fresh red chilis. I also left out the oregano and salt. I used Jasmine rice....There wasn't a drop left. Will certainly make this again and again!

This is ethereal. The pineapple I used wasn't very ripe so for the broth I used 1:1 pineapple juice and water. I chopped up the pineapple and put it in the soup. Definitely amazing.

I just love recipes that combine weird ingredients in delicious ways. If you are in a cooking rut this will jolt your creative juices. This combo will appear again and again. Will use shrimp next time.

Like previous review, did not know when to add herbs. Added them to the broth after adding all the other ingregients which tasted OK. My husband is not keen on spicy food, omitted the red chillies and added chilli garlic sauce to mine after it was served. Definitely will make this again and again.

This recipe was great. The one thing it needed to put it over the top, though, was tamarind. The pineapple sweetness was a bit too much. I boiled and soaked a big chunk of tamarind paste for about half an hour, squeezed out the liquid, tossed the solids and added the liquid to the soup. That made the difference between night and day. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe; lots of layered flavors and warmth from the chiles. I added 12 ounces of homemade, long, asian wheat noodles. The noodles soaked up the liquid, and made this more of a dish, rather than a soup. I also used about 1 1/3 lbs of chicken, substituted prepared lemongrass for lemon verbena. In reference to the fresh herbs (mint, basil, lemongrass) the recipe did not indicate exact directions for use. So, I added lemongrass to the chicken while sauteing. I added sliced mint and basil just prior to serving. I would consider using canned pineapple to cut down on prep time if I make this again.

I did exactly as the recipe said, but I used Kafir leaves instead of basil, added chives and baby bok choy. I also cooked chicken in black sesame oil. This was YUMMY!!!!!

This is absolutely delicious. I didn't have Thai chiles, so instead used jalapenos. I used a few too many, so despite the fact we love spicy, it was too hot! But, it was so delicious that it was hard for us to not eat it. Highly recommend.

Out standing spicy soup. Used lemon grass instead of lemon verbena. Still great!

We really loved this rich flavorful soup. Its healthy and filling. I couldn't find lemon verbena but used lemongrass and it was just fine! Tastes great the next day too!

I love this soup and so does everyone I make it for. I like to put shrimp instead of chicken but both are good. It is spicy but not too much.

Very good! I left out the oregano and added 1/4 C fresh minced ginger. Next time I will try using sweetened pineapple juice (diluted) for the broth as I would have enjoyed a slightly sweeter broth.

I couldn't find Thai Chiles but I find a list of substitutes on the Internet.Substitutes: chile de Arbol OR fresh cayenne pepper OR jalapeno peppers (not as hot) OR Serrano peppers (not as hot)

Honestly, I'm not sure what the raves are for with this one. It's a lot of work for not much wow factor. My husband really like it. I thought it was good but kept thinking I should be adding more ingredients. Particularly something to give it a bit of heat. Anyway, 2 forks from me.

This is a delicious! I did not have lemon verbena but subbed lemongrass and added Kaffir lime leaves (4). I also added chopped fresh ginger with the base and a bit of chicken stock and more than the called for amount of chicken, increasing seasoning as needed. Yum.

I always order this soup at my local vietnamese restaurant. This recipe is a fantastic alternative. Even my husband loves it and he normally would not eat Vietnamese. Very impressive for a dinner party.

WOW. My wife and I just finished making this soup and it is the best soup I have ever made. PERFECT AS IS. I dont recommend changing this recipie at all.

I doubled this recipe for 24 people to serve along with two other soups. I left out the oregano, added some chopped ginger to the garlic/chile, and just dumped the chicken in with the mushrooms, etc. It was very spicy, the crowd LOVED it. All went, there were leftovers on the other soups. Absolutely delicious.

Even the sceptics gave this one a rave! I make similar Asian soups using chicken or veggie stock but found that the pineapple gave this soup an added wow factor. After making and taking it to a women's Culinary Critics group as an appetizer/first course tasting, everyone was smacking their lips after the first spoonful. I used lemongrass instead of the verbena, but overall, the remaining fresh herbs, added at the very last minute, were the key in turning this recipe into "Awesome." I'm making it again this weekend for us to enjoy at home; adding an additional fifth pepper for a little more heat.

Absolutely amazing! Being of Ukrainian descent, very exotic combinations and tastes to me. Like nothing I ever could have imagined. Even better next day. High status in our repertoire. A must try to truly appreciate such a salty-sweet-savoury combination. So easy, so satisfying. You must try this soup.

I had wanted to try this for the longest time, so today was Day D. Very good indeed, everyone complimented me on the different aroma and flavor. Use fresh herbs by all means and enjoy.

DELICIOUS! I followed this recipe to the letter, and I just love it. It took about an hour to bring the whole thing together, but it's worth it. The sweetness of the pineapple and the saltiness of the fish sauce...MMmmmm!!! I am also glad to have something to do with the unexpected bumper crop of lemon verbena I have. If you do this, by all means use fresh herbs, especially the verbena. Just lovely!

this was a great dish.I made it for a group of people and served it with sesame noodles, everyone loved it. I did make some changes such as spinach at the last minute and more garlic.

Yummy! This is wonderful and smells so great...my mom, who makes it on a fairly regualar basis also thinks it does justice to the "authentic" Vietnamese pineapple-chicken soup.

I thought this was only pretty good, with sort of a strange sweet and spicy flavor combo, but everyone I served it to raved about how wonderful it was and wanted seconds. I suggest cutting the pineapple and chicken into smaller pieces than the recipe calls for as the larger pieces don't stay on a spoon very well. Also, the chilis are very hot so if you don't like spicy, maybe only use 2 or 3. All in all this was a unique and flavorful dish and it's very colorful as well.

in response to ktaormina: the bean sprouts go in with the tomatoes and the mushrooms. the herbs go in with the cooked chicken.

I'm sure this will be delicious, but as I'm making it I'm seeing some problems with recipe...like what do you do with the bean sprouts, basil, mint, and oregano??? It like some of the directions got cut off during printing?

Very good soup!!!! It was very tasty and easy to do although as with many asian dishes, the amount of little bowls to wash is big!!!! I am sooo happy I have leftovers!!!! Will definitely use again.

In response to mamadogg: The trimmings are the "peel" from the outside of the pineapple. The core is then cut-up and both are put in the blender to create a "juice". This is then strained. The edible part of the pineapple is cut into small pieces and added during the recipe. Although I have not made this one yet, I plan to soon. It sounds wonderful.

Rating: 0
Guess I need help with preparation. I don't understand what the "trimmings" are that go in the blender. And do we only put 1/4 of pineapple in blender with water and use rest as chunks? Thanks for any help!

The ingredient list above is missing one key ingredient: 1 pineapple (preferably labeled "extra sweet"; about 3 1/2 lb).
