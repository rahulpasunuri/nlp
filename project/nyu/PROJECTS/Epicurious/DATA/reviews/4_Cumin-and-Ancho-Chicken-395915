this is awesome! it's become my new go to cheap quick dinner since I've always got cumin on hand, almost always have corn tortillas (delish without too) and now always stock ancho chili powder. when i have time i marinate, but the spices are like pow, so it's not even critical. tryi it!

My husband will not eat dark meat so I was able to make this using chicken breast. You only need to cut the cooking time in half, but watch carefully so the chicken does not get over done and dry.

This was fantastic! Used spices as written. Substituted cubed chicken breasts for the thighs. Used whole wheat tortillas (burrito sized), pickled red onions in red wine vinegar for four hours. Served with julienned radishes (which were really amazing), chipotle salsa and crumbled queso fresco and regular salad greens. I think they are the best tacos we've ever had!

"Best taco I have ever had" (husband). Followed recipe closely. Used quick pickled onions but turned them into a quick pico de gallo because I didn't have salsa (cut up quick picked onions with fresh tomatoes and cilantro).

I'm not going to give a rating, since rather than following my instincts I used thighs as suggested. I've never cared much for chicken thighs...something about the texture, but I figured I'd try this as written first instead of using breasts, which are my preference. As a result, I found the coating very tasty, but I didn't care for the overall combination with the thighs. Next time I'll use breasts, and maybe a tablespoon of flour in the coating. The topping would also be good if you were turning chicken breasts into burgers; in that event I'd probably make up a lime, cilantro mayonnaise.

This recipe is fast, easy and tasty. Follow the directions exactly. You don't have to use ALL the rub for this recipe. Apply liberally but don't overdo it. Also be sure to use the additional taco toppings: cotija cheese, pickled onions, etc. This is a real winner. I'll make it again.

Made this for a dinner party along with 2 other fillings. This was very easy and really delicious. I don't usually use thighs, but it kept moist and would use them again over breasts.

These were really good! Very easy for how good they are. Looked like it was going to be too much seasoning, but it was just fine when cooked. I did three of the taco recipes at my taco party, and the chicken was the favorite. I used boneless,skinless thighs with my breast-meat-only family and no one knew the difference! Terrific recipe!

too much seasoning!!!! Might try it with about 1/3 the seasoning

Easy and delicious! I marinated the chicken overnight in the spice rub and the flavor was perfect. Served the chicken as tacos with some queso fresco, tomatillo salsa, and quick pickled red onions. Very good!
