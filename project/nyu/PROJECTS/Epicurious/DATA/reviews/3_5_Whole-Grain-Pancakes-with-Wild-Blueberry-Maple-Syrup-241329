Very good, but not great.

Sensational....use fresh berries when you have them.

My husband normally hates pancakes because he finds them bland and boring, but he loved these. We really like the texture the wheat germ adds and the crispy outside. Maybe these pancakes aren't for everyone's taste, but I didn't find any flaws in the recipe as a previous reviewer stated.I didn't feel like taking out my huge griddle so I just used a regular nonstick pan and had no problem with sticking.

Who uses a mix anymore? Terrible recipe... seriously disappointing.

This recipe is seriously flawed--since it has no oil or butter in the batter, these pankcakes stick to the pan, no matter what kind of pan you use, and no matter how much butter you put in the pan. If you don't have a griddle, don't even bother.

I made the batter in a blender and added a banana to it. I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips. For the syrup I used rainier cherries instead of blackberries. It was absolutely fantastic and I will definitely make it again. In the end, there was a hint of banana flavor and the cherries had a very strong maple flavor (and not much cherry flavor), so that the combination of everything went very well. Awesome recipe!

This was ok. The pancakes are a bit dense. The syrup was nice and, keeping in mind how healthy these are supposed to be as compared to the regular white pancakes, they are more then edible :)

i absolutely love this recipe! although i do not have a griddle so there were some challenges getting the same crispy outsides but overall there were only 2 not so crispy pancakes before i figured it out. i also left out 2 tbsp buttermilk and used about 2 tbsp orange juice instead for a little hint of orangey flavor and it was fantastic! it brought out even more flavor in the blueberry syrup. definitely a keeper.

I never rate recipes... but this was delicious. The best whole wheat pancakes I've had. I didn't have a mix, so I substituted white whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and 1 egg. The result was fantastic - fluffy, flavorful. Yum!

To Toronto & Mississauga cooks. Try p-cake mix at the Bulk Barn. They have five grain and buckwheat. Both healthy choices. Our cottage has the added benefit of being surrounded by blueberries.

What the heck is the point of having a recipe if you're using a mix? This is absurd!

I must confess that I didn't make these... my good friend made them over the weekend at her cottage. They were absolutely delicious! Over the span of the long weekend she outdid herself by cooking an outstanding array of recipes. This one was my favourite (well... they are my healthy favourite. The bbq ribs take first prize). I am going to get all of the ingredients and make it again this

These pancakes were great in flavor. They were a bit dry but overall no complaints. They surely are a tasty healthy start to a day.

As often the case, a meagre pantry is the mother of invention. I altered the recipe as follows: 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill Buckwheat Pancake mix plus 1 cup whole wheat flour to which I added 1 teaspoon soda and 1/2 t. baking powder; 1 cup buttermilk plus 1/2 c. sour cream and milk to make 2 cups to which I added 2 large eggs and mixed well. No wheat germ on hand; only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (I find American recipes often overload this spice...). They were both light and delicious - and so much better than the buckwheat mix which my family hated. Exceptionally good in my opinion, really rated 4 forks - but then this result was only inspired by the original recipe. Next time I'll try the Blueberry syrup which other reviewers have raved about. We simply served real maple syrup which we love. A perfect breakfast for a -20 day!

This recipe rocks! We enjoyed it so much that I am planning to make them again this week. I couldn't find Kodiak brand whole grain so I used Bob's Red Mill Buckwheat mix and it was so very good.

My family loved these--I made them two mornings in a row for breakfast. The recipe was very easy..I left out the wheat germ, but they were still delicious. I used Bob's Red Mill 10 Grain Pancake and Waffle Mix--turned out great!

The pancakes were good but no better than other buttermilk recipes I've tried. I like a thinner batter so I added some skimmed milk which helped. The blueberry syrup was excellent and I will definitely make that again. As for the pancakes, I would only make them again if someone requests them.

I want to make these pancakes but I can't find any whole grain pancake mixes. The recipe asks for 2 cups of the mix and in a note says you can substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Has anyone used the whole wheat flour substitution and if so did you use 1 cup of flour?

My husband likes pancakes of all sorts so I asked him to make these. Except for putting in too much buttermilk, he did fine and they turned out just like the picture. Instead of blueberries, he used huckleberries which we had picked last summer. Next time, we will put at least some of the huckleberries into the batter as well as in the syrup. All in all, great flavor and filling also.

At first, I wanted to give this recipe a lower rating. It was disappointed because in the picture, they really looked like something special & different-- but in real life, they just looked like thick, hearty pancakes. I think they either deep fried their pancakes or sprayed them with hairspray to get them looking so shiny & crispy!! I realized after reviewing the recipe that they really were very healthy (except for the butter they are fried in), and considering the fact that there were no eggs or oil, they tasted pretty darn good. I will make them again next time I'm in a healthy mood! Oh, and I only had regular old (non-maple) syrup, but the blueberry concoction was still delicious (and very easy!).

The syrup MAKES this recipe. I loved it and such a positive way to have your kids eat something with some positive nutrition and they think they are having a special treat. Easy to buy some of these ingredients in the bulk section of your grocery store if you want to sample before buying large quantities of pancake mix, wheat germ etc. A definite weekend go to breakfast!

My family loved these pancakes. I couldn't find a complete multi-grain mix, so I added an egg and two T of olive oil. I also used sugar free syrup and fresh blueberries.

I made the blueberry maple syrup to go along with homemade belian waffles and my very particular 8 year old son said: "I don't really like it..." Before I could protest, he added "...I love it! Can you make this syrup everday?!?" Clearly, this syrup recipy is a keeper for us!

These pancakes are as good as they look in the picture. The batter is very THICK and a little hard to work with, but the pancakes taste great - esp. with the syrup. They go great with chicken sausages (we had them for dinner tonight). The recipe made 11 small pancakes for me, so I'd double or triple for a group

I made just the blueberry syup and it was fantastic on our family-recipe sourdough pancakes. I used a high- quality/expensive pure maple syrup as the base but I'm not sure you need it because the blueberry flavor takes over (which is what I was hoping for anyway.) Very easy way to add a special note to breakfast.

My children liked it more than me. They saved the last few for breakfast. tomorrow. Never had left over pancakes. I was expecting more taste since the picture looked so good. I did add 2 TBS to the pancake mixture because I am a sugar girl. I will make this again very easy to make.

The blueberry sauce was great. I found that while making the batter that I needed to use more of the pancake mix than the recipe called for to get the consistency that was required. Also when using good quality maple syrup like that from New England I found that you did not have to reduce for as long.
