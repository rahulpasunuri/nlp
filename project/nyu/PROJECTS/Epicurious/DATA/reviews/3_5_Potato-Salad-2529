This is a tremendously delicious potato salad. I don't mess around with the cucumber etc. or add the crabmeat, and I think it actually tastes better if you combine everything and let it sit (preferably overnight).

As with most recipes, sometimes you have to work with what is on hand. The basic potato salad is very good; I found it a bit heavy on the vinegar (easy enough to adjust). I also added some fresh dill. In the future, I would consider adding some crumbled bacon for a bit of variety. And I can't wait to try it with the cucumber and olives!

I just made the potato salad, not bothering with the olives, cucumbers etc. It was delicious without all those additions. Highly recommended.
