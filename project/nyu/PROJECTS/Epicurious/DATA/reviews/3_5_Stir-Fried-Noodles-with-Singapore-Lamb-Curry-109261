I used brown rice noodles, which may be more absorbent, but I felt that I should have doubled the sauce. I could taste the curry and hot peppers, but little else, so it was a bit bland for my taste. I will definitely make again and double the sauce or at least increase the amount of liquid ingredients.

This dish is awesome, I have made the recipe as is and have changed out meats with turkey, chicken, and shrimp. My family has requested the shrimp version repeatedly.

Made this with tofu instead of the lamb and omitted the coconut milk, and it was still outstanding! This dish is so flavorful and will definitely go into our weeknight repertoire. It really satisfies a craving for spicy, flavorful take-out style food (without the grease or the guilt).

I was very happy to find a recipe that used up the extra pack of thin lamb slices I didn't use up in a recent hot pot recipe. I made a few adjustments because I'm currently trying to go as long as possible without a trip to the grocery store: -used Shaoxing rice wine instead of sherry (and actually in the majority of asian-inspired recipes this is the more common liquid to use; Sherry is an acceptable substitute but the rice wine works really well) -at the recommendation of other reviewers, I added more coconut milk (5 TBS total) -used about 2 TBS chili oil instead of jalapenos -sliced 2 onions instead of bell peppers The flavor was great, and the lamb came out so nice and tender in this recipe. I would definitely make this again, and in fact might do it soon since I now have coconut milk open. I might try it with shrimp!

Best thing ive made from epi of late, and i make a LOT of things! all the same except fresh udon noodles, all red pepper and much more coconut milk (like 2/3 can)  i wanted to use up a leftover bit that was frozen and wanted more sauce. was AMAZING. anyone who says the meat was tough used the wrong cut of lamb or something  was like butter.

3+. When teenage boys go back for thirds, you know it's a hit. A terrific recipe as is, or a great springboard for innovation. Ground lamb works well, as does almost any meat. Throw in snow peas! Increase the sauce! Use green curry paste instead of powder! You won't regret trying it.

Forgot to mention--I use much more coconut milk than specified--most of the can! And use a good quality red curry powder, based on coriander, cumin, cardamom, etc. (I like McCormick's gourmet collection brand).

This has become a regular at our house. I always use tofu instead of lamb as we have some vegetarians in the family--just slice up a 10-oz. package of firm tofu, drain, and cook just as described for the lamb. I use only half the chili and chili sauce as it was too spicy the first time. Served it to my parents; they loved it. My kids don't love it, but they eat it! A very flavorful, easy, and attractive looking dish.

This did not rock my boat. It was bland, and needs way more zip - like fresh lime juice. I'm going to look for a different recipe.

I've stopped using store-bought curry powders because they make most dishes fall flat. They're too bland. But with my own blend of curry spices, handed down from a friend's family, the dish was a gourmet's delight ... spicy, but extremely smooth and velvety on the palate. With a bit of adjustment, the recipe is delicious.

I'm with the PA cook, this did not work for me. I'm a real fan of both epicurious and curry, and unusually, I followed the recipe, but I felt the flavors did not come together, especially with the lamb, and the cooking method led to tough lamb. A big disappointment, especially as I used our freezer lamb, raised by a friend and usually a delightful treat.

Delicious! I used steak instead of lamb but you can really use anything. Next time I'm going to omit the chili garlic sauce or the jalapeno. Both makes this just a little too spicy for me. Other than that, I will be making this again.

I made it more or less like it says - added a bit more ketchup manis than asked for and used powdered coconut milk for the sauce. Used ground pork and ice shrimp for the meat and thin fresh chinese egg noodles. This is a very different mild tasting dry stirfry. Nice for a change from Thai (coconut milk based) or Chinese (soy based) with lots of sauce - which is why I liked it. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. Just keep an open mind with this one that it will be a new "taste sensation" and I think you'll enjoy it.

I visit Singapore often and always miss the noodles bought from street vendors there. Tried this recipe with good results. But instead of the molasses and soy sauce I used ketchup manis which is a sweet thick soy sauce, you can find this at many Asian grocery stores, a good brand is ketchup ABC. And I used thai birds eye chilis instead of jalapeo peppers, much better if you can find them. And like other poster said you can really use ant combination of meat or even tofu in this dish.

I was so looking forward to this dinner. the Udon noodles are wonderful, soft and pillow like in texture. But the sauce was a big disappointment. The dish was too salty...and I used a light soy sauce! I only used 1 jalapeno pepper...and it was just the right amount of heat in combination to the chili garlic sauce. I only used a 1/4 teaspoon of light molasses...since I wondered what molasses was doing in an Asian recipe to begin with...and I did not, nor could I find, light molasses. I did add a few shitake mushrooms since I love the texture and flavor. The eating was a disappointmnt. Beubg tii salty, the wonderful flavor of the lamb was lost...the curry flavor was overwhelmed. And who knew that there was any coconut milk?! Since I love the idea of this dish, next time I would add more sherry, less soy sauce and would add the soy sauce at the end and tast to learn if more was needed. Since I like my noodles moist, I would try doubling the liquid in the sauce ingredients.

I could not get udon noodles at the grocery store, so used the thinner chow mein noodles. Worked, but will try to locate the udon next time. Used pork instead of lamb. Added some red curry in addition to the powder. More chili paste & cilantro. My husband kept adding more coconut milk over the top to make it saucier.

This was a very tasty recipe. My parents were my guiny pigs! This was so yummy. Thanks epicurious!

Boy, I'm not sure where we went wrong with this, as we are avid users of Epicurious, and fond of all Asian recipes, but this did not work in our kitchen. Maybe it was the lamb, which was terribly tough. We fixed this before all these reviews came out, and in retrospect, might have tried the pork with success. All I know is we would never fix it again.

While I wouldn't say this dish was beyond compare, it was a very tasty weeknight dinner! I subbed thinly sliced pork tenderloin for the lamb, and decreased the oil to <1 Tbs, both of which worked nicely. My curry powder is VERY spicy (Penzey's Hot Oriental Curry) and might have been too much for this dish, with the jalepenos and chili-garlic sauce. Next time I will use mild curry powder or make my own. But I will make it again!

Delicious! I used chicken instead of lamb but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and loved everything about it. I love any kind of noodle dish and this one's a winner.

The other reviewers are right. One could use any type of meat,fowl or none at all. I would have given this 3 forks because I thouht it was delicious,but the rest of the family said beyond compare!! Being out numbered and receiving raves,it earns a 4!!!

I was drawn to this recipe because I had a half a head of Napa cabbage in the refrigerator, and I also had most of the other ingredients on hand, even home-grown jalapeno chiles in the freezer. I looked for an appropriate cut of lamb, but decided to go with pork tenderloin that I also had in the freezer. I adjusted the cooking of the pork accordingly and it worked perfectly. But, like the previous reviewer said, you can really use any thinly sliced cut of meat or poultry, or go completely vegetarian. The stir-fry sauce will become our "house" sauce. It was wonderful. I opened a new can of coconut milk just for the two tablespoons needed, and I'll use the rest of the can tomorrow when I make the Thai Shrimp Curry from the Feb. 2004 issue of BA. Don't leave the coconut milk out. It definitely comes through. All-in-all, this was a terrific stir-fry, and I'll make it again and again.

MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT. THIS DISH HAS FANTASTIC FLAVORS. THE LAMB SLICE, WHICH WAS HARD TO FIND, NEITHER ADDED OR SUBTRACTED FROM THIS DISH. I AM GOING TO GO MEATLESS OR TRY IT WITH BONELESS CHICKEN THIGHS OR SHRIMP NEXT TIME. I USED INSTANT COCONUT POWDER,AVAILABLE AT SOME CHINESE MARKETS.THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL IF YOU ONLY NEED A FEW TABLESPOONS IN A RECEIPE. THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE TELL YOU HOW TO RECONSTITUTE IT TO THE CONSTINENCY THAT YOU NEED
