Very tasty and, at Thanksgiving, a welcome change from the cloying sweetness of the traditional sides. A couple of tweeks: I used Delicata squash because its skin is edible and because it's easier to cut up than acorn squash. For 3 Delicata squash (which was more than ample for 7 people), I had to double the parsley mixture. My food processor didn't do a stellar job of mincing the orange rind strips, though that didn't seem to matter in the end product. Nonetheless, I'd recommend grating the orange rind. (If doubling the recipe, you'd want about the grated rind of half an orange.) Also, I added about a 1/4 inch of water to the roasting pan before covering with foil. All in all, there's a certain amount of prep involved, but the result is well worth the effort.

The flavour combination was delicious, especially as a counterfoil for Thanksgiving, when the emphasis is heavy on the cloyingly sweet. I used Delicata squash for two reasons: it's far easier to cut than acorn squash, and the skin is edible. Perhaps my food processor isn't sufficiently efficient, but it didn't reduce the orange peel as much as I would have liked. So, I'd recommend grated orange rind instead. Also, I baked the squash in two halves, and waited to cut into pieces until it was cooked. So, what I ended up doing was doubling the filling for 3 Delicata squash (and grating the orange rind, which means about half an orange) - 1 bunch of parsley, 1/2 grated orange rind, 4 garlic cloves, salt & pepper, & a little oil, per the recipe. The only other change I made was to add some water to the roasting pan before covering it with foil. Very easy to prepare, very delicious to eat.

I made some slight modifications. I didn't have an orange, and planned to use a clementine or two but they were too hard to get just the peel off. at that point I was also a little wary from reviews that said the orange and garlic was a strange combo, and since it was essentially just a gremolata, I used lemon instead. I added more garlic, and used butternut squash that I peeled and cubed, then roasted as directed, but only for about 20 mins. I added the squash to a pound of pasta, and juiced the lemon in. It was awesome! I can't wait for the leftovers, will be making this one again.

Several problems with this dish. The squash was pretty tasteless other than the garlic and orange (a kind of funky combination). 1" thick slices didn't cook in the given time and temperature. Not a winner. But...with the leftovers (plenty! No one asked for seconds, including me.) I'll try to salvage it by re-heating and then pureeing with a little butter and cream/milk. That should bring out a bit more of the squash flavor and blend better.

This recipe also works well with slices of sweet potato instead of squash- a nice alternative to sweet potato casseroles that are often overly sweet.

Oh dear. We thought it wasn't possible to mess up a dish with garlic and parsley, but we were wrong. I sort of saved this by adding a little thyme and sprinkling with parmesan, but the combination of garlic-parsley and orange just doesn't work. At least not on squash.

The parsley, orange, garlic mixture wasn't very good at all. I think It would have been better with just the garlic, but the orange and parsley really ruined it for me. My husband especially didn't like the orange. I wouldn't make this again.

This squash was a wonderful change from the usual Thanksgiving Acorn Squash with all the butter and sugar. It will definitely be on our table again.

i made this dish with millet, and it was pronounced, "the best squash dish you have ever made," and we eat a lot of squash!!!
