I subbed blood orange olive oil for the 6 Tbsp. butter in the batter, plus added a smidge of fiori di sicilia along with the vanilla. Kitchen smelled like an orange grove and the cake is just moist and delicious!

This cake was very bitter! The pith on the oranges is overpowering and infuses the orange caramel. All of my guests were pushing the oranges off to the side. The raw oranges (I ate one) did not seem overly bitter, but nice and tart). Just not sure this recipe works. Cake itself was OK, texture was not my favorite (a little grainy) - but I guess that is to be expected with the polenta. I have had better polenta cakes though. It was a lovely dessert!

Reply to pomposha: The cake holds well for 24 hours without refrigeration. It stays very nice and moist, without getting mushy.

Love to cook, not so crazy about baking, which is probably why I don't bake well. But this recipe is exceptional. Easy to produce a gorgeous dessert that looks like it came from a fine patisserie. Outstanding flavor, too. A cake I'm proud to serve or to take as a gift.

This is a winner! It has great Wow! power because it looks beautiful and yet isn't at all hard to make.

Really delicious. I did not have blood oranges, so I used Satsuma mandarins. I drizzled a bit of Cointreau into the caramel and onto the orange slices before adding the batter, about 1 T total. The Cointreau was probably unnecessary, but it tasted lovely, and the cake and topping would have been just fine without the addition.

Simple and delicious. Next time I might double the caramel so I can add more orange slices. Just be sure you have a sharp knife so you can slice your fruit thin!

The presentation was superb and the cake was tasty. My only complaint was that the caramelized oranges didn't have much of the bright tangy orange flavor. So after the cake was done, I squeezed another blood orange over the entire thing, letting the cake sop up the juice. Perfect!

I made this cake right when I received the magazine, so no blood oranges were available yet. I substituted Cara Cara oranges, and it came out delicious. I don't know that Navel Oranges would have a rich enough flavor or color. I also found it delicious with Dulce de Leche sauce! The oranges caramelized beautifully, but should have been sliced thinner for more caramelization/less pith. A keeper!

any thoughts on making this cake gluten-free? i love the idea of the citrus/caramel/polenta combination. do you think i could substitute a gluten-free flour mix in for the all purpose flour? if i try i will let y'all know. thank in advance for your thoughts. looks yummy.

To answer some of the questions below: - I made this cake in the morning and left it at room temperature. I think that it would still be good made 24 hours ahead. I wouldn't regrigerate, just cover with plastic wrap as soon as it has cooled. - I think the biscuit cake would work on the oranges as long as you used the caramel from this recipe. But I would encourage you to try the polenta version. It's really yummy. - other oranges? Yes probably, but keep in mind that blood oranges are less acidic then other types of oranges. I would choose oranges that are very sweet and have thin skins. I might even try lemons but I would double the caramel. Hope this helps!

This is truly a wonderful cake. I sliced the oranges using a mandolin which certainly makes it easier. If the slices are too thick I can see how it would result in a bitter taste. The thin slices are nicely cooked and softened in the caramel, giving just a hint of the bitterness - quite good actually. And the whipped creme fraiche takes it over the top. This is not a very sweet dessert with a little crunch, just right for me and my guests. Baking time, as other reviewers mentioned is definitely closer to 35 minutes.

Would this cake keep well if it were made 24 hours before a dinner party? Does anyone know if it would need to be refrigerated? Thanks.

This was really really good! My cake has only 1 downside... the pith on the oranges I bought was extremely thick and remained a bit too bitter. Next time I might cut around the pith and use the orange peel right in the batter instead.

My #1 favorite dessert here is the similar upside down apple biscuit cake: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Apple-Upside-Down-Biscuit-Cake-103822 Anyone have an opinion on the biscuit as a substitute for the polenta for the orange cake? I'm not in a position to make either for a couple of weeks but look forward to doing some experimenting.

To Susanvd in Europe, the orange peels become candied, soft and delicious.

This looks beautiful and I love reading the great reviews. Question though ~ where I live blood oranges are never available. To those reviewers that have tried the recipe do you think that regular oranges would be a substitute or do you really need the blood orange for maximum flavor?

I wonder if people are supposed to eat the orangepeel. Would it be possible to make this with peeled oranges ?

This was a delicious and easy cake, I will make it again. I probably fussed over the very even orange slices more than I needed to, once they are baked it is all quite forgiving! Agree with previous reviews, mine was also done after 35 mins.

Great balance of flavors. I didn't take the caramel off the heat quite quickly enough, so my caramel was darker. It was delicious, although the dark color made the presentation less perfect than the picture. Served with ice cream.

A beautiful, flavorful cake. Loved the addition of the polenta. My cake was done in about 32 minutes. It was delicious with whipped cream but next time I would use the whipped creme fraiche.

It was a big hit with my friends. I used 3 small eggs and whip cream instead of creme fraiche. A beautiful good tasting cake easy to make. The polenta gives it a crunchy nutty taste and I like that the cake is not too sweet.

An exquisite dessert. Follow this recipe exactly as written and you will not be disappointed. I do suggest you start checking the cake at 35 minutes-I found that 38 minutes gave me a perfectly baked cake. The cake is one of the lightest and best textured I have ever made, and the blood oranges make a beautiful presentation. It would be well worth it to go out of your way to find creme fraiche-it really takes this dessert over the top.

Gorgeous presentation. Tender, buttery cake with nice toothsome texture from the polenta. 3 blood oranges generously covered entire bottom of skillet, unlike in photo. Worked beautifully in cast-iron skillet. Would make a couple of minor adjustments next time. It's ideal to have the fruit completely saturated in the caramel syrup, so I'd increase that slightly-- so that there are no whitish bits of orange rind pith remaining. I would recommend baking this in the lower middle shelf of the oven, as the top browned quickly-- and you really want that heat to concentrate on the bottom of the skillet. Also, my cake was done a full five minutes before suggested baking time.
