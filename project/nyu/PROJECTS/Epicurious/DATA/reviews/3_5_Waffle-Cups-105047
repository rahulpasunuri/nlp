I was skeptical about using powedered milk. This had great flavor and was very easy to work with. Use high quality sorbet for maximum effect.

What a great way to serve individual desserts. I had some doubts about how the pizzellas would mold, but they were surprisingly easy to work with. Careful you don't burn your fingers!
