Super. Great flavor profile. The mint really does it. We used lovely red Fresno peppers (2) in place of the jalapeño, and squirted a little sriracha sauce on the steak. Wow!

Delicious! My husband and I had this for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it. I used chicken instead of steak (marinating it with dressing as suggested by other cooks), which worked well. I added Thai red chili for a little more kick, and took others' advice by adding red bell pepper for a little sweetness and some cilantro.

This was good--meat was very tender--but I thought it was lacking something (even though I added halved grape tomatoes--much needed color). Next time, I think I would add some cilantro & maybe some slivered red onion...

Really wonderful. Great use for leftover steak.

WOW, that's all I can say. It was so delicious and definitely a keeper in my house. The dressing was nice and light but still gave off a lot of flavor, and everything seemed to compliment each other well.

This is a fabulous, quick meal -- a delcious family favorite at my house. I have made it faithfully for years and find it delicious every time. I have made it for company -- always to rave reviews. I am surprised by the reviewers who find the dressing bland -- perhaps the jalepenos available to you are on the mild side and you should up your pepper to a serrano. You can usually smell a jalepeno and know how hot it is going to be. The only thing I do differently to this recipe is toss the cooked, sliced beef in the dressing before adding it to the salad.

This salad got mixed reviews from my family. I thought it was good, but not fantastic... It was a little bland, so I think I'll try it again with extra garlic, jalepenos, and sugar. I might toss in a little dried red pepper, too.

Made this for a pot luck this weekend and it turned out well (and I got compliments) but certainly not a knock-out. I tripled the recipe and had way too many greens for the steak, but making it as a dinner for two I'm sure the proportions are correct. Will make again.

I did not enjoy this. The dressing was too thin and lacked any kick. Not one that I will make again.

I, too, served this in spring roll wrappers. Awesome! Will use the dressing for many recipes: dipping sauce for potstickers, "real" spring rolls & as stated for this salad.

This has become a favorite. We make it at least once a week. I more than doubled the sugar in the dressing. Also have added cooked chow mein noodles (instead of meat), tomatoes, and avacadoes.

So good for a quick spring dinner! I also marinated with the soy/lime/fish sauce for 1 hr with great results. Subbed cilantro for mint (I was mint-less) and will definitely make again. I would guess that this would be excellent with grilled shrimp, as well. YUM!

This would be a nice salad for a hot summer day. I found the dressing to be a little too salty for my taste. I'll watch the amount of soy & fish sauce I use next time.

I followed several reviewers' tips and added some chopped lemongrass to the dressing and served some crushed peanuts on the side. Some Vietnamese spring roll wrappers worked nicely as an alternative way to serve the salad.

Very tasty! I wanted to flesh this out into a more complete meal, so I added 1/4 cup fresh coriander, 1/2 cup fresh bean sprouts, and a sweet red pepper, sliced. I also used mixed baby greens instead of the romaine and doubled the dressing ingredients. That way, I had extra dressing to marinate the steak in for an hour before cooking. This would be great for a casual dinner party on a hot summer day.

This salad is so good. It's light but is very flavorful at the same time. I love steak, and this is a great way to serve it for anyone who likes Asian flavors.

Quick and easy. Added a bit of lime zest to the sauce and a few chopped peanuts for garnish.

Excellent Thai-style steak salad. I suggest adding some chopped lemon grass
