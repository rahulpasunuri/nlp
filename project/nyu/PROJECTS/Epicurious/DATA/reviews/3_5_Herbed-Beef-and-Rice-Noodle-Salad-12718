Excellent! You can use any type of beef steak, you don't even have to marinate w/the sauce, s & p will do because the dressing and herbs make this salad a hit! Boil the hot water, then add the other dressing ingrediants - there is no need for the blender. Just make sure the dressing is room temp before serving. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM

This recipe is in constant rotation in our house. I served to my book club and it was a HIT! One member does not eat meat so I substituted shrimp for the beef. Ive also used pork in the past and people love it. The rice vermicelli can stick together if you're not careful. I drain and run under cold water, return to pot and then toss in some of the sauce right away. If noodles are too hot when you mix the salad, the herbs and greens wilt and then the left-overs aren't as crisp. I once made mistake of slicing beef while it was raw. No problem. I stir fried in a little sesame oil and it was still terrific. This is also a good option for gluten-intolerant people. Most soy sauce is made with wheat but this recipe uses fish sauce.

I've made this several times now - I only roughly follow the recipe and it always turns out delicious. Tonight, since it is 35 degrees celsius (HOT) i made it with leftover flank steak, lots of cilantro, green onions, ice berg lettuce, cuke and lots garnished with chopped cashews. Instead of chile flakes I used a bit of chinese red hot sauce.

Too much fish sauce made it too salty. Also too hot between the garlic and hot pepper.

Am making this for second night in a row (still have more steak left, and my mouth waters just thinking about it.) I added fresh grated ginger to steak marinade (hint: buy fresh ginger root and store in your freezer. grate or slice thinly as needed. keeps forever that way :)

This is a terrific easy recipe. One addition that I thought worked really well: toss in a few chunks of ripe mango. It's a great contrast to the heat of the sauce!

This is one of our favorites. The salad is light and refreshing, the steak is phenomenal and with the exception of marinating the steak, can be prepared in less than 45 minutes. I mix noodles and salad ingredients in a LARGE bowl and then toss with dressing. Made the mistake of using two tablespoons instead of teaspoons of sugar in steak marinade last time I made it and will do so again. It gave steak nice Asian barbecue flavor.

This was very good, I would give it 3 1/2 forks. I cut the recipe in half for 3 people, and didn't have enough of the sauce available for pouring over everything. When I make it again, I'll make more sauce, and ramp up the spiciness. I was short on basil and cilantro and will have more on hand next time. Also, I marinated top round steak overnight instead of flank steak, which would have been better. Despite the shortcomings posed by my substitutions, this was fresh and flavorful fare.

I will definately make this again! I served it in a large Oriental bowl with chopsticks! I thought that the 'sauce' would be boring as a dressing. wrong! I used hot sesame oil in the marindade. The steak was out of this world!

Wow. I am certainly in the minority. The steak was good, but my husband and I did not care for the salad part of the recipe. Other than the crunch of the lettuce it was rather dull tasting to us.

This salad is so wonderfully fresh and flavourful! We make it regularly. I like to leave a little bit of the beef marinade aside to toss the meat in after it has been cooked to dress it a bit. You must make this--you'll instantly feel transported to summertime!

I came home from a weekend at the lake with a lot of leftover steak, and this was a GREAT way to use it!! I'm sure it is even better if you marinate the steak overnight, but it was a big hit at my house with the leftovers.

I made only the sauce recipe for my own version of rice noodle salad which contained blanched yellow squash, grated carrot, scallions, basil and mint. Plus a tiny dribble of peanut and sesame oils. I made only half of the sauce amount, and there was still enough left over to dress some grilled tuna, and another day, grilled salmon. Granted, I was cooking for only two people. The cooking time of 5 min. given for the rice noodles may be too long. I would check them after 2 min., and keep checking. Also, read the package directions. Some rice noodles require no previous soaking. Anyway, it's a wonderful sauce! May need just a little less sugar, add it to taste.

my husband truly enjoys the fresh herbs mixed in with the salad. he especially likes the fact that after you're done eating, you're never left feeling stuffed.

This is so light and tasty I make it for my wife once a month. We find it's really hard to get bored of the subtle flavours and mixed textures.

This dish is delicious and authentic tasting. The only problem is the prep time in the kitchen with cutting the herbs and preparing the rice noodles. It was not worth all the effort, and I won't make this again without another pair of hands in the kitchen.
