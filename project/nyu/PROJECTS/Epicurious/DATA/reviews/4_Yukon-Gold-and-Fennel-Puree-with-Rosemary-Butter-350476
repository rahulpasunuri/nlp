i cooked this for my office Christmas party 2 years ago. Everybody loved it so much they are always asking me to do it over and over again.

Very delicious version of mashed potatoes. Yes, they look a bit "browner" than the photo accompanying the recipe, but they taste great. It's the caramelization that makes them so good, so don't fret over any browned edges on your fennel and onions, unless you're truly averse to taupe-colored potatoes. I wouldn't change a thing, except perhaps a tad more creme fraiche to suit my personal taste.

I've made this dish for Thanksgiving two years in a row. The first year, I had a fennel disaster, with browning of bits of the fennel causing a brown mess and most unappetizing (although the taste was fine). I ended up throwing the fennel puree out and starting over. The second and third times around I was smarter about COVERING the roasting fennel and also watching it more carefully. I also decreased the amount of butter by 1/2 the third time around as who needs all that saturated fat!? I think the wonderful flavor in all of this is the rosemary, which is what my guests especially loved.

Made the fennel puree. Because of tiny bits of browned edges, the puree turned a lovely shade of brown. Not very appetizing although it tastes great. May try again, this time covering the fennel and onion pieces so no browning occurs. Did anyone else experience this problem?

I was so excited to make this based on reviews, but it turned out to be a glutinous mess! It was gloppy and disgusting, and I threw it out. So disappointed.

LOVED this dish. Used sour cream because I didn't have creame fraiche. Made a few hours in advance and added a bit of milk to thin out after reheating. Potatoes were so silky fennel added such a nice flavor.

Amazingly good. I'll never go back to plain old mashed potatoes. Make this!

This dish turned out pretty good. Next time, I wouldn't cook the fennel and onion as long. They turned out too crispy and some of the pieces were burnt. I also would serve immediately after making. I did heat up in microwave, as suggested, and this made the dish too dry. Otherwise, great dish.

Love this recipe. I've made it three times now and I am always craving more. They have a wonderful aroma and taste great. I have never been able to puree the fennel smoothly, but I actually enjoy the texture of the fennel bits.

Excellent recipe. Parts of the fennel got very brown and slightly crispy -- I didn't use those bits in the puree. So I probably ended up with less fennel than the recipe called for -- next time I'd try to keep it from getting so brown, although you do need it to get a little brown in order to develop the sweet flavor. I also used about half of the butter and half of the creme fraiche and it was still very rich.

this won "BEST SIDE" at my family's thanksgiving dinner. Its simple, delicious, sweet and aromatic. I used regular old idaho potatoes as my base and did not fully puree the potatoes for texture. as for those of you who had problems with the brown-ness of the fennel, my only thought is your fennel was over done or that you used to much fennel or not enough potatoes. I was very careful to cut off extra brown spots. I ended up using 2 bulbs of fennel (1 1/3 pounds) because thats all I had on hand. again, a real hit!

So I am in the middle of this recipe. I am curious as to the color of the fennel once it comes through the puree-ing process. Mine has turned a lovely shade of BROWN due to some of the pieces of fennel getting a little brown on the edges. Even when I add the creamy golden potatoes and the cream fraiche, it will not look like the photo, and I may just save the puree for another recipe that hides the color and skip the combination all together. If one needs to roast the fennel until very tender, then maybe it should be covered so it doesn't brown.

We make these every year now. They are so good there are never any leftovers. This year I will double the batch.

Unbelievably delish. The sweetness of the roasted fennel and onion paired beautifully with the creamy potatoes and the rosemary. Definitely a dish for company; maybe the Thanksgiving Table!

Mashed potatoes is probably my favorite food, and this version is at the top. Reducing the butter does not reduce the flavor.

My family and my guests loved it. The first time I only used 1 fennel bulb, the second time 2 bulbs. The comments about the second one were that it was mashed potatoes AND stuffing. Not what i was going for. :) So I will stick with the one bulb.

These potatoes were wonderful! Made as per instructions. I actually made them the night before Thanksgiving and just heated them in microwave prior to serving (but it was so hard not to eat them the night before). Best mashed potato recipe I've had in a long time.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it. It was their favorite dish on the table. A nice upscale twist to a classic dish.

This is very tasty but a lot of work for mashed potatoes.

Very good! The fennel was not at all over powering. I used my convection oven to speed up the roasting time and only used half a stick of butter, rather than the whole stick. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I are vegetarians so I skipped on the meat and served this with a succotash (also from this site) and they were great together. I'll definitely make this one again!

Another keeper of a recipe - everyone loved it! Substituted lowfat greek yogurt for the cream fraiche and used 1/4 cup olive oil & 1/4 cup butter instead of the 1/2 c butter and it came out delicious.

These were wonderful at the family Christmas dinner, all the guests enjoyed them and my sister-in-law was asking for the recipe. My mother didn't have a food processor so I ended up using the blender for the fennel. As others have stated, that doesn't work very well but I succeeded by adding the boiling water from the potatoes bit by bit just enough to get the puree. You just have to be careful not to go overboard and make the puree too thin. The fresh rosemary butter addition is fantastic.

After the paramedics restarted my heart, I was able to hear the praise from my in-laws at Thanksgiving. These are increibly rich and worth every bit of it.

Absolutely fantastic! Nothing I would change, although there are some great ideas in the reviews below. When you're raving about the products of your own cooking at the Thanksgiving table, you know the recipe must be good. :)

Really great recipe. Not a huge fennel fan, but when roasted it was very subtle. Gave it a little extra complexity to ordinary potatoes.

Rating: 4
These were amazing!!! I'm not a huge fennel fan so I was a bit skeptical on the strength of the flavor, but rest assured, the roasted fennel turned amazingly sweet and blended nicely. I used a "sweet" onion, didn't have the creme fraise, so I used a little sour cream and whipping cream and it worked perfectly. I made this with a recipe from a few years back on a cover called Cabernet Braised Short Ribs. I ended up with left-overs so have used now for the top of a yummy Shepherd's Pie - can't beat gourmet leftovers!

This was tasty, but I have to admit, I was disappointed with the amount of fennel flavor. I used nice looking fennel from an up-scale grocery store, but the flavor didn't come through at all. Not sure why. The dish still tasted very good, basically like regular mashed potatoes. The butter, creme fraiche, and rosemary combination is outstanding. I think next time I might add even more creme fraiche. Almost none leftover after Thanksgiving day.

These potatoes are exceptional! I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone at the table was raving about them. I couldn't find creme fraise so I substituted some heavy cream and it was still phenomenal. Will be making these again and again!

Really delicious. Food processor is key. I dusted mine with parmesan cheese and put under the broiler before serving, which gave a nice crisp and perfectly complemented the flavor. One thing I would note is that the texture is def a puree more than a thick, whipped mashed potato...or maybe that was just me. Didn't bother me, I thought the flavor was fantastic, but something to keep in mind if you want potatoes you can build chunnels in for your gravy.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was amazing. All of my family agreed that this was the best mashed potato recipe we've ever had and there's no need for gravy. They are by no means healthy but an amazing treat for a once a year celebration. The only problem I had was pureeing the fennel, I don't have a food processor and tried them in a blender, which didn't work, so eventually I just ended up chopping them.

These were the best potatoes we have ever had. I cooked them for 25 people and by the end of the night everyone wanted the recipe. Smashing hit!! Dirty little secret: I didn't have time to peel lots of potatos (for 25 guests) so I bought the instant yukon gold mashed potatoes and mixed them with the fennel mash. Delicious!!!

I normally have a hard time making potatoes. Not sure why. But these are the best potatoes I have ever had. Lots of flavor. One problem I had was trying to process the fennel and onion. I was too lazy to bring out the processor and tried to use the blender and it all just stuck to the blade and didn't work. I threw it in the potatoes anyway.

We used this recipe to top the Braised Lamb Shank Shepherds Pie ... superb!!! Added some carmelized shallots with a hint of balsamic as well. So good!

Great mashed potatoes - we had them with our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. The rosemary butter was fabulous! I am a butter fan, and definitely did NOT skimp on this ingredeint. Fennel and creme fraiche were also wonderful in this.

These were the best mashed potatoes me and my husband have had. The roasted fennel & onion puree added a rich, slightly caramelized tone to this earthy dish. Used a bit less of the butter than the recipe called and the texture was still perfect.

These were wonderful and I would definitely make them again. We served them with roasted vegetables and roast chicken. They really rounded out the flavors. They hold their own as a flavorful side dish and would be perfect for Thanksgiving.
