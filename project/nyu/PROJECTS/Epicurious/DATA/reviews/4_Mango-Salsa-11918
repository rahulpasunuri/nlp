There is only one thing wrong with this recipe. It makes just enough for two. Luckily I had doubled it, and there were only four of us for dinner. Not a drop left over.

Simple and great. I prepared it for a romantic dinner. Since I refrain from using "raw" onion in such occasions, I steamed it for a couple of minutes in a steamer. It was great anyway.

I made this salsa exactly as stated; fresh mint from a small pot I began growing a few months ago, fresh lime and zest, a mango that was firm and red onion. We loved it - very refeshing. My husband doesn't usually like to mess with "sauces" but he didn't stop talking about what he calls "muckaluck"- in fact he has asked for it again tomorrow night.

pretty easy and tasty. I added a little bit of chili sesame oil which gave it a nice kick.

Easy and delicious. I also did not have mint on hand, but did have cilantro. Tastes great with cilantro!

Simple and delicious. Used it to accompany the grilled jerk chicken on this site. Couldn't find fresh mint and used half the suggested amount of dried mint instead, and doubled the lime juice...

Very tasty! I added more lime juice than the recipe called for.

This is my standard mango salsa recipe. I really like it on spiced pork tenderloins. I think it would go nicely with any meat that has a spicy coating.

Excellent salsa to go with grilled swordfish. A snap to prepare. Like a previous reviewer, I added red pepper for color and a little more crunch.

So easy and delicious! Definitely a keeper. We served it with spicy jerk chicken and a black bean and rice salad and it was absolutely perfect.

I also made this to go with the Glazed Grilled Salmon on this site substituting cilantro for the mint and adding a little minced fresh jalapena. Perhaps this makes it a different recipe, but it sure was good!

This salsa is incredible!! It goes great with pork or a frim white fish, and it can go with pound cake or ice cream for dessert. It is light and delicious. You can some fresh cilantro if desired.

We love this salsa! We use it with pork, chicken and fish. It is easy, quick and really jazzes up plain pork, fish and chicken.

Light and summery. I used this on Glazed Grilled Salmon (from the epicurious files) and made another batch later in the week to top crabcakes. A splash of olive oil added earthy flavor and rounded out the lime. I also added finely diced red peppers for color.
