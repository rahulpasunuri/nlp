We loved it! Vegetables stewed separately are excellent. Me and my bfriend changed the dish a bit. We simmered cubes of chicken breast and added them to the ratatuille before the baking. We baked it in a glass pan covered with 4 oz f goat cheese. Our ingredients for ratatuille are 2 eggplants, 2 yellow squash, 2 green bell peppers, 1 red bell pepper and 2 chicken breasts. We didn't have pine nuts so we used pesto spread from the store as a salad dressing and skipped tomatoes.

This is a delicious variation on ratatouille that preserves the individual flavors of the vegetables. It's worth a little time to saute the veg separately so that each has the right tenderness. I skipped the vinaigrette in favor of our usual and substituted feta since goat cheese is unpopular in our house. Our dinner guest raved.

Loved this recipe, made it for a small dinner party and it was a hit. We replaced squash with sweet potato and therefore had to add some cooking time. The goat cheese was a great element, probably my favourite, and I would not skimp on it. We didn't make individual dishes, but tossed it all into a baking dish and added layers of goat cheese within.

I think this recipe was made harder than it needed to be. I made the following changes and loved it. Vinaigrette: Used prepared pesto (because I had some) and added the vinegar- turned out OK, but may have been better with fresh. Ratatouille: used regular eggplant, no green pepper, added zucchini, yellow onion and crushed tomatoes that I had put up last year (my tomatoes haven't ripened yet this year). Instead cooking everything separately and moving it out of the pan, I started with the onion and garlic till soft, then added eggplant, then peppers, squash and zucchini. Instead of pureeing the tomatoes I left them crushed and stirred them in with the fresh herbs at the end. Assembly: I did one big one instead of the individual dishes. I used a glass dish (circa 8 in) and layered ratatouille and goat cheese, ending with cheese. Next time I would add a layer of polenta, but didn't have time last night. Bake at 375 for 30ish min. Loved it!!

This was delicious and a great way to give a slightly fancy touch to a very easy recipe. I gave three rather than four forks because I thought that the ratatouille recipe itself was unnecessarily complicated- - I used instead a similar recipe from Moosewood that didn't require removing ingredients from the skillet but instead cooking all in a Dutch oven, adding the quicker cooking veggies later. I also made a few additions: fresh corn to the ratatouille and when making the forms I placed a slice of polenta at the base then packed the ratatouille on top. If I were to do it again I might also add capers. To form the individual servings I used a deeper form that was about 4 inches deep and allowed for more space for the polenta and made for heartier portions. I wish I could upload a picture-- they were beautiful!

This was a great recipe. I did not have a yellow squash and didn't have time to individually make/serve. Took and 8"glass dish put a layer of ratatouille then topped with the pepper chevre - added the rest of the ratatouille on top. I added a bit more chevre and baked in the oven for 30 mins. The chevre was nicely melted. I served it with arugula and the pesto vinaigrette. Fantastic!

Ratatouille is one of my favorite things, though not my husband's. This recipe changed his mind! I changed the presentation a little & I served it over rice, with the goat cheese on top. Big hit with friends & family. Fresh herbs, not dried I think made all the difference!

This is excellent exactly as written. I've made it twice now. Once, exactly as written. The second time with minor modifications to improve portability for a pot luck. I used an 9" square cake pan for the mold and simply inverted it. I also made a base out of a hearty bread with chunks of Kalamata olives in it that I had brushed with herb de Provance infused oil (the top layer until I flipped the pan). After it cooled I cut it into squares. I tossed the greens in the vinaigrette and packed them separately. When I arrived at the party I scattered the greens between the squares on the platter. It disappeared quickly as did the recipe cards that I placed next to it. I think that polenta would have been equally delicious as a base when needed to improve portability to transform into a main dish for a luncheon.

This was wonderfull but very rich. Made it on Easter. I used my own pesto in the freezer to make the dressing. I didn't have a pastry ring so I used a small plastic dish (the kind that shredded parmesan cheese comes in. I would make again when the presentation mattered but would use a simpler version for my own personal dining, but still top with pesto and tomatoes.

Delicious and easy to assemble. I only had tomato basil goat cheese, but it was still tasty. I just chopped some fresh tomatoes rather than using a puree.

Have made this three or four times, always to good reviews. Paired with grilled portobello mushrooms. Yum

I didn't have squash so I used mushrooms instead. Really delicious. I used the suggestion of the ramakin, but did a single loaf instead of individual servings. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Rave reviews and very few leftovers.

wow- fantastic flavor combo- would be fine without the salad and vinagrette (like the pasta idea mentioned below)- but they (salad and dressing) also bring in additional flavors and texture. Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow!

I didn't rate this recipe because I only made a portion of it. I'm giving the ratatouille portion of this a 3 fork. I thought it was excellent and quite easy. The flavors were delicious. (I save 4 fork reviews for the truly exceptional dishes.) I served the ratatouille on a bed a penne pasta topped with a couple of chunks of fresh chevre, extra herbs and some roughly chopped kalamata olives. The dish was excellent.

Amazing! Loved it! My guests flipped for it! MAKE IT! I wouldn't change a thing. The only piece of advice I can offer is that you can use an empty rameken instead of a pastry ring. I took the ratatouille and filled the rameken 2/3 of the way - packed it down with a spoon - and quickly flipped it over on the parchment. Lifted the rameken up and the ratatouille was in a perfect mold!

This was an excellent salad. It also made a very pretty presentation. I put the ratatouille in ramikins. I wish however there were a way to serve this salad family style. I guess I could try putting the greens on a big try and heating the ratatouille in a bread loaf pan.... I would like to bring this salad to parties. It was great!

oh mama, this was scrumptious... loved the tiny dice and the presentation was gorgeous! You can get ring molds at Sur La Table, but any old can would do the trick. I threw a diced homegrown brandywine tomato in along with the peppers (used red & orange, beautiful!). Next time I may whip some herbs, salt & pepper into the goat cheese before pressing it in. And by itself, the pesto vinaigrette is divine!

Made the recipe exactly as stated, and while time-consuming, turned out great. Used an empty 3" can, with the lid as a presser. Husband thought it was "exquisite", a word I never heard him use before.

I'm only reviewing half of this recipe. I was searching for a basil vinaigrette to "dress-up" the standard fresh mozarella and tomato recipe that I wanted to make for a recent dinner party I was having. Used this one (used red-wine vinegar as that's what I had on hand) - and oh my goodness - it was such a smash! My boyfriend and friends ate every morsel and said it was one of the best things they'd ever eaten... it's always the simple dishes that dazzle folks... ; )

This was wonderful! Nice presentation and great layers of flavor and texture... I did not put basil or green pepper in the ratatouille & added two plum tomatoes & a large chopped shallot. Cut all veggies in bite-sized chunks and roasted. This added richness & depth of flavor.

Just great. I like to make my ratatouille in the oven at about 375. Toss the vegetables with some olive oil until coated and roast in the oven for 1/2 hour or so until crisp and browned.

handy because both ratatouille and pesto can be used to prepare other dishes
