I made this recipe last night for guests and got RAVE reviews. It was elegant and delicious. I did sub. pecans for the hazelnuts because we had so many at home. I also let the meringues cook longer. After the recommended 1 1/2 hours, they were still moist on the inside. I took them out and cut them on the parchment as recommended. They remained on the parchment and I put them back in the oven at 200 for another hour. The were super crispy and easy to remove from the parchment with an off set spatula. The pecans were so good, I think I would use them again.

I added a few more egg yolks to the lemon stuff because I was having vegetarian houseguests that would object to the gelatin-- this worked fine. When I make it again I will be sure to make the meringues the same day as I serve the dessert to prevent them from becoming chewy (and thus hard to eat) and will probably try either a sprig of mint or sweet raspberry/blackberry sauce for color-- as they came out, this dish was a bit boring in color. But delicious, hence the four forks. All was eaten.

I suggest using a silicon mat for the meringues--cooks them perfectly and doesn't stick. I didn't get them cut up in time so the meringues got all crumbly. FYI, a couple dollops of the lemon curd topped with crumbles of the meringue worked pretty well!

I did not have luck with this recipe. The meringue seamed to be done only after 1 hour and then was glued to the parchment. The lemon curd was to tart and the orange syrup was boring. Maybe it was me, but I don't see the potential in giving it another try. Sorry.

I love lemon and I love hazelnuts! This was a perfect, light, spring dessert! The lemon cream was really tart! Easy to make and assemble when ready to serve.

This was an easy recipe to make ahead of time. One of my guests said it was a great light end to a perfect meal. If you like lemon - it is going to be a hit for sure. I made the meringues, orange syrup and the lemon cream two days before serving which did not hurt it at all! I assembled the dessert just before serving it to my guests. I had quite a bit of orange syrup left over which I think would be nice over an angel food cake or even pancakes in the morning (though I haven't tried that).

Yes the dessert was really good. It is strongly recommended.
