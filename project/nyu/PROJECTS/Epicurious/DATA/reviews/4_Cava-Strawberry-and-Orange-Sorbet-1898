I made double the quantity using fresh strawberries. A brilliant recipe which complements frittata and paella well. Remaking within 2 weeks of first making says it all.

PERFECT! Made it exactly as the recipe is written except I used domestic brut "champagne." Marinated mixed berries in a little Grand Manier and put them on top of the sorbet and everyone raved.

A light and refreshing dessert suitable for serving after a heavy meal. This was a hit over Thanksgiving when served with vanilla ice cream and belgian wafers. You don't even need an ice cream maker if you aren't too picky about texture. Just use a shallow dish so it freezes quickly and allow at least 8 hrs. Take it out every now and then to stir/chop up so it doesn't form into a block of ice. The alcohol helps act as a partial antifreeze. Caught with no liquor stores open on a Sunday, I used Zima (gasp!) Citrous as a substitute and nobody was the wiser. I even used frozen strawberries but I would have to insist on fresh orange juice.
