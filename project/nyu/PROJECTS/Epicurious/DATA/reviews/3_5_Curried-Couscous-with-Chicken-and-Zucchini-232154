The curry turned out to be aromatic and flavourful, certainly a nice break from Japanese or Thai curry. Made it with the heavy cream which rounded out the curry taste. It was great with the couscous but I think it will benefit more from having a chutney to cut all the richness.

I made this last night and it was delicious. A few alterations because I was using just 2 chicken breasts. Substituted broccoli for zucchini and it was superb. I like the crunchy texture of the broccoli rather than the zucchini. Would also be good with cauliflower and carrots.

This was wonderful!!! I already can't wait to have this again. I used coconut milk instead of whipping cream since my daughter can't have dairy, but I think it was way better that way anyhow. I also added approximately 2 T of ginger. This would probably be delicious over white rice, but the whole wheat couscous we used was incredible. Yum!!

I completely changed this up - no chicken, used butternut squash and green beans. One time used paneer. Used whole milk instead of cream. Still amazing.

I don't think I've ever been more disappointed with a well-rated epicurious recipe. This was only ok in my opinion. I didn't make any substitutions apart from reducing the butter and using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of full cream, as suggested by many reviewers. I will not be making this again.

This recipe is fantastic. We cooked it for a small dinner party and it was a huge hit. It could not have been tastier, and the leftovers were even yummier the next day. We doubled the recipe, and definitely didn't use as much butter as was stated. next time we might try to add a little more curry powder. Definitely worth making though, it's out of this world.

Since I keep kosher, I made this dish substituting olive oil and coconut milk for the butter and cream, and it could not possibly have been any tastier. I also cut way back on the amount of oil. It was so good that I posted the recipe link on Facebook. Can't wait to eat it again.

Delicious, rich flavor. I used less butter and had to substitute sour cream for heavy cream because I didn't have any on hand. Sounds like a big no-no, but actually turned out OK. I just didn't boil the sauce again after adding the sour cream.

This a keeper. No need to use 3/4 stick of butter; used half and half. Thinking about using whole milk to keep the calories down. I suggest prepping the zucchini, onions, and chicken breast ahead of time.

I loved this recipe! It was spicy and flavorful and the heavy cream added to it gave it a really unique flavor. I am making it again tonight!

Excellent. Followed to a "T". A lot of steps, but they are quick steps. So the dish flows quickly. I used plain ole' McCormick Curry. May be one of the best meals I have made!

i really like this recipe. i have not made any major additions (just use half and half instead of heavy cream) and we love it. even our 1 year old loves it. so flavorful.

I have made this several times and really love it. I have made it with both the small couscous and Israeli couscous. The only thing I change is to triple the Madras curry powder in the sauce and to double it in the couscous. Oh, and I also add red bell pepper and carrot along with the zucchini. I highly recommend.

Absolutely delicious! I've made this about 5 times now, and we just love it. Even my toddler gobbles it right up! It doesn't take terribly long, either, which is important with a busy life. Last night, I cut the butter in half, and didn't taste a huge difference, which is good.

This recipe is in Faye Levy's "International Chicken Cookbook," published in 1992. Perhaps Gourmet credited Ms. Levy, but she should be credited here as well. The only differences are in the amount of butter (twice as much here) and the wording of the instructions. I noticed because I decided to check my Epicurious recipe box immediately after looking at Levy's "curried chicken with couscous and zucchini" recipe to see if I had some other recipe for the ingredients I had on hand.

AWESOME flavor. I made it just like the receipe stated and my family CHOWED!!!

Didn't have curry powder but subbed a mix of garam masala, cayenne, cumin and coriander. Also added ginger which shone through and was delicious - one thing we thought was missing was the sweetness and flavor of coconut, and I will use coconut milk next time instead of heavy cream. All in all, yummy and a good use of abundant zucchini :-)

My husband couldn't say enough about this dish. I followed the recipe as written - which resulted in a velvety, subtle curry - very elegant. We're looking forward to making it for company.

Delicious. I licked the plate. Adding minced ginger lifts the recipe another notch. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested it.

Excellent!! thought I was dining out. Use half the cream and half the butter it is still rich.

I loved this, it is mild enough for children and the 2 kids ate it. The 9 yo loved it, the 6 yo less so, he didn't want the sauce on his rice but he ate the chicken and zucchini part. I would stick to cream bacause it reduces nicely and isn't a super huge calorie hit in this small quantity. I served it over rice. The mom absolutely loved it.

Love this and so does my kids and husband. Super easy. I double the sauce and the zucchini. Have been making this since 2005!

We love a good curry-this was a bit bland, tho. As much as I love couscous I think Basmati or jasmine rice would be better. Used milk instead of cream and used Smart Balance instead of butter. Really, chicken thighs are the ultimate for curry, but the breast meat was pretty tender, albeit lacking the flavor of the dark meat. Will make again but tweak it to make it richer-maybe add some garam masala and more garlic.

Very good. I used whole milk instead of cream and it worked out well. I also added cauliflower and carrots to the mix.

Very good and very easy for a weeknight meal - the house smelled wonderful too! I used fat free half-n-half instead of the heavy cream, actually it worked out just fine and whole wheat cous cous. Had to add extra curry powder since I've had mine around too long. Fresh spices are obviously a must!

Very good weeknight meal - I didn't make the sauce separately to cut out a step (just did the couscous along with the sauce) and was still delicious

Good call on the part of the Cook from PA. The roux worked very well, since all I had was skim milk on hand. Also subbed chicken thighs on the bone with a longer cooking time. Very tasty! I might increase the curry powder next time or sub coconut milk for the cream.

Didn't have heavy cream either (forgot at the store). Just after adding the curry powder, I added a little more butter and some flour to make a roux. Then added the broth as instructed and used milk instead of cream. The flour provided enough thickening and it didn't separate. Thanks to the cook from St Louis for sharing your experience because I probably would have done the same thing! This dish was well received in my family.

This dish was really good. I used half and half instead of heavy cream...big mistake, my sauce started to separate. Next time I will stick with the heavy cream. The couscous was so delicious, it would be a good stand alone dish for lunch or on nights when you don't feel like cooking up the chicken.

This is the best curry recipe that I have made to date. My husband can't wait for me to make it again. However, a good curry powder makes all of the difference... I used a Hot Madras Curry and it was perfect!

I made this with thinly sliced Broccoli instead of Zucchini and it turned out wonderfully!!

My kids made this for dinner and followed the recipe without substitutions. I'm not a huge curry fan, but this was mild enough that I enjoyed it, as did the whole family.

This was a great recipe. The only changes I made was to substitute olive oil for the butter and I added cayanne pepper as we like things a bit hotter. We'll be making this again.

A bit bland. I used the bell peppers, as well, and they added nice color to a this monochromatic dish, but it needs something else. Next time I'm going to try a touch of ginger and some powdered cumin to add some heat. I also didn't use butter, instead substituting olive oil. We ate it with a Castle Rock fume blanc that matched it very nicely. I will definitely make it again.

I used red bell peppers instead of zucchini and it was delightful.
