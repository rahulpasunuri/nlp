An excellent panzanella recipe. Panzanella is all about the quality of the old bread and the tomatoes; this dressing, with lemon zest and garlic, enhances the flavors but doesn't overwhelm.

The nutrition information looks wacky-over 1000 calories and over 400 of those are from fat?

I had some roasted garlic bread that was 3 days old, and seemed a shame to throw it out. I made this salad as written, with the exception of not having any fennel on hand, and it was absolutely amazing, and a one-dish meal at that! Use a really good EVO - I think it makes a huge difference.

Nice light salad with bright flavors. Excellent use of summer veggies especially from the garden.
