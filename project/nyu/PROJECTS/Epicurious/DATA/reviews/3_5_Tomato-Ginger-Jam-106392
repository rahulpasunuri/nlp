This was super easy and delicious - I used some beautiful golden plum tomatoes I got at a farmer's market, omitted the cilantro and substituted lemon juice for lime. It was perfect on a slice of sourdough baguette with a little camembert cheese! Definitely a keeper.

I wasn't overly impressed with this. It never thickened as much as I thought it would. I gave it more time than it called for to reduce and thicken, which helped a bit. It is a nice departure from cocktail sauce, though.

Crab Cakes with Tomato Ginger Jam - I varied the crab cake recipe a bit but the jam is fabulous with the crab cakes or on crackers or served on Belgian Endive leaves. I also used the jam after keeping it refigerated in a sealed container for a week.

Used it as a condiment on a crab, avocado and tomato tower for a salad appetizer at our employee awards dinner and that's all everyone talked about the next day.

This recipe was a big hit! It was great on the crab cakes and as a dip for firm bread sticks. note: I had to use cayenne instead of red pepper flakes because I couldn't find them where I was vacationing.
