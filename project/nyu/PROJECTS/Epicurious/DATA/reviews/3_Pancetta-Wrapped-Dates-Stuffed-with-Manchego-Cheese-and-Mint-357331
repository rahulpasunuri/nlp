Sounded better than it tasted. Not bad but not worth the expense.

oddly enough, i did not like these very much. it's hard to believe considering how much i like all of the ingredients... it was all just way too sweet and rich for me, i think. although i love the idea of something wrapped in pancetta, i think it needs to be something lighter, like for instance a scallop...

These are wonderful - sweet and savory. I made these for superbowl last year and doing it again this year. These are super wonderful with a glass of white wine, or even a sparkling white wine.

This is such a flavorful and easy appitizer, plus it was a huge hit with friends & family at Easter. I did not bother with pliers--just cut the date open--after it's stuffed the date is sticky so it closes up neat and the pancetta covers and holds it together. I didn't have the chance to go to a speciality store for the Manchego so I used Asiago and pancetta from the deli sliced very thin. (Tried prociutto, too out of curiosity-terrible! Stringy and way too salty! so you have to use thin pancetta) Also, in the end left out the mint and used it as garnish--I just loved the salty/sweet contrast of the date and pancetta on their own.

Nice combo with the dates and the Manchego Cheese. The mint give's a nice freshness. Love it. @darien i give you a good advise, cooking is not only following a recipe, if you don't know a product..make research about it. Just use www.google.com or any other search engine which you like and read!!! Maybe you should think twice when you write a review about something. It might not be your taste, so don't put this down like this, ok?

Delicious! Just made these for the third time the other day. I just adore the melding of flavors; the coolness of the mint in contrast to the nutty taste of the cheese, and the crisp, saltiness of the pancetta in contrast to the smoothness of the caramelized dates. Did I mention delicious? I never make the full recipe for fear I'll just eat them all myself!

My guests loved these! No leftovers. I was expecting a little more taste contribution from the cheese and mint, but will definitely make them again.

LIKE THE PREVIOUS ENTRY pANCETTA CAN BE SLICED VERY THIN. i HAVE DONE THIS MANY TIMES. I deseed. Stuff with a cheese of sort and wrap with the pancetta very thin and bake. It is well received and can be done ahead of time as it goes well at room temp. Be creative and see what happens

Your butcher will slice the pancetta paper thin if you ask which will make it easy to roll the date in.

i wonder if they meant prosciutto, pancetta always comes in a large roll, i've never seen it thinly sliced in a package...

This was very disappointing. First of all, you do not have to cut off the ends and use pliers to remove the pits. You can simply slice open the date, insert the mint and cheese and close it shut. The recipe should have suggested that the pancetta be cut in strips, my pancetta came in round slices, which made it difficult to roll up neatly. The taste was not nearly as interesting as I thought it would be and I had purchased very good manchego cheese and pancetta. It was very sticky to eat, leaving guests with an uncomfortable mess.
