delicious! Made exactly as written and they were perfect. Love the chunks of crystalized ginger, and of course the organic dark chocolate chips from Whole Foods bulk section. They are definitely buttery, but not overly. Didn't butter pan, used siplat sheets instead.

I omit the chocolate chips and make them very small. They're perfect with afternoon tea.

So tasty! The ginger combined with the semi-sweet chocolate and cardamom and other spices is divine. They'll be more crispy if you make them flatter on the cookie sheet. I make them for all cookie exchanges.

These were basically like regular chocolate chip cookies, but with less flour so they were very buttery. The ginger flavor was not very strong. I would not recommend the recipe.

They weren't as crispy as I thought they would be. But they are definitely cookies. Apparently, everyone raved about them. I would definitely make them again.

Butter bombs- when I baked the first batch there were pools of grease - I added a lot more flour and they were okay but mainly taste of butter. 2 cubes butter seems to much. I like the ginger but I'll use another dough recipe next time.

Fantastic! This very mature version of the classic cholate chip cookie was a great surprise. I used whole wheat flour. I put the candied ginger in the cuisinart, and came out with ginger crumbles, which worked wonderfully. This is the most successful cookie I've made yet.

I have made these on numerous occasions and everyone, including myself, loves them. Their crispy texture combined with the spiciness of the ingredients and the sweetness of the chocolate is a superb combination. If you don't like things too spicy, just cut down a bit on the ginger. I highly recommend them.
