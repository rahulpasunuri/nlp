Instead of whear flour, I used Almond flour (since I'm on the Paleo diet) and it was YUMMY! Perfect "cracker" for a salad and I plan to use this with a spoons of tomato basil on top. I can have bruschetta again!

I made this to go with a home made tomato soup. We really liked the recipe. I used deli pre-shredded parm. Next time I will use fresh.

These are very tasty....chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside...are they supposed to be all crispy? If so, can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

These are delicious! I would make them again and again. They're simple, fast, and a great snack. They are especially fun for kids to make. I woUld definitely recommend this to anyone.

Easy, salty, cheesy, crispy. I don't use white flour anymore and this came out just fine with whole wheat flour. I also added pepper and dried parsley flakes and like the green flecks in the crisps.

I used freshly grated Grana Padano, which is all we had. As suggested, I added finely grated pepper and a dash of cayenne. But I divided the cheese mixture in half. One got white flour, the other masa harina. Both versions are delicious, but the batch made with corn flour is crisper and more delicate. They're a little on the salty side, so I'll reduce the salt in the vinaigrette they'll be served with (atop a composed asparagus salad). I used stainless-steel rings to keep things symmetrical.

These things are freaking delicious! I made them as an accompaniment to my grilled eggplant parmesan and they were devoured. However, I threw the recipe together a few weeks later and forgot that I needed fresh parmesan. I used the Kraft powder-like version and ended up with garbage. The fat content in the real parmesan was necessary for the cheese to melt into a crisp.

Very moist and not too sweet.

These are GREAT! I used about 1T flour per 2 cups cheese. Even mixed in cheap grated parm with hand grated asiago. Added black pepper, and baked on parchment for 11 minutes. Recipe says use parchment on greased baking sheet? That makes NO sense - these slid of the parchment so easily, I used the same sheets over and over for the entire batch.

Wonderful...I did this ahead and it worked out great. I spread the butter mixture evenly on the asparagus and put it in the fridge until it was time. They were uniform and perfectly prepared!

these are my new favorite snack...or to serve with salad, or soup, anytime. I love them and so easy

Sublime and so easy! My 11 year old daughter thought to add real bacon bits to a batch... that batch hardly had time to cool off.

Great quick "cracker". I add almond flour instead of white, a pinch of smoked hot paprika, and some italian herbs for a little more kick.

I made two batches of these, one exactly as written in the recipe, another with the recommended addition of cayenne. The heat from the cayenne made them taste a bit like they were burnt. Not a very nice addition... the regular batch, however, was great! My dinner guests just kept raving about them. Tons of reward for very little work. 4 forks for the regular recipe.

These were very tasty, but mine were too brittle and fell apart when removing them from the cookie sheet. I had lined it with aluminum foil which may be the problem. I was also told I may have overcooked them. Next time, I will use parchment paper and take them out of the oven when they just start to colour.

Good. I added served then with a white bean and parmesan soup. They were actually great floating in the soup-- added great crunch and flavor.

Too easy and too good!!!! Liked the cayenne suggestion, will try it next time...

These little suckers pack a powerful flavor punch....I added a touch of cayenne and used them with the Roast Pork and Escarole Soup recipe on this site. I used a Silpat, they took a bit longer than the recipe states...but they couldn't possibly be any easier to make.

These are really good. Partly because of the flavor and partly because of the perfect thin-crispiness, it isn't easy to stop eating them....

I had made a similar recipe before but this one "because of the flour" was much better. After I took it out of the oven, I rolled the parmesan crips around a wooden spoon, if they harden, just put them back in the oven for a few seconds. Delicious on it's own or in a caesar salad.

These are wonderful little cheese wafers that are excellent with Caesar salads or in an antipasto platter.
