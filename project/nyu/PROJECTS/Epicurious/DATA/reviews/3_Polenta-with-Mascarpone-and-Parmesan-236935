Yeah...I don't get it. I made my own polenta and topped it with the mascarpone and parmigiano-reggiano...a little bit of ground black pepper...it's not doing anything for me flavor-wise. But it's very edible nonetheless, I'll say that.

I've made this twice but with coarse ground corn meal (1 cup) and it is excellent. I like the texture of polenta like this better.

I prefer homemade polenta, however, this dish was wonderful. I recommend a little salt with the seasoning at the end, but otherwise, it was a perfect side for a flavorful main dish.

A friend just made this for us for a Christmas lunch. YUMMMMMM. We loved it. It's not for the diet-conscious, but who cares. It tasted good to me.

A bit bland. Next time I'll give the polenta circles a bit of a toast-up with good olive oil in a skillet before baking, trying for a bit of texture/crunch and added flavor. Perhaps also a little blue cheese for a kick.

This dish is extremely easy to make and is very tasty! You can use a less marscapone cheese to make it a little less greasy if that bothers you.

I thought it was pretty tasty. Sure it is fattening but you don't have to eat it everyday. Very simple to make as well

i dont know why the cook from kirkland had to be so angry with such a miserable review. i wont try to balance his/hers with something equally emphatic, but suffice it to say we have made this dish more times than we can count. its not only a family favorite, but gotten rave reviews and requests for recipe by discerning guests. others really should try. maybe kirkland used too much mascarpone...?

I don't know where the 3 1/2 forks came from, but this is one of the WORST recipes I've ever found on epicurious!! It is tasteless and swimming in fat from the mascarpone cheese. Don't waste your time or money on this recipe - it's a real loser!! It got dumped!! I'm sorry I had to give it a "one fork" in order to type my opinion.
