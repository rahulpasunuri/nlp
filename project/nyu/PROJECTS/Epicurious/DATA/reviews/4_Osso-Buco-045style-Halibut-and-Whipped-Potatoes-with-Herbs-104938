This is rich and well worth the time. Served for a dinner party for 6 and not anything left on any of the plates...much to the disappointment of my dog. I cooked down a bit more than it called for just to make it thicker...I could have left out 1 cup of chicken stock for same effect. I did not change pans, after I browned fish I just placed on top of sauce and put in oven. I made but forgot to add the Gremolata...no one noticed, but I did serve over herb potatoes.

Absolutely great recipe! Didn't change a thing.

Amazingly good. This is a very easy recipe and the results are sensational! Can't wait to do it again. One alteration to the recipe is that I inadvertently doubled the orange juice in the sauce, just made it more citrus-y. I made "dirty" mashed potatoes to go with the fish, and used Meyer lemons to make the Gremolata. Everything was heavenly.

Rating: 3
The unique combination of ingredients makes this a fun recipe. The resulting sauce is both tangy and savory, and pairs well with the mashed potatos. It was hard to decide between 3 or 4 forks for this one so I was conservative...I'll certainly make it again.

I made this exactly as written, except I used dried lemon grass and put it in a cheesecloth bag with the thyme and bayleaf. This recipe is almost spectacular. The sauce, though, is a tiny bit "muddy" tasting. I suspect omitting the soy sauce would make it a thre or even four fork. I made the mashed potatoes per the recipe (delicious) and the gremolata, which the halibut really needs. I thought the sauce would overpower the fish, but it doesn't. Be sure to cook the sauce enough so it's very thick and rich tasting. Again, it didn't have that "wow" factor for all the work, but I suspect it might be a "wow" without the soy sauce.

This is a fabulous dish. It takes a lot of time to prepare it but it's worth the wait. I think it took me about two hours to put it together but my mom and dad talked about it for weeks. The combination of flavors and textures were wonderful. Don't leave anything out. Do it per the instructions and you'll love it!

Very good and well worth the time (it took me a long time to make.) I was hesitant to serve it as stated (fish on top of the potatoes) but I did and I'm glad I did! The mixture of different flavors was amazingly good. Be sure to make the Gremolata. The only downside is the garlic burps afterwards. Tons of garlic (but not too strong in flavor.) This is definitely worth making.

I made the recipe exactly as it was described less 1 change. After adding the chicken broth, I allowed that to reduce to a half before adding the rest of the liquids. I loved the sauce, however my husband was so so. If it wasn't for that I would make this one of my staple halibut dishes. I thought it was very good.

The whole meal- halibut, whipped potatoes, and gremolata- was outstanding. Made it exactly as the recipe instructed and it turned out great.

Rating: 3
My husband and I both liked this. It had a bit too much sweetness - probably from the balsamic at the end; maybe I should garnish with more gemolata. Also, I elected to bake the fish in the same pan, rather than dirty a 13x9. I keep lemongrass in the freezer - just throw it in when you get home. I didn't chop the lemongrass, rather cut it into 3-in lengths, which worked well. Also, I made the sauce recipe, despite having half the fish, so we could use bread to finish off the sauce.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish 5 times, and every time it has been excellent and gotten rave reviews. For the lemon grass I've begun to use the lemon grass found in a tube in most grocery produce sections. It's excellent and really gives the sauce that lemon grass flavor, subtle, but there. My next feat will be to use veal shanks instead of halibut. Like one reviewer said, the sauce would be good on a cardboard box.

Rating: 3
Hmmm... everyone gave such raves reviews to this and I almost always concur with such good reviews. This was good and very flavorful, but perhaps the osso buco style sauce was a tad too heavy for the fish. Personally, I think there's better uses for halibut (a lighter sauce or none at all)and I'll stick to the lamb or veal for osso buco. This is definitely not a summer dish... maybe we would have enjoyed it more on a snowy day.

Rating: 4
As I read in another review: restaurant quality! I have made this twice, once with Halibut and another with Sea Bass, doesn't matter. This sauce would taste great on a cardboard box. Placing the lemongrass in cheesecloth along with the thyme is a must. Make your own chicken broth!!! Enjoy!

Rating: 4
I made this dish exactly as written for a dinner party last night and it was phenomenal. There is alot you can do ahead; I made the sauce and browned the halibut earlier in the day. I kept the sauce in the oven at 350 for an hour before serving (it actually reduced a bit, becoming richer and more complex). During the first course I put the fish back in the heated sauce and it was perfect! I will definitely make this again when I want to impress.

I have made this recipie many times since first seeing it in the magazine. It is great for dinner parties as the bulk of the work is in the sauce, which can be done ahead of time. It is a staple in my menu collection.

Delicious and not at all difficult, just a little time consuming. I used one very large piece of (Costco sized) halibut instead, and it worked just as well. The only thing I would do differently is use quite a bit less (and higher quality) balsamic vinegar. Also, do not leave out the gremolata. It really adds a refreshing zesty, bright quality to the dish.

Fantastic recipe - the only change I recommend is using the lemongrass paste available in most produce departments, instead of chopped lemongrass. Make extra sauce to freeze, then defrost for a quick meal with chicken, shrimp or any white fish!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was delicious. I needed a festive recipe to satisfy our vegetarian daughter and this was perfect. I substituted tilapia for the halibut.

I am definitely not on crack, and I am a very good cook. I have made this recipe many times and it gets raves every time. A good quality chicken broth helps if you haven't made your own stock.

Are all of you people on crack? This has to be the biggest "bust" of a recipe I've ever encountered on this website. The sauce was totally salty--disgusting. I even used about 1/2 the amount of soy after reading the comments. Also, I've never heard of chopping lemongrass and eating it in a sauce. It is always discarded after the sauce is made when used in most Asian dishes. You people are all on crack! I can't believe any future comments sections on this site--completely discredited now.

I made this for 9 people. Used the low salt tamari and added more oj & wine instead of more chicken stock. Also put the lemon grass and some sliced lemon & bay leaf in cheesecloth bag. Everyone said they loved it. Great! Took some time but worth it. All the tips really help in the making & taste.

This dish was AMAZING! We couldn't believe how delicious this meal was. I made the whole menu and it is now my priority menu for entertaining. Making the sauce in advance is brilliant - I will do that for a crowd. My beloved husband who does not really enjoy fish (I want him to eat more healthy food) had seconds! I took the suggestion of previous reviewers and kept the lemongrass in bigger pieces, cooked the sauce with it in and then removed it at serving time. I also used tamari instead of soy. I will absolutely make this again.

Rating: 4
This dish is EXCELLENT!!!!!! I would also use the tamari vrs. soy sauce- better quality & flavor & less 'salty'. I would also advise to cut the lemongrass into larger pieces & remove them before serving- it adds a nice flavor- but the texture of the little pieces took away too much from the dish. I've made it a few times & everyone RAVES about it- I've even seens people who are small eaters get seconds & many other scoping out the kitchen for more. Well well worth the time in making the sauce- and over the potatoes with the gremolata- wow!!! It's fabulous- one of those recipes I pull out for special dinners. Enjoy!!

This dish is definitely worth the time spent creating the sauce. I left the lemongrass in large pieces and removed it just prior to finishing the dish in the oven. The combination of flavors, textures, and colors is beautiful. I took a tip from all the other reviews and made the sauce the day before. It was a breeze to complete the next evening. Well worth the effort as the guests will be raving.

Rating: 4
To concur with the majority, this is a brilliant recipe. We kept exclaiming how much we loved it while we were dining. Perhaps those cooks who haven't the experience of cooking with lemongrass used the too-tough parts; important to get it fresh from your Asian grocer (I also pureed the sauce with my hand blender). All of my herbs were fresh-picked from my garden. I used chives, parsley, rosemary and sage in the potatoes, less butter with a little half and half (I didn't have milk). As did another cook, I also used tamari, not soy. Didn't have a problem with sodium content -- if you have all kinds of dietary concerns, then stick to the simpler stuff! This was excellent and definitely something I would prepare for company!

Rating: 2
I thought this recipe was just okay. I have other halibut recipes I prefer. The sauce was good but next time I would leave out the lemongrass, which added a srange texture and taste to the sauce. I think the sauce would be better with lamb or possibly chicken, and better served over rice.

Really yummy, and leftover sauce was great on pasta. I can see how it might be too salty for some; the low-sodium idea is probably a good one. It ended up providing dinner for two for three nights!

This dish is wonderful- the sauce is fabulous! The scent of the sauce cooking added to my guest's anticipation. They were not disappointed. I served it with herb risotto and steamed/buttered broccoli. I used Tamari, an organic whole soybean, wheat-free soy sauce so I did not experience the salt problem that other reviewers complained about.

Rating: 2
I had high hopes for this dish, but was disappointed. It seemed to take forever to make, and was definitely not worth the effort. The flavors were way too intense. I read the previous review suggesting cutting down the amount of soy sauce, so I only added 1/8 cup. Still way too salty. A much better recipe is Grilled Halibut with Warm Tomato Compote. Easy and yummy.

I received rave reviews from my guests with this one. I was hesitant as the sauce is very flavourful and I thought the halibut would be overpowered. I just poured sauce around the side of the fish and potatoes. It was a memorable and delicious meal. Fabulous!

I have made this twice. Most recently I used Chilean Sea Bass from my local fish market since halibut was not available. I am not sure if was really from Chile or is actually Bass but it was delicious. Makes me psyched to go back to Blue Ginger. A Bialy Zin was a good match and I bet a California Syrah would be as well

My first review of any recipe on site. Also first experience with lemongrass, but none of the complaints issued by others. I bought mine from oriental grocery---they keep it "fresh" but frozen. Discarded outer layer & very top, which did seem dry, chopped as would a scallion---3 stalks did work perfect--was moist& soft when finally cooked. Made this for company & enlisted help with chop, dice, stir, etc., so it was a "group" effort during cocktails. I love the recipe because my oven is not on for so long & as hot as for trad. dish--great for summer eating--but will make this all year long!! Next time increase volume of potatoes--they disappeared too quickly--my brother wanted more!

3 words...de-lic-ious

Rating: 4
The sauce was amazing - best osso buco sauce I've ever had. The only downside is that it overwhelms the flavor of the halibut. Next time I might try it with chicken or veal, although I would still make it with halibut on those occasions when I want a hearty fish dish or when I have guests who only eat fish. I omitted the gremolata because I'm not fond of raw garlic, and served it with my own (lower fat) herbed mashed potatoes. I used very fresh lemongrass but still found occasional tough pieces, so next time I might place the chopped lemongrass in a cheesecloth bag so I can remove it at the end.

Rating: 3
Everyone, including my 3-year-old, devoured every speck of this. I sliced the lemongrass very thinly, however still was too tough. Brother-in-law suggested doubling amount of lemongrass without slicing and remove prior to serving. Agree with other reviewer that it does make a fabulous presentation... will try with a side of broccholi w/lemon butter or something similar next time.

This dish was delicious! I modified the recipe to serve two and the flavors were great. I was expecting a much thinner sauce than what I ended up with. Mine resulted in a chunky sauce, similar to that of a ratatouille. Also, for those of you (like myself) that have never used lemon grass before, I would suggest to make certain it is very fresh and hydrated, without brown or dark spots. Unfortunately, I had never cooked with lemon grass before and I did not know what to look for; mine was dry and hard. Next time, if the sauce turns out chunky, I'll probably puree it and strain out the juice for a nice broth. Overall, this dish was fantastic!

Rating: 4
Excellent! The entire recipe including the potatoes and gremolata are definitely company quality. The flavor AND presentation were both very impressive. I added haricot verts to the plate and Ming Tsai couldn't have done better. I followed the recipe to a "T" and my sauce simmered down to 3 cups in 55 minutes. I have a commercial style range and that may make the difference. One bit of advice, pass the gremolata and let your guests add their own, a little goes a long way. It well worth the effort to make it.

I've made this recipe several times already. It's easily adapted for those of us who are trying to lose some weight. I cut down on the oil used to saute the fish, leave the butter out of the sauce, and use fat free cream to make the mashed potatoes. It's every bit as good as the original recipe. Great for entertaining too since the sauce can be made in advance.

Lemongrass was not available in my market so I substituted fresh lemon peel to taste. I served as a side dish some of that new Barilla stuffed pasta (instead of the potatoes) with a bit of the sauce over it and it was great. I did find it a bit on the salty side but the overall fish dish is such perfection that it was easy to overlook. Entire family (including young kids) loved it!

I doubled the recipe and made this dish for a dinner party. The sauce did take a long time to make -- but it was delicious and all the guests loved it. After reading the reviews, I cut up the lemon grass into 1-inch pieces and then removed them before whisking in the butter. I doubled the recipe for the potatoes, too, but I really could have used more. I had to portion out the potatoes very carefully to make the 11 portions I needed. Very tasty.

Rating: 4
This took longer to make than I thought to make.I would definitely make it again, but I would make the sauce 1-2 days in advance. It would save alot of scurrying before guests arrived. It looked so beautiful on the plate; something I wasn't expecting! We all ooohed and ahhed over every bite. Absolutely delicious.The whipped potatoes take it from delicious to sublime. It was my first experience with lemon grass, and I wondered if it was supposed to be so hard? After reading other review, I see that it is.

I was a little afraid of the sauce when I was putting this recipe together (soy sauce, orange juice, lemongrass, wine--all together seemed like overkill). And yes, the flavors are extremely intense, but I have to say, I think it works. The sauce is definitely delicious enough to eat on its own, and I think the fish stands up to it well. But it's definitely not for those who prefer a more delicate treatment for fish. It's wonderful with the potatoes, and all in all, is the kind of meal you feel drunk off of when you're done.

To the cook from Sydney - try the Swordfish in Balsamic Brown Butter Sauce on this site. It's super simple, delicious, and doesn't hide the flavor of the fish.

I do love Ming Tsai, but I thought it was good, not great. It seems more like a "winter" fish dish, than "spring". Although I have to agree that it was some work, if you prep ahead and have everything laid out, its really not that bad. As a previous reviewer noted, the sauce did take longer than 50 minutes to reduce to 3 cups. "Simmer" was a misnomer there. If I had let it rip, I'm sure 50 minutes would have done it. The sauce was flavorful, and I don't agree that it overwhelmed the fish. However, I did think that putting it in the oven was an unnecessary step. I simply put the fish atop the sauce in the pan, and let it barely simmer for a few minutes while I finished the potatoes. The fish was perfectly cooked. I thought the potatoes were a little stiff, but maybe I am just used to cream/milk in mine. (By the way, I have tons of leftover sauce. Any suggestions? I was considering freezing it, then just cooking the fish and potatoes some evening.)

Sorry all you lovers of this recipe. I thought it was just okay and certainly not worth all the effort. It was a huge let down. The sauce was too over-powering for the fish. Oh well...if anyone has another Epicurious recipe for fish that was a winner, please recommend.

This is a delicious dish. Although it is a lot of work and time, it is well worth it for a special occasion. The whipped potatoes with herbs went very well with it. The gremolata was excellent as well. Definitely make the gremolata with the halibut. Only one minor comment: the reduction of the sauce to 3c. would have taken much more than 50 min. Perhaps I did not do something right, but nevertheless, that wasn't too much of a worry.

Rating: 4
So delicious!! My husband is not a fish fan, but he loved this. A note about lemon grass -- It is my understanding that lemon grass is for flavoring much the same way bay leaf is used and it is not intended for eating. So I left it tied together and then removed it. It provides a subtel lemon flavor.

This was a fantastic dish but, yes, a bit of trouble. The only thing that bothered me was the lemongrass. I could taste little hard chunks of it when I was eating! I had never used lemongrass before and I assume you are supposed to peel the top, rather hard, layer before mincing. Even doing this I still tasted little bits in the sauce. Can anyone help with this?

What a waste of some beautiful halibut fillets!! The sauce was quite a bit of work to prepare, and it just ended up tasting like my mother's pot roast (not that I don't love your pot rost, Mom). We used high quality ingredients, and took care in the preparation, but were very disappointed. If you're preparing fish, you should be able to actually taste the fish. We can't really recommend this recipe.

This was extraordinary! I ended up with extra sauce so the next night I added some heavy cream, mixed it with cooked penne, put it in a 13X9 pan, topped it with grated asiago and baked it at 425 degrees until it got nicely browned. Very good.

Rating: 2
I made this exactly as prescribed, but found it unnecessarily ambitious, flavorwise. I don't mind complexity in flavor or preparation, but in this case the ingredients were somewhat at war with a delicious & light halibut flavor. I minced the lemongrass as finely as I could (in Cuisinart)and still it was tough. I love most of Ming Tsai's recipes, but this seemed like overkill.

This is an awesome recipe! Highly recommend it. We make traditional osso buco often and it was a great change to make it with fish. I very roughly halfed the sauce for two large pieces of fish, and it was incredible. The recipe was very forgiving.

Haven't tried this, but will. We've eaten at Ming Tsai's restaurant in Wellesley, MA, the Blue Ginger. It was phenomenal. But we stopped watching his Food Channel show, "East Meets West," and didn't buy his cookbook (of the same name) because his recipes were always full of ingredients that we can't get around here in southern RI. Flying fish roe, pomegranate syrup, etc. Sure, the Super Stop & Shop has that. NOT. But this recipe, this, I can do!

I agree this is one of THE best halibut dishes I have ever had. Definitely worth the time to cook the sauce. I disagree with the cook who said to omit the gremolata.

My only alteration might be to cut the lemon grass into larger pieces and then remove them before serving. Minced lemon grass was tough to chew even after a thorough cooking.
