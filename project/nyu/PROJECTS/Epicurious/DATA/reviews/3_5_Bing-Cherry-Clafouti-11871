This clafouti turned out very well: puffed and golden. I'd recommend reducing the almond extract to half of what the recipe calls for, otherwise the flavour becomes ovewhelming. Also, don't be tempted to use more cherries than suggested: the fruit gives off liquid while it bakes, and too many cherries make the clafouti soggy.

I thought this was delicious and very easy and I would certainly make it again. I used Chinook cherries from the farmers' market and added some slivered almonds.

Should you happen to have a couple of tablespoons of leftover ground almonds handy, add them with the rest of the custard ingredients. Stiffens the custard a tad, not unpleasantly, and rounds the flavour of almond from the extract, which can be a bit harsh. This is a great solution to the problem of too many cherries and perhaps some of them no longer in peak condition. Really very good.

For makers of this recipe who were dissatisfied in some way, may I suggest you try Julia Child's recipe for Cherry Clafouti in her book "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" and cutting the recipe in half as I do. The ingredients are basically the same, but the proportions are somewhat different, and we have never been disappointed in the results. If you don't have the book, it can be found in most public libraries.

Everybody love it. There was a tough layer at the bottom. And the custard didn't gel. I found 400 degrees difficult. In the future I think a water bath would be appropriate. Just like Creme Brulee. And a I would make in small containers. Then most excellent!

I have made this clafouti three times now and like it more each time I make it. I served it last night to Miss Nancy and Miss Stella and they both said it was fabulous! Believe me, that's tender praise from a couple of tough cookies!

I was surprised at how easy this was. Very tasty--my fiance loved it. I am looking forward to trying it with a different fruit like blueberries or blackberries.

I rarely take the trouble to rate the recipes (90% excellant) but this time I must. The batter was much too sweet, proportions off (how do 2 people finish the whole thing), & after it was done, there was a distinct tougher layer at the bottom.

Easy and delicious. I will certainly make this again.

You won't believe how good this is. I've made it about four times so far! And it's so easy!

a great, light, simple dessert for two -- tastes great with whipped cream on top
