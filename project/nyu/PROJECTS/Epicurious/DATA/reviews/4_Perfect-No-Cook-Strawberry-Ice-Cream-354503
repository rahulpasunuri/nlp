Yum! This is the best strawberry ice cream I have ever tasted. I agree with other reviewers that there were some ice crystals that I would have preferred not to have, but the taste was so amazing, it made the ice crystals forgivable.

The flavor was good, but too many ice crystals. I think a custard would have evened it out. I wanted to love it, but just didn't.

This was absolutely delicious. I used fat free half and half and the outcome was still wonderful. Would other berries work as well?

Have made several times for guests and also as presents. Everyone thought it was the best strawberry ice cream they had ever had.

Loved it. So easy and delicious! My strawberries were a bit tart so I added some sweet raspberries which added to the color and sweetness but the flavor was all strawberry. I increased the lemon for brightness and used 1 and 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream and half a cup low fat milk. It was rich but not too buttery. I was so glad it was such a hit! A little whipped cream and crumbled vanilla wafers for a great topping.

Yum! It's too quick and easy to be less than 4 forks, as far as I'm concerned. I did make some changes: A few extra strawberries, 1/2 c sugar, juice of 1/2 lemon, 1 T vanilla, 1 t gelatin (for smoothness), 2 c 1/2 & 1/2, and I pureed the whole thing in a blender. Quite delicious, plenty sweet and super strawberry-y. Next time, I'll go get the heavy whip. I rather like the buttery spoon effect :)

delicious. easy!!! i followed the other recommendations: 2 cups half & half, sugar + maple syrup and puree with a hand held emulsifier the entire thing----fabulous. VERY, VERY, strawberry.... can't wait to try it with other fruits: blueberries, peaches, etc. yeah!!!

As a first time ice cream maker I didn't know what to expect and was very happy with the results. I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar down to 1/2 Cup, and used 2 Cups whipping cream. The key I think was the strawberries. I used local fresh strawberries that are so sweet and delicious. I will make it again for sure, and will try other variations for the cream to make it lower in fat.

I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup half & half and it was perfect, not too much of the greasy feel but very creamy. It could have used a bit more salt. I got fresh picked strawberries from the farmers market. This could hardly have been better. Great with a little chocolate cookie.

The recipe is very easy. It does leave a film on your spoon and in your mouth though when you use heavy cream, but no one else noticed it. Next time I will try half and half. Took less than 3 hours to make, and this recipe made 6 servings. It will definitely be a staple for us. Kids devoured it! Fiance loves it.

Seems hard to go wrong with something so simple. Followed another reviewers suggestion and used combination of maple syrup and sugar. Used all heavy cream, and think I will do as others have done next time and use at least some part of lower milk-fat cream. Really delicious.

Start with cut up frozen strawberries. Put all ingredients in a blender and make a slurry. Freeze in ice cream freezer. It takes about 5 minutes to freeze. For low fat, and dietetic ice cream, use splenda and non fat half and half

Replace one cup of the heavy cream with light cream, or half-and-half. It will still be plenty rich, and you won't get a butterfat film on your spoon. It is worth noting that homemade ice cream has a different consistency than premium ice creams because home cooks don't use chemical stabilizers for mass production. If you do a taste test with this and a commerical strawberry, the one from the store will have a fake undertone to it. Even Haagen-Dazs.

I pureed the whole mixture til smooth and it's really one of the best, freshest tasting fruit ice creams I've had. Really no need to make the traditional version with all the eggs when you've got this one.

I made both this recipe and the Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream recipe on this site. My kids loved this one - the strawberry flavor is really intense. I'd use whipping cream next time, instead of the heavy cream, because my only reason for not giving it 4 forks is that it left a greasy film on your spoon (and in your mouth). But it's amazingly easy. We'll make it again.

I was a little doubtful, as I only had 1 cup of cream (so I did the other cup of milk) and the strawberries were definitely past their peak. Even with those limitations, this was amazing! The lemon really gave it a great taste. And, I actually really liked it with half-and-half and would do it again the same way.

I've made two variations on this recipe and they were both fabulous. I didn't have heavy cream, so in one variation, I used whole milk, which was really good. Yes, as someone said, not as creamy as the premium ice creams, but I think that's overrated anyway. In the second variation, I used yogurt I had made from whole milk, without using lemon juice. Also fabulous. One day, I'll actually get some cream and try it as written. I used local strawberries that I bought during peak strawberry season and froze. Once they were thawed, I used a pastry cutter to mash/dice them, which worked very well. There were some little chunks, which gave it some chew, but mostly there was an intense strawberry flavor.

I used 1/2 C. sugar and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream. I also pureed the berries in the food processor. Delicious!

Instead of 3/4 cup sugar, I used 1/2 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup sugar. I also added a couple of teaspoons of brandy to help it stay softer longer. Instead of leaving some of the strawberries mashed, I pureed the whole thing. I just removed it from the ice cream maker and put it in the freezer. The initial results are a 12 on a scale of 10!!! The best strawberry ice cream ever!!!

I made this ice cream for a girl's brunch, and all my friends loved it! It's definitely not as creamy as, say, Haagen Dasz, but it's creamy enough to be delicious! And, the fresh strawberry flavor really comes through.

Though I like the idea of strawberries in the ice cream, they froze like hunks of ice and disrupted the texture. I'd puree more of the mixture / ensure the pieces were very small. I also found it a bit heavy with so much cream. If I tried again, I'd use half & half. I think there are better ice cream recipes -- but ice cream is like sex. Even bad ice cream is pretty darn good.

This ice cream was very delicious. However I always seem to have a problem with my ice cream maker. After freezing I have an icy texture and the ice cream itself seems rather chalky in texture. Am I just overfreezing it in the ice cream machine? How do you tell when it is ready? I went about 25 minutes. I need help.

Top Notch Dessert!! Wow how many variations can you make with this recipe? Only your imagination is the limit. On Sunday at Church, We made strawberry, peach, blueberry, and even a pecan butterscotch version everyone went nuts on this recipe, Poker Guys give this 4 forks!! Getting 4 forks from thesed guys is like trying to take a bowl of berries from a hungry Bear, just aint gonna happen easy. Try this one if you like ice cream and can tolerate dairy. I am going to try to make a non dairy version and see if i can make it work, unless some one has a recipe already.

This was quite good and the sweet strawberry flavor really comes through. It is not as delicious as a "custard" ice cream, but for the amount of effort (minimal), this was a good result. It was very quick and easy to make.

This had great strawberry flavor and was very simple to make. I quick-chilled the ice cream base in an ice bath so I could make it more quickly. Very good, and I will make this easy ice cream again.
