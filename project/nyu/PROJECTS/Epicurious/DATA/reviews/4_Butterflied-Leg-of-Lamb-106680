This sounds delicious and I am planning to cook it for a holiday lunch tomorrow. I'm unsure what to do with the marinade however - the recipe says to retain it, but gives no suggestion of what to do with it. I presume it will make a nice gravy - but would appreciate suggestions from anyone who has actually tried it. Many thanks.

this recipe was delicious! I marinated a 2 lb butterflied leg of lamb in about 1/2 the marinade overnight. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I browned the lamb on the stove and then put the covered pan with the drippings in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes - Then I let it sit for about 10 minutes covered. It came out perfect for us (just slightly pink in the center)!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years from one of the Silver Palette cookbooks. It never misses. Marinate longer (days even) for best flavor.

This was excellent! I made 4 of these and served it to 25 people and they all raved about it. It was very tender. I added 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary and 2 sprigs of fresh thyme to the marinade for each leg of lamb. I will make this again for our next Easter celebration.

Really really easy and delicious. I have used this marinade on lamb several times now--sometimes I grill it on the BBQ, sometimes I brown it on the stovetop then roast at 400 degrees. Marinated 8-12 hours, it gives a great flavor to the lamb while letting the lamb taste shine through too. Wonderful!

Very good marinade that tempers the strong lamb flavour that some people don't enjoy. Flare ups are inevitable and you need a large grill surface and constant attention to avoid a blackened mess.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because of ease of preparation as well as flavour. I only marinated my lamb 3 hours and it was full af flavour and very juicy and tender. Also,as a left-over it was the best I've ever tasted not being as greasy as many cold lamb dishes.
