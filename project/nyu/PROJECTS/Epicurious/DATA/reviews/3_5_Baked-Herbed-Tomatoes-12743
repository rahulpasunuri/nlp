Pretty blah. Breadcrumbs in tomatoes. Definitely needs something to zest it up. Looks nice though.

Have already made this dish several times. Since we are low carbing it, I cut the bread crumbs down to only 2 Tbs. and add lots of fresh grated pecorino romano cheese. I also use roasted garlic paste instead of the minced...just delicious!

The filling was too dry. It just didn't taste that great.

This is so versatile you can serve it with just about anything. I was even able to get my sister, the world's pickiest eater, to enjoy this one.

My husband loves this recipe! I used scallions instead of onions and added some fresh grated parmesan -- my husband is already asking when I will make these tomatoes again!

I used parmigiana regiano, shallots, and doubled the garlic. My bread crumbs were from seven grain bread & I thought it made it tastier. Loved it so much, I had to make it again two days later.

Wonderful fresh flavor....OK I admit I ADORE basil. Easy and fast. I did not drain the tomatoes for long - Just eased out the seeds and extra liquids before filling. My husband wanted more - next time I'll know to make two halves for each of us.

I reduced the basil by half and added 2 T. freshly grated parmesan and we really enjoyed theses yummy tomatoes.

This recipe is easy & great for summer when tomatoes are bountiful. I used small golden tomatoes from the garden, and added parmesan cheese to the topping. My family loves it. Using smaller tomatoes that are fleshy eliminates the wateriness. Quick, easy, excellent.

I wonder what cook from Media, Pa eats since olive oil is considered "heart healthy" as are the rest of the ingredients! This is a very nice side dish - and you can improvise it endlessly.

Yummy and easy! I cheated ...to save even more time, I used a sage and onion packaged stuffing mix (Butterball brand, but any type could be used). While it was cooking in the microwave, I caramelized an onion and added it to the stuffing mixture for additional flavor. I will certainly make theses again.

Good flavor and the bonus of fixing ahead make this a keeper. Question to previous reviewer --- "what is unhealthy about this topping".

Very tasty!

when one scrapes most of the topping off...then one can enjoy a tasty heart healthy and delicious tomato.

Due to circumstances, we had to eat these warm instead of hot, but they were still very good. Flavorful and attractive.

This dish was delicious and extremely easy to make! The herbs gave the tomatoes extra punch. We didn't have time to drain the tomatoes, so we skipped that part and they were still very tasty. A great side dish!

This was very nice, tho in fairness, I must confess I used homemade cheese bread crumbs from a batch of bread that didn't turn out well, and added cheese to the bread crumb mixture (mozzarella) because we are cheese lovers - bet it would be better still with parmesan or asagio. I would guess the quality of your tomato is important - mine were luscious, huge, beatifully scented. Also, I dug out more of the center of the tomato than given in recipe to fit in more of the stuffing, and pretty much doubled the stuffing for my giant tomatoes. Great with steak!
