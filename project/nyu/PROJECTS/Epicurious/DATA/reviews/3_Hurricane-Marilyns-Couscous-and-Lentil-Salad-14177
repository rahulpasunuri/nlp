I've been making this recipe for years. I prefer feta or ricotta salata to the blue cheese, and use cherry tomatoes cut in half and add to the salad instead of as garnish. This is a hearty salad - keep it in mind when you're entertaining vegetarians.

Just curious why this is credited to Hurricane Marilyn...

This dish was very subtle. The recipe as it stands is too bland. I increased the garlic and lemon juice to give it more flavor. I also substituted cilantro for the mint which worked well. It would also be easy to add other vegetables like bell peppers or red onions.
