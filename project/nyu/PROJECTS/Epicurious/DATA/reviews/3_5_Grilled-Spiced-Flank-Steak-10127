Too much cinnamon and salt for my taste.

Not bad - the rub was very nice. Next time I might lighten the cinnamon and pepper a bit but it complimented the steak very well. I let it marinade for 2 hours instead of one. The steak was a bit chewy but that was probably my bad!

Quick and easy to make. I marinated it 2 hours as recommended by other reviewers. The steak turned out tender and delicious. Leftover is great for steak salad. Definitely make it again!

I made this for company and everyone asked for the recipe. It was very easy to prepare. I marinated for about two hours and the meat was very tender.

Oh man this was good! Never would have thought cinnamon and steak would go so well together! And flank steak is so much cheaper than sirloin! I just don't know how 1 pound would feed 4 people, since the 2 of us polished a pound off without a problem! Would make this for company in a heartbeat.

Absolutely delicious! One hour of marinating time is sufficient, but more time is even better - more tender and tasty.

I make this often and it is always a hit. The dry rub can also be used on baby-back pork ribs and the flavor is fantastic.

I omitted the cooking part, and it was awful. DEFINITELY cook this bastard, you'll be thankful later.

this is a great recipe if you are in the mood for a tender steak but dont have the time to marinade--its delicious--and i have made it several times already

Easy, easy, easy and delicious. Served it with Gratin potatoes with white cheddar & tarragon and watercress salad with Asian dressing and grilled herb garlic bread. Very nice patio bbq dinner. This is a nice change from the typical wet marinated flank.

This was pretty good. I marinated it for ~ 4 hrs. so it was tender, but the next time I make it I will try using some red wine and the seasonings used for the rub to cook for an "au jus" to make the dish more juicy.

This is the second time that I have made this recipe. It is easy and good. In fact I used the rub on "baby-back" ribs as a change of pace and was excellent. The flavor is unique.

Not much flavor - which is perhaps a good thing because the flavor it did have was exceedingly odd. An emphatic thumbs down.

I know we are in the minority, but my husband and I did not care for this. I think maybe the flavor we didn't like was the cinnamon.

Loved it. Super fast and easy. Only marinated 1 hour and it came out perfect. You can't go wrong here. A year round griller and this one will be made many, many more times:)

I was looking for something easy to do on the grill for a Thursday night. Not only with this easy but it was excellent. I ended up marinading it for just barely an hour; I can't imagine what it would be like overnight.

I had seen this recipe many times, but put of trying it. My mistake! The flavour was incredible; would not change one thing. I roasted the coriander, cumin, pepper and salt and that gave it a more intense flavour. Try this recipe....you won't be disappointed.

Quick and easy. Wife and 9 year old daughter both loved this.

Loved this rub! Try it on chicken, brisket, stew beef, lamb. It's the best, and I never have any leftovers (pity for me...)

Excellent! This was a big hit. I ate it in a salad with pear, celery, green onions, lettuce, and goat cheese (poppy seed dressing) and was in HEAVEN! Then I served it at a luncheon on mini-onion rolls with sliced pear, lettuce, and cream cheese. The goat cheese worked better because it had more zip. But it was the hit of the party.

So simple, yet delicious. All it needs is a salad and a baked potato, and you have a wonderful meal.

I found that the steak was far too salty; the other spices were strong, but a nice combination. You have to like strong flavors to like this dish. I would cut the salt in half or less and try it again.

cooked this for a dinner party...a lot left over, no one raved. The spices are very overpowering. I also bought what I thought was a good grade of flank steak at $5.00/lb but maybe it really wasn't.

Truly excellent. The flavors were so unique and very satisfying. Definitely a keeper!

This is about the quickest, tastiest entree I have ever seen. My family loved it so much we had it two nights in a row and looking forward to the next time.

I made this without letting it sit...it was good anyway. A keeper.

We grill flank steak all of the time because it is an easy dinner. This was terrific!! It was really different and the flavors from the rub really came through!!

This is fast, no stress cooking at its best. I could only marinate this for an hour and had to broil it cause a bbq was not available and it still got raves from those fortunate enough to partake. Can't wait to do it the long way.

One of my favorite recipes and one that I have served at several back yard cookouts -- usually several folks ask for the recipe.

I marinated the flank steak for about 4 hours, and it was very tasty. A hit at dinner, and light. I would cut down the cinnamon in the spice rub by half next time...just my preference.

Fast and easy. I only marinated it for 30 minutes, and it still came out good.
