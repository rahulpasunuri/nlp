Add strawberries to make it better

Flavor is uninspired but is easy to make.

Very good.. A big hit at a dinner party I went to.

I was interested in this pudding because it looked so easy and fast and didn't contain eggs which meant not having to worry about clumping, etc. I think perhaps next time I'd use a bit more cornstarch and make sure I cook it to as hot a temperature as is reasonable to thicken it as fully as possible. It seemed to set ok and was good a few hours after chilling but the next day leftovers gave up a bit and got pretty thin. The flavor is very good if you use good cocoa and chocolate, and it's super fast to make. I'll make it again but it doesn't make the cut for recipes I'd serve to guests. I'm sure my toddler will love it.

Simple to make and very elegant if served in cut crystal glasses. I shave chocolate over rather than dust with cocoa. Have made this several times for guests and never had any complaints ;) Will certainly make this again and again and again. It is too easy.

I have made this three times for three different dinner parties and every time the glasses come back almost clean and I hear people scraping the glasses for more. I do not like pudding, so I am always surprised what a hit it is (I prefer mascarpone cheesecake or something gooey). It has become my boyfriend's favorite though, so I'll be making it even more.

absolutely amazing. made this for a dinner party last night, stuck in the fridge for a few hours before we finally ate them and yummmm, so good! i don't quite have a clean scooping technique so the pudding got everywhere, but it tasted great. will definitely make again.

make sure to give plenty of time to chill, as it is much better cold. yum!

I thought this dessert was fantastic, considering how easy it was to prepare and present beautifully. I served it in wine glasses, for a classy touch. Also, if you are not a big chocolate fan, you may want to make plain, vanilla flavored whip cream instead of the chocolate to layer between the pudding. Use good quality chocolate.

My daughter made this recipe tonight. She piped it into brandy snifters & used a little shaved chocolate to garnish.. It was beautiful & delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

I've made this 2xs this week. Both times used Xylitol instead of sugar with no problems. The 2nd time I cut the amt of chopped chocolate in 1/2 - yummy and a little less dense.

It is good, a little much on the effort, Instant chocolate pudding and coolwhip works too

So delicious and easy! I forgot to add the cocoa to the whipped cream and it was just as yummy without. The pudding was very simple to make and was a decadent dessert. I would definitely make it again.

Recipe calls for a pinch of salt. Cream %?

Eyelo, I don't want to seem condescending, but my mother has been known to grab the yellow box of baking soda when she meant to grab the yellow box of cornstarch, which would definitely make for the bad aftertaste and saltiness. It seems odd that the same thing could happen twice, but I wanted to throw in out there.

Dear Eyelo, I'm not sure what you did wrong - but there is no salt in this recipe. If you found the finished product to be salty - that is certainly a curiosity. I suspect you made an error in the ingredients.

eyelo, did you use unsalted butter or salted butter? That might be what made the recipe salty. Other then that, I don't see where any salty flavor would come from.

I made this recipe not once but twice because I thought I made a mistake the 1st time. My husband and I thought it was the worst dessert. I threw both batches out. Followed the recipe as printed. The only good thing was the whipped cream. The pudding itself had the worst after taste and was salty. I cook and bake alot and think I am pretty good at it. Does anyone have a hint for me with this one??????

My husband and I liked this very much and didn't find it too rich at all. It was pleasant tasting, light,and very easy. Also held up well for several days.

Very rich and everyone enjoyed it.

These are incredibly rich. If you love chocolate, you will love these. My daughter (not a chooclate fan) asked to subsitute plain whipped cream next time.

I did the entire recipe and it took less than an hour. It was outstanding in every way.

I have already made this twice, to my chilrecn's delight. I skipped the whipped cream step and topped it with mini chocolate chips
