This was so simple, quick and so good. Definitely one for the "old standy's".

Don't get me wrong. I prefer lemon to vinegar and I think you should all try the ROMAINE WITH PARMESAN DRESSING in this website. It's exactly the same recipe only better! Lemon=less calories & sugar and the prep is so much easier than whisking etc. I had such a hard time tossing the lettuce into that thick sauce. We ended up scooping it up!

This is a lovely and ridiculously simple salad recipe that is great on its own and even better with some homemade croutons. With so few ingredients, the importance of using real parmigiana should be obvious! Everyone should have this easy little recipe in their heads, so they can toss together a great salad at the last minute with very few ingredients.

Really easy and tastes like it has more than 4 ingredients in it. Good-quality oil and cheese are musts. Great for quick weeknight suppers.

This recipe is so simple that it's become a favorite when I am in a hurry. It's quick to fix, add croutons and it's ready to serve.

This was SO GOOD! It is super easy (takes like 5-10 minutes, max!), and tasted simply wonderful. I will use this "dressing" again and again!

Use as much parmesan to your taste... you'll find you won't need as much as the recipe calls for. Omitted the salt and it was just fine. Toss in some croutons (not too salty) for more crunch. Simple. Easy. Delicious. Make sure to use fresh parmesan (the best you can find)... and never the stuff that comes out of a foil can. It makes all the difference. I have a new favorite dressing!

Quick, easy and delicious! It took me only about a minute to make the dressing. Although I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe calls for - I enjoyed this salad very much.
