Kimchi is great, but I like turnip kimchi best, so, that is what I will try.

I have made this twice, both times for Korean students. A note of caution: the salt is way too much. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too salty. Second time I rinsed the salted cabbage and did not add the 3 tbsp. salt called for and it was still plenty salty. But my Korean student friend said the seasonings were much better than the first time.
