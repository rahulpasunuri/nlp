Very good, although consistancy was too think for a sauce. I added a little more OJ and water to thin it out. I even poured it over chicken-great!

This turned out MUCH MUCH better than I thought...it goes GREAT as a dip with raw veggies. Sweet but still had a kick. Yum!

This is very good. Used it on soba noodles very yummy and a little goes a long way. The consistency is a bit thick, I think I'll thin it out next time. All I had in the house was green tea and it didn't seem to matter to the taste.

Very rich, perhaps a little lighter, although our two-year old was licking the pan and ate every last bite!!

This sauce is excellent to use with a Chinese Hot Pot dinner using thinly sliced beef, shrimp, small chicken breast chunks and cruditees.
