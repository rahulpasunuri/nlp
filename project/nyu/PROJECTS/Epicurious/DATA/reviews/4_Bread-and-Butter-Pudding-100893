Great, easily adaptable, smells delicious and is wonderful comfort food. I was looking for a recipe that used less than 8 eggs. Only had 1 cup heavy cream and @1/2 cup whole milk so filled in the rest with skim milk. Added a little triple sec, cinnamon and nutmeg. Consistency was perfect. It did take a long time to prepare, however.

Never thought I would even taste bread pudding. This is fantastic. I also added cinnamon, almond extract, and raisins. Served with the spiced rum sauce. I made it much more dry 7-8 cups bread. Without this recipe tho, I would not have tried it. Delicious!

After Christmas I had a lot of leftovers. So I decided to make bread and butter pudding but with a twist. I replaced the baquette with 10 dinner rolls ,I used 1 3/4 cups of egg nog and 1cup of heavy cream. I also cut down on the sugar to 1/2 a cup and added 2 teaspoons each of nutmeg and cinnamon. The eggs,vanilla and unsalted butter was the same as original recipe.Turned out amazingly.

This is a simple base for a delicious bread pudding. It couldn't be easier and is a perfect recipe for adding your own touches and flavors. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, maple and pecans. I'm not a huge sweet person, but this a fantastic comfort dish with a great "homey" flavor and wasn't too sugary sweet. I look forward to making this again and experimenting with other flavors.

Wonderful. added bourbon and pecans-yummy! next time amaretto and slivered, toasted almonds. will make more "pudding next time as I prefer a bit less bread and more pudding.

This is a wonderful recipe. It is easy to make and so delicious. I didn't have enough cream, so switched the quantities of milk and cream. My honey says this is his new favorite dessert now.

Simply excellent. I have made this recipe dozens of times and often throw in spices and chocolate or raisins and it is always good!

have made this a couple times - once as is and today with blueberry sticky buns (instead of baguette) and 8 egg yolks instead of 4 eggs - both times were exceptional. keeper recipe.

This is an excellent base recipe for bread pudding - adding in ingredients to your personal taste is easy, as the recipe is flexible. Like a previous reviewer, I served this (hot) with rum raisin ice cream. It was delicious! Hubby hates raisins, so he tried his with dark chocolate-cinnamon ice cream; this was also a tasty combination. Would also be lovely at room temperature with whipped cream and berries in the summer.

I made this to use up some bread I had, and it was delicious. The best bread pudding I've ever had. I shared it with friends and family and they couldn't get enough of it.....which means I'm going to make another one tomorrow!

This is a great bread pudding - I added some sliced almonds (about 2 TBSP), amaretto (about 3 TBSP) and dried cherries (which I reconstituted in the amaretto before tossing it all in). All other ingredients remained the same. It was even better the next day after the flavors had really developed.

This is a very good bread pudding. I served it warm on small plates in a bed of melted haggen-dazs rum raisin ice cream. yum

I make this recipe all the time and it is always a big hit. I add more bread though almost 7 cups. I am always asked for the recipe.

Great great great!!! I switched the proportion of milk and heavy cream like the other reviewer, and added 2 chopped bananas and a handful of dried flake coconut. Half of the guests thought it was just right, but the other half think it is slightly too sweet. So I may reduce the sugar to a little over 1/2 cup next time. Had it with vanilla ice cream...divine divine divine! A definite keeper!

Absolutely wonderful bread pudding. Unfortunately I only had a cup of cream handy, so I inverted the milk and cream amounts. What resulted was a lovely, light, not-too-sweet pudding with gorgeous texture and taste. I am a purist when it comes to bread pudding so I like it plain, but perhaps I may try a smattering of Ghirardelli white chocolate chips or a dash of Grand Marnier next time and see what happens. Not that this recipe needs such embellishments; it's wonderful as is.

Easy. Very buttery, rich, and eggy. I think adding some kind of liqueur and spices would bring it up to the 4-fork level :-)

I loved this easy recipe. To the cook from Scotland: there are many regional variations of many dishes. Just because you grew up with one variation, doesn't mean that it's the one and only authentic recipe. Have an open mind, try different things, and live life to the fullest!

I actually haven't tried this recipe, but I'd like to mention that this is _NOT_ a Bread and Butter Pudding as we Brits make it. As I understand it, a Bread pudding involves cubes or crumbs of bread (I may be wrong, as as far as I know we don't really have them in the UK), and _Bread and Butter_ pudding involves slices of bread that are buttered. It's actually quite hard to find recipes for Bread and Butter Pudding, but when Bread Pudding recipes are misnamed, it's even worse!

mouth-watering and wonderfully rich...crisp buttery bread cubes nestled in a soft vanilla custard. i've made this several times now, and each time it's been heavenly. i especially like the distinct textures in this recipe, unlike some of the denser, firmer bread puddings i've tried. bread pudding lovers MUST try this one.

I like to add white chocolate chips before I bake it, then pour raspberry syrup over it just before I serve it -- Simply Heavenly!

Excellent! Only had one cup of cream so I increased the milk to 1 3/4 C. Added one teaspoon cinnamon, some raisins and topped it with toasted chopped pecans. Awesome with vanilla icecream!

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GREAT BREAD PUDDING RECEIPE AND I'VE FOUND IT! I TRIED ADDING 2oz BRANDY AND ONLY USED 3/4 CUP MILK---IT WAS TRUELY DECADENT.

This is a fabulous dish...not sweet. We used the bourbon sauce recipe and everyone could add as much sweetness as they liked. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I served it to a group of catering/restaurant people who raved about it!

This is the best bread pudding - the best *any* pudding - I've ever had. Served with a warm bourbon sauce. It was heavenly even without the sauce. Make no modifications to this recipe. It defines what bread pudding should be.

I have tried many bread pudding recipes and this is now my favorite. It was easy but the taste and texture is what makes it a winner. I made this in a spring form pan and served in pie slices with a warm bourbon and raisin sauce. It was a BIG HIT.

I chose this as desert for a new year's eve dinner. This is without a doubt the best bread pudding recipe I've ever made. My last attempt ended up soggy, but this one turned out perfect! Like another user I cut the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon, and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract. Before baking, I tossed a handful of slivered almonds on top. This one definitely goes into my regular rotation, and will be reprised.

I wish I could rate it a 5!! My family loved it, and my father-in-law is big into bread pudding. My husband, who is NOT a sweets person, totally loved it. I added cinnamon and white raisins though also, although I am sure it would be ok without 'em. Great baking recipe if you want to make something awesome in advance and/or if you're a novice. This one will be engraved on my recipe box.

This is indeed a wonderful bread and butter pudding. The first time I made this recipe I followed the directions as printed. Since then I have made it several times adding 1 teaspoon of almond extract and decreasing the vanilla to a half teaspoon. For an almond lover (like myself) this becomes the ultimate bread pudding. Family loves it.

I literally have sweet dreams about this incredible bread pudding! It is one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made and it's certainly one of the simplest as well. Next time I make it, I plan to garnish it with fresh nectarines and/or berries.

Desserts are my favorite to bake. After 24 years of successes and flops, my husband says this is the ultimate!! My family and friends agree. I added some golden raisins to the mixture before baking, about a cup. It is best when just warm from the oven. Can be reheated though.
