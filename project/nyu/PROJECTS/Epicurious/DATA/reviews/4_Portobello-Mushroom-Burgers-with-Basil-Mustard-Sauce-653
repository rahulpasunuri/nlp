So yummy! I made these in the George Forman and they came out tender and yummy! I made them for my brother and sister in laws family for their once a week vegetarian meal. My eat meat brother even agreed that they were good. The sauce is a wonderful touch.

Everyone I've made this for loves it. My "meat and potatoes" eating son ate 2 and my "vegan" other son enjoyed every morsel( we used vegan mayo for his sauce). Wouldn't change a thing especially the mesquite wood smoke.

Rating: 4
Oh, yummy! I did this without the wood chips, but followed the recipe otherwise. I think the sauce would be good on regular burgers, too!

What a great sauce! I halved the first four ingredients. It was plenty for 3 mushroom burgers; had enough left to dip my french fries!

Maybe I did something wrong. I rarely think anything is unedible; but I found this to be. The mayo was overwhelming and I love mayo and I didn't even use all of it. I felt I wasted a 1/3 cup of my homegrown basil.

Rating: 3
Great and easy, an awesome alternative to burgers and brats at barbecues, especially when you have vegetarian guests. I used about half the mayonnaise it called for both times I made this and it was PLENTY. Definitely worth a try.

Great! I even used the Basil-Mustard Sauce mixed with Ketchup for the Fries.

Rating: 3
I too added balsamic vinegar to the marinade. Used my Krups Panini grill to prepare the mushrooms with great results. Topped finished "burgers" with creamy havarti and sliced red onions along with the romaine, and tomato. Used a multi-grain bread in place of a bun. Made the basil-mustard-mayo sauce and wasn't really impressed by it. The mushrooms themselves were succulent, juicy, and very delicious.

Rating: 4
Yummy. Easy to make and very good! Added some bottle horseradish to the sauce for some kick and it was wonderful. Didn't use all of the mayo called for either, since I'm not a huge mayo fan. The balsamic marinade is key for the mushrooms!

These were absolutely delicious. We did make a couple variations. Marinated the portobellos in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and garlic. We don't have a grill, so we broiled them for about 4 minutes on each side, which seemed to work quite well. We used thick slices of potato-rosemary bread, and added some warmed-up brie on top. The combination of sauce, balsamic, brie, and rosemary flavor was wonderful. (I also had some sliced pickled jalepenos with mine, which added a nice kick.)

This is a great recipe - the non-meat eaters at my BBQ really enjoyed it, and the basil mustard sauce is very versatile.

This was a hit at my house-warming BBQ! Each flavor played off the other. Everyone asked me for the receipe and as always I quite willingly replied, "Why Epicurious". Thanks again.

The sauce is excellant. Truly enjoy making this dish. For a different twist try it with grilled squash, zucchini, red onions, and called a veggie burger. serve with roasted potatoe wedges. Happy cooking.

This is fantastic. I have passed this on to many friends and they too are thrilled. Never thought I'd eat vegetarian. Of courase, what wouldn't taste great with Portobello's. I've done this in a grill pan and it's just as good.

This was one of the biggest hits yet here at the house. I never thought I could eat a vegetarian meal and like it. I do think I used too much oil on the mushrooms, because it kept falling into the fire and causing the flames to grow too big, but I will tone the oil down next time. It's a keeper!!

These are great! They're juicier than real burgers and more flavorful. The sauce is delicious on any kind of burgers too. I also added some avocado slices and swiss cheese.

These turned out beautifully, moist, tasty and so chewable! My 10-year-old couldn't stop raving and said the meal was one of the best she's ever had. I made topped them with a slice of Leerdammer cheese (a mild Dutch cheese) and served them on toasted croissants since it's hard to get burger buns in Belgium! My 18-month-old and 5-year-old also loved them.

A perfect vegetarian meal!

Made this recipe for my Wisconsin beef eating family and they all loved it. Next time I'll try to find bigger mushrooms to allow for shrinkage.

I made these for vegetarians at a cookout. They were a big hit. I did not make the mustard sauce but served the caps with roasted red peppers also brushed with the garlic-oil and danish blue cheese.

My carnivorous husband raved about this dish and is wondering how we can get his ag teacher dad to try it. I used a fat-free mayo because it's what we had in the house. I used a stove-top grill pan and had to cook the mushrooms a minute or two longer. By the way, the leftover mayo is excellent with steamed artichokes.

The basil mayo mix is delicious. I added the garlic into the mayo and just brushed the mushrooms with some spray olive oil. When my garden basil is gone, I'm going to substitute fresh rosemary. Sauteed red onions and red bell peppers thinly sliced, with some basil and olive oil is delicious on top instead of tomato, too.

Quick, easy, and delicious! We substituted dry basil and stone ground mustard and cooked it on a gas grill. They still came out great!

One of our very favorite hot summer night specials.Quick, easy and special enough for company.

This dish was excellent. I liked everything about it- the sauce went very well with the burger, and everything was quite easy to make.

I don't have a grill either, but just used a grill pan. I'm sure these must taste even BETTER on an outdoor grill, though! The basil mayo is what really makes this dish; I've even jazzed it up like Neiman Marcus and added a little brie and some orange marmalade. (I know, that sounds weird but somehow it works, trust me.)

Being vegetarians, my husband and I are always looking for new and exciting recipes. We were not disappointed with this one. It is phenomenal. I have made it several times to rave reviews.

Time consuming, but tasty. We served with slaw and chilled white wine. Va va voom!

It's the basil-mustard that makes these "burgers" so mouth-watering. For those who simply have to have meat, substitute grilled chicken breast for mushrooms.

Used standard burger buns rather than super size. Not as filling that way. Loved the sauce and used NoFat Kraft mayo to cut down calories. Tasted great.

In a family with 2 vegetarians and one carnivore who doesn't mind a meatless entree but doesn't like meat substitutes (tofu, etc.)recipes like this are a godsend. We all thought this was delicious even though we have no grill and broiled instead.

Delightful recipe, however one has to open up like a snake to get a bite and the sandwich tends to slide apart. I think the next time I do this I'll serve it as an open faced sandwich on a slice of toast.

Great Vegetarian alternative to the traditional grilled meat pattie.

Didn't use the chips this time... will try next time. Great alternative to MEAT.

We loved this and would make it more often...except that the basil mayonnaise is too good...and too full of cholesterol
