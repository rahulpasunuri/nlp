This recipe is one of my favorites. Like others, I always add cumin to the squash mixture, and I use some feta cheese -- the salty tang is so nice with the squash and whatever other mild, melty cheese I have on hand, and not nearly in the quantities called for here. Sometimes I add a spoonful of black beans for added flavor and nutrition. I find the salsa incredibly quick and easy to make and one of the most important flavors of the dish. But I haven't cracked the code of keeping the tortillas themselves from turning to mush in the oven. Next time, I'll try baking with just a little sauce on the bottom and none on top, then adding it right before serving.

I halved the recipe, using 1 butternut squash and roasted Hatch green chiles and corn. Like others, I seasoned the filling with a little cumin and cinnamon, and the balance of flavours was wonderful. I also sprinkled crumbled queso fresco in the filling before rolling. I'd recommend using jarred tomatillo salsa for great flavour and convenience, and cutting down on the amount of cheese sprinkled over the enchiladas before baking.

Delicious, even for non-vegetarians, and easy to make.

I found this looking for a Mexicanish recipe to use some CSA stuff, especially a delicata squash. And since I only had about 1/2 the weight of winter squash as the recipe calls for, I added lots of other CSA veggies, including more garlic, red & yellow sweet pepper (about one whole total), leeks, swiss chard & mushrooms. Also added ½ lb shrimp, which was good but totally unnecessary. With all that stuff, I thought it would be way too much filling, but it worked out to be just the right amount to fill a 13 X 9 pan with the 12 small tortillas I had. Was a little dubious about using the winter squash, but it worked great and actually held the enchiladas together better than they usually do. Somehow mozzarella seemed odd for this, so looked for queso blanco. Couldnt find it, but did find a greek grilling cheese which seemed to have a similar texture and worked perfectly! Two minor assembly things: I put the cheese into the enchiladas before the veggie filling, so that as they were inverted to lay in the dish, the cheese was on the top & melted into the enchiladas, rather than being on the bottom & sticking to the pan! Also, put a little of the tomatillo sauce on the bottom of the dish, which also prevented sticking. My DH & dishwasher much appreciated it. As others suggested, added chili powder & cumin, and roasted the jalapeno & tomatillos before pureeing.

These were delicious and a big hit with vegetarians at my dinner party. To save time, I bought pre-peeled, cubed squash at Whole Foods and microwaved it until tender. I also took the suggestion of other reviewers and added cumin and chili powder to the squash mixture, and also a bit of cinnamon. The spices (esp the cinnamon) are key - otherwise the dish would've been meh, I think. Also added a bit more corn than called for the second time I made this because I liked the textural crunch it gave to the dish.

These were excellent! I added cumin to the filling because it seemed appropriate and it added a nice flavor. I also cheated and used store bought tomatillo sauce. And, yes, it does make a lot of extra filling so be prepared to have a lot of enchiladas.

I had some left over butternut squash and fresh tomatillos from the farmers market when I stumbled upon this recipe. It is scrumptious with a unique blend of flavors. I used frozen corn and simmered it with the squash, onion, garlic in a few tablespoons of vegetable broth with cumin. I barely used the amount cheese the recipe called for and substituted some feta as per the advice of another reviewer. I found the feta to add a nice salty taste. I will make this for friends!

This recipe is FANTASTIC, and super easy. I added an extra jalapeno to the sauce because I like it spicy, and omitted the chicken stock (the sauce is watery enough on its own.) I had some canned tomatillo salsa that I made over the Summer, and I added that to the fresh sauce for extra sauciness. I roasted the squash as stated, and added some cumin to the veggie mixture. This is an excellent weeknight and winter dinner. Would be excellent with the addition of chicken or shrimp. Next time I might add kale. Mmmmmm! Can't wait to make this again.

Like the recipe and it was very easy to prepare. I added a can of diced green chiles to the squash that gave it some extra flavor.

I gave it 4 forks though it's not a fancy dish, but it's just a very useful combination. I really needed another way to use winter squash, there's so much of it this time of year. It lends itself to fooling around with it-- It could also be done as an enchilada pie casserole for a potluck. I think this will join my list of standards.

Fantastic vegetarian recipe! I took the recommendation from the chef to add chili powder and cumin while roasting the squash. I think the squash needs a bit more sweetness once you taste it with the tart tomatillo sauce, so next time I might add some brown sugar or honey. I completely forgot the chicken stock for the tomatillo sauce and it worked out well. I think the sauce would have been too watery with it, so I lucked out. Served with black beans and a tomato/avacado/lime/green onion/cilantro/serrano salad.

This was really good. I made it tonight for a dinner party. The tomatillo sauce was very easy to make as were the enchiladas. The only problem I had was not allotting enough time to cook the squash as the recipe says--I had been looking at another recipe and didn't realize it would take 1 1/2 hrs. So I just roasted the squash, which takes about 30 minutes at 400 degrees. It worked just fine and I won't do it any differently next time. I do like the idea of adding shrimp, which I think I'll try. Everyone loved this.

I really only marginally followed this recipe. I had half of a large butternut squash leftover and got a pound of shrimp. I left out the corn, and added the cooked shrimp as well as about 1/4 cup of cream cheese to the filling. I did use all 4 cups of cheese, but I ended up making 18, not 12 enchiladas. Also, since only 12 fit in one pan, I used a second pan and then used store bought red enchilada sauce on the big pan and green on the little pan. We enjoyed our "christmas" squash and shrimp enchiladas very much!

I made this using a kabocha squash sprinkled with a salt mix I found in another recipe on this website. I also added a serrano chile that I roasted and seeded and when I sauted the onion and garlic I added thinly sliced tuscan kale. I substituted the cheese mix with goat cheese and feta and cut it down to a cup total with some of it mixed into the filling and the rest sprinkled on top. I too cheated and used a bottled tomatillo enchilada sauce I found at Whole Foods. Finally, the only other modification I made was softening the tortillas by dipping them quickly into hot oil on each side before rolling them up. Yummy and delicious, it left my husband and I with some awesome left overs to bring to work!

I use frozen butternut squash which is already chopped and a jar of salsa verde from Trader Joes. Makes a quick, easy, and delicious weeknight meal that my 2 and 3 year old boys love!

I used the "emeril" enchilada sauce mentioned previously since I didn't have any tomatillos on hand. It was very good. I did kick it up a notch with some jalapenos in the squash/corn mix. My tortillas got really mushy. It all tasted good but I was expecting something that could be served as indivudual roll-ups not just a pile on the plate. Did I do something wrong or is this just the nature of an enchalada. I will make them again--or a variant of them :)

Very tasty. I cheated a bit, but all tolerable shortcuts for a Monday night after work: roasted my squash and made the filling the night prior, adding a bit of Mexican chili powder, some nutmeg and a good dose of salt and pepper; I then used Goya brand salsa verde rather than making the tomatillo sauce from scratch. But! It was very good, and I don't think making squash in advance hurt it at all. Popped this in the over after work and had a yummy dinner within 30 minutes. Of, and I didn't come close to using up all that cheese. I'm sure it'd be good but, I mean, come on. No one needs that much cheese. Quite tasty with maybe 2/3rds as much. Paired with some refried pinto beans with lime and cilantro and a salad with hearts of palm.

Being a professional chef, its hard for me not to play with the ingredients - especially after reading the reviews that the recipe was "bland" by some. Here 's what I did to PUMP up the flavor and really make the dish come alive: 1. Toss cubes of squash with oil, salt, pepper, cumin & chili powder & roast until lightly golden brown and tender. 2. To the filling add roasted corn (you can buy it frozen at TJ's) queso asadero or feta and green chiles. 3. To the Tomatillo Sauce - add heavy cream , Mexican Oregano, and reduce until thick. 4. To serve, sprinkle the tops of the enchiladas with pumpkin seeds and creme fraiche or Mexican crema & a side of black beans. Also great with a Mexican slaw.

Tried this last night and got rave reviews from the family - even my husband who's not too fond of Mexican cuisine. Like others, added some cumin, curry powder and a touch of cinnamon to the filling which produced a tasty, unusual blend of flavors. Since I was short on time, I belnded together some canned tomatillos with a can of green enchilada sauce instead of making the sauce listed in the recipe. Worked out fine.

Made this tonight with extra squash roasted for a different meal. I used frozen corn, and took the advice of previous reviewers and added chili powder, cinnamon and cumin. I used the cheese I had on hand, a mix of Cabot Habanero and Hunter's Sharp cheddars , and a little fresh mozzarella. I'll make this again and again. With canned squash or pumpkin it would make a quick and delicious weeknight meal.

Absolutely delicious. Cutting up the squash was pretty labor intensive, but the flavorful and unusual final product was worth the time.

Scrumptious! If you're looking for something different in a vegetarian dish, try this! The squash adds a sweet element in contrast with the zesty tomatillo sauce. I used blue corn tortillas for color and to save time, I used a canned tomatillo sauce instead of the posted recipe, which worked out fine. I think the recipe could use a little more heat (especially if you like a spicier enchilada). Next time I'll try a pepper jack cheese or some pickled jalapeno. I added a dollop of seasoned guacamole on the side instead of the sour cream. Great dish!

This was incredibly delicious. We used already cubed butternut squash (can purchase in 1# bags at Trader Joes) which makes it much more simple. Loved the corn in it - gave another dimenion to the dish, and good texture. Used tomatillo's fresh from the garden - wonderful. Also used plain yogurt on top versus sour cream. Highly recommend.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe very closely, except that for the tomatillo sauce I roasted the tomatillos and the jalapeno in a dry skillet until their skins were black, then removed the seeds from the jalapeno. I will definitely make this again, but next time I might try using canned pumpkin instead of butternut squash, and maybe even cream corn instead of kernels. Using the fresh squash was fun though; I removed the seeds and roasted them with salt to sprinkle over the enchiladas. This could be a regular for me.

These are amazingly tasty! I made some for the vegetarian's at my last dinner party, and they ended up being a favorite of the meat eating crowd as well, and especially the kids! I've made them several times now with canned corn and store bought "gourmet" tomatillo sauce, to equally tasty results. Tips for feeding enchiladas to kids: they don't care what the enchiladas look like, so I layer the tortillas with the ingrediants as if I were making lasagna. Easy, fast, and still delicious!

My fiance is still raving about these enchiladas days after I made them--begging for a repeat. I was generous with the tomatillo sauce (I use Alice Waters' recipe which calls for roasting them) and only jack cheese since I didn't have mozzarella on hand, and frozen corn (which makes it crunchier in the end) and they turned out delicious.

I was absolutely flabbergasted by this recipe. Yes, flabbergasted. During "production" my hopes grew dim...I just wasn't sure how it was all going to come together. It was amazing!!!! My husband ate three and said they were "fantastic." I will say, I made the following slight alterations: Added cumin, cayenne, cinnamon, and finely chopped pecans (probably a good 1/3 of a cup). Sprayed the tortillas with canola and heated them in a pan until they became browned in spots and a little more manageable. Roasted the tomatillos, not boiled (really made a difference, come from someone who usually boils). Lastly, I added the tomatillo sauce to the top after 10 minutes of baking. They were substantial and the tortillas were still chewy, not mushy. I would eat the rest today, but the husband already took them to work.

I've made this twice now and can't get enough of it! The sweetness of the squash is a welcome change from a typical bean enchilada. I added grilled chicken into the squash mixture for a little more substance.

Per previous reviewers, this recipe needed some help. I used the "mexicali style" corn and upped the garlic and onion. I added pecans, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cumin and chili powder. I didn't bother with the tomatillo sauce, and used 2 jars of Desert Pepper's Salsa Verde instead. I also used the Mexican blend shredded cheese. I served this meal to two die hard carnivores with Classic Red Rice (also from this site) and a corn and black bean salad. Corona rounded everything out nicely.

A bit more "stuff" goes well here. I chopped in a red pepper and put it in shortly after the onion and garlic--it adds to the color palette for the dish nicely. After you have this together, what about the spices? I threw in 1-1/2 tbsp. of chili powder, 3/4 tbsp. of cumin, 2 tsp. of cinnamon (to pick up the sweetness of the squash)--you may want more. When all is said and done though, this is great vegetarian Mexican cooking, two words which often don't coexist tastefully or with satisfying results. They do here.

I have made this several times. The original is good, but if you leave out the garlic and play with the filling (adding maple, or crushed toasted nuts) and then top with sage cream sauce (also on this site) in the final 8-10 minutes of baking, it is a step away from divine.

Tomatillo sauce is pretty bland to my taste, but tomatillos are a wonderful base for all manner of SW sauces. I'd roast the tomatillos with a jalapeno. Add some cumin, chile powder, purchased mango sauce, and a little sugar to make it just slightly sweet. I think sweet it is a better match for squash.

Definitely repeatable! Used garden zuhhini and Trader Joes butternut squash. Substituted Emeril Lagasse's Enchilada sauce for the tomatillo. This sauce is fantastic, and I credit the woman on the CHicken Enchiladas recipe who provided it, since I have been using ever since. Easy and terrific. Here it is: Enchilada Sauce - Emeril Lagasse 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon flour 1/4 cup chili powder (or a little less) 2 cups chicken stock 10 ounces tomato paste 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt In a medium saucepan heat oil, add flour, smoothing and stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook for 1 minute. Add chili powder and cook for 30 seconds. Add stock, tomato paste, oregano, and cumin. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook for 15 minutes. The sauce will thicken and smooth out. I also used flour tortillas to soak up more sauce.

My husband and I both loved this wonderfully spicy recipe. It will become a regular side dish to accompany Mexican and Southwestern dishes in our house. I made half of this recipe and the tomatillo sauce but substituted 2 zucchini from our garden and steamed and mashed them, as I was in a hurry. I used fresh corn scraped from the cob. Next time I may roast the zucchini. With a glut of zucchini Ive been trying a zucchini recipe nearly every day. I loved this since it was not the usual zucchini, eggplant and tomato combination. A real find!

This was delicious. I doubled the sauce, using a combination of fresh and canned tomatillas. I added toasted sunlower seeds to the filling for a little crunch and did not use sourcream.

This dish is wonderful, and has become a favorite since I made it as a vegetarian thxgiving meal a few years ago. It's really not hard to make, just a bit of waiting time for the squash. The nice thing is that you can make the filling ahead of time, and assemble the enchiladas when you're ready. I don't make the tomatilla sauce, I have to admit: I use a local fresh tomatilla sauce/green salsa, which cuts down on prep time. I've also tried some bottled sauce, which has been fine -- just make sure it's still a bit sweet, not just spicy. Finally, I don't garnish with olives.

I loved the combination of sweet squash and tangy tomatilo sauce. I used crumbly mexican enchilada cheese and that worked well. I halved the tomatillos and pepper and put them under the broiler, skin side up, until blackened - you get a wonderful roasted flavor in the sauce. Needed more sauce, though. The tortillas broke down too much and I'd either fry them in oil before stuffing or add the sauce halfway through the baking. Good stuff!

Very good. I used canned tomatillos with great results. The filling made twice as many enchiladas as the recipe said it would--and it all got eaten! Do not use fresh mozzarella (like I did).
