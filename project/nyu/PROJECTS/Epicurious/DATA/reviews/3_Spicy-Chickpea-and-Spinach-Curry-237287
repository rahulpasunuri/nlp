I like to make this with sauteed onion and garlic and a can of coconut milk makes it really nice. I probably add more salt and spices too.

Chose as it was 3 forks and 91% would make again. Husband said 'ok, not favorite'. Myself, I will not make again. Love curry, the taste and the smell... this had neither... waste of time and ingredients.

My husband made this with canned chikpeas and made few modifications - it was the perfect blend of healthy and tasty - the right combo of spices and tomatoes, and the spinach & chikpeas were cooked to perfection!

Made this on the stovetop with canned chichpeas. Next time I'll blend once cooked through, and add an additional cup chickpeas and 1/2 cup diced cherry tomatoes for better texture.

We made this as written except for the following minor changes: 1 can reg organic chopped tomatoes 1 can w/green chilis organic chopped tomatoes half a teaspoon more garam masala and we omitted the last addition of salt. added 1 1/2 cups of water to chickpeas while cooking at various times when they looked too dry. I served this with a bismati cooked with cinnimon, currants, and sultanas. It was really, really good. Not bland, but not what I would call spicy or medium - more of an Indian mild. My 20-month old loved it diluted with extra rice.

Took almost all the suggestions: Sauteed onions & garlic, roasted cauliflower and coconut milk. Also added ground coriander. It tasted a little flat before that addition. With all those things added it was a winner! Even the meat- lovers had good things to say about this dish.

No fork rating because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. First of all, I cooked on the stovetop. I started by frying the spices in a splash of oil, then added everything else, but I upped the spinach (9 oz.), reduced the tomatoes (one 15-oz. can), and used one 15-oz. can of chick peas. It was super easy, quick, and far from bland!

I absolutely loved it. I did follow the advice and added coconut milk, but I am not sure if it made any difference. Very yummy and healthy meal.

I had to make a few changes to this due to what I had in the cupboard - fresh chopped grape tomatoes and tinned chickpeas. Cooked for 1 hour on the stove top, and used curry powder instead of turmeric plus garam masala. I was surprised by how good it tasted, as it was so simple to make. Will be making it again!

This is another recipe I decided to make just because it allows me to use my slow cooker. Following other recos on this site I added one can of low fat coconut milk. Rave reviews. Healthy and delicious, what more do you want.

This was good, decent food, and easy for it. I put a chopped onion and carrot into the slow cooker, along with canned chickpeas as I had them available. I definitely wouldn't call it spicy as written, but as I had a jar of Hot Mango Pickle open, I put a few spoonfuls of that in and it helped a lot in that department! I also richened things up by stirring some plain greek yogurt into the finished dish.

I never follow recipes to the letter; but I looked at this, and basically made it with some onion and garlic added in, and MOST IMPORTANT - a can of coconut milk. I used reduced fat coconut milk and also tossed in zucchini and baby corn. It was great. It tasted really boring and like diet food without the coconut milk, I'm sorry to say.

Thanks to all the previous reviews of this recipe, I made a fantastic dish. I roasted the cauliflower first in cumin and coriander. Then sauted onion and garlic, to which I added the rest of the ingredients, including canned chickpeas. The two things that took this recipe from good to great were using my immersion blender at the end and adding a few tablespoons of vinegar.

Made it together with a friend from India. She made some changes: finely chop the spinach. substitute fresh tomatoes (2-3 medium whole). Add a pinch of red pepper flakes/ground red pepper. dish works well with rice. We really enjoyed it!

Good, but could be better. I added some chopped onion and pinch of cayenne. Next time I think I'll puree it before adding spinach.

this is really fantastic, but i did add one chopped onion, 3 cloves of crushed garlic and red pepper flakes. It makes a lot which is a good thing since we like leftovers. will make again

Absolutely delicious, especialy if you grind your spices yourself. Particularely good for a Weight watcher diet since one cup is worth between 4 and 5 points.

Have made this several times and really like it for the ease of the slow cooker and nutritive value.. not to mention it's vegetarian! Good flavors. Don't be shy with the spices and kick it up a bit if you know you like spicy. Our home made curry works well with this.

Blah. I've prepared this twice, thinking that maybe I made a mistake the first time. No mistake -- if prepared according to the recipe, this is bland and just plain dissappointing. If you want a nice, healthful dish with chickpeas, try the Curried Red Lentil and Swiss Chard Stew with Chickpeas, also on Epicurious. It is a MUCH better recipe.

Great basic recipes, like the previous reviewer said. The Garam marsala sauce is absolutely essential. it really made the dish outstanding as opposed to other curry dish I tried. I also added a bunch of stuff too: 2 lbs of chicken, used 3 cans drained 10oz organic garbanzo beans, additional can of tomatoes, couple onions and 3 mashed garlic. Same amount of spice, but add more salt in proportion to the addtional stuff. Exceptional!!!

This is a very good base of a receipe, but I added a lot of other spices to make it more flavourful: 1/4 chopped onion, 1 tsp. curry powder, 1 tsp. minced ginger, 3 cloves garlic, 1 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. chili powder. Also, I've made it in a stock pot and crock pot and both times I threw everything in at the outset except for the spinach and cilantro. Also, you need one whole bunch of cilantro. And I used 3 cups of water b/c I like a soupier version to dunk my naan in.

This is a really great combination of flavors and makes a delicious, healthy meal. It's a new staple in my kitchen.

Excellent recipe, nice combination of flavors, plus lowfat and high fiber. We served it over brown rice. We wanted it "spicy" so we added a tsp of cayenne. Also caution - error in recipe- you need to add much more than 1 cup of water to crockpot for cooking- we added 5 cups.

I had to add a ton of spice, garlic, onion and more cilantro to make this remotely flavorful. That said, the spinach and chickpea combo is great. I also added a splash of vinegar at the end to liven up the acid a little more. Frozen spinach, canned chickpeas and tomatoes make this a wonderful, inexpensive and healthful dish.

This is awful. The taste is bland and the multi-stage cooking process defeats the point of using a slow cooker for convenience.

This was very good and so simple - - I didn't have to chop a thing! The spices and tomatoes make a rich gravy. I used canned chickpeas (2 cans) like another reviewer and it only took 30 minutes to cook in a heavy pot. (Since I work all day, I only have time for 8 hour slow cooker recipes). I don't agree with other reviewers to double the spice...I added a little more of everything than it called for and it had a slightly bitter taste. I would keep the same levels as listed but maybe add a little cayenne pepper for some hot mouthfeel. I also added some freshly crushed garlic for additional flavor. This was so easy and healthy and it makes a lot of leftovers - - I'm looking forward to lunch tomorrow!

This was pretty good; I too added more of all spices and a bit of cayenne pepper but still seemed like there was something missing flavor-wise. I used an immersion blender to give it a more creamy "paneer" consistency. I will make this again, but I will do some research to try and find what else I could add (maybe garlic?) to make it a little more flavorful. But the ease and overall taste of the dish is great!

This was so good and I even cheated. I used 1 15oz can of chickpeas (drained), 1 lb frozen spinach (defrosted, drained, and chopped), 1 28oz can of diced tomatoes (drained), and only 1/2 of the salt. I dumped everything in a saucepan and simmered for 20 minuets. Delicious, quick and easy.

This is great! Served it with cilabtro quiano. I beefed up the spice a bit, the broth is really great. May even add a little cayenne next time. The second time I made this I doubled up the spices and the tomatoes and added cauliflower, peas, broccolli, zuchini. Don't be afraid to add curry also. This is a great dish! edit this note :

I thought this was a fantastic and very easy dish to make. I used canned chickpeas instead of dried ones to save time and, no, they did not get mushy in the slow cooker. I served it with brown rice, like other raters did. I will definitely be making this meal again!

This is wonderful. I nearly burned the chickpeas, because I left them in the slow cooker all day and didn't add water, oops. Otherwise, it is great and it freezes well. Served over brown rice.

I made this dish in a hurry with canned chickpeas, and fresh tomatoes, zucchini and spinach from the garden. It stewed for one hour and we served it over whole wheat couscous. I cut out the salt and pumped up the spices. Delicious and fast!

My husband's comment upon tasting this dish was, "This is one of those meals that tastes both healthy and delicious!" Don't be afraid to be liberal in adding the spinach--it wilts down very quickly. Overall a tasty meal!

We loved this! I agree with Cali in that extra soaking time was beneficial...although it cooked up in just 3 hours, too. Super good flavor, perfect spiciness, but I also agree with bluebetsy that a teeny bit more cayenne would be a nice tweak. Don't be shy with the spices:-) We served it over basmati rice. Will def make this again!

This one has become a staple in my house. It is easy, nutritious, cheap, and feeds 2 of us for 3 nights or more.We're both in weight loss mode right now and this recipe is very filling, pretty low-cal, and has essentially no fat! I suggest extra soaking time for the beans. A full 24 hours or more. I cook the beans for about 4 hours, add the tomatoes and spices and cook for another 2 hours on high, then partially mash the beans with a potato masher for thicker texture. Finally, I add the spinach, turn it to low and cook for the last hour.

I was wondering if it would work to use canned chickpeas instead of dried ones that had been soaked? Would it turn out as well or would the beans get mushy in the slowcooker?

This recipe is a good start. I added more of all the spices as well as some heat in the form of cayenne pepper. I will make it again as it was easy but it does need some tweeking.
