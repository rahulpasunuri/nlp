Made this for Thanksgiving, and it got all the moms in the room all curious as to what was in it... Not nutmeg, not cinnamon... Very delicious indeed, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that amount of butter, definitely could have cut down on that.

I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The flavors are fabulous, everyone loved it,and wanted the recipe. This will be a tradition at our house. Way more healthy, then all the overly sweet marshmallow topped kind.

This was really good, and the citrus smelled wonderful. I didn't have coriander seeds, so I just used ground coriander and didn't toast it. I just spread the mixture on the sweet potatoes early and roasted them longer with the mixture on them.

tasty, though a bit more work than I like. But I must admit that while I enjoy cooking things need to not take too long or involved too many steps. Not all fries got crispy, but it was also my first time making sweet potato fries so I am not holding it against the recipe. Only 3 stars because of lengthy process. ENjoyed the kick of coriander and zests. A do it again for special occasions.

This recipe has become a family favorite. We love the flavor that goes so well with the rest of the turkey dinner. I also squeeze orange juice on the yams before cooking. Watch them they tend to get a little to brown. Butter can be made the day before so it is quick and easy the day of.

I made this as part of my vegetarian Rosh Hashanah brunch. Very good. The two two-year-olds that were there loved it. Didnt take long at all to make. i added a little more sugar and squeezed orange into the butter mixures to have a little more glaze

I might have overcooked the coriander seed because it tasted a little burnt. Even so, it added an interesting twist. It's a really good recipe. My guests loved it. I found myself licking the flavored butter off my fingers way before the yams got to the oven. Yum.

This is not really a fair review since I simplified this to what i had on hand: 3 sweet potatoes (orange flesh) 1 T pre-powdered coriander 3 T olive oil Salt a little bit of grated lemon rind, which I could not taste. Sliced thin. Tossed together, roasted 25-ish minutes and It was very tasty. Will definitely use this flavor combo again.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and the flavors were good, but the presentation was fair at best. I think next time I will try mashing after roasting, and then adding the butter.

DELICIOUS! The best yams I've ever had. The coriander and citrus are so fragrant - my kitchen smelled great all afternoon.

Too much orange flavor. If I make it again I will limit the amount of orange peel and add a touch more butter

WONDERFUL! It did not need to roast as long as the recipe indicated. I roasted for 25 minutes, added the butter which I had melted first and spooned it on, and then cooked only another 5 minutes. It probably could have used even less time--- maybe a total of 25 minutes. Tasted fantastic.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit! Loved, loved, loved the citrus flavors with the sweet potatoes. I used the "make-ahead" tips, and the dish turned out just fine. Would definitely make again!

Delicious. I used a little less sugar based on earlier reviews. We are adding it to the "family favorites" and having it again this week.

I just loved the flavors. I think I over roasted the yams as they weren't as firm as I like, but the flavor was delicious. I served it for Thanksgiving and all enjoyed them. Would increase temp and roast for shorter period, so browned but still firm inside. I do not like candied yams because they are too sweet and this is a great alternative.

i don't know how my coriander butter came out tasting so bad, so I re made the entire recipe and still didn't like it. I wonder if I didn't cook the seeds if that would make the flavor less toasted and more aromatic?

I have been looking for a sweet potato recipe for #%^&@ years and finally found it! This is just INCREDIBLE! True, I doubled all the topping ingredients, but between the aroma of orange,crunch of the coriander and the flavors of everything bursting in your mouth, this recipe is a keeper! (I made a soup inspired by this dish, topped with gingered creme fraiche that was equally winning!)

OK, so I didn't make the dish quite to specification. I decided to peel the yams, I made the dish fresh the night it was eaten, and my baking time was less than the recipe called for. The results were fabulous. Some reported that the yams were dry, but that wasn't a problem when I made them. They had just the right amount of sweetness, too. Admittedly the rest of the family didn't care much for them, but I think that had more to do with the fact that the dish was yams than anything else, and they're not big fans of vegetables. I thought the dish was far better than those marshmallow yams I grew up with.

Made this dish when it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It was so good, I'm serving it for Christmas dinner.

This was quite simple to prepare and was a big hit at Thanksgiving. We're serving them again at Christmas. And they're even better if you prepare them ahead and then reheat them. The flavours are great.

Dry and tough, and they weren't overbaked. The flavor was pretty bland, even with the butter.

Best sweet potatoes we've had in years- everyone loved them and we actually had no leftovers. They were very tasty and we will make them again (and again).

We made the entire menu that went with these yams. The texture was dry and tough. The coriander butter was the only saving grace and that was not enough.

This was the most original and stimulating dish on the table at this year's Thanksgiving!

This was much sweeter than I expected it to be, due to the orange zest. Smells absolutely wonderful coming out of the oven. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was quite good and went over well, and I'll make it again, but I was expecting more of a savory sweet potato dish, and it was quite sweet. I used ground coriander, and toasted that lightly instead of grinding my own. Also used all the do-ahead ideas, which made the day-of tasks easy.

This was very good. I would make it again even though I sentimentally prefer them mashed.
