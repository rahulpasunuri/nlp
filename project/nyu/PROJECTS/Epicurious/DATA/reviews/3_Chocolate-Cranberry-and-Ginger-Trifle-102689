Unless you are a serious ginger fan, avoid or amend this recipe. It was too too too much for me, and I *like* ginger. The rest of my family is less adventurous, so after scurrying to have this thing put together for Thanksgiving dinner, no one ate it. My nieces were resourceful enough, however, to dig the chocolate pudding out and eat it plain. I won't be making this again, but if you make it, I'd recommend cutting the ginger by 3/4 or omit entirely.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a major disappointment! None of my 7 guests cared for it, it really fell flat. It was also very expensive and time consuming to make: the cranberries here were $3 per bag, the ginger $6, add the whipping cream etc.(I use organic, and eggs)...the Grand Marnier and high quality chocolate - $28; with Grand M - $54. I could have purchased a beautiful dessert at a high quality patisserie. As I love to make wonderful, festive desserts I felt disappointed and foolish for wasting so much time and money on this; 3/4 of it sits in the fridge, I may toss it. Sorry for such a scathing review but I just don't see how people love this! (I carefully reviewed the recipe to see if I missed something or erred, and I did not).

I agree with the cook in Austin - the flavors in this dessert can be overwhelming, discordant, and abrasive. The cranberry sauce is the main culprit because the balance between the sugar and the ginger is off, I think. While I'm sure ginger-lovers adore this dessert, even the ginger-neutrals at my party didn't care for it. My guests ended up scooping all the cranberry out and just eating the chocolate pudding and poundcake. I'd recommend scaling back the ginger in the cranberry sauce, and using the sauce sparingly.

I have made this recipe over 10 times. It is the best and has now become a "classic" holiday dish in my family. I also suggest using bittersweet chocolate from Ghirardeli, and pre-chopped ginger from the Ginger People. Make the cranberry sauce a day ahead and the pudding too. It makes everything less tiresome. My whipped cream always falls flat and I end up using canned whipped cream on the top of the trifle for appearance sake.

I've now made this 4 times for various holiday parties. The final result always looks spectacular, yet it is easy to assemble. Nearly everyone loves it, save perhaps those who aren't fond of ginger, but for the most part it's been a huge success. I think eliminating the ginger or cutting back on it would still yield a great dessert.

I made this recipe this past Christmas and it was a huge success. I love ginger so I used a ginger bread instead of the pound cake for real holiday flavor. I also took the advice of an earlier reviewer and made another version using vanilla pudding and it was heavenly. This is a very unique and impressive holiday dessert.

I made this for Thanksgiving and found it to be abrasive and inedible. No one in the large party dining at my house ate it. They did, however love the rest of the epicurious recipes I used. There were not enough good flavors to overpower the bad ones.

Delicious combination of flavors and a beautiful holiday dessert presentation! I was a bit leery of too strong ginger flavor so only used 1/3 cup each time the recipe called for 1/2 cup of ginger. I also chopped the ginger into very small pieces so one would not get too much of the flavor in a single bite. I think next time, I'll use the full amount of ginger dicing it into very small pieces again. People seemed to like it, several had second helpings.

I made this for a holiday brunch -- everyone loved it. Since some were allergic to chocolate, I made one half with chocolate pudding and one half without the chocolate. Though I love chocolate, I thought the vanilla pudding complimented the cranberries and ginger better. Also, I used slightly less sugar than called for for both the cranberry mixture and the pudding. It was still very sweet, so I would not recommend using all of the suggested sugar.

Omitted the giner altogether as I don't like it at all. Very easy to assemble making all separate parts the day before. Watch the pudding as it thickens suddently. Made a day ahead to let the yummy falvours meld together.

I made it again for a baby shower and it got rave reviews. Seven people asked me for the recipe. This time I used pre-chopped ginger from the Ginger People. It cost about $6 for 5 ounces. It made the trifle taste better.

I first made this for a millenium New Year's Eve Party, and again just last night for an after Thanksgiving turkey chili party. It is easy to make and yummy. I did cut the crystallized ginger out of the pudding -- I am not that big a fan of ginger and it is costly. And, my oranges would just not give up any zest, so that was missing. Even so, it was a fabulous dessert and a big hit. Can't wait for another excuse to make it.

I have made this twice for Christmas so far. It is beautiful and wonderful because it is not overly sweet. My guests loved it!

A beautiful and delicious Christmas dinner dessert. I agree that the alcohol was a little much (I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier). I found that the pudding took more than three hours to get good and cold.

Delicious dessert and the presentation was quite impressive. I definitely would cut down on the Grand Marnier next time, however.

I made this dessert for a party over the holiday... Although I had a significant amount left over (it makes a lot), I thought it was delicious and a lovely presentation. If you really like cranberries, you'll like this recipe. The chocolate filling was a nice compliment to the tartness of the cranberries. I would make it again.

I had this at a Christmas Eve Party. If you love cranberries (as I do) this is WONDERFUL! A interesting blend of flavors. I can understand how perhaps some may have pre-conceived expectations ... It was not too sweet and not too tart. Just WONDERFUL !!!

I should have stayed with the Raspberry Marsala from 1995. This was too "pricey"--- ginger $21.00, and Grand Marnier --- $25.00, for just a so-so desert. It was consumed, but I would not recommend this recipe, nor repeat the effort. However, I do appreciate all the efforts, month after month, to come up with new versions to keep us happy. Thanks!!

I was very dissapointed in this recipe. A lot of work for a soso out come.

I made this dessert for a sorority dinner function, and quite honestly, I was embarrassed. The amount of Grand Marnier called for in the recipe was so much, that in my opinion, it made the entire trifle inedible. The cranberry layer was also too tart and overpowering. The chocolate layer did not need the candied ginger - it really didn'tdo anything to enhance it. I'm known as a fabulous dessert maker - and this was a total failure.
