Very good...and, since there's no top crust, there was no huge empty space where the apples cooked down. The crust was not too difficult to make or to work with, and it tasted good and was reasonably flaky. I used 1/3 C brown sugar and 1/3 C white sugar in the filling, along with 2 tsp Penzey's Apple Pie Spice. Two Mutsu apples and two...some other kind, reddish, I can't remember. :) And I used some whole-wheat flour in the topping, and it was still delicious. I actually didn't use all the topping, though--next time, I'll just make about 2/3 as much. I baked it at 350 for about an hour to avoid over-browning.

I love to cook and bake and this is the BEST thing I've ever made. OMG it's amazing!! I made homemade ice cream with it too. It's the perfect sweetness and tart with the apples. Oh I used about 7 apples. This will be a complete hit at any party!!

Making this pie for the second time today. I used pillsbury crust but followed the recipe for the filling and topping. The filling was perfect, sweet, tart cinnamon apples that weren't runny. The topping was the dutch style we love, crumbly cinnamon streusel. This will be the recipe we use for apple pie from now on.

This pie was fabulous! I followed all of the instructions, made the crust too. Everything turned out perfect - I wouldn't change a thing. My husband rated this as possibly the best dessert I've ever made.

It was a hit at my house. So good I had to make it 2 days in a row. I used green apples and instead of making the crust, I used the pillsbury doughboy cinnamon rolls, cut them into thin slices and pressed it down into the baking pan. It was deeeeeeeelicious!!!! Hope this little tip helps :) Enjoy!

This is a great recipe and is perfect for customizing to what you like. I didn't make the crust so I can't comment on that, but the crumble recipe is something I've been looking for a long time! I added 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/3 c dark brown sugar, and 1 tsp cocoa to the filling. Also added 1 tsp cocoa to the crumble. Came out amazing!

First off, this is my first ever "American" style apple pie - I bake a lot of mostly french style tartes (with a sablé crust)and other desserts. For this crust, I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this website, which was perfect. I used 8 medium sized granny smith apples, (about 3 lbs) in a glass pie dish. Although it seems like a lot, I found the cooking time on this pie to be right on. I baked the initial 40 min at 400 on "pastry bake" where the heat comes from the bottom of the oven, so it didn't brown too much. I used "regular" bake for the remaining 45 min. at 350, which allowed it to brown just enough. After cooling about 1.5 hours, it was still too warm/soft to serve, but did so anyway just to try it. It was very good the first night, but the next day it was great! I am still not a huge fan of cinnamon, but everyone else loved it and I would make this again, just because it looked so impressive. When cool, it sliced up nicely and looked just like the picture - beautiful!

This recipe is fantastic if you're a person trying to create your own apple pie recipe. It provided a perfect base for my rum apple pie. I used Winesap apples instead and added 1/3 c. of light brown sugar and 3T dark rum to the filling mix, as well as 1/2 t. of fresh grated nutmeg. The resulting pie was amazing and delicious and my family devoured it. Can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving!

YUMMMM!!!! I nearly ate a whole pie myself. :) I used 5 gala's and 2 fuji. That amount of apples yielded 2 amazing pies. I also used 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, and 2 tsp vanilla extract, as another member suggested. And I baked the pies at 450 degrees for 40 minutes, as another member did. And the result was amazing. Do check your pies at the 25 or 30 minute mark if you bake it at the high temperature, for it will get dark. Use foil to cover up the pies to prevent it from burning.

DELICIOUS!!! I made two slight changes - added zest of half a lemon to the filling and for the crust used 3/4 butter and 1/4 lard. The filling is deliciously buttery and the topping is as well. YUM.

This pie is phenomenal! I accidentally baked it at 450° for 40 minutes. It was perfectly done and crispy! This pie yielded lots of textures actually. I enjoy that. It was rich and very cinnamon-y. I also substituted 1/3 cup of the white flour for white whole wheat flour and it came out great. I switched out some white flour for wheat flour in the topping too. I will definitely make this again and again.

Rating: 4
Mmmmm delicious. I find the best pie crusts use only butter. It's richer and flakier. It also helps to brush a little melted butter on the crust before baking it, so you get a nice golden color (be sure to cover the edges with tinfoil!). I found I didn't have enough crumb topping, so I would recommend making a little more than the recipe calls for. A definite crowd-pleaser!

I had a hard time making the crust although I believe I followed the recipe correctly. I ended up doubling on the flour and other crust ingrediants. It was very easy to bake... turned out wonderful.. my guests loved it!

The hardest thing about making this apple pie is peeling and cutting the apples. I made the crust and the topping in the food processor. I added a little freshly ground nutmeg to the rest of the filling ingredients. This pie is wonderful with lots of cinnamon-laced apple flavor. I will definitely be making this pie again.

I am not a pie baker but I decied to try anyway. I searched high and low for an apple pie recipe and found one here. I used a store bought crust, granny smith apples and added a bit of vanilla, allspice and nutmeg to the filling. I made the crumble and baked as directed. Upon tasting, the crumble was delish, the apples were just right (cut down baking time though) but the taste of the filling left something to be desired. The filling tasted a little bland and really tart. Maybe I should have mixed the apples with golden delicious and added more cinnimon. Overall, this is a pretty good pie but needs some southern tweeking.

Rating: 4
I bought a pre-made crust but made the rest of pie by the recipe. I will say that I didn't need to cook the pie as long as the recipe called for. I did 25 minutes at 450 although my oven always cooks a little fast. A truly excellent apple pie. Not too watery and the filling was perfect and was almost like caramel. When I was putting the apples into the tin I didn't use all of the apples (based on a few of the comments) and in hindsight I wish I had.

Rating: 4
I was very skeptical about the cooking time for this pie. I started out with 10 min at 400 and then 40 min at 350 and it was perfect. I used a different crust as well (the recipe on this site called flaky pie crust). I used all organic ingredients and added a few pinches of nutmeg. This pie was very yummy and was a huge hit with my guests.

Rating: 2
I was a little disappointed, after so many "best pie I've ever eaten" comments. The apples were mushy, even though the pie was removed 10 minutes early, and the topping was dark brown sugary, not enough "crumb". I know there's something out there that is better. I won't be making again,but if I were, I would use 5 apples (I used six and it was too much), I would cook much less than the recommended time, and I would alter the crumb topping so that it had more crumb and less sugar. It's edible, and that's why I gave it 2 stars.

i substituted the butter pie crust. the pie crust could've used more flavor/flakiness, but the filling and topping were excellent and actually pretty easy. next time will try the topping tossed with crushed pecans and oatmeal for more texture.

I've made several different apple pie recipes over the years, but this was by far my favorite. The crumbled topping was the best aspect of this cake. It browned beautifully and it was a delight pick up little crumbs to eat here and there while it cooled. The crust, with its tangy addition of vinegar, was excellent. I used granny smith apples out of convenience (they were on sale) and it tasted great.

This is an amazingly good pie. The only problem I had is that 3 1/14 pound of apples is too much. I left out two apples and still just barely had room for the slices and topping.

Oh wow. This is truly great. The crust was perfect, the crumble oh-so-crumbly, the filling beyond delicious. I was fortunate enough to get to make it from apples from my back yard, with my two little angels helping to pick the apples, then my 8-year old helping to peel and the 4-year old "testing" the apples to make sure they were all OK. I didn't see that in the recipe, but I highly recommend it!!

Rating: 4
Made this for the first time and it looks and tastes great. Only slight change I made was to use about a pound of golden delicious apples to 2 1/2 pounds of granny smith. I thought the golden delicious might break down a little more. Results were great. I noted someone else said they always make extra crumb topping. The recipe produces a nice layer that fully tops the pie. One might say one can't improve on perfection. That said, I might make 50% more crumb next time to create an even denser topping. A half-cup of old-fashioned oats would lighten up the crumb a bit.

This is the only apple pie I make, and I make it twice a year as requested. This year I used the Cortland apples that my kids picked on a pre-school trip, and the pie turned out great again! The only modification I used was 1/2 flour and 1/2 rolled oats in the topping, and added a touch of nutmeg and vanilla to the filling. Great suggestion from other reviewers to add the vanilla and nutmet to the filling. Best apple pie ever, and I don't even like apples!

Made 4 pies. Used local apples, they are on the trees longer and have higher sugar content. Outstanding pies, wish I had the resources to open up a production plant to mass produce this one. Warm that pie up in the micro, add some ice cream and a coffee ... was a little piece of heaven.

I couldn't decide if I wanted a crisp or a pie - this is the best of both worlds. Added spices to the apples and oats to the topping as noted in other comments. Used my own crust recipe and it worked out wonderfully. Will be making this again next time I go apple picking.

I baked this without a crust in a greased 10" corning quiche pan. With the help of many of the suggestions below, this was delicious. Without the addition of nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and vanilla, the filling would have been bland. I made the topping with 1/2 flour, 1/2 rolled oats which I have done with many other toppings and baked the dish according to directions for about 1 hour, 30 minutes, adjusting the foil on top as needed. This pie is better the next day when it has time to absorb the juices and firm up.

This is the first time I've ever baked a pie and apple crumb pies are my husbands fave so for his birthday, I decided to make this one. First I cheated and used a frozen crust as a time saver. While it tasted fine, the filling of this pie was too heavy for the crust and I was unable to serve the pie in any recognizable pie shape. However, that didn't change the fact that this was so yummy! I took other reviewers suggestions and added 1 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of allspice and 2 tsp of vanilla to the filling. I also used a combo of granny smith and fuji (they're my hubby's fave) - very tasty! I also covered the pie with foil after about 20 mins of cookiing as the top started to darken too much. Also only cooked about 25-30mins at the lower temperature. Definitely cover your baking sheet with foil as the filling will bubble over - saves on clean-up. All in all, a fab recipe that I will be making again!

I found this recipe on Epicurious a LONG time ago while searching for a recipe for an apple pie contest in work - in 2002. Since then, I make this pie ALL the time, usually around Thanksgiving or Christmas. It always gets rave reviews - it is by far, the best applie pie I have ever eaten!

I made this recipe yesterday - for our 4th of July BBQ. I cheated & bought a frozen crust. Have to say that the recipe was disappointing.

This is a great apple pie that tastes best cold the next day (when warm, it looks and tastes more like apple crumble). The filling is quick to make and is light- tasting - not too thick or syrupy like some pies. You really can't over-fill this pie. It seems like the recipe calls for too many apples, but they reduce in size as the pie bakes. I used 6 Granny Smith apples in my pie and will use 8 or 9 next time. I also added some all-spice and ginger to the filling. The crust is good but is nothing special - a store- bought crust would be just as good. The topping is definitely delicious though - well worth making. You should definitely substitute half a cup of oats for half of the flour as suggested by others!

Rating: 4
I've made this twice now and its to die for! I just left out the crust and bought a premade crust as a short cut. Be sure to not cook the pie too long as the apples get soft - that was my first mistake. The pie ended up like applesauce. Better safe than sorry and take it out JUST when it starts to bubble. GREAT pie though!

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this pie. I've made it 5 times now and it's been a hit every time. These are the changes I've made (generally taken from reading past reviews): CRUST: Substitute ice-cold cider for water. Add 1 t cinnamon. FILLING: Add 1t each of allspice, nutmeg, ginger; 1/2t cloves; 2t vanilla. I use 3 granny smith apples and 3 fuji apples. TOPPING: Use 1/2c flour, 1/2c oats or oatmeal. BAKING: Bake on a cookie sheet covered with tinfoil to catch the overflow. Drape the pie with foil before placing in the oven so topping doesn't get too brown. Time and temperature: 1) 40 min at 400deg with tinfoil. 2) 20 min at 350deg still with foil. 3) 25 min at 350deg WITHOUT foil to cook the topping.

Very good to the last bite, which of course I "the chef" had. The crust was nice & flaky, nice flavor. Added a bit more water (~1tsp) after allowing to sit in the refrig to stop it from ripping apart dur to dryness. My pie ended up not looking exactly like the one pictured, I believe I used more apples & diced them smaller. The end result is what matters - I will be making this again, and again & again. It's definitely a KEEPER!

This pie was SOOO good. I would cut a 1/4 cup of sugar out of it as it could have been a bit less sweet in combination with the crumble topping. It was easy to make and the crust did not burn at all, even with no foil. This will be a go to recipe for me from now on for an easy and quick dessert to make.

Thanks to earlier reviewers for the tips. I'm not a pie fan, but this was great! I found the crust difficult to work with, but one of my guests thought it was the best she'd ever tasted. I love the tip about letting the apple juices strain out and then reducing them as a syrupy add-in. I also split the topping (1/2 flour 1/2 oats), and them squeezed the mix into clumps before putting on top of the apples. No hard helmet, just yummy crumbs. Definitely a keeper!

This pie was easy and boy was it a hit. I made it the morning of Thanksgiving and warmed it in the oven after dinner. I used a frozen pie crust for convenience; I used all granny smith apples; I was nervous about mushy apples so I cut the apples thicker, into 12ths; I used 1/2 flour 1/2 oats for the topping however I should have added the oats AFTER running the ingredients through the food processor, so I added even more oats for texture; again, I feared overbaking so I baked at 400 only 30 minutes and then at 350 30 minutes, but the apples still seemed really crisp so I let it bake another 20... then after rewarming the apples got soft anyway! No matter... everyone loved the flavor. I liked it even better once it cooled, you could taste the apples more. Pile the apples high and use all the topping!

Perhaps my review is a bit premature,as I haven't eaten the pie yet. But I made two of them today, and am quite disappointed with the results!I think it'll taste fine, but the appearance is dreadful! The "sandy" topping looked like it had tiny black pepper specks in it, and overall looks like something a little kid made- one big mess! I've been making pies for 30 yrs, and have never had one look like this! the black specks are the bits of brown sugar that scorched.Only substitution I made, was in using dark brown sugar, instead of golden brown sugar.Maybe that was the problem. I did use foil around the perimeter to keep from burning, but the crumb topping was the problem. It just looks like a mass of near burnt sand, not the beautiful crumble type topping I'd envisioned. There are 187 reviews at the time I'm writing this, and most were in praise of this recipe.Only a few had problems with the topping. I'm embarrassed to bring these pies to the Thanksgiving feast tomorrow, because they look so bad; lucky I made a couple pumpkin pies too! If they taste great, then I'll come back to edit this review. Anyone have ideas about what the problem was?

Generally followed recipe. I just put this pie in the oven and believe it will be very impressive. Used bought crust. I saw somewhere on food channed to mix the apples with sugar and lemon and put in colander over bowl to catch juices. I left mine about an hour and a lot of juice collected. Reduced juices to caramel sauce that would heavily coat a spoon. Poured over apples in crust then added streusel topping. I'll do this to apple pies in future. I used 1/2 granny smith and 1/2 golden delicious. I'm going to call this my Obama Celebration Pie.

MUST use 1/2 oats and 1/2 flour for the topping. It is amazing. Also I am making this again for Thanksgiving and I plan on using 1/2 granny smith apples and 1/2 cortland. All cortland leaves a mushy pie. Also we added lemon zest to the apples. IT WAS A HUGE HIT!!!! Serve warm with a little vanilla ice cream...and everyone will want the receipe.

Just like kmac59, I'm not a fan of apple pie usually. This recipe was REALLY delicious, though! The crumb topping was my favorite part because using another crust on top is too dry for my taste. This was my first time ever baking a pie, so if I can manage not to mess it up, then I consider it an easy-to-follow recipe! My whole family loved it and they're begging me to make it again for Thanksgiving. I didn't really change too much for the recipe, except I used a store-bought Pillsbury crust and used 3/4 Baldwin apples and 1/4 Macintosh (I had gone apple picking and that's what I had).

Tasty! Loved the filling and the crumble. Good advice from previous reviewers to use 1/2cup flour and 1/2 cup oats in the topping. I had serious trouble rolling out the crust. I ended up pressing it into the pan. It wasn't as thick and flaky as a result. If I can figure out how to fix my crust, this would get 4 forks.

Excellent! The topping in this recipe is really the best part. I substituted oats for half the flour as suggested and it turned out great. The rest of the recipe is good but the resulting pie is even better with a few modifications. Using a combination of different apple varieties will yield a richer, more flavorful pie than just using any one variety alone. I used Granny Smith and Honey Crisp, in about a 50/50 mix. I also added about 1/2 tsp. ground allspice, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, and 1 tbsp. ground ginger to the filling. The extra spices create a more complex flavor, but in small doses won't overpower the apples. I also used a different pie crust recipe that had a little more salt in it so I reduced the salt in the topping to about 1/4 tsp. The slightly salty topping though is awesome against the tart apples. I will be using this as my default apple pie recipe from now on.

Rating: 4
AMAZING PIE! I had pre made shells, and fresh apples from a friends tree. I only followed the crumble part of the recipe and threw together the rest. I read the other reviews after making it, I would try the oats. I had a lot of crumble left over. It did take a lot longer to bake, but even with thin apples, it wasn't mushy. I think the trick was not to use all the crumble mixture. Will Make it again, and again, and try it with other fruit!

Rating: 2
After all the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed with this recipe. Maybe I sliced the apples too thin, but they came out mushy & overcooked-- more like applesauce pie. I couldn't get enough crust from the recipe to hang over the edge of my pie pan, and had to roll it so thin that you can't really taste it. The flavor is nice, but nothing to scream over. I don't think I'll be making this one again =(

Best apple pie I ever made. I usually make my own crust but this time I used a frozen Marie Callendars crust and I must admit it was pretty tasty. I did what other reviewers wrote - I used part flour & part oats on the topping. Wonderful - I wouldn't use more than 1/2 oats though . I was worried that 2 tablespoons flour wouldn't thicken the filling adequately so I used 3 tablespoons. I think 2 would have been fine because 3 tablespoons was a bit firm. Delicious and very attractive pie.

I would have given this more stars but there were a few issues with the pie. First I did not have enough apples so it didn't turn out big and pretty like the pix (my fault). I did add the 1/2 oats, 1/2 flour made the topping good. I am surprised no one mentioned the length of time you have to cook this pie. It makes the apples a little too mushy for my taste. I did use granny smith, but a hour and 25 minutes is a long time. Will make this again and make sure to cook it less. My family loved it

I had made this pie once before, following the recipe exactly and while it was good, I found the crumb too dry. Made it again today with the changes suggested here: oats, more butter, less sugar and my own addition of toasted chopped walnuts to the filling and crumb. Also used Boscop apples. The pie was fantastic, the crumb perfect! My husband's family gobbled it up and they know their apple pie.

Rating: 4
Actually I'd give this recipe 2 1/2 forks if I could. I used alot less sugar than called for. Next time I'll use Boscop apples, the Granny Smith were rather bland, and use some oatmeal in the crumble as recommended by others.

I was a little worried that I made the pie too high in the middle but it came out perfect and looked so pretty when I cut into it with the thin sliced apples. It got rave reviews, and many agreed it was the best apple pie they'd ever had! I didn't change the recipe at all..it was perfect as written.

Rating: 4
One of the best so far. I made these changes: for the filling in place of cinnamon: 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to apples and reduced cinnamon by 1/2 tsp. Reduced filling sugar to 1/2 cup and topping sugar to 1/3 cup. It sliced beautifully which made it easy to plate.

This pie is so good I made it twice in one week for company! All components come together beautifully: flaky crust, tender filling, and crunchy cinnamon topping. I agree about adding 1/2 c. oats with 1/2 c. flour for the topping. Perfect, perfect pie.

Fantastic!! My pie looked exactly like the picture and the recipe was extremely easy to follow. The only changes I made were to use 1/2c. oats with 1/2c. flour in the topping, plus I added a generous handful of candied ginger to the food processor when I was mixing the dry ingredients. The candied ginger made it sweetly spicy with complemented the tart warmth of the apples.

This pie was absolutely amazing. I cooked the filling a bit before putting the pie in the oven this makes the apples softer and yummier

Agreed it is outstanding - every piece was eaten at Thanksgiving! I did cheat and used a refrigerator rollout crust - but wanted to add for all to definitely bake on a cookie sheet b/c there was substantial overflow. I made the topping as written with just flour and thought it was great.

Outstanding pie! I froze it unbaked for four days, and then put it straight into the oven from the freezer. I found I only needed about 2 1/2 pounds of apples, and only half the crumble topping. The crust handled easily - I used it for pumpkin pie as well with great success.

I loved the taste of this pie. I should have sliced the apples more thinly, perhaps sixteenths would have worked better. The apples didn't seem cooked enough, even though I increased the baking time by half an hour. The topping came out very well, after making the suggested change to use oats. That was my first pie crust and I have to say that while it wasn't pretty, it was tasty. The overall presentation of the pie was impressive. For best results, serve at room temperature. The pie tended to fall apart when it was warmed.

Used oats & flour as suggested. Great texture, tart and sweetness. I wasn't sure how to pack the crumble in the beginning. Just pat all around and over the mixture and it was 'pasty' enough for the crumble to stay. Easy to make too.

First time I made a pie - it turned out perfect. I took the other reviewers advice and did 1/2 C flour and 1/2 oats for the topping - it was perfectly crunchy. My oven is a bit slow - so it took an extra 20 minutes to bake, also I put foil around the edges after the first 40 min - they seemed to brown quickly.

I served at our Canadian Thanksgiving meal, and everyone said it was the best apple pie they had ever had! I did not change a thing in the recipe, but used fresh Ontario Cortland apples. Don't be afraid to make a big heap of apples - they cook down and as the pie cools, everything settles.

This recipe produces an exceptional pie! Used 1/2 cup oats and 1/2 cup of flour in topping. Added 2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tbsp of cornstarch to apples.

Wow was this ever delicious. I used Macoun apples that I'd just picked so it was a bit less tart than I would have liked, though I did cut the sugar. Also, I didn't have any vinegar, so I skipped that. The crust was more crumbly than flakey, perhaps because of the lack of vinegar, but it was still very yummy. I ate all of it, even though I usually leave the crust edges. This will definitely become my standard apple pie recipe.

This is my tried and true apple pie recipe! I make this about 3 times a year, on my husbands birthday, for Thanksgiving, and one more time just because he loves it. I always have to make 2, because he gets stingy, and doesn't want to share his pie with our guests! I have now become 'famous' for 'my' pie!

This is the best apple pie ever. The first time I made it my family devoured it, so the second time, I made two. My husband peeled and cut the apples for me that time, and they were thicker than before, and I didn't make any adjustment to the baking time - so the apples were too firm. They were almost crunchy. The pies still tasted great, but I just put another one into the oven for our third try, and we made sure the apples were cut thin enough this time. Also - I put tinfoil on the pies the entire time, and they still turned golden, but not too brown. Don't be surprised that this makes a very tall pie. There's a lot of topping, but it's delicious. We really do think this is the best apple pie we've ever had. Instead of it being a variation on the standard two-crust pie, this has probably replaced it for our family.

Fabulous! Multiple guests said it was the best apple pie they had ever tasted.

My apples came out too mushy. I got compliments on the crust however, which made me very happy as it was the first crust I have ever made. I was nervous about making a crust but was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was and how good it tasted! In general though, the pie was not as impressive as I was hoping for, but still pretty good.

Rating: 3
I never thought I'd ever write this about a recipe (I'm a huge crisp fan and have been know to double the topping on recipes from time to time) but there's too much crumble. I think there's enough for two pies here. The filling is excellent - I think all Granny Smith is the way to go. The crust was pretty good, but a little tough in places (although it did turn out better than any rolled crust I've attempted before - my pastry skills are still evolving). Overall, a lovely pie. I'll either half the crumble or make two pies next time.

I had a store-bought graham cracker crust leftover from Thanksgiving that I thought might go with the apples and topping. Unfortunately, it burned a little -- those can't really stand being in the oven for 85 minutes, I suppose. But the filling and topping were outstanding enough for us to eat the pie up anyway, along with homemade vanilla ice cream!

Delicious. I've made this pie three times. Now I make two changes. I add 2 tablespoons more butter to crumble. The first time I followed recipe and it turned out a little dry. Also add 1/4 cup oatmeal to crumble and 1/4 cup less flour. The oatmeal makes it a little less dense. But, even without these changes it tastes great.

Rating: 4
I can't wait to make this again! Very easy (if your husband cuts all the apples) and beautiful too. I used grannies and braeburns. This was only my second time making any kind of pie, ever, and it was perfect. All raved that it was the best apple pie they'd had.

Rating: 4
I had an extra crust and thought I would add this to the Thanksgiving pantheon of pies. Just excellent, didn't have any apple-collapsing, and the topping is just delicious. Make sure to seal the topping well at the crust, and if you get a few drips, make sure to line your baking sheet with foil - you'll be glad you did! A Thanksgiving favorite and really easy too!

Easy and delicious...one guest said it was "hands down the best pie he ever had". Use the Granny Smith apple, the tart apple goes well with the sweet filling and topping.

Thanksgiving is never a 4 fork occassion in my family but this pie alone made up for it! It's a no-brainer and such a tummy pleaser! I followed the recipe except I shopped at the last minute and had to split my apples between grannies and fujis. It's such a sweet pie that I can see why it calls for all grannies. Needless to say, the fujis didn't stop us from licking the pie plate. Enjoy!

I'm a 21 year old foodie and only recently started really cooking beyond my microwave. So, this was my first pie effort. It was delicious and no one had a clue that I had never cooked one before! The recipe was very forgiving. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who said that this would be pretty hard to screw up. The cinnamon and Granny Smiths were a great, flavorful combination beyond what apple pies usually have to offer. (My mother was surprised that it called for Granny Smiths. Believe the recipe!)

I didn't give this a fork rating as I made too drastic of a change, but thought I would comment anyway! I did not use the bottom crust as I was making dessert for up to 100 people. I needed something on a larger scale than pies. It worked beautifully with the filling nad the topping. I did substitute half of the flour in the topping for old fashioned oats to give the topping a bit more substance since it was going to be a crisp, not a pie. It was delicious and received high marks, but I was leary of using Granny Smiths, and now wish I had used another apple. I THINK I like to bake with Fujis when I can't use Gravensteins. The Granny Smiths turned to apple sauce, which has been my past experience. I like an apple to maintain more shape. I even sliced them thicker and made sure I didn't overbake. So that would be my one true change... different apples. I did like the tartness of the Granny Smiths though, so definately stick to a tart apple.

Well I have finally made a pie that turned out right! the crust was cooked, nothing burned, the apples were perfectly cooked and not watery... YUM! I used medium sized Granny Smiths, cut in eighths. It flattened out after it cooled, so it looked nothing like the picture, but who cares! I was also worried because the crust tasted a bit salty before I cooked it, and I definitely used unsalted butter so that wasn't it... but once it was all put together it tasted divine. If you are scared to make pies like I was, try this one. Just make sure you keep your crust ingrediants as cold as possible; keep on' chilling the dough while you do the filling, and that the crust is cold when you pop it in the oven.

I made this recipe the first time it came out on bon appetit and have made it again probably a dozen times. It is the best apple pie I've ever had. To avoid a mushy filling, make sure you use firm apples, such as granny smith, and make the slices thicker than what the recipe calls for.

To be honest, I only made this pie because I had an extra crust and the ingredients to make the topping. I am so glad I did!

FANTASTIC! Made this pie for Thanksgiving and my family fell in love with it. My husband loved it so much that he gave up the cream cheese pumpkin roll he has requested for holiday dessert for the past 14 years and, this Christmas, he requested this pie instead. i cheated and used a pre-made crust and my only suggestion is take your time making the crumble and add the butter one pat at a time. the second time i made this i draped foil over it and removed it the last 25 minutes so the topping did not get too brown. OUT OF THIS WORLD!

The filling is one of the best I've ever had - sweet, tart, and just rich enough. I wasn't in love with the topping. Too dry for my taste (though it did improve after a night in the fridge). I would have preferred an oatmeal streusel-type topping.

We love this pie! I like it much better than a regular two crust apple pie. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly (except the crust) and it was great.

Either way, I will probably stick to this recipe whenever apple pie is on the menu. Yum.

Not only was this a delicious pie, it was one of the easiest pies to make. I've recently started using a device that peels,cores and makes a spiral sliced apple, and that made making this even easier. The crust rolled out easier than most, and though it's not as flaky as some, it's still tasty. The granny smiths are the perfect apple to combine with the topping. I didn't stray at all from the original recipe, and after making it with such success for a large thanksgiving crowd, I recommend not changing it if you're serving it to guests.

Delicious & relatively quick to prepare(though i DID cheat & used a pre-made pie-crust for time's sake.) I used Splenda in place of sugar & a"buttery spread" instead of real butter & it came out great!IMPORTANT: put butter(or"butter")for crumble in your processor (i had a magic bullet) ONE at a time. Just 1 too many will turn it to dough & you'll have to start from scratch.

This was unbelieveable, but it called for way too much filling, I would cut it down to 3/4 of what it called for. I used Honey Crisp apples instead of the Granny Smith. I think it came out better that way. I also drizzled some carmel on top too and it made it complete.

Great pie. To cut time, I used frozen crusts and made two pies at once. To cut fat, I skipped the melted butter in the filling (mom never used it!) and reduced the butter in the topping to 5 T (also added some oatmeal). Excellent!

After reading "best ever" so many times, I just had to try it. The pie was delicious!I did make a few changes such as sub'ing oatmeal for 1/2 the flour and using a little less sugar. I used organic pippan apples from Santa Cruz, CA which I think are superior to Granny Smiths in every way. I will make this one again and again. Wow.

This is a very decadent apple pie. My objections are twofold: one, I think that the fat/sugar/cinnamon in both the apple mixture and the crumb topping is too much resulting in a gooey heavy product and two, I think it takes twice the time to make both a crust and a crumble. I'll do one or the other next time!

This is the best apple pie I have ever made or eaten - it's a perfect combination of contrasting textures (soft apples, crumbly topping, crisp crust) and flavors (tart apples, sugar, cinnamon, etc). Rave reviews from everyone. It's also really easy -- and if you start peeling and cutting the apples right when you put the dough in the fridge, you can do all your prep & assembly in about 45 minutes.

I made this recipe for a pie baking competition and it won hands down. I used 1 1/2 times the dough recipe and I started out with 4 pounds (including cores and peels) of granny smith apples. It's a great recipe and you really can't beat the cinnamon crumble.

Forgot the shortening had to be frozen so it was barely chilled when I used it, which worked out just fine. Chickened out at the last minute and didn't use as many apples as called for, but I wish I had. Still, it was one of the best pies I've ever made.

Although this pie was good, it was a disappointment after reading all the stellar reviews. I used fresh Jonathan and Staymen apples that I picked that day. Maybe it was the kind of apples I used, but it came out very soupy. The topping was good, but I prefer a more traditional crumb topping and I also think there was too much cinnamon. Nevertheless, it tasted pretty good and everyone enjoyed it.

Ok, I cheated! Instead of making the pie crust I just used Pillsbury refrigerated piecrust. Kept everything else the same. It looked professionally made.

Great recipe but very time consuming. Make the crust and the topping the day or days before (keep in the frig). The day you peel the apples and put everything together to bake it will take another 2 1/2 to 3 hours. A lot of work but it is very good.

I am usually pleased with the recipes I try on this site, but this one just didn't do it for me. Everything went well, I added oatmeat to the crumble topping, nothing really disasterous happened, I just have the opinion that the crust, or topping of the pie should not be as sweet as the filling. I also didn't like the grainy sugary texture of the topping, it kind of out does the filling there, too. If the topping was a little cakier, or cobbler like I think it would have sat better with me. It isn't a bad pie, though. Just not one to go in my books. All others, ENJOY!

Wonderful apple pie recipe! This is now my favorite crust. I would recommend using Plugra European butter. It makes for a more flakey crust - I also used 6 TBS of butter instead of 4. I also followed the advice of one of the other reviewers by adding some oats. I will definitely make this again.

This was the best apple pie I've ever eaten or made. Sweet, gooey, and oh so yummy! I may not have used quite enough apples, as I did not weigh what I had on hand. However, no one complained. Also, I used 3 large Golden Delicious, 1 large Rome, and 1 small Gala. I initially thought the recipe made too much crumble topping, but I piled it all on anyway. Apparently,too much was just right!

This pie was AWESOME!!! I used a store bought frozen deep-dish crust. For my filling I used a scant 2-3/4 lb. home grown Winesap apples, and they were REALLY mounded in that crust. Also modified the filling by adding the juice of 1/2 of a lemon, and decreasing the sugar to 1/2 cup. For the topping I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup oats, decreased the white sugar to 1/3 cup, replaced 1/4 tsp. of the cinnamon with allspice, decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp., and increased the butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick). My topping was not sand-like, but was crunchy and delicious. The contrast between the tart apples and moderately sweet topping was wonderful. Good thing that the pie was on a foil lined pizza pan, as it did boil over. (Next time I may cut back a bit more on the apples.) I based what I did on all the previous reviews--thanks to all of you for taking the time to share your thoughts. If you haven't tried this recipe yet, DO. It is YUMMY!!!

I don't use this particular pie crust recipe, but the filling and topping are great. My only peeve: 3 1/4 pounds of apples called for in the recipe are a bit too many, so I've reduced that amount slightly, but kept the topping amount the same. A winner of a county fair apple pie contest said it's one of the best she's ever had.

I made this pie for a friend for her birthday, and she loved it! She gave me a piece, and it's just wonderful. The 3 tbsp of liquid for the crust gave me a wet soggy mess so I redid the crust using a standard recipe which was great. This actually worked very well in a 8-1/2 inch piepan. I've never made an apple pie with Granny Smith apples, but loved the sweet-tart result. A definite winner!

WOW! To quote my husband, "This is great pie, man." I cut back on the sugar, both in the filling and the crumble top, as suggested. I added some fresh lemon juice and allspice as suggested as well. The Granny Smith's give it that tartness and bite. Delicious!

I thought this was an excellent pie! The crust and apples worked together beautifully and I found the topping to be just right. It baked up nicely and crisply.

This is one of the best apple pies I have ever made. I also used a deep dish pie pan. I don't believe a 9-inch regular pie pan would work, as the ingredients nearly overflowed my extra large pan. I have always shied away from Granny Smith apples, usually using home grown apples. I was really surprised at how much better the Granny Smith apples were in comparison in taste and how they cooked. I also like the combination of butter and shortening in the crust. It had the butter flavor but was not a rich as an all butter crust.

Perfect alternative to a 2-crust pie; Cuts beautifully, and each piece has great presentation.

Not sure what I may have done wrong, as I follow all recipes to the letter...my topping never did take on the consistency of sand, and was just a mess, actually.

This pie is "good", not fabulous as I had hoped, based on the rave reviews. The crust however IS fabulous--will use that recipe again & again! (I too used a 10" deep dish pie pan--just the right size.)

Awesome Pie!!! I used a 10 in pan so I had no trouble with the ingedients not fitting the pan. It's a good thing otherwise a 9 in deep dish pan wouldn't have worked as well. The crust is awesome. I didn't find the pie to sweet I did use Granny Smith apples. However my husband prefers a top crust instead of the crumb topping.

I've made this pie twice and the second time I reduced the sugar in the filling to half a cup and in the topping by one quarter of a cup and now it's perfect. One guest said it was the best pie he's ever eaten and he looked like he ate a lot of pie.

I have not had the pleasure to try this yet, but to quote my fiancee and his friend, "it was f-ing awesome." Thats a pretty good critique from a 22 and 25 y/o i suppose! :) I changed the topping mix to 1/2 cup oats and 1/2 cup flour as well as cutting down the sugar to 1/3 cup and butter to 1/2 cup per other suggestions. Great pie!

Great Pie! I made two, both turned out BEAUTIFUL! Very impressive appearance! This crust recipe is fantastic, very flaky and pastry-like! The apples formed a wonderful mound, that when the pie was cut,looked as though I had placed each and every slice in perfect place. My pies stayed gorgeous, as each slice was cut. No spilling out whatsoever. Also, out of the 10 people who enjoyed the pies, no one thought the topping was too sweet. Every single person stated that it was the best classic flavored Apple Pie that they had ever enjoyed. The only variation to the recipe was an addition of Allspice (1/4 t.) to the crumble topping.

Made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! My mother-in-law requested that I bring it for Christmas. I made the crust in the food processor two days ahead and refrigerated. It was easy to roll out. Also, made the topping two days ahead. I added 2 T. more butter and processed longer in the food processor. It seemed to come out like wet sand and wasn't sandy when I cooked it. Prepared the whole pie a day ahead and warmed up on Thanksgiving. It wasn't messy to serve either. Will definitely make again.

About 15 years ago Gourmet had a similar recipe but the crumble is made with only 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 cup butter with the cup of flour and works very well, much more crumbly and not too sweet. Otherwise it is almost identical to this recipe

To quote an earlier reviewer, the topping comes out like "hardened sand." It is too sweet, and not as appealing as a "crumble" topping, with oats. The filling is excellent however, and the vinegar crust is a nice touch. But the topping really spoiled it for me.

Rating: 4
This pie was fantastic. It's been years since I'd made a pie, and I had all my 8 and 9 year old helpers and it still came out beautiful! I made the dough a few days ahead and refridgerated it, which worked just fine. We mounded the apples like people said; you don't have to make it look pretty, which is nice!

Rating: 4
FABULOUS! I would make both the topping and the filling a little less sweet. Cutting way down on the flour will make the topping more "crumbly". And with the cooking times mentioned, it would have been mushy; take out when the apples are almost tender, they will continue to cook while the pie cools. I made the pie in a removeable bottom fluted quiche pan, and the presentation was fantastic.

As a suggestion to those who think the topping is too sweet: add some quick-cooking rolled oats! I have a family recipe for a crumble apple pie (with caramenl on top... try that sometime! yum!) and the topping includes oats; perfect sweetness cutter! :)

Followed the recipe exactly. This is the best apple pie I have ever made - it was a huge hit at Thankgiving. I did find that I had more topping than needed though...

My husband said it was the best apple pie he has ever eaten. But he said the topping was to sweat. So I only used half of the sugar needed for the topping, and added some more butter.

I followed the recipe exactly and my fiance and I thought this was a very good apple pie. The crust is especially good. It is a bit time consuming but worth the trouble... If you're making for guests, just be warned that after the first slice, it all gets a bit messy...but sooo good. Happy Thanksgiving!

This pie was down right Fabulous!! I did take the advice by another cook and adjusted the sugar for the filling to 1/2 cup and squeezed half of a lemon on the apples. Also for the topping I adjusted the white sugar to 1/3 cup and butter to 1/2 cup. Great pie!!!

This pie was "good," but it wasn't the drop-dead yummy pie anticipated after reading all the reviews. Our guests liked it, but they weren't raving. All in all, a "good" pie, but keep looking.

I served this at a dinner party last night and it was a huge success. I topped it with some vanilla ice cream and then drizzled on some warm caramel sauce. With no worry of the appearance of the top crust, this was a breeze. I plan to make it again for Christmas dinner.

This pie was awesome when I made it in September. I did not use the crust recipe listed, but used a family favorite for the crust. Everything else I did as the recipe called for. It was great. I will be making it again for Thanksgiving.

Everyone loved this pie! This is the first time I've made crust with FROZEN butter and shortening...will definitely do this in the future. I did everything by the recipe, but ended up using only about half the topping. Covered the pie with foil at some point in the baking, once I noticed that the crust and topping were getting brown. Used Granny Smith apples. This is the first time I've made an apple pie that hasn't bubbled over - maybe because I took the extra step of setting it on a baking sheet in the oven! (Kind of like how it never rains when you have your umbrella with you!)

This pie was awesome! I had to give away most of the pie so I wouldn't eat it all myself. I am making another one for Thanksgiving.

I hate to bash the pie after so many good reviews, but this was a disaster for me. I don't know what went wrong! The crust was so tough, people scooped out the filling and just left the shell in the pan. Apples became mushy, like applesauce- and so much juice leaked out of the pie that I have a toffee-like coating all over the bottom of my oven. The crumb topping was NOT sandy, however- I added 2 T extra butter to the crumb, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I plan to give it one more try- I've never before made a pie as bad as this- it must be a fluke.

This was my very first apple pie from scratch and my boyfriend, whose mother is a champion baker, told me it was better than hers....BIG COMPLIMENT! My only issue is that I found the filling to be a little too sweet for MY taste but everyone who tried it loved it. I am making it again today.

This was my first attempt at baking a pie and what a pick it was. I would absolutely, positively make this pie again and again and again!

Love this pie!!! Mine looked like the picture except slightly darker. I cooked for 35 min at 400 and the full amount of time at 350. I put a piece of tin foil over it b/c it was browning too quickly. I also wish I'd turned it in the middle of the ake time, one side was darker then the other. The pie tasted excellent. I think the people ending up with sandy toppings aren't using enough butter. I threw in a little extra and yum!!

Great recipe! However, I made some changes: In the filling I reduced the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup and squeezed one-half lemon on apples. In the topping I reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick), which solved the dryness problem some previous reviewers cited.

Rating: 4
This pie was fantastic! I highly recommend making it. I put lightly floured parchment paper down on my surface and then another layer of paper on top of the crust dough while rolling it out. It worked great! The crust did not stick to the paper at all and it made it easy to transfer into the baking dish.

Fabulous. Everything an apple pie should be. Considering the simple ingredient list, I expected it to be just OK. I tried it only because it doesn't have a top crust - but it turned out way better than I thought. Came back to edit this to comment on the cooking times - they do seem long. The first time I made it I shortened but the second time I went ahead and followed the instructions exactly. The main difference seemed to be in how the crumble topping came out. With the full time it was crustier, crunchier. Apples were fine both times - although I also used different apples. Granny Smith from the store vs. Staymans right from the orchard. I thought both were good.

This is a very nice apple pie. I think the crust worked beautifully - it was supple enough to roll out without tearing and tasted great. I think the "sandy" texture to the filling comes from not having a high enough butter to sugar ratio. I would have to experiment to see exactly how much more to add, but there should definitely be more crumble and less sand. Still tasted good though.

I also got good reviews on this pie... however, my crumble topping didn't turn out like the photo either. It seemed to just kind of dry out and looked more like a layer of hardened sand. I'd love a suggestion on how to remedy this problem since everything else was great!

I made this recipe for someone who just moved into the neighborhood. I hadn't tried it myself first, but I read so many good reviews, I just made it according to the directions (except I made my own crust and took the suggestion to take decrease baking time 10 minutes each stage) and hoped for the best. Well,I just got feedback that it was the BEST apple pie they've ever had. So now my husband is (im)patiently waiting for me to make it at home. The only thing is, my topping didn't crumble like the picture. It was kind of sandy in texture. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm open.

This pie was delicious, but after reading some of the other comments, I took it out after 15-20 minutes at 350. Next time I will leave it in the 45 minutes as the recipe indicated, because the apples would have been softer. But, it still was very tasty.

This was my first attempt at apple pie and it was delicious! I went to Julian, CA the morning before the fire started and bought a big bag of Granny Smiths. I ended up making two pies so my husband could bring one to work to share with everyone who was affected by the fire. It was a big hit and very easy to make. I plan to make it again for the holidays.

This was the best apple crumble pie I've ever had or made. I used apples of an unknown variety that I had been given. They were nothing like Granny Smith apples, being soft and fairly sweet although flavourful. I reduced the sugar slightly to compensate and otherwise followed the recipe exactly except for using a pastry blender to reduce the topping to a "wet sand" texture as I don't have a food processor and baking it at 350 for only 35 minutes. It did bubble over a lot but that was probably because of the type of apple I used. I'm looking forward to trying it with Granny Smiths. The house smelled of apples and cinnamon for hours afterward.

This was a fabulous pie! It was nice and juicy and very flavorful. I also used a tbsp lemon juice. I used a different crust recipe too (the one I always use). My brother's friend was over for dinner and his mom called me that night to find out the recipe for the pie.

I've made this pie twice already. It's a nice cross between an apple pie and apple crisp. Great way to use up the bounty from a day of apple picking. Don't be afraid to pile the apples high. They will "sink" as they bake.

I had some extra apples around and I decided to make a pie. This came out absolutely AMAZING! I added a little lemon juice to the apples to give it a little more sweetness. I also cooked for 40 minutes, then reduced the temperature and cooked for 15 minutes and it was perfect. It was easy to make and even more easier to eat!

The pie was fantastic. My two guys (gluttons) had seconds for dessert and finished it off for breakfast. I did add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and mix golden delicious and granny smith apples. The crust is flaky and the crumble top devine. It cuts and presents beautifully. This pie is a keeper.

Loved the pie. However, I found the cooking time to be a bit too long (85 mins total), at least for my oven. The first time I made it, my apples were quite mushy. The 2nd time I reduced the cooking time by about 10 minutes each phase and I thought that was close to perfect. The recipe is a definite keeper.
