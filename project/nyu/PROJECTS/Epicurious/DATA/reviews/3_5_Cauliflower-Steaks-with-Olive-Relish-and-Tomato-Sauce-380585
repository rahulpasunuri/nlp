Loved it! Made this recipe with some very slight tweaks - increased the amount of tasty relish mostly. My cauliflower required a few extra minutes to roast - could be my oven but I'd say 15-17 minutes should do it.

Terrific! We are not vegetarians, but had this for a main course and were very satisfied. I would warn that each cauliflower will only yield about 3 (if you are lucky) perfectly round and 'steak like' portions. So, for 4-people, if you want a nice presentation, you need to purchase 2-heads of cauliflower. Whatever leftovers you have, make soup!

Excellent and original way of serving cauliflower. Delicious especially the olive relish: it was a big hit for a dinner with friends. I did not bother to puree the tomatoes, infact they were perfect served whole with a little salt and pepper.

Thought this was a pretty good weeknight meal, and an unusual but yummy use of cauliflower.

Who in your test kitchen decided that vegetarians don't warrant a main course that contains protein? Either garnish with toasted pine nuts, or a serving of warm Tuscan beans for a vegan meal. Shaved Parmesan, or a soft goat cheese work well for lacto types. As is, this is an impressive-looking, not-too-heavy first course for a dinner party, but definitely better with a hit of crushed red pepper in the tomato sauce.

I really wanted to like this recipe since so many other people recommended it, but it was kind of lackluster. I think it would be better if the salsa was kind of mixed with the tomato sauce or if the salsa was hot in some way. It was weird having something crunchy and cold on top of something roasted. I liked the cauliflowers, but I was underwhelmed by the other components.

Delish!! Used a fraction of the oil (Weight Watchers for me) and extra tomato.

This was a winner! Loved having something out of the ordinary for dinner. As others said, I only got 2 good slices from my cauliflower even though I sliced it very thin, but made lots of little slices from what was left and it was equally tasty. Doubled the tomato sauce, which was a must. My husband loved the contrasting flavors, especially the olive relish. Made a great vegetarian main dish with some bread and salad on the side.

I had a giant head of cauliflower from my CSA and when I saw this I knew it was perfect. This recipe was amazing. Even my carnivore husband loved it. The flavors from the olive relish really made the dish. My caulilower fell apart a little but I stuck it back together and you couldn't tell. A few suggestions - the olive relish is VERY salty so go easy on the salt. I oversalted by accident the first time I made it. I found this dish really only serves two people. And you should double the sauce - it's delicious but if made as shown it's just not enough. We've made it for vegan and non-vegan friends and it's been a crowd pleaser.

Delicious and really pretty to serve. I agree with others who said that the sauce should be doubled as there was not enough for 4 servings.

just tried this, it's soo much better than the other cauliflower steak (with the cauliflower puree). The puree always was so bland on top. This relish is very tasty. Didn't even bother to make the tomato sauce.

I found this to be very tasty. The prep time was a lot more than it said on the recipe. If we decided to make this dish again; we will change up a few things. We will add more lemon juice, add 2 more plum tomatoes and a couple more cloves of garlic. There was barely enough for two people and we are serving four. Again it was very good.

I love the recipe, and I'll definitely make it again, but I did change a lot. I sauteed the "steaks" in coconut oil instead of olive oil, and I added a couple of chile oil packed anchovies, which I melted in the pan before adding the cauliflower. That gave them loads of flavor and color. In the relish, I added 2 types of olives as well as grilled artichoke hearts and a couple of roasted red peppers. I also doubled amounts for just about everything except the cauliflower. It was a delicious appetizer, and something I'll make again. I might even add some sort of crumbly cheese on top next time. It makes for a beautiful plate as well, which I love.

I had some problems with portions and recipe writing. 1 large head of cauliflower made 2 thick slices but they would have fallen apart if I tried to get 4. 1 plum tomatoes only made 1/3 cup of sauce which would have been sparse across 4 plates. 3 sun-dried tomatoes-in oil or dry? 3 slices? 1/2 cup of finely chopped olives would be a lot of olive. 1 tsp of lemon juice isn't much. Cooking tomatoes and garlic in the pan used for cauliflower didn't work well; it burnt quickly and I had to start fresh. The Cauliflower with Kalamata Vinaigrette on this site is much better and easier. If I make this one again, I'll modify it quite a bit.

Just made this. Thought it was excellent. Used roasted red peppers in the relish instead of sundried tomatoes. Grated some parmesan cheese on top before serving. That added to the flavor. Would definitely make this again.

Superb! Those of you who thought it wasn't flavorful must have missed something in your relish, because it a complex and satisfying compliment to the cauliflower.

I, too thought the dish was rather boring. It was okay but, probably will not make it again.I have made much better roasted cauliflower dishes.

This is a wonderfully flavorful dish. I agree it takes closer to an hour to prepare but worth every minute of it. This is a great dish for lighter eating or would make a wonderful first course. Cold leftovers for lunch are also a hit.Simply delicious!

This was delicious. A bit of work, I think it took me about an hour and not 45 minutes to make, but it was worth it. Next time I'd make more tomato sauce. I served it with fried goat cheese and a green salad.

This was one of those labor- intensive recipes that wasn't quite worth the work. I almost skipped the tomato/garlic sauce, but was glad I didn't because it was really good. I did add some white wine to thin it out a bit, because there was hardly enough for two. Also, I would cut the cauliflower into wedges. Next time, I will skip the relish and make more tomato sauce.

Delicious! I cut more calories by using spray E.V.O.O. I also used several grape tomatoes halved, which worked well in place of the plum tomatoes. Each component of this "stacked meal," was rich in flavor and could stand alone or used separately to accompany other foods.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Simple to make and quite flavorful. I served it with brown rice which complimented the dish. Both the sauce and relish was good too. Great dish for a meatless meal.

This was very tasty. A good dish for vegetarians- or simply to transition husbands from meat to veggies :) I would sear the cauliflower even longer next time to get more of the nice browned flavor. Relish was good- sauce was good. I liked how fresh it tasted- but warm enough to be a good Winter dinner.I served with couscous and steamed kale with lemon. The sauce was great on the couscous!

I would salt the cauliflower and I also used a jarred olive tapenade for the olive mixture which worked great!

We eat a lot of vegetable entrees (flexetarians). This was very flavorful and satisfying. I didn't see the need to brown the cauliflower or tomatoes ahead of roasting. Both will brown in the oven anyway. Save dirtying a pan.

I found the flavors in this recipe to be BORING. It has good potential, but definitely needs some major help.

I'm trying to eat with the seasons so I didn't use fresh tomatoes for this recipe. I used tomato paste and added garlic to that. The cauliflower steaks were SO good with the tomato sauce and sundried tomato, olive relish. I used herbs from the pots I grow in my kitchen. I will definitely make it again as it was delicious but not hearty as some have said. Even with bread. We split this between the two of us and were still hungry afterward. I think this would be a great first course.

This was exceptional! But do all prep work ahead, particularly roasting tomatoes & garlic. Also recommend getting cauliflower to room temp. that helps stems and florets cook very evenly. I agree. With side salad and good bread this is company-worthy even for meat lovers.

Delicious. Even my teenagers loved it.

This is delicious! I used kalamata olives instead of black which I would recommend. The presentation is beautiful. This is a great entree to make, even for the meat eaters. I served this with a mixed green salad and crusty french bread. yum!

Rating: 2
This was okay, but not great. The floret part of the "steaks" were cooked through a lot better than the center. And the flavors were okay, just not great - it definitely needs something else to elevate it. The best part was the easy-to-make tomato sauce - I will definitely make that part again to add to chicken or fish.

Rating: 4
This was pretty, relatively easy, and tasted super light and healthy without being ascetic. My husband and I both really enjoyed it with some crusty bread and olive oil on the side. The tomato sauce and relish would also be great on a mild fish or chicken dish. It's a method I'd love to use again.

This was delicious! I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes on hand so I used roasted red peppers instead and it was still great. Overall, an excellent vegetarian entree. I will definitely make this again.

Very easy, tasty recipe, good hot or cold. I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes on hand, but still enjoyed this! Next time I might add some crumbled feta cheese, but it stands on its own.
