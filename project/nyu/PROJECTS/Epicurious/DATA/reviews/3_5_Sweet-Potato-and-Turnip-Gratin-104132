I altered this recipe a bit and it turned out quite well. For starters, I used whole milk instead of cream. Then, I used equal parts sweet potato and russet potato. I also used thyme and marjoram for spices. Next time I would add some garlic and possibly some leek or onion.

After reading the reviews I was kind of nervous about this one, but I thought it was pretty good! I didn't have any tarragon so used parsley instead. It is super-rich, though--best to serve with an astringent salad!

probably one of the blandest recipes ever. does very little to enhance the natural flavours of the sweet potato or the turnip. by the way, what's up with the marshmallow reference? who the heck cooks vegetables with marshmallows? that has to be the grossest sounding thing ever! just saying.

I think this is the worst recipe from this site I have ever made. I was SO disappointed. It took forever to cook through and the taste did nothing to enhance the yummy turnip & sweet potato. It was a waste of calories. Do not make this...trust me.

wonderful dish, very rich and hearty. This is a great dish to have if you have some vegetarians coming over as it is very hearty. I mixed a some gruyere in with the parm, it was great.

surprised at some of the low ratings for this dish - I thought this was very good....used marjoram and sage in place of tarragon, added a little goat cheese to the parmesan and ended up with a tasy dish

I followed the directions and recipe exactly and was unimpressed. I just wasn't a fan of the richness combined with turnips. I brought the dish to a potluck thanksgiving, and while a couple people commented that it was 'interesting', no one loved it.

very good, but rich-even made turnips taste good

This gratin was really very good and was easy to prepare. It worked well on the Thanksgiving day table just to give some variety to the usual sweet potato with marshmallows. I highly recommend this.

Outstanding! I altered this a bit - used half and half for cream, goat cheese for parmesan, and fresh sage for tarragon. This is a definate keeper!

I'm worried this might be a reflection on the cook, but I found it extremely mediocre and frankly not worth all of the fat. Nobody at the dinner was wowed.

I've made this recipe a few times, incl. once for a big potluck dinner. My family loves it, and it was a real hit at the potluck. It's easy, differerent & a very nice blend of flavours. The sweet potatoes & the turnips are a great combo. The only change I made was to use yams (those are the yellow ones) rather than the white sweet potatoes, and I alternated the layers.

Excellent. Made it for a Thankgiving dinner and it was the hit of the meal. Making it for office party tomorrow evening

My guests and I loved this dish! There was something magical about the sweet earthiness of the root vegetables set against fragrant tarragon, all bound by a silky sauce. I would push the volume of bread crumbs, parmesan and sauce....I nearly doubled those elements and it was perfect.

Fresh tarragon is a must. Small, sweet turnips help too. Remember these are homely ingredients, so this is not meant to be a gourmet dish, but more an unexpected and surprisingly simple way to combine familiar foods in unfamiliar, yummy ways. It was much loved at our Thanksgiving and we'll do it again at Christmas with the roast beef.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving- even the kids ate it with gusto! This is one of the best ways I've found to prepare turnips.

Good, but I thought it would be spectacular. Was the only dish on the Thanksgiving table that was over half full.

Wonderful dish--it was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of tarragon I used some Mexican Mint Marigold from my garden. Whichever you use, be sure to use fresh and plenty of it--it really is what makes this dish so special.

This unlikely pairing produces a truly delicious dish. I used fat free half and half and had good results. To speed the cooking time, I covered the dish for the first 30 minutes. This is definately a keeeper.

I thought this dish was wonderful! I have had a similar dish with potatoes and turnips. That dish has creamy horseradish in it. Also very good

I adore this recipe. It's a favorite in the fall & winter! I can't get enough of it!

The less-than-rave-reviews convinced me to pipe in with my two-cents-worth. We fixed this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was outstanding.

We made this for Thansgiving since the reviews were so outstanding. I hate to be the only one not raving about this dish but...It was fine, good even, but not outstanding. I appreciated that it was a different recipe, but I / we expected to be wowed by the taste and no one was. Considering all the yummy fattening ingredients I thought it would be exceptional. I wouldn't make this particular dish again, but I would definitely combine sweet potato and turnips again - they were a nice combination.

This was my first time eating cooked turnips and they were quite good! I used 2 lbs of turnips and 3 lbs of the potato. This recipe is easy and the dish was attractive as well as tasty. The potatoes taste quite savory in this combination and would be welcomed by those who find sweet potato dishes too sweet. I would use again with other meats as the main dish. This does not scream--Thanksgiving.

I first made this dish last Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I have since made it several more times throughout the year. This recipe will become a tradition for our family. The turnips and sweet potatoes make an excellent combination.

I haven't tried this dish yet, but I just wanted to respond to the cook who wondered why the half-and-half curdled. Half-and-half has a lower fat content than heavy cream. This makes it less stable and more likely to curdle when brought to a boil.

I made a mistake and purchased parsnips instead of turnips - however, it was a smash hit with a crowd of sweet potato-haters. It would be excellent with roast beef. (Especially with the parsnips.)

Very tasty, although I found the turnips to be a bit bitter (I guess that's why we always made them with lots and lots of butter and salt). It was a great make-ahead dish for Thanksgiving dinner and was a very attractive presentation.

Delicious!! Wonderful recipe for diabetics (2 attending Thanksgiving dinner)for whom sweet potato dishes without brown sugar & marshmallows are few and far between. I used light butter, no-fat 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, added sliced onions to the layers and some fresh rosemary with less tarragon. Gave it a test run since it is unusual and my husband & I judged it to be well worth doing again! Will definitely be making it for Thanksgiving but can anyone tell me why the 1/2 & 1/2 curdled? It still tasted good but the presentation was effected. I used a good brand and the label said it could be used for cooking & baking.
