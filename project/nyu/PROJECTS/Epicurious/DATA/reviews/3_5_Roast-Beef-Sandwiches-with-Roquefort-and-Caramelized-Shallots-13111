Sooooo good. This is a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. I added a little spinach and caramelized regular onions because i didn't have shallots, but it was a perfect sandwich all the same. Will definitely make again and again and again.

I, also used Gorgonzola for this - is terrific! Plan to Super-Splurge and use Stilton (am thinking a few wild, wild, mushrooms would be nice as a topper).

This is a great recipe. I made it for a birthday party and I used gorgonzola cheese. It's simple and quick. The time in the oven not only melts the cheese but gives the buns a wonderful crunch. Men especially loved it.

Another favorite from my mother's 70th birthday party. I made these as tea sandwiches, using white bread on one side, wheat on the other, and substituting a mild blue cheese for the Roquefort. My 12-year old nephew really liked these, and while he can accept the idea of shallots, we're keeping the blue cheese a secret until he's older.

Very tasty, easy to make. Perfect for a football Sunday. Used blue cheese instead of roquefort. Will surely make again.

Taste much better right out of the oven, but are good packed for a picnic too.

Very good. I used a baguette to make smaller sandwiches, and also tried both cheddar and Roquefort cheeses. After the first batch, I spread a thin film of garlic/saffron mayonnaise on one slice, and buttered the top slice. Harden those arteries right up! Delicious!

Very good lunch or light dinner that is quick to prepare. We liked it better with gorgonzola instead of Roquefort.
