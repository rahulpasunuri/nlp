Very good recipe. Ignore the comments to stick to the "classic linzer recipe" - 1) there is no such thing - every classic linzer recipe I know is substantially different, 2) this is a macaroon recipe which means it HAS to be much sweeter than linzer (a completely different cookie dough) because it doesn't rely on butter to stabilize the dough. The only change I made was to the preserves - I chopped cranberries in the processor and cooked them with the raspberry preserves, to balance out the sweetness of the macaroon cookie. I will definitely do the recipe again. And again.

One big PLUS for this recipe is that it is gluten-free. The traditional Linzer recipe uses flour. I have fries who long for cookies that they can safely eat so I appreciate this one.

There are so many things wrong with his recipe... The baking time is twice as long as it should be. Even after adjusting baking time, the cookies have a poor texture. They are tooth-achingly sweet! The filling needs to be cooked for at least 30 minutes - way longer than specified. Don't waste your time or ingredients - stick to a classic Linzer recipe!

The first time I made theese cookies was in 1999 when the recipe first came out. Since then,I have been making these cookies at least once a month. Two of my friends who are French said the macaroons taste just like the ones they have bought in France. I use 8 oz of slivered almond each time; and to make sure that the cookies are the same size, I use a disher (ice-cream scoop) number 100 (3/8 oz). I found that by using the disher, rolling the dough becomes much easier. The oven temperature is very critical for this recipe. I always use oven thermometer to double check it. I found that 18 minutes are too long. I bake them first for 8 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet front to back and bake for 7 more minutes. The come out perfect every time. I also found that the cookies will spread out more if they are flattened too much.

I made these cookies for a second time this Christmas and they were loved by everyone. I had a new food processor and I really ground up the almonds alot. This gave the cookies a marzipan like consistancy. I had no problem w/ the stickyness of the dough as long as I kept my hands moist. I would add that if you want to make as many cookies as the recipe claims, you need to keep the cookie drop size small.

I absolutely love these cookies and have made them every Christmas for the last three years. However, the dough is a nuisance to deal with. You have to make sure that your glass that you are using is wet AND you have to periodically wipe it off to make sure no dough sticks. Also, I have never been able to make both sides of the cookie the same size, so they look definitely homemade.

My mom loved these cookies! very delicious and keep well. the dough was sticky but not unmanageable.

When ever there is a family event I am asked to make these cookies- everyone who has tried them loves them. I find that they need to cook a bit longer than the recipe states until they are a light golden brown- not too brown or the nuts burn- you can tell by the smell as well. Also I double the jam amount and cook it down significantly longer than they state- more like 30 minutes.. It's a bit tricky to make the sandwiches- you drizzle a bit of the preserves and hold them together then have to have prepared a table for them to lay on wax paper- they stay together much better if you make the jam thicker- I've use bonne maison...delicious.

While this recipe looks easy, the dough is difficult and even with parchment it can stick. I lost most of the batch. If you like the linzer cookie approach, I'd stay with more traditional recipes.

I can't say that I loved these but everyone who ate them made a big fuss about them. This includes my husband who would definitely be honest if he didn't like them! I guess they just weren't my taste. Very rich. The cookies did get larger than expected when I baked them but I just matched up the different cookie sizes when I put them together. I would make them again since everyone loved them and they look pretty for gifts.

Next time, I would make sure the dough is 1 1/4 inches. I made them too big. But, they were still delicious! These should also work for a Passover dessert since there is no flour or levening in the recipe.

This recipe is a keeper. I made several batches to share at holiday parties last year. Everyone remember them, and is asking for them again this year.

A sweet cookie, with a nice almond flavor. The constrasting raspberry filling was delicious. I had no problems with the recipe -- it turned out as pictured and everyone loved them!

These are great for anyone with a gluten allergy. I varied the type of nuts and included dried fruit and they were fine. A good non-stick pan is essential.

I was disappointed with these cookies. I followed the recipe and used a rounded teaspoonful of the dough to shape the cookies but they spread so much and were HUGE. The flavor was okay but there wasn't enough jelly in the middle because they came out so large.
