yield: Makes 5 (2 tablespoon) servings Huh?? With the first thing on the ingredient list being 2 cups of cider- how in the world is this going to yield 10 tablespoons when finished? I have to really wonder about this whole recipe....

The best that can be said for this is that for a salad dressing without oil, mayonnaise, sour cream, or cheese, it's not half bad. If you're dieting, this is better than most low-calorie dressings. Would I make this if I weren't trying to lose weight? I don't think so. That said, I think this would work as a dressing for a fruit salad or even as a basis for coleslaw. I was struck by the cinnamon taste at first--definitely unusual in a salad, but it's an interesting flavor.

I agree it needs a little something. FOr one thing, it's too watery and it all goes to the bottom of your salad. A good marinade though. I added some garlic paste, ginger paste, and nutritiional yeast for flavor and to thicken it some. Yummy. Might also be good with some quality mustard added.

I made this as part of the salad it goes with and I thought it was just ok. I was left with a lot of leftover dressing since the salad recipe only calls for a bit of this one. I ended up braising turkey thighs in this vinaigrette and it was just wonderful. The turkey bears a lovely apple cider scent with a hint of sweetness. I highly recommend that as a use for your leftover dressing.

Made it yesterday for a healthy salad and it turned out great. I can't help feeling like it needs a little something...but it's pretty good just like it is!

Yumm. didn't change a thing. Perfect with a thanksgiving salad- I put it on a steamed edamame, asparagus, and green bean salad with craisins. Yum.
