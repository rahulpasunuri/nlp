Excellent. I boiled them in water with squeezed lemon wedges for additional flavor, then tossed them in a bath of butter, olive oil and lemon with salt and pepper. I left out the mint. Didn't miss it. We grilled them after the marinade had soaked in a bit, but I am sure they would have been fine even without the grilling. Still it added a nice flavor. Will definitely add to my regular rotation of recipes.

Ohhhh so good! Added a touch of garlic powder, put these on the grill with a burger and ended up filling up on artichoke before even making it two bits into the burger! Give it a go, you won't even miss the butter!

Simple, delicious...I would definitely make these again!

this was a nice dish. The only thing is that the outside leaves really couldn't be eaten, so my guests were at a bit of a loss as to how to tackle them. We ended up using knife and fork for the stems and bottom/middle then resorted to using our fingers to pick up the outer leaves and scrape with our teeth - a bit of a messy proposition with the dressing. Nonetheless I'd consider making them again.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! Have made it so many times...perfect for summer parties as you can do most of the work ahead of time. I omit the mint and add about 4 cloves pressed garlic. Is extra yummy served with a dill aioli.

I made this recipe last night to go with chicken and shrimp kabobs on the grill for 6 people. It was incredibly delicious, and everyone loved it! I did it a little differently, only using 3 large artichokes. I cut the artichokes according to the recipe (not halving them until they were already cooked) - "Cut stem off 1 artichoke, leaving about 1 inch. Snap off outer 2 rows of leaves. Cut off top 1/3 of artichoke." - and then I boiled them in salted water with one whole sliced lemon for 20 minutes. After they were drained and cooled, I sliced them in half and removed the hair and tough leaves. I found that taking a small knife and slicing just under the hair root made it very easy to then take a spoon to remove the hair. When the halves were ready, I then placed them in a baking dish and basted them with the dressing and put them in the refridgerator until it was time to grill. (approx. 3 hours) Only the sliced side was grilled, and the outside leaves basted with more of the dressing. When the artichokes were done, I poured the remaining dressing over them, and served them warm. It was so easy, and I will definitely be making this again!

Love to make this when artichokes are in season. I never seem to have mint on hand, so I use oregano. As long as there is plenty of lemon of good quality olive oil, it's perfect. (I do add some garlic powder now). Have made several times over the past year.

I really like the concept of the dish, but next time I would make the dressing with garlic and perhaps some red pepper flakes. I personally couldn't taste the mint. The prep work can be difficult, but using a small knife with precise cuts yields great results.

I boiled four whole artichokes, thought they would never finish. Then I let them cool. Cut them in half with a serrated knife. Using a grapefruit spoon (has a serrated tip) I easily removed the center bristle. Poured the marinade over and popped them under the broiler for 12 minutes. Curious to see how the leftovers fare tomorrow. Yummmmmmmm I bet.

microwave for 2-3 minutes before grilling

Great idea. I fried 15 cloves of garlic in 1/2 cup of olive oil on low heat until garlic was soft and brown and used this oil to dres the artichokes. My family devoured them

The key to this recipe is to make sure the artichokes are done before they go on the grill. Or else you're stuck with raw charred chokes. Also, a welcome addition to the olive oil is lots of pressed garlic, black pepper and kosher salt. YUM! I won't make artichokes any other way!

Wonderful! Great success for Easter. Cooking the artichokes before removing the choke makes it much easier to remove. Then proceeded to barbque. This is a real winner!

ok-- so i followed the recipe completely and ended up with 1/2 raw charred artichokes -- not pretty! and yes prep was a bear. but i will try it again, however, i'll cook them in water till done & char just at the end for presentation. and i won't do this for 8 again-- maybe 6 max.

I cut the lemon/olive oil/mint dressing in half to use with a package of frozen quartered artichokes that had thawed. I also used a preheated grill pan to cook them. They turned out great even using these short cuts. Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes to the dressing for more zip.

This is a nice way to serve artichokes in a different way. Makes a nice and dramatic presentation. Good flavor combination.

This was delicious! We loved the artichokes, although they were a beast to prepare (cutting in half, trimming, etc.). I halved the recipe and omitted the mint, which we don't care for. Will make again for guests because they were tasty and not-your-usual barbeque fare. Once prep work was done, recipe worked like a charm.
