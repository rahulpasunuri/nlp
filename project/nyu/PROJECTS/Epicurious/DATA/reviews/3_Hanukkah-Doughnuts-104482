I thought this was a very easy and very tasty recipe. Roll the dough into balls before dropping into hot oil, as they stay together better. I would definitely make them again.

My son said this snowy morning, "I'm hungry for doughnuts, but I know we wont go to town in the snow." This recipe was perfect. Keep the balls small so they do not get burned before finished in the middle. Remember the recipe came from the section "Too Busy To Cook?" and is not intended as an authentic, as it states. It is however, just plain, easy, fun (with the children) and good. (btw: I was out of vanilla and used almond instead, brought memories of scandinavian cooking and holidays to mind)

I have no idea how authentic these are but I actually made them (unlike most of the previous reviewers) and thought they were delicious. I also gave some to a friend who didn't eat them until hours later and she said they were still very good - crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. I found that you do not need quite as much oil - they float to the top, anyway.

I have yet to make this recipe, and wanted to let people know that this is a traditional Israeli dish to celebrate Channukah. When I am in Israel at this time of year, people can't wait for these unseemingly unpretentious treats. They may not be gourmet there, but they are definately a tradition.

i reviewed the recipe as one(American-israeli citizen) who makes sufganiot each year. They are a delicious treat. Authentic sufganiot are made with a yeast dough, and two risings. My sufganiot this year, were delicious, much better than last year. By the way, the jelly in sufganiot is either rasberry (not strawberry) or carmel. The theme of the sufganiot is the oil they are fried in - oil being the theme of chanukah -the miracle of one flask of oil lasting not just one day, but eight. in any case, making sufganiot to commemorate chanukah is admirable.

I am from Israel and read the sufganiyot recipe and reviews with much interest. I have not made sufganiyot myself, but I have eaten them. The recipe given here does not resemble Israeli sufganiyot. However, contrary to one of the reviews, Israeli sufganiyot do not in the least resemble American jelly doughnuts! I am sorry to say that sufganiyot are large balls of fried dough (about the size of a fist)injected with a small blob of (what is supposed to be) strawberry jelly. They are extremely caloric and not worth the eating! Buy (or make) real doughnuts and you will be much happier with the result.

I haven't made this yet -- but commenting ono the last "review" -- don't be nice. Be Honest. If it's not authentic to the holiday, I'd like to know that -- a simple notation would suffice. And if it really is "gross", I apreciate the warning. It simply lets me decide if I need to try it out ahead of time, before just serving to guests. Please, Reviewers, continue to be honest, and don't just post "nice" reviews.
