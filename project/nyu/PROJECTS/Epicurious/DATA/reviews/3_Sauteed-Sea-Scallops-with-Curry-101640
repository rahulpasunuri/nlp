I have to agree with the cook from Washington...YUK, for the same reasons. The cream and butter mixture had a funky texture and was not especially flavorful. I also did not care for the warm cukes, great idea to substitute squash. So not to waste, I ended up stirring a little bit of the sauce in with the carrots and served them on the side with the unembellished sauteed scallops and some jasmine rice. That was the only bearable way to eat this dish.

My husband and I found this easy recipe interesting and will probably make it again, but without the vegetables - really liked the sauce. Served this over steamed spinach with rice pilaf.

We served it on angel hair pasta and substituted zuchini and summer squash for the cucumber. Presentation was beautiful and it was very filling.

This dish is wonderful. I substituted the cucumber for summer squash and served it over rice. My husband loved it!!! I thought the curry and ginger were very interesting together. I'll make it for company next time!

It was so delicious that since the Japanese scallops I used only quantify as 7-8 pieces/lb, my guests finished off the dish by pouring the sauce over the rice. I've been asked to make this again and again by one of my friends who does not cook!

We really had high expectations for this dish since we love both scallops and curry. We were SO dissapointed! We actually had to throw it out! I don't know if the cream or the scallops were bad or if it was just the recipe ingredients combined together that were so awful. It was very very bad tasting. It tasted very strange with all the cream and butter. yuck!

I've made this twice. It's very easy and delicious. Excellent served over jasmine rice.

Main entree in my Bastille Day dinner. Loved by all my guests. Would have been good with a lemon rice pilaf on the side.
