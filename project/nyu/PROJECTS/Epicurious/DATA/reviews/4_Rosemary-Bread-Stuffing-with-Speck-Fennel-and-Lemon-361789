Didn't like the bits of meat

I didn't like the meat flavor in my stuffing, made it overmuch for my taste. If you love pig flavor though, you'd probably like it.

This stuffing was really good. Everyone loves it. They said the fennel gave an favoraful and interesting taste. I switched rasin with cranberry. It was more Christmasy and good.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe for stuffing. The flavors blended so well. High class all the way! Be sure to make what you can ahead of time. It is worth it. Also, watch the last 10-15 minutes of cooking time to make sure it doesn't get too crispy. I will be making this again next year.
