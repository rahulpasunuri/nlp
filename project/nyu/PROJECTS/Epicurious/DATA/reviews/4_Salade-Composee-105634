The recipe now works when added to recipe file. It looks good. I haven't made it yet, but the ingredients sound much like a salad I had in Italy. I'm going to try it with salmon or swordfish.

To the cook from Belpre: It did the same thing to me when I saved it to my recipe file. Go figure...

This makes for a nice meal. I lined the plate with boston lettuce. In my Julia child cook book I noticed she used mini potatoes in another salad composee, so I added those. I boiled them until tender and added them to the mushrooms in order to marinated. I agree with the other reviewer about adding avocado and doubling the dressing. I used chickpeas instead of kidney beans. Really, use what ever you have on hand, arrange decoratively on a large plate and drizzle dressing overtop. It might be a nice intimate meal to share with a loved one on a night you don't feel like heavy duty cooking. Prepare the dish, get two forks and glasses of wine and enjoy!

I have not yet tried this recipe. I simply want to know why the title is "Preserved Lemons" when I add it to my recipe file!

This is a wonderful take on a Salad Nicoise. It's filling (but not fattening), beautiful to look at and delicious. The trick is a) use EXCELLENT olive oil b) double the dressing c) use organic baby spinach instead of regular greens d) add some slices of avocade spinkled with fresh lemon around the edges... The ultimate light French dinner.
