Very tasty. Agree with poster that the mussels get cold while you're finishing up the saffron sauce so make sure you tent them with foil. A hearty bread for mopping up the sauce is a must.

My grocery had crème fraiche but not mussels, so knowing it was probably some kind of heresy, I went ahead and made this with two little half-pints of refrigerated shucked oysters. I dumped them and their juice into simmering wine in a saucepan, cooked till plump, and then strained that liquid into the skillet with the shallots and went on from there. Very rich, very tasty.

It's been seven years since I reviewed this, and I have to say this dish continues to be awesome. It may well be the best mussels dish on Epicurious. Make it exactly as written and you won't go wrong.

I made this as dinner for two last night-- it was really delicious. Serve with good crusty bread to soak up the sauce. My only complaint is that the mussels cooled significantly during the time it took to complete the sauce-- and I didn't even bother to remove the shell halves. The rich lemon-saffron flavor is so good, though; I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic. The only recommendation I have is to reduce the lemon juice by at least half. I made it this way after reading another reviewer's suggestion and it was wonderful.

I followed the recipe as written and it was just wonderful. By far the best mussels I have ever had. The sauce is something to write mother home about!

Sorry folks, I just don't get it. Way too much lemon! Very disappointing. Looked pretty, but the lemon overpowered the wonderful flavor of the mussels.

Loved this recipe. Worth the effort of a few extra steps. I have a question: I am looking for the recipe for Mussels Congolese from Chambar Restaurant in Vancouver. It's one of their specialties and tastes amazing - have not been able to recreate at home - can anyone help me out with this?

This was fantastic, worthy of 5 forks!!! This dish is so rich and tasty it's really for special occasions. Serve this dish to somebody special; use fresh mussels, a fresh crusty loaf of bread to soak up the sauce and a nice bottle of white wine and they'll be yours forever!! Don't leave out the brandy, it really makes the sauce!

Sooooo so good! I had never made mussels before and I was a little intimidated. These were so easy and turned out fabulous! I even had 2 non-mussel eaters at dinner who practically licked their plates! Highly recommend!

This is such a fantastic dish. I make it on quite a regular basis and I highly recommend you try it. The timing is tricky in that you cannot start the sauce dish until the mussels are done (the wine must be added), which has the undesirable effect of having your mussels cool, although the sauce will warm them up again. Still, to try to retain the original warmth, I recommend that two people break apart the mussels while the sauce is cooking. Also, if you find the results disappointing, shop around for different creme fraiche -- the different variants can have quite an effect on the recipe.

I did substitute a little Saffron Powder packet (Spanish - Pina brand) for the saffron threads and it was really a superb dish. The chives are a good touch, for color and flavor, so don't leave them out. If the mussels are fresh and you can find creme fraiche at the market then you can't go wrong. Bon Appetit!

I made the entire French Country dinner and the mussels were the hit of the night. They are a bit of work but worth the effort. I definitely will add this to my mussel recipe file.
