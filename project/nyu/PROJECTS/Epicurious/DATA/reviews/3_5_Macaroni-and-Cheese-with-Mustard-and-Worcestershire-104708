I made this last night and it was a huge success. A couple of changes: (1) after I took the macaroni out, I tossed some broccoli florets into the boiling water to cook for a few minutes, then drained and added those; (2) I sauteed some chopped up ham and sliced shallots to add to the mixture; (3) I topped the whole thing with bread crumbs. My husband's reaction was that this had to go on our list of favorites.

I like this recipe because it holds up to a range of variations, and you can sneak in vegetables or throw in ham, bacon, sausage of pretty much anything you'd like! However, I found that since you don't melt the cheese in the milk and eggs to make a cheese sauce, the noodles don't get coated evenly - you have more of a custard/quiche at the bottom. The problem, admittedly, is that I may have used more pasta that the egg mixture could cover...just something to keep in mind

Oh my gosh...I am so full. This stuff is quite addictive. I really like homemade mac and cheese and this rates up there. I like the fact that it is stiff and not runny but (maybe it's my oven) it does need the full hour to accomplish the crispy edges and golden brown crust. My three little guys really enjoyed it and had seconds -- which is hard to believe cause this stuff could feed a family of five for a week. It is a bit oily from the cheese but for comfort food this one is it. I will make this again and again cause the kids are addicted...me -- I'm going back to the kitchen for the leftovers.

Delicious! Made it for Christmas and it was gone by the end of the night. I used different noodles and it still came out wonderful. I also used mozzarella and monterey jack cheeses as well.

Loved the subtle but good flavour, the solid baked consistency, with nice dark golden edges. Doubled the mustard, Worster and Cayenne. Made as individual 'cakes' in muffin tins baked with a few slices of semi-dried tomatoes on top. Served as part of a selection of appetisers for Easter Sunday lunch. Everyone commented Ooh yumm.

My grandma baked hers with dollops of ketchup on top, now I can't eat it any other way. For those who object to the blandness of this dish - give my grandma's trick a try - it adds oodles of flavor. I would make this again with fewer eggs though.

Very disappointed in this recipe - even after adding more of the mustard, cayenne,worcester and evaporated milk, this was still bland. My husband, who loves macaroni and cheese suggested adding even more of these and at least doubling the amount of cheese. Even with the additions, it cooked in only 45 minutes.

This is what baked macaroni and cheese is meant to be. I remember the first time I had boxed mac as a kid, I was so disappointed! When my mom made macaroni and cheese casserole it was always cut with a knife and served in squares. This is the only "solid" mac 'n' cheese recipe I've found. I left out the cayenne and mustard for a more traditional flavor, but used sharp white cheddar. Delicious! If you're used the the slimy-oozy kind of mac 'n' cheese then you might not like it, but in my mind this is REAL mac 'n' cheese-and you don't have to make a cheese sauce!

This is good, but read the reviews and know what you're getting into. This is more like a casserole than what many think of as macaroni and cheese. I doubled the mustard and tripled the worcestershire, and used a full teaspoon of cayenne instead of 1/8 (we like it spicy). Even with the increased mustard & worcestershire, their presence is negligible. I substituted half-and-half for half of the condensed milk. Reducing the eggs might produce a creamier, less dense product. Regardless, 1 hour of cooking time is probably too much. Ours was done at 45 minutes and had a nice crispy base.

This was a delicious meal that fed 3 adults, 3 children. I would definitely make this again as a side dish and doubled quantity. I doubled Worcester sauce and used Dijon mustard since that was all I had, everyone loved it. This was done in 40 minutes and was almost OVER cooked, very firm.

Took advice of many and doubled the worceastershire sauce, used grey poupon, and the extra milk. But then I added cut up ham and topped with French's onions and some parmesan, doubled the amount for a party, and it was the first dish gone!!

Good solid comfort food recipe.This was the second time I made it and only had 2 eggs on hand, added a can of tuna, made breadcrumb topping and cooked it for 45 mins.Perfect!

This has been my go-to mac&cheese recipe for years now. Simple to make, easily adaptable to whatever cheese is on hand; the mustard, worcestershire and cayenne add subtle hints of flavor that go beyond the usual blandness of many mac&cheese recipes. I usually add a bit of parmesan and other, more strong cheeses to supplement the cheddar cheese. I also tend to use a bit more cheese than the recipe calls for, but it's perfectly fine with the called-for amount. Kids and adults alike love this one- absolutely a keeper!

Mine only fed 4 people, although I only had 2 eggs left. Also used a 12 oz can of evap milk and I just eye balled the measures for cayenne, worcestershire and mustard. We liked it, especially the kids (I mean, otherwise there should have been some leftovers since this was ment to serve 6, right?

I liked the recipe, but I couldn't really taste the Worcestershire. I might add more next time, but my boyfriend loved it as is. I will definitely make this again.

This is similar to my grandmom's recipe too... which I loved. I made it last night, and realized that it was the memories I loved - not so much the firm mac n cheese. Prefer mine creamy and not able to cut into squares..

this is almost an identical recipe from my great grandmother, also from shreveport. note that it states the texture being firm, not creamy. this is a southern staple on our holiday table. i would give it 4 forks, but it does not have a bread crumb topping.

My family loves this mac and cheese, and it is so easy! I add extra cheese, and I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and use horseradish cheese in place of half of the cheddar - it turns out great with just the right amount of zip. I also adjust the cooking time as I usually double the recipe and use a casserole dish

Our family loves this recipe, especially our daughter who is a real picky eater. I use the Barilla Plus pasta, and sprinkle a little bit of bread crumbs on the top before baking. In my oven this dish is done by about 40 mins. It has a nice flavour from the mustard, worchester, and red pepper. Some kids may prefer it with less spice! Super yummy!!!

Mac & cheese is my favorite food in the whole world. And this particular recipe is outstanding (I've tried MANY). Double the Worcestershire, use Dijon mustard (and a bit more of it too), and use a whole 12 oz. can of evaporated milk. Bake it in an 8" x 11" glass casserole dish for 50 minutes instead of an hour. And you have....perfection. I had the leftovers last night and was so sad when they were all gone. I could eat this every day!

Great tasting, quick and easy to prepare. I doubled the cayenne pepper for more kick, and added minced garlic and shallots since I had them around. I also topped it with some bread crumbs to make it crispy. I love mac and cheese and this one seems healthier since there's no heavy cream. I'll be making it all winter long.

A brilliant variation of my recipe, except that i add sliced tomatoes on the top. Also used a bit more mustard than recommended, but that's because I love mustard

I've made about 6 different mac n' cheese recipes recently, and this is my favorite. It is not the rich, creamy style that is also wonderful, but more like a souffle. I've had this style at southern "soul food" and Jamaican restaurants in New York, and always wondered what made it so good. Turns out it is the eggs and evaporated milk. I added about 1/2 cup of additional skim milk and baked for only 45 minutes in response to the dryness others complained about. Even more milk could've been added. Also added more mustard and worcestershire. It was sublime.

This is an excellent, firm macaroni and cheese. This is not meant to be runny! If you stick to a good, sharp cheddar cheese, and use a rich brown mustard, it's plenty flavorful. I usually serve with a simple green salad, it makes a great weeknight dinner.

made this recipe last night, it is easy to make, but lacked in taste. Did not have much of a cheese flavor. And was to eggy tasting for us. Well try another mac n cheese recipe next time!!

I used 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. Also, in addition to the remaining 1/2 cup cheddar cheese over the top of the disk, I sprinkle a light coat of parmesan. Every tasty, and will make it again.

This was the first baked macaroni dished I've made and I was not impressed. I added a little parmesan and blue cheese to give it some richness. I think I was looking for it to be somewhat creamier. I'll have to find a new baked mac and cheese recipe...

the recipe is good and rich tasting, however, the second time i made it , i used 1 teaspoon of mustard. i also mixed fresh [ or dried ] sour dough breadcrumbs wiht the 1/4 cup of cheese and sprinkled over top.

I used extra worchestershire sauce & brown mustard. Served kids so used paprika over cayenne. Also added 1 cup more milk. It was excellent. It's a mild, subtle flavor but rich. I'll use more wor. sauce next time & maybe add curry. Good basic recipe. Kids & Dad devoured it!

I didn't like this recipe at all. It had no flavor. My six year old who usually likes everything said it was nasty.

This recipe is fantastic!! I doubled it and added more Worcestershire (1 Tbsp, instead of 2 tsps) and made the 1/4 tsp cayenne heaping instead of level. Used evaporated skim milk instead of regular and 5 jumbo eggs instead of 6 large. Also added pinch of salt to egg mixture. Will definitely make this again. Yum! :)

This is classic Southern-style macaroni and cheese, the way my mama used to make -- except even richer! I doubled the worchestershire and substituted half-and-half for one cup of the condensed milk, also cut one egg yolk. Recipe was great and well-received.

This has become a standard weekly meal in my house. My husband always wants "that great macaroni and cheese with mustard in it." I have even served it to company. Everyone loves it. My husband even prefers it to his mother's macaroni and cheese.

My family loved this!!I'd like to experiment with it and add other stuff--maybe tuna or peas. Using the eggs and evaporated milk made it very light.

This recipe should be called Macaroni and Cheese Pie. Don't expect anything creamy - I actually cut it with a knife and served it in slices! However, this is exactly what I wanted to serve as a side dish so I was pleased. I doubled the worcestershire and the cayenne and would do so again next time. As for the mustard, next time I would actually decrease the mustard to 3/4 of a tablespoon as I am not a huge fan of prepared mustard in my macaroni.

If you are expecting a creamy, saucy macaroni and cheese you'll be disappointed. We liked it and I would make it again. My mother has made for years a baked macaroni made with eggs. This is close to that.

Certainly different from other macaroni and cheese recipes! I thought it was so-so but the people I served it to liked the firm texture and the addition of eggs to it. It was very easy to make -- I liked not having to make a white sauce first so I will probably make it again.

I agree that this was blander than I expected it to be. I actually "spilled" extra worchestershire sauce in the mixing bowl and I still didn't taste anything. ALso, it was drier than I cared for. I had to use a rectangular pan instead of square so that may have affected the cooking time, but I would still recommend cooking for a shorter period AND adding more liquid (evaporated milk). Actually, I reheated it the next day on the stove top and added a bit of cream and milk and it was much better. I like the concepts and will try again, but experiment with different adaptations.

Not awful, but I'd never make it again. I expected a velvety sauce, but this one clumped together, even though I made sure to temper the egg mixture. And I added more mustard and cayenne, but couldn't taste much of either one. I didn't have macaroni, so I used penne instead, but I doubt that affected the final outcome much. I'll definitely keep looking for a macaroni and cheese dish that wows me.

I agree with the other reviewers that say this recipe stinks! Very bland. Not what I thought it would be like with the spices that were used. We wasted a box of macaroni for nothing.

This was not what I expected--really custardy--but it tasted good. I forgot the butter. also used just 2 cups of sharp and white cheddar, a 12 oz can of milk, and had to sub tabasco for the cayenne and soy sauce and balsamic vinegar for the worcestershire (sounds weird, but you couldn't tell). it was plenty done after 45 minutes so be sure to check. Anyway, good but not the final word on mac and cheese.

I might experiment more with this one. The mustard and worcestershire were a nice touch, but I'd increase the amount called for. You could taste it but, only a very slight hint of it. Also, it was very dry.

My mom and I loved this recipe! I would definitely add a little more cayenne to kick it up a notch, but it was fabulous! My husband likes his mac & cheese a little creamier, so I might try adding some more milk....

I'm a fan of creamier mac and cheese dishes, so I took the advice of the earlier reviewers and added 1 cup of half and half to the recipe. Also, the only cheese I had on hand was cheddar w/ horseradish - mixed with a few slices leftover American cheese to get the 10 ounces of cheese that the recipe called for. Quite good!

I absolutely love this recipe! I served it with meatloaf as an alternative to potatoes, and the homestyle comfort food dinner was met with rave reviews. I also add an extra egg, use a garlic dijon mustard instead of regular, and use 1 large 12oz can of milk--I've found this makes it a little creamier.

Boy...this sounded great. And came out of the oven looking and smelling fantastic. Unfortunately, it was dry as a bone and lacking ANY mustard, worcestershire, cheese or other taste. My recommendation would be to double all the flavorings and add more milk/cream unless you like your mac & cheese stiff as a board.
