I have made this 3 times and each time it turned out great - everyone loves the lightness of the flavors as none of them over power any other. The coconut cream mixture does take time to absorb, but be patient, it is worth it! Although I have made this only during the winter months, it would make a great summer dinner party dessert.

Meh. I found the cake dense and salty. I may have over soaked with the liquid, but I didn't think it added much flavor. The mint cream frosting was good, but not good enough to redeem the cake. I'll stick with the classic tres leches, maybe jazzing it up with coconut cream next time. It was easy to make, and I'll definitely use the authors' simple syrup technique to sweeten & flavor whipped cream again.

I have made this cake several times now and it is a favorite! One thing changed.. while this recipe calls for coconut cream and Not cream of Coconut, I have tried it both ways. I liked the cream of coconut better, and it soaked in better also:)

The final result was delicious. The mint cream added just the right airy note to compliment the dense, rich interior. Definitely a cake to make ahead of time...there were many steps and waiting for the condensed milk/coconut cream liquid to saturate the cakes took about 15 minutes each 1/2 cup. Also, the cake should be served cold, so give plenty of time to store it in the fridge before it's served. I prepared the cake first thing in the morning, to be served at an evening dinner party. Turned out great.

I couldn't find coconut cream, so I used coconut milk as the tip suggested. I really liked the whipped cream as a frosting. But I would use 2 cups of whipping cream. I didn't have enough for the sides

this cake is delicious but if i am looking for coconut i will go for the coconut cupcake recipe bon appetit put in the april 09 issue. it is a lot easier to make and has more of a coconut flavor i think. although the whipped cream is really good in this recipe.

This cake was easy and delicious. I made it for some friends we had over and one friend had three pieces. I will make this again for sure.

This is a nice dessert. I too (in Canada) could not find the coconut cream. And I didn't even skim off the top, just used the can. It still worked, except I found I needed a lot less of it to soak up into the cake. It was a nice moist cake and at first I was worried about the light topping but I think a thicker one and it would have overpowered the cake. A few mint sprigs on the top would be nice for decoration. A good cake-an original for sure.

This was a totally amazing recipe. EVERYONE loved it, especially my husband, who is very hard to please. The finished product looks gorgeous.

This cake is good. I didn't make the mint whipped cream because I had some leftover buttercream to use - but I did add some mint extract to it to experiment with the coconut-mint flavor combo. I served this at a b-day party and everyone loved it. A few notes: 1. There is a small typo in the "notes" section - it should read, do not confuse coconut cream with CREAM OF COCONUT, which I almost did! 2. I couldn't find coconut cream so I used the method of skimming the cream off the top of canned coconut milk. This worked fine and I needed two 14-oz cans of coconut milk to yield enough cream. 3. The recipe says the cake can be prepared 24 hours in advance, but what it doesn't say is that it really can't be served immediately. The cakes were extremely soggy and it took several hours for the cream/condensed milk mixture to be fully incorporated into the cake. I was cutting it close to party time so it was a bit nerve wracking. Next time I'd definitely make the cakes at least 12 hours in advance. 4. after frosting the cake with my mint buttercream, I poured a layer of chocolate ganache over the whole thing. Chocolate was a nice addition!
