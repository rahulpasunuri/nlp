Love it! Worth all the effort.

Recipe was ok (mostly lime/fish/shrimp/lemon tasting) but not enough of a fan to make it again or try it at a restaurant.

Absolutely fabulous! I will make this again even though it is extremely time consuming to prepare the paste - probably took well over an hour and lots of 'elbow grease'.
