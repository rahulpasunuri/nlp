Super easy and great flavors. Because previous reviews mentioned the high spice I omitted the cayenne pepper and I don't think it suffered one bit. Instead a spicy salsa gave folks more control of the amount of heat. I marinated a flat iron steak with the rub for an hour and grilled everything outside including fresh corn tortillas. Definitely will make again!

Easy to do, hard to screw up, great ROI. Both my husband and I were surprised about the amount of heat, but pleasantly so. often things are not as hot as we like. Good weekday recipe. Not unhealthy either.

This recipe is very good. I used striploin instead of flank and it worked very well. I will make it again

Yummy! This was so good. After I cooked the meat {on our nifty foreman grill, it took longer at med-high} I threw on some sweet onion and red/orange peppers and left them to caramelize for a bit. Mixed up the cilantro with lime juice to sprinkle over, avocado... pretty much didn't change anything! My hubby ate two, and I would of if it could of fit in my stomach. I was worried they wouldn't be as good as juicy fajitas, but I'm definitely making these again.

Good call on the fan! A must for this recipe. You could also heat the skillet on the grill outside. It is a lung-buster! But in a good way. I substituted chipotle for the cayenne, because it's what I had. It was good. I also used the suggestion of deglazing the pan with the fajita vegetables. They were awesome. My family with kids ranging from 12 to 7 all loved it. I doubled it, and it fed six for dinner (I also had rice) and leftovers for lunch. Good the next day too. The heat doesn't grow.

Great flavor. If anyone is thinking about using another cut of meat - don't - flank steak is the best for fajits - period. The spices and garnish really make these fajitas happen - so don't skimp! :)

Tastes like a fajita I would expect from an authentic Mexican kitchen. I followed the rub recipe exactly, but let it sit on the meat for about 15 minutes. The avocado, while rich, provides an unexpected lightness to the fajita. I used whole wheat tortillas and lightly toasted them on a skillet sprayed with pam. Delish!

My boyfriend made this last night and it was excellent. Very spicy, he grilled it inside and we could barely breathe due to the spice smoke. The cilantro is a definite must & the peppers add sweetness, the avocado balances the spice & cools it down a bit & we garnished with lime wedges which adds definite complexity and another sweet/ sour note...This one is a definite keeper!

I served the steak (which I grilled) and avocado on a bed of greens with some croutons and a drizzle of olive oil and lime juice. I didn't have any cilantro on hand, but next time I would throw that in with the greens.

This is a great recipe!!! Fast and easy - one of the best recipes I've come across. I usually use a marinade on flank steak, but this recipe tasted much better than any marinade I have used. If I could I would have given it a 5 fork rating.

My Partner and I loved this recipe. We didn't have cayenne so I used Chipolte chile pepper and this offered a slight heat but also a slight sweetness..it was awesome!!!! We are cooking it again in two nights. This is a great recipe and it's fast and easy.

WOW! My sweetie and I love these fajitas. I use a skirt steak (the traditional fajita cut) instead of flank, and add a red onion cut into rounds, and a yellow & poblano pepper cut in strips. Throw them on the grill with the steak. These fajitas are both fast & delicious - it just doesn't get much better than that!

Loved this recipe. But if you don't like spicy food, this is NOT the rub for you. I would absolutely make this dish again. We loved it.

Loved these Our new favorite take on fajitas.

We thought this was a great recipe for spice/rub mixture. We followed the rub to a T, and then threw in onions and peppers (and a touch of veg oil) after the steaks were taken off, to deglaze the pan, cook the vegs slightly, and pick up the flavor that remained in the pan. With a little bit of home made guacamole and some sour cream, YUM-O!

This was a big hit with my friends. The flank steak came out perfectly seasoned. I served it with the avocado, lime wedges and romaine as well as red onion, chopped tomatoes and parsley (I don't like cilantro). Really tasty and super easy!

This recipe was very satisfying. My sister from SF declared these fajitas "better than any she had had in a resteraunt." One note, do not cook these unless you have a functional overhead fan. The spices will sear your lungs.

My husband liked this more than I did. Even with all the flavors it was a bit bland or just not fajita-ish. I will try letting the rub sit longer on the meat next time.

Really tasty - next time I will use a more expensive cut of steak (the flank steak I got was chewy) AND less cayenne. But it was super fast and simple, and the avocados are a great touch.

The blend of spices for this was perfect, made my own guacamole to go with. Will use this as my standard fajitas recipe forever!

This was very good. I used only a 1/4 tsp each of black pepper and cayenne to cut back on the heat and increased the salt to 1 tblsp. (my steak was 1 3/4 lb) Also made guacamole instead of just avocado to add on. I would also use a better cut of meat next time as flank steak can get chewy when served as a fajita. We liked the seasoning so much that we thought this would be great on a tri tip steak and serve with a black bean and corn salad. YUM.

Great spice combination. I added an onion and green bell pepper (seasoned with the spice combo) and cooked with the meat. I also included shredded cheese and diced tomatoes in the fajitas and served with a side of black beans.

This recipe was very easy and tasted delicious. Went camping and made this in a cast iron skillet. Have made this a couple times now and still is great! Will continue to make this for a long time.

Quick easy & delicious. Used my new 'lean mean grilling machine' (not a reference to my husband). Made guacamole instead of sliced avocado & cilantro: avocado, cilantro, lime juice, sweet onion, tomato (when in season) & salt in food processor.

even my 2 year old loved this the spice rub is fabulous and it is so very fast and easy to make

I was a little concerned this would be too dry so I spread a thin layer of refried beans on the tortillas (used whole wheat) before rolling them up. Held together nicely. This is a new favorite recipe!
