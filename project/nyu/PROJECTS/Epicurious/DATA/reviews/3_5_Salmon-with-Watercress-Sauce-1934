Outstanding! I've made this several times. Guests rave about the sauce and beg for the recipe.

With 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream in the sauce, I'd really like to know exactly what qualifies this recipe as "Healthy".

Always a hit, and very easy dish to make. When watercress wasn't available, made it with dill instead. Just as delicious.

Sauce was very bland. Needed a good squeeze of lemon to brighten it up.

I thought this sauce was very easy to make and what I liked about it is that it can be made ahead of time. In fact, I made it twice and I preferred it the second time when I made it ahead of time since it was thicker. What I wasn't crazy about was the texture in that it was not as smooth. My husband and guests though actually liked the texture because they felt that it made the whole sauce seem a lot fresher and not as heavy. I would definitely recommend this. Very tasty and really easy to make.
