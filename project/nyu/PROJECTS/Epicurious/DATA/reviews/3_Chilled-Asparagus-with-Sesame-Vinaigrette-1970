After all these years, I'm still using this recipe. Served it again for Easter dinner today, and it received rave reviews again.

Have to repeat the bland comment..no amount of post-prep improvisation saved this dish. Waste of beautiful asparagus!

I made this for a dinner party with friends and was asked for the recipe several times. I was extremely easy and the prep and assembly can be done ahead of time.

The dish tasted great and was so easy to make! Our dinner guests had seconds and asked for the recipe.

Very easy to make and the dressing was perfectly balanced in flavor. A big hit as an appetizer, just a little difficult to know what type of serving utensils since picking it up with your fingers is a little messy.

We loved this. I made a single recipe of dressing & found it to be just right. The toasted sesame oil was not over powering for our taste, but we love the stuff! I thought that this would also be nice served on a bed of mesclun. Then I would make more of the dressing.

I have made this dish a few times. It is an easy veggie salad to make ahead and take to a BBQ. Worth a try. Just don't over cook the asparagus.

This dish instantly became my wife's favorite asparagus dish. Is recommend one and a half recipe's worth of dressing for two pounds of asparagus.

Excellent veggie side. I added half the amount of sesame oil it called for and there was still plenty of flavor. The toasted sesame seeds really add an elegant touch. Even my veggie hating boyfriend liked it.

I used this as a side dish for a dinner party - we all really liked it. It's elegant and a great do-ahead dish. We didn't think the dressing was too strong and in fact I might recommend making a bit more of the dressing.

We loved this dish. Beautiful to look at too! Great with Sea Bass with gingered vegetables.

This dish was so overpowered by the sesame oil and had such strong flavors, it was hard to even taste the asparagus. I have had several cold asparagus dishes and have enjoyed them very much. This was not something I would ever make again.
