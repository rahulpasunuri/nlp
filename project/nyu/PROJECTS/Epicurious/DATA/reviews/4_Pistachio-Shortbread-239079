Love this, I have made these many times. A really great cookie for something different.

Delicious!!! Rich and buttery. Couldn't be easier. I kept the pistachios whole and let the food processor chop them -- the nut pieces in the cookies were the perfect size. The dough was a bit crumbly but easily formed into logs.

Very easy and delicious. I didn't refridgerate before baking because my sweet tooth was beckoning BUT they turned out just fine.

This is a fabulous non- chocolate cookie. Very easy to prepare (everything just goes into a food processor) and the bit sized cookies are just perfect.

Extremely easy and very tasty. The food processor grinds up the pistachios, though. I would have liked some pistachio pieces. so next time I might try adding the pistachios at the end and giving the dough another couple of pulses.

YUM. Very easy and so worth it. Make the granita as well. This is a great do-ahead refreshing summer dessert.
