Very healthy satisfying soup. Have always make it as directed. May try making our own cream corn next time.

This is an excellent and light soup. Be sure to make the croutons. They really make this soup extra delicious.

I probably would have given this two forks, but the croutons easily kicked it up to a three. The more croutons the better, they make this dish, I probably wouldn't make it again, but my girlfriend has a thing for Lima beans so we shall see...

This soup was perfect for the cold weather we've been having. I added some hot peppers which gave it a nice 'zing'. Didn't make the croutons, but next time I will.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was delicious! Followed advice of others and made double batch of the croutons, which I'm happy I did. Will make again!

I did what another user suggested by adding chicken breasts. I added them to the pot after the leeks/shallots/garlic were softened, just as I added the red pepper. I thought the red pepper got a little too overdone (mushy) and will add it later next time to try to preserve the texture. In addition, I used a whole small bag of Freshlike frozen baby limas and a whole small bag of Freshlike white corn. It's very robust this way--very much like a Brunswick Stew without the sausage. I'm with another user: make lots of croutons, as they're a wonderful textural addition to the soup. Good recipe!

I decided to search for this recipe and rate it because I was thinking of making it again. (I don't make too many recipes more than once.) The croutons were the best part-make extras.

The addition of chicken makes this a main course. Add two uncooked boneless chicken breasts along with the broth. Remove chicken when the soup is at a full boil and let it cool while the soup simmers to a finish. When cool shred the chicken and add some to each bowl. Ladle soup over chicken and garnish.

I made this for Thanksgiving ---skipped the canned corn because I'm not much of a fan for it, added marjoram because that is the spice I associate with succotash. With leftovers I also stirred in baby spinach leaves at the last minute. It was delicious. Make lots of croutons! P.S. Just took soup leftover from Thanksgiving out of freezer (1/4/04) and it freezes beautifully...

I made the entire dinner and this was awesome. My father had two bowls and didn't have room for the rest of the meal. The croutons were the finishing touch

We made the whole menu that goes along with this soup. when reading about this item, my partner and I both thought this sounded heavy. To our delight it was not.Would'nt change a thing.

WOW!!! How could something that seems so simple and ordinary be so satisfying! We had this as a meal rather than appetizer. I browned 3 diced chicken breast halves and set aside before adding the leeks etc. and returned the chicken with the limas. In order to achieve a more stew-like consistency (which was desired for a meal), I just simmered longer. This was just really, really good. My picky son, who doesn't like limas, loved it and ate the leftovers(which taste even better). Don't hesitate to try this one.
