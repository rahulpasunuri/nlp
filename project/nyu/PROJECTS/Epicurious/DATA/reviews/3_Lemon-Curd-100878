My friend made this with a lavender tea cake for my birthday and I loved it! I had never tasted lemon curd before, but now I am hooked! I love this stuff! I can't wait to make some more.

This curd recipe is not an old-fashioned English one. It's not bad, but it doesn't provide quite the depth and flavor I was looking for. It tastes more like lemon pie filling -- which real lemon curd is very little like.

This turned out quite delicious. It was better after a day or so..smoother, more mellow. Definitely a winner.
