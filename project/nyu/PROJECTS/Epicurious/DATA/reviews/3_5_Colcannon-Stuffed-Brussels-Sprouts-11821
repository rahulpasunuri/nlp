Excellant side dish for a New Year's day party! Everyone loved it. Used a melon baller for filling the brussel sprout leaves, much easier than a pastry bag. Will definately make again. Got 2 requests for the recipe.

I love Colcannon to begin with, but to be able to share this with my wedding guests was incredible! It brought tears to everyone's eyes at the thought that I could bring my Great-grandmother's favorite dish into the mix. I'll make it again and again!

very popular with the party guests. I'll be adding a little shredded swiss cheese to the potato mixture next time

Wonderful recipe, fun to make, great way of using comfort food inventively. I like spice and added a bit of horseradish and a dash of Jo B's Chilipaya hot sauce ( You should try all their products! JO B's P.O. Box 316 Warren, Vermont 05674-0316) to the potatoes and it was the first thing to go.
