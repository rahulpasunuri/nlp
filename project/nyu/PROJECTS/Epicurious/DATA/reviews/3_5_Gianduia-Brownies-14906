for the Cook from Brooklyn review. He/She must have overcooked them because mine were very moist. Did you add the butter? anyway I would make these AGAIN.

These are Extremely good from scratch homemade brownies. Made them last night and could NOT stop eating them. Best I have made.

I wish I would have listened to the reviewers who said these didn't come out well. I bake a lot, I used high-quality chocolate and butter, and followed the recipe to a T, and they came out dry, crumbly, and not even that tasty considering all the great ingredients.

I love this recipe. I used extra nutella (because you can never have too much nutella) and less hazelnuts. The first time I made this recipe, I forgot to add the hazelnuts until the brownies were in the pan, so I just sprinkled the hazelnuts on top, and they got nicely toasted and crunchy. The second time I made the brownies, I stirred the nuts into the batter, the nuts came out soft and with little flavor. In the future, I will be sprinkling the nuts only on the top.

I LOVE hazelnuts and chocolate and especially Nutella spread so I couldn't wait to bake these brownies. I used Valrona chocolate! Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this recipe. My brownies came out dry and crumbly. Excellent when mixed in with vanilla ice cream, but not in brownie form. I would suggest using less hazelnuts and watch your baking time carefully. 35 minutes was too long. I think the oil from the nuts combined with the suggested cooking time may have been the culprit.

These are (almost) the yummiest brownies I have ever made! Love the hazelnut/chocolate combo!

I made these for a baby shower where the guest of honor loves hazelnuts. I iced them with nutella --they were a HUGE hit! Very time consuming, but worth it for a special occasion.

These brownies tasted good, and were not too difficult to make, but I have so many other brownie recipes that are better than this that I would not make these again. Also, there is a whole stick of butter in these, so they are very high in fat and just don't taste good enough to justify all those calories. To make things easier I bought hazelnuts that were already skinned, and just toasted them in the oven before grinding them in the food processor. I also melted the chocolate in a pyrex cup in the microwave instead of using a double boiler.

A very pleasant version of the ubiquitous brownie :) I added a little avellanas (hazelnut liquor) to the mixture. Good stuff!

I've never made brownies from scratch before, and this was so easy, and so yummy! I didn't use as many hazlenuts as they called for (so call me stingy) and the effect was still really nice. I LOVED them, and I don't even really like brownies. I couldn't stop eating these!

these brownies were very easy to make (less than ten minutes)- i didn't dehull the hazelnuts- and they still tasted delicious. the combination of hazelnuts and chocolate is great. Icecream and a fruit sause make this the perfect easy pretty dessert. I am definitely making them again.

Here is a secret to skining hazelnuts. Bring to boil 3 cups of water, slowly add 1/4 cup of baking soda and then add 2 cups of hazelnuts. Let it boil for 3 minutes. Drain and rinse. Under running water the pinch off the skins of the hazelnuts. Then dry and toast at 350 degrees for 10 - 15 minutes. This works very well and especially for the Gianduia Truffles.

I had an easier time skinning the hazelnuts in this recipe than I've had before. I think it was because I let the nuts toast in the oven for a good 10 minutes before I took them out. The skins were already falling off on many when I took them out of the oven.

I live in Germany and Nutella is on every table. It costs 1/4 the price. They make nutella crepes at every festival in the country. We chose not to bring my collection of magazines with us and I took a chance hoping to find the recipe online. Poof! There it is so I can make it again...I really should have it memorized by now....

This recipe was a snap to make, mainly because I didn't completely de-hull the hazelnuts. I couldn't find nutella, so I used a different brand of chocolate & hazelnut spread and it worked out just fine.

The toasting and peeling of the hazelnuts was very tedious and difficult. Though as a nutella lover, this recipe was delicious. If you really love nutella, try icing the brownies with it-- simply divine!

I made these brownies once without roasting and peeling the hazelnuts and they tasted the same to us without all the time and trouble it takes to peel them. Very tasty though. I think they would be yummy with a little icing on them too. Next time that's what I'll try.

While these brownies were delicious, I don't think it was worth all the effort of skinning all those hazelnuts! It took forever, and it wasn't easy. Tip: I melted the chocolate in the microwave and it was much easier than using a double boiler, and it turns out just as good.

A must for brownie lovers. Easy to make if you don't mind toasting and de-hulling the hazelnuts. Phenomenal flavor, not too overpowering like some brownies, and an excellent texture.
