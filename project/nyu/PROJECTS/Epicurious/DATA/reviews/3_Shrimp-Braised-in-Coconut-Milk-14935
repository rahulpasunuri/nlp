Really good and plenty of flavor (I'm not sure what other reviewers were talking about when they said it was a bit bland...?) I mixed the scallions and cilantro into the sauce at the end instead of just sprinkling on top--maybe that made a difference? I served the shrimp and sauce atop thin spaghetti instead of the rice, and thought that was a great combo.

I added sriracha to the shrimp marinade and again at the end of the dish with a splash of line juice to finish. I served it over rice with a salad of mango, avocado, sugar snap peas and red onion in a lime vinaigrette. The next day, I added a cup of fresh corn kernals sauteed with a little cumin to the leftover sauce to make an exquisite shrimp and corn bisque. I will definitely make this again!

on its own the recipe is lacking. I just kept tasting it while adding cayenne pepper and oddly enough, sherry. (perhaps added thyme as well). I'm still adjusting it, but it is definitely getting to be quite good.

It was good but there is some scope of improvements or variations here. A pinch of Cayenne is certainly one of them.

Thought this was good...probably 2 1/2 forks. I think cayenne would really help and will add that next time. It has a good, mellow flavor.

I cut this recipe out ages ago--in 1998 when it first appeared, to be exact! I finally in 2007 got around to making it! I was disappointed, however, since I too thought it was a bit bland. Marinating those shrimp as one reviewer suggested may help. Or, perhaps the tomatoes could be pureed with the onions to give the sauce more body.

While this dish doesn't sock-it-to-ya with spices, I really appreciated its subtlety. I served it with coconut jasmine rice (with a touch of cinnamon and cardamom) and the dish was great. I'll definitely make it again and would even make it for guests.

I'm not sure what everyone else saw in this recipe - it was completely bland! Even the addition of extra cilantro and mint couldn't save it.

I love this recipe. I have made it many times--it is my fiances absolute favorite. A little cayenne pepper added to the vegetable base adds a much needed kick to this recipe. I also like to put chopped fresh chiles on top along with the cilantro. A definite keeper!

First time I found, after well into the preparation, that I was out of coconut milk, and only had "coco lopez" the very sweet, thick stuff you use for pina coladas. Too late to retreat -- so I used some of the coco lopez, some regular 1/2 & 1/2 with the stock I had made from the shrimp shells -- and to make the sweet taste work, added hot red pepper. It was wonderful (if you like somewhat sweet) and now I use some of the coco lopez and regular coconut milk. Since you do not use the entire can of either - they both freeze just fine for future use.

We all loved this recipe, I love using coconut milk. The next time though, I would definately zip it up abit with perhaps some ginger or as the others have said, cayenne. A very pretty dish also.

The combination of spices was great but I would make it differently. Instead of adding the green onions and cilantro at the end, I would combine the lime juice, cilantro and green onions use the food processor to combine the ingredients, use this to marinate the shrimp. I did use the green onions and cilantro as garnish but cooked with the sauce before adding the shrimp. It was excellent.

I don't know what went wrong! This was the first dish from this website that was a disaster. There was way too much sauce and the rice totally burned, before being cooked...not enough coconut milk??? The taste was nothing like I expected.

This dish was really easy to make and quick with readily available ingredients! It was rich and yummy and my boyfriend and I loved it. Would definitely make again. I added extra lime juice as well and a dash of cayenne and extra shrimp.

Good flavour, but subtler than comments led me to expect. I added an extra Tbs. of lime juice and a healthy shake each of cayenne and chili powder to the pan. Much better. Use of "lite" coconut milk and 1/2-lb. precooked prawns produced 4 decent sized lunches (not counting the rice) at 127 cal. each!

This was delicious. I added more salt than they say and white pepper and served it over pan seared rad-na noodles. It was a bit hit with my husband and guests.
