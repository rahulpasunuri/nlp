Very good recipe and relatively easy with a lot of flavors. It calls for WAY too much Udon for the amount of meat though, so I would make less, if I were you. I didn't know what Chinese chili garlic paste was, so I minced 3 cloves of garlic and smashed them with some Texas Pete's hot sauce and chili powder and it came out really well. I was scared by the smell of the oyster sauce out of the bottle (yuck!), but all the sauces mixed together wonderfully! Also, don't skim on the scallions :-)

I should have added to my review that I served this with rice, not noodles, and that seemed to work well.

I made this recipe in desperation b/c I had the ingredients; expected nothing after I read the reviews. Seemed to me like boiling the meat probably had a lot to do with the negative comments, so I sauteed the chicken quickly and kept warm in toaster oven at around 250. Instead of the meat/broccoli water, I used the juice that had gathered in the warming-chicken pan. Family loved it! I don't know whether this matters, but I had chili sauce, not paste. The recipe took no preparation, got rave reviews. People took seconds. I almost felt guilty about it.

Udon belong in a soup, not in a stir-fry. Try rice noodles (like in pad thai) or chinese egg noodles, or japanese soba instead.

Definitely would never make again. Very flat, I wound up throwing away any leftovers.

This was a simple and good weeknight meal. Nothing spectacular, but definitely enjoyable. I will be adding it to my "regulars."

I love this dish because of its simplicity and how quick it is--takes me 20 minutes tops from start to finish. Also a comment about the "sliminess" of udon noodles: they have a distinctively different texture than regular pasta. It's really quite lovely if you cook them right. My general rule for them is to boil them with more water than you think necessary for 10 minutes, then rinse as the recipe says. Also, using sriracha chili sauce in lieu of the chili paste I find is a better substitution.

This recipe wasn't bad. I used wheat linguine which worked out well. Next time I make it I'll add more vegetables -- it would have been nice to have some asparagus or snap peas balancing out the pasta. Shrimp would also be really good!

To avoid the noodle slimyness, I cooked the noodles for 5 minutes in boiling water then drained and rinsed. I stir fried the chicken and broccoli then added the premixed sauces and stirred. Then I added the noodles and stir fried them for a couple of minutes. Great!

This isn't a spectacular meal but it is good and easy so I make it often. I don't bother with the noodles and instead replace with wheat spaghetti noodles since I always have them in the house.

If you're a beginner cook, this isn't a bad place to start. It was ok, but it wasn't really something we'd make again. Easy, but not especially interesting. I used linguini instead of the udon (especially given the slimey comments from other reviewers) and I think it was the right way to go.

This dish sounds good...but I have found I cannot replicate my favorite Asian dishes at home. To me, the bottled sauces do nothing for this dish. I will stick with restaurant Asian from now on.

The noodles were slimy and tasted awful. It was my first time cooking udon noodles and I must have done it wrong. I threw them out and kept the rest, which didn't taste all that good either, although it was a little better the next day as leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised that I disliked it so much, given all the rave reviews. Maybe it was just me.

Found this 'flat' - surprised that others found it too spicy. I am sure that some additional ingredients could perk this up .. but I am moving on to another recipe.

This is a great dish and easy to make (I'm a very inexperienced cook). It's a regular for me now.

We absolutely loved this dish! My three year old ate it all too! It's super fast and easy, a great weekday, when you're exhausted meal.

Considering how easy this dish was to make, it was a winner. I too might add a bit more chili paste, and for a little more complexity of flavors, fresh mint and/or basil at the end. A very good reliable dish. FYI, if you purchase udon in package that doesn't have directions in English, the easiest way to cook is to place udon in boiling water. When water comes to a boil again, add one cup cold water. Repeat 3 times, and udon will be done.

Yum.

Gourmet does alot of things very well, but I've come to the conclusion that Asian flavors is not one of them. Hosin and oyster sauce are used to flavor the sauce, not be the sauce itself. The sauce was too salty. We ended up eating left over turkey.

a very easy weeknight dinner. the changes i made were: doubled the amount of chili paste (we like things spicy) and added water chestnuts and diced red pepper. next time i would cut down on the water, the consistency of the sauce was a bit too thin for my taste.

A little spicy with really strong flavor. I'd make it again with less chili paste

A bit spicy with strong flavors. I'd make it again without so much chili paste.
