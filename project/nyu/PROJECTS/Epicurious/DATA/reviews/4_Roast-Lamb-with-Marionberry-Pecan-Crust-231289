My husband thought this was the most delicious lamb he had ever tasted. My kids hated it.

Terrific recipe. I used a Costco boneless leg of lamb and had to clip away the elastic netting that was holding the piece of meat together to apply the crust. I added the sauce and breading and then closed the netting back up with some string. The leg cooked for about an hour to reach 145 and then had to cut away the string and netting after it rested. It was a bit of a mess cutting it up but I just scooped up the crust and served in a bowl as a side. It was absolutely awesome. Wouldn't change the recipe at all.

As a Scandinavian, I immediately recognized the opportunity to use my beloved lingonberry jam, while as a Pacific Northwesterner, I had to go along with the suggestion to use hazelnuts. Fabulous - it was like transporting home in minutes! Minor complaints: The crust did indeed start to burn at 20 min., and I halved the recipe, using one (1-1/4 lb.) rack of lamb, but it was still way too much for two of us. (I was sorry I hadn't invited the neighbors after all.)

If you are making rack of lamb for the first time in your life, here is a hint: you need a cleaver. Your standard Wusthof kitchen knife does not get the job done (properly). The flavor on the lamb was amazing, and the crust was also spectacular, though I don't know if the butter drizzle is absolutely necessary. I felt that the butter dampened the crust and prevented it from becoming crispy. If the butter is a preventive measure from burning the crust (I know pecans burn easily) then I would probably suggest omitting the butter and spraying lightly with oil instead. Otherwise a good recipe - I should have done a test run though prior to serving it on a date!

I made this for Easter, except I made it with a leg of lamb instead of the rack. Because it takes longer to roast, make sure you put a loose tin-foil tent over it to prevent the topping from getting too brown. It was so easy, and incredibly delicious...my family went crazy over it! I made a sauce to go over the lamb (a variation from another reviewer) of the leftover boysenberry jam, garlic, and a little dijon mustard warmed up together. Fantastic!!!

I used a lamb roast instead of two racks of lamb. Although it required a longer roasting time due to the larger cut of meat, this was absolutely delicious -- a hit with our family members over the holidays! I added two large cloves of fresh garlic to the breadcrumb mixture, then processed it all. I used olive oil instead of butter to drizzle on top. I also made a "sauce" by warming frozen blackberries, garlic, a smidge of dijon and some blackberry syrup -- using this as a garnish after slicing the lamb. Served with a large mixed-greens and feta/olive salad along with a side dish of buttered spaetzle seasoned with sauteed onions, garlic and fresh italian parsley. Great dinner.

Amazing and so quick and easy. Made this for my boyfriend and he thought it came from a restaurant.

This recipe is awesome!! I've made twice using bosenberry jam. The second time I went with coursely ground hazelnuts that were toasted lightly instead of pecans. It was even better!!! Yes, I made it again last night with coursely ground hazelnuts, but this time used a black raspberry chipotle sauce. Fantastic!!!

Very easy to make - used blackberry preserves since I couldn't find marionberry or boysenberry and it was fine. You need to watch the lamb at the 20 minute mark, the topping can start to brown too much and burn. Took it out at 22 minutes and it was perfect - between rare and medium rare.
