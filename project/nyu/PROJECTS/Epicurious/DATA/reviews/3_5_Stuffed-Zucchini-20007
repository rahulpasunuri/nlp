I added stuffed green olives (garlic) to this recipe and omitted the anchovy fillets. Still incredible for a great vegetarian menu.

Made these for a side dish and used very small zucchini. Did not parboil them, and skipped the anchovies. Used Ritz crackers and dotted with butter on top and the filling was very good, crisp on top and savory.

It would be sad if the number of reviews indicated the usage of this recipe. This is great all year round. The only change I made was to steam the flesh I had carved out and added to the bread crumb mixture - why waste delicious zucchini?!

I, like the other reviewers, altered this recipe and it turned out great. I did not parboil or bake the squash before stuffing. I browned the cut edges in olive oil, stuffed them (leaving out the anchovies and adding a lot of parmesan, also using a small can of chopped olives), and baked them. They held together well and were cooked to perfection. They presented well and were gone soon.

Deleted the anchovies - the capers and olives add plenty of salt. I also avoided a long parboil and just bake them after the frying. I also like them warm versus room temp. Added a little grated parm cheese on the top and avoided the extra oil by substituting olive oil pam (save on the fat). Excellent way of using the bumper crop of zucchini growing in my garden this summer.

I can't believe the last review for this recipe was in 2001! This was delicious! For those of us who remember James Beard,you surely do know about vegetables cooked to a mush! We do know these days that they can be cooked to a crisp-tender and still be delicious!Even though I still LOVE green beans cooked to death with a good fatty bacon. Do the zucchini in the olive oil(frying pan) and then pop it in the oven(after stuffing)at 400 degrees for about 15min.Thank the Lord and James Beard for food like this!!!!

The taste is superb and delectable. The end product is scrumptious. However, the parboiling makes the zucchinis frail and breakable and in some cases mushy. I think the parboiling if at all should be done briefly and before the sautee-ing. One also has to be careful that one cuts the zucchini in sturdy, even halves so they are break-resistant. I lost at least four halves because they were too small and broke during parboiling. Perhaps instead of parboiling, STEAMING? That'd be much better! It would help if they were bigger zucchinis, but the medium size makes the halves the perfect size for appetizers/finger food. I couldn't keep them on the plates, they were going so fast!
