I used canned clams from Trader Joe's. I drained some of the liquid from the clams into the sauce with the wine, but did not add the clams until the very end because they were canned and so did not need to be steamed. The recipe is so simple and has great flavor!

I loved it. I used whole grain pasta and added chopped spinach. I also added a couple teaspoons of vinegar and extra spicy red peppers.

Used two cans of canned clams in place of fresh. Added 1 bottle of clam juice 8oz Used diced tomatoes 14oz instead of the whole ones with juice. Added a little black pepper and a cup of parmisian cheese.Came out wonderful. This one is a keeper. Will make this again.

I've been ordering this dish from my favourite Tuscan restaurant in NYC for years. This recipe is the replica and it was delicious! Caution on the red pepper flakes as I held back and it was just enough to bring on the heat. I will enjoy this for years to come!

I tweaked this recipe to start with, halved it and cut back on the pepper flakes, used canned clams and canned baby shrimps (my "fresh" little neck clams from Albertson did not open) and added some heavy cream and a bit of cornstarch. Came out great as to the sauce, but I have no idea why they recipe instructs to cook the pasta and set aside. I did that and ended up with cold pasta. Tossed it out and started the pasta over while the sauce cooked down. Great dish I will clearly make again.

This recipe is what 2 forks says...good. Not great, as I expected. I have made it twice, tweaking the second time, and still just okay. Double the clams, half the red pepper flakes, extra sauce, half the pasta - comes out to good ratio of spice and noodles, but still just okay tasting sauce. Still looking for the best clam/linguine recipe...

This was an okay dish, but not great. I agree with the others that this recipe needs more clams (2 lbs.) and less red pepper flakes (1 tsp.). I added more garlic and minced it instead of slicing it, 2 lbs. clams, and 1/2 lb. of shrimp for added flavor. The broth was good, but is thin (and I did not need to add additional pasta cooking water as suggested) so naturally it did not adhere to the pasta at all, redering the pasta bland, even after continuing to cook the pasta in the broth. I also thought 1 lb. of pasta for this recipe was overkill and difficult to handle/toss even in a large stock pot. Next time I make this, I will simmer the tomatoes, wine and garlic a bit longer to allow it to develop and thicken before adding the clams/seafood. I would also use less pasta or skip it altogether and just make homemade bruschetta to dip into the sauce (slice rustic bread, brush w/olive oil, bake in over flipping once until browned then rub with cut garlic halves right out of the oven). This way we can enjoy more of the broth!

I made it to a T, but I wound up with a lot more sauce than the photo shows. Which was fine, because I wanted to drink the stuff. First time making clams for me, and it was a simple yummy dish!

While I liked the addition of the canned whole tomatoes, I thought the recipe turned out quite boring. Won't make it again.

Liked this recipe a lot - used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter; a few more cloves of garlic, only 1 tsp of red pepper to start, and added a 1/2 of fresh lemon. Everyone had seconds

This was delicious, BUT, it was crazy overspiced. My husband is someone who likes to slather his food in hot sauce and this was too hot for even him. My lips were burning and eventually numb. SO, although the flavor was delicious it needs a fraction of the pepper flakes. We think it could also do with 1 of the 6 tbs of olive oil and double the cockles. Easy to make though and fills the house with a wonderful aroma.

I have made Linguine and Clams 1000 times and always search for a balanced sauce. I followed this recipe to the letter (except for the brand of tomatoes) and it was outstanding.

This was the absolute best Clam Linguine. I followed the recipe to the "T" and I would suggest others do the same before messing around with it. Superb!

This recipe is great. The only thing I might do differently is to cook the pasta (linguini) for 8 minutes instead of 9 minutes, but then I like my pasta al dente. This was excellent

I've made this recipe many times and love it (with way less chili flakes, btw)! So, one day as I was making a single portion (1/4 lb pasta, 6 clams, 7 oz of tomatoes) I realized, before the pasta was ready, that it was lacking in sauce for the clams. So looking around, I grabbed the 1/2 a bottle of beer (next time I'll use 1/4 bottle) and poured it into the clam skillet. Continued as per recipe, and it was FANTASTIC!

Truly wonderful, though instead of all the hot pepper flakes, I crushed one dried red thai pepper instead, which gave the sauce a lovely warmth but it was not overpoweringly hot -- I also doubled the amount of clams to 2 pounds, which I would highly recommend -- we were drinking up the juices at the end --

Very flavorful, and extremely spicy, even with less red pepper than called for. Next time, we would decrease the liquid a bit and add a few more tomatoes. We also cut down on the olive oil by a third and didn't miss the extra amount. Would also be delicious with shrimp.

this was a great recipe for what it was- really simple. you had to cut up some garlic and parsley, and that's about it, and it made a delicious refreshing light meal. i used only 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and thought that was plenty, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I made this for Christmas dinner for my husband and I. The only thing I would do differently is add more clams. One pound of clams was not enough for the both of us and I was hungry for more. I couldn't find San Marzano tomatoes so I just used the best organic diced I could find. Delicious and easy!

Good grief! One tablespoon of red pepper flakes totally overpowered this dish, and we're from Texas!! I really shouldn't rate this because it was so hot we couldn't taste anything. Ugh.

I've been making a similar clam sauce and decided to try this one based on the reviews -- it was very bland - no salt! did I miss something - called for salt in the water but no where else - was able to fix to my liking but I guess I will stick with my own authentic recipe from my mother in law in Pulgia - guess I missed the capers!

I decreased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp and it was plenty of heat for me (I'm somewhat of a pansy). Otherwise made it exactly as written, and it was mind-blowing. Will definitely make over and over again.

I'm not one to follow recipe to the word, especially when cooking pasta, as the sky is your limit. It's really hard to mess this recipe up. Not much room for error. One thing I did differently was using fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones. Very fresh. And also added some chives instead of parsley, that added to the flavor, too. Such an easy meal for weeknight. Have made it numerous times!

Amazing recipe!! tried it for husbands birthday and he was impressed big time! first of all, our house smelled like those yummy restaurants we have here at our Little Italy section of San Diego. It wasn't just the deliciuos flavor that engulfed our senses, the taste was to die for. I followed the recipe word for word and it was the best linguine I have ever tasted. Thank you Mario for such a great recipe, this one is going into my recipe folder and I'm sure to use it over and over, it is the best!!

Not impressed for a Batali recipe. I followed the amounts exactly and there was way too much pasta.

This recipe was absolutely perfect - exactly like the spaghetti alle vongole that we had several times in the seaside towns of Italy. The san marzano tomatoes, the cherry variety (if you can find them), are absolutely essential. This one is a keeper.

In a word...fabulous! It's Monday night, our 23rd wedding anniversary and I didn't want to go out but I wanted a nice meal and this really fit the bill! A quick shop, easy to make and it got rave reviews from the hubby AND the kids! I really enjoyed it, didn't mess with the recipe except to increase the clams to 2 pounds and omit the red pepper flakes from the pan...the hubby and kids are not into spicy...and add them to my plate upon serving. A great dinner and I'll definitely make it again!!!

This was such an easy weeknight meal to make. I was too lazy to go to the grocery store, so I used canned clams instead of fresh. I added one can's worth of clam juice to the sauce, packed it full of garlic (our favorite) and used a high quality olive oil. Hubby went back for seconds and is thrilled that there's enough left over to take for lunch tomorrow!

The most important step is to finish off the pasta in the sauce. We loved the heat of the red pepper, but others may want to cut back. Use shelled clams and not canned because the "liquor" adds so much flavor. Very highly recommended.

Although tasty and authentic, the amount of red pepper was way too spicy, and my family likes arriabata! Reduce by at least half.

I had never cooked clams before...a little intimidated...but this was sooo easy and everyone loved it.I prepared as part of the Italian Christmas eve feast, but this will become a regular. Easy, healthy and delicious.

We doubled the clams. Used 2 lbs. Used a lb and a half of pasta. Even splurged on a 6-q sauce pan (all-clad, cost about $150). Spectacular and spicy. Could be the new traditional Christmas Eve dinner.

Pasta's great but I need more than just noodle in my dinner so I upped the clams - 2lb in the shell and about 2c chopped in juice. Also doubled the tomato, parsley and garlic. Held the tomato juice. Used homemade roux to thicken a tad. Faux husband and I exclaimed numerous times that it was the best pasta vongole we'd ever made/had.

Simple but delicious. I added a bit of marinara that I had leftover and it added a bit of zest. The whole family loved it including my 9 and 11 year old boys.

Very good version of this dish. Make sure you have a good cooking wine that will add some flavor. I've also tried with fresh tomatoes and think canned is better.
