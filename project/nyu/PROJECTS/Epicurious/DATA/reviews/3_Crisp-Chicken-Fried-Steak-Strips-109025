Not crazy about this one. The oil was hot but the breading did not stay on the meat when removeing from the oil. We know it's not healthy but if it was good it would be worth the fried food calories.

If this recipe was "a lot of work" and not quick. What do make, Mac & cheese from a box? This was easy and maybe not to the liking of most adults, great for the kids.

I used minute steak cut from the round to speed things up. I didn't find it worthwhile and won't make it again. So many of the recipes on this site seem to be utterly reckless with regard to cholesterol! If you try this, I would suggest mixing up less mustard and mayo. Five large eggs was too much as I made it.

To the cook in Ohio: Use a butcher for the cutting and put the whole thing (sance dipping sauce) into a quart sized zip lock bag. 3 hours later, 4 forks with the kids all wanting it again. This is not the meal for a first date but families with kids will dig it. I plan to skip the panko next time and BBQ on my Smokie Joe the steak on bamboo sticks.

My entire family really loved this recipe. The panko really makes the difference. It makes the meat really crispy and the coating was very tasty. We'll definitely have this one again.

Alot of work and not worth the effort. The dipping sauce was good. Definetly not a quick dish to make.

Actually, my husband made this for dinner the other night. Very yummy. We both really enjoyed the marinade and the steak.
