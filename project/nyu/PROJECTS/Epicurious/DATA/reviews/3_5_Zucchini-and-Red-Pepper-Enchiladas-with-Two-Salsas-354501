Enchiladas should always SINK in the salsa, either green or red salsa, so when preparing the salsa don`t add too many chiles, or it will be too hot (spicy), if you add only 2 to 4 chiles, the salsa will be eatable. When you have your enchilada ready, sink it in salsa and serve it that way, topping it with fresh onion and cream.

I made this without the tomato salsa (can't eat tomatoes) and with some minor modifications and it was delicious. The combination of ricotta salata and the pumpkin-seed salsa was fantastic. As mentioned, I made some minor modifications to make this recipe lower in fat: I did not fry the enchiladas, I used 1 ounce ricotta salata per serving, and I used 1/4 the amount of vegetable oil called for in the salsa, but used about the same amount of water (maybe slightly less) called for.

So Amazing!! I added a little queso fresca to these, not a heavy cheese...just perfect!

First of all, these are not enchiladas. These are flautas. Still very good though. The tomato sauce was a waste. I added tamarindo to the pumpkin salsa and it made all the difference.

A good start, alter it a little to your taste and it is a keeper. The pumpkin seed salsa was really nice and I used goat cheese in the enchiladas.

Haven't tried these yet, but will. The salsa sounds great. Kathy, the Mexican Food Chef and Consultant made me laugh! We don't use green and red peppers and sour cream in México? Hmm, I wonder why these are sold everywhere. Somebody besides me must be buying them!

This was a fun recipe to make. Follow me on Twitter at lauraenoch for some step-by-step photo's. Instead of small corn tortillas, I only had burrito shells. After rolling ingredients up, I wrapped enchilada/burrito in foil and warmed on grill for 5 minutes. Delicious!

I sauteed the veggies because we were having a lot of rain the week I wanted to make these, however, they still turned out great and my whole family loved them. Even the kids didn't complain about it being "too fancy". My 6 year old said it was the best dinner EVER!

Pretty good. I pan fried zuchini, onion, peppers, eggplant. lightly fried tortillas then stuffed, set in pan and waited for my company, and then pan fried them as directed. Really liked the pepita sauce. Used leftover pepita sauce for salad dressing, yum! I think overall I really liked the pepita sauce the best!

This was really delicious and so simple to make. My boyfriend (who isn't a vegetarian) loved it too. The ricotta was light and delicious with the roasted veg. I didn't make the pumpkin seed salsa as I didn't have the ingredients, but I will do next time, as I'm sure it'll add even more to this tasty dish.

This was really more like 3+1/2 forks- my only changes were to lightly pan fry in a small amount of oil- worked well after I learned to slightly flatten the rolled and filled tortilla when it was seamside down in the hot pan. I also used a small amount of crumbled feta inside the endchiladas with the veggies, instead of on top. The two sauces are very complementary - the rich creamy pumpkin seeds ( Trader Joes is a good source_) and the zippy fresh tomatoes- and not much time to put together. They aren't like the usual baked enchilada, but they are delicious, pretty and a great summer meal.

Nothing special...but a fair amount of work for just ok. I was skeptical about frying them (I've always dipped momentarily in oil, then sauce...and rolled quickly before fell apart.) True to my fears, they fell apart...I immediately open flamed the rest of tortillas and served to beach house guests. Have to say, they loved them.

Although delicious, this recipe has way too much oil for my taste. I've always enjoyed serving enchiladas to guests because they could be served out of the oven not the frying pan! The pumpkin-seed salsa was outstanding and I will try this recipe again up to the" Assemble and fry enchiladas" by substituting small flour tortillas for the corn tortillas and baking the enchiladas with the pumpkin-seed salsa and cheese on top.

My wife loved this recipe. I did not change much, just used seasonal squash instead of just zucchini, skipped raw onions in the tomato salsa (and added cumin to it), and finally used queso fresco in the enchiladas before frying them. The melty cheese was perfect!

Kathy the "Mexican food consultant" asks what's with the pumpkin seeds. Obviously, her consulting does not extend to the cuisine of the interior Yucatan, where pumpkin seed sauce is the traditional sauce, served with almost everything. This dish was absolutely delicious. Even my 10-month old loved it (through the food mill, of course).

Great easy recipe- The reviewer notes are correct- use less water! also, if you like spicy then add additional peppers to the salsa pepitas and the tomato salsa- I don't understand replacing the pumpkin seeds- it would be like swapping fish for chicken- we loved this - it tasted fresh and went well with a pork in adobo-

Good, but not very exciting. We tried it with pesto on the inside instead of the pumpkin seed mixture. My kids liked it that way very much.

It sounds more like a fajita than an enchilada. Where's the delicious enchilada sauce?

Very tasty! I made a few changes--I added a little bit of goat cheese as the first layer in each enchilada and really think it gave it the extra kick necessary. (I still used the creme fraiche as well!) I also could not find pumpkin seeds in my grocery store so I used shaved almonds instead which were delicious.

My first hint that this would not go as hoped was when moths flew out of the bag of pepitos that I had just bought. Once that disaster was averted, things went fairly smoothly until I burned my finger trying to put the enchiladas seam side down in the pan -- never did get that right -- and then had to listen to my daughter and husband caterwaul about no meat. I did find them quite tasty, but probably won't make them again.

The word "enchilada" means 'in chile sauce' You must take the tortillas and lightly saute in hot oil them for a few seconds to make them soft and pliable. Blot off the oil with paper towels. Spread each tortilla with some salsa, place your filling across the tortilla, roll up placing the filled tortilla-seam down on the baking platter-covered with a thin layer of salsa- Repeat filling the tortillas. Cover the 'enchiladas' with the remaining salsa and bake for 20 minutes. Or in the microwave for 5 minutes. To serve, top with creme fraiche and finely chopped onions. In Mexico we don't use sour cream or red or green sweet peppers. What's with the pumpkin seeds? Kathy, Mexican Food Specialty Chef & Food Consultant

Reading this recipe made my mouth water. Is it as good as it sounds?

These were a great twist on the usual cheese-laden enchiladas. I added only a 1/2 cup of water to the salsa, and because I forgot to buy pumpkin seeds used walnuts instead. I know, not the same at all, but still delish. On a side note, the leftover vegetables and salsas made great toppings for a version of huevos rancheros this morning.

I tried to give these to my kids (2 and 4) and that was a no go, but the adults loved them. Less water is definitely important for the pumpkin seed salsa and we used sunflower seeds because that was what we had and it was really good!

These were pretty good, but I was really disappointed with the pumpkin-seed salsa. 1 1/2 cups of water was way too much, I should have trusted my instinct before adding it. I think it would have been much better w only 1/2 cup at most.
