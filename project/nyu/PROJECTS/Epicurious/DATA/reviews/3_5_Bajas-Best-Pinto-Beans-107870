A good, basic bean recipe. Definitely go with dried beans and soak overnight. Way too salty and way too sweet. I'd cut both back by half. Add a little cinnamon to make it interesting, and if you like it hotter, add some hot sauce. Overall, pretty good.

Very tasty! We really enjoyed this recipe which lets the flavor of the beans shine through.

Beans by their nature are mild and this dish does give them more flavor than any other dish I've tried. I have now done this dish with both pinto beans and black beans. The pinto beans were better but the black beans (especially with a touch of orange zest in the end) were also good. This is now my go to recipe for beans. T

I love mexican food and this has been one of my staple recipe's since it first we published in bon appetit 5 years ago.

The beans are really good, although this dish has a sweetness that was unexpected and threw me a bit after I tasted it the first time. I may try it again with only 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I also added a packet of Sazon Goya at the very end, which I think enhanced the flavor.

I've made this recipe several times, and it turns out well every time. I like these precisely because you can taste more subtle flavors and they aren't overpowering as a side dish. But if you like the overly salty cheese-drenched bad-Mexican-restaurant style of beans, these may seem bland.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the jap. They were delicious. My husband and two year old loved them. I can't imagine anyone thinking they are bland. They are also delicious wrapped in a tortilla with tomatoes, cheese, and avocado.

So thankful for epicurious! I had lost the magazine with these beans, and couldn't for the life of me remember which publication it even belonged to! My family loves these beans, and are so excited that they are on the menu tonight for the first time in years!

Great beans. Just a few points. I soaked them in water overnight, so they didn't take anywhere near 2 hours to cook, though it took that long to reduce the liquid (they were covered tightly for the first hour). If you soak them, I would recommend using less liquid and planning for less cooking time. Also, I took the review recommendations and used broth (bouillion cubes for 8 cups and canned broth for the las 1 1/2 c) and it turned out WAY too salty, even for a salt lover like me. I'm adding fresh tomatoes and cheese when I serve them to cut the salt, which tastes good, but it's definitely a sodium kick. A lot of people recommended using beer. Next time I'll try a combo of broth and beer. Also, I think that serving them whole (unmashed) is great.

Rave reviews on this easy and yummy recipe, which I've made several times. I've added an additional half of a jalapeno to spice it up, and don't mash the beans as much as indicated in the recipe -- we like them a bit "chunky." This recipe is a household staple now.

Turned out well, but taking into account some of the blandness issues noted in the reviews, I used chicken broth (which added some salt) instead of water and threw in double the garlic, so I'm only giving two instead of three forks. Since the seasoning was delicious as revised, I can imagine the original recipe must be fairly bland.

Yummy. Made these last night and they were a hit. Very authentic and tasty. Served on corn tortillas with jack cheese, shredded cabbage, sliced avocados and a home-made pico de gallo. Satisfying and oh so healthy.

This is one of my favorite recipes from Bon Appetite. So healthy, so easy to make, and so tasty. I use two jalepenos and they aren't overly spicy. Spread on a flour tortilla for the perfect bean burrito, eat as a side to any dish, or use as a dip for tortilla chips--this is so delicious. Can't believe it's gotten any bad reviews at all. After the second hour it will appear that there still needs to be more water evaporated, but just start mashing and it will become the perfect consistancy. Don't change a thing on this recipe!

This recipe needs changes to make it tasty. Even after using a combo of beer and beef stock instead of water, and blackstrap molasses instead of brown sugar (I have low iron) the beans were a little bland. There are better recipes on this site.

Like my six year old said, "now these taste like restaurant beans." I omitted the peppers for the kids sake and forgot the sugar, but they were still great and my family is asking for them again. We were so glad to find a recipe that allowed us to make our favorite Mexi-style whole beans at home. Thanks epicurious!

Next time, I'll open up a can of vegetarian black beans - they would have tasted much better than this recipe. Very bland.

Easy and quick, as far as dried beans go. Next time I'll omit the brown sugar - didn't care for the sweetness. Otherwise, simple and yummy - good replacement for refried beans.

Will make these beans again, as everyone liked this healthy alternative to refried beans with barely any fat and all the taste!

I thought this recipe was very good! We were doubling it and found that the liquid took a VERY long time to reduce. Next time I would recommend using quite a bit less water.

I loved this recipe beans. A healthy alternative to refried beans.

These are okay but not so good I'd make them again -- I've made better refried bean recipes.
