I find this "rub" overwhelmingly salty, what with it's 4/3 ratio of salt to black pepper. I could use this as a "sprinkle" on certain meats, but rarely. To me, a rub has a more extensive variety of ingredients, and salt and sugar are used much more sparingly.

I, for one, am grateful for the recipe, as I would have no idea of proportions. Martha Stewart has a similar recipe on her website, containing the same 3 ingredients. So I don't think it's a joke or a "duh" recipe at all. Some of us have never made a rub before, and didn't grow up eating it. This was really good, and I'll make it again.

I can tell the chef, Elizabeth Kamel, went all out with this one.

Well, duh. This is not a recipe; this is a joke.
