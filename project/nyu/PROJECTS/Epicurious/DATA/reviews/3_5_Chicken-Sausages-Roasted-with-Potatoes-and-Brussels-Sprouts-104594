I'd been looking for something to make with some chicken apple sausage I had on hand and this was wonderful and simple. I used sweet potato, onion and brussels sprouts. Thanks to reading others' reviews, I shortened the cooking time (25 min @ 400 for 1st, 15 min @ 475 for 2nd, 15 min @ 475 for 3rd) temperatures. I added lemon juice, thyme and s&p to the sprouts and onions before roastng. Perfect comfort food.

Excellent! Tasty -- sausage was the best part.

What's not to like about roasted potatoes and sausages? Adding brussel sprouts is apparently the one sure fire way to screw this simple recipe up.

Excellent! Tasty. Sure enjoyed the sausage.

I added the thinly sliced onions as suggested and set the oven to 400 degrees. The dish defintely did not need all the time alloted; I just kept an eye on it. Instead of potatoes (we're trying to eat low carb) I added a couple pasilla chiles. Delicious for a snowy cold day. Yum.

made changes as suggested by previous reviewers: add asparagus and thinly sliced onion, lower temp and cooking times, add tad garlic, incorporate fresh thyme earlier, squeeze lemon juice over dish at end. the taste was super, but the brussel sprouts and potatoes were not quite tender! definitely will make again, and when i do, i'll halve or quarter the brussels sprouts and cut the potatoes into smaller cubes. that ought to do it. can't wait to do with leftovers as previous cook did: frittata!

This is a delicious one dish meal. We love brussels sprouts. I used spicy chicken sausages, delicious!

I love brussels sprouts and was sure this would make a brussels sprout lover out of my sister who is much less of a fan of them. Unfortunately, that did not happen, but I will make this again for the rest of my family. I loved this recipe.

This was great! So easy, delicious and the leftovers were put in a frittata two days later and that too was fantastic.

I used chicken sausages with sun dried tomatoes and basil. Very tasty dish but I also agree that the cooking times are too long.

I've served this dish to my family several times and everyone loves it. Cooking times are definitely too long, though. I have tried using other sausages when the chicken-apple have not been available, but the chicken-apple's are what makes the dish.

This dish made a brussels sprout lover out of my 4 year old. I love it, but agree with reviewers about monitoring oven temp., browness of sausages.

Delicious! I added chopped garlic and Herbs de Provence, I didn't have red peppers so substituted onions and carrots. Cooking time is a little long, so I shortened it just a bit. I will make this again and experiment with different veggies.

Very delicious. I added some fennel wedges to the vegetable mix since I had some on hand. Great addition. Also, I think it's a must to reduce the cooking temp (to about 400F) and times. Just keep an eye on it. Good with mustard at the table.

I would love to get this right. I also reduced the time and temperture, but the sausages are always dry and overdone. The potatoes and brussel sprouts are wonderful.

A pretty good recipe, although unless you have fresh brussel sprouts I wouldn't bother. Definitely make it with a sweet sausage like the chicken apple sausage, and I would recommend really monitoring the temperature of your oven so you don't burn everything. I cut the cooking time down by about 10% on each of the stages, and it turned out perfectly.

We did not enjoy this dish at all. Cooking times are overlong, and the vegetables suffered for it. Burned and bitter were the preominant flavors. Even less forgiveable, was that the dish is completely unremarkable. Although we love the ingredients, their flavors neither blended nor improved. We will not make this again.

This was quite tasty, but could be made even better. The next time I make it, I will brown some garlic in the olive oil before I add the potatoes, and use more salt and pepper than before. I will also mix the thyme with the vegetables for the last 15 minutes of roasting instead of using it as a garnish--that was a lost opportunity to add more flavor. The suggestion to use asparagus in lieu of one of the peppers was a good one.

Excellent recipe - easy, healthful and very tasty.

I made this recipe for a large dinner party. While I wouldn't say that it made for elegant dinner fare, it was well received by everyone. Hearty and unusual everyone on our ski trip asked for seconds. I especially liked the lemon zest. I admit I was skeptical, but it was a perfect accent.

This is a great one-dish meal and kids love it. My kids love the new gourmet sausages. I substitute another green vegetable instead of brussel sprouts and it is great. I have used broccoli and green peppers.

This was easy and tasty. I sustituted fresh asparagus for a pepper, used lemon juice instead of peel and it won raves. I used 4 chicken apple sausages and 4 lemon tarragon chicken sausages. It was a nice combination.

Add thinly sliced onion to the potatoes at the very start, and you will have a wonderful, carmelized finished product. I also squeezed the lemon juice over after I zested it. Awesome....especially on a rainy night.

I just wasn't impressed by this recipe. We love all the ingredients, especially brussels sprouts -- but the sprouts in this recipe came out bitter and not very tasty. Once you remove the brussels sprouts from the platter (and we did), what's left is some roasted potatoes with sausage -- serviceable as a Sunday night dinner, but not one of the special dishes I've come to love from this site. We won't do this again.

This one surprised me. I do not like brussels sprouts and am not wild about red peppers. This was good. I really only tried it because I had everything on hand (using Aidells Chicken-Apple sausage). My wife, sister-in-law and I all agreed this is a doer.

Great recipes, reasonably priced to make and family loved it.

Delicious! I did it exactly as written, although it took about 10 minutes less for the meat/potatoes and about half the time for the vegetables. The flavors were excellent and the presentation was beautiful - and everyone loved it! I used a chicken-apple sausage along with an Italian hot turkey sausage. The chicken-apple was better. I will make this again.

This was horrible!The worst EVER! The flavors were either unnoticable or overpowering and didn't go together at all. This recipe is a complete waste of time, and the directions had you roast the vegetables at far too high a temperature for too long.

My family and two young boys loved this recipe. I knew my children would not like the brussel sprouts so I substituted with fordhook lima beans frozen that I cooked just a little, drained and set aside. Because of this my total cooking time was about 45 minutes total. I also did not have red peppers so I used chunks of onion. I had purchased the chicken apple sausage like the recipe suggested. Everyone gave this a thumbs up - can't wait to serve it for my friends now and would not change a thing.
