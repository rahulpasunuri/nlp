This recipe looked interesting and when I found some lavender honey I figured I had to try it. I served it with fresh blueberries and some lavender simply syrup drizzed on top. Delish! I must have packed the crust too tightly or perhaps I should have greased the pie plate because the crust stuck to the plate and did not adhere to the pie filling. Otherwise, it was great.

This pie was just delicious. It is extremely rich, so I would suggest cutting slices that are 1.5" thick at the outside edge, which would provide considerably more servings. I made it with Stonyfield lowfat plain yogurt since that's what I had on hand, and my lavender honey was from Williams Sonoma. I was not all that impressed with the honey. Next time I make this I'll try using a spring flowers honey. I can't recall the brand that I've used before but it's one commonly available at the Food Emporium here in NY. I found the oats in the crust to be the perfect accent in the pie. They added a lovely nuttiness that complemented the rich flavor of the filling and cut through the sweetness of the graham cracker crumbs. The pie had an elegant presentation as well. Another change I'll make for next time is to sprinkle some edible flowers on the serving plate or pie itself.

Very light and tasty. I used peaches for the topping and. it was a huge hit at a dinner party. I used gingersnaps for the crust, which was delicious but made the crust a little too hard. (Or I may have packed it too tightly.) Next time I will try it with a combination of graham crackers and gingersnaps.

Delicious...the flavor is sweet and floral, yet acts subtly on the palate. The only problem I can find is that the crust is not very cohesive, and falls apart very easily.
