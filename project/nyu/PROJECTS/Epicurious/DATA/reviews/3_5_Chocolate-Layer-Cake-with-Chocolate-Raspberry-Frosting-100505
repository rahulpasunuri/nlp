Four forks for the cake! moist and delicious. However, the frosting was kinda weird! I think it was the sour cream in it that I didn't like, it gave it a weird flavor, I like my frosting sweet and smooth! I will use a different frosting recipe next time!

My all time favorite chocolate cake recipe. I don't bother with anything on the sides of the cake but otherwise make is exactly according to the recipe. And the best part - the FROSTING is the bomb! You end up with a bit too much but it freezes well. I have also used it on other cakes. A big winner!

This cake was fanTAStic. The cake itself was the perfect amount of lightly sweet, so as to allow the frosting's flavor to shine, and the texture was delightfully soft. I only had enough raspberry jam in my fridge to whisk into the frosting, so I didn't put any between the layers, but I had SO MANY chocolate cookies (one bag has way more than 10!), so I crushed all of them and sprinkled some in between each layer in addition to pressing some on the sides. I put the last bit of frosting in a pastry bag and piped some decorative stars around the top, alternating with raspberries, and it came out looking great. Everyone who had a piece (about 20-25) was raving about it. I will definitely make this again!

Encountered some difficulties, but mostly because of my inexperience baking. Didn't take terribly long, but this isn't a quick recipe by any means. Everyone absolutely loved the final product, however. I agree; the chocolate wasn't fudgy enough for my taste, but not everyone likes a heavy chocolate cake. This is definitely a nice recipe for a dinner party since it's light and most people will like it. I will agree that the frosting is by far the best part!

The frosting is the best part of this recipe. Deeeeelicious. The cake part was not amazing, in my opinion - I prefer a much fudgier cake. But no other complaints - wasn't too hard and all my guests liked it. If I made this again, I would use a different recipe for the cake part.

Time consuming but worth it. I made a double batch, with 4 layers instead of 2. The cake was a bit crumbly, so i had a hard time slicing, but tasted amazing. Make sure you use a good quality raspberry jam, the taste shows through. Lots of frosting left over, used the suggested recipe.

I loved this cake as well as those who tried it. Everyone was asking me to make it again. It was time consuming, but the results were worth it. I did add more butter to the icing to thicken it and to add a buttery flavor. I chilled it for a couple of hours to set and it was fantastic.

the cake turned out beautifully. i didn't try the frosting, because i don't care for chocolate frosting, and I used strawberries instead of raspberries. Also i omitted the espresso powder to no ill effect. I'll make this one in the future

It turned out so well! A success the first time I made it, so excited. I used two 8" pan and simply cut off thin layers from the top and the edges for the crumbs, so the cake is in perfect round shape. The funny thing is, as I finished decorating the cake and putting the cake in the fridge, Guess what I found in the fridge? The two eggs that were supposed to be IN the cake safely lying there BY the cake!! So, there I did, made a delicious low-cholesterol beautiful raspberry chocolate cake! ^O^ Still Yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. The layers were beautiful. I was pleased with the heaviness of the cake because it was easy to handle and sturdy. I will put more frosting between the layers next time because I ended up with a lot of extra. My guests were very impressed.

Delicious and a huge hit! Substituted fresh brewed espresso for the powder and water and made in a bundt pan. No need for frosting...just sprinkled w/powdered sugar for a nice contrast.

Although this cake was time-consuming to prepare, it was well worth it. I only made two larger layers, instead of four. The frosting was excellent! It was extremely rich, so it can serve many more than indicated.

i used a different frosting, but the cake got raves at a recent baby shower. i doubled the recipe and used 10" pans; after more than an hour in an iffy oven i was afraid it would be bone dry, but it turned out moist and rich and well worth the wait.

I started making this cake about two years ago for my mother's birthday. It has since become one of my family's favorite. It is now requested a many of my family functions. It is a really great tasting cake.

This was the worst cake I've ever made. I have to admit to having a new Kitchenaid mixer and a new oven, so the sawdust texture could be due to over mixing (though I tried to watch it and make sure not to do this) and the oven might cook hot (though I've not had problems with other dishes). The cake had good flavor but was very dry and I followed the directions to a tee! I was disappointed after reading the other reviews.

I have not actually made the cake yet. I don't know what chocolate wafer cookies to use. I have the chocolate wafers that are a flat round disk, I also have the chocolate wafers that are finger length with a chocolate center between 3 or 4 wafers. I would like to make this April 14th so I would like it if someone could please e-mail me. My e-mail address is Brionna1999@msn.com. Thank-you for your help. Belinda

I made this for a birthday party & it was a big hit. I made a 2-layer sheet cake instead of all the round layers, & it was plenty rich with just 1 layer frosting & preserves inside. I left out the crumb coating & instead frosted it smooth, piped a shell border around the top & bottom, & scattered raspberries on top. It looked great, & I had plenty of frosting left over for cupcakes.

This recipe was great. Unfortunately, I followed the recipe in the magazine first (I save all my Bon Appetits) and as soon as the cakes were on the racks, I knew something was wrong. Looked it up online and remade it; it came out delicious. Thank you epicurious for saving the day! Very disappointed that Bon Appetit had an error. One box of raspberries would have been sufficient.

I made this cake for a friends birthday party. The presentation was great and everyone scrambled for seconds. A solid addition to my dessert repertoire.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and it was wonderful. I just used regular cocoa instead of dutch process, which was fine. Also, one basket of raspberries was plenty. Very pretty cake!

I only made the cake part of the recipe, and it was excellent. I made a raspberry butter-cream filling and chocolate ganache icing, and served it with raspberry sauce. Yum.

This was one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever made! The frosting was very good and the cake was rich and moist. I found that spreading on the raspberry jam before iceing improved the flavor and also eliminated crumbs.

It is interesting that my daughter (the elegent cake maker of the household) made the recipe from the magazine and followed the directions. I like "fudgy" cakes and would have had her make it again even if the recipe was incorrect. She remarked that the batter seemed thinner than any she had ever worked with. We will try it again with the correction and maybe work out a compromise after tasting the on-line version.

I made this cake for a wedding last month and am planning to use it again this weekend for a party. I thought that the consistency and the flavor were wonderful. Several wedding guests said it was the best wedding cake they had ever had!!

Well, it's good to know that I'm not alone. I was very disappointed by this recipe, because the cake just looked so beautiful. It turned out dense & fudgy, not "cakey." The batter was terribly thin, I didn't realize there was a correction to the liquid quantity when I made it. The frosting, however, was tasty & I would try it with another cake recipe.

I WAS DUMB ENOUGH TO TRY IT TWICE. AFTER SEEING IT THE FIRST TIME, I WAS SURE I DID SOMETHING WRONG AND SUBSEQUENTLY MADE THE SAME "MISTAKE" TWICE. I'VE SEEN VERY THIN BATTERS BEFORE, SO I WASN'T CONVINCED THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE RECIPE UNTIL I CHECKED ON LINE. WILL DO THAT FIRST NEXT TIME.

Frosting was great - but the cake was terrible - I made it from the recipe in the magazine which has 1 2/3 cups too much liquid. Maybe I should have been smart enough to catch the printed error, but I didn't. So it was a total BOMB and on Valentines day to boot. Can't believe there was no correction or apology in the subsequent issue of the magazine.

For those of you who noticed the discrepancy between our recipe and the one in Bon Appetit, please note that 2/3 of a cup is the correct amount for the water.

I used the recipe out of the magazine and was mortified when I saw the consistency of the batter. I baked it anyhow and ended up with flat layers. I thought the ratio of liquid to flour looked conspicuous so I checked the recipe online. The one in the magazine calls for 2 1/3 cups of boiling water instead of 2/3 cup as is on the website. Oops!!!! I guess that would explain the problem. Anyhow, I plan to remake it tomorrow, then I will rate it.

The cake is wonderful. I was confused about the frosting because the actual recipe is not included with the cake. I had to go back in the recipe file to locate it. I recommend that the frosting be included with the cake recipe rather than just stating "make the frosting". This really is a very good chocolate cake - moist and wonderful.
