Fantastic timing for this recipe for Halloween, needing a quick/easy dinner for trick-or-treat night! Happened to have imported "Spaghetti al nero di seppia" on hand -- I try to snag unusual pastas when I see them. So they made a fine dinner: Black Snakes with Eyes of Newt (12 littleneck clams) and Brains of Toad (1/2 lb. smoked salmon shreds with the orange peppers and the rest). The squash stayed on the side, in deference to picky kid (who also rejected the clams, but they were easy to avoid). I actually just sauteed the peppers, garlic, pepper flakes and thyme, added some white wine and chicken broth and the clams, simmered til clams were done, then mixed in cooked pasta and salmon, while separately roasting squash. Also used unchopped black jumbo olives stuffed with pimiento which sort of rolled around. Not "best I've ever had" but tasty and fun dinner. The black spaghetti tasted like usual.

You can color regular pasta simply by adding food coloring to the boiling water. It's much cheaper than squid-ink pasta and the process is a lot of fun (and something you can engage your children with). I make "Zombie Innard" pasta for Halloween and make the intestines by boiling the spaghetti with red food coloring. Combine several colors to make black.

Granita? I hope you mean gremolata...

This looks absolutely fantastic! I think we will try this recipe this year! I love the idea of tossing in some shrimp. I found that Amazon sells the ink pasta: http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=black+pasta&tag=googhydr-20&index=gourmet&hvadid=6058472107&ref=pd_sl_3cgaxcnzr9_e

Intellectually I understand the premise, and it seems kind of cute, the children may get a real kick out of this pasta, and I understand that; but maybe because I'm something of a pasta lover, I even make my own out of Semolina, I have to say that this is the most unappealing looking pasta I've ever seen. That dark black colour is simply unappealing to me.

OUTSTANDING! Black pasta is a bit harder to find in suburban Virginia than it was in New York City but the search is worth it. I have made this every year for Halloween since it was first published and it has never failed to receive RAVES! Toss in a few grilled shrimp, and top with a granita of lemon rind, Basil, and garlic- absolut HEAVEN!

I found black pasta at a supermarket called Treasure Island in Chicago. It was almost $6 for 10oz; I used about half that because I split the recipe into two. It was a good dish, but I was intrigued with the butter comments so I added some. I also didn't have a big enough pan (really) so I used a 8x8 or so tin. I should have bought a baking sheet or stone because I felt as if my vegetables weren't roasted/dry enough. Anyway, the recipe was tasty and original and attractive. The flavors combine well together to make an excellent fall treat. For some reason, my shopping list included parmesan cheese, but only when I sorted by aisle. So I bought some but didn't use any when following the recipe, but I think it would be interesting to try some with the dish!

not sure if is was the squid ink pasta or dry-roasting the veggies, but this dish was very very dry, gluey and underwhelming for the hefty price of the pasta. If I were to make this again, I would pan-saute the squash in olive oil to maintain some of the moisture.

I wish I had read that last review before I went grocery shoppingthe closest I could get to black pasta is dark green spinach pasta at Whole Foods. I don't know if the black pasta would contribute to the flavor at all, but I found the problem with this to be that the flavor of the pasta was a little lacking. The squash mixture is great, and the spicy red pepper is a perfect touch, but the pasta needs to be first coated in butter or oil or something, just to give it a little extra something. I would only make this again if I had the black pasta.

My boyfriend came back from the grocery with BLACK PASTA and said for $3, he wanted to give it a try. Archer Farms of TARGET (of all places) is where he found it, along with a pkg of chili pepper-flavored spaghetti! I'm still trying to figure out how to best utilize this rare find... Maybe a mix of black and chili-pepper spaghetti and a cream sauce?

You can find it at specialty stores, or you can make your own if you can find some squid ink.

This sounds wonderful but WHERE do you find black pasta?
