No time for creme puffs so used store bought dessert shells. Loved the summer flavor, contrast between the filling and sauce - and the mint was a great touch. Everyone loved it!

Used my own puff recipe, used canned mango and pureed the mango for the filling so that I could use a pastry bag and tip to fill the puffs (cutting them is messy). Great do-ahead desert and don't skip the mango-mojito sauce!

Loved the lightness of the filling... the puffs were very good but I also had the problem of the puffs collapsing a little in the middle when cooling. I read in a pastry cookbook that it was probably because the heat was not consistant enough and/or the cooking time was too short. Next time I make these, I'll try to take the advice. Overall, a good recipe.

I've made cream puffs before, this recipe resulted in flat puffs- good flavor, not enough puff. I'd recommend using your favorite puff recipe instead. The mango filling was light,but flavorful; not too sweet- so it was great as a summer dish. The mojito sauce was fabulous! The mint was a terrific compliment- I used some mint leaves as garnish also. (Served a Sauterne as the dessert wine.) Everyone loved- all but licked their plates clean! (The puffs were really my only problem; and the mangos took forever to peel...!)

To the Wash. D.C. cook, to reverse the pans just put the top one in the bottom and the bottom one on the top. No need to change racks around.

jastob: at the end of the ingredient list it says "spiced mango-mojito sauce." that's a link to the recipe for the sauce-- just click. :)

I would like to try this recipe, but I don't see the sauce recipe (spiced mango mojito)How would I get this?

A keeper, it is just delicious and so different from ordinary cream puffs. Perfect for a summer evening dessert. I will serve it again at a shower.

I recently made this recipe for a family dinner and everyone raved at the flavors combined together. It was a hit!

A question before I attempt this recipe: What do they mean by reversing the baking sheets? Changing their position in the oven from bottom to top or rotating them back to front?

Delicious! I've made this dish twice already and they were big hits. The first time the puffs came out perfect but the second time the puffs didn't puff up as beautifully (though the taste was still there)... the difference? It's because I used an electric mixer to stir the eggs in the second time. I recommend hand stirring the eggs into the dough. Also, I'd halve the amount of sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

I agree this was very delicious! I loved the combo of mint and mango. I had trouble w/ the puff - i think i didn't cook it long enough so it didn't puff up - but it still tasted awesome!

OH MY GOSH!!! This was heaven on a plate! Delicious! I made the puffs larger, so that all my guests had one large puff...next time I may make them smaller simply for presentation purposes. I did not have spiced rum, so I used Meyers Rum and it was fine. Make sure you follw the baking instructions for the puffs CAREFULLY!
