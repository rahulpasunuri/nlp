My husband and I loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly. I served the scallops with a mushroom risotto and sauteed spinach. The only change I would make is that next time I'll use 2 lbs. of scallops as I had extra sauce. I just poured some sauce over the risotto...yummy! I saw the comment from a cook from Redondo Beach on 2/14/13 who commented that she used 1/2 cup of wine instead of the 1/4 vinegar. I might try that next time as I thought the sauce was a bit tangy. My husband on the other hand thought it tasted wonderful as is. This would be an elegant entree for a romantic dinner for two :) My two youngs sons (ages 5 and 8) have not yet acquired a culinary taste for gourmet scallops which was ok with Mommy and Daddy...more for us ;)

This was easy, and my picky husband loved it, I made it exactly as told.

Just one word to describe it: divine. Probably one of the best main course recipes I've made - at least in the seafood category. The only change I made was using 1/2 cup of white wine instead 1/4 wine + 1/4 vinegar as I was concerned it might have been too tart for my husband's taste (it is Valentine's Day after all so didn't want to risk it!). I may follow the recipe exactly next time to compare.

Delicious and easy.... Had to make a few substitutions; green onion and garlic, and I only had apple cider viiniger on hand. I dipped one side of scallop in mixture of panco and flour, then seared in olive oil and butter. They got nice and golden in non-stick skillet. Definitely keep warm in oven covered in foil, while you make the sauce. I served on a platter, top scallops with sauce and fresh basil. Served with crusty bread for dipping. Rave reviews from all!

This was great. Make sure to reheat the scallops briefly before serving because they kind of got cold when they were sitting on the plate while I was make the buerre blanc.

Very easy and tasty-the key is to use fresh tarragon

Rating: 4
This was easy and very impressive using beautiful U-10 scallops. I used lemon zest instead of tarragon because that's what I had on hand. I will be making more buerre blanc in the future. The sauce also paired well with blanched & sauteed broccolini I served alongside. Next time I will make a potato puree as well and play around with flavors.

I wasn't raised on seafood, and this was my first attempt at making scallops. I used large frozen scallops, and I set the timer for 5 minutes to make sure that I didn't overcook them. I made the recipe as is. It is very good, and it's a keeper.

3/4 lb scallops were just the right amount if you want a bit of exta sauce (crusty bagguette). I used rice wine vinegar and half the butter. I believe te directions to reduce to 2 T is not right but just reduce until liquid disappears. Juice from the scallops was minimal; I returned the scallops to the sauce to heat through so careful not to overcook the scallops at first.

Rating: 4
This was a most wonderful dish. It was very easy and it took very little time to make. Just be patient to allow the liquid to reduce slowly as it will deepen the flavor. I also used a tarragon white wine vinegar which brought out the flavor even more. I poured about half the sauce over the scallops and put the remaining sauce in a small serving bowl as it seemed to make quite a bit of sauce. The extra sauce was not wasted as we used it to top our homemade popovers. I will definately make this dish again!

I've made this recipe multiple times because it is so amazing. It is so simple, but very impressive to dinner guests. I also usually use frozen scallops because they are cheaper and taste just as great!

made this for valentines day with my wife and we both loved it. went with frozen scallops since thats all we could find and substituted dry vermouth for the dry white wine and that worked out quite well.

Paired with risotto with butternut squash, leeks & basil (also from this site) for Christmas Eve dinner. The beurre blanc was very rich & a little too salty-- but possibly because we plated the scallops then poured the sauce over each plate, instead of drizzling the sauce over scallops on a serving platter.

Rating: 4
YUM. I did not feel that anything was over- or underwhelmed in this recipe. I used frozen scallops and rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and I actually only used 5 tbs of butter, instead of 7. And it was still a luxurious-tasting dish. The sauce has a sweet-tangy taste, but again, not so strong that it takes away from the scallops. The shallots in it are really nice. Make and enjoy.

Wow, this was great. We worked all Sunday so we felt like we deserved a treat. The tarragon came from my garden--didn't use it in the potatoes, only in the sauce. 'Found the scallops at Costco. The recipe exceeded our expectations.

Made a version of this the other night that everyone enjoyed more than the original. Sear the scallops in 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil. Deglaze in 1/2 cup white wine (wine only--NO vinegar). Add juices and shallots and reduce to half volume wi med heat. Stir in tarragon and a cup of creme fraiche until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste. Briefly reheat scallops prior to adding sauce and serving.

Rating: 3
Only 3 forks because a non-stick skillet won't properly sear the scallops and I agree with others that the sauce is too sour. I used 1/3 cup lightly oaked Chardonnay and added only enough white-wine and tarragon vinegar to make make 1/2 cup liquid. It's a question of taste, but I want to highlight, not overwhelm, the sweetness of fresh scallops.

Rating: 2
I made this on the spur of the moment, so substituted 2# frozen raw sea scallops and doubled the recipe, searing in 2 batches. I had no white wine vinegar, so subbed rice vinegar & dried tarragon. Appreciate the earlier tip on the sauce - mine broke, and was like melted butter. Also, my family felt the sauce was too sweet, (too reduced? caramelized shallots?) so I was out-voted 4-1 on making this again.

Rating: 3
I am giving this a 3 fork rating for potential more than anything...I agree it is good. The vinegar can be overwhelming but, I always feel like I need to finish it. However, I keep going back to this recipe like a mediocre relationship...You like it but never quite see stars.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, who normally turns up his nose at seafood. We both absolutely loved it! The sauce has a rich, tangy flavor but it was not at all too heavy. This dish was great with a side of asparagus. I wish I'd made some rice or potatoes to make better use of the leftover sauce! Best of all, once you have all the necessary ingredients, it's a snap to make.

Made it for company - fast and delicious. Served it with the butternut squash & leek risotto - double yum. A real winner.

This is actually 3 1/2 forks - very good but not fantastic. It was pretty easy to make. One thing I would change is that I felt the sauce came out too sour - not sure if it was the vinegar or the wine, but I have encountered the problem before with other wine sauces.

So easy and oh sooo good! I made this with a side of wilted mustard greens on top of pollenta with Parmesan cheese. You may consider reducing the amount of butter used in the recipe to cut back on the calories.

This was really really good and very easy. I didn't have a few ingredients so I had to substitute some things. I didn't have white wine so I used marsala wine. I didn't have shallots so I used regular white onions. I didn't have fresh tarragon so I used dried. Come to think of it that's a lot of subs! Anyway, it turned out great and very tasty. I served this over pasta and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again and next time try actually using all the called for ingredients.

I have never made any type of scallop dish before, and this one sounded so good and got such great reviews, I had to try it. All the praise is well-deserved! It is quick, easy, and sooooo yummy! We served it with rice pilaf and french bread--probably should have added a veggie, a salad or spinach would have been perfect. The only thing I would do different is double the sauce, I would have loved to have had even more for dipping and drizzling over the rice. This recipe really is as good as any restaurant scallop dish I have ever had!

First time reviewing anything online, but this is one of the best scallop entrees I've had...from restaurant or home. We're making for the fourth time tonight. Great when having dinner guests because it's so quick and easy and really impresses! I recommend pairing with a risotto, along with salad and crusty bread. Keep the scallops covered with foil to keep them warm...even place in the oven on that foiled plate at a LOW temp if you desire. Scallops are always a treat and I've been searching a long time for the perfect recipe. This is it!

This was an exceptionally easy and great tasting recipe. This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review, but this recipe rated comment. Will definitely make it again. We did not have white wine vinegar, so improvised with 1/2 balsamic vinegar and 1/2 white wine cooking sherry to equal 1/4 cup total. The resulting taste of the sauce was great, even if it was not what the recipe called for.

Best scallop recipe I've made to date! I'm not a huge fan of scallops, but this was fabulous. I read other reviews before preparing, so I guess I had an advantage. I seared the scallops first until almost done (can't use a non-stick pan if you want the 'brown bits') and put in the oven for warming. I did not add the liquid from the scallops to the sauce. Forgot to add the fresh tarragon to finish the sauce (watching Charles Krauthammer commentary on TV), so just sprinkled the scallops/salad with the chopped fresh tarragon, which was perfect. Also, served over baby spinach/spring mix salad (since there was vinegar in the sauce, thought it would work with the salad and it did!). I will experiment in the future with different salad mixes, but this recipe, as is, was wonderful!

Quite good, and easy. TIPS: use a heated plate if you've got an oven warmer. Cover with loose foil to keep warm. Big Tip: use a different plate for serving, as the scallops will lose more juice before you plate them. You don't want that extra juice.

Made this recipe with 1lb large sea scallops. My scallops were dry, but did not brown very well. May consider dusting in flour next time. Cooked scallops on med/high for 5 min total -- but then put them in warming oven 200 degrees while I made the sauce. Probably will do only 2 min per side before putting in warming oven. They were on the verge of over done... Made the sauce with probably 4 -5 Tbl shallots and only used 1/2 the butter as it was only 2 for dinner. We LOOOOOVED this dinner. Highly recommend. The sauce was perfect although mine did tend to separate a bit. I'm guessing I had the heat to high with the boiling of wine/vinegar when I added the 3 Tbl of butter to finish the sauce. Overall -- scrumptious!!!!

Sorry. I'm gonna have to break the streak only give it 3 forks. Why? Cause my scallops are going cold while I make the sauce. Na na na. I dont serve cold scallops. I'll make the sauce first and just before its ready the scallops will go on the fire. Just have to forget about the scallop juice thing. Is the sauce good as written? Of course it is. It's a Beurre blanc sauce. This is the first time I've used tarragon with it. Nice addition.

I made this for the second time last night & it's a winner! The first time, I made it to the tee & the second time I was out of shallots so I subbed in a mix of onion & minced garlic - divine! Super easy & this sauce is just delicious. Highly recommended.

This is an excellent and easy recipe, very similar to another scallop and tarragon recipe on this site. As far as the scallops browning without overcooking, you will have no problem with that as long as they are dry processed scallops. Wet processed scallops will not brown on their own unless they are floured first.

Haven't tried this recipe but know the scallops will not get to 'golden brown' without overcooking. Try lightly flouring them before 'searing' to allow them to turn golden before overcooking. Otherwise it sounds great and I plan to try it when I can get fresh scallops.

It was excellent, especially with the beurre blanc sauce. I usually don't add tarragon to this since I don't like it, but its also tasty with a little grated lemon zest to brighten it up!

Rating: 0
A number of reviewers mentioned "white vinegar." The use of white vinegar vs white wine vinegar may be the reason their sauce was too vinegary. White vinegar is mainly used for pickling. Tarragon vinegar is generally white wine vinegar. The strength of vinegar varies from one producer to another. Keep trying!

Really nice recipe! Easy to make.

Rating: 4
Excellent! The beurre blanc is a classic with scallops-and the addition of fresh tarragon is a wonderful compliment! I used tarragon infused white wine vinegar in place of the white vinegar-but if one finds white vinegar too strong, one has not reduced the sauce fully.

Rating: 3
My family really liked this. I do have to note though that on my first attempt, the sauce separated. So in order to not make the same mistake I did, be sure to lift the pan occasionally to cool the mixture. If it gets too hot, it becomes melted butter with brown chunks. Not pretty.
