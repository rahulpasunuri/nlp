WOW -- so tasty! I didn't have lemon verbena, so subbed chopped lemongrass and a bit of lemon zest. I could eat that whipped cream by the pint!

Lemon verbena can be a bit tricky to find in stores. But it is fairly easy to grow and well worth it for this very fresh, super summery dish. My husband and I look forward to it every year.

I grow lemon verbena in my garden and didn't know how I would use it until I found this recipe. I love this recipe and my guests were happy with it also.

Eh, I think I would have liked the berries just as well if I'd sprinkled them with a little sugar and topped them with some plain cream. And then I could have saved myself scouting for the lemon verbana.
