ok, so this is a stupid question, but are you supposed to cook the lamb before you put it in the tomatoes or not?

We made this as an appetizre for Passover 2008. It was a big hit. Made them about two hours before guests arrived, then reheated for 10 minutes at 350. We look forward to making this again with summer tomatoes. The ones we had in April were pale and blah, but the roasting improved their flavor.

excellent! I used a combination of breadcrumbs and panko instead of matzo meal, and it turned out great. you can also add raisins or currants to add a little sweetness.

This was delicious and my middle-eastern guineau pig said, "I love it!" Only problem was I used heirloom tomatoes, because that's all I had in the 'fridge & was too lazy to go out. Next time I'll use a firmer tomato.

Great ! I made this as a main course entree. I followed the recipe exactly except that instead of stuffing the lamb mixture into tomatoes, I just formed mini burgers and cooked them in a skillet on the stove. I served them inside pita bread with hummus and chopped tomatoes/cucumbers.

I think this recipe and it's presentation are great. I made a few minor adjustments by subtracting the parsley and adding cayene pepper and rosemary because I like more spice.

Fabulous! My middle eastern husband even loved them. I had some left over because of the quantity the recipe makes and gave them to my parents. They loved them. I would definitely make these again and I would also put some of the tomato pulp in with the meat mixture.

Tried to cut down on fat by draining all liquid from the browned lamb. It was too dry. Next time I'll try it as written. This is another time I wish there were half forks. I'd go with two, he votes for three.

Fresh tomatos from the garden make this recipe sing. Followed the recipe except browned the lamb first as others have recommended. Next time may modify herbs, such as using cilantro. Hum...

easy and good with the following substitutions : store was out of matzo meal so used cracker crumbs, no ground lamb avail either, so used 2 lamb sausages and made up the difference w/grnd beef - i think this helped mellow out the flavor but the the was still dominant. I browned the meat and 1/2 the onions a bit first. Depending on your taste it's pretty easy to adjust or change seasonings. I cooked them almost the full time because i wanted the tomatoes to get well roasted. I used leftover filling to make meatballs. Fun Hanukkah item.

You can cut down considerably on cooking time by browning the lamb before adding it to the other stuffing ingredients (which is probably healthier, anyway). Don't worry, it still holds together just fine, due to the egg. This makes it more like 30-40 minutes. I tried to make this from memory, so I ended up with some changes which made me quite happy. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/2 tsp. cumin to the lamb as I browned it, and only put a tiny bit of turmeric and mint in the overall mixture, with the addition of some cracked pepper. I did forget the pine nuts, which I will try to remember next time. Also, I ended up with too much stuffing, so I used the rest in a green bell pepper, which was also quite tasty, and made for a nice variation.

I followed the recipe to the 'T'. The dish wasn't bad, but did have a distinct, lingering taste.

These were good, but came out a little dry, I would cut down on the cooking time, or maybe next time, pack the stuffing in a little looser. I too would add cilantro next time, and in fact, I would add a bit more of each herb than the recipe suggests. I served it with couscous- a very nice meal!

A very good recipe. It took much longer than an hour to cook to desired doneness, however. Great when served with asparagus

This was the most delicious baked stuffed tomato recipe I've ever made. My only regret is that I put it off for Christmas leftovers rather than giving it the spotlight it deserves. A very impressive dish. I chose to grind the leftover lamb rather than dicing. This worked very well.

DICED LEFTOVER LAMB FROM ROASTED LEG. CUT DOWN ON COOKING TIME. WORKED VERY WELL. WILL NEVER WORRY ABOUT LEFTOVER LAMB AGAIN.
