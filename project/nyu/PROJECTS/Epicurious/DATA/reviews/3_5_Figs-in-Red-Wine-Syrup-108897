I have been making this as a dessert every Christmas for a few years. Everyone loves it and requests it again and again!

This smelled amazing as it was cooking on the stove. I let the figs steep in the sauce overnight and then removed them with a slotted spoon. I then reduced the sauce and added more sugar so that the sauce was very syrupy. It was so good - I served it with a cheese platter and little biscuits. The guests raved.

Delicious! I had to use mission figs, which need more than 30 minutes to become tender. Longer cooking time required more liquid, too. I just added water as needed. Serve with gorgonzola dolce and walnuts for a savory dessert.
