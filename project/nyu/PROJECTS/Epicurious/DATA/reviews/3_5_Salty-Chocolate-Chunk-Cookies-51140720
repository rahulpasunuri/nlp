Substituted kosher salt for flaky sea salt.

Holy Yum! These cookies are so good. If you like salted caramels, these are the cookies for you.

Best chocolate chip cookie ever. Look no further. I am a terrible baker, yet these turned out beautiful and delicious. Accidentally used 2 whole eggs and 1 egg white, also a whole bag of Ghiradelli semisweet choco chips. (oops) - topped with applewood smoked sea salt. I don't even like sweets very much but this cookie is addictive and amazing.

Delicious!!! Be careful not to overbake. These should NOT be brown around the edges when you take them out. You may think you are undercooking them, but you're not. Once they cool they will be chewy and delicious and better than any bakery cookie you can find. My first batch was perfect but I left the second batch in too long and they weren't nearly as good.

I love the outer crunch and soft inside. I thought it was too salty. I added more chocolate and chopped cashews. That made a huge difference and they were quite popular.

A few tweaks with my second rendition, and now I'm sold on these cookies. First off, no sprinkling of salt on the top. Make sure to use 7.5 oz. of flour. Chilled the dough. Formed balls of dough and flattened to 2 inch disks. Baked at 325° for 20 minutes. Cookies were beautiful, thin, crispy at edges and a little chew in the middle....this is how my husband digs them. As for me, I kept some cookies in the oven with the door open to let out a good amount of the heat. Then I shut the oven, letting the cookies dwell until completely cool. These cookies were thin, crunchy through and through, and my version of perfection. Cheers all, Jeff

These are "puffy" on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and the Maldon Sea salt is a nice touch. I used dark choc chips instead of chunks, and they were good, but could taste more "buttery." I subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for health and it was fine. This recipe made only 20 average size cookies.

I love dark chocolate and salt so I had to try these. The texture was perfect. I have to say, however, that the salt is not for everybody. Half of my family loved these as is, while the other half loved the cookie but hated the salt.

I was skeptical when these came out of the oven flat, misshapen, and ugly--they looked nothing like the photo. But they are delicious, and have a great chewy texture. I just wouldn't plan on sharing these with anyone else, because they really aren't very good looking. But I will make them again . . . for me!!! BTW, I am a very experienced cook, and I know I didn't do anything wrong. Also, I used 71% and 63% chocolate, and was super happy with those flavors. Pecans would be a great addition, but not necessary.

no forks, was totally unimpressed and none of my regulars liked them either...big disappointment and waste of ingredients

Best cookie I ever made- had to make them twice in 3 days because the boys loved them so much. I added spiced pecans which gave a subtle cinnamon flavor, and used milk chocolate. Fabulous!

I don't love 'sicky sweet' cookies, so when I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it. My family (and I) thought they were excellent! My 17 and 15yr old teenage boys literally 'cleaned the plate'. Passed some on to a neighbor, who promptly opened her Bon Appetit and made them later the same week. Wish they were a bit thicker, but for flavor, they can't be beat! Am making them for the teacher appreciation luncheon next week - I'm sure I'll hear rave reviews. Thanks Bon Appetit!

These cookies are excellent - slightly crunchy on the edges and moist and chewy in the middle. The sea salt gives them such a great pop of flavor! When sprinkling the sea salt on the dough before baking a lot of it fell off so I added a little to the cookies when they came out of the oven and were still soft. I used a mixture of milk and bittersweet chocolates which worked wonderfully. I will definitley be making these again.

I loved this cookie. I double the recipe to make tons for home and work. I used 72% cacao bars and 50% cacao. the cookies came out chewy and just all around delicious. I could not find maldon salt but i found a flake sea salt from whole foods that i mashed up a bit before sprinkling.

I have been baking for almost 50 years now & this is absolutely the best cookie I have ever made. Used Valrhona chocolate 61%, added 1&1/2 t. espresso powder and pecans. Had to make it twice in a week because they were gone in 2 days. I am a huge Maldon salt fan anyway, but had never used it baking. Wonderful!!!

I made this twice within one week and everyone loved them...kids, and adults who claim to not like sweets. The salt is surprising & cuts the sweet factor you have in Toll House cookies. I used 4 oz. milk chocolate and 4 oz. dark (Ghiradelli) and would use a mixture of chocolates again. I think all milk chocolate would be really flat in flavor.

Why do I believe that there's always going to be a better chocolate chip cookie than Toll House? Because there's always the elusive "best" brownie? Maybe but with chocolate chip cookies, not so much. The changes in this recipe give a crispy, crunchy, slightly salty cookie. Are they worth changing from the classic? Not sure but an interesting change.

Not what I expected. Too sweet and meringue like. Mine did not come out as dark as the photo. Adding some walnuts helped to cut the sweetness.
