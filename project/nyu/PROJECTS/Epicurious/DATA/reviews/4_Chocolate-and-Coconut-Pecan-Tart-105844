You MUST heat a slice of this in the microwave. I seriously thought this was just ho-hum until I heated it for 10 seconds and it easily takes this from 2 to 4 stars. The "cocoa powder" part of the recipe is an error...it's duplicate information. The crust was way too mealy to call dough. I had to add extra butter and a couple tablespoons of water to have it stick together. I will make this again...but I will make sure it's heated next time!

What is the purpose of the "Cocoa Powder"? I don't see how it is used. Perplexed.

Excellent although I did not make the chocolate crust and used a store bought. Thought the chocolate crust would be a little too much-loved it and it was easy.

This is delicious... make it every year for Thanksgiving. But, every time I make it, the filling leaks out of the bottom of the tart pan, onto the bottom of the oven. It still turns out fine, it's just a hassle when I'm busy and forget to line the pan!

We are eating this now, hot out of the pan. Its very very good. Better than we thought. We used 3/4 cup Lehua honey with a couple tablespoons molasses instead of corn syrup, and we used fresh shredded coconut from a nut on our tree instead of dried. The crust was not dry at all - it was perfect. Might not be any left before it cools.

I make this tart without the crust and with almonds instead of pecans! Like the other reviewer said, it tastes like an almond joy bar!

This pie tart is very good. Nice change to the classic pecan pie. I did make the chocolate crust. One suggestion that worked for me was to work the crust in the end with my hands. This allowed the butter to mix well with the coco powder. The pastry cutter didn't fuse the butter into the coco powder as well. My crew liked this a lot.

This recipe is incredibly good! I made my own pie crust and put the filling in a 9" deep dish pie pan. It was the perfect amount of filling, producing a nice 1" thick pie. No need to prebake the crust, and cooked it at 375 for 35-40 mins. I did cut the corn syrup to 3/4 c. and did not toast the pecans. I also used dark brown sugar, because I just prefer it. I know you`ll love it!

Fabulous, easy dessert. I used a prepared pie crust and must not have rolled it out thin enough because all of my filling would not fit. I will likely make this tart many times during this holiday season

I brought this for Thanksgiving but made some modifications. I made it in a pie pan. There is too much filling, so need to cut to 3/4 of the filling. I used regular sized chocolate chips that I chopped small. I actually think this works well, because you get bits of chocolate sprinked througout the filling and it cuts the sweetness.

I love this tart and make it for my friends birthday every year. I do not cook the tart for the full 40 minutes though, because I have a convection oven. Also, I use toasted almonds instead of pecans and it tastes like an almond joy!

THIS TART GOT RAVE REVIEWS FROM FAMILY & FRIENDS ! I USED READY-MADE GRAHAM CRACKER TART SHELLS-THE SMALL SIZE WORKED BETTER THAN THE LARGE 9" SIZE.ALSO, I PUT ALL THE COCONUT INSIDE AND SKIPPED THE CHOC GLAZING AT THE TOP TO MAKE IT EASIER. BUT EVERYONE LOVED THEM !SHALL DEFINITELY MAKE THEM AGAIN!

Caveat: I didn't make the crust. But the filling was unreal -- I used one third hazelnuts, two thirds pecans, and it was amazing, and unbelievably easy. My guests thought I'd bought the pie at Whole Foods.

I have renamed this tart "Magic Pie". It takes just like a magic bar in pie form. It was incredibly easy to make. I made it even easier by using a pre-made graham cracker crust. Very yummy and got rave reviews.

I got rave reviews on this tart. For the holidays I have always made a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut, but misplaced the recipe and it is not on Epicurious (it was a Bon Appetit recipe from years ago) so I was on a mission to find something similar. This is actual tastier and looks more impressive than pie (for some reason the tart shell gives the illusion of a more difficult dessert) I used the suggestion for adding 2 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp water to the crust and it worked great. I also decreased the corn syrup to 3/4 cup and used regular sweetened coconut.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I also followed another review's suggestion to forgo the chocolate crust (which sounded a little troublesome) and just used a plain pre-made crust. It was delicious. Next time, I might try making it in a square tart pan and cut up into small squares.

With other reviewers suggestions, this tart was fabulous. I, too, added 2 T of butter and 1 T of water to the crust, and it turned out perfect. Delicious treat that is very sweet and has a nice soft filling. I also melted the chocolate chips in a bag and piped them on the border, as another reviewer suggested, and that looked really nice.

In answer to the question from 11/22/04: the recipe is just printed weird. It is just a crust and the filling. The second ingredient is unsweetened cocoa powder and the rest of the crust ingredients follow. It is excellent! I hope you try it.

would love to make this but what is the rest of the crust recipe?

This tart has the right combination of sweet and chocolate. I used a rectangle tart pan and cut the recipe in half. It is great!

I would make this tart again if I fooled a little with the crust. It was so dry and I had such trouble pressing into the pan - even after adding an extra egg yolk - that I thought for sure there was a mistake in the recipe. When everyone ate it they literally had to pick up the edge of the crust with their hand and eat it like a cookie - forget using a fork!

This tart is delicious and easy to make It has just the right amount of chocolate.I reserved some of the pecans and made a nice design on the top. I made it for my husband's office party ( and for 2 of my own parties)and it got rave reviews. I served it with freshly whipped cream on the side. Yum!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was really a hit! There were nine different desserts on the table and mine was gone completely before there was even a dent in the others. A lot of the women there asked me for a copy of the recipe. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

The pie was fabulous! A big hit with everyone for Thanksgiving. Next time I would add some water/butter to the crust as well--it was a little dry.

Rating: 3
This is delish! Took the advice of the many and added a few tablespoons of water to the crust. Made the mistake of adding an entire 1 cup of choc chips to the filling but it worked out so well I did the same thing on the second tart and eliminated melting chocolate on the top and just sprinkled on the coconut. I also used a square tart pan so that I could cut it into smaller pieces because this is rich!

The filling for this dessert rates four forks, but I'm deducting points for the crust - dry, as most here noted, but it also made the tart difficult to remove from the pan and to slice neatly. I'd prefer this next time with a paté brisee crust, as there's already so much chocolate elsewhere in the recipe. I also made this change - substituted 1/2 cup maple syrup for 1/2 of the corn syrup. The unsweetened coconut is readily available, and inexpensive, at any health-foods store. And the tiny chocolate chips are essential for the final melt on top.. This chocolate border also made it difficult to serve neatly, so next time, I'd do a drizzle instead. On the whole, quite delicious, moist, sweet, and satisfying. A little piece goes a long way. Like a candy bar!

I am making this right at the moment! Have made this tart 4x since last Thanksgiving and it's always a big hit. I add another 2 Tbsp. of butter and 1 Tbsp. of water to the crust. I also use sweetened coconut as it is usually on hand. Can't wait until Thursday to enjoy it....

I will be trying this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving. I'll let you know how I like it after I've tried it. The reason for this review, prior to making the tart, is to let you know that in the recipe you've left out the ingredient that is "6 tablespoons unsweetened ?????" in the Crust portion of the recipe. I'm going to assume it's cocoa but you might want to update this recipe. Thanks

Made this for company and was a big hit. Used 2/3 cup of sugar by accident(wasn't using the old reading glasses) and was sweet enough. Added water to crust as othes advised. Will be making this again for Thanksgiving.

How could this fail with chocolate, coconut and pecans! Everyone loved it. This is like a gourmet version of "magic 7" bars.

I, too, made this tart for Thanksgiving. It was outstanding, and it also kept very well. Still tasted great 4 days later. I followed the directions for decorating the top and it was as beautiful as it was delicious. Will definitely make again and again.

This was delicious and different. I used almonds because I like them better than pecans, and they worked well. It is not too sweet (the crust) and keeps well. My crust was dry, too, so I added a little cold water and that was a perfectly fine remedy for me. I also think I let brown a little too long, so next time I would set the timer for a little less initially.

This tart did have a beautiful presentation. I had problems, however, with the crust being incredibly dry. I did not know what to do, so I added another egg yolk - it was still dry, but I did get it in the pan. I did not have an 11-inch tart pan, and I also think that it would have been better if it had been in one. The flavor was delicious, so if I had the bigger pan, and could solve the dry crust problem, I would definitely make it again.

This is really tasty. I agree that it would be good in a square or rectangular tart pan as the rich texture is a little like a turtle brownie...I might try white chocolate chips next time since my mom just made the white chocolate pecan pie tart and white chocolate and pecan are so lovely together!!

This went over big! I might also decrease the corn syrup a bit. But I want to encourage everyone to make the decorative border...I wasn't going to do it, but it turned out to be incredibly easy and really made the tart look amazing.

This got a 4 Star review from everyone. I did not have a dryness problem with the crust but I do think making it in a rectangular tart pan would enable cutting it into small pieces--it is so rich. I accidentally tossed in 1/2 cup of chips into filling but it was OK.The chocoholics loved it. It was very dense and chocolatey Could not find unsweetened coconut either.I plan to bring it to a Christmas party for the dessert table. It tastes even more scrumptious if you make it several days ahead and refrigerate. It ages well!

This was a great variation of the traditional pecan pie. I had trouble with the dough being too dry for the crust, so I added a tablespoon of water. With a little work, I got it in the pan. I had to substitute sweetened coconut as I could not find unsweetened. If I make this substitution again, I would slightly decrease the amount of corn syrup. Definitely worth making again.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and would make it again and again. A total winner!! The coconut and chocolate reminded me of the taste of an almond joy candy bar(but pecan, of course).The chocolate chips kept their shape, we liked the texture of that. I didn't have an 11in tart pan so I used a 9 1/2, just added less crust & filling mixtures. Worked out great! I thought the crust was a little dry to go in the pan, but stuck with it and it was fine. Very easy to make. Great to take to any party of the season!

i agree--there DOES seem to be too much crust for the tart pan. but i guess that's better than having too little, which is my usual problem. :o) the filling is delicious and the tart is MUCH easier to make than it looks. the coconut and chocolate border makes the overall presentation so much more impressive than it would otherwise be!

The filling for this tart was delicious! The crust was not as good as expected. I cooked it for 15 min as suggested but next time I will check it at 10-12 min. It also seemed like there was too much crust for the 11 inch pan. The crust was very hard and did not complimebt the tart.

Delicious! Chocolate makes great variation on traditional pecan pie without being overwhelming. Needed to bake filling 10 minutes more than recipe called for and probably could have used 1 or 2 more minutes.

Yes! Yes! Yes! Excellent Choice! I Love Chocolate if you did not notice! This was so easy to make, the coconut was a perfect addition to 2 already great ingrediants, I agree with other rating, needed more moisture, I opted for more butter (of Course :) This went a long way too, I had plenty and then some!

This was such an amazing dessert. So easy to make and very impressive when finished. I did have an add two tablespoons of water to crust as it was somewhat dry.
