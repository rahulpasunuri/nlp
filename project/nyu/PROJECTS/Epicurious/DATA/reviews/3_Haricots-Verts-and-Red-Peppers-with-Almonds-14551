Don't even think about toasting the almonds for 10 or 15 minutes. It'll take no more than 4 or 5 minutes at 350. Green beans will cook crisp tender -- not in 6 minutes as the recipe instructs -- but 3 or 4 minutes. Otherwise, great recipe.

Made this following the advice of Bobbyjo. Works for us. A lovely colorful dish.

The family loved this as an alternative to the usual green bean recipes we have for Thanksgiving. The colors looked festive on the table, like a precursor to the Christmas season. We used fresh green beans from Mom's organic garden and skipped the oil. Judging by the family's comments, we'll have this again next year (and a few times inbetween, I'm sure).

I love this dish! It's so simple and quick and always sure to please. Try using a bit of flavored olive oil--rosemary or basil work nicely--with the regular olive oil in the recipe. It gives it a very flavorful and yet subtle varition.

Just two of us so I adapted this like this: trimmed the haricot verts and cooked in boiling salted water for three minutes. Drained and cold rinsed and put in serving bowl. Dry toasted about a Tbsp of frozen sliced almonds in a saute pan until fragrant and added to beans. Sauted thin sliced red pepper strips in about a Tbsp of olive oil for about 5-7 minutes, added back the beans and almonds, stirred and salt and peppered. Can be served hot, cold, room temp. Delicious and easy.

This is really a 2 1/2 fork rating. It is a simple and easy vegetable dish but nothing special. The toasted almonds add a nice touch. I made this for company and meat entree was the main focus so this vegetable worked out just fine.

My married daughter always asks my husband to bring this to any dinner occasion she has. Our whole family loves it.
