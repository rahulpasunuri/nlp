This was the second time I made this. Unlike last time, this time I made the crumb mixture ahead, and brought the lamb out to room temp before cooking. At 400 degrees, the racks were Perfectly cooked after 25 minutes. My guests were gushing over this! Will make it again and again.

Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was amazing - served it with White Truffle mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus, and it was a hit! will definitely fix again.

Very good, but use only 2 TB balsamic; per other reviewers, seared first then put in oven for about 15-20 minutes. Make sure you have the lamb at room temperature. I cut my rack into twin chops. I did spray topping with Pam, and it still started to burn so I lowered the heat for the last 5 min. Served with roasted brussel sprouts, mashed sweet potato and a little bit of sauteed spinach and mushrooms I needed to get rid of. Very tasy.

One of my quick favorites. My husband loves this with a wild mushroom risotto. When I dont know what to have, this one is fast, easy, and I never have to go shop. I gave this recipe to my daughter. She is a vegetarian, but likes to cook for friends. She is always nervous about not tasting for spices, but they all loved it. Great recipe for new cooks.

An excellent Easter dish. I combined shallots and leeks. This is easy to make and takes very little time.

Exceptional and easy! I didn't have shallots, and so I substituted them with finely chopped onion (1/2 cup). I also made a quick gravy with A1, brown sugar, dijon and ground pepper. I highly recommend!

Delicious and very easy. I will cut back a bit on the balsamic next time, but this is a keeper!

I made this earlier this week for the second time, this time for my boyfriend's birthday. I think this recipe is exceptional - it's so simple to prepare, and is delicious. This is actually the only lamb preparation I have found that I like, which is saying something. Both times I followed another reviewer's suggestion and seared the meat in olive oil first, then after it cooled a bit rubbed the mustard and crumb mixture on, then roasted for about 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven. Meat was around 135 when I took it out, let it rest for about 10 minutes and it was cooked perfectly. Would make this for any special occasion.

Excellent. I lowered the oven temp to 350 and roasted it for 40 minutes because it looked like the crust was going to burn.

I receive rave reviews everytime I prepare this dish. Instead of the gruyere potato gratin, try the Potato Gratin with Goat Cheese and Garlic, and some steamed asaparagus drizzled with a little olive oil and lemon on the side. Fabulous recipe. One of my favorites for dinner parties.

My wife insists that I make this for company. I didn't think it was all that exceptional but I have been known to err. It definatly needs to be cooked longer than the instructions. I cooked the recomended aqoutermants and my wife loved them too. She insists that I do this again. Halv the liqued in the potato's, double the cheese, double the cooking time for the lamb and the potato's and enjoy.

Made this for a couple of girlfriends last night. They loved it, and so did I! My butcher wraps the rack in lamb fat to keep it moist, so I trimmed it slightly and scored the fat, then pan-seared it before proceeding with the recipe using rosemary instead of thyme and a bit less balsamic (my butcher gives me free rosemary with my lamb!). Very tasty and moist, tho it took a bit longer to cook. I served mine with roasted tomatoes, braised peas and buttered charlotte potatoes. A yummy treat for a Tuesday.

Very good. It does need some type of sauce or gravy

I tried this tonight and it was wonderdful. I used white balsamic vinegar and cooked the lamb as the package said 425' for about 20 minutes. I normally don't buy rack of lamb because of the cost but like some others I caught a sale.

Rating: 4
This is an easy and elegant way to make lamb. It always impresses and might even push someone who isn't sure about lamb, to like it. My husband begs me to make it. Don't need the recipe anymore. TIP: To save on mess, I throw the racks, nicely oiled and salted and peppered on a hot grill to get the searing and browning. Then no mess on the stove and into the oven they go! Have even made them on the grill all the way, but that is a bit tricky with the crust and the bones tend to burn.

Rating: 4
Not only would I make this again, my husband insists that I do! Perfect for a romantic dinner, but make sure you use the "Frenched" chops! He'll love you for it!!!!!!!!

Rating: 3
Easy. I recommend adding a bit more liquid (not balsamic, though) to the crust mixture for added adherence. Spray pam on the crust before cooking too; otherwise I can see how easy it would be for the crust to fall off while trying to cut. The amount of mustard is good. I would tone down on the Balsamic.

If you can't think of what to do with your lamb chops--go with this! Never fails to add all the right accents to a delicious cut of meat. Recipe is both delicious and idiot proof.

Rating: 4
Looks very elegant. I got overwhelming "wows" at my table and yet it is so easy to prepare. I seasoned the lamb with a little bit of salt pepper and garlic powder and let it sit for a few hours before applying the crust and baking. I also sprayed the crust with Pam. I made 2 racks at a time and had to increase cooking time to at least 40 minutes for medium rare. Definitley a great special occasin recipe

Rating: 3
An interesting recipe. It was tasty, but the "crust" did almost completely fall off, leaving the presentation something to be desired. Lamb has such great flavor on it's own, I prefer a little more subtle flavoring, S&P, dijon and a little garlic & herb of choice works wonders on a great rack.

Rating: 4
TO ALL: Read this carefully if you want to make this: This recipe has promise. Following a stellar 2002 season in the Pacific League, during which Rack of Lamb with Caramelized Shallot and Thyme Crust hit a solid .279 with 26 homers and 76 rbi, look for a bounceback year next year after shin splints cut this season to a month and a half. Still, the slick-fielding Rack with a cannon arm managed to improve his running game with 9 stolen bases on top of 7 dingers. I give Rack an 8.2.

Please allow for a dissenting opinion. While the lamb was okay - it IS rack of lamb... - I, too, felt that something was amiss. First, I must agree with the Cook from Hyannis MA, the crust wasn't a crust. I had the same problems. My biggest gripe, however, is with the taste. The flavor of the lamb was completely overwhelmed by the crust. Perhaps it was my vinegar, but that's just about all I could taste. If I were ever to make this again, and I probably won't, since there are far better lamb recipes on this site, I'd used one half to one third of the crust recipe.

Rating: 4
An absolutely wonderful dish. We had it for Christmas dinner and paired it with baked yam and Brussel Sprouts with a Walnut Vinaigrette. The teaspoon of Dijon held the crust on the rack and gave it just the right amount of acidity to balance the sweetness of the lamb and the tartness of the shallots.

Rating: 4
I prepared 3 racks last evening for a Christmas Eve dinner for 7 adults who have been sharing Christmas Eve for 30+ years. It was absolutely successful! The crumb, thyme, balsamic crust whick I applied about 2 hours before roasting, was very tasty. The flavors delicately flavored the meat--presumably more effectively than had it been applied just before putting in the oven. Served it with a potato garlic gratin. It was a lovely pairing!

Rating: 2
Would give this 2 1/2 forks if I could. Something was not quite right, although it was tasty. The crust wasn't quite a crust, more like a crumble that didn't stay on during slicing. This is good but needs some tweaking. Maybe the searing would have enhanced it...A good lamb, but not what I was expecting

I made this for the first time last Christmas. It was a great success and since then it has been requested for several special occasions. We've also prepared it using indirect heat on a Weber charcoal cooker and found it equally delicious.

Well, I have pretty much stopped ordering lamb from restaurants because the 3 recipes that I have used on this website, are in my opinion,beyond compare!!!This was luscious and easy!! I also served the potatoes recommended. Had to use up some asparagus so I didn't try the spinach. Loved it all!

Excellent! The lamb was extremely tender, the crust very tasty. My family couldn't get enough, even my six-year old.

I changed none of the ingredients, only the technique. After preparing the shallot-vinegar mixture in a skillet, i transferred it to a bowl with the crumb mixture. Wiped the skillet clean, added 1tbs oil, seared the seasoned lamb rack over med-high heat to get a nice brown crust, about 5 minutes. Moved rack to board, applied mustard and crumb mixture, placed back in skillet and roasted in 400 oven for about 18 minutes for med-rare. Worked beautifully and gave the meat a nice taste under the crust.

I found this sensational! It is perfect for an after work dinner for family or for a dinner party. I made one rack of lamb and ended up eating it all myself! I was a little afraid of how the flavour was going to turn out when I was tasting the shallot mixture, but added some seasoning to it which took away a bit of the vinegar flavour. I especially liked the way the lamb stays moist and tender under the crust.

Really fabulous! This cut of lamb is so expensive, I've never had a chance to work with it before. After finding several racks on sale, I was searching for a simple recipe. This is just perfect. The lamb turns out perfectly moist and succulent. Prep time is minimal, so it's great for a quick meal or an impressive dinner party main course.

Made it this evening and it was delicious. Simple yet full of flavour, it really let the lamb shine through. I get my lamb at discount as well, from Costco, so much cheaper and I prefer NZ or Aussie lamb to US (more lamby tasting IMHO). This recipe is perfect for just throwing together because all the ingredients are usually already on hand.

A friend gave me a Gourmet's Quick Kitchen cookbook in which this recipe is included. I've made it several times - just for my husband and myself as well as for company. It looks so elegant and tastes so superb that it's hard to believe how easy it is to prepare. When serving it to guests, I prepare the racks in advance and just bring to room temp before roasting. Doesn't diminish the flavor at all. (Like a previous reviewer, I find my lamb at a discount -his at Costco, mine at Sam's Club).

Made this for Valentines Day also and I was told this was the best Rack of Lamb he had ever had and he orders it out a lot! Great crust that does not need a sauce. Made it with the Goat Cheese Potato Gratin and served a wonderful red wine.

As someone who is not a lamb lover, I can say I have been converted. My husband loves lamb and for Valentine's Day I decided on this recipe for his sake. I usually need lots of garlic to make it palatable for me, but the shallots and vinegar did the trick. It was quick, easy and the meat just melted in the mouth. I cooked it for 30 minutes and found it to be the perfect amount of time. If I could afford the cut, I'd make this every week! We had it with sauteed watercress with garlic and lemon and pasta with garlic and oil. Excellent.

Rating: 3
The crust was absolutely delicious !! Could have used about 10 more minutes cooking time for the rack. We found that simpler side dishes were in order as to not outdo the flavor of the lamb; we tried Israeli couscous and steamed green beans. I'm already planning my next dinner party with this recipe in mind.

This dish was a hit when we made it for four people the other night. The 25-30 minutes prescribed as the cooking time is about right, though. I thought it needed a bit more time and it was slightly overcooked. For rack of lamb lovers, this dish is easy to make and highly recommended.

My husband thought it was better than any he has had prepared in fine restaurants. Unique blend of flavors. It took longer to cook than called for in the recipe.

I prepared the shallots, thyme, and vinegar portion in advance. Reheated it and followed the rest of the directions. This worked out perfectly. The lamb was flavorful with the combination of balsamic vinegar and shallots. Instead of the suggested potatoes I made the Red Potatoes with Olives, Feta and Mint and sauteed spinach with a touch of garlic. This worked well.

My family enjoyed this very much. Even my daughter who is very picky about what she will eat. The lamb was moist and the coating added a spicy flavor to the lamb. Would use 1/2 the bread crumbs next time as well.

Here is a simple interesting twist to this remarkably good recipe. We eat a lot of lamb and have tried numerous recipes. See the Morrocan style lamb chops if you want to see a poor one. The modification is to remove the meat from the rack. My wife and I shared ours, but the next time I make it, I want a whole rack for myself. But if you want to share simply cut the rack in half by cutting between the ribs. Then place fat side down and cut with your knife along the ribs until you remove the fleshy part from the ribs. You will get most all of the premium meat off the ribs. Carefully cut the fat and "silver" from the meaty eye and you have a great cut to use for the rest of the recipe. Be sure to use a thermometer to check internal teperature at about 15 minutes or so and stop about 10 degrees before your desired donenesstemperature (145) for medium rare. In the case of medium rare 135 was a perfect stop point as it continue to cook a bit after you remove it. This recipe was a match of lamb and flavors that was out of this world. We now buy 2-3 racks each time we go to Costco. Good eats and not too expensive and without all that pesky bone.

We thought this was a great meal for the amount of prep. We followed hints of the other reviewers e.g. -1/2 breadcrumbs on the rack. Even the spinach was yummy but next time we'll add a little lemon and some add'l ginger. Serve this with a 1998 Ravenswood Vintner's Blend Merlot and you might even get lucky!

There was no rack of lamb to be had in our town, so I ended up getting a pork loin roast. I followed the recipe as written, but used the pork instead. My Christmas guests said that it was the best pork roast that they'd ever had! They're still talking about it!

Loved it. The crust has an exquisite taste. My company raved. We used the absolutely best quality lamb - Australian. Expensive but well worth it. Can't wait to make this again. We cooked it for 40 minutes at 400 degrees in a well pre-heated oven.

This was wonderful, and we will have it again. The cooking time or temperature seemed off-- it took a good bit longer than 30 minutes @400. It seems that a 425 or 450 degree oven for the semae amount of time would be more consistent w/ other reipces for rack of lamb.

Wonderful! See review for Gruyere Potato Gratin.

I screwed up the shallots, by reducing at too high a heat after adding the vinegar. As a result we had to scrape off the crust, but I'll try it again, it was my mistake -- the mustard rub and herbs made a flavorful rack of lamb and everyone loved the gruyere potato gratin and spinach. The recipe would easily serve three, not two.
