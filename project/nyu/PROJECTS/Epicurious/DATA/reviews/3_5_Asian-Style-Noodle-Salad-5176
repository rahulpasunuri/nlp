I did not care for this salad at all. The grated carrots all mushed together and the dressing just didn't taste good.

Made this using soba noodles instead of spaghetti, and increased the amount of pepper and carrot since I couldn't get jicama. It was really tasty, but definitely benefited from the addition of a tablespoon or so of liquid aminos (soy or tamari would have the same effect). Will make again.

This dish is as beautiful as it is delicious. The perfect addition to a summer buffet table. I made the recipe as-is and it was delicious. I make my own teriyaki sauce, so I can adjust the sweetness to my liking. The jicama gives it a nice crunch, I have never tried jicama before, so don't leave it out just because you are unfamiliar with it. Yum!

This is an excellent tasting salad, unique and very attractive. I will make it many times and wouldn't change a thing.

We've made this recipe for nine years and we still enjoy it. Easy to make, a good side-dish for teriyaki shrimp or chicken.

This was amazing and easy! I added a big handful of chopped cilantro, and a little extra salt to the dressing. I forgot to slice the spinach leaves and tossed them in whole, and it was fine. It was equally delicious the next day, as the flavors blended. The jicama is an inspired addition - great texture. And my kids loved it!

This has become a family staple. The recipe is simple and quick, and it has a good balance of flavors that appeal to an adult pallate. My two year old and five year old boys also love it, which makes it a rare crowd pleaser.

Very good recipe. I agree, you could put a number of different vegetables in this salad. We omitted the bell pepper. This went really well with a satay recipe I made.

I loved this recipe although I changed the salad ingredients significantly. I used a mixture of julienned veggies that I found pre-cut at the grocery store (I believe it was primarily brocolli, carrots, and cabbage - almost a slaw mix.) I thought the dressing was excellent, though and it was perfect for a light dinner on a summer evening.

Actually maybe more of a 2.5 fork rating. Light, refreshing, tasty. I changed it by adding rice stick noodles instead of spaghetti--fits much better with the other flavours anyway, and I used a garlic-flavoured teriyaki sauce.

This dish is excellent - especially made a few days in advance. I usually play around with recipes a bit, so I added crushed red pepper and it was delicious. I received many compliments and requests for the recipe as well. The colors of the carrot and spinach add eye appeal to this salad. Good on a buffet table. Don't forget to break the pasta in half before cooking!

Sorry folks..I rated the wrong recipe..please disregard my review below. I made the Spicy Sesame Noodle and Green Bean Salad from July 98 and it was outstanding. This salad sounds kind of nasty...the type I'd stay away from!!! Sorry:(

I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this recipe. I think the concept of this recipe is good, but the dressing had a poor balance of flavors. It was way overly sweet in my opinion. A different Asian dressing would help.

This is a bit unusual for my normal cooking. The sesame oil on the cold pasta was enough flavoring. I made the dressing, but all of my 8 guests passed on it saying it didn't need it. Surprisingly, the leftovers were still tasty and acceptable after one week. I used a ten dollar plastic mandolin device to shred the carrots and jicama. they were perfect. I served this one night with grilled salmon, and grilled mahi-mahi the other night. Fresh grilled pineapple spears finished it off. Desert was mango sorbet with coconut macaroons. Chardonnay was just right with this dish. I've made this to take to a luncheon at work tommorow and i'm sure everyone will love it. I did toast some almond slivers which I added just before serving. The cruncy contrasting texture was very good.

The dressing for this recipie is absolutely wonderful. It coats the salad very easily so you don't have to use very much and it is very light and subtle. I served it at a dinner party and it was a great hit! I did choose to omit the noodles, however and I think the salad was better for it.
