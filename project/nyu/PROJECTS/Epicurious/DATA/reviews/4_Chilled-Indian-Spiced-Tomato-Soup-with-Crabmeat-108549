Wow! This soup was fantastic. Had a nice bite, but don't think I'd serve this in summer as it could be too over-powering. Served it hot and was wonderful for a winter dinner!

Served it hot due to other reviews and time of year. Crabmeat really enhanced it. Also, did not puree to give this soup a hearty rustic appearance. Boyfriend loved it!

Awesome for the adventerous. Used all fresh veggies and as written. Served warm, not chilled. Loved it--makes alot.

This was good, but not great for me. Hubby liked it much better. I did not serve with the crab, because of overfishing, our seafood consumption is very low. To speed up the chopping, I just swirled each thing individually in the food processor until it was coarsely chopped- much faster. Makes a lot, which is good! Flavors are nice, to me, it just is not exactly the ultimate recipe, as others on the site are.

Delish when served hot too!! I cut the recipe in half and substituted about 1/2 tbsp of curry powder for the fennel bulb and mustard seeds ( I had to make do with what's in my pantry!). It worked really well! I personally like a bit of chunk in my soup, so I just did a quick couple of pulses in the blender, and voila! This soup makes me happy!!!

I made this the day before for a dinner party last night. It was wonderful. I served it in chilled bowls, and garnished each serving with a dollop of whipped cream,flavored with a teaspoon of sweet vermouth and topped with crabmeat. The flavors are so complex, yet none overpower any other. I used a food mill to strain it. Then chilled it for 24 hours. I will definately make this again.

It was a lot of chopping but if you blend it later you can use coarser vegetables. I had so many vegetables I needed to use quickly, I'm so glad to have found a recipe that used them all in such an interesting fashion.

This was delicious! I used chicken stock because I didn't have vegetable. I don't have a spice grinder so I just put the spices in whole. I also did not strain it, just put it all in the blender and thought the consistency was fine. So healthy!

Made this recipe exactly as indicated. Used Swanson's veggie broth from a can. It was awesome. A great way to use my surplus of summer produce.

I made this without any of the fennel, and I added curry (about 1 and 1/2 Tbls)my dish was served warm and after it was put through the blender there seemed to be no reason to strain it. Crab was pilled on and it was served and everyone raved about this soup. This is a home run!

Half of my guests enjoyed this dish in its entirity and the other half thought otherwise. If I made this again I would half the soup and 1.5 the crab and still serve 8. Once the crab was gone the soup seemed uninteresting. Perhaps it would be good as an appetizer instead of a first course with just enough soup over the crab to serve as a sauce. It is doubtful however that I will want to spend that many hours preparing an appetizer.

Absolutly fab - Got RAVE reviews from my dinner guests as a first course. It's good for mixed groups of vegetarian and non (just left out the crab for the veges). I used canned whole plum tomatoes and canned crab from Trader Joes. it does take alot of chopping, but is well worth the effort. I will be making this again soon.

This was delicious. Used chicken stock and added a dollop of plain yogurt at the table since we had it. I agree that canned diced tomatoes would be just as good especially in off season.

Very tasty, but my goodness, what a lot of chopping! I used very ripe roma tomatoes from my garden. Next time, tho, to save time, I'll try this recipe with Muir Glen's diced tomatoes (they're quite good). I'll definately make this recipe again.

Deeeelish! Very very yummy. A fair amount of work, but tasty and definitely different.

This soup is absolutely delicious! I didn't use the crabmeat but I'm sure that only makes it better--if that's possible. I pureed it then put it through a strainer.
