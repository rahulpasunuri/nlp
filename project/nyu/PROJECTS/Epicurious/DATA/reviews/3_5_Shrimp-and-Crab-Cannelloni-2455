I disagree w/A Cook from HBcook on 12/09/10. We loved the recipe. I did however, omit the extra onion (by oversight) and maybe that made all the difference. The 12oz of shrimp and 6oz of crab was just right -- it blended perfectly w/the cheese ingredients and the pureed sauce. If I were to add anything, the next time I'll add fresh spinach -- maybe! NOTE: I boiled my shrimp, then cooked my lasagna noodles (al dente) in the shrimp water earlier in the day. I chilled both shrimp and noodles in seperate ice baths. I laid noodles on cookie sheet, sprayed w/olive oil to keep from sticking. When prep time rolled around, the ingredients were easily handled since they were cool to the touch.

OMG this was the worst recipe I have made on this website! I don't know how it got all the good reviews. Maybe from all the cooks that bought the sauce. The sauce was so overwhelmingly onion-flavored I could taste them in my sleep. 1 3/4 cup of onions in the sauce and 1 1/4 cup in the filling!! I should have known. I am a very experienced cook and I thought the sauce had a very bitter flavor. Also, very expensive to make. I used 1# shrimp that I shelled and deveined and 8 ounces of crab ($15.99), not to mention the quality provolone and parmesan. At the very least this dish needed lots of cheese sprinkled over the top before baking and it needed more time in the oven. Anyway, the result - you'd never know there was seafood in the recipes.

Very simple and easy, yet very tasty. A suggestion would be to cut the lasagna noodles in half to make smaller, thinner rolls. Using a full length noodle made the pasta component of the cannelloni far too thick and dense.

This was a great dish and not difficult to put together if you have a little time. I wouldn't do this as a wknight meal. I started Sat. morning, and had a very relaxed dinner party that evening. I used eggroll wrappers raw (they cook in the sauce), so easy and better in my opinion than thick lasagna noodles.

This is a perfect make - ahead dish for entertaining. It took me almost 4 hours to make from start to finish but was well worth it. Using fresh thyme and basil gave a depth to the sauce that I don't think I would have gotten with dried herbs. I added extra crab and shrimp and under-cooked the shrimp after reading other reviews and it worked out well. Highly reccomended.

I had some extra shrimp and crab lying about, so I tried this recipe and it turned out wonderful. I enjoyed all the different flavors and especially the spicyness from the crushed red pepper. I made this for my husband who is a chef from southern Italy and he said it was Beautiful! Not too saucy and very delicious. Set aside some time to prepare. Buon Appetito!

My entire family loved this dish. The only thing I changed was to use a second can of Muir Glen tomatoes in place of the fresh. While this may not be a quick meal to put together, it is not as bad as other reviews have made it seem. If you know your way around the kitchen, its a very reasonable dish to make.

Great recipe, even if you cheat a bit, as I did. I didn't have time to do a fresh sauce, so I used a trusted (bottled) marinara and added fresh basil and the cream for a sauce rosa concept A huge hit with the kids and adults!

I've been cooking recipes from this site for years and have yet to rate a dish, but this one deserves it. This was absolutely fantastic. My man complains that I can't follow a recipe exactly, and so I decided to try this time. I'll admit I was very nervous about the concentration of spices in the sauce but it turned out delicious!! I added a small diced jalapeno pepper and a diced red bell pepper to the onion / garlic mix inside the cannelloni, and used ready-to-bake cannellonis instead of lasagna noodles. Also melted some jalapeno jack on top during the last five minutes of baking. Definitely a keeper.

i've been making this for years! Play with the ingredients - more garlic, more chili flakes... Lots of fresh shrimp & crab!!! I use standard lasagne noodles in a box (boil, drain & roll). It's messy to roll by hand, but it works best, and come on - who's concerned about dirty hands while cooking?! A good staple. Will try with homemade pasta :) Yum!

Made it last night for 12 people. w/ fresh tomatoes etc. per recipe - I took advice and substituted scallops for crab- made it w/out seafood for the vegetarians. Also presented it w/ aspargus between 2 cannellonis - and added a parmesan sauce .. a little trail of tomato paste - and pesto for presentation. Looked beautiful - tasted "good" everyone cleaned their plates - and even asked for more- however- I thought it was "good" but not "great" - That much work - the food should be "GREAT"!

I made this last night for a dinner party, exactly as written. It was great, but sort of expensive for a baked pasta dish, since I used fresh crab meat ($29/lb!) and fresh shrimp. I bought fresh no boil lasagne noodles and the assembly was very easy--I'm not sure why the other reviewers used pastry bags--I just used my hands to roll up the noodles and filling. In short, a very good dinner for company!

Rating: 4
Delicious. It is time consuming, but the trade off is there are no last minute preparations so it's great for special occasions when you want to spend time with guests. For those who thought the sauce is overwhelming, what kind of crab are you using? I use Maryland Blue Crab which we enjoy here in the Mid Atlantic area with spicy Old Bay Seasoning. The sauce might very well be too much for Alaskan Crab. Am going to look for the boxed tomatos suggested by another cook.

Such a fabulous dish!! My daughter asked for something special to take back to college with her and I made this for dinner with the intention of her taking the leftovers. With 5 people, there were none. The pans were licked clean!! In order to save time, I bought pre-chopped onions and grated cheeses. A definite keeper in my recipe box.

Rating: 3
Great! Shrimp get a bit overcooked; I'd use crab only or crab plus scallops next time. Canned crab was a-ok. I tried others' suggestions using the tomato cream sauce and the recommended homemade Alfredo. I think this lets the seafood through just fine. Be generous with the salt. Not too spicy, as others had said; I'd even add more red pepper flakes. Most importantly, this was great using asparagus in the mix; I'd even add spinach (if not some green beans).

This dish was absolutely fabulous. I prepared it all as stated in the recipe-- except fot the fact that I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the sauce-- and it was very, very well-received by all of my guests. Don't be put off by the sauce in the beginning-- the spices smell very pungent and overpowering at first, but after cooking, blending, adding the cream, and baking, it all blends together to perfection. I was worried about the sauce overpowering the delicate flavors of the seafood, but, honestly, the sauce becomes just as delicate as the shrimp and crab in the end. One thing to note: This dish will serve more than eight people, unless you just happen to have eight very, very hungry people on hand. Five of us barely even finished one third of of it, although we all thought is was quite yummy.

since my man watches his carbs, i cook accordingly. instead of using pasta, i thinly sliced and cooked eggplant (in oil/butter). i did everything else according to the recipe except i used 2 slices of eggplant placing the filling in the middle and baked. EXCELLENT. i also had left over filling which i used to stuff artichokes. i have a recipe for a white sauce i make which i used to pour over the top. another EXCELLENT meal for a carb watcher and an eat whatever you want person as well.

I made this dish for Xmas Eve dinner and served it to the in-laws. I served it with hot fresh rolls and a caesar salad and was thrilled with the response!! My mother-in-law enjoyed it so much that she told other relatives over the holidays. I have since emailed it to Aunts, cousins etc. I didn't bother with the fresh tomatoes -- instead I used canned diced and still the sauce was wonderful. I added scallops, just as a previous reviewer suggested and I used fresh crab (crab claws) instead of the canned. I pulled the fresh meat from the claws but must admit, I ended up eating some of the crab while preparing the dish. Yum. I had extra sauce left over so served it a few days later with fresh linguini. Four big forks!!

This is a keeper for me! Absolutely delicious and the sauce enhances the flavors of the seafood. I would make the sauce again for other pasta dishes.

I haven't made this, but just by scanning the recipe, I'd say that that sauce would overpower the delicate flavor of fresh shellfish.

OK, usually drives me nuts, but I have to comment on a previous reviewer's comment...(back quite a ways). Commented that finding "fresh tomatoes in December" made this recipe too difficult. If you REALLY require your tomatoes to be plucked off the vine immediately before using them, get yourself a greenhouse! Otherwise, the ones I got at my market were just fine, and I live in a place that has winter 9 months a year!

I have made this several times and have had rave reviews each time. The sauce is wonderful the way it is, IMHO, but I do add more seafood to the filling. I also make this by using crepes instead of lasagna noodles and topping the lot with extra cheese. An excellent dish all around!

Rating: 2
While I didn't find this recipe terribly difficult to prepare, I have to agree with the reviewers who thought the sauce is way too highly seasoned for the seafood. If I make this again, I'll cut way back on the amount of onions, garlic, red pepper and basil. I've been testing out recipes on this site, looking for ideas for a wedding reception to be held a year from now. This one's not going to work. I'd make it again, but I'd drastically alter the sauce ingredients. I also agree that the seafood amounts need to be doubled, and will add that the seafood needs to be as fresh as you can get.

I've made this recipe several times with the following changes. I make the crab mixture separate from the shrimp mixture and roll them in cooked lasagne noodles. Sometimes I only make one or the other. I make the red sauce without the whipping cream and vinegar and serve over the shrimp. I believe it tastes much better without the cream and vinegar. I make an Alfredo sauce using 5 Tbl. butter, 4 Tbl. minced garlic, 4 Tbl. flour, 2 pints heavy cream, 4 Tbl. diced fresh parsley, 1/4 cup white wine, 1/2 cup frated Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup grated provolone cheese, salt and white pepper to taste. I serve the Alfredo sauce over the crab mixture. When I've served the two together I plate them with about 5 asparagus spears in the center of the plate with each of the lasagne rolls on either side, then ladle a small amount of sauce over each. It looks beautiful and tastes great. I've received a lot of compliments. Oh, and this is a great do-ahead recipe. Can also be frozen in manageable quantities. I allow 2 per person for an entree.

I agree with previous reviewers, use prepared tomato, basil, and garlic sauce. This made much more than I needed. If serving salad and bread, appetizers and dessert, I would suggest only allowing half as much. I made enough for 30 guests and have lots of leftovers!!

I think the home-made sauce, with just the right amount of spiciness, is worth making... but I used Pomi brand fresh tomatoes from the box instead of dealing with the 2 lb. of fresh tomatoes; a real time saver. Also, I agree that this works well as a stuffed shell dish, and is much easier than making the cannelloni. My only criticism for the recepie is that the flavors of the seafood seemed overwhelmed by the cheese... did anyone try mozzarella instead of provolone?

Rating: 3
I made ravioli with this, using homemade noodles, and it was a good, light meal. Like another reviewer, I used more crab and shrimp than the recipe called for. I would never go to the trouble with the sauce again, though. I'd use a good bottled sauce up to the point of adding the cream.

Rating: 3
This is very good, but definitely should be done in stages. I also used manicotti shells and a pastry bag for the stuffing and it worked well. This is quite similar to manicotti, the seafood gives the dish a nice variation. I did feel, as good as it was, however, the final result was not quite worth the extended effort.

Rating: 3
My guests raved about this one! I took one reviewer's advice and used manicotti - much easier. I partially cooked shells and ended up using 9 x 13 and a smaller baking dish so they weren't overcrowded. Stuffed them with an espresso spoon. Couldn't get 'fresh' crab so I used canned. No one noticed. If possible, make the sauce a day before you plan to stuff/roll with filling. You won't feel like you spent the whole day in the kitchen.

I made the tomato cream sauce from this recipe and used it with the ricotta and bell pepper stuffed herb crepes (recipe from this site). I thought the sauce was very savory, but somewhat time consuming. I broke the prep down into stages. I never bother with peeling the small plum tomatoes, not worth the effort, and honestly, I (and anyone else I've served this to) don't even notice the peels in the sauce. I would definitely make this sauce again. I used fresh thyme, and fresh bay leaves in this recipe.

I highly recommend this recipe!!! I did change one thing. I did not puree the sauce because I like it chunky and it also saves time. It was great without that step!! Aloha from Maui!!

This is a perfect make-ahead recipe for company. I made the sauce several days before putting the whole thing together. I took the advice on using non-fat half and half and found it to be just fine as far as richness. One of my guests was vegetarian so I rolled two noodles with nothing but ricotta and he loved it .I used more shrimp and crab than the recipe called for and would do so again.

I didn't grade this recipe because actually I didn't make it, but I did make Christina's cream sauce below. It came out great except I think 3-4 tbsp. garlic is a little too much for a cream sauce. Oh, I also didn't add the parsley since I think green specks in a white sauce would be strange. :) I used egg roll wrappers and the filling for the Spinach, Ricotta and Prosciutto Cannelloni (on this site) plus a red sauce, with the cream sauce on top. Delish. Thanks Christina!

Rating: 3
This was good but not spectacular, especially considering the enormous amount of work which went into it. The sauce isn't anything special- next time I'd just get Classico or Five Brothers tomato-basil and put that in the blender and add the cream and vinegar (though tomatoes in SLC in December ain't exactly primo..) And I can think of more interesting things to do with expensive seafood than to smother it in all that cheese. However, our guests claimed to like it a lot. Would be good for picky eaters because it doesn't taste too much like anything.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge hit! Unfortunately I usually fall into the "Too Busy to Cook" category, so to save time on the sauce, I used a packaged sauce mix (Knorr Parma Rosa) and doctored it up a bit. A tip: it tastes better and is thicker when you use fat-free half and half versus milk/butter. The sauce in the recipe sounds wonderful, but the pasta itself is too delicious to not make simply because of the time-consuming sauce.

Wow!! Great seafood pasta! I figured three hours to prepare one dish for my husband is worth the effort. I made the tomato cream sauce and also my alfredo cream sauce. I agree with my husband, the alfredo sauce is soooo much better with the pasta than the tomato sauce. I will definitely make this again with the alfredo sauce. Take this challenge. Make two sauce and see for yourself. Here is my recipe for alfredo sauce. It will make enough for half of the pasta recipe: 5 Tbsp. butter, 3 to 4TBsp. minced garlic, 4 Tbsp. all purpose flour, 2 pint(956ml)of heavy whipping cream, 4 Tbsp. dried or fresh parsley, 1/4 cup of white wine, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper to season. In a medium sauce pan, melt butter and add minced garlic. Cook for 2 minutes at med. heat. Add flour and whisk for 20 secs. or until it's combined well. Add heavy cream slowly as you whisk. Continue to whisk until the liquid thickens( 7-10 mins.). When the sauce is fairly thick add white wine, parsley and parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for another 5 mins or until the sauce is thickened again. When you prepare the baking dish, add 2/3 cup of sauce at the bottom and place 6 to 8 cannelloni. Spread another 2/3 cup at the middle of the cannelloni and sprinkle with more parsley. Cover with foil and bake for 30-45 mins at 350 degrees. The extra alfredo sauce can be reheated and served on the side for those who likes extra sauce. Bon Appetit!

Pretty close to four forks. I really thought this was a great dish. Relatively unique in thought, easy (though time consuming) to execute, can be made largely in advance, looks great, and could serve as a elegant first course, main entree, or buffet table item. I used cooked mannacotti(sp?) shells and filled using my very clean hands and it was no trouble. Be very careful not to crowd them into the pan as the expand and you want perserve them as individual "rolls" when plating.

The sauce and filling were divine! I have made this twice- the first time I used the lasagna noodles and rolled things up, but the end product was basically like lasagna. The next time, I used the oven ready tubes, but I stacked them in a casserole dish, so when they baked up they all squished together and it was impossible to get them out individually, so I ended up cutting out servings, which was againg like layered lasagna. NEXT TIME I am going to use cooked pasta tubes, then lay them out single file in a dish. Hopefully the result will be the tube-filled pasta that I crave.

To cut down on prep time, I recommend using oven-ready cannelloni tubes and filling them with a pastry bag. It only took me ten minutes to fill twenty tubes, so I figure that saved me an hour--it's also much tidier. Great cannelonni!

I would like to suggest doubling the sauce recipe to freeze for future use. I also enriched the sauce with a crab fumet. Because this recipe is from New Orleans I could not resist adding equal measures of white and black pepper and a couple of dashes of Tobassco, serrano chilies and red bell pepper in honor of Chef Paul.

The dish was quite good. I made the meal a few days before serving it (about three days). I froze the cannelonis and refrigerated the sauce - both seemed to keep quite well. My advice would be to do exactly as I had done, since the preparation time is about 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

I made the sauce the night before I planned to make this. This helps cut down on prep time. I used the no-bake lasagna as it was the widest I could find, and cooked until just soft enough to work with. I ended up with 15 Cannellonis and ate them all within three days. Nummo!!
