This is the most amazing chicken stock I have every had. I have been lucky to find chicken bones at "whole foods" very reasonable to add to whatever I have saved. I use this with a wonderful soup recipe from The Silver Palate - takes me back and my family just loves this. If you only make one this is the one. Make a giant potful so you can save some in the freezer. Outstanding. thanx

Absolutely amazing deep rich stock - what else do you want from a stock? Used in a curried carrot/potato soup and a sauce for Beef tenderloin for a dinner party, and both dishes turned out heavenly. Popped the rest in 1 cup ziplocks in the freezer for all those recipes that you wish you have stock for

I roasted a chicken in my rotisserie and removed off most of the meat, saving the skin. I put the skin and whole carcass in the pot to simmer. I also added about 1.5 Tbsps. of chopped ginger. After removing the fat, the result was an excellent broth that nourished my sick daughter and made the house smell wonderful.

Given I had a Costco roasted chicken languishing in my fridge, I tried making this stock with it. Not nearly as good as using raw chicken, especially wings & backs. It lacks depth of flavor and the rich mouthfeel that comes from all that collagen in the wings. Oh well, still a decent use of a cooked carcass; I added flavor with 'Better than Boullion' chicken stock paste.

Question: Can I use the carcass from a roasted chicken?

This is the best chicken stock I've ever tasted. Wonderful depth of flavor-- can't wait to try it in my favorite onion soup recipe. Used it in a leek and potato soup last week, was wonderful. I especially like the opportunity to use a carcass from a roaster to make it.

This recipe is a keeper. If you make sauces of any sort that require either chicken or beef stock, this is the one to use. Its rich, smooth and flavorful and lends itself very well as a base. I used to reduce my stocks by ¾ to intensify flavours. With this stock there is no need to do such. If you want professional quality in a sauce, start it with this one, you wont be disappointed

Boulder - the stock won't go bad in the food poisoning sense in the freezer, but over time the flavours will be less intense. I use it right away for soup where it is the star and use the older stock in recipes where I want the depth of stock. As far as this recipe goes - I have never added mushrooms to stock (and won't for soup) but as a base for a meat dish the mushrooms are incredible.

Can anyone tell me really how long can I freeze stock/broth for. Three recipes have 3 diffenent answers. 1, 3 and 6 mos. I have some in my freezer that I made in June. How would I tell if it was "bad"?

To KC from Nashville - you did nothing wrong, that's what happens with real chicken! The cooled stock should gel, although the fat will be a distinct layer on top. Sounds like you've got good eatin' on the way.

i just made this stock and it smells and tastes wonderful. but, after it cooled, when i went to skim off the fat, i found the stock to be semi-solid. any idea what i have done wrong?

Truly easy and wonderful. I used the chicken meat off the legs,thighs and breast in another soup receipe. I could never make a usable chicken stock before and now I can. THANK YOU!

Wonderful. After browning the vegetables, removed them from pot and set them aside- and browned the chicken (I used wings) for extra flavor and deglazed with wine before adding back veggies. Also added parsnips to the vegetable mix to give it a bit of sweetness. Outstanding.

Absolutely the very best chicken stock I have ever made! Heeded the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2 parsnips with great results - just a hint of sweetness. I used 5 lbs. organic, free-range chicken parts(wings, backs, butcher trimmings/bones) and I think that made a remarkable difference. Used fresh herbs as listed, added a 6" sprig of fresh rosemary and did not peel the onion or garlic. The resulting stock was a lovely colour and alive with flavour. If you are looking for the definitive chicken stock recipe, you have definitely found it in this one! Cheers!

This stock has lots of flavour made with all the listed ingredients, fresh herbs from the garden and a couple of chopped parsnips. I couldn't get mixed chicken parts therefore used approx. 4lbs of backs. Nice colour not peeling the onion.

This chicken stock recipe is bursting with flavor and relatively easy to make. I kick it up just a bit with a couple of inches of sliced ginger. I vary the herbs depending on what I have on hand. And, with or without the mushrooms, this stock is still great. If you're looking for the secret to great soups, it starts with a heavenly stock like this one. Thanks, Chef Van Aken!
