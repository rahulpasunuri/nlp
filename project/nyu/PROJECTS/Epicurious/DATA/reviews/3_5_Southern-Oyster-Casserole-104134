Delish! Didn't have any problem with it being too soupy. The water that cooked out of the oysters evaporated after i let the mixture simmer for a few minutes. I will be making this often.

This is what keeps my status as my dad's favorite daughter. Well, this and being his only daughter. I've made this the past four or five Thanksgivings and Christmases, and it's delicious. If I end up with too much liquid from the mushrooms, I take the mushrooms out and set them aside, add a little white wine and reduce the liquid to just 1/4 cup or so.

to the Cook from Maryland..... it does say, "Drain the oysters and set aside."

This ended up as an oyster stew instead of a casserole...I did not drain any of the liquid off...just assumed that it was tested first by those writing the recipe.

haven't made this yet, considering giving it a try as an alternative to my old standby of scalloped oysters, which is my gandmothers recipe made with oyster cracker instead of saltimes like cook above. considering the concerns re moisture, may just stick with what I know and add some perppers (love red peppers!)

Very good and easy as a starter for a holiday meal.

I served this today to four couples as a side dish to a Christmas turkey with all the trimmings. I did indeed drain and did add some heat. Three of the couples tooks copies of the recipe home with them. It was the first dish emptied. I thoroughly enjoyed this and highly recommend it to you.

I enjoyed this dish. The mushrooms leave a lot of liquid, but after a day it seemed to thicken up. I used the size dish recomended and it came out really thin. Would use a smaller dish next time.

Sorry ... I forgot to add that I also drained the liquid - an absolute must!

This was a really (really) good dish! I halved the amount of oysters (as it was for two) but kept the amount of veggies and sauce the same. I was going to wing it with the amount of sauce to add but ended up using it all - and I would do it again!!! Except next time I will increase the osyters as suggested (and thus double the veggies and sauce) as we both would had enjoyed leftovers the next day! As other reviewers were saying it needed a 'punch', I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and it was perfect! As well, I will either increase the amount of cheese or try another type like cream cheese. I appreciate that cream cheese may be too common but this dish would be mouth-watering with it!!!

Thanks to previous reviewers for the heads up on getting rid of the liquid before adding the cream/cheese mixture - it was still a bit runny, but it was absolutely delicious. My husband had never had an oyster casserole before, and I was a little nervous serving it to him, but he just kept raving. I halved the amount of oysters and made slightly less sauce, and then just served it for two for a main course. Wonderful.

Delish! I drained the oysters very well before cooking and then used only about half the liquid that cooked out (strained it and put the onion etc. bits back in the pan and added half the liquid.) It was just right. I made it for Thanksgiving and will make again tonight for New Years Eve. To me this is definitely a starter type recipe - I would never try to use it as a sub for the turkey dressing.

This dish is a keeper. My Thanksgiving guests all loved it. It was very rich and would be great served over rice with a salad on the side. Yummy

Post script to my review of 11/29/03 -- While writing my remarks, I had put the foil-covered dish, covered by a large heavy pot, with brick on top, out on my chilly deck's picnic table. Too high for my arthritic dog to climb. I thought! Sure enough -- when I went out to retrieve it, the dish was uncovered, revealing a small scoop at the side -- and the liquid mostly gone. I reasoned that he had not disturbed/contaminated the rest of this COSTLY dish and that the broiling would kill any dog germs. Alerted by the complaints of others about blandness, I added some Cajun fish seasoning to the buttered crumbs. My family liked the dish (I told them the story after dinner), but I shall not bother with that oyster recipe again.

People, People, People! For crying out loud! Test the freakin' recipe before serving it to your dang guests! Don't you all know the first cardinal rule of cooking and entertaining?!?!?! Sheesh!! Get a clue!!!

Urgh. Try my grandma's recipe. Open two cans of oysters, or a similar amount of fresh oysters. Put it in a bowl,liquid and all,with two packages of crushed saltines. Mix it up, let it sit a bit. Now, chop a quarter cup of onion and quarter cup of celery, very fine. Mix with the oysters, add salt and pepper. Moisten with milk or cream if it needs it. Line a pan with 1/2 stick of butter, chopped up. Put in the stuffing, chop the rest of the stick on top, bake an hour, or till brown, around 350. Enjoy!

I thought this recipe was delicious. So did our 24 guests. I used red pepper and added probably 2 extra cups of breadcrumbs on top. Wonderful!

I actually liked this dish, although I thought that by the recipes instructions - preparing the oysters in the pan then heating again in the oven, the oyster become a bit tough and lose some vital flavor. Also, I did drain almost half of the liquid out before putting in the oven, otherwise it would have been more like an oyster stew.

I made this casserole as the dressing for Thanksgiving. By the time our 18-person group had served themselves and sat down, this dish was lukewarm. Yuk!! It didn't have a lot of flavor or zip, and lukewarm (cooked) oysters aren't very appealing! (and yes, I drained the recipe before baking as others had advised). Worst of all, I spent easily as much on this dish as on the whole turkey. I wouldn't make this dish again without adding a generous spot of Tobasco and keeping it piping hot on a warming tray -- and even then I don't think I'll be inviting it to Thanksgiving next year. When everyone was done, their plates all were clean except for mounds of the oyster casserole!!

Ugh!! This recipe was a nightmare. The mushrooms didn't cook, there was way to many oysters, and when the oyster's released their liquid, I was left with a soupy mess. I ended up throwing the whole thing down the drain. What a waste!

My husband thought it was delicious.I did not use the bell pepper and I replaced part of the scallions with a shallot.I also cut the recipe down to 4/5 of a pint of oysters and reduced the rest of the ingredients accordingly.I made the cheese sauce rather thick to accomodate the liquid from the oysters which gave the dish a more oyster flavor.My husband had it for lunch - a generous portion for one and certainly enough for two.The other contributors comments were really useful.A very good dish!And simple.

I made this for my family on Christmas. We used to make another version. This recipe was far superior. I drained the mixture before I put it in the casserole dish. Was not watery at all. Will make again in 2002. Excellent recipe!!

I would mk it again b/c my friends liked it so much. Personally I thought it was ok; I used canned oysters and could taste it. Perhaps fresh would make the difference. Would also use celery instead of green bell pepper next time.

OK. So, I read everyone's comments about this dish being too watery before I made it this Thanksgiving. Thanks for the heads up. To remedy that problem I drained off most of the excess water/broth before I added the cheese sauce to the Oysters/Mushrooms, etc. This seemed to work great as the dish had a nice and thick consistency. Hope this helps for others who want to make it. It was definitely a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.

Wonderful flavor but way too watery to be considered a casserole

I have a GREAT recipie for "Scalloped Oysters" or "Oyster Pie". This is a WONDERFUL recipie that has been made for generations in our family! VERY SIMPLE & EASY!! Only 4 ingredients + salt & pepper (maybe a sprinkle of garlic powder!). VERY GOOD & VERY SIMPLE! My FAVE side dish on Thanksgiving! If you'd like the recipe, E-mail me!

My boyfriend fell to his knees in front of my parents and professed his undying love for my cooking. My father was equally impressed (although not with my boyfriend). This dish has now become a Thanksgiving expectation at the DeRocker household.

I made this for Easter. It was too watery. I did drain the oysters, but more water cooks out. All in all, I compensated with more cracker crumbs, etc., and it was passable, but it was not great.

Rating: 2
I tried this for the first time this Thanksgiving and something went very wrong! When I added the flour to the butter, instead of becoming smooth as the recipe indicates, it quickly became very thick! Thinking my heat must have been too high, I threw that out and started again. Same thing. I went ahead and added the cream and the cheese but it definitely had the wrong consistency;as a result the whole casserole was too watery, but the flavor was great. We ate most of it so as not to waste $20 of oysters..what did I do wrong?

A HUGE hit with my Thanksgiving guests, all 14, young and old. This is now a MUST at our Thanksgiving table. Could also be served as a stew; maybe put in individual crocks and top with croutons and parmesan before broiling.

We brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and the reviews ranged from "best oyster dish we've ever had" to "best oyster dish we've ever had." I'll try it next time with milk or half&half and see if it's still ok. Very colorful looking, and even makes people who say they don't like oysters to have second thoughts about broadening their horizons.

Reduced this for 4 people for a first course/appetizer dish. I served it with toasted bagette slices which were toasted with a butter and paremsean cheese spread. We just stood there "grazing" over the dish and enjoying every bite until the entire dish was empty. I am making this again next weekend, my husband insisted, for a wine groups Christmas party! We can't wait to have MORE!!!
