i have had this recipe in my files for years -- i thought it sounded appealing. i wish it had occurred to me to check it out first on epicurious. i add my voice to the chorus: this cake is a waste of ingredients, bouncy and bland.

A terrible recipe: pallid in flavor, oddball measurement sizes necessitating too many utensils, rubbery in texture. There's a reason why you should cream your butter and then wet/dry ingredients; it tastes better and is no harder to do.

I didn't actually make the cake ... I used this recipe for compote, and it worked out really well! I served it over an assortment of sorbets and it was very nice. The thyme gives it a great flavor. Make sure you use firmer fruits rather tha squishy ones.

Thank you various emailers! For saving me the time NOT to make this so called disappointing cake. This recipe review is a very good thing...

I baked this cake for a potluck but ended up taking something else because the cake tasted so awful. The sugar, poppy seed, lemon and vanilla flavors never showed up, even though I let the cake sit overnight to see if anything would develop. Instead, the cake tasted like raw flour and cornstarch and had the consistency of a brick. What a waste of lemon zest!

I used this recipe to make cup cakes. It worked very well. Although next time, perhaps a little more sugar and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

The cake does have a heavy texture as the other reviewers mention, however, my children really liked it...probably because my kids love poppyseeds & the cake was not very sweet & does have a light flavor (the adults thought it was bland). We served it with lemon cream instead of the fruit compote which did not work well. I think a fruit sauce like the compote would work very well as the cake would absorb some of the fruit but not become soggy as a lighter cake would. Kids give it a thumbs up & it is lower in calories than most desserts. More like a "snacking" cake/bread (will go in lunchboxes around here).

This cake was truly disappointing. It cannot be called lemon poppyseed cake, because it only has a hint of lemon flavor and the consistency is heavy,like bread. I did not make the fruit sauce, because I wasn't sure if the "cake" would come out correctly. Why the 1/2 cup of cornstarch? It adds nothing, but make the "cake" tasteless.

I was disapointed with this cake. It was salty, heavy and bland. The fruit made it edible, but wasn't enough to save it.

I've never added 1/2 cup of cornstarch to a cake recipe before and wasn't sure it was correct. Did not like the texture, very heavy, and bland flavor. The flavorful compote didn't even disguise the blandness of the cake.
