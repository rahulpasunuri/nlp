I made this roast as part of my mother's day celebration. It was a great combination of flavors, totally easy to accomplish. I cooked it the day before and served it cold, sliced super thin. I did not make the salad, but can't rave about the roast enough.

I made this tenderloin and refrigerated overnight. It sliced perfectly the next day and we made sandwiches with some good rolls and a sauce made from horseradish, dijon mustard and sour cream and topped with some leaves of bibb lettuce. Absolutely delicious. My 38 yr old son said it was the best sandwich he has ever eaten and all asked for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper.Next time I will try making the salad.

This dish has NEVER failed me. I've prepared the tenderloin roast alone several times with horseradish mashed potatoes, lemony green beans, and a lot of red wine, and guests rave. I usually use a 1.5-2 lb. roast from Whole Foods. The texture is unbeatable.

This was really just OK for us. As my husband says, good meat like this doesn't need anything to enhance it. The flavors were good, but there was too much going on to just enjoy the meat.

The salad is delightful. I used fresh green beans instead of waxed. The beef is delicious, but I did not especially like it at room temerature. Next time, I will serve it hot from the oven along side the salad. It would, however, be awesome cold for a picnic.

This was good for a very easy steak dish, but I would be extremely disappointed if I received this at a restaurant, since it's really not very spectacular at all. The mustard sauce was suprisingly bland -- I was expecting more of a kick or a richer flavor or something. I'll make it again because it's not bad and it's very quick and easy, but I would never make this to impress other people.

OH MY GOSH! This melted in our mouths. Absolutely fabulous! My first attempt at this cut of meat and my guests were amazed. The compliments were non stop. And talk about easy. Thank you. Thank you!

THANK YOU EPICURIOUS!!! This recipe was so delicious and simple to make. The rub was mustardy but slightly sweet, and it complemented perfectly with the peppery arugula, sweet red onions, and balsamic vinaigrette. Was a hit for our dinner party, and I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

This is the second time that I have made this dish, and both times it has been a hit. We used it as the main course for a smart picnic, it was so simple to transport. The mustard crust is delicious, and the beef is perfect if you can use an internal thermometer to judge the cooking. We served with a simple new potato salad and some cherry tomatoes from the garden, and ended the meal with a raspberry, nectarine and almond tart - yum!

Great! I followed a previous reviewers advice and browned it earlier in the day to save myself some work once my company arrived. I then covered the tenderloin with the mustard sauce and put the roast back in the fridge. I took it out and let it rest for about an hour before putting it in the oven. It got rave reviews! And one of my guests is a chef! I am looking forward to another dinner party so I can serve this again!

I don't like raw onions, so after browning the beef, I sauteed the sliced onions in the same pan. Then after roasting the beef, added the mustard pan drippings to the onions. I served the green beans on top of the arugula, then the beef and then the sauteed onions. It was a lovely presentation and delicious!

Easy and yummy. I used stew chunks for convenience and only had plain mustard and it was still great!

Love this recipe! Simple, but so elegant and delicious! Served it chilled, due to the need to prepare in advance. I used fresh spinach instead of arugula... everyone LOVED it!

Wonderful. I made it 2x in one week for different groups. The more rare, the better. Great for sandwiches if you can depend on leftovers.

Made this last night for a family gathering, so i tripled or quadrupled the ingredients. I also browned the meat earlier in the day and then brought it to room temperature. It didn't seem to hurt -- everyone loved it. Definitely worth repeating.

This is really a great recipe. Very simple, but packed with flavor and a beautiful presentation. Highly recommend. We served the roast in thick steaks, on top of the arugula. Perfect.

I've prepared this recipe four or five times - it's a winner. Twice as the instructions indicate, once grilling the beef over direct heat. I've also used the mustard mixture on a three pound tenderloin roast - grilled over direct heat for 10 minutes, flipped and 10 more - then lowered the heat and roasted to 125 degrees internal. Cool and slice, serve at room temp on a light summer dinner buffet - guests raved!

One of the best easy, elegant, and delicious recipes - made it last year for my sweetheart's 50th birthday for a crowd of 40+ and they ate every scrap, even though there were many delicious dishes left on the buffet. I use Rollands grainy mustard since it has no added sugar and decrease the brown sugar slightly. We love the salad as-is, but only if we can find the wax beans which impart a different flavor and definitely make the visual presentation. The only word of caution - I purchased whole tenderloins and I recommend having the butcher trim them first. Also, browning the tenderloin first is critical (I forgot once and it wasn't the same). This definitely works on tenderloin steaks as others have mentioned.

We served this with goat-cheese scalloped potatoes and lemon-rosemary carrots. It was divine. We sliced the meat, but did not toss it with the salad. Instead, we tossed the salad and dressing, then layered the meat on top. This allowed us to not waste the lovely pan drippings, which we deglaced and drizzled on top of the entire dish.

A really great summer meal: fancy-seeming, but easy to make, a nice mix of flavours and textures and it looks pretty on the plate.

No question, this recipe is a keeper.

This was really a nice dish. I couldn't find a small beef tenderloin roast so I used two thick cut tenderloin steaks instead. I ended up cooking for about the same time as the roast (20min). Scrape up that mustard sauce off the bottom of the roasing pan, it's awesome!

This is an elegant and satisfying dish. I used Gulden's mustard and added a little more than the recipe called for to make it tangier. Absolutely fabulous.

I made the beef as indicated in the recipe, but prepared a romaine side salad with bleu cheese dressing instead of the arugula business. The mustard crust was awesome.

The argula in this recipe can be substituted with baby spinach.
