I have been making variations on this recipe since it was first published. Always yummy. The trick is a good crusty bread. I am using buffalo flank steak now instead of beef. Just as good and better for the environment.

I've made these sandwiches many times and always receive compliments. Very yummy. In a pinch, I use spinach leaves instead of arugula.

It's obvious that this recipe could benefit from individual modifications. We also roasted garlic for the spread. We used a grill pan for the meat so only 3min/side was needed. It was very good but nothing special and we have other steak sandwiches from this site that are much better.

These sandwiches were unbelievable!! (with few modifications, of course). We used green leaf lettuce because our grocer didn't have the arugula. Marinated the sliced tomatoes in balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Roasted 2 heads of garlic in the oven and then mashed and spread on bread instead of rubbing the 2 cloves. And finally, sauteed onions to top...My boyfriend said it's the best steak sandwich he's ever had!

I substituted home made roasted peppers marinated in olive oil and garlic for the tomatoes. It was incredible! I also used a flank steak instead of the NY strip.

I made this a second time and did a better job with the garlic bread so I felt I had to revise my initial rating. When the garlic bread is well made, this sandwich is extremely tasty.
