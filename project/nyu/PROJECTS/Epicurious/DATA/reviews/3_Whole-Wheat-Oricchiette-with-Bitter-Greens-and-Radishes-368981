4 forks for taste, 3 for technique. Cooks Illustrated has a recipe for Cacio e Pepe that whisks the finely grated cheese into the starchy pasta cooking liquid with a couple of tbsp of cream to prevent the cheese from clumping - will try that with this recipe next time.

I had to make some substitutions (no oricchiette at my local grocery store!) but this recipe was a hit. Definitely go heavy on the greens and don't skimp on the garlic. It also helps to top with a little extra Parmesan. It's spicy and rich and wonderfully filling. My lunch friends called it complex and delicious!

I thought this was a bit bland, but admittedly I forgot to add my breadcrumb mixture to the finished dish. I'm sure that would have made a big difference. I did like the sautéed radishes--they were sweet and mellow, and I would definitely use this technique with radishes again.

I would give this zero forks if that were an option. I can't express to you how terrible this meal was. The sauteed radishes were like a final punch in the face... no one ate more than a few bites of it and I threw the whole pot out. Sad.
