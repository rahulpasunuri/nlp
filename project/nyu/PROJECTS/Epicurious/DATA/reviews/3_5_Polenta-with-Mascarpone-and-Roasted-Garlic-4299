I've made this polenta several times now, with pretty good results each time. I generally love garlic but I ended up reducing the garlic because I felt that using the whole amount overwhelmed the polenta. I actually made it once without the garlic when in a time crunch and loved that the creaminess of the mascarpone came out more.

When reheating polenta just add more chicken stock or other liquid to make it soft again.

Easy, delicious! My partner suggests adding chopped sun-dried tomatoes the next time around.

i love this dish! i took advised from another reviewer and used half-n-half. I only used 4cups and 1 cup of chicken broth. This recipe seemed to double itself. I had plenty to give to the neighbors. Any suggestions on how to reheat so it turns out soft again. Everyone I ask keeps saying that is impossible. My husband made this with Osso Bucco. Very good dinner!!!

My husband loves this dish with steak or Saltimbocca. I use half & half instead of stock in all of my polenta dishes. It enriches this traditional Italian peasant mush.

THE YUMMIEST FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! Might as well call it the orgasmic polenta. I made it for my family, and before anyone got home I had eaten half the pot. One note though- didn't use all the garlic, maybe 10 cloves.

I enjoyed the texture that the cheese brought to this recipe. Unfortunately, although I reduced the amount of garlic by half, the flavour was still overwhelming. Others who tried it, who love garlic, had the same opinion. I will make it again but reduce the amount of garlic even more.
