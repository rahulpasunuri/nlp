I loved it, even without the cream.

Rich full flavor. Slightly muddy flavor - would recommend against adding oyster reserve liquid.

Eegads!! I thought this soup was *terrible*. Straining the soup after pureeing it takes every bit of body out of the soup. At it's best, it was more like an odd oyster stew (basically just oysters and milk). It seemed promising at the beginning (the shallots and sherry smelled wonderful), but went downhill from there. Not only was this incredibly thin (my garnishes sank right to the bottom), but I didn't like the look of the spinach floating on top. I won't ever make this again, but I might try incorporating the sherry and shallots into a better oyster bisque recipe.

The quantity of oysters is deceptive - size can vary greatly. Two jars weren't quite enough; and only contained eight oysters (which I cut into smaller pieces). My secret for always tender oysters...use a double-boiler. Saute shallots, etc. in top portion directly on flame, then put on double boiler to simmer oyster liquor, milk, cream, oysters.

We made this bisque for Christmas dinner. It was fabulous with a nice, mild oyster flavor and big meaty oysters in the broth. Be careful to just poach the oysters so they don't get tough.
