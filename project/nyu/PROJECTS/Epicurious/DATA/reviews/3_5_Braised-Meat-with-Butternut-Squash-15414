My stew became very thick and paste-like. Use plenty of vegetable or beef broth if you're in search of a true stew. I served the "stew" on a bed of rice to great success.

This was pretty easy since I had the butcher cut the meat. I usually lightly bake the butternut squash to make it easy to peel and cutup. I overcooked it, so the squash was pretty much done and I waited til near the end of the cooking to add it. I was fine with the sweetness of the sauce. I served it over rice.

This went over really well - Two of us ate almost all of it in one night! I used plain beef stew meat, rather than veal, and the meat was very tender. Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I added a bit of cloves while browning the meat. I really liked the sweetness of the butternut squash and the savory flavor of the meat together. I wouldn't go so far to call this "bland" - it's not really rich, or sweet, or salty, or spicy - but it does hit the spot on a cold, rainy night.

Before reading on, please note that I made minor changes, as follows: I sauteed the meat & onions using 1 T oil & 1 T butter, then finished the entire dish in the Crockpot. We found the flavors too bland for our tastes, but the recipe was good enough, if not interesting in concept.

If you like wine based stews this will live up to expectations. Use a good stock that has lots of flavor. The saltyness should accent the sweet Marsala.

I've made this several times in the last couple of years - a good winter dish. I have used regular white wine, but it is definitely better with a sweet wine. I've also used beef instead of veal, with good results.

This has turned into one of my FAVORITE dishes. A beautiful stew, wonderful layers to the flavor. It's a bit sweet for some, but most people find the sweetness unusual and balanced well by the onion and rosemary. Excellent!!! (and easy to make except for peeling squash.)

This is too easy and too good. Personally, I don't eat much red meat, or stew for that matter, and this one is great. It's perfect on a cold day - the sweetness of the butternut squash with richness of the red meat. Top it with a good cabernet sauvignon, and it's perfect. I added a bunch of chopped chard midway through the cooking time. I think it adds a nice texture and color. I also realized after an hour that the meat wasn't tenderizing very quickly, so I cut the pieces into smaller 1" (or smaller) cubes, and cooked it all in all about 1 3/4 hours, at which point the squash really did caramelize and turn into a puree texture. My boyfriend said this first attempt at stew was better than every one of his mom's growing up!

Delicious and very easy. I also served it on rice, although next time I would also add some spinach or snow peas on the side.

Couldn't find veal, used beef. Very bland even with "doctoring" with seasonings. Would NOT cook again.

Was different but too sweet. We live in Holland and the squashes are smaller so I checked to so the approx. size of a US squash and it said between 2-3 pounds so used about that. Might be a different taste... Had to temper it with more rosmary, garlic and also added cloves. Semed to balance it out and we enjoyed. Also used the microwave and worked well.

This dish was pretty good, but not great. I took the advice of the other reviewer who microwaved her squash halves and that really helped. The meat did turn out very tender, but, it was alot more work than it sounded like for just an O.K. dish.

This recipe was really a success -- everyone liked it, from my husband to my 2-year-old. I served it over rice, and there were no leftovers!

I served this with rice, sauteed zucchini, and a salad with a citrus vinaigrette for shabbat dinner -- it was delicious and the colors were beautiful, too!

This dish is superb! It's not something I would have ever thought to put together and I only tried it because I had both beef and a butternut squash that needed to be used and didn't want to make an extra trip to the grocery store. It was so good, that we all sat around after dinner in silence, with one or another of us taking turns saying, "That was SO good!". I used a boneless chuck roast, cut into 1" cubes, which came out very, very tender. And instead of parboiling the squash, I simply cut it in half, covered each half with plastic wrap, and microwaved it for 9 minutes. Then it was much easier to peel and cube. Since I only had dried rosemary, I used that. All I added was a mesclun salad with a citrus vinaigrette and some crusty, hearty whole grain bread. Wow! There's just a little bit left in the fridge right now that I'm thinking about as I write this...

Veddy good. Veddy, veddy, veddy good! A more delicate taste than a traditional stew. A great Sunday night family meal served up with a crusty loaf of bread. I'm not a big stew fan, but found this to my liking.

Wonderful taste that even our children enjoyed (and they are very picky). A twist of not waiting for the squash to puree made it a more hardy stew!

What a wonderful wya to enjoy veal stew meat. The veal is tender, and the squash puree is velvety. Make sure to try the carrot variation.
