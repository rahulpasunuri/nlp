This was wonderful, I replaced the water with mineral water and the corn oil with butter, definitely worth repeating. Served it with sour cherry compote, plum compote and nutella. It is a great addition to a an entree such as a good chowder, lentil soup or pea soup

This recipe is perfect at the end of a middle European/Western Slavic meal. It crowned my family borscht party (and served nine of us -- eight had two pancakes each, one of us had just one) with an elegant tasteful touch! For filling I used one jar of Bonne Maman cherry preserves and half a jar of St. Dalfour black cherry preserves, plus the juice of two small lemons and 2 Tbsp of very nice Kirsch. I omitted the sugar sprinkled on the crepes and we all found it just right -- sweet enough -- after the pickled/meaty tastes of Eastern European food.

I made this with the German Wine Dinner - a bit of trouble but very very good - esp. nice because you can do it ahead. I wouldn't change a thing - of course, I had my sister-in-law's home-made cherry preserves!

This recipe got excellent feed back when I tested it. the almond flavoring was a bit strong so I would go lighter on that next time. Cherry preserves are hard to find so a substitution may be necessary. I used cherry/apricot jam but preserves would be better as the jam melts and disappears.
