Even though I normally hate people that do what I'm doing right now...I'm doing it. I'm reviewing it based on (and only considering!) a few additions and changes I made. 1. I used 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp greek yogurt, 2. I used one whole egg, 3. I used a little less than 1/3 c polenta 4. I tossed the apples (you only need 2) in cinnamon, cardamom and rum and finally, in order to brown the top i took out the cake at 45 min and brushed the top w buttermilk (you could use butter, jelly, whatever) andbroiled it for a minute or two. With these changes, not only is the cake marginally more healthy its also delicious, and I imagine it'd be a bit bland with only plain apples on top. I love the polenta in it, and I served it w homemade vanilla bean ice cream (w a splash of buttermilk in it, bc why not you have it) and buttermilk salted caramel sauce. Great way to use up that extra quart of bmilk you've got! Try this recipe its very light and tasty!

While I liked this recipe, I might make it again only for myself, but not to serve to others. The polenta makes for an interesting texture, but it's a little odd. Recipe was a tad sweet for my taste, and I found that 4 apples were WAY too many for a 9-inch cake pan. An apple and a half were plenty. I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites.

me again. Actually looking at the directions, maybe not to the T. I mix the sugar, butter, eggs whites and vanilla in one bowl. After hand blending I use an electric blender to make sure the vanilla and egg white is evenly distributed as best as possible. But I don't whip to fluffiness. (But it will get a little fluffier). Then I blend the flour, corn meal, and baking powder. I then take the dry mixture and dump it into the wet mixture. And then hand mix it all.

Hi. I actually love the recipe. I follow the directions pretty much to the T. Perhaps you should try it again? I like the how moist the torte. Not too moist but not dry. Yes, the graininess and the corn is an interesting and enjoyable difference. The apple gives another dimension to the taste. The vanilla is subtle but definitely there. The overall taste and effect is not overwhelming and every bit is discernable. Then you can add to it for added complexity. Tonight I plan to serve the torte warm but topped with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce.

Made this exactly as written, except used a cake pan with removable bottom. After 45 Minutes baking, there was a lot of liquid from the apples sitting on top of the cake part, and apples were still a bit crisp. Returned to oven for 5 minutes. Removed the sides of the pan. Served it warm, and the "cake" was like a dense pudding - not fluffy. Returned it to oven again (just on the pan bottom only) for 15 minutes to try dry it out. Only a slight improvement. I'll be curious to know how others make out with this recipe. If I were to try it again,(not likely) I'd sautee the apples first, and add them late in the baking, or after. I like the grainy texture the cornmeal adds to the cake.
