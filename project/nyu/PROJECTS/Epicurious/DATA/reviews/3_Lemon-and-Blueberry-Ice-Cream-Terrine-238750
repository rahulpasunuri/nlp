This was very good and I had no trouble with the freezing process or the flavor. I like the pound cake suggestion, given by another reviewer, but if using the cookies I would suggest crushing them very fine.

i actually didn't think this was very good. i love blueberry ice cream, but i think the juice from the processed berries might have added too much liquid, because the ice cream reset very crystallized. the lemon layers were very good, though. i wouldn't make this again - i'd rather serve just some good quality ice cream

Made this cake for my Dads birthday and everyone loved it. Used Haagen Dazs vanilla bean ice cream. Instead of vanilla wafers, I used a store bought lemon pound cake to layer in between. I also skipped the whip cream. I love the tangy lemon ice cream. Delicious!
