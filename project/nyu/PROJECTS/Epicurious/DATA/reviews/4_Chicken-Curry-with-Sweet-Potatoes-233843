Fantastic! 4 forks because I can't believe something so easy can be so good. My son has a ton of allergies, so I'm always modifying recipes, usually resulting in a bland or unbalanced dish. Not so here! Everyone loved it. Changes I made: substituted red curry paste for the chili paste (which has peanuts and shrimp), 2 tsp lemongrass puree instead of stalks, 2 tsp ginger puree (the red curry paste already contains lemongrass/ginger), no carrots.

I increased the sauce by a third and added bok choi, various sautéed Asian mushrooms and red peppers at the end to have more veggies. Really good.

Lovely recipe. Thought the liquid got a little too thick at the end. Added a bit more stock. Yummy. Think I'll saute the onions as others suggested.

Absolutely delicious. Next time I will add more vegetables, since they seemed to reduce down. Much to my horror, discovered I was out of fresh ginger (I had lemongrass though) and had to use ground jarred. It was still amazing...very flavorful, and my picky 14 year old loved it.

A wonderful, easy recipe. I followed the directions this first time. Next time I will make it spicier (maybe a Thai chili?) and add more sweet potato. Can't wait!

This is an excellent dish as is, but it also affords the luxury of substitution and non-adherance. I often change it up using potatoes, skipping or adding some ingredients. Great meal and it's pretty easy! Best of all, the family loves it.

Restaurant quality! I saved this recipe a while back because I love Asian food and the ingredients sounded good. I tried it tonight and only made 2 changes out of necessity. I used chicken breast because I thought I had thigh meat, and I used jarred lemongrass-the whole jar. I did add a dried serrano only because I like it hot and the dish was FANTASTIC. Will definitely use thigh meat next time for sturdiness but overall, this is a restaurant quality recipe.

I love this recipe, especially on a cool fall or winter evening. The flavours are meld so well together. I sometimes add bok choy to it instead of carrots. Tastes even better the next day. A true family favourite!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Not sure why there are some haters. I'm Vietnamese and have eaten Vietnamese curry most of my life, but always at home. Rarely, do I ever see it served at restaurants. In general, I am not a fan of Vietnamese curry. Indian and Thai have so much more flavor. But, I think this Vietnamese version is really very good. It really brings back memories. Every time I eat it I think of that moment in the movie Ratatouille when Anton Ego tastes his first bite of the Remy's ratatoutille and he remembers running into the house to eat his mother's ratatouille. It's a simple dish with great flavors and it hits all the pleasures of comfort food.

I've made this enough times now that I don't need the recipe. The only change I make is to use a whole fryer chicken deboned and chopped into stew-sized pieces, using the carcass for stock. I like to add cauliflower for more veg. Way better the second day as a chunky soup.

The curry was a little less intense for me. I added 1 teaspoon ground coriander,1 teaspoon ground turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon more curry. We had this with orange scented couscous, from this site, (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Orange-Scented-Couscous-242696) and naan

Excellent recipe. The key is to prepare the ingredients as recommended in sequence. Preparation took 35-40 minutes. I thought the flavor was wonderful. Agree that onions could be sauteed initially rather than cooked at the end. I used a can of precooked sweet potatoes in addition to several uncooked ones. The lemongrass was good but make sure it fresh from the market and not excessively dehydrated which makes them more fibrous and tough. You could add mushrooms to this recipe as well.

This was very tasty, and I'll make it again, but I don't think it was as outstanding as many of the other reviewers did. I think without coconut milk it wouldn't be worth the effort. I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I used chicken breasts instead of thighs (and therefore cooked them less) and, as other reviewers did, added some thinly sliced red bell pepper for color. Again, there's nothing wrong with this recipe, but don't expect a knock-your- socks-off masterpiece. What you'll get is fragrant, hearty comfort food.

Substituted the sweet potatoes with Japanese/Hawaiian purple heart yam and it was AWESOME! The purple makes the sauce a bit dark but taste-wise, it made the dish!

I don't get all the raves, verging on hysteria. I eat Southeast Asian food, in particular Vietnamese, several times a week; lived in Thailand for years; and have taken cooking classes throughout SEAsia. This curry is BORING, bland, and oddly colored. I wouldn't normally use Gourmet or Bon Apetit for ethnic food, but I figured this would be fine, given that it's excerpted from an actual Vietnamese cookbook.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe using seitan packed in water and vegetable stock. It was so tasty! I also used a low fat coconut milk purchased from Trader Joe's and substituted mint for the lemongrass [didn't have any in the house]. Loved it!

This curry is fantastic! Tastes like restaurant quality. The only thing I would change is sauteing the onion slices along with the ginger and other spices in the beginning rather than adding at the end.

Absolutely delicious and amazingly simple. I didn't bother with shallots, basil or scallions. I served over black sweet(sticky)rice which made a beatiful contrast with the curry and sweet potatoes.You can find the rice at Asian and specialty markets. Get good quality curry.I get mine from Penzy's.

It's pretty easy to turn this recipe into a sodium- fest, between the fish sauce and the salt rub on the chicken. My advice is to follow the measurements and adjust at the end. This is a good recipe and produces a very strong dark curry.

This was great. Hearty, delicious, and good for you. There were a few things I didn't have - shallot, basil, scallions. Also, I used a small amount of dried lemon grass powder (1/8 teaspoon) and used ginger paste (1 teaspoon). Also I used lite coconut milk and chicken breast instead of thigh. For the curry powder, I only had 2 tablespoons left, so for the marinating powder I substituted on tablespoon garam masala. All of these changes still made the dish great. This will go in my regular rotation!

This has quickly become one of our "go to" meals. Amazing flavors - so simple and yet so rich - along with one of our favorite vegetables, the humble sweet potato. Served as a soup or over brown or white rice this dish is delicious!

Why bother going out for Vietnamese when you can make it at home and it tastes soooo good? I would definitely make this again. The only change I would make is cutting the carrots and sweet potato into smaller pieces (bite size) to make it easier to eat AND to make sure they cook through. I served my curry over brown rice.

Ridiculously good! I am used to making curries from Epicurious and this one is amazing! The Vietnamese take on the dish was a touch different and was so flavorful. I doubled the dish and saved some for the next day. I cooked some pasta on the second day and added it to the dish. There was plenty of sauce for the "revised" pasta dish. It was a major hit. Spicy, but even my 2.5 year old loooooved it. This is now a part of my repertoire.

I shared this recipe on Facebook with the comment, "Holy crap. My mouth just made a new best friend." Made almost exactly as written; only changes being added half a head of cauliflower, and reserved 1/4c chicken stock to make a cornstarch paste.

Delicious. Skipped the pepper sauce in hopes that my kids would like it but it was already too spicy. Mind you, they're not adventuresome. Some kids would love it. Delicious, very healthy meal. You could even throw in some broccoli or beans and make this even more colorful. A keeper!

Rating: 4
This is so fantastic-a new favorite! The broth is to-die-for delicious. I used homemade chicken stock, which I think is crucial, and reduced the fish sauce to 2 TBS since I am not a big fan of its flavor. Used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and cut them into big chunks. My husband was practically licking the bowl. We will make this again, definitely.

Rating: 4
This is really good...completely over the top good. I was pressed for time, getting kids, etc...so I pan seared the sweet potatoes, onions and some bell pepper. Threw them in a deep covered dish..pan seared the chicken, threw it on top and did the sauce in the pan on the stove. Once is boiled, I poured it into the deep dish and put into the oven to finish in about 30 minutes. Put some broccoli on the top to steam the last 5 minutes or so...AMAZINGLY good. Had rice as a side and the only thing I will do differently will be to add more of a thickener to the yummy sauce. That sauce is like a cool drink of water on a summer day - simply divine!!

Rating: 4
An excellent curry. Richly flavorful, but lighter and fresher than an Indian curry. Spend some time making sure you assemble the right ingredients, which will most likely require a trip to your local Asian Market. After that, it's very easy. I don't think you could possibly mess it up, even if you didn't really follow the directions. I tripled the recipe and made it the day before. Definitely serve it with lots of bread. Vietnamese curries are very soupy and nobody will want any of it to go to waste. Both the coconut flavor and the heat are in balance, neither one is overwhelming.

Rating: 4
Stop the presses. This has to be one of the best (if not the best) recipe from Epicurious that I have ever prepared. The only change I made was to add some red pepper slices in the final 2 minutes, and a generous pile of fresh spinach in that last one minute of cooking. Om nom nom nom. One comment on previous reviews: chili paste (the ingredient called for) and curry paste are two different things. Both are good but the results will be different.

Rating: 4
Rich, authentic, delicious. The sweet potatoes add that great comfort-food element. Adjustments I made based on other people's reviews: - Limit the stock to 1 cup. This stops it getting too soupy. Mine turned out perfectly, no need for rice. - Limit fish sauce to 2 spoons, enough to taste but not be overwhelming. - Use a LARGE pan. - I cut the chicken thighs into large pieces. - I like a bit of sheen on my curry so I used 3 spoons of oil instead of 2.

Loved this recipe and it was easy to make. I used 1 tbsp of the curry paste. It had just the right amount of mild spice. Since this is a Vietnamese dish, it should not be as spicy as Thai receipes...

The flavors in this are wonderful and easy to make, as long as all the ingredients are on hand. I didn't have any lemongrass, so I used a piece of lemon peel and put it in the pot. There was a lot of liquid, so I served this on a bed on basmati rice. We will make this again and again!

This is great curry - it won a cooking competition between friends! I would recommend a couple of refinements: I added roasted red chili paste (Thai Kitchen brand), lemon zest and scallions in addition to shallots. Also I cut the chicken broth to a little more than a cup. (Starch is a good thickener if it's too soupy.) And skip the fish oil or just use very little. Mine tasted better without it.

Rating: 4
Thought this was great. Used chicken breasts (instead of thights)and sauteed them first and did not add them back in until the last eight minutes or so. I always brine my chicken breasts so they were not dry. Added red bell pepper, some broccoli I had microwaved, and 10 oz frozen peas when I added the onion and the coconut milk. I added the sweet potatoes with the carrots, and they still were a bit hard. In the future, I will only use them in season--they were not great although they were purchased at Whole Foods. I definitely would use the full fat coconut milk and use less chicken broth as it turned out too soupy. A cornstarch paste did not even thicken it. I also used curry paste, instead of chili paste and added mango chutney in the last five minutes of cooking. Exceptional flavor--

Rating: 4
This recipe is a weekday regular for me. I was able to find fish sauce and lemon grass at my local supermarket; they both make a significant difference. The sweet potato is an excellent vegetable in curry. I don't add chicken; instead, I just cook the vegetables and saute tofu on the side. I serve the curry and tofu with brown rice. Great!

Fantastic. I needed a large pot, rather than a medium, and glad I did. It was great!

This is a pretty rad curry. I omitted both fish sauce and shallots and used breast filets for the chicken. I was worried that the sweet potatoes would either need more cooking than the other veggies or fall apart, but everything cooked beautifully. Pretty delicious - this is my new go-to curry!

I loved this recipe! I had to make a few adjustments due to not having a fw of the ingredients on hand, but it was the perfect recipe base and turned out to be a fantastic meal! I upped the curry powder and added some red curry paste along with some chili flakes, and this gave the dish a great amount of both curry flavor and heat. I used lemongrass paste from a tube (about a Tablespoon) and substituted a regular baking potatoe for the sweet potato (which turned out to be just fine). I added a sliced red bell pepper, too. THe main thing I did was a bit desperate, but I really really wanted the coconut flavor in the final dish (I was out of coconut milk)... so I used a half cup of my coconut flavored coffee creamer and omitted the sugar in the recipe. It was definately sweet, so I diluted it with some more chicken broth and it turned out GREAT! I would recomment cutting the thighs up into bite sized pieces before or after they have cooked, as that makes for a better presentation and it's easier to eat. Served over jasmine rice with some edemame on the side... this dish is a definate keeper! I'm sharing it with all my friends and family! Thanks!

Yum! Made it tonight using 1 1/2 t red pepper flakes and added a red bell pepper along with the onions and sweet potato. The flavors came together really well.

This recipe is very good but I had higher expectations after reading all of the reviews. Perhaps it is because I really like Thai curries. So it maybe just a personal thing. I did use Thai green curry paste as one reviewer suggested. I also roasted the sweet potato pieces so they didn't turn in to mush.

Loved this recipe. Will make it again and again. The only way I will tweak it is to use a little less fish sauce. The taste was fine, but it stuck to my breath hours afterward which was yucky. I had a butternut squash on hand, so I substituted the sweet potato for the squash. It was very good.

Very tasty and simple to make. Added some corn starch to thicken the sauce and less chicken stock (1 cup only) as others suggested. Served over jasmine rice. Would prefer cooking without coconut milk to cut down on the fat, but I guess occasionally it's ok to be decadent...

This is a great, easy, one-pot meal. I didn't have any lemongrass either and I chose to use chicken on the bone, mushroom broth, and added eggplant. I took another cook's advice and simmered it for almost an hour. Since I was using on-bone chicken and simmering for longer I added approx another half cup of broth and almost the full rest of the coconut milk. All in all an excellent recipe.

This is my go-to curry recipe. The beauty of it is not in its simplicity, but like many people have pointed out here, its flexibility. Sometimes I add the carrots, sometimes I don't. I add whatever veggies I have around the house, but always use sweet potatoes and onions. Additions have included zucchini, green and red peppers, raisins, apples, and tomatoes. Whatever you have on hand. Use it. And don't skimp on the sweet. It will off-set your curry well. Make sure you use coconut milk. Make sure you use good curry, fish sauce and fresh ginger. This base is what will make your meal special. And, definitely don't forget the shallots and garlic. Substitutions you can make include using lemon zest and juice instead of the lemongrass, and using chili pepper flakes. I use both chili paste and the pepper flakes. It seems to work. Lastly, if your dish comes out on the watery side, thicken with corn starch... and remember the next time you make this (believe me, you will), to go lightly with the chicken stock. Enjoy :)

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper, great flavour, very easy and fast clean up (which you can do while it simmers). It's even better the next day. The recipe didn't mention to cover while it simmered- which I did. My 6 & 10 year olds loved this, but I will cut back a bit on the chili flakes for their taste next time.

This is a fabulous curry I have made many times! Making it again tomorrow...I like to add a red pepper, something green (have done sugar snaps and snow peas in the past). Adding fresh green beans this time. I just use the whole can of coconut milk and chicken broth. I also have a couple ears of corn and may cut it off the cob and add that too. Can't beat it!

This was REALLY good. I made a few changes - used veg stock instead of chicken, roasted sweet potatoes and served them seperately, and omitted the carrots (didn't have any).

This is definetly a keeper recipe. I love Thai[I agree with the other review that it seems more Thai than vietnamese but I have not been to either country so what do I KNOW?] and I will make this many times again. I had most of the ingrediants [It still shocks me how fish sauce smells in relation to what it does for food!] with the exception of shallots. I kept forgetting to buy some - didn't miss it. I did add 1/2 of a lime and used lemon peel as others mentioned. I can see using shrimp or duck with this in the future. My thanks to everyone for taking the time to write a review. YUM!!

This had to be one of the best curries I have ever made.....I followed the recipe quite close BUT added a tablespoon of Red Curry Paste and reduced the chilli paste to 1 heaping tsp. I threw in a red pepper at the same time as the carrots. I cooked the chicken for about an hour at a simmer then added the coconut milk and sp and simmered another hour as I wanted it to be reduced and slightly thickened, it worked well.

This came out more Thai tasting than Vietnamese, but it was still excellent :-) Not sure why this recipe calls for leaving the chicken thighs whole, but it works a lot better if you cut them up into 1-2" chunks. Brown them first and cook them nearly all the way through and take them out (add them in the last 5min of cooking), then follow the rest of the recipe instructions. At the end, if the sauce is too watery, take a tablespoon of corn starch and mix it with some water and throw it in to thicken it. I also used madras curry powder as someone else suggested. I didn't have Thai chili paste at home, but had sriracha/sambal oelek and shrimp paste, so I mixed the two together (1 tsp of each) because Thai chili paste is made of ground chili and shrimp paste; I also added 1 tsp of green curry to kick the heat up. Definitely use the coconut milk instead of cow's milk; it's needed for an authentic taste (as is the lemongrass). In the last minute, throw in the chopped Thai basil and scallions. I also cooked it 5min extra to get the sweet potatoes to soften up a bit more.

Rating: 3
This was delicious! It tasted like something I would get in a authentic Vietnamese restaurant. Though it didn't explicitly say, I cut the chicken into 2 inch pieces. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I found the cooking time just right for the veggies. Some reviewers said there was too much liquid -- I thought there was the perfect amount. Anyway, when you serve yourself, you can give yourself more or less liquid depending on what you like. You could also forgo the lemongrass if you don't have it. Or use just sweet potatoes or just carrots, or white potatoes instead of sweet potatoes. The recipe seems pretty flexible in that sense. Will definitely make again.

I made this last night to serve this afternoon for a TET party and it was delicious! The sauce was incredible...I served it with French bread and every last drop was sopped up. My Vietnamese daughter had two helpings.

This is definitely a keeper!

This was very authentic tasting and not very difficult to make. I added sugar snap peas for the last 10 minutes of cooking. I also skipped the lemongrass and added strips of lemon zest with excellent results. I already found the sauce a little runny, so I was glad to be using fat coconut milk. Next time I might add a little cornstarch. Make sure to garnish with basil...it adds a lot of flavor and freshness.
