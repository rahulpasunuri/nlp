I LOVE this. I omit the first step of sprinkling with salt. I used half the sugar and a large bunch of fresh dill. Since I omit the first step they last about 2days in the fridge. Wonderful!

Made it twice this week. Easy and good. Refreshing. I made it as written except I made a half a batch.

Like others, used about 1/2 the sugar called for, let it disolve then tasted it. Like my mother did, we always add sweet onion and grape tomatoes to this. Just wonderful and refreshing.

Easy and delicious.My husband has been making something similar long before we saw this recipe. He uses white balsamic and no sugar (no need). This holds up well in the frig. and is great with anything grilled!

Great Cucumber Salad..

So simple and delicious! I used garden cucumbers and sliced them using the slicer attachment for the food processor to get them very thin. I had some leftovers and wasn't sure how they'd hold up overnight in the fridge but they were just as delicious the following day.

This is super easy, and yummy, I didn't salt the cucumbers before putting them in the vinegar mixture.

This was a great summer salad. I looked over the other comments and also added some onion for sweetness. However, I felt that three tablespoons of sugar was too much (I made this one time before and felt like I was going into diabetic shock with all the sugar). I only added two tablespoons of sugar this time and it made a world of difference. Great salad!

This was very tasty & refreshing, I would make this again. I did add some homegrown onions which were also very sweet.

This is exactly how my grandmother made this. I love it! It's simple and fresh, and perfect for a picnic on a warm summer day.

This was quick, easy, and delicious, and my dinner guests loved it. I added cherry tomatoes (quartered) at the end right before chilling for 20 minutes, because they looked good and were on sale at the store. They added color & flavor and went great with it. I will definitely make this again!

Perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors. Very refreshing and light for a summer meal. Received many compliments when serving it! The thinness of the cucumbers makes this salad unique.

Very good, especially after a night in the fridge. I used garden cukes, which were on hand. I added a pressed clove of garlic and a thinly sliced onion. My pre-K critic approved and wanted more. Thanx

One of my favorite summer recipes on this site! Great for taking to barbecues, and people always rave about it! So easy to make - I only make it with farmstand/garden cucumbers, fresh dill and good, white wine vinegar. I too add onions for color. You can't miss with this one!

If you really have too much liquid, you may not be purging the cukes long enough. Give the salt a chance to draw out the liquid and then pat dry pretty forceful to get as much water out as possible. That should keep the dressing more intense and less watery...just a thought.

A classic! Crispy bite makes this a great summertime side. I also use it as a condiment on sandwiches instead of lettuce. Nice little change-up.

I have made this since I was a child! Now that I am a senior citizen, I use a mandolin and add both onion and tomatoes when everything is summer-perfect. For a couple of months of the year, I just keep adding more and more vegetables, and occasional vinegar and sugar, and keep it going in the fridge. Yummy addition to any meal! PS. I do not usually add the dill except at the last minute.

These cucumbers are fabulous. I served them to my brother and sister-in-law who don't like cucumbers and they both thought they were very good. The rest of my family, who like cucumbers, LOVED them. This is the best marinated cucumber recipe I've tried. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was delicious! I used a mandolin to slice the cukes and also some onion. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. Very crunchy and refreshing. I'll be making it again in a few days.

I agree with another reviewer below--too much liquid, even though I added an extra cuke. I also added a thinly sliced onion to add some contrast to the dill. A really refreshing salad.

I served this as a side dish and my family raved about it! I added a bit of red onion which I thought was a good addition. Nice light dish for the summer. I'll definitely make it again.

I used this as a side for spicy lamb korma and it worked well! The spice of the lamb made the salad seem much sweeter. It's so easy and has a touch of class. Next time I'll put it next to a less aggressive entree and see how it fares as a savory side. Yes, there'll soon be a 'next time'.

Made this with a summer meal of grilled pork chops and a pasta salad. It was fantastic! Used white wine vinegar and otherwise did not change a thing. Very refreshing. I must go and get more fresh dill from my aunt's garden, as I will be making this often! Baby or small hothouse or garden cucumbers are a must!!

Just made this for a family get together and it was a hit! So refreshing compared to the regular sour cream based recipes.

This recipe is a "sure thing". Slicing the cucumbers paper thin is so important. The cucumber slices thoroughly absorb all of the recipe's ingredients. Excellent with fish....Also, with grilled lamb chops. It is a great summer grill side dish. Don't be afraid to add other herbs and a very good, herbed, white wine vinegar.

Great, fresh tasting salad. Use white wine vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar for a more pleasant flavor.

i just halved this recipe to serve as a side with crabcakes, and it was great. the sweet and sour flavor was very strong, but the dill made it all more interesting and fresh. it was also really easy. i would definitely make it again!

Great technique for rib prep--roasting time may need adjustment based on type of roasting pan used. I used a 4.5 qt. LeCruest and the ribs were done in about 1 hour. I used my own rub but the sauce is wonderful... and it makes the ribs! I use this sauce for all of my BBQing now. Everyone loves it---even those who do not care for coffee!

I've been making this for years, too. It's important to slice cucumbers REALLY thin (use a slicer) and to squeeze all the water from them after letting them sit. You can rinse off the salt before squeezing the liquid, too. I add a little celery seed and diced sweet onion. Fantastic way to use homegrown cucumbers and the seeds have never been an issue when sliced thin.

I've been making this for ages using rice vinegar and adding a small (very small!!) amount of roasted sesame oil to give it an asian feel. you can even add toasted sesame seeds. your preference if you want to leave in the dill (not totally asain, but still yummy)

I've made this 3 times now. Great hot weather recipe. Took it to an outdoor concert and served it with a mid summer cookout. Good alternative to coleslaw.

This recipe was good, but it seemed lacking somehow. I think it could use some thinly-sliced white onions, champagne grapes, or jimica. Also, there was way too much dressing. Like I say, this is good, but it could use some pazzazz.

Scrumptious! I have children aged 2, 4 and 6 - all love it! We had this at a local restaurant and my 4 year old loved it - I came home to look on epicurious to find it et voila!!! Regular cucumbers are fine also. I added thinly sliced onions - not needed but that is how the restaurant did it. I would double the recipe for a party.

I made this and really like it. I cut it in half because I'm the only one in my household who will eat a cucumber. Think it really needs the hot-house cucumber called for. Wouldn't be good with too many seeds.

Great recipe! My mom used to serve cucumber simply cut up in white vinegar, and this takes that 'down-home' fave up a notch to something you can present at a BBQ to guests. Very tangy and fresh.

A nice lite side for an outdoor grill dinner. A good use for all those cucumbers from your(or in my case, my mother-in-law's)garden.

This is a great side dish for summertime! I've made it a couple of times now and every guest has raved about it. It's simple, but so good. Fresh cucumbers are really the key here, like everyone else says, they make all the difference in the world.

I've made this recipe twice. Once with regular grocery store cucumbers (which didn't turn out all that good) and another time with small pickling cucumbers and lots of fresh dill. These are very easy and a big hit. Several commented they could eat the whole bowl of them when made with the pickling cukes.

Very easy. Very good, very fresh.

Very, very easy to make. If at all possible use cucumbers from your garden or from the farmstand -- makes all the difference in the world! I used my mandoline slicer to make paperthin slices in minimal time. You'll want very thin slices in this dish.
