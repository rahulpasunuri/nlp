We really enjoyed this soup. Followed the advice of some reviewers and added carrot and celery to the onions along with some chopped garlic. I didn't have heavy cream or creme fraiche so I scooped the cream off the top of my raw milk and it worked great. I used some good fresh-grated parmesan, quite liberally and completely forgot the lemon juice. I guess the parmesan made up for it because I didn't remember that it was supposed to have lemon juice until my partner was commenting how good it tasted with the parmesan. This will definitely be a soup that I make again.

Excellent! I read the reviews and cut back to 1 tbsp of butter, added diced garlic, two stalks of chopped celery and two small, peeled and diced potatoes to the first step. Fantastic flavors w/perfect texture. Will definitely make again. I realize that I made changes that deviate from the original recipe, but the methods were the same. If you follow the methods, you can make subtle changes that will greatly enhance a recipe, and forums like this are fantastic for discovering amazing variations on great recipes. Give it a try with whatever you have in your kitchen at the moment, you won't be disappointed. Use fresh lemon juice at the end, though. It really makes the asparagus pop.

I had a pound of beautiful end of season Washington asparagus so we had this tonight for a late Father's Day dinner - with herb rubbed steak on the grill and roasted red & yellow peppers. I made the soup in advance using a mirepoix of carrot, celery and garlic per an earlier review and sprinkled it with sliced onion greens to serve (didn't have chives). It definitely needed acid - I used nearly two teaspoons of lemon juice for a half batch. I also peeled the ends of the bigger stalks so the soup was velvety smooth. A splash of sherry vinegar might be a nice alternative to the lemon juice. I'll make this again for sure. Also, the soup is rich so I think the suggested servings are misleading. I got four nice size servings from one pound of asparagus.

Nice, but not quite perfect. I found the flavors somewhat flat, which is what asparagus can be. Second time I made it, I started with a mirepoix (adding carrot, celery and garlic to the onion). This added an aromatic depth to the soup without overpowering the asparagus. Also sprinkled with freshly snipped chives before serving. For a more substantial soup, add small buttered or roasted croutons.

Excellent soup. Added a sliced leek to the onion. Only needed 5 cups of broth. Fried a couple of pieces of bacon and used the oil to quickly sauté the asparagus tips. Used the crumbled bacon for garnish as well as a little parmi cheese.

live in the south of France, and it is asparagus season. Made beautiful white asparagus for lunch and used the broken off parts and the leftovers for the soup. Didn't change the recipe (except for how I cooked the asparagus) and it was wonderful. I had homemade chicken broth in the freezer --- it looked beaufiful as weel --- white, with the white and purple tips on top...

I thought this was very tasty and easy to make. I added garlic, following other people's suggestions, and some thyme. Used cream and replaced the lemon juice with lime, since we were out of lemons. I grated parmesan cheese on the soup when serving, and I think that helped deepen the flavor.

This recipe was a hit! I used 3 bunches of asparagus (with woody parts cut off and tips reserved, about 2-1/3 lbs), 1 lg onion, 2 large garlic cloves and about 1 tbl of fresh thyme. I used Swanson veg broth, 2-1/2 cans. I tossed the tips with thyme, olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted in the oven, 8 min @ 400 degrees, made a nice garnish. Superb!

Rating: 3
Loved this. I do recommend a couple tweaks-if you think the asparagus is a bit woody, peel the thickest parts. I didnt, and the tough parts were a bit stringy & al dente. And, I did use a potato as well to thicken. No need to go to the trouble of putting hot soup in the blender-use your "boat motor"(hand blender)-quicker and safer. As an extra treat, I put a handful of lump crabmeat on the bowl before ladling in the hot soup. Served with crusty bread and it was a main course on a meatless meal day. This will stay in my recipe box!

The Cream of Asparagua Soup was delicious, but as a vegetarian I wanted to use a vegetarian broth. Rather than throw out the tough ends of the asparagus, I put them in a pot with a chopped carrot, leaves and stock of celery and onion and covered with water. Let this boil for about 20 minutes, drain the liquid only and use as the stock.

I made this recipe and used two bunches of asparagus which was just around 2 pounds. I added 1 chopped garlic clove and one teaspoon dried thyme to the onions. Soups was great. Would definitely make again. My 23 year old son said Uugh when he heard what I was serving. But he asked me to make to again so I guess he like it enough to give it an 8 out of 10 stars! I also gave it 8 stars. It's a keeper for something different and delicious.

WONDERFUL!!! I used leeks instead of onion...I don't care for the overpowering taste of onion in my soup. Leeks are somewhat lighter. I also took some day old french bread, toasted it, and then put butter and some parmesan cheese on it and stuck it under the broiler for croutons to put on top of the soup.leI chopped the broiled bread into small squares and put on top of soup.really good! The soup base would be good for baby artichokes or mushrooms as well, I think....

I made this for a quick lunch. Only had 1 pound of asparagus. I added 2 cloves of garlic and about a tablespoon of fresh basil. I used the immersion blender. It was quick and delicious! Don't leave out the lemon, it gives an extra layer of flavor that is perfect.

Rating: 4
Made it with veggie stock, lots of salt, pepper, garlic and fage greek yogurt. I used only a tiny bit of butter to sautee the onion. I topped the bowl with some grated parm and whole wheat croutons. This was a nice and healthy way to use up a big pack of asparagus from costco! This was a good soup but the addition of one boiled potato and some kind of spice/seasoning would have helped transport it to another less boring level because it was indeed a bit bland.

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious as written but next time I will add some garlic and shallots to the onions. I used heavy creme instead of creme fraiche. The key is to not skip the lemon juice! It really does bring out the great flavors. Also, for the people that complain about it having too little flavor, you may need to look at what you're using for stock. I used homemade chicken stock from the leftover carcass after making a roasted chicken. Homemade stock will always give you a better tasting (and healthier) soup. I served this in a shallow bowl with a halibut filet and some shaved pecorino.

Terrific soup - love all the suggestions! I only had four cups of chix broth so I put the woody ends in a cup or so of water with a vegetable bouillon and fresh thyme sprigs and simmered for 30 mins, strained and added the broth to the soup before pureeing. And speaking of that, despite the warning on blending hot liquids, I was a little anxious to get the job done and after the first blending session I put the remainder in the blender and when I turned it on it near blew the cover off - created quite the mess. Also added fresh thyme sprigs when the asparagus were cooking, removed them before blending, and only had whipping cream, so used that instead of heavy.

Rating: 4
So many great suggestions I thought I'd try the majority of them to taste test this for an upcoming dinner party. I cut the recipe in half in case it was a bust - added a shallot and two cloves of garlic to the onion. Used the woody ends simmered in chix broth to enhance the flavor. Added a sliced Yukon Gold potato for added thickness and after pureeing, put the soup in two separate pans. 1st pan: heavy cream and two slices of American Cheese; 2nd pan: Greek yogurt. The cream base was better but ultimately, I combined the two. This made quite a bit of soup even though it was cut in half. It was good but I'm not making it for the dinner party.

I used a mixture of cream and half and half. Sauteed three garlic cloves with the onion. I cooked the ends of the asparagus in the broth, had second thoughts and tossed them out. Some still ended up in the soup which was not a good thing even after cooking and pureeing.I wouldn't mess with them next time.I tried the pecorino romano and I thought it hijacked the soup. Might try the thyme next time.Enjoyed the soup so I will make it again.

Used 1 cup of heavy cream (misread the recipe), and added a dollop of sour cream at table. Threw in a sprig or 3 of thyme while the stalks were simmering. Skipped the garnish. Fantastic way to eat asparagus. Will recommend it to people on the fence about this veg.

If you LOVE asparagus and have an endless supply of farm fresh asparagus and are looking for new asparagus recipes, this soup is absolutely perfect for you! I did as others suggested and boiled the woody ends in broth for approximately 20 minutes. From there, I cooked the onion and three cloves of garlic minced in two TBSP butter and one TBSP EVOO until tender and then added broth (plus a little extra though did use less than six cups) and chopped asparagus. Simmered until tender and then blended. I didn't end up adding the woody ends or cutting the tips to use as a garnish. I topped it with pecorino romano. FABULOUS!

This soup was perfect. Didn't have creme Fraiche, so I added one cup of Cream, and one cup of Sour Cream. I also added 4 cloves of garlic, salt, pepper, and 2 tsp. of curry powder. Couldn't taste the curry, but it gave it depth of flavor. Tasted exactly like a very expensive restaurant version. With Swanson's canned chicken broth, this recipe made a fantastic soup in less than 20 minutes. (Used a hand-held, stick mixer in the pot)

I'm sure it's delicious and healthy as is but I skipped the butter (substituted a tsp of olive oil to sautee the veggies) and used FF half and half (Farmland Dairies) instead of cream or creme fraiche . It was terrific!

This is really simple and delicious. In an attempt to give this recipe a healthy alteration, I used reduced fat sour cream in place of the creme fraiche. It was amazing! Still very creamy any rich tasting without that "heavy" feeling afterward. I added a very small boiled potato, garlic, and salt and pepper. I think the lemon is really great and should not be skipped. So f-ing good.

This is really easy and really good. I skipped the butter and boiled the stems in some of the broth to intensify the flavor - GREAT IDEA! I put a blob of plain Greek yoghurt on top of each bowl instead of adding cream. I did include a little fresh garlic but didn't think it was necessary - what the soup desperately needed was a little salt (ocean, or kosher, or something) and a bunch of gound black pepper, added at the beginning of cooking. But we loved it and will have it again and again.

Delicious. The only thing I would do next time to tweak the recipe is to strain the finished soup through a mesh strainer to remove the woody bits. Also, I found it easier to use an electric blending rod to mash the asparagus into the broth.

So simple, so quick, so good. I used cream but would probably use creme fraiche next time. The consistency was perfect without additional broth.

What to do w/ 2 pounds of asparagus from my CSA and 2 kids who don't like it? Make soup of course! I took the advice of other reviewers who suggested simmering the store bought boxed broth with the ends of the asparagus. I also added a sprig of fresh thyme. Also, from previous reviewers, I added 4 cloves of garlic roughly chopped, to the onions. I substituted olive oil for the butter (and vegans take note! If you add a potato, see below, this is a great recipe for you!) To make the soup thick and creamy without actual cream peel and chop a Yukon Gold Potato and add that to the mixture when you put in the broth. While I was cooking, I opened a yummy bottle of Chardonnay and added a generous dollop of that as well. To satisfy vegan and calorie counting friends I saved the sour cream for a garnish ( I also skipped the step of making the tips for garnish, though I am sure it is lovely). The soup is thick and rich without, but sublime with the sour cream. Enjoy! My non-asparagus loving kids did.

P.S....I also added 4 cloves of garlic to the soup.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for about a year. I received a Vita Mix mixer for my birthday, and seeing how wonderfully smooth and creamy it mixes everything up, I decided it was time to make this recipe. Asparagus are in season right now, so I bought some from the Farmer's Market this past weekend. I made my own chicken stock by simmering the bones and skin from a Costco roasted chicken, along with a large onion, 2 stalks of celery, a large carrot, and about 2 TBSP peppercorns for about 3 hours. After straining, I used about 4 cups of this, along with about 1 cup organic chicken broth. I bought the thinnest asparagus I could find,took off the tops, and used the whole asparagus in the soup. I read many of the reviews, and decided to use 2 Tbsp. sour creme and 1/4 C. half and half instead of the creme fraiche. I also omitted the last Tbsp of butter, since using my own stock gave the soup so much flavor. This soup was simply amazing! I made it ahead of time, but had to eat it immediately because it was so incredible. Having a Vita Mix blender made the soup so light and frothy. I will definitely make this again, especially for company.

I followed suggestions to: 1) boil woody ends in some of the broth, 2) add garlic and shallot w/the onions and 3) a small boiled potato for thickening. I used Creme Fraiche - my preference.

Case in point, Epicurious has featured a Strawberry Jam recipe in this week's breakfast recipes. It has two reviews, and neither of them have made the recipe. What's going on??? It was a great recipe. And at the end I did add my own goodies, some wild mushrooms, pink pepperberries and fresh tarragon. Made it five forks.

Absolutely fantastic soup! I had some left-over asparagus and half a baked potato, and with the addition of 2C of home-made stock and some crème fraiche we had a lovely lunch in no time. I forgot to add the lemon juice and extra butter, but then I don't think it needed it. I also had some chives in the fridge and scattered some of those over the top to finish.

I think is a good recipe however I only gave it three forks because I think it needed a little spicing up! I prefer my cream soups to be thicker, so I only used about 4 1/2 cups of the broth. I also sauteed to garlic cloves and two small shallots with the onion (I used a small yellow onion). Also after reading some of the other reviews, I also added a small boiled potato to help thicken up the sauce and I boiled the woody ends of the asparagus in the chicken broth for about 20 minutes to get all that asparagus flavor. After removing the woody ends, I added that broth to the rest of the ingredients and also mixed in some grated parmesan cheese. Excellent flavor!

Great asparagus soup recipe! I used no butter (olive oil instead of butter for the saute and did not add the 1 Tbsp called for at the end), added 1 clove garlic and 1 stalk celery to the onions and substituted about 1/4 cup sour cream for the creme fraiche/heavey cream. For those of you who are vegan, just leave out the cream altogether it is still terrific.

I added a minced garlic clove along with onion and gently caramelized both, deglazing with a bit of dry white wine. Added the broth and chopped asparagus and simmered until just tender, then put in my blender.

Really excellent soup, but I modified it after reading several of the reviews to ensure (1) creamier and thicker, and (2) plenty of asparagus flavor. Thanks to previous reviewers from whom these ideas were taken. Modified as follows: Simmered woody asparagus ends in approx 3cups chicken broth for 30 mins, and strained, before adding the broth (and add'l 2 cups broth) to soup per recipe. Add sliced garlic clove and thinly sliced stalk of celery to onions. Use sour cream and heavy whipping cream in place of creme fraiche, and added significantly more of both (esp heavy cream) to make it thicker and creamier.

I was not pleased with the way my soup turned out. This is the first time I have ever made soup. I used a blender and then finished in the pot with a handheld immersion blender because I found my regular blender left bits. I liked the consistency of the soup~it was the taste... a little lacking in flavor. Perhaps it is because asparagus is out of season? Also, I did not have shallots and so used only the leek. I also used light cream (5%MF instead of 35) but I do not think this was the problem b/c I use the light cream in all my cream recipes and have never been disappointed. My husband suggested mint as a flavoring but I think I would like to try cardamom. I might try the recipe again, with all of the proper ingredients and see if it makes a difference to the flavor... I quite like the idea of creme d'asperges...

This soup is UNBELIEVABLE! When making for family (rather than company) I skip the fancy steps. I just saute the onion, add the whole asparagus and simmer.

I was doubtful, because the amount of cream seemed light, but this relatively simple recipe totally rocked. I only had four cups of chicken broth, so I added half a cube of Edward & Sons Natural Vegan Chicken Bouillon. I planned to add an extra cup of water to go with the bullion, but the soup seemed thin enough without it. Also, I threw in an extra tablespoon of butter at the end (I was at the end of the cube anyway). And I used a LOT of freshly ground black pepper.

I tried to make an asparagus soup like one we just had in Paris and this did not copy it. Next time I will use much less chicken broth, just enough to cook the asparagus. After pureeing, I will use more cream to get it to the consistency I like. This should help to sweeten it a bit and thicken it without the thickeners some others have recommended. Also will dribble on some olive oil just before serving.

Very tasty and easy to make. Only had a small onion so added some shallots, used equal parts half and half and sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and included a 3 very small red potatoes for texture. A little thin for my liking, but a great recipe nonetheless. Will definitely make it again, but maybe reduce broth.

Wow, what a great soup! Got raves from two kids and four adults. I think the recipe is too thin, as is (although still four forks). I used a mix of corn and potato starch...about three tablespoons and it was perfect for our taste. (It floated the garnish with no problem.) There was only one third cup Creme' Fraiche available so I added about a half cup more of sour cream. Also forgot the lemon. Frankly, the soup we wound up with was better than four forks! We will, no doubt, have this every time asparagus is in season.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this as an appetizer for Easter dinner. This could be served as a weekday meal (accompanied with fresh baguette!). I simmered the broth with the woody ends of the asparagus first to enhance the asparagus flavour. Made this in advance - refrigerate after the pureering stage (before adding the creme fraiche).

I have been making this soup since it came out in the magazine. I have made some minor changes in it that I think enhance the intensity of the asparagus flavor, but admittedly, are a little more work. I use the entire asparagus spear without regard to the woody parts, then after blending, I put it through a fine-mesh sieve. The result is a silky, intensely flavored asparagus soup. I have made it for family gatherings and social gatherings and it's always earned praise. A bonus is that it's healthy and delicious!

I must say - delicious! I love cream soups and had always wanted to try making asparagus (this week they were on sale and decided to go for it). I took the advice of another reviewer of adding one potato to the soup for thickness - very good. When serving it, i didn't care for the tips of the asparagus as garnish, they all sank, so next time i'll do chives as in the pic for a pretty look. In honoring my mom's tradition, i serve creams with thin slices of mozzarella cheese while it's very hot so they melt beautifully and crisp slices of freshly baked french bread on the side. My 2 toddlers loved it! The 3 yr old said" Mommy, this soup is very yummy w/ bread" The 4 yr. old said" Mommy, so yummy, yummy, yummy" while pounding her little fists on the table with excitement. Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this relatively easy version of a classic soup. Used 1/4 each of half-n-half & creme fraiche and cut back on the overall quantity of asparagus to about 1-3/4 lbs. Really very delicious -- especially with that last bit of lemon. See my write up with photos at Sass & Veracity.

Outstanding recipe! I made this for 6 dinner guests and received rave reviews! With a few asparagus tips and 3 ringed slices of hard boiled egg, the presentation was awesome. Just a precaution: be careful you don't use the woody parts (at least not in the blended soup portion). Gently press your blade to the stalk to test it. If it's hard, it's wood... Wood...wood... wood... good. Start cutting there. Now there's nothing wrong with using the woody parts to cook for the flavor. But if you try to blend that woody stuff for soup, it'll be like eating fish bones. I will definitely make this again!

I made this soup for a St. Patrick's day celebration and substituted yogurt for the creme fresh/cream. We all enjoyed it very much and it got good reviews from the table. I could have used a bit less stock, as we like our soup thicker than this recipe turns out. I'll definitely be making this again,especially for company. It was very convenient to prepare it ahead of time and just heat it up and add the lemon, yogurt and garnish at the last minute.

This was delicious. Just what I was looking for. The essence of asparagus! I had no trouble getting the asparagus blended but I have a one speed awesome blender. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. Next time I'll try the suggestion of adding the potatoes for a thicker soup. Agreed with other reviews that this would be a lovely cold soup and perfect for an Easter Brunch. I made parmesan cheese crisps as a topping.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe! Yum. I read all in database and balked at adding tarragon, dill, etc. Asparagus speaks for itself. There are a few things that will help you max that asparagus flavor: 1) Snap each stalk where it wants to break naturally- standard procedure. 2) Use your mound of 'garbage' ends for something other than landfill or a future project. (Trim the ends if you want.) Drop the woody ends into the chicken broth, simmer 30 mins, cool, blend, strain, press every last drop of juice out of the cellulose. NOW you have some starter broth! Be sure to chop the remaining stalks into 1/2" to 1/4 inch pieces. The smaller, the more pleasant the strings. Without some cellulose you have a tasty broth, not asparagus soup. If you want to save *every* last bit of asparagus flavor, lower the garnish tips, in a small collander or strainer, into the just finished simmering soup. Cover until tender/crunchy and rinse in cool water. Why waste the steaming water? You don't have to do any of that except the natural break and the 1/4 to 1/2 inch chop. But every bit counts toward an VERY intense flavor. Remember, overcooking asparagus is a crime. Good chilled as well.

This recipe is awesome and proves that simplicity showcases the brightness of seasonal vegetables. Given the time of year, I wanted to make something low calorie/ low fat that is filling and nutrient dense. I omitted the heavy cream - sorry cream, you taste heavenly, but I'd rather look good in a bikini than eat you - and added silken tofu to the puree - it sounds weird, but it makes it taste creamy and adds protein. Plus I added a 2 tbsp parmesan cheese. Lip smacking good.

I will consider adding a potato or two next time to thicken the soup for a main course, but also delicious as is. Yum!

We both really liked this recipe. I probably doubled the lemon rather than halving it though, and I will do the same next time. Serve it with home made garlic croutons on top. Will try half & half next time to cut down on some of the calories/fat. Without any bread or croutons this is a good low carb soup.

This soup is always in demand at our house in asparagus season. Delicious and easy to make. Enjoy!

My favorite soup to make. I use a little over 2 lbs of asparagus. I break off the woody stems and simmer in separate saucepan with 1 can of chicken broth and use the remaining broth with the asparagus/onion mix. It concentrates the flavor of the asparagus in the broth. Before pureeing in blender, I discard the stems and add its broth to the other pot. I make it a low fat and Weight Watcher friendly soup by just using the 2 tbsp of butter for the onions, and don't add any creme fraiche or extra butter at the end. I've also substituted broccoli.

This is excellent soup. I've made it twice now. I sort of halved the recipe yesterday because I didn't have enough leftover asparagus from previous night's dinner. I also use light sour cream because it's always in the fridge. Didn't have a lemon but squeezed a little bit of lime. Also grated & sprinkled some parmesan on top. So very, very good. My husband raves about this soup. It's always a guaranteed hit.

no creme fraiche here used soucream, seems my asparagus is too wimpy as hoped for a bit more color - next time I will add more asparagus to the blend. Great taste, didn't need extra stock also from using sour cream? the extra asparagus I hope thickens it a bit more too or I will add some potatoe maybe.. any way still 4 forks, my lack of right ingredients doesn't lower my rating.:)

Wow! This is my new favorite "green" soup. I did caramalize the onions which made the soup slightly brown, however, really deepened the flavor. Used sour cream and the juice of a whole lemon (we like the tang.) I will be making this soup often., So easy too.

Excellent recipe, especially with fresh-cut baby asparagus. The spears I used weren't woody, so there was need to strain. Subbed light sour cream for heavy cream to add tang and reduce fat, and a little thyme and cayenne as many recommended. My new go-to recipe for cream of asparagus soup.

This was simple and delicious. I used fresh white asparagus, which is grown here in southern Germany, 1 cup of heavy cream, and a teaspoon of nutmeg instead of lemon. Even my two year old was licking the bowl!!!

This was a fantastic soup, although I used the entire stalk of asparagus, which was a bad idea. The ends were tough and stringy, and did not soften after cooking. The result was a delicious puree with fibrous pieces of stalk in every spoonful- I will only use the most tender part of the asparagus next time!

Rating: 4
The other reviewers are not kidding...this is an excellent soup!! As suggested, I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and leeks rather than onion. I also added some grated garden carrots (about 1/3 cup) to give the soup more body and flavor. It was one of the best soups I have ever had!

Rating: 4
This was a really simple and delicious soup. I added celery and garlic to recipe (cooked them with the onions). I also added a small pinch of dried thyme leaves, white pepper and a bay leaf. I blended it with a stick blender, strained it, and finished with the cream. Since I'm from Baltimore I could not resist adding crabmeat when I added the cream and ate the soup with homemade 'oldbay' croutons! I guess I did change the recipe a lot, but it was a great place to start and ended with a great meal.

Rating: 4
Living near an asparagus farm, I have access to inexpensive "seconds " - too crooked, long, thick, thin... I followed NYC's tip and used lots of woody ends to enrich the homemade chicken broth. Because of the over-abundance of asparagus in a short season, I make several batches and freeze them, minus the cream and lemon. I add a few stalks of imported asparagus at cooking time for texture and visuals. A wonderful hit of spring in the dead of winter! Easy for hubby to prepare for dinner or lunch. Definitely a restaurant quality soup!

I love this soup. It is so easy and delicious. I sub fat free half and half for the cream and it doesn't need the last pat of butter. I also use a stick blender directly in the pot and it works well.

Rating: 4
This is a nice recipe that brings out the essence of in-season ingredients. However, one serving has over 22g of fat. I lightened it by omitting the butter altogether and using an olive oil cooking spray to saute the onion. I also added the asparagus after the onion was softened as well as 1 tsp chopped fresh thyme and sauteed all together until the asparagus began to soften. Instead of the cream, I used fat-free sour cream. These changes reduced the fat to only 2g and calories from 226 to 96 per serving. I agree with other posters who believe that leeks would make this even better. I also sauteed the tips with a little salt and pepper, which added color and retained crispness. Lovely soup.

Just finished making this soup and it's absolutely delicious! I took many tips from the reviewers (thanks!)Used leeks for onions, added thyme, and roasted the asparagus tips in olive oil. My addition - I added sea salt to taste.

Definitely a delicious recipe. we made some changes; made a vegetarian stock which included leftover asparagus stems as well as green garlic in addition to usual stock basics. Also reduced added liquid by half which made for a thicker final soup. Instead of boiling tips of asparagus, we coated them lightly in olive oil and briefly baked in top rack of oven until lightly crisped and browned - way better then soggy boiling! The final addition of butter included some fresh chopped thyme leaves which was mellted prior to whisking. we garnished with fresh snipped chives and some plucked chive blossoms. All in all a delicious seasonal springtime soup.

Yumm. Made exactly like the recipe said except I used a stick blender right in the pot and it was delicious. I did try straining the soup but ultimately tossed it all back together as the strained soup was way to thin. Finally I used some extra creme fraiche to garnish the soup with a quick swirl before adding the tips.

Tastes great, perfect for us during wild asparagus season when we have an abundance and need to eat it before it goes bad. The only recomendation I have is either to run the soup through a strainer before going back into the pan, or discard the bottom parts of the stems during the first part. The stems, even when cooked and blended can yield undesireable, inedible hard pieces. The strainer or discarding the bottoms of the stems would help in this. Other than that, it is a simple, yet perfect recipe.

I've made this twice. I love asparagus soup and have used many different recipes. This is by far my favorite. I use fat free sour cream or fat free Greek yogurt - tastes great and makes the soup very low-cal

Rating: 3
This was delicious. It needed quite a lot of salt (1.5 Tbsp), maybe because I used low sodium broth. I strongly recommend straining it even though it is tedious; the improvement in texture is dramatic. I also strongly recommend creme fraiche over heavy cream because the tanginess really enhances the flavour. You could even use greek yogurt to get the tanginess but with less fat; I am going to try that next time. You'll notice the picture is garnished with chives, not asparagus tips :-) I used chives and tarragon which was good.

Don't you just love Epicurious!!!! we just had this using leftover asparagus ends, the tips were used two days ago to make triple- decker toasted sandwiches, involving pan- grilled asparagus only long enuf for the bread, overlayed with cheese, melted, and bacon for other triple layer. Now using the other parts of the stalks, I have no changes to this soup recipe, it is totally perfect, and we are not easy to please when it comes to cream soups...so I appreciate this site that much more, just ask for the best rated recipe and voila!!!! I also found a Pistou recipe on this site, and added 1 tsp. of that to a bowl of this, always adds a punch (grated Parm, crushed garlic and pesto, olive oil) .

I used a handblender and found that there was no need to strain. Like others I retained some of the asparagus tips. Added a cup of leftover cauliflower to the asparagus which made a nice touch.

This soup is so simple and tasty. Sometimes you don't need to have such a strong soup. It just depends on the menu. For me this is the perfect 'créme' soup -- with the slight variation that I strained it, just because we don't like fibrous soups. Other than that it was fantastic.

Delicious soup. Made this twice: First time I tried roasting fresh asparagus but there wasn't enough flavor for the extra effort so the 2nd time I used both fresh and a box of frozen ($5.99lb compared to $3.50 for boxed frozen!) and it had more depth of flavor. Also strained for a more smooth and less fiberous soup. Added lemon the second time and it it was better because it brightened the flavor.

Loved it the first time but I thought it a little bland. Maybe it's living in the Southwest that leaves one craving a little kick on the palate. Following the original recipe, to the pot I added a little minced garlic and two stocks of chopped celery to saute along with the onions. Then I added a few good shakes each of Jane's Krazy Salt, cumin and cayenne pepper. Wow! It's really awesome now with just the little kick it needed for me!

I just finished enjoying this super-simple and delicious soup. I used the exact ingredients called for except I sauteed the onion in olive oil rather then butter. (I did add the last tablespoon of butter into the soup at the end.) Also, I heeded recommendations and and added the cut asparagus ends into the broth (I used my homemade) for added flavor. I live with an ex-caterer and another really, really good cook and they were both impressed that I churned out a very, very good soup in such a short time. The lemon really brightened up the flavor. Now that I know how good this is as-is, I'll have a great time experimenting. Try this- it is very well worth an hour of your time.

Simply outstanding! I didn't add anything extra but I did cook the asparagus ends and tips in the chicken broth before throwing the ends away and using the tips as garnish. The "liquify" setting on my blender made the soup plenty smooth without having to strain it. I would highly recommend this recipe!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. Yum. I read all in database and balked at adding tarragon, dill, etc. Asparagus speaks for itself. One small step to max that asparagus flavor: 1) Snap each stalk where it wants to break naturally (standard procedure). 2) Use your mound of 'garbage' ends for something other than landfill or a future project. Drop the woody ends into the chicken broth, simmer 30 mins, cool, blend, strain, press every last drop of juice out of the cellulose. NOW you have some starter broth! Remember, overcooking asparagus is a crime. Good chilled as well.

Good recipe. I used all of the butter to cook the onions and added a bit of extra cream in the end (without lemon juice). I HIGHLY recommend adding fresh tarragon before cooking has finished.

I had this soup in Ireland last year and had white truffle oil-- it was the best cream of asparagus I'd ever had! I'd been looking for a good recipe for ages to duplicate it and this one is the same. I added truffle oil and it was as good as I remembered it! I suggest if you use the truffle oil to omit the lemon. When I serve, I drizzle a bit of the oil in the center of the bowl as well.

It's very strange to me that I didn't like this recipe. This is my standard recipe for almost any kind of cream vegetable soup, yet, this time, I really just didn't care for it. I served it at Easter, and everyone said they really enjoyed it. Maybe it was me... maybe they were being nice....

My husband's favorite soup is Cream of Asparagus. I can't tell you how many recipes I've tried, and he said that all of them were only "OK". When I found this recipe, I thought that it was way too simple to be good. But when it got the enthusiastic thumbs-up from my husband, I knew it was a keeper. Its simplicity is exactly what makes it the best recipe I've made. If you have fresh ingredients, you can't go wrong. Love it!

This is a springtime staple in my home and one of my most requested recipes. I've tried a few of the modifications other reviewers have suggested, but honestly think the original recipe is the best - just pure, fresh asparagus flavor. The soup is only as good as the asparagus you use, so use the freshest and toss the woody parts. I agree with other reviewers that this is better (smoother) in a blender than using a stick blender.

The first time I made this soup I had some "old" asparagus in the fridge which was no longer fit to be served "as is". I found this recipe on my favourite web site (Epicurious.com) and decided that I had nothing to lose. The soup was excellent! I am planning to make it for a dinner party this weekend but with fresh spring asparagus this time and I'm sure to reave reviews.

I've made this several times now, just wanted to comment. I make the changes/additions suggested by the cook in NY regarding cooking the tips/ends. I also always use turkey stock that I make after Thanksgiving and freeze. I serve with grated cheese (usually fontina, but sometimes cheddar) and french bread. This soup is wondeful and easy, and one of my favorite recipes to make.

After making this soup over 20 times, and getting just as many requests for the recipe plus 100 times the "mmmmm's!" I felt the need to recommend it officially. It is SO easy, SO delicious, SO beautiful...you can't go wrong with the recipe as it is. The only warnings I have is if you use weird asparagus or vegetable broth...both times I've tried compromising with asparagus that isn't totally green or with vegetable broth it's turned out not as good...not terrible, but not as good. You can also skip the blender part and just use a hand mixer to blend the cooked asparagus--makes the recipe that much easier plus you will only use one pot! I'm craving it right now!

This soup is simple and delicious! My company said it was 'gourmet quality'. I made it a day in advance and just heated it on the stove and added the butter pat and lemon juice just before serving. My asparagus tips did not float but I used shallow soup bowls and criss-crossed enough tips so that top ones were above 'soup level' in the center of the bowl. Dash of nutmeg finished it nicely. Would make again, and again.

I hardly ever give anything four forks, but this soup was just sublime. I couldn't bear to part with any of the asparagus tips, so I reserved them all for garnish (ok-it was a little overgarnished). Took off the bottoms of the asparagus at the natural break, and used a standing blender for a really smooth puree. The lemon wakes it up and gives it a nice lift. A very pretty green color, if you don't overcook the asparagus! Good, good good.

Stupendous, light, delicious! I just cut 11/2 inches off the end of my bunch of asparagus, put the rest into a pot with veal broth and 2 chicken buillion cubes while the onions fried. Put everything (plus the creme fraiche) into a blender in batches. Done in 20 minutes.

Lacked quality asparus flavor. Willing to assume that the aparagus was not that great and that was the problem. Enjoyed reheating and eating later more than I enjoyed on the initial night. The asparagus I used was very thick, choose your well. Probably much better in spring when I have fresh asparagus of my own. Also I would use a medium onion next time.

Marvelous, just marvelous. My husband wanted to help with Xmas Eve dinner and so made this. It was so awesome he made it again for New Year's Eve for 12 (with 7 1/2 pounds of asparagus!). We didn't do the garnish part, but did follow the excellent tip on breaking off the tough ends and simmering in broth before tossing out. Didn't strain anything and used an immersion blender. Make sure to NOT put in all the broth at once. It was the right consistency with less than all the broth. Everyone loved it and the leftovers were just as delicious. While the prep work may take a bit of time (especially with 7 1/2 lbs of asp.) it is an easy and fabulous recipe.

I've made this twice now, both times with great success! Once I pureed much finer, and I think that you end up with a much nicer cream soup without chunks or fibers. The other cook's suggestion to strain sounds like a good idea. Also, once I had to substitute bottled lemon juice for fresh, and while it was still tasty, the soup with fresh lemon was head and shoulders above the other.

This was another fantastic soup recipe on your website. The flavor was delish! The only problem was the fibers from the stalks of asparagus. I broke the stems by hand as I always do with asparagus.

After having a delicious cream of asparagus soup at a local restaurant I was inspired to search for a recipe and came across this one. It is wonderful! I made it as directed, although I strained the soup and re-processed the pulp to make it finer. I didn't discard it as I was afraid it would make the soup too thin as I like the thicker texture. I was not disappointed! I made a double batch and had leftovers for visiting family who raved about it. Served it with the butter and a dash of cayenne.

Heed the cook from Vancouver BC as to the preparation of the asparagus. Use large spears not tiny ones. The size of the asparagus reflects the maturity of the asparagus field- not the age of the stalk. A wonderful flavorful soup hot or cold. If you think the soup is too rich, substitute buttermilk for the cream. I've done this several times and still get rave reviews.

I made the following 2 simple changes and the soup was light, delicious, and a hit! 1.) I added 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the onion 2.)After puree, I strained the soup so only the broth came through. Saved the pulp for babyfood! Simple and easy recipe that tastes like you spend hours.

This is a great soup! My roommate and I couldn't stop eating it, and the soup was gone before we could have leftovers the next night. I followed the recipe exactly but added the nutmeg someone else recommended, which was a very nice touch. The only complaint I had was that it was incredibly rich. As a first course, I'd leave it as is; but use a little over half the recommended amount of heavy cream if you're going to be eating a lot of it.

Rating: 4
Best asparagus soup recipe I've tried -- so easy, quick, and adaptable! Slicing the asparagus very thin (1/4" or less), as suggested, is a must: the asparagus becomes tender more quickly and is ready to puree before it has lost any of its brilliant color. I start out with less stock to make a thicker soup, use an immersion blender to puree the mixture right in the pot, and add more stock (or water) if needed. I rarely remember to make or buy creme fraiche; instead, I use a mixture of 75% heavy cream blended with 25% sour cream. (Sour cream can curdle, so you have to temper the heavy cream/sour cream mixture by gradually adding some hot soup to it, then pouring/stirring that mixture back into the rest of the hot soup.) I've also used fresh lime juice when there were no lemons around, and that works fine, too.

Rating: 4
I've been making this for several years, and love it with modifications I've made. I don't trim the asparagus at all--just wash it well and use. After simmering, puree it in a blender, and sieve; this is a must to remove the tough fibers. You end up with a silky, intensely-flavored soup, but at the same time being very delicate. We made 2.5 times the recipe tonight, so we have plenty for the freezer.

I followed other review's advice and used 3 lb. of asparagus. I also split the discarded stalks, boiled them in the chicken stock of about 45 minutes then strained the stock for more intense asparagus flavor. Finally, added fresh nutmeg just before serving. The results were fabulous. One guest was found in the kitchen after desert having a second serving and then asked to take some home for lunch.

Don't often give 4 forks. This was obviously easy and extremely tasty. Absolutely restaurant quality. Just a couple changes: I wanted more "asparagus punch" so went back and cooked up another 1/2 onion, 1 lb. asparagus and 2 c. broth then pureed this and added it to the original recipe. I also took another reviewer's advice and added nutmeg - great idea!! This was wonderful. For the extra "asparagus punch" without the extra work maybe next time I will add less cream and less lemon juice.

My family happens to adore cream of asparagus soup and I've used many different recipes. We lived in Germany for several years and became accustomed to white asparagus which I really prefer.

I will certainly make this one again.

Very very tasty, and the first time I made it (accidentally) with about 1/2 the asparagus called for. Boiled the ends in water for 15 mintutes, then strained and added a bouillon cube instead of broth. Asparagus can be replaced with carrots (add a bit of dill at the end) and it is also delicious, a very solid recipe.

I loved this recipe. As a vegetarian, I swapped out veggie broth, but otherwise followed the directions verbatim. It was perfect with no embellishments or changes!

The soup was very tastey. I think this makes too much broth. I only used 1/2 of the broth when I pureed the soup. Froze the rest of the asparagus broth. Followed a previous review & boiled the tips in the soup, instead of another pan of water. Also used 4 more spears than what was called for. Finished the soup w/some goat cheese crumbles & diced up sauted ham. Was a very nice soup for a cold winter night.

I had this soup a a freind's home for Thanksgiving and within the week had to make it at home. I made it to freeze. It froze well and still tasted great when thawed.

This is a great soup! Thicken the soup and it also makes a delicious vegetable dip.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it. I did end up with a little too much liquid, so I didn't use it all when pureeing. I think you need to use 2 pounds of asparagus after breaking off the ends, otherwise it is not enough asparagus for the broth. But it came out excellent. Would highly recommend.

This soup was just what I was hoping for in an asparagus soup. I followed NY's tips for making a more flavorful broth and I think it really helped. It also was a good use for the ends. I didn't have enough aspargus but luckily I made this in the morning of my dinner so I could get more aspargus which cooked and blended in. I served these with Parmesan custards from another asparagus soup recipe at this site. Beautiful and yummy.

Extremely easy, extremely tasty. I loved it!! I did not try any of the tips other tasters tried, but did add a small shredding of gruyere to the top(very small, as gruyere is sooo strong). Next time I will try boiling the ends in the broth, seems so sad to let them goto waste:( I will most certainly make this again.

Thanks to New York, this turned out spectacular! A delicious and decidedly different green soup that looks lovely and tastes "complex" due to the unfolding flavour ofthe asparagus.

PRETTY DARNED NICE, TRY ADDING A BIT OF BRIE (NO RIND PLEASE)FOR A TASTY CHANGE, JUST MELTED IN WITH THE CREAM PRODUCT OF CHOICE. NO CREME FRAICHE AVAILABLE, MAKE DO A BIT OF SUPER HEAVY CREAM OR SOUR CREAM INSTEAD. LIVE IN MAJOR ASPARAGUS GROWING REGION HAVE LOTS TO EXPRIMENT WITH. AGREE WITH MAKING BROTH FROM ENDS AND STRAINING,WATCH THE SALT IN THE PREMADE CHICKEN BROTH TOO. REALLY LIKE THIS MADE WITH SHALLOTS, AND A BIT OF WINE. TRIED WITH A TINY SPRINKLE OF NUTMEG AND TINY SPRINKLE OF CHIVES ALSO FOR A DIFFERENT TWIST. THE RECIPE PRODUCES A GOOD SOUP THAT STANDS UP TO LOTS OF GREAT IDEAS. ALSO TO THE READER WHO THOUGHT BLAND-MAYBE ASPARAGUS WAS SHIPPED FROM WAY TOO FAR-LIKE FROM CHILE AND HAS LOST IT'S FLAVOR. ANYWAY, TRY IT AND ENJOY.

This was absolutely divine! Thanks to the 'cook from NYC' for the tip about using the woody ends to maximize the asparagus essence and flavor! I think it was worth the small extra effort. I topped off the soup with a little dollop of very good sour cream.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe! Yum. I read all in database and balked at adding tarragon, dill, etc. Asparagus speaks for itself. There are a few things that will help you max that asparagus flavor: 1) Snap each stalk where it wants to break naturally (standard procedure). 2) Use your mound of 'garbage' ends for something other than landfill or a future project. (Trim the ends if you want.) Drop the woody ends into the chicken broth, simmer 30 mins, cool, blend, strain, press every last drop of juice out of the cellulose. NOW you have some starter broth! Be sure to chop the remaining stalks into 1/2" to 1/4 inch pieces. The smaller, the more pleasant the strings. Without some cellulose you have a tasty broth, not asparagus soup. If you want to save *every* last bit of asparagus flavor, lower the garnish tips, in a small collander or strainer, into the just finished simmering soup. Cover until tender/crunchy and rinse in cool water. Why waste the steaming water? You don't have to do any of that except the natural break and the 1/4 to 1/2 inch chop. But every bit counts toward an VERY intense flavor. Remember, overcooking asparagus is a crime. Good chilled as well.

Excellent recipe! An interesting juxtaposition of rich creamy taste and a fresh spring vegetable. Some reviewers suggested straining the soup - I think straining leaves the soup a little "gutless". I added back some of the stuff which was strained out to give the soup more structure. Leeks and tarragon were an excellent idea though. My wife isn't a "soup" person and ended up stealing some of mine.

Rating: 4
This was so delicious although I did make a few minor changes - used leek instead of onion and added fresh tarragon and a bit of cayenne pepper. Used a hand held blender and the texture was perfect. Important to use fresh, tender asparagus for the best results. Try it - you'll like it!

Rating: 3
I wish I had scrolled down and read ALL of the reviews as I would have avoided a major mistake - the strings from the asparagus stalks. The soup had a delicate balance but we faced the strings because I did not strain it nor did I allow the natural break of the asparagus as the reviewer from British Columbia had suggested. I cut off the bottoms as suggested in the recipe. Even those in our family that do not like asparagus enjoyed this one. Watch the salt in the beginning if you are using canned chicken broth because it could turn out dangerously close to salty. Will definately make it again but have learned a valuable lesson to read ALL of the reviews.

So simple and fresh. I like making it for company since it reheats well and I can do almost everything in advance. Elegant presentation. I agree with other reviewers, the soup will only be as good as the asparagus you use.

This soup is awesome and easy. I did not have the heavy cream and I used plain Yogurt instead. It blended well and gave the soup a bit of a tang. I used some of my own green onions (the white part only) and I added a bit of my own parsley in the end. I also had the luxury of picking my own asparagus for this dish. YUMMY!!!

The best asparagus cream I ever had!!!Very delicate but flavorful.

Superlative! My husband and son raved and ate every drop. As far as fibres go, strain the soup through a colander or a sieve and the soup will be silky smooth. I added just a touch of nutmeg after adding the creme (used 1/2 and 1/2 instead). Like the BC reviewer, I used a stick blender in the pot -- much easier and less dangerous. The end result was delicious and satisfying, but not heavy!

Delicious. I have made this dish a few times. I made the mistake of using milk once instead of the heavy cream (did not have any.) Cannot compare the difference in flavor.

Very tasty and easy to make. Definitely let the soup cool (I put it in a bowl in the freezer for about 1/2 hour) before pureeing in the blender.

Peel the asparagus stalks about half way up and you will get rid of the stringy,tough ends.

Rating: 3
Simply a lovely soup! Perfect starter for a spring dinner party. Can only be as good as the asparagus used - should be as fresh as possible. To the cook who found it bland and flavorless, perhaps her asparagus was old. Also, to avoid stringy fibres, DO NOT cut the ends - instead bend each stalk and it will automatically snap above the woody section at the end of the stalk. It may seem wasteful, but is not as the woody ends are inedible due to the tough fibres. I save these ends and toss them in the pot when making vegetable broth so they don't go to waste. Even thin pencil asparagus has woody ends.

Very disappointed with this recipe. I followed it exactly as written. If I was blindfolded and given this soup to taste I would not be able to tell you what type of vegetable cream soup it was. Subtle flavours are one thing but this soup had NO flavour.

I liked this recipe, but I did substitute 6oz "fat-free half & half" for the 4oz of heavy cream. I dropped a dollop of fat-free yogurt in the middle of each bowl for presentation and to add at least the additional impression of creaminess. This turned out great by the way... The soup tasted creamy but had a light consistency.

Everyone loved this soup! Toward the end of cooking the onions, I added a splash of red wine and dash of cumin, and let it simmer in for a few minutes, then added the asparagus. Also, I reserved about a cup of asparagus cut small and after I blended the rest, added the small pieces and used regular whipping cream.

Rating: 4
This soup was fantastic! But because of our ridiculous metric system, I mistakenly only used half the asparagus. Result was still fabulous, but as an asparagus lover, I shan't be making that mistake again. As an aside, can some nice person please email me with a definition of "half and half". Thank you.

I brought in a big bunch of fresh asparagus from the garden and needed a quick, easy recipe to showcase their flavor. Even though I had to pilfer half-n-half instead of cream, the recipe turned out a wonderful soup. Nothing fancy, just a wollop of great asparagus flavor. It's a do-over in our house.

Condensed milk???? Do you not know that is sweetened? What a weird substitution, can't imagine how that altered this good recipe!!

I rarely cook, and have never made soup from scratch in my life. This recipe was increadibly easy and delicious! Honestly, I cheated on the ingredients--low sodium buillion cubes instead of chicken broth, condensed milk instead of cream. It still was fantastic (although I'm sure it would be better with the original ingredients). The lemon juice is key--it cuts the taste of onion, so that it's not overbearing. A definite must-try!

Tasty Tasty Tasty! Such rich asparagus flavor. I brought this to a potluck and everyone enjoyed it. It was very simple & quick to prepare. I found I liked the consistacy and did not add any additional stock at the end. Next time I might try using milk and some sour cream to cut down the fat from the cream. My bet is it would still be delicious.

This is a great soup. I had frozen leftover steamed asparagus and made the recipe. Because I was using the leftovers I didn't save the tips but it came out delicious -just the perfect balance of fresh asparagus, onion and dairy.

This soup is AWSOME, and it came out great the first time I tried making it. In fact it was the first soup I've ever made from scratch. My dinner guests finished every drop of it. Just a few tips: I don't think the soup requires much salt beyond what is already present in the stock. Cut the ends off the asparagus too. Be careful when you blend it, the steam may force the lid off the blender.

I've tried other asparagus soup recipes & this one is by far the best I've found. It's too easy & too yummy to not make all of the time & since I've found this recipe (1.5 weeks ago) I've made it twice. I love it!

This soup was wonderful, and so easy to make! I used only 5 cups of chicken broth, and the consistency seemed just right. I also used only 1/8 cup of lemon juice to get the right amount of tang. Finally, I strained it before mixing in the cream, so it was silky smooth.

Excellent. A bit of modification: As per receipe, soup seemed too thin. Used 1 can low fat chicken broth and 2 cans (14.5 oz) vegtable broth, doubled cream. If I were to do it again I'd add 2+ cups of cooked rice and then run through blender.

My husband made this soup and it was delicious! He used the cream. His asparagus tips also sank but that didn't matter to me! It would be good with a few croutons floating on top too.

It is a really great soup, and couldn't be much easier. Be sure to use the creme fraiche -- it adds much more flavor than using just cream. Also, I ended up putting it through a food mill to get rid of the asp. fibers. All my guests raved about it -- will definitely make again...

Rating: 4
This simple soup was surprisingly flavorful. The fresh lemon juice is subtle but wonderful. Despite the recipe, the soup did not need to be thinned with any extra broth after pureeing (maybe because I used cream, not creme fraiche). The asparagus tips sank to the bottom of the soup. Does the soup need to be really thick to keep that from happening?

Rating: 4
This is a delicious soup that my family has enjoyed for years. Try adding 1 tsp. herbs de Provence. Also, don't try to puree with a stick blender - - the asparagus is too fibrous and you wind up with a stringy mess.
