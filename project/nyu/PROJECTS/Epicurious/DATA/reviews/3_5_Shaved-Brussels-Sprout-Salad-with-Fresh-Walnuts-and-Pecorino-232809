Once I played with the proportions, this salad was delicious. I will make it again and again. I added more cheese and about 2x as many walnuts, plus a little garlic in the dressing. Don't forget a healthy amount of freshly-ground pepper. Shredding the sprouts in the food processor is definitely the way to go.

Fantastic salad. The cheese and walnuts are the perfect additions. Loved it!

Very tasty. At first I thought it was bland, but then I just kept adding more Pecorino. In the end, I think I added too much, but it was tasty. I used walnuts instead of pecans, because that's what I had on hand. I brought some in to work for a coworker who likes Brussels sprouts and she said it was very good.

This recipe was voted best at our St. Patrick's Day Eve "greenfest." Really nice, light and tasty. A few thoughts: - the proportions seem a bit off. I would suggest 1.5 times as much dressing as called for, with an emphasis on the lemon juice, and at least 2x as much grated parmesan as called for, for texture and flavor - Needs lots of pepper and some salt Finally, I wish I had a big food processor, because having doubled the recipes it was a LOT of slicing to do (and my thumb was part of the slicing). Will definitely make again

I loved this salad. I may have used more lemon juice and less olive oil than called for, because I eyeballed it, and I forgot to bother toasting the walnuts. It made for a delicious and super healthy lunch, paired with a half veggie sandwich that my boyfriend and I shared. And I have leftovers for tomorrow! Wee!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Nice contrast with the other dishes which were all traditional Thanksgiving fare. Also a good way to incorporate Brussels sprouts on the menu when you don't want to serve them roasted.

This lacked flavor so I added lemon zest, and a splash of both butternut squash oil and Meyer lemon balsamic vinegar.Perfect!

My husband and I loved this salad! I added some lemon zest as well. It's healthy, fast, and tasty! Keeps well too.

Very simple, fast and easy to make and a great way to get a raw vegetable (with all the benefits) into a meal! I was worried the brussel flavor would be too strong but it was fine! The cheese matters, quality is important. I think next time I may try a specialty oil like pecan or hazlenut, and maybe a small amount of fresh garlic for another healthy punch.

Tasty, yes, but not exceptional. Quick and easy to prepare (thanks, in large part, to the slicer attachment for my cuisinart), and relatively good for you. I debated giving it two forks (because it was quite good), but I feel it just crossed into "three fork delicious" territory. And though I'm happy I settled upon this recipe (quick to make AND healthy to boot!), I'm not sure I'd make it again. Good in a time-crunch, but there are other Brussels sprout salad recipes that pack a little more punch.

Had pretty much this exact recipe at a hip Mediterranean restaurant on a recent visit to Chicago, and just had to recreate it on my return home. I used the slicer on my food processor for quick prep, and it turned out perfect. Simple and delicious.

I wouldn't have believed that brussel sprouts could be eaten raw. I used the food processor to slice them. It was a pleasant surprise, and so easy!

Delicious. Had something similar at Corsino Cantina in NYC, they served it on a crostini and they didn't add walnuts. I recreated the crostini and cooked a few with the slaw on. They were both delicious yet had such different tastes. Highly recommend either making it yourself or heading to Corsino Cantina. http://www.corsinocantina.com/menu/

Another admirable recipe for raw vegetables that I never expected would be so good in the uncooked state! Followed the advice of other reviewers and increased, slightly, the olive oil and lemon juice. Used 1/3 cup cheese and would definitely NOT add more than that. Easy and fast to make - a nice plus for a weeknight meal.

An alternative: throw the raw brussel sprouts in the Cuisinart, add lemon, olive oil, feta, and salt and pepper. Perfect spring salad.

Excellent. Loved this. Hope our crop of brussel sprouts comes in this year so we can make this often.

I love brussels sprouts so I found this to be a waste of a good vegetable. The best thing in it was the cheese.

Rating: 4
I've had something similar to this but rather than lemon vinaigrette, it was served with a warm buerre blanc. and it seemed to have a ratio of 1 part cheese to 1.5-2 parts brussels sprouts. I'm planning to try and replicate the recipe at home today!

Good, not great. The recipe is a keeper. I would add some apple to it

I just made this for the first time and loved it. I will definitely make it again, and would highly recommend it to friends. The one change I made, and would recommend, is tossing the whole sprouts into boiling water (before slicing) for 2-3 minutes until bright green and then immediately immersing in cold water to stop cooking. I think it helps reduce bitterness while still being crisp.

I'd never had raw sprouts before either, nor had anyone I served this to. It's a pretty unique dish for sure, and that's not a euphemism for nasty, it's just that I've not had anything like it before. A sort of a hearty, shredded salad with walnuts.

Rating: 4
Shave the brussels sprouts very thin. That's key with this dish. This salad has become one of our standard menu items every fall, the family loves it so much. Agree with others on the Saveur ratios. That's where I found the recipe originally. And agree on the lemon juice... watch your hand with it.

I had never had raw brussels sprouts before and this salad has won me over. Using a food processor is definitely the way to go -- fast, safe, very thin slices. I found it needed more lemon juice than the recipe called for and a bit more oil (I used half olive, half walnut oil). More cheese too, as another reviewer noted. My husband, not a brussel sprout fan, didn't even know that's what he was eating!

This is a declicous and beautiful dish. I however had to season with sea salt and fresh ground balck pepper. Because walnuts are not my favorite I substituted toasted pecans. DELICIOUS!

Liked it - skipped the olive oil. It's an easy one-dish lunch, and it keeps for about a week.

Quel suprise! This salad is a double epicurian delight! A new way to eat brussel sprouts and a new slaw favorite! We used pine nuts and are excited about making it again with walnuts.

This is fantastic but don't bother with the mandoline... you can create the finest shavings of the sprouts using a food processor in half the time and half the risk of cutting a finger.

this receipe is surprisingly delicious. i like pine nuts in place of the walnuts. parmiggiano or bellavitano are also nice substitutions for the pecorino. really simple and creative. http://fineeats.blogspot.com

This salad is wonderful. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and my most finicky guest couldn't get enough of it. I had to send leftovers home with her. I actually found a version of this recipe in the November issue of Saveur. Same ingredients but different proportions - much more nuts and cheese. I think it is better. 1 lb. sprouts, 2 cups walnuts, 1/3 cup cheese, 1/4 cup olive oil and juice of 1 lemon.

I had this salad at Barbuto in NYC and couldn't stop raving about it. Then I opened the November issue of the Magazine and there it was! I will make this over and over again!

Fun and easy alternative to roasting or sauteing brussel sprouts. Be careful with the lemon, though. It's easy to make this a little too tart.

A very special, fresh delicious salad. Impressive. I definitely recommend this recipe; however, only with the use of a mandoline. I've given the recipe to friends who made it using hand sliced brussel sprouts, and it didn't even resemble the same dish. Enjoy!

This is a fantastic change of pace salad. When shaved, the brussel sprout taste is so light so as to be unrecognizable, thereby giving this dish mostly texture. The pectorino, walnuts and lemon beautifully complement eachother. This is definitely a make for company first course!

This was a nice change to more traditional salads. Great combination of flavors and very light. Don't shy away if you are not a brussel sprout lover. They don't taste anything like brussel sprouts when they are not cooked. Just a fresh slaw.

Followed directions exactly; I liked it; my husband loved it.
