This was a wonderful recipe, but i did make a few changes. I used wide egg noodles instead of the "ear pasta" and used more garlic and onion. I also want to add that for the "sauce" made from the pasta water, I added melted butter and lots of parmesan, and turned it almost into a roux. It was delicious and my boyfriend kept commenting on how good it was. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. I used more garlic than called for, but otherwise kept everything else the same. A nice hearty side dish to some pan-roasted chicken thighs i made. The pancetta and pine nuts make this dish!

Even though my husband, who never eats more than one bowl of pasta, ate two bowls of this, I still think it's just a good recipe. I made a bunch of substitutions, though: raw broccoli, which I should have cut up smaller and steamed a bit to make it more like the thawed frozen; onions; walnuts; peppered ham; and bowtie pasta. I added a bit of pasta water since there was no sauce to speak of. Nice flavors.

Good recipe. It needed some more flavor however. Bacon, instead of pancetta (or a combination of the two) might have added that extra bite. A bit more garlic, and definitely some parmesan. I added a bit of hot pepper flake. A good weeknight meal; both quick and tasty, but cooks can add and subtract ingredients keeping the basic concept.

Great - so good. My tips are this: Make sure the orecchiette breaks up nicely while boiling....doubled up orecchiette is not too good. I also think the key is the fast & easy prep. It took me about 25 minutes total - Oh, also, when you sizzle he garlic it browns pretty fast - if you take the skillet to the sink and tilt it, the pine nuts sink and the garlic floats for easy removal. Seriously good AND the best part - my 4 year old son AND 21 month old daughter cleaned their plates.

Didn't think I would get such complex flavors from such simple ingredients, but it is simply delicious. Had to substitute bacon and green onions, and will probably add more bacon next time. After everything was done, I mixed in a cup of parmigiano-reggiano and it was very good. I agree with previous reviews to cook the bacon first, and add everything else after it is almost cooked. The bacon grease gives it a great taste, Quick and easy to make.

Silly day today and plans for dinner fell threw. Looked in refrigerator and saw broccoli from garden and pulled my folder marked broccoli and found this recipe. Oops! No orecchiette, substitued paparadelle, no scallions, ran into garden and pulled fresh "candy" onion and no parm...only romano. So I blanced the broccoli and then tossed the pasta into the now vacant water and proceeded. Husband thought it was great. Joy throughout the land! I would add a little red pepper flake when I make it again and maybe finish with some lemon zest but still a great combo and very pleased.

Substituted Broccoli Rabe (fresh) for frozen Broccoli (ick.) Tripled the garlic and did not discard it either. Doubled the pancetta too. In fact, I started the saute with the pancetta so the oil & butter combined with the fat from the pancetta.

I don't think the pancetta really added anything to the dish.

This was very easy and tasty. I gave it 3 stars only because it was not out-of-the-park. One of my kids loved it, the other 2 immediately started picking things out.

Quick and easy but very bland.

So tasty and, even better, so easy to prepare. I actually could prepare everything else while the pasta was cooking (usually recipes say that and I think, yeah, right!). After reading other reviews, I did cook the pancetta first to crisp before adding the nuts, etc., and I would def. recommend that procedure. The pine nuts really added to the overall flavor of the dish. I am adding this to my easy weeknight dinner rotation.

This was really easy to prepare, but I made several modifications. Used bacon and fresh broccoli and five cloves of minced garlic. Cooked bacon first, then added garlic, pinenuts, scallions, and steamed broccoli. Topped with fresh parmesan. It was easy and delicious!

This was a great dish-- especially considering how quick and easy it was. I used fresh broccoli, doubled the pancetta (and cooked it longer for some crisp), and added some heavy cream to make a light alfredo. Try adding some sage and rosemary no leftovers :)

This was a perfectly delightful dish - perfect for a weeknight. I also used fresh broccoli, but blanched it in regular water - I wasn't clever enough to use the pasta water. I used cubed pancetta, rather than the slices the recipe called for, as that's what I had on hand - but I would concur that adding the pancetta first would be a good idea, although my result was great - I did end up cooking it longer than indicated in an effort to crisp-up the pancetta. Incidentally, because I didn't have scallions on hand, I substituted a shallot.

Delicious! Used fresh broccoli (blanched it in the pasta water) Would also consider adding pancetta before pine nuts to crisp it more. All in all, a tasty treat!
