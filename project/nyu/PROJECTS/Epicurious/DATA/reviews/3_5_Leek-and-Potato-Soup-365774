This was very good. I served it at a dinner party and everyone seemed to like it. I made a couple changes to it. I used Russett Potatoes instead of yukons. I added some chopped up carrots, onion, shallots and celery(had some left over from another dish) when I cooked the leeks. And I added a shot of cream. Overall this was very good.

Easy recipe! I added half a scallion & a sweet onion. GREAT! I used olive oil vs butter. It tasted GREAT!

I love the basics of this receipe. Very easy. I improvised with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and I added green onions to the leaks. I also put in sliced baby bella mushrooms. I used 5 potatoes instead of 4 and only 5 cups of organic, free range chicken broth. I did not have fresh nutmeg...and I was skeptical about this spice...but I liked it. I really loved the fresh spinach in it. Very easy. I like a thick potato soup, and after using my imersion blender, it turned out perfect. You can add extra broth or water when reheating. There is no reason to overspice this recipe. The mushrooms for me, gave it added earthiness without overpowering. A great winter soup.

Absolutely delicious, and not difficult at all. My mom made leek soup all the time, but never pureed it; it tasted creamy and delicious without the cream! Will definitely make again.

Would be tasty for vegan soup,just switch out butter and chicken stock.

This is a great soup and very easy to make. I made a bit more than the recipe calls for and dumped in an entire box of frozen chopped spinach.
