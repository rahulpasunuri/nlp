I couldn't disagree more with the other reviewer! this dish was absolutely delicious. i did cut back on the fennel (to 1/4 of the called amount. not everyone likes fennel and i was afraid my guests might be one of them) it was a lot of work to prepare and it was unbelievably expensive. (the dish cost over 100 $$ to make) but the end result was very special. everyone loved it and, served chilled, it was the star of a spectacular summer dinner party.

With lobster being $25 per lb, scallops and prawns $12 per lb, do the math..it was expensive to make for a non-impressive dish. Everyone did get a kick out of the live lobster experience (the cooking water made a difference in the flavor of the prawns and scallops so do try to sub frozen lobster tail). It was easy to make, the steps flow well together. Way too much fennel, would of been better without it.
