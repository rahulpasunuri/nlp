This a GREAT recipe for leftover lobster! Very easy to make and the flavors are light and refreshing.

The dressing on the salad overpowered the flavor of the lobster.

The idea of the salad (ie., its ingredients) was good, but the dressing wasn't--too strong/vinegary.

I parboiled the peas for a minute, removed them, then cooked shrimp in the same boiling water. I didn't have any jicama, but I did use toasted black sesame seeds. Great recipe!

This dish is delicious, but it makes A LOT of food. I would lessen the ingredients quite a bit next time. I would also add some chopped chilies for some extra zing...it's a tad bland otherwise.

Tasty. Added two thai chilis (diced) to the sauce for some zing.
