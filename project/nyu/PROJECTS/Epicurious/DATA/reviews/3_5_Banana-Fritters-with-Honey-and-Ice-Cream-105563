Delicious! My kids loved them too (and keep asking for them). You do need ripe bananas though for the best flavor.

Lovely dessert, especially after a curry dinner. Delicate and delicious!

I made this for a party recently and found it was tasteless as recipe states. With 2nd batch, I added a liberal helping of cinnamon and extra fresh coconut to batter, and then sprinkled finished pieces with powdered sugar. Not wanting to waste anything, I fried the extra batter like little funnel cakes. Also used pineapple in the batter. Both funnel cakes and pineapple were better than the bananas. Guests said pineapple burst with juicy sweetness. Though easy to make, I think there are better things to make with fruit. If I'm going to fry anything, it had better be worth the calories, fat, and time!

I am twenty-something girl who never cooks and had never used Epicurious before. I needed to find a dessert recipe to make and bring to a supper club I belong to. Everyone in the supper club, including myself thought these turned out so good. They are really easy to make and I have already made them again. They were so tasty that everyone in the club wanted the recipe. Two-thumbs up from all of us.
