Made these for a catering event - used wild smoked coho which was fairly mild. The creme fraiche I had was very runny so I put just a dab under the salmon ribbon to help it stick to the brioche. Got some bourbon-infused trout roe from California Caviar Co which gave it a nice accent.

Made this for last New Years; very easy and the guests devoured it. This year I've gotten two requests to make it again!

I actually don't care for smoked salmon, but I prepared this dish for my guests at new year's and they absolutely adored it. It's an easy hors d'oueuvre and is well worth the money (but of course don't use the very best caviar -- that should be savored with fewer adornments).

We made this for New Year's - we made some with the salmon and some with just caviar. I dont think we'll ever serve caviar with anything other than brioche again; the rich and faintly sweet bread is a perfect foil.
