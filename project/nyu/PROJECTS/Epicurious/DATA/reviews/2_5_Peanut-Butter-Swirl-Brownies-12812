I made these for work, and people just ate them up! I wonder how the swirl effect was achieved? There was so much pb mixture and so little chocolate mixture, that swirling it in was not an option. I just spread it over the top of the brownie mix and hoped for the best. It was a very oily dessert, which I won't make again

Sometimes you should listen to your "inner chef". This was one of those times. As an experienced baker The proportions of fat to flour seemed excessive. however I followed the recipe. The result was an oily, flat tasting bar confection. Eliminating the butter in the peanut butter mixture and reducing the the butter in the batter should make a big difference. Good Luck! I won't make these again.

These are rich and delicious. I will certinly make these again. I thought the oven temperature was too high, mine burned around the edges, but they were still very good. I thought they made a lot.

I think the huge amount of sugar camouflaged flavors. I liked the whole cup of peanut butter thinking it would have alot of peanut flavor - but it really didn't. The sugar is probably to blame. The recipe definately made alot of brownies, but it rated third in my three brownie offerings at work.
