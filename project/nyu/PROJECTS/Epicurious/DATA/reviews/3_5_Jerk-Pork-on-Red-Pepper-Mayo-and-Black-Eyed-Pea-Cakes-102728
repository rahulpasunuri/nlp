Happy New Year! I actually searched for a black-eyed pea recipe to bring in the new year as my husband hates Hoppin' John---but who doesn't need some luck for the new year? I was PLEASANTLY surprised by this dish. I made the black-eyed corn cakes as the recipe recommended and they were so delicious with the red pepper mayo. We all loved it. Plus---it is really healthy and if you are very frugal with the mayo---very low in calorie. I really wanted a fall apart pork--so I rubbed the pork with the marinade (per the recipe)--put it in a pan at 300--covered it with foil and cooked it for about 4-5 hours. Wow! It was awesome and just fell apart. My husband has asked me when I will make it again!

I try to cook a traditional Southern meal on New Year's Day and my husband hates black eyed peas. This recipe won him over!

Yum! But I used canned beans, which I knew was a no-no for cakes, and as with previous experience, they completely fell apart. However, I wasn't making this for a party - just for good luck for me and my husband! So I put my vestiges of "cakes" in the frying pan and got them all nice and crispy on both sides, and just served up a as a mess on the plate. It was still pretty, with the golden and red colors, and I think dried, soaked beans wouldn't cause such a problem - maybe an extra egg as another reviewer already suggested would also help.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! It is so different than most hors d'oeuvres and versitile because you can top with the meat or not if you have vegetarians at your party! I have also made larger cakes and served them as a side dish for jerk chicken as a main course. I used roasted red bell peppers in place of the fresh bell pepper and because of that I didn't saute with the garlic, saving a cooking step. I did add jalepenos and chopped onion and extra eggs. I also substituted sour cream for most of the mayo (about 1/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup sour cream). I also added cilantro and garlic powder to the mayo/sour cream. Instead of the jerk pork, I used the same recipe but used cicken instead of pork. We LOVED it!!

This recipe has become a great hit with my company, we tweek it here and there, but it's along the lines of a touch more pepper, cumin, a little lime juice. That sort of thing. It's fabulous for holiday entertaining. Especially since you can prep all the components several days (fridge) to a week or so in advance (freeze)!

Very yummy. Several guests referred to them as "addictive." One problem: as the recipe is written, the cakes are way too crumbly. They fall apart in the cornmeal, in the saute pan, and in guests' fingers. Double or triple the eggs and it works great. Also, I pureed the peppers and mayo.

What a terrific combination of flavors. I marinaded the pork for 8 hours. It was quite spicy but very good. The cakes were labor intensive but very good. Because the cakes and pork can be on the dry side....I recommend using a good dose of the red pepper mayo. Over all my guests loved this dish!

The flavors were very good, but the dish does require some time to make. I made the cakes in advance and froze--not a good idea. They tended to crumble after thawing. The pork loin is not easy to shred (usually I'd use pork butt for shredding) so I cut into julienne and then pulled apart. Looked fine this way. The pork did freeze well so this can be made in advance. Really I think you need all three elements--the cakes, the red pepper mayo (delicious) and the pork to get the best flavor. I will use the jerk seasoning again for dinner--really was great on the pork.

I left out the pork and just used the mayo. These were pretty tasty but I'm not sure they were worth the time that they took. I would try with the pork if I made it again.

My family and I couldn't believe how good these cakes were! I didn't make the pork; just used the red pepper mayo. I sauted them the day before and reheated them in the oven the next day. They were very fresh-tasting.

We had our doubts about the black eyed pea cakes but this dish received rave reviews at our New Year's Eve party. Jerk pork and red pepper mayo very good by itself too - on crackers or wrapped in lettuce leaves, and, probably excellent as a sandwich. Great jerk sauce recipe too.
