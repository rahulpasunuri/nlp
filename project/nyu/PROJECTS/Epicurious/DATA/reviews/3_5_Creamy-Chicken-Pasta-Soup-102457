This is a great recipe to build off of. For my version, I added 3 inches of ginger, 4 cloves of garlic, edamame, a dash of mild curry powder and paprika to give it a little kick. And I used boneless thighs instead of breasts which ended up being very juicy and flavourful cooked in the soup. My boyfriend who just came down with a cold is loving it - and I feel much safer from the cold having had some. :)

Standard fare with great depth and rich flavor. If you are new to soup stick with the recipe provided, but if you know what you like go bananas and mix things up. I kept it simple by adding cayenne pepper, garlic, and omitting the snap pea (out of season). I wish I added the lemon juice which would have brightened the whole thing up.

Feel free to tweak this soup as you need. It's very flexible. I've made this a few times before and this time I doubled the mushrooms, added leeks and spinach, and swapped a cup of uncooked rice for the pasta. (let it cook for about five minutes and then cover, turn the heat off and let it stand till the rice is done) Don't omit the lemon juice or the half/half cuz they really work nice! I've both followed the recipe strictly and made substitutions and it always comes out good. Like with any soup, taste it and tweak it... Then enjoy!

Used boneless, skinless breasts - sliced into pieces and sauteed first in EVOO, S&P. Then added onion, one clove minced garlic, 3 grated carrots, zucchini. (Didn't have shrooms or celery). After that done, added baby corn pieces and edamame beans (shelled). Added celery salt and used one container 900 ml of unsalted chick broth and approx 400ml of reduced sodium chick broth. Used 1 cup 2% milk instead of half/half. Excellent flavour of veg came through, though it was bland, but a great base to build from. Preferred without lemon. I added freshly ground reggiano/parm to the pot and served on the side to add to taste - amazing addition. Used leftover fettucine noodles and cooked tubetti, reheated both quickly by immersing sieve containing pasta in boiling water, put noodles in bowl first then added soup over top - thus leftovers have no pasta. Next time more garlic, fresh basil leaves, perhaps grand padano grate on top.

Very good soup! Made for my 2 boys that are sick and enjoyed it very much. I omitted the muchrooms, used whole milk, put a bay leaf in while simmering, used rotini, added 1 sliced garlic clove. I initially put in 2 T of lemon juice and it was so good, I put in the third T. Mistake! Too lemony! So I added 1 T sherry to the mix. It was perfect!

This soup is great! I have three young kids and one is extremely picky. My whole family will eat this soup and the picky one asked for seconds with "lots of chicken and snap peas". I was shocked! I have made this twice in two weeks and we loved it more the second time. I made a couple changes - 1) I seasoned the raw chicken with salt and pepper and sauteed it in olive oil before I added it to the soup (drippings and all). 2) I simmered the soup for a bit before I added the cream and parsley and 3) I used ditalini pasta instead of penne. Overall this soup is yummy and comforting - just what we need on a cold Chicago day!

Really wonderful soup. I saw some comments that it could come out bland, so I added oregano, garlic, and tarragon, and browned the chicken before adding. The tarragon really rounded out the lemon and cream. Served with buttermilk biscuits and it made a great winter dinner.

I LOVE this recipe. It does require quite a bit of salt, but the end result is delicious and makes great leftovers. I love the crunch of the snap peas. Don't leave those out! I know other reviewers say this is bland, but it's a creamy soup, add some salt and it's perfect.

Making good soup is one of the biggest challenges I face as a cookthis recipe provided a good base for a creamy, chicken & vegetable soup, but does need some creativity in terms of flavorful additions (herbs & spices & alternate veggies). I am not a fan of the snap-peas in this soup and usually sub in green peas. When thickened up a bit, this is a nice base for a chicken potpie.

Deliously creamy and mild, this is a delightful version of vegetable soup without tomatoes. I loved the addition of sugar snap peas. I haven't made it in over a year but still remember how much I liked it.

Rating: 3
We make this recipe with considerable frequency, often with some minor variation. Tonight, I used a chicken stock I had made for an egyptian recipe, so it was infused with cardamom, black pepper, and dill, among other things. It was definitely an interesting variation, but actually quite pleasant. Even in it's straight incarnation, we like this recipe a lot for a basic weeknight dinner. We usually substitute medium shells for penne, and often leave out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them (too bad for me...). It's important to feel free to temper the amount of lemon to your taste. Also, substituting either milk or heavy cream for the half and half works fine, depending on what you have around. This recipe is great as a baseline you can work around depending on what you have available.

While the majority of reviewers seem to really like this soup, count me as one of the dissenters. I've too enjoyed 'this' soup at J Alexanders and was antcipating this version to emulate it more closely than what was the end result of this recipe. (The J Alexanders version is a cross between vegetable soup and Greek Egg Lemon soup) I followed the recipe exactly as written and found the result was bland and uninspired; It wasn't creamy enough, it didn't have any real flavor -- even the usual vibrance of lemon was lost in this one! I tried to doctor it up to no avail. I make my own soups from scratch quite often and am really bummed that I wasted the good ingredients and my time on this one.

My entire family loved this soup - four children included! It was easy to prepare - I used whole wheat pasta. I thought the soup was better when I prepared the soup itself one day ahead and added the pasta and peas just before serving. The peas make the soup!

Rating: 3
I think this sou is great. It's the ultimate comfort food. I prefer to use a smaller pasta - I think elbow macaroni holds up better if you plan to keep it for leftovers (which you'll want to). I wonder though, what is the purpose of adding the flour to teh vegetable-butter saute? Is it to make some sort of a roux? Mine always ends up a little clumpy, but once I add the stock it seems fine again. I've also inadvertantly skipped the flour step and it didn't seem to make a difference. Can anyone weigh in?

Rating: 3
A keeper! I used a little bit of brown rice which I had in the refrigerator instead of pasta. I tasted it before adding the rice, and it tasted great. However I decided to kick the flavor up by adding a few dashes of red pepper, because my husband likes things with a kick. Delicious. I had no problem with curdled soup after adding lemon juice. I removed it from the fire and let it sit for about a minute before adding it, however. I'm wondering if the people who find it bland used canned chicken broth? I used my homemade stock, which has lots of flavor. It calls for chicken stock or canned broth, but homemade stock is the better choice because it usually has more flavor than canned broth. For new cooks: don't be afraid to experiment with your recipes. You might end up creating some wonderful dishes.

I have been making soups from this website for about a year now, and tonight I sat down to review all my favorites. This one gets special mention. I would give it 5 forks if I could. I made one change. I HATE peas, so they were omitted. But do not omit the lemon juice, as some reviews said. That will take away 50% of the flavor. If you have a really, really good quality homemade chicken stock, this soup will thrill you.

I thought this dish was excellent. I have always been a fan of J. Alexander's soup, and I was really happy to find this recipe!

This soup is easy, fast, delicious, and hearty. I prefer not to cook the chicken in the soup, so I either oven roast a whole chicken or sautee boneless skinless breasts. I also added a bay leaf and a couple of sprigs of thyme to add a little seasoning besides salt and pepper. There are lots of modifications to make to suit anyone's taste as far as veggies and pasta go. I highly recommend this versatile soup for anyone looking for a quick and healthy meal for cold or hot weather.

This soup is one of the best I've ever made!! It was wonderful, very filling, flavorful and easy to make. I omitted the mushrooms (not a fan) and minced the onion and a whole lemon in the food processor... I also sautéed the chicken in some olive oil, garlic salt and white wine before adding to the soup at the end. This is SOOOOOOO good. A+++++

Rating: 4
Loved this soup. We roasted a whole chicken in the oven using the beer can method except with a can of Pepsi and used all the meat from the chicken. We also added more pasta and it was very thick, almost like a stew or a casserole instead of a soup. So next time I might try increasing the liquids to keep it soup-like. But it was rich and filling and was great with a homemade loaf of bread on a snowy night!

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I followed the minor modifications from the reviewer from B.C. (added some garlic,extra veggies, but didn't brown the chicken before hand). Results were incredible! I added the pasta with the chicken broth and simmered to not quite al dente before adding the half and half. Perfect! Don't omit the lemon juice - I had no problem with curdling as previous cook mentioned. Has anyone tried to freeze this?

I thought this soup was GREAT--smooth and comforting. A big hit with the kids too. I would delete the lemon at the end, as it caused my soup to curdle.

What can I say this soup was fabulous! My husband and I are watching our calories so we made small adjustments. We put in 1 1/2 cup of celery instead of 1 cup. Put in 1/2 cup of 1% milk and 1 cup of half and half. We didn't have pre-cooked chicken, so he cooked two chicken breast, 4 chicken thighs skinned and far removed in chicken stock and used whole wheat pasta. He never added the lemon juice, he thought it was good as it was, but we will try it next time. Next time I would like to add some tarragon. The soup was comforting and delicious.

First made and reviewed this excellent soup in Jan/02 and have made it numerous times since then and it has always been a hit. Made it again yesterday but, after reading each review, I made a few changes that made this already great recipe even better. 1) Added 4 large cloves of minced garlic to the veggie mix instead of my usual 2 cloves. 2) Added 1 cup of very small sea shell pasta following the addition of broth and before adding the cream rather than cooking it separately. Perfect pasta for this soup! 3)Used boneless/skinless chicken breasts which I browned/sauteed in a little butter and sprinkled with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder; removed from pan and diced; deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup chicken broth; added the diced chicken back to the pan for a few minutes to reheat before adding to the soup near the end of cooking. This added a deeper depth of flavour to the finished soup and the chicken was more tender. 4) Maintained my usual juice and finely grated zest of 1 lemon added to the soup a few minutes before serving. The lemon zest imparts so much flavour without making the soup too tangy/acidic. It is the lemon that distinguishes this soup from every other chicken soup and elevates it far beyond the ordinary. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. This is a great soup as written, but with these changes it is nothing short of sublime! Don't understand how anyone could find this soup bland and boring. This is down-home comfort food with a surprising, gourmet twist! Enjoy!

After seeing this recipe for weeks getting so many good reviews I decided to try it. Followed the recipe exactly.

Chicken noodle soup with cream and lemon juice..big whoop. From reading the reviews, I thought this recipe was going to wake the dead. But it was a basic decent chicken noodle soup recipe. Mexicans have been putting lime juice in their soup for ages, so that is nothing new. It is better than eating canned, but definitely not something to knock your socks off. I don't think I will, but if I ever make this again, I'm definitely going to start throwing more herbs, garlic, wine and other things in there.

Even with a terrible cold and dull tastebuds, I knew it was a winner, and the boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. I was a lttle leery of using the sugar snap peas but they were just right. Kept them on the side with the pasta so neither would become become wilted/mushy leftovers.

Have made this many times and it is always a treat for the palate as well as the eyes. Really prefer the crisp snap peas but have also enjoyed with asparagas. The lemon adds a bright twist to this soup that elevates it well beyond the ordinary - I use the juice and finely grated zest of 1 medium-sized lemon. Yes, these are simple ingredients, but they combine to make a deliciously satisfying soup. Not every recipe requires exotic and/or numerous ingredients to make it good to the last drop. Enjoy!

We all must have "simple palettes" at our home because this is a family favorite of ours. It's a great weeknight recipe.

This is wonderful! I'm finishing a bowl right now, and I'm really pleased with this recipe. I cut back to 2T each of butter and flour, and 3/4 cup of half and half, and substituted frozen green beans for the snap peas, and it still came out delicious. Next time I'm going to increase the flour, so it's thicker, and use fat free half and half. I'm also going to try ditalini, since it's easier to get on your spoon. With some slight modifications, this is a great diet soup!

This soup is fantastic, and there's a lot of room to play around with the addition of ingredients. I found that rotini, broccoli, peas, and spinach worked very well with this recipe.

My husband & really loved this soup -we had it for dinner one night and for the past two lunches. The flavor of the creamy broth is incredible and the pasta and snap peas make it very satisfying. I made the mistake of covering the soup which curdled the half & half and ended up stirring in a little creme fraiche and that seemed to fix it up.

One tip I'd like to share - instead of using chicken tenders, try the precooked lemon chicken from the supermarket (skinned of course!). Also, the last time that I made it I tried substituting fat free half & half, and it still tasted great. Now I can have guilt free seconds!

This has become a staple soup in our household. The flavor is simple yet satisfying and my little girls love it. I use the recipe as a base and use whatever veggies I have on hand but the sugar snap peas are our favorite. I always cook the penne in the soup with good results.

I make a lot of soup during the winter months using my own stock. This soup needs a roux to help thicken it. I also thought it had a bland flavor. I do like the idea of sugar snap peas.

Rating: 4
This was a very easy, tasty soup to make - and oddly enough, I even had everything on hand, from homemade chicken stock to frozen snap peas! I used cream and rice instead of the half-and-half and the pasta, got a fresh lemon off the tree, and this was heaven on a wintery, rainy, chilly night!

This recipe was wonderful. Made the soup the day before excepted for adding the penne and sugarsnap peas. Did cook the penne the day before and used the mini penne and stored in refrg in plastic bag. Added 1/2 tsp of dried tarragon and used a little more chicken. I did saute the chicken first, removed, cooked veggies and then continued with the recipe. Used it for a group of friends on our game night and they loved it. Served in a cup and also served a big tossed salad, crusty bread and dessert. it served 10 people approximately 1 1/4 C servings each. Will make this again soon. The sugarsnap peas and the lemon juice really add a lot to the recipe. Was concerned that it was not thick, but it was perfect. May try fatfree half and half next time to cut back on calories and could reduce the butter by a T or so.

This is really good. I promised my 6 year old she'd like the "green things". She thought it was great. The first time I made it, the lemon juice made me nervous because I don't care for lemon. I only added 1 tablespoon. It was a little bland and I ended up adding salt. The second time I added what the recipe called for and it was great. It didn't need any salt! Coming from a saltaholic that a is huge statement! Another bit of advice - add the pasta as you eat it. The previous review was correct. It soaks up the broth and gets mushy.

Very rich and flavorful. I will make this again and again. A definite keeper!

This was fabulous. Every bowl was empty. I added a touch more lemon juice but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I must have done something wrong with the chicken. All I had were boneless chicken breasts which I cut into chunks. When I tried the soup, the chicken was like cardboard but the broth was excellent so I strained the soup, pulled out the chicken chunks and put the vegetables back in and it was great! The real surprise however was the lemon juice. It was like discovering a "secret ingredient". I have made lots of soups and this is one of my favorites!

Rating: 4
Really excellent soup! The only change I made was to add 2 cloves minced garlic. Has great eye appeal and love the crunch of the sugar snap peas. Only downside is this is best if all eaten in one sitting as it doesn't fare well the next day - the pasta absorbs a lot of the liquid so the soup has to be thinned with more broth/cream. Love the suggestion from the previous reviewer to add coconut milk - thanks so much I'll be sure to try that next time. This is a definite keeper!

Rating: 4
Really excellent soup......I used 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and add about 1/2 tsp chot chillis. This reminds me of a soup that a friend who travelled alot to Thailand used to make me.... Next time I will add bean sprouts at the very end

This has become one of my favorite chicken soups. The crunch of the sugar snaps and the lemon make the dish. I did saute seasoned chicken breasts in garlic before shredding them and adding to the soup.

I'VE TRIED TO MAKE SEVERAL SOUPS BEFORE AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AT LEAST SLIGHTLY DISAPOINTED. BUT NOT WITH THIS RECIPE. IT'S EASY TO MAKE, SATISFIES AND IS GREAT AS LEFTOVERS. THE LEMON IS A DEFINITE MUST (ASK ANY GREEK).

I added some pepper and some bell's seasoning while it simmered because it tasted a little bland when I tasted it. I also used whole milk rather than half and half. I will try the half and half next time for a change. This is a nice, hearty, healthy soup. Yum!

This is okay, but nothing special. There are better recipes for chicken soup out there. However, I did like the addition of lemon, and think I will try that in future chicken soup recipes.

Made this last night - neither my three young children nor my husband finished it. It was too bland; perhaps the addition of sherry could make a difference. Was not what I had expected, although I tried hard to like it...

Excellent! I made my own stock with 2 qts. of water, 1 T. salt, 3 chicken breast halves, 3 thighs, 3 legs, and added large chunks of onion, carrots, and celery. I pressure cooked the chicken and vegetables 30 minutes. I then strained the broth, pureed the vegetables, and added the pureed vegetables before adding the cream. After adding the cream, I shredded the chicken.

I know this soup got rave reviews, however, I just can't figure out why. To me it was bland.

Rating: 3
I love this soup, but made a few changes. First, I use fat free half and half. Second, instead of cooked pasta, I use a 12oz package of frozen egg noodles. These noodles are more toothsome, and the flour adds a little bit of thickness, making the soup "creamier."

Rating: 4
When living in TN ate this several times at J.Alexander's in Chattanooga--loved it; very excited when originally in mag. I think some people are misunderstanding the "creamy" thing; doesn't mean super-thick; just not simply a stock. Looked back up to print for friend who smelled it when I reheated leftovers at work. Those who say too bland must only be chile pepper type people; very tasty. Made many times substituting everything/anything. Imho a can't do wrong recipe that can be made easily for every-day or really dressed up for company as a show-off.

To "Cook on 11/5" ... if you cooked the pasta in the chicken broth, it would obviously soak up a lot of your broth leaving you with a small amount of soup. Better to cook in water and then add to the broth.

Rating: 0
Why can't you just cook the pasta in the chicken broth before adding the half-and-half and the chicken? Seems like it would be better and easier.

A great creamy chicken soup. Will definetely make it again!

As so many others have said, this is an excellent recipe. A fair amount of chopping, but the assembly is straightforward. Could use a few more mushrooms and snap peas. To reduce fat and calories, I made it with 3/4 c. half-and-half and 3/4 c. 2% milk. I'm sure I'd have liked the creamier version even better, but this version was fine.

I first tasted this soup at J. Alexanders Resturant in Troy and I wanted the recipe. When I saw it in Bon Appetit I was very excited to try it. It is great! It simple to make, you can substitute the snap peas with fresh Asparagas. It is a soup I make for all occassions. This is a keeper.

This is a superb recipe. I was skeptical, as the ingredients looked basic and boring, but this soup is anything but!!! I highly recommend, and I'm pretty picky about what recipes I rate with 3-4 stars. I gave this a four star, because of all the chicken soups I've made, this is beyond compare.

Rating: 3
I was skeptical of this soup. I rarely find made-at-home creamy based soups to be creamy enough (always too milky for my taste). But this was very good. Snap peas were a nice addition. I wasn't a big fan of them, so I was hesitant but they really added texture and taste. Also, the lemon juice at the end is a must. Just add 2 T at first and taste. I found that was perfect. A very satisfying soup. Will make again soon.

Its a good soup but didn't think it was all too spectacular. Didn't taste the lemon, so I should probably have added more. I like lots of pasta so you can add more than the recipe calls for, 1 cup is very conservative. Would like to try adding garlic like others have suggested.

Rating: 3
I will make this again because my family loved it.I didn't use parsley, but oregano and thyme. I also used whole milk and maybe that is why the soup was thinner than I expected. I did add cornstarch to the broth to thicken before adding the milk. It is a meal in itself. I served a simple salad and french bread along side.

Rating: 4
This is a very good variation of my standard chicken stock/soup recipe and a nice change to the ordinary. I make my own chicken stock and cook the vegetables in it, then when it's done I chop them and return them to the strained broth, and then just add the lemon juice, cream (I used whipping cream and a lesser amount) fresh chopped parsley and cut up pieces of chicken from the fryer used to make the stock. I also added a can of diced tomatoes which added beautiful color to the mix of the other vegetables. Next time I think I will add some spinach. Also used garlic to make the stock. This soup is even better the next day after the flavors have time to blend.

Very tasty and filling. It is so much like the chicken potpie recipe that I use, and tastes alot like it. Only difference being noodles instead of crust. I added extra noodles by the way, and cooked them in soup at the end (as some readers have suggested) and that made the soup thicken up. Very good- my boys enjoyed it also.

This was okay, but seemed somewhat bland.

I agree the lemon is a must! That is the only thing that makes this soup any different - and the pea pods I suppose (we thought they needed to cook longer that 2 minutes too) I had a slight problem adding the flour to the sauteed vegetables, so I just added the cream right away. The soup was good but not the best ever.

This was interesting and easy to make. Very filling too, however I thought it was terribly bland. I kept adding pepper and salt at the end, in desperation I also added fresh majoram, thyme and extra parsley. In the end I added too much pepper, and still lacked flavor! The lemon is a MUST and perhaps some zest would help.

I made this recipe when it came out in the magazine and promptly lost the magazine. How wonderful to be reminded so we can enjoy it again. Served it on a cold rainy Sunday night with homemade bread. It is absolutely the most wonderful chicken soup. The peas do add just the perfect change and flavor. Make exasctly from the recipe. Yum.

This is a wonderful recipe. I agree with the suggestions to add garlic and thyme. My 4-year-old (who can be picky) tried a bite and said "Mmm." He tried another and said, "Mmmmmmmm." After his third mouthful he announced, "Mama, this is dewicious!" He's right. Try it!

Wow! I was suspicious of all the great reviews because the ingredients are so ordinary -- but this was really fabulous soup. More like 3.5 forks. I cooked the pasta in the soup, as others did, and added lots of fresh thyme because I had some on hand -- I'll do the same again because I like thyme with lemon.

My husband and I loved this soup! I also did as others suggested and threw the pasta in the soup to cook. Also, I browned the chicken in the soup pot first, removed it, then sauteed the vegetables. This added a nice flavor. I had no parsely, added a bit of tarragon. Yummy!

I was afraid this recipe may be too gourmet for my family, but they really liked it. I decided to chop the carrots, rather than shred them. I think that helped to make it more of a "family type" meal. I also served it with sourdough bread-that was a nice touch.

I did really like this recipe, however i did as another person and cooked the pasta in the soup, as fiquered chicken needed more than 5 mins anyway. i did add garlic to the first mixture as it cooked, but i put garlic in almost everything. I would reccomend this to anyone, it is dast and easy

Rating: 3
This is a great variation to my normal chicken soup recipe. The half and half made it light and creamy. I didn't feel that it needed to be any thicker as some reviewers suggested. I added the pasta right into the soup to cook at the end. This saved a pot by not cooking it separately. I will certainly make this again.

I made this soup on a cold snowy day recently - not only was it quite easy to make ~ the flavor was EXCELLENT! Before I added the snap peas and pasta, we had small helpings and liked it both ways - but I think those snap peas really make it special - I couldn't get fresh ones so I used frozen - but still, the taste was GREAT! Not only do I plan on making this again and again - but I plan on varying the types of pasta - trying it with orzo perhaps, and since I have just started a low-carb diet I also plan on making it without the pasta....It's a WINNER!

I was expecting something spectacular with all the great reviews, but I found it so-so. I don't know if I would make it again, but I would definitely add garlic. I had to add a lot of s&p to give it some taste - quite bland otherwise. I added cornstarch to thicken it up too.

This soup is so elegant, rich, and delicious! My whole family enjoyed it thoroughly. It is not meant to be thick and creamy -- just a light creamy texture -- and the flour and half and half takes care of that perfectly. Thank you J. Alexander's in Troy, Michigan and Bon Appetit!

Wow, what a delicious treat! We were feeling a little under the weather and instead of making the "traditional" chicken soup I made this - yum yum! Even feeling as bad as he did my guy asked for seconds! I too added some garlic (recommended)and I think the trick in getting it to thicken up is to let simmer a bit longer. With just the two of us we had enough for lunch today - I'm off to enjoy!

I sort of ran out of parsley, so I used cilantro, and the half-and-half was kind of off, so I used regular milk instead, and I *just* ran out of lemons so I had to use lime... Um.
