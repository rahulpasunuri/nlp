3 forks = delicious! I substituted leftover pork loin roast from my freezer that needed to be used up. Very fresh and tasty! Served it with cilantro brown rice (Chipotle copy-cat), the clementine-jicama salad from epi (added lettuce) and some Mexican-style baked frittata.

So delicious! Followed recipe exactly and will make again. Good with an extra squirt of lime before eating.

I made the pork in a pressure cooker. Rubbed it with a paste made from garlic, Serrano chilies, allspice, soy sauce, and salt. Put a bed of sliced onions on the bottom of the cooker, then 1 bottle of dark Mexican beer (Modelo), a rack, the roast, and topped it with lots of onions. Cooked for 1½ hours. It was fantastic!

Me again--I've made this a million times since my January review, and I've upgraded my rating to 4 forks. As someone else pointed out, it's much easier to use a slow cooker for the pork, and tenderloin or loin are good, lean stand-ins for the pork butt/shoulder. I cook the pork ahead of time, then the rest goes together so easily after work. Yum, yum, yum.

This is ABSOLUTELY what I'll plan to do with left over pork tenderloin (which I often have) in future. Easy (except for shredding the pork, which I leave to my husband) and so delicious. My teenage sons love it, too. Please use fresh corn tortillas--their sweetness plays so well with the sharp heat of the meat.

I've made this twice now and have a couple thoughts/additions. First, cooking the pork at a lower temp for longer makes it MUCH more tender, but I am sure that's no surprise for most cooks. Second, I found the pork too dry on reheating it with the chipotle and cilantro, so poured the accumulated juices from the roasting in there. Highly recommended! Finally, if you like things spicy like I do there's no harm in doubling the chipotle.

It was too hot to use my oven, so I prepared this using a tip from "A Cook from Wellington, New Zealand" and used what I had - pork cutlets. After 2 hours stove-top on medium-low in a large, covered skillet, it was very moist and tender and shredded beautifully. Much to my dismay, I only had a partial can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, so to punch the flavor it needed, I added some barbecue sauce. Knowing that a little cilantro goes a long way, I reduced it to 1 cup. Since we prefer flour over corn tortillas, I warmed them in the oven and folded them around the pork with green onions, avacado and shredded Mexican cheese. They were out of this world! Served with rice mixed with tomato salsa and roasted corn and refried black beans and fresh tomatoes. On a cooler day I will try again with a roasted pork butt as stated in the recipe.I consider this an easy dish to prepare, and excellent eating!!

This is very, very good. I made this in the summer for tacos and then froze the leftovers. This winter, I used the leftovers in a soup that I concocted that turned out fantastic! Love it

Rating: 4
Easy and really really delicious!!! One thing I discovered is that pork "butt" and pork "shoulder" are the same cut of meat, so if you think your market doesn't carry butt, it might just be labeled shoulder. Also I made mine in my slow cooker (covered with water, on low for 8 hours while I was at work) and it came out beautifully-- I can't wait to make this one again.

AMAZING dish. This meal comes together very quickly if you have time to cook the pork in a crock pot. Variations I've used, a quick pork rub of brown sugar, cumin, salt and pepper. I also serve this with jack cheese and sour cream. Guests always rave about this dish!

We love this for a quick weeknight dinner and use leftover pork tenderloin vs. the butt roast. Very spicy, falorful and easy. Do use corn tortillas and don;t omit the avacados. I serve with black beans and spanish rice as sides.

Rating: 4
This dish was outstanding. The flavor are very authentic - be sure to use corn tortillas. Our only issue was that the pork had to cook much longer than stated in order to get that 'fall off the bone' texture. It was a huge hit for a SuperBowl Party.

I got busy and forgot to cook the pork last night (so I could reheat it today after work), so put it in the crockpot (on Low seasoned with only salt and pepper and no liquid) this morning before leaving for work. When I got home (after about 11 hours) it was cooked perfectly. I would definitely use this method the next time. I cannot imagine using this with anything but butt/shoulder. Anything else would end up too dry. It left a nice tingly feeling in my mouth -- just the right amount of heat.

I asked for pork butt at the grocer and was told it was the same thing as shoulder (who knew?) so that's what I used. My pork was boneless so I probably ended up with a little more meat, but I halved all the ingredients except the chipotles, and my 12 corn tortillas were filled to the brim! I'm surprised nobody else has commented on generous proportions of this recipe. My dish was not particularly spicy so I had to add some extra hot sauce at the end. I did prepare my meat in the crockpot, I just S&P'd it and put it in all day on low, then when I got home from work I turned up the heat to high for about two hours...it was perfect, and not so hot that I couldn't pull the pork pretty shortly after it was done. I froze the leftover meat and plan to make another batch of the filling to make enchiladas for a party.

Absolutely delicious! Tried this out last week and am repeating today with no change in ingredients. My husband, who does not like Mexican food scoffed up the leftovers behind my back!

Wonderful! I made this for company so I had a 10-12 lb roast that i had in the oven for 3+hours. Also, I used dries chipoltle chiles since I already had those on hand. This was a very popular dish and was really tasty served with mango salsa.

Fab! I had boneless short ribs AND some pork cutlet. S&P'd all of it and seared it in the corn oil. Then into the crockpot for 6 hours on high. (Used a little garlic powder) added 1/2 C H20. Pork was perfect. Beans were perfect,...the MEAL was perfect. Rounded it out with a nic spanish rice and caipahrinias.........yummers. Oh, I also used your standard pre-folded corn tortillas for tacos. Daddy-O ate 14!!!

This was awesome. I made the pork differently. Instead of putting it in the oven, I rolled big chunks of the pork in seasoned flour and I seared the meat in oil in a big pot. Once they meat was brown on all sides, I added 2-3 cups of broth, an onion cut in half, garlic and a bay leaf. After about 2 hours the pork is shred able and moist. It turned out perfectly. I loved this and I ant wait to make it again.

This gets 4 forks just because it's so easy with great flavor results - of course we love anything with chipotles. Can see how this would be a great way to use up leftover pork from other meals.

Rating: 4
Good and easy! What's not to like. Minneapolis - you are right - pork butt/shoulder is best cooked longer, not just to 170. When cooked to pull, your fork should go in easily and the meat will fall apart (makes getting rid of the fat easier too). I have never had one dry out from overcooking.

This was super simple and delicious, the perfect "I don't have time but I'm so bored with everything I cook" recipe to jumpstart some new culinary adventures. I cooked the pork butt in a slow cooker -- no extra liquid, just salt and pepper seasoning as directed. My only reservation: I used three chipotles as suggested, but forgot that I was working with a larger piece of meat, and should have used the whole can. We made chalupas with the finished pork -- just set out the meat, corn tostada shells and extras. We used black beans, chopped red onion, cilantro, diced avocado, shredded cheese and roasted tomatillo salsa. Delicioso!

Made this last night for friends- really great! My only issue is that the pork was hard to pull; it roasted until 170 degrees but perhaps it should have roasted longer and slower? Really great flavors.

Absolutely delicious. I had leftover roasted pork tenderloin and used it in the recipe and it was wonderful. Makes me wish I had gone to Chef Castro's restaurant in Santa Fe when we were there a couple of months ago.

This was a big hit at our house. The black beans really added a lot of flavor. Also served with a little sour cream, and jack cheese. Really good.

This is fairly easy to prepare and has an interesting mix of flavors. I used a butt roast I had prepared the day before with garlic, made my own corn tortillas with masa harina and used extra chipotle peppers for more spice. The lime adds a nice contrast to the strong flavors of the meat. Larger tortillas might be a little easier to handle.It was a hit with guests, and I will definitely make it again.

We used pork tenderloin and sliced it rather than shredding. It turned out wonderfully! Very spicy, very delicious. Please, don't skip the black beans--they make the dish!

need larger tortillas to hold the filling. I added extra sauce from the chipotles to increase the smoky flavor and scraped the seeds out to eliminate some of the heat so the kids would eat it. I would make this again

Wonderful! Chipotles in adobo are my favorite. To cut some of the heat but keep the smoky flavor, get the whole peppers in the can and split them open and remove seeds. Suzanne, thanks for the sauce recipe. Will try it next time.

Great recipe--I put it in the crock pot before I left for work, shredded the meat when I got home and dinner was all but ready! The whole family loved it!

This is a quick and easy way to prepare pork. I use this as a low fat version of carnitas (which is fried pork) I recommend using only pork butt meat to avoid the meat being dry. I make my own salsa and serve with rice, homemade beans and warm corn tortillas. There are never any leftovers!!!

Rating: 4
Authentic taqueria flavor right at home! I rubbed the pork butt generously with garlic, salt & pepper before roasting. I also diced the pork into 1/4 inch cubes instead of shredding it. Skip the beans to minimize the total carbs in the recipe. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

Great tacos!!!! I made a few changes. I used a pork tenderloin, seasoned with salt and pepper and fajita seasoning, wrapped in foil and baked at 325 in oven for 2 1/2 hrs., then shredded it. I couldn't find the canned chipotle chilies but used Arriba fire roasted chipotle salsa (about 1/4 cup). I couldn't find tomatillo salsa so that was totally ommited, but used vine ripened chopped tomatoes. I made flour tortillas and also offered corn tortillas. The flour tortillas went first. My husband absolutely loved these and after finishing his dinner kept picking from the pan of meat. Squeezing the lime juice on top right before eating, really made this dish. It's easy and delicious. An absolute winner in my book and I grew up close to the Mexican border, eating a lot of mexican food. Yummmmmmm!

These were wonderful. A great alternative to ground beef tacos. They had just the right amount of spice. I didn't cook the roast long enough. Instead of putting it back in the oven I sliced the meat and put it in with the onions and finished cooking the meat before adding the other ingredients.

This is so yummy! I made it two days ago and have been having them for lunch since. I took some of the left over chipoltes (not all) and mixed them in the blender with about a cup of light mayo and 1/2 cup no fat sour cream to make a creamy chipolte sauce. The Chilis are very hot - do a taste test)Serve creamy sauce with tacos - Delicious!

These were great! I made them for the first time for a party and they were a hit. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used a boneless pork roast and baked at 300 for 4 hours. The meat did fall apart, but I found it a little on the dry side. I will definitely make these again.

Fantastic! I used bone-in pork loin and a little more Chipotle than called for. My husband ate 6 tacos the night I served them. I think they would be great with sour cream as well

Wow! These were fantastic! For added flavor and tender, moist meat, I first rubbed a boneless pork roast with jalapeno seasoning (jalapeno, salt, garlic, black pepper) and some ground red pepper. Then I wrapped it in foil to retain the moisture and cooked it at 300 F for 4 hours. The meat just falls apart. I retained some juice after skimming off the fat to add back after shredding the pork. I can't wait to make these again! Mmmmmm!

The whole family loved it. I followed the recipe without any changes. Next time I will try cooking the meat in the crock pot as suggested in another review.

AWESOME! This is a favorite dish, receiving rave reviews by family and friends. If you feel unhappy about using a good-quality roast to make tacos, try using country style pork-ribs. Just bake the ribs at about 350 degrees for a couple of hours to tenderize - then, shred and follow recipe. Enjoy!

Excellent! Very easy to prepare. Great flavor. Tortillas are best when heated quickly on a dry hot grill. Once pork is cooked, this takes so little time to prepare. This is definitely on the re-do list. Did I say how easy quick and easy the recipe is? You've gotta try it!

The tacos were fantastic! We used a pork butt that we had boiled and shredded for the meal the night before. I used Adobo salt to season the meat instead of just salt and pepper. Also, we heated the tortillas in a frying pan rather than heating up the house with the oven. The result was very tasty...

Rating: 4
These tacos are wonderful! I freeze the chipoles, 1 Tblsp in each bag, so I always have them available for recipes. I also cook the pork butt in a slow-cooker and add one sliced onion, one can of Dr. Pepper (or Root Beer) and 1-1/2 cups BBQ sauce...turns out great. This recipe is a must- make and a keeper!

My fiance liked this recipe so much, he told his co-workers he would bring some in for them to try! I used Pork Shoulder, less chipotle peppers and only 1 onion. I also added a little bit of garlic salt and pepper. I have already made this twice in 1 week!

This simple dish is really good, but be careful with the chipotle chilies - they are really HOT!! The adobo sauce they come in is also extremely hot. I mistakenly put all the sauce from the can into the mix and Oh Boy! The tears were rolling. We used leftover pork tenderlion my husband had BBQ'd - I'm sure pork chops would work just as well.
