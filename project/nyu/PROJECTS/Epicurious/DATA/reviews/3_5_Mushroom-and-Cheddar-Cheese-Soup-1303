First, I admit to liking bold flavors. This isn't the soup for me. I used a good quality, extra sharp cheddar but found the taste bland.

Pretty good. Needs more cheese than it calls for though. Also, used some soup base instead of the salt.

Delicious but very rich.

Very good as it is here, but this time I used Washington State Creamery jalapeno cheese and it was outstanding.

Did not use dried porcini mushrooms, I will have to try that next time. Did use shiitake my grandma sent me which were wonderful with the soup. Make sure to use the cheddar cheese I believe that is what gives it the great taste with the rest of the ingredients.

Yum! This soup was wonderful. The only complaint (if it even qualifies as a complaint) is that the cheddar is "lumpy". But that's just cheddar! Yes, we will totally have this again... I'm craving it right now.

Excellent soup. Very easy to make and tasty. I made a couple of different soups and this one blew away the other mushroom soup.

I didn't like this soup, and after all the rave reviews, I expected to love it. It was the first time I have ever cooked with Porcini mushrooms, so maybe I just don't like that flavor. I would recommend that others try this recipe, as I am clearly in the minority.

This soup is wonderful, rich and earthy. I agree that it could use some more flour tho thicken it. Instead of more flour I used 4 egg yolks tempered with the soup first before I added them to the pot. It added more richness and flavour. Great recipe and easy too.

This was a very tasty soup. I thought it would be bland, but if you like mushrooms, you will love it. I took the advice of others and added more flour which was a mistake. I will not do that next time. It was too thick but I could have added too much (almost 1T). Great cold weather soup!

This soup was very tasty. I don't think I'll get 4 servings out of it though. I agree that it may need more flour to thicken it. All in all, a good, easy, fulfilling dinner.

WONDERFUL!! I RECEIVED NON STOP RAVES WHEN I SERVED THIS FANTASTIC SOUP AT A RECENT DINNER PARTY I HAD. MY HUSBAND WAS ONE OF THE RAVERS. I ADDED A LITTLE CAYENNE PEPPER FOR A LITTLE KICK.

My husband loves this! It could use a little more flour for thickening (or a little more simmering time), but it is very easy and very good.

This soup was great tasting and easy to prepare. I served it with a Merlot and fresh bread. This is a wonderful winter soup, hearty and flavorful.

I made a large pot of this of this wonderfull soup for our ski club last year and people are still talking about it! You may want to consider an alternative garnish of a small quantity of the green onion stems and crisp bacon.
