To the reviewers who say that this is not a "real" vasilopita. Not true. My mother's family (from the suburbs of Athens) makes this type of vasilopita -- a 1,2,3,4 cake scented with orange and lemon, topped with slivered almonds spelling out the year. My father's family, from the island of Chios, makes the more well-known tsoureki-style vasilopita (with yeast/mastixa/mahlepi). I have never heard of the smaller cake placed on top of a larger cake, or of it being cut served youngest to oldest (we do it oldest to youngest), but perhaps this is the way it is done in some other parts of greece.

I did make one modification. I dusted the entire cake with powdered sugar like a traditional Vasilopita.

We made this as our first attempt at making the traditional Greek New Year cake. After serving to my 100% Greek Mother-in-Law, she texted me the next day and asked if I could send more over for my Father-in-Law (also 100% Greek). That qualifies it as worth making again!

LISTEN MY FELLO GREEKS, I AGREE WITH YOU ALL, THIS IS NOT A "VASILOPTA" THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE NAME TO "ALMOND COFFEE CAKE", IF YOU HAVE THE REAL, TRUE RECIPE, GIVE IT UP, SEND IT IN!!! I WILL SEND IN MY RECIPE, WELL, MY DADS! FROM MY COOK BOOK "PAPA'S RECIPES..A GREEK/AMERICAN COOK BOOK" HE WAS KNOWN TO BE THE BEST BAKER IN TOWN AND AROUND THE COUNTRY! FROM 1947 TO 1971, HE SERVED CHICAGO/ILL. GREEK TOWN....

i MADE THIS CAKE LAST NIGHT TO RING IN THE NEW YEAR! IT WAS A BIT TOUGH IN THE BEGINNING, BUT I WANTED TO MAKE IT THE WAY YOUR RECIPES CALL FOR, GREAT CAKE, THANK YOU! I WILL MAKE MORE TO GIVE AS GIFTS, ONLY I WILL DO ONE CAKE 9x13, OR 7" ROUNDS FOR GIFT'S. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD WITH A LITTLE DUSTING OF POWDER SUGAR, OR TRY ONE OF THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES YOU GIVE! I AM GREEK, I NEVER HAD THIS CAKE, THE ONLY VASILOPITA I KNOW OF IS THE NEW YEARS BREAD. MY DAD (GREEK BAKER) WOULD MAKE WITH A COIN WRAPPED IN PARCHMENT PAPER INSERTED INTO THE DOUGH! THIS WAS/IS THE FAMILY CHOICE, BUT, WHEN THEY TRY THIS THEY WILL LOVE IT. ALSO, LIKE MOST OF GREEK RECIPES GO, THEY'RE ALL TIME COMSUMING, BUT, WORTH THE EFFORT!!! KRONYIA POLA 2011...

I was excited to see a Vasilopita recipe on epicurious, but I have to agree with the other reviewers that it missed the mark. For now, I'll stick to my old standby recipe at http://www.recipesource.com/ethnic/europ e/greek/vasilopita1.html

This is NOT a Vasilopita! It's more of some Americanized ethnic sounding tort. The timing of this recipe is off - January when we (Greeks) eat this. The tradition is wrong - everyone I've ever know serves a piece for the house, then oldest to youngest, however I'll let that one slide as traditions do vary from village to village and island to island. Nice try, but no cigar on this one.

I could not agree more with this review. I have no idea where Krystina Castella got this recipe from and what it is but a vasilopita it ain't. One could call it a "vasilopita-inflected-coffee-cake" or "two cakes one-on-top-of-the-other" or whatever else, but not a vasilopita. A vasilopita (depending on the part of Greece that it originates from) is a yeast bread or a dry cake. It always contains mastic, mahleb, and/or jest (orange or lemon) and, occasionally, the juice of an orange, but *never* the juice of a lemon. It might contain crushed walnuts (if made without yeast) or almonds and sesame seeds if it's made as a bread. And this whole bizarre thing of pouring part of the batter on top of the cakes half-way through the baking process? There is an easier way of tucking the coin in the cake: you wrap it in wax paper and knead it along with the dough or you add it to the batter right before you pour it into a pan. Or, after the cake is finished you turn it upside down, make a small slit, and hide the coin in there. I have seen strange renditions of Greek recipes before but this one is way out there in bizzarosphere...

I don't know what this is supposed to look like but it is decidedly NOT a vasilopeta. I'm Greek and I've been making the traditional new year's cake for a long time. This doesn't even come close. There's no yeast, mastic, sesame seeds which are traditional ingredients. There's mo lemon juice in vasilopeta. Vasilopeta is a labor of love, not a coffee cake. You make the dough, knead by hand, and let rest overnight. The smell of the cake in the oven is inexplicable. I would be happy to share my family recipe, but be prepared to work those arm muscles!
