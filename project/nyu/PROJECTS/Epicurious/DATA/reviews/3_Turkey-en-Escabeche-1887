This is a spectacularly beautiful and delicious recipe, perfect for entertaining during the hot months. Also worth 4 forks with the following adjustments: 1) My turkey breast half was 2 and 3/4 lbs and all the ingredient amounts were perfect except for the vinegar, which I cut down to 1/3 cup only. I didn't add the last few Tablespoons at the end because it was zippy enough and I didn't want to spoil it. 2) I used UNSEASONED rice wine vinegar because it's mild. 3) Use Goya or another Spanish olive oil. 4) Consider wrapping peppercorns/allspice berries in cheesecloth so your guests don't choke! 5) My husband liked this better the second time I made it with half red, half green bell pepper. 6)I added 2 garlic cloves sliced thin during initial cooking. 7) In place of the vinegar at the end I added 1 T rinsed capers and 10 pitless green olives, sliced. 8) Keep testing this with an instant read thermometer. At 170, it's done. I served this along side of asparagus topped with some of the cooking liquid and we swooned with delight.

First time I made this dish, my daughter-in-law came to dinner. First question she had is are you going to heat this up. She wanted it hot and I told her that it would be served at room temperature, and she could heat her portion if she wanted. She loved it as it was. Have made frequently for summer parties--serves beautifully.
