I made cheese using this recipe for my New York-Italian fiance and he was really impressed. He even said it was better than the cheese we got at an Italian restaurant recently. It was easy but I think it does take some practice to get it just right. Also, i was able to get curd at Central Market and Whole Foods has it too.

Apparently it's not available through the Epicurious site anymore - at least not so far as I can find it. You can either make the curd, or buy it. Try Google.com for curd recipes - to buy curd, try these guys (I make no promises about them - I just found them through a cursory web search). You can also find beginning-to-end cheese making kits via Google. www.todarobros.com/cheese_products.asp www.dibruno.com/Search.bok?keyword=Mozzarella+Curd

there is nothing to compare with fresh mozzarella! it's great to make it yourself because nobody is putting salt in at the deli's any more. you can put the salt into the final bath too... gives it a little taste without getting too much if you can't have much salt.

didn't make it yet, but i think mozzarella curds are made from adding rennet or similar enzymes to the milk. I read somewhere that producers of fresh mozzarella wear rubber gloves to keep the heat off the skin. also plunging and replunging hands in cold water slows down the process, i think this might affect the quality of the cheese.

I cut my ingredients in half and added about 3/4 cup of salt to the boiling water. The results were quite good, a nice soft cheese with good texture and a nice taste. I got a good tip from a young man at a local gourmet shop. He told me to partically thaw the curd, cut that into cubes, and put that into the boiling water. Remove that from the stove and pour it into an other bowl. let that sit until the curd becomes stringy and have at it. It worked great

After seeing this recipe on Epicurious TV, I've been trying to make the curd myself. I finally found this COMPLETE recipe for mozzarella cheese (including the curd making): http://fiascofarm.com/dairy/mozzarella.htm There's a lot of info. on cheesemaking on that website and others. I just bought a thermometer with a corded sensor at my local scientific supply company, and I'm "trying it again." I plan to try making various cheeses, and maybe invent some of my own.

People should really look at the main page. The link for fresh mozzerella curd is plainly shown.

I couldn't agree with the prior reviewer more. Why place a recipe on the site that cannot be tried because you have not identified a source for one or more of the ingredients (mozzarella curd)? I'm very interested in making fresh mozzarella but have not located any source for the curd.

Most people cannot get the mozzarella curds, I've looked and asked. Then the expense is more then you may think. Also, only experienced cooks would try to handle hot cheese and then place their hands in cold water to releave the heat. It would be better to use a seive or large slotted spoon.The receipe should have a link where to get the mozzarella curd.
