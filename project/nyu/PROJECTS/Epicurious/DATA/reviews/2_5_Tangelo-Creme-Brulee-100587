I Was never able to get this to set. Is it because it's lacking an ingredient for custard? The taste was definetely there.

I was disappointed in this recipe, because I was looking forward to a low-fat treat. The citrus was odd with the egginess of the recipe. Even my husband gave me a strange look when he tasted it. I just think that a low-fat creme brulee is difficult to create.

This is a lovely light dessert, perfect to follow a rich meal. The second time I made it I took the extra step of straining the custard mixture (and adding the zest last). This improved the texture, making it absolutely silky. It never seems to quite set up as described in the recipe, but if it did it would likely be rubbery, so just go by the time specified. As for adding cream to this recipe, I think it would curdle anyway. The texture and flavour are perfect without it, even if the recipe is a little unconventional. Highly recommended!

Such an easy recipe! Low in fat & high in flavor :) A definite crowd pleaser!

By definition Creme Brulee is made with cream. I think this recipe must be missing that ingredient. I admit that I haven't made this particlar recipe but would add cream if I did.

This was horrible!!!! I cooked it for longer than the recipe said and it still did not set up. It was runny and inedible.

I'd make it again - but with a little less sugar - I found it too sweet even for me (that's really unusal)!
