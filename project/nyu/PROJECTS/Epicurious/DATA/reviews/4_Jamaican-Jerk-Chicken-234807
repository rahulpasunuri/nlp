I can't rate the recipe because I decided to use a jar of jerk seasoning. BUT I learned from this recipe that catsup is an ingredient that isn't in the jar. So I mixed chicken parts with the jerk seasoning and catsup, let it sit overnight in the frig, and then baked (I was using boneless chicken breast pieces for a buffet and needed easy-to-eat-with-a-fork food. The catsup mellowed and sweetened the spices and it was deliciious.

Excellent recipe, got rave reviews from all it was served too at our first ever Jamaican inspired Lunch. I didn't have the specified Chili here in Australia, so used a hot red chili instead, and added some dried chili flakes to up the heat a bit. Personally, I would not bother making the ketchupy sauce again as everyone tried it and didn't end up putting it on their chicken, preferring the gorgeous natural marinated juiciness instead.. Just delicious, a definite keeper!

This is a very good recipe, just poorly written. First time I made it...got rave reviews from 30 poeple. As for authenticity, I'm sure 2 Jamaicans will argue about what constitutes the real thing. I was told it tastes just like the chicken at a shack in Jamaica. I adjusted a few ingredients and baked it at 450 degrees for 25 min. and then broiled it for 3 min. Perfect!

I have to tell you I am a frequent visitor to Jamaica and this recipe ROCKS!! It reminds me of coming out of the dance places at 3am and having the authentic Jerk chicken on the side of the road by the local COOKS! Great paired up with a dense bread to break the heat up!! LOVED IT!!

Chicken was juicy and flavorful, but I wasn't in love with the jerk seasoning. I did not have malt vinegar so substituted cider vinegar which may have been a fatal flaw... regardless I thought the sauce was too ketchupy.

I used habenero and, while I like spicy food, this was insanely hot. I made it for a guest and we were literally sweating eating it. I poured lime juice over the chicken,then slathered it with the jerk paste. The recipe said "remove from marinade" so I removed it from the lime juice but left on the jerk paste. Was I supposed to scrape off all the jerk paste before cooking? Or are you supposed to remove the skin with all the spicy heat before eating? I marinated it overnight, so maybe that added to making the dish so hot. Three adults had this for dinner and not one of us like the ketchup/soy/jerk sauce.

Well this was my first recipe from the Epicurious site and I have to say Im hooked! Great site. So anyway, I sub'd out 3 Habaneros for the 2 Scotch Bonnets.. I like the heat and didn't have the Bonnets. I also used boneless chicken thighs instead of boneless breast meat and slow cooked them on the grill. Towards the end I cranked up the heat to char them a bit and they came out very moist and tasty. After making the sauce I added it right to the chicken thighs and let it work for about 2-1/2 hours before grilling. However, I think my next shot at it I'm going to let the concoction stand overnight and marinate the chicken for a longer period of time. I served it with grilled veggies and a nice Chardonnay.

Amazing chicken. It seems as though everyone who gave it a bad review had an idea in their mind about how jerk chicken "should" taste before making it, and as a result were disappointed. Stop "shoulding" all over yourself and enjoy this as seasoned chicken! I add 2 tablespoons of dark brown sugar instead of teaspoons, makes it a little sweeter and delicious!

I do not understand all the great reviews. I thought this recipe was gross. I followed it exactly. The proportions were all wrong. Way too heavy on cinnamon and all spice. Tasted nothing like any jerk chicken I have ever had. Tons of work for a very disappointing result.

Wow. I read the directions wrong, did it wrong, and it still came out amazing. That's a great recipe! I didn't realize until I read the other reviews (after the chicken was already marinating) that the ketchup and soy sauce are supposed to be for the dipping sauce, and the rest of the ingredients are what you are supposed to marinate the chicken in. I was worried while it was chilling, but it came out fantastic! As other reviewers mentioned, it is very moist. I will definitely be making this one more often. But next time I will actually follow the directions.

This recipe is in high demand in our house and I'm always happy to comply, it's my favorite chicken recipe ever. Malt vinegar is an absolute - accept no substitute. More than one pepper with seeds is exceptionally hot; I usually just use one good size jalapeno and it has a mild kick. Make sure you read the recipe all the way through - one reviewer added the ketchup to the marinade - it's for the sauce. Also, another mentioned they wanted to marinade in the sauce...I think you missed a step. Anyhow, this recipe is so seriously winner, winner chicken dinner, not even a blustery winter evening could stop me from firing up the grill for this finger-lickin' Jerk. Fab!

My family did not like this version of jerk chicken. We prefer marinating in the sauce instead of just dipping. We ended up eating the chicken, which was very moist, by itself and saving the sauce, which I'll use as a marinade next time.

Good but not great ... I like the other just plain "Jerk Chicken" recipe better. I think that the ketchup might have been a part of the reason the marinade was a little too gloppy for my tastes.

Yum! Don't be afraid of the habaneros, it isn't too hot! Also, pay attention to the recipe, I added the ketchup and the soy to the blender - didn't make too much of a difference, I don't think! I cooked partially on the grill to blacken and then finished in the oven for convenience (too much snow outside!) I served with roasted yellow pepper grits from Bobby Flay, thought it was an excellent side with the sauce!

This Chicken is Great!!!!! I made it for the first time for 100 people.(multiplied x 12 ( I trusted the other reviews) and no one was disappointed! I left out he hot peppers for the part of the sauce and added extra for a hot version- this way no one was afraid to try it. Cooked it in a large convection oven- perfect! This is a keeper!!

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have malt vinegar so I used cider vinegar, and I used fresh ginger root instead of powder. I could have probably added an extra chile for the heat. In any case, this was really delicious and came out perfectly tender and juicy.

this was easy..and great results...did this recipe for 30 people using chicken breasts,,,baked right along with the marinade in a large baking pan (like a bakers pan with parchment)..the chicken was not dry and the sauce got raves,,could not find scotch bonnets..so used japalino (could have been hotter) was hot for some..

How do you boil the rum and water for three minutes without everything evaporating? Still, it was nice and juicy (cooked it in the oven).

I made this recipe as written with the exception of I cut down on the habeneros (I quintupled recipe) It was still spicy but those that liked heat, came back for more. This was my first taste of Jerk Chicken and I'm not a fan. Those that like jerk chicken took chicken home. I made chicken breasts instead of whole chicken and baked in oven. One guest had for his birthday the next day instead of going out to dinner.

The recipe calls for to much vinegar. I would cut it in half. Also, I would only use 1 teaspoon of Thyme. Thyme is a very strong herb. You don't need a lot of it. I would make it again but change the proportions of the ingrediants.

We particulary loved the sauce, but it has to sit a day. I would consider heating it up to eat with the chicken, leftovers make great bbq sauce. I wasn't particular about the malt vinegar, I used my own chipotle vinegar instead (another recipe on this site) and also "only" used one jalapeno pepper instead of the two habaneros - and we do like it hot normally, but this was quite hot enough.

Outstanding, even when you screw up. I misread the recipe, and blended all the ingredients together, instead of making the separate sauce. It was excellent, and that's the way we make it now.

This marinade is sensational! I make double the marinade recipe and freeze it in small portions , since it can be a pain to make. This is fantastic on fish as well - I have used the sauce (with the ketchup and soy) on Tilapia and grilled / broiled it several times- always a crowd pleaser.

I've made this at least 8 times, always turns out well. Marinate at least overnight, I usually marinate a day and a half myself. As for grilling technique, I prefer to put it on very high heat on top of a sheet of foil (shiny side down) for about 20 minutes, not touching it, then covering it with foil (shiny side up) and turning the heat down very low and letting it roast for about an hour or two. Turns out very moist with a nice skin.

Made this serveral times. The longer you marinate the better. Don't let the amount of pepper's scare you. My grandmother loved it and she's not one that like spicy food. Also, don't be surprised your neighbor's peek their head over the wall, you can smell this miles away! Marinade works well on other meets as well but, chicken is my favorite.

I made this recipe along with the Caribbean Rice and Bean Salad on this site for about 30 people for the Caribbean festival weekend in Notting Hill. It was a HUGE hit. I doubled the recipe and used around 30 chicken breasts. I had a friend helping me and she accidentally added the ketchup to the marinade, basically combining the sauce and marinade. It still turned out great and seems to be a forgiving recipe. We also don't have a blender and did not blend before marinating overnight. We used apple cider vinegar and added more garlic and grilled on a George Forman grill. I'll definitely make this again.

I thought this was decent but not worth the effort and amount of ingredients and not as delicious as a Calypso pork recipe (with rum) that I already love. For those who you know already love jerk - this might be a good choice, but otherwise it is not the ideal choice for a dinner party since the spicy flavors are potentially not for everyone. Although everyone ate up their portion at my dinner party, I found myself wishing I had just done a simple roasted herb chicken that would have been a lot simpler. Also, the sauce did not do anything for me...I ended up not even serving it with the chicken. Maybe this would have been better had I grilled it?

I loved this recipe. I made it with skinless chicken breasts and it turned out delicious and was lower in fat. I baked it in the oven. Next time I'll definitely cook it on the grill. It would look prettier. We sliced the leftovers and ate them cold on top of a green salad the next day. Yum.

I must have done something wrong? Although I've reviewed the recipie many times and cannot figure out what my error could have been. The color of my chops (instead of chicken) and marinade were an unappealing murky brown color. The marinade was almost chalky with all of the spices. Only 1 of 7 guests thought of this dish as okay. Not even interested enough in trying it again....

This was hot - and delicious! We kept some of the sauce and mixed it in with rice (for the chicken we marinated breasts of chix in this sauce then put them on the grill). The sauce is hot and I'm glad we saved some for the rice since the chix didn't maintain the same "heat" with how we prepared. I am keeping this as a new recipe to make again and again!

Delicious and very authentic. I would add more heat next time, but that's a matter of taste. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested rubbing the marinade under the skin- I think that probably boosted the flavor. We used bone-in skin-on breasts instead of the halved chickens and they came out very moist and flavorful.

Wowsers, is this fantastic or what?! I have made many jerk recipes and this is by far the very best...no need to look any further! I was skeptical because of the ketchup, but it created the base of a very delicious sauce which I gently warmed before serving, so please don't discount this recipe because of the use of everyday, mundane ketchup. After all, the sauce is optional and may be omitted, but I think it added another layer of distinctive flavour not to be missed. Based on my previous recipes, I must confess to a few changes/additions: used chicken thighs/drums as well as pork chops, apple cider vinegar in place of malt, increased garlic to 6 cloves, red Thai chilies instead of bonnet or habaneros (only because that is what I had on hand and they provided ample heat), used a combo of 1 tbsp. veg. oil and 1 tbsp. toasted sesame oil, added 2 tsp. ground cloves, generously added fine lime zest to both the jerk seasoning and the sauce (why waste/miss out on that flavour boost?), and decreased ketchup to 3/4 cup. Marinated for 6 hours and grilled on a gas BBQ. Tasty to the max, moist, juicy and tender. This is a blue ribbon recipe in every way and one that truly meets the criteria of "a dish beyond compare"!

We were worried about how hot this would be and so did not put in the seeds of the pepper. It was tasty - but not hot enough! Really nice blend of flavors though, and even though we are cautious of super-spicy foods, we wouldn't change the recipe next time.

This recipe is really fantastic - I have made it several times - but as i live in a high-rise condo (no BBQ allowed)- i would suggest raising the oven temp to at least 375, or you'll end up waiting all night. Also, if you want the jerk to really penetrate, i found rubbing it under the skin of breasts (with wings) has been very successful.

OK...Jerk chicken is supposed to be spicy. Don't make this if you or your family don't like spicy food. I've used several recipes in the past and only tweaked this one slightly by doubling the habaneros. It wasn't spicy enough to blow my head off. In fact, it was just right. Habaneros can be tricky though so be careful. I did cook it on a grill as that's a traditional preparation. I'd have to say this is the best recipe I've tried by far. The flavors are authentic and everyone that's tried it really enjoyed it. I'm making this again tomorrow and can't wait!

I don't like bland chicken recipes, so this recipe made me happy with the spicy flavor picked up by the meat. I've made it a few times so far and prefer cooking the chicken on a hot BBQ instead of in the oven. The BBQ crispy skin and slightly smoky flavor really made a nice meal. I found that overnight marinade didn't make a large difference when compared to 4 hours of marinade. I served the chicken with "dirty rice" and vegetable.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but my family thought it was too hot. I may seed the chilies next time. I actually made a mistake when I was making the marinade. I put the ketchup and the soy sauce in the marinade. I think next time I will make the sauce, as the recipe says, but I will still put some ketchup in the marinade. I baked the chicken for about 45-50 minutes (140 degrees), then finished it off on the grill. It saved a lot of time standing and watching the grill. The chicken was very moist and delicious and made enough to feed a crowd. I served it with grilled plantains.

I have spent a lot of time in Jamaica - and had the most mouth-watering jerk at the roadside stands there. This recipe is the closest I have found to the authentic flavor. Serve with some rice and peas and collards (I couldn't find callaloo)! Toppa toppa mon! I'm going to try pork next time.
