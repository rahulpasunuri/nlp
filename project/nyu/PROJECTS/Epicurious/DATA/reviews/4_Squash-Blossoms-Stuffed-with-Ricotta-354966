Great recipe! As others, I used store-bought marinara and substituted basil for the mint. I would also recommend piping the filling into the blossoms  much easier than spooning. I simply used a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off.

Love this recipe. My blossoms were pretty dainty, but the dish was spectacular. Like others, I skipped the tomato sauce. I did half ricotta and half goat cheese and switched out mint for basil.

Delicious! I used plain goat cheese and basil. The flowers were a little difficult and messy to stuff, but I managed and they didn't fall apat in the oil. Didn't make the tomato sauce--they were really rich though, so maybe the sauce would've cut the richness a bit. Next time. . .

These were great. Not hard to make either. I too left off the tomato sauce. They were great on their own. If we hadn't had these the night we had the mahi mahi tacos we would have starved

So good, but even better with a lemon aioli!

These are great! I used basil in place of mint and they were really good. We didn't make the sauce and they were really good, but I like the idea of it with a sauce better. Making this again tonight with basil and then a simple sauce of garlic sauteed with canned tomatoes and a bit of crushed red pepper flakes.

I don't know how you could go wrong with this recipe! I didn't even have a deep fry thermometer, just a candy thermometer. I added fresh basil to the mint just because we had both fresh in the garden. We didn't bother with the tomato sauce either. It seems the negative reviews all had more to do with technique than flavor. Just twist the top of the flower, fold down, and secure with toothpicks. None of mine fell apart--they looked perfect. My husband went nuts for them.

This was our first attempt at making our own stuffed squash blossoms. We found some at the farmers' market. Made the blossoms exactly according to the recipe. We didn't make the sauce though and instead used some marinara sauce that we had on hand. The batter was very light and tasty, and the mint in the stuffing added a nice flavor. Would definitely use this recipe again.

I didn't even make the tomato sauce and this was great. I found the mint in the filling to be a unique addition that paired very well with the blossom flavor. The filling escaped from a couple of mine when being lifted out of the batter, but mostly they worked perfectly.

good recipe - i made the squash blossoms only. they were far better than other recipes i've tried in the past and it is hard to find one. i added basil and parsley as recommended, since i had them in the garden. i did not have ricotta so i used goat cheese which i had on hand, which went well with the herbs and lent a little more flavor - be careful not to over stuff! i had one or two fall apart. i fried in the bottom of my wok and did not use anywhere near 3 cups of oil.....

The batter was nice and light - I think they could have used a little more flavor in the stuffing. However, I had leftover stuffing and added some flour and made some free-form gnocchi to go with the blossoms!

Fantastic!! I served these as 1 of 7 courses last night for a group of friends. I used basil and parsley instead of mint. The batter reminded me of tempura, which I have always chilled before dipping veggies, so I did chill the batter for about 15 min before dipping, and frying. They looked just like the picture, and tasted heavenly. sauce was great too, but I blanched and seeded my tomatoes prior, and pureed it after. TIP: DON"T overstuff the flower! AND, don't skimp on the oil, they kinda sink into the pot, and had a tendency to want to stick.

I found squash blossoms at the farmers market and then I looked for a recipe because I had no idea how to use them. This did not work out as planned at all, but it was still tasty in the end. As soon as I put the first one in the oil it completely fell apart, so instead of subjecting the whole batch of blossoms to the same horrible fate, I gently sauteed them instead. They still fell apart somewhat, and they were very limp and not good for picking up. I just served the whole mess of them over pasta. I used the tomato sauce too, which I thought was actually the yummiest part of the whole thing. I think next year I'll find a different recipe for the flowers. I'm not giving a fork rating for this because I think a rating can only be given fairly when the recipe is followed closely, which I obviously didn't end up doing.

Yummy, we made the tomato sauce, however we ended up not using it. They were really tasty on their own.

easy, simple and good. Used fresh basil instead of mint. Served it as a main course adding chopped & sauteed zucchini, yellow squash and onion to the tomato sauce.
