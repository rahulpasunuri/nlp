Pretty good for a quick, light dessert. I made it using red and black plums. For the syrup, I subbed honey with light agave, used only a couple tbsps of brown sugar, and added a splash of apple juice. It was very sweet... I'll def cut down the sugar next time, or maybe not use any at all. I topped the plums with plain greek yogurt (flavored with a squeeze of agave and tspn of vanilla extract). Very tasty!

We love these plums! My grandmother says she could eat the sauce with cardboard (the sauce did come out somewhat caramel-y, but not hard or chewy, it was just perfect). This is a dish I would happily eat every single day

This is an excellent summer dessert, tasty and easy. The goal is to soften the fruit and create a thick carmal sauce. Everyone I have served it to has asked for the recipe!

Considering the utterly minimal amount of time, effort and expense involved, this is terrific. After making it, I'm confused by other cooks' references to "caramel"; my sauce remained quite liquid and I followed the instructions exactly. Maybe my plums were extremely juicy or theirs were very dry. In any case, I can see this becoming one of my regular desserts, even for company. The sauce is very sweet, but the creme fraiche cuts through it. The thyme is a perfect complement to all.

Easy, impressive - consider adding a few tablespoons amaretto or liqueur to keep the caramel from gettinh too hard. Also good with the addition of a teaspoon of vanilla paste.

Probably one of the tastiest desserts we've made in a while. Would be fantastic with homemade ice-cream substituted for the cream fraiche. Will keep this one on hand for when we have people to impress!

The flavours were delicious, but I found that when I made this recipe the caramel sauce was more like hard candy. I could not notice any flavour from the thyme, either. In future, will make a very similar but easier recipe of mine instead.

Delicious. I used two different types of plums - red and black - and it looked very pretty. The sauce is a beautiful reddish-purple color, and the dish presented well. I made my own creme fraiche and added just a tablespoon on each half of a plum. The tartness of the plums combined with the sweetness of the sauce and the creaminess of the creme fraiche was really excellent. I easily expanded this recipe to serve eight people. The one recommendation that I would make is to make the plums in batches, or to heat the skillet before adding any ingredients - The skillet that I used was not heated for long enough and the uneven heat caused some of the plums to be more cooked than others.

This is the best non0chocolate dessert I have ever had...much less made. And it is so easy! I used 3 varieties of plums which made it interesting visually. You must try this one!

Delicious! I don't normally think of thyme as an herb to use with desserts, but it complimented the other flavors in this dish beautifully. I'll definitely make this dish again, but next time I'll be careful not to cook the caramel for too long; it turned into more of a hard candy than a sauce! Still very good.

This was incredible. Ridiculously incredible,esp.considering i only made it because i had some older, mushy plums and the remainder of a bunch of thyme languishing in vain hopes for a better purpose. i halved the recipe and it worked beautifully. And i served it with yogurt cause i didn't have creme fraiche. Delicious, easy, inexpensive- what's not to love?

This was so easy to make and a hit with my family. Definately a recipe for the dessert hall of fame.
