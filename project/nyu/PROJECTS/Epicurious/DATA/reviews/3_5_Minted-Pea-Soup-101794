Followed the recipe but with a few changes. Instead of cream I used sheep's milk yoghurt as my wife is avoiding cow dairy products. I also believe that this is a MINTED pea soup so I went large on the fresh garden mint we have in the garden and put in 1.5 cups packed of mint. The result was fantastic. Guest, my kids, and wife loved it! Will make this a keeper.

The perfect starter for my Easter Dinner. I took everyone's advice and used about 1/2 mint leaves. I strained the soup and used 1/2 cup each cream and nonfat Greek yogurt and served the soup chilled in glass mugs with a mint leaf on top. Delicious.

This is a great summer recipe. I don't always use cream, sometimes I substitute whole milk. It's very simple and pairs great with a quiche and a salad.

Such a simple and tasty recipe! My husband and I liked this soup a lot. I did not strain the soup because we like a heartier texture. Also used yogurt instead of heavy cream to reduce the fat. I'm sure the soup would come out creamier with the full fat cream, but it's very fresh and tasty with lower fat substitutes too.

I ended up adding much more mint (about another 1/2 cup), as either my mint (grown on the terrace) wasn't pungent enough or the recipe needs more of it, but I could hardly taste it in the almost-finished soup. Otherwise it's a quick, easy to make and wonderful starter.

I used 1/2 fresh peas (which are so sweet) and 1/2 frozen. I would have used all fresh next time. Mint 1/3 cup and thick Greek style non-fat yogurt (from Trader Joe) w/ 2 Tblsp marscapone. Served warm. Thanks for advice on mint everyone!

Really tasty! Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't stain it because I prefer a heartier soup too. I used all yogurt (greek style) instead of cream. And pureed it in the pot with a hand blender. Quick and easy--I was able to make it as my 2 yr old played in the kitchen!

This is probably the best pea soup I have EVER had. I can't believe how good it is considering it was so easy to make! I also used a loosely packed cup of mint leaves, strained everything out, and then added in little mint pieces just before serving it. This was served as part of a seven course formal dinner, and was a very strong soup course. Fantastic, you must try it!

This is a really nice spring/summer garden recipe. I agree the cup of mint seems over the top - I just added it to taste - think it was probably 1/2 a cup. Needs to be served really cold.

This soup is so easy and delicious--great for summer. I eat it as an everyday soup for lunches, and for that I use more yogurt than cream and skip straining it so that it's heartier.

I served this soup chilled, in small, stemmed glasses, prior to Easter brunch. It was delicious, pretty and everyone loved it. I did pay attention to the reviews about too much mint flavor, so I just used a loosely packed scant cup. Also, straining the soup to your desired consistency is important. I left small flakes of mint in, and liked that very much. With a smaller sieve, it could be strained even further, to your taste. Also, this soup was just as good the next day, so it's a good make ahead. Easy to make. Recommended recipe.

I thought this recipe was really good. The way it turns out depends on the quality of your stock.

I made this recipe a few days ago. If I were to make it again. I would cut down on the mint, serve it hot and use more peas. It tasted like Wrigley Spearmint gum in a liquid format.

It was good. Guests loved it. Next time I will cut back on the amount of mint.

I have made this soup for Easter lunch two years in a row now. The second year my guests were asking weeks in advance if I was going to have "that pea soup thing". It is easy and absolutely delectable. Wow!

Mah God. What a mighty awful recipe this is. I wouldn't feed it to mah dog. When I poured this into the soup bowl, it looked like something that had come out of mah nose. Hell, I liked English cooking, but now ah ain't so sure.

Easy, healthy, really delicious...it's on our monthly rotation of regular meals. I use whole milk yogurt, no cream.

I added 1/2 teasp. sugar when cooking peas, and cooked them covered by 1/2 a lettuce which was also blended together with peas. Delicious!
