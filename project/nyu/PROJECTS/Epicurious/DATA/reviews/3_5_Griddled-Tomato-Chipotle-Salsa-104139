Great salsa. I roasted the tomatoes under the broiler on a sheet of foil for easy cleanup. Great on eggs and as a dip for tortilla chips. Our friends all loved it. I did find that the recipe only made about two cups, though.

I took the advice of one of the reviewers and blackened the tomatoes under the broiler and it worked just fine. I used 4 jalapeno's and 1 serrano chili as we like it with a kick. Next time I'll use a bit less lime juice tasting as I go b/c I think it was too limey but everyone LOVED it anyway. It had a nice smokey flavor to it. I pureed the canned chipotles and added it to the sauce and I think that is the secret to its roasted flavor. A most excellent salsa that was devoured by my dinner guests as a dip for chips as well as the topping on the tamales! This is a keeper. My husband and I put it on our morning omelet the next day! Very Yummy.

This is a delicious salsa. My husband, who doesn't normally care for tomato-based salsas, says this is now his favorite salsa. I blackened my tomatoes on the grill. Used 2 seeded jalapenos instead of 4 and it still had plenty of kick for me. Didn't have chipotle chile puree so I just added 2 tablespoons of chipotle chile in adobe to the mixture in the food processor and blended everything, then added the lime juice, cilantro and salt. I'll definitely make this again.

Don't ruin your cast iron cookware by charring acidic tomatoes this way. I found it impossible to remove the burnt residue from a favorite cast iron skillet (which was VERY well seasoned). Plus, it was very smoky. Not worth the effort since the end result was only mediocre anyway. Try charring the tomatoes in the broiler or on a grill if you try this recipe.

My husband LOVES Chevy's salsa and said that this recipe comes very close to Chevy's. I think the salsa gets better over time so it is best to do a day or two in advance. I will certainly make this again!

You just have to buy the canned chipotles in adobo and puree them. At least I haven't seen them sold any other way, but I am in a smaller town.

Does anyone know where to find chipotle chili puree? I only see canned chipotle chilis in adobo sauce in the ethnic food section. Thanks.

This was excellent. I have tried other salsas, but the smokiness of this and the garlic flavour was outstanding. It reminds me of the version from Chevy's only better.

Although I did not make this recipe according to the exact specifications (I cut it down to about a third because I only wanted to make about 1 cup), it was absolutely delicious!!!! I actually added about a teaspoon of sugar to make it sweeter. It tasted even better after two days in the refrigerator. I will definitely make this again.
