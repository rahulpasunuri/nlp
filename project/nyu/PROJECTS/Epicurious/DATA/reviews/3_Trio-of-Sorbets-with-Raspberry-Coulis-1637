I made just the coulis part of this recipe ( to serve with a cheesecake). Everyone raved about it.

I just made the Kiwi sorbet. Needed to salvage some over ripe Kiwis. I did not strain the kiwi, just blenderized and mixed in with the syrup. Put iit in the ice cream machine for 25 minutes and it was perfect. Not too tart or sweet. I will never throw out another Kiwi!

I made the banana sorbet and a mixed berry coulis. I thought they were OK, but not great. It was all too sweet for me. The sorbet was very banana-y, but I didn't like the consistency that much. It didn't freeze too well. I don't think it paired well with the berry coulis which would have gone much better with vanilla ice cream, I think.

I made the banana and the apricot sorbets: both were delicious and received tremendous praise. Neither turned into a frozen consistancy like ice cream does in the ice cream maker. But both froze hard in the freezer. The apricot taste "fresh" and was sublime. The banana sorbet did also.

I only made the banana sorbet part of this recipe. I needed a banana sorbet recipe and this is what appeared when I searched. But the banana sorbet is delightful! I doubled the recipe to feed eight people, and served it with the Dark-Rum Caramel Sauce (also in Epicurious files) and the Chile-Macadamia Nut Brittle on top. It was a tremendous hit! Each component -- the banana sorbet, the rum-caramel sauce and the nut brittle -- would be great by themselves or in any combo. The sorbet is amazingly rich, even though it has no dairy (but it does have egg yolks). A winner!
