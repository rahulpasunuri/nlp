holy moly this was good. Honey instead of syrup, cod instead of salmon and no scallions or mustard seeds and it was still great. Especially by getting the little crusty parts of the fish out of the pan with the sauce. Was a generous amount of sauce which was super.

this is DELICIOUS and i'm so happy i stumbled on it. i followed the recipe exactly and i wouldn't change a thing. this is my new favorite salmon recipe, i'll be making it often. i served it with brown rice (with leftover glaze drizzled on top) and sauteed spinach. PERFECTION and the whole thing was done in 20 mins. perfect for a fantastic weeknight meal.

Very nice. I left out the mustard seeds.The texture of my pan-seared salmon was sublime, which I think is due to the quality of the fresh wild salmon, a good hot sear, and the perfect timing. The sauce is yummy. I served it with rice pilaf and barely sauteed fresh spinach. Beautiful!

This was a delicious and very flavorful salmon, quick to prepare. The sauce was exceptional. It's a keeper.

I liked this very much. I agree, however, that the salmon is better baked. Also, it says to let the pan cool for one minute... I'd let it cool for slightly longer.

Lots of flavor here! The mustard, maple and scallions really complement the taste of the salmon. I did broil the salmon for a few minutes with the sauce over it.

My husband and I have made this dish many times and loved it. We went to visit my sister and she had this for dinner and had been making ever since it published, too. Really tasty and easy to make.

The sauce was the highlight of the meal. I baked the salmon instead which gave it a nicer texture. It is also goood to reduce the sauce alot to goive it a nice texture. Used mustard with grains in it also giving a nice texture.(Use high quality mustard and maple syrup so stay away from aunt betty's and frenchies lol)

Neither of us liked the texture of the sauteed salmon. Would be better if grilled, I think (or grill pan on top of stove). Sauce was OK but not thrilling. I left out the mustard seeds because I thought that uncooked (well, barely) they would be too crunchy and raw. I might consider making again if I tweaked it.

Good recipe. Quick, easy and great flavor. I didn't have mustard seeds so I used 3 tablespoons of Country Dijon which is grainy.

Using what I had, I made the sauce of Anna Mae's Smoky mustard - the BEST (www.robertrothschild.com) plus orange honey, garlic and thyme, simmering for a few minutes. Briefly cooked salmon skin side up then flipped and spread sauce on, putting on a lid so it essentially baked on the stovetop. Almost four forks, quick and easy.

Niceky balanced flavors - neither to astringent nor too sweet. It took only a few minutes to make. Although generally not a fan of fried salmon ( or other fried fish for that matter) this recipe has encouraged me to try other similar recipes.

Great flavour and so quick and easy to prepare. It wasnt too sweet and the mustard seeds provided nice flavour and texture to the sauce. A good quality dijon mustard balances the sweetness of the maple syrup (a lesser quality mustard may require less maple). It was perfect just as written.

Very easy and wonderful of flavor change for salmon.

This made a great, quick, and interesting salmon dish. My husband complained about the texture of the mustard seeds, but loved the taste. I would reduce maple syrup next time since I don't want it too sweet, but it is a nice foil for the mustard. Very good!

This was a nice easy recipe for a midweek dinner. I did broil the salmon for 10 minutes instead of saute. I also made the sauce, then poured it over the salmon and broiled for 2-3 minutes more. The salmond turned out very tasty.

I usually make the soysauce and maple syrup recipe for salmon, but my sister is allergic to soy. This was a great replacement, and she and my boyfriend both really liked it. I would warm up the sauce next time, as suggested by another cook, since it was a little to chilly at room temperature. Went well with garlic mashed potatoes and brown sugar carrots. Very tasty, and pretty. If you don't have access to good salmon though, it's not going to taste as yummy as it should.

This recipe was fast and delicious. Whipping the sauce up while the fish is cooking it took a total of 15 minutes. I warmed the sauce in the hot pan after the fish was done. Make extra sauce, you'll want to keep deeping in it!

I added lime juice to the sauce as I found it to be too sweet. We all loved it!

Absolutely phenomenal dish! I served it over angel hair. The perfect blend of all ingredients!

This dish was not very interesting. The sauce was very ordinary, similar to the standard commercial honey-mustard sauce. I wouldn't consider preparing this for a dinner party. If you're looking for something appropriate for company, try the recipe for Mustard Seed Crusted Salmon with Mustard Cream Sauce (found on this site). That recipe is phenomenal!!!

My Fiance hates salmon but LOVED this dish. I will definately make it again

This is super good and super easy. I make it exactly as the recipe calls for, as the ingredients are standard fare in my kitchen, and I can't imagine how I could make it any easier. My family loves it, and even though we almost always choose to grill our salmon, this is a terrific alternative.

What a simple yet utterly delicious recipe. The family all love it. I do exactly as the recipe calls for. Making it again tonight. (third time in a month).

This recipe was easy and pretty tasty. I also sauted the green onions and garlic for a couple of minutes before adding the rest of the sauce. I thought the mustard - maple taste was just right as written, not too sweet or too savory.I also grilled the salmon with some of the sauce on top for about ten minutes instead of pan frying it...FYI a great way to grill fish with a skin on it: poke holes in tin foil and place it on grill. Grill fish on tin foil, skin side down. When fish done, slide spatula between fish and skin and remove fish to plates. Throw away foil.. no muss no fuss!

I just made this tonight for a quick supper. My New Year's Resolution was to eat and cook more fish. I bought 2 6 oz filets today at the store, and just picked this recipe out tonight right before starting dinner. Boy, am I glad I did! Super easy, took 15 mins to make the whole dinner. I didn't have mustard seeds, so I used my grainy dijon - seemed to work fine. Also replaced scallions with green onion (used what I had!). My husband liked it and we both agreed it was nice enough to make for company. Paired it with a salad, some crusty french bread, and shrimp cocktail. Perfect Monday night supper.

A good stove top way to prepare salmon fillet. mustard/maple combination makes a tasty sauce. I used less oil by brushing the fish instead of putting oil in pan.

Yes, salmon was on sale in the DC area so I also made this last night and I completely agree with the previous reviewer - UGH! I'm so disappointed -this is the first time I've had such an utter failure on a highly-regarded recipe.

Rating: 1
Salmon was on sale, so I figured I'd try this. Ugh. I was able to fix it, but it took some work. But if you want to make it: (1) Broil the salmon instead of sauteing. It flakes too much on stovetop unless you've got PERFECT filets. (2) It needed some lemon juice, which helped a lot. (3) The sauce is too sweet, even with the lemon juice. Cut back on the maple, add lemon juice in place of half the water, use stock for the other half.

Very tasty, and because its so easy, it gets a 4. Used two very large fillets, and all the sauce. Used extra maple too. Cooks very fast.Sauteed the garlic and scallions first @1-2min, then added rest of ingredients.

I found this recipe to be easy and tasty. I did not have any green onions so I substituted for white onions. I also brought the sauce to a boil in a small sauce pan and let stand to cook the onions and garlic. After removing the Salmon from the pan, I still placed the sauce into the pan as the recipe indicated. I only had two salmon steaks and used all the sauce...so I agree also on the small amount of sauce for 4 salmon steaks.

Health nut variation...with 3/4 pound salmon filet for two, bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes instead of prepping on the stove. Then substitute sugar free syrup for the real thing, and add a touch more garlic and mustard seed. Throw sauce in a sauce pan over low-med heat for 10 minutes, then spoon over baked fish. Please note, I am POSITIVE this isn't as good as the recipe as given. But without the vegetable oil and the sugar from real syrup, it's still really good, and comes out to 300 calories per person (sauce is free!!!)

This is a great quick recipe. I bought some salmon today but didn't know what I was going to do with it, so I searched and found this. I had all the ingredients (except green onions) in my pantry. I substituted a bit of red onion for the green onions. It made the sauce a bit more onion-y, but being an onion lover, that's fine with me. I served it with some sauteed sugar snap peas. Fantastic!

This recipe was fast, light, and yummy. I broiled the fish for 8 minutes and heated the sauce. Would probably double the sauce next time. Too bad there were no left overs, but it is so quick and easy to make, it doesn't matter. Served it with a mixture of wild rice and brwon rice, and a spinach salad with hearts of palm, artichokes, and clementines.

LOVED THIS RECIPE. Used on 1 inch plus thick pork chops instead of salmon. Seared the chops in a pan for a couple of minutes, placed chops in the oven in a roasting pan for about 1/2 hour. Used chicken broth in addition to the water to my desired taste and consistency. Dee-lish!

Very easy to make - rich, filling and yummy. Can be made in a snap on a busy weeknight or for a dinner party where you don't want to miss out on the action. I served it with mixed field greens and spicy maple candied walnuts and some crusty French bread.

Simple and delicious. At first I thought it might be to heavy on the mustard flavor, but it was not. The maple sauce balanced out the mustard and gave it a little sweet taste. I made the sauce in a separate skillet because I was afraid the skillet the salmon was cooked in that the leftover particles might not taste good in the sauce.

This is pretty good! It was quick and easy to make and the mustard maple sauce is tasty. I served it with a green salad with ginger dressing and fried rice on the side.
