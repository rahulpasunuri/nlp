My husband made for the 4th of July. They were great onion rings and what was really impressive was how great and "gourmet" they looked with the parsley flakes in them. We even took out the camera to take a picture they were that impressive. Pretty straight-forward and easy recipe!!!

Excellent. My husband - the onion ring king - says they are the best he has ever had. The batter is light and easy to work with. I used amber ale. I'm anxious to try it on other veggies as well.

Great onion rings! Made with Cider beer. Enjoyed every bite!

This batter is good with onions or any other kind of batter-fried vegetable. I had great success using it with zucchini too. (If you do use zucchini make sure to salt the zucchini, let it sit for a few minutes, then blot off the liquid before dipping into the batter.)

Absolutely wonderful!! So easy and so delicious they won't make it to the table...just make the oil is hot, don't crowd the pan (or they take forever to cook) and with or without parsley or sauce they are perfect. Enjoy!

These barely made it to the table! Everyone loved them and I will probably use the batter to fry some other foods - like oysters. A keeper!

I found the batter to be a little heavy. I'm a new wife, and pretty new at cooking, so unfortunately I burnt them a little. I think they still turned out pretty good. I love onion rings and am always looking for new recipes for them.

Excellent recipe. Great with burgers or steak.

Very good. Just like a restaurant's rings. I added a little cinnamon to the flour just to experiment. It was very good. I will definitely make these again. I left out the parsley too.
