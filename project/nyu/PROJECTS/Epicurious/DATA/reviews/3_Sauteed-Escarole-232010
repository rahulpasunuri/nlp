I love escarole and this is a tasty, healthy and fast recipe. I would not boil the escarole for more than FIVE minutes - this way it will not be too slimy and it will retain some of its crunchiness. If not in the mood for anchovies, then simply omit.

Sauteed escarole is almost a staple in our house but I suggest following Batali's recipe also on this site: Wilted Greens with Garlic and Anchovies

Yikes! Of course the dish was slimey and mushy! This is what happens when you 'boil' escarole for 10 minutes! I make escarole quite frequently and NEVER preboil! Saute garlic and red pepper flakes in the olive oil. Add chopped [or cut/torn anyway you'd like] escarole to the heated oil and stir until coated. Continue stirring until escarole 'softens' yet still maintains a crunch [al dente if you'd like!]. Stick with a good brand of anchovy. There is a difference! You'll notice a complete difference in the end result this way. Far better I'd venture to say. Also...4 heads of escarole???? Quite a bit...stick to one head...easier to manage and you won't have escarole left over for weeks!

This did not go over great at my house. My husband liked the flavor, but the texture was "slimy". Got one bite into my 10 yr old and she refused to eat any more. Did I boil the escarole too long?-only about 5 minutes. Maybe I'll try again with just sauteing. This will not be a keeper for us.

You can reduce the recipe. I use 2 heads of escarole and 4 to 5 cloves of garlic. it's also good served cold, so leftovers are not a problem.

I make this recipe often...It's delicious and healthy.

I've made this dish with and without boiling the escarole. It is excellent both ways. Warning - If you don't like anchovies, you will not appreciate this dish. Try something else.

Very good but this was too salty with all of the anchovies. I would cut the anchovies in half.

I followed the recipe explicitly. A welcome change from broccoli or spinach with an Italian dinner, the escarole cooked in a snap. Its mild flavor was complemented by the garlic and anchovies. Next time I'll try all garlic and omit the anchovies, as I thought the anchovy taste was out of balance.
