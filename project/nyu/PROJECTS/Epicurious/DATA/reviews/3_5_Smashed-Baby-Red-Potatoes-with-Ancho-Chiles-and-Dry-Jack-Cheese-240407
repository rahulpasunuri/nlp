With the combination of ingredients I thought this would be fabulous. It was just ok. And I did use dry Jack as called for. I thought it would be the star of my dinner, but it was surprisingly bland. Served it with Thomas Keller's roast chicken and that was amazing....

These were great. I had some red chile oil and I used that instead of starting with dried chiles. Much easier and very tasty.

This is a good combination of flavors. I didn't have ancho chiles so I used New Mexico red chiles, a slightly a hotter version. Yum. For the cheeses, I used parmasean, asiago and sharp white cheddar. I agree with previous reviewers that it did need a little more 'something'. I ended up using more garlic, added salt and pepper, but it still wasn't quite there. My husband suggested butter, which I added reluctantly. It did help - with still a little more garlic and pepper. Next time I'll play with the seasonings ahead of time and try to give it more of a southwestern flair. This is a very good basic recipe - with some tweaking it could be fabulous.

I know you'll probably get irritated because I didn't follow the recipe, but I've got to share this...I made a variation of this recipe using the same method in the description, but made some substitutions as we didn't have the specified ingredients. This was a dinner for two, so the amount was scaled back to about 7 small red potatoes. I used about a tablespoon of asian chili garlic sauce in place of chili peppers, 3 green onions in place of garlic, a little garlic powder, about a 1/2 cup grated aged imported romano cheese and 1/4 cup parsley. Followed the same preperation as described and it was fantastic! It was a little on the spicy side - I'll reduce the amount of chili sauce next time - but it had tremendous depth of flavor.

Made this for tailgating a football game and recieved great reviews. I did omit the dried jack cheese as it was unavailable locally. I thought it was a little on the pastie side with regular cheese. Flavor was great though.

These were delicious and definitely indulgent. I had to add salt and also chose to add some crushed red pepper for a little heat. I doubled the recipe entirely but felt that there was still too high of a potato to "other ingredients" ratio. I would like more chile in there and perhaps a vegetable.

Incredible. Didn't serve for Thanksgiving, but with a southwest chicken recipe we love. The two together were destined to be.

These were tasty but not that much better than standard smashed baby red potatoes without the chiles and cheese. Still good to try.
