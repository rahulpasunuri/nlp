This is definitely a fabulous recipe. It can be made ahead & frozen. I came home with crunchy peanut butter by mistake but it still came out wonderful. We managed to have large pieces despite the richness. I loved the crunch of the peanuts. Great taste. Would definitely make again.

Double the peanut butter part of the recipe & 1.5-2x the individual ingredient peaut butter in each recipe that you prepare...it can stand lots of peanut butter - this is the best part of it. I've made it twice now, and love it.

One of the best chocolate and peanut butter desserts of all time! It will not disappoint.

Followed recipe exactly except I used natural peanut butter and "lightly salted" peanuts because that's what I had on hand. Turned out delicious and got rave reviews from my friends. The only downside is it is pretty time consuming to make.

I made these according to the recipe, except omitting the peanuts, and I also used a 8 inch pan instead of a 9 inch pan, just because I didn't have one. They were delicious. The bottom layer was dense and perfectly chocolatey, and the top peanut butter layer was light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweet. The hot fudge sauce made it divine. Would definitely reccomend this, just have lots of friends to share it with!

You need patience for this recipe but the end result is amazingly rich, sweet ad utterly brilliant. Can probably feed 10 or more at the end of meal. Even better than a snickers bar !!

I have made this a few times - the last time for a party with about 70 people - all I get are rave reviews! I use natural peanut butter and marscarpone in the topping and it still turns out light a fluffy and very peanut buttery. It is rich - but that just means it lasts longer with smaller portions ;)

Simply wonderful! A creamy delight.

I just have 3 words to say...this was awesome!!! I think I have to perfect the chocolate bottom, but it was delicious. I feel there were too many peanuts, so next time I will add less than called for. The peanut butter mixture looked strange at first, but tasted great once frozen. Yummy.

Didn't use the sauce simply because we didn't need it. This is a very rich dessert. As others have said, I would plan on serving small pieces. I ended up keeping a bunch in the freezer for short notice guests. FYI - my husband didn't like them as he thought they were too rich (wimp).

Easy and delicious. But as a previous reviewer said, a much smaller portion is recommended (I made 25 pieces out one recipe). You feel the richness with every bite - not for the faint-hearted.

Easy and delicous, although a lot of serious calories and fat. Keep the serving size small!

I've made this twice now as written. It is very rich and tasty. The chocolate and peanut butter flavor comes through for me. Maybe it's the type of peanut butter. A one inch square piece with a dab of fudge sauce is enough. I can't imagine eating the size pictured.

Though the recipe holds a lot of promise (chocolate and peanut butter is hardly a combination I am skeptical of), I found it a bit dissapointing. First of all, the Peanut Butter Cream Mixture is a lot of fat without much flavor or reward. I'd be willing to use the triple threat of cream cheese, whipping cream and peanut butter if it yielded an effect that was unbeatable. I didn't find that the case, however. Instead, it was rather cloying, heavy, greasy. The chocolate half was absolutely too salty. If you decide to make the recipe, withold the salt until you add the peanuts and taste--as we all know, you can always add salt, but it is impossible to remove. I guess, my bottom line on this recipe would be that though the recipe isn't diffcult, it is a three step process and I've had better boxed peanut butter brownies. Not a disaster, but not uniquely worth the effort.

Very rich; very nice dessert. My guests enjoyed the bars.

This was really good and easy to make. I used slightly less chocolate and also used jarred hot fudge from Trader Joe's. The result was delicious. I also think it's best to take them out of the freezer a few minutes beforehand so the cake part isn't so frozen and hard to chew. Overall, a great dessert that makes a big impression!

Got Milk?? Made it for a dinner party of 10 and they all loved it! Doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 dish. Needed to bake it about 7-10 minutes longer. Didn't need to double the sauce. Garnished it with a couple of peanuts on top. Will make again!!

In a word, yummy! I made this over the weekend for guests and everyone loved it. I made the recipe as is, but really thought it was rich enough without the fudge sauce, so if you have a time crunch, it will be fine without. I'll definitely make this again. It came out of the pan beautifully, cut easily, and looked just like the picture. Wonderful!

This dessert was easy to make and a huge hit with my guests this weekend. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 pan and cut it into 22 pieces. I used a jar of hot fudge and for presentation topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherries. This is going to become one of the standards on the dessert rotation.

This was delicious and easy to make. I especially liked the hot fudge sauce. We cut it into 10 pieces instead of 8 and they were plenty--not everyone could finish theirs.

These are very good and very easy to make. I used a jar of hot fudge sauce we had in the fridge instead of making the sauce. We can't stop eating them. My husband says they remind him of the peanut buster parfait from Dairy Queen.

These are great slightly melted, and are very rich. The bittersweet chocolate gives is a pronounced chocolate flavor which we liked. You might scatter some peanuts over the fudge sauce for presentation.
