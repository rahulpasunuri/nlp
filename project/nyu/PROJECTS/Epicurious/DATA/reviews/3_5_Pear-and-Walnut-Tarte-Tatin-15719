When using pastry dough bake for only 14 minutes

Just OKAY-- after reading some of the reviews, I think I might have undercooked the pears in the syrup. I'm not sure what happened, but the pears were a bit bland. Neither the rum nor the lemon did much to add flavor--the walnuts did not enhance the flavor of the pears--they were a bit distracting. I will not be making this recipe again. Rather, I will save my pears for the Carmelized Upside-Down Pear Tart (Tatin) also from this site. It is a very similar recipe, but with fewer ingredients-- and absolutely delicious!

This was excellent, easy to make, and very forgiving. I was afraid that the pears would take forever to caramelize, but then I got distracted by an early guest and the next time I turned around, everything was quite brown. A few of the pears got a bit burnt, even, but it didn't seem to matter in the final product. Also, I was really sloppy about tucking the pastry around the pears; that didn't matter, either. And I skipped the walnuts, because my menu already included tons of nuts. Despite all this, the tart was beautiful when unmolded, and it tasted fabulous.

I made this for Christmas Eve and followed the recipe (what a concept). The liquid evaporated and the browning happened right on schedule. I suspect there is a large variation in the water and sugar in various pears. It was, as another reviewer commented, very rich, but also delicious. I will definitely make it again. Perhaps with just a bit less sugar.

It took over an hour and a half to boil the liquid out, and get the pears the right color. It does not really taste like a fruit tart, but more like a caramel bar. My guests liked it and went back for more, but all agreed it was very rich. We recommend serving crème fraiche to cut the richness a bit, rather than ice cream.

I thought this was superb, as did everyone I served it to. I made the crust per the recipe; it was outstanding--perfectly flaky and delicious. I'd recommend doing so to anyone who can take the time. Like others, it took longer for my pears to cook on the stove--probably an extra 10 minutes beyond the 10 recommended. The liquid never evaporated entirely, so I just poured the excess over the pears after they were in the pan. My pie pan is on loan, so I made this in a foil-lined springform pan, which resulted in straight sides rather than the slope that a pie pan would give. I thought it was fine and may do it the same way when I repeat this recipe, which I will.

This was delicious, made without walnuts, with a puff pastry crust, and served with vanilla ice cream. Next time I might increase the rum a little. Only downside is I was peeling pears after guests arrived cause I was worried about them turning and wanted the tart to be warm and not soggy when served. Next time I think I'd try making it before guests arrive, let it sit in oven to keep warm, and turn it over right before serving...

I made this for Thanksgiving and I must say I was disappointed. It was way too much work for thanksgiving with all the other stuff going on. Though I used ripe pears, it took me almost 40 minutes to get the pears to turn golden brown and the syrup to almost evaporate--not the 10 minutes as the recipe states even with my high btu Viking. I could whip up a pear cake in less time. I used puff pastry crust and found it to be too rich after a big meal. I did serve it with a vanilla bean ice cream which was a nice compliment to the pears, but on the whole, wasn't worth the time. Only one guest even took a piece. If I ever decide to make it again, I'll use the printed recipe for the dough, add vanilla bean to the syrup and make it on a day when I don't have much to do.

I've made this desssert several times, always to rave reviews. Frankly, I think the walnuts are gilding the lily and not necessary.

Make sure your pears are truly firm, or they'll create too much juice, and instead of browning they'll just turn to mush. You really have to play with the stove temperature/length of cooking time to compensate for the amount of juice rendered by the pears. I often still have liquid in the pan when my pears have turned brown, so after removing the pears I boil the liquid until it's syrupy and pour it on top of the fruit. I use puff pastry without cutting vents in the top; this creates a nice, fluffy base for the tart. A deep, fluted clafoutis pan works well.

I used the puff pastry suggestion and it turned out beautifully. Make sure and allow pears to slightly ripen. Lovely presentation.

I wasn't confident about the cooking of the pears in the sauce. I thought the sauce should carmelize turning the pears a dark brown. The pears were cooked, but the sauce didn't get very thick or reduce. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I will do it again, it was absolutely delicious and probably could be even better. To thicken the sauce, after 30 minutes I poured it into a separate sauce pan and boiled it for a while until it reduced, but the pears were not as brown as I would have liked.

The taste was delicous, I did have trouble getting my pears to turn a nice golden color. I used 5 bosc and 4 anjou, next time I would use all bosc pears. I brought to a Christmas dinner and it was gone immediately.

I did make the accompanying pastry dough- it was easy to make and very light and flaky. The dessert was perfect for Thanksgiving dinner. This is an elegant, super-easy recipe.

Delicious. This was my first Tarte Tatin. Novices should notethat the pears really change color when they are done. I bought the crust which worked fine.

This was my dessert on Christmas Eve. It was very easy to make and the results were truly wonderful. I used packaged puff pastry instead of the accompanying dough recipe and ended up with an easy, scrumptious, and special dessert.

This is absolutely scrumptious! I used a recipe from Martha Stewart's cookbook for the crust - having forgotten to print out the recipe here - so I can't attest to the pastry dough recipe. But the rest of the directions and ingredients make something out of this world! I added a little vanilla and some traditional pumpkin pie spices for variety.

This dessert is to kill for. Wonderful!!!!!
