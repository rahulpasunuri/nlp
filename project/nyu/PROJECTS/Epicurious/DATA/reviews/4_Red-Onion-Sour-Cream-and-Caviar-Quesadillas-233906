My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. Its wonderful for a Sunday brunch with champagne. I slathered some cream cheese on the tortilla sides and the added a touch of sour cream. The cream cheese is a bit hard to spread on warm tortillas but when they cool a little, its fine. I also used tobiko (flying fish roe) I bought at the local Oriental Market.
