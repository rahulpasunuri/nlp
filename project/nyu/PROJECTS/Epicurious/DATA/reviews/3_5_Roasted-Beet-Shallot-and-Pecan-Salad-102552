Yum, yum yum! Make sure you use mouthful- size shallots and a crumbly gorgonzola...the ingredients are a winning combination.

Wonderful! I couldn't get Boston lettuce, so I subbed baby spinach leaves. Delicious!

Very good receipe. I don't like blue cheeses so I used feta and it was delicious. Also used green leaf lettuce instead of the Boston. I will make this again.
