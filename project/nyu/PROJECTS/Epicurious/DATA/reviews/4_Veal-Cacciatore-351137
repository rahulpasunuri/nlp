i've made this twice, both times to glowing reviews from tough customers. regulars in the best restaurants in nyc. buy good quality veal and you can't miss, this one's as good as it gets.

Excellent dish and very good for dinner parties with the majority being advance prep. I always get compliments on this and usually requests for the recipe. Good for family dinners as well as entertaining. I once excluded the pancetta because I had a guest who didn't eat pork. Unfortunate modification.

This is an incredible good and not too complex recipe. It is rich and satisfying and also elegant. A few thoughts: I think to get 1/3 cup of porcini's one needs more than 1/4 ounce. I used closer to a full ounce. Depending on the size of the roast and the size of your pot, you may want to add a cup or two of beef stock for the braising; you can reduce the the sauce later. I am not sure why it calls for whole tomatoes that are chopped; just buy chopped tomatoes. I always substitute fennel for celery in these situations. This is much easier to slice when cold; However, it takes awhile to re-heat (about one hour in a 325 oven).

I made this for company last night. Everyone seemed to like it but I thought it was just okay. The sauce was VERY thin and should have been reduced. I did make it the night before and can't really say if that enhanced the flavors. The meat was tender and moist. The olives should be pitted!

This is an outstanding dish! Will definitely make this again. Served it with fusilli and the braise made an excellent pasta sauce (I served some pecorino on the side). My (organic, pastured) veal shoulder roast was 3.75 lbs and we cooked it for about an hour and 40 minutes. it was incredibly tender and delicious. It is a dish on the heavier side, more of a fall/winter dish, but it made for a nice lazy Easter sunday late lunch dish as well.

Delicious! The meet was very tender and the sauce flavored, the accompaniment: polenta, was a excellent suggestion.

This was easy, fun to prepare and delicious! The first time, I made it exactly as written and it was exceptional. A few weeks later, I bought veal but didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. We all laugh when someone reviews a recipe but admits to making major changes, so I'll refrain from saying it was a bit bland because I used dried rosemary instead of fresh and used the wrong kind of olives... BUT, even with those changes, it was wonderful. Stick to the recipe if you have the right ingredients... changes only detract from the perfect balance of flavors.

Might have used the wrong cut of meat - veal tenderloin because the roast was very dry. Liked the sauce and think I will try again but with veal shanks (as recommnded by another reviewer) the next time around. Definitely not enough fat on the tenderloin for a long braising.

Delicious! Couldn't get veal from our local grocery, so we used a pork roast. Excellent results. Tender meat, rich flavors.

fantastic recipe...great just as is...perfect with a pinot noir and roaring fire! btw, why would you look up a veal recipe if you didn't eat veal?

A perfect recipe. A couple of hours in the oven after the work was done, a great meal to serve company. A delicious smell to welcome them. Not overly demanding either. I used veal shanks as it was all I could get and it was great and not too expensive. It fell off the bone after 3 hours but the bones were easy to retrieve and the shredded meat made a great topping for homemade pasta.

I'm going to refrain from giving this a fork rating because I didn't make it with veal. However, I used the exact recipe and substituted a whole quartered chicken -- and it was DELICIOUS! (So if you're anti- veal, you have another great option.) Just be aware that if you substitute chicken, the meat will fall off the bones, leaving a lot of small chicken bones. So when I make this again, which I will cerainly do, I plan on using a combination of thighs and boneless breasts.

This was excellent. I made it Thursday night (refrigerated it intact); sliced, reheated with sauce and served on Friday night. The largest piece I could get was under 5 pounds, but it easily served 8, with a small helping of garlic mashed potatoes. Note that the instructions don't tell you to tie the roast - only to cut the strings when it's done - so don't miss that step before browning the roast.

I made this the night before a dinner party, then reheated. It was a big hit with everyone. I served it over homemade noodles (which I haven't yet perfected) with some broccolini on the side. Fabulous!
