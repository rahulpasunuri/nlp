This dish was good. I recommend including the celery for texture but reducing the amount if you don't like the taste. I used rosemary instead of oregano and it was perfectly good. I imagine you could also use thyme easily. I recommend halving the salsa because (1) there is too much and (2) it has a strong enough flavor that only a little is needed as a condiment instead of a 50% component.

I didn't go crazy over this dish. It lacked flavor and the celery was an odd addition. The dressing was fine, but I did add a tiny bit of honey, which was an improvement.

Maybe it was the eggplant, maybe it was the recipe. I found it very unappealing. I followed the recipe exactly. I was hoping to save the extra caponata for something else, but it just wasn't doing anything for me. Too acidic or sharp, or something!

Made this tonight and was awesome even though I didn't give the caponata salsa time to 'cure.' I would highly recommend this dish for those who want something different, satisfying, meatless and has maybe 1 point by Weight Watchers. I used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and dried oregano in lieu of fresh -- had all the other ingredients and even if you're not a big celery fan, don't omit it! This is easy and the presentation is beautiful; I'd serve it for company. For a complete vegetarian meal, you could serve the slices over a bed of sautéed spinach drizzled with olive oil and garlic salt or rice or both and add freshly grated parmesan/romano.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't know whether to serve the eggplant as an appetizer or a salad/vegetable and decided on the latter. Grilled it along with kielbasa, and served it also with corn on the cob and potato salad. We loved it all and won't check the scales until next week.

It was good as it was, but better on toasted bread! It was also good on the eggplant on the toasted bread!

Excellent recipe, very fresh with multidimensional flavor. Even my husband loved it and he is strictly a meat and potatoes guy.

Great recipe. I cooked the tomato sauce and it came out great.

Ok recipe, needed some additions for better flavor. I sauteed some cubed eggplant and added it to the caponata, as well as some crumbled feta.

When I asked my guests if I should make another batch, the answer was YES! This is a fresh tasting summer treat. Excellent appetizer.

This is "guest worthy." Serve this instead of a salad. It's so fresh and fabulous.
