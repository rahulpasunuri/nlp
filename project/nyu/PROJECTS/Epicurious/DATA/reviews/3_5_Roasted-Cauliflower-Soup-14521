I also skipped the heavy cream, and thinned it out with some parsnip flavored water that I had saved when I steamed some parsnips: the sweetness of this parsnip water really enhanced the flavor. I've put in a note to myself to throw in a few parsnips if I have any around the next time I make this.

My six year-old said, "at first it looked too creamy but this was super uber delicious!" I enjoyed this soup - easy to make and so delicious. I opted not to use cream, and increased the chicken stock by 1/2 cup and added a little milk. Delicious winter meal. Thank you.

Super simple. Forgot to add shallots and garlic when roasting cauliflower. Added garlic when cooking in 4 cups of chicken stock. Did not add water and only 1/4 c of cream. Truffle oil is a must. Husband said it was some of the best soup he's had. Will serve as a first course with Thanksgiving dinner this year

This was simple and yummy. I only had 1 cup of cream so I used a half cup 1% milk and an extra half cup stock to substitute. It was still creamy and tasty enough that way.

This was so good. I've made cauliflower soup dozens of times but never thought to roast the cauliflower first. I too added vegetable broth instead of water, and only used 1/4 cup of cream. I also threw in an ounce and a half rind of parmesan that was languishing in the fridge, which I do to many of my soups. Delicious!

Rating: 4
After reading the prior reviews, I made these adjustments: along with the cauliflower, I roasted 4 carrots and increased the shallots and garlic. Increased the chicken stock to 6 cups, as I omitted the water and cream. After using an immersion blender the soup was thick and creamy with an appealing color. Finished with S&P and a dash of cayenne. Excellent.

I roasted the cauliflower for about 15 minutes, then added the carrots, a few pearl onions and the garlic. I used 4 cups of broth, instead of three, and added a bit of irish cheddar. I think maybe a 1/4 cup of cream will do the trick. It's a fast, easy, delicious recipe. I didn't give it 4 works, because it doesn't really have the wow factor, but it is a tasty recipe.

Cauliflower soup is great, but it doesn't need the butter or cream. Honest, folks, it tastes great with chicken broth. I threw in a heel of parm cheese to add some flavor and a few sprinkles of red pepper and mine had plenty of flavor.

This soup is absolutely delicious BUT I realize that I modified the recipe considerably. I used one head of cauliflower, 6 garlic cloves, half of a medium/large onion and chopped all of that up and put it into a roasting pan. I coated it all with lots of olive oil and a little bit of salt. I roasted it at 350 for 35-40 minutes and I stirred it every 10-15 minutes (but this is mostly because my oven doesn't really work). I put the mixture into my dutch oven along with 2 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken broth and a bay leaf. (But, next time I will use 3 1/2 cups.) I let it simmer for 20-25 minutes or so. I took out the bay leaf and hand blended it in the pot (took 2 minutes). I added 1 cup of half and half but that was really not necessary and I wouldn't do it again. (Instead I would add an additional cup of chicken broth earlier on.) I chopped fresh italian parsley and put lots on top of my serving. Yum!

This is a great recipe for people who think they hate cauliflower. (Coincidentally, for new year's eve I made a recipe titled "A Brussels Sprouts Recipe for People Who Think They Hate Brussels Sprouts," from Andrew Weill's site, and indeed it was well received by people who usually hate those mini-cabbages.) Anyway, I would never use 2 cups of heavy cream in something unless I was having guests and wanted to fall back on the lazy "more fat = better taste" approach. I've always made this using 2%, 1%, and once even skim milk. It will thicken/reduce, and the taste are texture are still excellent. I think I would find heavy cream too rich, and aside from perhaps a side salad could only eat it as my main meal prepared with cream. (Cream seems especially unnecessary if you're using good chicken stock.) I also add extra garlic and bay leaves and usually thyme...and, when lazy, use onions instead of shallots---not exactly a game changer!

Delicious!! Thank you for your suggestions......here are the changes I made: roasted a few carrots, 1 squash and garlic w/ cauliflower. Also added fresh thyme when sauteeing onion in olive oil. Used 4 cups chicken broth and NO water. DID NOT NEED ANY CREAM!! Added lots of fresh cracked pepper and parmesan cheese as a topper. Enjoy!

Perfect for a cold and rainy day. Added carrots, leeks and 1/2 an ancho chile for some smokey kick. Also increased the roasted garlic 3x. The ancho chile gave it a beautiful color. No need for cream - without it this is a great, filling and low fat soup.

Good. I modified slightly and cooked at 350 for 45 min and added roasted carrots. I think it was good and I would do it again. The key here is you must really like cauliflower then its great. I skipped the cream as I like it healthier. I didn't think it needed it.

Rating: 3
I'd give this recipe 3.5 forks. Very good. We used 1 cup heavy cream and added another 1.5 cups chicken broth. We also roasted the cauliflower at 350 as one person suggested. This is a keeper recipe for us. Flavor is subtle and rounded.

Rating: 3
I roast carrots right along with the cauliflower (usually have some in the fridge I'm happy to use up), which gives a nice flavor. Also I make this when I'm in the mood to be a little healthier, so I skip the 2 cups of heavy cream and instead serve with a little greek yogurt and maybe some crumbled bacon.

I made this almost exactly as written and it was quite good. My who husband dislikes cauliflower even enjoyed it. My only modification was stirring in a handful of shredded mild cheddar at the end which I think was a nice addition. The only change I would make next time would be to roast the vegatables at 350 for a longer time instead of at 425. At 425 the garlic burned rather quickly and added a touch of bitterness to flavor that I think could be avoided. Will definitely make this again.

Well, thank God the world is round instead of squre. I love the fact that we can take a recipe, that was probably "the bomb" in 1997 and take it to a different level in 2009. If I didn't read the reviews on some of these recipes and how to improve them, I would have had a few failed dinner parties. I made this recipe tonight and . . . I have made it as originally written -- Made it again with these changes: someroasting equal parts broccoli with the cauliflower, some leeks, garlic and add 3 carrots, then add it to the stock pot with some water and vegetable stock, salt, pepper and herbs of provence as well as paprika. Cook, covered for about 30 minutes or so. Using a hand blender, puree and then, after tasting, add some half & half to taste.

I am not a fat-o-phobe by any means, but once pureed, this soup is so "creamy" and delicious it doesen't even need the cream! How have I cooked my whole life up until now and not known you could do that with cauliflower? I think the recipe is a bit boring as written, but what a fantastic base for any other flavor or condiment. The perfect non-dairy cream soup base. I'm going to use it as the foundation for my "cream" of potato soup instead of the quart of heavy cream that recipe calls for, but curry, wild rice, cheese? I can see it working with just about anything. Or, just plain old good comfort food with a handfull of homemade croutons.

Rating: 3
I'll never understand people who write a review based on "modifications", a review should be written on the recipe exactly as written, verbatim. Having said that, I made this recipe exactly as written and found it very good. I dn't think cauliflower soup is for everyone, it is not meant to be overly spicy or knock you over with flavour, it's cauliflower after all, and that's what is should taste like, and it does. My only suggestion would be to use homemade chicken broth rather than store bought as that can make a hueg difference in the flavor. The recipe leaves that choice up to the cook, so I just used chicken stock from my freezer.

PS: I didn't mention that I did shake the roating pan a few times during the hour to turn the veg and get a good, even caremlisation, and I didn't simmer for any longer than 15 minutes, if that.

I made this tonight as a test before a dinner party this Sunday, with some minor, but perhaps crucial adjustments, and it was great if a little 'hearty'. It even impressed a fairly finicky palate who tasted a little for me. I halved the recipe, but used Three whole cloves of garlic, Four small, peeled and halved shallots, and chicken stock in place of the water. I also seasoned the whole tray before roasting at a slightly lower heat for an hour. Like others before, I think the seasoning during longer roasting is critical to bringing out the flavours. When I added the roast veg to the stock, I thought there was too much liquid and it would come out weak, but I had it completely wrong. I didn't have heavy cream, so took the suggestion from an earlier review and mixed some sour cream and whole milk and this seemed to work well, though I may increase the milk to cream ratio to get a thinner soup next time. This one could almost be described as a puree. No cheese or other seasoning was needed. I used an immersion blender and this worked fine.

I can't give this recipe even one fork. It was awful. And i even took the advice of other reviewers and added more spices and garlic. I even added a roasted red pepper for flavor and color.

I have made this soup several times and it is always wonderful. Even my picky daughter and son love it. Very easy and forgiving--you can use onion instead of shallots, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and so on. I also like to sprinkle with parmesan or serve with parmesan croutons.

I substituted a carton of sour cream for the whole cream and blended it with a stick blender (safer than regular blender or food processor). To top it off, dice and brown off a 1/4 pancetta (or bacon). Top with pancetta bits and garnish with buttered, toasted sour dough crostini.

Oh what a sad end to a beautiful, farm fresh cauliflower. I prepared it as written, and the result was horrible.

I can't imagine anyone not liking this. I have made it countless times over the last 5 or 6 years to raves. Usually make it with more chicken broth and half and half or lo-fat milk- cream is certainly not needed to make it taste rich. also use extra garlic and shallots.

Made this last night (with some minor changes) and was inspired to try this again with different veggies (carrot, artichoke, eggplant or asparagus come to mind for starters!) I roasted broccoli, 2 small sweet onions and a whole head of garlic at the temp/ time suggested but otherwise followed the recipe- except that I added 2 cups of fat free milk instead of the cream and threw in a bag of frozen broccoli pieces before serving (for some texture).

This soup is fantastic. I agree that carmelizing the cauliflower is paramount. I also agree that adding cream/milk dilutes the soup but should be used if you need to prepare the soup for several people.

I think the key is roasting the cauliflower: it was brown in many places, but the caramelization really made it turn out yummy. Also, it gives the soup more color after the puree step. I left out the cream entirely and added cumin for extra flavor. It turned out great!

Added a handful of arame (a sea vegetable that is rich in iodine, calcium, and iron and is reputed to help with high blood pressure) with everything else to simmer which may have added some color. Used half-and-half (rather than cream) since that's what I had on hand and I did not find it too thick (as had other reviewers). May use whole milk next time. Added a lot of salt to the soup but will add salt with the roasting vegetables next time to intensify the flavor. Tasty.

I think you have to adore cauliflower to love this recipe - since my husband & I both love it this was just a perfect soup for us. We made a few changes - like most people did, I think - used onions instead of shallots since we didn't have the latter, used an itty bitty pinch of nutmeg & some savory in addition to the thyme, and added a handful of baby carrots and a stalk of celery (which I threw out before pureeing). Also, in keeping w/ previous suggestions, I put a little cream and a little milk in, but didn't measure... Anyway we thought it was fantastic. The roasting really brought out the flavor of the cauliflower. AAAh, heaven....

Disappointing. I love cauliflower soup but this recipe was too bland for me. Roasting the cauliflower and getting some caramelization on it sounds like a great idea, but it seems to kill the intensity of the cauliflower (kind of like roasted garlic vs. fresh). If you aren't a big fan of intense cauliflower flavor or prefer subtler dishes, then this recipe might be great for you. For me, it was too boring and bland. James Peterson's Splendid Soups Cauliflower Soup is still my favorite.

I made this as written except used a potato masher instead of a blender, so it was a little chunky, which was okay, but a blender would be nicer. Next time, I would definitely use just 1 cup of cream instead of 2. One is plenty, and two actually made it a little bland.

Excellent. You have to watch kinda closely while roasting, turning everything every 5 - 10 minutes, and taking the shallots and garlic out early, or they'll burn.

Very dissapointed with the taste!The roasting of the cauliflower, which sounded like it would enhance the soup, actually made the soup an unappetizing lt. brown color once pureed.

Recipe sounded delicious and looked as if it would be easy to make. And it was. However, I have no idea where I went wrong with it. I only had 1 head of cauliflower (large) and I kept the proportions of chicken broth the same as if I had two heads. The soup had the consistency of farina (tasty put not soup) after pureeing in my food processor (I do not have a blender). Is this where I went wrong. Do blenders puree better?

This soup was surprisingly good! Roasting the cauliflower first gave the soup a much more interesting and complex flavor. You do not need 2 cups of cream, however.

My whole family this soup was wonderful! I wasn't too thrilled with all the heavy cream the recipe called for and I recalled that years ago "The Frugel Gourmet", (remember him)? had said that a good substitute for heavy cream was evaporated skim milk. It worked beautifully! I know that some people get crazy with subs, however, I skipped the water and added only chicken broth. I also melted in some shredded cheddar cheese for added flavor. As far as the color of the soup is concerned, to me, the paleness is just the nature of the vegetable. Fortunately, as with most recipes you can always add whatever you want to make it prettier. I garnished each dish with homemade croutons, chopped scallions and a little shredded cheddar. My husband said the presentation was beautiful.

I loved this soup and so did everyone who tasted it. I added salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper to the cauliflower while it roasted, and I think it gave a nice flavor.

Nice and easy basic cauliflower soup recipe. Although I love heavy cream, I found it somewhat overpowering. So if you want to taste the cauliflower, reduce the amount of cream a little bit. The not-so-appealing color that some reviewers complain about can be improved by stirring one or two egg yolks into the cream before adding it to the soup. And sprinkling some fresh parsley over each serving of course also helps!

I wouldn't exactly call this soup (as I made it) delicious, but that's probably because I used 2% milk in lieu of cream. Cream in lieu of milk will increase the taste of most things 10-fold, so delicious is probably what it is when cream is used. The actual flavour of the roasted cauliflower was very good, it simply lacked the richness that it needed in my version.

this soup has a great flavor as well as a deep taste that leaves you wanting to make it again. This is my 4th request for this great dish!
