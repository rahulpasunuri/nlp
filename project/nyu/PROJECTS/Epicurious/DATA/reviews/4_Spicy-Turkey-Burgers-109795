This was a good recipe. I used breadcrumbs like others mentioned but I also used chipotle chiles chopped up instead of the chipotle flavored hot sauce. Definitely making them again

Never cooked turkey burgers before this one, and have never tried another since! Not spicy in the least, so I add way more chipotle to mine. I just buy a can of the peppers and blend them so there always on hand. As people have said, you need breadcrumbs! I use panko, because it's usually what I have in the pantry. As for cooking, use a medium heat and just be patient. There is no one I have cooked these for that didn't think they were great. Also, try topping them with bacon and mango chutney for something different. Amazing! Would have given it four stars, but the recipe is lacking in direction, and really, there just (the best) turkey burgers.

delicious recipe, but my burgers fell apart on the grille. I added an egg to help hold them together as the salsa did make them very loose but this did not seem to help. They did not look appetizing but once we put fork to mouth we found them to be delicious!

This is a fast and easy way to make delicious turkey burgers! I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

A for taste, F for handling and presentation. I did the recipe as printed, adding what I thought was a hefty amount of breadcrumbs, as recommended. First batch done in Cuisinart Griddler (similar to George Foreman Grill) burned badly on the outside & didn't cook completely in the middle. Second batch cooked on the stove in good skillet with plenty of olive oil browned ok but fell apart, and was very hard to handle. When eaten, the inside was mush. Such a waste of time. The only good part was the taste, which we liked. I would NOT do this ever again as a burger, but would use the flavor combination in another dish.

Delicious!!!! The burgers were surprisingly juicy despite the fact that I used extra lean ground turkey. Followed the recipe exactly. Cooked in a grill pan and they cooked perfectly as specified. Used 100 calorie half buns, toasted and spread avocado lightly on each half. Mmmmm Mmmmm gooood!!

This recipe looked really good. Unfortunately, I didn't have some of the ingredients and substituted. I used salsa, chopped onions, one clove of garlic, regular tabasco sauce and madras curry powder. I used wheat germ as a binder based on other reviewers comments. Yummy!

These burgers are delicious! They have so much flavor that you can eat them without any condiments. I did not put any oil in the mix; there was no need for it. I did add some bread crumbs to solidify them. This is an awesome recipe!

YUM! Skipped the oil, used just 2 TBSP salsa, and added 1/2 cup breadcrumbs as other reviewers recommended. Served with salsa and sliced tomato on top. LOVED IT! Next time I think I'll add a bit more hot sauce since mine doesn't seem to be all that hot.

These were surprisingly tasty! However, they really fell apart--so hard to flip! Next time I'll add some breadcrumbs, or maybe an egg. Like another viewer, I scooped up the broken burger and ate it as a lettuce wrap. Unusual and yummy.

This is a great recipe when you are trying to eat healthier and avoid beef. I was never a fan of ground turkey but these are very flavourful. I use hot salsa instead of mild, and use many of the normal burger toppings (pickles, mustard, tomatoes, etc.) - they work really well. When trying to eat really healthy, I omit the bun and instead eat them on grilled portabella mushrooms.

Great burgers! I completely omitted the oil and they were moist and juicy. We all enjoyed them and I will make again and again.

These were GREAT! My husband asked if we can have them every night. They did need a lot of bread crumbs or panko ( I used a cup of panko) and they were still really most, but very good. Other than that addition, followed the recipe exactly. Served bunless, with a slice of melted jack cheese and sliced avocado on the top with a salad. Great tasting healthy dinner!

Delicious recipe! Used white onions instead of shallots, and hot salsa. I wouldn't use more than 1 TBSP of hot sauce, these burgers had quite a kick! What an enjoyable twist an the traditional boring turkey burger!

These were exceptional burgers! I eyeballed most of the ingredients - adding more hot sauce, less oil. I also made a few changes: used greek olive oil, Tabasco, and added fresh bread crumbs. We squeezed fresh lime juice on the patties right before serving and topped them with sliced avocados, the remaining salsa, bells peppers and onions. Delicious!

a great turkey burger! I am not a super huge fan of ground turkey (usually way too bland) but this does give you a nicely flavored turkey burger and its quick and easy to put together I did tweek a little (I am sure some one will complain that its not a true review then, but, sorry...whats the fun in cooking if you cant tweek things and then share your results?)based on some other suggestions- a few people said the burgers dont hold together well so I added a binder (1/4 cup plain bread crumbs that have been mixed with 1 beaten egg and let stand for 5 min) which worked nicely to keep it all togetehr and helps keep the ground turkey moist. Also a few people commented that the salsa was a bit over powering so I went a little light on the salsa. I didnt have any chipolte hot sauce so I used the hot saucse I had on hand (srirache) and added a little smoked paprika to get the smokey flavor. would definately make again

Rating: 3
Considering the reviews that mentioned the lack of binding agent, I took half a hamburger bun, pulverized into crumbs and added it to turkey mixture. Cut oil in half. Omitted salsa. I realize that this therefore doesn't count as a review of the original recipe, but I thought the burgers came out great.

Very flavorful, though I did have a bit of a hard time keeping them 'together'. We ended up eating them plain on lettuce without a bun or condiments which was just fine by us.

This is a terrific turkey burger, full of flavor and not at all dry. My husband cooks them on the grill on a sheet of foil with slits cut in it and they come out perfectly. A big hit with our friends and a wonderful change from the usual cookout fare.

This tasted like a taco on a burger bun. Since I have turkey burger recipes that are much better than this, I will not make this again.

Excellent burgers. Lots of flavor. There's not much to bind together, so next time I think I'd consider adding a bit of breadcrumbs. I'd also add a slice of Vidalia onion between the lettuce and the burger. The lettuce makes this a slippery sandwich. We all found the we had to work to keep the burger from slipping off the lettuce. It was kind of funny.

The best part about these burgers is that they don't need any extra condiments. There is so much flavor in the burger itself, that it is perfectly delicious alone on a bun! The recipe is very simple, healthy, and fast. I will definitely be making these again soon!

Excellent burgers! Made them according to recipe, however I substituted Franks Red Hot for the chipotle hot sauce. My husband has a "beef only" rule, however he really enjoyed these turkey burgers. Definitely a keeper!

Awesome turkey burgers! I skipped the oil and used Franks Red Hot instead of chipotle hot sauce. Worked out perfectly and added a great kick! They did feel a bit like they would fall apart, but 30 minutes in the fridge cured that.

I made this with onion instead of shallots and was disappointed...don't think it was because of the onions. The burgers fell apart in the pan and the taste was all salsa, which really doesen't enhance the flavours of turkey. Will not make again.

These were the best turkey burgers I've ever made. I used canned chipotles in adobo rather than chipotle hot sauce because it was what I had on-hand. I used 1 pepper and about 2 tsps of adobo sauce. I didn't have fresh cilantro and used a teaspoon of dried oregano instead - excellent! I used an onion instead of a shallot, again it was what I had on-hand. I think the recipe is excellent with or without minor substitutions! The salsa, salt, chipotle, cumin, and cooking method really make these burgers. They have lots of flavor and a perfect texture. They were not dry at all.

Rating: 4
This is an exceptional turkey burger...I think the first I have had that isn't dried out, even if you cut back on the amount of oil. Have cooked it exactly as written and it is delicious. Have also grilled the burgers, which is even better. Also, I have made a double batch and frozen the premade patties for another time. Thaw them in the fridge, then cooked as directed and they turn out perfectly.

I was in a rush to eat after working out, so I just made a single serving by eyeballing all the ingredients and adding a little chopped jalapeno. Put it on a crusty roll with lettuce, tomato, onion and more cilantro. Excellent! Will make full mix and have ready to go.

I used evoo instead of veg. oil and added a little extra cilantro (an entire one of those packs purchased from the grocer), but i really like that cilantro taste. I grilled some asparagus with a little evoo and salt and pepper to top the burger instead of boring lettuce. Also, I added some blue cheese on top and held off on the extra salsa. YUM!

Very easy to make and the taste is out of this world - I will only make turkey burgers this way. I used olive oil instead of vegie oil and burgers were incredibly moist. I made them ahead of time and took them camping. My boyfriend raved about them!

These were EXCELLENT. Followed the exact recipe except I didn't have cilantro...didn't miss it though. Our guests couldn't believe turkey burgers could taste this good. Topped them with a slice of pepperjack cheese and they were perfect. My new turkey burger staple.

I hardly ever cook with ground turkey because it never fails to be dried out but I came across this recipe and decided to give it another go and I'm SO glad I did. I loved these burgers and so did my boyfriend. The only changes I made were that I used 2 tbsp of olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I added a tiny bit more salsa. Personally I think they're MUCH better than beef burgers and I'll be making these instead from now on. If there were 8 forks I'd give this recipe all 8.

Tasty! Will make again for sure!

Because I do not eat beef, I am always on the lookout for good turkey burger recipes. With most recipes, the burgers turn out too dry, too blah, etc.; however, these are wonderful! I used spicy salsa, which I drained in a colander first. I also suggest using 2TBSP olive oil in the burger mix, rather than the prescribed 3 TBSP of Veg. oil.

Oh! And I forgot to say that I never, ever add or cook in the oil when I make these and they turn out just fine.

This is a staple recipe for me. These are pretty tasty with just the right amount of spice (for me). They also freeze very well. I live by myself so I make a batch, freeze them, and then pull 'em out and nuke 'em when I need a quick protein fix. They taste great chopped up and served over salad greens with scallions, a bit of salsa, a little corn, and sprinkle of cheese.

I used home made salsa with cilantro squeezed through cheesecloth and omitted the cumin and extra cilantro (didn't have any). I also substituted the hot sauce with chipotles in adobo (only the sauce part, not the peppers). These were great. I will definitely make again. I may add a bit more chipotle in adobo sauce next time.

My family loved these. My past experience with turkey burgers has been less than great, as they usually come out dry and bland. These burgers, however, were flavorful, a little spicy, and just moist enough. The only problem is that, like most turkey burgers, they are pretty delicate, so handle with care.

Very good, easy to make, kid friendly and healthy. Made once as written, once with homemade salsa using canned tomatoes - really tasty both ways. Added some chopped fresh jalepenos for the adults and topped with pepper jack cheese and sliced avacados on whole wheat english muffins the 2nd time - yum!

Easy and woth the making We really liked this sandwich... didn't miss the beef at all, very filling and totally satisfyingly tasty... Not hard to make. I did it just like it says, but then, since I don't have a cilantro plot, I'll see how it goes with dired cilantro next time... I didn't have the chipotle flavored hot sauce either, but liked it all the same.

Rating: 4
This was great. It is very similar to recipe I have out of Eating Well Rush Hour Cookbook. I cut back on the oil (1 Tbsp with meat, one to coat before cooking). As I found with the other source, use a thick salsa. While I love fresh salsa, it doesn't work as well here. No need for fillers, and with turkey burgers, fillers can easily turn them into hockey pucks (personal experience :) ) Only sub.. no hot sauce with chipotles so, I just grabbed a couple of chipotles in adobo and a couple of dashes of hot pepper sauce. I also find with turkey burgers, handle the meat as little as possible, and I put it back in the fridge for 30 minutes or so after mixing to let it firm up.

These were excellent and very flavorful burgers, I too added a few chipotle peppers in adobo sauce as well as some garlic and topped with pepper jack cheese, they have a nice kick but it isn't too strong. An easy and tasty burger alternative that everyone enjoyed!

This exceeded my expectations. I am not a red meat eater so therefore not much of a burger maker. I made these, bascially following the recipe. When I was done with the precooked ingrediants it didn't look like everything would hold together. I threw in an egg and it appeared they were falling apart even more. I put the burgers on the grill and to my amazement they held together perfectly. I think they would have held together without the egg. They just appear very wet and mushy before they cook. Once you get that carmelzation on one side they hold together just fine. The barbeque added a great flavor to the burger. I also added smoked cheddar, avocado and tomato to the finished product. I served with a black bean and corn salad and we LOVED this meal. So moist, so flavorful and so easy-no matter how they look before they are cooked.

Love this for my family of 5, all with very different tastes. We put out all kinds of fixings (avocado, roasted, red peppers, pico de gallo, hot sauces, sour cream, arugla...) so everyone can make theirs "just right".

This was SO GOOD! I ended up making a few modifications: went easy on cumin, used minced serrano chili instead of hot sauce, and cooked shallot and serrano for a couple of min. before throwing them into the patty mix. Served with cheddar cheese and avocado, and it was unbelievable.

I made these burgers last night. I changed up a few ingredients: I didn't add the shallots, added canned chipotle w/adobo sauce instead of the chipotle hot sauce, added chipotle pepper seasoning and didn't add the oil (actually forgot but they were fine without it). We topped the burgers with pepper jack cheese and served with carmalized onions and avocado on a whole wheat bun. It was DELICIOUS! We will definitely make these again.

This is my favorite turkey burger recipe on this site. We leave out the oil completely and don't miss it at all. Burgers come out juicy and moist every time. To help avoid sticking we just freeze the patties for about 30 minutes and then spray the grill with oil before cooking. Yummy.

This is the best,moist turkey burger around. I make this burger using ground thigh turkey meat(pre-packaged) from Whole Foods, which makes 4 burgers. I also use wax paper to freeze each burger separately then put them in a freezer bag. The burger mixture is very sticky so cut 4 pieces of wax paper ahead of time and use a spoon to scoop the prepared turkey mixture out of the bowl onto the paper building each burger.Fold over the wax paper to enclose each burger. They will hold together this way, there is much less waste and you never get it on your hands. I take them out of the freezer to thaw, leaving them in the wax paper and slide each one from the wax paper to the hot skillet. I use olive oil to fry them. We eat them with or without buns during the summer with a southwest black bean,corn,avacado, salad. They are quick, healthy and delicious and the thigh meat is more flavorable than beast meant.

After reading the notes that people had trouble keeping these together, I added one egg, lightly beaten and 1/4 cup of dried bread crumbs. Also changed the chipotle flavored hot sauce to 1 teaspoon of ground chipotle chile powder. These are just excellent...a definite keeper!

Made this tonight, thought it was fabulous. I did have the falling-apart problem that other reviewers describe. Next time I'll add some bread crumbs. I used a thai garlic-chili pepper sauce for the hot sauce. sadly didn't have cilantro but will try that and fresh salsa next time. can only imagine that the one reviewer who said it was bland misread the recipe somewhere.

These were the best burgers I ever made. When I called my husband and kids to the table they weren't thrilled about having turkey burgers but when they took their first bite they loved them. They asked for more the next day. My sister-in-law tried them she thought they were delicious. I made my own salsa. These were burgers were a hit! I'll be making these burgers again.

By far, the best of all gound turkey recipes. I used low carb pitas and added a some melted cheese while they were cooking. My kids loved them and they "hate" cilantro. I added sliced dill pickles to my burger!!! No other condiments needed!!

I love turkey burgers but I think these are by far the winning burgers. We loved the heat and the taste was incredible. I added a bit of bread crumbs and did fry in the skillet. I do not think these would work well on the grill. I also took the advice of a previous poster and made the chipotle tater sauce. AWESOME COMBO!

Rating: 3
Very yummy and quite spicy, but that might have been due to the 2 jalapeno peppers I added in lieu of cilantro. The shallots at the store were sickly looking so I substituted shallots. I also followed others' advice on adding oatmeal and using thicker salsa. There was a tendency to stick to the grill and fall apart, but a little brushing of oil (I decreased the amount called for in the recipe) on the surface helped. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
For ground turkey (and I am a fan) this is awesome!!! The flavors are perfect and I used low carb pita pockets instead of hamburg buns. Melt a little cheese on top and WOW!!! Dill pickle slices are great too. I used a really hot pan on the stove top and covered it at the end to let the steam cook the burger. Make sure you use a high heat on the stove top for the browning phase.

Great burger!!! Try the Chipoltle-Chili Tartar Sauce in another recipe for the perfect match! We have made this many times and it is always great. The burger falls apart a little if done by the book. There are a few ways to get around it. The way I prefer is to use a dual spatula. It's like a pair of tongs, but with a spatula tips. Ass a little bread crumbs or use not so runny salsa. And like I said before, try the Chipoltle-Chili Tartar Sauce in another recipe for the perfect match!

Wasn't sure what to expect for this turkey burger, but all I have to say now is WOW!!! For any Mexican food fan, this is a great burger. I used sour cream to dip, incredible.

When ground turkey is on sale at the grocery store, buy 1 get 1 free, I stock up. I make the burgers exactly like the recipe states and freeze them UNCOOKED, wrapped individually. When we want a burger, just thaw and either grill or pan fry. I don't have any problems with it falling apart. I'll take a cooked burger for lunch. I wrap it separately; take a roll, some lettuce, cheese and salsa. Just microwave the burger 1-1.5 minutes and assemble. Everyone gets so jealous when they see my great lunches, thanks to Epicurious!

The flavors in this burger were fantastic, and definitely a refreshing change of pace. I didn't have the falling apart problem that some other people did (although I cooked them on the stove, not grill), but mine would have been perfect if they were a little juicier. Maybe because I used 99% fat free turkey meat? Might try adding some worchestire sauce next time.

This recipe was easy to make and the end result was delightful. I added diced jalapenos and spicy salsa to the mixture instead of the hot sauce. I also added a bit of oatmeal (as suggested by another reviewer) to help hold the burgers together. We grilled the burgers instead of pan frying them and they held well together. I agree with everyone who said this is a nice change to generally bland turkey burgers.

The best turkey burgers I've ever tasted. Juicy & flavorful and didn't fall apart on the grill. I used a thick & chunky bottled salsa, which I think helps bind everything together. I think this recipe would make great veggie burgers as well (substitute veggie burger mix for turkey), but I haven't tried that. I topped off the burgers with fresh sliced tomatoes from the garden instead of the rest of the salsa called for in the recipe. Delicious!

A creative way to spice up the usual boring cookout food. I cooked these on the grill but found I needed to add some bread crumbs to give them some substance and keep them from falling through the grill!

These were disappointing. I haven't made turkey burgers before so I had no frame of reference, but I followed the recipe exactly and, with all the nice flavors involved, I assumed the burgers would turn out to be nicely flavored. Instead they were bland. I had no problems keeping the mixture together--the end result looked fine but was simply too bland. If I made these again (and I likely won't) I would add more of the spices and hot sauce to the turkey mixture, and I would also serve them with more toppings than just the salsa (sliced onions, etc) to add some much needed kick.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the burgers came out PERFECT!! They were delicious--looked great, too. Such a nice change from regular old hamburgers. We loved them and will definitely have them again--I wouldn't change a thing. There are just two of us, so we had leftovers and they were tasty, too.

Yummy - my 4 and 2 year olds even liked it! I used fresh salsa, less oil, Tabasco sauce and grilled the burgers (spray both sides of burgers and the grill grate with non-stick cooking spray). Minus the bun and using salsa without added sugar or fat, they fit nicely into the South Beach Diet. A definite keeper!

I found that FRESH salsa, not a bottled store brand made a much better burger. Either make it yourself, or look for it in the produce section by the salads. Be sure to drain all the standing liquid from the salsa before measuring/using it also helped with texture of the burgers.

While I haven't tried this exact recipe, I've done something similar in the past...suggest that some dry oatmeal (1/4 to 1/2 cup) be added to mixture before shaping into patties. This addition seems to help hold them together during cooking.

This was really surprisingly good and easy. I say surprising because it seems like so many turkey dishes along these lines are easy to be bland. This dish had a lot of depth to the taste, too, which we loved. I did use a smokey serrano hot sauce as I couldn't find the recommended sauce, and I did have slightly more turkey than called for. My only complaint was that in trying to cook multiple burgers at once, they gave off a lot of liquid and all somewhat fell apart. I had to cook one separately after dinner and it held together much better, so maybe the turkey mix needs to set up a bit before cooking, or maybe it just needs to be cooked without company. Easy weeknight dinner that we will definitely be having again.
