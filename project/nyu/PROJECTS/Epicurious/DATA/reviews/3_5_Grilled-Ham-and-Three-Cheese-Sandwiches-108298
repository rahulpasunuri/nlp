I made this without the ham, and it is an incredible grilled cheese recipe. It's definitely a keeper. Combine it with homemade tomato soup for ultimate comfort food success.

I really liked this recipe because it was easy and its a great twist on an old favorite. I actually had most of the ingredients at home but the roasted red peppers and the fresh thyme. I substituted fresh red bell peppers and still thought it was great. Will probably make variations of it again.
