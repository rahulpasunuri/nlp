My four forks rating is based on my modifications: Only boil brocoli for 4 or 5 minutes, not 10! Add lots of cooked hot italian sausage, carmelize the onions and also saute three cloves minced garlic, generous amount of italian seasonings added to cheese mixture, as well as salt and fresh black pepper. Top with italian bread crumbs. SO yummy!

Oh, I've already reviewed but recalled that we added Gruyere, sauteed and crumbled bacon and also blanched the broccoli prior to cooking so it would be a lovely green when it came out. It doesn't resemble the orgiinal recipe but with all the cheese additions and seasonings, I really think it was great for a holiday serving. Everyone really raved about this years concoction. One of these years I will rewrite the recipe and post.

I've made this recipe at least 4 times now and each time I add to it. I'm not measuring because it doens't seem to matter much. I don't find it as flavorful as I'd like so I add in a lot. I've cut up shallots and garlic and sauteed to carmelize. I've added a lot of feta and many other stronger cheeses. Asiago, Parm, and others are great all together in this (yes, with the chedder and feta). And yet it STILL absorbs in and doesn't make it too cheesy. The addition of Shallots and garlic really helped. I mix in italian bread crumbs and also panko on top mixed with garlic butter and that is popular. Sorry to not review the actual but I can say that I'll make this again, and continue to add seasonings!

Blah, it may be a regional specialty somewhere, but I'm certainly not persuaded of its charms. The kids wouldn't eat much of it, I ended up having to eat the leftovers myself. The leftovers are more or less passable heated up with lots of salsa and some sour cream in a wrap.

after reading the recipe and the reviews i made some modifications. I sauted the onions before adding them to the mixture. I also increased the cheese

Based on the reviews, I made serious modifications. I added pan roasted sliced onions and 'smashed' garlic cloves (add cloves to roasted onions about halfway through the roasting process), used a cup or so of Gruyere cheese versus cheddar and ricotta (though cheddar would be fine), and added my secret ingredient, thick yummy Horizon's organic sour cream--two or three tablespoons. When I popped it into the oven, I added plain bread crumbs and sprinkled on garlic powder, and fresh coarsely ground black pepper. When I served the concoction, I finished each individual serving with a sprinkle of kosher salt. While only a ghost of the original recipe, it was delicious.

Blech. The sauce was a lovely consistency but the final dish tasted almost like nothing. You'd think you'd be able to at least taste the onion but no. The only flavor I noticed was a mild hint of ricotta cheese, which isn't bad but isn't delicious, either. I used two supermarket heads of broccoli, which gave me a little over five cups of chopped pieces. That seemed a decent proportion of veggie to sauce. Be sure to drain the broccoli well, as it will make the dish watery if you don't. I don't know why the combination was less than the sum of its parts but it was.

Before making this dish, I read all of the reviews so I knew to make a few modifications. I used a full cup of cheddar cheese and crushed up croutons mixed with melted butter for a top crust. The crust definitely added flavor, but the dish was still a little dry overall. Maybe add a little more milk next time or try a different casserole all together.

I tried this recipe b/c I thought it sounded like a fancier version of my gram's cheesewhiz rice concoction i loved growing up. We caramelized the onion and added garlic and upped the (sharp) cheddar but this was well-nigh flavorless. the texture would have been good had we boiled the broccoli 3 or 4 minutes. maybe a good base to start from, but the blandest recipe ive attempted on this site. BEWARE!

This was my first attempt at brocolli casserole, and it turned out wonderfully. I cut the vegetables more coarsely because my family likes the "crunch" rather than the "mush". Also, if you cook it in a caserole dish, it might be necessary to cook it at a slightly higher temperature for slightly longer than the recipe says.

I thought this was good. I carmelized the onions as other readers suggested, used extra sharp cheddar and added garlic/butter panko on top. I think the carmelized onions, sharp cheese and garlic avoided the "bland" issue that other people were having. I might skip the milk/cornstarch next time because I think it makes it too watery. I will definitely make it again - it's easy and worth a try.

This is so good my boyfriend requested it the next day and my kids declared that they love spinach! I did make quite a few mods, however. I used 8 oz of extra sharp cheddar, 1/2 cup of asiago, 1/2 cup of parmesan, skipped the cornstarch/milk, carmelized the onion in 1/2 stick of butter and 4 cloves of garlic prior to adding it to the mixture, and used half a bag of frozen broccoli and half a bag of frozen spinach. Divine!

I found this recipe simple and tasty, but would definitely saute the onions before adding them to the casserole.

This wasn't bad but nothing special, as stated by the postscript 'simplicity from a monastery kitchen'. I guess the taste depends largely on the kind of cheese you use. I used Gouda cheese but I suppose something like Parmesan or even ricotta would have added more flavour. Apart from that I thought cooking the broccoli first for ten minutes and then baking it for another thirty minutes was way too long. My broccoli had turned too mush which I don't like; it should remain a bit crunchy. Five minutes of cooking and fifteen minutes of baking should be sufficient.

This was a bit different than I have previous done with broccoli. It was quite good. Its nice to serve with a red meat dish

Wanting to appeal to the non-adventurous, seldom-eating vegetable diner at my Thanksgiving table, I chose this recipe - thinking anything tastes good with cheese. How wrong I was! Even after altering the recipe with more interesting cheeses and creating a breadcrumb-parmesan topping, this dish was still terribly bland. Broccoli never tasted worse.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a real hit. I used 1 full cup of aged cheddar cheese and then another 1/2 of cup of asiago cheese with the ricotta. I also sprinkled Pepperidge farm cornbread stuffing with butter on the top. The stuffing stayed very crunchy and gave a great texture. Family members wanted this recipe.

Took this dish to a dinner party tonight and my friend Jan placed the leftover dish in front of her and finished it off!! Made a few changes based on the reviews and other recipes. I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard - for a needed kick, didn't have ricotta cheese - used cottage cheese, and instead of softening the corn starch in milk, I used yogurt. I also added fresh bread crumbs as a topping using a baggette and german dark bread mixed with parm cheese. We all enjoyed this dish. Especially Jan! Will definately make it again. Travels well and would be great during the holidays.

The core of this recipe is solid, but it veers toward being a bit bland. To remedy, I used a mixture of stronger-flavored cheeses like smoked white cheddar, sharp white cheddar, and some assagio mixed with the bread crumbs for the crust. What's great though is the texture-- broccoli is not overcooked at all, and the cheese mixture is the right thickness.

I added crushed garlic and minced dried onion flakes. Also instead of 1/3 c of grated cheddar, I used a good cup of grated sharp cheddar, and increased the amount of fresh onion to one large. Thought it would be a bit bland if the extras weren't added.

Just OK. I made this for Christmas - there were plenty of leftovers and no one took seconds of this dish. I made it exactly as stated and it was a bit bland. I can't really put my finger on the problem - nothing horrible, but nothing very good either.

This was the 2nd Thanksgiving that I've used this recipe, with my family heavily requesting it from me. I added a lot more cheese than the recipe calls for, and used a colby-cheddar-jack blend inplace of just the cheddar, and it came out a lot better than last years. If you follow the recipe on the amt of cheese to add, it'll come out dry...that's probably because of what the author considered to be medium heads of brocolli and what I thought medium was. It's not the spiciest dish in the world, but it is a good solid traditional-type dish to add to a large dinner like Thanksgiving without it getting lost among all the other dishes. Like I said, my family all liked it enough to ask for it again a year later.

I sauteed the onions which was good and also added additional cheese, but still bland!

My family liked this. I added some dijon mustard and minced garlic to spice it up a bit, and I added more cheese just because we like cheese. The only change I would make would be to saute the onions before adding them to the casserole--they're too strong and crunchy otherwise.

This recipe sounded very good, however the sauce was rather bland. I used sharp cheddar cheese, and actually way more than called for. I did not think it was terrible, but not good enough to ever consider making again.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner. Instead of four heads of broccoli I used two bags from a three bag package purchased at BJ's wholesale club. The package included cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, zucchini and squash. I went according to the recipe and it was delicious. Just a tip be sure there is a generous amount of cheese mixture poured over the vegies or the casserole may end up dry.

Boy, I don't know what I did wrong: mine turned out horrribly. Not nearly enough "sauce" for 4 medium heads of broccoli...I don't think I've ever mixed cornstarch into a mixture that wasn't hot.

The casserole is much better with one thawed bag of frozen spinach. Oherwise use much less broccoli. It's also a good idea to be generous with the cheese.

I doubled this recipe and made it as side dish for Easter dinner, everyone loved it and I had no leftovers. I was worried that the broccoli would be over cooked with blanching and 30 minutes in the oven, but it was still bright coloured and fresh tasting, I would definitely make this dish again.

This was a simple souffle that worked well as a side dish. I wouldn't try to serve this as a main course...even for a vegitarian. I used about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and may use a little more next time. I only used about 1 1/2 "store" bunches of broccoli. I baked in a souffle dish at 375 for 35 minutes.
