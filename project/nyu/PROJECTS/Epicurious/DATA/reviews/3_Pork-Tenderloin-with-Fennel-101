This is one of those unspoken recipes. There are loads of things you can do as an experienced cook to make this great, but a new cook may not see the nuance. Caramalize the fennel and garlic a bit before adding the stock. Cover, braise for a bit, remove lid then dry it out a bit. Cool and stuff. mince the garlic, fennel seeds, salt and pepper fine. Season the inside of the pork once you butterfly it with salt and pepper. Fill, roll and tie. Smear over the garlic puree. Roast in a heavy skillet. When cooked to temp, remove and tent to rest. You can follow the rest or you can toss in a chopped shallot, saute til soft, add a splash of wine, reduce, add stock, reduce, add a splash of cream reduce. Delicious. Fennel loving husband loved it.

This was an excellent recipe. I used very young fennel, which was tender and sweet. Love it. Simple and delicious! The whole family loved it, including the kids.

I thought this was great. I added some butter to the sauce and doubled the chix stock in the sauce. Excellent and easy.

This was fabulous. I substituted some homemade duck stock for the unsalted chicken broth to give it a fuller bodied flavor.

I had all the ingredients on hand, and I even tried to improve the flavor by braising the chopped fennel in wine rather than in stock. But it just was kind of bland, and not interesting. I'd not bother making this one.

Really thought this dish was lacking in caliber.

This was wonderful! Very easy to prepare, and delicious. The fennel is very subtle. I served it with gnocchi in sage butter and a salad. I'd love to make it again, for company.

This was very tasty for a sunday dinner, but I would not make it again. AGAIN, so many recipes, so little time.

I loved this recipe! Kudos to all. How simple, yet elegant! Not everyone chef's with Fennel/Anis seed in their spice closet, however, they should! This recipe is just yummy! Simple and yummy!

Great simple recipe! I love pork tenderloin because it is lowfat and simple and combined with a favorite flavor of Fennel? Great! I serve this with oven roasted red potatoes seasoned with garlic and herbes de provence and sauteed or steamed yellow squash and red bell pepper.

The recipe was wonderful. It was the hit of several faculty parties and was the rave of several of my friends who experienced this recipe that I shared with them.
