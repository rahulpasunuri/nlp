I am a huge gingerbread fan but found these gingerbreads to be lacking...They weren't particularly moist and were somewhat less sweet and less spicy than I'd hoped. As a topping to vanilla ice cream it was a nice contrast but I wasn't impressed with the product on its own.

Delicious! Dense and not too sweet, a nice easy recipe. I cooked them in a cupcake/muffin tin and they worked out perfect but it took a little longer to bake than quoted in the recipe. I think next time I'll add in a little crystilled ginger.
