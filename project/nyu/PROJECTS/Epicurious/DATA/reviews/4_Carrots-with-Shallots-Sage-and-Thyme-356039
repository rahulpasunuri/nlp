I loved these carrots! Lots of flavor! I was out of sage so I just left it out and they were still great!

Followed the recipe exactly for Thanksgiving dinner, and was so thrilled with the results, made again for Saturday night dinner! A huge hit around both dinner tables with multiple guests requesting the recipe. Cut the carrots and shallots the night before the help with timing.

Every time I make this for Thanksgiving it turns out better than I remembered. Fragrant and delicious!

Absolutely the best carrots ever...try them!

Outstanding in its simplicity. I didn't have sage, so I doubled up on the fresh thyme. Good call. As many others have commented, they served this as a Thanksgiving side dish. If you do the prep ahead of time, the entire dish can be made while the turkey is resting. Best part? Since the entire dish is made on the stove top, it's one less dish demanding a turn in the oven at Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe in 2010 for Thanksgiving and my family requested it again for this year's table. Easy and delicious!!

The flavours are so savoury, our guests wanted the recipe. Will make this again and again!

Have made this for Thanksgiving twice, following the recipe as is. Big hit both times. I normally don't care for cooked carrots but this makes them a much better dish, less sweet and more vegetable-y than boiling. The herbs really bring out the vegetable flavor.

I halved the recipe to serve 4 and probably used less shallots than what it called for. Very yummy. The sage and shallots are great together and the nutmeg is a really nice touch. Easy to make too!

I made this dish for my family's Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved about it. My mom said even my brother who wouldn't eat carrots took seconds (and later ate the leftovers). Peeling and making matchsticks of 3 lbs of carrots took most of the time, making it a longer task than anticipated. Also, I couldn't fit all those carrots into a saucepan and get them bathed in the stock, so I added some extra sock and left out some of the raw carrot sticks. Made this using fake chicken stock (found at Harris Teeter or Whole Paycheck er Foods) and would definitely recommend that if you are looking to make something vegetarian-friendly.

Very good.

A wonderful and easy recipe for carrots. This turned out to be a great Thanksgiving side dish. My wife doesn't usually like carrots but she loved this. Fresh herbs from the garden and broth made from the turkey giblets really made this great. I used 1-Tbs butter with 2-Tbs olive oil for a healthier version.

Made these for Thanksgiving. The flavour was wonderful. I substituted baby carrots with stems and boiled them for only half the recommended time. This will definitely be a 'keeper'.

This recipe is delicious and fantastic if you're looking for something simple yet a little different to do with your carrots. Turns a boring side dish into something a little special. I used half butter and half olive oil to be a wee bit healthier. I did not think there was too much sage.

0.5(sage + thyme) = delish. Really nice aromatic sweet vegetable side.

I followed the recommendations to use less sage, and so I halved it. The dish turned out perfect!!

Way too much sage and thyme. Yuck. What a lot of work for such a disappointing dish. I do not recommend this at all.

Made this with Chicken in Dill Mustard Sauce (also from site) and thought it was excellent! Went a little lighter on the sage than suggested, but definitely a keeper!

I made this this morning to bring to a potluck later on, and I couldn't help swiping a few delicious buttery shalloty herby carrots to "taste." I made the recipe as written, though I subbed water for broth as I want it to serve vegetarians (you could use veggie broth, too) as well as carnivores. Next time, I will cook the carrots a little less so they are just a little less soft. Otherwise, perfect.

Way too much sage!! I made this dish 2 days ahead and the sage and onions over-powered the carrots. After rinsing the spices off of the carrots, they were quite good because the spices had permeated the carrots.

A bit more trouble than it's worth. It didn't taste bad, but I used the multi-coloured carrots, as suggested, and the purple ones died the whole dish a rather unappatizing black. If I try this again, I'll stick to the orange and yellow varieties.

made this for thanksgiving - perfect accompaniment and used the left over sage from the gravy. Everyone thought they were terrific - the carrots still had some crunch and the flavors were delicious. I love shallots and this was really yummy. They will be an annual addition to thanksgiving, but we'll certainly have them often in between.

I didn't care for this; not enough herb flavor and too many shallots, too much butter for my taste. I'll go back to the Glazed Carrots with Molasses and Marjoram from the Nov 2006 BA.

I added this recipe to the Thanksgiving menu this year and it was a huge hit. Very easy and very popular with kids as well as adults. The shallots are a key to the flavor. I will make this again (and again!)

A delicious but uncomplicated side, even better reheated the next day. A great make-ahead company dish, I'm bringing them to our family Thanksgiving dinner.

Made this with the roasted chicken with grapes and shallots for my house full of boys and they LOVED it. Carrots were a huge hit and everyone went for seconds even though they were "full"

Fabulous recipe and extremely easy to make. I only had dried herbs on hand so used these instead of the fresh and really reduced quantities of the herbs to just smidge - results were fantastic. Many compliments from adults and kids!

Really great. We had little carrots from the farmers market. Found out my shallots were bad at the last minute, so I had to use onion instead. Worked out great.

Fantastic recipe. End result is worth the effort of cutting up all the carrots. I used fresh sage and thyme. Made it as directed, it was not too salty. Sage plus thyme plus carrots equals magic! Must be because of the butter!
