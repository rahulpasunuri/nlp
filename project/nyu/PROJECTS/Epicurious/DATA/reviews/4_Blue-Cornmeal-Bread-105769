Great recipe. Cut it in half and it worked well. I actually only used 3/4 the amount of sugar called for and found it perfect for my taste--sweet but not too sweet. I didn't think the pine nuts added much. I happened to have some in the house so I used them, but next time I'll leave them out. Also didn't have buttermilk so I added a little vinegar to some milk and it added just the faintest tang.

This is a fabulous recipe that I have made several times with both blue and yellow cornmeal. It is sweet enough to eat as dessert.

The perfect cornbread. Moist, just the right amount of sugar, keeps well...I love the addition of corn kernels and pine nuts. I don't think I'll ever use another recipe.

I don't know how you got this receipe, but thank you for it! I LOVE this bread. My favorite part is the fact that there is actually CORN in Corn bread. I've been hooked since the first bite! It's just perfect and now I don't have to go all the way to Banff to enjoy it, but I'll still go to enjoy Banff! Thanks for posting, thanks internet for being able to find it!

Used yellow cornmeal and it was hit with everybody. I did put in extra pine nuts and corn and got raves about it. Easy and yummy!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was such a hit. The second time I made it, I tried with pumpkin seeds, yuck. The pinenuts just do something special for this recipe.

This was the most perfect cornbread I have ever tasted anywhere! The batter was beautiful and easy to make. Perfect; rises high; very moist. It does not even need butter!Lovely recipe. I will try it with yellow cornmeal next time just to try it out and to see how pretty it looks. Toast pinenuts on a cookie sheet for 5 minutes on 350. Since they are delicate, I would not go any longer.

Quick, easy and very tasty. Freeked out my neighbors though when they saw blue corn bread. Which was surprising because they are quite freekish to begin with. It is such a nice shade of blue too. Pine nuts, yum. Served it with a Gumbo that had chicken, andouille sasuage, shrimp and crab.

I made this for Thanksgiving with yellow corn meal and again last night with the blue. It was a hit both times. Personally, I think I like the yellow better. The pine nuts are a great addition.

This recipe was a great addition to a seafood paella supper. Had a great corn flavor, especially when served warm. I used yellow cornmeal, but will try blue cornmeal the next time.
