Actually, Major Grey is a *style* of chutney, not a brand name. It was originally developed by Crosse & Blackwell in the UK, but there is no trademark - anyone can use 'Major Grey' to describe their chutney. Typically, Major Grey chutney is milder and smoother than other chutneys.

Major Grey's is a brand of chutney. Costco was selling it at one point but I have not seen it recently. You can most probably find it in upscale gourmet supermarkets.
