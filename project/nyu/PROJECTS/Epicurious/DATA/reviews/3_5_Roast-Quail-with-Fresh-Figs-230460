Haven't made this but to the previous cook who queried where to get quail; D'Artagnon, a company in n.y., ships everywhere, and they also have lovely squab and duck breasts, if you like game birds.

this is a great recipe. i made grilled quail, skipped the stuffing, and served over polenta. excellent. for the sauce: skip the arrowroot - no need to thicken if you have a true demi glace or a gelatinous poultry stock. my sauce thickened quite well without any thickening agent. I also used more aromatics as the base for the sauce -- but use your own tastes. Overall - impressive and delicious. Try adding ruby port instead of marsala to the sauce...there is a lot of room to experiement with this recipe. It is only a template.

People, people: There are no eggs in THIS recipe. Read the intro carefully; it refers to the entree as part of an entire meal MENU published in the magazine. The eggs are obviously part of the appetizer from that menu; that's why they say to do the entree prep before starting the appetizer. The other dishes are not linked from this recipe.

Perhaps the mysterious "eggs" mentioned in the beginning of this recipe refer to quail's eggs?

I need a source for the quail. The recipe sounds wonderful and easy for company with the prep work done early.

In response to the query about the eggs, I think it refers to a first course of Scrambled eggs with carviar. I have not tried this, but if my second crop of fresh figs comes in I will attempt it.

What about the eggs mentioned in the title and preface note? As far as I understood the stuffing is stuffing for eggs? Whould be nice to get the correct version of this complicated entree.
