There is little positive to say for this use of halibut. The halibut is dry and lacking flavor. It desperately needed some salt but that certainly wasn't a cure. Without the carrots this recipe would get -1 fork. The carrots are quite good -- butter, cinnamon, a dash of cayenne and lemon juice. I put them over some quinoa and that was the best part of the meal. There are many better uses of halibut.

Quick and easy recipe that delivers great flavor. No changes to the ingredients -- use most of the seasoning on the fish - 3 halibut fillets and little less on carrots. I oven roasted the carrots for ease of preparation. Right before removing carrots from oven sprinkled with little brown sugar - mixed in mint after removing from oven. Great meal for family or for company.

What great flavor combinations!

This was a quick and easy weeknight meal. We liked the flavors of the spices with both the halibut and the carrots, but I would cut back on the cayenne next time, and would put most of the spice mixture on the fish and less on the carrots. It sort of overpowered the carrots but was less noticeable on the fish. This will go into our regular rotation of weeknight meals.

Made this last week and couldn't wait to get more halibut to do it again! The carrots are incredible too!

great, cayenne pepper goes a long ways however and a 1/4 teaspoon is a bit too far

I made this with the excellent frozen halibut filets that I find here in France. To simplify the recipe even further, I just sprinkled cinnamon, cayenne, salt & pepper on the frozen filets, poured the melted butter on top, and baked it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes in the oven and it was delicious. I made the carrots pretty much as directed, but I added a bit of cumin to vary the flavors. Served it with couscous and a nice rose wine. I would make this for company for an easy summer dinner on the terrace, it was so good. Probably start with a cold cucumber soup, although right now cucumbers are a little scary in Europe (E.Coli).

Simply a lovely, if unusual, interplay of flavors. I needed to add a little more lemon juice as I didn't cut the carrots small enough and they weren't done after 5 minutes. The carrots actually tasted slightly sweet. Paired well with a California sparking wine along with saffron rice. Doubled the recipe as I had almost 20 oz. of halibut, and two of us happily ate most of it. Will make again for sure

I used an entire lemon and slightly larger halibut fillets. This was delicious. The carrot slivers were surprisingly lemony and fabulous! We loved this and will make it all through the summer. I would highly recommend! Husband said "four forks" without even being asked his opinion.

Delicious! I like strong flavours, particularly spice. I doubled the amount of cinnamon and cayenne on the fish (not the carrots) and loved it! I did not use any mint. Some fresh Meyer lemon squeezed over the fish was delightful. Great with a crisp, acidic white wine!

Made this for dinner tonight. The carrots were pretty "hot" from the cayenne but the fish was very nice. Didn't have any mint.

I took the other chefs' advice and made the carrots in a separate pan alongside the halibut, and that worked well. Agree it's easy to overdo the lemon but found the cayenne-to-cinnamon ration just right. Added a dash of paprika and that seemed to work well too. A very "foodie" dish for such minimal effort.

Easy, tasty and different. Would recommend others make a few changes, take cayenne, cinnamon, salt and pepper and use almost all exclusively on fish as a rub and let sit for 10 minutes prior to cooking. Use a small amount of the "rub" on the carrots, adding a little brown sugar to the carrots to offset the spice of the fish. Likely also a great addition would be couscous with golden raisins.

Very good- but a bit shocking to the system with the spices per the recipe. My husband and I found the level of cayenne pepper relative to cinnamon to be a bit much. We found ourselves "sniffing" our way through dinner as a reaction to the cayenne and definitely needed to add more yogurt to manage the heat! Next time, and there will be a next time, I would make the spice mixture 2/3 cinnamon and 1/3 cayenne.

Yummy! I love the flavors in the fish and carrots. This recipe is very quick to cook, though cutting the carrots into matchsticks can be a little time consuming.

I would cook the fish and the carrots at the same time in different pans, or atleast keep the fish in a heating dish in the oven. My fish was not as hot as I would have liked after cooking the carrots. Also, I pretty much doubled the cayenne and cinnamon because I love some spice but could have cut back a bit because the flavors were slightly overwhelming (but still more than called for in the recipe). Overall, incredible flavors and loved it...:)

We LOVED this - were at first a little skeptical of the odd combination, but made it as written and will make it again and again We DID have really fresh halibut which I am sure helped too.

I made this last night for a small dinner party ~ fast and very easy with great flavor. This is a fabulous recipe and extremly healthy and lite. I will make this again and again.

This was so tasty and easy to make! I substituted olive oil for butter to make it healthier and it came out perfectly. I also served it with a dollop of greek yogurt on the side garnished with a mint sprig. The yogurt really complemented the flavors and helped cut the spice (I used extra cayenne per other reviewers' suggestions). Plus it looked pretty on the plate esp. with the mint sprig. I'll definitely make this again.

I love to cook and I love Epicurious but I don't usually write reviews. This dish requires action. This is a great dish. cook the carrots a bit first and use a bit more of the cayenne and cinnamon, follow the recepie and you will be pleased. 4 forks for sure

Unfortunately I only made the carrots since my husband wanted to make a different halibut recipe. Everyone at the dinner party raved about the carrots and wanted the recipe. I would definitely make again with the halibut! Great combination of spices.

Delish! Didn't have enough cayenne, so substituted smoked paprika... genius! For the carrots, used my julienne peeler and they cooked up beautifully in minutes. Definitely will repeat.

This is a fantastic, and quick recipe. I made it as specified, but with 3/4" steaks rather than fillets. I cut the carrots into very thin strips so that they'd cook quickly and they turned out sweet and nicely cooked. The flavors are wonderful together and I will definitely make this again - it would be a wow at a dinner party but is also just great for a quick weekday meal!

Would definitely do again... served it with couscous, and doctored the recipe a bit: after cooking the fish, sauteed shallots in the butter, added a can of chick peas, and then the carrots. Added a little bit of water to help the carrots cook. Increased the seasonings... Clean plates at my house tonight!

The fish was awesome, but I think next time I would cook the carrots first. It took forever to cook the carrots and we finally served the fish with raw carrots. By the time we were ready to serve, the fish was cold. Where did I go wrong with the carrots? I gave this two forks, although the fish was great and will make that again.

This was a wonderful and easy to prepare dish. I will make it again. But please alert others to not use Chilean sea bass, as it is not caught in a sustainable way. Read the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch guide for what types of seafood are the least harmful to our dear planet. She needs all the help she can get.

I doubled this recipe and made it for a small dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. Minimal prep involved, great presentation and wonderful flavors. Halibut is off season so I used Chilean sea bass instead - wonderful. I used more lemon zest and juice and served the fish with Mediterranean couscous and mixed greens.

Personally, I'd use more cayenne pepper, maybe another 1/8 - 1/4 tsp. But otherwise, it was great! Made it with cous cous and moroccan eggplant salad.

I also served this with couscous and it was excellent. This is the second time I have made this, and substituted swordfish for the halibut (since the halibut did not look as fresh). It came out perfect with so little effort

this was a hit! different flavors and very easy, loved the carrots, do be careful with the cayenne and lemon

Nice. I added a bit of ground coriander and a pinch of allspice then topped with ground toasted hazelnuts. I also baked for about 12 minutes at 450 rather than fry. Easy and very tasty. I just added the nuts, 'cause I had them. Not sure I would go out of my way to toast and grind them just for this, but they did add a really nice flavour and texture.

This will be a fav for us. Added a nonfat yougurt sauce with some tarragon and lemon and served with steamed asparagus. Loved the flavors!

A really great, quick and healthy weeknight dinner. Next time I will do two parts cinnamon to cayenne, as the carrots were really spicy and I would like to taste the cinnamon better. I served with couscous with nuts and currents-- perfect.

Wonderful - tasty and quick. I came home from work, looked on Epicurious for a quick Halibut recipe and threw this together. The flavors really meld together nicely. I made one piece of fish without cayenne and did not add cayenne to the carrots because my daughter dislikes anything remotely spicy. That amount of spice actually seemed fine - I would think any more would mask the cinnamon and lemon. I highly recommend this dish.

Minimum effort, maximum flavor. This was a wonderful dish...I love spicy foods and this was perfect (my forehead is still a little warm as I type this!) i can't think of a thing I would change or substitute. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper for us. I thought the combination of cayenne, lemon and cinnamon seemed interesting and unusual. But the flavors came out super. I substituted chilean sea bass for the halibut, and no regrets for that at all. Superb. You will want to adjust the heat according to your taste. If you'd like it milder, use a straight 1/4 tsp or less of the cayenne.

Really enjoyed. Easy, healthy and something different than the same old fish.

This was really very good and a pleasure to find a recipe with such basic ingredients. I found the recipe using my Epicurious app on my iPhone while at the fish market! I love that. I really didn't measure any of the ingredients and I might have been a little heavy-handed with the cayenne, but we liked it spicy. I did need to serve Kleenex as a "side." I increased the amount of carrots and cut them with the julienne blade of my food processor. So easy.
