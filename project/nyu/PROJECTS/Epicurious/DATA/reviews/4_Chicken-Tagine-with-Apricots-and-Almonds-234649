Great recipe, once the prep is over, it is simple. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and made the following changes: I dry rubbed the thighs (I like thighs for braising) with cinnamon, paprika, cayenne, turmeric, cumin, coriander, cardamon, salt, pepper....I toasted the cumin and coriander seed and added cardamon seed when I put the seeds in the coffee grinder. Then marinated the thighs overnight in lemon and orange juice, but did not cover the skin with juice. I added more onion and garlic, fresh ginger, tomatoe paste, carrots, garbonzo beans, plum tomatoes, used only chicken stock and deleted the honey and cinnmon. Put the chopped parsley and cilantro in the pot for about 10 min and reduced the liquid. Company loved this dish which I served with spiced couscous and fattoush salad. Great dinner.

Great recipe. I've made as written and it is excellent, although a bit oily when making with the chicken skin. My preference (because I'm lazy) is to use pieces of skinless bone-in chicken (used thighs las night and worked it worked really well), and just sprinkle chopped cilantro and parsley into the dish. Goes really well with Quinoa and even roasted potatoes.

This is one of my go-to recipes for comfort food. I once combined the spices, oil & chicken, realized I didn't have time to finish the recipe, so into the freezer it went in a freezer bag. Yumm when used 2 nights ago! I love it over barley or quinoa, with pomegranate glazed carrots. Dee-lish!

Delicious! Sophisticated enough for guests but also well liked by my 6 and 4 year olds. I added the 1/2 tsp each of cumin, coriander, curry, turmeric, allspice, etc. and 1 tsp of paprika as well. This has enough wonderful reviews, mine isn't necessary, but I'm going to be sure to make this again!

I wish I had read the reviews before cooking. Cardamon sounds like an awesome addition. As written, this recipe is nice, and fairly idiot-proof. However, the sauce would have been much improved if some of the chicken fat had been removed. Next time I will take steps to lower the fat content: remove skin from many (but not all) of the chicken parts prior to cooking, and skimming the fat out prior to adding the apricots. I served it with Israeli couscous (medium sized balls) and carrots.

This is best described as culinary heaven! Followed advice and added some toasted and ground cardamom, cumin, coriander ect. The flavor was both complex but smooth. And my kitchen smelled devine whike this cooked up. After browning the chix and cooking the onions and garlic with a smidge of tomato past, i but the whole thing in covered ceramic baker and slow braised in the oven. OMG!!! On third plate as I type!!!

Great recipe as adjusted. Per other comments I added 1 tsp fresh ground cumin, 1 tsp paprika, ground seeds from 10 cardamom pods and a tiny bit of cayenne. I used boneless breasts and the spices dry with no oil. Slow cooked in a heavy enamel casserole for an hour at 300.

I used this recipe as a base, and with a few variations as per other reviewers suggestions / what I had on hand, it was absolutely incredible! I added to the spice rub (1/2 tsp ea paprika, cayenne, and cumin, didn't have coriander, cardamom, or turmeric so I added a splash of allspice and curry powder) and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts since that's what I already had. Only used 1 tbsp of butter to brown the meat. I added tomato paste, can of diced tomatoes, can of garbanzo beans, chopped carrots, and whole apricots right to the onions, then added chicken stock (2 or 3 times the written amount) and the chicken once the liquid boiled. Simmered for 1 / 1 1/2 hour and added orange juice and chopped cilantro near the end. Served over plain couscous. So amazing! I'll be making this again and again.

This was a fantastic meal for our family of six - kids ages 3-10. I added some extra water and garlic to the pan and threw in carrots (4) and sweet potatoes (4) to make a one dish meal. Would definitely make this again. Next time I might try this will chicken thighs only.

I added cumin, paprika, coriander, cayenne and saffron - about 1/2 tsp. each. I used chicken broth instead of water and added about 1 tbs. of tomato paste at the onion browning stage. All in all, I felt this ended up a bit oily even though I took most of the oil out of the pot after I browned the chicken. What I did think was lacking was some lemon to brighten the flavor. So, I added in some lemon zest at the end. It helped. I would make this again but I'd thinly slice a whole lemon and add it to the chicken and spice mixture and let it marinade for at least 6 hours along with some cilantro and Italian parsley. There was a terrific recipe in an old Bon Appetit that I use all the time but is not on the website. It's Chicken Tagine with Olives and Lemon from Ziryab restaurant in Paris. It's my go-to recipe for chicken tagine and has lots of lemon to balance the spices. If Bon Appetit would put this up on the website, it would rank no. 1.

Rating: 3
Really good, but rather oily even with removing the chicken skin. Next time, I would try this recipe but without the butter and much less of the oil as I don't believe it added enough flavour to warrant the oiliness. Highly recommend serving with cous cous. The extra liquid in the dish goes a long way to making the cous cous just super yummy.

Rating: 4
This smells soooo good while it's cooking!! I made it according to the recipe and the review suggestions. I dry rubbed the chicken (breasts with skin) with paprika, cinnamon, cardamon, corriander, crushed ginger, and tumeric and then marinated the spiced breasts in orange juice overnight. I used the OJ marinade plus some stock instead of water. A lot of spice was added, but none of it was measured. Very little oil/butter is required and the extra fat is not missed. I think the amount of oil called for is a typo. Instead of Turkish apricots, I used California dried apricots, mission figs and a handful of raisins - and I just threw them in with the chicken. Similarly, I threw in chopped cilantro and parsley towards the end instead of making a bouquet. My sauce looked thin, so I added 2 tbs of tomato paste and it really thickened and deepend it. Being a veggie lover, I also added chopped carrots, one large diced yam, and two quartered tomatoes. I went light on the honey since I added sweet veggies, OJ and extra dried fruits. Garbanzo would be an excellent compliment but I forgot to add them. I've been to Morocco and other parts of North Africa and this tagine does not taste like any that I ate there, but it is delicious and it smells like it comes from that part of the world so it is certainly authentic enough for me. Lacking an actual tagine dish is not a problem - I made this entire dish in one large heavy bottom pot. I think it would also work in a crock pot and give a similar result. Thanks again Epicurious!

Love, love, loved this dish! It was absolutely amazing! I read reviews from both this recipe and the Tagine with Spiced Pine Nuts; because this had received 4 forks, I used it as my primary. Spices: I did add the cumin, coriander and cayenne spices as recommended in both recipe reviews. I also was a bit more generous and not so precise with the spices since most reviewers did say it needed more. I did add additional freshly grated ginger (to taste) once all ingredients were combined. Cooking: I did not have a traditional tagine to cook in, so used a large 6qt deep covered saute pan; worked perfectly. Chicken: I had Whole Foods cut up the chicken for me, and cooked with all pieces, discarding the backbone at the end. The skin was left on, however, next time I think I will remove the skin to cut down on the fat. The dish is plenty tender and flavorful just cooking on the bone. I did let the chicken marinate in some orange juice and salt before cooking, and used the orange juice in combination with the water to cook in. Was great! I also dusted the chicken pieces with the spice mixture before I browned, and next time will probably marinate in the spices. Finishing: Pulling from the other recipe, I simply added the apricots, cinnamon stick and orange preserves to the dish about 15 min before it was done; did not want to have to cook them separately and did read that viewers thought cooking in the honey was too sweet. The almonds I added just before it was served, so that they still had a bit of texture to them (I also did not fry them due to wanting to save on using any more oil in the recipe). Result: Absolutely, wonderfully full of flavor dish with meat falling off the bone. Served over an almond pilaf (husband isn't crazy about couscous). Without a doubt, a huge hit and a new staple!! Make this tonight!

do you think this would work if i just browned the chicken and then threw everything in a crock pot for a few hours?

Thanks to other reviewers, I also added cumin, corriander and caramom to the spices - and double all of it. I used it to coat 10 ckn thighs and it was delicious. I did NOT make any of the apricot or almond mixture - only the chicken - and it was just what I was looking for. I made it in a 14 inch saute pan and inverted a large domed stoneware bowl over the pan for that tagine effect. It worked surprizingly well! Served it with couscous. I will make this again and try it with the sweet apricots.

Rating: 4
With the additional spices and the amount of spices doubled as recommended in comments, this is delicious. Yellow onion works just as well as red onion. I browned the chicken in the tagine and another pan to make it go faster. Then I added a 1/2 C water to the second pan and used that as the water to add to the tagine to capture the spices left in the pan from the browning.

This was a really good dish, but I made several modifications based on the notes from other chefs. I added 1/2 tsp. each of cumin, coriander, and cardamom, and I reduced the honey a bit. For the fruit, I wanted more variety so I used half dried apricots and half dried figs. Delicious!

This dish is excellent, but too sweet. I added half a glass of wine, 1 tsp of chili (I used go chu ga roo). I also added a teaspoon of cumin. I did not add the cinnamon stick into the apricots. I also cut the amount of butter that I used. I also added a can of drained chick peas after the water was added. It made it a lot hardier.

This was absolutely delicious. I added 1/2 tsp of cumin, cardamom and coriander to the spice mix as others had suggested, and added 1 full tsp of cayenne as we love our food spicy. Also added a 14oz can of garbanzo beans towards the end of the braising. It was perfect -- the richness of the spices was amazing, and the chicken (we used boneless, skinless thighs) was tender and juicy. This will be a staple for years.

Marinated overnight with the rub plus garlic ginger paste, about 2tbs, and lots of cayenne because we like it spicy...Browned the chicken real good. Up the garlic a little. Added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and some freshly cooked chickpeas. Spooned off some of the fat that came to the surface.I have skipped fryind the almonds before, DON'T! It's amazing! I fried it in the leftover oil from the chicken. Served with rice. Oustanding!

3 1/2 forks would be more appropriate fro this recipe. Delicious and very easy to make. Used chicken legs and thighs. I added some cayenne because we like it spicy.

Picky eater hubby liked it but would like less apricots.

What a great dish. This was my first time cooking with tagine and it was EASY. We had a Moroccan dinner party where each couple brought a never before tried dish. This was a HUGE hit. I replaced the apricots with dates. And as other users suggested, I added to the spice mix: Cumin, coriander, paprika, Cayenne, cardamom - Just a half tsp each. Instead of water I used chicken broth (and double the amount the recipe called for). Used boneless skinless chicken breasts. Finally I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes. Will absolutely make again.

I made this for friends during the week and took the suggestion of another reviewer to add spices (cumin, etc.). I also used chicken broth for cooking the fruit (i had prunes, so that's what I used). I actually cooked it the day before which made it easier to take off more fat (I drained the fat after browning the chicken, too). Finally, I chopped up some cured lemons (Thomas Keller's recipe) and added that at the end, which added a little more depth to the sauce (for which I halved the honey). It was very good and my guests said the microwaved leftovers were delicious, too.

This recipe is indeed great for starts but beautiful things really start to happen with adjustments. Instead of water I too used stock (bought a whole chicken, cut out the back, roasted with onions, carrots, olive oil, s&p, herbes de provence then simmered for several hours in water). Omitted dry ginger, used fresh ginger and added with garlic to onions. Cooked chicken/stock/onion mixture on stovetop for 30 minutes, then transferred to 275°f oven for an hour (didn't have tagine, used a dutch oven instead and wanted fall-off-the-bone chicken). Added four small peeled/seeded tomatoes (quartered) before placing in oven. Substituted prunes for apricots and used half the amount of honey (also used stock to simmer prunes instead of water). Removed prunes after 10 minutes and continued reducing to a glaze (which was sweet but completely moderated by the garlic). Next time I might try adding the almonds fifteen minutes before serving as they might do well absorbing flavor. Otherwise I might give them a quick pound in the mortar and pestle so they don't stand out as competition on top of the dish. Overall a fantastic dinner!

This is a great recipe to use as a jumping off point, but it needs a lot of tweaks. Most tagines I have had are never this sweet. For a more savory but still flavorful tagine I changed a few things. First, I added to the spice mix: Cumin, coriander, paprika, Cayenne, cardamom - Just a half tsp each. Instead of water I used chicken broth (and double the amount the recipe called for). Used boneless skinless chicken thighs to cut down on fat but keep flavor. Added carrots. Simmered for an hour and a half. Completely scrapped the honey and cinnamon stick and just added the apricots right to the chicken. Served over basmati rice. Excellent, with no cloying sweetness from caramelized honey and fruit.

YUMMY!! This is the first Epicurious recipe in a while that has really blown me away with its deliciousness. I used 3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and recommend it. Skipped the cilantro and parsley, used curry powder in place of turmeric, and just pan toasted the almonds. Served with roasted vegetables and wild rice, and will be making this over and over again.

This was very flavorful and delicious. I have been trying all kinds of variations in Moroccan recipes. We loved this. I would agree that after browning (I used legs and thighs) I would pour off a lot of the fat before adding the onion. I loved how you stewed the apricots in honey and water first before adding to the pot (I used a Dutch oven). I used California apricots, and that was very tasty prepared this way. In other Moroccan dishes such as lamb prepared in a similar manner, one could use this method with the apricots. In other variations after the onion and garlic is sautéed, other ingredients are sometimes added such as chickpeas, tomatoes. The meat could be seasoned ahead of time and refrigerated to marinate if you wished. Either way you prepare this, the basic version of seasoning, browning, sautéing ingredients and then simmering in a liquid is delicious and is fun to experiment with the slight variations I have found in Moroccan tagine recipes.

Rating: 4
Subtle, exotic and delicious. Taking note of previous reviewers I used unsweetened apricots and cut down the fat by browning unboned chicken thighs skin down then pouring out most of the fat before adding the onions. I would cut down a little on the water next time as I had to boil down the sauce a bit and you can always add more as you go. Company fare for a crowd, do-ahead, economical, pretty simple and very tasty.

Not bad but am surprised it rates so highly. Too sweet and oily for me if made as indicated. Made it with chicken stock, boneless chicken breast chunks, and toasted almonds. Added lemon juice at the end to cut sweetness. If I make it again, I would halve the butter/oil and use California apricots for a tangy contrast.

This was my first time cooking in a tagine, and I have to say it was a "wow" dish with incredible flavor. After reading all the reviews I made a few small adjustments. I used boneless, skinless chicken. Chicken on the bone would provide more flavor, but removing the skin reduces the oil that others complained about. I added chicken broth instead of water to the chicken. I did not fry the nuts in oil. I didn't have almonds, so I pan toasted pinenuts. Pan toasting greatly reduces the oil. I chopped the cilantro and parsley and threw it in without the string. Net time I would delay adding the cilantro and parsley until when you add the apricots to keep the greens brighter. The most important change I believe I made was I used California instead of Turkish apricots. To me Turkish apricots are too sweet, while California apricots provide a tart compliment to the honey. I thought the resulting flavors were really great. I will make again. I am wondering about finishing the dish in the oven instead of on the stove and may try that in the future.

Delightfully good! We used all dark meat chicken, thighs and drumsticks. To reduce fat content, as another reviewer commented this seemed too fatty as written, we drained the fat after browining the chicken and dry pan toasted, not oil toasted, the nuts. Pignolias work in place of the almonds too. Also, try 1 tbsp Ras el hanout, if you can find it, in place of the specified spices for a little different flavor twist on another iteration of this. It was equally delicous using that spice blend.

I love this recipe and it's very easy adaptable. I make it in the pressure cooker for 10 - 12 minutes rather than simmering for 30. I found that adding vegetables as someone suggested, led to more "sauce" being produced, which I liked a lot-- great over Israeli couscous. (I added a small eggplant, 2 zucchini and some cut up, peeled butternut squash). Really delicious. Loved the spice combo

I thought this was delicious and so did my family. I used chicken broth instead of water in both the chicken and the sauce. I also added lemon juice, raisins and cranberries to the sauce. I didn't have any tumeric so I just skipped that ingredient. It was excellent over sticky rice. I would skin the chicken before I make it again -- I didn't think the extra fat was necessary.

This recipe turned out awesome. I made it exactly as written with two exceptions. I switched the powdered ginger to a ginger paste (and I added about a teaspoon and a half) and I added pitted green olives... which might sound odd but I love tagines with olives, and I liked the salty, briny bitter olives with the sweet apricots and cinnamon honey broth. I'll definitely be making it again!

This is a very very good recipe, but not quite 4 folks, I would probably give it 3 1/2 if I could. I followed the suggestions of previous posters and reduced the oil and butter. I still found that there was too much grease at the end. I might try chicken without skins, though I think it might get dry if one does this. OK, all of that said, the spices were very tasty and the sauce was great with both rice and couscous. This dish was a big hit with my guests and there was almost none left over, despite my making twice as much!

This is actually my least favorite recipe I ever made from Epicurious (or probably ever). It wasn't horrible, but it was nothing great and I was disappointed I made it with guests over.

I have made this twice and my husband devours it. If you start the apricot mixture first, it is finished by the time you are ready to add it to the chicken. I cut the apricots up into smaller pieces with a scissors. I agree that the amount of oil called for is too much and I use about half called for in the chicken and just cooking spray for the toasted almonds. To "impacked from Calif": Yes you could let this sit for an hour after cooking, no problem. The second time I made this, I added a can of garbanzo beans, sprinkled with more of the spice mixture, into the chicken about halfway through the cooking and used chick broth instead of water -doubling the amount. The garbanzo beans make the sauce thicker and add a nice texture. Don't leave out the almonds.

I've already reviewed this recipe once before (four forks), but I made it again last night to rave reviews and just wanted to address two things. One, to the reviewer who asked if anyone hadn't made it in a tagine - yes, I unfortunately don't have room in my apartment kitchen for specialty kitchenware like tagines, so I just make it in an ordinary stockpot, and it works great! And two, like some of the others, I find 2 T. of fat to be way too much - I made it last night with 1 T. of butter for more than 4 lbs. of boneless skinless thighs, and that was plenty. Love this recipe!

Excellent...but didn't follow recipe exactly. I added sliced mushrooms at the onion stage of cooking, and cut oil to about 1 or 2 Tbsp. Used skinless chicken. Also, did NOT fry the almonds, but toasted them. Lovely served over couscous, which soaks up the thin gravy nicely. Keeper.

I made this last night, and it will become a regular dish in our house. Its relatively quick and easy - I made it all in one frypan and served with couscous.

I used boneless chicken thighs which absorbed the flavours beautifully.

I have made this for guests twice and they have LOVED it. I use a cut-up chicken but remove some of the skin. The frying of the almonds is not really necessary. Just buy toasted whole almonds and sprinkle those on. I also like to cut up the apricots into quarters instead of half. I make this in my tagine and it is so tender. If you really want an amazing tagine try the Beef Short Ribs Tagine with Squash. It is the best.

This was really delicious, but also very oily. I'd suggest halving the oil and butter you use to cook the chicken, and roasting the almonds with no oil at all. More importantly, strain out half or more of the oil/butter/chicken drippings after cooking the onion/garlic mixture.

I don't know if it contributed to its deliciousness, but I made it several days in advance of when we ended up eating it. It warmed up beautifully and was delicious served over couscous. I chopped the green herbs and left them in, and I skipped the almonds. I will definitely be making this all through the fall and winter!

The recipe is very good as listed. Just one addition; after you combine the apricot mixture, continue cooking uncovered until the liquid boils off.

I loved this recipe because it delivers maximum flavor for minimum difficulty. True, it takes a bit of time to prepare all the steps, but all the techniques are quite simple - and the final product is very impressive!

I followed the recipe; however, added twice the garlic and used chicken thighs. Served with short grain brown rice. The kids left nothing for leftovers!!!

This was delicious, even before the addition of the apricots. My husband couldn't believe how many testing pieces "fell" off the chicken during the final stages of cooking. :) This recipe is good on pork chops too. I served with rice and raisins.

ooops, mixed up my recipes in the last review...no saffron to omit...but with the thickened apricot mixture and increased almonds, I will make this again and again...:)

Loved it! Omitted the saffron, thickened the apricots with cornstarch and water, served on couscous, and it was divine! Will double the almonds next time, they punctuated it nicely!

delicious. Had no honey so I used maple syrup. Worked well.

Made this twice, with 2 lbs of boneless chicken breasts cut into smallish pieces instead of the 3 lbs of bigger pieces as the recipe suggests. I'm always a fan of dishes involving spices and meat and dried fruit (raisins, prunes, apricots..), and this recipe was no exception. Served over herbed couscous once, and simply over rice another. Delicious either way.

added more ginger to the recipe and a can of tomatoe paste with some chicken broth with saffron. It was really good with couscous, definitly will make this again

Aside from having trouble getting the apricots to glaze, we thought this dish was delicious. I didn't even add salt but used leftover chicken broth instead. It was very tasty. My toddler loved it!

Quite good, put I've put twice less salt and three times more water, otherwise it's too dry. And much more ginger, miam!

I'm a huge fan on North African cooking and seek out any interesting versions of tagine I can find, but this was a big disappointment. I'm happy to go through many steps and spend time on a dish if it's worth it, but this wasn't- bland and uninspired, in my opinion. Try something else
