This was only one of two deserts I made at Thanksgiving, but everyone raved about this tarteven those who had declared their dislike of anise. This pastry dough recipe has long been a favorite, and the anise would work well with pear, too, I think. The filling is a bit richer than my usual, but this one will the the recipe I use from here on out. I used a 10" pan, so I had some filling left over; I put it in a ramekin and baked it alongside the pie. Scrumptious.

What a lovely, light pumpkin tart. The anise seed gave it a very interesting, but subtle flavour. A chef friend asked for the crust recipe in particular as he liked it so much. If anyone didn't like this pie, it was because they didn't like pumpkin at all.

the crust on this is delicious however i felt the filling was a bit too rich. there was just enough filling to fill 11" tart pan. it does shrink a bit during baking so dont worry too much about "overfillign". overall, a good alternative to traditional pumpkin pie.

This is was a refreshing twist on traditional pumpkin pie at our Thanksgiving table that met with raves from everyone, even our four year old dinner guest. The more spread-out tart format prevented the pumpkin custard from becoming too thick and dense. The anise-seed crust smelled ambrosial and tasted like a biscotti. We served this with a honey-ginger- rosemary ice cream on the side for those who wanted their tart a la mode. For a dessert wine pairing, we served an aged muscat from Australia that was delicious. This will definitely become part of the holiday menu rotation.

We loved it. I made it for Thanksgiving 2008. The combination of the sweet pastry dough and the anise was great. As mentioned by another reviewer, you need to like anise, but I didn't find the tasty overwhelming. It pairs well with the pumpkin. I used an 11 inch tart pan and it filled up perfectly to the edge - no overflow.

This was a delicious tart. I gave it 4 forks b/c of the crust, which was outstanding! If you don't like anise though, you won't like this crust as there were several of our guests that don't care for anise that didn't care for the crust. The filling was a good, but nothing unusually grand for pumpkin pie. I'd definitely make this again!

You throw out pumpkin pie filling??!! Put it in another dish and bake it, eat it like pudding. I haven't tried this one, but it sounds interesting.

My only caution is to use a tart pan with high enough sides. Otherwise, you'll end up throwing out some of the filling since it will overflow the tart pan. The tart was wonderful with whipped cream, though it's got so much fat already.

The recipe came out fine, but personally, I didn't think that the anise worked well with the pumpkin. My guests liked it and it didn't taste bad, but I thought it was just ok and nothing to rave about.
