Bleeh! I don't know why, but the turnips turned grayish (in a stainless All Clad pan) during the 2 hour wait. Unappetizing appearance and flavor.

Best mash potatoes I ever taste. It needs little works but it is worth all the works.

Very good, a little time consuming, although most can be done ahead of time.

This dish is perfect for enticing those who really do not care for turnip. The turnip takes on a mild flavor enhanced by the white wine, bay leaf, and chicken stock. My guests have come to expect this dish for all of my holiday celebrations!

I made this for a dinner party in 1991 and again for Thanksgiving a year later, it was a favorite. I have since been asked several times to make it again, only I lost the receipe. After several illfated attempts to recreate it gave up. Today I found the receipe again and am thrilled!!!! These potatoes melt in you mouth.
