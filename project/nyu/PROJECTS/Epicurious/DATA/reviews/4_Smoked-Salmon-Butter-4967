Simple is so often best. This is an amazing spread. The recipe is actually an accompaniment to "Triple Seafood Chowder with Dill" which is excellent on its own, but the salmon butter puts it over the top.

Very, very nice. Rich, buttery, smoky deliciousness. It was the star of the party.

I love this on angel hair pasta to crackers! This is the suggested compliment to the Seafood Chowder and it is great for that, but it is heavenly on it's own too! I also enjoy it with Epi Bread and a big leafy green salad with lots of veggies and 'stuff' in it as an entree option for quick meals.

We love smoked salmon and always bring our favorite Nova Salmon from Zabars, as well as bagels when we visit New York City. This recipe, so easy and so delicious with the addition of the dill, is a winner! You might also like to try Double-Dip Salmon, another favorite of ours, on Epicurious.

Truly a supurb spread when made with the thicher, cold smoked salmon that you get from the better delicatesens. it is worth the extra price you pay for the really good product. The addition of lime juice in place of Carol Kazules' lemon juice adds a certain clencher to the taste; just don't use too much.

I agree - why so few reviews. It's really simple and very good. I use smoked nova salmon pieces which are dirt cheap ($3/8 oz)and have used dried dill successfully but fresh dill makes it more party fare. I usually add a little fresh lemon juice because - well - it fits!

How sad that I'm the first person to rate. This is excellent for snacking b/4 a party and a heck of a lot healthier than most "dips". Also works very well with pink meat trout. No white meat hatchery raised fish.
