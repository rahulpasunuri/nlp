I have made this cake 3 times and each time,the cake breaks in half as I take it from the pan! Anyone know why? The taste of the cake itself is very nice, and with the pineapple filling it goes up one level, just really wonder why it always breaks when I remove it from the pan!

This cake was a big hit for my dinner party. BF and I demolished the few leftovers and found it even better the next day. My main modification was to use buttermilk in place of regular. The cake layers were tender, light and perfectly formed. Also, I prefer white coconut to toasted. I had a hard time with the seven minute frosting - but that was my fault.

This is my mother's favorite cake. I make the recipe exactly as it is written and it turns out wonderfully. The basic cake is a fantastic, sweet yellow cake that I have used for lots of other things too. That's something to keep in mind, as many reviewers suggested to add coconut milk, but I like the yummy yellow cake in this recipe just the way it is. I agree, though about the icing - it takes a lot longer than 7 minutes. I've also made this recipe as cupcakes without the pineapple and they're enthusiastically received.

It came out perfect, but it´s just not my type of cake. I won´t make it again.

Great Cake! Always gets raves from those coconut lovers. I typically use a recipe aas a starting place and improvise. For this one to amp up the coconut flavour coconut milk is substituted for the milk. Tossed the dry ingredients into the food processor with one cup of lightly toasted coconut. Instead of vanilla add dark rum in cake, syrup and frosting. Make a simple syrup with the remainder of the coconut milk and brush on the baked layers. I prefer lightly toasted coconut as noted in the recipe. You can skip the pineapple or not depending on preferences.

Simply divine! I added 1 cup of coconut directly to the batter, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of coconut extract, and made a cream cheese frosting with 1 tsp of coconut extract. My boyfriend bugs me to make it once a week!

I have made this cake twice this year. I don't usually like pineapple--very tasty. Made for my brother's belated birthday during our family reunion in July. It was gone the next day. This goes in the pile with the good ones!!!

Made this with a few modifications for a party I catered and everybody raved. I added chopped toasted macadamia nuts to the cake batter and reduced the vanilla to 1/2 tsp & added 1 tsp. of coconut extract. The 7 minute frosting took 20 + minutes!

I am cake decorator and I wanted something untraditional to make for my brother's birthday. I am so glad I chose this recipe. It flew off the plate in no time. I had a house filled with happy people who really enjoyed a delicious cake.

I made this recipe in a 9 X 13 pan for a Luau party. It was much easier to make it a non-layer cake, and also easier to serve a crowd. Because my best friend is allergic to dairy, I used margarine and as another reviewer suggested, 1 c. coconut milk (unsweetened), and 1 c. shredded coconut. From another recipe, I made a rum syrup (a basic sugar syrup with a good portion of rum added after dissolving the sugar), which I poured over the cake while it cooled. After cooling, I topped it with the pineapple. I've never seen a cake disappear that fast. It was very moist, light, and deliciously coconutty. Everyone raved about it. I highly recommend this cake, with the changes noted above. Without the coconut milk, I don't think it would be anything but a simple white cake. Really, use coconut milk... it is wonderful!

Everyone raved about this cake. Don't be afraid about cutting the cake into layers. Take your time, it was easy.

How disappointing. Have never heard of 'cake flour' - looked it up online and it appears to be an American thing. Not available in Australia. Maybe the flour was the problem? Very heavy, floury, dense, tasteless cake. Filling was gluggy. Cake fell apart upon cutting. I am so disappointed!

I have used the filling for this cake so many times in my coconut cake; but I don't use the cake recipe, I use my own yellow cake recipe. I also don't use the seven minute frosting because I'm not to fond of seven minute frosting. I use buttercream frosting on this cake and people tell me that the cake is so good its better than ice cream. There is one other thing I do to make this cake taste better; when I add the filling between the layers I also add a little buttercream frosting.

This is a good basic recipe but I like a richer coconut cake flavor to balance the pineapple filling. I substituted coconut milk for the milk and added 1 cup of flaked coconut to the batter and it made a world of difference. When I put the cake together I cut the layers in half and had 3 layers of pineapple filling which made for a very sexy summer cake!

This was suprisingly yummy. Although I love to cook and experiment with recipes, I am not usually a cake maker. The recipe was easy to follow and the result was delicious. The frosting added just the right amount of sweetness to the cake. I did not use the whole bag of coconut; about 2/3 of the bag would have been enough.

I really like this cake and will be sure to make it again. But the recipe needs to be a bit more clarative about some of the cooking techiques. It took me awaile to figure it out.

The cake was very sweet and much too dense for my preference. I did not try the icing. I just made a whipped topping for it. It was altogether okay but nothing special. Much prettier to look at than tasty. I had been hoping for something light and not too rich.

Glorious! I've never had such a successfully tasty and beautiful layer cake. I also used a 20-oz can of pineapple and found it made ample filling for 3 layers. It was deliciously flavorful, but use more and I'd be afraid it would seep out the sides. The cake itself, as everyone said, is moist and spongy - wonderful! I've never cared for 7-minute icing so I used sweetened whipped cream and it was delicious. Next time, I will try flavoring the cream with rum and it will be a true "pina colada cake"! Also, I didn't find this to be particularly complicated, and I think it would be great for a dinner party because the filling and cake can be made ahead, and the assembly is not difficult and can be done the morning of. I transported this cake in a 2-hour car ride and then let it sit in the car another 2 hours and it held up superbly. Thanks Gourmet!!!

I've been making this recipe since it was published. It's terrific! It's for the experienced cook. The cake definitely needs to be made as written with cake flour, as it is extremely tender and tasty that way. This is a big winner for my coconut-loving mom...I'm making it for her 60th birthday.

I had trouble with this recipe and I'm looking for help. The frosting and filling turned out fine, but the cake was dense and tasted like flour. I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour, so that might be it, and perhaps I did not blend the cake batter well enough. Any ideas would be helpful as I'd like to make this again and have it turn out as well as it did for everyone else

The cake was simply delicious. I would suggest an extra TB of corn starch and 8 oz less pineapple in the filling.

I made this cake for a dinner party and it was lovely! It took me about 12 minutes for the 7-minute frosting - but it was terrific!!! The cake crumb was out of this world - very soft and several of my guests commented on how light it was. I would definetly make this cake over and over again. I will also try it with a lemon curd filling.

I made this cake about 3 years ago and it was a hit! It took some time but it was worth it. This year I will make it for Christmas and maybe add so some color I think I will dye the coconut flakes green and red.

I was so surprised to see this cake, it is almost identical to my grandmothers cake we all loved so much, just a couple of differences, but the taste is the same!

So good... this cake, although time consuming to make, was well worth the effort and the texture is beautiful. I would definitely make it again but perhaps try a different filling such as lemon just for a change; however, the pineapple was really nice. The icing is especially lovely -- light and not too sweet.

I should have listened to the previous reviews.

the cake was mediocre; the filling was too sweet and never set; the icing was eaaasy to make, routine 7-minute icing. i made this in july 2000 (the recipe was printed in 1985)and maybe the canned pineapple is different and that may account for it not setting. but there are better yellow cake recipes around.

This was a winner from birthday cake. Caution after baking make sure to cover cake to keep the icing fresh.. then will last several days. Again a keeper.

Yummy! Nice and moist. Though the fosting was very exhausting to make. I gave up on the frosting and made my own. (A light buttercream.) Overall, the cake went over very well with my freinds and family. Would make again, except the frosting.

An excellent recipe. I have made it with pineapple, but I really like to use fresh lemon curd as the filling. Raspberry jam is another great option.

The actual cake part of this was good but the frosting was exhausting to make. Also, I found that the leftover cake didn't hold because the icing became gritty and dry.
