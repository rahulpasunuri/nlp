Wow, how easy can it get? I added a bit of honey, ginger, soy sauce per other reviewers. Forgot to put it in the upper third of oven and it was scorched black in about 15 minutes, but surprisingly it didn't taste or smell burnt when done. It actually smelled like cake. Kids loved it and it went well with the Asian-Style Slaw.

I took other reviewer's advice and decided to spice it up a bit with some chili oil mixed into the sauce before brushing it on the chicken. It was surprisingly good and so simple that I will surely make it again.

Not a big fan of chicken legs nor is my family but I had a bunch that I couldn't leave in the freezer any more. Like another reviewer, I added garlic, ginger and oyster sauce. I loved it...thought it was easy, tasty and used up them chicken legs! I would do this on bone in, skin on chicken breasts.

A solid 3 forks. Nice quick and simple meal. Not bland at all as others commented. Three year old loved it. We will certainly make this again. 3 forks given as it was good and yummy, but lacked the 4 fork impact that so many recipies on this site produce.

This is such an easy and foolproof recipe.I found the taste was perfect as directed.I served it with Israeli couscous and recieved rave reviews.....

I must agree that this is quick and easy but it is short on taste. To me it needs too much doctoring so I'd just as soon make something else that has more flavor.

I thought this was good--it certainly was easy. I made it with the slaw, which was a nice accompaniment. The day after I made it, I went out with office mates to an Asian restaurant for lunch, which reminded me once again that just about anything I make is going to be better than what I get out--including this dish!

Even with the addition of garlic and chile, this tastes way too much like that red "Ah-So" sauce that was used for Chinese ribs in the 60's. Back in June 1987, Bon Appetit ran a recipe for Hoisin Barbecued Spareribs -- much more complex, with honey and soy and szechuan bean sauce, etc. -- more work but way more flavor -- I will go back to using that on chicken.

The cooking time does seem to be a problem, I tried 500 for 10 min and 350 for 30. Worked well. I'm thinking remove the skin and follow the recipie or flash bake the chicken as above then add the sauce. I'm not as reluctant to jazz up the sauce as others, but it could be my hosin. Quick, easy, suprized the roomies, will make again.

I love Asian flavourings, as does my boyfriend,but neither one of us liked this chicken. It isn't a terrible recipe, just not great or even "average". As per the other reviewers' comments I added lime juice, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil, but even that failed to liven up the chicken. I found the hoisin sauce to be quite overpowering in this dish, which may be due to the fact that I bought cheap hoisin sauce at the supermarket. Better hoisin sauce might have made a difference, but I'm not sure how much. However, I also found that cooking the chicken at 500 degrees led to chicken that didn't cook evenly. My better instincts told me to cook it at 350, but I decided to trust the recipe. Even after 30 minutes I had lots of pink around the bone, and the chicken ended up drying out quite a bit due to increased time in the oven. This recipe may be easy, but it is just as easy for me to cheat and use the President's Choice dressings and marinades on chicken...just as easy (if not easier), but much more delicious.

Easiest recipe I've tried from this site, literally fail-proof. Just keep an eye on the chickent while it's baking. Chili oil gives a nice subtle kick, along w/ honey, lime juice and rice vinegar.

This is a great recipe for weeknights - fast & easy - served with the Asian slaw & some basmati rice cooked with coconut milk - it seemed like a special meal - I agree with adding soy, honey, rice vinegar, & garlic to the hoisin - just a bit of each. My kids loved it, too.

Sooooo easy. I love this site -- per the other reviewers I added garlic, honey, and sweet wine and it turned out terrific. I served it to guests, but it is an easy mid-week meal as well.

This was good, although way too sweet for my liking. Next time I will add less hoisin sauce and more extras. I added fresh ginger, fresh garlic, sesame oil, wine and lime juice. I know, why bastardize it and then review it? Ahh well, it was better than just hoisin sauce and five spice. I served it over a brown/wild rice mix.

Rating: 2
This was good, but I believe it turned out because I followed the advise of other reviewers and added items such as honey, garlic, sweet wine and soy. I also marinated overnight and the flavor really sunk in. Next time I will try with 1/2 hoisen and 1/2 bbq sauce as one woman recommended - it needs a little more "tang."

I made this dish using just chicken wings and my guests loved it. Quick, easy and even better heated up the next day.

We've made this numerous times now. It's one of the easiest dishes to make and the taste is so good that we've renamed it "rock star chicken" in our house.

I like this dish because my child the super-picky five year old likes it. However, I recently made a discovery. I was living on the East Coast, where when you buy hoisin sauce in the store...you get stuff that does not already have 5 spice in it (or at least, not much) Now I live in the southwest, and made a blunder when I casually picked up hoisin in the market...thinking it would be the same. I was wrong...not only did it have enough 5 spice in it that to add more was overpowering...it also had enough MSG to affect both of us. Silly me, having to re-learn to read labels. But I think this dish tastes much better when you use hoisin that does not already have 5 spice in it.

This was very easy. A great last minute, impressive recipe. I thinned out the hoisin w/a bit of water (white wine also works)and used chicken thighs instead. I increased the 5-spice powder as well. I was equally successful using this recipe on baby back pork ribs.

I added lemon jce, soy sauce, honey as other reviewers recommended. I baked it 375 for 45 min and it turned out great. We had Coconut Ginger Rice and had a great meal.

it must have been the hoisin sauce i used because that and 5-spice powder are two of my favorite flavorings but this just didn't say "let's do it again next week". but i do think it's worth tinkering with and i probably will.

A nice easy recipe. I used grocery store bought hoisen sauce which was OK, but not fantastic. I added some soy sauce (1 T), chinese mustard (3 t) and a splash of sherry. I had never cooked chicken at 500 degrees but it worked like a charm!

These are SO good! Used Koon Chun brand of hoisin, bought at Oriental store. Added chopped garlic, 2 tablespoons of rice wine (can use dry sherry, instead) 2 tablespoons of dark soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of honey. Baked in a 350 oven for 1 hour. We were fighting over the drippings in the pan! I also marinated the chicken in the sauce for a few hours.

Nope. Didn't feel like adding BBQ sauce!! Just a bit of garlic, lemon juice, dark soya and honey. Just a bit of each. And I agree it needs good quality hoisin sauce! YUMMY!!!!! And sooooooo simple. Thks Gourmet. Cooked the chicken at 375° for 45-50 min. Just to avoid incrusted burnt sauce. This recipe is now a family favourite. With basmati rice and green salad : miam, miammmm!!

Much depends on the hoisin sauce you buy. The stuff in most grocery stores is way inferior. Buy the real thing at a Chinese grocery or order by mail. It should be very thick, sweet, tangy, & strong, almost like a very thick BBQ sauce. I bought the China Bowel brand in an American grocery--a limp, tasteless parody of real hoisin sauce. If that's all you can get, take the Chinese lady's advice & goose it with a real thick tangy BBQ sauce, sugar, & some rice wine or even a tad of dry sherry.

My mom (I'm 2nd-gen Chinese American) suggested substituting 1/2 of the hoison sauce with BBQ sauce and adding a bit of rice wine, soy sauce, and sugar. It worked great!

I did not think these chicken legs were anything special. The upside is that they were very easy, but definitely not memorable. They seemed to need something...else in addition to the hoisin sauce and the five-spice.

Delicious and ridiculously easy. I made this with chicken breasts and baked them at 350 for 25 minutes. YUM! Whenever I've had a long day, this will be the dish to make.

Easy, Fun, Fast and Healthy recipe for the busy cook! I baked breasts for 25min/350dg with a side of Coconut Jasmine rice and a Sesame Soy Salad in 30min (combined prep and cook).

So easy, so delicious, SO EASY! We served this simple dish with white jasmine rice and a japanese cucumber salad. I will make this regularly. But, if you do not like a sweet dinner, this recipe isn't for you.

Yum! I was amazed that so few ingredients could taste so well. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and baked them at 425 degrees for 30 min. The chicken was VERY tender and it smelled wonderful while baking. I'll definitely make this again.

This was soooo easy. 10 minute preparation max. I used chicken wings instead of drumsticks. My guest asked if she could take the leftovers home! **I sprayed Pam on the foil before baking to prevent any sticking***

This is a very easy and tasty family dinner recipe but I wouldn't serve it for company. It couldn't be easier, and has lots of flavor. Different from the norm. I added sliced green onions to the chicken and sauce while baking, which made the sauce a bit more interesting over the rice. Also served the asian cucumber salad on the side. A simple meal that feels a little special and different for a weeknight.

This was a tasty dish that was simple to make. My husband liked it a lot (who is normally a picky eater). He said it reminded him of duck (probably because of the hoisin sauce, which is commonly served with duck in a Chinese dish). I will make this again.

Tried this recipe with chicken legs and also did it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. The chicken thighs were a big hit as there wasn't as much juice coming out of the chicken as it baked so the sauce stayed thick and gooey. Served over linguine, it was tasty. Adjust cooking time for thighs.

This is a great dish for a weeknight or for entertaining. It has a lot of flavor as well as being easy to prepare and doesn't require a lot of fussing. Try serving this with white rice and sunomono, and it's be a great summer dish!!

This is fast, simple, and very tasty for those of us who like chicken legs. Try it with sliced cucumbers tossed with chili oil and sesame seeds... a great combo.

This recipe is the easiest I've made to date. It is very tasty. Taste vs prep time is very high. I will definately make it again, perhaps with chicken breasts.
