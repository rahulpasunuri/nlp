This is fabulous. There is a restaurant in Switzerland in the countryside near Geveva which makes something called a tarte au creme, and this is the closest thing I have had like it (they serve theirs without the prunes). I had a roll of pate feuillete (puff pastry) which I used instead of a sweet pastry dough, served it with whipped cream - luscious.

We truly enjoyed this recipe! We love prunes and this was a delightful and creative way to enjoy them.
