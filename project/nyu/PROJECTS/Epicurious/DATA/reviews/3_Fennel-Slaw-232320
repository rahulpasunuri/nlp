Blech, I am surprised at the good reviews for this recipe. I tried it tonight and thought the vinegar completely overpowered all the other flavors. I'd suggest adding the vinegar 2 T at a time until you get to the amount you want. I am sad I wasted all my delicious fennel on this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with the best slaw I ever tasted. Served at a cookout and it was a hit. Will definitely make again.

I love fennel but thought this was just OK. Nothing special.

Having made this slaw multiple times I second the previous rater's sentiments - it's a divine take on slaw and a wondeful iteration on a most refreshing vegetable, fennel. I use my Oxo mandoline to slice the vegetables as thin as possible, and the toasted seeds are easily crushed with a mortar and pestle - some irregularity in the spice grind adds a rustic touch to the dish. Omitting the red onions also lightens the salad. Perfect complement to jerk pork tenderloin or other spicy barbecued meats.
