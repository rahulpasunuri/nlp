I made this again, once more following the recipe and preparation exactly. Except this time I also roasted some eggplant alongside the mushroom and cubes it before tossing it in. Still a perfect, earthy, satisfying dish!

I followed the recipe exactly, using sprouted whole wheat papardelle, and it was wonderful. Just as good the next day for lunch, too. I would not change a thing in the preparation, it is perfect the way it is.

this was a simple recipe -- i spiced it up with a little crushed red pepper, roasted the garlic, sauteed the mushrooms, threw in some sundried tomatoes, and toasted the pine nuts before adding them in. basil works well with this -- fresh basil would be better.

Agree with the majority of reviews that this was good but not great. My kids enjoyed it and it's healthy (I cut down on the oil by about half), so I will make it again. Only changes were skipping the blanching step and sauteeing the mushrooms rather than baking them.

This pasta dish was very dry and did not have much flavor. I think it would be better if you would just saute the spinach leaves instead of boiling them first.

I was going to make this dish for a dinner party and thought I better sample it first. Good thing that I did, because I found the dish extremely boring. The only tasty part of the dish were the mushrooms. Not worth the effort.

Good Eats! I used baby portabellas (that's just my personal preference) but didn't broil them, I just sauteed them like a lot of the other cooks. For the meatlover's in my family I added chicken sauteed in garlic, olive oil and white wine. My husband loved it that way. I could have lived without it, but it certainly didn't take anything away from it. The pine nuts really made this dish. I can't wait to make it again!

This was pretty good - nice fall flavors. Like another reviewer I sauteed the mushrooms instead of baking them, and I didn't blanch the garlic. I also toasted the pine nuts in the oven rather than sauteing them and substituted Asiago cheese for the Parmesan. Not the best pasta dish I have made, but a good weeknight meal.

Excellent flavor! I made this recipe for 2 using 4oz of pappardelle (interesting pasta!), 1/4 cup pine nuts, lots of garlic and 2 medium portobellos. Next time I will use larger or 3 portobellos. The combination of the mushroom, pine nuts, garlic and parmesan is fantastic and the spinach is an added bonus. I served it with a chopped salad, Gourmet May 2001.

This was the first recipe I tried with portobello mushrooms and my husband and I love it. We've been hooked on these mushrooms ever since. It is a simple recipe with clean flavors. I've never seen pappardelle, so we've used fettucini.

We had to improvise a bit. We added mizithra cheese, and romano. Also, we sauteed the mushrooms instead of baking them. Teenagers who hate mushrooms ate it cold the next day!

This recipe sounded so great but it turned out rather mediocre. It tasted on the bland side - needed zing!

This was my first recipe with portobello mushrooms, and I wowed my company with it! Outstanding!
