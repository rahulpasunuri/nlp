I first made this when the recipe came out in Gourmet, over 20 years ago. So happy to rediscover something I'd forgotten, but that both my husband and I loved. Great as dessert or part of a breakfast/brunch. It showed me what a good combination grapefruit and crystallized ginger make.

yum yum My husband. This is an easy way to dress up a weekend breakfast. My husband specifically requests it.

I presented this to my boyfriend who asked what it was. When I said grapefruit he said, 'I'll try it but I don't like grapefruit'. He then proceeded to inhale the entire thing and ask if we had more grapefruit. When I replied 'yes', he said 'good'. Oh, and I loved it too! Simple to make and delicious.

I am going to try adding ginger to my mother's classic grapefruit recipe: drizzle honey on top of a chilled half of grapefruit and then put it in the broiler (or toaster oven broiler) for about 2 minutes until the top is hot, the bottom is cold. It is delicious. With ginger it will be even better.

Very easy. I served this to our inn guests and the comment is always - "What a nice change from just plain old grapefruit". I've made it a day in advance and 2 hours in advance. Doesn't make a difference.

Wow, I haven't made this dish, but I regularly make a similar one of my own creation: I peel and remove the membranes from a whole grapefruit and add maybe 3 Tablespoons of chopped crystallized ginger. Mmm... great breakfast. Definitely try it if you like both ingredients.
