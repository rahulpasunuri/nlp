This looked way too labor-intensive (long live Gourmet!), so I tried using the same basic ingredients, substituting ground cumin for cumin seeds and leaving out the sour cream. I chopped the mint by hand and stirred it along with the cumin and salt into some Greek yogurt right out of the tub (no straining). It only took about five minutes and my dinner party guest RAVED. I did let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, but I think it would still have been pretty good if I'd served it right away.
