Great versatility and delicious. Made a few substitutions: tortillas, caramelized onion, baby spinach, oven grilled red pepper, summer squash and eggplant. For extra flavor I brushed a combination of olive oil, pepper, kosher salt, oregano, minced garlic and hot pepper flakes on one side of the tortillas, as well as the grilled vegetables and used the broiler instead of the grill. Because of the melting issue I used a mixture of mozzarella and goat cheese with a basil chiffonade. Instead of grilling I used the oven at 400 for ten minutes to melt the cheese.

Pretty good, although be sure not to buy pre-cooked chorizo--as you won't get the crumbed sausage effect with that. There is a problem with the cheese not melting and my pitas burned on the bottom as well waiting for it to do so! But the goat cheese tastes better melted--maybe I'll try spreading the goat cheese on the pita next time?

this was excellent - don't wait for goat cheese to melt; it doesn't! A great lite supper or could be a party appetizer.

I used turkey chiorzo (it was all the store had). It was awesome. I've made it twice and guests have raved. Mix hot sausage with cheese so it melts, then pitas won't burn.

While the flavor was very good, the cheese never really melted. Had to keep it on the grill much longer than called for, finally removing the pizzas when I realized the bottom of the pitas were all burning.

These were great! I didn't have watercress, so used mixed greens. I also made with homemade whole wheat pitas. I will make this again using a variety of ingredients!
