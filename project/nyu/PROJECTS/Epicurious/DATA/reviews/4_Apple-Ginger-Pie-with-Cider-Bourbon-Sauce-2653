Excellent. Make sure you reduce the cider to 3/4 cup for the sauce. I only added 2 tbs of bourbon. I think 3 makes it too boozy!

This is not your traditional pie recipe so beware. I really enjoyed this pie but the crust does not bake up flaky and light. The sour cream causes it to be heavier and more...rustic but I loved it.

I have been making this apple pie for several years now, it is undeniably the BEST apple pie we have ever tasted, bar none! I have made it with and without the bourbon cider accompaniment, it is always delicious and the hit of every dinner party. It has become a signature dessert!

I made this recipe as written. The crust was particularly unexceptional. Despite rolling it out thin, it baked up heavy and somewhat soggy. In the future I will stick with my own crust recipe. That being said, the filling and sauce were outstanding. I did use Granny Smith apples as I prefer their texture to Goldens when baked. The sauce had the consistency of caramel. I found cider from fresh pressed Galas so my sauce was a little on the tart side. I added brown sugar to sweeten it up. My friends loved the sauce and were sneaking spoonfuls of it just to have more. I loved the combination of tart apple, sweet ginger, spicy cinnamon, and bourbon. I will be making this again.

The crust on this is phenomenal. I'm not very good with crusts and I found the instructions re: rolling out between sheets of saran wrap very helpful for obtaining the right shape and easy transfer to the dish. We used "red lady" apples bc thats what we picked last weekend, they are a little more tart and crisp than yellow delicious but I liked that. It took a really long time to reduce the 5 cups cider - more like an hour and I gave up at that point even though it was still 1.5 cu. Didn't really matter though bc the flavor is delicious, esp since you don't cook off the bourbon, it gives it a very christmas-y taste. Use a premium bourbon or I can see the sauce having a harsh unpleasant taste. Overall, this pie is wonderful and fairly easy.

Delicious! The ginger and bourbon give the pie a hint of spiceperfect for fall. I almost skipped the sauce but am so glad I made it too. It added a perfect buttery sweetness at the end. The crust came out perfectly crisp, not too soggy. My apples were a little dehydrated, but I used tiny apples from our yard, so maybe too small or maybe just not sliced thin enough? I will definitely use this recipe again!

Complex and fresh flavor; the ginger adds a nice sharp element and the bourbon gives it some depth. I've made this twice, and the flavors develop very nicely if the pie's allowed to rest at room temp. or in the fridge for a day. **This recipe's one BIG drawback: the crust. The sour cream made the crust heavy and doughy without offering any real benefits in texture or flavor. Tried with this dough: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/351389 and the result was ok, but next time I'm going to try Cooks Illustrated's vodka pie crust, substituting Calvados -- I hear it's superb for apple pies.

This is the first time I made apple pie and it was perfect! I did make some changes however. I didn't have bourbon so I used some apple cider instead in the filling, and I couldn't find crystallized ginger at the store so I used fresh ginger juice that I got from putting it in a garlic press. I have always shied away from double crust pies, but this was really easy. I don't have a food processor so I mixed it by hand and it rolled out easily after the hour in the fridge. I used a cookie cutter to remove a small heart at the center for steam to escape and a bigger heart cookie cutter to put 'ghost' shapes around the center like a flower. I used an egg wash instead of milk so it came out beautiful and shiny. I didn't make the sauce because of the reviews, but a homemade ice cream flavored with honey and almond extract. It complemented the pie perfectly. I will definitely use this recipe again!

OK so I cheated and used a storebought pie crust. Unrolled it, cut it in quarters and rolled each piece into a cone shape. Filled each cone with apple mixture and layed on its side (with apples spilling out) in individual plates - called it "Apple Cornucopia." Served with a little vanilla ice cream. But the sauce, THE SAUCE!!! I want an IV-drip of the stuff!! Made a few changes to the apple recipe. Used all granny smiths because I love a tart apple pie. Didn't have all the spices listed in the ingredients so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. Turned out juuuust right! I've already made it twice!

You have to do this pie with the sauce. The sauce was really a surprise in flavor. I still use ice water when I make my crust and refrigerate for a couple of hours before I roll it out.

My husband loves ginger, and it added a nice flavor to the pie. I agree with the reviewer about par-baking the bottom crust; it did come out a bit soggy but still tasted pretty good.

This was awesome! I made it for Thanksgiving & will add it to my list. Because of the mixed reviews, I only mad 1/2 the sauce. I thought it was great, but didn't see the poiont of making more

Crust flavor, when prepared as recommended, is very good. I would recommend par-baking the bottom crust though. When prepared according to the recipe it came out rather soggy. Overall a very tasty pie especially when served hot with vanilla ice cream and the cider-bourbon sauce.

LOVE this recipe. It has become a tradition - I make it every year.

This pie is a winner. I cannot understand why the sauce elicited so much disdain. I figured the sauce was in the recipe for a reason and did not shy from making it. It was delicious and it indeed has other good uses - on ice cream alone, on other types of holiday pies and cakes. That said I agree the pie would be fine all by itself. I also used three kinds of apples. For those with trouble making pie crust I recently learned a trick. Roll the dough in a cylinder shape about 3" in diameter and after it has chilled slice off discs about 1/4" thick and then just press them together in the pie plate. Do the top crust on your sideboard the same way and then transfer to the pie. It sure beats using a roller.

I liked the combination of flavors in this pie, though if I made it again, I would definitely make some changes. First of all, bag the sauce altogether. I made the sauce, but after tasting it, decided not to put my guests through that unpleasant experience. Also, I would use half golden delicous apples, the kind the recipe calls for, and for the other half, granny smith or another variety with a more respectable texture. it would have been better had some of the apples been firmer. otherwise good.

This will be the 3rd Thanksgiving in a row we have made this pie. Other reviewers are correct, you really don't need the sauce. Tres yummy.

I made this recipe for the first time three years ago and now I get in trouble if I don't bring it to the Thanksgiving table every year! The ginger and bourbon add the perfect twist and the crust is superb. The trick to the crust is not to turn it too much. You want it to be a bit crumbly. I have tried the sauce but the pie really takes the cake! HA! If you don't have time for the sauce I wouldn't worry about it too much.

Pie was very good, I have a dutch style that I like better, but for a delicious change, I'll do this. The sauce was good, but...it separated as it cooled so there was co-algulated butter at the top, not terribly appetizing. But I do think the sauce added to the total taste. I made the vanilla bean ice cream from this site. Basically there were no complaints from any of my guests! Oh yeah, I took the advice of another reviewer and mulling spices to the apple juice while reducing, can't imagine it with out them.

This was the first pie I ever made and it was absolutely great! It looks gorgeous when it comes out of the oven. I left out the sauce because it seemed like too much trouble. Can't wait to make it again. Made some minor substitutions -- used a mixture of Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, and Fuji apples; used half rum and half Jack Daniels instead of bourbon; didn't know what apple pie spice was so used (per teaspoon) 1/2 tsp cinnamon; 1/4 tsp allspice; 1/8 tsp nutmeg; 1/8 tsp clove, all ground.

This was good but the crust was to moist and hard to work with. The interior was no different than other pie recipes so will probably just stick with one that has a better crust. Didn't make the sauce since other reviews said it wasn't needed.

This pie was delicious. We made the sauce but added some mulling spices while the cider was reducing (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, etc). The spices made a huge difference. Removed the spices before adding the butter and rest. It was great! Eveyone raved about it.

I LOVE this recipe. Thick, tangy restaurant-quality crust... It's always gotten rave reviews. Excellent for holidays.

I'm giving this 4-forks for the pie (didn't try the sauce, per other reviewer's comments). It's definitely a keeper, and now will replace my standard apple pie recipe. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving dinner this year. Great recipe!

This apple pie is a winner! Personally I can take or leave apple pie, but being a good sister and dutiful wife and mother I made it for the men in my family. Seconds were had by all, and I ended up having to make another pie the next weekend just for my husband. The candied ginger adds a spicy/sweet bite that pushes the pie into the extraordinary realm. The crust is hearty (but not heavy) -- perfect for a deep-dish pie -- and it make a beautiful presentation.

Family raved it was the best dessert I've made. Crust was very tasty and hearty, but not necessarily very "flaky". I will use Brandy next time, just because I personally like it better than whiskies. Oh, and for the record, we all thought the sauce was excellent served warm over vanilla ice cream (I juiced 6 pounds of apples for the juice)!

Wonderfully spiced pie! The filling set beautifully after resting out of the oven for 15 min (don't cut before then:) )

I didn't even bother making the sauce after reading the previous reviews, but the pie didn't need anything, it's amazing! The crust is especially good--the sour cream flavor comes out really well and compliments the filling wonderfully.

This was my first apple pie, and it turned out great. I foolishly ignored the advice about the sauce and made it any way. I even doctored it up a bit, but it still was not some thing i would put on the pie. The pie itself is wonderful, one of the best i have tasted.

This apple pie is UNBELIEVABLE. I had it up in Vancouver, B.C., but I couldn't find the recipe for apple pie with bourbon in it. Don't waste your time on the sauce though. The sauce is awful. However, the pie is so darn good I rated this recipe 4 forks. The pie makes up for the poor sauce. I can honestly say I have never had an apple pie that is so good. I've made this 5 times now. I took it to work before the holidays and it was gone in 15 minutes. Made it for my family and they scarfed it in about 15 minutes.

I felt the pie turned out fine but the sauce was disappointing. It was way too thin and inappropriate to the dish.
