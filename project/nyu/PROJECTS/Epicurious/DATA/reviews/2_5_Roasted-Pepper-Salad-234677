Although this is called a roasted red pepper salad, the sweet and sour quality of this recipe should be reflected in the title. But here's my concerns with this recipe: 1. The ratio of sugar to vinegar (1 teaspoon sugar to 3 tablespoons balsamic? Has anyone actually tested this using real measuring spoons?). In the realm of sweet & sour there needs to be more of a balance or you may as well just call it dessert (this coming from a Sicilian who has a lot of experience with sweet & sour). 2. The required addition of half a teaspoon of salt needed to cut the overly sweet dressing proves this. (remember, this is all going in just 3 TBS of liquid). And a good balsamic vinegar has a pleasant sweetness to begin with. 3. I also thought that there was not enough dressing by far to do more than get lost among TWO POUNDS of peppers (the linked recipe for roasting will work well though). Two pounds in 3 tablespoons of liquid???? You could marinate them for a week and not have enough flavor. Thank goodness for the basil & capers or else this would truly be a waste of expensive peppers. An alternative to this recipe would be to add one large red onion sliced to give off a bit of heat and a crunch that would contrast perfectly with the soft texture of the salad, add some good extra-virgin olive oil (I like 1/4 cup because we're bread dippers in my family), more vinegar by at least double (no sugar needed if aged balsamic - maybe a pinch if using a bland quality of red-wine vinegar) and only a pinch of salt. A few good grinds of black pepper too. Serve along side a meat that can stand up to such bold flavors like lamb, aged beef or game.
