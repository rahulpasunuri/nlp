Well received! Doubled recipe - added sweet vermouth (accidentally O.D'd on the balsamic - but was just fine)& salad made with plums, red grapefruit, cherries, peaches, instead of strawberries, and pineapple - served with bourboned whipped cream instead of ice cream - topped with a splash of bitters and slivered almonds and freshly ground cinnamon - like an "old fashioned" parfait - awesome!

Excellent summer desert. I didn't bother with the ginger this time. Served it in mason jars. Roaring success!

So good and easy - everyone was blown away. Served over Haagen-Dazs French Vanilla - this recipe can't go wrong. The ginger is a perfect touch.

Made this last night and thought this dessert was wonderful! Used 4 T. of ginger and found flavor perfect...but, I love ginger! Served on top of fat free vanilla yogurt. Perfect summer dessert and pretty colors with mint sprig on top!

Wonderful!!! I was a little apprehensive about the 4 tbsp. of ginger so I cut it to two. I think 3 would be just right...but like the recipe says....to taste. I would puree the raspberries and then strain them the next time but that's just because I spend about 2 hours picking the seeds out of my bridgework. Great blend of flavors and textures. Yummy!!!

I didn't have raspbarries, so I used a strawberry sugar mash to start. It turned out wonderful, but I bet it will be even better when I make it with raspberries. We tried but couldn't taste the balsamic vinager, but I bet it is doing some magic.
