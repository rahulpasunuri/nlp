At first I thought it might be to heavy or sweet, but it was absolutely perfect. You can really taste each layer of flavor. My apricots could've been a little more ripe, but it was still amazing.

This was just spectacular. I served it alongside a spoonful of plain Greek yogurt, sprinkled with the crushed, toasted pine nuts. Really unique dessert!

I couldn't get fresh apricots so I used peaches instead. This was certainly lovely and easy to make.

I actually only made the butter, sugar, and amaretto syrup and poached the apricots in that...took me 15 minutes, and it was exceptional!

Very easy and the guests ate every scrap. The sauce was good especially since my apricots were not particularly sweet. Next time I may add something creamy to the plate like a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream or a drizzle of creme fraiche.

Outstanding. Everybody loved it, and if they hadn't, it was so good I could have eaten at least half of it myself in short order!

Good fairly quick dessert. I couldn't find amaretti, so substituted almond biscotti.

Very good, very sweet. I substituted kosher macaroons because I served the dish at Passover. Apricots packed in juice instead of syrup make an acceptable substitute when fresh ones aren't available. Use the sauce sparingly as overdoing it would make the dish cloyingly sweet. The flavors are very intense and wonderful. I will likely try using this technique with other liquors such as Grand Marinier or Kahlua to make sauces for other deserts.
