Love these cookies. They definitely have a strong flavor. They're soft, not like hard ginger snaps and work especially well when made small.

Thin and super crisp, I added more dried ginger powder, and a teaspon of fresh grated ginger. Maybe the best cookie I've ever eaten.

Very nice cookie. I made half of the recipe and it worked out just fine. Good flavor.

This has become a new family favorite. The texture and ginger flavor is perfect. We have already made several times and will make again. We have cooked this recipe on a stone with great success.

Just had a comment about a previous reviewer...the call for double acting baking powder is because that it also releases gases when exposed to heat not just when introduced to wet ingredients so it allows the cookie to rise in the oven as well as the bowl. I'm all for making a recipe your own and experimenting but not changing the true structure of what the cookie was supposed to be. These are great cookies! : ) Just follow the recipe, potential cooks...i think Gourmet knows what they are doing!!

Try adding a little flour to the ginger when chopping. It helps control the stickiness. I agree with the review recommending only 3/4 cup brown sugar.

Wow. Serious sweet tooth satisfaction. These weren't quite as gingery as I'd hoped they'd be, even after doubling the ground ginger. I think they need a kick of fresh ginger. At any rate, they were nice and crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle and very yummy!

I adore these! They are the perfect combination of crispy and chewy, sweet and spicy. I've made these again and again for everyone I know this month. I love to make them small so they are just 2-3 bites each. Trader Joe's has affordable candied ginger - you can also purchase it bulk at many markets. These are my holiday staple!

the first time I made these I accidentally used baking soda instead of baking powder, they were eaten so quickly that I had to make another batch. When making the second batch, I noticed my error and used the baking powder, they were still really good, but I think I'll use baking soda from now on. They had a better consistancy.

The cookies tasted REALLY great, but they didn't look like traditional cookies at all. Ours spread out VERY thin and quickly got brown on the edges while staying very pale in the center. Maybe all you cooks out there now know instantly what my friend and I did wrong, but hey - we're learning. Go ahead and try them if you're on the fence.

I reduced the sugar and boosted the ginger (fresh, ground, crystalized) as suggested by others. I was still not very impressed. Also, they were not 'crisp' which it to me the essence of a good ginger cookie.

Replaced crystallised ginger with fresh ginger juice and recipe was great! Will also reduce the sugar to hopefully get more out of the ginger. Cookies were tasty and crisp, especially if each cookie is less than 1teaspoon before they go in the oven.

A wonderful vehicle for crystalized ginger. Fabulous flavor the second or third day. I have found that all cookies and cakes that call for ginger need to sit around for a day to develop their flavors.

This is certainly one of my favorite cookies, I make them any time there's crystalized ginger in the house.

Delicious! I used less 1/4 cup of brown sugar because the ginger has lots os sugar. It was great!

Wow! Very tasty cookies, these are. The butter and brown sugar are a fabulous vehicle for the ginger. I will definitely make them again.

I added 2 Tbls freshly grated ginger. The cookies were too sweet. They do spread, and when large are very breakable.

I think it is the best ginger cookie I have ever tasted and one of the best overall cookies I have ever made.

I found these cookies rather bland although they were devoured by my co-workers on whom I pawned off almost the entire batch. I was hoping for a stronger ginger flavor but the spices were overpowered by the butter and brown sugar and I only infrequently encountered a blast of ginger taste. The texture was excellent, though: soft and chewy. For unbeatable ginger cookies, I'd highly recommend either the Ginger Spice Cookies or Bubbee's Gingies, both found on this site.

I got rave reviews on these cookies and they disappeared very fast! I added a whole egg instead of just the yolk to make the cookies more substantial and it worked fine. I also thought the candied ginger didn't add a lot of flavor to the batter, so I added some fresh ginger for a bit more of a bite and it really helped these along. Also found that I needed to add a touch of water to the batter to make it workable.

Delicious cookies. Very thin and fragile.

Perfect ginger cookies! They are thin and crisp and completely delicious.

One of the best cookies I've ever made. Be sure and space them out a lot on the baking sheet -- they spread out big and flat -- and wait a few minutes before removing them to a cooling rack.

This is my husband's favorite cookie! It's easy and delicious. Every time I serve it, people beg for the recipe. If you like candied ginger you'll love these cookies.

Very crisp and flavourful, and a bit buttery. All my guests who tried them raved!
