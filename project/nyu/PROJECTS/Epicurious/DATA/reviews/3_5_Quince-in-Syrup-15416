This is a great recipe that evokes very fond memories of my childhood. It's worth noting that Joyce Goldstein's original recipe does not call for rosemary (not sure where that came from), but it certainly works and complements the recipe perfectly.

I would like to revise my review above. Really, I just had a very mistaken expectation about what this recipe was aiming for. I expected to be able to eat a bowl of this stuff, and it's really more of a preserve-type condiment. I have served it several times with manchego and roasted almonds and it was a BIG favorite with my guests and with my husband. Great flavor. Next winter when I see quinces I will be making it again. I'm giving it 4 forks to counterbalance my premature 2 forks above.

As a Quince novice, I was skeptical that a pre-boil-then-simmer-for-12-hours recipe sounded like something you would do to a fruit you hated. A matter of mistaken expectations? Like someone who really wanted SYRUP or preserves would love this? It ended up REALLY intense and sweet; mixing it with yogurt for breakfast was still too sweet for me or my 1-year-old. However, I love the flavors of the cinnamon, rosemary, & quince, and the house smelled great. I've had quince-dairy-product desserts in fancy restaurants, and they seemed pear-like but a little more interesting than that. This turned out redder and more flavorful. Next time I would try a different recipe, or decrease the sugar, and save the original water I boil them in. They seemed edible after the first boil; maybe just a little more cooking and skip the syrup idea would make me happy. I'm giving this to friends who run a bed & breakfast so they can think of something creative to do with it.
