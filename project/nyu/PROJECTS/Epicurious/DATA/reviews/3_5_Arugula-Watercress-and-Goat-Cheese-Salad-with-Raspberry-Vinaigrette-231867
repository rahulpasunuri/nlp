I really enjoyed the vinaigrette, however I added an extra tablespoon of vinegar to give it an extra bite. I also used white wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand. Next time I am inclined to use raspberry.

The dressing is nice - not fabulous, but decent, fast summer week-night nice. The '5-ounce bag mixed baby greens with arugula'(sic) is aggravating.

Perfect flavor~ I needed a raspberry vinaigrette to serve over field greens with mango, pistachios and goat cheese. It was divine!

I made this salad for Easter...Beautiful color presentation and delicious! Made recipe as is except used frozen raspberries for the vinaigrette, which I seeded. Also, adjusted the oil to vinegar ratio to my tastes. I will absolutely make this again.

Very good. Couldn't get raspberries so I substituted blackberries and it was great. I did use the raspberry vinegar. Served it with a vegetarian chili and it was a nice balance of sweet and spicy.

This was a great salad course at a dinner party. Guests loved the combination of flavors. Definitely would make again.

I put the rasberries in the salad whole instead of in the dressing and used white wine vinegar.Wonderful.

I was so excited to make this salad after reading the reviews and was so dissappointed with the results. I felt the dressing was much to thick for such light greens as watercress and baby argula - I tried watering down a bit - but still didnt care for it. I used only half of a large shallot and felt it overpowered.

I won't be making this again. It had good flavor, but somehow it looked liked yogurt or pink cottage cheese when I was finished. If you make it, I would definately strain the dressing with cheesecloth to remove the seeds (something I did not do). Very clumpy and flavorful.

I used a baby romaine blend for this delicious salad. I have lots of leftover dressing for more salads. I though there were a bit too many pine nuts for my taste. I will cut back next time.

This is excellent. I used mixed baby greens (that included arugula) and added a little extra frisee. Outstanding. Wonderful flavors and textures. The dressing brings it all together beautifully.

I added raspberry preserves in with the fresh raspberries to counter the tartness. The shallots make the dressing.

Wonderful! We added more arugula and watercress because we like the peppery greens. Raspberries can vary widely, which may be why some reviewers needed to strain and some found the dressing tart. I did not need to strain the dressing, but I did add a little extra honey because my berries were tart. I burned the pine nuts, so we went without and they were not missed.

I don't know if my raspberries weren't sweet or what, but I didn't just LOVE this recipe, especially with all the rave reviews. It was just too tart for me. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't fantastic.

Even though I forgot to add the goat cheese (DUH!), this salad was delicious. I took the advice of one reviewer and strained the dressing....no nasty raspberry seeds to chomp down on. The shallots are essential.

Everyone just loved this salad - raspberry seeds and all! Will make this recipe again and passing along a copy to one of our guests. This will become an 'old stand-by' that could very well turn up at Christmas.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL SALAD, I FOLLOWED THE RECEIPE EXCEPT I OMITTED THE HONEY AND RASBERRIES AND ADDED RASBERRY JAM, WITH DOING THAT I DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE SEEDS IN THE RASBERRIES.

Excellent recipe. My only addition is to strain the dressing as I dislike chomping down on raspberry seeds.

Wonderful flavor. Would make this anytime. My only adjustment is a few additional pine nuts.

I have made this dressing so many times but this time around I added some fresh basil leaves. What a wonderful combination!
