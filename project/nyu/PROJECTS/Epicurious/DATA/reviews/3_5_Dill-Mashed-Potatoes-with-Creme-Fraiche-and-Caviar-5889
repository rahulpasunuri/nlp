Used sour cream, as that's what we had. It was wonderful served with locally made bratwurst. The number of servings given has got to be a misprint; 3 1/2 pounds of potatoes serves a lot more than 2 people. We were four who really liked this, and still had leftovers.

Excellent! I make creme fraiche using 1 cup cream to which I add 2 Tablespoons buttermilk, stir, and let sit out with a light covering of plastic wrap for about 10 hours or until about twice as thick (or a little more) as regular cream. Keeps a good week in the fridge, and leftovers can be used in so many other recipes on this site. Delicious with fresh fruit.

My sister took a bite and said, "Oh....my....GOD!!" We love rich foods, and this was a nice combination. I used my sister's home made creme fraiche, which was actually not too tangy this time. But you could still taste all the fat. mmm! So good, and so good for you! ;-)

My partner, who is no sour cream fan, really liked this. I didn't use the crème fraîche, but still a nice (fattening) twist on classic Irish-style mashed potatoes, milk and butter.

Here's a creme fraiche recipe from a reviewer of another recipe. I copied it for you. Hope you like it: To make your own Creme Fraiche: Over a low flame, heat 1 cup heavy whipping cream with 1 teaspoon buttermilk in a medium saucepan until slightly warm. Transfer the mixture to a jar or something with a loose lid. Let the mixture sit undisturbed, out on the counter for 8 hours, or for as much as 12 hours. This method works perfectly, and tastes much better than store bought Creme Fraiche.

Very nicedish, especilly when you have a lot of leftover dill from a salmon or other dish. Are you listening supermarkets? Please package herbs in smaller bunches. We know it costs a little more,but better that than having a huge bunch go soggy in 3 or 4 days. Thanks, Marie
