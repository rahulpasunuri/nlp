I love quick, flavorful recipes and this one is great in a pinch! My boyfriend approves! I used thin cut strip steak which cooked faster. To prevent too much liquid, simply simmer until the liquid is absorbed. I topped each taco with shredded cheese and fresh cilantro. The tomatoes with green chiles were spicier than I anticipated so I might throw together a mango salsa to go with it the next time I make it.

Delicious! Don't be scared of the olives and raisins, they blend into the into the dish beautifully. Even someone who dislikes olives will like this. The meat mixture stands alone, but I do recommend some additional toppings to jazz it up (cilantro, lime, mango, sour cream, or whatever you have on hand)

Very easy interesting weeknight meal. I was a little scared to add raisins but the flavor was well balanced.

This is going into heavy rotation in our house! I always add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and if I don't have a bell pepper, I sauteed some garlic and onions, which really added to the flavor. I skipped the raisins and I always make a side of fresh guacamole using 2 avocados, 1 plum tomato, chopped garlic and lemon juice. Make a radio station with Los Tigres Del Norte, and you are transported to Mexico! Buen provecho!!!!!

VERY tasty! We followed the recipe almost to a T, aside from adding a little cayenne pepper and some fresh lime juice. We will absolutely be making this dish again!

Easy and so delicious! I followed the recipe precisely (but doubled it and added just a touch of smoked chipotle powder) and I thought the flavors were perfect. Don't be afraid of the raisins, they melt into the concoction and I think are an essential component flavor-wise - if you didn't know they were there, you wouldn't know they were there, if that makes sense. For a cheap cut of beef, the skirt steak is really tender. Definitely one to make repeatedly!

this was really great I used some left over smoked steak I had and that just placed it over the top if your going to make this I recommend smoked steak with home made Verde salsa

Flavorful, healthy, light meal. Would make again to eat as a meal at home, but it's a bit messy to serve to guests because of all of the liquid inside.

I made this recipe as is, except I used multi-grain, low-carb tortillas. These were delicious, cheap, quick, and easy. The flavor is unique and they are so juicy. I topped these with feta cheese, which works well with these tacos.

Like everyone says. This is a good weeknight quick dinner. I couldn't find the tomatoes with green chilies. I used canned chopped tomatoes and a small can of diced green chilies. I used golden raisins which I prefer. Next time I might use fresh mangos & tomatoes.

This was so tasty! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I put in 3/4 tsp of cumin because it's not my favorite. Really good with the feta on top. Served with a side of spanish rice. Will definitely make again.

Definitely a good flavor combination. I'm not calling all my friends about it, but I might do it again.

This is a great recipe for a family dinner. We made it with the feta cheese and raisins and we used sirloin steak instead of a skirt cut. Next time we will use a little less cumin. Definitively a repeater!

This recipe is fantastic! I left out the raisins (don't appeal to me) and allspice and substituted some mild chili powder and smoked paprika along with the cumin. Also, I garnished with goat cheese - as it appears in the photo. I didn't rate "exceptional" as it's not a particularly grand dish, but for a healthy weeknight dinner - amazing!
