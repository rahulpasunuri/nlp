This was terrible. I used flounder. The peanut crust was a bit thick and came out a little chewy. The problem was the banana, though. Just awful texture, the taste was cooked right out of it. Fish needs more seasoning.

What a waste of fresh flounder. My kids said the best part about it was the banana. Presents horribly. You can't enjoy the delicate flounder flavor. Very disappointing.

I liked the overall recipe, but I substituted pollack for the flounder and thought that particular fish was a bit fishy for this recipe. I bet it would be great with mahi-mahi! I agree with the other reviewers who suggested upping the cumin and lime, I increased both quite a bit and still thought it needed more.

I managed to cook this wonderful dish while my 3 young boys were hanging around the kitchen, hungry. I sliced the banana into 1/2" thick rounds, used cashews instead of peanuts, and forgot to add the cumin until right before putting it in the oven (and totally forgot to season with salt & pepper). But still, it was great, a very forgiving recipe. I agree with the other reviewers that said the taste combinations worked very well together, and the larger pieces of nuts made for a nice contrasting texture, even though it made it harder to stay on the fish. I just tossed all the extra nuts on the pan with the fish and put them in the serving dish so people could have as much or as little nuts as they wanted. Next time, I'll remember to keep lime wedges on hand while serving, but even without it it's a definite repeat.

This recipe tasted great! It was a little bland so I recommend adding more cumin. Also it would be better served with pasta than rice. I'm not sure why. I loved the bananas with the fish. I used very unripe bananas and they held together very easily.

This is a fantastic way to prepare fish. I used grouper filets and macadamia / peanut mix. Try this if you are having problems with your crusting: Use panko or bread crumbs along with your nut mixture, it will hold to the fish better. Also make sure the nuts are chopped fine. I also used bananas and they turned out great.

The presentation is yuk! My bananas stayed together, but the peanut crust didn't. The recipee is very bland. To much trouble for what you get. No one liked this recipee. It's not worth the trouble. There are better tasting recipes out there.

Tasted like a delicious 3.5 forks! Looked like a big 1-fork mess, though. Ever the scientist, I tried one unripe banana and one ripe plantain (my first time cooking with plantain). Surprisingly, the green banana was still too soft to be cut neatly, broke into pieces, looked greyish upon cooking, and resulted in an unappealing visual presentation. The plantain kept its shape, was much easier to manage, and cooked up into a beautiful golden color. But tastewise, I preferred the sweet banana over the starchy plantain. I have a weakness for sweet-savory foods! Speaking of taste, I really loved the peanut-cumin-banana combination. Didn't notice the lime juice at all, so maybe it should be increased. I didn't measure the cumin, but simply sprinkled on what I thought would be appropriate; the amount ended up being perfect, and I'm sure I used more than 1/2t. Also, my flounder fillets were very thin, so it took 9 pieces to equal 14 oz. I folded each fillet in half to achieve an appropriate thickness and to fit everything in a single skillet. There still was more than enough egg to cover 9 fillets. The final reason the dish looked messy was that the chopped peanuts glopped up and kept falling off the fillets. I wouldn't make this dish as is again because of the visuals and because of all the difficulty I had in making it... but it sure tasted good!

This dish is sooooo good. I make it about once a month now. Here's a tip for folks who think the bananas taste weird-- try frying a couple of ripe plantains instead if you want something starchier. My family loves it either way!

Hubby made it...I ate it! Could do without the banana as they didn't add anything to the meal. Otherwise, Fish - Cumin - Lemon - who woulda thunk? Awesome!

My husband and I really liked the fish, especially with the nuts, I used cashews because that is what I had. Although we did not like the banana on top. I will probably make it again without the banana.

Delicious and very easy and quick. Next time will double the quantities. Even my toddler and baby gobbled it up!

This was a surprise success - I was worried my husband would object to the bananas, but the tastes melded perfectly!

My husband I loved it and we devoured this dish!! I used honey roasted cashews because that's all I had in the house and it turned out great! Fish and fried bananas turned out to be surprisingly an awesome combo!!

I cheated and used salted nuts because that is what I had on hand. I thought it worked just fine. Next time I will add a little more lime juice. I think it really made the dish. Overall I think its a nice dish to add to my regular fish rotation.

This dish definetly needs more cumin. It was good and I would make this again, perhaps adding chicken broth while it bakes in the oven. The preparation was easy and amazingly the ingredients blended well together.

I agree with the previous review, needs more cumin. I thought this recipe was so-so. I was surprised that the ingredients blended so well. I too, thought bananas and fish....... however the two blended nicely. I just think mine was lacking something. I will try it again.

This dish is delicious, and suprisingly, quite easy to prepare. The contrasts of tastes--spiciness of the cumin, sweetness of the banana,and tartness of the lime, and textures-- crunchy peanuts with soft fish and banana are a treat for the taste buds. We enjoyed this with couscous and a salad, and a fruity dry rose.

This unique recipe was delicious. I served it with couscous cooked in apricot nectar and and added some chopped dried apricots. Just before serving I stirred in some slivered almonds. Wonderful!

This was very simple to make! I did not have any cumin so I used a spicy paprika instead. My dinner guests loved the flounder, and kept commenting on how wonderful it was with the bananas. The leftovers even reheated just as good! One of my guests did not eat fish so I used chicken breast for his meal. All and all it was a hit!

Love this dish! I have made it with cashews, too, when out of peanuts and it came out fine. I serve it with a salad of FRESH pineapple and mango and ginger-coconut rice. Bananas become somewhat flavorless.

A very good dish and really easy to prepare. A couple of changes I'd make.....use more cumin (perhaps 1 teaspoon instead of 1/2)- the contrast of flavors would be even more satisfying, I'd use plantains rather than banannas - they would stand up better to sauting, and I'd try Macademias. But in general, a superub dish.

This is a *wonderful* recipe. Not complicated and fairly quick once the preps are done. It always gets rave reviews when I prepare it at my Florida house where I can get fresh flounder. Friends ask me to fix this when I invite them over for dinner!

Not only does it rock.... it rolls! I had red snapper fillets with the skin, and I used unsalted cashews. The flavors- cumin, the nuts, the bananas, just delicious!

Fantastic flavor! The crunch of the nuts combined with the soft texture of the bananas worked beautiful! Simple to put together. I used talipia as did another reader. Very firm white fish.

This was one of the most wonderful dishes I have every made. It sounds a little weird but the result is terrific. I used tilapia instead of orange roughy and it was great. I can't wait to make it again.

I was so surprised how delicious this was! I had some fresh pacific snapper and decided to try this recipe. It was a big success. I served it with sweet potatoes puree and sherry which we thought complimented it well. I highly recommend this>

Yum! Easy and delicious. I'm making it again tonight with cashews and serving it with coconut ginger rice.

This recipe ROCKS!! I've made it so many times, and changed the type of nut a few times so no one realizes it's the same recipe! Try macadamia nuts, cashews, and pistachios! You'll love it.
