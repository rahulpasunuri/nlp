I thought these were great, but I do agree with the last reviewer that they were too salty. I think that next time, I'll omit the salt on top of the bread, omit the salt from the arugula and maybe leave out the prosciutto. I still think it will be delicious because how can you go wrong with these ingredients?

I think the sandwiches were too salty and the wonderful texture and taste of the mozzarella cheese was lost among the layers of leaves. I tried it on a tomato focaccia as well; My husband (NOT a gourmet food type, so we are talking primitive taste buds I am trying to please here) said that it tasted best on the tomato focaccia.

This sandwich was so good that I was told to quit my day job and open up a place that sells this sandwich. Try it!

Great sandwiches. "Are there any left?" was the question asked repeatedly after lunch. This was a great companion for wine tasting through Temecula, CA. The Lemon Pasta Salad with Tomatoes and Feta was also a hit.

Terrific sandwich that can be made in advance. Served it to my tennis team after a match; they loved it and wanted the recipe. I substituted tapenade for the olive paste and use bagged lettuce that had arugula in it.

very yummy. used spinach instead of arugula and store made garlic focaccia. the bread got slightly soggy, so next time I will use less oil with the spinach and be sure the tomato is well seeded.

Delicious and so portable, leaved them wrapped, grab your sunscreen and head for the beach.
