I have been making this recipe every year, since the first time I saw it in Gourmet Magazine. Everyone loves it, and requests it every year. Thanksgiving is when I serve it, although you could enjoy it anytime (with the grape leaves, it's very festive). I have not been able to find the Sheep's Milk Ricotta. Funny in that I have over 30 sheep. However, I don't milk them. They are strictly for market and to keep the grass down. The cow's ricotta works just fine. Be sure to strain the cheese in cheese cloth first as recommended, otherwise the moister from the cheese will run. It's a wonderful, and delightful looking dish for your guests.

As unusual as this recipe sounds, it is wonderful and absolutely gorgeous on a buffet table. The contrast of flavors and textures - salty-sweet, creamy-chewy - is terrific and it is very easy to make. I have never been able to use sheeps milk ricotta although I live in the foodie SF Bay Area, because sheeps milk is always out of season when I've made it, but it's great with fresh cows milk ricotta. I serve it with baguette slices brushed with excellent olive oil and toasted crisp. Give it a try, especially if you like Italian flavors.
