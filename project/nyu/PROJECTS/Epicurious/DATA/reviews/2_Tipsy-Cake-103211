I don't know if it's because I had to substitute skim milk for the whole milk in the cake recipie, but the cake turned out with a cornbread consistency and was not very sweet.

The creme for this cake is excellent, similar to "choux a la creme" (creme puffs) stuffing. The cake is also very good overall.

The ingredients for the cake batter are there, it clearly says "For cake layers", it's just not in bold.

Does anyone have the Tipsy Cake recipe from Jack Daniel's or Jim Beam??? Their recipe is more like a rich fruitcake and loaded with bourbon.

The cake batter ingredients are included; the heading is simply not bolded like the custard heading.

Reason: The ingredients for the cake batter are left out. I see only frosting ingredients.

I really enjoyed the cake immensely. The custard frosting can be difficult to work with though... mine was a little runny. It stores OK but since the frosting ran a little over the edges... parts of my fridge became tasty too.
