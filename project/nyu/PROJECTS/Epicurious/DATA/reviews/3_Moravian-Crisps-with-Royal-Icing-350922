If the icing directions were better, I would give it 4 forks... Follow the recipe on the powdered egg whites (beat water and powdered egg whites to peak, then add sugar, vanilla and lemon juice, then add more sifted powdered sugar-1/2 to 3/4 c, depending on how thick you like your frosting). The cookies are delicious. Goodbye gingerbread. And they look so festive once the icing dries (plan a 3 day process: one day to chill, on day to bake and cool, one day to frost and set). I am making my the recipe again now for a party because the little cookie shapes and bright frosting are so very festive!

These cookies were a hit and nicely spiced (not too molasses-y). I thought that 1/16'' thick cookies would be too thin to move from my silpat pastry sheet to baking sheet, so I made them 1/8'' thick. I didn't bother with a covered rolling pin- the silpat and judicious use of flour was enough to prevent sticking. The dough rolled out well. I used my own royal icing recipe for decorating.

Tasty, spicy, crispy cookies -- pretty much as advertised! I used a floured flour sack towel as my base for rolling out the dough (as suggested by the recipe) and I'm very glad I did -- the dough hardly stuck at all. Instead of buying a special sleeve for my rolling pin, I covered it in waxed paper and that worked just fine (dough didn't stick to it either).
