Made this tonight with sweet potato (seasoned with salt and pepper) instead of squash and it was great. I had vermouth in the pantry which was a good substitute for white wine. We enjoyed this dinner.

My fault! Made the recipe as stated without reading the reviews first. So add my name to the BLAND wagon - I agree!

Bland!! I followed other reviewers'suggestions and made the following adjustments: doubled the garlic, used wine and stock in place of water, added a little lemon zest and seasoned very aggressively. The dish still just didn't come together well, and it was bland throughout. Not a winner.

I roasted the squash and doubled the garlic to increase flavor, and still found this rather bland. I'm a vegetarian, too, so it's not the lack of meat I'm responding to. I think the culprit is the spinach, which doesn't really meld well with the rest of the dish, and adds little flavor plus an unwelcome texture. I would make again with my changes but leave out the spinach; sautee it as a side dish instead.

I was skeptical to try this recipe, based on the reviews but am glad that did! I doubled the garlic, added an onion and SEASONED with salt and pepper. Everyone at my work potluck thought it was a very seasonally appropriate dish. Hope you enjoy as well! I will definitley make it again!

To "a cook from San Fransisco": If you haven't tried a recipe, don't rate it! If you assume a recipe is bland just because it doesn't call for salt and pepper, you obviously have no idea how to use spices! I almost never add salt or black pepper to my cooking and no one has ever described anything I've prepared as bland. Get thee to Penzeys.com!

I haven't made this, but clearly it's bland because nowhere on the ingredients list does it say salt or pepper! I'm sure with a few minor changes, this could work, like using stock instead of water to cook the squash in. I may still try this despite the poor ratings...

AWFUL WASTE OF FARMER MARKET PRODUCE. Sounded great but these ingredients do not blend at all. BLAND BLAND BLAND. I think the recipe is wrong and out of proportion. one-eight tsp nutmeg for one pound of pasta is not enough; should be more like one-eight per serving! this needs pepper and more garlic. a waste of time after peeling all squash. will never maek again and am shocked if a restaurant serves this dish - stay home instead!

I love the concept but the ingredients do not blend flavors together and not only that, this recipe was BLAND BLAND BLAND, a waste of a squash after all that peeling and slicing. If this is a restaurant receipe then I'd rather stay home and order pizza! I think the recipe is wrong if it calls for 1/8 tsp nutmeg - it needs more like 1/8 tsp PER SERVING. 1/8 tsp nutmeg for one pound of pasta is inadequate. Also needs more garlic and black pepper but I won't ever make this again. a total waste of farmer market produce!

I love this recipe. Peeling and seeding the squash was the only downfall. I did add a little extra rosemary and I used red wine instead of white. I will definetely make this again. My boyfried took it to work the next day and raved about the leftovers.

I made 1/3 of recipe (2 servings) but followed all ingredients to a T and used Parmigiano-Reggiano for the cheese. It was too bland for our tastes. Probaly more garlic, rosemary, and suace ingredients, maybe a dash of cayenne. But I won't bother to try.

I love butternut squash any way it is made, and this was wonderful. I made the recipe exactly as written. It was rich and very satisfying. Instead of adding more cream, I just added a little bit more of the pasta cooking liquid to loosen it somewhat...and it was perfect! Give it a try you will not be dissappointed.

I used regular white mushrooms because this was a last-minute dish for a potluck dinner. Don't do it! It wasn't bad and I did get some compliments, but I needed to add a lot more cheese, wine, and spices to make it less bland. Thyme was an especially good addition. Also, I used fat-free half and half in place of cream. I'll make this again with the mushrooms from the recipe, keeping the thyme.

This is an awesome pasta recipe. Substituted a 5oz. can of Evaporated Milk for the cream, increased the garlic and rosemary, as suggested, and added the entire amount of pasta water at the end for a creamy delicious sauce. The use of Parmigiano-Reggiano makes all the difference.

This pasta recipe is delicious! I make it with mushrooms and toasted pine nuts, for a change.

Excellent dish, but it needed additional rosemary and whipping cream for my taste. I served it with the Pork w/ Gorgonzola cream on the same page...Excellent!!

This sounded like it would be an interesting and yummy change from the ordinary pasta recipes. It was so BLAND. I tried it again with more garlic and rosemary, but it was still not worth the effort.

Loved the idea! But the finished dish was not worth the effort.

Wonderful, very satisfying vegetarian dish! I'll be making this again. Only drawback is that it is time consuming...all that peeling, degilling and chopping. I didn't find it too dry at all. You need to use the reserved pasta water as indicated in the recipe to keep it moist. I wouldn't add more cream because that would make it too rich.

The squash and spinach compliment each other very well, I liked this dish, but agree that it was a little on the dry side. I would add more garlic as well.

This sounded good but.... it wasn't. I thought it was bland, dry and uninteresting. I made a full recipe of sauce and halved the other ingredients.

Easy to make, and quite tasty! My husband hates mushrooms, but liked this recipe. A good one to keep on file when you have vegetarians over for dinner.

Wonderful flavor, the only drawback was it needed a little more sauce. I'll adjust the wine and whip cream the next time around.
