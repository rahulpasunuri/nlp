I love this soup! Made it numerous times as a simple start to a company meal and it never fails, and it warms up even better.

This is an easy recipe and a good option when you are pressed for time. Since I usually have frozen peas, and a few onions in my kitchen at any given time, I know I will rely on this recipe from now on. I give it three forks for ease and because its low on fat and a healthy meal option. This is a yummy soup, but I think I could find a pea soup recipe that I would like better?

I used 3/4 Teaspoon of Coriander because I thought I was out of cardamom. then added it(cardamom) later as well

I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this. The flavor was OK, but the texture was so odd that we didn't enjoy it. I won't make again.

A huge hit at the table tonight, much like but lighter than a favorite French soup that's laced with cream near the end. Here, I used 30 oz of peas and 4 cups homemade chicken broth from the freezer and substituted ginger juice (a new find, worth seeking out ...) for the fresh. Yummy! For a special starter some night, cook as specified here, then push through a very fine strainer (I use a metal cone- shaped device my mother used for tomato sauce years ago) to remove the skins. Add cream or whole milk and bring back to a near-boil. Serve in small portions with a dollop of creme fraiche. The smooth creamy essence of spring will leave the table speechless for a moment ...

Good, and easy, but the ginger wants to overwhelm the cardamom. I'll use more cardamom next time.

A quick and easy soup. I will add more ginger next time. Wow, the colour is great! This would be a great soup for St. Patrick's day, because of the colour. It's also great with diced leftover ham, and diced, crunchy snow peas, as per the other reviewer.

This is a nice, simple recipe, of lovely colour. I used vegetable stock and added much more cardamom.

This is so simple. A really nice soup. Would work well with an elegant dinner or a casual supper. I used green onions (scallions) instead of regular onions. The cardamom is a nice accent.

This soup is easy to prepare and makes a good weeknight dinner. The ginger and cardamom give a traditional soup a nice kick.

Very easy and very flavorful! It makes a great first course for sophisticated palates, maybe a drop of creme fraiche or plain yogurt to dress it up

Very fast and tasty. Substituted chives (had no onion) and vegetarian broth, and used whole cardamom seeds. I poured it very hot over raw snow peas for a little crunch and freshness.
