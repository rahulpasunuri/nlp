I used Jasmin Rice and it came out pretty well, but it might take a little more than 5 min before the rice browns, but I loved this recipe.

This recipe sounds fine, in principle, but the term "Mexican Rice" bugged me a bit- I was raised in Mexico around very traditional cooking (particularly the regional cuisines of Mexico City and Yucatan- both extremely traditionalist). In both cases, and in every instance, "Mexican Rice" is different from any other rice because it gets fried in vegetable oil (just a quarter sized drop) before the water gets poured in. This keeps it from sticking together and gives it a wonderful texture. Fry the rice with half an onion and a couple of garlic cloves (all whole, not chopped), and leave them to boil with the rice, thereby infusing it with their flavors. A little chicken bullion adds the necessary salt and flavor. If you have them, add a whole serrano chile (thin, small green chiles that look a lot like a thinner version of a jalapeno) to the onion and garlic clove mix. My mom and grandmother both added a vegetable for color and flavor, like some yellow corn kernels, potato cut into small chunks, chopped carrot, etc. (not all at once- each time they made the rice, a different vegetable was used). Boil 30 minutes or until water evaporates. THAT is Mexican rice.

This is a perfect, typical recipe for Mexican rice. I am amazed at the low ratings for this recipe. Make sure you saute the uncooked rice, and then add the broth.

This recipe should stick to its function of soaking up sauce. It was good, but I do not think it can stand up on its own. Too much trouble to make for not enough flavor. I'd make plain rice (easy) the next time and use my time and counter space on something else.
