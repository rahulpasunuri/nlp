If you think this if too bland - I didn't. Add some red pepper flakes. Use beef broth not water - and only enough to cover. After the marinade scrap off - and save - the marinate & then brown quickly. Then return the marinade.

Delicious, even a hit among the "I never eat red meat" crowd. I made a few modifications: Substituted sriracha for gochujang, added some rice wine vinegar and increased the brown sugar (thought the marinade needed more sugar and acid). I threw in some shiitake mushrooms towards the end of cooking. Reheated it the next day to serve, and I threw in some baby bok choy just before serving. Next-day serving was great, because I could skim the cold fat off the top. And the meat probably got even more tender overnight.

I quit the receipe after marination and just popped the whole thing in the slow cooker. Marinade and all. I cooked it on low for 10 hours. It was delicious and simple.

This was a very flavourful recipe. We loved it

I'm surprised others found this recipe bland. I thought it was loaded with flavor, as did all of the dinner guests I've served it to thus far. I did deviate from the recipe as printed by adding 1 tbs. of Sambal Oelek. That added just the right amount of heat to complement the richness of the ribs.

Loved this recipe. Did not use traditional Korean ribs. Used country style pork ribs. The marinade was excellent and served with the Asian Pickes, this is a winner.

This recipe lacked alot of flavor. The recipe calls for 3 Cups of water. To Much. Try 1 cup of water and let marinate for at least 24 hours. I also add a can of coke or pepsi to the marinade and lessen the brown sugar. The soda gives it a nice kick and also gives it the same sweetness as the brown sugar.

This recipe may be too bland because it calls for too much water. I usually make it with 1:1 equal parts of soy sauce and water. I'll either put 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup water or 1 cup soy sauce & 1 cup water depending on the quantity of the meat. Also, it's pertinent to soak the meak in the marinade for at least 24 hours otherwise, the flavor will not be as intense.

I agree with cook from NY. Very blah. I was expecting something spicy and different. I even added more hot pepper paste. Still no flavour.

Followed the recipe, exactly as written. Despite all of the flavors in the marinade/ sauce, the short ribs were blah. They had very little taste. Do not bother with this recipe, there are many better short ribs recipes on Epicurious.

This was the most excellent short rib recipe I've had! I used boneless ribs as I couldn't find the others, but this was FANTASTIC! I served this with a light peanut noodle dish w/scallion. I am having guests over soon for this dish! AMAZING!
