Mmm this was delicious I didn't have parsnips so I just used potatos and the butternut squash. No fresh sage, so we used dried whole white sage, and it was delicious! Savory, and wonderful, perfect for a winter or fall breakfast or side dish. I'll deffinitally make this again.

Excellent side dish to lamb or pork. Great way to get your veggies...yum.

A decent, and probably healthier, alternative to straight up potatoes as a side dish, but didn't enjoy this enough to try it again.

I only have positive things to say. I used dried sage instead of fresh. Despite what Dr. Atkins might have said, two of us ate the entire amount (along with simple pork chops cooked in the pan with salt and pepper, and frozen peas).

I loved this recipe. It was easy to prepare and is made for those who enjoy autumn type dishes. Can't wait to make it again.

If you love root vegetables as I do, you will love this dish. A welcome change from the everyday hash and a chance to get in more veggies. It even converted some skeptics!
