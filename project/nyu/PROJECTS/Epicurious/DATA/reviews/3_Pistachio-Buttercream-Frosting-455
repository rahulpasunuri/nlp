This frosting had a kind of lumpy plastic texture when it was finished. I have a top-notch food processor, but I couldn't seem to get the pistachio cream smooth at all. Then when I mixed it with the butter, it just became a gooey, unspreadable mush. I ended up salvaging it by adding more butter and some powdered sugar, which turned it into a more traditional butter cream icing. My advice is to avoid this recipe all together and just make a butter cream frosting with pistachio extract.

By the way I used raw pistachios.

OMG. I could eat this before mixing with the butter--after stirring over medium heat till it bubbles thickly, blending and cooling--as a killer pistachio custard.

Lovely subtly sweet buttercream recipe. It may not be sweet enough for those who like their buttercream sugary-sweet. In that case, I'd add 1 full cup of sugar instead of half a cup. I like chunky pistachio buttercream, so I didn't chop it up too much in the food processor.

I thought that this was pretty good, and I will consider making it again. I wasn't crazy about the texture, but some people liked it. If leaving it in the food processor for a LONG time doesn't work next time, I might try straining the pastry cream to get the chunks of pistachio out. I also agree that it's a good idea to add some greeen food coloring.

The first bad recipe I've made from epicurious. The texture is nothing at all like icing - more of a sticky goo. And the flavor of pistachios somehow gets lost. Made it the same day as chocolate buttercream from epicurious, and was thankful to have the former to save my cupcakes.

This frosting is just wonderful. Not difficult, just a lot of "waiting" time. Note to beginners ( like me ) --beating the butter "till fluffy" means till it nearly triples in volume ;)

I am so glad I tried this and didn't pay attention to the less-than-stellar reviews. It was phenomenal, even though it definitely required planning ahead.

I don't know who it is that responded with 'Yuck' but this frosting was really, really good. The only down side (why it didn't get four forks) is that it requires a lot of time to make. I added a little green coloring to give it the pistachio look and feel.
