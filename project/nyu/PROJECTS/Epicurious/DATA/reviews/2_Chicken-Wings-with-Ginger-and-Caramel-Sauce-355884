Like most native Hong Kong people I see myself as a chicken wing fanatic. Jean-Georges is awesome, and the basic principles of this recipe is great, with the caramel, nam pla, shallots and garlic all browned together. However, it also has some fatal flaws. The amount of nam pla rendered the chicken WAY too salty at the end. The final baking for 45 minutes is too long and completely unnecessary. I only baked mine for 30 minutes and all came out dried out, like salty chicken wings jerky. Also, a word of caution is that since much of the cooking happens after the caramel is done, it is extremely easy to burn the sugar. Watch out! I will totally try it again, but will drastically reduce the nam pla, say to a couple of tablespoons. I might also steam the wings to 80% done first, before adding to the caramel, to prevent the sugars from burning too much from over cooking. I will just let the wings braise/fry in the wok until it is done, to retain the plump juicyness of what I consider the best part of the chicken.

These were complicated to make and they turned out just ok. I followed the baking instructions and they came out charred, not in a good way. Surprinsingly, they were eatable.

I used chicken thighs for a main course dinner, worked out quite well!

I loved the flavors of this recipe and almost always have the ingredients. The Carmel got too brown when I made this first time(ending almost black), probably because I made this in a large sauce pan instead of a casserole. The second time it came out beautifully and looks so impressive to guests although a bit messy. Don't skip the cilantro it makes the dish!
