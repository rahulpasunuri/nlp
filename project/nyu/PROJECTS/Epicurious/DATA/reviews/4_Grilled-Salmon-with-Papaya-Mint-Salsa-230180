This recipe is a summer staple in our house, frankly year round - I will often bite the bullet and pay out of season prices for the pepper and fruit to make this. I skip the pimiento and use ripe mango instead of papaya (I will often use red or orange pepper to make up for this for color presentation). I make up the salsa in the morning and it makes dinner quick and easy, yet elegant. A definite favorite.

Made this last night and it was scrumptious! It was so good that it made me review the recipe for the first time ever on this site. I followed the recipe except that I didn't have pimiento, and I'm eating the leftover salsa for breakfast.

This was easy albeit a bit fastidious with all the chopping but not rocket science. It tasted good but I have a feeling the leftovers will taste better tomorrow. Try it. I'll make it again. It's very pretty. I think you probably need to chop everything finely. Maybe use a food processor?

I made this exactly as directed - spectacular. I used fresh garden mint that just sprouted in my yard. I think the salsa will be excellent on chicken or other types of seafood. Great use for my garden mint.

I made the salsa earlier in the day and let it sit for several hours. Later for dinner, I broiled the salmon and then spooned the salsa on it. How simple is that! I am a vegetarian, so I only sampled the salsa and enjoyed its flavor very much. My wife (the carnivore) LOVED it and gave it the 4 forks, I love the ease of the recipe and the smiles it created. We will be seeing it on the table again very soon!

This was one of the very best salmon recipes I have tried. I broiled the salmon so it was nice & crispy outside; the salsa was perfect.
