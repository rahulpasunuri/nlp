This is THE BEST breakfast recipe I have ever found!!! I served it as a brunch meal for a group of friends and they loved it, and all asked for the recipe.

My husband and I make a variation of this in the morning and it's a wonderful, quick breakfast. We use Tyson's sausage patties because they are good and they are the right shape. We have substituted Costco's croissants for toasted bread and butter. (We've tried other croissants, but the ones at Costco are the only ones we've found that are the right shape.) While the egg is cooking, we heat up the sausage in the microwave and split the croissant. When the egg's done, the egg, cheese and sausage get put on the croissant and we've got breakfast in the time it takes to prepare the eggs. Not as elegant as making everything from scratch, but it's good and makes it so that we get a good, quick breakfast while we're racing to get out the door in the morning.

I just was not impressed, even though I like Egg McMuffins. I used good healthy homemade maple turkey sausages, and they overpowered everything else. I guess fatty pork sausages would be better.

Why would anyone need a recipe to make this? As bad as the "salted boiling water" recipe.

Great recipe. We like this as a dinner meal on a weekday.I also cook my eggs a little more as my husband does not like soft eggs. We have this often, especially when we don't need a heavy meal at night.

Exteremly tasty and very easy to make. I used Jones' sausage patties and an egg roll instead of country bread. Not the healthiest choice, but who cares when you are starving! I might try it on a croissant next.

This is heavenly!! I made four sandwiches for good "comfort-food" lovers - and we absolutely demolished them and licked our fingers!! The only thing I added was a touch of honey mustard. Now our kids and grandchildren are enjoying them with one grandson's testimonial: "It's sure better than McDonald's". Now isn't that HIGH praise?

wonderful Sunday breakfast food. Keep the hot coffee coming. Food does not have to be pretentious to be great. I am sure one can substitute brioche for the bread, fois gras for the sausage, poach the eggs, and drown the thing in hollandaise or maltese sauce made w/ imported blood oranges. Give me a break.

While the insecure and pretentious of the cooking world criticizes that which they label unsophisticated, the rest of us are enjoying both the complicated and uncomplicated recipes this wonderful website provides! Mmmm comfort food.

When I first saw this recipe on the new listings, I thought omigod-shades of the fried egge recipe-Epicurious is trying to stir something up and I laughed. But, I made the absolutely delicious breakfast sandwich before reviewing, BECAUSE YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED THE RECIPE, before reviewing. Otherwise, this site looses its integrity and I am tired of clicking onto the comments site to read catty remarks. Yeah, I had made many variations of this, but this was really better than I had ever made before. This site is for novices who would like to expand and for experienced cooks looking for new ideas, so I think those considering themselves experienced should show some consideration and not put down a recipe for which a new cook might need directions.
