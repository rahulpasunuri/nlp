These fit all of my primary "wants" in a recipe; fast, easy, and delicious! I didn't have the fancy pepper, so used a shake of cayenne instead. And I used about 3/4 TB of fresh thyme, and 1/4 TB of dried. My almonds took 10 minutes to bake. The results are addictive.

These almonds are terribly oily if you don't drain them several times on a paper bag/paper towel. The other thing I noticed was pepper is included in the list of ingredients but the recipe doesn't mention the pepper so sometimes I forget to add it. It's well worth adding. I frequently make these almonds for a party or a house gift.

Oh these are awesome! and make the house smell fantastic. I like to cook these when guests are coming over so teh house smells great. I also give these as host gifts. One drawback is they are messy to eat because the oil coats your fingers.

I have made these numerous times to take to parties and people consistently rave about them and want the recipe. I have always used fresh thyme and made it exactly as written, leaving out the pimente d'espelette (haven't ever gotten any) I prefer it with the unblanched almonds with the skins on; it seems to absorb most of the excess oil, but leaves the flavor.

After give it a try, i found it so so... There was not much test of thyme. Well... I don't think I can do it for guests.

I enjoyed this recipe - good for pre-dinner drinks, makes a better statement than the usual mixed nuts assortment. You can find Espellete powder at a lot of online speciality stores, like L'Epicerie.com.

I made this for a new years eve party. Everyone loved it. I had many friends asking for the recipe. I added a bit extra salt and paprika to taste. The recipe tastes it very best when the almonds are warm out of the oven.

Tasty (not fantastic). If you are using fresh thyme, use at least 2-3X the amount. I mixed the ingredients together then baked them. Once out of the oven I topped the nuts with additional thyme (had little flavor). Thyme is mild--you need quite a bit. If you want a TDF nut recipe, try the black pepper almonds on this site.

Great make ahead for a party - these were excellent. Used too much olive oil but they were good (and popular) anyway.

This was fabulous and so simple. I suggest using less olive oil. They are addicting -- and I witnessed this first hand! A thyme plant is now a necessity in my yard.

These nuts make me a hero! I made a few substitutions that I don't think changed the nature of the original recipe. I used my own herbed sea salt with sage/thyme/rosemary, 1 T.oil from hot chiles that I preseve and 1/2 T. olive oil as well as 1/2 T.chopped fresh rosemary. Unbelievable!

I used tabasco as others have advised in place of the pepper. It was easy to make, and my boyfriend loved it. I was just so-so about it myself.

To the first reviewer: piment d'Espelette is a type of Basque pepper. You can order it from Williams-Sonoma.

My guests flip over these every time I make them. I can't tell you how many people I send this recipe to. To acheive a good taste based on the amount of almonds used, I add the thyme and salt after coating the nuts with the oil, which I use a little less than called for initially, but add more as I go along if necessary.

Well, if you know me from reading other reviews, you know that I often improvise. Sometimes finding certain ingredients can be a little difficult. So with that said--I used fine sea salt instead of the "fleur de sel". Also, I am a up on most cooking ingredients and terms, but "pimemt d"Espelette" had me stumped. If you know e-mail me. I used a few dashes of hot pepper sauce. The nuts taste great. A caution: don't use 2 tablespoons of oil. Maybe it is more like 1 1/4T. In the first batch I tried doubling the recipe and with 3T of oil I was able to make three 1/2 batches using 8 ounces of almonds. Oops, almost forgot. Add a little extra salt in the "adjust" phase of the recipe. These taste a lot like the almonds I have had at Martini bars in NYC. I'm giving these with bottles of sparkling wine as a XMAS and hostess gifts to friends. Enjoy!
