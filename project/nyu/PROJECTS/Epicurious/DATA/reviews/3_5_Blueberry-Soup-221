I loved this. I used fresh blueberries and used frozen lemon and grated half of the whole lemon into the soup, really yummy. Poured it over cantaloupe.

Haven't had any before so didn't know what to expect. It was good, though and very easy to make.

I have made this recipe many times although not being much of a blueberry fan I substitute strawberries and raspberries. I really like it in plain, non-fat yogurt, which I can't stand by itself, but with this in it is fantastic!

I make this every few weeks, it seems, usually double the recipe, and with Splenda instead of sugar. I purée the entire batch in the pot, with an immersion blender. It keeps well in the fridge and I heat up individual mugs of it for a hot drink at night.

I have made this recipe many times, each time successfully, and it is wonderful either warm or cold. The only thing I do differently is to puree the whole soup, since I like my soups either chunky or completely smooth. One thing, be sure to puree the soup in small batches, because blueberry puree will go everywhere, and it stains.

I used all 5 tablespoons of sugar and did not find this too sweet. I served it as a sauce over French vanilla ice cream, and everyone loved it. Really easy to make, too. I will definately serve this again!

I really like this recipe as a topping for ice cream. As I was making it, I realized my cinnamon sticks were less than desirable so I added two good shakes of cinnamon instead of the cinnamon stick. It turned out great. I will be trying this on pound and/or angel food cake soon.

The first time I made it, and served it as a summer appetizer, everyone enjoyed the flavor but agreed it was too sweet for an appetizer and would be better served over vanilla ice cream for dessert. I intend to make it again, using half the suggested amount of sugar. BTW, I added lowfat milk, to thicken the soup. In my opinion it improved both the texture and taste.

Blueberries are just plain good so this isn't so bad. I followed the directions exactly, but for a soup I thought this was too thick. More like a puree. I also did not care for the cinnamon. After pureeing I found bits of cinn. stick wood in it.(I DID take out the whole stick first). Better as a sauce, I would leave out the cinnamon. That's my thought.

I served this as a starter for a 5 course dinner on a hot summer day, it was excellent. Quick, easy and tasty. My family gave it a 4 forker, even my dad who hates cold soups!
