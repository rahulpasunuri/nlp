I'm going to have to try this one again. My green beans ended up not as done as I like so I wasn't crazy about it. I always give a recipe a second chance in case I was having a bad day.

I have made this several times, and it's always a hit. Very flavorful, even when I cut back on the amount of butter used. One cautionary note that I didn't see mentioned -- watch the vinegar carefully while you are reducing it. I have had occasions where it boiled down too quickly at the end and became sticky and hard to work with. The flavor profile was also impacted, and not in a good way!

Decent flavor but nothing extra special. Made for Christmas dinner and everyone liked it but it wasn't requested again.

pretty tasteless for me...I wasn't that impressed

Great dish to make ahead, especially if you have other things cooking in the oven. I used very expensive balsamic but it was not necessary since you reduce it - I would make this again.

This recipe is a standard for me now. It's easy and quick and everyone loved it at Thanksgiving - bes of all, I made it the day before :)

This has become one of my staple recipes I serve during dinner parties. I use french green beans. Also great because you can make everything ahead of time and just toss in a skillet before serving. Everyone raves about them!

Everyone loves this dish! I have made it for dinner parties and for more relaxed get togethers. Everything can be done in advance and sauted just before sitting down to dinner. Easy and wonderful.

This dish is marginal. In the end, the only flavoring is onion and vinegar. Nothing special.

This was a hit with guests. I had leftovers, however, with 12 diners. I also felt it lacked a dimension, but can't come up with what's missing. Attractive and easy side dish, nonetheless.

I reduced the ingredients because there are only two of us. I substituted leeks for shallots and used frozen whole green beans. So easy, and my husband really gave it raves. This is the best recipe for green beans I have found so far, and will use it again and again!

Fabulous recipe! I tried this with asparagus but I don't think it worked as well.

Made this for thanksgiving dinner and everyone LOVED it, I was so suprised. I only used 3/4 of the butter mixture when putting it together.

My husband and I really enjoyed these beans, however, I would reduce the amount of balsamic by about half next time as the vinegar really overpowered the shallots...

This is a side dish I make for dinner parties when I am looking for something a little fancier than plain, steamed veggies (which we normally eat during the week). I usually cook the beans and prepare the shallot butter ahead of time and assemble at the last minute. Perfect for entertaining! (Also, the shallot butter tastes just as good on baby carrots).

Extremely simple recipe. A nice alternative to lemon,garlic and butter. I made the butter the day before used haricot verts (I prefer them to regular greenbeans) and steamed them right before serving. I then quickly mixed everything together in a pan and served. It took no time at all and they were a big hit. I paired it with the rosemary polenta squares and a rum-orange chicken! Delicious!!

The shallot butter tasted yummy on my finger, but when mixed with the beans I didn't think it worked. The sharp tang of the vinegar didn't go well with the beans. This butter would probably be yummy spread on bread with fixings to make a gourmet sandwich, but not with the beans in my opinion.

This was simple and delicious. My husband who is NOT a veggie eater had a second helping. Will use this or variations of often.

My family LOVES this, so I have to make it every year for Thanksgiving. It also goes well with pork roast. Very easy and tastes so good!

This dish is delicious! Cooking down the balsamic really sweetens the flavors and the butter makes the sauce nice and rich. I make this all the time and it is always loved! Nice change to plain buttered beans.

Just made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Easy to make and convenient to be able to make it ahead and then heat the beans in the balsamic-shallot butter. I expected it to taste stronger, but it was perfect.

This Thanksgiving, I made this dish instead of green bean casserole, and I'm never going back. It smells incredibly strong while cooking, but mellows out beautifully when you combine the vinegar and shallot reduction with the butter. I used French green beans, and my family loved it.

I made this for visiting relatives, and they all loved it. My sister, who ordinarily does not care for green beans, had three helpings! I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe 4X and my family LOVES it! I use onion instead of shallots and add 2 cloves (minced) garlic. Make sure you reduce the balsamic as directed - takes me about 10 minutes. A family favorite we make at least once a week!

I have made this several times and think it is my favorite green bean recipe, especially as everything but the final saute can be done the day before. Even better if you can find haricot vert.

No onein my family liked this dish at all--and neither did I. Not sure if it was the type of balsamic vinegar I had on hand. Maybe if I used the more expensive kind that is aged longer, it would have had a different flavor

YES! I needed a quick and simple recipe for green beans to serve at my holiday buffet (other than my standard green beans with lemon, olive oil, garlic and mushrooms). This sounds like its just what I'm looking for. I'll post back results after Christmas. Thanks Epicurious.

This was specifically requested for me to bring to Thanksgiving dinner with friends. Very easy to make ahead of time, and doesn't take up room in the oven during big meals. Very tasty, and a regular on our menu!

I made this recipe with the entire meal on the cover of the magazine (Pork Tenderloin w/port cranberry sauce, rosemary polenta). It was outstanding. NOTHING leftover. I am making it this weekend for my in-laws and parents. Perfect!

My biggest mistake with this dish is that I made it alongside Chicken Breast Amadine and Wild Rice Stuffing with Hazelnuts and Dried Cranberries - two great dishes bursting with flavor - the other dishes overpowered the subtleness of the balsamic-shallot butter. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and I WILL make it again, just alongside something a little more plain so I can appreciate the flavors a bit better.

I was thrilled to discover this recipe as it is the perfect side for a wide range of meat dishes. It also has an elegance that makes it ideal for company (not to mention the fact that it can be made ahead of time and is so easy). I have shared this recipe with several friends and have added it to my "permanent" file.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. We all thought it was a refreshing change from the old butter-and-salt preparation. Delicious! I agree with other readers, though - this isn't a recipe for those who don't care for balsamic vinegar.

This was delicious and I will make it often. First time we fought over vegetables.

Rating: 3
Very easy, esp skipping the fuss of the 3rd step which adds another pan. Instead we added the butter directly to the saute pan and then just tossed it with the beans when they were cooked. Especially nice with a "plain" meat such as grilled lamb chops / Iowa chops, etc.

This dish was very nice with the Morrocan Lemon Chicken and the Rice with Almonds and Raisins - HOWEVER - make sure you use the balsamic vinegar sparingly and reduce it all the way. I used way too much and it made the dish very bitter. Will use less next time.

I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. The balsamic flavor is wonderful. I agree with one reviewer that they don't look very pretty, however.

The appearance of the dish was very unappealing. The flavor of the vinegar was rather unpleasant. I was wishing I had just gone for butter and salt and pepper.

Sooooo easy...and yummy! It helps if you really like balsalmic. Made a great addition to the Thanksgiving table.

My husband is not a green bean fan so I substituted asparagus. It was a nice accompaniment for the pork and polenta. I found that the balsamic vinegar was not overpowering at all after being reduced as instructed to in the recipe.

Rating: 3
This is very simple, and delicious! The key is to let the balsamic vinegar cook down as instructed; otherwise it will overpower the dish. The butter combines with the shallots and vinegar to create a delicious sauce that clings nicely to the beans; they were a hit at Thanksgiving! When we re-heated some of these the day after, they were almost as good as the day we made them!

Great dish - easy and quick. A must for balsamic fans. I had no shallots, so sub'd 2 cloves of garlic and Tbsp of minced onion. A subtle, yet very tasty, dish!
