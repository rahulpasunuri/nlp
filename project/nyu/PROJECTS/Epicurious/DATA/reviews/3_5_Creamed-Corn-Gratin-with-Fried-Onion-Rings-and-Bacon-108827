I've made this several times without the grits, and it was very good. I made it with the grits this past Thanksgiving, and it was even better! My son just sat next to the dish and devoured the whole thing. When he came home for Easter, he asked me to make it again. It's official...this is now our holiday dish - not only Thanksgiving! Highly recommend even if you cheat and use the canned fried onions. Rave reviews from everyone.

I have made this for about 5 years now and it is always a huge hit. Everyone always asks for more. I have to admit that I do not do the onion rings and the dish is superb. I don't "tweak" this in any way. It is really delicious and I look forward to it every Thanksgiving.

YUM! This was a great dish! My husband and I made for 4th of July and we couldn't get enough of it! I can't imagine anyone who doesn't love corn and bacon and fried onions not enjoying this recipe! I didn't have grits, so I left them out, and it turned out fine. Instead, I added extra cheese and I did as another person suggested and just chopped the onions in pieces instead of doing rings. We ended up cooking the dish on the grill because it was so hot outside and didn't want to turn on the oven. Turned out terrific! My one suggestion would be to add some dots of butter on the topping at the end so that the breadcrumbs brown. Would be a great side for Thanksgiving or Christmas as other reviewers stated.

If possible make one substitution: use fresh corn, cut from the cob, instead of frozen. The texture of the corn will maintain a firmness which is far superior to the slightly mushy alternative. Otherwise, make the recipe as instructed. The fried onions are a bit time-intensive, but I pawn it off on a family member who gets a kick out of doing it. You might want to have a copy of this recipe handy, because someone inevitably asks for it. It's that good.

Love this. Have made it several times including for Thanksgiving where it was devoured in minutes flat. It is best w/ no substitutions even though I tried pre-made onion rings as a second- best time saver. Grits and bread crumb topping add texture and interest, and the bacon -- flavor! Turkey bacon will not cut it, and 1% milk sounds gross. Sorry people, but none of your substutions improve this.

I halved this recipe and paired with barbecued baby back ribs. I liked it a lot. I didn't add green onions and didn't miss them...it's onion-y enough. Used corn meal instead of grits. Wouldn't use either next time as it compromises the creaminess. I also used the tinned french fried onions which I hadn't had since I was a kid. They were perfectly tasty and a big time and mess saver. I found the bread crumbs added nothing. Next time I'll try a light sprinkling of parmesan instead. And maybe a bit of fresh basil in the corn mixture.

This is a great recipe but leave out the grits. I made it twice once with and once without the grits -- much better and creamier without.

This was such a hit on Christmas! Boohoo...the entire casserole dish was gone! No leftovers. Followed the recipe almost exactly as written, with the exception of adding 1 cup of gruyere (as a previous post suggested). It's a lot of work, but with my hubby's help we put it together in not much time at all the night before. It's worth all the effort! Do not skimp and use canned fried onions...the red onion rings were superb. It was a huge hit with everyone from 84- year-old great-grandpa all the way down to the 10 year old...

Definitely a keeper. We made this for Thanksgiving, with a few changes, and it was my husband's favorite-ever corn recipte. We halfed the recipe, used 1% milk and heavy whipping cream (it's what we had on hand). Also used turkey bacon, doubled the cheese, and used French's fried onion. Used red pepper to taste instead of cayenne. Had a nice kick to it.

i used panko;my s.o. said it made the contrast of textures noticeable and delicious. for the contrast of textures to be noticed by someone that can only make a grilled cheese made me happy, to say the least. i also added half a red bell pepper in with the corn. i thought the cook time needed to be a little longer if you were using the frozen corn. i made this twice. the second time i DID up the cook time and it helped~+5 min. i did add about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the grits. it stood up perfectly. i also added white wine and garlic in with the onions. allowing the wine to cook off about 5 min approximately before adding the next ingredients. i thought the biggest change needed was the cheese. i added about 1 1/2 cups of cheese. 1/2 gruyere and 1/2 pepper jack. that made a phenomenal difference. i don't think the onion rings were absolutely necessary. i did it 'cause i'm a perfectionist and i thought it would look better. i will say if yours looked gross it's because you over cooked them(i did it). if you don't have anyone in your family that would be able to tell the difference between homemade and out of can (me) i'd skip making them. i felt better about the dish because i did the onion rings. :-) yes, it's a sickness.i also added some hard shredded cheese (asiago i think-i drink while i cook so it might have been romano) in with the topping. out of spite for it not having been poured out of a can---my family here in iowa hated it before it was cooked. however, calling it "scalloped corn" a regional slop here, got it in their mouths and it also got their moans. a-thank you very much.

I made this for the second Thanksgiving in a row, with a few tweaks because the recipe as written the first year got me a somewhat bland dish with overcooked, chewy corn. This year I added a can of green chiles to the sauteed onion mixture which improved the overall flavor. I omitted the step of sauteing the corn and cooking it with the cream and grits, and instead just added the frozen kernels to the slightly cooled cheese/onion/cream base. I added the the cooked bacon topping and it went into the frige to hold overnight. Baked as per the recipe. I am not a processed food kind of person, but canned french fried onions are better and much easier than the fussy onion rings the recipe calls for. I also left out the scallions and opted to use them fresh as a topping for the finished dish after it baked...another improvement, IMO.

Rating: 4
This is very good. However, it is time consuming. Best to make the topping the day before if you can. Otherwise, plan on about two hours on this dish before the baking. Anyway, everyone loved this, and I am proud to report I received some requests for recipes. And, best of all, my wife who "doesn't like onions" loved. Some of my tips: My first batch of onions weren't really all that coated, so I dunked all of the other batches in egg before the flour so that they were much more like what one would expect from a typical breaded "onion ring." I would use more of the bacon drippings when sauteing the corn. I find recipes tend to underestimate the amount of drippings you should save as a general rule. You don't want it a greasy mess, but don't be shy, especially if you're cooking a lot. I did the corn in a typical pasta-type pot - not a big stockpot. I found that it cooked up much better with a lid. I was cooking for 18 so I increased this recipe 50%, thus sauteing the corn in a skillet wouldn't work. As for quantity, the recipe as written, in my opinion, would serve 15 or so as a side dish. If it is a typical Thanksgiving dinner with many sides, this recipe quantity is all you need. I have about half leftover, but one reviewer a ways down mentioned using the leftover corn as a base for chowder. So, I'll try that. Time-consuming, but worth it.

Rating: 3
Ok, I really gotta say this was alot of work... not that it wasn't good, but it took a REAL long time to make. Everyone liked it very much but I learned a few things along the way. Next time i will make the following changes: Definitely make the topping the night before. You can keep the ingredients wrapped separately and combine them when you're ready to put it on and there's nothing here that will suffer from making it ahead of time. The onion rings don't need to be rings. You can quarter them and shake them in a zip-lock with the flour, and they will probably cook up better and flip and stuff. It will also help them blend in with the rest of the topping better. Forget the "large pot" to saute' the corn in the bacon drippings, this process needs to be done in a large saute' pan if you have one or a real big skillet. It will cook up the corn better and bring more flavor to the whole dish. The stainless worked just fine, it doesn't need the nonstick. I can't imagine what the people did wrong who hated this recipe. I did EXACTLY what it said to do and it was pretty good. I'd like to try mixing the bacon into the corn sometime but it would change it alot I'm sure. Also good to know- it makes alot! There were 8 adults at the table for Tgiving and everyone had some, and there was still half left. You could cut it back for a big holiday like this 'cause there's so much other food. I bet this would be great at a barbeque in the summer. (even tho it's a little heavy. it would be a good change from baked beans)

Excellent corn dish. Not like traditional 'creamed' corn out of the can. I added diced red, yellow, and orange bell pepper with the diced onions to give it a little color. Also I used ancho chilie powder instead of the cayenne pepper, and fresh corn off the cob instead of frozen. Next time I will try some Mexican con queso cheese instead of the Monterey Jack. The variations are endless. This is a 'go to' receipe!

Turned out brilliantly. Of course I had to monkey with it some. Rather than cayenne I used half a scotch bonnet diced very finely. My onion rings turned out a little mushy but still tasty. Just what we needed ANOTHER must have for Thanksgiving .

the roasted pork I was making took WAY too long to cook, as a result this creamed corn dish dried out somewhat. I also added too much cayenne on accident. However, it was delicious. I used panko crumbs instead of making my own breadcrumbs.. next time I will make my own or won't bother, I felt the panko didn't add anything to the crumb topping. I also used the French's fried onions because I love them and jumped at the opportunity to use it more than twice a year for green bean casserole. :) All in all, I can't wait to make this again.

This is the recipe for those of us who do not like corn pudding! This will be a Thanksgiving keeper. Great with the Christmas roast also. Commit to the homemade onion rings --easy and worth it! Go easy on the bacon, keep it subtle. I could do without, but it is the flavor some really notice. The grits not only provide the thickener, but enhance the corn flavor. This is the corn recipe I have searched for!

This was quite good, but I have to say that since I generally try to eat and cook healthy, I was a bit freaked out by the heavy ingredients. Of course I didn't hold back since it was Thanksgiving and people really liked it. BUT, here is something interesting...for what it's worth. We had tons of food so I still had about 2/3 of this left. Not wanting it to go to waste, I scraped off the topping and used the rest as a base for turkey corn chowder! It had all of the perfect ingredients for a chowder base - the corn, onion, cream, etc. I added chicken stock, left-over turkey and potatoes and it is absolutely fabulous! I had included some of the bacon mixed in with the corn when I originally made the dish, so some of that carried over into the chowder which gave it a nice flavor.

Really yummy! Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The toppings really made this dish. You can taste the cayenne pepper so don't add too much! I couldn't taste the cheese so next time I would substitute it with something else. I only had 2% milk and heavy whipping cream so I used those. Turned out fine.

I was originally going to say that this turned out well but was too much effort for a side dish and that I probably wouldn't make it again without several time-saving modifications. However, that was before my husband told me that out of all the elaborate and painstaking dishes I slaved over for our Thanksgiving dinner, this was his favourite! So now I am definitely going to make it again exactly as written. Well, except for the bacon (sorry, sorry - I'm vegetarian!). Also, in answer to a previous reviewer's question, I used cornmeal instead of grits as we don't get grits here (France).

Just to weigh in on substituting canned fried onions in the topping, I have now made it both ways and will agree that it is better with the homemade BUT - the store bought aren't bad at all and the dish is still very tasty with them.

However you make it, this is a yummy side enjoyed by all. Kids love it, too.

Somewhat time-consuming recipe but received unanimous rave reviews and many requests for the recipe at a pot-luck Christmas party. A ziploc to prep the onions in flour was helpful. As previously stated, the home-made onion rings really make the dish. The amount of cayenne in the recipe was a bit underspiced for my taste. The level of richness from the cream can handle more heat. This is a huge recipe - great for a large dinner party or buffet.

Rating: 4
HOLY SCHAMOLEY! This dish is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly although minimized the amount of butter and bacon grease for sauteeing the vegetables. The homemade onion rings really make this dish. Since my oven space was very limited on T-Day (only one rack -- old house, old oven) I cooked the gratin completely the day before and then just warmed it for 20 minutes with the topping while the Turkey "sat." This will become a staple on the holiday table.

FANTASTIC. Let me repeat, FANTASTIC. I served this for Thanksgiving to 12 people who loved it. One, a longtime cook, took the recipe home. I did use 1C of french fried onion rings instead of making them myself. And I used 1% milk instead of whole milk. I loved the spice the pepper adds to this dish. This recipe is a keeper and that's saying a lot.

So the onion rings were a slight pain in the tush to make - other than that the recipe is super simple and delicious! My family went crazy for it. It was even better as leftovers!!!

This dish was part of our Christmas menu this year, and it was the second time I've made it. The entire group of 18 raved about it, and everyone had seconds. It's creamy and crunchy at the same time; the cayenne adds just a little kick and goes so well with the corn; and the topping is wonderful. We added extra bacon that was left over from breakfast (extra bacon can never be a bad thing!). It is not a simple recipe, but it's definitely worth the effort in our opinion.

I made this for Christmas in order to try something different and it was a huge hit. The delicate balance of flavors was fantastic. I was concerned that the corn would become too "creamed" but the kernals kept crisp and the topping was amazing. Although I like spicy food, I don't think I would make this with a spicier cheese as the balance is just perfect as it is. Now a day later, the leftovers are even better than on Christmas. I think this will be a dish that will not only be a Christmas favorite but a great side year round.

Heeded others to add more grits and they were right. This will also be great for pot luck as it was prepared conveniently one day ahead.

Wow . . love the snarkiness from Cook from New York! I heartily agree with the dislike of Olive Garden, Applebee's and Red Lobster (and for all corporate "chain" restaurants). However, I feel his/her attack on creamed corn is ill-informed. Fancified "comfort foods" is all the rage in restaurants, and this dish fits that bill. With all the fear about terrorism, Iraq, and a poor economy - it's no wonder that people are drawn back to these simple, comforting foods. Eat well.

Fantastic!!! The only change was to use skim milk and a tounch of Wondra for thickening. As for the snob from New York, get over yourself!

I think it's thoroughly unfair to call this recipe "slop"; it's a good, old-fashioned creamed corn recipe in the best tradition, using real cream, onions and bacon instead of the corn starch and sugar that marks the canned variety. I left out the onion rings and used local Cheddar, but otherwise made the recipe as directed, and it was a popular addition to our holiday buffet.

Uninspired is the best I could say for this recipe. When making it I kept thinking I should use pepper jack cheese, but the first time I made it I wanted to follow the recipe.

This wasn't bad, but with so many great recipes out there waiting to be made, why make this one again?

Canned fried onions are the way to go, and I made up some more time by toasting panko crumbs.

It was well received at the Christmas table.

I, too, used more grits. Also, less bacon and olive oil instead of bacon fat. Used panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) and pepperjack cheese. Really good, and so were the leftovers.

This was a great Thanksgiving side dish, but next time I'll make some changes. I used more grits than was called for, and I think next time I'll increase it to 1/2 cup (my Southern family likes their grits!) I left out the bacon for the vegetarians, and several people said they could do without the onions, too. I also used 3 cups of whole milk instead of cream, which tasted fine. Overall, a great dish.

I made this on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. The recipe can easily be made a day ahead of time making it great for large holiday gatherings. I loved the combination of flavors and textures along with the cream and cayenne pepper. I'm planning on it for Christmas Eve dinner as well!

Very tasty. Would be great without the topping also.

I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream, and since we like things spicy used mont. jack with peppers and chili seasoning instead of cayenne, it was well-liked, and was a great leftover. I liked the bacon taste a lot, I might add more and maybe some diced jalapeno. This is a keeper for big buffets as it can be so easily made in advance.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was excellant - everyone loved it. Made it ahead a time (day before). Did not add the breadcrumbs. Will be making this again, maybe for Christimas.

We loved it and can't wait to make it next summer with fresh corn. I think it would be better with the bacon mixed in (not on top) and omit the bread crumbs. The crispy onions were plenty!

Made this dish for Thanksgiving 2003 to rave reviews. Layers of flavor are excellent. Almost none leftover to our dismay. We'll definitely make it again. Give plenty of time to prepare -- lots of steps (or prepare ahead of time as recipe indicates).

Made this for Thanksgiving to rave reviews! Made the corn & onion rings/bacon/breadcrumbs a day before, refrigerated them separatly, then put them together just as it went in the oven.

Excellent. I will make this again before next Thanksgiving for sure. Wonderful flavor and texture. I did use half-and-half instead of the heavy cream. Just divine, there is not enough left over!

If this had been the only side at Thanksgiving, I wouldn't have complained. It has so much flavor! The onion rings took longer than I had expected but I think I could be quicker next time. Great, great recipe.

Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner really liked this corn. It's comforting but has enough going on to make it interesting.

Outstanding! Look great, tasted great, and everyone wanted this recipe. I used panko instead of fresh bread crumbs, and regulare yellow onion instead of red. I made a double recipe and had no leftovers. I made this the day before, which worked well, and is another reason I will do this dish again

This was delicious. I did a "test run" before Thanksgiving and it passed with flying colors. I used half monterey jack and half pepper jack for a little extra kick.

This recipe was so rich and tasty. I would definitely make it again - in fact I am making it for thanksgiving. I used white onions instead of red and mozzarella and parmesan instead of jack, because of what I had at home. It was great!

I used beef bacon and it tasted great.

My son fixed this for my birthday, and I have now joined your web-site, and I am going to make it for Thanksgiving.
