This cake was very moist and the frosting wasn't too sweet. I made it for a party my mom was going to and people their loved it! The only problem was that the recipe calls for about twice the amount of frosting we used.

This cake was a hit. I am always skeptical when I hear that, but everyone loved it. Carrot cake lover or not, they loved it. I forgot to drain the pineapple juice and then freaked out but it basically just added 10-15 min to the cook time and it was SO moist. Happy accident. I dropped the 3rd layer, but I think it would have been too much to have 3 layers, the 2 layers made it super tall as it was. I followed other suggestions and only made 2/3 of the frosting and I still had too much. I also used creamed coconut from the ethnic section instead of the cream of coconut and doubled the amount of coconut extract. It was wonderful.

Okay, for my son's fifth birthday, I went all out last night and made this cake, in the form of a fire truck.... big undertaking, since I have never decorated a cake into "something". So first off, the cake was good, but not stellar. I used a butter cream meringue, and maybe it needs the cream cheese, but it was ALOT of work, for just good. I also served it to family, who is kind of picky, since my SIL bakes all the time, and makes really simple cakes - same cakes year after year, but it appears to work. I will likely make it again in the autumn, with rum and as much ginger as it says to use to make it sparkle a little more. The ginger is not too much, btw. I used a little less.

I have made this so many times and it never fails to receive the highest praises. I do make three changes: First, I use about 1/3 c. ginger, as not everybody likes ginger; second, I only drain 1 of the cans of pineapple and put the juice from the other can into the batter; third, I don't put the macadamia nuts through the processor, just roughly chop so that it still has the crunch. I have made this as a cake and as mini cupcakes and cannot recommend this recipe enough!!!

This cake is a total winner!! This is only the 2nd cake I've ever made and it turned out awesome. Great flavor...a nice twist on the classic that really works well. Everyone loved it.

I have been making this since 2003- it is my most requested cake. I add some coconut to the frosting and mix about 1/8 c chopped crystalized ginger into the frosting istead of using it as a garnish. It is delicious!!!

I found lot of coconut and macadamia nut flavor. It tasted more like a coconut cake than a carrot cake. Really good but not as a carrot cake.

Rating: 4
The cake is moist, flavorful, and has the unexpected touch with the crushed macadamia nuts (I only put the crystallized ginger in the topping). I went with another review's suggestion to just fine chop the nuts myself and add to batter. Be wary of adding the coconut milk to the frosting. I accidently bought coconut milk rather than cream of coconut and it changed the consistency. Had to rush to the store and buy another container of cream cheese to balance. I did end up using the coconut milk to drizzle on the still warm cakes as they came out of the oven.

This is amazing! I've made this cake 3 times as a cake and once as mini cupcakes. Each time, they received rave reviews. As recommended by other reviewers, I cut down the ginger to 1/3 c. and only drained one can of the pineapple. The last time I made this, I didn't run the macadamia nuts through the food processor, but just roughly chopped them. I like this better, as it adds a different texture and the nuts don't get lost in the cake, as I felt they did when they were ground up. Anyway, this is one of the best cakes I've made and I will certainly be keeping this in my repertoire of recipes!

Rating: 4
Very easy to make. I had a 20 oz. can of pineapple and used the entire can which worked out fine. I amke all 3 layers but freeze 2 so I always have a dessert ready for a last minute need. My friend who dislikes coconut loves this cake so have no fear of coconut haters. When using just one cake I split it into 2 layers and use 1/3 recipe of the icing for a great effect. This is a keeper!

My family asked me to review this cake because they liked it so much. I mostly followed the recipe except for the following: did 2 layers, omitted the crystallized ginger, and added more spices. I liked the America's Test Kitchen spices in their carrot cake so I added: 1/2 t ground nutmeg, 1/2 t ground black pepper, 1 t ground cardamom 1/4 t ground cloves, 1/2 t ground ginger, 1/4 t ground all spice. I would actually give the frosting a 1 fork because it was so runny. Based on previous reviews, I reduced the amount of coconut cream but it still never came together even when I refrigerated it over night. I think I'll make it with just coconut extract. We LOVE coconut. My family absolutely loved this cake.

I made this for a bridal shower for a friend who will be getting married in Hawaii. Decorated as instructed and added orchids and fresh flowers. Gorgeous! and every model-size wannabe in attendance cleaned their plate. So much for "no dessert for me!" Frosting is light - very unusual for cream cheese frosting but the frosting was one of the favorite elements of the cake. Can't be used for decorating, but wow, it is good.

Rating: 4
My husband said that this was the best carrot cake he ever tasted. I brought this to a potluck, and it disappeared in minutes! While it's true that the frosting was not stiff enough to really decorate the cake, I managed to conceal any problems with some toasted coconut on the sides and slivers of candied ginger all around the top. It was beautiful and delicious!

Rating: 3
Very tasty! I made this cake for mom who loves carrot cake. It was great with the chunks of pineapple and macadamia nuts. The cake was a bit heavy and oily. Next time, I will try making it with 1/4C less oil. I skipped the cream of coconut, macadamia nuts and ginger for the frosting and used freshly grated and toasted coconut to garnish instead, since I happened to have a whole coconut on hand. I think the cream of coconut, nuts and ginger would have added the the already heaviness and sweetness of the cake.

This cake is what urged me to purchase the magazine. It was definitely worth it. I've had major successes with cakes but carrot cakes have always given me the hardest time. This one was the one exception. It was moist and so much brighter than your typical spice cake. I'm hooked! I did change the crystallized ginger to about a 1/2 t of ground ginger. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
One of the best cakes I have ever made. It is a little bit heavy specially if you add all the juice from the pineapple but if you are someone that likes rich moist cakes then this is the way to do it. It does take a while to prepare specially me having a 6 month old baby but it is completely worth it. Exceptional and will do many times.

I just finished making these into cupcakes and damn- they are good! I made some substitutions based on what I had... 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp less of cinnamon, added 1 tsp nutmeg, added the liquid with the pineapple to keep the cake moist. I baked the cupcakes for 20 minutes and they were done right on time. For the frosting, I omitted the coconut flavoring, and the frosting was still quite tropical- a nice balance to the pineapple in the cake!

Rating: 4
This cake really is as good as everyone says! For the cake, I substituted 1 t ground ginger for all the crystallized ginger. For the frosting, I started with two 8 oz. packages of cream cheese and two sticks of butter. I added the cream of coconut and then started adding the sugar to taste (2 cups just seemed like way too much). I ended up adding about 1/4 c. plus 2 T sugar and I thought it was plenty sweet. I didn't have issues with the frosting being runny, but a little time in the fridge would probably fix that problem if you run into it. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Loved it! I made this cake for my own birthday, just as written. The coconut flavor in the icing was very subtle,and paired beautifully with the ginger in the cake. I loved the macadamia nuts , and sprinkled some over the icing, along with the crystallized ginger. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill carrot cake. A cut above, for sure.

Yum! Made for Easter, after reading multiple reviews I decided to make this in a rectangle 9 x 13 pan so I did not have to deal with the layers. I failed at my first attempt as I rushed the bake time, which made for delectable "reject" tidbits. The cryst. ginger is strong, so my second attempt I used 1/2 cup crys. ginger, also, I felt the cinnamon was a little strong so I used 2 tsp not 3 as recommended and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. The frosting-as taken from another reviewer, 2 cream cheese, 1 stick of unsalted butter and 1 1/2 c of confectioner sugar seemed to be the right recipe, but this must be chilled and cake kept chilled. Would make again, lighter less spicy recipe, loved the mac. nut change! Lastly, in a rectangle pan the bake time is more like 45 min+ using the pineapple juice.

What an amazing cake! Made it for a wine pairing dinner last night and got rave reviews! "So moist" "Sweet but not too sweet" "Best carrot cake I've ever tasted" (this from a carrot cake connoisseur.) Made it a week ago as a trial run for the wine pairing dinner and got similar rave reviews. "Tastes like a million dollars!" (from my husband) There are a lot of steps in this cake, but it's well worth it.

Everyone raved over this cake. Instead of crystallized ginger, I used slivers of fresh ginger that I sprinkled with sugar crystals, let them sit, then dried on a paper towel and minced. It was just the right hint of ginger. Based on so many reviewers saying not to drain the pineapple, I did not. However, I will next time and see which I prefer. I thought the cake was almost TOO moist and needed a "cakier" texture. Also from other reviews, I reduced the cake sugar to 1 1/2 cups, which resulted in just the right sweetness. I found Coco Lopez in the squeeze bottle and followed the icing proportions, but made just 2/3 the recipe, which was the perfect amount if you don't like super-sweet. I have to admit that this is very time-consuming, but I made it the day before and iced it right before serving. It is delicious chilled! Try it, you will love it!

This was my second time to make this. First time I didn't have any ginger and it was excellent. This time I did and ran out at about the 1/2 cup point. I was very glad as it was really powerful and almost overwhelming. Everyone raved about it and a big hit. If your not big on ginger I would cut that amount down to about 1/3 cup of ginger.

This is a carrot cake recipe that would be better in spring or warmer weather as it is lighter on the spices...not as heavy as the traditional carrot cake served in the fall.

I don't love carrot cake, and this was no exception (good, but not great) so I personally can't give this 4 forks. I also thought it was pretty time consuming (and makes LOTS of dishes) for a less than awe-inspiring result. But, I think it was a good recipe and I'd use it again if I needed to make another carrot cake. I wanted to address some issues noted by others... The cake is sweet but carrot cake is supposed to be sweet. This was much better balanced than a carrot cake I had in a restaurant not too long ago. The icing is not very firm unless you chill it. Don't chill it too much before applying to the cake or it will be too hard to ice. I'd suggest that once you follow the directions carefully to ice the cake, when you're done, put the iced cake in the fridge a few hours so the icing firms up. Also, make sure to use cream of coconut and NOT coconut milk. Cream of coconut is much thicker (I tried 4 stores before I finally found coco lopez in a Gristedes in new york city).

This turned out to be a fantastic recipe. My only substitution was a teaspoon of ground ginger for the candied ginger that was asked for. I used crushed macadamia nuts on the top of the cake and covered the sides with flaked coconut. My grandmother (cake expert of the family) requested another slice. Tip: Having a food processor with a grating blade is a must for this recipe.

I am not a cook. I get fraustrated and dismayed easily. I knew making this recipe would be an under taking. I chose this cake because my fiance really enjoys carrot cake and it was his birthday. Surprising enough this cake turned out fantastic! I personally dislike carrot cake (hence the 3 fork rating) and I found it to be tastey for what it was. My fiance's family members raved even his the ones who don't like carrot cake. I made a few changes to the recipe, I kept the juice w/the pineapple and the cake was moist because of it. Next I omitted the crystallized ginger only because I think it is crazy to spend $6.99 on two ounces of the stuff so I used 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. Since I only had two cake pans my cake was a two layer cake. For those who like carrot cake I think you will love this recipe, for those who don't like this recipe I think you will like it.

Rating: 4
I've been wanting to make this for ages and it exceeded my expectations. As a few before me, I did not use the candied ginger (too strong for my taste) and substituted a tsp of ground ginger and nutmeg. I only had to bake for 28 minutes. It is definitely necessary to chill the frosting but wow is it delicious. I would also just keep it in the fridge until ready to serve once the cake is frosted. Next time I may reduce the sugar by 1/2 a cup b/c it is very sweet and increase the carrot, but overall this was AMAZING.

Rating: 4
This cake was amazing. I will actually make more icing next time, first because the icing is great and second so I can get the nice thick icing between the layers. Usually I rush the frosting stage, but giving the cakes and icing time to cool before frosting seems to be important to keep the in-between icing from melting. This is now my go-to carrot cake recipe.

I made this in a 9x13 and it worked out great. I skipped the crystallized ginger and used 1/2 tsp. of ground, used walnuts (what I had on hand) and most of a 20 oz. can (gently drained) of crushed pineapple. The cake was PLENTY moist and continued to stay moist despite me just cramming the leftovers in the fridge w/o even wrapping them up (wine at a dinner party tends to compromise one's cleanup skills). To avoid having way too much frosting, I used 2 bricks of softened cream cheese, 1 stick of softened butter, a scant 2/3 C. of Coco Lopez, a scant 1 1/2 C. powdered sugar and the full amount for vanilla and coconut extracts. I made the cake and frosting the day before then pulled out the frosting an hour or so before I wanted to frost the cake so it'd be spreadable. I had zero problems with the frosting being too runny; to the contrary, I thought it was a perfect consistency. Even non-Carrot cake eaters RAVED about this. It really is a fabulous cake and, though more expensive to make than my regular carrot cake recipe, it's worth the extra coin. It's the best carrot cake I've ever had -- anywhere.

Rating: 3
Lots of ingredients require a fair amount of gathering and time. The cake was moist and delicious. There was a copious amount of icing, more than desired. Because the icing was so soft, it was difficult to get the cake to stack evenly -- it kept sliding to one side or the other. Guests loved it despite its lean.

Rating: 4
I have made this delicious cake for several years and I always receive compliments and requests that I make it. The only thing I have changed about the recipe is that I omit the addition of crystalized ginger, because I haven't always had that ingredient on hand. The use of macadamian nuts gives this a more delicate and light flavor than the more traditional carrot/spice cakes.

Rating: 0
Oooh...I LOVE this cake. A bit time-consuming to make (really, a couple hours), but very worth it. I ate half of it by myself. I added toasted coconut on the top and sides, after frosting, because I'm such a coconut lover. You need to make this cake! (it tastes better refrigerated a couple hours before serving)

Rating: 4
This is a great, fast and easy recipe. It seems a little involved but it is worth it. I have sub'd a 1/3 C almond meal for 1/3C flour. This makes this cake even more moist. Also don't skimp on the extracts and cream of coco. they make a big difference; from good cake to great cake. I have found that buying a can of cream of coco seems wasteful though. I found a product called coco real. It is cream of coco in a squeeze bottle. Can life get any better! Good Luck!

I made this in cupcake form and was very happy with the result. The cake has such a wonderful chunky texture. I may add extra pineapple next time, as I think this made it truly special. I used walnuts and almonds instead of macadamia nuts; still very tasty! The cream cheese frosting delicious and interesting given the coconut flavoring. This recipe puts clever twists on a classic. My cake was slightly dry, so be careful with bake time. My cupcakes actually got better and more moist with time, so consider baking a day ahead.

This was the most AMAZING carrot cake ever!! My bf bought the ingredients for me, on my bday. What better way to celebrate, than to bake a cake for myself! I got rave reviews from friends, including "the best carrot cake I've ever had" and "wow, that is killer". I made very slight changes. The grocery store didn't have coconut extract or crystallized ginger so those were omitted. I used 2 teaspoons of ground ginger instead and the flavor wasn't overpowering. In the frosting I added ALL the the cream of coconut called for even though previous comments mention problems with setting up. I'm glad I did, because it was the flavor I wanted. Make your frosting FIRST! So while you're baking it has time to set up. Any kind of imperfections in the frosting, I covered with a layer of toasted coconut. It's a delicious way to conceal and add texture to boot. Also: I added the juice of one of the cans of pineapple and it made for a moist cake. I recommend this to everyone even if you don't take the other suggestions.

Hands down the best carrot cake I've ever tried...my friend made this for my bachelorette party and now I'm going to attend the cupcake version for my son's 1st bday party.

This carrot cake was wonderful. I would suggest not to drain the pineapple juice. The first time I made it I forgot to drain and it came out so moist. The second time I followed the directions exactly and it was a little dry. A big hit even for those who don't like coconut. Yum!

Delish! I made this for a family get together. My husbands family isn't much for desserts, especially anything too rich. So I decided to do this carrot cake which was a HUGE hit. Not a single person refused it and many had seconds.

Delicious! I did some substituting: wheat flour and increased the amount of pineapple to about 25 oz. to account for lost moisture.

For the frosting, I only used powdered sugar, cream cheese, almond extract, and two table spoons of coconut milk.

This cake is great! My boyfriend claimed not to like carrot cake, but he loved this one. I only made two layers, which was perfect. I used powdered ginger, as many other reviewers, rather than crystalized. Also, I ony used 2 8 ounce packages of cream cheese and 1 stick of butter and omitted the cream of coconut. I then added enough powdered sugar to get the right consistancy - almost 3 cups.

This is so worth the additional effort!! I was looking for something a little different in a carrot cake recipe and this one was just perfect!! I made it for Easter this year and have given the recipe to others already. I did adjust it a bit...I used 1/2 cup of coconut milk instead of the Coco Lopez, and then cut out the coconut extract & upped the vanilla extract to 1 1/2 teaspoons. It really was moist, not too sweet. Aloha!

so, SO delicious. i skip the ginger completely, add nutmeg, and use probably 1 1/4 c of powdered sugar in the frosting instead of 2c (the coco lopez makes the stuff really sweet, so you don't need that much sugar). i've been making this recipe for years and it's a total fan favorite...

Great recipe! A little extra work but worth the effort. Like others who revied it the frosting was very runny so I tossed some extra cream cheese in and got it really cold so it would firm up. Wonderful texture and flavor. Not too sweet like so many. A hit with everyone here at the office.

"The bomb." I had so many positive reviews on this cake and several requests to make it again! In fact, my boyfriend was so upset that there were no leftovers! The whole cake disappeared in minutes. I followed other reviewers and reduced the amount of cream of coconut in the frosting to 1/2 cup. I thought it was perfect and with the coconut extract, gave it just the subtle hint of coconut flavor that made the frosting extra special. I also added some toasted coconut around the sides, which I thought not only looked gorgeous but added to the texture. My store didn't have crystallized ginger so I used a heaping teaspoon of ground ginger and was happy with the result. While my oven usually cooks faster than most recipes call for, I found that I had to cook the cakes quite a bit longer than the 30 minutes noted in the recipe here. It is such a moist cake though that I think it's actually impossible to overcook it unless you burn it to a crisp. This was the first cake I've ever baked from scratch and it made me look like a pro. I can't wait for an occasion to make this one again!

This cake was delicious! I left out the nuts and ginger because I tried to simply the recipe as this was the first cake I made from scratch, but it turned out great. The pineapple flavor mixed with the coconut and carrots was super rich and the cake was super moist but not too sweet. I opted to go with a similar, but different recipe for the frosting after reading the reviews that the cream of coconut and cocunut extract didn't necessarily add a lot more flavor. I used two packages of the cheese cake, 1 stick of butter, 4 cups of powdered sugar and vanilla extract. I had way too much frosting left over so I'll probably cut that down to half next time!

Rating: 4
My go to carrot cake. I change it up a bit to suit the ingredients I always have on hand. I omit the crystalized ginger, and jut put in a tsp. or so of ground ginger with the cinnamon. Use chopped pecans instead of mac nuts. I also just make a simple cream cheese frosting, no coconut flavor. The cake itself has so much texture and flavor, I like the simple frosting. Toss a bit of toasted coconut around the sides of the finished cake for a pretty presentation! Also, if you think 3 8oz. pkgs of cream cheese seems like too much frosting... it's not!! (And, I'm not a frosting freak:))

After reading all the amazing reviews, I had to try it. This recipe deserves every good review it has gotten! This is my new go-to cake when I'm pressed for an idea - relatively easy, impressive, and delicious!! The frosting is a little loose, so easy on the cream of cocnut. Cupcakes also turn out great - after frosting them, top with a macadamia nut a la "a cherry on top" for a nice presentation.

This is one of the most delicious carrot cakes that I have ever made.The only change that I would make is to eliminate the cream of coconut and add some coconut extract instead. The cream of coconut made the frosting a bit runny and I don't think it added that much coconut flavar. I definitely will be making this cake again.

When it comes to flavor this cake has it. It's delicious and the coconut/pineapple is an unexpected twist for the beneficiaries of your baking. I made this upon request, and that will be the only way I'll ever make it again. I am in shock over the amount of sugar...In the past I've substituted some for Splenda, but I don't want to slip fake ingredients for natural ones without the knowledge of the person requesting it. I also substituted the crystallized ginger (aka candied ginger) for powder ginger. Other than that and the omission of the macadamia as embellishment, the recipe was followed to the letter.

Excellent cake!!!! This is the best carrot cake I've ever tasted! Made for a group of friends and they too agree. Still giving four forks even though I had problems with the frosting. Didn't come together and hold as others have that I've made before. Had to put cake in freezer with a thin layer of frosting over cake to harden a bit before giving it the final coat. That worked. Will absolutely make over again. This is my go-to-carrot cake.

This was amazing! I made it for a tropical themed potluck last week. It received rave reviews - one gal even said the best carrot cake she'd ever had. I was a little worried about the frosting consistency after reading some reviews, so only used 1/2 c. cream of coconut and it was perfect. Frosted it right away. I didn't find coconut extract, so just used a little extra vanilla. Also garnished it with chopped toasted macadamias and toasted coconut. I little labor-intensive, but well worth it!!

Excellent! My baby shower guests really enjoyed this cake. I made it in to cupcakes instead of layers. I also switched the frosting up: instead of the cream of coconut and coconut extract, I added about a cup of guava paste (found in the hispanic food aisle at the grocery store). This made a really tangy, fruity frosting that my guests LOVED, and it went really nicely with the flavors of the cake. I piped the frosting on each cupcake and topped with a sliver of candied ginger and a macadamia nut. They looked gorgeous and tasted even better. I think next time I will take previous reviewers' advice about the nutmeg. Do yourself a favor and try the guava cream cheese frosting sometime.

Rating: 4
Just to add my two cents...I agree with previous reviewers, nutmeg rounds out the flavors. I suggest anywhere from 1/2-3/4 teaspoon would be sufficient. I also only made half of the frosting which was really just enough. I couldn't imagine making the full amount! Followed the recipe to a "T"...it was just so moist & delicious! I chopped the remaining 14 nuts and pressed it into & around the sides of the cake with shredded coconut. Didn't have the problem with the frosting that so many described, I didn't allow the butter & cream cheese to get to room temperature before beating. For those who felt that the recipe was time consuming, I would highly suggest shredding your carrots in the food processor with the grater attachment, shredded carrots in seconds!

Wow. What a phenominal cake. I served this to some carrot cake lovers who have sampled many from around the country. This was their favorite. It is creamy, moist, and delicious. Stop searching. This is THE ONE. I added some shredded cocnut to the outside of the frosting.Awesome.

Time consuming but good. I made it for a co-worker's birthday and got rave reviews. It was gone by the time the boss showed up and he scraped the crumbs off the plate and said it was delicious. Note to self - save a slice for the boss! Absolutely worth the effort.

My husband is a carrot cake lover and I made this for his birthday. He loved it. It came out nice and moist and delicious. I only had ground ginger, so I used that. I also used a bit more carrots. I also cut the recipe for the frosting in half as we don't like a lot of sweet frosting. I will make this again. It is a keeper.

I thought this cake was excellent. I too made a few adjustments on the recipe based on all the reviews. I didn't use the crystalized gingers, but I did put some grounded ginger in the cake. I add a bit more carrots and used all the juices from the pineapple can, but used only half the amount of oil. The frosting set up fine, I used only 1/4 of a cup since my family doesn't like desserts that are too sweet. I added more coconut flakes on the cake to give it a bit more texture. Overall I thought the cake was extremely moist and it probably tasted more like Coconut Pineapple cake with hints of carrots. I woud definitely make this again, next time I'll trying leaving out the carrot. I would make this again.

This was my first time making a carrot cake. It came out great! The pineapple, macadamia nuts, and coconut blend together perfectly. I ran out of vanilla and only used it in the cake. The frosting was fine without it. Also, I made the frosting with the butter at room temp. and the cream cheese chilled and it was spreadable, but it had small lumps. Not very noticeable and very deliscious! I also took up the suggestion of using less flour and the cake was perfect with 1 and 3/4 C. flour. I also omitted the ginger. I will make this cake again. Only if I have the time as it is time consuming!

I made a third of this recipe and made into mini cupcakes. Although it made 30 of them, I only ended up with 22 because they were difficult to get out of my non-stick mini tins, even with Pam. However, everyone was still telling me how much they loved them the next day! Will definately make as a cake in the future.

I made this cake one time and it's quite a bit of work. Give yourself enough time to prepare all the ingredients. Now, for the taste, it's very good, but I wouldnt put this cake in the category of carrot cake. It really didnt remind me of a carrot cake at all but more tropical since you taste much more of the coconut and ginger than anything else. It was very good though and my family loved it. It definately has a unique taste. Well worth the trouble.

Frosting very good and easy. Added dried, flaked coconut to the frosting and omitted the nuts and ginger. Not too sweet and wonderful on other cakes as well.A nice twist to traditional cream cheese frosting.

This is an excellent carrot cake recipe. Especially the cake part which I wouldn't change at all. The frosting is very good but needs longer refrigeration to firm up. Overnight is best.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, very moist, but I agree that the frosting never firmed up for me. Next time I would use much less coconut cream. Also, the cake itself has a huge amount of sugar. I wonder how much it could be reduced. The cake layers worked just fine with white wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I just reduced the amount to prevent the cake from being dry. I used 1.5 cups instead of 2. Next time, I will try 1.75 cups since it was plenty moist. No off flavor from the white wheat flour.

This is the best cake ever. It is a lot of work, but worth it. I have been making this cake for 2 years now, and I always get requests for more. The cake tastes better after a day or so, the ginger flavor comes out a bit stronger. The bummer is all other carrot cakes just don't taste this good! The frosting is wonderful. It is also fantastic with strawberries just the right amount of flavor and not too sweet like some buttercreams.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I applied some of the modifications. I also put it into mini-cupcakes. It made 66 mini-cupcakes. The modifcations I applied were: not draining the pineapple, reducing the crystallized ginger to taste, and reducing the powdered sugar in the frosting to a scant 1/3 cup. I would start there and add according to your tastes. Also, definitely follow the advice of another reviewer and make the frosting with the butter at room temp and the cream cheese chilled. You will then be able to spread it as soon as it's made, and it will spread beautifully. One last note. I couldn't find unsalted dry-roasted macadamia nuts, so I used about salted and about 1/2 the amount of salt called for. I'd do this to your own taste. Everyone loved these, and ate approximately 3 per person. Definitely a great desert. Very straightforward.

Rating: 4
Very rich and outrageously delicious! I used this for the Coconut Layer Cake (also on this site), followed the recipe exactly, chilled it for about an hour and also frosted slightly frozen cake layers. There's more than enough to frost three 8" layers and am wondering if leftover icing can be frozen? The coconut flavor really comes through and, because the frosting uses butter, be sure to store the cake in the fridge to keep it from spoiling...that is, if you have anything left! I'll definitely make this again, it was a huge hit.

This was one of best recipes I have tried on epicurious.com. It was so clear and I felt comfortable every step of the way (not being a cake baker and always uncomfortable during frosting). Cake turned out moist and delicious, frosting was out of this world!

This was the best carrot cake I've ever had. I made it for my mother's retirement party and it was a smashing success. A lot of work but well worth the effort! The frosting was especially incredible. Only change I would make is to reduce the amount of crystallized ginger in the cake - I thought it was a little much.

Wow ... what a fantastic recipe! I was making bundt cakes for a bake sale and these were a HIT! The recipe required a full-size bundt pan (as opposed to the specialty designs that are slightly smaller), and I baked it at 325 degrees for 70 minutes. I used the same frosting recipe, but used it while still not set and poured it over the cake like an icing. Also, i added about 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4-1/2 tsp clove for a slightly more traditional carrot cake taste. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
This was delish! As other reviewers stated, the cake is a tad bit HUGE. Next time I will add cloves and nutmeg to counteract the sweetness a bit. My only issue with the cake was the icing. I chilled it as directed and found it VERY difficult to spread over the cake. Also, even with all that icing, you could see the brown cake through the icing. My favorite part, was the delicious & unexpected flavor the pineapple adds to the cake. Yum.

Note to anyone who is having trouble getting the frosting firm enough: Follow the directions and chill it sufficiently before using! Also helps if you don't let the cream cheese warm to room temperature before you beat it - the butter yes, but the cream cheese you can leave cold. Another strategy I've tried is to freeze the cake a few minutes before frosting it - it helps keep the frosting firm if you're spreading it onto a very cold surface. Anyway, as long as you keep the frosting cold, the texture is PERFECT. The frosting is definitely my favorite aspect of this cake, and I've also tried it on other cake recipes. =)

I made this cake for my fiance's birthday. He loved it, the office loved it, everyone loved it. My only issue with the cake is how BIG it is. Instead of having one huge three layer cake cake, I make a 2 layer cake instead of a 3 layer, fed most of the office with that, then used the rest of the batter for cupcakes. We took the big cake to the office on his birthday, and ate cupcakes at home for the rest of the week!

I made this cake just for fun and everyone loved it. My brother said it was the best he's ever had. I used 3 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 of nutmeg and used chopped candied ginger in just the top layer. Definitly will make again.

I made this for my nephew's 22nd birthday. Since he's from Hawaii and is in California for college I wanted to surprise him with a Hawaiian inspired birthday cake to follow a Hawaiian dinner. This cake would have been spectacular on its own merit but I added my own twist to make it super spectacular. I made two layers instead of three and made a couple of small loaves to send home with him. I softened a pint of coconut ice cream and made a layer in a plastic lined cake pan and put it in the freezer along with the layer cakes to freeze. The next day I assembled the cake with the ice cream layer in the middle and frosted it with the awesome coconut cream cheese frosting and put the whole thing back in the freezer until 15 minutes before it was served. The texture of the frosting was also very ice cream like and the cake did not freeze hard because of the oil and the coconut ice cream layer just made it that much more special. I often add an ice cream layer to cakes when I want them to be extra special and memorable.

Several people told me this was the best carrot cake they'd ever had (including my mom, who is a carrot cake traditionalist) and my sister exclaimed it was "exquisite". I used Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus in place of cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. We might have had to add some extra powdered sugar to get the frosting to set up, but wow! it was really good

I have made this recipe a few times and everyone loves it. The only modification I made was instead of draining the pineapple juice I left it in for one can. It made the cake more moist. I also used only 1/4 cup of powdered in the frosting instead of 2 cups. I felt that it was too sweet.

Icing was a little tough to get thick enough, but cake was delicious and next time I'll make the icing a day or two in advance to let it "set". Sprinkled coconut on top.

Cake itself was ok...not as carrot/spice-tasting as I expected (I like the triple layer carrot cake which also uses a touch of fresh ginger on this site better) when eating the cake by itself. Tried putting pineapple in between layers as someone suggested and it overpowered the other flavors, so I wouldn't recommend this modification. It ended up tasting more like a pineapple coconut cake than a carrot cake...

This cake was incredible. I made it for my husband's Birthday and he really loved it. I followed some reviewer's advice and went easy on the ginger. Also hear ye lactose intolerants, my husband is one, so I had to subtitute the cream cheese for tofu based cream cheese imitation (you have to find the right brand) and the butter for margerine. Still an unbelievable result! Next time I think I'll make 2/3 of the frosting though, it's too much. Otherwise perfect cake and will make again and again!

I'd actually rate this 2.5 forks. It's not the best carrot cake recipe I've tried, but it's still good. I used applesauce in place of the oil and it was still very moist. I don't know if it needed more cinnamon or what, but it seemed a little bland and had a golden color to it, rather than the brown color one associates with carrot cake. I LOVE cream of coconut (coco lopez) and felt that the frosting would be sensational, but didn't taste the coconut cream in the frosting. The frosting turned out too soft and gooey. By the way, if you can't find coco lopez (or any cream of coconut) in the grocery store, look in the area where you buy margarita mix. It's commonly used in making pina coladas.

Rating: 4
This cake is fantastic - it's a regular request with friends. I've made two changes to the recipe - omit the ginger from both the cake and frosting (it doesn't seem to mesh with the rest) and cut down the amount of cream of coconut in the frosting to 1/3 cup. Otherwise, it never sets up and is very difficult to keep layers from sliding. Enjoy!

Rating: 2
I followed the directions to the letter, however, I only had about 1/3 of a cup of crystalized ginger. Thank goodness! That small amout really stood out and I didn't care for it at all. I think the the chopped macadamia nuts in this recipe were just extra work. They weren't noticeable in the cake to me. I found that with the frosting, I had to add two more cups of powdered sugar. For one reason, the sweetened cream of coconut was not available in my grocery store. Had I had that, the frosting might not have tasted so buttery. Aside from that, the frosting was "ok" but the texture of the cake was nice and it was very moist. I have made a few different carrot cake recipes. I have one recipe that I will just stick to from now on. It's perfection! If you would like a PERFECT carrot cake recipe, email me at the name below at comcast.net.

I have not yet made the cake, but after reading the reviews, I can't wait to. I am rating the frosting...which is the best frosting I have ever licked off of my beaters. Yummy! I chose this frosting recipe to top the coconut layer cake on this site and wowee, it was the BEST coconut cake experience I have had yet. The flavor is very delicate and the frosting whips up light, fluffy and delicious without the usual dense thick texture of many cream cheese frostings. Thank you for all your reviews. This is fantastic!

To anyone out there if your looking for a carrot cake recipe this is it. Look no further. There is no better! Time consuming but Rome wasn't buit in a day. This cake is worth every bit of time you give it. You will not be able to stop eating it until it is all gone. I agree with the other comment's add 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. And for the frosting it does make way to much so cut in half and you will still have lots. I also added one small nutri-whip, whipped up until stiff and then folded into the frosting. The reason I use nutri-whip is because it holds up for days. Enjoy the best carrot cake ever.

This was a hit! It smelled so good right out of the oven and so very moist. I made this for my godmother's birthday and everyone loved it. I had enough icing leftover for piping the cake and I also chopped additional ginger and sprinkled it on the cake top. Using top of the line ingredients is crucial. I did have trouble finding the cream of coconut in my local grocery store so I had to go out of my way to purchase it but it was worth it. Make sure that you chill the icing before applying it to the cake. I was asked to bake this cake again for a large social gathering at the end of the month and again at Thanksgiving. It's a lot of cake but there were no leftovers. Truly divine!

I thought this was the best carrot cake that I've ever made (I made cupcakes actually) and my party guests thought the same, with several requesting the recipe.

I liked the flavor of this cake, and adjusted it according to other readers reviews, I think it's a great cake. If you really like ginger, leave the amount requested, if not I would definitely decrease the amount of ginger by at least half (I bought mine at Whole Foods Market and it had a really strong flavor). Also, the amount of frosting this calls for is too much, I would probably make half of it, and add more (1/2 tsp) nutmeg to the cake mixture.

This was a homerun. I made this cake for my birthday, but after a huge dinner out, my family was way too full for dessert. We decided to all split one piece of this cake- As soon as we tasted it, EVERYONE asked for a piece of their own. We all thought it was beyond a doubt the best carrot cake we had ever eaten, and the best cream cheese frosting. Carrot cake has long been a favorite of mine, too, so I've had many varieties of them. I followed the recipe exactly, but made two layers with the batter instead of three and used wax paper to line the pans since I was out of parchment paper. The cake is labor intensive, but worth it!!

Excellent cake-- Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg & some golden raisins & topped with toasted coconut as suggested by others. Not a big fan of strong ginger flavors, but it adds a nice dimension to this cake. Cake is dense, but not heavy and greasy. Cut back on the sugar in the frosting-- also had lots of frosting left over. 1/2 to 2/3 of a recipe is plenty for me...

Bra-vo! Carrot Cake is my favorite, and this is my new favorite recipe. I left out the coconut extract in icing, it didn't have a very strong coconut flavor so maybe I shouldn't have. I covered the outside with toasted coconut instead of recommended garnish. Beautiful and soooo good!

This just takes regular carrot cake to a whole new level! Absolutely wonderful, moist and dense. Didn't have the crytalized ginger so just added some ground ginger to it. Here's a tip to those who had trouble with the frosting setting up enough. Just refrigerate the Coco Lopez for a few hours before adding it to the other frosting ingredients. I did, and mine was ready to frost with without refrigerating.

This is my favorite Cake. Family and friends give rave reviews about it. You MUST use Coco Lopez (very thick) in the frosting. Other cream of coconut is too runny. I found I baked the cake a few minutes longer than suggested. It's a fabulous moist cake.

I had such high hopes for this cake, but somehow something went wrong. Like some of the other reviewers, I just couldn't get the icing to set up without adding twice the amount of icing sugar called for. The cake itself was overly moist, as if it wasn't cooked enough, although I tested doneness with a toothpick. Not one of my guests made any comments on this cake (a sure sign that it wasn't terrific)but I don't want to give up just yet. I thought the taste was great, so I will use another icing recipe, use less oil and bake it in a sheet pan or make cupcakes.

This was a good cake but not the best carrot cake i've ever had. I will make this again simply because I'd like to compare candied ginger strengths.I used "DYNASTY" BRAND SUGAR GINGER and it was way too mild we wanted to taste the ginger and there was not a trace of ginger flavor

This is the second time I've made this and I followed a few suggestions here that definitely improved it--adding nutmeg, and covering the top with toasted coconut. It was prettier than the original directions that called for the macadamia nuts and ginger. It somehow looked more like Thanksgiving, which was good because pineapple-carrot cake isn't exactly a Thanksgiving tradition in most families. I think it will be in mine, though--people LOVE this cake!

I have already made this cake before using the recipe as printed. It was excellent but I wanted to add another review. Definitely add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the cake. It helps balance out the ginger and cinnamon without overpowering the other flavors. I also made an adjustment to the frosting recipe. I used only 1 stick (1/2 c) of butter and 1 c sifted powdered sugar (used the instructed amounts of all other ingredients). Using less powdered sugar did not diminish the sweetness and produced a frosting that spread and held up really well. I also made a filling from 20 ozs of crushed pineapple with juice, 2 Tbsp sugar and 2 Tbsp of cornstarch. Simmer until thickened and then cool. Once cooled, mix with about 1/2 c frosting and spread between the layers.

This recipe was pretty hard to make claiming many bowls and a lot of time, but it was one of the best cakes I have ever had. Everyone that tried it said it was amazing. I would recommend making about a third more batter then the recipe calls for to make three full layers. But there is way to much frosting as is. Also the second time that I make this I just subsituted normal walnuts for macadamia nuts and added flaked coconut to the frosting instead of the sweetened cream of coconut to use ingredients that were on hand and to cut down on cost (the price of macadamia nuts is outrageous) and the results were virtually identical (in my opinion the frosting was better).

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had. However, like another review, it was too tempting and there were some overindulgence issues. That said, I made some changes that were sucessful: only 2/3 frosting recipe was still a voluminous quantity; frosting flavored with some lemon juice to cut the thick sweetness, omitting the coconut extract which, let's face it, is a nasty thing; used walnuts instead of macadamia to be frugal (when they're "finely chopped" are macadamia really necessary?); didn't use parchment but removed the cakes from pans right after baking to avoid sticking. This didn't seem to affect anything. Really amazing cake. The triple layer is stunning.

I would never make any carrot cake except this one. It was fabulous and everyone is still talking about it. They want me to make another. Interesting comments about the ginger..I love ginger and was surprised at the intense ginger flavor, although a few other reviewers thought their ginger flavor not too intense. Perhaps it is the brand, etc, that makes the difference. I used "The Ginger People" brand which you can find in just about every gourmet and/or grocery store..premium cut..I would cut the ginger down maybe l/4 cup although all who ate the cake said to leave as is... I did take CT advice and didn't drain the pineapple completely and she is right..it is sooo moist..The different methods we use along with the different products have got to make some differences. Thanks Epicurious!

OMG!!! What a recipe! I am very picky with carrot cakes and found this to be out of this world! I modified the frosting a bit since I went to five different stores and every one of them was out of Coco Lopez.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and the cake didn't even last 20 minutes. I used the food processor attachment which came with my blender and it really saved time. I've made it twice already and people keep begging me for more. I made a few changes. I added 1 cup of golden raisins to the cake, used walnuts or peacan instead, and for the the frosting I used honey instead of powdered sugar. We thought that the honey made the frosting have more of a cream cheese flavor. I also only used half of a SMALL can of coco lopez. This one is a keeper for SURE. EXCELLENT!!!!

This is the best carrot cake we've ever had! I would suggest two minor changes. First, a 1/2 t. of nutmeg is a nice addition to the cake. Secondly, I would omit the coconut extract completely from the frosting. The Coco Lopez adds sufficient flavor the and extract takes it too far over the top. We will make this again and again!!!

Fabulous cake! I made it for my sister's baby shower, but after some of the reviews I baked a "test cake" the week before to allow for tweaking. I added some nutmeg for a more spicy flavor, as my candied ginger slices from Trader Joe's were too mild to lend much zing. The icing definitely must be chilled, for longer than the 30 min. specified, I would say. I also added an extra cup-cup and 1/2 of powdered sugar to stiffen it up. It worked like a dream and didn't significantly add to the sweetness. I also agree with past reviews that the cake was better the next day; I baked the day before the shower and 15 of 18 people asked for the recipe. That's a four-fork review in itself!

Doubled the recipe and made it in two 9x13 pans to make one big cake for a friend's birthday party of 32 people. It was a huge success. Got rave comments about it. I made it with pecans and decorated the top with toasted coconut and toasted pecans. I know I will be making it again and again. A real keeper recipe

Amazing flavor. I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg-the only change. I totally agree with those who said the cake was better the next day. I will always make this ahead of time, the flavors just really develop and the frosting is excellent also. TRY IT!

I really like this cake. It is a nice change from the usual carrot cake. The coconut and ginger are very nice in it. A word of warning about the ginger...I bought a spice-sized jar at a local large food store that cost almost $9, and figured if I bought the whole amount there that was specified in the recipe it would have cost about $50. Then, I found crystalized ginger at a natural foods store, which sold it in bulk, for about$5 a pound.

This cake is FABULOUS! I tried this yesterday, brought it into work at 8:15am and by 8:30 it was GONE. It was a Monday-Morning hit among my co-workers. I'm planning on making it for an upcoming tropical-themed party. Anyone who loves carrot cake MUST TRY THIS!

I made this yesterday in 85 degree heat and 79% humidity. And I do not have AC. The frosting took 3 hours to set up enough to spread and remained gloppy all day in the fridge. Yesterday the cake was way too sweet and one dimensional, but today it is complex and delicious. I would make this again on a cooler day and definately a day prior to eating.

Delicious and worth every minute of time and effort!

Absolutely my favorite cake recipe ever! I will be making this cake any time I need a cake to be perfect! My family members also agreed it was one of the best they had had. The prep time is a little consuming but definitely worth the effort.

Wow!Terrific cake. I made two at one time--one for my husband's bridge club and one for the family. Everyone raved about it. I will make it again. I even used pecans instead of macademia nuts in one and it worked. I used regular coconut milk and just added a little extra powdered sugar to the icing and it worked, too. I recommend this cake.

I made 3 carrot cakes (each decorated with different flowers and fruit on top) for my sister's wedding shower and I am still getting compliments 1 month later. The cakes almost got more attention than the bride-to-be. My neighborhood is having a block party and that is what I have been told to bring - they want to try it too. I changed the receipt by using walnuts and adding 1 cup of golden raisens.

I made this recipe over the weekend for a bridal shower. When adding the pineapple into the recipe, I accidentally added some of the juice before realizing that the pineapple should have been drained. It was a wonderful mistake...the cake came out incredibly moist! Everyone raved over it. I'll be making this again in the near future

Very good cake, next time I'm adding raisins though and some chopped pecans. I also use butter instead of oil in any cake it makes the taste unbelievable!!! Making this for my Luau Party this summer!

This cake was a smashing success... I don't care for ginger and macademia nuts are expensive, so while I included them in the cake, I just covered the top with little frosting stars. I was suprised at how UNfruity the cake tasted - the batter smelled really pineapple-y. It's just right spiced and sweet. Next time, I might include less butter and more cream cheese in the frosting, though - it was very buttery and not as cream cheesy as I like. The sweetening, I thought, was perfect. I highly recommend!

I thought this cake was great. It has a nice flavor that is complex and looks great. I did cut the oil in half and substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to reduce the fat a little. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for my daughter's third birthday party. YUM!!!! She loved it and the adults loved it. I agree with everything the previous reviewer wrote - moist, yet light. Also put half the ginger, then sprinkled toasted coconut on top. One of our friends also commented that this was the best carrot cake she's ever had.

I made this cake for Easter. It was a true hit with everyone. Some said it was the best carrot cake they've ever eaten. I liked it because it had alot of flavor but was still a light, moist cake. The coconut was a great compliment to the traditional carrot cake flavor. I used pecans instead of macadamia nuts because I had them already. I also used about half of the crystallized ginger called for but it was still delicious. It did take a long time to make, but if you enjoy baking it is really fun and you will love the result of your time and effort. I would definitely make this again.

YUMMY!! This was very tasty and easy to make! Very moist. A great change to the typical carrot cake. I will definitely make this one again.

Greatest carrot cake, a must keeper in all files. I did not use the "traditional cream cheese frosting" instead I used 8 oz mascarpone cheese, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup icing sugar, 2 cups heavy cream whipped to stiff peaks, vanilla 2 tsp. Gently fold whipped cream into cheese mixture. Since this was for a special celebration, I encased the whole case in Royal Fondant. You should have seen their faces, to died for.

I think this recipe should be called "Pineapple Cake with Coconut and Carrot". It was good, though. Oh yeah, hey Eugene, Oregon . . . "FANOMINAL" ? ? ? !

A good friend of mine made this cake and it was sooo good. The best carrot cake that I have ever had.

Absolutely delicious. A perfect Easter treat. Used cake as body of a Bunny Cake. The ginger and macadamia nuts make perfect additions. Will definitely make again, perhaps as muffins.

I can't imagine what went wrong with the reviewers that said this cake was not good. It was really outstanding. I followed the directions exactly, except I didn't have the cocunut extract, and it was fantastic. My guests couldn't stop raving about it. Not very difficult to prepare either. Use your food processor, and it's a snap. Be sure to chop the nuts, ginger and coconut so it's fairly fine. Can hardly wait to make this again!

I loved this cake and so did everyone else who tried it. The crystalized ginger was sooo yummy in it and the addition of coconut was fabulous. I put 3/4 cup of the coconut creme in the frosting, per the recipe, and toasted some coconut for a garnish. It was fanominal. I absolutely would make it again.

Made this cake for Easter and got rave reviews. A little time consuming but I think it was worth it. I only used half the ginger in the recipe and it came out fine. Very moist cake.

I made this cake for a ladies meeting at my house and was afraid that the ginger would not be to someone's liking. But the ten ladies ate their serving to the last crumb and raved about it. It was more time-consuming than I expected. It easily serves 12-16.

This cake was fabulous. I served it to six guests, all of whom loved it. Tastes differ, but in my opinion, the ginger was not at all overpowering. It lent a nice bite to the finished cake -- a great balance to the rich and decadent frosting. Rather than decorating this cake as suggested in the recipe, I frosted liberally and then covered the entire surface with large-sized flakes of unsweetened coconut (like a traditional coconut cake). Truly excellent. Enjoy!

I LOVED this cake!!! I don't understand the reviewers who thought the frosting was overpowering. I do agree with the baker who thought it married perfectly with the cake - it does! The ginger is not overpowering if it is cut up finely. It was the best carrot cake I've ever made and all my guests raved about it! Definitely a recipe I'll put in my "saved" category.

I turned this into cupcakes, because I prefer them to cake. I halved the recipe and it made 10 large cupcakes that baked in approximately 25 minutes. Based on earlier reviews, I cut down somewhat on the crystallized ginger. I also added unsweetened coconut cream (rather than sweetened) to the frosting,which gave it a nice hint of coconut flavour, but was certainly not overwhelming. I added about, 2 extra tablespoons of oil, because the batter seemed too thick. As a result, the cupcakes came out incredibly moist. I will defintely make these again.

I completely disagree with the previous two reviewers. Yes, the coconut-frosting *is* overpowering in the coconut flavor but ONLY if you eat it by itself; it perfectly marries with the carrot cake. I didn't find the ginger overpowering at all. If the pieces were sliced and cut up small enough (which the recipe says to do!) it only added a burst of flavor. I made this for a birthday party and there was absolutely none left. It definitely isn't your run-of-the-mill carrot cake, but was fantastic! The *only* complaint would be with the frosting. It needs a considerable amount of time to firm up to actually use. It only really became hard enough 3 hours after making. So, word of warning, make sure you make the frosting *first* before making the cake so it has time to firm in the fridge. Otherwise, a great COMPLICATED cake, but worth the time and effort, if followed correctly.

Too spicy to be a carrot cake and also too greasy.. I also didn't enjoy the coconut cream cheese frosting. The coconut taste was overwhelming. I wouldn't make it again.

I'm a carrot cake lover and I was very disappointed with this recipe. It seemed more like Ginger Cake than anything else. If you are looking for a new twist on carrot cake, I suggest you keep looking.
