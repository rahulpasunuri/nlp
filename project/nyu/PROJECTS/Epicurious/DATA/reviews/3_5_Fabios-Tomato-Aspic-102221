Very light and tasty. I have a juicer, so I juiced all the tomatoes which made it very easy. I found the amount of oil in the aspic enough so that I did not have to "drizzle" more on before serving.

I made this as part of a special Valentine's dinner for my parents. It was so good, we were all vying to see who got the leftovers!!
