Well, this recipe certainly doesn't get many points for appearance, but the taste is quite lovely. We've used it as both a dressing and a marinade for grilled pork chops. Both were quite nice.

We made a double recipe about four hours in advance of our dinner party. With this, we marinaded our chicken (enough breasts/tenderloins for seven), we dressed our salad, and we sent home a tupperware-full with two families. We received word from the families that they very much enjoyed it the next day...

this is excellent and so easy to make. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead, I doubled the entire recipe, and used less than 1/2 the olive oil.

Loved this recipe! I used it to create a pasta salad to which I added, bow tie pasta, sliced chicken breast, pepperoni, broccoli, marinated artichoke hearts and a very small amount of sun dried tomatoes. This is a great recipe to make with fresh summer basil and tomatoes.

This appeared to be the makings of a fresh vegetable marinara sauce. So, I added half a roasted red bell peppper. Also, used a little honey to mellow out the acidity.

This dressing is delicious! I took advantage of our fresh tomato and basil harvest to make this recipe. I used the suggestion of adding parmesan cheese and also threw a handful of kalamatta olives on the salad. Heaven!

Oh Ma Gawd! I have been searching for this recipe for 5 years or so now! This is an incredible vinaigrette, perfect for summer greens! I had a similiar version in a restaurant in PA five years ago and have been looking for a comparable recipe ever since (the chef refused to give me the recipe, as if he came up with it himself... hmmph!). Try it, you'll love it! Top salad off w/ a little shaved parmesan. One suggestion, add tomatoes last and pulse processor for a chunkier consistency.

When I did not have fresh tomatoes I used canned, diced tomatoes and it was still great.

My whole family -- including the kids -- loved it! Great way to use up summer's abundance of tomatoes.

perfect with mixed greens in the spring or the summer. A hit! Might benefit from a light sprinkle of sugar to cut down on acidity

This was a delicious vinaigrette that kept well for almost a week in my refrigerator. The smell alone makes it worth having around! I would add a bit less vinegar, but otherwise, loved it.
