Just tried this stuffing for Thanksgiving this year, everyone loved it! Although I like spicy food, I was careful to seed and remove the spine from all of the chilies- It was not too hot at all (in case you're worried about the heat from peppers) I used slightly less corn than called for, and also toasted the corn before I added it. I threw in a tablespoon of ground cumin; will probably double that next time. I will make this one again.

This recipe was great. I cooked it for the first 40 minutes and then popped it in the oven to warm up and brown while the meat was resting. Watch out for the anaheims. I didn't realize they were so spicy and wiped my eye. Ouch!!

I made this recipe for Christmas 2009. Outstanding!! Only thing I did differently was used boxed cornbread (2 boxes and followed directions on box) and let dry out 2 days ahead. I got a lot of great reviews and requests for the recipe.

This dressing is AWESOME! I am from the Southwest and the flavors are spot on, sweet and spicy! Flavorful, not hot. It was a last minute decision so I used canned, Hatch green chilies (in lieu of Anaheim and poblano) and used 2 boxes of Jiffy for the corn bread (2 days old). The whole family agrees that this is our new Thanksgiving staple.

A great stuffing recipe that everyone loved. We prepared this for Thanksgiving and with the variety of dishes available, a half recipe is enough for 10 people.

We have served this stuffing every year since it came out. We use James McNair's Mexican Cornbread for the cornbread portion and serve with the Cirtrus Chipoltle Turkey. We do not overly seed the peppers and use all fresh peppers. We love hot food and this has heat.

this was wonderful.. Everyone commented on it.. I wasnt sure how much corn bread.. I used two 8x8 pans and used 1 1/2 the amount.. very chunky. I also used Trader Joes roasted frozen corn.. Wow! That made a big difference I think. You could smell the charring on the corn....this gave me one 13 x9 pan.. we had 15 people and still had leftovers.. of course it was Thanksgiving so there were lots of other things too though.

Really yummy! I made this recipe a few years ago when it was my "turn" to do Thanksgiving. My family said, "this is really different, but we LOVE it!" I did cut the butter to 8TBS, but I think I will use even less this year (maybe 6TBS). I also cut the sugar down to 2 TBS. The recipe worked very well with the modifications. Also, you can adjust the spice level with the amount of jalapenos you use to suit your taste. I am making this again for Thanksgiving this year.

This was a disappointment. The flavors are nice. We added pinon which was nice also. There was too much corn & not enough WOW. It was okay but certainly not some wonderful dressing we'd serve again.

YUM. Made exactly as directed to accompany an ancho-maple glazed turkey. About 1/3 of the recipe fit into a 14 lb turkey; the rest went into a medium-sized baking dish, moistened with a splash of broth, as suggested. I was surprised that a recipe with so many chilies could be so mild--it was zippy but not hot.

This is a good stuffing, with lots of flavor. I used only the Anaheim chiles because several of my guests don't like really spicy foods. It was delicious, but a bit dry. I baked it in a baking dish. I suppose it would be less dry if baked in the bird.

I made this last Thanksgiving and got raves. Served it with Turkey w/Ancho Maple Glaze and dessert was Pumpkin Creme Brulee (in individual ramekins w/caramel sauce, vanilla whipped cream and spiced pecan for garnish) which also floored my guests.

Fabulous with the Chipolte Turkey.

Every year for the past 20 years I have served the same stuffing at Thanksgiving. This year I wanted something totally different. So I tried this one. My family flipped. They absoutely loved it. We are big corn eaters. Now I have to prepare two stuffings for them. I didn't use all of the peppers, but it didn't make a difference. The flavor is still there.

I made this along w/the Achiote-butter basted turkey...my Thanksgiving company loved it. I added some chopped chipotles, thanks to the below suggestion & more cilantro. Great side dish.

We enjoyed this a lot with roast chicken and cranberry-pear relish. I added garlic and used olive oil instead of butter, and ommitted the sugar. Adding canned chipotles to the egg mixture would definitely be a good idea if you're in the mood for spice.

It was good, but a little on the sweet side, I would make it again, but leave the sugar out and perhaps kick it up with a teaspoon of chipotle in adobo sauce. It looked great and was well received. I made it ahead up to the point where you add the eggs, I added the eggs just prior to baking the stuffing

Coming from AZ, this was the obvious choice for a Thanksgiving stuffing.I substituted a large, drained can of chopped green chiles for all of the chiles called for in the recipe. We loved this dish!! Will definitely become a yearly item at our southwest Thanksgiving table.

Very yummy and not nearly as spicy as I thought it would be. I used all the different peppers, although they were not easy to find. I cooked this stuffing in the turkey and made another stuffing in a baking dish (wild rice and goat cheese) in case this was too spicy. But it was fine for all, including kids. I guess seeding the peppers helped. Went great with the citrus chipolte turkey.

Could not decide this year between two stuffing recipes in Nov. Bon Appetit so we halfed them and made both. This was great, everyone loved it. Had a little sweet taste. Would definitely make it again
