I made this after getting hooked on liver in Italy. This brought me right back. I used anchovy paste for some saltiness. People who have never "liked" or had liver before couldn't stop eating this. For me, the fresh sage and allspice made the difference. The crunchy onions were the perfect topper. I'm making this again for mother's day.

This was such a good recipe, and I don't even like liver! I followed the recipe exactly, no additions, no substitutions, and loved it. I served this with a mixed greens salad with a vinaigrette dressing and sipped some Road 13 "The Fifth Element". What a great dinner!!!

Great recipe. We've added 2 tsp. of cognac and used a mixture of pink, white, green and black peppercorns

This is a great recipe. My only mistake was that I didn't double it!

fabulous. and i agree about the fresh sage: the flavor is unbeatable, and the individual sage leaf on top as garnish is terrific. the onions make such a difference, i will probably make extra next time. i will also try less pepper next time.

In spite of the bad rap livers get, this is wonderful. the onions and seasoning make it special.

despite the protestations of those phobic of anything "liver" this was warmly received by everyone at a cocktail reception, and one person was so bold as to ask to take home the leftovers (except there weren't any. This recipe has unwittingly saved the lives of thousands of geese.

Wonderful! Gives elegance to a usually peasant type food. We loved it. Next time I'll try the addition of cognac as the person before me suggested. Sounds like an interesting addition.

I doubled the garlic, used less oil, and deglazed the pan with cognac, and used more sage. It is a fantastic appetizer! It would be easier to eat if the onions were in smaller pieces, although that might detract a little from presentation.

Don't be put off by chicken livers! This is spicy and delicious--a hit with all our guests. Use fresh sage or forget the whole thing.
