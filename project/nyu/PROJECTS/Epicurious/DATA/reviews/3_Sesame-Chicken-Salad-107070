We enjoyed this. So easy. I had to use some panko along with the sesame seeds, as I did not have quite enough black and white, and spinach instead of mixed greens because that is what I had on hand. For the dressing, I used only 4t. and not 4T. of ginger as other reviewers gave the heads up on and I preferred peanut oil in the dressing for some good flavor.

okay, not more than 2 forks though. Pretty easy.

These mods have been discussed elsewhere I'm sure, but mine were: pedal back the ginger to about 2 tbsp., add 1 tbsp. of honey to the dressing, and pedal the sesame seeds WAAAY back to about 1/4 cup (I'm serving people, not birds). You can also lose a tbsp of oil in the dressing, or lose 1/2 a tbsp and bring up the rice vinegar to split the difference. With that, this is a really easy, really healthy, great weekday meal or brunch.

This was great although I must confess that I diverted from the original plan...instead of sesame seeds I used Panko breadcrumbs. I didn't think the kids would eat the seeds. Everyone enjoyed this meal.

Couldn't even finish mine ... the syrup was too strange for me.

I wasn't wild about the maple syrup flavour. To Florida who discovered the typo - I guess we should be grateful that Epicurious doesn't fill prescriptions!!!

TYPO IN RECIPE! I have the original recipe clipped from the magazine so I checked the ginger after reading all the reviews about the amount. The amount is incorrectly listed here. In the original recipe the amount is listed as 4 TEASPOONS not tablespoons. Big difference.

Love the chicken part of this recipe! I cook it in a grill pan and use less oil. It comes out so good--I make it all the time to meet my family's demands. I tried the dressing once and found the ginger WAY too overpowering, but I'm not a huge ginger fan to begin with...so others may enjoy it?

Was I the only one who thought this chicken was greasy? A lot of work for minimal results...

Delicious. Everyone thought so.

My family loves this recipe!! They request it often. Simple, beautiful and healthy. I made it for company and they raved. I'll be making it often over the summer with some variations that other reviewers have suggested (thank you all).

My husband really liked this, but we both agreed the chicken wasn't as crunchy as we'd been hoping. Perhaps baking instead of sauteeing would help. The dressing was great, but next time I'll puree it in my mini chopper as all the ginger made it very lumpy.

Had this for a sunday night supper. I used a honey mustard dressing instead of the one in the recipe. I made it but it was too much ginger for our taste. Started with a cheese and fruit plate. Served a pinot gris that went well with the meal. We ended with stawberry shortcake. I will be making this alot over the summer.

I don't understand why everyone loves this recipe. I made it tonight and thought it was so-so. Taking into consideration the high-fat content due to the sesame seeds and frying the chicken, I would not make it again.

A big hit, with my 9-year-old and her friend, too. I've been making the New Basics Cookbook lemon chicken salad for years...this is much easier and every bit as good. I'm switching. Fried sesame seeds (used all white)--yummy

My whole family loved this recipe -- even my 8-year-old! The second time I made it, I toasted the sesame seeds (white -- couldn't find black) first, and that seemed to help them stick better to the chicken.

This was a winner. I too sauted chicken in sesame oil. Black seasame seeds can be found at an oriental food store or a gourmet food store. They are not as flavorful as white but add to the finished look of the dish.

After reading Amy from Phoenix's review, I decided that it sounded better than the original and made it her way. It was fantastic; pretty as a picture, healthy, delicious and inexpensive. The star fruit didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but looked fantastic on the plate. Next time I may add a couple of sliced strawberries for even a bit more color. Restaurant quality dish and magnificant presentation! Thanks, Amy, you can customize my recipes anyday!

Fabulous! Replaced tomatoes with kiwi and added star fruit and red onions. Used carrot peeler to make cucumber ribbons. Use sesame oil to saute chicken. Dressing is good but easily replaced with GOOD bottled honey-mustard dressing. My husband is not a salad person, but keeps requesting this for dinner. I must have made this half a dozen times already. This is easily the best salad I've made off this site. Haven't done the black & white thing because I can't find black sesame seeds.
