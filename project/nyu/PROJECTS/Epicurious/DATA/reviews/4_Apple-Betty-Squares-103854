Took clnordberg's advice and made 1.5 shortbread (half batch with cinnamon, remaining without). Other modifications ensued: used whole wheat/kamut flour blend and kamut bread, sugar mixture included lemon zest from one full lemon, nutmeg and cloves. Subbed 2 tbsp of the cinnamon-free batch instead of flour. Total butte usage: 1 cup (practically half for the topping). Topping was a mix of the cinnamon batch of shortbread, 2 tbsp crushed toasted walnuts and, well, bread. Oh yes...and pears drizzled in lemon juice :) We had a hard pear variety (brown skin) that worked well. Very kid-friendly and this works in muffin cups if you half the time. Looks pretty when you pop them out (we have those silicon-type muffin trays). Layers! For that fact alone, I'd try this in summer with peaches and a vanilla-infused shortbread.

Delish! I changed this recipe quite a bit. I made 1.5 times the shortbread base and used 2/3 for the base and 1/3 as the topping (did not use any bread). Also, cut the drizzled butter down to 1/4 cup (since there was butter in the topping) and used 2.5 lbs yellow cooking apples. I also sliced the apples in my food processor. Great reviews, even after overnight in my fridge. A nice fall alternative to pumpkin bars.

Better the next day! I used the apples that I had on hand, which were a mix. I also took the advise of others and cut the butter to one stick for the shortbread and one for apples. I used 1 cup of all purpose and 1 cup whole wheat flour, next time I will do 1/2 C whole wheat and 1 1/2 all purpose flours. Added cinnamon to the shortbread batter and ground clove to the apples. The topping was a mix of brown sugar, all purpose flour and oats processed in the food processor and then dotted with butter before baking.Next time I'll add some chopped or slivered almonds. Not very sweet so you may want to compliment with some sweetened whipped cream or ice cream. Outstanding!

One of the best apple desserts ever. Took others' advice by adding some almond extract, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, cut the butter to 1 stick for shortbread base and one to drizzle over. Also used a combo of whole wheat bread pieces and oats. A keeper!

PS I forgot to mention in my previous post that I put a sliver of cheddar cheese atop half the squares.

These were the perfect fall treat. I used the oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg streusel that was recommended, great local fresh apples and a little less butter. I broiled the top for just a bit to crisp it up. Just excellent.

Scrumptious! I doubled the apple filling but only used 1 stick butter total (i.e., 1/2 stick doubled). I also doubled the shortbread base but substituted 1/2 cup of the doubled flour with cornstarch, for extra silkiness. I then used half of that as the actual base and the other half as the topping, instead of using any bread crumbs. Because of all the extra filling it had to bake for about an hour and 15 minutes. It came out perfectly, kind of like a rectangular apple pie with a coffee-cake-type crumb topping. The doubled filling more or less filled the whole pan but didn't spill over when cooking. I let it sit for a couple of hours before serving. Refrigerated leftovers were equally delicious cold, but a bit more difficult to get out of the pan. Yum!

These were great. I was looking for something to serve at a Thanksgiving event that people could pick up. This had some of the flavors of apple pie, but easy to handle and I was able to bake the day ahead and it was still delicious. I did add some spices and browned the butter before applying.

This was a huge hit at the office. Base did not get soggy, even after three days.

Delicious with added spice, as recommended by earlier reviewers. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. These squares aren't too sweet - perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Everyone loves this and it is so easy. We add 1/2 to 2/3 cup chopped Craisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. We also omit the bread topping and make our own struesel with oatmeal, soft butter, brwn sugar, flour and cinammon as a topping. Everyone loves!

This was an amazing dessert. I served it with vanilla ice cream. The shortbread crust is perfect. This keeps well for several days too. No need to make any changes to this!

Rating: 4
i made this for a work lunch and all the ladies went nuts! the crust just melts in your mouth...thanks to all the butter! i might try some walnuts and/or some dried cranberries/cherries to go along next time. but i will definitely keep this one in the "keep" file!!

I thought this was good. It is a LOT of butter; more than I usually like to use, but I think it's probably necessary in order to make the recipe work. Everyone I served it to liked it. I used Braeburn apples. I think this would benefit from a spice or two included.

This is a full-of-flavor treat! Very easy to make. I did however, at the suggestion of another person, use rolled oats and not bread crumbs. I baked it in a 12" round spring form pan and served in pie shaped slices with vanilla ice cream. Absolutely wonderful! Enjoy!

Delicious - with a few modifications. Use rolled oats instead of bread crumbs for topping (saves time too!). Add 1 1/2 to 2 tsp cinnamon to the flour/sugar mixture.

I AM making it again--that's why I am on the site. I LOVE this recipe. I made it with Granny Smith apples, exactly as the recipe says, with the exception of using sliced white sourdough bread (good quality) instead of sandwich bread. I brought it to a girl's weekend and it was a definate hit.

Rating: 3
This was very tasty. My reservation: it does not keep well. Everything that can't be eaten within 48 hrs. of baking should be frozen immediately. For a nice nutty flavor, replace half a cup of white flour in the crust with the same amount of whole wheat flour.

I've been thinking about making this for a long time, and all the reviews sounded so good (except for those folks using Wonder bread, which certainly isn't firm--is it even bread?). Well, I made it, and as always, followed the recipe exactly (almost--I tossed a little lemon juice with the apples so they wouldn't brown while I made the rest). I'm really not impressed. It's OK, but nothing special. The shortbread seems flavorless and dry, and the crumb topping not much better. Next time I'll just make the pie.

Not a bite went by without a compliment from my guests!!! I was told that these scrumptious squares tasted like an old family recipe paste down by a great great grandmother! I ammended the recipe by adding alot cinnamon and a small touch of lemon juice to the raw cut apples. i also cut these treats into rectangles!

Everyone LOVED these. I have made 3 different apple bar type recipes in the past couple of weeks and these were the best. I did follow the advise of a cook who suggested a little less butter drizzled (I cut out 1/4 cup) and they were still fabulous.

Rating: 3
Imade the mistake of using various apples that I had on hand so when I made it some of the apples turned to mush while others retained their shape. The Golden Delicious ones were best. However, I did make a Lemon Sauce from an old cookbook that was really great with it. It can also be used on Gingerbread. Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and mix in 2 tbsp butter, grated rind from 1 lemon, 3 tbsp lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Delicious!!

Very good! I brought it to a dinner party and everybody loved it. The crust alone is worth it. Some modifications: add another slice of bread and leave them in slightly bigger chunks, not crumbs. Add an extra teaspoon of butter. Add some almond extract and some vanilla extract to the sugar. This REALLY makes it delicious.

A touch too buttery and a touch too sweet...just fine...used 5 slices of Wonderbread equivalent for the topping, seems ok to me...Tasted it when it was a little too warm so that may account for the sweetness.

Rating: 4
These were awesome! I wanted to bring something sweet on a fishing trip, but obviously apple pie would be too cumbersome. These were perfect, they cut well, held together, very few crumbs. Everyone loved them. I would add the brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg everyone has talked about. Next time I will also cut the butter down at least 1/4-1/2 cup. (I also cut each square in half, they're sooo good, you'll feel less guilty about eating 2 halves then two whole ones!)

I was looking for a good apple recipe to bring to work and I found it. Everyone loved it! They were all gone even before lunch. I will make this again.

Very good. Used 'canned' bread crumbs with McIntosh and Granny Smiths. Sprinkled with cinnamon. Easy to serve when a pie would be too messy.

Yum Yum. I have made this receipt twice now,a real hit with my dinner guests Just wonderful. I added brown sugar, toasted walnuts,and cinnamon to the topping mixture of bread. I used Granny Smith apples, a nice tart apple with the texture of the short bread bottom makes it great.

Outageously good. I could eat these every day. And what an incedibly easy recipe to put together. Tonight I will make it for a spiffy dessert in a round pan and serve wedges of it so it will look a little less like a bar cookie and more like a tart. With creme fraiche. Ummm!

"Firm white sandwich bread"-- as in Wonder Bread, or bread from the bakery?

Rating: 4
This recipe is terrific-easy to make and a crowd pleaser. I used only 3 1/2 Granny Smith apples and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the flour/sugar mixture in the filling. Also, I decreased the melted butter from 1 1/4 cups to 1 cup. Sometimes I mix chopped nuts in with the breadcrumbs. Cut into squares, the Apple Betty freezes well. When I serve the squares I place them in cupcake papers and serve them on a big tray.

These are really yummy. I made them for the Teacher Appreciation lunch at my oldest son's school and they were very popular. They were even nicer on the second day when the base had softened a little. I'll probably try to reduce the butter somewhat next time.

Just excellent!! We all love it, will certainly make again and again. Also, I used margarine instead of butter and it turned out fine. I had my fingers crossed that it would, and it did!

We all thought this was really great! I did however cut down on the butter by a half of stick. It still was great and I was able to trick myself into thinking that it was lower in fat!!

Terrific recipe...great "fall" taste. I used cinnamon in the sugar/flour mix, added a little brouwn sugar in with the crumbs, and sprinkled all with cinnamon/vanilla sugar. Warm with french vanilla ice cream, these were a real hit.

For the cook who said her shortbread base fell apart....perhaps she used margarine (lots of water!) instead of real butter. When baking, that can make the differnce between disaster and delectable.

Rating: 4
Absolutely the best! I used sourdough bread to make the crumbs and mixed in 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon before sprinkling it on top. I also sprinkled cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg on the apples and mixed it together. Lastly, just before removing it from the oven I turned on the broiler and let the crumb topping get golden for about 2 minutes(watching constantly). Out of this world! After it cooled, it cut easily and was a great hit with my husband and guests. Thank you...

Delicious, both warm and at room temp. Like the New England cook, I changed the recipe too, including combining the flour and sugar with the apples and adding 1/4 tsp freshly ground cinnamon, mixing 1Tbsp brown sugar with the breadcrumbs,and drizzling half the amount of butter over the top. I used a combination of Granny Smith and Gala apples. And it cut into squares and kept it's shape beautifully. Scrumptious!. Will be making it often!

This is a great recipe! My husband has decreed it a 'do often' one. I did make some changes. I followed the shortbread recipe exactly - used my Kitchenaid mixer to help. My husband found a really good apple - McCoughan(?) - very tart, very crisp. I folded the sugar/flour mix into the apples, rather than sprinkling it on them (added apple pie spices), and used 3/4 cup of whole grain bread crumbs that I have on hand in the freezer, rather than white bread. Also - used about 1/2 the amount of butter for the last 'drizzling' - was very good.

Don't waste your time peeling apples for this one! This smelled wonderful and looked very appealing when I took it out of the oven: however, when I tried to cut it into bars the whole thing fell apart. I let it cool completely and even refrigerated it for a while to try and help it solidify a bit, but the shortbread base just didn't seem able to hold up under the apples. I've made similar shortbread bars (the lemon bars on this site are great!)before, so I don't think it was my incompetence, but if someone has some suggestions after trying this, let me know! I was really dissapointed.
