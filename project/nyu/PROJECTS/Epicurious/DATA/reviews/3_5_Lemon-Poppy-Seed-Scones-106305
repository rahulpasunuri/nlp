These are great just as the recipe states. I had no need to make any changes to it. I've made them several times with no issue. I did however do a nice drizzle of glaze across the top of them just for fun, a little lemon juice and sugar mix.

Great recipe. A little bit dry so I'm going to try reducing flour from 3 cups to 2.5 cups. The milk also seemed to make it a little to sticky, so I think I'll only use it if needed next time (possibly because I used 2% ?).

Loved it. The lemon flavor is very subtle. Personally I like it that way, but if you really like your lemon flavor, I feel that doubling the amount would give you some good flavor. Definitely wouldn't be too much. All in all. WONDERFUL.

Loved this recipe! I doubled the lemon as some other readers recommended - great lemon flavor. Great texture. I have been leery about trying scones, but the word processor worked great! I'm thinking of trying with anise seed and anise extract. Or cherries and almonds! Thank you!!

This has become my go-to scone recipe, and I've been baking them for a number of years now. The texture is perfect and they are buttery and crumbly in just the right way. Unlike others, I haven't found the lemon flavour to be insufficient. Subtle but distinct. Just right! Generally I omit the poppy seeds, and in fact I've found this recipe to be an excellent base for pretty much any other type of scone I'd want to bake. Four forks!

Agree with most, simply not enough lemony flavor. Doubled the lemon juice, still barely tasted the lemon. Otherwise, followed the recipe to a t, and WOW, the best texture of any scone I have ever had!! Served with some lemon curd. Delicious!

I took these scones into work and got told by several people that these were the best scones that they had ever tasted. Don't sub out the salt free butter to regular butter as it is the secret to exceptional scones.

These were awesome! I also used this recipe to make almond poppyseed scones. I omitted the lemon flavoring and added 2 TBS and 1tsp of almond flavoring. I will definitely make these again!

This is a fantastic recipe!! The only thing I did differently was to double the lemon zest and juice, like another reviewer suggested. Glad I did, because it was just right! They turned out beautifully - light, rich, delicious. My kids and husband LOVED them and asked for more, so we will definitely be making them again!

this is a truly fabulous recipe! i found it better to use lime juice and zest, and to brush the top of the scones with lime juice along with milk. :) 3

These scones are amazing. I did use buttermilk instead of whole milk (which requires a bit more than 1/3 cup), but the recipe is fantastic. They toast the next day like a dream in the oven for about 3 minutes; taste fresh baked. I put a lemon drizzle on the top, since I like mine a bit sweeter: lemon juice mixed with enough powdered sugar to make a stiff glaze. Just a thin drizzle goes a long way.

Such an easy recipe with delicious results. These scones are a new favourite!!

Tasty but definitely lacking in lemon flavor unless you add in extra lemon juice and rind. I doubled the lemon juice/rind and it was just * barely* enough. Next time I'll go for 1/2 C. lemon and much more rind. Good texture. I brushed with a beaten egg and sprinkled with demura sugar prior to putting in the oven. I also used a scant cup of sugar rather than an entire cup. Would have been 4 forks save for the lacking lemon flavor.

These were very good scones. I used ALOT more lemon juice than the recipe indicated (try 1/2 of a cup), because I like a stronger lemon flavour. I also used buttermilk in substitution for the milk, and they had a beautiful fluffy texture. Very delicious!

Wonderful scones! I read what other people said and added an extra tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, it was still fairly subtle, but very good. They are tasty with a subtle lemon flavour, but if you like a bit of zing, add some more zest and juice.

This recipe produces lovely scones. I typically leave out the poppy seeds. I have been experiementing with the flour and have found that using 2 cups all purpose and 1 cup wheat flour gives the scones a beautiful color, enhances the flavor and gives the scone a nice texture. And yes, they still taste great when frozen and reheated in the oven/toaster oven for about 10 minutes.

Great recipe! Made this on the fly, due to a request of "I sure wish we had some scones this morning." Great flavor and texture, easy enough to make. My daughter asks if we can make these again and again!

Easy and excellent! My food processor was too small, so I mixed by hand with a large spoon. After reading other reviews, I went a little overboard with the lemon juice (2 lemons, about 5-6 tablespoons), so they were a little too tart for the first day or so, but then mellowed out very well. I also added dried cranberries to half of the scones, which gave it a bit of a kick. I didn't bother shaping them, just dropped large dollops onto a baking sheet, so they looked like oversized muffin tops. They freeze very well, just pop in the toaster oven to restore the crunch.

Great recipe. Easy and delicious. I double the lemon juice and usually add dried cranberries. Once I used half lemon and half grapefruit juice and loved it.

These scones were amazing and easy to make! I had to put the scones away so that I would stop eating them when they came out of the oven. I didn't have lemons, so I made them with limes and added a little extra lime juice to make sure the flavor came through. I added some frozen blueberries to the dough as well. I second what another reviewer said about the dough: it's really sticky. But don't let that deter you, these scones are great.

I love this recipe! The scones are moist and are especially good warm or chilled...EVERYBODY loved them and begs me to make more! :)

I have made these scones many times for a bed and breakfast I work for. They are excellent. The scones are a little on the sweet side, so, I cut the sugar in half and I prefer them that way, especially if you will be adding fruit to the recipe(which I do often). Whole cranberries, blueberries, and strawberries are some that I have tried. I would like to try subbing kumquats for the lemons sometime. I also add more fresh lemon juice than the recipe calls for, very fresh, tart but sweet. Love it.

I've made these a couple of times and they are delicious! I'm not sure that the lemon flavor comes through enough for me. Next time I'm going to try brushing them with a lemon glaze once they come out of the oven and see how that turns out.

A fantastic faux pas- I made several adjustments, and it turned out yummy. I used my Kitchenaid processor (which always makes a much better scone than by hand in my humble opinion). Instead of milk, I used whipping cream. If you are not wed to the idea of having round scones, the mixture can be sticky (making it more fluffy and light), patted down and baked in a large circle, and then cut into wedges. I prefer a golden top, so brushed with egg yolk mixed with a little water. Delicious!

I've made these a couple times (sans processor) and have always been pleased with the result. This is actually one of my favorite scone recipes!

Rating: 4
Excellent. My dough became exceedingly sticky as I handled it, so after I cut the wedges, I put the dough in the refridgerator. (The rational was that the butter was supposed to be chilled and I normally do that will all batter/ dough that is supposed to be chilled). They turned out quite well and I plan to make them for future brunches.

amatuer cook though i am, i found it easier to mix everything in a bowl not a processor. the method of this recipe thus confused me... but the result was tasty.

I made these last night. Not sure what happened but they went flat and looked more like muffins tops than scones...maybe the butter mixture was too high. but flavor good. I will do again but reduce butter to see if worked, if not these will go.

This was absolutely delicious!! I took a suggestion and added dried cranberries, I also added a bit more lemon zest. The lemon, poppy seeds and cranberries were a wonderful mix. I will definately make this recipe again.

I had to use more milk as well(used at least 2/3 cup). They are good, better the next morning than they were fresh. When first from the oven they were very bland but the next morning when I took them into the office, they were much more lemony. Next time I would use some of the other reviewers suggestions for additions.

I give this receipe a three forks It was very very good and I love scones, I did however make one change ,I added dried cranberries about 1/2 cup instead of poppy seeds. I also added more milk as 1/3 cup was not enough about 1/2 to 3/4 cup, they turned out perfect. Thank you.

I brought these and Orange-Currant Scones to a friend's home where we stayed for a long weekend. They were a big hit! I cut them in half, as suggested. I also brought along some lemon and orange curd which was absolutely wonderful on top!

This was my first time making scones and with the way my blender was behaving, I thought they were going to be a disaster. They turned out great and received a lot of compliments. I think next time I will make them with more grated lemon peel since I didn't think the lemon flavor was strong enough.

I must say these scones dissappointed me. They were, at best, middle-of-the-road. The texture was dry and the flavour needed some zip. I come from a long line of scone bakers and this recipe doesn't rate as a keeper.

Ooh - I liked these and will definately make again! The scones were a bit large for my tastes, next time I'll make them about half the size. I added an extra tsp of lemon rind, but it really didn't need it at all. Plenty of lemon flavor if you follow recipe to a T.

This was a wonderful recipe for scones. It is the best lemon flavored scone recipe so far. Very flavorful and moist. They do raise a bit, and I would cut them into biscuit size rounds next time for a beautiful presentation. Try them, I'm sure that you will really enjoy them.
