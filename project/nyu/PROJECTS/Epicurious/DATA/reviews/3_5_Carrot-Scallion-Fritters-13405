This recipe is simple and amazing. The kids are asking me to make carrots! I serve it as a dish as part of a meal, and therefore usually triple the recipe. I also top it with some plain yogurt sauce, and add some cinnamon to the mixture before frying.

Great! Not your typical starter. I'm so happy to serve an appetizer that doesn't have tomatoes, cheese or served on a bread/cracker base. All my guests loved them. My husband wanted a dipping sauce but I thought they were great without one.

Very tasty and unusual though not, in my opinion, stupendous. It works well with an autumn menu. I wanted a less greasy, more refined finger food so grated finely and opted against deep-frying. Instead shaped them into small, slightly rounded disks (using the mouth of a champagne flute) that were pan-fried in oil. Served them with plain sour cream for dipping. I also added cayenne and a bit of sugar, though I think the 2 tsps sugar recommended by others makes them too sweet in combination with the carrots. Had to use about 25% more bread crumbs for better cohesion. Very well-received by guests with no leftovers :)

i brought these to a tapas party and they were well received. i substitued shallots for scallions since i like them much better. Don't make the same mistake i did and buy the preshredded carrots. They are too long and won't make any type of pankcake shape. Even though they didn't look pretty they were scrumptious. i will be making these again, but i won't take any shortcuts, i will grate my own carrots.

This is a good, simple side dish. I made them into little pancakes, doubled the recipe and fried them on a griddle in a little oil. I'm not a huge fan of deep frying and this method seemed to work just fine. They were very tasty...

Delicious! I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2 teaspoons of sugar for sweetness and shaped them into small pancakes. They were a hit. My son thinks it would be great with a dipping sauce of some sort, but my husband thought these fritters were perfect as is. Very good!

This was really quite good! Instead of balling up the mixture, I made flattened pancakes with them, like a carrot version of potato latkes. Like latkes, these were excellent side dishes, especially when served with apple sauce, sour cream or salt & pepper on the side for dipping! To serve 4 people, I quadrupled this recipe, which made about 30 small pancakes. Make sure to keep your hands wet when forming the pancakes, though - the mixture is quite sticky and hence messy! I'd DEFINITELY make these again.

I love this recipe. The only change I made was the addition of 2 tsp. sugar for sweetness. A great side dish or starter.
