This was a hit when I made it for a Burn's night party. I did include some fresh mixed berries, mostly strawberries and raspberries, and left out the whisky as there was a non-drinker in attendance!!! Note that my oat mixture took less than 5 minutes to toast in the oven. Made shortly before serving, the oats were still nicely crispy/crunchy.

Take it easy on the whisky, but otherwise a really easy and delicious dessert.

In the U.S. "old fashioned rolled oats" means oatmeal that isn't "instant" cook and isn't Scottish/Irish pin/steel-cut oats like McCann's.

On the sweet side. Next time I'll omit the sugar and add a darker, more bitter chocolate and more oats. The cream makes for a very rich dessert, which can only be eaten in small quantities. For a lighter dessert, substituting yogurt might be good.

This is a delicious recipe, and quite easy to make. The whisky adds an exotic flavor to this rich, rather heavy dessert. Note that it does not need to be refrigerated overnight; just a few hours will do. The 1/3 cup of whisky is quite enough, and might be a bit much for some; consider adding only 1/4 cup. The chocolate/oat/hazelnut mixture is an excellent, easy idea that would make a great ice cream topping.
