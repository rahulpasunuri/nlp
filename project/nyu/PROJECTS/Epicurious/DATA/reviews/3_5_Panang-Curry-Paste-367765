This was my first attempt at preparing a Thai style curry from scratch. It wasn't difficult, but I had to go to several stores to gather all the ingredients. Panang curry is my favorite dish at Big Bowl in Chicago and I've missed it terribly since I moved away. The store bought brands don't cut it for me and I can't find a restaurant that is as good as BB. I loved how fresh this curry was and how remarkably close it came to my beloved dish. I couldn't find Kaffir Lime, even at the Thai grocery so I used a few leaves from my Meyer lemon tree. I like it a little hotter so next time I would add more Thai chili peppers as a garnish. I only had creamy peanut butter, which seemed to work fine, but I should have added some extra chopped peanuts. I didn't make the accompanying vegetable curry but instead followed a recipe for beef panang curry from a Thai cooking website .

This tastes very much like the Thai Kitchen red curry paste that you can buy at the grocery, and now I can control the heat! I substituted one tablespoon of dried lemongrass and one tablespoon of dried galangal for those ingredients (both of which I purchased at Penzey's Spices) and the zest of one large lime for the kaffir lime leaves. I also added just a bit of lime juice at the end of grinding. Oh, and next time I will remove the seeds from the dried peppers after soaking because they are hard to grind and were unattractive in the finished product. I left out the two serranos and I was left with just the right amount of mild heat that my husband and I enjoy. It made a total of 6 tablespoons of paste.
