I just made the dressing to put over a mixed green, goat cheese and asian pear salad for Thanksgiving dinner. Big hit! I will definitely make the dressing again!

This salad came out great, had to substitute mangoes, as persimmons were not available.

This salad is FABULOUS! Everyone that I made it for, or passed it along to, has raved about it. It is a winner and I make it every fall.

12/24/2008 - Excellent salad. I have never had persimmons before and loved them. I accidently used white sugar for the brown and the end result was not overly sweet. I think the secret is not to over dress the salad. This salad has a great presentation.

Nope, I won't be making this again. The dressing was too sweet for me, not very complex. The persimmon didn't seem great on the salad -- I think I need more crunch. It just slipped around. The pecans were fine, I added a dab of cayenne for interest and will add more next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. It was fresh and crisp with special holiday garnishes.

Made this for Christmas dinner; grandmother licked the plate! Used Trader Joe's pre-made cranberry sauce which has a touch of orange in it. Worked beautifully. Recommend following the recipe exactly, although I'm going to try mangoes next because persimmons are out of season.

I really liked this, but it was the reaction from my guests that most impressed me. It's time-consuming for a salad, but it knocks people over. There were no persimmons available the second time around. I subsituted mangoes, but it wasn't as good without the persimmons. They were a conversation-starter too.

Just lovely. Used feta cheese for personal taste and made Sweet and Spicy Pecans (from this site) instead of the candied pecans listed because of the mixed reviews. My husband and I made it for dinner three days in a row because we enjoyed it so much.

I had this exact salad at a gathering of friends. I had never had a Persimmon before and it was out of this world. Pairing the persimmons with the blue cheese and a touch of salad dressing just melded so beautifully together. Nothing seemed to overpower anything else, divine.
