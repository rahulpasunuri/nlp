Really enjoyed this, and my kids ate up the tofu. Pressing the tofu makes a great difference. I cut back on the soy sauce. It was my first time grilling tofu, so i was timid, but I should have left it on two to three minutes longer for stronger grill marks. I added the red pepper flakes at the end to keep the rest kid friendly. Yum!

This recipe was fine, but I probably won't be making it again. Nothing wrong with it, I just prefer a saucier marinade. Also, this one was too salty even for my salt-loving palate.

Turned this into a one-skillet recipe (instead of grill + skillet) and loved it for vegan brunch! Used 2 cloves garlic and red pepper instead of Tabasco. Substituted the vegetable oil for extra virgin coconut oil and the soy sauce was replaced by a slightly smaller amount of Braggs. In addition to the 10 oz spinach, I added 2-3 oz of frozen corn pieces. The dish came out so colorful and flavorful that I didn't have it over rice as originally intended. Just the tofu and veggies. TASTY! I can only imagine that it'll taste better tomorrow as the flavors will steep even more. NOTE: As a vegan for the past 6 years, this is the first time I've gotten tofu to marinate properly so the "weighting" step really makes a difference. I weighted my organic firm tofu for 10 minutes under 2 reusable kitchen towels (covered by a plate and topped with a 8 lbs dumbbell). Finished by hand pressing the remaining liquid out, which took about another 2 minutes.

Quick and easy dinner. Very tasty! Even one of my guy-friends liked it. Didn't have any greens so I used mixed vegetables left-over from another meal.

This was terrific! I made it exactly as written, with baby spinach, except I ran out of regular low-salt soy sauce, so I ended up using half that and half dark soy sauce. I also sprinkled sesame seeds on top just to pretty it up. Really delicious! I did double the sauce as some recommended, but I found that made way too much.

This tofu was excellent. I put in a little more ginger and served the tofu over a fresh green salad and it may have been the best tofu salad I've ever had.

We really enjoyed this but next time I would add cashews for crunch and a bit more flavor. I followed the recipe exactly using the red pepper flakes and baby spinach. I served it on brown rice. It was definitely worth making.

Very easy recipe. Be sure to use low sodium soy sauce (as noted on the recipe). I marinade just about the time the recipe called for and not much longer, therefore it was not too salty. I also do buy the extra firm tofu, but still cut and press the tofu under a plate (with a weight on top) for 10-20 minutes. The tofu rarely breaks on the grill, if you oil the BBQ grate (use a paper towel or brush). This is great over any salad, especially an Asian slaw or anything with a sesame-soy or peanut vinagrette dressing.

I thought this was a nice, basic, easy stir fry sauce. I added a bunch more vegetables. You could make it more spicy by adding more red pepper, if you wanted.

this was a really good recipe. it was my first time cooking with tofu and i can easily say i will do it again. i made a few substitutions... i added chili flakes instead of tabasco, powdered ginger instead of grated and i added a teaspoon of peanut butter to give it a nutty-sweet flavour. served with seasame seeds over asian greens (bok choy, bean sprouts, etc) thoroughly enjoyed it! :)

If you like tofu you gotta try this recipe! I added an extra clove of garlic and used a generous 1 1/2 tsp of sriracha hot chili sauce in place of the tabasco. I drained the tofu for about 15 minutes on paper towels and cubed it since I didn't plan on grilling it. I got sidetracked doing other things and the tofu sat in the marinade for about an hour; this was not a bad thing! Sauteed some spinach, tossed in the tofu and heated through. I can't wait to try this with a mix of spinach and baby bok choy and maybe add some lemon grass to the marinade.

I had to cook for a vegan and found this recipe and the client LOVED it! I pressed the tofu for longer and also marinated it longer than suggested. In addition, I made more marinade to ladle over the top of the tofu and greens before serving. very tasty and pretty garnished with some julienned red and yellow bell pepper.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. Made extra sauce for sauteing veggies. Added Bok Choy to the spinach. Also, my husband is a major meat eater. So, I thinly sliced one rib eye steak and sauteed it in the sauce before adding it to the greens. This makes a beautiful plate if you put the greens on the bottom and spread it out, add the steak in a pile in the middle, and top it with the 3 pieces of tofu in a nice pattern and drizzle extra sauce over top.

Rating: 3
This is a lovely recipe. This sauce creates a fine backbone & I only recommend making more of it, as the tofu soaked up so much I didn't have much left for the greens.

Loved it.Get the extra firm tofu and you will save time draining, though you may want to marinate a bit longer.

I too used tamari instead of soy sauce and found that it made the greens especially WAY too salty. (And I don't mind a little extra salt.) The tofu was a nice texture - different from the goopy stuff I'm used to. To get the tofu really dry, I put it on a plate, topped it with another plate, and put a jar on top to weight it for an hour or more. Every once in a while I'd pour off the liquid that was pressed out. At the end I wrapped a paper towel around the 'fu and squished it for a few final minutes. I marinated without looking too much at the clock - probably 15-20 minutes all told, and it worked out nicely. Greens were beet and spinach. Next time I'll use maybe low-salt soy sauce and something thicker than spinach - kale? There will be a next time, because a dish this healthy on epicurious has got to be mastered.

tasty and easy. I also used my George Foreman grill as well as let the tofu drain on paper towels for a few hours. Was very easy to make, and satisfying.

My wife and kid both went vegeterian on me, so I have been trying to find things to do with tofu. This is the best so far. I sliced it into 4, rather than 6, slices. It was delicate at 4; it would have been extremely hard to work with at 6.

My three-year-old daughter begged for more of this tasty tofu and I loved it, too. I served it over rice with spinach and it was quick and easy to prepare as directed. It's definitely a keeper for my family.

This was very tasty and will surely be a summer regular in our household. I did modify the original recipe alittle due to other's remarks including weighting of tofu increased to 4 hours (only cuz I did it during my lunch hour.) I used 2 T Bragg Sauce instead of soy, 1 t molasses instead of sugar, 2 T fresh ginger, 2 cloves garlic, 2 T olive oil, 1 bag spinach - the rest remained as written. after weighting, I sliced the block in 5 patties (family of 5) and marinated for 30 mins (I didn't turn) Then I grilled on lg stainless steel grill, turning once. I put tofu on fresh (uncooked) spinach and topped w/ tahini/ginger dressing.

This was unbelievably quick, easy and good. My husband and I agreed we could eat this once a week. Thought that it was crazy that two people could finish a whole block of tofu - until we did. We used the foreman grill someone gave us for our wedding (5 years ago!) for the first time - it worked great - it finally has a purpose!

Simple dish to prepare and delicious. I placed the vegetables alongside the tofo on one platter for a very nice presentation. My guests loved this dish.

I made this using an even mix of bok choy, baby spinach, and watercress. Even my husband enjoyed it, despite the tofu.

I guess I just do not like the texture of tofu. I wish I did. This dish would be better with chicken, in my opinion. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powdered. I think when using powdered, the ginger should have been cut in half. Served with rice and baby spinach. It was fast and easy, just not as satisfying for me as it was for the other cooks.

I really like this guilt-free dish that is so easy to prepare! My husband and I had it as a weekday dinner. I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the marinade, and used chilli flakes instead of tabasco. It was yummy!

I skipped the greens and used broccoli, asparagus and an asian vegetable mix, and served it with brown rice. It was fabulous and my 18 month old loved the tofu (if not the vegetables)

This was my first time making tofu - I needed a break from my usual grilled chicken. I was amazed at how delicious the tofu was! I used the tofu on spinach salad for lunch (didn't have enough to saute, but will try it next time). I cooked it on an old grill pan that sits on a ring on top of a burner, which worked fine. I didn't have too much trouble flipping it, even though I made 7 slices instead of 6. I was disappointed in the excessive use of paper towels called for in this recipe (I used less than called for and composted them), and I also didn't have any marinade left over (must have lost track of time marinating). I picked up more tofu today and will try it for the family soon.

Delicious, easy, healthy, and quick. Love it. I didn't have the low-sodium soy, so I used citrus soy -- very good.

I did this on the George Foreman grill. It was very good! I think next time I will let the tofu drain for a longer period of time before I marinate it. Marinade was tasty. Only took 3 minutes to grill. I served with steamed broccoli.

I have made this a few times and plan to make it again tonight. I drain and press the tofu longer (a few hours)for a firmer texture, then cut crosswise to marinate, creating thicker slices. My son is vegetarian but the whole family enjoys it. I either make the sauteed greens or typical stir fry vegetables.

This recipe has become a twice-a-month (or more!) occasion. It is simple yet flavorful, and takes little time to prepare. Together with brown rice and a refreshing cucumber and seaweed salad, I have found it to be healthy and fulfilling.

We just didn't care for this. The greens were good, but the tofu was afraid of flavor. Maybe it needed to be mariniated longer.

This dish has become a staple; I now get regular tofu cravings. I slice the tofu in the opposite direction -- like a loaf of bread -- which makes for the right slice thickness.

Rating: 2
Unusually quick to make for a recipe requiring both pressed tofu and marinating--a decent midweek meal. I agree with the cook who used tamari soy sauce and found it too salty; I made the same mistake. I added a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds on top and served it over brown rice. I had no problems with slicing the tofu into six strips and then flipping it on a cast iron griddle. It uses ingredients we almost always have on hand, so despite the two-fork rating, I will likely make it again.

This is a great tofu recipe. I usually end up frying my tofu for some texture, but this is much healthier. I press mine for much longer (a couple of hours actually) wrapped in paper towels and then cloth towels weighted with plates -- it gives it a much firmer, meatier texture (I'm not a vegetarian so that's appealing). I also add dry sherry to the marinating liquid.

My sister, a near-vegan, loved this but I had a few problems with it. I used good-quality brewed tamari instead of low-salt soy and I regretted this. The tofu came out too salty, so next time I'd water down the tamari in addition to adding greater amounts of the other marinade ingredients to as to increase their influence. In addition, I don't think it makes sense to cut the tofu block into sixths. This leaves them too thin for both-side grilling in a Forman grill and you have to flip them -- a dicey process when they're so thin. Next time I'd cut the block into fourths or thirds so they wouldn't require flipping in the grill. Even with fewer tofu pieces, however, there's too much bean curd to fit in a glass pie plate...I found it necessary to divide the marinade into two containers so as to adequately infuse the tofu. Also, I used only one 5-oz. bag of baby spinach and still found the sauteed greens lacking in interest. There wasn't enough marinade remaining to significantly flavor them. We served this with basmati rice, which provided a satisfying accompaniment.

This is a very tasty recipe. The soy sauce and ginger give the tofu a lot of flavor, too much if it marinates too long. I used broccoli, onions, carrots for vegetables as well. I would definitely make it again.

Great, quick recipe. You just can't beat that great sweet/spicy combination in the marinade. We liked the consistency of the tofu after 6 minutes in the Foreman grill. I used Swiss chard from the garden and served brown Basmati rice on the side.

I just loved this recipe! I made it for a friend who is into food combining (no proteins w/ starch) and she enjoyed it very much. I marinated the tofu 10 minutes on each side and that was perfect. I think 1 hr. would be a bit too long- it would make the flavors a little too strong. Highly recommended for tofu lovers!!!

Grilled marinated tofu on the Foreman grill and it worked really well. Maybe serve with rice or noodles. Very flavorful marinade.

Excellent, very easy to make. Tofu is an added bonus. If you make it with the tofu,I would let it marinade for about an hour or so. Doubled the recipe and I still ran out.
