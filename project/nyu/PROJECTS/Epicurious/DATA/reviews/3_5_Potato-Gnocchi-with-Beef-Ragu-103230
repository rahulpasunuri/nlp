Excellent. Used leftover potatoes from Thanksgiving and leftover beef sauce from Beef short ribs provencal that I had previously frozen.(a divine beef broth substitute). Used ground moose instead of beef and a bit of organic bacon fat instead of the bacon and/or prosciutto. WOW!! A note for anyone who has never made gnocchi before...they need to be removed from the water immediately upon floating. This gnocchi recipe is great, worked perfectly for me. The ragu is equally awesome.

Loved, loved the ragu! I made a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand, for example I used dried shiitake mushrooms,lamb stock, and homemade tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste and canned tomatoes. But it was still amazing! The gnocchi were a little plain compared to other gnocchi I've had, but it was still really good. I will definitely make it again.

This is for the gnocci only: fantastic! I'd never made gnocci before, but it was so quick, easy, and delicious, it's definitely going into the rotation. The gnocci were tender and tasty. I used whole wheat flour to improve the nutritional value and they still had a delicate, almost sweet potato flavor. I paired the gnocci with a quick bolognese, which worked very well.

awesome, Gnocchi is a great recipe. I followed it exactly the first time to get the feel and now I use this as the default gnocchi recipe for other dishes. I replaced the ground beef with tenderloin tip diced to about 1 inch and used veal consome instead of stock, but other than that followed it down to the letter and it was fantastic.

I've made this ragu' sauce several times. It is so delicious as is, so I have never made the substitutions. I'm afraid of wrecking the balance in the flavor of this simple recipe. I am pairing it with vegetable pot stickers sauteed in garlic.

The ragu was delicious and will certainly go into my permanent all time favorites cold weather dishes. I did make some modifications to this recipe using ingredients I happened to have on hand. I made the following modifications: used mixture of veal and pork, added syrah to the broth while reducing, fresh porchini mushrooms (cut fairly thick to retain their shape), beef bouillon, all bacon.

We only made the sauce portion of this recipe. It was very good, but I guess we didn't feel it was amazing. I think the addition of some red wine and maybe some fresh mushrooms might add the additional depth of flavor we were hoping for.

Even though I subbed ground turkey for the beef, I still thought this was incredibly rich. Way too rich. My guests enjoyed it, but it wasn't a favorite of mine. (This only applies to the ragu -- I used a different gnocchi recipe.)

I rated four forks for the ragu only, as I couldn't pull off the gnocchi, it just tasted like boiled flour. I can't blame the recipe, it could be me. But...the ragu is so great my husband can't stop telling people about it and here's a sneaky trick: although I kept the pancetta and prosciutto as directed, I used ground turkey instead of beef. When used with the beef broth, you get such a great flavor that you don't miss the beef, esp. if you are trying to make a healthy dinner. Plus, no greasiness as others report. So the point is: it translates well with turkey if the rest of the recipe remains unchanged. Other modifications I made: no mushrooms (don't like them) and ground sage (didn't have leaves) Still a spectacular, sure-fire dish.

I made the gnocchi and the beef ragu. The gnocchi were ok - next time I will just buy them already made. The beef ragu, on the other hand, was fantastic! It was very rich - definitely not a light dish. I couldn't stop eating it. I will make this again!

I only made the sauce and it was unbelievably good- it tasted as good, if not better, than what you can find in the best italian restaurants. Be warned that even the sauce is very time consuming, it took even longer for it to reduce than what the recipe said. I recommend making it one or two days before (and drain at least half the fat after cooking the ground beef), heating it up and serving it with fresh gnocchi or pappardelle, and DEFINITELY adding the freshly grated parmigiano reggiano. Delicious!

Just made the sauce so I am not sure about the Gnocchi, paired sauce with butternut squash gnocchi. Loved the sauce, but split the beef w/ ground pork....only change I made.

Fine, but not worth the work. Also, very greasy.

The gnocchi is excellent. I was very concerned because I think the recipe is vague about testing for doneness. But the ingredients and technique make for full-proof, light-but-sturdy little dumplings. The ragu is also excellent. It's extremely rich (I didn't add the extra water). This is a GREAT recipe.

Great recipe! Substituted veal for half of the meat, made it even tastier! Use Ground Round for the Ground Chuck and spruced it up with some ground red pepper flakes. Used prepackaged gnocchi - what a great meal!

I like gnocchi, but was always concerned about making my own and having them turn out poorly. The gnocchi in this recipe turned out as good, if not better than what I've had in up-scale italian restaurants. The ragu was great too, but I tripled the garlic.

I normally doctor-up all the recipes I find in here, but here I only substituted wild dried mushrooms for the porcini(They have a smell like urine, YUK). Also I changed the Gnocchi to the spinach and ricotta gnocchi (substituting the Feta cheese as suggested: http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=103453 I broiled gnocchi in garlic butter and laid on top of a pool of ragu to finish. You will not find a better dish anywhere!!

I enjoyed this recipe twice now - I have only made the Gnocchi part, though. It was very good - I doubled it with no trouble and put the uncooked Gnocchi in a single layer in the freezer (on a cookie sheet). Once they were frozen, we took them off the sheet, and put them in a ziploc bag to store in the freezer. We cooked them two weeks later, and they were no different! Took only about one minute extra to cook. Would reccomend for a nice homemade pasta recipe.

I used to buy potato dumplings in Chicago and I've been thinking about trying to duplicate them for a while now. Using this recipe I've come very close!!! Just shape them like an oversized marshmallow and serve with chicken and cream sauce/gravy...MMMMMM good. Need to figure out how to make them a little denser...not so light and fluffy... Very good recipe!

Excellent recipe. As good as my Italian Mother-in-law can make. The gnocchi comes out beautifully, but can be time consuming. The sauce is also good on pappardelle.

i made this recipe as written and the gnocchi turned out a little tough, i think next time i will make tyler florences gnocchi, he adds a touch of baking powder which works wonders for the texture. The recipe is on the food network website.

I didn't make this entire recipe, only the gnocchi (served them with vodka tomato cream sauce) and they were wonderful!! Easy to do and delicious and light. Highly recommend this recipe.

Made the gnocchi only. I'd never made gnocchi before, but to my amazement these turned out beautifully - very light, and the nutmeg is perfect. Made the day before and held in the fridge as suggested. I did not end up using all of the flour - probably just a little more than 1 c - and I used the potato ricer rather than mashing. I suspect these two factors contributed to the lightness. Will definitely make again (with the ragu next time!).

These gnocchi were absolutely delicious. I didn't feel like beef, so I made the gnocchi and combined them with chicken and a pesto cream sauce. They were light, tender, and scrumptious! One small change I find helpful is adding the nutmeg and salt to the flour mixture instead of stirring it into the potatoes with the egg and cream. It's easier to get the spices distributed evenly that way, instead of trying to work them into the sticky potatoes.

The ragu was fabulous. It saved the meal since this was my first attempt at gnocchi and I failed miserably. My gnocchi were wet little lumps of goo. The sauce made them edible (a small miracle). I'd try the whole thing again though.

I usually omit/change/add ingredients in recipes. Yet, on this occasion I did not - and wouldn't recommend doing so either. The dish came out absolutely "perfect". Really delicious! I have since made it four more times with the same fabulous results. I recommend this to anyone who likes potato gnocchi.

Wow! I made this for my family tonight, and it was recieved very well. I loved the gnocchi, which by my own fault was a little lumpy. I skimped a little on the beef stock (2 cups) but I liked how it turned out.

I really didnt like the ragu,probably because of its smokey taste fom the bacon.But the potato gnocchis were terrific!

Wish I could rate the gnocchi separately from the ragu -- LOVED the gnocchi, light, not sticky like some -- but thought the ragu was rather "common." It smelled terrific, but for some reason the aroma was much better than the taste. Will make the gnocchi again, not the sauce.

I have made this recipe several times. I do omit the bacon. It is fabulous. I have also added a garnish of fresh pesto. We love this so much I will continue to make this for years.

I have made many gnocchi recipes, and this is the best one I have found. The whipping cream gives them a light texture, and the potato taste is much stronger than the floury taste of some gnocchi I've had in the past.

This has been our favorite mostaccioli sauce ever since it was first printed. I omit the prosciutto, and use bacon. I also drain about half the grease after cooking the meat. This is so easy (although it takes a little time).

This is a delicious dish!! Even my picky friend, Tommy, had seconds! Preparing the Gnocchi was quite time-consuming, but the sauce was easy and delicious!

My husband enjoyed this, but I didn't care for it. The regular bacon I used imparted a smokey flavor in the dish, and I didn't care for it. I cut the oil down and cooked the meat separately to cut the grease in the recipe. I wouldn't make this again. It was a bit of work and not worth it.

YUMMMMMMMM...This has become a favorite of ours! The recipe makes plenty of sauce, we usually have it another night over a different pasta. It is a lengthy recipe but well worth the effort, my guests are always impressed. Definitely a keeper!

This sauce is fabulous... This dish has become a favorite in my house. I don't bother with gnocci any longer. We serve this over pasta. So good...

While this is a little time-consuming to make, the first review was right! I used bacon, omitted the proscuito, used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 chicken broth. Porcini's are meaty tasting and so the dried mushrooms I used weren't as tasty. Absolutely no changes to the gnocchi, though!

This recipe has become a favorite. The ragu is hearty and the dumplings are superb!
