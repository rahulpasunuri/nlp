I used what I had, which were mushrooms, red onion, brussel sprouts, beets, parsnips.I used sesame oil instead of olive. Very good.

These were wonderfully flavored and went well with wheat pasta. The only change, add a couple cloves of garlic.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe for our first garden squash and zucchini of the year. I would recommend fresh thyme instead of the dry I used the first time. Vidalia Onion was used instead of the red onion and added extra balsamic vinegar during cooking. We will definitely make this one again.

Next to grilling this is the best way to cook these delicious vegetables.

This recipe was okay. I suggest trying, a similar, but much better version - Mushrooms, Squash, & Bell Pepper Salad BA 10/98 in which I added red onion.

very simple. i added mushrooms for more variety the second time i made the recipe. i suggest adding extra dried thyme and salt and pepper prior to and during cooking. i also added more vinegar toward the middle of the cooking time. rave reviews both times i made this one.
