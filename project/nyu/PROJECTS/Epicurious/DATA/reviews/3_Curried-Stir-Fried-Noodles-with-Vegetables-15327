I always make these with the garlic roasted pork and sometimes finish with the apricot souflees with the creme anglaise from the same issue. To die for. LOVE this recipe. I omit the salt because of the soy and it is perfect. Sometimes I cook too many veggies and noodles and think I need a little more sauce, but with the pork, it's a true winner. Have made this meal many times for ourselves and to impress (for friends,clients, etc.) and it's a hit every time.

This recipe was far too salty for me. I think the soy sauce is plenty enough salt, and there is no need to add more. I even used low sodium chicken broth and added more sugar and curry to balance it out. I also used sake instead of the scotch as suggested. I added some lightly fried tofu and snow peas which made it more of a complete meal. Next time I think I will simply pour the sauce over the noodles instead of stir frying them in it.

Making this very regularly since '96, serve with garlic roasted pork in the same article. Use regular vermicelli after the first time, rice noodles were too gloppy. A consistent hit!!

This recipe has a lot of potential but I think the "curry powder" that I used was a little over powering. There are sooo many kinds of curry powder- we actually make our own and I think the recipe wouldv'e been better with different seasonings. I'll make it again but with some other flavors.

I made one substitution - dry sherry for the scotch. We loved it. The rice noodles were a nice change of pace.

I used Rice cooking wine. Substituted tomato chicken boullion for the broth(with water, of course) used carrots onions cabbage and shitake mushrooms for the veggies. Added a scrambled egg after the curry, turned out real well!

This is a very flavorful dish and I make it regularly. It makes a filling vegetarian meal and has great flavor, but not so much that my kids won't eat it.

this is really good and rather simple to prepare...i would definately make this again. I served this with the chinese wings (dads wings) on this site.

I love garlic, ginger, etc. but hated this dish. The flavors were overpowering, particularly when combined with all the garlic in the barbecued pork that this dish accompanies. I am a very adventuresome cook, and have to say that this is one of the worst dishes I've ever made.

I make this all the time -- add any vegetables you like. It's a great dish to serve for vegetarians -- everyone loves it, and it's easy to make and clean-up after.

This was one of the best noodle dishes we have ever had. Absolutely fabulous. Tried a variety of vegetables and they all taste great. A definite keeper!

This dish is a good accompaniment to the Chinese Barbecue Pork with Garlic Sauce. I would make some minor modifications next time, though. For instance, the scotch added a weird flavour - I'd substitute sake or mirin next time.

Mixed the veg up a bit and it worked just as well. Very flavourfull, we have made it again and again.

The sauce and seasonings for this recipe are great. It work's well with a variety of vegetables, I used carrot, onion, red and green peppers as well as the scallion. The dish can become a one pot meal if you stir fry in a shredded boneless chicken breast after adding the curry.

This is a great recipe - I substitute Orange juice for the scotch and it works out great. I have made it several times with almost every vegetable (except potato).

This dish is delicious. Sometimes I like to cut back on the broccoli and add in some green cabbage, red bell pepper, and zucchini, all thinly sliced and steamed with the other veggies. In my book, it's really more of a 3-1/2 fork rating.
