This came out excellent. I also added white truffle oil to the butter at the beginning of the celery & leek saute process. Also dropped in 2 tablespoons or so of dried wild mushrooms. The added ingredients kicked up the flavor without overpowering the celery. i'd make this again as it was a snap to do.

Just okay--somewhat bland and tasted like cream of chicken soup because of all the chicken broth, and I guess the soup isn't flavorful enough to mask the broth. Also a strong taste of cayenne. Won't be making it again.

This recipe is very easy and satisfying. I did not have creme fraiche so I just used heavy cream instead and added a thyme sprig to the soup when it was simmering. I did not make the stilton toasts, instead I just made some croutons to add some crunch. Check it out at www.blackberrydreams.blogspot.com

I absolutely LOVE this dish. I have made if for dinner parties and low key dinners alike. I typically substitute low fat plaion yogurt for the creme fraiche and add some cayenne pepper while the soup is cooking to give it a little more spice. Simple and easy to make, yet healthy!!

I made this with plain, fat-free yogurt substituted for the creme fraiche, and it was great! Great subtle flavour.

This was good, but not outstanding; it's a great way to use up celery, but not a dish I'd serve to impress anyone.

I loved this recipe the first time I ate it, but when it came to eating the leftovers, I just couldn't. The flavors are very strong, especially with the stilton toast...but at the same time, the stilton toast was very complimentary. I say make this for a group as a first course with something less rich later on.

This was surprisingly good. I'm not a huge celery fan, but I keep getting bunches of it in my organic produce box, so I needed some way to use it up! Luckily I found this recipe. The flavors of the celery, leeks, and potatoes meld together wonderfully. Simple yet delicious. This would be a perfect starter for an elegant dinner.

First time I used leeks - and it's a smart combination with celery. Leeks aren't as sweet as onions... Although my soup turned out more like mashed potatos with celery and leeks. I must have added less than 4 cups of water (I also add lemon juice to bring flavor since I have a problem with stock)- but it was a good mashed potato dish.

This soup is fantastic. I have made it with/without the creme fraiche and it is tasty both ways-obviously richer w/the creme. The stilton toasts are a very nice touch as well. Highly recommended.

I love this soup. I initially made it b/c I was asked to, I really didn't expect much. To my surprise this is the most simple soup ever prepared and tastes delicious. I use more leeks than the recipe calls for, greens and all. I also use sour cream instead of creme fraiche.

Delicious! We made this exactly as stated and really liked it. The stilton toasts are a nice addition. "It's a keeper," says my husband.

Loved it and so did my guests, stilton toasts were especially yummy. Wouldn't change a thing.

I've made several batches, and I freeze them in single-portion containers without adding the creme fraiche, which I add after heating the soup. It's excellent, and now a mainstay. Good with or without the Stilton toasts.

I have made this on four seperate occasions as a starter for a more elaborate main dish. In each case, the soup has been what all of my guests raved about. I usually double the Cayenne pepper, which adds a surprisingly pleasant kick to an otherwise docile yet delicious puree.

I made this soup last night without the toasts, and my boyfriend said it was the best soup he's had. It was even better today for lunch. I used almost double the celery, double the cayenne (leaves a nice after-punch but doesn't detract from the initial delicate flavor), and substituted heavy cream for the cream fraiche. A hand blender works wonders to puree it too. I will definitely make this again!!!!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner for family and friends and everyone liked it. I think I would do something different with the toasts, maybe not a blue cheese?? I also made it 2 days ahead which made dinner prep a lot easier. I served it as a first course to a Crown Roast of Pork which was a perfect pairing. I doubled the recipe for 8 and it was way too much. The leftover stayed out all night and we had to throw it!

We made this for Christmas dinner, 2 days in advance. It was simple to make and delicious. Our unadventurous diners seemed less skeptical when I said it was a potato-based soup, but they ended up loving it.

Excellent soup, with elegant presentation! I used three toasts per person as well, with Danish blue cheese instead of Stilton. Also, used good olive oil in lieu of butter. Will pass grated or crumbled blue cheese at the table next time instead of the creme fraiche swirl.

Delicious! Adults and children both loved it, and it's simple enough that my 8 year-old grandson can - and will - pretty much make it himself next time. We used an immersion blender and liked the consistency.

Excellent make ahead and delicious pairing with the Stilton toasts. I agree with above reviewer that replacing some of the celery with celery root might add an earthier, more complex flavor. I served 3 toasts per person because . . . I might even consider floating one next time because the melding of flavors was fabulous. We served a lovely 2000 Coppola Diamond Servies Chardonnay. Perfect compliment.

I have never cared for celery but I must say this soup is fabulous! It's something you might find in a fine restaurant. I only used half the cayenne and found it perfect. I can't imagine using more. For the toasts I used Shropshire Blue cheese instead of Stilton with excellent results. Shropshire has cheddar like qualities for a blue and was much cheaper. I just served this soup for Thanksgiving and I am thankful! Don't pass this recipe up.

This is outstanding. I have shared it with many who have tasted it in my home.

a nice, basic way to prepare celery bisque. i think it's greatly improved, though, by using only half the amount of celery stalks and one whole celery root (peeled, chopped). it makes the soup beautifully creamy and aromatic.

Just had this for dinner tonight with a green salad. Perfectly acceptable and easy to fix, but not outstanding by any means. It's a basic veggie puree with a bit of broth and cream type of soup that I often throw together when there's not much in the fridge. We thought the toasts were a bit strong for the delicate flavor of the soup but they were tasty. Overall, fine but nothing I'd rave about or necessarily make again.

This was an outstanding recipe--the flavours of celery and leek come through distinctly. I tried it before I served it to guests and my husband and I both loved it. Will definitely serve it when entertaining, aspecially with the Stilton toasts.

Made this soup for a dinner party a couple of weeks ago and doubled the recipe. The flavor is nice and the Stilton toasts were a wonderful complement, but in the future I'll reduce the cayenne. I like my food with a kick, but the pepper was a bit overpowering. My advice, add the cayenne a little at a time, and remember it tends to have a cumulative effect.
