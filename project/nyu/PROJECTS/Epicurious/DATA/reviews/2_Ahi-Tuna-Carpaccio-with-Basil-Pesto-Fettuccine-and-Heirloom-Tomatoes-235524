an existential question: why would the pureed tomato ("tomato water") need to be strained if it's not actually being served in the final dish (i.e. "plated" in chef-speak)? seems like that's an unnecessary step... but maybe i'm missing something. (not that i'm even going to attempt this recipe either way... but still. i'm curious what people think.)

"Use 8 tomato wedges to form a circle around tuna." 8 of the marinated tomatoes on each plate.

recipe is incomplete. What was the purpose the tomato salad? If this was to be another course then say so. I think it was to be placed on top of the tuna but that wasn't stated. There is too much invested to just guess.
