I added 2 extra cloves of garlic and used 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. My husband who is very fussy about his dips loved it!

The first disappointment I've had from this website. Even with extra garlic and tehini it was pretty flat. Save yourself the trouble and save your aubergines (eggplants) for something more interesting.

Very disappointing. Save yourself the effort, try a different babaghanou recipe. Very bland, one-dimensional. We added mint and garbanzo beans to make it edible.

This recipe was very easy to make. I think the flavors need to blend before eating. I added extra garlic and cumin
