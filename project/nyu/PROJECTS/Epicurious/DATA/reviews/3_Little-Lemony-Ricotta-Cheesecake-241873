I totally enjoyed these little lemony desserts. The recipe says that there will be some ricotta lumps - and there were in mine - but they surely do not detract from the wonderful flavor. These little jewels are a lighter and more refreshing version of cheesecake. Be sure to use a good quality lemon curd for the best result.

I used a fresh creamy style ricotta and blended the cheeses in the cuisinart. Nice. The lemon curd topping was a good addition. I would make this again if faced with very limited time.

Recipe says "spray 8 ramekins" but it also says "makes 6 servings" Which is it? (the print copy of the magazine said the same thing)

These looked tantalizing in the picture and seemed like a quick easy way to have a cheesecake-like dessert on hand without fussing with crust, separating and beating eggs, etc., but in the end the flavor was OK but the texture was disappointing. (Dense, slightly grainy) The outcome probably depends a lot on the ricotta that you use-- mine was nothing special (Trader Joes whole milk ricotta), maybe a creamier/wetter one is what the recipe needs.
