This is the same recipe as the World Peace Cookies, also by Dorie Greenspan. I would give four forks for flavor, but the cookies are very difficult to slice due to the chocolate chunks. The second time I made them, I tried making them more like drop cookies, but this resulted in a very chewy cookie, instead of a soft cookie, like the first time. Sprinkling a little sea salt right as they come out of the oven adds a nice (and delicious) touch.

I have had the original cookbook from the time of its first printing. These cookies have been my "go to" ever since. When I do cookie exchanges these cookies are the ones everyone wants! Nice balance of sweet & salty - very sophisticated flavor.

Easy to make, freeze well baked and travel well! An all around great cookie, not too sweet and nice and chocolatey!

Made these twice, first time used only 1 stick of butter but forgot to add a bit of water so the dough was extremely crumbly and hard to work with. Flavor was fantastic, as was texture, sandy and crispy. Second time I used all the butter and found it much easier to form the dough but didn't enjoy the end result quite as much. Think I'll play with it a bit more.

These are fantastic! I used one 3.5 ounce bar of Lindt Madagascar chocolate, shaved. I think larger pieces would be more indulgent in the cookie, but harder to manage the dough, and slicing. The dough is challenging enough as it is to get onto the sheet. But keep the faith, as these bake into perfect discs of rich, intense chocolate with crispy edges and a chewy center. Be sure to use dutch-processed cocoa. None of that bitter, powdery flavor of some other "chocolate" cookies, these are both sweet, satisfying, and sophisticated.

Gorgeous, moreish cookies. I made them with unsweetened chocolate, (all I had in), and they were incredible. If you overcook them, the chocolate bits cause craters to form in your cookies - watch for dimpling so you don't overcook them.

I measured the butter wrongly and used too much of it, which caused the cookies to spread into a flat mess on the cookie sheet. I cut them up into pieces and my family ate them anyway. Lovely flavour and very more-ish.

Easy and really impressive. If you refrigerate over night or for a couple days, take the dough logs out 5-10 minutes before you need to cut them. Makes it go much easier. I whacked the chocolate in a ziplock bag with a mallet and got a more course result which drew rave reviews. It may be counter to the spirit of the cookie, but people liked getting a warm ooze of chocolate in every bite. Also, let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the hot cookie sheet for best results before attempting to transfer to cooling rack.

This is one of our favorite cookies, hands down. I often modify with a little mint extract. Very good. I've also pressed the dough out into a flat "sheet" and cut out cookies with no problems. It's a rich cookie, but delicious. I've cut back the butter to 1/2 cup/1 stick and added a tiny bit of water to compensate (maybe 1/2 tablespoon, max) and it's still delicious. Also good (great! rich!) as-is...

This is a lovely dark chocolate cookie, a cross between shortbread and a brownie. Good quality chocolate chunks are important.

My husband thinks they are crumbly but I love the texture and how they're soft but not chewy and firm but not hard. I used French gray salt and vanilla bean paste and really enjoyed the results. I will be happy to make these again and eat them all myself.

I flubbed this recipe and they slid off the cookie sheet in the oven. :-o However, the crumbs that remained were fabulous!!

This is the exact same recipe that used to be listed as "World Peace Cookies" on this site. An unusual and very tasty chocolate cookie. A shortbread, but undercooked so soft and chewy. I make with kosher salt, and have a nice salty hit.
