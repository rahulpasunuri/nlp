Great recipe - reminds me of a mousse we made at the Carversville Inn in Bucks Co, PA a million years ago. I made it with Gran Marnier.

Fantastic dessert. I substituted strong french press coffee for the Cognac (as another reviewer suggested) added the salt to the cooling chocolate mixture. Served with chopped salted pistachios and fresh strawberry on top.

Delicious! And fairly easy. Get some extra whipped cream for garnish with a strawberry slice (looks naked without). Ghirardelli 60% worked great.

This probably took me more than 30 minutes but I'm more of a novice at cooking. I used chambord as the liquour of choice since I was serving it with raspberries. It was fantastic. I thought I had overbeaten the cream since it had a pudding consistency when I folded it into the chocolate mixture, but once I let it sit in the fridge for an hour or so, the texture was perfect for mousse.

Put this in a fancy martini glass with some whipped cream (going to have to try that white chocolate whipped cream samj530!) and a few raspberries and you've got a dessert that rivals any restaurant's mousse!

This was simple enough to make, but the end result was pretty simple too. In my opinion, this was not worth the purchase of cognac and fine chocolate or the many dirty dishes. If you want a decadent chocolate dessert that dazzles, go for the Black Bottom Chocolate Pie on this website.

I use this recipe often as it is often requested of me to "please make chocolate pie". I pour it into an oreo chocolate crust. If I don't have brandy I will substitute 1 tsp frozen white grape juice. I have tried many different chocolate combinations including hersheys. My favorite is 4 oz 70% cacao giardellis with 4 oz belgium milk chocolate. I always add the egg whites when it is still hot because it seems too risky to serve raw eggs. I add the whipped cream after it cools. Sometimes I put whipped cream on top. I have tried adding coffee, I didn't like it, if you do try it only add a very small amount (half tsp or less?) as it will over power the flavor easily.

Absolutely fabulous! Not too sweet, creamy, rich & delicious. I served it in a chocolate pie shell with a chocolate ganache layer under the mousse & stabilized white chocolate whipped cream piped on top. My father-in-law demanded I make another for Thanksgiving!

This recipe is the best! Quick and easy and amazingly delicious. I used 68% chocolat because thats all I had but it was amazing! This is a must-have recipe.

This is a very yummy rich chocolate mousse. It is of utmost importance to set the desserts out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to serving to acclaimate chocolate and butter. I topped the mousse with whipped cream and fresh raspberries.

Found this recipe last night while I was waiting for friends to come over for a BBQ - I only had half an hour, so I needed a recipe that didn't require chilling. Very easy, and great results - a big hit! Used Triple Sec since I didn't have any cognac, but you can't really taste the booze once it's all together. I recommend the bittersweet chocolate chips from Bulk Barn. It's 3/8 cup butter for us Canucks who don't buy sticks. You really have to whip the egg yolks a while to get the right consistency.

So good I made it twice in one week! I used a 50/50 combination of cooking chocolate (72% cocoa solids) and 'confectionery' dark chocolate (39% cocoa solids). It was so easy, and absolutely devine. I will never buy supermarket chocolate mousse again.

I found this really disappointing. I didn't have any problems making it, actually it's one of the rare times I didn't play with a recipe, following it exactly. I found the texture disappointing as it wasn't the light yet rich texture I was looking for, instead it was very thick and, for me, too heavy for a mousse. I could have lived with that if it had tasted any good though! I used Lindt, but found the amount of butter to chocolate overwhelming, and I'm pretty sure this is what ruined the recipe for me. It was so rich that it was like eating cake frosting or fudge. I adore chocolate and sweet things, but this was too much for me; will be finding a worthwhile recipe.

kikiru, did you melt the chocolate and butter over hot water? If not, that is why your chocolate never reached a smooth consistency. The double boiler is very important for melting chocolate properly. As for the egg yolks, they should eventually become a very light yellow and you should see lots of smooth peaks when moving your beater through the yolks, similar to when you whip cream. Just made this recipe for a friend's birthday. Super easy and tastes great. I ended up using coconut rum since I was out of brandy but sadly you can't taste it very much. Perhaps it's just that my rum is who knows how old.

Help! What went wrong? Apparently I am a novice in need of some advice. My chocolate and butter never really looked "smooth". I had to use a large saucepan instead of a large metal bowl, because I don't have the latter. I couldn't find "bittersweet" chocolate that wasn't over 60%, so I bought a 52% semi-sweet. I don't really understand the concept of egg yolk "ribbons". The chocolate and butter melted together looked kind of like chocolate cake frosting, and when I whisked in the egg yolk and liquor, the whole thing started looking clumpy, and the butter separated from everything else. It looked awful, but I folded in the egg whites and cream anyway. That took a really long time because the clumpy chocolate did not blend easily. So I'm sure I overworked it during this stage. It looks funny, full of little white specks. Wish I could make it smooth and beautiful! Any idea what went wrong?

Super easy. Everyone loves it. I use rum instead of cognac - goes over great with sailors.

quick, easy and very rich. i replaced the cognac with a tablespoon of strong brewed coffee.

This was SO easy and quick! I had a craving for some mousse and made it in no time, topped with some fresh whipped cream and blackberries. The perfect chocolate fix.

This was fantastic and very easy. It is stiffer than some mousse, so if you plan on serving with pumpkin spice mousse (or another type), put the other type on top.

This is so quick and delicious, I will make it again and again. I beat the egg whites first, put them in another bowl, and then did the yolks, and then cream so that I could use my KitchenAid for all three whipping steps. Worked fine. This is almost too rich. Next time I will use a tad less chocolate and butter, say 1 oz less chocolate and 1-2 fewer tablespoons butter and see how it goes. I used Lindt Bittersweet and a small amount of chocolate chips to make 8 oz of choc. A little goes a long way. Great with fresh raspberries.
