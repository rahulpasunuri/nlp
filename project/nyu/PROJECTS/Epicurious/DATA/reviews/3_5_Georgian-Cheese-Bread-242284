Try to make this with the filling of 2:1 -- shredded mozzarella: crumbled feta, plus 1-2 eggs. The filling should be quite salty. You can bake the pie the oven or make 2 pies and cook them on stove top in a 12 non-stick skillet (5 minutes on one side, covered and then another 3- 4 minutes on another side, uncovered). In Georgia, this is eaten either as a side bread with appetizers and main dishes or at breakfast with tea or coffee. In some parts of Georgia, similar pies are made with the addition of potatoes, garlic, herbs, etc., but they all have their own names. Khachapuri is the one with cheese only.

I really didn't think this was going to turn out but boy, I was wrong! Quite tasty and sure, a little oily but I think that's what gives this bread its charm. I plan on making this again and experimenting with different cheeses.

This was pretty simple to make and really delicious. I chose to purchase just one kind of cheese and used garlic seasoned havarti, and used a little bit less than the 1/2lb total amount of cheese. Next time I'd like to use the mozzarella too. It was greasy, but I'm not complaining! I couldn't quite bring myself to brush butter over the top though, so I just used some of the oil from the cheese as it melted out of the center of the bread.

Blah! I didn't like this. I thought it was too greasy and the dough was really dry. Adding potatoes would have definitely helped, but I won't be making this again.

This is very tasty comfort food. My grandmother made a version that used mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese. The proceedure was the same. We brushed it with brown butter and heated it in the oven. She was Checz.

A quick comment for those who may find this recipe a bit bland - the bread is not used necessarily as a main dish, but more as a side to go with other dishes. Add more salt to taste, and brush some melted butter over the top. Also, adding potatoes will make it delicious.

"heart attack on a plate" sounds just about right but oh, goodness, was this good. Prepared just as written and this will be an immediate (albeit infrequent for my health's sake) addition to our recipe box.

This was very easy and pretty tasty. My husband did find it a little boring, so I would probably add a little garlic in with the cheese and serve it with a marinara or pesto dipping sauce, although I'm sure that would make it less authentic.

I have not made this recipe but I have made Hachapuri many times. In America, we use mostly mozarella, little bit of cream cheese, little bit of feta to recreate sulguni and always add one to two eggs in the cheese and mix well. Traditionally, this round hachapuri(there are many different types) is made in a skillet over the stove top NOT in oven.

Great recipe. My first venture into the world of bread baking. Was the only thing I had for dinner and it was just missing a sauce of some sort. Any suggestions?

I haven't yet had the chance to make this recipe, but I'm giving it 4 forks for its potential. I devoured khachapuri during my last trip to St. Petersburg (Russia) and it was one of the most memorable foods of the trip. I've tried several times to recreate it at home, but the cheese is so different! Someday I will find the right cheese and be able to savor the flaky cheesy goodness that is this dish.

As someone who has eaten a mountain of khachapuri, I can assure the reviewer from Baltimore that the bread is supposed to use a cheese with a high fat content. In this recipe, the blend of Havarti and mozzarella works as a very good substitute for sulguni. In the Black Sea region of Ajara, the custom is to drop a raw egg in the center of the hachapuri before baking it -- this is affectionately known as 'a heart attack on a plate'. It's utterly delicious as is this recipe.

This bread was very good, but my cheese came out a but greasy. My friends didn't mind, but I kinda did. I think that the Havarti was the culprit, and I think that I'll use something like Asiago next time. Overall, this is a pretty easy recipe, and it will impress your friends. I served it as a side, but you could even make it a meal by dipping it in some sauce. I think it would also be good with some herbs in it, although I suppose it would no longer be authentic Georgian cuisine. My only tip is to use scissors to cut the X in the top.
