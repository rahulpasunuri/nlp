NUTELLA AND BANANA....

I've tried this recipe as written and really like it. I also just combined this recipe with one of Giada's...buttered baguette slices, but nutella and strawberry slices instead of chocolate. It is amazing! I like it even better than the original recipe.

This is absolutely sinful. I enjoyed it. :) I used Ghiradelli 60% and I liked it much better in this recipe than I do in most other chocolate recipes. That chocolate has a lot of fruity nuances and they really seemed to add another dimension to these mini sandwiches, making them shine. This isn't terribly impressive of a recipe (i.e. I would never serve it to guests) but it is a really nice treat. My first thought for putting it to use is kids' sleepovers and parties.

Yummy! I'm home alone and felt like something chocolate without eating it plain or making a whole dessert. This hit the spot!

This is amazing. I also make Giada's similar sandwich - same bread and chocolate...AND add a couple of slices of brie and fresh basil leaves. Don't knock it til you try it! They are heavenly.

I love it. I made a few with the Ghirardelli 60% dark and they were tasty. Then I made a few with Hershey's Special Dark and I like them better. For less money I got a bit more chocolate into the dessert. Either way you can't go wrong with this one.

So simple, so good! I didn't have bittersweet chocolate, so I used semi-sweet chips and white chocolate chunks. Will definitely be making this again.

this was great tasting and SO easy. my only mistake is that i didn't make more of it. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate which was perfect. I also buttered the both sides of the bread and the pan lightly for just a little more umph. The bread was beautiful and crusty. I didn't have a baguette so i used small peasant rolls and they came out like little sandwiches. A little powered sugar on top, and it was perfect. So lovely and easy, truly like a chocolate crossiant but better somehow. the sum seemed to be greater than the parts.

I would use a bread with a less "crusty" crust. It made the yummy, gooey sandwich a little difficult to bite & chew. The taste was delicious (butter, bread & chocolate - how could it be anything but) however the texture was tough.

Made this for a quick dessert. It was wonderful.

Anyone try to make these on a George Forman yet? I don't see why that wouldn't work...

I was looking for a simple desert to make at a friends house. This turned out to be very impressive. There were only three of us and we had to force ourselves to quit eating them. We put a little powdered sugar on top and it complimented it very well. I will definitely make this again.

Lesson learnt. ALWAYS read the ingredients list carefully. I bought a 85% cocoa solids bar and the result was too bitter for a chocoholic to digest.

Made this for an after breakfast treat and loved it! I put butter on both sides of the bread to add a little extra heaven. This is to die for!!!!

I have made this in a panini press for years and it's fantastic. Somehow tastes much more delicious than it should.

We made this on a whim and were impressed. So easy-- and SO GOOD. Simple and elegant. We used the our waffle iron's griddle side to fry both sides at the same time. We will definitely be making these again.
