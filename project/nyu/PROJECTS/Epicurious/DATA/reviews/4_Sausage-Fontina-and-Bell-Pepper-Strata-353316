I made this for brunch for friends coming over with their toddler. It was incredibly delicious, easy to make and not time consuming. Everyone loved it. I used 2% milk (instead of homogenized) and made it the night before, leaving it uncooked and covered in the fridge. I was a little worried when I pulled it out but it cooked up beautifully (I didn't let it come up to room temperature, just pulled it out of the fridge and sit for about 5 minutes). Everyone enjoyed it and I didn't have to rush around cooking eggs to order, making bacon and toast. Everything in one pan. No coordination, no getting up crazy early to cook. Couldn't be simpler. I'd try frying up some mushrooms and adding some spinach to it next time. Delicious!

I am about a year behind on reviewing this. Made for New Year's Day brunch 2012. It was a showstopper! It seems so much heartier and filling with the crusty bread. The sausage, cheese and peppers complement each other perfectly. Guess what will be on the table THIS NY day?

Delicious! Perfect Christmas morning brunch dish with fresh fruit. It does take some time to prepare so give yourself plenty of time.

I used turkey sausage and sourdough bread, and threw in a handful of fresh spinach. It was GREAT. The fresh oregano seemed to add a lot. My family loved it.

I have made this twice now to rave reviews. I replaced the fontina with gruyere but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I made it and let it sit in the fridge for almost a full 24 hours the first time and not even 10 minutes the second time and both were good. It also makes for great leftovers and my daughter loves having some for breakfast on a school day.

Delicious! I found that I needed to use additional eggs and milk to soak the bread. Made it a day ahead, which I would recommend. Smoked gouda is a nice added flavor if you're not a fan of fontina. Also, more than a 1/2 t of salt! More like 3 t...

This tasted amazing and was so easy to make. Very filling. I used 1.5 lbs of sausage.

This is one of my favorite stratas. A fantastic Sunday breakfast! I've made the original, but since my family and I like spice, I add in some hot peppers and roasted garlic. I also mix in some cheeses such as gouda or havarti (basically whatever cheese I have on hand). In fact, I'd like to make it for Father's day (if I can get my kids to wake up and help!!)

A delicious crowd pleaser! I substituted feta and fresh mozzarella for the fontina cheese, added an egg and to make it a bit more healthy, omitted the cream and added 1/2 cup spinach and 1/2 cup basil to the recipe. It was rich, tasty and loved by all at a family brunch. This one is a keeper!

My go-to strata. I normally don't make something more than once or twice, but this is a post-race staple in my kitchen. Fontina gets a little expensive, so unless you're a fanatic any old cheese will do.

I made this as an assemble-the-night-before-Christmas dish for a crowd and it turned out great. A really simple recipe, but tasty and hearty. I also added green pepper so it was festive for Christmas.

This recipe is delicious and easy enough to make. I highly recommend it to bring for group brunches, breakfasts, etc. It would also be a good way to feed a large family at home. Serve this plus some pillsbury cinnamon rolls, and you have an easy breakfast for many!

Substituted Parrano cheese for fontina, used a ground "country sausage", and ripped bread into small pieces. Delish! Definitely a keeper.

Delicious and festive! I added some baby spinach and used skim milk which worked fine. I used the cheap french bread baguette from the grocery store which soaked up nicely. Made it the night before which probably also helped a lot. Can't wait to make it again for the next holiday brunch!

I needed to make an "egg" dish for a Christmas brunch potluck. This one caught my eye because of the green onion and red bell pepper which I thought would make a festive presentation. I don't like my stratas so "bread" so I used enough bread to do one layer on the bottom. I also add 2% milk in place of whole, diced the bell pepper and added another egg. Everyone loved it and had many requests for the recipe.

I made this for a July 3rd brunch. It was well-received by my guests who, oddly enough, thought that it had a Mexican/Latin flavor. They would probably give it 3 stars. However, I am only giving it 2 stars because I thought it was heavy and tasted exactly like a sausage pizza. Also, unlike other strata recipes that I've made, none of my house guests wanted to eat the leftovers which I eventually tossed. I wouldn't make it again.

I made Mother's Day brunch for my in-laws for the first time so I wanted something that was foolproof and low stress. This recipe fit the bill. Super tasty & easy to make. I prepared it the night before like some other folks suggested and that made the bread nice and soft and the flavours came through really well. Will definitely make this again.

I served this for brunch and it was so delicious! Like others suggested, I made it up the night before, and also added some asparagus. It was a lovely combination of flavours and textures and reheated beautifully. I added a little more grated cheese on top before baking and it finished the dish off perfectly. A definite keeper!

This turned out amazingly well on my first attempt. Brunch guests begged for more! I would recommend preparing the night before and letting the custard set overnight - recipe doesn't specify this, but it's how I'm used to making strata. I took it out of the fridge a half-hour before cooking, to bring it back to room temp. Next time I will use a little less fresh oregano. I also replaced a half cup of milk with a half cup of cream - made it nice and rich and delicious.

Very easy recipe that adapts well to substitutions of whatever you have on hand. Everyone loved it!

Excellent and easy Christmas morn strata. The only change was that Italian turkey sausage was used. It does appear to be less wet than other stratas I have made when first assembled, but I think that because of this it does not require any extra cooking time (as is oft the case with other stratas on this site).

made this for christmas morning and it was a huge hit. reheated it for lunch and again the next day. perfect. i changed the recipe as i didn't have fresh oregano--used dried; also used sweet sausage. it's really, really good.

LOVED IT! I served this Thanksgiving morning to all my company and it was a huge hit. I did substitute the sausage for a ham steak (sausage was in the stuffing) and omitted the salt. The fresh oregano pulled the dish together. Making this also the day before let the flavors come together prior to baking it.

I used this recipe for a baby shower brunch. Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe! Found the Fontina at Fresh Market. Didn't quite understand what bread to use as rustic means different things to different cooks. I chose a pane round loaf from Fresh Market and skipped the rustic bread with seeds etc.It turned out delicious. I could totally see using sour dough and will do so next time. Amazingly easy and stunningly delicious.

Had everything ready to go (except cooking) the night before. Did add extra eggs because there was room in the dish and thought it would make it even more substantial. Wasn't sure what bread to buy, so ended up just getting a 10 oz French baguette, and thought that worked fine. Everyone liked it, and it also tastes great reheated and at room temperature.

I just made this dish for a Sunday brunch and it was a hit amongst all of the guests! The flavors are great together. I was able to find ground hot Italian sausage so it saved me the step of removing the meat from their casings. Overall, it was pretty easy to make, so I will be putting this one in my grade-A box of recipes.

Rating: 4
I made this for a work potluck and kept it vegetarian since there were a few non-meat eaters in attendance. I too followed others' advice and cubed the bread, then soaked it overnight. For veggies I used a red pepper, a yellow pepper, brown mushrooms, and red onions (I kept the green ones out of the egg sauce). I used regular and smoked fontina as well as parmesan for the cheeses. I then sorta tossed it all together instead of layering. It was cooked to perfection in about 45-50 minutes. It turned out delicious and everyone ate it up! There are endless possibilities to this dish, I can't wait to try it with spicy sausage or thick bacon next time.

Made two of these for Easter Brunch. Prepared it the night before so I cooked it a little longer in the morning. Hubby was helping me and coarsely grated the romano cheese- Happy accident-Loved that I could taste the romano in the finished dish. Didn't have quite enough fontina so added some cheddar as well. The combination was wonderful! Hot italian sausage was great and not too hot mixed in with the bread mixture. I tried to keep the bread in slices, but ended up cubing it. Glad I did! It was beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. Gooey with cheese, not too eggy, and crunchy on top, which everyone seemed to like! Made 1/2 a pan with no peppers for the kids. Wasn't nearly as pretty, but they loved it!!

Since I made this for just my husband and me, I halved the recipe and used an 8-inch round casserole which accomodated all the ingredients nicely. So easy and very delicious, albeit rich and high in calories. As such, this will be a special occasion dish.

This was very good and easy to do. The fact that you can prepare ahead (and is better if left a while) makes this one of my new go-to dishes for breakfast/ brunch company. It is hearty however, so not for dieting person. I did use skim milk in place of whole to cut back on some of the fat and just added a touch more whipping cream, and it turned out delectable still. Very very very good. Serve with a side of fruit salad to lighten everything up a bit.

This is just wonderful. Using sweet Italian sausage instead of hot, I easily assembled this the night before. I used only 1 teaspoon of oregano and it was adequate. Since it was cold when I placed it in the oven, needed about 1 1/2 hrs. to bake.

I made this recipe with a few substitutions - fresh basil in place of oregano, and gouda cheese for the fontina. I also used kosher salt for the salt and added some fresh ground pepper in the egg mixture. It was awesome! I know that you could lighten the recipe up to reduce the fat content, but for a special brunch, it worked out great and it looked so appetizing. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a birthday brunch and a caterer asked for the recipe. Used dry, heavy Italian bread (Trader Joe's artisan loaf) and found it held up beautifully, melding with the fontina for a rich, delicious dish. Used chicken sausage and added a couple eggs. Would make this again in a heart beat. A real crowd pleaser.

I added asparagus to red pepper which gave it extra color. Covered and put in fridge overnight before baking which made it so easy to put in for brunch the next morning. Served with a mixed green salad with oranges and pecans. It was the perfect brunch and several people have asked for the recipe.

I made this for my bridge group, and everyone loved it. I used chopped sweet onion, rather than sliced green onions, added mushrooms, used sweet Italian sausage, and cubed the bread, rather than slicing it. I mixed it all, rather than layering it, let it rest for 20 min., pressing bread down occasionally. Covered and refrig.over night. Took out in am about 1/2 hr. before baking. Baked covered for 45 min., uncovered for 15. We loved it!

I made this for our day-after-Christmas brunch. Judging by the number of people who went back for seconds, I'd say it was a hit. I used veggie sausage links instead of the hot Italian sausages; I cubed the bread instead of slicing it; and I diced the bell pepper instead of cutting it in strips. Then I made layers of cubed bread, green onions, the cheeses, and the sausage/bell pepper mixture. Over these layers I poured the egg, milk, and cream mixture. I had to use twice as much of the liquid mixture as the recipe calls for, maybe because my bread was light-textured and so one pound was more voluminous than most. I assembled the entire dish at about 2:00 PM one day, and baked it at about 10:30 AM the next day. It turned out great!

A lot of rave reviews! We thought this was good but I've made better recipes. One thing, we don't think we got HOT Italian and that would make a difference. I used a whole red pepper and parmesan cheese.

After reading all the reviews, I thought I would give this a try for Christmas morning, and I have to admit I am sorry I did. How would this be better? Rather than bread, I would use sliced fingerling or new potatoes. The bread was "gushy" (like uncooked french toast in the middle) and didn't hold up the filling - there's a reason why bread pudding only has raisins in it! The taste was ok, but the mushy texture just didn't sit well with me. Everyone ate it, said that it tasted good, but I am my own worst critic and the texture was just too sloppy to serve for Christmas. I would not do it again...

I highly recommend this dish. It was the perfect entree for a family brunch on Christmas morning. I made it the night before, and simply slid it into the oven for an hour as we unwrapped our gifts. Paired with a fruit salad, mimosas and pastries, it was divine. I did make a few tweaks to the recipe, all yummy ... substituted sweet Italian turkey sausage, added asparagus, used cubed day old rosemary sourdough bread and opted for Monterey Jack rather than Fontina cheese. Like other cooks here, I mixed everything together rather than layering and refrigerated overnight. It got rave reviews!

Like another reviewer, I also brought this recipe to tailgating for a noon game. It was delicious, travels well, and reheats very nicely (what little leftovers I had). Be sure to cover with foil during all but the last 15 minutes or so of baking, otherwise the long baking time will char the top. Definitely a keeper!

This was really yummy and filling, and cost me a lot less than $2/serving (probably because I used sharp cheddar instead of fontina). I used low-fat milk and turkey Italian sausage to reduce the fat content somewhat and it came out great. I forgot to use oregano, but it wasn't missed. Like another reviewer, I just cubed the bread and tossed everything together instead of layering it, letting it soak overnight before I baked it. Soooooo I didn't exactly follow the recipe, but it's a fantastic template recipe. :)

We enjoyed this recipe. Per others' suggestions, we cubed the bread and let it all sit overnight in the frig. I couldn't find fontina cheese, so we subbed Italian blend, and it was good. My husband suggested next time we use cooked bacon in place of the sausage. I would make this again.

I belong to as CSA and therefore had a ton of veggies and nothing to do with them. thus a lot of tweaks occurred. This is a great vegetarian version. keep the liquid recipe the same, minus the green onion. saute: swiss chard, arrugala, zucchini, broccoli, turnips. mix all together with caramelized onions. follow the other instructions except replace the fontina with cheddar. Voila! Delish

I loved this dish! Instead of cooking the red pepper with the sausage, I used roasted red pepper, along with roasted asparagus, which I layered on top of the sausage layer. It tasted great with the asparagus and also added a nice color contrast.

Rating: 3
I made this with layers. I will make it in the future but will cube the bread and let it sit in the egg mixture for longer. The 20 minutes and layers didn't allow the mixture to soak in properly. The flavors did go well together though. Maybe some red onion slices would be good too.

Rating: 2
To a Cook from...New York: You can do this ahead of time; it's actually best to let a strata sit in the fridge (covered) overnight to soak up the egg custard. Another tip: don't layer. Cut the bread into 1-2" cubes and toss everything together. Carefully place everything into the greased casserole and go from there. Good luck

I served this at a ladies luncheon accompanied by the Arugula Salad with Lemon-Parmesan Dressing...great flavors together! I doubled this recipe and found that I needed to add more liquid to fill the pans so I added another dozen eggs along with about another 2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of cream. I poured it over the top and it worked beautifully. If doubling, I would also think about adding another 1/2 of sausage. I got both mild and hot italian sausage as well. The flavors are really good!!!

This recipe is good. We made it tonight and halved it and it worked out fine which can be a problem when scaling liquids. The smell while cooking is great and the taste is very good. The only tweaks we made were using a roasted bell pepper, cheap sour dough bread, and we put a dollop of sour cream on the serving. Would be great for breakfast or dinner.
