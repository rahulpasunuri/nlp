Exceptionally delicious. One of my guests commented that they thought this was better than any steak they had at a restaurant. I made the sauce indoors and took the mushrooms out of the frying pan before making the sauce and served them on the side. I will make this again...

I served this to guests a few weeks ago, and it was awesome. It was simple, elegant and very delicious.

Really good and quite simple. I used rib-eyes because they are more flavorful.The sauce didn't thicken very much.

Fast, easy, and delicious. The sauce is wonderful. Add some black pepper and you'd have a terrific Steak au Poivre, too.
