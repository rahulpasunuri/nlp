A really great truffle! I doubled the recipe, brought to a boil 3 times just for kicks, and divided into 4 parts for variety. I made lemon and tyme, cinnamon and cayenne, Chambord and espresso with Baileys Irish Cream. The Baileys truffles resulted in a creamier ganache which, when chilled, was easiest to form into a ball for dipping. I found the best way to coat in melted chocolate was to use surgical gloves and keep hands independent. Roll the chilled ganache in one hand, coat the ganache ball with chocolate using the other hand.

There are so many recipes for ganache out there, but this really is the best. I've tried quite a few, and I even like this over the recipe my head chef gave me at the restaurant I work at. I convinced him to change it after I brought him truffles from home. hehe. There are many varieties to play with. I like to add cinnamon and cayenne as another reviewer mentioned, as well as hazelnut butter, seedless raspberry jam, etc. But I always use the same 2/3c cream to 11oz chocolate as my base for the smoothest, best truffles ever. If your truffles aren't holding up at room temperature and you coated them with chocolate, your chocolate coating was not properly tempered. Tempering chocolate is a pain and a half, but its worth it if your chocolates will be hanging out at room temp for long periods of time. If you just roll the little balls of ganache in cocoa powder, however, I've always found that they hold up quite nicely.

Fussy, but amazingly wonderful. Note: I added some cinnamon, a small bit of sugar, and cayenne pepper to the cocoa, which was a smashing success with the dark chocolate : )

This is one of those recipies that has very few ingredients and very few instructions, but it requires a lot of thinking about how the ingredients are behaving. Some people have tried this recipe and ended up with a chocolate mess, which is easy to see how they got there! First step is to get the ganache into "truffle shapes", not necessarily perfect little balls. Chill the ganache until just firm enough to handle. Use the refrigerator, not the freezer. Monitor carefully. Form into little shapes and then put into the freezer for a bit. Second step- if you want to smooth out the ganache balls before coating, do it now using gloved hands. Roll the ganache around in your hand, it will melt a bit, smooth it out. Back into the freezer. 3rd step- assembly line! Melted chocolate (double boiler), ganache balls, bowl of cocoa, another bowl with a small fine strainer. Smear warm chocolate on left hand (if right handed), pick up a ganache ball, coat with chocolate, drop into cocoa. DON'T USE YOUR HAND, use chopsticks or little tongs to roll the truffle around and to move it into the tea strainer. remove excess cocoa and drop into little decorative paper candy cups. Once you get the hang of it, you can do 100s of these at a time! :-)

I will be traveling and can not keep them chilled. will an airtight container at room temp be ok?

As many others have said, these are just heavenly. I've been making these for years, and they are always well received. Shaping them with a melon baller works best for me as well. If difficulty is experienced with the truffles holding up at room temperature, it's most likely due to the exterior "seal" not being complete... Making sure the warm chocolate completely covers the cold ganache center will alleviate "leakage". Don't add butter to these! Especially if expensive, high quality chocolate is used - there is no need, and it really takes away from them. :)

I'm a cook, not a baker, so not often do I make anything that I have to measure. But with only three ingredients, this recipe became my dessert for my truffle dinner. EASY! and DELICIOUS! After using the melon ball and teaspoon to scoop them onto parchment, I placed the little morsels in the freezer while heating the chocolate. I'm too lazy (see above refusal to measure) to use gloves, so just used my hands. I found best results from rolling the frozen truffle in my hand to shape and warm, smeared with chocolate, then rolled in cocao - easy and they look great. So easy, I was inspired to pick oranges off the tree, grate the zest and roll 1/3 in that, then another 1/3 in crushed pecans. The orange is AMAZING! Now my menu features 'hand rolled Belgium chocolate truffles' to follow my truffle oil dinner.

Very easy - although messy - and delicious! I wound up with two dozen truffles, though (rolled, rather than piped them)and promise I didn't eat the ganache by the spoonful, no matter how tempting! If you're counting on 60 pieces, you might plan on making more than one batch.

This is an excellent truffle recipe. Because it is so simple, you can certainly be creative with different flavorings if you wish. I wanted to make "Earl Grey" truffles so I infused a couple tea bags into the cream while making the ganache. The result was subtle but definitely lent a bit of spiciness to the chocolate flavor and the bergamot came through quite well. I was amused to find this recipe as I had just been the lucky recipient of a nice box of La Maison Du Chocolat ganaches from a French friend!

These are great truffles! I have made them many times and people love them. I do follow the recipe as-is, but sometimes I add Kahlua, espresso powder or cayenne pepper to the chocolate. Hmmm...I guess that really isn't "following the recipe." My next truffle adventure is to press something into the middle during rolling. I use bittersweet chocolate (Santander is good, so is Valrhona) for the ganache and either bittersweet, milk or white chocolate to "enrobe" the truffles. I don't care for white chocolate (because it's not chocolate!), but I have friends who do. I also like to roll them in cocoa powder or toasted coconut after the "enrobing." A friend of mine rolls hers in coconut she has soaking in lime juice. Sounds wonderful to me! Can't imagine adding butter or sugar to this - or any other - truffle recipe! I was looking for a recipe where the chocolate took center stage and this is it. I roll by hand with and without gloves. It's tedious, but the outcome is yummy. These should be kept cold as the recipe suggests.

Disappointing. I've made truffles for years and was attracted to the simplicity of this recipe. Unfortunately, it was impossible to get the truffles to hold up at room temperature. I would suggest using 1/3 C cream and 1/3 C unsalted butter to 12 oz chocolate. That yeilds a truffle which will stand firm at room temperature.

Easy to make and excellent results! Wasn't sure what a gloved hand really meant in terms of kitchen tools, so used a plastic sandwich bag over my hand to smear chocolate and it worked well. Will definately make again.

tasty, but impossible to get the noted yield.

The reason Mr. Linxe boils his cream 3 times is because he buys it from a farm unpasteurized...he needs to kill the bacteria...therefore it "lasts longer". It's really not necessary for us.

As a pastry chef, I've made alot of truffles. This is my favorite recipe. The ganache is smooth and intense and it's very easy to make.

I've been making truffles for a couple of years now and these are definitely the easiest and delicious. I added some liqueur after I took it off the heat then cooled it a little then put it in the refrigerator and in an hour or so I could make little mounds with the pastry bag. I then froze them, rolled them in the melted chocolate and covered them with nuts. Perfect!

I didn't take enough excess cocoa powder off so the truffles were a little bitter a first but once they started to melt in your mouth, WOW!! they were good.

These creamy and intense nuggets were very popluar with my friends last Christmas. Using the pastry bag to shape them made it much easier, but I found recoating in chocolate a bit tedious. I also used Callebaut chocolate which is good and not as expensive as some others.

Not so sure why this is "Robert Linxe's" truffles, since this is the classic recipie for truffle filling (aka ganache). I use a 1-tablespoon scoop to form the truffles; though the chocolate doesn't come out easily and you may have to work the mechanism a few times, I find it's easier to get the portion size correct. But the best idea here is to roll the truffles in your gloved hand containing a little melted chocolate -- so much easier than trying dipping forks or anything else. And the coating that ensues is perfect -- it keeps the truffle shape, but is thin and doesn't interfere with the truffle mouth feel (not to mention that you don't need tempered chocate because it's so thin). But be bold -- double the recipie and make as much as you like. Just keep most of the formed truffles cooling in the fridge as you roll some of them.

After tasting a sample of Robert Linxe's confections at a party in LA only to find out how hard they are to come across, I was thrilled to find this recipe. I also chose it because it was the most simple and was delighted that it came out so wonderfully! I did find it a bit challenging to shape the truffles, though.

Outstanding! This recipe is easy to follow and the results are delicious. I refrigerated my ganache and shaped the truffles with two spoons, which worked very well.

Pure Bliss! I wish someone could have cleaned up my kitchen after the truffle making though. What a mess to make but, it was my first time and I think with time I may neaten up. Coating the truffle with the glove also was a bit tricky for me. The end result was beyond compare.

Extremely easy and delicious recipe! I have made these truffles with the Valhrona chocolate called for in the recipe and also with a mixture of 61% Valhrona and 54.5% Callebaut. It has come out exceptionally well every time.

I've made this recipe using good quality, inexpensive dutch-process chocolate chips from Trader Joes and had outstanding results. I've also added a little espresso powder to the cream and those came out very good as well. Great Recipe!

If you dont have a fancy meathod of drizzling chocolate, and you find it EXTREMELY tedious to use a toothpick (as another reveiwer said), you may find my meathod acceptable. Melt the chocolate so it's JUST melted, (you dont want to scorch it, or you hands). Pour it into a clean, small (sandwich size) ziplock bag. Squeeze it all into one corner, and remove as much air from the bag as possible. Seal the bag, and cut a tiny hole in the corner of the plastic bag. You can use this as a piping bag. It works really well. I do it every time I make truffles! Also, if you find that rolling in cocoa makes the truffles too bitter, you can add a small amount of icing sugar to the rolling cocoa. ☺

First, let me state that I am not a huge truffle lover. This recipe looked so simple and had so many good reviews that I gave it a try. It was my first attempt at truffles and went very well. THIS IS AN EASY RECIPE AND IT WORKS. The result is delicious. I used 58% Callebault (Valrhona is quite expensive here) and coated with Belcolade 71% without problems. I think that this quick and simple recipe is a winner because it allows for you to do it many times and get the right balance. For example, I plan to add some sugar to sweeten things slightly and experiment with adding peanut butter (a la Thomas Keller's French Laundry cookbook). Artists among us can have a great time decorating their creations with chocolate of different hues painted in stripes on top of the finished truffle. Different shapes (e.g. square) seems like a good idea, too. I would probably skip the dusting of cocoa powder, unless you are used to strong (bitter) tastes. Either way, serve with milk and in small portions . . .the first bite is devine, the fifth is probably too much of a good thing. Finally, I agree with a reviewer below . . .you'll get at most 30 truffles out of this recipe. This same recipe with pictures is found at http://www.epicurious.com/g_gourmet/g06_feature/truffles/truffles.html

I have searched year after year for an awesome truffle recipe and have finally found it! I made three batches; semi-sweet, white and milk chocolate. I alternated the chocolate coatings and topped each truffle with an alternate chocolate drizzle of melted chocolate using a toothpick. Many were given away this Christmas as gifts....and I have many requests for this recipe. Fantastic. A keeper, which we will make every Christmas.

First, let me say this is an AWESOME and simple (and messy) recipe. But...don't be fooled by the projected yield. I would say that each batch of ganache will yield about 20-25 regular-sized truffles. This is a great base recipe for other truffles. For example, use half 56% and half 61 or 66% chocolate for a dark chocolate truffle, and use the latter for the exterior. Even better, finish these off with a tempered chocolate coating. At shots of espresso, or steep lots of orange zest in the cream for the ganache for orange truffles; add some flambeed Cointreau...delish. Enjoy!

These are delicious and easy to make. Great for a chocolate fix. I liked the directions to pipe the truffles instead of scoop and shape them--it was really fast. I made a big mess rolling them in melted butter, but that could have been predicted. I would also make them a little bigger next time.

This is by far the most delicious truffle recipe I have ever tried. I travel to Paris about 4 times a year and ALWAYS go to La Maison du Chocolat for Robert Linxe's chocolate truffles. The best in the world....they are exquisite!!! I went to a candy making class the other night and they made chocolate truffles with sugar and butter added...what a shame for when you use the true Valrhona chocolate as Mr Linx has suggested you would not even dream of adding anything to it. I much prefer his version, which speaking from a chocoholic point of view is the "purist" recipe. Enjoy!
