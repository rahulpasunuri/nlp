I have made this for two years in a row and will definitely be making it again. The brine was fine - not too salty for us, the rub delicious and the glaze insanely good. Both years cooked it on the BBQ for Thanksgiving and there was none left afterwards - even though there was turkey too! This year it got overcooked - not enough attention paid - and it was still amazing!!!

Did not like the rub seasonings at all. Glaze was ok. Brined for 24 hours - didn't make it to the center, but I found the gradient of saltiness interesting.

A note to some of the reviewers below: A "fresh ham" is not the same as a pre-cooked ham. A fresh ham is basically a pork roast, as it has not been cured. If you are using this recipe on a ham that is already cured, you will get much different results. I think I will make this in addition to a goose for Christmas dinner. Sounds great...will report back. :-)

I forgot to mention...double or even triple the glaze recipe--you will want more!

I have never made a fresh ham before (though I spent all summer mastering pork shoulder on the Weber), and this was the perfect recipe to use on a fresh ham the market had on sale. I followed the recipe exactly, and had no trouble with the level of salt for the brine (I brined it for 24 hours). The three layers of flavor infusion, with slightly different flavor profiles, gave amazing depth to the ham. The cracklin's were beyond good. I can't praise this recipe highly enough.

Yum! 24 hours of brining seemed just right. I did it in the oven and the skin was crispy and delicious.

This was EXCELLENT - by far the best way to cook a ham! It barely made it to the table...we were shamefully eating it as we sliced *blush*. A must for parties and get-togethers. :)

I made this recipe twice in as many days for the Easter holiday for two families. The first time I followed the recipe to the tee. I brined the ham for 40 hours - just shy of the two-day mark. Big mistake! It was very salty, though still edible. I used the majority of the rub and it gave the ham a beautiful color, but we didn't particularly care for the strong taste. I also used the glaze which was virtually undetectable because of the saltiness and strong flavor of the rub. However, I have to admit, the ham was juicy, but probably not any more so than any other one I've made before. The second time, I brined for only 24-28 hours & rinsed the ham with fresh water. I generously sprinkled the rub (using maybe only an 1/8 of the entire mixture) on the ham. I baked it at 330 degrees and the last HOUR to HOUR and a HALF, I started putting on the glaze which I had made slightly more of this time around. OMG! It came out brilliantly! The first attempt, I would give it 1-2 forks, but the 2nd attempt, I would give it a good solid 4 forks. Another bit of useful info...don't use table salt - use kosher or sea salt for the brine. I'll definitely make this again with the adjustments.

What a great ham! Simply delicious! Everyone raved! This would be perfect for a L.A. Easter dinner with one-time-east-coaster friends. Takes up space in your fridge for the prep, but otherwise it's easy.

We have made this on 2 separate occasions, every time a HUGE success. Its great for a party because you can serve so many guests. We skipped the molasses glaze the second time as it had a tendency to burn and the taste from the rub is outstanding!

well, this is the best ham ever! husband says never do ham anyway else and i think he's right! i purchased a "partially cooked" ham and it did just great! and make sure you brine it at least overnight! still had on skin and that is the ticket. make sure that when grilling the fat side is up - that makes all the difference. i did on a charcoal grill at the beach and am going to try on my gas at home. this will probably be a monthly dish at our home. we sliced and served on our new year's eve buffet, expecting lots of left overs - no way - everyone from age 6 to 50 loved this even a mostly vegetarian daughter of a friend tried a piece cause of the rave reviews. well worth the time and effort - just watch the temp on your charcoal - and make sure you keep it as consistant as possible.

I have always found fresh ham rather bland, but this recipe, minus the glaze and with the addition of a really good home made barbecue sauce, makes the most incredible pulled pork ever. The glaze is also wonderful on cured ham and pork loin.

Great recipe! I bought a pre-cooked ham and skipped the brining step. I also warmed in the oven instead of grilling and it was still fine. Substituted maple syrup instead of molasses since I didn't have any on hand and it worked fine. Even my very picky nephew ate 3 helpings!

My whole family thought this was delicious. It was the first ham I've ever cooked, and we loved it. There is a bit of extra time involved because of the brine, but not much extra effort. It was pretty easy. I baked it in the oven, but I bet it is amazing grilled!

We had a fully-cooked ham for Thanksgiving so we just used the rub from this recipe & the glaze from the Ginger-Rum Glazed Ham recipe. The rub is wonderfully savory & was nicely aromatic as the ham warmed. It pairs well with the sweetness of the ginger-rum glaze & our guests loved the combination. This definitely stays in my recipe box.

Great recipe! Well worth the small time investment! If you are doing this on a gas grill, make sure you watch the temp or you'll lose out on the pan drippings which are the best part. Keep it at low or slightly above....

I bought a fully cooked Ham so I used only the rub and the glaze. I put the glaze on the last 30 min of the cooking time and also cooked it in the oven. I was a bit worried because I'm not a ham eater so I couldn't taste it myself to see if it passed muster. But it was a hit nonetheless.

We made the ham for Easter company. It was delicious and worth the effort.

I cooked this ham for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a success!! It was time consuming but definitely worth it. I cooked it in the oven (it was to cold to BBQ!) and it was delicious. Tip: ask your butcher to take the skin of the ham... its not a fun task.
