This was really good. Nice texture on the shortcake. I substituted lowfat plain yogurt for the heavy cream because that's what I had on hand. They only took 10 minutes to bake in my oven so be sure to check them early.

Great dessert! Next time I'll add a bit more sugar to the whipped cream and vanilla too! We made this with strawberries instead of raspberries - worked fine.

I have made these shortcakes since the recipe was published in 1991. The shortcakes are very good, not too sweet with a nice crumb. It's not a brownie or a cake; it's more of a chocolate biscuit. The berries are delicious. Make 3 or 4 shortcakes, rather than 2, if you want a smaller dessert. Adjust baking time. It's quick & elegant.

This is a great, easy recipe. It took me way less than 45 minutes to make it. While the shortcakes were baking, I made the raspberry stuff and whipped the cream. Then I assembled just before dessert was served. I wish there were a way to get the shortcakes not to crumble. As it was, I cut them on the dessert plates, and had to hold the top with a spatula in one hand while I put on the berries and cream. Also, these are huge; the same amount could make 3 or maybe 4 pieces. VERY tasty and impressive for such little effort.

Disappointing. Sure, it was easy to make, but the batter tasted a lot better than the finished product.

I have made this recipe many times. People love them! I substitute Grand Marnier for the Framboise. And have also done with strawberries instead of raspberries. Recipe doubles easily to serve 4 instead of 2. Yummy Yummy
