Made this many times last summer with a stunning array of zebra tomatoes and yellow tomatoes. Beautiful and delicious!

Quite disappointed in this after all the glowing reviews. Used flavorful ingredients but the parts did not add up to anything special. The combination of the tomatoes and the watermelon just didn't do it for me or anyone else in the family. Can't figure out what the fuss is about?! I've made a melon panzanella from eating well that is absurdly good; the dressing for that salad is a lot more interesting; perhaps that is the solution.

Herbal, earthy, sweet, salty, this dish has everything! I wish I had made more than one serving because I probably could have eaten four.

This was an excellent salad. I omitted the arugula and just used fresh basil from the garden - wonderful, simple flavour combination; refreshing accompaniment to summer BBQ fare

Just what we needed in 100 degree heat. I cut down th eingredients to make enough just for two. Very refreshing with a hint of saltiness from the feta. I used mint and basil from my garden, and the salad was a big hit. Next time I think I will use yellow tomatoes for the color contrast.

Delicious! Who doesn't love this combo? The only changes I made was I used Boston lettuce and I added thinly sliced red onion. It was perfect w/ roasted lemon oregano chicken on a very hot summer evening.

I made this salad last night for a pot luck barbeque at my work today. I brought everything cut up and ready but separated and assembled the salad there. I was worried it might not do well overnight but everything was good and fresh. The only thing different was I had added cucumbers. It was a big hit such a good idea for an outdoor summer party. I had to increase the quantities as there were 45 people but it was quite a success. Will surely keep this recipe.

I tried both this recipe and the Watercress-Ginger one suggested below and 4 people agreed - this one is better :) The rice vinegar in the watercress salad was too sweet. But the feta/ watermelon/tomato combination was just perfect - with some toasted almonds to boot. Definite keeper! Agree that it makes a lot though - even half is plenty for a crowd.

This didn't work out as well for me -- though I had high hopes. I actually tried two watermelon salads this week. The better one was was the watermelon-watercress salad with ginger (I was worried but it was surprisingly good!: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Watermelon-and-Watercress-Salad-with-Ginger-106624

This makes a lot. I served at a dinner party for 8 people who loved it, but only about 1/2 got eaten. It was such a good salad - perfectly set off a mediterranean chicken dish with salty olives and capers. Could have stood to drain the watermelon/tomato mixture first - it got SOOO watery by the end of the meal.

Will definitely make again this season

Really simple and delicious. Didn't cook it exactly as directed but still very happy with the results. There is just something about the combination of watermelon, feta and black pepper that is quite amazing.

This was delicious and not as difficult as I thought. I substituted blood orange vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I also cooked the almonds in a pan in the olive oil and then used the oil in the dressing. Everyone love it. A great summer recipe!

Beautiful, tastes wonderful and fresh. A very simple impressive salad. I halved the recipe and it served 6-8. The original servings are for more like 10-15.

THIS is the salad I've been looking for. I had heard so much about this combination and had not been able to find a version that I thought was special till now. This is it--can't wait to make it again.

This was fresh, simple and delicious--and my SO loved it so much he wanted it again the next day! I used seedless watermelon, yellow tomatoes, feta, parsley and orange mint from the garden. Tossed all together and the whole bowl disappeared! Make sure the tomatoes are really ripe. Second day I didn't have much feta left so added sun-dried black olives to it which were also great. An unusual dish I'll definitely be making again and again this summer.

Fresh and delicious. The combination of flavors is great . . . I did use more fresh herbs than the recipe calls for. It was a big hit. The toasted almonds added a great crunch to the recipe. I drained a lot of watermelon juice off before I mixed all of the ingredients and I'm glad I did - it would have been too watery. Will make again, especially during the hot summer months.

I made this exactly as is except I tossed the arugula in with the melon and tomatoes for convenience as I was bringing to a picnic at the beach. This was different and delicious. Forgot to add toasted almonds but will not make that mistake again because the added crunch would only enhance. I also used good quality olive. Will be making again this weekend for Mother's Day!!

This salad was amazing. I found that I needed to use more herbs than the recipe calls for.

Nice mix. I am trying to move to slow food, and as fresh as possible, asper my dietician. This works as a main dish for me. Will miss it when the season is over.

This is a great salad! My husband and I could not believe how wonderful the flavors were. It is simple to prepare and delicious-- what could be better? I left out the almonds but follwed the recipe exactly while cutting it down for two. This is definitely going to be a company recipe for our next dinner party.

Made for a 4th of July party for which I was assigned vegetables. It was a big hit. For an excellent variation, try 3 T olive oil & 3 T lemon juice, rather than the vinegar/olive oil combo for the dressing!

Awesome! It sounds odd, but the flavours really mash together quite nicely! Fresh herbs make this, IMO. Will def make this a summer regular!

Wow! Fresh and fabulous, a great accompaniment to a grilled dinner on a hot day. I'm not a big fan of watermelon by itself, but thought I'd try this based on the great reviews and I was not disappointed. Definitely use yellow fruit for either the melon or tomatoes for a prettier presentation, though all red tastes just fine. Used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. Will be part of my regular summer rotation.

This salad is absolutely surprising and amazing. I made this first for myself and my boyfriend, and he was amazed at how good it was. I then made it for a dinner party and one of the guests mentioned that she was a little confused when she saw me mixing tomatoes and watermelon, but everyone loved it. Definitely drain the watermelon and tomatoes before tossing with everything, they will sweat a lot and the salad can quickly turn into soup. Also be sparing with the almonds, they are a nice surprise when you don't let them overtake the combination of flavors.

Great combination of flavors, tomatoes and watermelon may sound like a weird combination but I encourage you to try it. I'm looking forward to making it again in the summer.

Made this for a dinner party last night and forgot the feta (!) but it was still delicious! I loved the contrast between the sweet watermelon and the arugula. I will definitely make this again--maybe this week for lunch.

I made this for a 4th of July party and everyone loved it. I left out the feta since my boyfriend is not a fan of white cheese for whatever reason. It was delicious without! The toasted almonds are a must.

I made this last year from my Bon Appetite magazine and everyone loved it. Very simple, elegant and a great way to highlight summer flavors. I think I poured off the liquid after the salting. Now that tomatoes are in season, I'm excited to be making this again!

This salad was a fantastic way to highlight two of the farmers' market's most prolific late-August offerings. I used red seedless watermelon and yellow tomatoes - very pretty. After salting the main ingredients I drained them before mixing in the oil and vinegar, which was a good idea since the salad sweated a lot more before I served it.

I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand when I saw this recipe in my Bon Appetit and decided to give it a try. It was fabulous! I used a pineapple sage which complimented the watermelon beautifully, cherry tomatoes from my garden and Sunkist Almond Accents, Butter Toffee Glazed flavor (because that's what I had on hand). My husband and I liked it so much I made it again the next day with the rest of the watermelon!

Hmmm...This is very similar to a watermelon salad recipe I got from a friend last summer...I don't know how I feel about the addition of tomatoes though. Just the watermelon, red onion, feta, olive oil, vinegar and fresh herb of choice (either mint or cilantro depending on the mood) seem enough. I like almonds, though. I'll add those next time for crunch. I highly suggest trying this without the tomatoes and I secon the other reviewer's reccomendation regarding the addition of salt: hold it till the last possible second or let your guests do it themselves!

Haven't made this yet, but just wanted to write about another watermelon recipe I had recently. It had only three ingredients and it was delicious. Watermelon, feta, and fresh cracked pepper. Can't be easier!

This was absolutely fantastic, especially now with all the fresh tomatoes and melon that are in season. We're having it once a week it's so good.

This was fantastic! I used fresh basil and mint as my herbs - what a combination with the watermelon & tomato! So great, everyone asked for it again the next day.

What an interesting combination of flavors! I was definately intrigued by the idea and made this as a starter for a bbq chicken dinner. Added yellow heirloom tomates to create interest. I agree with the other cook--let your guests add their own salt. The watermelon and tomates could certainly use it. The arugula adds a nice spicy bite. This salad is good, but I'm not sure if I'd make it again unless I need to use up a the rest of a watermelon. Rather interesting though and worth a try.

I was very intrigued by this dish, and we just happened to have some extra tomatoes and feta, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It went totally beyond my expectations. It's very fresh and juicy and a perfect accompaniment to a grilled meat (in our case, grilled mojito-marinated chicken breasts). Just one tip though: **do not** salt the tomatoes and watermelon as indicated in the recipe. It released the juices and the salad was swimming even before we served it. Let everyone add some fleur de sel after serving. I also chopped the arugula and added it to the salad. Give it a try - you'll be very surprised at how good it is!
