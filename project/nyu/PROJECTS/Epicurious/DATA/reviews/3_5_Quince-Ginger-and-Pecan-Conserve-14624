Really good. I didn't have quite enough quince so supplemented with some apple. Also substituted hazelnuts for the pecans. It's delicious. Next time I will add the coriander and bump up the ginger and mustard a little bit.

I have made multiple batches of this conserve for years, serving it and giving it as gifts from Thanksgiving through January. Everyone loves it made exactly as written, served with cheeses. This year, the quince crop was small and I missed its short season at the local farmers market. I am thinking of trying it with unripe pears, maybe adjusting the flavors a bit. Next year, I'll buy early!

After making Quince Jelly all day, I decided this recipe sounded like a perfect way to use the strained Quince left from the Jelly. I used Apple Cider Vinegar in place of the w. wine vinegar and added gr. coriander as another reviewer suggested. I have canned it in jars and will add it to our Christmas baskets this year. The nuts added a wonderful flavour. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I grew up eating "dulce de membrillo" both on toast at breakfast and paired with cheese for dessert. I was delighted to find quince (membrillo) at my local market and tried this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. I put it in small pots and canned them to give as gifts. I will pair it with manchego cheese which comes from the Mancha region of Spain. Since it is a sheep cheese, it can be substituted with pecorino, the Italian sheep cheese. The conserve alone pairs well with fowl.

I grew up eating "dulce de membrillo" which is the clasic quince paste found in Spain and Latin American countries. Eaten as dessert it was always paired with cheese. Manchego, which originates in the the La Mancha region of Spain, famous for the fictional character Don Quijote (de la Mancha), is the natural partner for this conserve. Excellent also with fowl. I definitely would make it again. I canned it and am giving it as gifts.

Delicious! I canned mine in cute little 4 ounce jars and ate some as an accompaniment to sauted turkey breast. The only thing I changed was the addition of coriander seeds. My partner and I both loved it!

I already have made it again. I used only 1 cup of sugar, and it was sweet enough for everyone. Great with fresh goat cheese.

Quite delicous! A little too much liquid; you might be able to reduce the water by about a cup or two. I made a double recipe and have put it up in jars for gifts. Consider using it in a cheese course -- it's delicious with blue cheese or any other strongly flavored cheese.
