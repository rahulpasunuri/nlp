Can't give it four forks unless you sub walnuts for the pecans (I find pecans too sweet; you need the walnuts to offset all that sugar) and add butterscotch chips (equal amount to chocolate chips). Then you have perfection.

EXCELLENT!!! Very easy and so delicious! I used a mix of nuts (walnut, pecan and almond) and everyone enjoyed them!

These bars are really easy to make and so yummy. They are rich, so I cut them into smaller squares. Next time I make them, I will add a little sugar (1/4 cup?) so that the graham cracker crust holds together better. It was sort of crumbly.

I mean these are just so freakin' good. I used unsweetened coconut, bittersweet chocolate, almonds instead of pecans and rather than condensed milk, I took a can of coconut milk, added about a quarter cup of sugar and reduced it by about a quarter. It worked beautifully and the sweetness level was perfect.

These bars are heavenly. How can you go wrong with graham crackers, butter, chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk and pecans? We couldn't wait for them to completely cool, so the chocolate was still gooey. Yum.

I just made these for a cookie exchange, and they're delicious. If you like nuts, coconut, and chocolateyou won't be disappointed. Very easy to make.
