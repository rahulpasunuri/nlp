Great tasting and easy. I agree with the reviewer that said it's a hybrid between a Caeser Salad and a Wedge Salad with Creamy Bleu Cheese Dressing. Will become one of our favorites and it goes great with a good steak

The perfect salad with a steak when you are torn between choosing a wedge with blue cheese or a caesar.

Used my mini-Cuisinart to blend ingredients and just added 1/2 c. blue cheese before processing (which made it a kind of creepy mint green) and crumbled a bit more on top. We grilled our romaine -- brushed w/ a bit of olive oil, then sprinkled w/ a bit of sea salt -- and next time will do some caramelized onions or shallots for the top. It's a great dressing and super easy.

I love the dressing on spring mix and other greens. I will make this dressing again and again.

I make this dressing with half the blue cheese and we love it, as does any guest who has tried it. I keep it on hand, as it's our favorite.

This is probably the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. I tried it because I wanted something lighter and less fattening than the creamy version. I served it tonight over an iceberg wedge with roma tomatoes and chopped bacon. It was a huge hit. Our guests raved and my husband loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for friends and we all LOVED the vinaigrette. A very simple salad with a lot of great flavor.

Made for a special dinner party (to go with short ribs provencale with creme fraiche mashed potatoes and Parmesan-Blue Cheese Toasts with Green Onions, both from this site). Since the short ribs were time-consuming, having this simple, yet elegant salad was fantastic. Used gorgonzola instead of Maytag blue cheese. Hubbie not a fan of blue cheese/gorgonzola flavors or anchovies, but loved this salad.

Wonderful Salad! Everyone enjoyed it very much at last nights dinner party. I didn't use as much blue cheese as recipe called for though, otherwise I made exactly as directed. Loved the dressing!

Great and easy. I've made this several times and I've always been pleased. I used a pear-white balsamic vinegar a couple of times, and a white wine vinegar other times. You can easily play with this recipe, adding homemade croutons, or grape tomatoes, or... Final thought- don't omit the anchovy, in my opinion.

I've made this many times, both for company and a quick salad for weeknights. I usually add chopped tomato over the top and it's very pretty and delicious.

This was good! I halved it to serve two, and there was still plenty of dressing left over. I used regular balsamic instead of white and while it probably wasn't as pretty, it tasted good. The picky boyfriend loved it, so I will definitely make it again.

This dressing is yum-a-licious! The anchovy paste adds a wonderful depth of flavor. Even if you think you won't like anchovies, try it. It doesn't scream "fishy" - just garlicky and rich. It's perfect with the blue cheese.

Good stuff! Added just a splash more white balsamic than called for. To hdjazz from Lodi. You can use the anchovy paste in a classic caesar. I also use it when making dressing for Nicoisse (spelling?) salad. Also, check out the recipe for Provencal chicken breasts on this website, it calls for anchovy paste.Oh, another great one on this website...Turkey cutlets in Anchovy Butter Sauce (I use chicken breasts) But it is sooo good! I hate anchovies by themselves, but love to add it to other dishes..really gives an interest depth of flavor without knowing what it is.

This is really good! I used Maytag blue cheese which I would suggest also. Similar to a Caesar dressing but much quicker.

To the woman with the onion problem - if you are just looking for a little color, how about some thin strips of red cabbage?

Sounds simple, yet elegant. Question: What else can you use anchovy paste for?

Rating: 0
My husband can't eat raw onion. Would anything else do?

For just the 2 of us I halved this recipe except for the garlic which I still used 1 large clove. Very tasty.

I tried it with Gorgonzola and it was awesome.

Delicious, easy and impressive dressing. Not all that novel; but tasty and pretty. A couple of notes: I added a little extra anchovy as I felt it needed the balance. Also (and I can't believe the day has come where I would say these words...) I used a little less blue cheese. Since I doubled the recipe it would have called for 8 oz. This was way too much. I put in about 6oz. Enjoy!

A question to those who have tried this recipe: would gorgonzola be a good substitute?

Rating: 4
This was excellent. For those who don't like anchovies, you really don't taste them in this anymore than you taste them in a Caesar Salad Dressing.

I don't eat anchovies and would probably substitute with finely chopped capers.

This was perfect. I used a little less oil, maybe half the amount called for, and it was still really good. Very tangy, and I am not a huge blue cheese person, but even that was great.

I am not a fan of anchovies. What would be a good substitution?

This was easy and so delicious. Such a refreshing departure from the traditional thick, mayonnaise-laden version. I didn't use Maytag, just the ordinary crumbled blue cheese in the plastic container, and it was wonderful. It will be the only blue cheese dressing I make from now on!

This was quite delicious and easy to make. i used less oil and vinegar as blue cheese is so flavorful you don't need as much of the liquid. i used dressing for a few more days on other greens and it was equally delicious.
