Like many other reviewers, I followed the advice of Bay Harbor Island and sauteed instead of baking. I think next time I will add some white wine to the sauce to make it a little "saucier". Served with the fingerling potato "coins" and a salad. Yummy!

Thanks to the cook from Bay Harbor Island, this was a delicious dinner loved by all. Sauteing instead of baking is the way to go. I used dill instead of parsley and served the fish with dill-sour cream smashed potatoes and the Andrew Weil Brussels sprout recipe. Yum.

Here's my low-rent version of this recipe: I had some lousy old lemons in the fridge that didn't yield any good zest, so instead I used a lot of lemon pepper. Had no parsley so I used a little dried thyme. Had no shallot so I minced a bit of white onion instead. Otherwise made recipe according to instructions. And the dish turned out . . . great! So, this is a good recipe for a beginning cook, because you can substitute with impunity. Also, I had the idea to saute sliced zucchini in some of the butter/onion sauce while the fish was baking. That didn't work out so well. The tastes didn't go together. Probably asparagus would have been better.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was tasty but I did feel it would be even better if the fish was sautéed rather than baked and then the sauce made in the pan after. The next time I will do it this way. With baking much of the sauce evaporated and the parsley got crispy on top of the fish.

Followed the modifications of the cook from Bay Harbor Islands and produced a simple, pleasant meal. No great shakes....

I loved this easy to prepare dish although I did not include the lemon pulp.

Zowie! Such an easy way to make an elegant dish. Thanks to Bay Harbor Islands for the alternative prep. Loved it - even though I did overcook the fish as my potholder caught fire and distracted me! Served with braised leeks and bok choy - it's a keeper!

Perfectly pleasant, but I think I agree with the previous reviewer that sauting the fish would make it more flavorful. I'll make it again, but I'll do it that way next time.

If you are a purist who does not think a recipe can be modified and still rated on this website,then please avert your eyes. These modifications are not for you. After too much of my Mom's awesome Thanksgiving dinner and the leftovers, I vowed to include more servings of fish in my diet. I spotted this recipe and picked up on the reviews and decided to make some changes. I prepared the butter/shallot mixture as directed. Poured it into a bowl, then I added the lemon juice and the capers and omitted the pulp, but I did add a little zest. I sauteed the snapper in the same pan (as I am not a big fan of baked snapper), with a non-stick pan there is no need to add any additional oil. After turning the snapper, I waited until it was almost done and added the lemon juice/shallot/butter mixture, then sprinkled it with parsley and cooked it through. I served the fish with sauteed baby zucchini. Folks, this was finger licking good. This recipe is a keeper. The snapper is delicate and the lemon juice with the capers gives it an interesting zing. Also, this recipe is fast and can easily be prepared after work without too much stress.

Nice, and rather simple. I'll make it again simply because it's simple and easy; a good weekday meal.

This was a wonderful dish. My husband thought it light and tasty. I loved the capers. I didn't find that the pulp added that much. Next time I may omit it. But there will definitely be a next time...

The dish was easy to make and tasted wonderful. It truly compliments the lightness of the snapper. The crushed capers add terrific flavor. We have filed this little treasure in our recipe box.

This is a fantastic "after work" recipe....I made a few small changes...first I used snapper filets which worked out fine. Then I used cilantro instead of parsely and finally, to cut down on the fat I used a very small amount of butter and when it was brown I added some olive oil to it. I browned the fish in the pan and put sauce on it before serving...yummy!!!
