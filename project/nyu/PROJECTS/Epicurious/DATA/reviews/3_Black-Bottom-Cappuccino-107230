I have made this recipe twice and had no problem either time with the caramel layer. My guests loved it. In addition, I made a diabetic-friendly version using sugar free puddings(chocolate and butterscotch)for my diabetic husband so he wouldn't feel left out. Obviously, the rest of us had the better dessert, but everyone was happy. I'm always happy to find a recipe that can be made in advance, and this one fit the bill.

I have made this several times with excellent results. It is a favorite. Despite what other reviewers said I had no problems with getting the puddings to set. I've made a lot of custards and puddings so it was nothing difficult in preparation.

My caramel layer failed to set as well, so i served it as creme caramel. I would like to see some testing of these recipes by the editors of the magazines.

I have not made this recipe but can tell you the missing step is after the egg yolks are tempered it must go back and cook until sligtly thickened, over medium low heat, bring it up slowly, just as if you are making an ice cream mixture or creme brulee. Only then will you solve the problem of the soup like consistency.

The first time I made this, it was just fabulous. A girlfriend commented at the time that she'd been leery of trying it, in light of the comments on this site (which I, blissfully ignorant, hadn't seen). Thinking I had the recipe figured out, I made it a second time for a very nice dinner party, and it was a disaster--caramel soup. I tried to freeze the things, and ended up praying no one noticed how utterly weird the concoction was. I did use slightly larger eggs the second time, but everything else was the same. I would never try this recipe for guests again--I'd be a nervous wreck wondering whether it would set. Who need such an unreliable recipe? I'm surprised Gourmet wouldn't have issued a warning--or at the very least, a cautionary note.

I had the same problem: the caramel layer would not set. It ended up being a mess of runny goop with lumps of cornstarch.

I tried using only egg yolks but the custard did not set. I did like the taste so I'll experiment with proportions.

Fantastically decadent! I only used egg yolks to set the custard and I had no issues with it not setting. I made it for my visiting sister, her chocoholic husband and baby son. All tucked in no qualms! Plain whipped cream is necessary to cut the richness!

I was happy to see that there were others who had a hard time setting the carmel pudding. Following the directions, I ended up chilling carmel soup, so I put it back on the burner and cooked it until it thickened, it had to boil for several minutes while I was stirring it. The final product was fantastic. I just think there is a step missing in the recipe directions.

The flavors were great, but I had the same problem with the caramel pudding not setting. The pudding began to set when I added the cornstarch, but once the eggs were added it became runny. I also cooled the pudding with ice, but that didn't help. I think there is something wrong with this recipie.

Hey, I probably was in too much of a hurry, so it was probably my fault that the caramel pudding didn't set up at all even though I did the ice routine. It set up during the cornstarch stage, then I added the eggs and it got runny. But, it was very good, so I'll try it again soon.
