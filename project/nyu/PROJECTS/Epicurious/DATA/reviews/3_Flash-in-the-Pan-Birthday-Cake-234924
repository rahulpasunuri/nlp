A person needs a recipe for this? You can make a really delicious dessert in this manner, but I did expect more. For example: A store bought pound cake really cold in the freezer. Topped off a beautiful fruit compote composed of berries and a little simple syrup, perhaps some fine sugar sprinkled on top. To finish it, add whipped cream, or ice-cream. This recipe is no recipe at all.

This cake is really easy to make, and very good to eat, it has ice cream, chocolate and whipped cream, how can you go wrong. I did need more whipping cream to cover the cake.

We made this cake at the beach, where there wasn't a lot of equipment available for a scratch cake. Everyone got to help -- the kids each had a task. It was fun, beautiful, and delicious. The ice cream in particular went well after a hot day on the shore. The birthday guest of honor happened to be a health bar fanatic, so that was just the right touch. Since every ingredient was a comfort-food item, combined they made a special dessert. We think it will be a tradition now.
