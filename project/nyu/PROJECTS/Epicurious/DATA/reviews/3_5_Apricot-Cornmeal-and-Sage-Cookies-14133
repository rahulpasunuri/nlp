Gluten Free Version: Use same amt of flour but use gluten free Pamela's brand of baking and pancake mix. YUM and gluten free. Enjoy!

The flavor of these cookies is pretty great. However, the cornmeal does not cook and so toward the end of chewing them, you're left with grit. An unpleasant, crunchy grit. I ran them by my brother-in-law, who is a celebrated chef, and he agreed that it actually kind of hurt to eat them.

So delicious! I used a coarse salt, simply b/c thats what I had on hand and its actually pretty awesome, little sweet and salty bites.

These are really tasty (addictive, even!), and are always a crowd-pleaser due to their amazing flavor and unique ingredients. I would never have thought to put sage in cookies, but it is just perfect. I made the cookies exactly according to the recipe, though I'm usually generous on the sage and apricot. The most recent time, they were done cooking before 10 minutes, so do watch for the bottoms burning as you bake.

These cookies got two thumbs up from my co-workers and all of the women in my herb class. Really easy to make and delicious results. Would definitely make them again.

I'm pretty shocked that this recipe isn't the full 4 forks, 100% would make again. It has to be a personal taste thing, because this is a perfect recipe. The combination of flavors makes your head spin and the texture is amazing. Cookies were a little larger than I wanted (they spread quite a bit) so next time I'll make them smaller. They'll probably get a little more crispy on the outside to go with the mealy (in a good way) chewy on the inside.

My all time favorite cookie recipe. It's not for everyone but I love the unique combination of flavors and the texture of these cookies.

I took the liberty of adapting this recipe for our gluten-free household. I used 1 cup of Bette Hagman's 4 Flour Bean Mix, decreased the sage to 1 tablespoon to suit my husband's taste and chilled dough after scooping as GF cookies are notorious for spreading out thin while baking. Baked for 12 minutes - delicious!

I'll admit - sage in cookies is not a taste everyone loves, but these are the perfect blend of savory and sweet. I add more apricots, a tablespoon (or 2) more sugar, and really measure the sage so it's not overpowering. So good!

I used this recipe recently in serving a large vegetarian meal. It was highly praised...however, I believe I used a tad bit more butter than recipe called for and I did not care for the greasy effect ithad as a result. I will use exact measurement in future....flavor is absolutely amazing and a wonderful surprise to those unaware of the sage.

My all time favorite cookie. But I've made them for guests a few times and not everyone loves them.

YUM YUM YUM! Really good cookies. So different! Made a batch for Mother's Day and everyone loved them. Had a nice savory taste. Per other reviewers I put the dough out by the teaspoon and they still spread quite a bit. I would also add more apricots next time. I can't wait to try the cherry/mint suggested below.

Great and different ! Made them for a girls weekend and they all went. Makes way more than 18 cookies.

This is a unique and wonderful recipe. Savory and light. I would increase the apricot in the future to atleast 1/3 cup if not more. Also, allow the flavors to mellow for a day or two before eating them, as they'll be much more pleasant. As such, they store excellently.

This recipe is flawless--but I always like to play...so, instead of cornmeal I substitute Masa Harina (Mexican corn flour used to make tamales. I lightly toast it in the oven and then added toasted and salted 'pepitas' (pumpkin seeds---found in bulk bins at whole food stores). The combination of this with the sage and apricots was sensational! Also, adding a bit of orange zest to this adds quite a nice sparkle. Everyone turned their noses up at first when I served these, but moments later the platter was bare--the disappointment was that there was not one crumb left!

Very odd, but not bad per se. Perhaps I jsut have to get used to sage in cookies... or not. There is a better recipe I suggest 'cornmeal cookie sundaes with warm fruit', minus the sundae and warm fruit (which I've never tried. These cookies have a great taste and crunch.

This was really great, and got rave reviews when I made it recently for friends. I made 3 dozen (smaller) cookies with this recipe, rather than the 18 that the recipe suggests...they were the prefect size.

Disappointing. My partner likes sage, and we used our fresh sage from the garden, but the combination of sage, apricot, and gritty corn meal made for an odd cookie. The taste was intriguing, but most of our guests didn't seem to want more than a bite or so. Maybe it would be better to make these as tiny button cookies.

I have made these over and over and over and over. My very favourite cookie.

Well...sage plus cookie equals what I was afraid of getting: an herb cookie that might be sold at a Shaker Village snackbar. HOWEVER, the basic cookie with the cornmeal and apricot is delicious; next time I'm losing the sage and substituting either poppy seeds, or grated orange rind or coconut and keeping everything else. Baking note: the finished cookie spread so that the edges ran into its neighbors. Next time I'll spread smaller spoonfuls farther apart than 1". You might love the sage flavor, so enjoy, as long as you know it doesn't get muted in the baking. Post script: Later that night....every guest loved them as is.

I've made this for two different holiday gatherings. The first batch was good, but I decided to add white chocolate chips to the second batch. They're the best!

When I first saw this recipe, my reaction was "yuck!". I saved it because the reviews were so good. There's a good reason for that- they're delicious!! Even my kids ate them.

Great cookie!! I was a little skepical at first but they turned out wonderful. Make'em and enjoy.

By far and away the best cookie I've ever tasted! They're something pleasantly unexpected--not the sort of thing you would make for a comforting cookies-and-milk moment--but exquisite in taste and texture. Fresh sage is essential, as dried would probably give them a stale flavor. The texture is chewy and lacy all at once.

Excellent slightly sweet and salty cookies. Rubbing the sage and sugar together with your fingers gets the most out of the herb flavor.

I made this recipe during a cooking class on cookies and it was great. The instructor suggested a variation which I've tried since & loved -- use mint instead the sage and dried cherries instead of the apricots.

I highly recommend this cookie. The interesting tastes and texture make this cookie delicious. If you like this cookie, you should also try Lauren's Spice Cookies (also on Epicurious).

I wouldn't recommend these cookies to my worst enemy! They sounded intriguing so I tried them. Not Good! I didn't have fresh sage on hand, however, perhaps they would have been better with the fresh herb?

The combination does sound strange but these are really good. They have an unusual but interesting taste and texture and are not too sweet. I've used both fresh and dried sage and didn't notice that much difference between them in terms of taste.

This is such a great recipe! I needed to make something for my herb group and decided on this one because it sounded so unusual. Everyone, including myself, loved the unique and wonderful flavor and texture of this cookie. It's definitely a keeper!

These cookies are sweet, chewy and delicious. I am sorry to say I ate them for dinner several times, but they were so good I couldn't help myself! Make sure you use fresh sage, as it is a critical ingredient in the cookie (don't be thrown off by this herb, it really gives the cookies a wonderful flavor).

I did not have fresh sage so I used 1 tsp. of dry. The flavor was still very good.

This is an absolutely GREAT recipe. Since I'm vegan I substituted margarine and egg replacer for the eggs. Though the batter seemed a little dry, it worked out perfectly. If you're worried about it, a teaspoon of liquid (I used soy creamer) does the trick. Delicate, but addictive flavor. The group I made it for loved them more than the other snacks we'd gotten from a professional!

Outstanding! Very interesting and complex flavor. I used white cornmeal so the apriots and sage were very visible, giving the cookie an interesting look. Chewy, crunchy, sweet, savory...very, very good.

Tasty, fresh and interesting! These cookies could be well complemented by a glass of crisp white wine. But they're also great as a plain old afternoon snack. This is a brilliant recipe!
