We have been making these for years, they are THE family favorite. I always use a food processor and chop the almonds as fine as possible (until they start to clump together). Add a few drops of almond extract, and flatten slightly with a wet finger. Have never had problems with greasiness. We make at least a triple batch every time, and they disappear fast! They can easily be made gluten free, too, just sub rice flour for the tablespoon of wheat flour, you can't tell the difference.

these suck! they're not even crisp. they're floppy little things, not lace cookies. what the hell?

These looked pretty and tasted good, but other than that I'd call them inedible -- I intended to take them to a dinner party, but how can you serve something that leaves your hands coated in butter? WAY too buttery. I even cut the butter down to one stick like another reviewer suggested, but they were slick w/ butter, even after cooled. I wouldn't serve.

The 1st batch came out too dry for actual batter. I even used less butter which I would recommend for anyone who decides to make these. One thing I did do differently for the 2nd batch was I mixed all the ingredients (except for the egg, that should still go last) right after the butter was melted and still hot. This seemed to thicken the batter and gave me more to work with. I doubt I will make these again. They did come out a bit sticky...I think I was expecting something a bit more extravagant.

Really delicious flavor, light and crispy flavor. For my 2nd batch I will use 1 tsp of batter instead of 1 tbsp which produced enormous cookies. I would also decrease baking time because they came out too dark.

After reading the reviews I changed a few things.I decreased the butter to 1 stick (1/2 cup) and I increased the flour to 1/4 cup. I baked them for 12 minutes on parchment paper on a stoneware pan in the middle of the oven. They were perfect and didn't waste so much butter.

these were okay. You can do with just 1-1.25 sticks of butter. If you use salted butter then add about 1-2 tablespoons more sugar, and sprinkle additional sugar over each circle if dough before baking. I used a Silpat silicone sheet, as well as parchment paper and a no-name brand silicone sheet. I found the Silpat to be the only one to consistently produce round lacies. Use double thick/insulated cookie sheets for best, no-burn results. Make sure to bake until lacies are dark tan/ light brown (13 min with Silpat and insulated cookie sheet). Teaspoon size dough rounds are more than enough, and a quarter-sized dough 1/4 inch thick produced a cookie about 3 inches in diameter. Didn't taste orange flavor, but I am happy with this as I was wary of putting it in overall. Don't think I will make these again....

I love the short list of ingredients needed for this recipe. After a few trials and errors with this recipe, here are some recommendations: 1) use a little less butter 2) Add 2 1/2 tsp of orange 3) When placing the batter on the baking sheet, flatten out the batter to a disk for more even baking 4) 15 minutes of baking is too long! Start at 8 minutes and work from there.

I've made this recipe so many times I finally thought I should add a review. I love these cookies. They are ridiculously easy and seem rather fancy to the non-baker. They are sooo good and there's hardly any mess involved. I make them as thank you gifts.

Rating: 3
These cookies are delicious, especially when painted with chocolate as other reviewers have recommended. The baking time did take some tinkering for me (5-6 min seemed best to keep them from burning), and actually making sure the batter is *warm* will keep the cookies from spreading out too much. I wasn't thinking and used wax paper instead of parchment for the first batch: huge mistake,as the paper becomes welded to the back of the cookies! Since there's so much butter in the recipe, however, I had no problem removing the cookies directly from nonstick baking sheets.

These are my dad's favorite! They are so easy and so delicious... everyone loves them. Double or triple the recipe... these will go fast!

I thought this cookie was super delicious. I didn't have as many almonds as I thought I did, so I just made 1/3 of the recipe and it was just fine. Really easy to make and I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 2
These were a pain and the result wasn't worth the effort. They tasted okay. They managed to break into pieces and spread out drastically even though I kept the dough cool until I baked them! You'll need more than 3" between cookies! I would suggest crumbling them into bits and putting them on ice cream rather than treating them as a cookie. I won't attempt this recipe again.

I make these every Christmas and send out as gifts. I paint the back of the cookies with dark chocolate for some extra zing.

These cookies are SO yummy...I made them as one of my many Christmas cookies this year, and I already had an orange-flavored cookie, so I substituted lemon zest...so tasty. I only added the egg white too, to make these cookies a bit more delicate but still sturdy enough to not drive me crazy. "Generous tablespoons" of batter to make the cookies are WAY too much. 1/2 a tablespoon makes a good sized cookie. These would make GREAT gifts...double the recipe!

Rating: 1
These warrant an "okay" from me. The orange was very mild, and the caramelized sugar ran far past the edges of the almond spread. I would not make this recipe again, but still have an appreciation for this style of cookie. The cookies did not spread uniformly and would not look good when set out for guests. Some of the caramelly base made long projections from these cookies.

Rating: 4
I made these wonderful (addicting!) cookies to give out as Christmas hostess gifts. I doubled the recipe and made just over 100 2.5" diameter cookies. I used teaspoons to drop the batter onto the sheets but as others have mentioned, they spread quite a bit so make. sure you space them well on the cookie sheet.

These were so quick and easy! Everybody loved them. We gave these as gifts to our neighbors last christmas and are being asked for them again. You will definately be making more than a single batch of these. Enjoy!

I made these in 2007 for the holiday season and they were loved by everyone. They are so light and people kept coming back for more. They are easy to make and made great teacher's gifts. I tried dipping them in melted chocolate like someone else mentioned. Great combination of flavors.

Easy to make and taste great! I used orange zest, one teas of almond ext and ground up the almonds. Let the mixture sit for a minute before putting on bake sheet. After cooled, I drizzled a little melted dark choc over cookies.

A really lovely cookie recipe. Mine turned out perfectly. Make sure to use the parchment paper.

These are so easy to make and are so yummy. They spread out a lot during baking. Next time I am going to make them much smaller. They are very greasy when done cooking, so make sure to keep them on a few paper towels for awhile to absorb all the grease. I also used fresh orange zest instead of orange peel and it worked great.

Rating: 4
Easy, beautiful and quite excellent! Chop the almonds finely with a mini- prep and drop the dough quite far apart as they definitly spread. Made these for Christmas as an alternative to the chocolaty desserts and they were so delicious and chewy.

Raves from everyone who tried it. I didn't have any oranges, so I used Clementine rind, and it was delicious.

I make these for the holidays and now get specific requests from friends. They are the easiest and most elegant cookie in my repetoire. Dipping or drizzling these with melted dark chocolate takes them up a big notch, but they're great either way.

These are so delicious! Definitely a more dainty cookie...something to serve the ladies with their coffee. I'm including them in boxes of cookies for Valentine's day. Very easy to make. Definitely put the almonds in a mini chopper to make them very fine.

Very tasty cookie. I made them by dropping tsps, rather than Tbsps. They were the perfect size this way. I also melted some chocolate chips and piped them onto the cookies. These were impressive to the eye and the stomach! I would certainly make these again.

I have an update on the extra butter issue. I made them a 2nd time about 3/4 of the butter they requested & it didn't turn out. They didn't lace & the texture was off - I feel the butter is needed. I put the cookies on parchment paper & them towl the extra butter off before putting them in the freezer to set.

This is scrumptious, it really is. I took the entire batch for 6 people and they were gobbled up. Two people said they were the very best cookies they've ever had. I made them in the size the recipe suggested & to me they were large but it didn't matter! I also melted semi-sweet chocolate and spooned it in between two cookies and they were incredible. They are very very buttery, I will try to make them with a little less next time. The butter does not comprimise the taste, so make as suggested above first and then adjust to your taste the 2nd time - there will be a 2nd time! Can't wait to try this recipe with lime.

This is my second time to make these cookies and although I forgot to include the flour, they turned out great. They make great Christmas treats!

Entirely too greasey for me. The recipe was easy enough, but calls for wayy too much butter. I too, painted the bottoms with semi-sweet melting chocolate. Probably won't make these again. These are similar to what I remember as a kid, but those were less grease & more flavor. The only thing I taste in these cookies are the butter.

Rating: 4
THESE COOKIES ARE GREAT AND RELATIVELY EASY. EVERYONE LOVES 'EM! HERE ARE THE ADJUSTMENTS I HAVE MADE: I DROP BY HEAPING TEASPOONS; 6 COOKIES PER SHEET. I USE 2 BAKING SHEETS AT A TIME, ON RACKS IN THE TOP AND MIDDLE THIRD OF THE OVEN. I BAKE FOR 17-18 MINUTES EXCHANGING POSITIONS OF THE BAKING SHEETS AFTER 9 MINUTES. I RE-USE THE PARCHMENT FOR EACH BATCH BY JUST WIPING OFF THE GREASE FROM THE PARCHMENT WITH A PAPER TOWEL. (PARCHMENT IS TOO PRICEY TO USE CLEAN SHEETS FOR EACH BATCH!) AFTER COOKIES ARE COOL I MELT TWO CUPS OF SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN THE MICROWAVE ON 50% POWER UNTIL CHIPS ARE COMPLETELY MELTED. THEN I DIP 1/2 OF THE COOKIE IN THE MELTED CHOCOLATE AND PLACE THEM ON THE SAME PARCHMENT PAPER (WIPED CLEAN AGAIN WITH A PAPER TOWEL) UNTIL CHOCOLATE HARDENS. YUMMY!!!!!

When we lived in Paris we bought a cookie similar to this, but it had bittersweet chocolate on the bottom. I made this recipe [agree with other reviewers that the size is too large] and then simply melted bittersweet chocolate and painted the bottoms of the cookies after they cooled. I put them in the fridge to set and they were even better, if that's possible, than the plain version

These cookies were so yummy I was shocked. I didn't think they were going to be as good as they are because they really are easy but I agree with the other reviewers; make them smaller than the recipe otherwise they are just huge.

Good-tasting but not popular at parties because they don't look as delicious as some of the other cookies. It's also tricky to time the baking--they burn easily. Always spoon batter onto cooled cookie sheets.

These cookies have become a family tradition. My eight yr old daughter just helped make a double batch. Yes, it is quite a bit of butter, but wow, what a great tasting delicate cookie!

This receipe was easy to make, but I wasn't happy with the results. The cookies turned out too big and there was so much butter that the paper towels were soaked. Seeing all that butter doesn't make me want to use this receipe again. The individuals that tried the cookies said that they were tasty. I thought the cookies were too chewy for my taste.

I have previously reviewed this wonderful cookie recipe but wanted to add you can double the recipe. It helps to have a double oven so you can have cookies on parchment ready to go in the oven since there is such a long baking time. I definitely agreed with the other reviewers that a teaspoon size cookie is better and that you need to bake the cookie long enough for them to be crunchy.

These were easy and delicious with a nutty-orange flavor. They spread more than I expected and I only got 20 cookies out of it. Does anyone know if you can double or triple the recipe? (That's how much we loved this cookie!)

Wonderful flavor. Make sure you cook them long enough to get crunchy and lacey-looking. I also think that dropping "one large Tbl of batter" is too much batter. Smaller cookies are much better and cook faster.

Simply irresistable! Try using my variation with finely chopped almonds and no orange. Then I sandwiched the lace cookies with whipped cream or creamed butter with some condensed milk and brandy. My family thought they came from a well-known local bakery!!

A friend recommended this to me and I was a little disappointed. A tablespoon of batter makes the cookies too large for my taste and for even cooking, and they emit so much butter the towels were soaked! Overall great taste and easy to make - but...

These cookies were great--if you like the taste of orange. I took them to my brother and sister-in-law's last night and my brother, who's not an orange fan, didn't like them, while my sister-in-law, who is, loved them. The almonds definitely made the recipe. Next time I'd probably add another 1/2 cup. I might also try making some without the orange zest. Be sure not to use any more butter than the recipe calls for--they're very buttery.

This was a very good cookie and much less fragile than the typical lace one. I do hope, however, that everyone knows that 3/4 cup butter is 1 1/2 sticks butter and not 1/2.

Excellent taste. Soft, chewy and a hint of orange. The dough will run while cooking so make small and allow plenty of space. Freeze well.
