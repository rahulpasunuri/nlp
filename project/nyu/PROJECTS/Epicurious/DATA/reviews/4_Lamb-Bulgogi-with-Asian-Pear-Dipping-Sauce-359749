Excellent! Made with chicken. Recommend making 1/4 of the dipping sauces - there was lots of leftover sauce.

I made this recipe for my Taiwanese boyfriend and his siblings who just came into town. They all raved about the dish going back for more! There was a fight over the small amount of leftovers the next day. Although the meat isn't really a bulgogi so much as a roast, the flavor was exceptional. The dipping sauce was really yummy and went very well with the lamb as well as a pork dish that I made the next day! We served over white rice (of course) with all the typical Korean condiments sans kimchi because I really didn't want my house to stink. I highly recommend trying out this recipe. You won't be disappointed with the succulent meat and delicious flavors!

Agreed, this recipe is a total winner. Wonderful contrast of flavors between the marinade and the dipping sauce. Next time I'd get two heads of butter lettuce; we burned through the first head quickly with lots of lamb and veggies left over. Fun to prepare, and a true crowd- pleaser!

Great recipe! My husband loved it. My family makes beef bulgogi all the time, so I was excited to try something a little different. It has a perfect amount of sweet and saltiness. Never used mirin before, but it definitely adds to the flavor. The dipping sauce was to die for! Added a tiny bit more pear for the extra fruitiness. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing with the sauce. The lamb marinade would also taste good with thinly sliced beef.
