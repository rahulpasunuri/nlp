Made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews-one of the best desserts ever! Loved the individual dishes-actually had left over dishes which were equally good the next day. Don't change a thing in the recipe.

Love the recipe but it has too much ginger. I either use 2 T crystallized ginger in the apples or ground ginger in the topping but not both - prefer the crystallized ginger if you can chop it fine enough. I also agree the topping should be doubled to give a good crunchy crust.

I doubled this recipe for the baking dish. It was too heavy on the ginger and too light on the topping.

The apple part of this dessert is way too sweet -- it's like eating candy and has very little apple flavour. the topping was nice enough, but could use more oats.

Really good. I doubled the recipe and made in a 13x9" pan. I had to make a few changes due to not checking pantry before going to the store: dried cherries in place of cranberries; walnuts in place of pecans; light brown sugar in place of dark. Despite all that, it was delicious! I may cut the apples slightly larger next time I make this. They were very soft after cooking for the indicated time. I prefer them slightly firmer. I used full amount of sugar and don't think I'd reduce it. Maybe sub Splenda but it's supposed to be sweet... it's dessert!

This is a huge crowd pleaser every Thanksgiving. I use half the sugar in the filling and 1/3 less in the topping. I also use unsweetened cranberries and throw in some pears.

A little too sweet. I'll back off the sugar the next time I make it.

Delicious, although I felt the ginger flavor was a little overwhelming. I would probably either leave out the crystallized ginger next time or cut it way back. Other than that, though, it was great.

I used Splenda instead of sugar which was good, I would make sure the crystalized ginger is finely chopped, this was the only issue, some of the ginger was hard. I also left out the cranberries- my kids don't like cranberries. I served this will a chocolate dessert and it was a lovely compliment to the chocolate and the people who do not like chocolate love this.

This crisp is delicious and easy. I used fresh ginger and substituted dried cherries for the cranberries since that was what I had on hand. A perfect autumnal dessert!

A fantastic dessert. My kids ask for it a lot. With a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it can't be beat. I add a little powdered ginger to the topping.

One of my favorite recipes! I too used less sugar and did not add the cranberries. I added a little extra ginger and pecans and used pink lady apples. It is fantastic!

I have officially nominated this recipe as completely fool-proof- I ended up adding a cup of flour instead of a tablespoon (it was a hectic morning) and it was still a hit at my party. The crust was wonderful, especially with the toasted pecans, although I couldn't taste the ginger very much.

This is very good. I too used less sugar and used rasins. I did not use the crystalized ginger. I also added fresh lemon juice to the apple mixture. It was very easy to make and all my guests loved it!

Delish ! I used slightly less regular sugar with the apples (1/3 cup, rather than 1/2) so it wouldn't be overly sweet. Will make again. The variety of ingredients (ginger, cranberries, etc) really make the dish.

Doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan. Couldn't really taste the ginger (maybe the Granny Smith apples were too overpowering). Plenty of other good apple/craisin crisps out there.

I made this exactly as written. My father-in -law proclaimed it "The best apple crisp I have ever eaten"! However, the ginger made this dish too intense for my kids, they couldn't eat it. Oh well, there's more for my husband and me...

I changed this a bit by using fresh ginger--about 2 tablespoons with the basic recipe--and stirring it in with the apples and dried cranberries. It was delicious and got rave reviews.

I made this for my book club and everyone loved it! It is delicious when you serve it warm with ice cream. The toated peacans really add to the flavor!

This was very good, though a little too sweet for my taste. I used Spice Islands crystallized ginger. Doubling the batch used up the whole jar - next time I'll use ginger from Trader Joe's(less sugar, better price). I baked it in a 13x9 inch pyrex dish - baked it while we ate dinner. Served it with good vanilla ice cream - everyone loved it!

I went apple picking and used Granny smiths to make this recipe. I doubled it and made it in a large dish and used fresh cranberries (about 1 to 1.5 cups) instead of dried. It was fabulous, not too sweet, and toasting the pecans really added a lot of flavor to the topping. I served it with creme caramel frozen yogurt which went well with the apples. I might add a bit more crystallized ginger next time tho. Very easy to make and great (and attractive) end product. I will be bringing it to my next potluck.

This is a delicous autumn dessert. I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe!

I used less apples, and more fresh cranberries. I served it warm, but I enjoyed it even more the next day, cold. The second time I made it, I substituted the toasted pecans for crushed pralines... WoW. A new favourite. Am going to try with pears next!

Delicious and easy. Next time I'll cut down on the sugar, a little much for my taste. My boyfriend who doesn't usually like warm fruit of any kind(strange), loved this.

I made it in a small casserole dish and everyone raved, ginger was the hit.

Excellent recipe and adapts well to other fruits - love a pear and cranberry combo. Have made it with both dried and fresh cranberries and prefer fresh. If using dried, suggest you reduce the amount of sugar as it may be a little too sweet. As well as the chopped ginger in the fruit, I also add 3 tbsp to the topping. I think omitting it was likely a misprint as the title states "Ginger-Pecan Topping". I prefer to melt the butter for these crumble-like toppings - makes it crisper. Enjoy!

Fabulous. Just a little too sweet. I'm going to make this many, many times!

This recipe is great! My children (9 and 12) have never cared for anything with baked apples -- they love this. When I have served this to guests they ask for the recipe.

i've made this twice and both times it came out great! my fiance said it is the best thing he's ever tasted in his life.

Great recipe. Not too tart - not too sweet. My husband, who is not a big sweets fan absolutely loved it. This is also very easy to make! Will definitely make this one again.

I too used fresh cranberries. Just threw them in whole. I didn't increase the sugar and it turned out fabulous! This is an excellent do-ahead dessert. I did everything but the last 25 minutes at 350 for the topping. Brought it to a friend's house as dessert for dinner that night. Popped it in her oven while we ate dinner. Was fabulously warm and perfect with the ice cream.

Excellent! I did not have dried cranberries either, so I cut the fresh ones in half. They added a subtle tartness. Everyone loved it. I am making it again tonight.

I bought at enormous bag of fresh cranberries from Sam's Club, so I needed some good recipes to make good use of them. Although the recipe called for dried cranberries, I went ahead and used the fresh with delicious results!

A guest brought this. Yummy reheated and served with vanilla ice cream. The ginger has just the right zip.

SUPERB! I rarely give 4 forks, but this IS a dish beyond compare. The ginger adds so much. Cut recipe in 1/2 to serve two (big mistake-we wanted more). I'm throwing away all my other apple-cranberry crisp recipes, this is keeper.

I was testing this recipe out for Thanksgiving. I doubled it and put it in the break room at work. Soon afterwards, an all-office email went out asking that whoever made the delicious crisp to please supply the recipe. I graciously complied... I used walnuts instead of pecans (what I had on hand) and unsalted margarine instead of butter, because I will be making the dish for someone who keeps kosher.

This was very yummy! The toasted pecans and cranberries definitely enhance this version of apple crisp. Next time, I will use more filling and less topping. It was just a little too much sugar for me.

Very Easy recipe ~ Wouldn't change a thing. Great a little warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
