This simple preparation is really good and highlights the fish. I have made it twice (swordfish and halibut) and both were delicious. The only thing I change is I use oregano and parsley instead of dill and tarragon (not my fave herbs). I will definitely be making this over and over!

I found that you need to thin out the mayonnaise a little with more lemon juice, otherwise it tastes too much like pure mayonnaise. You don't need this much herb sauce on the fish, but the fish tastes good if you put more herb sauce on after cooking the fish. The wine does not add to the taste at all. This dish is great with mashed sweet potatoes.

I thought it was very good. You don't need much of the sauce on the fish.

I didn't think cooking this in wine was the way to go so I grilled it instead and it came out very nice. For those that have not used the 'nantucket' style of marinating your fish in mayo before I find it makes for a very rich and juicy taste. You don't need much just a thin coating will be enough. I also found the left over marinate a little strong as is so thinned it out with a little more mayo and some lemon juice which worked nicely.

I liked it. I'd heard of this method of cooking fish and it did a great job of keeping the swordfish moist. Flavors combined well and penetrated the fish nicely. I even used inexpensive frozen swordfish. I followed the recipe except no wine.

Just OK. Won't be making it again.

I make this sauce all the time -- it's excellent with almost any kind of fish. But it really is kind of slimy slathered on the swordfish and covered with wine prior to cooking. I usually cook the fish some other way and serve it with the sauce.

I'm pretty sure we didn't do anything wrong (except omit the wine, which didn't seem to affect another reviewer's sauce), and I must say I found this fish preparation rather awful. Perhaps if you have a really mediocre piece of fish it will cover up the taste, but if you want to taste good fish rather than slimy mayo, you'd do best to look elsewhere.

This is a fantastic recipe! I didn't have time to chill the fish with the sauce for 30 min, and I don't think it mattered. I used a LARGE clove of garlic, a little more lemon juice and ground pepper. I baked it for the 17 minutes, but as it wasn't done, I finished cooking the fish on top of the stove, in a frying pan. My family loved it, and requested this recipe the next time I prepare swordfish.

Tastes even better with Salmon.

With a waning pantry supply, I didn't have tarragon or a dry white wine, so I omitted the wine and substituted 1/4 teaspoon savory for my missing herb. My father, who has never liked swordfish, said this was delicious. In fact, mmms were heard from all -- fishlovers and fishloathers alike!

Herb sauce is outstanding; it doesn't taste like anything one would likely find on the shelf in the grocery store but will work with most seafood dishes. Baking the swordfish is OK but grilling or broiling will probably appeal to more tastes.

A good basic sauce for fish. I used it on a piece of swordfish and two days later used the remainder on salmon steaks. I think the flavors came together more after the sauce was refrigerated for a day or so. Also, I didn't use salt or pepper on the swordfish, and the flavors were really lacking. Sauce kept both fish extremely moist while baking.

This receipt was delicious. I substituted light mayo for the regular and it was perfect. I would serve this to company at the drop of a hat.

We found this dish to be quite enjoyable. The combination was very different for swordfish
