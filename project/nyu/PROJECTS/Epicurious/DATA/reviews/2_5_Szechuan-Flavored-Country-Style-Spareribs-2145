I made this with the szechuan peppercorn/salt and without, and I actually prefer it without. The whole family raved about this recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I just reduced the amount of salt used based on other reviews and it was great. Of note, szechuan peppercorns can no longer be imported into the US. Tazamian peppercorns are a reasonable alternative.

When I made the Szechuan Salt-Pepper I had cut the recipe in half. Next time I won't use as much salt as requested. There was also huge amount of sauce left over, so I will probably cut this down too. With very little modifications, this recipe would be outstanding. My husband loved these ribs so I will definately do this again.

I made this last evening and the first thing that was said about the dish was "this is too salty..." and I agree. The Szechuan flavor was a bust. However, if I ever make this again I would use another Szechuan (Salt-Pepper) seasoning. I found one on the back of the Szechuan peppercorns.
