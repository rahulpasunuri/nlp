I found this a bit bland, and the proportions to be off. I'd add two eggs, and use fewer potatoes for the portions specified. They also don't fold very well, however thin you get them. The stuffing was tasty - I used a bit of butter instead of oil to make it creamier.

I don't get it. It says to spread the batter but it looks like it is just shredded potatoes. Hmmm...
