I've made this twice already and the whole family loves it. I left out the beans the second time - they seemed out of place in the dish. The broth is excellent.

We've been trying to incorporate more fish into our weekly menus and this one sure fit the bill! I didn't bother to add the white beans as 2 lbs of mussels and pasta was sufficient for just the 2 of us. Served with toasted garlic bread, and that was all that was needed.
