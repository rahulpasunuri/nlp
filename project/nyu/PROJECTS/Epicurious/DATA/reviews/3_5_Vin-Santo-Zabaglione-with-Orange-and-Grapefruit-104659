Wonderful! I used blood oranges mixed w/ navel oranges (left out the grapefruit) and served it w/ cantucci (biscotti that are the traditional accompaniment to vin santo.)

Simple yet fantastic. I used a "Fine Old Tokay" dessert wine which tastes somewhat like Marsala and it was terrific but very very sweet. Next time I'll try it with mixed berries.

Very delicious, with one caveat: the recipe for four yielded barely enough zabaglione for two. Either I blended it too long - in which case the instructions should be to remove from heat immediately once it's de-frothed - or else the non-fruit ingredients should be doubled.

not at all what we expected- did not like the zabagiole-

This is just delicious and refreshing. A California orange muscat is a good alternative if vin santo is unavailable

I've made this several times. This is a delicious, fast and light dessert! Use a serrated spoon (crate&barrel) to get the grapefruit meat out.
