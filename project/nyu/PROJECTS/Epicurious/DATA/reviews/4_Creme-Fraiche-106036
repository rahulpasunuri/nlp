If you are making this during the winter and do not keep your kitchen warm overnight, just bring the jar to your bedroom where it's probably warmer. This is particularly good if you have dual-zone heating in your house and lower the heat in the unused rooms (like a kitchen) overnight. :-)

This is delicious, but keeping it at a consistent temperature is important. If room temperature is too cool or cools off at night, try putting the jar of culturing dairy into a BIG pot of warm (75F) water. After a few hours, check the water temp. If it is 68F or below, scoop out some water and replace it with warmer water to bring the temp of the water bath back to 75.

I doubled this recipe using ultra pasteurized hwavy whipping cream and lowfat buttermilk because that was the only thing I could find and it worked great! The creme fraiche was amazing the following day. Although i doubled it, I got about 1 1/2 cups of creme

I tried this as written, worked like magic, made my kitchen feel even more like a lab! We are having an invasion of ants, so I used a method I learned at my auntie's knees years ago. To keep the ants out of the jar but be able to leave it uncovered, I set the jar of ingredients in a bowl of water. Mission accomplished!

This worked very well for me using ultra-pasteurized heavy cream and low-fat buttermilk. However, I did modify the recipe by doubling it and adding 8 oz. of creamy horseradish sauce and a couple of tablespoons of finely-chopped scallions. I put everything in a quart Mason jar and shook it up before I went to bed, and it was ready to use in the morning.

This worked perfectly! I could only find ultra-pasteurized cream at the market, but I made a double batch with it, put it in a mason jar with some plastic wrap on top, and put it on the shelf next to the stove. Voila, after about 18 hours, I had crème fraîche! Then I used the rest of my buttermilk to make pumpkin chocolate chip scones.

A note on the heavy cream: For best results use only PASTEURIZED, not ultra-pasteurized. Oddly enough, I've just lately come across info on this topic; this is most likely the cause of many problems reported. Stating which cream to use could have made life easier for all. Simple and delicious! Will be making again soon!

Good recipe and very easy to do. We turn the heat down at night which makes the kitchen very cool. I just put it into the oven (oven is off) because I have found that my oven when it is off is a little over 70 degrees.

The fat sontent of the buttermilk does NOT matter. The amount in very small in the overall preparation. When I made this all I could find was ultra pasteurized heavy cream and I keep my house downright cold (like around 67 in my kitchen). With all of my research into making this, leaving it out for up to 48 hours is fine. I put mine close to a coffee maker filled with water and just kept turning it on ( had an automatic shutoff). It was off most of the night, but I still found it very nicely thickened within 24 hours. This recipe is the standard for making creme fraiche on your own.

This recipe didn't mention NOT using ultra-pasteurized heavy cream, but it probably should, since it takes much longer to thicken. And our ambient kitchen temperature is only that warm (70°) during a Seattle summer heat wave, so that also adds thickening time. It took about 36hrs for my first batch to culture properly (because of the ultra-pasteurized product AND cooler-than-specified room temp), and 24hrs the 2nd time, when I put the bowl under a halogen lamp. And if the fat content of the buttermilk makes a difference, that would be nice to know, since I've only recently seen a non-lowfat buttermilk in a grocery store. I can't fault this recipe, though, since I have no idea whether or not that's true. But if it is, darn it, it should be readily available in Seattle! But overall, this recipe is fine - the creme fraiche was super tasty.

I've tried various methods of making Creme Fraiche over the years and finally settled on full fat buttermilk and heavy cream left out overnight at a temperature over 70 degrees.

Super Easy to make. And a lot easier than finding the stuff in my local supermarket.

I agree with the previous reviewer who recommended making this in advance - it holds well in the fridge. I made this with lowfat buttermilk and ultra-pasteurized whipping cream, which was all I could find locally. After sitting nearly 15+ hours in somewhat coolish conditions (room temps probably upper 60's to lower 70's), the cream-buttermilk mixture was pourable and not set up at all. I moved the jar to a warmer setting (beneath some under-counter spotlights), and about 2-3 hours later the creme fraiche was thick and wonderful. I'm a convert now - who needs store bought when freshly made is so easy!

The ingredient list dosen't specify milk fat content for the buttermilk. The first time I used this reciepe, I used 1% buttermilk (gotta watch those calories!)and it took FOREVER to thicken. Subsequently, I have used 3.5% buttermilk and the process is speeded up remarkably...but still a minimum 12h wait. Keeps up to a month (but is usually used up within 3 weeks). Well worth the wait and much better than a heavy cream/sour cream combination.

Use manufacturers cream if you can. Took more than 14 hours for creme to be thick enough to use so I had to cheat and add sour cream. I needed the creme for a quiche in my cafe. PLAN AHEAD on this one!
