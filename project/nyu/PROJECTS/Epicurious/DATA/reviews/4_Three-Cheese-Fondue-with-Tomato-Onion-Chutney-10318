Who needs The Melting Pot when they have this recipe on hand? This time around we could not find Emmenthaler. Jarlsberg Swiss worked great as an on par replacement.

I have been making this for years!!! The fondu is awesome but the chutney definitely makes the fondu. I usually make the chutney per the recipe but I let it sit over night in a mini crock pot that I have. The chutney receipe makes quite a bit & so I usually portion out & freeze whatever is leftover in the batch.

This fondue is absolutely stellar! I agree with the comments made that the tomato-onion chutney is not necessary. I too have made it several times, leaving out the chutney altogether.

I have made this a few times, it's very good. I omit the brandy and don't bother with the chutney anymore. We eat it with good French bread, potatoes, brocoli and carrots. I use a heavy pan so I can reheat the cheese mixture as needed.

Yum! This was fabulous fondue...the tomato chutney was divine in this...(I think I added a bit more than 1/3 cup). Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe, and it was great...

Over the years, I have made many cheese fondues. This outstanding fondue is by far the best! I could not find Calvados so used Korbel brandy. In place of the tomato-onion chutney, I used a mango-onion based chutney and mixed in chopped sundried tomatoes. As suggested by others, I also included chopped marinated artichoke hearts. The only downside of this recipe is that with all of its unique ingredients, making it is quite expensive.

I was experimenting with the recipe and I added two jars of artichoke hearts (8 ounces each) I had made it once before and it was okay, but the artichoke hearts made it go from mediocre to BEAUTIFUL. They really pushed it over the top.

Very tasty. I skewered the veggies and tortellinis with wooden skewers and arranged them on a platter. The tomato-onion chutney really made the dish extra special.
