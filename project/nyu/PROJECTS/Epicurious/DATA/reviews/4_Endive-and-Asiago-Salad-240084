I make this salad all the time. It's super easy to make, healthy and delicous. I add a little pear infused vinegar to it.

Ugh, the first '4 fork' recipe that I've been disappointed by! The salad itself was good, but the dressing was way too sour. I have enjoyed tart dressings, but the amount of lemon in this recipe is overpowering.

Great little salad! Made it for a Cancun reunion party and received compliments all around. I kept pretty much to the recipe - maybe a little more cheese. Easy and very good!

Though this salad is relatively easy to assemble, it's most delicious and the flavors compliment each other so well. I'll make it as often possible. 4 forks!!

A simple yet tasty salad. The mild endive, peppery arugula, creamy cheese and tart lemon dressing make a wonderfully balanced combination.

I made this salad with my 6 years old granddaughter. She whisked the oil and lemon, then helped grating the cheese. We then sat down and had a nice light, tasty salad.
