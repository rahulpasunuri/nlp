This was a disaster for me. It didnt hold up, just fell flat on the late. Did i do something wrong? I am really a confident chef, but this did not work.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it continues to be a crowd pleaser. Easy to make and really excellent.

i made this as part of a menu for a catered party..i thought it was fabulous as did the guests...the flavors are subtle and each layer complimented the other. i served it with bagel and pita chips..one thing i changed was, for the roasted red pepper layer, instead of buying the jarred peppers and processing them, i bought a large jar of ajvar which is a spicy hot roasted red pepper and eggplant dip with garlic..good idea! will definately make this again and again...also, i used roasted garlic in the bean layer instead of raw...also a good idea and adds to the subtley of the layer

love this! I read other reviewers, followed their lead. Did only 1/2 the bean layer, 1/2 the oil in pesto, and a packed cup of basil & parsley. A little more feta & dried the pepper well in the pepper layer. Used 3 dishes - 1 small souffle, 2 ramikins, to give away. The presentation is great.

I would have to say that i am quite impressed with this recipe, the bean layer and the pepper layer where nice, the pesto layer didn't work so well and i would go for an alternative next time. However it all kept it's shape well and was quite impressive and tasted nice, even if not earth moving. After reading other reviews i made sure it was all as moisture free as possible. Give it a whirl!

Great tasting stuff! I almost always use more garlic than called for. However, my "pate" came out more as a spread. Next time I will try to make it dryer so it can be sliced. Less oil, dryer type cheese, more nuts, etc.

I made this for a Christmas Day appetizer and thought it was somewhat bland. Others liked it but no one asked for the recipe. I didn't have the problems others described with the red pepper layer being too runny (I dried the peppers before pureeing) and the pesto layer was nice and thick. I think because I used a 'packed' cup each of basil and parsley leaves. I halved the bean layer which worked out fine. The whole pate just needs more flavor. Perhaps lots more garlic and some salt and pepper. Although I used a rectangular loaf pan I like the idea of a 4" springform. Maybe dust the sides with Italian seasoned fine breadcrumbs.

I took this to two parties and it was only so-so. There was a lot left over. The middle layer is too runny and the overall texture wasn't creamy or smooth as one would expect a pate to be. It is easy to make however and completely vegetarian. I reccomend using a smaller mold - I used the bread pan and a narrower rectangular mold which fared much better. Good luck!

I have made this on several occasions and it is always a hit. Leftovers are great too! I always decorate the top to give it some eye appeal. A few long slivers of green onion for graceful stems, then a few artfully placed bright veggie pieces to form abstract flowers.

I made this dish for a catering, and it was the hit of the evening! After reading the other comments, I made the following changes: thyme and oregano in the bean layer with less oil; more DRY feta in the red pepper layer; I made much more pesto with less oil and more cheese and pine nuts and garlic. This was beautiful, kept its shape and was devoured! I served it with homemade sun-dried tomato and basil bread cut in squares. even the children present wolfed it down! I'll definitely make this one again.

I made this over the weekend for guests, and everyone seemed to like it... but it didn't exactly disappear. I used a small souffle dish instead of a loaf pan, which did make a nice presentation. I'd probably try it again, but next time, I'd doctor it up a little and maybe put some sun-dried tomatoes in the red layer and/or some pine nuts on top. I also should have taken the advice of the reviewers who suggested doubling the pesto layer, as there just wasn't enough of it. Definitely a recipe with potential and easy enough to experiment with any time.

Wonderful recipe that was a success on my first try. Be forewarened, however, it makes a LOT of pate! I would cut the recipe in 1/2 or 1/3, and as someone else mentioned perhaps reduce the proportion of white bean layer. I recommend roasting your own bell peppers rather than buying them in a jar, it's a cinch really. Just make sure they're well-drained. My guests loved the taste so much they thought it must be loaded with fat. I had to convince them otherwise (besides, olive oil has good cholesterol).

I loved the concept and the overall taste however, I think that the proportion of the white bean layer to the other layers is too much. I also made a few ingredient changes along the way. I used thyme rather than oregano and lots more garlic than two cloves. In the red pepper layer, I used a dry goat cheese rather than feta and it that layer had a nice taste. However, I found that it required more than 4 oz of chese. Lastly, the next time I make this, I might double the pesto layer because the taste was great but there wasn't enough of it!!

I loved this recipe. I had no difficulties in making it. I think with the red layer, which seems to trip up some of the folks who've tried it, you need to make sure you use dry feta, not the kind that comes in liquid. Also, drain those peppers well. You should be fine. This was soooooo good. You'll need lots of bread to schmear it on - this goes a long way. I sliced baguettes (the skinny kind - not french bread)into quarter inch slices.

What a beauty! My friend made this at my request for a dinner party. I am a personal chef and we served this at party this weekend. It was not only lovely, but very flavorful and the guests loved it. I will keep this one for future parties.

Wonderful recipe! I used 3 tablespoons of store bought pesto instead and it turned out super and saved lots of time! Instead of a loaf pan, I used a small springform pan (4 inches ?) sprayed with vegetable spray and chilled overnite. Very impressive!

This pate is outstanding and very easy to make. You can make it all in a food processor. I decorated it with baby red, yellow and orange peppers.

I was so looking forward to making it. What a waste of time and money. This dish looks nasty... Maybe if you use 3 loaf pans. I used 2 and still there was to much. When I served it on a nice holiday tray and took the plastic off.I wanted to cover it up, it's not eye apealing at all.

Delicous flavors! Even after draining and blotting peppers my red layer came out too thin, too, and I added 4 oz of cream cheese to bind it.

I have a lot of vegetarian friends and always am supposed to bring a dish to get togethers. Now I bring this and they all rave about it and ask for it again

This is great. Lots of flavor. Served it with a tuscan bread crouton. The red pepper layer seemed too thin so I added grated parmesan to help tighten it up. Changed the flavor, but still complimentary.

Makes enough for an army! Everyone asked for the recipe.
