A favorite in our house. On days when my 85 year-old mother-in-law is not coming for dinner, I add a Jalipeno or two or three -- sliced thin and not deseeded...

This is a great breakfast dish! I made it as described, but with less butter and used havarti cheese instead. I also followed another person's comment and didn't put it in the oven but used a lid (so I guess its not really a frittata...). Delicious! Very tasty, easy to make, and it kept well. I just zapped a piece in the microwave during my busy work week.

I was terrified because I had never made a fratada, but despite my inexperience this was fabulous! I made if for a brunch and it tasted great!

We don't have an oven-proof skillet at our summer home, so I made this in a non-stick skillet and put a lid over it after the addition of the cheese. It looked lovely and tasted even better. I'll make this again

Very easy & delicious. I added one fresh jalpeno pepper to the sweet peppers for just a little extra spice.

Excellent and easy. I have made for several brunches and always get rave reviews. It is absolutely fool-proof.
