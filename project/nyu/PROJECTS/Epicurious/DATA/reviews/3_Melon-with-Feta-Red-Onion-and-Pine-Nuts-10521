I scaled this down to use up half a cantaloupe that was languishing in the fridge, with probably a slightly higher ratio of mint. Delicious sweet/salty/tangy combo! Next time I might add prosciutto. Don't skimp on the lime, and maybe add just a touch of mild vinegar so the acid plays against the sweet melon. Delicious, refreshing summer salad!

Depending on the size of the melons, this recipe will easily serve 12-16! I also tossed all the ingredients together, but the melon to other ingredients ratio was too large, so I had the choice of either doubling the other ingredients, or storing half the cut up melons. This recipe is unusual; also, it's rather labor intensive so I may not attempt it again.

This is very different, but good! I cubed the cantaloupe and tossed everything together rather than assembling as suggested. I also used Vadalia onions, rather than red - just not as colorful. If you are looking for the out of the ordinary fruit salad, this is it!
