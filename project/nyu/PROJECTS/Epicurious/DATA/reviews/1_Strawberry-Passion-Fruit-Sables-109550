I was hoping this dessert would be fantastic. Instead it was rather blah. The coulis was wonderful, and I will use it in other recipes. The filling was flat. I couldn't find passion fruit, so I used strawberry & mango, but it didn't have much flavor. My biggest problems with the recipe were that it I couldn't make it ahead of time & it took a lot of time to put together. I suspect the 'make ahead' times were on the conservative side...I had extra coulis left over, and 3 days later it was still fine (having been refrigerated in an airtight container). It got a tiny bit darker, but not much.
