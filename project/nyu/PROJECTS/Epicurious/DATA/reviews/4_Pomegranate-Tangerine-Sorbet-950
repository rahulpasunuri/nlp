Very nice! Served it with the cake from the cornmeal cake/buttermilk ice cream recipe on this site. Lovely color and flavor, but I found it a little less punchy than some sorbets I've had. I used POM pomegranate juice. Would make again, though, as one of a sorbet trio.

This is a fabulous sorbet. I substitued Blood Orange Juice. I think the next time I make this I will omit the peel or strain it out before churning. I prefer a creamy texture. Makes a wonderful Intermezzo for a formal thanksgiving meal.

I have two pomegranate trees and I make this every year. It is a family favorite. To improve the color use blood oranges rather than tangerines. If the grated peel offends, use the new rasp type grater for very fine shavings. One of my favorites!

We found the color of this sorbet to be unappealing. The flavor was OK, but not nearly as good as the "Mango Tango" sorbet (mango and tangerine juice) recipe that came with our ice cream machine...

I've been making this consistantly for two years now and still love it. Splenda substitutes well for sugar, though the sorbet freezes harder after 24 hours. I also add 2 T. of vodka to keep from being too hard.

Fabulous use of pomegranates. Everyone loves it. We use it as a palate cleanser between courses at Thanksgiving and Christmas. But I always make extra to have for dessert with more ordinary meals.

I've made this twice. First I followed recipe to the letter, except cut sugar in half-excellent. The second time I left the tangerine out entirely and doubled up pomegranate juice. I belive this, green apple and blueberry will be on my menu for New Years eve.

Served this with the epicurious.com recipe for Cormeal-Crusted Chicken w/ Toasted Corn Salsa and found it to be a heavenly dessert! Will definitely make again (tomorrow night) and plan on making it all summer long. Found the Pomegranate Margarita recipe on www.foodandwine.com also wonderful and refreshing.

This was great! I used this as a refreshing dessert to a Christmas meal. I substituted clementine juice for the tangerines and I didn't use the peel. About half way through the freezing process I decided to add a tablespoon each of cointreau and tequila which made it into a sort of frozen pomegranate margarita sorbet. At serving time I sprinkled some pomegranate seeds over the sorbet. It was a real winner!

I used three large pomegranates to get a little more than two cups of juice. Since pomegranates and tangerines are plentiful now, I will experiment some more with this recipe since I would prefer a little less sacharine experience. Tangerine and sweet flavors predominate and I'd prefer a little more tartness. The color is beautiful - I served it in the tangerine shells.

An update: Trader Joe's now stocks pomegranate juice in glass bottles.

This is the easiest dessert ever!!! The color is simply outstanding. Got excellent reviews from everyone. For an added bonus, use the pomegrante shells as individual serving dishes. Scoop whatever's left after squeezing them, and freeze. Makes for a beautiful presentation.

In regards to getting pure pomegranate juice there are a couple choices. You can go to pomegranateconnection.com or sadaf.com. Also check with your local health food store (ex. Wild Oats). If they don't stock it, they may be able to order it for you.

Made this for a wine tasting party as a "refresher"...raves from all. I doubled the recipe & froze in two batches. Didn't think it was too sweet. Used 6 pomegranates to get the juice needed for double batch...yes, it was tedious...why hasn't someone marketed pomegranate juice?

Beautiful ruby color and exciting flavor will make this a fine addition to any special meal. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Obtaining pomegranate juice is tedious and very messy but well worth it.
