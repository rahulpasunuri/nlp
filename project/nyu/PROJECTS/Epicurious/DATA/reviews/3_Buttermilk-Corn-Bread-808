This bread was "just ok", I doubt I will make it again. I found it on the dry side. J. Jordan Flushing NY

I have made several of the corn bread recipes on Epicurious and I was expecting this one to be one of the best. It was good, but not great. It tasted very similar to a Jiffy mix (which makes a good corn bread). I'll keep looking for a great one.

This cornbread was good, but more something I would serve as dessert or as breakfast than I would with chili or any sort of non-sweet meal. The flavor was *very* eggy -- I'll make it again, but with one less egg and I might try to see if I can make some sort of pudding or cake out of it... perhaps adding applesauce?

SO GOOD! This was just perfect! It turned out exactly how I had hoped - moist with just the right amount of sweetness. Everyone raved about this one. I'm not much of a cook, so this really got everyone's attention at the dinner table!

This is the best corn bread recipe I've tried. My family loves it, and I've made it for friends who also loved it. In my experience the cornbread rises very high and is moist and delicious. I have tried halving the butter and making up the difference with buttermilk (to cut down on fat) and it turned out fine.

This was good cornbread! Be careful not to overbake it, as it will dry out quickly. I might add more butter or buttermilk next time for added moistness. Great with honey butter!

I'm very fond of this particular recipe. The buttermilk gives it a distinctive crumb and for us who prefer a somewhat sweetened corn bread, this is perfect. I've used this recipe (among others) since I first saw it in the 1994 Bon Appetit magazine.

I hate to sling arrows, but the last thing this bread is, is dry. A wonderful cornbread which I have been making since 1994. One can always make it sweeter, or less sweet depending on your taste. Also, if the amount of butter frightens you, I have made this with half the amount called for.

Recipe is very easy and delicious compliment to chili. Great served warm or toasted with whipped butter the next morning!
