I was not able to grill this recipe, so I want to try it again, but even still, I more or less threw everything in a skillet and then when it was almost done, I dumped some of the sauce in to cover everything. I doubled the garlic and ginger, and the flavors were great together. Will definitely do it again.

I made this dish as described using colossal shrimp. It was absolutely delicious and simple to make. I made it for company and my guests were great cooks who all loved it. I am making it again tomorrow!

the skewers were to die for!!! I left them marinade longer then said and then brushed them again after cooking. They were fantastic! I did not like the so called glaze. It was not a glaze to me it was dressing to use as a salad spritzer for delicate baby greens. As a catering business operator the shrimp skewers are something I will definitely use for my customers.

I made this recipe for a special friend's birthday and it was wonderful. I did skewer mangos and pineapples separately and served all over a coconut/cilantro rice. I garnished the plate with fresh avocados and cilantro.This recipe makes a stunning presentation on the plate and makes you dream of being in the tropics. Last night I skewered chicken and mangos and served the dish over the leftover rice and sauce. It was all good. A definite keeper.

Delicious! I used pineapple instead of mango and added onion. The spice was just right for this medium-salsa girl. I'll make it again, may play a bit with the ingredients and add some black pepper.

The glaze is amazing. I used shrimp and pineapple and everyone enjoyed it.

The flavors of the seasonings were fun and sprightly. I sauteed the shrimp in a large non-stick pan and served with sauteed rounds of zucchini and a large salad. The coolness of the cucumbers, lettuce, and avocado of the salad balanced the heat of the ginger and the red pepper flakes on the shrimp. I'll definitely make this again.

This is an amazing recipe. As other reviewers have said, the glaze makes the dish. I let the shrimp marinate for over 1 hour before I added the bell peppers. I only added the mango at the end just before cooking. We found that crushed red peppers made the marinated spice. I'm going to make it again on New Year's with a coconut cilantro rice.

I love shrimp, but the usual recipes were getting tiresome& I put the shrimp in the marinade before everything else, and left it all in for about a half hour before I skewered them. Absolutely great! A charcoal grill is a necessity, as the fruitiness of the dish really needs the flavor. I also used more red pepper than the recipe calls for. I used a heaping teaspoon, but I might use even more next time, and there will be a next time!

I made this last night to take for a picnic. Yum! I couldn't find canned guava, so I used frozen passion fruit concentrate. It worked well in terms of taste but the glaze wasn't all that thick. I also stir-fried instead of grilled and that worked just fine.

This recipe was real hit for a Mother's Day barbeque. We loved the flavors and will definitely make this again. The sweetness of the guava, the sour from the lime and the heat from the red pepper flakes were a fabulous combination. The only thing that I changed was to purchase large, cleaned shrimp instead of colossal since I am not a fan of cleaning shrimp nor a fan of really big shrimp. Because of this, I chose to use a grill basket rather than skewer all of the shrimp. This recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 4
I made this tonight for my husband and me, and we both absolutely loved it!! I left out the red peppers--he doesn't like them and I'm ambivilent--but kept the shrimp otherwise as is. I got about a pound and half of "regular" size shrimp (not too big, not too small) and it was great for dinner + lunch tomorrow! The glaze made a lot, so I'm saving it for next time--we'll see how well it keeps. Also, I mistakenly added the lime juice before reducing, and it was fine. Don't know what the difference would be... Oh, and I couldn't find guava nectar at the last minute, but did find mango nectar and it was delicious! This is going in the repertoire!!

This was a perfect dish for a hot summer night of dining alfresco. I changed a few things, substituted pineapple for mango, added supersweet cherry tomoatoes from my garden and marinated for few hours. Served over rice pilaf w/garlic and cilantro and grilled asparagus. It was delicious, my boyfriend raved about it. WOuld definitely make it again.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and would make it again in a heart beat. I deviated from the recipe by leaving the shells on the shrimp and cut a slit in the shells along the back. I believe they keep more flavor this way but as you read the other reviews, it is still a great recipe. One other idea is not to use mango that is too ripe, thus it becomes to hard to skewer and manipulate.

This recipe was delicious! I used fresh cubes of pineapple instead of mango, added cherry tomatoes and cubes of red onion, and doubled up on the marinade seasonings. I served these at a large back yard party, and everyone was inquiring about the mysterious (yet fabulously delicious) flavors in the marinade. This one's a keeper!

This was so good my husband and I didn't want it to be gone! Of course, I made some adjustments/changes. Instead of using skewers, I grilled everything together in a vege grilling basket - worked great. I used one red pepper and one green pablano pepper (mildly hot). Others had said the marinade was bland, so I increased quantities a bit and added a smoky serano hot sauce - WOW! One warning - the guava lime glaze needs to be prepared ahead and chilled-I didn't know this and used it hot - still turned out great! Also, I highly recommend serving this over the Rice with Pine Nuts and Cilantro recips on this site - the combination of flavors just burst in your mouth! A real keeper!

I made this dish for a picnic on the 4th o July and my guests loved it as did I. Had a little trouble finding the Guava juice but glad I did, I also made some with chicken and fresh pineapple,instead of shrimp and mango, for those who don't like seafood. Would make it again in a heart beat.

We didn't have any guava and didn't make the glaze, but the grilled mango, garlic, and ginger was spectacular.

This dish rocks!! I took the advise from the board and added more garlic, crushed red, and ginger to the marinade. I used frozen shrimp not our local fresh gulf shrimp with very good results. I had a rough time cutting the mango per instruction--slippery mess. So I put them on foil and basted separate from the skewers. I had leftover glaze which I plan to freeze for later use as I made a full batch of glaze and half batch skewers. Yum.

This recipe is excellent. I put it together this evening for my girlfriend and I. After reading some previous reviews which stated the marinade was bland, I had decided to spice up the olive oil/garlic/red pepper flake/ginger mixture with chile powder and black pepper. I would also suggest to do as I did and increase the proportions of the spices, as much of the mixture is lost while grilling. Overall, the spicy-sweet combination works very well as always. I cannot wait to make this recipe again!

Rating: 2
This was alright, but I've had tastier grilled shrimp. It seemed to lack that special "zing." I even added a pinch of salt and red pepper flakes to the glaze, but there still seemed to be something lacking. If I make it again, I would probably use a firmer fruit, such as nectarines, as the mango is fragile and hard to cut due to the seed.

Rating: 1
I'm very surprised at all the great reviews this recipe has received. We thought the shrimp was bland and flavorless. The flavor of the marinade just didn't penetrate. This is the first epicurious recipe that has let us down. We liked the flavor of the mango and red pepper but not enough to make this again.

Fantastic. I let the shrimp marinate in the olive oil/garlic/ginger for about 2 hours before adding the mango and peppers and then skewering. Everyone loved it and I'll be making it again this weekend!

This was good. A tip though: any fruit juice, like the guava/lime glaze in this case, will tenderize meat - so we ended up with mushy shrimp. I do suggest going very light on the basting sauce and/or put it on right at the end. Other than that, this was great. I added pineapple to mine! Also, if you can get them, Manilla Mangoes are easier to cut up than Mexican Mangoes.

While this dish was delicious, and I would definitely make it again, the name of the dish says "guava-lime glaze" and the recipe calls for neither guava or lime!

Then I decide if I want to try the recipe and use the imput & suggestions of other inspired cooks. I love this site and love the reviews but I'm getting so frustrated with the reviews that start out, "This recipe is PERFECT but I changed this, this, this, that and stood on my head while reading the latest issue of Bon Appetit for the final 6 minutes of cooking."

Despite all of the fresh juices involved, this dish left me (and my guests) flat. Based on the other reviews and the recipe itself, I expected it to be succulent and flavorful.

Really yummy! Even my 4 year old ate like a grown man. However, I live in a small town with a tiny grocery so I couldn't get guava nectar, mangos or plain red wine vinegar (all they had was rasberry flavored white wine vinegar). So I used peach nectar, peaches and basalmic vinegar (which I always have on hand). It was great! Next time I'm in the "big city" of Madison, WI. I'll stock-up on the guava nectar and red wine vinegar. I served it with coconut rice.

This recipe was fantastic! Neither my fiancee or I are big seafood eaters but decided to branch out since we're on a limited diet before the wedding. I took other suggestions and halved the guava nectar with peach nectar. I also made a mango salsa as suggested and put the shimp alone on the skewers. Easy and tasty, I've already made this twice and will definitely make it again.

Absolutely terrific! I've made this several times for dinner parties and it's always a hit and easy to prepare in advance. I do make a couple changes, though -- I only put the marinated shrimp on the skewers. I make a mango salsa on the side (mango, cilantro, red onion, red bell pepper, lime juice), and also serve coconut rice and black beans. Garnish with avacado slices and a sprig of cilantro. Makes a delicious and gorgeous dish -- everyone always comments of the colorfulness.

Easy and delicious. Only marinated the shrimp about 30 minutes, and added mango and red pepper near end. Important that mango not be too ripe or too firm. For reader whose shrimp turned out hard and crusty, suggest that it be cooked for a shorter time and at lower temperature. Also, use sprayed grill rack and it shouldn't stick. Good luck!

My husband called this "a top-notch dish". The flavors are so beautifully balanced. I marinated the fruit and peppers in the oil mixture for an hour and added the shrimp about 15 minutes before I was ready to grill. Visually, it's a stunning dish, perfect for entertaining. Taste is superlative, this is great summer fare. For the Guava glaze I substitued pineapple juice or the guava (didn't have it on hand). Try this one.

This is a great recipe especially if you love mango. Wonderful taste and flavor. Would go great with a cold beer. I followed the recipe exactly except omitted red pepper because it doesn't seem to me that it goes very well with mango. I also used a grill and skewer rack to grill the entire dish which made it very simple to grill and carry the rack with the skewers back to the table.

After I got an equity loan, I bought the colossal shrimp! IT does make a great looking meal. But.. red pepper spice could be omitted - it over powers the shrimp. And mangos are a mess. I also used pineapple which was wonderful. I did peel the shrimp and had no problem on the grill. So it was good but the next time I'll make the changes I mentioned. Cocoanut rice got rave reviews. And we had a spinach salad with mandarin slices, sliced almonds, chinese noodles and a sesame/ginger dressing. It was a great complement.

I love the flavors in this dish but I dont follow the recipe at all. The first time I tried to follow the recipe and cook the shrimp on the grill. The shrimp had no flavor and I lost all that good sauce. Now I put everything in a large sauce pan and cook it like a sauce. I add the shrimp at the end and serve over rice or pasta.

I gave three forks, and with some re-writing of the recipe it is...but a couple of warnings. First I won't peel the shrimp next time, not for the grill anyway. Mine stuck, and where just a mess. The shell on eliminates that problem. Second, it says that you can assemble the skewers 4 hours in advance...DON'T! The ginger and the garlic destroyed the shrimp. You really do have to toss just before cooking. My shrimp where a glueing, mushy mess. We couldn't eat them. What a waste of $20. All that as it may be, the flavors where very tasty and all my guest agreed that with those notes, it will be great outdoor eating.

Normally I do not take the time to rate a recipe, but this is a 4+. I have barbequed this fantastic dish, but last night I stirfried it and served it with rice. Wow, is it delicious! Be sure to use raw shrimp so its flavor will go through the red pepper, etc., but just don't overcook it. My hubby who isn't into food that much and not a big eater, raves about this dish and eats three servings of it. He has never responded to any food like this one! If you stir fry it, have everything else on the table, add the Guava-Lime Glaze the last one minute and be ready to eat an outstanding meal!

This was easy and delicious! I marinated all in a baggie about 2 hours before putting on skewers and grilling. Also squeezed fresh lime juice just before grilling as not to 'cook' the shrimp before hand and served with lime wedges on the side. I too served it with basmati rice cooked with a pinch of tumeric and about 4 crumbled threads of saffron, though gazpacho and fresh warm flour tortillas sounds great too! The only thing I might do differently next time is add scallops. Someone taught me a trick awhile back to stop kebobs from 'flopping around' when turning. It can be remedied by threading on 2 skewers instead of just one. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Not my typical choice for dinner (it's the fruit in food thing, I just don't get it), but I thought I'd go out on a limb for a small dnner party after a summer concert. I made up the kababs, and poured the marinade over them, to which I had added the juice of one lime. Let that sit in the fridge a few hours, then grilled 3 minutes per side. Perfect. The mix of flavors and textures was great. I served eack skewer with a bowl of gazpacho and a wedge of quessdalla (that I had warmed up), all prepared earlier in the day.

E-A-S-Y!! And DELICIOUS; special enough for guests as well! Didn't skewer and didn't baste (thunderstorm sped up our grilling). We often grill using those grill trays with the small, diamond, "mesh" pattern , saving lots of time and preventing the inevitable "fall- through"'s we'd have had with too-soft mango. (Also, allows you to USE a mango that is too soft otherwise. And can cut pepper & mango into bite-sized pieces.) With a pesky storm approaching we opted to stir the glaze (sauce) into the hot goods off the grill. Thinking about the GRILL clean-up otherwise, we'll probably opt for that again. Or maybe pop it in a broiler pan & run it under the broiler for glazing finish step. Oh, and we pulled our red peppers out of the marinade and began grilling those sooner for our preference; -thought they'd only be getting warm about time the shrimp would have finished. Added mango and shrimp after few minutes.
