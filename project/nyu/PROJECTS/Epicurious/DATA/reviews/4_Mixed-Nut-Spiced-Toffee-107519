I live in the UK so substituted golden syrup and replaced some of the light brown sugar with dark brown sugar, instea of the molasses. It came out beautifully. Pistachios in the nut mix on top look festive. Macadamias in the toffee are divine!

I've made this twice already this season. Really tasty - melt in your mouth. I used choco chips - they melted nicely on the hot toffee - I hate grating chocolate. The second time I made this I also added more nuts than the recipe called for and mixed them all into the toffee.

Living at altitude I was a bit nervous to make this not knowing how it might affect the final product, but it was delicious. I heated the candy only to about 275 degrees, using the "for every 500 ft above sea level, decrease temperature by 1 degree", but this left me with slightly too much of a soft crack. Next time I will heat it to maybe 280-285. I used the bulk nuts at Whole Foods (roasted and salted cashews, brazilian nuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) which were great. Next time I will add more chocolate than it calls for, because what's not to love about a thicker layer of chocolate...

Decided during football that I wanted to make chocolate covered nuts to take as a hostess gift to some friends and I wound up making this instead and I'm sure glad I did. Had everything on hand - used cashews on the bottom and pistachios on top. Added 1 tsp each of ginger and cinnamon, used nutmeg instead of allspice and dark molasses. It took about 30 minutes for my sugar to get to 290. Overall it couldn't have been easier or tastier. The results were definitely worth the 30 minutes in front of the stove. Everyone at the dinner party raved and it totally saved the otherwise bland pumpkin mousse that was served for dessert.

YUM! For easy cleaning, line the pan with parchment paper. You don't have to grease it and the toffee comes right off. I used toasted almonds in the toffee and toasted pecans on top. My friends LOVE this and ask for it every Christmas.

I give this toffee as gifts every Christmas and it is always a huge hit with my friends. I used 1 T dark Karo instead of molasses, skipped the allspice, put toasted almonds in the toffee, and added 1 tsp vanilla with the almonds, and toasted pecans on top. I also used semi sweet chocolate chips and spread them out once they had softened. YUM!

I wasn't able to find light molasses, and failed to calibrate the candy thermometer before the first batch -- which came out slightly singed as a result. I recommend substituting 1 tsp of regular (dark) molasses for the 1 tbs in of light in the recipe. The allspice was a really great addition. I don't know if it's just me, but the toffee was extra buttery, to the point where it was greasy to touch. I might try it with just 2 sticks of butter in the future.

Fabulous...my guests gobbled up every bite. I plan to make it again for New Year's day, although I deeply regret that I have already started my diet and will not be able to nibble this treat. A real wow recipe.

I have made this toffee every year for 7 years for Christmas gifts. I vary the nuts depending on who I give it to. It is now an expected treat. I do add a tablespoon of corn syrup to prevent burning. Very easy and fun to make.

Delicious. Easy to follow instructions. I doubled the amount of chocolate and did not have the molasses. No problem. I will make again and again. The toffee is easy to chew, not hard as a rock.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make. The whole family loved it. Not rock hard like some recipes. I'll be making it again for the holidays.

Just took some of these to a dinner party as a hostess gift, & all agreed... delicious!! The only change I made was to use golden syrup instead of molasses. Oh & I didn't notice I was to save some of the nuts to use as a topping & instead dumped them all into the hot toffee mixture. I found it took about 35 minutes to reach the correct temperature, maybe because I stirred a little too vigorously, & cooled it down too much. One of the few times I've made a toffee mixture & not have it separate into a buttery liquid mess.

I am about to make my fourth batch of this and though it's all been given away, I have had to sample the little broken pieces -- yum! I also added vanilla and used a combination of hazelnuts, pistachios, pecans and almonds. Used Callebaut chocolate on top. So far, I've only gotten raves.

I was disappointed by this recipe. I followed the recipe, but halved it. The only alterations I made were to increase spices & chocolate by 50% & to use freshly toasted almonds. I did not use a candy thermometer (couldn't find it once I started!) but I am pretty experienced with toffee & I don't think this was a problem (texture is brittle, as it should be). I used very good dark chocolate, but felt there was not enough (even after my increase). I also cannot taste the spice at all. It's not a bad toffee, but I was expecting something more exciting after all these reviews.

I've made this toffee several times and it's always a hit! To add a little bit more texture, I find it's nice to pour some of the hot toffee into a bowl and combine it immediately with the chopped nuts - it makes them crunchy, sweet & salty. Also, I like to use dark brown sugar and dark molasses for a deeper flavor. Tried it with european butter (Plugra) and didn't taste a difference.

This is my second review for the recipe and it's definitely a four star (up from my previous three stars). I've made this several times and it draws oohs and aahs from friends and family unfailingly. I find the toffee turns out best when I use the nicest butter I can lay my hands on (european style cultured butter shines in this recipe) and good dark chocolate and freshly toasted nuts. I add a tsp of vanilla extract along with the allspice and it adds a nice undertone. And, I cook the mixture until it registers 300 F on my candy thermometer (hard crack stage) which makes for a toffee with more bite.

This was pretty good and it was fun to make! The hardest part was grating the chocolate. It made a mess. I'll def look for an easier way to do that. I used sliced almonds, chopped pecans and chopped hazelnuts. I want to try it with chopped cashews, pecans and Brazil nuts. I also have wasabi Macadamia nuts and Spanish peanuts that I think would be a great play off the toffee. Be creative and dont skimp on the chocolate!

Toffee perfection! I've made this recipe at least a dozen times over the years (experimenting with different kinds of nuts and chocolate) and it's always come out looking gorgeous and tasting incredible. This is the kind of recipe that I can count on to draw rave reviews from both my "meat-and-potatoes" traditional uncle *and* my "gourmet foodie" co-workers, as the flavors are complex and yet familiar. Don't leave out the allspice -- that's the best part!

Rating: 3
I don't know what it is, but the toffee tastes overly spiced to me - it could be that I ground fresh allspice and added a full quarter teaspoon as per the recipe, or it could be that I used regular molasses since those were the only kind I had at home. It's still pretty delicious and looks lovely, with green flecks of chopped pistachio on the top. The next time I try this out, I'll limit the allspice to an eighth of a teaspoon and either substitute the molasses with light corn syrup or get the light molasses that the recipe calls for. But I'd make it again for sure.

DO NOT USE WALNUTS! This is actually a very good recipe (or so I assume from the smell of the boiling toffee mix). However as soon as I added the nuts (walnuts) it turned into a disaster. The oil from the nuts flooded the candy, making it turn into chunks of oily candy floating in nut oil. It eventually solidified into a sheet of dry cookie textured toffee held together by solidified nut fat. It tastes like it sounds. I will definitely try this again with almonds, or with no nuts at all.

I made only 1/2 lb of this recipe- in other words 1/4 of the ingredients. The conversion worked beautifully, and much to my surprise, the toffee was quite delicious. As usual I made a few adjustments and added cinnamon and nutmeg instead of allspice, dark brown sugar instead of golden, and dark corn syrup in lieu of molasses. I used chopped pecans for the nuts. Also, I had no bittersweet chocolate, so melted unsweetened chocolate mixed with 4 tsp granulated sugar did the trick. Unfortunately it was a bit grainy so next time I'll be sure to use powdered sugar! Overall, delicious! However I might cut down on the butter next time.

This is by far the best toffee I have ever eaten or made. I have made it many times - at least 50 or more - and it always turns out great! I have to give it all away or I eat every last crumb.

It's hard to add to the praises given in previous reviews, though I would say I have been asked for this recipe probably more than anything else I've ever made. Of course, good friends know they'll get more at the holidays, and don't need to go through the trouble to make it themselves :-) I have never varied the recipe, since it's just so good as written. I will say I think good chocolate is worth the expense and effort. I love the way a good dark chocolate crisps back up when it cools. This is a recipe you will pass down through generations.

This toffee seriously rocks!!! I found that I needed a full bag of chocolate chips rather than just 5 oz. The recipe doubles easily, and as good as it is you might as well go ahead and do that! It's a beautiful candy and seriously addictive. I was afraid that the allspice would make it taste too "spicy" but it was subtle and perfect- very similar to a Heath bar in taste but so much yummier. I used canned salted mixed nuts and was afraid that the toffee would be too salty so I just cut the salt in half and it was perfect. I agree that finely chopping the nuts for the top is prettier. And definitely toast the nuts after chopping since they're so much more flavorful that way. You won't believe how easy and delicious this stuff is!

I made this candy last year for Christmas and thought it was ok although it really disappeared fast. I have had three people ask me if I was going to make it again this year. I will.

Made this for gifts over the holiday season. This was a huge hit and would recommned making it to anyone. It went quickly so be sure to make a second batch if you are giving it as a gift.

Like another reviewer, I made this w/o the allspice and substituted vanilla instead. Very Good taste and excellent texture and crunch. I would definately make these again. I was a bit hesitant about the molasses considering it's vile taste and smell, however, I think it was key to the right texture and was undetectable upon tasting the final product. Next time I would like to try the allspice version.

This turned out wonderful. For the chocolate I used Valrhona Le Noir 56% Cacao to make it extra special. This was very easy to make I included some in Christmas gifts. Everyone said that it was great.

This is absolutely wonderful!! I used a jelly roll pan (11x15). It worked perfectly.

This was really good toffee, though I did as some others and used vanilla for flavor rather than allspice. I'll try the allspice version sometime though. I used a 9x13 pan and the resulting toffee was too thick. I think a standard size jelly roll pan (11x15) would be much better. I also chopped the nuts for the top fine rather than course. Will definitely make this again.

Can someone tell me what size pan to use (more specific than "small rimmed baking sheet")? Thanks!

This toffee was amazing! I was lookingfor a more traditional flavored Skor or Heath bar toffee, so I omitted the spice elements. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract with the nuts (rough chopped almonds). It turned out perfectly and SO addictive. Next time I think I'll experiment with melting a combo of milk and semi chocolate together and spreading that on instead of the chips.

I've made the recipe 3 times this holiday season. It is very easy and delicious. People love it! I didn't add the nuts on top as there were enough within it for our taste. I used unsalted nuts and bittersweet chocolate. Easy for first time candy makers.

Really, a very easy thing to make! I used toasted, chopped hazelnuts, and did omit the allspice...it was fabulous! I made one batch with the nuts, and one without, and used semi-sweet chocolate chips on top. This will be a frequently used recipe, I'm sure!

This recipe is easier than it sounds and gets easier every time I make it. Even for a first time candy maker its great. Make sure to stay with the candy and stir the entire time, to remove from heat as soon as it reaches 290F. Also, once its removed from heat, work fast. The trick to this I found, was having all ingredients ready and measured beforehand. To make this a little quicker and cheaper, substitute 1 cup dark chocolate chips for the chopped chocolate. This has been a hit with all who have tried it.
