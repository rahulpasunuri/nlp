Delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not make the glaze. Instead, we ate it with strawberry ice cream. As other reviewers mentioned, this is a dense cake similar to pound cake. Everyone raved about this cake!

The recipe looked wonderful...all that butter, all those eggs. But this was the driest, most dense (& not in a good way) cake I've ever made or tasted. It smelled heavenly when I took it out of the oven, and I broke off a few pieces from the finished product...wow! Really good. But cooled...NOT good at all. I'm a better-than-average baker, and I think this turned out exactly as it was supposed to have...a coconutty doorstop.

I have just finished glazing this cake. This is the second time I have made it and what impressed me after the flavor and crumb was its keeping quality. Even after sitting at room temperature for a couple of days, this cake tasted as fresh and moist as the day I had baked it. I have not changed the recipe because I like how it has turned out as is.

My family loved, LOVED it! My favorite kind of any dessert is chocolate, then pumpkin, then coconut. But for the third favorite, it disappeared pretty fast. :) Totally making it again sometime. Best served with ice-cream or heavy, freshly whipped cream.

This is my favorite cake recipe! I make it into a 4-tier wedding cake and got fabulous results and reviews. I've used it for cupcakes, layer cakes with lemon buttercream, and bunt cake itself. It is very moist and luscious, and a staple in my cake recipe file.

This is a delicious cake to have with afternoon tea. I made it exactly as written in the recipe. It is a bit dry and dense, but the flavor is good. It is not too coconut tasting. My family liked it so I will make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and found the flavor to be excellent, but the texture a bit dense for my taste. I made it a second time, adding 3 tsp baking powder. I also separated the eggs, making a meringue out of the egg whites by adding 1/4 cup of the sugar and beating until stiff peaks formed. I gently folded the meringue into the batter at the end with the flaked coconut. I found that with this method, the cake retained its wonderful flavor, but took on a lighter texture that I found much more pleasing.

I had never made a coconut cake before and decided to give this recipe a try. I followed the recipe exactly, but probably did not use all the glaze on top. I toasted the coconut for the topping too. The cake turned out great with a very delicate taste. Not too sweet either. The whole family loved it.

This cake was a dud. I love this website and usually have great results, but this cake was very bland. If I made it again, I would increase the coconut extract to 2 tsp. I think that would help.

This cake delighted and surprised my guests, several of whom claimed not to like coconut and were hesitant to try a piece. I was doing a three selection dessert buffet and this one was the overwhelming favorite. I followed the recipe exactly and suggest you don't add the extra leavening some people do; it'll change the consistency and you want a nice, dense pound cake. Just remember not to overbake, and do toast the coconut you sprinkle over, better flavor.

This cake is delicious. The coconut glaze complements it perfectly. I didn't have the coconut extract, but actually used almond in its place. It turned out great!

If you like coconut or other tropical flavors, you will love this cake! It has become an office favorite. Great recipe just as the recipe is written. Made no changes. This will become my "signature" cake recipe for office and family events.

Very good cake. On top, to decorate I used toasted coconut (bake coconut and brown sugar in the oven) the second time I made. It's better than just coconut. Looks better and tastes and smells better with the toasted coconut. A good cake for tea and coffee parties..

I made recipe just as recipe stated, but did substitute lemon juice for coconut milk in glaze. Tartness is good counter to sweet cake. It is dense, like a pound cake. But I like that. Got rave reviews when I took it to work!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe with the baking powder/soda (as some have recommended) and exactly as the recipe states. Both ways received rave reviews! Without the leavening it is a denser cake (as a traditional pound cake is), and with the levening it is lighter, but just as delicious!!

This turned out to be a really great cake - very moist and great texture. I omitted the coconut extract (I didn't have any), however I'm sure the coconut flavor would be stronger if the coc. extract were used. I also added 3 tsp baking powder as others suggested to substitute for cake flour - also great. I thought the glaze was a bit 'gummy'; probably due to the coconut milk. I packed on the leftover coconut over the glaze and it made for a wonderful topping. I also think this recipe (w/o coconut) would make a great base cake/yellow cake but still using the coc. milk. Cuz I don't think the coc. milk itself is quite so intensely coc. flavor. All in all, great and easy cake!

Rating: 3
I added 3 tsp baking powder, used a bit less sugar and left out the coconut extract. I also added lime juice to the glaze. This made a lovely, dense cake (but not too dense) with the right touch of sweetness, and everyone loved it. This is a good (not great) recipe, and is a nice change from standard cake flavors.

Rating: 4
I think this recipe is just fine the way it is. Don't add baking soda because it prevents the crust from hardening, which is the best part. I add macadamia nuts to mine. When I do, it reminds me of Mrs. Field's coconut macadamia nut cookies! I've already made four variations of this cake!

I have made this twice and everyone loves it. I omit the coconut extract & use unsweetened coconut flakes from the "health food" store and it gives it a great texture. I added baking powder the second time and it turned out well (but it turned out well the first time too!)

Rating: 3
Relatively easy, and quite delicious without, to my or my family's taste, being cloyingly sweet. I didn't have any coconut (or other nut) extract, so I omitted it. Also, I had to substitute all-purpose for cake flour (minus 1T per cup).

This was my first bundt cake, and it turned out great. It's nice and moist, and the coconut flavor isn't too overpowering. I also opted to make a lemon-glaze instead. I doubled the glaze recipe amounts and substituted fresh squeezed lemon juice for the coconut milk in the glaze -- gives it a nice zing to balance the sweetness of the cake.

Very good cake, I had no coconut extract so substituted run extract. Baked in exactly the time specified, I used a 12 cup Bundt. I sprinkled toasted coconut over the glaze, looked very nice. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon baking soda to the flour and salt.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times now and it turns out beautifully every time. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp. baking soda for every cup of flour. I usually bake it in my 12 cup bundt pan but I recently baked it in individual mini bundt pans and they were so cute - perfect for a tea party.

I usually make myself a fresh coconut/lemon curd and whipped cream cake for my birthday so I was intrigued by the thought of making a cake that was a little less work. This was great! I only had a 10 cup bundt pan so I made the excess batter into cupcakes and frosted them with lemon curd. Instead of the coconut glaze, I used a lemon glaze from another epicurious recipe and drizzled it over the cake. If I did it again, I'd use even more glaze and drizzle it over the cake while it was warm. Nonetheless, it was the best bundt cake I've ever made.

Rating: 3
I just made this - it's still warm. I used a small portion of batter to make a mini-cake. It's so good! Added the baking powder (2tsp) and this cake is light and fluffy. Used 1/2 tsp almond extract along with others. Yum! One more thing: on the mini-cake, I sprinkled a little sugar with the flour when greasing the pan - made a nice little crisp texturaly thing. Still experimenting with the glaze. Maybe make a little white choc ganache and mix that with the coconut milk to glaze consistency? We'll see...

I made this recipe in a small (8") bundt pan, following the advice of others to add baking powder. I thought that since it was a smaller size pan I should bake it in half the time and I divided the recipe in half. It came out perfect. But it took 60 minutes (at 325). Great recipe. Should be perfect with vanilla ice-cream.

I made this for Easter and it was perfect! My husband, who says he doesn't like coconut, loved it. I added 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder as recommended - I will definitely do that again because the texture was perfect. I toasted the extra sweetened coconut in a small iron skillet before sprinkling on the cake and it was beautiful! Also, at the last minute I realized I was out of coconut extract so I used the same amount of almond extract. All other instructions I followed as they were written and the cake was beautiful and perfect - I was wishing I had had a party to show it off!

Rating: 4
I followed everyones advice and it was dang tasty. I added the baking powder, unsweetened coconut, 2 tsp. almond extract (I did increase the coconut extract to 3/4tsp), and 1/2c mini chocolate chips. It was a bit more batter than my bundt pan could handle so put the rest in a small pan. If I wasn't taking this to a family gathering I think my spouse and I would have dug into the big cake after eating the small one. However, butter and flour your pan, even if it is a nonstick one.

I love, love, love coconut, and decided to make this as is, without using the baking powder suggestions. I was quite disappointed. I baked the cake for only 60 minutes til done. I know pound cake is supposed to be dense; however, this cake was more than dense -- it was rubbery and very "eggy" tasting. I will not make it again. Other good coconut pound cake recipes are out there!

I have made this cake at my family's request for several years now. It was quite dense the first time, but very buttery and delicious. I took the advice of others the next time and added baking powder, which lightened it considerably. Now I have also taken to using unsweetened dessicated coconut for the cake batter, which cut down on the sweetness. This cake just gets better and better. Try it(with the suggested changes) and watch everybody freak out!!!

This cake is fabulous. I've made it twice so far and both times I have had requests for the recipe! I have to agree with the others in saying that it is dry but the second time around I added a bit less coconut milk and also took it out of the oven a little earlier. I'm always looking for new bundt cake recipes and this one is a keeper!

This cake is delicious! I'm not a huge coconut fan, but the flavor was amazing. The glaze is a little too sweet; next time I'll take the advice and try a chocolate glaze.

I had previously tried the recipe adding two teaspoons of baking powder and complained about the cake sticking and the texture being rubbery. I now find out upon re-reading the recipe that the problems may have been my own fault--I added all the coconut milk to the cake instead of saving some for the glaze. Anyway, I tried it again following the cake recipe exactly as written, and I liked it much better this time around. It was light and not dry at all; the coconut extract, coconut juice (is that the same as milk?), and flaked coconut gave it a good flavor.

This was AMAZING!!! The recipe needs a few tweaks, which I learned from reading the other reviews. But that is what makes this website so great; we learn from each other's experience in a free forum. I added 1.5 tsp baking powder, and set the oven to 325 degrees b/c my bundt cake pan is all black. I was sure to not only grease the pan, but flour it and I think that makes a difference. The next day I mixed the remainder of the coconut milk (3/4 cup) with 1 cup confectioners sugar and that was a perfect topping. And I also followed a reviewer's suggestion to top with shredded coconut that was browned in the microwave. You have to watch it carefully so that it doesn't go from brown to black, but it worked well. If you follow the few modifications from the '4 fork' people, you will find this to be a '4 fork' recipe, and so easy to make!

After reading through the recipe, I thought this would be a moist and delicious cake. WRONG. It was very dry and dense. Not sure anything would help it. Ice cream, perhaps, or a chocolate sauce, but I'd rather have the cake be moist on its own. I was very disappointed and, unfotunately, had made it for guests. Oops -- embarrassing!

I made this cake for Easter. It was great. Moist and not overly sweet. I decided to pass on the powdered sugar glaze and made some chocolate sauce to serve on the side. I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on the top to dress it up a bit. Everyone really enjoyed the cake more so without the sauce. Next time I'll make the powdered sugar glaze as the recipe suggests.

I made the recipe exactly as it appears above (well, I sifted the flour, too--old habits die hard). It is dense, but then, it is a pound cake. Pound cakes are supposed to be dense, it's their defining feature. It was delicious. Next time I'll make more of the glaze to go on it.

Just made the cake, and it smells and tastes fabulous. Couldn't even wait for it to cool - had to tear off a couple of bites to sample! Followed advice of others and added 2 tsp baking powder, also used 3 tsp of vanilla and omitted coconut extract. This recipe is definitely a keeper - better even than my mother-in-law's, bless her. Four forks indeed, [and I usually don't even LIKE coconut cake].

I followed the directions precisely, but it turned out way too dense. It was very moist, and the flavor was fine - not as coconutty as I had hoped, but good. I used a dark, non-stick bundt pan and cooked it at 350 for 60 minutes. Does anyone have any ideas as to why it was so dense and heavy?

This recipe sounds excellent. To the individual who provided the scathing review, I offer a few suggestions. First, the top of the cake burning could be due to the cake not being in the middle but closer to the top of the oven. Also, and more importantly, a Bundt pan with a dark exterior may require a 25 degree temperature reduction to keep both the bottom (exposed part) and the inverted finished product from becoming too dark. I hope this helps.

Definitely a winner. I would add one small ingredient, 2 teaspoons of almond extract which turn this cake into a real Almond Joy.

I'd give this 0 forks if that were an option. I made this exactly according to the recipe; baked it in the proper size pan; and baked it at the right temperature (I have an additional thermometer in my oven to be sure). Even with all of that, the bottom (exposed part) of the cake was _burning_ after 45 minutes, so I had to cover it with foil. Then, the cake itself took more than an hour and a half to bake--about 25 minutes longer than the recipe said--before it wasn't absolutely liquid in the center. Ultimately, I was left with a plain old dense pound cake--slightly flavored with coconut. Having once discovered the perfect, flawless recipes in Rose Berenbaum's _The Cake Bible_, I take full blame for this disasterous cake, for having ever adventured beyond the pages of Rose's book. Never again.

I considered 4 forks but I'm reserving that for something so extraordinary that I haven't tried yet! This cake was outstanding. I took someone else's advice and I added two teaspoons of baking powder. The cake remained very moist, but delightfully light in texture. I also took the advice of making the glaze thinner, with less sugar and more coconut milk (unsweetened!) One 13.5 oz can of coconut milk worked out perfectly. I used the recipe's one cup of coconut milk for the cake, and I had left about 3/4 cup to use for the glaze. When I added one cup of confec. sugar and one tablespoon of rum to the glaze, I thought the glaze was perfect. I topped the wet glaze with coconut toasted in the microwave. (watch it carefully, coconut goes from toasted to burned quickly) Finally, I made the cake on a Saturday morning to serve on Sunday afternoon, keeping it in an airtight container. It kept very well, and the very small remaining piece was still moist on Monday. This cake got raves at my "Hawaiian" brunch.

Definitely make half the glaze. I added a little lemon juice that gave a nice contrast to the sweet cake.

My 86 year old father loves coconut cake, so I decided to give this one a try. He liked it so much, he even had a piece for breakfast one morning. I made it again today to take to a church dinner tomorrow. This time I baked it in an angel food cake pan rather than a bundt pan - it turned out so pretty - and there was more area for the delicious glaze.

I made several bundt cakes for a party, and this one was the surprise hit: soft, moist, coconutty, and delicious. As many cooks do, I made changes, as follows: I could not believe that a cake recipe containing liquid would rise right without leavening, so I added 1 tsp baking powder per cup of flour, for a total of 3 tsps. I could not find coconut extract except for the artificial variety, so I left it out. Finally, I wanted a glaze with more taste than pure sweetness, so I used only 1 cup powdered sugar, & enough coconut milk to make a runny topping. It all worked very well, and we all loved the cake.
