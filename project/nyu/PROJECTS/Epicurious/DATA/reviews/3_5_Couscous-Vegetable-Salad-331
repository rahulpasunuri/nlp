When I first made the salad, I thought, "Meh, blah." However, after allowing it to soak and chill (following the instructions!) it suddenly became wonderfully tasty, with a nice variety of colors, textures, and flavors. Light, cheap, and really good.

This is very tasty and quite easy to prepare. I wanted to use Newman's parmesan vinaigrette, but since my store didn't carry it, I used Newman's light vinaigrette and added some parmesan cheese. This recipe triples well. (I used a whole box of Near East Couscous.)

This was great! Very fresh and easy to make- the cumin gives it a unique flavour. I followed the reviewers' advice, and used Paul Newman Parmesan vinaigrette.

Great little recipe. Thank to the reviewer who recommended the Parmesan Balsamic vinegarette, it was a perfect match! This is wonderful with left over roast lamb or chicken. And so easy!

Thanks to the reviewer who suggested using Paul Newman dressing -- it simplified the recipe and tasted great. I made a few additional changes that were a success: deleted zucchini and used grated carrot instead; added garbanzo beans; and used scallions in place of the red onions. I agree with the reviewer who recommended using less cumin. This was a big hit!

For being so quick and simple, this was an excellent (and also very pretty) side-dish. I would definitely make it again. I used Mexican squash in place of the zucchini, and PARMESAN BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE (also on this site) to replace the purchased olive oil vinaigrette. Next time I would down the ground cumin to 1/2-5/8 tsp., as I thought it was a bit strong on that flavor.

This is very light, tasty and easy to prepare. I've found that you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand... I substitued cucumber for the zuchini with great results, used carrots instead of red pepper and scallions in place of the red onion.

Very simple and delicious salad. To save time, I used a purchased bottle of olive oil vinaigrette (Paul Newman) and it turned out great. I will definately make this dish again.
