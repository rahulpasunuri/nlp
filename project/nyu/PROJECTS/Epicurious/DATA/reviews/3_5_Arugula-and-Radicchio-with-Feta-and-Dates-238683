I have to confess that I normally dislike radicchio and love arugula, but after receiving a head of radicchio in my CSA share, I decided to make this salad, thinking the peppery arugula would mask the bitterness of the radicchio. To my surprise, the salad was a perfect balance of salty, sweet, bitter and tangy. The only change I made was to use grilled halloumi cheese, rather than feta, and I recommend that you do the same! I can't imagine that feta would have been any better.

this was just OK, maybe I did something wrong....

This is a delicious and easy salad. Added a little Dijon mustard and fresh rosemary to the vinaigrette.

Cut back on the oil and this is yummy-also try subbing strawberries or roasted figs for the dates to change things up- simple and good!

I have been looking for recipes using arugula since I have a good crop of arugula in my garden this year. I didn't have any radicchio, so I used thinly sliced green cabbage instead. This was a very tasty salad - probably with a bit too much "personality" if you're an iceberg lettuce kinda person.

I thought this was a nice salad. I used dried Mission figs instead of dates and red leaf lettuce (my arugula had turned and this is all I had). It was very good this way. I served it with grilled London Broil and the Cinnamon Orzo listed in the same issue.

I had this on my radar from the time I got the magazine. It looked really good and when I made it, it was! Since we are watching calories & fat, I decreased the amount of olive oil by 1/3 and added a few (very few) chopped kalamata olives (because my husband loves them). It was everything I was hoping for! Definately a keeper.

I had higher expectations for this, thinking this combination of ingredients had to be amazing. It was good but next time, I'll add candied pecans (melt brown sugar and a little butter and throw in some pecans). I think that may bring it to four forks for me. Or maybe just toasted pine nuts...
