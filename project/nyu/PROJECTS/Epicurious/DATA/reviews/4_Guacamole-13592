It's tough finding a really good guacamole recipe, but this one wins! Didn't change a thing and it was a huge hit. Saving this to my recipe box to use again and again.

Use a little more lime juice than called for by the recipe... mmmm!

This recipe is good, basic. I placed chunks of onion and avocado in food processor and pulsed until well blended. Also, I added two plum tomatoes, finely chopped, for color. Will add more cilantro next time.

Fan-flippin-tastic! This is the first time I have made guac and it was epic! I loved this recipe. I will make it again and again. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the onion into a smaller dice and perhaps add less of it. The onion can overwhelm the flavour if you add too much. Try this guacamole!

I omitted the jalapeno and pureed all the ingredients in food processor for a smooth guac. Overall it was okay, but I think it needs less onion, more lime, more garlic, and maybe some cilantro. I like a bit more zip.

I normally use red onions, chopped finely, and add some tomato for color. Very good recipe. As a note: cumin isn't neccessary.

this is my favorite guacamole recipe and it always gets rave reviews. i like to add extra lime juice and only use a half an onion. i also dice the onions and jalapenos really small so you aren't overpowered by the flavors.

I had to omit the jalapenos and cilantro because of guests' preferences, but it was still really good. I used red onion -- delicious.

it's a very good basic recipe ... few alterations to make it perfect ... reduce amount of anions to half I'd say, add a table spoon of extra virgin olive oil, and a finely chopped tomato to the mix .. Buen Provecho!!

good basic recipe....i used red onions...added halved tiny cherry tomatoes. i think i'll omit the garlic next time as i found the flavor too strong (i generally love garlic.) i also added a bit of good quality olive oil, don't know why but i think it added to the unctious quality of the dish. enjoy!

Easy, excellent recipe. Instructions say it should only be made 2 hrs ahead, but I've made it the day before, and it's just as delicious that way.

Its excellant but i added sea salt and cilantro for a more robust flavor.

I added tomato and didn't think the recipe needed garlic, I think the onion is enough! I will definitely make guacamole again and thought this recipe was a good base.

I doubled the recipe for a party with a bunch of my girlfriends but otherwise followed everything. Tip for the onions: grate them with a box grater. It's a little intense with the tears, but it's fast and really gets a good texture and pervasive flavour in the guac. The bowl was practically licked clean.

Added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of a jalepeno (though next time I'll do both). Fresh cilantro, and a diced tomato make this a fantastic recipe.

Used red onion instead of white, and didn't bother mashing the garlic into a paste...everyone raved, and had a few say it was the best guacamole they had ever had.

Great recipe! Added another clove of garlic, a whole lime's worth of juice, heavier on the cumin. Also, add a seeded plum tomato and half a can of mexican corn for taste and texture. Was super at a Super party!

Rating: 4
This is a super simple and wonderfully tasty recipe. I usually don't rate recipes unless I follow them exactly. However, this recipe is such a good base, it is hard not to alter a bit. I added a small seeded tomato and reduced the jalapeno by 1/2 (though I wouldn't do this next time). I think mashing the garlic into a paste was vital to the flavor. Fast, tasty and nice for company.

Great recipe! Used 1 tablespoon ground coriander. I mixed in all the ingredients and added the avocados last. I'll definitely make this one again, maybe adding the tomatoes next time.

I left out the jalepeno and coridander, as I didn't have them on hand. Still very yummy! I'm extremely picky about my guacamole and I thought that this recipe was excellent. Only complaint is that is was a little too salty- especially when served with tortilla chips that already have salt on them. Minor changes: added an extra clove of garlic and an extra teaspoon of lime juice, plus a small handful of diced tomatoes. Will definitely make again, but with half the salt.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe and I will use it again and again. Some added tomato gives it great color and helps balance out the flavors!

I make this quac all the time and people can't get enough of it. The cumin and fresh cilantro are a must! Also, if you can find it, go to an Asian market and find a jar of Chinese roasted garlic paste. It's already mashed with some salt and can save you a lot of time for recipes calling for garlic paste.

I have made this recipe MANY times for all sorts of occasions, always with rave reviews. Mashing the garlic with the salt using a mortar and pestle is key. As others have suggested, finely minced red onion really enhances this recipe.

Rating: 3
I also like mine chunkier, so didnt mash too much -added another chopped avocado for even more chunk. Minced red onion instead of white and left out the coriander(not fond of that flavor). Used 2 garlic cloves. This was so danged yummy and was gone in a flash.

Rating: 3
I made this without the jalapeno because my friends and I are wusses when it comes to spiciness. We thought it needed more salt, and I added some ancho chili powder to make up for some of the lost flavor but all in all, this was a fantastic recipe. Perfect, simple guacamole.

Rating: 4
Simple as can be and, as long as you pick good avocados, really fresh and splendid. I also added a handful of choppedgrape tomatoes-about the same amount of tomato as onion in mine-doubled the cumin, put a touch of ground coriander seed (not cilantro leaves) in it, and used 3 avocados, one left a bit chunkier than the others intentionally. The garlic paste is, for this, hummus, and many other dips, essential in my opinion. I just take a garlic press, shove the peeled clove in, and then mash the pressed garlic with sea salt (for recipes that don't require cooking, that is; otherwise, plain morton is fine)-very easy that way. I used the juice of 2 fresh squeezed limes, which was just right since I already had some acid from tomatoes. It's really difficult to mess this up as long as you don't cheat and stick it in a blender, which has ruined guacamole every time I've knowingly had it made that way.

Different from the smooth guacamole I eat in some Mexican restaurants. The additional ingredients add nice flavor. I made it for company, and my husband liked it so much he asked me to make it again the next day for his birthday. In the future - I might add one more avocado, and I might reduce the onion and lime juice. I'd also like to try the other reviewers suggestion to add chopped tomatoes.

Rating: 3
Simple and deliciously addictive guacamole. I made this recipe with great success using the following (minor) changes: two mashed and one diced avocado (because we like it chunky), one *white* onion, two cloves of mashed garlic, 1/2 t. cumin, 2 seeded & diced roma tomatoes, the juice of 3 large limes and a large handful of chopped fresh cilantro. Yum - it was gone in no time. This will be my new standard recipe.

LOVING IT!!! I used 3 avocados and half and onion with a full cup of cilantro. We didn't use garlic or jalepeno but we did use chili powder. Terrific. Ole!

Excellent. The only difference was I added two small plum tomatoes, discarding the seeds and chopped. I substituted the coriander with cilantro. Otherwise, I wouldn't changge a thing.

this was yummy! i used 1/2 small red onion (i think a whole onion is a bit much), about 1/2 a fresh jalapeno and juiced a whole lime...i did cheat a little and added a couple tablespoons of the Frontera Grill ( you can get it at C&B) guacamole mix because i like the tomatillo taste.

Very good. However I would not use avacado that are too ripe. It tasted delicious but the consistency was off. It was creamy and not chunky

Surprisingly good. Normally, I use fresh chiles and cilantro, but was out of both, and had to use some ripe avocados. So I followed this recipe and liked it a lot.

Rating: 3
Other reviewers are commenting on past problems with oxidizing. I've never had this problem; it's the lime juice that keeps the avocado from browning. As long as you use the lime, there is no need for the avocado pit. Also, I don't mean to be a guacamole snob, but I think using sour cream really bastardizes the dish. It's not so much an issue of authenticity - I'm talking about taste here. Sour cream does not go in guacamole, and this guacamole certainly doesn't need it.

Thought this would last me all weekend, but I ate it all myself in one day. It was addictive, and since it was so easy, I'm looking forward to making it again soon.

Great standard recipe, and easy to vary to taste. I like cummin so that was a plus. Easy enough for any occasion. I will probably try some variations each time for fun.

I'm disappointed. After reading all the reviews, I was ready for a quacomole that was going to "knock my socks off". It's was good but my socks didn't move. I've had and have made better. I followed the recipe. After I tasted it, I decided to take the suggestions given and add some sour cream and then tossed in some Roma tomatoes. Now I think I'm going to take Mechanicsvilla's idea and just dump salsa on top of it. Why not?

Rating: 3
I'd take it easier with the onion. The recipe is very good. I'd like to stress, however, the importance of using a "mortero" or Cuban/Puerto Rican "wood masher" instead of food-processor or forks. This makes the avocado turn pasty not as if chopped. I'd also not use too much onion. A whole chopped onion makes the contrast between the consistency of the pasty avocado way too much. Loved the coriander tang.

Rating: 4
A great standby. Everyone loves it. I added some sour cream and a dash of red wine vinegar. While I don't know to what to attribute it, this is the first guacamole that did not oxidize on me.

Wow! Who knew that guacamole could be so easy to make with such fantastic results?! I followed the recipe except I did add a chopped tomato from our garden. I think my husband and I ate all but a half a cup of this in one sitting. Very flavorful!

Really great recipe with a wonderful taste. I omitted the cumin (it can be overbearing and leave a bad after-taste), added a tomato for color contrast and used a sweet onion and it was delicious!

Rating: 4
This is a DEEElicious dip! We dipped tortilla chips in "hot" picante salsa first then scooped up some of the guacamole on the chip - TRY IT! We are going to serve this excellent dip at the next get together we have! I think it will work to put the guacamole in a dipping bowl and pour Salsa over it. Then everyone can dip their chips into it easily.

Great recipe! It was a huge hit at a party. I did make some changes. I ran short on the fresh coriander (which tasted strong enough at a little more than half what is called for), doubled the pepper and added diced tomato and a little sour cream. I was told the sour cream along with the lemon juice would help prevent oxidation.

I have made this many times and it is very popular with my guests. I don't use the pepper, but that is personal preference.

agree with everyone who say this is a great recipe. i added cilantro, 2 diced tomatoes and some asian chili pepper. i didnt think the onion, jalapeno and garlic was too much at all. very tasty. i ended up spending a decent amount of time in preparation though, finely chopping, juicing (using hands), mashing (no garlic press), etc.

Very good! When preparing, I was concerned that there was going to be too strong of an onion flavor, but it turned out great! I used a vidalia onion. I skipped the jalapeno because I didn't have any gloves handy (and I've made the mistake before of preparing jalapeno WITHOUT gloves). It was delicious! (Remember to put the avacado pits in the bottom of the bowl to keep the dip from turning brown.)

Rating: 4
This is the best recipe for guacamole! I think the onion problem can be solved by using eating, not cooking, onions. Use scallions, red onions, or sweet eating types like Vidalia, since you're eating them raw. Some cooking onions are just too strong for this. Use a garlic press to make mincing easy. I add all the ingredients suggested and one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to give a nice consistency. If you don't have fresh coriander lying around, buy the chopped (fresh) kind that comes in jars and add less, maybe two teaspoons-full. This is great for pregnant women in first trimester especially (believe me, I was craving guacamole every day for a while and then I realised why), or if you're planning to be pregnant, because avocados are an excellent source of natural folic acid! So enjoy!

Best guacamole I've made. I cut down a bit on the onion, didn't put in the jalapeno or coriander, but added diced tomato. Excellent.

Rating: 1
Ineatible! There is way, way too much onion, and even though I only used half of a jalapeno that was too much as well! I tried to save it and added some cherry tomatoes that I had and in desperation some sour cream to try and mellow the onion. As a last resort my husband suggested adding a little sugar. That helped with the finish, but it was still not good! I am so disapointed!

This is the best guacamole I've ever made... it's the cumin! Fast, fabulous and better than the Jan '98 version, which I've tried and rated. Tip: leave an avocado pit in the dip so it won't go brown - it really works. Also, try adding a seeded, chopped tomato. Enjoy!
