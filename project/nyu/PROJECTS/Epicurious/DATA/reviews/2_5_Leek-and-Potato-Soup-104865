It is obvious the author of the recipe is aware of the rules of kashrut as she or he said "margarine or butter." Anyone who keeps kosher would know to choose parve margarine. The other dairy suggestions came from reviewers, who have no obligation to follow the rules of kathrut. People need to read more carefully.

This is not kosher in the least learn to cook passover food before you make yourself look like a fool to the jewish community. You cannot mix any dairy and meat products whatsoever they cant even be on the same table.

I actually didn't find this so easy to make. Lots to puree--many batches, and for pretty bland soup. I added spicy chicken sausage and a bit of vinegar. We'll see tomorrow if that helps.

Good recipe, I prefer chives to parsley. To "A Cook in Los Angeles"- yes it's kosher! Anyone that keeps kosher would know to use kosher margarine or rendered chicken fat instead of butter. The dairy others mention is not in the original recipe but was their own addition.

great recipe. Used the bone marrow but did not separate and add back into the puree, as it has an unpleasant, lumpy texture. Better to simmer it with the broth only for the best effect. Also I separate out a 1/4 of the potatoes before puree-ing, and then add back into the final soup so the soup has some different consistency.

This was fantastic, great flavor. I didn't use the bones or marrow, I just boiled chicken stock with some celery stalks instead. Pretty easy to make.

It's a little bit weird that under the subcategory of "Jewish Cooking," you include a recipe that violates the most basic tenets of kosher cooking by combining dairy and meat in the form of cream and chicken broth. Interested readers should consult Jewish cookbooks by Joan Nathan, Helen Nash, Judy Zeigler, et. al. for real Jewish recipes instead.

Actually, Cambridge, butter would be a no-no to any kosher household since meat and dairy are NEVER to be combined. This was a good recipe but not great. There are other better recipes out there (on this website!)

Saute leek & onion. add potato to pot w/broth. Boil. stir in remaining ingredients

Great soup. Rave reviews from everyone at Thanksgiving. I didn't puree all of the soup, only part of it, which I liked better. Delicious!

This soup was mild but satisfying. I spiced it up just a bit with some white pepper and served it with sourdough bread. Yummy.

to the cook from new york on 3/12: the recipe calls for "butter or margarine" -- so obviously one would use the margarine when preparing it for passover.

This seems like a good recipe, but I want to voice a concern about something other than its quzlity. Since it is offered as part of a menu for a Jewish holiday observance -- one in which food is a paramount part of the ceremony -- it should not so explicitly non-kosher, which this one is! It combines butter (dairy) with meat -- one of the fundamental prohibitions of the kosher system!
