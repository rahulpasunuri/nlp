I used coconut flakes instead of canned coconut, it turns out drier this way.

In retrospect it was my oven that caused the problem. I recently tried it again-- I did reduce the sugar a little (by a quarter), and used coconut milk rather than regular milk. It set up fine this time with the baking time given. Very tasty, very coconutty.

Guess that it wasnt the "Yankees" that had a hard time. The pie actually worked for me and was great! Wasnt as firm as i would have liked but i have a sweet tooth

I baked the pie for an hour and a half at the suggested temperature- it still wasn't firm, but neither was it runny. Moist (from all that coconut, I suppose). Almost syrupy, in fact- I would reduce the sugar by half next time, or use unsweetened coconut. It was REALLY sweet.

I had problems finding a "can" of coconut. Any other substitutions work? I also found it very runny.

Following these directions, the pie was inedible. Definitely needs more cooking time, it was runny in the middle.

Not enough information about pie, and how to make a topping. Not everyone knows this and it needs to be explained. How long do you let the pie cool? In frig or counter?

Haven't made the pie yet, but am going to do it today. Sounds great!
