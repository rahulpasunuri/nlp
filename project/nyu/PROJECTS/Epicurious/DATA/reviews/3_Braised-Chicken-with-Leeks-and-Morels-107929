Not bad. The sauce was a little bland and the morel flavor is lost. I cooked the chicken much less (5min side 1, 3 side 2, 8 min of simmering) and it came out tender and flavorful. Next time, I'd use less expensive mushrooms and more of them, and probably add some lemon juice.

I actually rate this recipe 4 stars, but it needed some really key timing adjustments, and maybe a different pan type. We used a large iron skillet so the chicken could all lay in a single layer. As for timing... browning the chicken... to get a really rich base you need to brown it longer than 6 minutes per side. We went double that time to get it very brown. Then, it doesn't hurt to add more wine. We put in a cup. More on timing.... 40 minutes, covered, is long enough to cook the chicken, but not long enough to really develop the sauce. We took the lid off at 40 minutes and let it cook down for at least another 20-30 minutes. If you adequately season the chicken in the beginning you probably don't need to add any additional salt at the end. Finally... rice? I don't think so. We served this with great northern beans and spinach sauteed with shallots and garlic, and pumpernickel bread. Turned out excellent.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is one of our favorite. Great recipe.

I'm sorry to say we found this bland rather than subtle. My only recommendation would be to eliminate the morels. The earthy taste is actually off the zen of the dish. We are unlikely to make this again.

Definitely a bland dish. Very happy that we did NOT waste morels on this. We used a basic dried mushroom mix (Trader Joe's) plus fresh mushrooms. Next time: Double the herbs, add salt & pepper liberally, serve with bread not rice, and the key: add pancetta to the leek saute. Bacon saves the day.

This is a waste of Morels... they lose all flavor when cooked this long. I used a chicken given to me by a local farmer & it, at least, turned out awesome. Reduced the sauce & it was wayy too salty so stuck in raw potatoes to remove some of the salt. The morels were just squishy salty things. And I love morels. I dumped in some half & half hoping to salvage the sauce. Not sure if I did.

No "punch" to this dish. Floured chicken but otherwise prepared as written. It was an anticlimatic use of $13 of morels. I will make again, but not without adding some significant 'other' flavoring like shallots and maybe making the broth richer with butter and some cream. I would use less pricey mushrooms, too.

SO GOOD!!! So easy, used baby bella mushrooms, it was wonderful. My husband can't wait for me to make this again. Nice winter weekend dinner.

Served this dish for a dinner party and it was easy and delicious. The chicken came out very, very tender. Did not realize how expensive dried morels were ($18 for 1 ounce. The dish calls for 1/2 ounce) but in the end, it was worth it.

A great use of morels in season.

I floured the skinned, boned chicken before browning, and added extra fresh mushrooms. This is easily one of the most delicious dishes I have ever made. Smells like a dream.

I left out the morels completely to let the flavor of the leeks determine the dish. My friend and I loved it and its a very pretty dish to serve.

I made it with bone-in chicken breasts and it was fantastic. The kids loved it.

This was a delicious dish. My husband raved and had seconds. I added some sliced fresh mushrooms along with the morels and I floured the chicken before browning to help make a thicker sauce. Served with orzo pasta. Great winter dish.

This is very good. I don't generally have morels on hand so I use a combo of dried porcinis and fresh button mushrooms. I've also made this when I didn't have 4 leeks, so I rounded it out with chopped scallions and/ or shallots. Also, consider flouring the chicken parts (add salt & pepper to flour) before browning. I also saute the leeks and mushrooms before adding liquids and add a bit of the seasoned flour to the leek mixture near the end of saute. Simmer for 25 mins. at most.

This is an excellent rustic dish. Try rehydrating the mushrooms in chicken broth for added flavor. Simple to make, and looks beautiful.

My expectations were higher. I found the sauce surprisingly bland. It wasn't bad, but it didn't excite me.

This recipe was fantastic- even if I did make a few modifications:I used dried shitake mushrooms instead of morels, dried thyme instead of fresh, and I served the chicken and sauce over some creamy grits.Yumm!

This is a great savory weekday dish. It does take some time to prepare from start to finish, but is easy and simple. The morels give it a wonderful flavor. I used boneless skinless filets cut into large pieces and they turned out tender and juicy. definately serve with crusty baguette to soak up the yummy juice.
