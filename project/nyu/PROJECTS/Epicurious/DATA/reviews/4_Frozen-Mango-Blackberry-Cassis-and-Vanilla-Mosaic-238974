So easy to make and my guests loved it. I used 2pints of blackberries 1/3 cup sugar and 3 tbs cassis. Unfolding takes practice

I choose this recipe to take to a friends house that has gluten allergies. I personally was not that impressed with this recipe. It was good, not great. I do recommend if you make it, that you double the blackberry sauce because the mosaic served with this on top saved it from being rather boring. That being said, everyone was impressed by its beauty!

I served this at a ladies' book club lunch and everyone wanted the recipe. It definitely made a good impression. In my experience the recipe serves 8 -10. I made a second dessert using raspberry, and mango sorbet along with vanilla ice cream. The raspberry seemed too sweet. There is something about the mango combined with the blackberry sauce that is unusually wonderful! I also made extra sauce as suggested in other reviews. This is an easy and wonderful dessert especially for the summer months.

WOW! So easy and so good! Not to mention BEAUTIFUL! Perfect for a hot summer night! One addition: to make it more 'cake like' I put a one inch thick layer of pound cake on the top before I put in the freezer so that when I took it out to serve and flipped it over - it would be ice cream/sorbet on top with cake on the bottom. BIG HIT!

Truly one of the biggest dessert winners I have ever made. My guests have literally gasped when I serve this.

Excellent,my new summer favorite! So easy to make & a great combo of flavors. Doubled the sauce to use for other desserts, such as over pound cake & vanilla ice cream. A great surprise & a keeper!

Worked exactly as promised - a bit expensive to assemble, but beautiful to present.

Foolproof and fast. Tastes as good as it looks, and gets lots of compliments.

If you need a super simple show- stopper, this is it. I consider myself a somewhat accomplished baker, but when I have no time, this is it. The peeps are always wowed.

This does look and taste delicious. It's worth the scooping and dropping!

This is a great dessert. I've made it several times, recently for a group of very savvy diners. This time I made twice the amount of blackberry sauce and used the extra to decorate the slices. I also made a whipped cream flavored with cassis and sprinkled toasted almond slices over hte top. It got raves!

After making it the first time, I used raspberry sorbet instead of vanilla ice cream and thought it tasted much better, more refreshing, and a prettier color combo. The sauce is great, I agree, make extra and drizzle over each slice.

A total showstopper that couldn't have been easier to make. After doing it once, I can see how this recipe could be could be made in lots of different variations. Will definately make again and again!

I followed the recipe and everything came out perfectly. Seems like a nearly fool- proof recipe and is beautiful and delicious. I made a double batch of the blackberry mixture. Used 1/2 in the mosaic, as directed. Used 1/2 to drizzle on the plate before putting each slice on top. Saved a few blackberries for garnish alongside an amaretto cookie. If the dessert is hard to get out of the loaf pan, dip briefly in hot water.

I made this and was sure it would not work out --everything was so soft after 45 minutes that I was sure the ice cream and sorbet and blackberry sauce would run into one another and instead of a beautiful mosaic of distinct colours, I would be left with an unappetizing vaguely purplish mess. Well, I'm writing this in case anybody else has similar misgivings as they make this: it worked out perfectly, looked exactly like the photograph and was delicious and won rave reviews from those I made it for. The blackberry-creme de cassis sauce is sublime, and next time I'll double that part of things.

Very easy to make; everyone enjoyed it at our 4th bbq. i used a raspberry balsamic sweet/sour dessert sauce purchased at Sur Le Table to spoon lines across each slice and that made it extra delicious. Served with homemade pecan sandy cookies. Would probably be good using the blackberry sauce with raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream or other combos as desired.

I made this tonight for a fourth of July barbecue. It was simple to make, beautiful, and delicious. I used frozen blackberries which saved a step of freezing them slightly until the ice cream was softened. It made extra sauce that way which I used to garnish the plate before I put the slice down. You can also put a slice of fresh mango and a fresh berry or two next to the slice for added visuals. I used an expandable loaf/ terrine pan which made the removal really easy.
