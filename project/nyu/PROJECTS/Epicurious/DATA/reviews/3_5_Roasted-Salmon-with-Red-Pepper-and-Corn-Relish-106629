I loved the glaze for the salmon. Served the rest on the side and would try it with other fish, too. The corn relish was OK but felt like it needed something. I added a few dashes of curry powder which I liked but prefer my old favorite of corn, black beans, cumin and cilantro.

This was ok, fine for an easy weeknight dish. We found the rub to be a bit bland so next time I'll try punching it up a notch by cutting back on the oil, adding some more lemon juice and adding some cayenne, or some smoked spanish paprika. We did like the use of the coriander. The relish was quite good and I would probably make that again.

The salmon comes out beautifully every time. The corn relish is very colorful... The next time I make the relish I will cut down on the honey a bit...

Loved it! Great use of seasonal veg. Made as directed, except substituted frozen corn and ground coriander, while reducing the amount of oil in the glaze.I did add a smidgen of cayenne to the salsa. I thought both the salsa and salmon were very tasty and the composed dish is pretty as a picture and restaurant quality. Prep time wasn't too bad, considering the lovely results. A keeper!

Delicous recipe that is easy to do. We had some last minute guests over for dinner and were able to whip this up in about an hour. We used a little bit of cayenne pepper instead of paprika. The relish was definitely what made this dish stand out. We served the salmon with some whole wheat mushroom cous cous, a side of spinach salad, and a great bottle of 2007 Lynmar Pinot Noir.

This was by far the best fish I've ever cooked without using the grill. However, though it was good, the flavors were a little too bland for me. Next time, I'll add a smidgen of cayenne.

Pretty good. Salsa keeps well for a few days refrigerated and is nice to have pre-made to just heat and put together with a steamed, baked, barbq'd, whatever-works-quickly salmon when in a pinch.

Rating: 3
Nice dish. I wanted to make it a little mild so skipped the garlic and the wine. Browning the corn makes it really sweet-the wine was not what I was looking for- simplified the peppers also; just julienned and added them to the corn without all the previous prep. Delish! Easy to make for a crowd and everyone really liked it.

I cater a luncheon for a Senior Citizen organization once a month. I served this recipe and they loved it...said they'd like to have it again (this isn't usual). The only alteration to the recipe was that I used jarred roasted peppers.

Definitely a fresh way to do salmon. Like others, I marinated for a few hours in the sauce before introducing the fish to the barbecue. I used Steelhead but this would work well with any type of salmon. Probably better with river salmon than atlantic.

Rating: 3
The only thing that kept me from giving this 4 forks is that the prep can be a touch tedious, but I'm a little scattered in the kitchen sometimes so that may just be me. Otherwise, I think it's fantastic. I love, love, LOVE the flavors of the honey and coriander seeds together and the relish is great even by itself as a side dish for other things. My mother- in-law and I made this in 2- inch "bite size" pieces to serve at a luncheon buffet and that worked really well too and got many compliments from the guests.

Rating: 4
It is a fantastic recipe. I used basil instead of parsley and cooked the salmon on the grill. There was some left over (only because two of the guests had to cancel) so the left over, relish and all, went into a green salad the next day. That was one of the best salads I have ever had!

I made this recipe last night. It was very tasty. A few alterations to the recipe were made: Grilled the fish using wood chips (hickory-very good smoky flavor), marinated fish 30 minutes, cooked relish with fresh diced red pepper, used ground coriander, used sake (no white wine available). I think grilling is the way to go! I could not taste the marinade. But I loved the smoke flavor! And the relish with the sake was good. Next time I would cook the bell pepper first then add the corn and onions (corn was overcooked). I will definitely make it again.

Family and friends thought this was wonderful. I think marinating the salmon for at least an hour makes all the difference. Even better the second day.

Very good. We found it a little bit too sweet so we served it on top of rice that was flavored with some Chili Oil to balance the sweetness of the corn relish.

I took the advise of a few people before me and I did marinade the salmon first for about 2 hours and it really made a difference,as well I added about 3 more tbsp of honey...10 minutes is all it took.....with the relish I did use frozen corn and the flavour was quite good...... everyone LOVED the salmon.I will do this one again it is a winner.

Served at a dinner party of 12, the dish was easy and didn't require much last minute attention save roasting the fish. We followed the recipe closely--although cooked the corn a little longer to brown it a bit--and enjoyed the results. A good preparation for good fish and fresh vegetables.

Had this for a dinner party at my weekend cabin - had to "pinch hit" on a couple of steps (just used cumin) didn't have the coriander seeds or a grinder there. Also used cooking oil in the marinade - then sent my husband out for olive oil. It turned out great anyway (so I don't think you can screw this up). Did cook the salmon (which I marinated about 10 minutes as suggested)on the grill. Everyone raved over how moist it was - will do again!

I didn't roast the peppers - I diced them and cooked them with the green onions and corn. It had a fresh crunchy taste. Also, don't waste your time making this with farmed salmon - it just doesn't have enough flavor.

Bland. It needs lots more salt and some "umph", like jalepenos or something. I don't know why, but the corn got too chewy.

I cut the salmon in pieces and made skewers. Let them marinated overnight and it was a succes in a barbeque. I add red onions to the relish.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I followed some advice from previous reviews and marinaded the salmon for a while before cooking. I did not find it to be too bland, nor did my husband. I also made the relish in advance. I'm glad I did because I did not care for the taste right after it was made. However, after several hours in the refrigerator it tasted very good.

Rating: 4
I had dinner for 8 and made this - it was a huge success. I left out the wine and made a bit more of the sauce for the salmon so it could marinate a bit. The 10 minutes is serious - I didn't believe it and left it in for 15 and it was a tiny bit dry. I propped up the 4 peppers like a little bon fire on my gas range and turned them periodically while I was cooking and they roasted beautifully. That was WELL beyond my usual efforts! I'll make this again soon!

I gave it a 2 as is, but add chipotle peppers to the glaze and it is definitely a 4.

Made this for a colleague wedding shower. Guests included a pastry chef. All are quite ingredient and calorie conscious. What a hit! Now, the guests are all making this for their families. Of course, grilled everything which may add that little extra that a few folks say is otherwise lacking. (we do not eat McDonald's here, despite the corporate headquaters.)

The relish is delicious, but the salmon lacked seasoning. When I make it again, I will season the salmon a bit more and grill it instead of roasting it in the oven. Served w/herbed basmati rice and a spring mix salad---guests loved it. Nice healthy recipe. Great make-ahead dinner for guests.

To the cook from Burlington without a gas stove...here's how to do your peppers. Cut them in half, take out seeds and flatten the pepper out. Put under broiler and watch carefully. When blackened, put in paper bag to steam, then peel. Easier than doing them over a gas burner

We are trying to eat more fish and this added some variety to my usual "throw it on the grill" method. I cheated and bought roasted peppers and did not use the corriander seeds at all. Served with brown tice, it was beautiful, healthy and delicious.

I'm not a huge salmon fan (I wish I was, it's so healthy for you), but my husband adores it, and the corn relish sounded so good I decided to give it a try. I only made two salmon filets so I cut down the recipe for that, but I just halved the corn relish recipe deciding to make it more of a side dish. The glaze was delicious and made even me like the salmon, I put the salmon under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end to crisp up the glaze, and the relish I intend to make again with other recipes, it was all very good.

If you crush coriander seeds WELL in your pepper mill and chop parsley or cilantro very fine you will find the relish has a nicer texture. I made that small change the second time I made this recipe. After you have made it once it comes together faster. Worth the effort.

I loved this recipe. I order salmon out at least once a week, and found this to be better than most I have had. It took a while to prepare the first time, but it will be easier the next time. I would cut the fresh thyme by about 1/3 - it was fairly strong flavored.

Rating: 2
The salmon glaze didn't caramelize by the time the fish was done when cooked according to the recipe. Try adding less oil to the glaze, maybe half the reccomended amount. I wouldn't make this again because the combination of flavors did nothing to enhance the flavor of the salmon.

This dish is a great way to prepare salmon. Having just moved to Seattle, my husband and I were anxious to try this recipe. I followed this recipe exactly and grilled the salmon on a cedar plank. It was delicious. The relish is worth the effort.

Rating: 3
Nice salmon dish. I didn't skin the salmon, though. 30 seconds skin side down in a hot poele with a little oil just to make the skin crispy - then roast it (a little less than 10 minutes). I believe that so few fish have appetizing skins, so why not take advantage of the delicious salmon skin (when cooked right). I plated this dish with a shallow ring mold of the relish and the salmon on top - skin side up, of course!

Rating: 3
I loved this dish. It's great for summer. I made my own roasted red peppers, but you could use pre-made ones just as well i'm sure. The only thing I would change are the toasted WHOLE coriander seeds. You end up getting a lot of the hulls in your mouth, it drove my husband crazy and you end up with a pile of "shells" at the side of your plate-no thanks. I think next time I'll use ground coriander, still toast it in a dry pan, but cut the amount by half or so to adjust for the lack of hulls.

Great recipe! Like the other reviewer said, using roasted peppers from a jar saves time. I've noticed that it's about the same cost as fresh peppers, too, because red peppers are expensive to begin with and when you roast them, they cook down considerably. One other note--I used sake instead of white wine in the corn relish once, and it tasted really great!

Loved the relish... I didn't find the relish particularly time consuming and the flavor is definitely worth the time. The salmon tasted great but the top had a sandy texture. This could be because we ground the coriander really fine. Definitely proud to serve a crowd.

I've typically had salmon baked with butter & some lemon, dill etc. This was excpetional! I too found the relish time consuming and would probably simplify it or make a day before. The salmon sause was just fabulous, the tangy lemon and bright colour was amazing. It was also the first time we cooked with corriander - what an excellent aroma.

Rating: 4
This recipe is divine. I've made it twice this summer, using a whole filet cooked on the grill in foil, and it was fabulous both times. The recipe makes a huge amount of corn-pepper relish, so I made the full batch, but only put 3/4 of it around the whole filet when I served it. The remainder was great the next day, by itself as a relish or salad.

I made this recipe over the weekend and it was a big hit. One caveat: I added a bit less honey than called for and it was plenty. Also, I think presentation is nicer if the fish is set on top of the relish, because the salmon has such a lovely, caramelized color. Definitely a keeper!

This was a delicious meal. The relish took more time than anticipated to prepare, so I recommend making a day in advance. The toasted coriander seeds smelled just like Trix cereal!!! My husband, 1 year old and 3 year old all loved it. We ate 1.5 lbs of salmon last night, between the 4 of us! I served it with Jasmine rice. The only thing is, we thought it tasted a little more like a fall/winter dish than a summery one.

Well, I think something must have happened on the way to Newcastle! No offense to the English cook. This was a delicious dish and I admit I cheated a little. I used the frozen salmon from Costco (tip: defrost in milk) and frozen corn; rinsed under cool water, shake to dry. I just wasn't up to striping the ears of corn on a weeknight. I also used the preroasted peppers in the jar. So I guess if I did it completely according to the recipe it would have been too awesome. But who does that? The fun in cooking is the experimentation. Right? MAKE THIS RECIPE! Your taste buds will thank you.
