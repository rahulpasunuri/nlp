Love this desert!! I also do not know what could have happened with the other reviewer who had problems. I followed the recipe and it turned out beautifully. I had no problem getting it out of the pan, the texture was like silk, and the subtle tangerine flavor was divine. My husband said it was one of the best desserts I have made and I make many many deserts.

I just made this dessert for the third time - it is fantastic! Smooth and creamy with a background of tangerine and burnt sugar - yummy! Don't know what the other reviewer may have done that gave bad results, but don't let it stop you - this is a keeper!

I followed the direction exactly and this just did not turn out. First, I could not get it out of the pan easily. Once it did come out, it came out in a big mess. Honestly, that was a good thing because then I could see how chunky it was and NOT AT ALL what Flan is supposed to be. I scrapped it and did not even serve to my guests and made strawberry shortcake instead. I was very dissapointed.
