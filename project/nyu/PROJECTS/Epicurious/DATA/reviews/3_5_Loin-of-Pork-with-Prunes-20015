It was so simple to prepare, but delicious! I also threw in a few fingerling potatoes with the pork in the baking pan. After the roast was done, I let it rest and then made a reduced sauce out of the meat juices, prunes, and wine (I didn't have Armagnac). I made this dish as a no-hassle lunch (10 min prep tops), and my husband and I loved she smell from the oven while we waited.

I love this dish from 1964. When do we ever see such brief ingredient lists? The meat was tender, and the stuffing impresses friends (even though it's so very easy to make). I served with pureed celery root and some grilled zucchini. Also for those who do the "wild rose" cleanse , this is a great option (minus the sherry :)

My pork loin must have weighed about 3 and quarter pounds. It was long and skinny and it cooked in just an hour. I stuffed it with unsoaked prunes. And over the top I put strips of bacon, the length of the bacon covering the width of the loin. In my case, I cut each strip of bacon in half to do this. This makes the loin self-basting. I never once basted it with anything; I just threw it in the oven and paid no attention to it until it was done. For presentation, after taking it out of the oven, you could skewer about 3 prunes at intervals on the top of the loin with toothpicks. For a sauce, I squeezed three tangerines (didn't have any oranges) into a saucepan and added a bit of Cointreau and 2 guayabas (guavas?), one pear and one apple all peeled, cored and chopped small. Cooked a few minutes 'til the fruit was soft and added two teaspoons of cornstarch in a bit of water to thicken it a bit. I didn't add any sugar at all. I thought it went well with the pork and prunes. You could use peaches instead of guayabas, but guayabas have a distinctive taste that I thought went well. If you do use guayabas, be absolutely certain that you get all of the seeds out of them. I will make this again, especially now that I know how quick it is.

Fabulous, especially when served with Sheila Lukins' "Rutabaga Carrot Whip". This cooks up in less time than the recipe required, and I ended up covering mine in the roasting pan while it cooked to keep it from drying out. This got rave reviews, I'll definitely make it again.

I soaked the prunes in Madiera for about 6 hours and stuffed the roast. That part was easy. I basted it every 10 minutes and used the Madiera the prunes soaked in plus added more because the roast did not render much juice for basting. I used a meat thermometer and baked to 147 degrees and after resting 10 minutes it went up to 158 degrees and was way overdone and dry and there wasn't much juice to work with in the baking dish. Don't think I'll make this again.

This is terrific and very easy to do. I agree with the cook who cooks it to 155 degrees, then wraps it for 25 minutes: a much better result than cooking it to 165 degrees.

I used a butterflied pork loin. Usually I make fruited pork with prunes, dried apples, raisins, onions, celery leaves & garlic with a little vinegar in the bottom of the pan. I like my mixture a lot better.

Unforgettable. I used a 1-lb pork tenderloin with silverskin trimmed off, so there was no fat to remove. I rubbed fresh thyme, salt, black pepper, nutmeg and a small amount of vegetable oil on the inside and outside of the pork before stuffing it. Did not use a roasting rack, but just put the pork in a glass baking dish. The prune marinade which I used for basting caramelized and blackened on the bottom of the baking dish. After roasting, I added a little water to deglaze the baking dish and poured the resulting sauce over the pork when I served it.

My dinner guests went crazy for this pork loin. An easy recipe with lots of bang for the buck. I didn't have sherry, port or Madeira and the liquor store was closed so I just used cognac to soak the prunes. They came out fine.

Simple to prepare, elegant, and delicious. I covered it for the last half hour. Instead of cooking to 165 degrees, I took it out at 155, covered it foil, and let it rest for 25 minutes. It was perfectly cooked. To make a sauce, I poured out the fat, added some minced shallots, then chicken stock and madeira, reduced it down, and added minced thyme at the end.

This recipe was a breeze to make, and makes a beautiful presentation. The prune center contrast perfectly to the roast. I also made a lovely pork-madiera sauce. It was a big hit, served with scalloped potatoes and asparagus.

this dish looks so elegant but is really so easy to prepare. I used a small (1lb) pork tenderloin which I butterflied myself (it was not difficult), rubbed the pocket with minced garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and then 10 prunes soaked in port. I tied it and rubbed it with soft butter,more seasoning, and poured the rest of the port around it. It took about an hour at 350. My husband was in heaven and ate the entire tenderloin in one sitting. Great with baked sweet potatoes, which can cook alongside it.
