I first made the recipe as written (see my review below). I had doubled the filling so I could try the Joy of Cooking pastry recipe a previous reviewer included in their review. The consensus in my house was that it was better with the JoC recipe. I did make one change in that I used whole wheat pastry flour.

This recipe is delicious. I doubled the filling recipe so I could try it twice; once with the dough recipe included and once with the Joy of Cooking recipe other reviewers enjoyed. I made the recipe as written. Everyone in my family thought it was great. I have to say this was a weeknight meal. Rather than making 50 (!) individual pirozhki, I made 4 galettes. I baked them for about 40 or 45 minutes. I also used the eggwash over the entire exterior. I will do the same the next time I make them. Delicious!

It looked so plain on paper and we only chose it because we had all of the ingredients on hand. But these little pirozhki were just outstanding when they came, golden brown out of the oven. We added about 1/2 pound of organic, grass fed local ground beef, browned - to the filling. The caraway flavor mixed with the dill and salt was sublime. Dough was excellent too. Spectacular recipe!

This recipe is the most detailed and best-described I have seen in a long while. The pirozhki tasted deliciously authentic, both with the provided dough recipe, and the additional one suggested by a previous reviewer (although I prefer the latter). I was especially impressed with how well these turned out after BAKING, which, if you know russian cooking, is virtually unheard of for pirozhki. Much healthier :). Overall, very impressed.

I wholeheartedly agree with the cook who prefers the dough recipe from Joy Of Cooking. I just made a batch using that recipe. Marvelous! I also made a beef/mushroom/cheese filling. I fried mine and they were heavenly. There's really no reason to have a "fear of frying." Just make sure your oil is hot enough and very little of it will be absorbed. Mine puffed up like tender, delicious little clouds. Do increase the size, though, and they'll make a much more substantial serving. I made a pot of borcht to go with them. A great meal on a cold, rainy night.

This dough is not like the traditional Russian pirozhki dough. It is like a regular American pie crust, which is good, but too flaky to be easily filled with stuffing. The pirozhki dough is fluffy and elastic and you will find it much easier to work with, recipe below. Some other good fillings are mushrooms, alone or with potatoes or olives, spinach, and pretty much any cooked vegetables. Or you can make sweet pirozhki with fruit preserves. Pirozhki From Joy of Cooking: All About Party Foods & Drinks (Canada, UK), by Irma S. Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker. In a large bowl, combine and let stand until the yeast is dissolved: 1 envelope (2-1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast 1/4 cup lukewarm water Add: 1 cup milk, at room temperature 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter, softened 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt Mix well, then make a soft dough by adding: 4 to 5 cups all-purpose flour Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1-1/2 hours. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Lightly oil 2 baking sheets. Punch down the dough and divide into 48 balls. Roll each ball out on a floured surface to a 3-1/2-inch round. Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle. Moisten one side of the round, fold it in half, and pinch together. Gently shape each pie into an oval. Place the pies on the baking sheets, cover, and let rise until puffy, 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly beat: 1 large egg Brush the tops of the dumplings with the egg wash. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

These are well worth the time spent! They come out flaky and buttery and the filling is rich tasting without being too heavy. My Russian husband and his familiy were very impressed when I made these! My only tip would be to lightly brush a stick of butter across the top of each one just as they come out of the oven.

I've made these several times, and they are deliciously addictive. I like to make a big batch, freeze them and then pull out a few at a time to bake and accompany with soup or the like. Dubious, that was hilarious! Vashe zdorovie!

Pirozhki are a Russian food, and so for that reason I used vodka instead of flour. That'll show 'em!

I've already made this twice in four days. Excellent recipe with a detailed description. Can't go wrong actually. A few weeks ago I also made 'pierogies', a Polish staple recipe with a sort of Yorkshire pudding-like batter, which I deep-fried, but they were rather stiff and floury whereas the pirozhki were pleasantly crunchy. And I very much liked the filling. I served them with the remaining cabbage, which I stir-fried together with some mushrooms, onion and bacon.

I made htis dish for my mother last year and she absolutly adored it! Ever since she has been reminding me of them and asking when I should make them again. Definitly put butter instead of the oil inside. It brightens the flavor.

Excellent version of an old recipe

These are very good. I have made them twice, once with the oil and the second time I substituted a hunk of butter on the top of the filling before folding the pastry over. The butter was a much better flavor, much more richer!

This is really great. I followed the advice from bcc103157 and increased the diameter to 4 inches. It is true that you can't stop eating them!

Delicious!!! That´s all what I can say. These are really good, and everybody loves them.

Outstanding. Increase the diameter to about four inches to accomodate the filling. I carmelized both the onoins and cabbage. The only problem is that you can't stop eating these (at least I couldn't).
