It was actually better than I thought. Guests ate all of it!

Wow, this just did not work for us. I wanted to try it because we love the combination of zucchini and cilantro from the "Zucchini with Cilantro and Cream" recipe on this site, but this dip was so uninteresting despite all of the wonderful ingredients. The depth of flavor that we expected just never made it to the party.

I really loved this recipe. I did add a few things, that made it made it better. I added 4oz of cream cheese and some parmesan cheese. It was really good.

Not much flavor and not worth the effort.

Was well liked. Served at party with snack chips and went over well. Would cut the garlic amount in half.
