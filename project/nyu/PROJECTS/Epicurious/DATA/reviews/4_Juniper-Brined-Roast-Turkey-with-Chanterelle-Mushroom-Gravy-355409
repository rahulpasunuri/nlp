For me, the flavors didn't really come through in the finished Turkey. The process was easy, but even then, I'm not sure it was worth it. The cooking process resulted in the turkey being done 2 hours earlier than I expected...not a good thing!

We used this recipe on a chicken rather than a turkey. We were short on time so we ground up the spices and used them as a rub rather than as base for a brine. We couldn't stop eating it!! The carcus made a wonderful broth base for soup, too.

Made this for my first ever turkey for thanksgiving. It was pretty easy. It was so good that my Grandmother in law said I have to make the turkeys from here on out

We just made this for Thanksgiving . . . though without the chanterelle mushroom gravy. It was delicious - not too much work at all. We were a bit low on pan juices, had to add more water to the bottom.

I can't say anything yet . . . but we are trying it for Thanksgiving . . . I'll let you know how it turns out!

I love trying new things, no matter how close to Thanksgiving! I was thinking last night about doing a Thai Thanksgiving and using curry paste and spice in a bunch of the food! I like the sound of this recipe. I have brined my own corned beef before and it was HEAVENLY, so I think I will try this with brining the turkey myself. I was wondering if therapeutic grade juniper essential oil would work in the place of juniper berries because I don't know where to get those. I have juniper essential oil from Young Living and it is safe for food use so I think I will use that instead.

Alcohol is at the top of my list for most applications! However, juniper berries, used sparingly, in a brine sounds good with a goose or wild turkey--not a store-bought turkey. Serve it with roasted root vegetables, spiced cranberry sauce and various sides--I'm in.

Ah, let's see...no reviews. Could it be that no one wants to try this the first time this close to Thanksgiving? Brining with Juniper Berries? Why not just use Bombay Gin? Very odd choice for the brine.
