These are really tasty! The carrots shrink more than you would believe, so keep that in mind when cooking for multiple people. I added some parsley, cinnamon, and brown sugar to the mix the second time I made them and it was also pretty tasty. Cooking these carrots without using foil or some separator from the pan/pyrex might be a good idea as they can be a pain to clean afterwards. The carrots are good hot, cold, by themselves, or with anything. GOOD STUFF!

Sorry, 450F is to high temp for these. 400F is better. Also, I thought it better to add a tsp of fresh lemon juice to toss with Olive oil and then toss with fresh chives and parsley right befor serving.

Used fresh baby carrots. Didn't peel or pre-boil--put them in for 20 minutes at 450 then reduced the heat to 400 and let them cook for 5 before turning the oven off. Let them cool for another 5 and took them out--delicious. I didn't have honey so I used a tbsp of agave nectar (all I had left) and a tbsp of brown sugar. I also added a few pats of butter. I think tossing the cooled, roasted carrots in a chopped fresh herb of your choice would really add something.

I made these carrots for Rosh Hashanah and everyone loved them. They were very easy to make! I'm not sure of the exact amount I made, but it was probably around 2-3 pounds for 21 people including 11 kids. I also cut the carrots in half to make them shorter and then julienned them.

Warning!! These carrots SHRINK! I bought 2 bunches of organic carrots (8 medium-slender carrots per bunch) for three people, thinking that 5 carrots per person would be an awful lot. What started out covering an entire baking sheet shriveled into a very small amount. Folks were fighting to get the final helping from the bowl. So make more than you think you'll need. If there are any leftovers, they'll be fine the next day.

Great recipe and easy. I put peeled and cut carrots in boiling water and simmered for 5 minutes. I then placed foil on the baking sheet and cooked as instructed.

I had wonderful honey, but just store bought carrots and it was beautiful and tasty. I remembered to angle the top of the carrots so they looked better. I had one guest who asked for more. 2 pounds (minus 2 cracked carrots) was not quite enough for 6 people. Think how good this will be with fresh local carrots.

I used less than a pound of carrots and the other ingredients as noted in recipe and it was yummy. I steamed the carrots first and then popped them into the oven. Be very careful I was paying close attention and they still almost burned in the honey sauce on the cookie sheet. I stirred, etc. but you really need to watch these. They are tasty. I served with a walnut crusted salmon and it was a nice pairing.

I added about 1/8 tsp cinnamon and got rave reviews at a potluck

Made this last night using both regular and heirloom carrots I bought at a local farmers market. It was delicous, looked nice and I would definately make it again.

Awesome! Usually, my kids will not eat cooked carrots at all, but they loved these!

I made these carrots as part of Christmas dinner at my sister's request. Adults and toddlers alike loved them. It was an easy recipe to prepare, especially combined with several more complex dishes. I've made it many times since.
