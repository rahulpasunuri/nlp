Delicious and healthy. This is one of my favorite winter soups.

I cook a lot, and this soup is a monthly staple in my house -- it's healthy, delicious, and easy to make. Lately I've been roasting the veggies and adding curry and coconut milk (and removing the maple syrup). You can also add parsnip or a bit of celery root - just be sure to keep the proportions to one cup each so that nothing gets too overpowering.

I added PINCHES of cayenne, not inches!!!!

I used a Braeburn apple instead of a G. Smith, and I didn't add any maple syrup. Nevertheless it was quite sweet. I several inches of cayenne and a couple of pinches of curry powder, plus two or three pinches of salt and a liberal grinding or two of pepper. Instead of floating the baguette toasts on the top we started with baguette pieces with goat cheese in the side, and ended up ptting bits of goat cheese into the soup it self, which made a big difference. My husband thought it was fine and I thought it was okay but not amazing. I think I'd make plenty of other soups before I make this one again.

this soup is amazing! only suggestion is to cut the maple syrup by a third or a half; too sweet otherwise. PS the goat cheese makes it!

This soup is amazing. Goat cheese is really expensive here, so we ate it with herb bagette pieces. SO yummy!

Oh and microwaving the squash for 3 min. makes peeling and chopping oh so much easier!

I love this soup in the winter! It's creamy and rich without the fat! Used parsnips instead of turnips and 1/2 the maple syrup - which I add (along with cayenne) after blending to better control the flavor.

my three forks is for my modified version: - i doubled the recipe but only used 1800mL stock - use half as much syrup -replace rutabaga with sweet potato it IS on the mild side for flavour.

Very yummy and easy soup for a cold weather day. Definitely agree with other reviewers that a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg are helpful. The second time I made this, I was out of maple syrup and goat cheese, so I subbed in brown sugar and went without the cheese and toast. I recommend not doing that.

Fantastic soup, with delicious butternut sweetness and the surprise of the perfect complement of the goat cheese. I had planned to bring a bowl to my boyfriend at work, but opted to warm it up for him at home the next day because the fresh toast with goat cheese takes it to that extra level.

This soup was extremely bland. Tasted like baby food. Not sure what all the hype is about. Will definitely not make again.

Used butter instead of olive oil to add richnees but, even with that, it was dull and uninspiring. Too much peeling/chopping for the end result. Not a keeper.

I added goat cheese directly to the soup when I reheated it the next day, and it was delicious -- adding just the bit of tang the soup needed (yoghurt would probably work, too). Like everyone else, I halved the amount of maple syrup.

Rating: 2
I really wanted to like this soup. I had hoped it would stand on its own, without adding goat cheese. Alas, for me, it was terribly bland. After doctoring it up with cinnamon, grating some nutmeg, and adding a generous pinch of a lovely and subtle curry blend, it turned into a great soup. In fact, my husband kept exclaiming "It's delicious!" between each spoonful.

Rating: 4
A fabulous soup and pretty easy too. I also halved the maple syrup as the apple and squash add their own sweetness. I'm not generally a fan of sweet foods and I love this soup!

this soup is deceptively delicious - it is flavorful and rich but healthy, too! one of my winter favorites.

Rating: 4
definitely a keeper. I used chicken stock and had a smoked turkey carcass in my freezer I threw in for added zing and let it all simmer for 2 hours or so before taking the carcass out and pureeing. as noted by others, I halved the maple syrup and added it and the cayenne after i pureed. toasted baguette and goat cheese was a nice addition but not critical to enjoying the soup itself.

This was excellent! I doubled the recipe and added much more spice: a bit of cinnamon, ground cloves, and a lot of nutmeg. I also decreased the amount of syrup -- I just added to taste.

Don't believe all the hype. It is a so so soup recipe. I am not a fan of sweet soups (prefer savory) so maybe i am being judgmental but It was just so so!

Just wow. Agree with many other reviewers that half the maple syrup called for works better. Make the bread slices into croutons! Mmm, butter.

This is one of the best soups I have made. If you don't mind, it can be a complete meal with a salad.

I've made this soup about 3-4 times. I think it's great. I used homemade veggie stock and skipped the goat cheese/bread. It's very flavorful and healthy!

Rating: 3
Very good flavor and it freezes well, though it is not nearly as good without the goat cheese. I also added much less maple syrup than called for, and added it at the end.

This is a new favorite soup recipe for me - loved it. The apple and maple really make it. It's worth all of the vegetable chopping! Perfect (and healthy) cold weather comfort food.

I doubled the recipe but only had about 1/8 of a cup of maple syrup in the house. To me, that turned out to be just the right amount of sweetness. Had to skip the cayenne and goat cheese toast, but it was still fabulous.

I thought this was very good. I doubled the receipe but did substitue parsnips for the turnips. I used only 2 T of syrup and a scant 1/4 teaspoon of hot pepper (my ten year old does not go for spicey). For my own portions I did add the dollop of goat cheese and drizzled with hot sauce (bonus here was a pretty presentation). I wonder what adding a bit of toasted cumin might do to this soup?

Rating: 4
Delicious. Did a couple things differently. Because I like a thick soup, I cooked it much longer so that a lot more of the liquid was gone. Then I whipped it up real well in a blender. Also, I added the syrup and cayenne AFTER the soup was in the blender so I could better control the final flavor. Not exactly sure how much of each I used, but I am certain I used less maple syrup than the recipe called for. I will make this again... and again...IT'S SUPER EASY, TOO!!!

Great soup - didn 't change anything except the amount of maple syrup and a whole chili pepper for the cayenne pepper. The baquette toppings made it. But, heated it up the next day for lunch and put a dollop of goat cheese in it (without the bread) and it gave it a whole new dimension. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Excellent soup with an awesome creamy texture. The only change I made was to add only half of the maple syrup. The cayenne pepper really add a great flavor and heat to this wonderful soup!

Rating: 3
I used the full amount of maple syrup and liked the flavor that it added. I used a really good maple syrup, so it wasn't overly sweet. Adding extra cayenne balances the sweetness. Excellent way to use winter vegetables.

This soup is a real crowd pleaser. Everyone loves it, even one who won't eat any veggies except carrots and peas. Took suggestion of reviewers who recommended going light on the maple syrup and found that about half was enough. Didn't have cayenne, so used tabasco sauce to taste, and it turned out great. Don't skip the toasted baguettes with goat cheese. Excellent!

Rating: 4
I've made this soup several times now, with a number of variations, adding acorn squash, leaving out the turnip, subsituting parsnips, forgetting the sweet potato, with the toast, without--and they all taste amazing. The one consistent thing that makes it so good is the Granny Smith apple. Everyone I've fed this to loves it. It's now a staple of my cooking.

The soup was great! I made it according to the recipe, but used 3 tablespoons of maple syrup and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne. I liked the goat cheese, but my husband doesn't care for it. Has anyone tried a different kind of cheese?

I made this for a dinner party... going light on the maple syrup and fairly heavy on the cayenne pepper: RAVE REVIEWS! (Even from those who said they don't like veggie soup)

This was fantastic. I used a bit less maple syrup as had been suggested and substituted parsnips for the butternut squash - as I didn't feel like peeling one - gah. And it's sooooo easy.

This is soooo good. Kind of sweet, yes, but the cayenne set it off perfectly. this is the best winter vegetable soup that I have ever had. All of the flavors came together so well, with not too much of each - just perfect.

oh so yummy, i've made several times. i want some right now just thinking about it.

This was a nice soup and fast and easy to make after work. Used a 16 oz bag of frozen stew veggies, 1 apple, and 1 small carnival squash (peeled and seeded). I used only 1 tablespoon of oil and decreased the amount of stock to four cups. I pressure cooked the soup for ten minutes. After a quick pressure release, I pureed it, and added only 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. In place of the cayenne, I used a teaspoon or so of Cackalacky Spice Sauce.

I made the soup exactly as the recipe called for and no one in my family liked it. We found it too sweet, too bland and with an unappealing taste.

You could definitely go lighter on the syrup and be fine. Tasted even better the day after! One to clip'n'save for sure...

This was good. I will definately make it again although next time I will add the maple syrup to taste, as this is a little too sweet for me.

Although it was good, I was a bit disappointed that it did not turn out to be a spectacular soup based on all the rave reviews! Easy to make.

Rating: 3
Tasty... especially with the Cayenne. We doubled it due to the amount of veggies we had and substituted acorn squash for the butternut, because it's what we had on hand. It was quite delicious. A couple of guests stirred the goat cheese right into the soup - which gave it a creamier texture - just a suggestion.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I used a couple parsnips instead of a turnip--I like their milder, sweeter flavor--and a roasted acorn squash in place of the butternut since that was what I had on hand. Worked beautifully. The flavor is both bright and subtle, and the goat cheese croutons are a marvelous complement. One of the most satisfying soups I've made.

My husband described this soup as "amazing." The favors are fantastic and in some ways, unexpected. I think this one deserves the description of a dish "beyond compare." What a wonderful autumn meal. Excellent, truly excellent!

I teach cooking classes in London and have been asked to do a demo at a local farmers' market. This is without a doubt, one of the best autumn soups I've ever tried and I think it will fit in perfectly with the farmers' market theme. The combination of the sweet root vegetable puree and the chive goat cheese toasts is so unbelievable! This is one of those dishes that bursts with flavour and leaves you feeling pretty good about yourself because of all the great vegies you've consumed... I love when that happens. I know they will love this at the farmers market... all the ingredients can be bought right there! You must try this.

I reserve my 4-fork ratings for only the very best epicurious recipes, and this is definitely one of them. It is absolutely perfect, down the chive garnish! Every single ingredient melded together to create a delicious masterpiece. I can't wait to make it again. Possible add ins: tomatoes, corn or cannellini beans. The soup might be good blended with cannellini beans and goat cheese. If you're browsing recipes, especially on a cool autumn day, this one is definitely worth a try!

Absolutely excellent. I have made it 8 or 9 times now and I still can't get enough! The toasted baguette slices with chevre on top make this dish.

Amazing soup. Made it for a party with my vegetarian friends in mind, and EVERYONE ate it, even the meat eaters. Was great, sweet yet hearty. The goat cheese on the bread was a nice touch. I also took the easy way out and got precut squash at the store.

WOW! This is a wonderful recipe. Nothing needs to be changed on this one!...and one feels virtuous eating it! Don't let the amount of veggies intimidate you, this is one classy soup.

This recipe brought out the simple and natural flavors of the vegetables. Floating the toast with goat cheese in each bowl full gives extra zip! Delicious!
