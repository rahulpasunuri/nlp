This is just a so-so recipe- generally chile verde has pumpkin seeds - either toasted or raw. I added 1/2 cup and like other reviewers, used poblanos (sometimes incorrectly sold at pasilla peppers) rather than anaheims- much better. If you plan to heat, don't add cilantro until the end- it reduces its flavor and changes the color.

This recipe definitely needs modification, as the other reviews show. I used poblano chilies and 1 jalapeno to give it just the right amount of "bite." I use this to make enchiladas - so much better than the canned stuff and worth the extra effort.

This is a great verde sauce. I use all poblamo chiles and one jalepeno. This is wonderfull served over pieces of Mesquite grilled pork tenderloin and wrapped in warm corn tortilla with a dollop of sour cream.

This was the best green salsa I've made. It reminds me of Villa Del Mar's green salsa and I love theirs. I agree with the previous reviewer that with only anaheim chilis, it would be a little bland. I subbed some of the anaheim with a roasted jalapeno and a roasted poblano chili. Next time, I'll be more generous with the jalapeno or a serrano if I want it really spicey.

I used serrano chiles instead of the wimpy Anaheims. No one uses Anaheims here..I think they were developed for the US only. I think they're too lacking in flavor to use in anything. I used 5 serrano chiles..it makes the salsa quite spicy. You can always use less. Otherwise, this is a typical salsa verde recipe with the heat removed. If you absolutely can't take the heat, you can use Poblanos, seeded and deveined, and get a much richer flavor than with the wimpier chile.

This is really great salsa that goes well with the turkey. Cut the tomatillos in half prior to simmering. You can forget the rubber gloves if you'll just remember to wash your hands after peeling the chiles. I seasoned the simmer pot with salt and pepper. After blending everything, I strained the mix through a strainer to make it thicker, unless you like watery salsa (I don't). It's just spicy enough to get your attention, but not enough to break a major sweat. Perfect.

Very fresh, better than restraurent, much better than canned.

Kind of bland as it is. I added a jalapeno chile to it to spice it up. Everyone love it when I served it but I doubt I would of received the same compliments if I hadn't put in the jalapeno chile.
