Have made this twice. I ordered SIX 1.5 - 2 lb Maine lobsters cooked & cracked from the local seafood shop to make the job easier (thx again for that suggestion). Maine lobster is a little sweeter than FL lobster and has the advantage of the flavorful claws. This yielded enough for four scrumptious servings. Both times, I added lemon zest which gives the lobster an extra boost of flavor. Once I followed the recipe as is, and the other time I added 1/2 cup finely diced celery, and 1/2 cup diced Eng. cucumber. These veggies are a good addition to provide a bit of color but more importantly it gives a nice contrast in texture and a bit of an unstated crunch, and it helps to stretch the salad a little further. Both times, salad was served in a butter lettuce 'cup' and presented on a platter with the empty/clean lobster shell. Beautiful. The Owners & guests loved it and requested it the second time a couple of months later.

It's rare when I disagree with the masses, but after trying this with 75% of the fresh tarragon recommended, both my wife and I couldn't taste the delicious fresh lobster for the tarragon.We rinsed it off, re-added mayo, cracked pepper and lemon, and viola!!! To my mind, you don't want or need to do anything to lobster that covers it flavor, and this does, big time!

I used to make this recipe while living in Haiti. I couldn't find fresh tarragon but found dried tarragon and it was superb. Easy to make and a special treat on a hot Caribbean afternoon.

FOUR forks for the clever person who suggested having the seafood store steam the crustaceans for you!! Brilliant. I've just called in my order and will pick the critters up in the a.m. Love it! Thank you... I'll let you know how it turns out.

The addition that I made was the zest from two lemons, one cup of celery, and juice from one lemon, that made the sauce thin but delicious. Also, I had to use dried tarragon, alas, fresh would have been even better. I used six lobster tails. Everyone loved this dish, and we saved the divine leftover sauce to use again on a buckwheat salad. NOTE:I rely on comments from others who have made a recipe, in fact, those comments make the difference between a good and a great dish. Kindly find other forums for discussions that dip into one's personal views or for those never having made a dish. Thank you.

This was seriously the best lobster salad I ever had! I followed the directions to a T - perfection! My husband had it on pepperidge farm rolls, and I put mine over a arugula and baby spinach mix -yummmmm. The only thing I would do different next time is add the dressing in small amounts to the lobster (instead of adding the lobster to the dressing) - I probably would not have used quite all the dressing. This way you can control the amount better. Make this - you won't be sorry!

This turned out to be so delicious. I was afraid the tarragon might be too strong and overpower the lobster, but it didn't. I made it the night before to serve for a lunch time tailgate meal Living in the south, I can't imagine ever having left over lobster around but if you did this would be a great use. I did the easy thing and had the lobsters steamed when I purchased them. And the hot dog buns were the perfect touch, I followed someone else's recommendation and used Pepperidge Farms brand.

wow, i've never given 4 forks but this is worth it and i never eat anything with mayo! perfect for leftover summer lobster. we eased up on the shallots and let them temper in the lemon juice for a good while. then we used my husband's favorite gourmet french mayo and added a tiny hint of tabsco. the fresh tarragon made the lobster sing. i had mine over green lettuce with garden tomato, my husband split the end of baguet, toasted it and added lettuce & tomato.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and was totally disappointed. The tarragon and shallots overpowered the lobter to the point of not being able to taste any lobster at all. I followed the directions to the letter. I've learned my lesson that Hellman's mayo is the only thing that should be mixed with fresh lobster.

This dish is absolutely fabulous. It's so simple yet so luxurious. And for the record, there's recently been a study that showed that lobsters don't have the mental capacity to feel the brief pain, it may not be true but it gives me a bit of piece of mind.

I made fresh aioli and it really made this recipe. I also used some fancy buns that looked a little better than "wonderbread." As far as the marine biologist goes... most people aren't surgeons in the kitchen. I made the mistake of trying to humanely kill the lobster prior to being cooked. I missed and the thing flopped and flailed for 5 minutes. My suggestion -- just boil it! It's a lobster!

Hey, I'm from Maine and I know lobster, damnit! To me, this is a VERY GOOD recipe--although I steam the lobsters. The hot dog rolls are a must. Just believe me. Try Pepperidge Farm brand.

I made this with some leftover lobster tails and loved it, I added some celery and paprika. Usually when I cook live lobster I put them on the kitchen floor and let my cat play with it for a while, if I have more than one I'll race 'em, then I boil them and eat them.

There is much controversy over the "roll" issue, however I can say that anyone who has been out to the Hamptons, or "Roll"out in Montauk, know that it is served on a large hot dog roll. Plain and simple. MMmmmm Lobster....

I fell in love with this while in Maine. Tarragon just improves it, if you don't overdo it. As for the crusty rolls or baquettes, better wear short sleeves, or you'll be shaking the lobster salad out of your sleeves for a week. Believe me, it's a lot better fresh.

Made a real salad even though lobster rolls are a favorite. Mixed some spring greens with 2 tomatoes, chunked, one half each red and green pepper, sliced, and a bit of shredded carrot. Just before eating I mixed the tarragon lobster salad into the green salad. No extra dressing needed. Great dish for a victorian picnic coupled with a creamy potato salad, a loaf of crusty bread and a bottle of chilled chardonnay.

A Classic recipe. Might seem odd to use hot dog buns, but it is the perfect combination...secret is to lavishly butter and grill the outsides of the roll so you get that warm buttery flavor with the cool, sweet lobster salad. Only change I would make is to omit the tarragon...am not a huge fan of it (better in chicken salad) and think it competes with the lobster flavor. I use a bit of chopped celery instead so all you taste is fresh, sweet lobster....has to be fresh. Don't even bother to make this with frozen or canned lobster. Unless you are from a landlocked area and don't know the difference. Growing up near the water here in Boston (on Cape Cod) I am spoiled by fresh lobster...when funds permit, I get it as often as possible.

Don't listen to the reviewer below! Coming from lobster roll country, trust me when I tell you a true New Englander would never dream of putting creamy cool lobster salad on a crusty baguette! Save it for your prosciutto and tomato sandwich! A lobster roll should be on a simply grilled buttered hot dog bun .. soft and warm and buttery and a nice contrast to the cool lobster salad. MMMMM

DO NOT waste a yummy lobster roll on a crappy hot dog bun. They may be good in Vermont, but everywhere else they are like eating wonderbread. Yuck! Lobster rolls should be on a nice crusty roll or a baquette. If your are going to spend the money on lobster, don't be chintsy on the bun. Otherwise, a very good salad recipe overall.

I must say this has to be the most political recipe I have reviewed to date. Being vegetarian, I can honestly say that the thought of plunging a live lobster into boiling water isn't something that brings warm tingly feelings to mind. However, as a culinary student I also understand there are certain methods to food preparation that often conflict with personal feelings. My suggestion for those of you feeling appalled by the "kill" method, try an alternative source (canned, frozen, tails, picked meat from seafood market, etc.) These may not be as tasty as the original but if it satisfies your conscience, well then problem solved. And if your curiosity ever peeks, some markets do offer to cook your lobster prior to your purchase - may be worth checking out. As far as being extravagant cost wise, hey I adore white truffle paste sandwiches (on little hotdog buns)!

I agree with the comments from the marine biologist below. Of course lobsters feel pain - it's a life-saving physiologic response. It tells you what to avoid. You know, back in the 60's they said babies couldn't feel or see also. Respect what you eat.

Rating: 3
As someone who has studied marine biology for four years, I would like to point out that it is certainly possible to kill a lobster before you cook it, and that this will undoubtedly reduce the amount of suffering it experiences. Simply make two incisions (as quickly as possible) behind the "head," in a v-like shape, to sever the brain from the body - using a sharp knife is mandatory here, I should think. To those who have mocked the writers who have demonstrated concern about the pain the lobsters might go through, I would say that it is possible to respect life and wish to cause as little suffering as possible while still engaging in the act of killing something for the sustenance it provides.

AH, the lobster roll! This is the most craved meal in our house. Our policy is to have fresh lobster as often as we can afford it (not often enough), buy and cook extra, and make lobster roll the next day. This is pretty much how we make it, but we find a dash of cayenne adds a nice touch. As for the "cruelty" factor, where do people think meat comes from? My 3-year-old thinks lobsters are cute. He pets them and talks to them before we drop them in the pot. Then, like anyone who has ever tasted fresh lobster, he eats every bite on his plate and asks for seconds. I hope he is always this wise about food.

I adapted this recipe for two people by buying one 1-3/4 pound lobster and adding a half pound of extra large shrimp cut in half. I cut back on the mayo, shallots, tarragon, and lemon as appropriate for a serving for two, but I also added 2 tsp of finely minced chives and some white pepper. Then I scooped the flesh from two halves of a perfectly ripe, chilled cantaloupe, added some of the melon to the lobster and shrimp and served the result in the melon shells. A perfect summer meal for two, served with crusty bread and a chilled bottle of sauvignon blanc.

I must say I really enjoyed this discussion. If my job was working at a meat planting plant, well? I wonder if I would want a steak. And if I worked at a tannery, would I shy away from wearing leather shoes. Some of us are sensitive, I personally prefer to allow a spider to pack its bags and move out rather than kill it. But if its me or the spider, its a dead spider. What made me stop when I read the recipe was instruction to place the lobster in head first. Perhaps thats why this all started.

I would love to try this recipe but 4 live lobsters would definately break the bank. I don't know the cost else where, but here they would be roughly $100-$125. Just a bit to pricy for a salad (no matter how good it is)

To the cook from Somerville, why are you surprised that Gourmet suggested making s classic lobster roll? All up and down the East Coast, lobster salad like this is piled in top-split hotdog buns, toasted on the grill and buttered. The New York city restaurant that serves the most renowned lobster roll in town, which costs $18, uses Pepperidge Farm buns and Hellman's mayo.

It just seems wrong to stuff gourmet lobster salad into a hot dog bun. I'm still surprised that is suggested- how about stuffing a cucumber with it, or freshly made rolls, or almost any venue other than the lowly hot dog bun? As for the ingredients, I can't think of any that complements lobster more. And yeah, it should be real lobster. It's such a simple composition, and the lobster isn't just another ingredient, it's the raison d'etre of the dish. Have your grocer 'prepare' it, or do as another reviewer suggested and freeze it just to death if, like me, you haven't the stomach for harsh reality (yes, I'm aware this makes me a hypocrite). Know however that lobsters don't have a centralized nervous system, so blows to the head and crazed stabs at the neck aren't going to do what you want them to do, at least not for awhile.

Some of the people who have posted messages here seem to know a lot about the central nervous system of lobsters. I've been eating them for years. When I was a kid my grandmother told me they just go to sleep when you put them in a pot of boiling water, so I never gave the whole pain issue much thought. Now I feel terrible. Here's my question: what about crabs, clams and mussels - do they feel pain when they're boiled or steamed???

I haven't tried this recipe yet but it sounds like an absolutly fabulous blend of tastes. I will probably used fresh boiled lobster since I live in Boston... lucky, huh! As for the rest of you people, USE WHAT YOU WANT! If you like frozen, use it! If you'd rather sashimi, great! If you think octopus might be better, fine! Just STOP whining about it. And to the person who wrote the Rawhide spoof, I think your lyrics are probably better than this recipe... give up your day job!

This recipe looks great, I am also curious to know if lobster tail is an acceptable substitution, cleaning out a lobster is just not something I enjoy to do, same with squid, I have done it, but it seems it is a bigger mess than it is worth to me.

I just wanted to say that I am the cook who made the original comment on this strand of reviews, and I am dumbfounded at the snottiness of some of the comments. Basically, my first comment/question was just asking if it would be ok to use frozen lobster tails. I said I would not boil live lobsters. I did not mean that I am against boiling live lobsters. In fact, by all means, please do. I happen to live in a small apartment with a even smaller kitchen, and I thought this recipe might be nice to take on a picnic. PARDON ME! To the couple of cooks who actually RESPONDED to my email with a suggestion, Thank you! To the rest of you, I really feel sorry for you that you feel better about yourself when berating someone else. I think the recipe sounds great and I'd love to try it. I just don't want to use live lobsters. That's all. Please stop reading SO much into comments on this website. Courtesy is dying here.

I really enjoyed reading the diverse opinions on lobster preparation. Allow me to take the liberty of starting an old wives tale - drive a nail into it's head - fast, painless and I hear their blind when they are out of the water. (My thoughts, are that the fewer the ingredients a recipe has, the more distinctive flavor of the ingredients is: something as tasty as lobster would be wonderful like this but just serve mine with melted lemon or garlic butter to dip it into, thanks. Just for the record, I don't know what the meat was in my Pork Fried Rice the other night - it wasn't pork (or chicken or beef). However, I'm sure it was a domestically available critter and it was tasty... and I'd eat it again. If you don't want to cook food that squirms and has eyes, eat eggs. Bon Appetit!

Oh Dear, I will take a lobster anytime I can get one. I use to work in a Marina in Noank, CT and the "guys" would go and pull lobster pots for me just before I would leave for the day. I have not had a good one since moving to Florida. Going North next week, a friend is making Lobster Rolls for us to have for lunch! To my friend Marion...Kill them anyway you want to! We're on our way...

Lobster must be really fresh -- no matter where or how you get it. Also, the quality of the mayo in this recipe will really influence the outcome. Home-made is best, but Hellman's is the store-bought alternative I'd choose.

Sorry, I can't help myself. Lobsters (and crabs) DO feel pain when boiled alive. Put them in the freezer for approx 20 min (depending on size)- don't freeze them through or there's no point in paying that much for the buggers in the first place. FAKE lobster? Or crabmeat? Sheesh. Why bother.

Okay, I used to feel the same way about boiling live lobsters, until I found out that lobsters have no sense of hot and cold. They will not feel any pain when boiled. Obviously that doesn't change the fact that you'll soon eat them afterwards, but at least it won't be a painful death.

OK - steaming is similar to worse than boiling alive as per below cook's comments - the frozen lobster tails work wonderfully with the classic ingredients and are much less work and pain. The fresh tarragon is a must. Disagree with the cook about lobsters being put on this earth for the sole purpose of being subjected to death by boiling.... For a recipe that has sauce and herbs you do not need boil a live lobster - try those tails instead!

Whoever sells lobsters usually has the facility to cook the lobster for you. I always get the butcher (something that is becoming, sadly, outdated) to boil mine for me and it cuts the time in half and you don't have to think about animal rights -btw, they aren't crying or whatever when you put them in the water. That is the release of air. They might have feelings, but as long as you do plan on eating them and not killing them for sport, I say continue the food chain!

Just want to add my take on boiling live lobsters. Yes, it's pretty inhumane -- if lobsters could squeal, most of us wouldn't do it! Try freezng them first -- quick and painless, I'm told from the animal rights people.

I'm laughing at all of us, myself included. I, too, couldn't kill a live lobster, 'tho I fully understand how ridiculous that is. I once chose my lobster from the tank at a fine restaurant, then burst into tears when it appeared cooked in front of me! Needless to say, my husband was not amused. However, you can ask the fishmonger to kill the lobster for you at the market. I have no problem letting someone else kill my meat of fish. Some of us are hunters, some gatherers. I'm happy to share my garden produce with a hunter in exchange. I'll be making this recipe this weekend.

Really!! Grow up or put your pampers back on.... Those of you who buy your meat and fish all prettily wrapped in paper are out of touch with reality. SOMEBODY knocks it in the head or boils it alive. This doesn't change just because you find it wrapped in the grocery store.

I wonder if using the fake crabmeat would work in this receipe, too? why I wonder must lobsters be killed by being boiled alive; can't they be hit on the head to kill them?If you buy packaged lobster tails you aren't avoiding them being killed in this boiling death way-you are only getting lobsters boiled by someone other than you. so if you are trying to avoid the extra work, fine, but you can't escape the fact that those lobsters were killed by throwing them into boiling water whether you do it or "they" do it.

Hey, I'm thinking of making this dish with "fake" lobster which I get at the local Asian supermarket. I've done lobsters live (really, they are alturistic and live to serve us) but the price is too high in California. I'll wait to visit Maine again before I have the real thing.
