This soup surprised me -- I thought it would be boring & bland, but it was light & delicious. Based on others' reviews, I added dill & lemon juice. I also added sliced mushrooms & made it vegan with mushroom stock & tofutti sour cream. Definitely saved in the recipe box for future use!

Great soup! I doubled it, and added more garlic. I also used the chicken broth instead of the water. Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and fresh ground pepper and fresh ground himalayan salt to season. Very tasty! It's great with lentils in it, too!

Good starting point. Used 32oz chicken broth, 2 leeks, 1 onion, and some olive oil in addition to the items listed. I added 1/2 tsp dried dill, 2/3 cup Greek yogurt, and 1 tsp lemon juice. I blended the entire soup, and the final consistency was like a split pea soup. Overall it was good, mild, yet well balanced.

While my three year old, oddly, loved this soup, for me I thought it was a bit of a mess. Tasty enough, I suppose (but for the sake of all that is holy, do not omit the sour cream, and maybe flirt with creme fraiche as an alternate), but to me this was seriously lacking in OOMPH. It might have had something to do with there not being a lick of spices as written. I don't really have suggestions on that front, given that I'm not paid to write recipes and would suck at it even if I were. So you're on your own.

Great soup, but yes, small portion. I did blend the entire recipe, skip the water and just used 2 cups of chicken stock in total. Added a splash of balsamic vinegar on each bowl. This is a keeper!

This is a really good base recipe. I added a few tablespoons of fresh dill and I messed around with the Paula Wolfert 7 day preserved lemons last weekend, so rinsed off a quarter lemon, chopped it finely and added it to the soup. Gave an amazing freshness to an already great soup.

Exceptionally easy and a good use of the asparagus that was barely clinging to life in my crisper. Omitted the water and instead started with extra stock, blended the entire batch and added a splash of cream. Adding fresh parmesan shavings right before serving really gave the soup an extra complexity. Delicious, but very small servings. I could see it being an excellent starter but you'd need to double it.

This was fantastic, even better than expected based on other reviews. My version left out most of the extra water (we like it thick), added a splash of cream, substitued half yogurt and half buttermilk (b/c this is what I had on hand) for the sour cream, and 1/4 tsp of dried dill as suggested by another reviewer. The dill was an excellent touch; tarragon might be good too --but a bit of seasoning really is needed, whatever you like. Also I found it needed some brightening at the end and added a little lemon juice. Served with creme fraiche on top and fresh hot brioche. I am already looking forward to making this again.

Easy & Quick. Lighter than traditional cream-based leek soup. Left out asparagus and used whole leek and doubled garlic. Added teaspoon of cardamon and a little ground pepper. Great with warmed rustic bread. 5 Forks all the Way.

This was really good and really easy. I added more chicken broth to make it soupier and used greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream. Like other reviewers, I reserved the asparagus tips and threw in at the end, and added some dill. Next time, I'll top it off with a dollop of creme fraiche.

The soup was easy to prepare and had a beautiful spring green color and well-balanced flavors. The asparagus, although slim, took longer than the recipe indicated to cook. Next time, I would puree more or all the ingredients to make a smoother finished product.

This was an easy recipe to put together - as recommended by others, I increased the garlic and added dill. It was very thick and my husband likened it to humus! I used non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream. I loved it!

Yowza! This was beautiful. A lovely mild green colour, a harbinger of spring! As suggested by a previous reviewer, I reserved the asparagus tips and sauteed with some thick-sliced pancetta. A party in my mouth!

After reading the reviews I decided to add fresh parsley and double the garlic while cooking the leeks. I doubled the recipe and used an equal volume of leeks and asparagus instead of only 1 cup of leeks. I added some dried dill (1/4 teaspoon) at the end with the sour cream. With some little tweaking this soup/cream is to DIE FOR. The only reason why I give 3 forks instead of 4 is that you have to make some adjustments or it will end up a bit bland. Make it you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 3
Very easy and delicious. Lends itself to experimentation. I agree that garlic should be doubled. Add your favorite herb (thyme, savory, marjoram, tarragon) to the leek/garlic saute as well. Depending on your mood, add red pepper flakes. I used non-yogurt instead of sour cream because they are often interchangeable and that was the case here. Blending the entire soup makes things easier too. Try this one!

Apprenticing on a farm in upstate New York, I can say that this was the most delicious way I could use Asparagus and Leek, which are almost out of season. The key is this: cook the leeks and asparagus just until bright green, no more, and you will have a beautiful soup. I used a homemade broth of leek greens, over-wintered carrot and red russian kale stems. I used broth in place of water and just a spoonful of fresh yogurt on top. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This is a great basic recipe that can be easily adapted to other vegetables that are on hand. This is wonderful as is. But I have also cooked this with shallot instead of leek. Spring peas and watercress (not together) instead of asparagus. Greek yogurt or creme fraiche also makes a great substitute to sour cream which I usually just drop in before serving.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I have to say I don't really measure anything but the only changes I know I made was- extra garlic and broth, a little oragano and crushed red pepper, generous on the salt and pepper, a little heavy cream instead of sour cream because it's what I had and a little parm. I imagine the fact that that this recipe is vegetarian is the appeal for most but I bet it would be delish with procuitto

Rating: 2
No doubt it's easy, and no doubt it's healthy. But this is a pretty bland dish and even adding a few red pepper flakes, being overly generous with the salt and pepper, and using all chicken broth instead of part water, STILL didn't get this past a feeling that this wasn't much different than what my nine month old child eats, in terms of pureed vegetables. I'd like to be able to offer you something to make this more exciting, but nothing comes to mind, short of going with a different recipe.

This was easy and tasty. The only change was to add a small piece of parmesan cheese at the end. It gives it an extra layer of flavour.

This soup was delicious and so easy to make. A great way to take advantage of the asparagus season. I substituted the sour cream for 1/2 cup of low fat milk, and added a little extra water and broth (there wasn't enough liquid for my taste). We had this for dinner with some crusty bread and corn on the cob. Delicious, healthy, and quick! Highly recommended.

Wow! Great soup. Added a bit more garlic and just a very few red pepper flakes (added some zing and didn't overpower the asparagus) - delish. I've made it several times - so easy and tasty.

I gave this 4 forks based on the flavor pay off for ridiculously little effort. The only change I made was to double the garlic and add some fresh thyme when sauteeing the garlic and leeks. I used my immersion blender to perfect results. This is so simple and so good!

Very little bang for the buck here. I followed other chef's advice on attempting to minimize stringiness without success. I found this quite underwhelming despite a few attempts at jazzing it up.

This soup is excellent. I highly recommend straining it before adding the sour cream, as others have suggested. I doubled the recipe and look forward to the leftovers...

This is a simple, tasty recipe, and very healthy too! I found the soup had little dots of sour cream in it that I couldn't quite mix in, next time I will add a little soup to the sour cream to thin it, then mix in. I used light sour cream and it was a good addition. I also used white pepper instead of black. Like another cook suggested, I cooked the asparagus tips separately and added them in after blending most of the rest of it. My only complaint is that the recipe didn't make enough for my family of 4 for lunch. My advice is to at least double the recipe.

Excellent flavor and very easy and quick to make! I ended up adding a bit more of the chicken broth to think out the soup or you might want to put a bit less of the sour cream. Everyone loved it!

I almost didn't add the sour cream, since the soup already tasted good without it, but I'm glad I did. Kicked it up from 3 to 4 forks. As a first course, served 2 people with lots left over.

Wonderful! I made this with asparagus that was a little past it's prime and rather stalky. I pureed all of it and ran it through a chinois. Turned out velvetty smooth with marvelous flavor. Dinner guests raved over it!

This soup is a huge hit with my family. I cut the butter by 1/2 and use olive oil. Also, I use the light version of sour cream and thyme when sauteing the leeks and garlic. A sprinkling of parmesan cheese goes over very well too.

An elegant and colorful 15 minute wonder. Don't spend too much time cutting the leek up into very small pieces. A few extras seconds in the blender will make up for your sloth. Also, I used a slight bit of fresh lemon juice to brighten up the flavor.

I have made this numerous times and my husband and I both LOVE it. I puree the entire thing and have not found it necessary to strain it; just make sure you rinse the vegetables very well before cooking (one time I didn't rinse the leeks thoroughly enough, and the end result was a gritty soup).

Make sure you clean asparagus carefully first to eliminate "stringy" problem. Snap off about 1-2" from the ends of each asparagus spear and then take a vegetable peeler and trim off the outer layer of green from about 3" from the ends. I puree the whole soup and strain it just to be sure. Soup is good, but be careful of too much garlic. Like most Gourmet receipes portions are generous. I quadrupled the receipe and had enough for 12. I still have not found the perfect asparagus soup receipe at Epicurious.com.

This soup is FANTASTIC! I completed it exactly as shown and no added flavour was necessary. My only criticism is that it is a bit fatty for a vegetable soup. Next time I'll try light or low fat sour cream and butter.

Oh, yum. Got fresh asparagus, leeks, and garlic from the farmer's market and used way more garlic than the recipe calls for, used nonfat plain yogurt, and a dash of (don't look if you're a purist) instant potato flakes to add a nosh of flavor/texture at the end. Really really good and EASY for midweek meal.

This is a very nice, light soup. I made it for guests last night, and they enjoyed it very much. I reserved some of the tips and then pureed the rest of the soup, and then added the tips at the end. I felt like the soup was good, but lacked something- maybe it needed more garlic?

A great way to use up Asparagus! I added chicken to this soup (had to make stock anyway) and served the sour cream as a garnish. I also added a bit of fresh rosemary and thyme. Great with a bit of bruchetta. Scrumptious!

This is good. To make it thicker and lower fat I 1) added 2 peeled Yukon gold potatoes; 2) and used plain non fat yoghurt. It turned out great. (Even my 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 yr olds ate it).

I used homemade stock reduced well and it still lacked an oomph. I love aspargus and leeks. Not sure what it was. Maybe some croutons would be good.

We grow our own leeks, so this has become a summertime favorite and I usually double the recipe. I reserve the asparagus tips, use Knorr's boullion for extra flavor, add dill and some red pepper flakes, and use heavy cream instead of sour cream. I microwave the tips ever so slightly and add at the very end.

Nice, easy soup with great flavor and texture. I had no problem using a Braun stick blender. If your asparagus isn't very fresh and tender, you may want to puree the whole thing.

This was very tasty and easy to prepare. Since fresh asparagus was not in season, I used two 10-oz. boxes of frozen asparagus and defrosted them in the microwave. It was still slightly frozen when I added it to the recipe, so I simmered the soup a few minutes longer -- it turned out fine. In addition to a little salt and pepper,I added a dash of white pepper.

I have made this recipe at least once a week since I tried it. I love it. Low fat ingredients can be used in place of the higher fat ones. I look for the asparagus in the reduced section of my market when the price is higher than I care to pay. I really enjoy the recipe

I have to say, before adding the sour cream, I thought this soup was good, but not four forks. The sour cream really contributed to the final flavor. I tripled this recipe (it served 8 nicely)and made it two days ahead (except for adding the sour cream). I also pureed all of it and put it through a sieve. I garnished with roasted pepper coulis, a drizzle of cream, and chives. One of the guests actually asked if anyone would mind if he licked his bowl! That's when I knew 4 forks were warranted!
