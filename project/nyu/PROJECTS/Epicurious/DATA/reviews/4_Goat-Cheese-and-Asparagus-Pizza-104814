This was fabulous. I added a little grated mozzarella cheese and of course more asparagus. I also made my own pizza crust which is really easy and much more enjoyable than the store bought kind.

This was wonderful. I did it as a grilled pizza, added mozzarella and garlic - yummy!

A quick springtime dish. Based on the suggestions of others, I used up to 1/2 lb. of asparagus, a pre-made pizza shell, omitted the sausage, used feta instead of goat cheese, and used dried herbs and granulated garlic. De-lish!

I love delicious and quick and this recipe fit the bill. My mom raved and I would absolutely would make it again. I added fresh basil and garlic, but used powdered marjoram (1 TBSP). The red pepper made it perfectly spicy!!

Excellent recipe. Fast and easy. I also used a premade shell from the grocery store instead of frozen. Added chopped garlic on top and doubled the asparagus. Put under the broiler for a couple minutes at the end to brown the goat cheese. Reheated ok the next day.

Gave it a three because I would only give a four once in a thousand. This was really, really, really good. I made my own crust (so easy and so good)and put on the crust before the asparagus: one hot Italian sausage, sauted, with a bit of olive oil and 4 pressed garlic cloves. (Yes, I do use a press. Works for me.) I used a whole pound of asparagus but reduced the olive oil to 2 T. I used goat cheese on half the pizza and on the other half I used an antigo stravecchio parmesan, crumbled. The clear cut winner was the parmesan---100% better. This is a very nice recipe.

Delicious! I just bought a marjoram plant at our French Market and so I wanted to make something with it. This pizza was an excellent choice. I used a flatbread similar to boboli (but a generic version instead)and it worked well. Loaded it up with tomatoes, asparagus, and goat cheese ... Mmmm

Second time I made this, it's simply wonderful, and so quick. I used a ball of pre-made pizza dough instead of the canned stuff this time, just as quick, but much better. Also, I added some proscuitto with the cheese and herbs (for the carnivore in me). One tip though, be sure the tomatoes are well drained, it can get a little runny in the middle!

Great springtime recipe! Inspired by a recipe in the Washington Post this week, I used a pound of asparagus and roasted it first; omitted the tomatoes, used (less expensive) whole-milk mozzarella (not fresh) cut into 1/2" cubes (melts wonderfully) and sliced garlic instead of marjoram, and made the pizza dough from scratch....you talk about GOOD....

Great stuff that's also fun to make. I, too, doubled the asparagus. Next time I'll use a bit less cheese. As for the fresh marjoram -- in MY neighborhood grocery store? It ain't happenin'. I used a teaspoon of dried instead.

I made this pizza with a whole wheat crust that I got from Trader Joe's. It was very good and a nice change from the traditional stuff. Definitely double the asparagus. A sprinkling of salt before eating is also good, since the flavor can be just a tad bland for some. But an excellent recipe and very quick.

This recipe was so easy and very very good. I will be making it often. My husband also loved it!! Thanks!!!!

Yummy and easy--great when you want to make dinner from scratch, but don't want to spend a lot of time doing it. My Manhattan grocery store didn't have refrigerated pizza dough or Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, so I used refrigerated crescent roll dough and regular diced tomatoes instead. I probably would use slightly less goat cheese (@4 oz) and load up on asparagus (as other reviewers suggested) the next time I make this...which will be soon!

Great tasting and very easy and quick and not too much clean up after either!! Followed other reviewers suggestions and added more asparagus which was great. Also as suggested by another reviewer, my boyfriend added proscuitto (sp?) to his half but it was great without the meat. The only thing I will do different next time is try to roll the dough out better as the middle was too thin and got a little soggy - but I may have rolled it out longer than the recommended 9 x 12 as my baking sheet was larger. Will definitely make again - makes a tasty, easy quick dinner.

We tripled the amount of asparagus and would do so again. This is a keeper - quick, easy, and delicious.

This is an awesome dish and so simple to make! My boyfriend (huge asparagus lover) and I made it twice in two weeks! Definitely add WAY more asparagus than the recipe calls for - we nearly quadrupled the amount.

Very good weeknight supper - instead of take out pizza. I added gorgonzola, prosciutto and more asparagus. I think it would make a nice appetizer.

I always try to pick the easy dishes...but this one is fun too. Load up on the asparagus!

This is also delicious with good feta if you don't happen to have goat cheese in the fridge. I also agree with "loading on" the asparagus. Great recipe!

SIX spears of asparagus? Pah! Load 'em up baby, just make it pretty. (You may have to adjust the cooking time some.) The grocery choices were plain diced tomatoes, or with jalapeno. I did one of each. Hands down, the jalapeno won. I was afraid it would add a conflicting flavor too many, but it only added a pleasant depth to the red pepper heat.

This was SO easy, and so good. It would also be good with some grilled chicken or oasted eggplant. Just be sure to go easy on the crushed red pepper. I put too much on, and boy was it spicy!

My God -- oh so tasty and very, very easy to prepare -- an incomparable combo!

This was a definite hit ... I added some grilled chicken. Also, I used a Boboli crust rather than the tube of dough, and it was terrific.

This is a great quick, easy, and delicious weeknight meal or lunch dish. I would spray some cooking spray on the pan next time, I had little sticking problem. This would even make a snazzy little appetizer when cut into smaller pieces.

We love pizza but this recipe is just a wonderful change and for the veg. group just excellent. Make sure to use the cheese suggested. This makes a marked differance in the end result
