I tried this with the addition of a little lemon juice. I also blackened the peppers over a flame for a smoky taste. A little cornstarch helped to thicken it, and the end result was a real hit on baked chicken!

I found this bbq sauce too sweet. Whereas it might work well on ribs, I like something with more of a smokier, more savory taste for broiled or grilled chicken.

The sauce wasn't thick enough. Next time I would add some cornstarch and simmer longer. One thing that I added was a few drops of liquid smoke. It gave the sauce a very nice taste.

Excellent on chicken thighs, baked in oven and finished in broiler. Made as directed and it had the perfect amount of heat. Needed to thicken a bit with cornstarch.

From the previous reviews I was prepared for it to be VERY hot but it wasn't. I fixed it as suggested only substituting a red for a green bell pepper (because we don't care for the green variety) and ended up using the whole bottle of cayenne pepper sauce because there was so little left over. It smelled wonderful and we could taste the oj but it wasn't hot at all. I would make it again but add hotter sauce and perhaps some garlic (I missed it!). We had it with Baby Back Ribs and would do it again with the right twist.

Sauce was very, very simple to make, substituted red bell pepper for the green because this is what I had, also added about 1/2 cup brown sugar as it was too hot without it. The sauce went great with London Broil grilled on the BBQ.

I cooked the sauce an additional 30 minutes on low, then pureed it till is just had some minute parts of onion and pepper visible. Also added some brown sugar 1/4 c.Excellent for BBQ ribs.
