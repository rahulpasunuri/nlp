Ever since I discovered chocolate covered orange sticks inside the candy counter at Woolworth's in 1964, I've had a craving for that magical combination. Finding this recipe on your pages was joyful and something I looked forward to baking this Christmas. But, I'll not be able to do it again. I can only blame the 5,400 ft.high altitude here in my kitchen (Albuquerque), since others loved it so much. It has been a week today since we made the recipe and it's still hard as a rock pretty much through and through. We'll be "baptizing" with Grand Marnier to see if we can ever get it edible. Maybe we won't care if it is after a few bites.

No bah humbug for this fruitcake! I've made really good fruitcakes for over 30 years with no real changes or experimenting with tradition. This year I tried this recipe and am I glad I did. It's exceptional! My sister-in-law, whose annual present has been her own personal light fruitcake, just requested one of these for next year. This winner will become part of our family tradition in the future.

I just made this cake 3 days ago and sampled it today. It is hard as a rock. I would guess that half the baking time would have been sufficient. Taste is not bad but the texture is awful. Much too hard even for a fruitcake. Expensive mistake!

I'm not a fan of fruitcake but I couldn't stop eating this! It was dark, dense and moist, without all that sickly candied fruit. The only changes I made were to omit the sugar entirely (the fruits made it sweet enough) and to substitute the prune butter for some marmalade I had in the fridge. Awesome!

This recipe scared me at first because when the cake cooled it was rock hard! I learned from a fruitcake-familiar friend that the instruction to "wrap tightly in plastic for 2 days" is KEY: that's how the cake softens to enable it to be cut, so be sure to make it a couple of days before you want to serve it. It was moist and chewy and delicious - almost brownie-like inside. I also made small bundt loaves as gifts and they were a huge hit with everyone who received them last Christmas. I will definitely be making them again this year.

A very special cake. I split up the recipe into two tube pans for sharing. I experienced what my southern ancestors must have gone through as I hand folded in the fruits alt flours - whew! Next time I'll tax my mixer's motor instead of my own - this is a VERY DENSE batter. It's too bad the eaters of the cake didn't get to share in the making of the cake - not just because of the muscles gained from hand-beating batter, but the incredible SMELL of the hot pecans when they hit the orange peels mixed into all that luscious liquor laden fruit - THAT was a treat I wasn't expecting!! Thanks for this recipe! It'll be my event cake for friends and family for years to come.

This was amazing! I hate fruit cake, but HAD to make one for my aunt's 90th birthday. She's very traditional but it went down a treat. Everyone, absolutely everyone loved it! chocolate lovers, nut lovers, and still kept the traditionalists happy. Magic! For an extra kick, try a drop of cointreau and cinnamon in the marzipan if you're using it for christmas.

Fantastic recipe - have made it twice, once for my mother's 60th birthday party and more recently for my wedding. A huge success both times with lots of compliments. Prune butter is not available in Australia, so I made my own: in a food processor beat 1 part water to 2 parts prune (works a treat!). Both times we made the cake at 2 1/2 times the recipe, and while it is a bit of work it is truely worth it. If making this size baking time is about 4 hours in a fan forced (electric) oven. The cake probably serves 30 people rather than the suggested 16.

Can anyone offer time advice if using mini Bundt cake tins? (Or I suppose jumbo muffins would be similar in time...)

Where the heck does one find prune butter? I ended up with plum jam instead. Probably threw off the texture a bit. This is pretty tasty and I cannot abide fruitcake. Made it for a friend who will adore it. The recipe makes two smaller fruitcake bundts which is nice, cause I don't know anyone who could eat a whole 12 cups of this!

Based on the high ratings and the list of ingredients I had fun making the fruitcake and had high expectations for the end result. The end result is a disaster and I'm not sure what I may have done wrong as I used all ingredients as stated and carefully double checked my progress. The outside is dry, the inside is not cooked (yes my oven was at 325) and it is just a brown mass inside. It is way too sweet. I'm only contributing these comments as they do offset the high praise and this is an expensive mistake. I have made Epicurious recipes in the past considering the pros and cons contributed and have found them helpful. I'll eat it on cross country ski outings as it certainly has substance and excellent ingredients.

This is an amazing recipe and will convert ANYONE who claims to dislike fruitcake. The texture is superb and the flavour will knock your socks off! I didn't bother with the glaze as it really doesn't need it. Makes a brilliant addition to a holiday goodie box!!!

Someone else made this cake in 1995 and I had a piece. I remember it still 7 Christmases later! I can't believe I found this recipe and am making about 6 of them as gifts. It redefines "fruitcake."

I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and granulated fructose for the all-purpose flour and white sugar (I have an eating disorder). I also used unsweetened carob chips rather than trying to "fix" unsweetened chocolate. It was marvelous! Rich, dense, sweet. I didn't make the glaze because it didn't need it.

I made this cake for a holiday party. It was the least eaten item, I ended up throwing part of it away. I found it too heavy and dense.

I made this recipe to give to each of our families for Christmas. It was very easy to make and one of the best recipes for a chocolate fruit cake - very decadent and also rich and moist, but also lighter than conventional christmas fruit cakes. Everyone enjoyed it immensely - its the best thing I've baked! I plan to do it again next Christmas....

Absolutely decadent! These would make very classy gifts as individual cakes!

One word YUM! We've made this cake several years in a row now for gift basket giving. We bake them in jumbo muffin tins, individually dip each cake into the glaze and wrap in colourful cellophane when done. All our friends love it and have come to expect it every Christmas. They can't believe it's a fruitcake!!

Interesting combination of ingredients and tastes. I used prune baby food as I could not find prune butter. I also made half the amount of glaze and it was quite adequate. This thing is quite dense and heavy, but different.

This is an excellent recipe although it takes alot of preparation-I had to substitute plum preserves for prune butter but it turned out quite moist. This is perfect for mini bundt cakes, especially if you love chocolate. A great spin on traditional fruitcakes, it wasn't too dense to scare off people who dislike that word.
