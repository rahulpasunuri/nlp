This looks amazing. I live on the island but I don't know if that place is still around. What is here though is a great hotel 123 west who do Epicurean Retreats: http://sanjuanisland.com/2011/11/02/san-juan-island-epicurean-retreat/. This Islands is great for foodies!

This was a very flexible recipe and all of my guests just loved it! I used the left overs as topping on hamburgers and it was fantastic.

the mushrooms are delicious but came out very greasy. if i made it again i would use half as much butter in the saute.

I have made this several times, and each time it's been received very well. I've found that any leftover mushrooms (rare) make an excellent omelette filling.

I agree with other reviewers, I did not add the artichoke hearts, I felt it was over- kill. I used a combination of shitake, baby bella and button mushroom, (price the motivating factor)and I cut down on the amount of butter used for the saute and didn't add butter or parmesan cheese to the bread. I just toasted a good french bread and spread it with the goat cheese. Everyone enjoyed the results

I love this recipe although I leave out the thyme and basil and use baby bellas instead of shitake mushrooms due to the cost. I make this regularly. It is worth the extra work!

I thought this was good, but doubt I would make it again. I didn't feel the time involved was really worth the end result.

i have this recipe for along time and never tried it. I made it on Christmas Day and it was a big hit. I can't wait to make it again.

I first made this for my father's 60th b-day party and it was a huge hit! I've made it as an app. as well as a main pasta course. It's even better as a left over. I always make extra. It takes time to make, but it's worth it! I'm planning to make it again as an app. for Thanksgiving this year.

I made this as well for an appetizer and the only thing I left off was the artichoke hearts just because I thought this could do without it. I, as well as our guests, loved it! My husband is not a big fan of goat cheese, so I actually served it on the side so people could "smear" it as they pleased...Not a bite left when all was said and done. Another keeper!!!

Good rich flavors. Richly fragrant with the thyme and pepper. I would decrease the red pepper though. Also, the artichoke hearts could be left out and mushrooms increased, those flavors compete. I used white and crimini mushrooms instead of button. The parmesan isn't necessary when you're putting goat cheese and mushroom mixture on the little toasts, but leave it in if you want a fat, rich flavor! Tomorrow night I'll put the leftovers on pasta like everyone suggested.

I've made this recipe twice and it's been a huge hit. I made this as an appetizer for my father's 65 birthday party and it was gone in minutes. I made it again over pasta and it was even better than on the crostini. Well worth the effort!

Yummy! I make a day ahead and add the basil and butter when I reheat it before serving. Everyone loves this dish.

This appetizer deserves five forks! It was SOOO yummy! I could make a meal out of it! I served it to a small party and it was gobbled up! Everyone loved it and the wives all want the recipe. It's a bit tedious but don't well worth it! It's important to serve it warm! Enjoy!!!

Served it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving, to rave reviews..very special..

This was excellent. Made enough for first course/appetizers for 10 with leftovers. Next day we heated up the mushroom mixture and tossed in chopped tomatoes and served over pasta with some fresh grated cheese on top....hmmmm.

This recipe was labor-intensive and was not worth the work. I will say I accidentally bought pepper-encrusted goat cheese instead of herbed. It was terrible! Maybe that was the problem, but I won't try it again to find out.

I needed a recipe with shiitakes since I have a huge container of dehydrated ones and this was perfect. I rehydrated them and then sauted as per the recipe. I didn't use button mushrooms. It was delicious and got raves at my party. The next day I tossed the saute with pasta and cheese--yum!!

Great recipe. The mushroom mixture was outstanding. Really good combination of flavors.

I used only button mushrooms and eliminated the Parmesan. I spread some of the toasted bread with goat cheese alone and others with the mushroom saute alone. All excellent! True Italian flavors!

What a great combination of flavors. I felt that the parmesan was overkill with the goat cheese, so I left that out, and substituted olive oil for butter. Delicious.

one word: amazing.

The combination of flavors in this dish was really good. I took it to a party last night and everyone loved it. We had steaks on the grill for dinner, and since the mushroom mixture wasn't totally gone, the host suggested serving the mushrooms over the steaks . . . it was excellent!

Mmmmmmm! I made this for a dinner party appetizer, and it was gone in minutes. One mushroom-hating friend dug in before she knew the ingredients and raved. To this day, it's the only mushroom dish she'll eat!

Mindy is on the right track. This is one of my favorite appetizer recipes (I originally found it in the magazine) and thought it would be a great pasta sauce. Cook 12 oz farfalle, penne, or other short pasta. Drain and toss with the room temperature goat cheese, then toss with the mushrooms. Grate the parmesan over. Its fabulous!

The mushroom, artichoke & sundried tomato mixture was excellent. It would be great tossed with pasta or serverd on chicken. It was a little unclear as to what to do with the goat cheese. I spreaded it on the crostini, warmed them in the oven and then topped them with the mushroom mixture. I chose a garlic herb montrachet goat cheese that was a little overpowering. The crostini looked great, but no rave reviews.

It was a little hot for this dish last night, but I'd found some fabulous mushrooms on sale at the local farmer's market and just went for it! My guests couldn't get enough of this and even my husband raved! It's worth the time taken, for sure. Can't wait for the cooler weather when it will really be yummy!

I have maade this dish three times, twice for large gatherings. It was a huge hit with everyone, and my husband can't wait for me to make it again. I had oil packed sun dried tomatoes and it was great. Every one loves this dish. I served it once with plain goat cheese on crackers after the crostini ran out, it was still delicious. It is well worth the effort.

Yum! We served this at our wine tasting and it was superb with the cabernets we were tasting. I mixed some crimini mushrooms in there too and added a tad more thyme. HMMMMMMMMM!!

very good. i got impatient and threw everything into the sautee pan at once. instead of using french bread, i used half-slices from a load of hearty wheat / pumpernickle bread. the grainy flavor went nicely with the mushrooms.

Absolutely Delicious!!! Would definitely make again and again. Husband and guests raved for hours.

Delicious, my guests loved it. Easy to make. Excellent appetizer. Serve immediately accompanied with the crostini. Generously served 12.

This is so delicious and flavorful. I had company and everyone wanted the recipe. With the leftovers I made a pasta sauce the following evening and that was also very good.

This was a delicious appetizer. I too, would love to try the leftovers over pasta. I'll be making this again!

Wow! This was definately a winner! I served the crostini already prepared with the mushroom saute and goat cheese on it. It went over amazingly well.

Tip - it takes about an hour to make without using a food processor. The recipe made plenty for 6. Leftovers are good on pasta. It was tempting to skip some of the many ingredients, but I didn't and friends said they loved the different flavors

A friend and fellow epicurious addict brought this over as an appetizer before dinner at my house last weekend. It was yummy! With butter, parmesan AND goat cheese, you get little crostini fat bombs, but they certainly were tasty. We thought of other uses for leftover mushroom mixture - am eager to toss some into an omelet. On its own, the leftover mixture is not as tasty the next day.

A hit appetizer with our 4-couple supper club! As to when to add the goat cheese, we served it with knives so people could spread it on the crostini, then add the mushroom mixture. We used portobellos instead of shiitakis.

When do you add the goar cheese?
