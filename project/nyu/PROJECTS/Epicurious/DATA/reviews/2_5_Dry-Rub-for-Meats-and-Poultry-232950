Very tasty rub.

I think this rub is delicious. It was a lifesaver for me. Prior to trying this rub I had no idea how to season meat therefore leaving my dinners tasting blah. I was mixing all the wrong ingredients together and not much flavor was coming out of it. I ordered Daisy's cook book and gave it a shot and now I use it on everything. My meals now have flavor! I def recommend.

I cut the salt by half and added some rubbed sage (about as much sage as oregano). used it in the related pork recipe and loved it
