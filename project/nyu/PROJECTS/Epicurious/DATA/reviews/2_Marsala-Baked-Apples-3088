mmmm good :) I substituted Rome apples since they maintain their shape so well. These do however make for a very large dessert. I also didn't have marsala so used a good red wine (can't recall which kind - merlot or cabernet sauvignon) which worked great. The cider/wine mixture was a wonderful topping.
