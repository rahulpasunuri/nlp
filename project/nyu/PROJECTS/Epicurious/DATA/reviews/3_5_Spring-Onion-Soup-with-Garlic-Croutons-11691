Pallid and blah. Not at all interesting. Make the traditional French onion soup instead.

I made this as a first course for Passover - without the croutons, of course. Simple and delicious - be sure to use Vidalia or other sweet onions. Rather than use so much scallion, I simply added about a two tbsp to each bowl as a garnish.

My whole family loved this soup and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Drizzling the croutons with the olive oil as directed leaves a lot of dry (unflavored) spots and it's easy to miss some croutons completely (stirring does not distribute the oil any more evenly), but I guess you don't really notice that when they're in the soup.

I've been making this soup since it was first published in Gourmet. It always gets fabulous reviews and is EASY to make.
