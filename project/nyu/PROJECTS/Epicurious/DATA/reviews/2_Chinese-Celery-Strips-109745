Fair. Very salty.

These were okay, nothing more. I was disappointed. The flavor was subtle, perhaps too subtle for me. Not something I will make again.

This was amazing! I love vegetables and it's so easy for me to get a rut by making the same ones all the time. This was surprisingly good. I added some cauliflower also and will definitely make this again. I followed one suggestion by adding ginger also.

this is one of those reviews where i changed the recipe entirely, but it did inspire me, so i should give credit where it is due. i stir-fried the celery strips very hot and very quickly in a little bit of butter, then added all the ingredients listed above. everyone was very surprised that what started a pile of bland celery could taste this good. enjoy.

Interesting, 2 1/2 forks. I do alot of chinese food and it's kind of nice to have a cool crispy veg. side for it. I will rotate this with my usual chinese chopped salad. I have made the chinese poached "velvet" chicken from this site and I think this would be nice with it the next time I do that dish.
