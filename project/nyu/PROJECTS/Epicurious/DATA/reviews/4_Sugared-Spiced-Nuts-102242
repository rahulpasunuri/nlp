Very tasty and quick. Picking up on other reviewers, I replaced 1 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup of dark brown, added 1/2 tsp ground cardamon, used pumpkin pie spice and replace the suggested cayenne (people here in France aren't heat-oriented as much) with ground smoked chipotle pepper which I found gave it a nice smokey underlying heat that almost creeps upon you vs. cayenne which sort of bites you up front. It was a huge hit and I have my 2nd batch in 48 hours in the oven as I write. I baked mine on a Silpat liner and stirred after 40 minutes, again after 50 minutes and again at 60 minutes, the total cooking time before I finished. Nuts were still a wee bit sticky but dried when cooled, at which point I broke up with my fingers before stirring. (Disposable gloves for you purists!) I skipped the cumin only because I feared stained fingers among my guests.

Very nice recipe, and I've made it three times now. But...be warned that you should reduce the amount of sugar. I used 1/2 cup and it was plenty. Like other reviewers, I added cayenne, some chili powder, a little chipotle, cumin, a bit of cardamom, and some cinnamon. It took longer than 50 minutes to get really dry. We can't stop from noshing on these; they are deliciously addictive!

excellent and easy holiday gift!

Too much sugar and not enough spice. If I made it again, I'd up the heat and decrease the sugar.

I made it just like the recipe says and I really like this --- I may try it with some of the hot spices suggested in other reviews

I have made this more than 10 times. The recipe as is gets 3 forks but it gets 4 if you doctor it up a bit. As others have said, add some cayenne and I like extra salt, too. Also, I really prefer the pumpkin pie spice over just cinnamon. If you have a Costco near you, they have excellent mixed salted nuts that I always use for this.

Only OK...needs spices adjusted. Way too much sugar and not enough 'spice'. Used pistachios, almonds & cashews. Kids liked them more than adults, because of all the sugar!

excellent for oktoberfest but definitely add the cayenne!

an addendum I used raw pecans halves also.

great! I made it with 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and 1 heaping tablespoon of cayenne. I also used dark brown sugar instead and people have been begging me for the recipe and raving!

Make sure to add cayenne, chipotle or something to spice it up. It is hard to tell what people will like (hotness), so I stick to 3/4 t cayenne. Sometimes you get a nut with an abundance of pepper so warn your guests. I always use raw nuts; sometimes toast lightly before and sometimes not. I add 3/4 t kosher salt. Get some quality cinnamon from places like Penzey's.

Very good. Even my 2 year old couldn't get enough. I suspect adding the cayenne pepper as some suggested would kick it up to Excellent. Will try that next time.

I made according to recipe. These are good. But I didn't get a "wow" from them as others are suggesting. Next time I will try adding the cayenne. I suspect that will bring it from 3 to 4 forks.

This is always a big hit at book club, and many members have asked for the recipe. Definitely add the cayenne pepper, and a heavy hand is not uncalled-for. I caution you, however, they are addictive.

These were easy,delicious,and made a huge amount.I used all almonds.The only thing I would change is to maybe add a few dashes of salt.

These really are quite addictive. I made these as the recipe stated and then the next time I used 1 TBL cinnamon, 1 TSP New Mexico chile powder and 1 TSP smoked paprika, 3.5 C Almonds and a scant .5 C sesame seeds/flax seeds combined. A little more unusual but delicious. My husband thought they were so great he told me I "should try to sell them". . . Aren't husbands just the greatest!?! Cheers!

YUMMY!!!! I do 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie and close to a teaspoon of cayenne and any nuts i have

3 forks instead of 4 only because they were pretty typical of other sugared spiced nuts I've bought, received as gifts or gotten at country fairs, etc. -very delicious but not so special.

Rating: 3
Followed others' suggestions (thank you!) and added a generous tsp cayenne - and they are great! Next time will use a bit less sugar - a lot left over in the pan. Used raw nuts (walnuts, almonds and pecans) and roasted/salted first. Next time will add cashews as well.

This is a cocktail party staple. Easy and delicious. I always follow what other's have suggested and use 3 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp cayenne along with the sugar.

This is an impulse and it's in the oven. Easy and quick, made just as written with pecan halves. Will update when the come out, but what's not to love about this?

Love theses nuts. Used only the raw almonds from Costco. Roasted them lightly first then followed the recipe using cinnamon. I did add some cayenne as suggested by others. Adds just the right balance with the sweetness. Will make these over and over and probably give as gifts this holiday season.

Made this recipe for a family gathering this weekend and got a ton of compliments. Everyone wanted to know where they could buy them! I altered the recipe - using raw nuts whicjh I roasted and salted before dressing - and adding a heaping tsp of cayenne as previously suggested. DEELISH! I ate about half of them before I even put them out!

This is the perfect cocktail hour snack or hostess gift. I like my nuts to pack a little more heat, so I added 3/4 t. cayenne pepper. You might go even heavier on the cayenne if you like spicy, and try a hefty teaspoon.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great! It's how I used up all the leftover nuts from my Xmas cookie bake-a-thon. Since I was using raw nuts, I added a tsp of salt (and probably should've toasted them in the oven first, but they're still awesome). I also kicked them up a little with cayenne and chili powder. I'll be eating these nonstop until they're gone.

Easy and great. Used pecans and added them to a winter salad. Just the thing!

I love these! I made many trays full during the holidays and packaged them for friends. I even sold some of the packets at a holiday boutique and made $100! Use 1/2 mixed nuts from Costco (as another reviewer suggested) and 1/2 walnut halves from Trader Joes. Don't worry about adding an extra spoonful of cinnamon. This makes them taste even more spicy. They are a great, crunchy treat that keeps well if stored in celophane bags or a sealed container.

These are delicious! I made 3 batches - one to serve at home and two to give away. I used 3 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice with cashews, pecans, almonds, pistacios, peanuts and hazelnuts. It HAD to be good!

These nuts are delicious... they taste just like the roasted nuts you get at a fair. I combined pecans, peanuts, cashews, and almonds. I also increased the sugar/cinnamon mixture by 1/4 and stirred a few times while cooking.

Made this for a Christmas Day nibbler using Trader Joe's Roasted/Unsalted Mixed Fancy Nuts. Easy and delicious! My 5 year old ate all the almonds before I could! Next time I'll try a sweet and spicy version to mix it up.

easy and delicious! Plenty of coating for the nuts as is.

The only change that I would make is to cut the amount of nuts down to 3 cups as I really like the cinnamon glaze and not all the nuts were covered enough. Simple and delicious.

Sometimes super-easy things aren't as delicious as they are quick. However, THESE ARE WONDERFUL! So easy, so quick, and unbelievably popular. I gave them to my co-workers for a holiday treat and had 2 requests for the recipe before the end of the day. YUM! Hard to resist, though, if you are trying not to eat too much of your own baking.

I added a 1 tsp of chilli seasoning and a dash of cayenne to cut the sweetness. Excellent!

Here's a great recipe. Use these nuts on top of a salad of mixed greens, red seedless grapes, blue cheese and a basic vinaigrette of dijon mustard, minced shallot, red wine vinegar and olive oil. I also put some cayenne pepper on the nuts to give them some spice. Simply awesome!

I made this for the holidays, and got raves. I had plenty left over for New Year's Eve, and all my friends thought it was the perfect compliment to beer. I wouldn't have thought of that, since I'm not a beer drinker, but hey, why not? I've been told that these are "expected" to appear at future gatherings!

So simple and wonderful. I thought they wouldn't be anything special but they were. A big hit at my party-- not one nut left. Be sure to stir it every once in a while in the oven.

I made one batch exactly as written ( using all pecans) and another batch with a "spicier" spice mix using 1 tsp cinammon, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1//4 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp cayenne. both were excellent. I will be making these often.

Yummy. Big hit with our guests. These are very sugary. I also had a small clumping problem, but I didn't stir the nuts (if only I had seen the reviews first!) If you'd like something that's more savory there is also a good recipe on this site for spiced pecans with chinese five spice.

Made this recipe along with many others for a Bunco party and most everyone remarked about how good the nuts were. I used mixed nuts, as well as lots of whole almonds and pecans halves. Based on the reviews, I turned them often-no problems. They were EASY, fun, different and nice to have at a bridge or bunco table.
