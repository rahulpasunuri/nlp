Totally yummy! Made some variations based on the theme (mock duck in place of chicken and prosciutto in place of ham) for a weeknight dinner in 30 minutes! This could definitely get someone enticed to try more complex/different Asian flavors!

Where I used to work, this was the one dish I couldn't wait to have made. Hgrubb above is the Chef at the cafe that made this. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Most importantly, the lettuce makes the dish!!

I am a chef for a corporate cafe and everyone "raves" about this soup when I make it....
