Enjoyed this recipe. Used 1 lb. of fresh crab. Used the reviewer recommended croutons for the breadcrumbs. Rolled out a Marie Callender pie crust to save time; tasted great. Added a touch of Old Bay. Used parmesan for the topping. Tastes like good crab cakes with a nice pie crust. And it's not fried. Do try!

I have made this recipe several times and each time it was a big hit with my guests.

I have mixed feelings on this recipe. It looked gorgeous, with all the green from the parsley, celery, and scallions and the red from the peppers. But, I have to admit, the taste was reminiscent of crab salad. To me, it just didn't 'belong' in a tart shell. Instead, the filling might work great in canapes or served in small shell-shaped dishes. I liked the cayenne.

This is WONDERFUL! Didn't have time to make the pastry from scratch (though it sounds good), so used a frozen pie crust-browned first. As suggested, I used a 6 oz. can of crab,red onion,& garlic/onion croutons ground into crumbs. Used all of the mayo mixture. Baked & topped w/ grated parmesan.Delicious! Would also make great crab cakes.

This is an excellent, beautiful dish! I also used 8 oz. (imitation) crabmeat, thanks to the reviewers' advice. I will definitely make this again - possibly as appetizers in the Christmas season. A bit time-consuming, but worth it.

This is wonderful! Like the other reviewers, I used less crab meat than was called for. I used just under a pound of crab. If I'd used any more, it would've been way too much for my 11" tart pan. This tart is very attractive and very tasty and goes a long way. I'll definitely put it on my "make again" list.

This was time-consuming, but tasty. It would make an excellent and colorful appetizer or hors d'oeuvre. I used a yellow pepper instead of green, and found that 8 oz of good quality canned crab meat was plenty and worked well. If I had used any more, the tart would have overflowed the pan.

This tart was very delicious. I used only 8 oz. of crab meat and no scallions. I did not add any salt, but added a dash of Savory and Sage. As a main course, this would serve 4 adults. It is best to let it cool for 15 minutes before serving.
