I was looking for a potato salad that was a bit different. However, I found this recipe to have too strong of a mustard flavor - making the recipe tart. I omitted the chives and arugula - which would have added more color, but I wasn't crazy about the dressing flavor itself - not sure if the 2 additional ingredients would have helped that any. However, I still thought something was missing - if I would ever make this again I might look to add bell peppers. I did like how the blanching of the celery and carrots made them less crunchy - I would use that technique again for other salads.

We loved this potato salad. However, I am allergic to carrots so we substituted sugar snap peas for the carrots. It gave it a great texture and color contrast. Next time I would add a fresh herb.

Wonderful! Make sure you don't overcook the veggies (I did and it was still good, but mushier than expected). I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have sherry wine vinegar. Also, I didn't get arugula, so I used baby spinach and mixed it into the salad. This is one of the best potato salads ever! I agree it needs more chives than called for - only because less gets lost in the salad.

A nice change from the standard potato salad, and very healthy as well. The argula is important to the taste and texture and I wouldn't omit it. I used my powdered buttermilk mix, but buttermilk in its natural state, preferably from the health food store which has superior brands, would be better. I think everyone making this would be inclined to use more chives since the salad contains no onions. I don't understand why the celery is blanched. My dinner guest isn't a celery fan, and another time I'd mince it finely and not cook it because I think that detracts from the subtle fresh celery flavor. I fudged on the sherry wine vinegar, using half dry sherry and half white wine vinegar, and that seemed to be all right, considering so little was called for. Watch the cooking time on the potatoes. If cut as instructed, they're done in a flash.

Tasty, tangy potato salad with unusual flavor and combination of vegetables. Also added additional chives. Too tart as written, required 1 tablespoon of sugar to mellow the tangy flavor slightly. Not sufficiently different in taste from an old-fashioned potato salad with mayo, mustard and apple cider vinegar to justify purchasing special ingredients to make it.

The dressing is pleasantly tangy and the carrots and celery add nice color. I made one small modification: I threw in a whole bunch of chives rather than just 1 tablespoon.
