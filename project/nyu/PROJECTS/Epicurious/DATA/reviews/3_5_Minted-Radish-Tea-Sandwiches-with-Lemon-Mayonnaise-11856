I've hosted a high tea party a few times; these sandwiches are always the first to go. Although it seems like an unusual combination - together, the sandwich tastes delicious. I usually follow the recipe pretty closely.

Lovely addition to our 2012 Derby Party Menu. Cut into more traditional finger sandwich shapes and used a rye/white bread for additional color interest. Even the teenage boys loved them!

I wasn't sure if the recipe said to spread the mayo mixture on both pieces of bread - they would certainly hold together better if this was done. I omitted the dijon and added a few tablespoons of honey flavored goat cheese to the mayo. It was fantastic!

I have made these 2 times and everybody loved them. Even people who don't like radishes were raving. I followed the suggestion of making the radishes as thin as possible and I just used strohman bread.

Loved this! It sounds so odd, but it's really delicious. Be sure to put the mint on the mayo, then top with the radishes. Yummy!

Simply great combination. I made these using small cocktail loaf of sour dough bread, so no crusts to cut. Hands down, the best of 4 different tea sandwiches I served today.

I made this for a Mother's Day tea and a mother that likes radishes. I don't but ended up eating more of the sandwiches than anyone else! I really liked the taste and texture combinations.

Also delicious served on a crisp sesame cracker, like a canape, instead of on bread.

Delicious! I was sceptical at first because I couldn't imagine the flavor combination, but these were absolutely fantastic--a great combination of textures and flavors. I think the trick is to get the radishes sliced thin enough. I used a mandolin and got them almost paper-thin. I will definitely make these again.

Read my review with a grain of salt: I really don't like radishes very much. But last summer, there was this lovely looking bunch at the farmer's market, so I thought I'd give them a try. I thought this sandwich tasted kind of odd--sort of like wood! The radishes were also firmer than the bread and tended to pull out of the sandwiches when you'd take a bite. So I know for a fact I will not go down this radish path again. But nor would I discourage a radish lover from doing so!

Made these for a baby shower along with three other types of tea sandwiches on this website--these got rave reviews. Great mix of spicy radish and light lemon taste. For some reason, though, had trouble cutting into quarters and just cut in half and served that way...

Made these along with the cucumber mint tea sandwiches ( used dill on those instead) for a bridal luncheon. These were amazing! Beautiful and fresh tasting. Will definitley do again!

I don't know why these were so good, but they were. First gone from the plate! I blended the mint into the mayo for ease of assembly. It was still pretty and the leftover mayo was good for other stuff.

These sandwiches are very refreshing and the mint and radish combine to form an unusual, tingling flavor. This recipe is a welcome change from some bland tea sandwiches, so it is possible to have both.

The combination of the radish and lemon mayonaise is wonderful. They are a pretty sandwich. In all a huge hit at a baby shower I hosted.

This was a deliciously cool sandwich and the combination of the mint with radish was surprisingly delightful. I served it at a holiday tea party and both men and women enjoyed it.
