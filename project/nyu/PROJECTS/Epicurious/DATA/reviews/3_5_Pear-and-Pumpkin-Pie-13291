This was a hit with my notoriously fussy family. It felt very light after Christmas dinner. It was also very easy to put together.

I made this recipe this Thanksgiving for the first time in many years and was a little disappointed. I wrote a previous review stating that this was my favorite Thanksgiving dessert but this time it seemed heavy, though the poached pears were still the ideal accent to the pumpkin pie. The Creme Anglaise sauce was delicious. I will keep thinking about it. Would it be better with a no-bake pumpkin filling such as the one featured in Cook's Illustrated or the excellent recipe on the condensed milk can or a chiffon pie?

This pie LOOKED very good and I thought it would TASTE very good, but it did not. The pumpkin part was not as good as a standard pumpkin pie and the overall effect was somewhat blah. The poached pears by themselves were delicious- next time I will make just that part and eat the pears alone.

The only pie I make for Thanksgiving now and well worth the extra time. Beautiful and delicious - I love the crispness of the pears with the creaminess of the pie.

I loved the pears - they were beautiful and tasted sublime. I had leftover pears, and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them. The pie was another matter, though. I felt that it was way to rich and definately not spicy enough. Everyone liked the pie but I was disappointed. Next time I will make a basic but spicy pumpkin pie and will probably find it more satisfing....sometimes simpler is better.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving! The recipe was easy to follow- just leave more time than you think to poach the pears. My only suggestion is to use two pears instead of three...I can't imagine crowding three pears worth on top of a nine inch pie.

I am not a big fan of pumpkin pies, but I do like pears. This is a fabulous pie, and is the only one I now make at Thanksgiving. So far everyone that has tasted it has loved it. A decent Zin is the best red wine for poaching the pears and they should be slightly under cooked so that they slice well and hold their shape. This *is* a time consuming recipe to make, but well worth the effort.

This is my all-time favorite Thanksgiving dessert.
