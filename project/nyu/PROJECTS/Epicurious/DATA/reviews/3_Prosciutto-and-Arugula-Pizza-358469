Didn't have time to search for Pomi tomatoes so used my own mixture of canned pizza sauce (to which I add minced garlic and chili flakes to pep it up). Tried to find the Cacio di Roma but my local cheese store didn't carry it and I didn't have time to go searching around, so I substituted parmigiano reggiano and my guests still devoured it. Good appetizer. Really liked the parbaked crusts - next time will make a variety with different toppings.
