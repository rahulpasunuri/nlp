I used capers instead of olives and fresh tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes. Also I added chipotle sauce to the tuna mix and came out delicious.

I agree with the other cook about the mix being a little too wet, but not a major problem, simply add more tuna. This is an interesting twist on regular tuna sandwiches. Tasted even better later in the day, I think the flavors had time to blend.

I made this for a light dinner one night and everyone loved it. I used grated lemon and a drop of lemon oil instead of lemon juice and it was very savoury. I'm going to make it again for a late Christmas Day lunch.

The last 10 years I've kept making this sandwich, forgetting that I've already made it because the ingredients are so appealing to me. I don't know what's wrong, but it never seems to be as good as it should be. I'm thinking maybe the garlic kills the palate for the other flavors (I love garlic). I had some nice peppery arugula and the Italian tuna in olive oil too boo hoo.

Not a GREAT recipe but it works if your tired of the simple tuna salad sandwiches. Next time I'll have to try it with less or no lemon juice. The lemon was a little too strong in the recipe.

I tripled this recipe for a luncheon I was hosting and everyone raved about the tuna. I added an extra can of tuna (total of 4) because it was a little too wet at first. I served the tuna in pita bread with feta cheese on top as a garnish. Really great stuff.
