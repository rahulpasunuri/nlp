I lived in Korea for 4 years and this is merely ok. Kimchi is just not meant to be made "quickly." Better to buy it from an Asian grocery if you have one.

I can now easily satisfy my kimchi cravings thanks to this recipe! I also use a bit of sugar (1 T) vs the asian pear and even use (dare I confess) cayenne pepper and Frank's hot sauce. Tastes great for weeks.

I am so glad I found this recipe!!! We have to drive at least 30 minutes to downtown to get decent Kim Chi here. So I thought I'd save gas and try this. This recipe is much simpler and much easier than the other ones I've tried. I didn't have the asian pear so I added 2 tbsp of sugar. Next time I will definitely make it as is. This is so good that I will not buy kim chi again!

We halved the recipe as a first try. Since I'm allergic to fish sauce, I subbed with 1 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce + 1 1/2 t mushroom soy sauce (ending up with the right amount of liquid to match a halved recipe). We also used cider vinegar instead of the white stuff, Thai chile powder instead of Korean, & a whole regular pear instead of a 1/4 Asian one. So I won't give any stars, but did want to note that we liked it & will make it again!

An inaccurate review because we used bok choy instead of napa, no pear, half a peeled and seeded cucumber, and less red pepper than called for. For someone who can't handle or even access real kimchee it was a good substitute, a suggestion of the right flavors and textures. We enjoyed it with our homemade bulgogi.

I don't think that is picky at all. It is counted under Vegan, it should be Vegan.

Just to be picky, fish sauce is neither vegan or vegetarian. Thanks.

I know nothing about kimchi, but my husband loves it and asked me to try making this. We were both very happy with the result, and a visiting guest (also a kimchi fan) said he tasted no discernable difference between this and traditional kimchi. I followed the recipe to the letter except I used regular red pepper flakes and left out the asian pear (none available). It is easy to make and tasty; a new regular in our kitchen.
