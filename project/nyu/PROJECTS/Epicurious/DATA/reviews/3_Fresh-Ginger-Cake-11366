I have not made this yet, but for what it's worth, I strongly recommend looking at the Joy of Cooking's recipe for this cake. It calls for 1/2 cup of fresh ginger, while this calls for just 2 tsp. It sounds intimidating, but it is really great. Don't let me discourage you from trying this recipe, but definitely look in Joy.

I just made this cake for breakfast this morning. I didn't have any molassas so I substituted maple syrup. It is good, very moist, and very easy to make. I will try again with the molassas. Good for people who don't like super sweet cakes.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have any cognac, so I substituted a hard sauce - something called brandy butter, apparently used only in Britain for putting on top of puddings - in place of the cognac, butter, and some of the sugar. It came out fine, and when I tried later using brandy, I couldn't really tell the difference. People loved the taste of the ginger, which many gingerbreads don't really have. The gingerbread is great on its own, but goes well with the ice cream and pears. As with all pear recipes, though, I think a lot depends on getting good, ripe pears. Playing with the cooking time might help somewhat, but the underripe pears were noticeably hard, and the pear I'd had sitting out for a while got pretty mushy. This has become a regular favorite in my kitchen.

Enjoyable, as most desserts are, but nothing spectacular. I think it would be possible to concoct something a bit more interesting or complex with the same effort. I also felt that the cake and pears weren't the most balanced pairing; the cake is dense and moist, as a good gingerbread should be, while the pears and caramel sauce seem to be a better complement for ice cream or some sort of pudding. (I did try this with both ice cream and the ginger-pear sorbet, also an Epicurious recipe, and felt that the ice cream stood up to the cake and sauce better. I guess I'm learning that sorbets are generally too delicate to accompany heavy cakes.)

Have already made this twice and was excellent both times. The first time we did it with the carmelized pears but the pears were a little under-ripe so it wasn't as good. Served the second time with carmelized apples and was very tasty. Also, it goes perfect with home made vanilla icecream. Goes together so easily too. Definitely a family favorite already.

Simply delicious! Served with Haagen Daas vanilla frozen yoghurt and it was great. Can only imagine how good with the caramelized pears!

This is wonderful! I could see myself upping the ginger next time, but the flavor came through nicely. I didn't make the pears this time, as I had none in the house, and didn't feel like going to the store! I'll try them in the future. I served this with cinnamon ice cream--a nice combination. I do question, however, the recipe serving 2? I know it says with leftovers, but I served 4, and had leftovers..... Definitely a keeper; easy and delicious.

This ginger cake with the suggested pear sauce is really delicious. I used comice pears (my favorite). Everything can be made ahead - just quickly rewarm the pears in the carmel sauce. Good for guests. The pear sauce is very fragrant and luxurious. Cake can be made a day ahead.
