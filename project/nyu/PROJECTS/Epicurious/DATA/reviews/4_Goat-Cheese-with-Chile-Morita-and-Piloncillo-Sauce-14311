This recipe is absolutely delicious. My friend made this for a get-together and I almost ate the whole thing by myself! It is a must have appetizer for any occasion and very easy to make.

I admit, I was skeptical- never would have made this based on ingredients alone. I was surfing epicurious for something different to bring to a Cinco de Mayo pot luck I was going to. The reviews were spot on. OMG!!! This is the easiest most amazing app ever! The combination of sweet and heat and the unexpected taste of carmel is out of this world. Definitely get the piloncillo! I used the canned chile chipoltes in adobo sauce. Both found at local Hispanic market. Also added more canned chile to sauce for more heat. I took tips from others and formed into a ball (use saran to mold if too sticky). I served on a platter with the sauce poured over the ball creating a pool surrounding the ball of cheese. I served triangles of whole wheat pita that I had split and brushed with oil and sprinkled with kosher salt and baked in oven. I serve extra sauce in pitcher on side that can be poured onto ball as it gets eaten. AMAZING!!! I have brought it to every event i go to and people demand the recipe. My one friend said it is so good it can be eaten as an app and then as dessert! Divine! Make sure your guests know that the sauce is the best part!

OMG!! Made just the goat cheese spread and it was amazing!

No need for sauce, plus I kicked up this spread a notch (why I only gave the base recipe 3 forks). My twist is this: 4 oz soft goat cheese/8 oz Phili cream, 2 garlic cloves, 1 chipolte from the can (Ramstein Commissary: Embasa Chipoltes in Abobo sauce), 1/2 sm white onion, 1 generous pinch of sea salt - all ground into paste. Blend with cheeses, other 1/2 of sm onion finely chopped, 2 sm Thai Chilis thinly sliced, and a 1/2 tblsp of sauce from the can. Great spread, akin to the Turkish guy's spread in Real ;-) Cheers from Germany! ~ NCF

I was inspired to try this after it was mentioned in an episode of Bizarre Foods on the Travel Channel. I was amazed at how easy it was to make. I usually do a test run before trying things out on friends, but this was a major hit right out of the gate!

This is absolutely always a crowd pleaser. While it's a unique flavor combination, there is such a balance of flavors. A definite must for get togethers!

My daughter (38) and I both love this taste treat. I prefer a little less sugar in the sauce, but the savory, smoky flavor makes us come back for more!

This is a wonderful combination of sweet and savory-- balanced and sophisticated. The smokiness of the chipoltes works well with the sour freshness of the goat cheese. An impressive recipe. I serve this with sliced whole wheat pita bread that I've brushed with a little olive oil and toasted until crunchy.

Have already made this many times. Don't always have goat cheese available, but it still works okay using more cream cheese instead. Usually, I'll double the chipotle, but only make half the amount of sauce. I wonder if the person who said that goat cheese tastes the way a goat smells extends his same "logic" to say that regular cheeses taste the way a cow smells or that vegetables taste the way dirt smells.

There couldn't possibly be a be a better crowd pleaser than this recipe. Everyone raves about it again and again. It is so versatile - I've make it in wontons and fried them and served it with the carmel sauce as a dipping sauce. If you're doing it as a dip the pita chips you serve it with makes all the difference. Dont serve it with bread.

Definitive of Liberty Bar's sophisticated Texan sensibility, and an easy surprise hors d'oeuvre for your own upscale rustic entertaining.

I order this every time I go to Liberty Bar. Since I moved to NM, that happens a lot less often. I was so happy to find this recipe so I could indulge in this even when far from home. It's always a hit at parties.

Amazing! A friend made this for a party, and it's one of the best-tasting things I've ever had in my life. Perfect balance of spicy-to-sweet-to-neutral. Addictive... much, much tastier than the simple list of ingredients might suggest!

This recipe was not bad, just strange. It is like putting maple syrup on goat cheese. Some liked it, but my husband said never again!

Absolutely delicious appetizer!! Surprising combinations that work beautifully. Probably one of the most interesting appetizers I've prepared--this dish is a conversation starter! I use the chiles in adobo sauce and find that it's best to start light on the chiles and add more at the end, if needed. They pack a punch! I also strain the sauce after it's cooked. For presentation, I serve the sauce in a large, shallow soup bowl, then gently roll the cheese (that I've formed into a ball and refrigerated a few hours earlier) into the sauce puddle. This recipe should definately be made at least 3-4 hours in advance.

Delicioso! I've served this for several parties now, and someone always asks me for the recipe. It's terrific! I found the ingredients at a local Latin grocery store.

We love this recipe! I have brought it with me to several parties - formal and informal - it's always a big hit. It goes with everything! Crackers, bread, chips . . . it's all good!

I've made this recipe several times for various functions/parties and everyone loves it -especially those who like spicy. I usually serve it in two bowls - first dip the chip in the cheese mixture than in the sugar/cream mixture. The double dip.

This was really amazing! I flipped the proportions for the goat cheese and cream cheese (I love goat cheese)and doubled the chipolte amounts for both. Really improved overnight in the fridge and was devoured at the party the next day. I served it with frito scoops and grilled bread. Everyone used the sweet sauce but I was still left with quite a bit. Did we go really heavy on the cheese or was anyone else left with sugar sauce? I'd make about 2/3 next time of the sugar sauce.

I was expecting something more impressive. I did like the piloncillo sauce because you can use it as a dipping sauce for just about anything. The cheese spread was just ok. I doubled the amount of chipotle in both the sauce and the cheese spread. I think I'll stick to my chipotle dip that I make w/sour cream & lime.

I was thrilled to find this recipe! I always order it when we visit San Antonio and have lunch at our favorite Liberty Bar. I have tried for several years to guess how to make it. It was never quite right. Now thanks to you it was just like it!!! My guest loved it last night.

This is one of the best appetizers I've ever had. I just moved away from San Antonio, and the Liberty Bar is one of the places there I'll miss the most. I've been looking for a recipe similar theirs for this dish, and was so excited to accidentally come across their actual recipe!

I was so excited to see this recipe. This is one of my favorites. A great combination of flavors!

I was unable to find piloncillo sugar so I'm not sure what difference that would have made. It tasted great but wasn't so pretty to look at. In making it again, I'd grind the chiles more or strain them out at the end. It went well with Fritos (!).

Goat Cheese! Tastes like the goat smells. Thought I'd give this a try and could not get past the smell or taste of goat cheese. If you've never had goat cheese, but know what a goat smells like, you know what goat cheese tastes like. Gag me.

Absolutely outstanding. This ranked up there with my all time favorite appetizers. Everyone loved it and I will make it many times again. Very quick and simple!.

This was a total love-hate thing.. My French husband originally turned me on to goat cheese but thought this was disgusting! I, on the other hand thought it was very unusual but great. The only reason I may not make it again is because of the strong difference of opinion.. I would be skeptical to serve to company.

I had this at the Liberty Bar and thought I'd died and gone to heaven! Luckily, this recipe came out as well as I'd hoped. It makes a lot, but still tastes good the next day at room temp. Well worth making!

I was thrilled to find this recipe on your site. The Liberty Bar is one of my all time favorite eateries, and I would dine there at least once a week when I lived in San Antonio. Finding this recipe made me quite nostalgic. I tested this for myself and I can't wait to try it on friends here in Houston.

This was a good dip for those that have been salsa-outed and need a change of taste. I have used less cream cheese and it was just as good. Give your guest instructions on the best way to enjoy this dish, cheese first then the sugar. Make sure the sugar is heated before serving!

Thanks Liberty Bar. This is devine. I also like it because it can be made in advance. If it's served w/ chips the salt is a nice compliment to the hot & sweet. However, if you serve it w/ crackers the flavors really come forth. Yummy!
