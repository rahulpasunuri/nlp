This is so easy, healthy, and flavorful I will definitely be making it again and again. I added some cinnamon and allspice, and increased the olive (about twice what is called for).

Go easy on the cayenne; this is very spicy! (I used 1/16 tsp. and that was sufficient.)

Very simple and tasty, and nice to find a sweet potato recipe that doesn't include extra sweetening! I agree with the previous reviewer that I will try less cayenne next time. Portions are definitely on the small side.

We liked these so much, I made them two nights in a row. I made them first to go with salmon w/soy and maple syrup, the next night with Boca Burgers. A great alternative to fries, with lots of flavor. I'll definitely make again, and I think I'll do some experimenting. I did cut back on the cayenne the second time I made these.

Good Recipe but even better after I changed a few things. I prefer more of "fry." Added 1 TBS Soy Sauce to ingredient list. Cook at 350 for 45 to 50 minutes, flipping once so both sides of wedges are browned. Potatoes turn into crispy fries. Great served with Ketchup up with you favorite hot sauce.

A great starter recipe. I add lots of paprika and chile powder, maybe even some cumin, for a great spice rub and gorgeous color. I roast it at 400 for 50 minutes or so, and get GREAT caramelization. The outside is nice and chewy, and the inside is, as my client described, "like a souffle". I didn't like sweet potatoes much until I started treating them this way!

Good recipe. I will increase the spices the next time - but will make it again. Very easy and very tasty.

I increased the amount of oil to 1 tbs and brushed it on for complete coating (helping eliminate the dryness issue). Mixing all the spices together first makes it easier to sprinkle them on rather than doing it 1/8 tsp. at a time. Temperature-wise, 500 was fine, but I baked them on the middle rack, not the bottom. My boyfriend and I thought the amount of heat from the cayenne was just right.

We liked these but used way more seasonings than the recipe called for. How do you sprinkle 1/8 tsp. of anything over two cut up potatoes? The result was spicy, but not too much for our taste. Probably could have used a bit more oil and might try that next time.

Maybe my cayenne was especially spicy but I found this a bit HOT for my taste. Next time, I'll cut down on the cayenne.

Great! Simple yet flavorful. I had no trouble with the temperature -- but I only cooked them for about 12minutes. YUMMY!

Maybe it was the type of sweet potato I bought, but this was not impressive at all in presentation and the texture was very dry. The cooking temperature and length need to be adjusted - the heat is too high and the potatoes should not been done in the bottom of the oven as stated; the potatoes get too brown.

I love sweet potatoes. This was a really easy dish that turned out very nice. I added a bit more oil and cut the potatoes into rounds. I will make again.

This is an absolute favorite at our house. We make them so often that we made up a shaker full of spices so it's ready to go! We use a little more oil than the recipe calls for.

This has become a regular at our house. Very easy to make and the roasted sweet potato spears are delicious and lovely on the plate. The cayenne gives it a nice kick.

These potatoes are quite dry. I wouldn't recommend them unless you really love sweet potatoes.

Delicious, but be careful not to over do it on the spices. It sounds like hardly anything, but I usually even use less. They taste even better cold, or the next day.

I often make these potatoes without peeling them, using Kosher salt, olive oil and fresh rosemary and adding crushed garlic about 1 minute before they are done.Always a hit!
