Nice recipe. I had never really thought to make angel food cupcakes (which is what these turn out to be if you use a muffin tin, as I did) and this turned out well. I love the poppy seeds and the cakes are nice, but overall it's not that exciting. FYI, the recipe doesn't include details about using a muffin tin, so I tried both methods - using paper liners for some, and cooking spray in the others. Both came out without difficulty.

I had never made an angel food cake before and I was very pleased with the flavor and the texture. Instead of the lemon syrup, I glazed these with a simple lemon icing.

I've never made an angel food cake before, but, while it was really good, I thought it tasted pretty "eggy". I don't know if this is usual for this type of cake, or if I messed it up somehow. I'll keep working on it, though; I think it has potential.
