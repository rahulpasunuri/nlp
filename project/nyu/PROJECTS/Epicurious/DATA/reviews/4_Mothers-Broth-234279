This flavorful broth is an excellent no salt recipe. It has plenty of flavor and works well in sauces and soups.

This is one of my very favorite cookbooks and I make this broth all.the.time. It will change the way you think about broth... in a good way! :-) I use it in risottos, sauces, deglazing pans, and of course for plain old pastina in brodo, a favorite comfort food. Do let this recipe serve as a starting-off point, and personalize it as needed, or as your personal style emerges.

It's also a good idea to condense the broth if you are planning on freezing the broth for future use -- after straining, put back on a simmer til reduced by half. Homemade stock / broth makes a real difference!
