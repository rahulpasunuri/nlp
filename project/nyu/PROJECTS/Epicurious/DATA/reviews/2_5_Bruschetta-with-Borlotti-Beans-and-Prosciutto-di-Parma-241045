As written, the recipe doesn't work, the teaspoon of cayenne pepper is indeed a dealbreaker. Forewarned is forearmed, however, and reducing the red pepper to taste yields a tasty, versatile bean sauce that can be served over or under polenta, pasta, or, as written here, scooped out and served on good frenchbread with prosciutto and herbs. We had it tonight served in bowls with some creamy polenta spooned over the top. We'll use the leftover bean sauce to make the bruschetta tomorrow.

Hugely disappointing! This recipe is terrible in an all-around way - a teaspoon is WAY too much cayenne for this dish, the vinegar overwhelms the leeks and beans, and it is nearly an inedible dish that I will never make again.
