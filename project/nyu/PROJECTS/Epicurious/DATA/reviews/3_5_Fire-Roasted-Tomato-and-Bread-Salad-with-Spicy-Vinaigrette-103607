Fantastic recipe, I have been asked for the recipe several times. You can substitute fresh jalapeno for the canned chipotle chili. I also add baby spinach or arugula for an extra something something.

This is my all time favorite Epicurious recipe. The flavor combination is perfect. Grilling the bread and tomatoes elevates this above other tomato bread salad recipes and the addition of chipolte makes it truly an amazing salad. I usually wind-up eating half the bowl during the "standing" time. Bobby Flay gets an A+++ for this recipe.

Very popular at our house. It doesn't keep well, so don't make more than you're going to eat at one sitting.

This was easy and I was able to grill the tomatoes and bread at the same time as I vertically grilled a chicken so everything was ready at once. There were no leftovers!

I don't understand what's so fantastic about this recipe. I grilled tomatoes and bread on a charcoal grill, but the flavor did not come through. A lot of work for little return.

I was looking for other things to make this memorial day and happened upon this forgotten dish from last summer. This is DELISH! Goes great with a nice sauvignon blanc. Can't make for 15 people, but will make soon again for me and my husband. Seems like authentic italian (except for chiopotle - which I Love). A little different but most interesting.

I loved this salad for its smoky taste, but, unfortunately my family didn't care for it. They thought it was too "mushy". (too bad...because it would use up left over baguettes and the abundance of tomatoes from the garden)

The flavors in the salad are just out-of-this-world. Yes, it takes a bit more time to grill tomatoes and bread (vs. italian bread salads) - but if you like cilantro and chipotle, it's worth the time.

I had some initial reservations about making this salad but it is REALLY tasty! We will make this one of our regular side dishes. Be sure not to overcook the tomatoes on the grill. They are much nicer if still a little firm.

This recipe became a summer favorite with the first bite. I used dried chipotle, which I rehydrated in warm water, instead of canned and added about a teaspoon of sugar to the dressing. I highly recommend this salad. It makes a main course secondary.
