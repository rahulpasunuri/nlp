Excellent and quick! I also flavored with some garlic powder and parm cheese and used evoo instead of cooking spray. Great side dish.

To rmrhorses: I find that when oven-frying potatoes, I get better results if I soak the peeled and cut potatoes in cold water for a while before cooking. It helps them get crisper.

VERY VERY disapointing, SOGGY, no flavor. Nothing like the picture. Looked like it would present nicely on the plate. Hard to find good oven fried reciepes.

This was very good (who can resist crispy potatoes?) and beautiful. I struggled with the width of the potatoes. I made a "paper thin" batch and they nearly burned. So then I tried a batch that was about 1/8" thick--these were better, but still weren't quite like the photo. Nevertheless, very tasty and pretty. I made with the filet as another reviewer indicated, and the two paired nicely.

Forget the instructions. You don't need a mandoline or to bother doing these by hand. Instead, use a food processor, using the disk that produces the thinnest slices. Push the potatoes through slowly to ensure thin slices. Tweaking definitely helps. I've also sprinkled on a bit of grated cheese (a combination of parmesan and chedder works well), a little salt, pepper and paprika, and then sprayed it all with a bit of olive oil before popping it into the oven. Definitely double the recipe--my family loves this.

We loved them. We have started having them for a light snack. We just add a bit of seasoning salt.

I couldn't resist tweaking the recipe. I sprinkled the rounds with garlic powder and crumbled rosemary, and added a tiny bit of butter. The end result was fantastic--very light and crisp, and the edges browned nicely. The herbs really add more flavor to the dish.

I didn't have a mandoline, so I hand sliced the potatoes, that didn't work too well. The slices were uneven so they kept sliding off during the baking process. Also what did stay on didn't get crisp, it was dry and crisp on the outside rim, and soft in the middle. I probably wouldn't attempt this again until I get a mandoline.

Very simple, very wonderful!

Easy and excellent -- however, considering the irresistability of crispy potatoes, I suggest at least doubling the recipe.

This recipe was paired (in the magazine) with the filet mignon with mustard sauce (Sept 99). They do not make that clear online here.

Inspite of the simplicity of this recipe it had good flavor, not great but good. It makes a somewhat interesting presentation which is why I would consider making it again.
