I really wish there was more body to this, not my favorite recipe.

People give out WAY too MANY forks. It should be rare that a four fork is given. We found this to not be exceptional (4 forks) or even delicious (3 forks).I used to be able to use this site and know fairly for certain that a recipe would be worth making.This was very mediocre and the herbs were too much. Rosemary is potent and usually used with lamb or something stronger tasting than eggs.We threw most of it out. Please refrain from using 4 forks

People give out WAY too MANY 4 forks. This was neither exceptional nor delicious. My husband is always a fan of my food and he was not about to even finish it. I would not make again, as the herbs were too much

Very flavorful; it was a hit. Not too much work.

This is our go-to recipe when the husband and I are feeling like "breakfast for dinner." Quick, easy and delicious and makes great use of whatever you have in the fridge.

This was my first try making a frittata, and it was a hit! It's so quick & easy to make, and it tastes great. I agree with other reviewers about the versatility of this recipe. It's a great base and allows for all sorts of creativity. For my tastes, I'll probably increase the garlic and herb amounts next time, and maybe saute some asparagus or mushrooms with the onion. Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent & EASY fritatta. The fresh herbs really make it delish! Perfect to serve for company or a nice, light dinner quickly.

Light, easy, quick. French bread and a salad makes a nice dinner.

I made this dish for a Sunday brunch and it was superb! I left out the garlic and substitute extra sharp Cheddar cheese with Monterey Jack Cheese --it was fabulous! This dish is very versatile, you can substitute ham steak with large shrimps and it's still delicious! Will definitely make this again and again and again!

I was on a mission to find a frittata that sounded good to me. Also, I never made one before and wanted something simple. I added a sauted chopped red potato & garlic. After it was baked I sprinkled chopped tomatoes basil on top. I will use this recipe again but really experiment with it adding different vegetables.

This is a classic in our house. It takes wonderfully to alterations, as another reviewer pointed out. It scales up and down with no difficulty. A real keeper.

We had this for dinner the other night when we found ourselves with little in the fridge and little energy. It was easy to make and pretty good.

I don't eat eggs, so I couldn't really accurately rate this one, however, I made it for Mother's Day and was very pleased with the results. It was incredibly fast and easy and a great alternative to omelets. It presented very well and practically cooked itself. I made it with the Cinnamon Rolls with Pecans (GOTTA TRY EM!) and some brown sugar/cinnamon dredged bacon for Mothers Day. Very nice

I've made this a number of times for ...*ahem*... overnight guests. It looks very impressive coming out of the oven and it isn't difficult to prepare. Add some fresh fruit, toast and a steaming hot cuppa coffee - it's a great breakfast.

This is one of my favorite Sunday brunch dishes, and we make it often. It is also versatile. If I'm out of ham, I use sausage. I have also used a variety of cheeses (mozzarella, Italian mix, whatever we have on hand).
