To update my earlier review -- we left (I should say "forgot about") the sorbet in the freezer for 2 months after our initial tasting. It was much better tasting after two months as the flavors had really melded together. I'm making it again today and will do same.

I made the blueberry sorbet only. Used fresh berries. Didn't have Concord wine, so used creme de cassis liqueur, and used a bit less sugar. Overall was pretty easy to make. Be sure that you strain the mixture when done or you'll get a lot of seeds and berry skin in your end result. Tasted very fresh and a bit like apple rather than blueberry. Was a beautiful reddish-purple color. Will definitely make again.

Very flavoful. Substituted creme de cassis for the red wine. Only suggestion: either strain the blueberry mixture or blend it to a complete puree. Leaving bits as suggested means that you and guests will be looking for toothpicks and a mirror after eating.

have only made the grapefruit so far (not such a fan of blueberry sorbet), but it's scrumptious! definitely rather messy and labor-intensive, but the flavor is worth it. i used a bit less sugar than is called for, and the tart/sweet combination is wonderful. will certainly make again.

Selected this because blueberries are in season. Made the grapefruit exactly using Texas ruby reds. With the blueberry, used FRESH blueberries and instead of the concord wine substituted a mix of 1/2 Cassis- 1/2 dry red wine. My husband made an orange biscotti to accompany the coupe de sorbets. Turned out perfectly!!

I didn't make the blueberry sorbet - just the grapefruit, because I had 5 extra grapefruit hanging around. It is delicious and refreshing! The vodka apparently helps it from becoming too icy when it freezes, because it's got a nice smooth texture, but doesn't taste vodka-y. Very good and summery!

I made the blueberry sorbet with wild blueberries and it was delicious. My guests loved it.

I only made the blueberry sorbet. It was simple, and thats the only good thing I can say about it. It was to sweet and the taste of the blueberries was overpowered by the wine. Take it or leave it would sum up how I feel about this recipe. I'm sure some people would like this recipe, but I didn't.

I made these sorbets for a Valentines Dinner party as a palate cleanser between courses. Yum! It was so fresh tasting, and the two sorbets worked so well together (sweet blueberry and tart grapefruit). The only change I made is to replace about a third of the grapefruit juice with tangerine juice, which I loved. This recipe is a keeper.
