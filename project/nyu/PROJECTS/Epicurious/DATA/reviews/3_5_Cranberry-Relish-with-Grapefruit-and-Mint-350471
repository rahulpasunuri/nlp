this recipe didn't live up to the 4 fork rating. No one at our table touched it and I just ate it because someone had to try it. It won't make my Thanksgiving menu next year.

This was excellent and a big hit with the turkey. Will make this over and over again.

The mint, if you add it directly after cooking as the recipe directs, is completely overwhelmed by the other flavors. I recommend adding it after the relish has cooled and before serving. three forks because the two flavors, cranberry and grapefruit, seem to compete rather than to combine and create a new flavor.

I cooked this much longer...after the total 25 minutes recommended, the berries were still intact and the liquid was watery. An additional 30 minutes, cooking very slow, caused the liquid to reduce and thicken and the berries to burst and absorb the sugar and grapefruit flavors. It was delicious. A wonderful update to an old favorite!

This was excellent - the candied grapefruit was a nice touch. One for my Thanksgiving Tastebook!
