This recipe truly is exceptional! The crust is light and flaky. Instead of the Kahlúa I used Crème de cassis, which is a black currant liqueur. I used Smuckers seedless red raspberry jam. I also served mine with whipped cream. The tart was heavenly!

EXCELLENT! I used small remequins and did individual tarts. It looked extremelly good. I used Godiva Chocolate liquor and it was a great addition to the granache. The tart and the fresh fruits makes it not so heavy, which we liked a lot. My husband gave it an 11 out of 10!

Excellent! Don't be afraid to slather the jam over the fresh raspberries - it needs the sweetness. Great presentation. Serve small slices as its heavy.

delicious recipe. next time i'll spend a little more $$ and choose better chocolate. i don't like gooey fruit; so i put the raspberry jam directly over the cooled crust, then put the ganache over the jam. i topped with plain, fresh raspberries. yum!

I wanted to make a dessert with raspberries and chocolate. Everyone raved over this when I made it, but I thought it wasn't THAT incredible. It was definitely delicious, with a beautiful presentation. I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used extra Kahlua. I just didn't find the texture or combination of flavors that spectacular. It really was a decent pie crust with some decent chocolate cream on top, and some raspberries over that. Delicious because chocolate and raspberries together are always delicious, but not that special. I would definitely make it again though.

I used bittersweet and it was great. Couldn't find seedless jam anywhere, used some from Whole Foods and forced it through a strainer to get the seeds out. I agree that even with a 9 inch pan the chocolate layer was thin. Looks beautiful and makes an impression.

Delicious and easy to make. 25 minutes is too long to cook the crust though... it will burn after 15 or 20 unless you cover it up.

This was outstanding. Flaky crust and very thick layer of filling in the 9" tart pan. I used framboise instead of kahlua in the ganache.

My guests enjoyed this quite a bit, but they all agreed that it might be better if made with milk chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate. Also, the filling was a bit skimpy, so I would make more filling if I did it again.

The filling had a delicious coffee-chocolate taste, and I thought using bittersweet chocolate was perfect. The crust was wonderful and light. The jam coating on the raspberries made the tart glisten beautifully. My guests were impressed. I whipped the extra whippping cream and served it along side. Delicious, easy summer treat!

This crust was wonderfully flaky and tender as well as easy to work with. 20 minutes in the freezer made it easy to roll and transfer to tart pan. I used bittersweet chocolate which was a tad too bitter. Next time I will use semisweet and perhaps a tablespoon of sugar on the berries just before the glaze goes over them. Will definitely make again.
