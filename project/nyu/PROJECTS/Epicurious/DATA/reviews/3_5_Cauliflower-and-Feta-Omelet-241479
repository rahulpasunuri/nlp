I had made roasted cauliflower the night before and saved the leftovers so I checked Epicurious to see if it might go in a scramble and was delighted to find this recipe. It turned out I didn't have feta so I substituted some gruyere and used cilantro instead of parsley cause I just like it better. I sprinkled the scramble with sliced green onions and served it with TJ;s warmed flatbread cut in wedges and additional cilantro sprigs. My husband was moaning while eating it. Can't wait to make it with feta!!! YUM

What a nice switch up for cauliflower! I really liked how it teamed so well with the feta. I fried some bacon and used the drippings to saute the cauliflower...this added great flavour altho I did toss it in some paper towel to cut down on the grease factor. Instead of parsley, I added a bit of cilantro. This is really good...kids liked it.

Loved it! This is an awsome way to start the day. This recipe works really well, only I have added half a cup of chopped flat leaf parsley to the egg mixture.

I ate this for lunch today and it was great -- really quick and easy to make as well as delicious. I followed other reviewers advice of cutting the cauliflower into smaller pieces, but other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. The combination of feta and cauliflower is wonderful!

I cut my cauliflower into flat small "florets" and think that it worked well. Loved the flavors together.

Absolutely delicious! I can't eat eggs by themselves - upsets my stomach for some reason. But this one went down easy, and I even had seconds! Replaced the parsley with arugula. Definitely a keeper!

So easy, so delicious! I also replaced a couple of the eggs with egg whites. Other than that, I made the recipe as is, and I will be making it again. Yum!

Wonderful recipe! I cut the cauliflower into smaller pieces also and served a fruit dish with it. Will definately make this one again.

I would suggest replacing 3 of the eggs with just egg whites to reduce the fat content a bit.

I really enjoyed this dish. I took the suggestion of smaller cauliflower pieces and it worked out well. The only other improvement that can be made in my view is to use a little less salt. Other than that, the textures and flavors were delightful and made for a unique breakfast.

Interesting and tasty. Smaller pieces of cauliflower would work better. Good vegetarian fare.
