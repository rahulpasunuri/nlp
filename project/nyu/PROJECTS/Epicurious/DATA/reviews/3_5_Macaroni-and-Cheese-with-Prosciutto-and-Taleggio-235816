This is a great recipe. It's still great after I'm done modifying it :) . I don't see the point of pureeing the sauce... I did not bother with that. I made these changes: omitted parsley. Substituted: regular pepper for white peppercorn, onion for leek, 1/4 tsp thyme for fresh thyme, scallions for chives. Crisped prosciutto & rendered its fat; used fat to sautée veggies. Replaced heavy cream with a roux: whisk 1 tbsp butter + 2 tbsp flour in pan, then added the milk; adjusted sauce's viscosity with pasta boiling water. Assembled in three layers: pasta with sauce, prosciutto and sauteed veggies, then breadcrumb (tossed with olive oil and truffle oil).

I love rich food -- or so I thought until I made this mac & cheese. Three cups of cream! Delicious but deadly. Pass.

My husband and I made this decadent and unbelievably delicious dish for our Valentine's Day meal and it was fantastic. Very rich, so not something you will make often, but it's a wonderful indulgence for a special occasion. We decided not to blend the sauce and leave it whole, which added great texture, but next time I'll add ground white pepper instead of the whole peppercorns.

We really liked this. The wine and thyme give off such an awesome aroma. I substituted proscuitto for regular cubed ham and used a little more than what was called for since we're big ham lovers around my house. It's very good... a definite make again. But I did find it needs a bit more of a kick. Next time, I'll add more peppercorns.

I have a mixed review for this recipe. My husband loves this recipe and I make it for him. Unfortunately I do not care for the flavor combination that this dish creates. I will on occasion go to the bother of finding all of the ingredients in the stores and preparing the dish up to a certain point. I add the sauce to the noodles and stop at that point. I then divide up the mixture into 1 man portions and freeze them in food saver bags. I make sure that the noodles are slightly less then al dente so that when my husband goes to reheat the mac n cheese the noodles cook to the desired al dente. Because I use food saver bags to reheat I just boil some water on the stove and then drop the bag in the boiling water for about 5 min. All the other ingredients added to the mac n cheese are usually in the frig so my husband adds them after he boils the bag and before he broils it in the oven. By doing this my husband gets a gourmet meal any time I am gone or he gets to fend for himself for the night.

On a work trip to New York my dinner hosts ordered macaroni cheese to accompany the steak e were eating. My immediate thought was something flavourless and fake - like the only macaroni cheese I had ever tasted. I was completely mistaken! The macaroni at the retaurant was amazing, and I was desperate to find a recipe for a gourmet macaroni cheese to replicate at home. This is THE gourmet recipe - better than the one at the restaurant! I've made it a couple of times and while my husband has complained about the need for truffles in macaroni cheese, I think the results are absolutely worth it! And everyone who has tasted the dish has been blown away. A year after I first made it, one of my husband's male non-foodie friends keeps mentioning this dish! Yes it is rich, and has expensive ingredients, and it's not really simple to make, but the best foods in life never are? This is my gourmet addition to our BBQ table.

This was an awesome recipe for gourmet mac & cheese! I didn't think it took too long to make. I used a hand blender to puree the sauteed veggies and cheese, which saved time as well as dishes. I couldn't find Taleggio cheese at my local supermarket, so I used 2/3 Fontina and 1/3 Gruyere and it turned out great. I also substituted day-old bread crumbs with panko bread crumbs, which gave it a light and crunchy texture on the top. My only recommendation is to serve within 1 hour of making because I waited several hours and the dish wasn't as creamy as I would have liked.

I made this recipe when it originally appeared in the magazine. I still get begged to make it again, but it was so much work! It took me an entire day to locate all of the ingredients, and a long time to prepare once I got home. It tasted amazing, and it is a great special occasion dish. I just can't bring myself to do it again.

I adore taleggio, one of my favorite cheeses, so I started looking for recipes that would use it, like this one. Unfortunately, I think this recipe is huge lot of bother and expense and not really worth it. I made half of it, to experiment, and the only thing that was left out were the truffles. I did use truffle oil. It is very rich, but I doubt would be appreciated by most. It also did not reheat well, losing most of its flavor. For those who are subsituting brie, not a good choice. While taleggio is a semi-soft cheese, it is far more pungent than brie.

Quite good, but heavy. Makes a lot, so recommend making 1/2 recipe.

Dish had great flavor. I used a regular baking pan and cooked at 350 for 20 minutes to get dish hot and then added topping and Broiled. Omitted breadcrumbs and use Ritz Crackers instead.

Could not find taleggio cheese(made this last minute). Used Brie instead. Excellent dish! Very rich.

Excellent! I did not use truffles, but I did use the oil. Taleggio cheese really makes this dish.
