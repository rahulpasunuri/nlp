Easy and tasty - makes fresh corn even more delicious, which I didn't think possible.

Yum! I made it with fresh basil because I didn't have mint, and it was still excellent. The herb used can be flexible (as long as it's fresh!) If you're having trouble cutting the corn, cut it into thirds instead of fourths (so you have fewer slices to make). Drive the knife well into the cob, then pull the knife out and set it aside. Grasp the cob firmly and break it along the cut. Works much better than slicing the cobs and doesn't crush the corn kernels!

Making the dinner with the Grilled Pork with the Garlic Lime Sauce and had to try these as they were ready- husband said this was the corn on the cob he's ever had! Delicious!

I had some Greek feta to use up and I made some of this butter. I put it on some meat aside from the corn. It is just amazing.

Have been anxious to try and now so glad that I did. It was wonderful! Both my husband and my mother loved it. In fact, my husband asked if we could have it again tonight.

Very interesting and fresh flavour combination that was the talk of the dinner party - all yum's ! Since then, it has become my 'go to' recipe to make fresh corn on the cob very special. I use a much smaller portion of feta cheese than the original recipe calls for, and it still tastes fabulous.

This really was delicious, just different enough and a real hit at the BBQ I took it to. The hardest part was cutting the cobs. The fun part was mixing the corn and butter mixture together with my hands! I have had four requests for the recipe since the BBQ a week ago...definitely a crowd pleaser.

This was delicious but I think it would pair best with a light & healthy dinner b/c it makes the corn quite a heavy part of the meal. All the same, very yummy.

A hit! I made it with the cumin kebabs and roasted red pepper hummus with warm pita. DE-licious!

I was really skeptical but add me to the list of converts!!! Everyone went back for seconds and I'm pretty sure would have gone back for 3rds if I had made that much. Scrumptious!!!

Fantastic. I usually am leery of mint as it can be overpowering, but this dish was amazing. In fact the entire menu was amazing.

Wonderfully decadent way to serve corn on the cob. Went especially well with the Free Wheeling menu, but had enough left over that I will be serving it again, no matter the entree! I made a half recipe and it could cover six ears of corn.

The combination of salty cheese and sweet corn is terrific. I use cotija that I had left over. Ellie

I make this for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. I admit that the combination of feta and mint on corn sounded a little weird to me, but the results were great. The mint flavor is very subtle and the feta gets melted on the hot corn. I will make this often as it is so easy to throw together.

This was simple and delicious! A fantastic twist on regular corn on the cob. The mint and feta were the perfect addition. Everyone raved.

This was easy, delicious and so fresh tasting for summer! I've made it twice in the past week. Love it!

Not a fan of feta, so I had my doubts. But, turned out to be absolutely delicious. Now looking forward to making the rest of the menu.

this was VERY good! Due to the fact that my mint in the yard was sparse, I mixed in some fresh basil. I really liked the basil flavor, I might even for go mint next time.

We'll be doing this one again, and again, and again. So easy, so spectacular.

Had friends over --when I told them what it was, one replied, "No way, I hate Feta."

An awesome take on corn on the cob ... and another unexpected way to use the mint in the garden! Just add a cold beer and you have the perfect summer dinner ... bring lots of napkins ... :-)
