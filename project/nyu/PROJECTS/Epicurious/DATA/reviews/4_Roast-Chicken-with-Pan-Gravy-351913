OMG!! so good and so easy. I used 1 bouillon cube in 2 cups of water and simmered it with the giblets until I was ready to do the gravy - what a bonus!! My chickens were both about 6 pounds so I have lots of shredded chicken for other meals.

450 is too hot! Smokey kitchen and burned pan drippings, not to make a delicious gravy with. Disappointing indeed. Will try again with a lower temp oven..

This was delicious, and the chicken cooked quickly, but is it just me? The 450 degree oven caused all that butter to burn and fill the kitchen with smoke that burned my eyes for the entire cooking time...not to mention the grease covered oven. Not sure it was worth it. Surely a chicken roasted another way without all the mess and discomfort is out there!

My new standard for roast chicken. I'd never made roasted chicken from a recipe before and loved having a foolproof guide (especially when making it for 12 hungry family members). Made it exactly as directed and everything turned out perfectly. Chicken was juicy and everyone loved the gravy. This will be my only chicken recipe from now on.

i was afraid to roast a chicken again after setting off the fire alarm in my old apartment building, but this turned out beautifully. i didn't have garlic, so I used shallots, and I didn't have a lemon, so i used an orange. the chicken has crispy, brown skin and a moist, flavorful breast. i didn't get much in terms of pan juices, but i ate what gravy i was able to make with a spoon like it was soup. i'm not proud, but there it is.

This recipe restored my faith in oven baked chicken. I do a variation of this on chicken quarters almost every other week because I love it so much(it also takes less time to cook than two whole chickens). I line the bottom of my baking dish with lemon slices and sprigs of thyme, rosemary, and parsley to give the chicken a little extra flavor.

Easy and delicious! Both the chicken and gravy were wonderful.

I made this basically as written for my sweetheart and I. Only real adjustment were extra garlic, using olive oil as well as butter (to cut fat), and a whole (small) lemon in each cavity. The preparation took longer than advertised, maybe because it was my first time roasting chicken. I couldn't get my gravy to thicken, even after adding an extra tbsp. of flour. With all that said, chicken and gravy both tasted delicious and the chicken was wonderfully moist. I served with wild rice and broccoli. I'm planning to use the extra chicken to make the Layered Chicken Enchiladas with Tomatillo-Cilantro Sauce later this week.

Super! So straightforward and easy to prepare, you think you might of missed something! I did salt (kosher) and pepper liberally which made the skin delicious! Cooked 60 minutes - basting and spinning every 20 minutes and then allowed to rest an additional 20 minutes covered. Chook was perfectly moist.

Very good recipe, easy to follow and the end result is delicious! I actually cooked this (but still in the pan) on my gas grill using indirect heat. My pan was small for two chickens thus I couldn't baste with the juices. I used olive oil and butter instead. Definitely a repeat at my house !

I have tried so many "the best" roast chicken recipes, it makes my head spin. This really worked. I did brine the chicken first for 1 1/2 hours. Otherwise, just as the recipe said. A definite keeper.

This is a wonderful recipe! I added 4 tablespoons of chopped rosemary to the salt and pepper and then rubbed the birds down with that mixture. The only note I would add is that I cooked them 1.5 hours and the garlic burned a bit. In the future, I would rub the garlic and butter under the skin and inside the bird to avoid that from happening again.

We LOVED this chicken, incredibly moist and tender, and simple. Pan gravy was excellent. Only change made was to reduce the butter added to the gravy- I only used 2 T (to reduce fat) and we never missed it. The idea is brilliant- making this chicken created a large mess, but cooking one chicken would have been the same mess, and now we'll get 4 meals out of it! Highly recommend.

My family loved this chicken. It was moist with good flavor. I would definitely serve with mashed potatoes the next time.I made pulled chicken sandwiches with meat from 2nd chicken and it was delicious.
