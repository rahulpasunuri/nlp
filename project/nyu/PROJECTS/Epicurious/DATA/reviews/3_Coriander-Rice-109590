DD from San Francisco I make this as a side dish for summer BBQ's. Wonderful flavors, good filler and great with grilled dishes.

Easy to make. Won't knock your socks off but a very nice variation on white rice. I made half the recipe which was enough for leftovers for two people. Used jasmine rice. I think I might use fresh cilantro instead of parsley next time and perhaps throw in some soaked golden raisins.

Subtle, colorful, fragrant and delicious... I made this for just the two of us ..cutting it down appropriately, and it was lovely. A good accompaniment to the Cornish Game Hens with Sweet Vermouth and Garlic also online.

This was nothing special. My husband and I agreed it was too salty and tasted like it came straight out of a package.

Fantastic and easy. Next time I'll cut bigger chunks of shallot. Can't really taste them when they are minced.

I did this with the spiced lamb chops with mint-mango sauce. I thought it was tasty and complimented the lambs chops well. Everybody loved it!

This was just okay - I think I was expecting it to have a bit more umph. Kind of reminded me of saffron yellow rice from the grocery (already spiced). Nothing special.

I made this recipe with the Garlic Roasted Shrimp with Smoked Paprika recipe and it was incredible. My friends and husband loved it and everyone made yummy noises while they ate it. The rice has a sort of biryani quality to it but was far easier to make. I reduced the recipe to one third of the quantities listed and it was enough for 4 people with leftovers.

I followed the recipe exactly, as well. It's delicious! A good, flavorful alternative to plain white rice. The turmeric adds color to the dinner plate. And it's so easy to prepare!

I loved this recipe. I used Jasmine rice and followed the recipe exactly. I served it as a side to Grilled Mahi-Mahi with Avocado-Melon Salsa from the same issue. I also made the Grilled Vegetable Skewers - all worth a repeat.
