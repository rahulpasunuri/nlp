I love this recipe but I am going to jazz it up with curry, portabellos, yellow pepper and asparagus with sliced stiploin steak on the side. Do use the stalks of the Swiss chard, just cook them a little earlier so they get tender. They are good and tasty.

This dish is called nivik in armenian and is a staple among the dishes during lent. My mom usually puts more onions and a tablespoon of pepper paste and a teaspoon of tomato paste. The swiss chard can be substituted with spinach. Cayenne pepper is also good, but the idea of smoked paprika is definetly intriguing, I will try it! But curry or feta cheese...that seems quite off the radar. This is supposed to be a simple dish with not too many flavours happening at the same time. The trick is not to overcook it.

Tasty, healthy and easy weeknight dinner that I will make again. Thanks to the other commenters, I added curry powder, smoked paprika, cumin and a pinch of chili flakes and added salt the whole way through, and it was quite flavorful. Used a can each of diced tomatoes & chickpeas (served 4). Sauteed the chard stems with the onion and garlic. Used a whole lemon at the end and served over cous cous.

Not great - kinda boring.

Hmmm, this just seemed very bland to me. I even added lemon juice and curry.

As others, I added some spices... a bit of sweet curry, corriander, cumin and smoked paprika. Absolutely delicious!

3 forks for the original recipe, but four when I followed other reviewers' suggestions and jazzed this up with turmeric, chili powder, curry and cumin, and doubled the lemon juice, and added Frank's Red Hot sauce, creating a really excellent vegetarian curry of sorts. Don't pass this up. Kids wouldn't touch it, but they really missed out as far as I'm concerned. Great recipe.

Hearty, yummy, a great entree (served over quinoa) even for a meat eating crowd. Doubled the recipe, added paprika, crushed red pepper, tons of lemon juice & pulp. Used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and parboiled the chard stems before adding with leaves. Cheap and sooo satisfying. Loved it with a dollop of chevre. After everything was chopped, really easy, too!

Fantastic dish! I added some smoked paprika, corriander and a dash of cayenne. The lemon really makes this dish special. I served over a blend of whole grains.

This was a great, easy vegetarian entree. I did modify it slightly according to the various other reviewers' instructions--used two cups of chickpeas (one can), 2 cloves garlic, four plum/roma tomatoes instead of one small regular one, and added one teaspoon of cumin and a quarter teaspoon of coriander. I served it over rice. Very tasty, and did I say easy?

I liked the basic idea, but wanted more seasoning. I used both stalks and chard leaves. choppinb both separately, adding stalks with the chickpeas, and leaves a bit later. I also added red curry powder, chopped fresh basil and oregano, and a bit more lemon juice. When serving, I added a little crumbled goat cheese to each portion and mixed it in, forming a rich and delicious sauce and a creamy texture. I might serve this with rice alongside for a complete meal. I really liked this and will make it again.

Kind of bland but will make again. Will look through comments for suggestions.

I went ahead and added some curry,but I also used canned Italian tomatos with basil and oregano and the spices were great.

I was looking for something to do with chard & was under-whelmed by the last recipe I tried. However this was great. I had some extra shallots lying around, so I threw those in too. With some good crusty bread on the side, it made a great meal.

I liked this a lot and my husband really liked it. I'll definitely make again. This is a recipe that you can play around with and make your own. I would spice it up a bit next time w/curry or something else a bit exotic.

I make this dish about every two weeks or so. If tomatoes aren't in season, I use canned and it still tastes great. Sometimes I use spinach or other greens instead of chard, and I usually throw in cumin, coriander, turmeric and red pepper flakes to make it a little more peppy. I serve it on top of rice with a little plain yogurt. It's really easy and really fast -- a great vegetarian main dish, though the recipe as is needs a little spicing up.

Thanks for the Feta suggestion! It made this dish creamy and tasty. I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the fresh tomato. I boiled the chard first (15 min)including the thick stems chopped. I also added some crushed red pepper as suggested. Yum!!!

Really underwhelmed. Maybe with more onions, tomatoes and some red pepper flakes, but probably would rather look for another recipe than tinker with this one.

Very good: used a whole can of chick peas. This vegtable with a piece of grilled chicken breast atop it, sprinkled with a bit of parmesan cheese, makes a tasty low-carb dish.

Loved it. Ate it as a 1 dish-meal last night and felt totally satisfied. Fresh tomatoes are nasty here this time of year, so used a well-drained can of diced tomatoes. Threw in the whole can of chick-peas as well. I thought the lemon totally made it - might crumble some feta on top next time, but just for the heck of it, not that it necessarily needed it.

I LOVED this recipe! I am always looking for different ways to cook swiss chard and this one wins. This dish is so good, I would eat it as a main course with nothing else. Enjoy!

Very easy and surprisingly tasty. A great side-dish (although with the chickpeas it could also become a main dish) to throw together at the last minute with ingredients found in the cupboard and fridge!

A definite keeper. Simple but tasty.

I was out of chickpeas so I used a can of Northern white beans and I also used the whole can. I added additional garlic,used 2 small plum tomatoes and only used 1 tbsp of oil plus some cooking spray. Served iwth vegetarian sausage and felt like I was getting a delicious and highly nutrious meal. It will be a staple in my house.

This is quick and easy and very tasty. I used an entire can of chickpeas and quite a lot of swiss chard, but the balance was fine. This is a good side dish for just about anything.

Easy, quick, tasty, healthy and delicious. What more can you ask for. I added a little paprika to olive oil and I fried the onions a little more than the recipie calls for. But other than that, I pretty much stuck to the directions and I will definitely make it again.

Delicious. Add some hot pepper flakes for a little zip.

This was very tasty and easy to make. I put parmesan cheese on the top and it gave it just a little zip. I plan to add a tablespoon or so of tomato paste to it and serve over orzo. It's great for someone who has swiss chard in their garden!!

Very tasty; used one apple as I didn't have tomato, added it a little later and it turned out awesome. Also kept the ribs in (from red chard) and steamed a little longer. Added some chopped lemon pulp too. Delicious, meatyish taste!

Simple and delicious! I added tamari (as I do to most vegetable dishes) to give it a little more flavor.

Also served with couscous...leftovers are even better!

I made this last night and loved it - so did my husband. I was skeptical about how good it would be based upon the few ingredients, but they blend together wonderfully, it's so tasty. We had it over brown rice.

I love this recipe! It's so fresh and good for you. Although the first time I made it I didn't put in enough chard. So good, still.

Never really knew what to do with chard. I'm glad I found this recipe. It's easy and good. My husband says he'd eat this everyday. (I served it over couscous as was recommended by another cook.)
