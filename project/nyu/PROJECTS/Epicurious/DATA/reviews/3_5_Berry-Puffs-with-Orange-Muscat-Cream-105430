Bleh! I found this to be an insipid mess. I will save puff paste for savory dishes in future.

I've now made this several times for guests and when asked to bring a dessert to another's function. You can make ahead, it travels well and assembly is easy. Very impressive for not much labor. Definitely a keeper.

Easy and lovely. It was my first time to work with puff pastry. It was very easy. When I tried to reduce the Elysium, it scorched the first tiime, so, I redid it over a double boiler, which worked well. I used wild blackberies in the berry puree. The berry puree does make extra, so I lavished the extra into the insides of the split pastry triangles. The guests and my husband loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I made this for my wife for Mothers Day, The entire family loved it. Very easy to prepare, yet looks like a very fancy dessert. Used puff pastery with Strawberries and golden raspberries. I also made extra muscat cream to top off with.The kids fought over the one extra puff, and my wife wants to know when I'll make it again.

We really enjoyed this dessert. We made homemade puff pastry instead of using frozen, and made extra orange cream for the filling. Poured lots of berry puree over the top. Tasted great and presented very well!

This was wonderful! It is very impressive to your guests. You can make everything in advance and just assemble when ready. I brushed the berry glaze on the inside of the puff pastry also not just on the outside. It gave it some added berry flavor. This will now become one of my signature desserts.

Oh-my-gosh this is good! Watch so the orange muscat doesn't scorch (mine did and I had to throw it out and start again-major bummer- but I stopped boiling the 2nd batch at about 2-3 Tbs.). I suggest making more muscat cream than recipe calls for - it is wonderful stuff. Didn't have raspberries so we used tayberries and blackberries and that was delish. An elegant dish to serve guests. Make the various parts ahead of time if you are entertaining and it goes together in a flash.
