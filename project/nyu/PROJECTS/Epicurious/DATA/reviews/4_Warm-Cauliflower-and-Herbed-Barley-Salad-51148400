When a new dish becomes an instant family legend as in, "Remember when mom made that cauliflower barley salad?!" followed by rolling-on-the-floor laughter... Let's just say even the comedic value isn't enough for me to make this one again. We love cauliflower (try the recipe on this site with Kalamata vinaigrette), but for us the mix of ingredients in this was not a winning combination.

Not bad, just sort of bland. I expected more flavor. Healthy, and light, it would make a good summer meal. There are too many really good recipes out there to make this one again.

This was excellent! I swapped in lentils rather than butter beans and threw in a few handfuls of rocket. It's a great base for a salad. I loved the addition of barley - a nice change!

I've made this twice and it's been enjoyed both hot and room termperature. I couldn't find the Gigante beans the first time I made it so I used Great Northern beans. I second time I made with the Gigante. I prefer the smaller beans as it's not as pasty.

Delicious and Beautiful.... Used fresh fava beans, less oil and farro. I'm going to make it now --- just picked some more fava beans and have it for dinner.

Very happy with this - roasted the cauliflower, used half the oil, substituted sour cream for mayo, and quinoa for barley. It was great!

I found the dressing a little too oily and preferred it warm over cold. Probably wouldn't make this again unless I had cauliflower I needed to use.

Healthy and filling. I thought it was a little heavy on lemon, I'd maybe start with 1-2 TBSPs and add more to taste next time. I bought great northern beans because they *sounded* big (but turned out not to be). They were ok, but I would use butter beans next time, or try to find the gigantes, which I did not see at my store this time around. Especially loved the browned cauliflower, and the fresh tarragon.

Loved this recipe !! I have made it 3 times. I made it without the taragon and added extra lemon zest. I served it both warm and cold and everyone had seconds. Adding kalamata olives makes it more Greek. Great for Veggies since it has both grain and beans. I cook the cauliflour in my cast Iron skillet to get nice color on the caulifour. I pinned this ??

easy, filling and tasty! Use farroh or some other grain to make it gluten free...

Very delicious and easy to make. I used cannelini beans instead of gigante. I will definitely make again (and would consider adding other items like others have suggested... olives, or dried cranberries, or nuts). It's a filling lunch a quite healthy. I will also definitely start using barley for other recipes/side dishes as well; it's great!

Absolutely fantastic as a main dish salad, bursting with fresh flavor. I roasted the cauliflower instead of frying to give it additional texture.

Totally surprised by how good this was. Even my husband commented approvingly. Made as directed; definitely a keeper.

This was pretty good although I would roast the cauliflower next time for a little more flavor and a lot less cleanup. I had a few cherry tomatoes to get rid of, so I added those (a little bit of color) and wish I had added black olives and almonds for more flavor and texture. Tarragon was a good addition.

@ Temecula: How about rice? I bet fresh corn, cut off the cob, would also be fantastic, but would change it to a completely different recipe! No rating because I haven't tried this yet, but I'm going to!

Yummy! Just made it for lunch and it is a great combination of flavors and textures. Adding the warm cauliflower transforms it in to a comfort food.

This salad is excellent! Just wondering if anyone can recommend a sub for the barley--my daughter is gluten sensitive and cant eat it.

As all the previous reviewers have said, this is a very good recipe. Even people who are used to eating meat and potatoes for dinner can enjoy this salad. Even without the tarragon (too early for tarragon in our garden) this was outstanding. I could not find the beans asked for in the recipe, so I substituted borlotti beans, and it was still delicious.

This was damn good. A different healthy salad.

I replaced the mayo with dijon and added kale leaves with the water while finishing the cauliflower. Delicious, healthy and filling!

Easy and tasty! I added chopped olives and topped with chopped toasted almonds - nice contrasts! Also, substituted the mayo for Greek yogurt.

Gosh I love Bon Appetit and their recipes. This salad is no exception, it was SO good and SO healthy tasting. I made it as a side dish with chicken but loved it so much I ate just that as the main (vegetarian) meal. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't have butter beans on hand so substituted chick peas and it was perfect. I am definitely making it agagin, either way.

This was delicious! My husband omitted the beans and added kale, and also added baked halibut marinated in citrus, basil and olive oil.
