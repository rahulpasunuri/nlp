We had this with the artichokes and everyone -- including my 8 & 16 yr olds -- loved it. I used 1/3 C oil and thought it was just right.

I, personally, doesn't found it so delicious as it is a bit plain for me. However, my family found it was very nice. And I did it more often. Well... it goes very well with endives, too, I think.

Served this over baby lettuces for Easter salad. My bachelor son wanted the recipe. I took some of it ahead of time and put it on some rosemary sourdough bread for a snack---as good as on the salad!
