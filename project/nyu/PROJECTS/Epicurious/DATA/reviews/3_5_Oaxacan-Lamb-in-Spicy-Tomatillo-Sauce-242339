Surprisingly delicious - I followed previous reviewers substitutes (bay leaves & fennel seeds) since Mexican ingredients are hard to come by in my part of the world. I charred the tomatillos, and added extra garlic and carmelized onions for a little extra flavor. The shanks were a bit of work to shred due to all of the tendons etc. After tasting it, I had to add some salt (missing from the recipe). I also ended up adding a bit of hot sauce, like a previous reviewer, to give it extra kick. I'm not a big fan of lamb, but I found that the tomatillo sauce removes the 'gaminess' of the meat. I used most of the meat as a tamale filling.

This was very good. I did not boil the tomatillos in water but just halved them and added them to a saucepan on low heat. They soon gave up their juices, this avoided later sauce reductions. I added caramelized onions (one onion) to the mix in the blender. This gave the sauce more depth of flavor. Substituted dried morita chiles and bay leaves (for the advocado leaves). Also scraped out the marrow from the bones and added to the sauce. Finally i adjusted the heat with some bottled habanero sauce. Think that the spicy heat needs to be tweaked so as to balance the unctuous and tart nature of the sauce.

Easy and very good. I was not able to find avocado leaves in time, so I used bay leaves plus a tsp of crushed fennel seeds instead. It worked very well. I used ancho pepper instead of the costeno rojo chiles. Delicious! Next time, I'll try it with the avocado leaves.
