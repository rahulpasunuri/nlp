This was a huge hit at our July 4th barbecue. We used the blueberry sorbet, along with strawberry rhubarb sorbet we had previously made and Haagen Daz lemon sorbet. It was more pink, white and purple than red white and blue but it was delicious and refreshing on a super hot day. It was also super easy!

This was great! Everyone loved it at our Fourth of July party. I used lemon sorbet instead of lemon ice cream.

A couple of additions that I neglected to mention. 1.I would line the springform pan with saran wrap for easier removal. 2.Instead of serving the cake with whole blueberries, I made a simple blueberry sauce by simmering one pint of berries with abt. 3 T's of sugar and juice of one lemon until thick and then added 1/2 pint more of blueberries and simmered a couple of minutes so that they still hold their shape. Of course,freshly made whipped cream enhanced the experience.

I made this for a dinner party for 24 people on July 14th to rave reviews. Rather than making extra syrup, I used the syrup from the sugared lemon rinds & added a touch of salt. I also used freshly frozen strawberries and blueberries and thus didn't need to refrigerate the mix before it went into the ice cream maker. The sugared rinds added a lovely touch to the lemon ice cream. I will definately make this one again

I actually didn't make the recipe but if it's from Matt and Gab, I guarantee you it will be delicious. Making a trip to Princeton is worth a visit to the Bent Spoon alone! I am a loyal "townie" and go at least once a week even in the winter.

We made this for a pre-Fourth party and it was a huge hit. Not too difficult, but would recommend breaking it down into stages and then assembling.
