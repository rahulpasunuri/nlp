Excellent appetizer. The dinner party guests all raved about them. They look professionally prepared (people were very impressed that I made them) and the flavor is excellent. Thanks to previous reviews I used thread for cutting the cheese and it made all the difference.

Rave reviews from guests, these went fast and were very easy to make. Huge hit. I used an olive & sun-dried tomato spread instead of the tapenade and just balsamic instead of sherry. Yummy.

These were great & looked even better - perfect for thanksgiving. I went back and forth on the ratio of goat cheese to olive tapenade. Some didn't allow the olives to cut through enough (which seems odd with such a strong flavor), but when you have too much goat on there it's tough. I would definitely be more careful next time in order to get it right.

I made this for my Italian boyfriend and his cousins and everyone loved it. It was tough getting the goat cheese to slice cleanly, but the crumbles tasted just as good. The various layers of flavors were so great. I will definitely make these again. Easy, impressive-looking and tasty!

I've made this twice now to rave reviews. It's delicious and easy.

I received rave Reviews!! I was embarassed to tell how easy it was! I used less goat cheese and fresh tapenade, a good baguette goes a long way too! A keeper in my "portfolio"! Thanks.

I really enjoyed this appetizer and it was easy to pull together.

I received rave reviews on these at a recent appetizer party. I did make a few changes, because of time constraints and absentmindedness. First, I toasted the baguette slices without any oil. Second, I cut the goat cheese thinner because 1/2 inch of a 2" diameter cheese log seemed like too much for a 2-bite appetizer. Third, I forgot to mix in the sundried tomatoes. I probably used more tapenade (Trader Joe's brand) than called for in the recipe, I just spread on a thin layer. The best part about this recipe is that if you run out of any of the 3 toppings, you can just have some baguette slices with just two (or even one) of the toppings, and it's still great.

I made this recipe twice during the Holiday season and received platitudes and requests for the recipe from all. I did not skin the the tomatoes and halved the amount of goat cheese using a wire or dental floss to slice more easily. I also used homemade tepanade.

Great party appetizer. Used balsamic b/c I think it goes better with summer tomatoes/basil. The combination of tapenade, fresh/dried tomatoes, basil and goat cheese was perfect for a summer party dish. Only had a few left out of an entire large baguette. Toasted the bread and mixed tomatoes in advance then put it all together 30 minutes before the party.

Fabulous for parties! This gets four forks for both presentation and taste! I sub'd red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar, and used a jarred olive tapenade-like mix used to top bruschetta and it worked out fine. Lots of raves and it looks elegant and colorful.

They tasted good, but next time I think I will increase the tapenade. It was hard to get at with all the other "stuff" on top. I will also add the tomato mixture after baking next time because it is prettier that way. I substituted champagne vinegar instead of sherry vinegar and it was quite yummy.

Absolutely fabulous! I use less goat cheese than the recipe calls for, and also sometimes make larger toasts. In a pinch I've used a pre-made tomato bruschetta topping, although the original recipe is better. I've made this 5+ times - always a hit.

This is an amazing recipe. I served it at a dinner party and it was a complete hit. I did use the sundried tomatoes in packed in oil, but didn't sprinkle the oil on the tartlets before sticking them in the oven... and was still really good!

My sun-dried tomatoes were a little chewy, so I soaked them in hot water for a bit to soften them up. Worked great. Used balsamic vinegar and a little less goat cheese than called for. Also gave up slicing the goat cheese after a while, which turned out to be no big deal. My guests INHALED these, and then asked for the recipe.

This recipe was great tasting and nice looking. The goat cheese was a bit messy to slice. Everyone was impressed!

This recipe is delicious! I don't use the olive tapenade, and I use more tomato mixture and less goat cheese than the recipe calls for. Also, I use red wine vinegar, which is delicious.

This is one of the best recipes we've pulled down from this site. We've made it 4 or 5 times now, always to rave reviews. We've been going slightly easy on the goat cheese (probably 2/3 of what the recipe calls for). When we're in a hurry we buy pre-made toast and coat them with a little more olive oil (not as good, but better than not having them).We also substitute a high quality balsamic for the Sherry vinegar. Other than that, we've followed the recipe and enjoy it very much!

I am happy to find this recipe. Saw something similar on Barefoot Contessa TV show, but didn't find the same thing in her book on Paris. This is great, quick lunch with salad, Will eat it again and again!

Absolutely delicious. Took a few short cuts. Didn't peel and seed tomatoes and initially broiled slices to slightly brown. Used olive paste rather than tapenade. Really terrific and easy.

This was awesome! I made this for a work party and for my family the night before. My kids and co-workers raved about these! I followed the advice of others and went easy on the tapanade and goat cheese, substituted balsamic and made extra of the topping. I will definitely make this again and again.

this was SO good!!! i used balsamic instead of the sherry vinegar, which i would do again. instead of slices of goat cheese, i mixed the log with a tbsp or so of heavy cream and spread it on top of the tapenade. the flavors all complemented each other wonderfully, i would make this again in a heartbeat!

Amazing all around; taste great, super easy and my cooking group loved it. I made some with the tapenade and somewith out, both were a hit.

This is a great recipe! I have made it several times & everyone loves it. You can make the tomato mix ahead of time and put it in the fridge. It's easy as well - I don't think you can mess this one up. But people think it's gourmet!

I served this at my monthly book group meeting (celebrating our 10th year of wonderful potluck meals and interesting fiction.) It was a hit and of course everyone had to have the recipe. It was extremely easy to make and except for the sherry vinegar (substituted balsamic,) the ingredients were easy to find. Will make this again and again....

One of the best recipes I've made in a long time. I served it to a party of ten and everyone raved about it. Substituting balsamic vinegar for the sherry works very well.

Wow, these are great. They're very filling, and paired with soup could easily comprise a great weeknight dinner. Everything the other cooks have said--easy on the tapenade, chop rather than julienne the sun-dried tomatoes, use balsamic vinegar rather than sherry vinegar, and double the amount of basil--was right on the money. Fantastic.

These were great and I have some advice for any novice chefs out there (learn from my mistakes hopefully). Go easy on the tapenade because it can be overpowering. I found it easier to eat when the tomatoes were cut in half after being julienned. Basically, its important to find the right balance of the toppings to aquire the taste you are looking for depending on your preferences.

These are so delicious!! I used extra sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. I can't wait to make these again- I'm so glad fresh tomatoes are coming into season soon. Five forks...amazingly easy and tasty!

Excellent! I also substituted balsamic and let the tomatoes, sun dried and basil macerate for a while. I baked them at 500F and it gave everything a nice color. This would also make a great first course.

Excellent! I substituted balsalmic for the sherry and it was very good. Next time I will add more sun dried tomatoes and basil.

These have become my favorite hors d'oeuvres...they're absolutely delicious! I add a little bit more basil and sun-dried tomatoes, use red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and make the baguettes extra crisp. I agree...no need for the last drizzles of olive oil...they are already packed with so much flavor!

A friend made this recipe for a party I attended and eveyone loved it. I made it myself and it was great and served it for Chrismas. It was easy and most of it can be prepared ahead and just pop in over before about to serve.

So easy to prepare and was the hit of the party last night. Used red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar and it was fine. I prepared up to the last step just before leaving for the party and popped it in the oven for 5 minutes at the hostess' house. This worked great.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I love all the ingredients in this dish, but put together it tasted terrible! Also, to my surprise, the exact ingredients were very difficult to find which made what should have been a simple dish a big bother. This won't be a "repeat" recipe for me.

Delicious and easy. I skipped the last drizzles of oil and used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. They were a huge hit at 2 separate parties.

It is very tasty, and easy to make. Goat cheese and sundried tomatoes are very complimentary flavors together.

This is a very easy recipe and we all loved it. The second time I made it I used tartlet shells that I baked in mini muffin tins after cutting with a star-shaped cutter, using a dough that had lemon peel in it. They were a very pretty presentation.

Amazingly yummy!!!!I will use 1 additional Tablespoon of fresh basil for the mixture and I will try it with Balsamic Vinegar instead of the Sherry. No need for the last 2 drizzles of oil.

I made this for a family brunch a few weeks ago and it was great. I am going to make again next week for a cocktail party.

I made this for a club wine and cheese party. Each couple was to bring a bottle of wine and an appetizer. It went together easily, transported nicely, was delicious, and was the hit of all of the appetizers. Many people wanted the recipe. Today I recieved a phone call from a friend who wasn't at the party, but heard about the dish and wants the recipe. The only change I made was to put the tomato mixture on AFTER I baked the tartines. As I was taking them someplace, rather than serving them immediately, I didn't want the tomatoes to break down.
