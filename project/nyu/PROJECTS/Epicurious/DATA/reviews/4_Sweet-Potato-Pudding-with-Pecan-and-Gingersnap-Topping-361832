Whats not to like. I'm not a sweet potato fan but this recipe is fantastic. No changes needed make it just as written. Delicious. A permanent addition to our holiday menu.

Cooks corner to cut! This will take about 30-40 minutes out of the prep time. Instead of roasting the sweet potatoes, clean and poke with a fork all over...then wrap individually in a wet paper towels and microwave them for 8-10 minutes or until tender. And instead of orange marmalade, add a small can of drained crushed pineapple. Also, add about 2 more Tbs of butter to the top!

I normally hate sweet potatoes, but this is so good. "Eggs change everything" is right. This dish is fluffy, which is a great improvement for sweet potatoes. My friend made this for thanksgiving and I am going to make it asap.

This was delicious. I followed previous commenters' advice and ditched the orange marmalade. I'm glad I did. I would definitely cook this again, just not for a holiday. It must be served immediately and so it was way too much of a hassle to deal with. The last thing I need is another dish that has to be done at the last minute!

Normally I don't like sweet potatoes but once I tasted this recipe I was sold. Everyone loved it! Even my friends that don't usually enjoy my gourmet cooking. I made it just as it was written and it will be permanently on our thanksgiving menu.

Really disappinted in this! The orange flavor was bitter and overpowering. Loved the gingersnap topping, though. I will go back to my old sweet potato recipe adding gingersnaps to the rest of the topping ingredients.

I made as directed and I couldnt have been happier. It was truly yummy and relatively easy. I made everything ahead except for the egg whites and did those last minute and it was great.Worth a try for sure.

Do you really have to serve this immediately. Any way to make ahead then bake. Last minute recipes don't usually work for me for the holidays when I usually have a large crowd.

I was actually looking for an update to the sweet potato/marshmallow days of old and came across this recipe. I made it almost as is... added a dash of vanilla and a tad more brown sugar (I was still missing some of the sweetness from days of yore). This came out wonderful and light and I definitely recommend trying out this recipe!

I made this for the family Thanksgiving. It was a hit. In fact I have to forward this recipe on to my aunts so that they can use for Christmas.

I always offer two types of sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving, USUALLY candied sweet potatoes (Gourmet Nov 1999) and bourbon sweet potato puree with buttered pecans (Gourmet Nov 1997. Both recipes have been family favorites. But it's nice to change things up. So I replaced my former puree recipe for this one. Raves all around, especially from the most discriminating of palates, my seven- year old daughter. It has a lovely fluffy texture. To me, the orange flavor is a bit overpowering and is very sweet...one of my guests even commented it was like eating pie with dinner. Yes, I would make again but I would rather make my former puree recipe and add this wonderfully crunchy gingersnap/pecvan topping to it.

I live overseas and could only muster 1/3 cup of borrowed gingersnaps so used some belgian almond thin crisp cookies to get to the 3/4 cup. Everything thing else was made per the recipe. It turned out very well and our British guests enjoyed it even though it was a scary combination of ingredients for them. However, be warned, it is very sweet. The texture was great and a treat from the heaviness of maple/butter usual mashed version.

The orange was a little overpowering and cloyingly sweet with the topping. I omitted the marmalade after tasting it with just the O.J., which gave the dish a enough orange flavor. Canned sweet potatoes worked well in a pinch and I added all of the egg whites to give it a lighter consistency. Great flavor.
