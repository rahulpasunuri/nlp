This was good, but not until I significantly increased the amount of lime juice.

This recipe gave me the idea for a smoothie: 1/2 cup Trader Joe's coconut milk beverage, 1/2 honeydew, 1/4 lime cut in small pieces, handful of ice cubes, tablespoon of coconut all thrown in blender. Easy, tasty, nice change for breakfast and low in calories.

Simple and delicious! My boyfriend found this recipe as a way to use up the remaining coconut milk from Grilled Mahi Mahi with Thai Coconut Sauce (Bon Appetit July 2010), and they actually complimented each other quite well. We'll definitely make this meal again.

The first time I made this with "lite" coconut milk and extra lime juice. I do not recommend either of these modifications. Today I made it as written and it was delicious.

Simple, delicious and elegant! I used cantaloupe layered with fresh blueberries. Chilled the coconut milk in the fridge for four hours. It got thick when cold, the consistency of whipping cream. Topped it with toasted flaked coconut.

Simple, and an exceptionally good combination. I used slivers of makgroot lime leaves instead of the lime zest with this. Beautiful, fresh Summer dessert. Yum!

This was exquisite! I added a little more lime and sugar, but pretty much followed the recipe. Didn't have a melon baller, so I just chopped it into chunks. Refreshing and light, great for a summer night.

This is the perfect summertime dessert and pretty much foolproof! I made it with lemon juice because my limes had gone bad, and with Splenda because that's what was closest to that end of the kitchen. Instead of the ice water bowl thing, I just stuck the coconut milk mixture in the freezer while I was eating dinner. The citrus made the coconut milk taste almost effervescent, and together they really complemented the honeydew. Great stuff!

So so good! Served it after grilled steaks and corn on the cob, and roasted potatoes. Light and refreshing after a heavy meal. Just adjust the lime juice and sugar to your taste.

This is a fun, simple, refreshing recipe that combines unusual flavors very well. I reduced the amount of sugar somewhat and increased the lime to suit my tastes. Not a big melon connoseur, I accidentally brought home a cantelope but my guests agreed the recipe worked well and is a keeper!

Was looking for a simple dessert to finish off a curry dinner for some vegetarian friends..this was perfect. I have since made it again as an alternative to my usual baked summer desserts...since it is BAKING here in southern Colorado and who needs added oven heat?

It was absolutely amazing. Almost everyone wanted the recipe.

I've made this twice so far -- though I have to admit that, like another reviewer, I skipped the ice thing and ended up sticking it in the freezer. (Stirring every few minutes so it wouldn't get hard on the sides, less of a hassle -- but cold is vital, since the milk smells weird if it's not super chilled.) I love the coconut-lime combo, which perfectly complements the honeydew. Also, since I've just been on a coconut kick anyway, I garnished with a macaroon (store-bought but fresh and fluffy) and a sprig of mint. I almost doubt that any addition (within reason) would hurt this dessert, it's so cool and lovely and understated. And EASY -- with not a lot of time on my hands, I dig that :)

Very good summery dessert. I made it in advance so skipped all the metal bowl/ice business as it was chilling in the refrigerator for several hours before serving. Did keep the melon ball and coconut milk separate until ready to serve.

Wonderfully simple with a clean, light and refreshing taste. Perfect dessert after a summer grilled meal.

A simple to make and most refreshing recipe. I will make this over and over on these hot days of summer.
