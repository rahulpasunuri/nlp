I love this soup...it's very simple, but delivers a great flavor. The recipe as written is a terrific base for variations. I've made this soup many times, and always toss in whatever veggies I have leftover in the fridge. Haven't been disappointed yet. However, like everyone else it seems, I find garlic a necessity. Don't skimp on that or the cheese!

I have made this soup for several years on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. As my family gathers together from across the country the soup is a warm welcome when they get home. I frequently add extra bits of vegetables but the soup is very tasty as written. The question when the boys and their families arrive is, "Mom, is the soup ready?". It always is.

I have lost count of how many times I have made this recipe. My whole family (little kiddos included) love this soup and usually serve it with a crusty baguette.

This is a delicious and healthy soup that is one of my favorites. Vegetable broth is a great alternative to the chicken broth for those who are vegetarians. Give it a try - it will make you feel good!

Good and hardy soup. Substituted vegetable broth for chicken. A definite keeper.

I thought this was a super easy and delicious soup! I, like many others, added garlic and 2 cans of northern beans (I also substituted spinach for the cabbage and veggie broth for chicken broth).

This soup is a definite winner. I followed the suggestions of others and used oregano instead of rosemary and I added a can of chickpeas. I think next time I will add some cannellini beans and some fideo noodles to make a hearty meal.

I received rave reviews from family including a "best vegetable soup I've ever tasted" when I made this for lunch on a chilly day. The modifications I made were to saute 2 minced garlic cloves along with the vegies, use 1/2 tsp dry thyme and 1/2 tsp dry oregano instead of the rosemary, using an immersion blender to puree most of the soup after simmering for 45 min, and then adding a can of drained cannellini beans after pureeing. Delicious!

Like many others, I followed the recipe procedures and suggested amounts exactly, but I did add fresh garlic to the softened onion mix and also added one potato and one zucchini (chopped small) toward the end of the simmering to bulk it up. The soup was good but a bit too sweet for us-- I agree with many others that it would be easy to tweak the ingredients to achieve one's preferences. I would recommend this recipe to others because it's very easy and on a whole is a good, quick dinner (I served it with hearty bread, butter, and a piece of broiled salmon) and great lunch leftovers.

My mom forwarded this recipe to me about a week and a half ago. I've already made it twice! The first time I made it with beef broth and added lean ground beef. Very good. The second time, I added garlic and used vegetable broth. Yummy!

I liked this recipe, but made a few modifications... 1) I cut the rosemary in half (I think the herb can be overpowering). 2) I added 2 tsp. minced garlic (I was surprised not to see garlic on the list of ingredients. I left it out to see how the soup would taste once finished, but thought it definitely needed it. So, I heated/softened it up in a little olive oil and stirred that into the soup at the end. 3) I added 1/3 cup white wine at the end, which gave it a very subtle gourmet tang. 4) Since I was making the soup as a main course, I wanted it to be a little hardier, so I added small shell pasta before serving. I would definitely make this soup again.

I made it with garlic and it was really tasty and healthy! I would certainly make it again!

Delicious & healthy. I added garlic, and used spinach instead of cabbage. (I was having Cabbage Soup Diet flashbacks). Will make again.

I agree with other reviewers who said this is a good recipe to start with and make your own changes. I only substituted spinach for the cabbage this time, but in the future I may make other changes as well. I also made a side of wild rice mix and added it when the soup was done simmering. Mmm!

This is a great base to start from. I made a ton of changes, to suit our tastes: used 4 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups chicken broth (it's what I had on hand); Added two thickly diced zucchini when the simmering portion had 20 minutes left; Used spinach (chopped) instead of cabbage; added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the onion/carrot/celery mixture; added a can of garbonzo beans when I added the broth and tomatoes. Even with all of these changes, it was a fabulous soup. You could definitely tailor this recipe and use any vegetable you like. Simple and easy!

I've made this soup several times and really enjoy it. I add zucchini and garlic with the other vegetables. Also add Orzo when simmering soup. Have also used spicy diced tomatoes. It freezes well.

Pretty Tasty - I used spinach instead of cabbage and tossed in a clove of garlic. It's very easy and has a lot of flavour.

This was an OK soup, but the cooking time on the cabbage is way off. I like a bit more bite to my cabbbage when I add it to my Mexican soups, so next time I will add it the last 15 minutes of cooking. I reduced the rosemary and added 2 small potatoes and red chili flakes. I will also reduce the simmering time as well. You don't want a sludgey soup.

I've made this twice. It's extremely easy to put together, tastes great, and is almost fat free. What more can you ask for?

My new favorite soup! I added 1 freshly diced jalapeno and 2 cloves of garlic to liven it up. The fresh rosemary really makes this soup delish, as does the grated cheese sprinkled on right before serving. (Don't skimp on either!) My boyfriend and I can't get enough! We've made this recipe 3 times. Freezes well, too.

I had high expectations for this soup after reading the other reviews, but I felt as though this soup was very bland. It is, however, very nutrious and hardly any fat, so if you're looking for a filler soup without being a main dinner meal, it's not a bad thing to have on hand. Otherwise, there are others definitely worth making.

mmm... easy, cheap, hearty, healthy.... this is what home cooking is all about. yum yum.

Simple, easy, and delicious... what could be better? I threw in a bit of white wine and some oregano as well as a Yukon gold potato or two. I also made some crutons to go with it, much like the "Tomato and Garlic-bread soup" recipe (another winner). My husband loves it, my neighbor loves it, I love it.

We loved this soup and I can't wait to make it again. It was so fast and easy. I also found it easy to make variations on the vegetables and added a few extra. I am a vegetarian so I used Vegetable broth and it was still delicious.

I choose to use a frozen unsalted chicken stock called "Perfect Addition", my husband is on a salt restricted diet. But I did season it up for me and he added a salt-free spicy blend to his. Very easy, will make it again with chicken.

End of Labor Day weekend. We finally had time to get a lot of things done around the house. We needed a light but satisfying dinner, and this was it. We loved it.

Never tasted before a vegetable soup with such a interesting taste! I think both parmesan and plum tomatoes made the difference, very yummie combination! I also added 2 potatoes to soup and some small sausages as for my husband a soup without meat is not a soup! But the end result was really good!

Very good and easy to make. I loved all the cabbage! It tasted even better when we went back for seconds.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I could not believe I did not have to use salt and pepper - the rosemary was enough seasoning. I am looking for more recipes like this.

Very good, easy-to-assemble recipe. I was suprised that the rosemary -- the only herb added -- flavored the soup so well. I'm a vegetarian and substituted vegetable broth (by way of bouillion cubes) and I thought the flavor was great. An easy soup for new cooks.

Just a little too much rosemary for my taste, next time I will take out about a third. Other than that very good!

This was very good and easy. I also added some red pepper flakes.

I doubled the recipe and added 4 chipotle peppers to spice it up. I then ladled the soup over fresh bread in a bowl.
