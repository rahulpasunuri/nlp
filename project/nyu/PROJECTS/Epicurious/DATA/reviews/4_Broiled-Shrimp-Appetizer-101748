this was very good. based on the reviews here, i used only half olive oil, and all the rest of the ingredients in full quantity. also added one large garlic clove, finely chopped. this might also be be good, i think, with some chopped ginger. but despite my modifications, i was more impressed than i expected to be, based on the so-so reviews. (and i only had time to marinate for one hour) i would make this again, without hesitation!

Very classical and delicious recipe.... But forget about cilantro instead of tarragon! Berrrrk. THE only problem with this recipe as is, is that you just can't put the same amount of FRESH or DRIED tarragon... If using dried, one teaspoon is plenty !

The tarragon struck a jarring note - coriander would have been a better match with the say and lemon (ponzu). Also, a cup of olive oil was way too much - yuck! Definitely not the greatest shrimp dish I've ever tasted - mediocre.

My rendition of this recipe is simpler, quicker, juicy, and full of flavor. Start with 30 xlg. shell-on, head-on prawns. Season with salt, and freshly ground pepper to taste. Add apprx. 1/3c. each of EVOO, and ponzu sauce (lemon and soy), 1T. minced garlic, and 1t. dried tarragon. Marinate for minimum of 15 mins. Meanwhile pre-heat stainless steel saute pan in 450 oven for 10 mins. Drain remaining marinade from prawns and spray quick-release on pan before adding prawns. Return to oven for 5 minutes, tossing to turn after 1st 2.5 mins. Remove from oven, and let rest with cover on pan. Searing on high heat seals in the wonderful juices, and carmelizes the marinade. Served with roasted cauliflower, and broccoli cooked in the same oven but started 10 mins. earlier. Simple, delicious, fuss-free meal ready to serve in 30 minutes time.

LOVE this recipe! I, too, changed the tarragon to cilantro. Each time I've made this appetizer, I've increased the amount of shrimp, and each time they have been devoured.

Was received with great reviews from our guests - the best part....marinating for two hours and just throwing them on the bar-b as guests arrived. Finger bowls with lemon slices were a must!

I made this dish tonight as an appetizer b/f Thanksgiving dinner. I did not have time to marinate for the suggested length of time, but the shrimp still came out absolutely delicious. One of the guests said that it was the best shrimp appetizer she had ever eaten. I did make some substitutions: used cilantro instead of parsley, omitted the tarragon and used minced garlic, and also added some fine chili pepper powder to the marinade for an extra kick. And voila, this could not have been more perfect! This is a keeper.

Great recipe - except (don't all great cooks tamper with recipes?) I completely substituted the tarragon with garlic. Made them by marinating with shells on AND off...both ways great.. broiled in toaster oven when no grill available. ALWAYS great. Cook extra marinade and use as dipping sauce. EVERYONE wants the recipe. Keeper.

My husband and I didn't think this was a great recipe. I think our problem is we really are not big fans of tarragon. We wouldn't make it again unless we exchange the tarragon for another herb.

This is my favorite kind of recipe: easy and delicious. I made this dish for several people, one of whom doesn't even like shrimp, and they all agreed it was excellent. The only quarrel I have with the directions is a minor one: I recommend a longer marinade time than the suggested two hours. I would go with a minimum of four hours.

Super simple to make and tastes great. The fresh tarragon really added to the flavor. I had to resort to frozen shrimp but it worked well. All my guests loved it.

One of my guests, who has an appreciation for good food, said this was simply the best shrimp that he'd ever had. I did shell and devein the shrimp prior to broiling them inside. I would suggest doing that so it's less messy for your guests unless you're doing an outside casual party. If you're cooking inside, use a grill pan and do it on top of the stove so you can monitor their progress; I thought mine were slightly overdone. Also, consider this as a main course, or part of a main course (perhaps, like another reviewer, add sea scallops), rather than an appetizer. My main entree (Julia Childs' braised pork loin roast) paled in comparison, as my guests' expectations had been raised too high by the shrimp!

Excellant. My son said it was the best he ever tasted, my wife raved about it. We made it several times over the holidays. Since we live in Minnesota. I broiled them (about 4 minutes on one side, turned over for 3 more). We substituted limes for lemons and cut back a little on the soy sauce, still came out great. The frozen shrimp I purchased was already deveined, very easy to make.

Delicious! Fresh tarragon is a must - perfect accent to shrimp!

How would you prepare this if you do not have a BBQ handy?

This was a big hit at a recent party. I didn't properly appreciate how messy it was, though - next time, I'll furnish packaged towlettes in addition to paper napkins.

This recipe was the best shrimp recipe I have ever had. I added garlic as some others had suggested. Everybody loved it. I highly recommend this.

Made this for a party and it was a huge hit! Had to give the recipe away to a number of people the next day. If you do broil the shrimp on wood skewers, make sure to soak the skewers for at least 20 minutes. I hadn't and mine started to burn and smoke.

The shrip were so great. I used bamboo skwers and cooked the shrimp under the broiler. I added garlic to the recipie and made it even better. If you use the bamboo use 2 of them so you can easily fllip them.

Outstanding! I used tiger prawns, which I peeled, and scallops. Marinated in separate dishes for six hours, then grilled. Consumed immediately by all guests, who wanted more. Dee-lish!

Fabulous recipe. I added garlic and, since I ran short of soy sauce, worcestershire sauce. I marinated both shrimp and mushrooms in the marinade, and grilled both on skewers. It worked nicely with both, and we will use this recipe often.

Excellent grilled shrimp! Peeled shrimp and marinated for 5 hours. Added a little salt to marinade. Cooked on grill using a grill wok for 6 minutes stirring several times. Seems too messy as a peel and eat shrimp...but great and elegant done this way.

Wow! What a great, simple recipe! Who would've believed that something from 1956 could be so wonderful? A friend brought the shrimp in marinade over, and we cooked them on our gas grill, in an old pasta pot insert (with holes - you know what I mean.) What an incredible, smoky, wonderful flavor. Pay attention to the timing and don't overdo. We made these again last night and went 8 minutes - a mistake! 6 minutes is perfect if you shake the basket or stir them up at 2 minutes and again at 4 minutes. So simple, but so gooooooooood!

This is one of the best shrimp recipes that I have ever tried. The flavor is wonderful. I peeled the shrimp leaving the tails on before marinating and then marinated them for about 4 hours for a stronger flavor. I then grilled them on the barbecue for just about 6 to 8 minutes turning the basket frequently. I served them to company which enjoyed them as much as my husband and myself. This recipe is a definate keeper

This recipe is so simple and easy, and it just tastes like a party. The only possible way to improve on it is to grill the shrimp. We throw them into a grill basket for a few minutes per side, to give a wonderful smoky flavour. Don't pass this one up!

This is one of my favorites. I substitue rosemary and thyme.
