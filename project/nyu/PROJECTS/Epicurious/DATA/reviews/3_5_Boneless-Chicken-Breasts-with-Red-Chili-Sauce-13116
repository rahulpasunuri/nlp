My sisters are excellent cooks - so it is hard to impress them - I made this chicken with the Mexican rice/cilantro sauce and... I didn't expect people to come for seconds and some for thirds... It was AMAZING!!!!

This is an excellent dish--both I and my husband, who loves southwestern food, loved it. I didn't have raisins so used dried cherries. Also used bone-in chicken and baked it a bit longer. It turned out very flavorful and moist. Marinated for 6 hours--I would say the longer the better, as the flavor is great. It would be fun to try with ancho chiles.

Loved this recipe exactly as suggested. I was even able to find the new mexico peppers. Doubled the recipe for a crowd. Served it with the spanish rice from this site along with black beans and cilantro. You really can make everything ahead of time and just saute and bake the chicken at the last minute and rewarm everything else.

I have made this a number of times, but since I spent many years in NM, I am used to the heat ;-) and so I make it a little differently. I double the chile, though I use half mild and half hot. You have to get to a real Mexican grocery to get New Mexico red chile, if you're at all lucky. I use only half a teaspoon of salt, it's plenty. Just pouring hot water over the chiles is not how you make sauce. Clean and prepare the chile by removing the stems and the seeds (you can leave in a few seeds if you like more heat), cover with water, add the other ingredients, and boil until the chiles are soft, about 10- 15 minutes. Not a crazy boil, but cook them. THEN, you have to transfer the chiles to a blender (not a food processor, it'll fly out of the bowl and redecorate your walls) and add some cooking water and run the blender on liquefy for several minutes. Do not skip this step. This is how you get a velvety smooth sauce,not one full of dried chile skin particles. Add more cooking water until you get a consistency that is slightly more watery than you would make for enchiladas. Then you can follow the rest of the recipe. I serve this in a shallow bowl on top of roasted red potatoes, pouring on any extra sauce, and top it with the muenster cheese. It's exceptionally good with this, don't scrimp, but if you can't find it, use jack cheese. Alongside I serve fresh, lightly toasted on a griddle, flour tortillas, and a good creamy cole slaw. If it's too hot for you, add a little sour cream. If you don't like the idea of roasted potatoes (I'll admit that's my gourmet side, not my New Mexican side), you can always serve it on top of fresh cooked pinto beans. My husband loves this and needs a couple of extra napkins to wipe his head while he eats it. But any leftover sauce is terrific over fried eggs the next morning.

I always hate it when there's one kook who goes against the 99.9% of reviewers who love the recipe. But doesn't anybody out there think there's just too much SALT?? I added the 1 1/2 teaspoons to the sauce even though I'm old enough to know better. Big mistake. I would try the dish again because the flavor is intriguing but with less salt and more Muenster cheese on top. One tablespoon?? Come on!!

Really good and easy. I only had pasilla chiles so I used those. I marinated the chicken for just 10 minutes (it was a busy weeknight--what can I say). I served it with basmati rice. My picky 11- year-old loved it, even though it was pretty spicy. Definitely add extra raisins and a bit of sugar if you use pasilla chiles!

I made this one for the family tonight, and there are NO leftovers. I tested the sauce on my youngest diner while it was still in the blender and, since it stunned him, I added a handful more raisins and about a teaspoon of sugar. The resulting sauce had nice body, good cumin presence, and a very tasty chile finish. I was worried about the cooking time since our chicken breasts were thick, and I am very glad I left them in the oven for twenty-one minutes. I had to substitute dried red chiles - as so many others have done before - without any apparent down side. We served it over Basmati rice. Very, very nice.

I have made this recipe several times, exactly as written, always very successfully. This time we had leftovers of chicken and sauce, and I made chicken "enchiladas", rolling diced chicken, fresh cilantro, and a bit of cheese in whole wheat tortillas. Then covered them with the leftover sauce; sprinkled shredded cheddar and Monterrey Jack; and baked for 20 minutes at 325. Excellent!

I couldn't find the red chiles and used canned chipotle chiles, and it was way too hot! I maybe used a third of the sauce and had to mix with a lot of yogurt. Despite the chile issue, the recipe was delicious and the family really liked it, though it was on the spicy side.

Used a blend of dried red and Ancho chiles, also only a tsp of salt, which seemed plenty salty. I was skeptical that 15 min in the oven would do it, but it worked out fine. Very tasty.

This recipe is excellent. I used dried cherries and figs in place of raisins and just plain dried red chilis. I also didn't have yogurt on-hand so I used buttermilk. I added a lot of buttermilk to the sauce to make it more creamy. Yummy.

Ironically, like the other "cook from Pittsburgh," I also overdid it on the pepper and compensated, in part, by doubling the raisins. I halved the recipe, so the following should be doubled, if you make the whole recipe: To "water to cover" the called-for-amount of onions & garlic, I added 1/2 Tbsp of ground Chipotle pepper -- much too hot! Compensated, like my fellow-Pittsburgher, by adding double the amount of raisins, while the onion mixture was still cooking, thinking they'd blend better if they were softened anyway. The onion mixture was still too spicey, so, in place of the cooking liquid, I substituted the same amount of heavy cream & added approx 1 tsp tomato paste (the flavor of tomato is stronger if the paste is added when blending, rather than when onions are cooking). The sauce is good, even if you stop there, but to make it more interesting, I added about 1/8 tsp allspice & 1/4 cup buttermilk. The tomato paste, allspice & buttermilk give the sauce a nice little "tang," which goes well with the (EXTRA BIG!) "bang" of Chipotle, plus the sweetness of the raisins! I was very happy with the outcome. Since I love the taste of Chipotle pepper, but a 1/2 Tbsp was way too much, the next time I prepare this dish, I'll add the Chipotle gradually to taste, AFTER I blend the onions & remaining ingredients. That way, I'll be better able to determine just the right amount. I think the sauce would also be great over pasta. It complimented wild rice well.

The marinade made the chicken! The chicken (used boneless skinless breast, will try thighs next time for more flavor) was moist and really tasty. I used dried Chipolte chile powder that we get from our local farmers market and added it to the water and onion/garlic mixture. I took the advice of another writer and added 1 tsp of tomato paste. Though I was unimpressed with the color while blending, everything turned out really well. The sauce was delicious and had a nice bite to it. Served this with the spanish rice with zucchini recipe from this site, flour tortillas and a sweet melon. My husband agreed that this was exceptionally flavorful.

this was an awesome, easy dish to prepare. marinated the chicken for approx. one hour and it turned out perfect. used some small dried red chile peppers (don't think they were mexican), seeds and all. it was pretty hot, so i doubled the raisins to compensate. forgot to add cheese at the end and it was STILL great. any leftover sauce would be great with eggs or over vegetables.

This recipe was a huge success with the family. The white chicken breasts were so moist and tender and the combination of cheese and pepper sauce wonderful. I prepared the food exactly as is and made no changes.

We really like this. I served it with Refried Black Beans, and Mexican Red Rice. My only regrets is that I didn't have any tortillas to go along with. I couldn't get Munster Cheese--whatever that is--so just used a little Mexican blend Cheddar and Jack...

excellent -- I've served this to guests on several occasions and always received raves. The key is marinating the chicken for several hours.

When you rehydrate the chilies, you place them in a bowl with hot water to cover (this makes them soft and pliable). After the chilies are soft, the water used becomes the "cooking liquid"

Maybe this is a stupid question, but what's "cooking liquid"?

this recipe was awesome. i loved the sauce and the chicken was so moist. i cut up the chicken into bite size pieces before marinating them so that it would be easier to eat. the sauce was so delicious. i did add a tomatoe to the blender just to give it some color and compliment the flavor. it came out really good.

After a few alterations, I REALLY enjoyed this sauce. I originally made it as is and wasn't terribly impressed. Therefore, I added a few ingredients to make it more of a traditional mole sauce. the marinade was incredible, and good just the way they instruct. To the sauce I added 1 tsp of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 Tbl. peanut butter, pinch of cloves, 1 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon (adapted from an epicurious mole sauce recipe). I prepared the rest of the recipe as instucted above and was duly impressed! i served w/ spanish rice and cumin black beans(epicurious recipe) and my husband raved!

This was a very good, red mole-type dish. I altered the method slightly so as not to heat up the house with the oven, by braising the chicken in the sauce on the stovetop (adding a little juice and broth when it started to get low on liquid) until cooked. I also removed the chiles before blending, since I wanted the sauce flavorful rather than hot, and added some chile powder instead. I topped with some crumbled feta. Very savory and good.

Excellent. I followed the recipe but added a few hot pepper drops to the sauce. Can't wait to make again.

I used dried ancho chiles since the supermarket didn't have the red chiles. I also added some dried thai chili peppers (yes I'm adventurous). I threw in a tablespoon of tomato paste to give it more of a red color! The marinade for the chicken was good also. I used the leftover chili sauce on grilled vegetables the next night and it was still very tasty. A nice dish !!

Loved this recipe although the cumin made the sauce a little undesirable. Now I only add half of the cumin that it calls for. My fiancee and I make this at least once a week.

Awesome dish! My husband and I loved it. I couldn't find New Mexico chilies so I used a couple of anaheims and a red jalapeno. It had a very distinct flavor and was easy to make. I'll definitely make it again,

I made this for my family tonight and it was a big hit. The only change I made was to brown the chicken in an oven ready pan and then add the chili sauce in the same pan to save some clean up. I'll definitely make this for my next dinner party. And the sauce would be good for any enchilada dish.

Wonderful dish! And relatively fat free. Followed the directions until assembly. After I sauteed the breasts on medium heat, I placed them in a small flat earthenware dish, spooning the red chili sauce on top. Covered the dish with saran wrap and placed the dish in the microwave for two and one-half minutes at high. Sprinkled cheese on top. Served with flour burritos, white rice and black beans laced with sherry. Wonderful!
