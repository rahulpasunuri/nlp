Didn't have a bad taste but were very boring. They tasted like cooked carrots just sweetened a little bit. Nothing special at all.

These were pretty good. Used a combination of apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, and sherry in lieu of sherry vinegar (one can only have so many vinegars). Also added garlic with carrots at the beginning. Otherwise cooked as directed (with eyeballed measurements), using water just to cover the carrots. Had no problems reducing the syrup. My husband really liked these, but then he's easy to please.

Overall very nice. I was low on molasses so I used some maple syrup also which seemed to work fine. I did notice, as others mentioned that the sauce didn't thicken enough (could be tied to my swapping for maple syrup), and of course if you just keep going the carrots would turn to mush so when they were the right softness I removed them and brought the sauce to a high boil and added the carrots back once the sauce was reduced. Very tasty.

made for a christmas eve family feast and it was a great side dish because of it's simplicity and speed. i agree, the reducing time was not nearly long enough and in fact, it never reduced much at all, so we had a lot of sauce on the bottom of the dish. everyone loved it though, even my mom who hates cooked carrots. it took 35 minutes to cook the carrots and i didn't let them get soggy. also used 2 1/2 cups of water rather than 4.

Maybe it was something I did or didn't do, but the glaze never thickened. While everyone ate them, they did not stand out as anything special.

Visually, this might work with small carrots with the orange and green coloring...but from a taste perspective, vinegar and carrots are just a bad idea. I made this with the ingredients as listed, but it took FOREVER for the liquid to boil away. I had to pour off most of the liquid and then add back in butter and the remaining ingredients. Despite this small deviation, the flavors just did not work. Unfortunately, I believed the rave reviews here and went with it for our Christmas dinner without having first made it for myself. What a disappointment. No one liked it. I felt terrible making my dinner guests "guinea pigs" for this recipe. The kids (who adore carrots) hated it. My other half said they tasted "funky". I agree. I have to think that the non-carrot-eating people who liked this simply liked the fact that the vinegar so completely overwhelms the taste of the carrots that therein lay the appeal. If I could give it zero forks I would. Never again.

AMAZING! I made these last Thanksgiving and forgot which ones I had made this year...they all asked for them! SO here they come for Christmas dinner! Super tasty!

These carrots are very good and are so upscale presentable. I did find the small ones so it looked just like the photo in the magazine. I will make this recipe many more times and share the recipe with friends.

My family LOVED this dish! It has a wonderful sweet & sour combination of flavors. Even my non carrot eating child ate them! Easy to prepare and can be served as either a simple or elegant side.

Made these carrots for Christmas dinner. Had to do some substitutions due to local availability. Used baby-cut carrots instead of whole and couldn't find sherry vinegar, so mixed white wine vinegar and cooking sherry. Definitely did not add 4 cups water - probably only about 2 cups. Worked out well and tasted great. Left off the parsley as there are no parsley fans in my family. Used to make the balsamic-glazed carrots, also from this site, but these are now our new favorite.

I loved this recipe and I dislike cooked carrots (I was intending for the rest of the family to eat them). I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I substitued baslamic vinegar. I prepared these for a weekday meal, but an elegant dish and easy!

these carrots are great, I had friends over for dinner and made them. Everyone raved about how tast'y they were. I used blackstrap molasses so they were dark in color, but oooh so tast'y. TEN FORKS UP IN MY HOUSEHOLD.

Really simple and delicious. Everyone who tried these asked for the recipe. A real keeper!

These were a huge hit at Christmas dinner. The sweet/sour combination is a natural with carrots and the molasses adds an interesting complexity.

By far the best carrot recipe ever. 3 adamant carrot haters had seconds and my 2 yr old neice asked for them again at dinner.

this in my opinion was one of the best recipes for an otherwise simple dish and a not so versatile veggie..the glaze added a unique character to the carrots that really set them off...everyone was looking for more..I actually made the whole feast for x mas dinner as featured in the december issue of bon apetite..one of the best dinner menus yet ...i believe

What a disappointment to have vinegar soaked vegetables. I will never make it again.

Since I couldn't find Sherry Wine vinegar anywhere (only sherry cooking wine) I used Blood Orange vinegar that I had picked out months before at a gourmet store. I found some thin carrots, and ended up scraping them instead of peeling them because I think peeling would have taken off too much of the carrot. I didn't measure the water but I don't think it was more than 4 cups. I do know that it took a lot longer than 20 minutes to boil it down to a syrupy state (I had taken out the carrots), but I still felt that the topping was more like a sauce rather than a glaze. With this saucevying for attention with the other gravies and sauces on the Christmas dinner plate, it got lost in the shuffle and the carrots just ended up tasting normal. The next time I try this recipe, I will boil the water down to a third of the cup and try for a glaze instead of a sauce.

I have to disagree with the previous reviews. Unfortunately, these carrots became the subject of good-natured ribbing at our family Christmas dinner. I suspect I prepared them too far ahead of time, so don't make that mistake. The brown color (from the molasses) and the sharp flavor from the vinegar made them particularly unappetizing.

Excellent recipe. Served it with a crown roast of pork for Christmas dinner. I used 2 pounds of carrots and 1 pound of parsnips and it gave a nice contrast of flavors and colors in the presentation.

My neighbor made this recipe and brought them over for Christmas. I agree with the other reviewers that they were the best carrots I've ever put in my mouth! They are almost good enough for dessert!

I served these carrots (used whole carrots cut up) with Christmas Dinner and received RAVES from my guests. A couple mentioned "the best carrots I've ever had". I have to say that I agree with them. Just one note - perhaps it was my pan (used a Le Crueset Dutch Oven), but it took longer than 20 minutes to boil the water/sherry/molasses mixture to a syrup. It was at least 30 minutes, but that was OK since I was doing that portion in advance.

This is a great recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, using the whole carrots. I made it for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again. heintv

this is a great twist on the boring carrot. I loved the flavor and easy to make. I used your usual carrot, cut crosswise into 3-4 inch lengths, then lengthwise into thinner pieces. Really nice dish.

My favorite kind of recipe- So easy to make and yet full of rich flavors. I'm definitely going to serve this as a side for Thanksgiving.
