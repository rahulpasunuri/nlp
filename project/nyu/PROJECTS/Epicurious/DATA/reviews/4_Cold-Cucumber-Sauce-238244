Very easy to make. I made the basic sauce, using Parsley and chives for the herbs. I couldn't picture how it would go with grilled swordfish before making it, but I figured if Jasper White says you have to try it, then you have to try it. It was excellent, perfectly complemented the swordfish. All enjoyed it, some were even eating it on its own, as a side dish. Highly recommend it.
