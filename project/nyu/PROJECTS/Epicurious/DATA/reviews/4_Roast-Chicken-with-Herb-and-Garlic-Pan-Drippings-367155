Amazing! Made it for New Year's Day, everyone raved over it. I was concerned about using so much salt -- but brining for 5 hours did not make the chicken salty (I did not add salt before frying). It was moist and tender and very flavorful. Definitely a keeper.

I brined the chicken for 7 hours and it was way too salty! After a few bites, the salt flavour overwhelmed my palate. I would make it again with the garlic, and herbs but skip the brine. The presentation is lovely but overall a let down.

Absolutely delicious!! My first time quartering a chicken was a success. We used an Italian herb olive oil rather than vegetable oil and used many more heads of garlic and herbs than recommended. 9 hours of brining. Definitely a keeper :)

I made this precisely as written and I would not change a thing! Really, my review is as simple as that. Follow the recipe, and you're in for some aromatic, moist, and delicious chicken. I served it with the "Green Beans with Toasted Walnuts and Dried-Cherry Vinaigrette" also from Bon Appetit (and Epi) and some fluffy mashed potatoes with some of the pan drippings on top. Heaven.

The brine worked wonderfully - my guests all wanted to know how the chicken stayed so moist. I loved the roasted garlic and herb flavors throughout as well.

YUM!!! This chicken was sooo tender, juicy and tasty. The flavor was great with all the herbs.

This was so good! Really moist and flavorful chicken. It definitely takes a little bit of time and you have to read the instructions carefully but well worth it. I only have two hours to brine and it still turned out wonderfully :)

Even though I was afraid of the salt content, I made this recipe almost as indicated. I just skipped the butter, added oregano and omitted the salt after drying it. It turned out very tender and moist. Perfect chicken and the pan juices were delectable!

THE QUESTION IS ... WHAT'S THE SODIUM CONTENT, DO YOU GET KNOCKED OVER WITH SALT? OTHERWISE THE RECIPE SOUNDS GREAT ... LOOK FORWARD TO OTHER OPINIONS

Amazing! i have made this several times now. brining the chicken before hand makes a big difference and worth the step. i tried it both ways and will brine every time now. this recipe makes the house smell incredible, between the garlic and all the herbs...so good.

Made this for dinner during Hurricane Irene. it took a little time because you had to brine and pan fry the chicken, but I couldn't go outside, so I wasn't at all rushed. I only brined it for like 2 hours anyways, and it turned out great. I think the pan frying is the key to this recipe which makes the skin really crispy. the garlic was good too, but I don't think you need to use 4 whole heads unless you have a lot of garlic lovers. I mean most people can't eat a whole head on their own and I think you get the garlic flavor pretty well with less. but that might just be me. I think you could also skip the butter if you wanted to be a bit healthier. that said, I made it just as directed and my boyfriend called it his favorite chicken dish I have ever made - and I have made A LOT.
