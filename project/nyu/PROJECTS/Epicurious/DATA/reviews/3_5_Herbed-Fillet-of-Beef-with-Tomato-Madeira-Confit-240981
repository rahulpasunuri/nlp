I made just the filet of beef and it was wonderful. I cook for two so only used 1/4 of the ingredients in this recipe. I will definitely make this again.

This was so good! I ended up with a 6.5lb tenderloin, so I did make more rub anticipating the I would need more. I made sure to rub the meat down good and ended up not having to use all the rub. I cooked for 45 minutes and let sit for 20 minutes. It was cooked perfectly. There weren't any drippings in the pan and I had forgotten about the confit until right before serving, so I ended up just reheating it and served as is and it came out really good and everyone really liked it.

mmmmm...This was outstanding. I made this for my family and everyone loved it. It was the first time I made anything for my family and now they want me to make dinner more often.

This was excellent. My fiance loved it so much, he asks for it for every special holiday meal! Very good flavor!

Way, way, way too much rosemary and thyme flavor! The only saving part was the confit - but even it could have been better (much) if used fresh tomatoes. Taking reviews into consideration, I used very little salt in the marinade and was glad for it and none in the confit and was also glad. Maybe this would have been better on a marbled cut of meat that had some fat flavor to combat the herbs. A tenderloin was too delicate flavor to pair with this.

Great dish. The confit is absolutely delicious - I could (and did) eat it by the spoonful. I rubbed the tenderloin with Kitchen Bouquet before rubbing it with the spices to give it that nice dark roasted color.

I thought the marinade made the beef way too salty and I didn't think that the sauce went with the beef at all.

This was OK. I usually never mind using salt, but found this too salty, so will cut in half next time. My husband actually said he liked it better without the sauce, so you could just skip that part. To me, the sauce tasted just too much like canned tomatoes, so wasn't worth the effort. I did use cooking sherry because I didn't have Madeira, so maybe that accounted for the not to great resutls. Won't make again.

i made this for a dinner party, and while everyone LOVED it, here is my advice for cooking it. - the confit needed to simmer quite a bit longer than 1 hour for the flavours to truly marry. rather than crushing the tomatoes with a spatula, i threw it all in a blender, then put it on the stove top to reduce. - the cooking time on the roast was way off for me. i had it in the oven for an hour, and upon cutting into it it was still raw. rather than keep my guests waiting, i pan seared individual slices.

I made this for Christmas dinner; the beef was superb. I used dry sherry in the confit and that worked out fine as well. Perfect dish to impress and leftovers just as tender the next day!

This is the best beef I have ever eaten. I used very fresh organic meat, which helped I'm sure. The only thing I would caution is to make sure you spread the marinade out evenly; I didn't and found some areas to be quite salty. The confit was wonderful and smoky. I used the left-overs tossed in pasta. Very easy all the way around, and a big hit for Christmas dinner.

The herb rub/marinade was so simple yet added so much to the beef. We served this with the confit (used marsala didn't have madeira) on side as in the photo. Quited delicious. The wild mushroom bread pudding is also a huge winner. We liked herb marinade so much I did our Christmas rib roast the same way.

The tomato confit is phenomenal. Easy to make ahead, great flavor and really added a lot to the beef. The beef coating was delicious but the beef I had was really thick and took much longer to reach the temperature. But tasty.

Wonderfully easy recipe with great tastes

The beef was good, but since it wasn't seared first, it came out of the oven an unappealing gray! Made the tomato confit the day before and thought it was bland. Ended up making a port balsamic sauce from the website that was awesome.

This was a fabulous recipe. We used the leftovers including the tomato confit, for shepherd's pie and it was also delicious.

Commenting on the confit (I made the recipe with chicken thighs, as my guests don't eat beef): I used a cheap madeira and found the confit to be delicious and quite forgiving after simmering it for a looong time.

We at this at my sister-in-law's last night for Christmas dinner and it was my favorite tenderloin ever. A great deal of flavor was imparted through the marinating. Also, the tomato confit was absolutely delicious. I am adding this to my recipe box because it really was amazing.

I was planning to do another Epicurious recipe for Christmas Eve dinner but my daughter in-law and I spontaneously decided to try something new this year with this recipe from the Dec Gourmet issue. It was well worth the chance as the tenderloin was a big hit! I was initially hesitant if the confit would come out as after the initial 1 hour of simmering as the texture of the confit I thought was a going to be too thin - but it came out wonderfully when I simmered at the second time - it came out wonderfully! I would not only use this confit for this tenderloin but as a bruschetta too.

I made this for Christmas dinner for 8 and it was a major hit! I used a bigger boneless ribeye roast and marinated it in twice the marinade (we all love garlic) and the flavor of the meat alone was incredible...and the confit was amazing! Used sherry and a splash of balsamic since I had no Madeira and got rave reviews- definitely worth repeating!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was spectacular! It did take approx 20 min. longer than expected, but it was well worth the wait! The confit is simply amazing and an excellent compliment to the herbs on the tenderloin. I will absolutely make this again.

We made this for Christmas Eve dinner last night and it was absolutely amazing. It was the highlight of the meal. The strong flavors of the herb marinade and tenderness of the meat, combined with the fabulous flavors of the confit (wow that confit is unreal!)... It is one of the top 3 recipes we have made this year. I have copied it into my "real" recipe book already, and I know we will make it for company and special occassions many times again. p.s.- this is only the 2nd recipe that I have ever rated as 4 four forks, and I do it without reservation!

Marinating the beef for a day paid off. It was so tender and full of flavor - it just disappeared from the table. I didn't have Madeira on hand for the confit, so I went with sherry which still worked very nicely.

A Cook From Bellingham writes "there were no drippings to do a glazing". Tenderloin is too lean to have drippings. If you must have drippings, consider buying a prepared demi glaze from your grocer, otherwise enjoy the tenderloin for all it is.

Ours was to die for. So delicious! I did get the meat from the fancy butcher so it was very high quality. The herb flavors were amazing and the confit was delicious as well. It would make a great pasta sauce (cooked for less time) and if you have vegetarians, you can serve the confit with polenta cakes or tofu (pre-drippings of course). We loved it so much so that we got up and finished off the leftovers for breakfast!

What a dissapointment. There were no drippings to do a glazing. The fillet took much longer to cook than the recipe said (keeping guests waiting). Most guests scraped off the confit. The plain fillet was fork tender and good.

A sublime melding of sweet and savory in the confit lends a wonderful balance to the sharp tangyness of the shallots and herbs. Serve with pasta to absorb the sauce.

The Madeira Confit was exceptional. This is one of those recipes where ordinary ingredients transform into something amazing. The description of "lusciously savory" is right on.
