This was a quick and easy recipe to whip up a dessert using a surfeit of Italian plums. The syrup is exquisite and unusual. I have been using the leftover plums (occasionally mixing in nectarines) as a dessert with a plain yogurt topping.

This is one of my absolute favorite fruit salad recipes. I make it again and again for parties, picnics, etc and always get rave reviews. The syrup is soooooo delicious. I sometimes add equal parts blackberries and blueberries instead of just blueberries for some more variety. Also, one time I brought this dish to a "finger foods" party and turned it into a finger food by placing the fruit chunks on skewers and serving the syrup as a dipping sauce on the side. Everyone loved it.

It's so easy, so tasty and so healthy that I have already made it 3 times since I tried it a few weeks ago. It's perfect as written, but I also loved it with cherries instead of plums.

Syrup has interesting flavor but provided no contrast to the fruit.

Excellent subtle flavor of syrup blends very well with summer fruit. Refreshing!
