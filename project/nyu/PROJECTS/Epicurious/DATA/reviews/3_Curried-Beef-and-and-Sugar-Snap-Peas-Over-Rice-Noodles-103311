tried this as a different take on a version i make often and was disappointed. i agree it was totally bland & the sauce was thick as glue after only a few minutes of simmering. the version i usually make is much better and calls for only using 1/2 to 1 tbsp curry paste per can of milk and adding 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp fish sauce and a 1/3 cup water to the sauce. you can also buy curry paste with the ginger, shallots, garlic and lemongrass already blended in to save time on prep, just cut your veggies/meat and start cookin this is the first negative review i've ever left on this site so if this your first try don't be discouraged, lots of good stuff!

This is a GREAT recipe. We make it often. We sometimes play with the amount of red curry paste to control the spiciness. Also I highly recommend tossing the noodles with the mixture in the end, like others suggested. Made it over rice once - that was also not bad.

This dish was good; I enjoyed the subtle coconut flavor in the background. It was definitely missing punch and I served hot chili sauce on the side. I added onions and bell peppers to the snow peas and omitted the lemongrass because I didnt have it on hand. Next time I will double the shallot/garlic/ginger mixture to add additional flavor. Like other reviewers I too tossed the cooked noodles in with the mixture at the end. Will also try with tofu for our vegetarian night dish.

This was really bland. If I were to make it again, which I probably won't, I would add more sugar and maybe some unsalted peanuts.

This has become a highly popular dish in our household: easy, flavourful and can be readily adjusted to suit different palates. I've varied the vegetables with great success (red bell pepper for colour, snow peas instead of sugar snap peas etc). The veggies and meat can be cut ahead of time, which makes it a snap to assemble when friends arrive for dinner.

This was super good, although I have to admit that I was worried (when I was sautéing the shallots etc. my eyes started to burn from the curry!). I also increased the curry paste by about a third too. It's super-good, although I did add a spoon of pad thai sauce and about 1T of sugar to give it a little zip. And I used light coconut milk, which probably cut down on the flavour a bit. Definitely a dish to try!

Not as good as I would have expected. It was lacking something -- didn't have enough punch.

Delicious dish. One teaspoon of red curry paste turned out to be too mild, so I added another teaspoon at the end before adding the meat and peas back into the sauce. I also used snow peas because the snap peas at the market didn't look so good, but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a very tasty and easy to prepare dish that I would definitely make again.

I made this recipe as is except I had some fresh coconut liquid to add to my coconut milk and I think it gave it a better flavor. Definately spicy enough for us but it was good!

Definately mix the noodles w/ sauce. I made a few changes when I made this. The most important was to use 1 c coconut cream (the solid part of an unshaken can.) If you find that the sauce is too thick add some of the clear liquid. Decreased salt to 1/2 tea and had to add salt at the table. Had masalam curry paste in fridge so used it instead of red. Next time would increase to 2 tea and use red which I think goes better w/ beef.

Seemed pretty bland to me folks. I won't make this again.

Very good. It also works well with fried tofu or finely sliced chicken pieces. I prefer to toss the cooked noodles in with the sauce and meat before serving - the noodles hold the flavor really well that way. If you try the fresh lemongrass, it can be a bit too crunchy. I recommend cutting it up and soaking it in near-boiling coconut milk for 10-15 minutes before adding it. This gives it a more appealing texture.

I made it exactly according to the recipe, except that I did toss the rice noodles with sesame oil. I had been light on the salt, but needed to add it.

Though I made some changes due to what I had in the kitchen, I really enjoyed this dish. I used: powdered lemongrass for the bottled, onions for the shallots, Penzey's sweet curry powder plus 1 tsp Chinese chile garlic paste for the red curry paste, three times as much garlic, a full tablespoon of sugar (brown), mung bean noodles for the rice vermicelli, green beans (par-cooked in the microwave then salted and blistered in the wok) for the peas, twice as much cilantro, an equal amount of chopped scallions, and an equal amount of chopped peanuts as a garnish. Very good--even with the yellow curry powder, it still had a different flavor than most Indian-style yellow curries, and I really liked it on the bed of noodles (I cooked the noodles, cooled, cut into smaller pieces, tossed with sesame oil, and spread out on a platter before heaping the curry mixture over them).
