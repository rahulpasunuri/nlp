I'd give this 3.5 forks..really good. Doubled the spices, and used San Marzano tomatoes. Worth the time...much better than a jar of sauce.

really, just ok. not spicy at all and quite a bit of work.

I thought this tasted great! just the right spiciness. I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of stewed tomatoes. I cooked this down for a long time and then added a little more red wine towards the end for a bit of finishing flavor.

I've been making this recipe since 2001 and it never fails to be less than scrumptious! Easy and economical, it is by far the BEST tomato sauce recipe I have ever cooked!

This makes a simple but delicious sauce! A word to the wise: the crushed tomatoes add a significant amount of salt to the recipe.

I've just made this as a sauce to accompany fried mozzarella. I too didn't have the crushed tomatoes, so I did without and added 1/4 tsp of celery salt and 1/2 tsp of sugar. Good stuff!

This is an outstanding tomato sauce, with or without meat. Thanks to MsCheri's review, did as she suggested. Prepared recipe as written then tossed sauce into my slow cooker for 8 hours on low. Threw in Anne Burrell's delicious meat balls for 45 minutes. turned the cooker to high and had a divine dinner for two.

I've tried (a couple times) to make this on Sunday to last the week but my husband usually has it gone by Wednesday. We like spicy, so I add more chili flake and a little smoked paprika. I've also augmented by adding a layer of zucchini and mushrooms. Delicious!!!

Finally, a tomato sauce without meat that has flavor! I accidentally left out the extra cup of crushed tomatoes and only used two 28 oz cans of tomato and it was perfect. Have already made it twice.

It was pretty standard. Wasn't impressed. It did turn out well in terms of the texture being firm and the noodles being well-cooked... but it needs more tomato sauce/tomatoes, at the very least.

Excellent recipe. I did, as others advised, double all spices except the red pepper. I used San Marzano tomatoes and I substituted fresh plum tomatoes for the cup of crushed tomatoes. My guess is that those few who had trouble with the recipe did not use good Italian San Marzano tomatoes. That makes a huge difference. I did add a bit of cumin. Wonderful, thick & spicey!

I am 11 years old and my mom has made this many times. It is kind of spicy, but that is the best part. I recommend not putting too much red pepper in it or it might get really spicy!!!

I made this since it received a significant amount of positive reviews. This was good but needed help. First I sauteed 2 diced carrots and 2 diced celery with the onion and garlic (more like the beginnings of a bolognese) for extra flavor and extra vegetables. I also added about 2 cups of stock since it would be too chunky with all those veggies. Simmered for 40 minutes with 2 bay leaves (next time I would cut down to one). Pureed it in the food processor and it was good but not great. It was lacking depth. So I threw in a parmesan rind and simmered for 20 more minutes. That made a big difference and gave it what it was missing.

I love this sauce, you can alter it in many ways and it still comes out great. I didn't use canned tomatoes this time and I loved it. Always a keeper

Really nice basic sauce. Made this to put over home made mannecotti and it was lovely. Used 2 cans diced tomatoes and 1 cup of tomato puree because I had it on hand. Added some extra red pepper flakes and used my hand blender at the end of cooking to make a less chunky sauce. Will make it again!

I made this for lasagne. It was wonderful!!! I changed a few things, however. After heating all ingredients as described in the large sauce pan, I dumped everything in my large crockpot and let it simmer on low for 8 hours! WOW! Superb!

This is really lovely! I made it for lasagne, and will definitely use it again, next time. Be sure to cook it at least an hour, and probably longer - that makes all the difference!

This recipe calls for Italian tomatoes and it seemed a little too sweet, so I would use half Italian and half reg. dices tomatoes. But so good!

Rating: 4
Delicious! As one reviewer suggested, I too doubled the spices. I used "Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes" instead of Italian-style and fresh diced tomatoes from the garden in place of the canned crushed tomatoes. This sauce is spicy and would be terrific in lasagna. I will definitely keep this recipe.

Rating: 4
So good and so easy. I used six or seven large fresh tomatoes instead of the canned kind and added a teaspoon of sugar. I also prepared it in a stock pot for the added surface area to cut down on the simmering time. If you want to turn this into a meat sauce, reduce the red pepper and add a pound of cooked spicy Italian sausage, broken up into small bits with a spoon.

Easy to make. I added less of the pepper so that I could use it in more dishes. Everyone loves this sauce.

Like the cook in Nelson, WI, I thought this recipe was pretty terrible too, despite following the instructions exactly. It did, however, give me a decent starting point. I doubled all of the spices, added 3/4 t. of cumin, 1/8 c. + 2 T. of sugar, 1/4 c. of breadcrumbs, 1/4 c. of grated parmesan cheese, and a generous amount of salt and pepper to taste. The cheese and breadcrumbs were necessary to thicken the sauce, which was like water despite simmering for over an hour. In the end, it was the best sauce I ever made (and spicy too - delicious with the Sicilian meatballs on this website). Strange to think it started with a recipe that tasted absolutely awful.

Rating: 4
I used this with the sausage/spinach lasagna. This sauce is excellent, with a few modifications: It is essential to add at least 1 tablespoon of sugar to this sauce. I also added sauteed mushrooms. I agree with the cook from New York - add 2 cups crushed tomatoes instead of one, & use more garlic, onion and spices proportionately.

Excellent Sauce- If you are making it to go with the Sausage/Spinach Lasagna I suggest adding 2 cups crushed tomatoes instead of one, & using more garlic, onion and spices proportionately. You'll love this and you'll definitely need more than the recipe calls for....

This sauce is fantastic tasting and well suited for almost any Italian pasta dish. I did substitute one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce for the canned crushed tomato with puree. My only criticism is that after simmering it the 1 1/4 hours, I wound up with a scant 7 cups. Next time I would decrease the simmer time. ENJOY!!!

This sauce was great! I followed the recipe except that I used diced canned tomatoes, rather than Italian-style, and I used tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes.

This sauce is the key ingredient for the "TURKEY SAUSAGE-SPINACH LASAGNA WITH SPICY TOMATO SAUCE". It made the lasagna be the best I ever tasted! I used a sweet onion and 6 large garlic cloves and substituted the 3 cans of tomatoes for 2 cans of 26.5-ounce Delmonte Traditional Spaghetti sauce and 1 can of 8-ounce plain tomato sauce. Reduce the cooking time to 30 minutes instead of 1:15 h. No need to season sauce to taste with salt or pepper. I omitted the dry red wine, since I didn't have any around.

Used crused black pepper, couldn't find the red, and used a lesser quality drinking wine vs a cooking wine, something recommended by the wine steward at my local wine store. Recipe turned out fabulous. My first attempt at making sauce for a husband whose Italian mother made sauce from scratch all the time. He was very impressed as were others in the family. Doubled the recipe per other reviews and left over sauce kept for a week in the fridge and still tasted great to us.

I used fresh tomatoes from my garden in place of the canned tomatoes. After processing the tomatoes into a puree, I cooked it down for 45 minutes then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I only added a can of tomato paste for richness. It was fantastic. This will be my recipe of choice for sauce, especially with garden tomatoes. Next time I make it, I'll add slices of garden peppers.

Very popular with reviewers, I see, and for good reason. I've been making something very similar for years, and it's great over pasta as-is. But it also lends itself to infinite variations/additions. Browned ground beef or sausage; sauteed mushrooms; finely diced celerey, carrots, and/or bell peppers at the beginning of the cooking process are all pretty obvious additions. Some less obvious additions I've enjoyed: 1) a can or two of white kidney beans, well drained, added near the end of simmering -- with pasta and lots of grated cheese, a good winter vegetarian meal with a glass or two of red wine; 2) a can of solid white tuna (two cans for this much sauce) and some chopped black olives, also added late in the process; 3) plenty of chopped fresh spinach, and several anchovies, both of which will melt away to invisibility but which will leave their flavor. Vary the dried herbs; substitute unsalted butter for the olive oil for a change; top your pasta and red sauce with any grated, chopped, or crumbled cheese of your choice; top with chopped raw green onions. Literally endless options, but remember, the unadulterated version is excellent, too!

Fantastic! Finally a recipe with some Zing! when it says that it's spicy. The only changes we made to it was to add fresh herbs, since we have everything already available. We used it orginally in the spinach-lasagna recipe, but had a little leftover. It's great for pasta, or any other meat dish.

Very good sauce. I did make some changes though based on what I had on hand. I used one can of whole tomatoes in puree and one can of pureed tomatoes. Since the in-law's were eating over I didn't want too much heat, so I used barely 1/2 tsp. of the red pepper. Next time I'll use what the recipe calls for and I think it'll be outstanding. Was very pleased with the consistency of the sauce.

This is absolutely the best pasta sauce I've ever had. Add a little ground beef and/or turkey sausage, and I could (and did) have it straight. My cousin said it tasted really fresh...

My husband never cooks and he made this for me with lasagna as a suprise. It was really great. We are going to make a big batch and freeze it and use it with other dishes. A quicky spaghetti, or just throw it over some ravioli. It is so much more fresh and flavorful than canned sauce. It is worth the work!

I really like this sauce. I made it for the turkey sausage and spinach lasagne recipe it accompanies, and it's a nice component. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used one can of crushed tomatoes in puree along with one can of whole tomatoes. I think next time I would use either canned diced tomatoes or two cans of crushed and pureed. Anyway...give it a try, and don't miss the lasagne recipe, either!

Great sauce! With all the comments of it not making 8 cups (see Lasagna reviews), I only simmered it for 1 hour. I used a large onion and more garlic and accidently used white vs red wine - oops! didn't matter it was still fab!

Wonderful!

Very good. My husband likes this sauce better than his Italian mother's "gravy." A definite keeper, although I agree with a previous reader that one can of the whole tomatoes should be replaced with a can of crushed tomatoes to avoid having too many seeds in the sauce.

Quite good... but not outstanding. Would make a good base for a lasagne or casserole. I added more wine, and 3/4 cup fresh basil. If I make it again, I would replace one can of the whole tomoates for crushed - too many skins and seeds. And cut out the cup of crushed tomatoes. This makes a lot of sauce. Easy because you only have to crush garlic and chop one onion.
