This is a good recipe, thighs go well with it. My husband & I liked it. Do not be fooled however, it is not a chutney! There is no fruit in it! There is no acid (lemon juice or vinegar) in it! I would call it an Aioli more than a chutney. Should go great with grilled chicken too which might not with a real chutney.

This is a tasty, easy recipe. It's healthy too! I did use boneless thighs instead of the breasts though.

I must have done something wrong when making this dish because I didn't think it was at all great. I must say though that the chutney makes an excellent dip for crackers.

This is a fantastic dish. I made it with a lemon-onion cous-cous and the sugared snap peas and tomatoes suggested. Really fresh and delicious and a beautiful presentation.
