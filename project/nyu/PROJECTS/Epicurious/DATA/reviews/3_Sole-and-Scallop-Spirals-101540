I am a chef and have made this dish. I did it a little different and I served it as a main course. Instead of steaming try tieing the rolls with butchers string and bake them. This dish needs to well seasoned or it is very blah.

As the previous cook pointed out, much of the directions are incomplete. But, let's assume that we're supposed to put all the ingredients (except for the fillets) in a food processor, and puree them. This is what I did, and followed the rest of the recipe given. It turned out very well. The pimento added a nice bit of color; I'd add more next time.

who wrote this recipe? perhaps so much of it is missing, which explains why no one has attempted to make it. perhaps you puree, that which is not otherwise mentioned in the recipe.
