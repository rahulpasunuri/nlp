It was absolutly delicious, only I used 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and coriander and without the gingerroot because I didn't have on hand. My family love it and I'll make it this again but with the complete seasoning

Disgusting if you go by the recipe. WAAY to much vinegar. I used everything in the recipe and the seasoning paste as it is. I then, after seeing that the misture was too acidic, added a cup of thick honey and 3 table spoons of unsweetened, un processed chunky peanut butter. Cook for an hour a mix continuously. Serve with lamb.

Well, I guess I'm the lone dissenter in the crowd on this one. I don't know what I did wrong, but the seasoning paste came out a nasty, oily mess (and I did use only the two tablespoons of oil) that completely overpowered the spices. And when the mangoes were added, all you tasted was oil and mangoes - YUCK! Maybe my spices were too old (but I don't think so) or the mangoes, or SOMETHING, but I threw it away after tasting it - seriously disgusting.

I used this recipe in my first ever attempt at making mango chutney, and it was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any coriander or tumeric on hand, so I used curry powder instead. This recipe was very easy to follow, and it didn't take long to prepare. My kids loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

I used rice vinegar. Don't know if it made a big difference. I also used cumin, coriander and anise seeds which I crushed in a motar instead of the ground seeds. I think the flavors are more pungent this way. Next time I will also substitute 1/2 tsp. (maybe less?)cinnamon for the stick. I wondered what using dried cranberries instead of raisins might create. I tripled the recipe and canned half the batch. Excellent recipe. The closest thing to Crosse & Blackwell's mango chutney I've found. Thanks.

By far the very best chutney I ever made. However, I could not use unripe mangoes; I could not get my knife through them so I used the least ripe ones I had. We have a large mango tree in the yard. I omitted the chilies because my husband cannot tolerate "hot" foods. The mango held it shape very well and I also added 1/2 cup chopped onion to the recipe. It was quick and delicious. Definately a keeper for us.

The amount of ginger is high in this recipe and the garlic is an unusual flavour in a chutney (can be omitted). I used more sugar and a combination of white wine and regular distilled vinegar. Used garam masala for spice - turned out well.

Distinct ginger flavour. May not use as much next time. Very nice with grilled meat.
