One of my go-to recipes for a quick dessert. I also omit the cardamom. It's such a versatile recipe, in that you can switch it up and serve over pound cake or add toasted cinnamon pecans, but my favorite is still Breyer's vanilla bean ice cream with these spooned on top!

Very good - used salted butter and substituted cinnamon for the cardamom. It was easy to double and I prepared it a good 9-10 hours ahead. I also used a blend of peaches and nectarines.

This recipe has become a tradition during peach season in our home. I prepared it the first time in 2000 when the receipe was released and have continued to do so every year. My June 2000 issue is heavily marked in black marker "DO NOT THROW AWAY". Have shared the recipe with family and friends who were equally as pleased.

Who needs whipped cream? This is good without it. Now that fresh peach season is about over, has anyone tried frozen peaches?

Nice treat for a warm day. I didnt dare use cardamom but used vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. I also used walnuts instead. the whipped cream and nuts made a nice presentation. My guests thought it a delicious way to end a meal.

This is one of my favorites... i made this with Aunt Rose's Pound Cake(also from epicurious) I put the pound cake first , then vanilla bean ice cream , the spiced peaches, fresh whipped cream and the toasted pecans...this is out of this world!!! easy, pretty and delicious...

Didn't like what the cardamon did to the flavor. Thought it made it a little bitter.

Easy and summery dessert! Toasted pecans with just a hint of salt is a great taste sensation with the sweetness of ice cream and brown sugar.

Delicious!! I didn't use either pecans or whipped cream. The syrup cooked longer the second time I made it (by mistake) and it was even better than the first time. will definitely make again.

Great tasting, very refreshing, easy recipe. Even at last minute it's just a snap. I used chopped, toasted pecans and didn't add whipped cream.
