I substituted an additional cup of wine for the apple juice. The vegetables and sauce were quite tasty. Even after browning and roasting for 3 hours,the meat was tasteless. I think it may be the cut of meat; next time, I'll substitute pork shoulder.

Surprisingly tasty, this wintery dish is a cinch to prepare and provides a great use for an inexpensive cut of meat. It reminds me of pot au feu. I omitted ingredients I did not have on hand--shallots and chives--and used only 1 C. cabbage (Napa). Instead of apple juice I used white wine and water. I put in the cloves but not whole, sprinkling ground cloves as if salting and peppering. I would not omit cloves, as the spice in combination gave a unique taste. The 12 garlic cloves (peeled in mine) and vegetables nearly dissolved in the gravy, and I could not taste garlic but rather a slight sweetness. I baked the well-browned meat at 350 for 1 hr and then 250 for 2 hours. The meat, resembling the texture of chuck roast, fell off the bones and fat separated. I had lots of gravy left even after I reduced it. I strained the remainder and will freeze and use it in dishes calling for veal stock or demi-glace. I served the veal with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and a spinach salad with blue cheese dressing. Because this recipe is easier to prepare than many for stuffed veal breasts, I'll make this one-pot dish again.
