This was really simple and delicious. I used chicken drumsticks, since my family prefers dark meat, and I did not strain the broth at the end, because we like to get every last bit of garlic and onion for more flavor. Definitely add salt and pepper. I also sauteed some spinach, separately, with olive oil, lemon, garlic and basil, and it was a good pairing with this recipe.

I've made this recipe for years; it's a family favorite. I adore rosemary as well as shallots and bell peppers and this recipe is a perfect vehicle for combining them. I do not find the results at all bland but I always make sure to add salt.

Wayyyyy too much rosemary. Especially crumbled dried. Bleh. Maybe a teaspoon was how it should have been read? Couldn't tell if it was bland because it tasted like Christmas tree.

I use a pan of sufficient size that all the vegetables and meat are spread in one layer. Crispy, flavorful, utterly delicious!

I made this for the first time for last minute weekday visitor and found it easy and tasty. I thought the veggies roasted well and the shallots were caramelized! I didn't use potatoes but made a quinoa pilaf with it which was good. Also didn't strain liquid. Will do again.

While easy and straightforward to prepare, this was incredibly bland -- I almost couldn't finish my meal, and am embarrassed to admit that I could only do so with the aid of a little catchup. I was looking for a good staple recipe, but this is not it. Either the chicken or the veggies need some type of spice, both as-is yields too little flavor. This will not be a repeat.

Simple and delicious. I replaced the shallots with 6 green onions and added some extra broth without straining. Really delicious, but I would recommend cutting the potatoes up into smaller pieces then suggested b/c helps to cook better.

Until I lost the recipe and eventually forgot about it this was my go to for an easy weeknight meal for years after it was published. Some of the changes posted sound good but some take away the simplicity. I was glad I found this recipe again recently. I always add a little liquid in the beginning and I usually just go with what I have handy and leftover, so tonight is red peppers, red onions, baby yukons and a little leftover champagne. My seasonings change with my mood but I do season it well. In fifteen minuts it's in the oven, I've cleaned up my knife and cutting board and, best of all, I have a little time to relax and enjoy a glass of wine!

This is simple, certainly not gourmet fare, but a nice week night dinner. I use boneless chicken breasts and don't bother to strain the sauce. This is a pretty healthy meal for us.

Once the weather gets cooler, this recipe makes a weekly appearance at our house. So easy and yummy. I don't bother adding broth at the end, just serve the chicken with the potato, pepper, onion mix on the side. Has a nice rosemary taste.

This is an excellent BASE recipe. We have changed it and improved it considerably. It is bland otherwise. We grill the chicken breast (after marinating them) because they do get too dry if cooked with the veggies, plus the veggies get more roasted without the chicken. We always cook this in a BLACK roasting pan or cast iron skillet to get the veggies to caramelize...that's the best part. Everyone loves it this way.

Recipe was very bland. Vegetables are steamed rather than roasted when covered by chicken breasts. Most recipes have you spread out the vegetables to get some crispness and the garlic flavor. Would not make again.

This recipe is great with a few changes. Use boneless skinless chicken, coat in Italian bread crumbs. After it is place on the vegetables, season with salt and pepper, brush with olive oil, and squeeze lemon on top. Next, replace the potatoes with blanched baby carrots (I like to make mashed potatoes instead). For sauce, make a lemon wine reduction using chicken broth, cooking wine, fresh squeezed lemon juice and butter. Simmer on stove while chicken is roasting. MUCH BETTA!

I found this dish easy to prepare, and certainly wholesome, but bland in the extreme. I wouldn't make it again without fairly extensive modifications and measures taken to prevent the fowl and vegetables from drying out.

Quick, super easy, and delicious. I used red onion instead of shallot, and it was fine. I also did not strain the sauce as suggested. Make sure you have some crusty bread handy to sop up the juices.
