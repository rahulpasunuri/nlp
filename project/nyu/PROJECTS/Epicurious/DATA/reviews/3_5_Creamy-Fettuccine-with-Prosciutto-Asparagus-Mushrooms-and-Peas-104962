Ok, I have to amend my first review of this recipe slightly. The leftovers were substantially better the next day. It was like the flavors in the sauce came together and flourished after chilling overnight. A lot more palatable.

I sauteed several cloves of minced garlic and one sliced shallot per other reviews which still did not seem to help the flavors much. I did use finely diced pancetta instead of the prosciutto in hopes of amping up the flavors along with some extra cream but it still lacked flavor. The consistency of the sauce was lovely but just all around kind of bland. Next time I will definitely add extra mushrooms and some crushed red pepper flakes. Overall, I was disappointed. I will make this again but with quite a few changes

Restaurant quality dinner. Used pancetta instead of prosciutto, 5 cloves of garlic, no peas as hubby doesn't like them, italian parsley instead of chives. Can't wait to eat leftovers tonite!

Fantastic and super easy recipe! I used leftover Easter ham instead of the prosciutto, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. I'll definitely be making this one again and again!

So easy and very tasty...great for a quick weekday dinner. Asparagus needs only a couple minutes. More parmesan is better!

My boyfriend loves this recipe. We added more mushrooms and prosciutto because that's our favorite part, and had extra parmesan on the side for sprinkling. It was so easy to make.

Cream sauce was quite runny. Husband felt that the asparagus and peas seems like after thoughts. Liked the prosciutto and didn't really taste the mushrooms. Used tortelleni which was the main "binder" for the meal.

A lovely dish to use springtime asparagus. I used reduced fat butter and substituted fatfree half and half for the whipping cream. (If using fatfree 1/2 & 1/2, add it last and cook just until heated through. If cooked too long, it will not thicken or reduce, but form stringy clumps.) I've prepared this recipe as written and with reduced and non-fat substitutions and was happy with both results.

I agree with other reviewers. First, added a shallot that didn't help much. Second, was very high calorie without the taste "payoff". Perhaps a more flavorful meat like pancetta would work better.

I followed the recipe exactly--loved the creamy sauce and vegetables but found the flavoring rather bland. Will definitely add garlic next time. I agree there is no need to blanch the asparagus ahead of time--it cooks perfectly when added at the same time as the peas. Also I would add the prosciutto closer to the end, so that it stays tender.

I made this dish for the first time for company and it received very good reviews. I followed the reviewers suggestion and added in some garlic, shallots and cracked red pepper with the mushrooms. I also used a little more heavy cream than the recipe calls for. Despite all that heavy cream it didn't taste too heavy at all. Yum! Will definitely make this one again. Very nice combination of flavors.

Instead of blanching the asparagus, I sauteed it with the mushrooms. Follower previous reviewer's suggestion and added 1/2 tsp. dried chile flakes and 2 cloves of garlic. Also sautted shallots as I didn't have any fresh chives and used 1/2 pound of pennette pasta.Also didn't have cherry tomatoes, so added a can of chopped tomatoes with the cream and reduced the sauce. It was delicious!

Fabulous recipe! We followed it more or less to the letter (except for using more asparagus than called for, omitting the chives, and using slightly less pasta than called for, so the sauce:pasta ratio was higher), and it was wonderful...heavy and creamy and delicious. Adding the tomatoes at the end is a great touch.

I make this dish all the time, adding the tomatoes at the very end off heat really makes it fresh. I add 3/4 a container of Panera Sundried Tomato Spread to add more substance to the sauce - yum! Also, try different pastas, the sauce slides off the fettuccine. Fun, flaoverful and easy to make.

This was absolutely delicious. I roasted the asparagus in oil, as opposed to boiling because I hate boiled vegetables. Prosciutto di Parma seemed to provide the best flavor. However, I would agree with another cook's statements that 1lb of pasta seems to be a bit too much for the amount of sauce this recipe makes

Made a few changes after reading the other reviews. I minced 3 garlic cloves and sauteed those with the prosciutto, along with some red pepper flakes. I didn't have mushrooms and added about 1/2 cup chicken broth and let that simmer for a few minutes. I cooked asparagus and snap peas in the boiling water for 2 minutes and then placed them under cold water to halt cooking. While boiling the pasta, I used some water/flour mixture to thicken the sauce just a little bit and then added the veggies to it, along with tomatoes. Drained pasta and placed it in a huge pasta bowl, poured sauce over and tossed with the cheese. I don't think it would have been as creamy without the chicken broth and thickening agent...definitely not enough sauce for all that pasta. My guests raved!

My husband raved about this dish. I however found it a little bland. I even took advice of others and added 2 huge garlic cloves, more cream and butter and proscuitto. I also wish I'd cooked the asparagus less. It was rather mushy even though I only did the 3 min. called for. Not dying to make it again. For all the fat and calories I want to be absolutley blown away by the flavor. Might have to be just a fond memory for hubby!

For the ease of the recipe, this dish is fabulous!I have made it many times with various veggies I have on hand (green beans, asparagus, cauliflower) and it is simple and delicious. I also add a bit more cream than called for and omit mushrooms since I do not like them (cooks prerogative!)...always with good results. Fresh chives and parmesan are key.

It was soooo good!!!!

I have made this recipe several times and it just keeps getting better! I have two additional tweaks, however: I add about 2/3 of a container of Panera's sundried tomato bagel spread to the sauce (it adds some zip!). I also grill chicken breasts and cut up and toss in at the end!

This a a wonderful dish and fairly easy once you've done all the prep work. I read the reviews and sauteed the mushrooms with 2 cloves of garlic. Also, I thought there wasn't enough cream for the amount of pasta, so I doubled it. Both my husband loved it and my 3-year old loved it. This one is a keeper.

Tasty and not as heavy as you may think. Substituted chopped red bell pepper for the cherry tomatoes, as mentioned in a previous review, and was pleased with the results. Not nearly as good reheated, however.

This is the type of recipe I love...embellishments only make it better...shallots, garlic, lots of hot pepper flakes and parmesan cheese....m-m-m-m good.

Delicous! Yum-yum. Would definatly make this dish again but for friends next time! I made half the recipe, but added 3/4 c cream, and 3 oz. procsciutto, also added garlic in with the mushrooms. The veggies were perfect, the asparagus fit right in.

Rating: 3
I liked this dish in that the flavours were very simple. I usually use lots of garlic and herbs in my cooking and this dish was a pleasant surprise. However, I did not cook the asparagus as detailed as this would be too intense. I cooked it standing up in about 1 inch of boiling water for approx 2 minutes(so you are more or less steaming the delicate heads) and I added them at the end with the tomato. I also added parmesan cheese. I probably wouldn't use peas next time.

I thought this receipe was very tasty. I also added more proscuitto, and of course - garlic.

My boyfriend and I both thought this dish was excellent. I too would decrease the amount of peas and asparague. I added some red bell peppers instead of the tomatos and it turned out lovely.

I think this dish was very bland. Maybe some garlic or shallots could have helped. However, I won't be making this dish again to find out. It has far too many calories and fat without enough flavor to make it worthwhile.

Absolutely fabulous! I added about 7 ounces of proscuitto. By the way, it's even better the next day once all of the flavors have settled in! This recipe will become a regular in our home!

Such a rich and flavorful pasta dish! Make sure you use quality prosciutto. The amount and mix of vegetables was perfect.

This recipe rocks. I doubled it, but I used 3 cups whipping cream and 1 1/2 sticks salted butter. I also added the parmesian cheese into the sauce and then tossed. I topped with more parmesian cheese and chives. I will make this on a regular basis!!

This was an enjoyable dish and very simple to make. I would make it again but would decrease the amount of asparagus and peas to at lease half of what the recipe currently calls for. There was certainly an over abundance of both of these vegetables in the finished product which took away from the taste of the prosciutto and crimini mushrooms.

Just got around to trying this recipe - WOW! I added extra cream and proscuitto, but didn't think about adding the garlic - will for sure do that next time. My husband was in heaven when he found the leftovers!

These tastes dance with each other! My only lament is my diet and the fact this is exactly the kind of recipe I can no longer enjoy with regularity ( i.e. Hi fat, hi Carb) That aside, when it is made, use extra cream and butter to that pasta is properly embraced. The tastes will dance in your pallet and you don't want to come up short when it counts the most. Also, splurg of some good Sonoma County vino for sure, it lifts this great meal into magificent realms.

Excellent pasta dish. The flavors work so well together. I'll echo another reviewer: make enough sauce! The fettucine drinks it all in. I added extra cream and butter.

Rating: 4
This was VERY good. I added one shallot and one large clove of garlic to the mushrooms. I didn't bother pre-cooking the asparagus, figured they would cook in the three minutes in cream, and they were done perfectly. My five year old who claims to dislike asparagus and peas ate it without a hitch. Very light, flavorful and springy.

We added shrimp and garlic. Be sure to make plenty of sauce!

4 forks...5 stars !! This was a fabulous dish. I, too, added minced garlic (2 cloves) & sauteed them along with the mushrooms. Used only 1/2 lb. fettuccine noodles, so there was plenty of sauce. Will definately make this again !

This was delicious and it reheated well for days afterwards. I also added garlic, and I made it without tomatoes--it's an easy recipe to play with. I'm glad to find a tasty cream sauce that's not too heavy. This will become a regular at our house!

Excellent! I will definitely make this again. I used farfalle instead of fettucine, as I thought it complimented the sauce a little better. Definitely add some garlic and/or shallots to the mushrooms when sauteeing -- it adds some more great flavor.

Excellent! It was very easy, and very tasty. We are vegetarians, so I made it without the prosciutto, and it was still really good. I added a little more cheese than was called for; it seemed a little bland without it. Overall, it's great though!

This receipe is excellent. I sauteed some shallots with the mushrooms (and added shitakes). In addition, I added a crushed garlic clove to the cream mixture as it cooked. I think its a great blueprint for many variations. Definately a keeper.
