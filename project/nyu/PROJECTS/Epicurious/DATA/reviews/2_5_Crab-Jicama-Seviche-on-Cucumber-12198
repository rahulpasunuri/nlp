I think this recipe is pretty good -- can't understand why others talk about adding heat (my guess is they didn't use the habanero as the recipe calls for). The one thing missing, I think, is cilantro. Chop up a handful and throw it into the crab mixture. The really cool thing about this recipe is the satisfying crunch the jicama lends to it. Great "ceviche," all in all!

I've made something similar to this and agree that it was a little bland. I suggest (a) adding a little cayenne to the crab mixture and (b) serving it on something more flavorful than a cucumber slice.

Tasty but not thrilling. This recipe makes a canape that looks lovely on a platter, but is not exciting to eat. Perhaps more garlic or jalapeno would help.
