i would agree with other reviewers that this recipe adds way too much powdered sugar. i would use 1 1/2 lbs at most, i ended up throwing out about 1/3 of the sugar and using two whole jars of peanut butter. only then were they moist enough to work with. i melted chocolate chips in a double broiler and dipped with a toothpick, but next time might use a small fork. i put them directly in the freezer to chill the chocolate and then in freezer bags ready for guests. i used a small cookie scoop to size them evenly and they taste lovely.

Really very easy, and delicious! Mine were slightly crumbly until I added additional peanut butter. I wish I'd made the balls a bit smaller, so they're closer to bite-size because they're very rich. Overall, easy, delicious, and I highly recommend it for gift-giving at Christmas!

I have made these for years and got my recipe from my grandmother and this definitely needs a few more ingredients. Theses can take time to make, but they are worth it! see my recipe below... " 1 pint (2 cups) of creamy peanut butter (not all-natural) " 1 ½ lbs. Confectionary/ powdered sugar " ½ lb. Butter " 1 ½ tablespoon vinegar (for acidic purposes) " 1 teaspoon vanilla extract " 2 cups of milk chocolate chips " 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 1. Line cookie sheets with wax paper. 2. Beat the first 5 ingredients together until mixture holds together and is moist. Shape into 1" balls; place on cookie sheets. Freeze one hour or overnight. 3. Melt chocolate chips and shortening in medium, uncovered microwave-safe bowl on high for 1 min., stir. If necessary, continue every 10-15 seconds until melted completely. 4. Dip peanut butter centers into chocolate using a toothpick, leaving a small amount of center uncovered (hence, the eye). Shake off excess and place on cookie sheet. Refrigerate, covered, until chocolate is set. Store in covered container in refrigerator. *Variations: My grandmother completely covers her peanut butter centers and to do so, set the centers on top of a bakers cooling rack and drizzle chocolate back and forth over the peanut butter center. Makes approximately 6 dozen.

While the recipe seemed straightforward enough, I struggled with it; I agree that possibly the sugar to peanut butter ratio may not be right. The mixture was too crumbly, so I had to add more PB to get the balls to meld. Note: "dipping" chocolate should be taken literally, I tried using a regular, good chocolate melted over a double broiler and it was too thick. I ran out quickly.

Sorry, but I think this recipe should be rewritten. While all Buckeyes are good, this one makes major mistakes. I stoppped making them at 80 and threw out about 1/3 of the ingredients. I think there is too much sugar for the amount of peanut butter and butter the way it is written. Mine are 1" balls just as it suggests. I'd cut the recipe in half and try it with less sugar and always add more if you want.

I've made this recipe twice now and, like other people I find it excellent but I have a couple helpful notes to add. 1: Use a melon baller as a scoop when rolling the peanut butter balls. If you fill the melon baller exactly to the top and not overfull, the balls come out to be the perfect portion size 2: I've made this recipe for my son's daycare. Like many schools and daycares, no nuts are allowed on the premises. However I found a great work-around to that: I made mine with half sunflower seed butter and half soy nut butter. As seed-based butters, both have a very rare occurrence of causing allergies so most daycares will let you use these in sandwiches in place of peanut butter. The recipe tasted very good with the substitution though I'd say that it could have used salt. (Both the butters I used were no salt and the lack of salt made it taste a little wheat-like.)

I too use chunky peanut butter and also add rice krispies, gives a lil' light crackling pop...amazing!!

WOW?! These are the best I have ever had. We keep them in an air tight container and freeze them, then pop out as many as we need when guests arrive. When we made the recipe it made 54 buckeyes, we were rolling them about 3/4 inch thick.

My husband is from Ohio and we made buckeyes as wedding favors. We don't use confectioners' sugar, but instead use crushed graham crackers. Delectable!

I found using a fork was easier to dip the balls into the melted chocolate, than the toothpic; the toothpic was too small and the weight of the balls made them fall back off into the melted chocolate - BIG mess!

I wanted to ADD... I used 2 cups of milk chocolate chips and melted them in a double broiler, over low heat, instead of the pre-made tub of chocolate (in recipe).

This was an EASY recipe to make; I used milk chocolate and they tasted better than any Reese's Cup. I store them in the refrigerator, as they burst with more flavor. I took them to work and everyone couldn't stop complimenting me on them; they were a big hit!

halved the recipe and there still a TON of these. i used chunky peanut butter and everyone loved the crunch. so good...

Loved the buckeyes but you will need way more chocolate than one 7 oz tub. I used the Wilton melting chocolate discs, two bags worth. Will make again for gifts for the holiday time. People could not get enough of these!

These are so amazing and addictive! They were a hit with everyone! I also followed a tip and froze the balls with the toothpick in them in the freezer, then melted chocolate chips and dipped the balls in the chocolate. I did not have a double boiler so I melted the chocolate on a really low heat and it worked. Just be sure to turn off the heat once melted and back on when necessary so it doesn't get too hot. So good!!

I am an official Buckeye, and this recipe is a great one (unlike the old time recipe that called for parafin to be mixed with the chocolate). But I do agree with the reviewer that suggested freezing the peanut butter balls (with toothpick inserted) and dipping in chocolate chips that have been melted down in a double-boiler; much more efficient. Caution..these little suckers are habit forming!

Incredibly easy to make and always a hit. My people tend to like a lot of chocolate, so I just roll the whole ball in it and use a teaspoon to lift. In the end, I may use double the chocolate called for here.

These are deliciously, sinfully awesome... BUT.. be warned... THE INGREDIENT AMOUNTS MAKE WAY MORE THAN YOU THINK! Also, you will need a LOT more chocolate for dipping. Be prepared for a LOT of candy. The recipe says it makes "36" 1-inch candies. I measured out level tablespoons to make the rounds, but the candies were closer to 2" balls... and it made 82 of them!! Forget the microwave dipping chocolate... that's what I tried first. If you go that route, you will need 5 or 6 containers of them, and the chocolate cools down during the dipping and becomes very viscous and makes a big mess. After much trial and error, here's is what finally worked for me: Make the peanut butter balls and put them in the freezer on a waxed paper-lined pan. It helps to insert the toothpicks first. Melt chocolate chips in a double boiler (semi-sweet or milk chocolate, whatever you prefer) - have extra choc chips handy!! - and then dip the cold balls into the chocolate, returning them to the wax paper and chill down again when done. These are really, REALLY delicious AND actually VERY VERY easy... but just not as the recipe is written!

I put these together and several other chocolate dipped items. I used Guittards Melt & Molds. I picked them up from AnOccasionalChocolate.com along with colorful sprinkles, and even edible dust in gold and silver to liven up the look of my creations. My friends were all amazed they thought I bought them at the store. Great fun.

Grandkids favorite. Much easier than the traditional cookie that is totally dipped in chocolate and just as good.
