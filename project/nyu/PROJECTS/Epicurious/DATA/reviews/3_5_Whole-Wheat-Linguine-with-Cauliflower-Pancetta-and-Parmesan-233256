Nutty, delicious winter pasta I will gladly make again. While I didn't follow the recipe exactly, using only what I had on hand, I was closer than some here (I used bacon rather than pancetta, and went without the bread crumbs and parsley). I thought it was wonderful. The cauliflower was delicious enough for me without roasting, but maybe I'll play around with using a bit less oil.

This dish is exceptionally good and has spawned an entire classification for me of when to use the "healthier" pastas. This really wouldn't taste as good on white pasta nor would other non-tomato pasta dishes. Also, don't deviate. It needs the pancetta and the parmigiano rather than, say, prosciutto or bacon and pecorino.

Made this with thick apple smoked bacon and followed the recipe as written. I thought the olive oil added as the sauce. I will try roasting the cauliflower next time. I have roasted sliced cauliflower for appitizers and it is excellent. Just delicious on this cold night.

I am making this for the second time since my family loved this with a few tweaks...roasted the cauliflower tossed with olive oil and garlic, and added about a dozen sliced brussels sprouts, sliced red pepper and red onion. I made this before with pancetta which was wonderful, but tonight I am trying it with turkey bacon. The red pepper flakes really warm up the flavors and make this dish a keeper. Roasting the cauliflower is the way to go. This dish is on my favorites list. Make it!

I roasted my cauliflower as well and cut way back on the oil. I omitted the parm and added goat cheese which did add a creamy goodness. Was a nice spicy tasty alternative to the usual.

Had high hopes for this based on other reviews. ....was disappointed. Edible, but wouldn't think of serving it to company and won't make it again.

Yum - I added some dried rosemary to the pan when I added the (substituted for pancetta) pre-cooked crumbled bacon (what can I say, I'm an over-busy mom), and I added plenty of fresh-ground black pepper before serving. I am excited about cauliflower again!

This was a great dish, will definitely be making it again. I roasted the cauliflower as suggested by other reviewers, and cut back substantially on the oil content. I added in a litte pasta water to thicken the sauce - the result was delicious and surprisingly creamy. I used brown rice pasta and it added another layer of flavor. A real keeper--

Yum! I'm not going to rate it because I made a few changes, glommed together from a couple of other similar recipes on this site. But I think I kept the essence of the original. I used bacon instead of pancetta and cut way back on the chicken broth. I also added toasted sliced almonds. Used whole wheat bread crumbs and used half the amount. Super yummy.

We enjoyed this hearty pasta for a mid-week dinner. I used whole wheat panko and it was deliciously crunchy. I found the cauliflower browned a little faster than the recipe said so maybe it depends on your stove. Next time I'd try roasting it as others suggested because I think a little less oil would be an improvement.

With the following adaptations, I'd rate it a 3.5 forks. I roasted the cauliflower (35 min in oliveoil, salt and garlic, added parm at the end), as suggested by someone else and cut the breadcrumbs to 1/4 c. Used proscuitto instead of pancetta (lower fat better flavor). I added a dollup of goat cheese at the end with the parm. Mixed in a little chopped parsley to add color at the end. Yum.

Did not love this recipe. It was kinda clumpy. Maybe due to the breadcrumbs. The cauliflower was good. I usually like whole wheat pasta, but did not like it here.

I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL!!! I roasted the cauliflower as suggested by a previous reviewer and I highly suggest it. I also added some chard because I had it and it added a nice element. Make this!

Excellent. I made it as is - but with penne. Very delicious and easy. If you use store bought bread crumbs - you may want to cut it down to 3/4 cup- 1C was a little too much. Still giving it 4 stars.

This is a delicious, simple recipe. I used bacon instead of pancetta and whole wheat bread crumbs. I cut the bread crumbs in half. I found it took about 15 minutes to brown the cauliflower. My husband and I LOVE this recipe and make it often.

delicious. I used dry bread crumbs and regular fettucine and was out of parsley....I added a few ounces of goat cheese with the parm at the end - I think it made a nice consistency for the sauce and little tang to offset the flavors. I used the roasted cauliflower recipe from epi instead of sauteeing, and it was all wonderful.

Great meal. Cut everything in half as it was only 2 of us and didn't want leftovers. I had whole wheat pasta and my husband had white pasta. Very fresh cauliflower right from the field! Agsolutely fantastic! Asked my husband if I should write a review and he said "YES!" That's a 4 star if I say so! I would definitely make it again. Used PANKO crumbs. Extra garlic

Very tasty. I actually made without the pancetta and sprinkled some nutmeg on at the end. Would definitely make again.

This was pretty good. Even my very picky boyfriend liked it, but I agree with a previous reviewer that something was just missing! I can't put my finger on it but it felt like I had left someting out.

This was fantastic. Unbelievably easy and full of great flavor. An excellent weeknight dish that 's simple to throw together and definitely tastes greater than the sum of its parts. i didn't bother sauteeing the bread crumbs, i just mixed them in right before serving, since i didn't think it needed any more oil.

This is an excellent recipe, but the fried up breadcrumbs were too much for it, in my opinion (too much oil and carbs.) Do use whole wheat pasta if possible as it adds a lovely flavor dimension and has a stronger texture. This dish is very filling - I had trouble finishing 3oz of pasta! The only changes I made were doubling the garlic and using a little more pancetta. Delicious! Will definitely omit the breadcrumbs next time.

Delicious!! Be sure to let the pasta absorb the sauce. Used the new orange cauliflower,smoked ham, shredded arugula and panko bread crumbs (what I had on hand). great leftover too

I don't care for whole wheat pasta, but this was delicious with regular linguine. This is an easy, tasty, and filling weeknight meal. Even my cauliflower wary husband loved it. Leftovers were great too.

Nice, easy meal, I made this for my family. Didn't have linguine but had quite the medly of almost empty boxes of pasta, so i used up alot. Also, didn't have pancetta so I used ham. Whole family loved it, though for the mature palates it needed a bit more flavor.

This is an excellent quick dinner. The flavor and texture is wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of whole wheat pasta so I will try spinach pasta next time.

This was so good it was scary. My wife thinks I'm some kind of professional chef. The cauliflower came out delicious. I couldn't find whole-wheat linguine, so I just used regular and it was still fantastic.

Forgot to say,,that I used Panko crumbs sauteed in the oil...they were the best part!

This was good but certainly not great and I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again. I always have pancetta in my fridge and if I had some cauliflower and and nothing else to do I might do it . To me it was filling and somewhat tasteful but something was missing!

I used store bought bread crumbs with the pasta and it was fabulous! I made double the amount (7 children) and there was more than enough to feed us twice! Yummy! The kids liked it too.

Really, really good. A great combination of flavors. Also easy.
