A wonderful and surprising sauce that I have made many times. Well worth making as a sauce for ice cream, pound cakes, and a must for the Boca Negra Chocolate Chipotle Cake. I used liquid vanilla extract and it worked just fine. Big hit with quests. Great for conversation and elegant entertaining.

Worth making to complement the Chocolate Chipotle Cake. I found the sugar and vanilla overpowered the tomatillos a bit (I used canned). I would cut down on the sugar a bit (I used a combo of brown and white sugars).

Incredibly good. Who'd have thought that tomatillos would be a dessert ingredient? It worked beautifully with the Boca Negra Chipotle Chocolate Cake. Tomorrow, I'm going to try it on some vanilla ice cream.
