The sauce is worthy of 4 forks. However... the instructions are deceptively misleading/lacking. Yes, it takes a while to make. But there is so much information missing from the instructions. I had to make this twice even though I followed the instructions to the T. (I consider myself an advanced cook, and average baker, novice candy maker.) I had issues with the sugar crystalizing, I had issues with the caramel seizing when adding the liquids, the seized caramel wouldn't release.... In short it was a time consuming mess and I don't even want to think about the clean up. I'm surprised another reviewer called this recipe easy - I found it very challenging, time consuming, and messy. Yes, I know part of this is to be expected when making caramel/butterscotch - however this is for those who have good/excellent candy making techniques.

This is worth the work. You need to keep an eye on things and use diligence when bringing the sauce together at the end. I have used it with rum, which I prefer, and served the sauce with a cranberry bread pudding from the foodnetwork (Giada)along with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream. I was actually surprised at the incredible reaction received from my fellow diners. Sometimes you are not sure if the effort is worth the results. This is and is a keeper.

This took much longer to prepare than I'd anticipated...but was worth it.

This recipe is easy and very tasty. I used a heavy stainless pressure cooker pot to keep the heat even, and swirled the melting sugar often. To add the liquid, use the 'thin stream method' to avoid splattering the hot sticky sugar. It turns out great.

THIS IS BOURBON BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE. If you substitute water for bourbon -- aren't you just making simple sugar with butter in it Duh, what do you expect that to taste like?????? If you don't want to make something with bourbon, don't make something in which bourbon is a key ingredient.

Yes, it did take a while but it was well worth the wait! A great sauce...I added about 1/4c. more booze than the recipe called for.

This just makes the brown sugar cheesecake. Ignore the person who used water and said it was so-so. They missed the point of the sauce! All they did was water it down! If you don't want to use the bourbon, just leave it out. It lessens the sauce, but at least it isn't diluted.

Nothing special, except I used water instead of borboun.

If you clicked the Chocolate Macadamia Nut Sauce link in the Deep Fried Ice Cream recipe and ended up here. I was able to find Chocolate Caramel and Macadamia Nut Sauce in another section. This recipe obviously contains no chocolate so it must be a mistake. I never could find the chocolate macadamia nut sauce recipe
