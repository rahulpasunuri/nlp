I make this every year to rave reviews but this year cut down on the butter and sugar by about half and it was still fantastic. I'll be doing the same from now on.

Delicious! I used 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 stick of butter (1/8 cup). I couldn't really taste the orange peel. Very simple and natural taste.

It was a really good sidedish. I put less cinnamon and nutmeg in and a little more sugar and my picky 2 year old ate this like it was the best thing in the world.

This was good and I'd make it again but it wasn't "beyond compare" (hence only 3 forks). Tried to use orange juice instead of grated peel but it didn't have the kick it needed. It was very sweet (as previous reviewers said) but I think that was the point and the kids loved it. However, between the roasting and all the dark spices, the color was not the usual bright sweet-potato orange (it was darker) and therefore less asthetic.

I love sweet potatoes prepared in almost any form or fashion, but this recipe is a new favorite. I agree with other reviews -- you can cut the brown sugar almost in half. I made this dish two days before Thanksgiving and then simply re-heated it for easy holiday preparation.

I've made this dish three times now - including for both thanksgiving and christmas. Every time, I find myself thinking "how can I lighten this up" - the texture is a bit heavy. I recommend adding more citrus - I like orange (I used the zest and an unknown amount of juice, I just taste as I go) to add interest as well as cut the heaviness of the dish. A very good basic sweet potato recipe - but don't rely on it to be the star.

Making it again right now! It was a hit at Thanksgiving. I found out too late that we did not have any oranges, so I put a splash of OJ in. The only draw backs are that it was really sweet (am cutting down on the sugar) and that it has the consistency of baby food (which I found to be an interesting change from the normal chunks served). It also has a lot of spices in it, so be prepared for an almost pumpkin pie taste.

Excellent! The citrus makes this dish unique yet still familiar favorite. A big hit this Thanksgiving.

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes to begin with, but it was Thanksgiving and I felt compelled to make them. This recipe sounded a bit different and I was hoping this would change my mind about sweet potatoes. It didn't. They tasted too much like orange (and I didn't even use all the zest suggested). My dinner guests agreed that they would've been better sans the orange flavor. This was the only dish of leftovers that I tossed.

This was okay, but nothing to rave about. Made this for T-giving and added two eggs and some light cream and baked for 1/2 hour. Needed a topping of some kind.

This is an excellent side dish-rave reviews from guests, added and egg and baked whipped potatoes/spices for 30 minutes.

Sorry but can't agree with the majority here. Just made this for Thanksgiving and tossed it out. It was awful. I cut down on the sugar & spices per suggestions and it wasn't good so added a bit more but it didn't taste better.

I first made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Everybody loved it! I have never been a big fan of sweet pototoes, but this recipe has changed that!

I made these for thanksgiving and thought they were very tasty. Since we had a small group I halved the recipe. I actually enjoyed the most using the leftovers to make pancakes the next day (i just mixed some into good ole bisquick batter). Excellent!

This time I cut the brown sugar to something beween 1/3 and 3/8 cup. We liked it better so I should give it 3 1/2 forks. Still prepared it a week or so ahead and froze the dish. Thawed, reheated for about an hour in 350 oven. Great holiday dish.

Nice flavor. This recipe was very easy to make. Even my children enjoyed it.

This dish was not the super Thanksgiving side dish I thought it would be. I thought that it was much too sweet, try half the amount of brown sugar, and that the spices were too intense. The delicious taste of yams was overpowered. I think there are better recipes out there. Not bad, just not rave worhty.

I used this recipe as my base, but changed things a bit using this and that from other recipes. I used less brown sugar (to taste - about 1/3 cup) and only 1/2 T. lemon juice. I also added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup half & half to make it more souffle-like. I made a small amount of topping using brown sugar, pecans and butter (just enough for visual appeal and thin glaze of crunch). I made it the night before and baked it until brown and slightly puffed (45 minutes). I've made it with and without spice (scaling the rind and spices WAY down) - and while I prefer the spiced version, the general crowd pleaser was the plain. Another tip: potatoes can easily be cooked on stovetop as well if necessary (unpeeled, cut in large chunks).

absolutely incredible, just the right balance of spices for me and hint of orange. non-fans of sweet potatoes even liked them. now i'm torn between this and the bourbon pecan sweet potato recipe, also good.

This was great! The next day I used the leftovers as filling for the Sweet-Potato Ravioli with Sage Butter (from this site) which turned out awesome and turned leftovers into a whole new meal.

This was an easy recipe to make, and was very tasty. Everyone enjoyed it at dinner, and said it tasted just like pumpkin pie! I used my stand mixer to mix up everything, and that worked very well. It also reheats easily in the oven or microwave.

I added 1/4 cup more brown sugar and 3/4 cups of toasted chopped pecans. It was fantastic. As with many things - I noticed that the flavors became more wonderful after sitting for a day!

I just made this recipe for Thanksgiving tomorrow. It is *SO* good! This is the first recipe that I have reviewed and I feel an obligation to do this because of how good it is! This is much better than the recipe I made last year (I don't know which one it was) but this is a keeper! I used more orange zest than the recipe called for because I had extra on hand...and then I also used probably about 2 tablespoons (maybe a little more) of fresh orange juice as well. It is delicious and I look forward to serving it tomorrow!

While making this recipe, I started to panic, so many different flavors, how would the sweet potatoes taste in the end? Fantastic!

Oh my! This was SO GOOD! I made it the day before and reheated it in the microwave, adding a little more butter to smooth it out. I think I'm addicted to this stuff! The family liked it as well, but I'm glad they left a bunch for me! I added about two potatoes to the recipe, but left the sugar the same, so maybe that's why mine wasn't too sweet. It was just yummy.

Highlight of the Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone was begging for more. I adjusted the recipe to double the orange peel and it was great.

I've never been a big fan of sweet potatoes, but this is delicious. The spice blend is perfect. This dish tastes like Thanksgiving! I agree with the cook from Cape Cod about the sugar - it could probably stand a little less. This is a winner!

Instead of preparing this a day ahead, I did it about two weeks ago and froze it. After thawing, I reheated it in the oven for about an hour. Any thing that cuts down on holiday preparations is okay by me. We loved this dish but next time I'll cut the sugar by a bit. Good blend of spices and citrus.

This was easy and the best part was that it could be made the day before. Tasted great. You can fiddle with the spices to get just the right flavor. Enjoy!
