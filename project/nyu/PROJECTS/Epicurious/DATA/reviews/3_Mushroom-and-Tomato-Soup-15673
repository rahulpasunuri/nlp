Despite major doctoring, this was only okay. I doubled the fresh mushrooms, used 1 can of San Marzano tomatoes & 1 Central Market Organic strained tomatoes, since that was all I had. I added fresh thyme, doubled the garlic and then added another TB near the end (I sauteed it first). It was still blah, so I added a couple TB of vermouth and a TB of sugar, let it simmer about 30 minutes. Still not great. Added cream per advice of previous cook. Made toasted bread bowls hoping that would help. If I had had fennel, I would have added it, I think it would have made a big difference. I don't know, maybe tomato soup and mushrooms just aren't meant to be together. They're great in pasta sauce, but they didn't add anything to this soup. I can't imagine how bland it would have been as written. I used homemade chicken stock, so that wasn't the problem. It needed more oomph. To the cook below, I believe Italian Brown mushrooms and criminis are pretty much the same thing. Also, the author should have specified weight on the porcinis, not volume. I doubled those, as well. Now I have a LOT of semi-bland soup. My husband will like it, but he'll eat anything.

I used tomato sauce instead to save the time of blending the tomatoes, and I added about a cup of cream as well. It turned out great and I would totally make this again. Cook on.

The flavor was fine, but I felt like i was eating a watered down pasta sauce. I added some chili powder for some more zip. Cream would be a good addition probably but then it wouldn't be low fat!

Wholesome and mildly delicious. I changed this one up quite a bit. Taking a cue from another reviewer, I used San Marzano tomatoes instead of diced. Also, the local stores don't usually carry anything as exotic as crimini or porcini mushrooms, so I used Italian brown and shitake. You could probably use just about any kind of mushroom as they don't add a lot of flavor in and of itself. Suggestions: even the 1/2 tsp. of pepper was a little strong for the weak, so you might cut it down a bit. I added about 1 1/2 Tbsp of sugar to help the somewhat bland taste and lots of salt.

Extremely tasy, and simple to make. This will become a staple in my house.

Yea--I found a recipe for dinner that eases my conscience over all the butter-rich baking I'd been doing. But I thought it could be more flavorful.. I used white mushrooms and would probably stick w cremini next time, and might add more garlic (I already used more than it called for), porcini or herbs (I used thyme, didn't have parsley!). Might help to specify weight for porcini, since they're so big there's a lot of air space in a half cup that might lead to inaccurate measuring. Salt was crucial.. without it, I couldn't taste a thing.

Used tomato puree, good Italian brand. Chose to slice mushrooms rather than chop. I think it makes a better presentation AND tastes better

Very good low fat soup, would recommend using good San Marzano canned tomatoes
