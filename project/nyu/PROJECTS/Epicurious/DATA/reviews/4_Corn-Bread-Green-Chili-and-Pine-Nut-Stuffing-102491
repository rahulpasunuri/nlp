I make this every year but with a few subs. I make it gluten free so I use GF corn bread only. I also add 1/2 lb chorizo and I make it simpler by adding 2 cans of diced green chilis. The stuffing is a big hit!

I found this recipe after coming home from the market with fresh poblanos, you can't always find them fresh in Cleveland. I served it as an appetizer for a family gathering, everyone loved it, including the kids and the picky eaters. What was not eaten my sisters were all to eager to tak home. I did not add the jalapeno and I did not have enough rasins so skipped those too - look forward to trying again with the raisins.

I agree with previous reviews that the amount of chicken broth should be reduced. I went with 1 cup and it was perfect. Using a broth that was not "low sodium" allowed me to relax about seasoning the dressing further. Agree that making the chili mixture the previous day is the way to go. It really did allow the spices to permeate the mixture. Sage can be overpowering, but this was spot on. Just delightful with Hatch chilies. Everyone loved it.

Kind of boring, which disappointed me as I was intrigued by the ingredients. I tasted it after I made it and thought it really needed more zip so I added some chipotle pepper sauce. It was ok, but not anything that was a runaway hit. Might or might not make it again, if I do I will definitely do some serious tinkering.

I have been a loyal Epicurious user for YEARS, and this is the first review I've written. This stuffing is SO DELICIOUS that it has become the focus of our Thanksgiving celebration - more so than the turkey. We only make it once a year and that makes the stuffing that more phenomenal. Originally I made the recipe exactly as written, but over the years I have started using cornbread from a box mix. I also usually end up using more broth than the recipe calls for to completely moisten the stuffing, but it depends a lot on the initial wetness of the breads.

Really good stuffing. I made no changes except I left the crust on the sourdough. I'd recommend making it a day early so the flavors have time to mix and intensify.

This was fantastic. I did not add all of the raisins and I think it would have been overkill with an entire cup. They really plump up with the tequila. I added more sage and thyme and be sure to add lots of salt and pepper. Everyone was very impressed. I have found my stffing recipe!

ABOUT ROASTING AND PEELING FRESH CHILIES: For those frustrated with how best to roast and peel chilies, I have never found a method that works as well as a gas flame. Like the cook from Colorado Springs, I have not had good results by trying to roast them in the oven. If you don't have a gas range, try removing the grill racks and some of the lava rocks on a gas grill and roasting them directly over the flames. You need to remove absolutely all of the outer skin, so you will need to char them black all over. After steaming them for ten minutes in a bag, the skin comes right off. Hope this helps.

This is now the fourth year I've made this marvelous dressing, and once again to raves from the crowd. Our dinner guests included a family from Lithuania and another from Ecuador. Both remarked about how wonderful it was. I used not only the Poblanos per the recipe but two roasted New Mexico green chilies to really give it some zing. I also used a buttermilk corn bread recipe, to which I added three diced jalapenos (seeds and all). Mighty fine!

Absolutely wonderful. Made the stuffing exactly as stated and it was just great. Everyone loved it. The pine nuts and raisins give it a great texture and the taste is sensational.

Made this for my first Thanksgiving this year. I would use golden raisins next time. I think I also used a bit more sourdough, I just added until I had the right consistency. I don't have a gas stove so I had to roast the pobalnos and then peeling them was not so easy. Don't know what I'll do for that next time. The onion mixture smelled so good when I made it the day before I could hardly wait to taste it. Definately a change from the tradtional stuffing. It was enjoyed greatly by all the guests.

Thought this was very interesting - liked the complex flavors and textures. Served it w/ a deep fried turkey to 10 friends - folks liked it, but no raves....

Simply awesome. We have a home in Santa Fe and enjoy spending the holidays there so I was anxious to see if it would pass the 'native' test. Our local friends couldn't get enough and our visitors want to add it to their traditional menu.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I used canned HATCH chiles from New Mexico and it was a time saving substitution that did not diminish the flavor of the dish. I will bring this to two Thanksgiving tables this year.

I made this for Xmas 1999, and will probably make it again this year. Outstanding!

Delicious,different. I used fresh spices instead of the dried and it was wonderful. For the first time, I think I've found a stuffing I will make more than once.

Excellent choice. The flavors blend perfectly. Everyone raved about it. The chilis add flavor not too much spice. The rasins and pine nuts give it a great texture. This is definitely a keeper!

To me.. corn bread dressing is the most important dish at Thanksgiving. I love it. This recipe is the best I've had. Fantastic! The sweet, plump raisins, the textural enhancement of the pine nuts, the pablano peppers are all great additions to an excellent basic recipe. I added celery, and buried a few oysters in there as well. Bravo!
