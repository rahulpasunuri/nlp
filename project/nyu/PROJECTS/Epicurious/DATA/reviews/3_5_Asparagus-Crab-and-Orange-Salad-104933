I didn't have any onions or chives (I forgot them at the store) so my salad had a sweeter taste, which my guests seemed to like. It was very pretty (I used meat from snowcrab legs) with great color contrast. The flavors were subtle in the dressing, which I thought was very complementary to the flavor of the meat. An overall, elegant composition.

I have made this several times but change the presentation to become a dish for a buffet dinner. I leave the asparagus long,place them on a narrow platter,pour the dressing over and sprinkle the top with crab and chopped green onion, ... always a hit and always someone wants the recipe, like this time! great and different flavours.

I thought this was good (Epicurious description for 2 forks) but not delicious or exceptional. As previous reviewers stated, the salad needs the dressing to add more flavor. I will probably make this again. It was very pretty.

Great! I used 2 6-oz cans of lump crabmeat; next time I'll use part of a third can to do at least 14 oz. I don't think imitation crab would have the same effect, and I don't recommend that. I took another reviewer's idea and used white wine vinegar; great idea. I used canned mandarin oranges, b/c this time of year, oranges are hit or miss. I used organic bottled orange juice, not fresh. I'd have preferred fresh. My guests loved this recipe, and even I did (though I dislike seafood). I'll make this a lot. We all thought this was worthy of a fancy restaurant! It' got raved reviews from all of us. You have to try this!

Had this as an appetizer on Easter Sunday, and it was delicious! Very easy to throw together. I used a white wine vinegar with tarragon, but otherwise followed the recipe. I wouldn't bother with the assorted sizes of asparagus next time, I'd just steam and cut into 2" pieces. A snap to throw together, and very elegant and fresh tasting.

This was an absolutely DELIGHTFUL, FRESH taste sensation for us. Did use imitation crabmeat (It was all I had in the freezer.), and subbed white wine vinegar for the plain. This is an especially nice way to showcase asparagus, especially now that it is in season. I served this alongside "Ham, Leek, and Three-Cheese Quiche" (also from this site), and it was a delicious pairing of flavors. I will make this many times just the way that I made it this first time, and not worry about the expense of real crabmeat.

WOW this was good. I made it with king crab from Costco instead of with lump blue crab or dungeness crab. Two and a half pounds of king crab legs yielded a good amount of meat for the salad; the more the better. The king was easier to keep in larger bite-sized pieces so the crab stood up to the dressing a little more. These ingredients are a bit spendy for salad, but I would make this again in a minute.

This salad is amazing. It is one of the lightest, and yet tastiest, I have made, and the only thing that stops me from making it weekly is the cost of fresh crabmeat! It is zingy, light, refreshing, and complex all at once.

Followed this recipe exactly and got great results. I agree with the other reviewers, the dressing is superb! If you have fresh, lump crab and fresh asparagus from Eastern Washington......lucky you! Fresh and tasty! Will definitely make the dressing again and again.

I rated this a 2 because the men at the table were not happy with the oranges in this dish. It is definately a ladies' salad. I would use less orange--it overpowers the lump crab

My husband loved this salad and I enjoyed it as well even though I am not a person who likes sea food. I did used canned crab meat but I also served this on a bed of baby spinach as a meal and it was stunning and filling.

I was really impressed with the dressing for this salad. Since I was dieting, I liked the fact that it was fat free, but the taste of the dressing was so great that I've experimented with it for other uses as well. It's equally good drizzled over vegetables, chicken, canned tuna (honest!) or anything that seems like boring diet food. I've served it to the nondieters in my life as well, and they raved about it too!

Only thing I changed is used 2 tbsp of sugar. Colourful and tasty, a nice change from typical mayo based crab salads.

Noticing that all the three reviews used can crabmeat is in insult. Using the best ingredients is what this recipe is all about. The simplicity and the flavors were fantastic. We paired this with a very nice chardonnay at a wine tasting and got nothing but rave reviews.

I used this recipe as a first course for Easter dinner. I wanted a salad, but something different from the usual green-leaf. Everyone was delighted with this tasty, healthy, colorful dish. Of all the compliments I received for the dinner, the salad was mentioned by everyone in attendance. I also used canned lump crab meat because I couldn't find any fresh at the last minute. It worked just fine!

I had my doubts about this recipe, however my doubts were out to rest. This was different and quite tasty. I used fresh picked asparagus from my garden. YUM! I did use canned manderine oranges only beacause the oranges I purchased were springy. Also, I used canned crab meat which was good, next time I will purchase fresh crab meat.

This is fairly easy to make except sectioning the orange. It was an impressive salad and extremely tasty. My guests thoroughly enjoyed it and I've even had requests for it again.

I should have been clued in by the fact that people liking this recipe were using canned crab. I used fresh and the salad still wasn't good. And, it is expensive. Not at all worth it!

Yeah for Costco!!! That crab is fabulous!! Stays right in the refrg and is ready to use any time!!! This salad is fine and I made if with necterines!!

Costco sells one pound cans of lump crabmeat in the refrigerator section (crab is cooked with long shelf life). This meat is as close to fresh as I have found without shelling the crabs myself. I added some julienned jicama and served it on a bed of mixed greens. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I used Japenese seasoned rice wine vinegar in lieu of the vinegar and sugar. This fat free salad is now in my recipe library! (next time I will try adding buttermilk to the dressing-sounds good!)

$28.00 for the fresh lump crabmeat at the local fish market. Meat was "fishy" and not what I had envisioned. Other ingredients didn't add much to it. Some liked it...but it wasn't anything to rave about.

In my grocery store the crab that's in the refrigerated section in plastic containers is raw. The stuff in cans is cooked and says so on the can, i think.

I have a question- is it ok to eat refrigerated canned crabmeat (such as Phillips) straight from the can? I always thought it had to be cooked first.

An excellent, fresh, tasty salad that can mostly be made ahead--all I did differently from the recipe was use a can of mandarin oranges, as others did as well, and add a tablespoon of buttermilk to the dressing to make it a little creamier and slightly less sharp. Wonderful! I made it as a side for grilled steaks, along with an Italian bread-tomato salad, for Mother's Day, and it presented beautifully and was delicious.

This salad was great. I did improvise though. I used canned lobster meat in place of the crab and used a can of mandarin oranges in place of the fresh oranges. I did, however, used fresh a fresh orange for the peel. Everyone enjoyed it very much. Surely, it would be nice with jumbo shrimp too. Thank you!

This was yummy although next time I would use a little less mustard. As an added benefit, if any of you are on weight watchers, it's less than 3 points per serving!!!

I used blood oranges because they were available in the market. The salad was delicious, easy to prepare, and almost too beautiful to eat. We rated it better than many salads we have ordered in gourmet restaurants.

Yo Spring Salad, What up? This rezipe started off great and got even greater. Y'all know Paul likes to grill, right? And that he can't resist the thrill, right? So how does Paul reccommend making dis rezipe oh so swiggity sweet? Here's how: Marinade the asparagus in a little teriyaki sauce, garlic powder and ginger powder (20 minutes) Then grill them mofos for about three minutes, two if da grill is hot! Use rice wine vinegar and add a little lime juice for da dressin and bingo bango you'll be doing the tasty salad tango. Props to the cook who suggested that sweet sweet canned crab meat. Dat stuff be the bomb! I can't wait to try it with da real thang. Good salad to y'all and Peace in the Paullenium.

fantastic and easy starter salad which would serve well as a luncheon salad as well. everyone at easter dinner loved it. wish i would have increased the recipe as everyone requested additional servings. its a keeper!

This is definately a keeper! Very easy to make and it adds a special touch to a simple ham, eggs, etc. Easter brunch. I too used the mandarin oranges with great success. Two of my guests who didn't think they were going to like the dish were found having 2 and 3 servings. So it was a hit!

Though I don't like seafood, I loved this salad, as did my Easter-dinner guests. I'll make it frequently. However: cooking the asparagus for 4 minutes made them mushy and slimy. Three minutes, tops, would be better. If you have no fresh oranges, a good substitution is canned mandarin oranges. I used a dash of white pepper in the dijon/sugar/orange sauce. The recipe yields 6 servings, but I found that I got 5 moderate servings; I used 12 oz. (canned) gourmet crab. I highly recommend this!

I will use this one frequently through fresh asparagus season! My husband substituted pan-fried (lightly in butter,then cooled) scallops for the crab and we used honey-dijon mustard.This wonderful recipe should work with any favorite seafood. It is visually appealing, as well. Absolutely a "company's coming for dinner" dish.
