This is a great recipe! I get lots of requests to make this because it is so fresh and tasty. I omit the rosemary because it is a strong flavor.Otherwise it is perfect the way it is. Crostini is a good way to use if you run out of endive leaves.

It's hard to specifically say what I didn't like about it, but it just wasn't tasty to me. I think I was thinking red-peeprs are sweet and this salsa is NOT sweet. I even added a tsp of sugar to bring out some sweetnss. The olives (which I usually love) added too much salt and made it taste like red peppers in sea water and I think the garlic was too strong, OK, maybe I can be specific - I didn't like it

this is a great salsa. it is light and has a wonderful flavor. i did feel it was heavy on the garlic and i am a garlic lover. i solved this by using a combination of goat cheese and cream cheese spread on the endive leaves first and then the salsa on top. it got rave reviews at my party and even though i tripled the recipe, i did not have any leftovers. excellent.

An excellent, refreshing combination. Also good on crostini. I adjusted the proportions of vegetables somewhat, using equal amounts of red pepper, fennel and olives.

The salsa if VERY tasty - the leftovers would be great with chicken breastss. Just don't assemble the whole thing early, as the endive leaves get limp.
