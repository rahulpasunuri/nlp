Perfect quick weeknight dinner. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I use rice vinegar. My 4 year old daughter eat it all up and my 6 month old son loved the apples smashed up.

excellent edge to apples with vinegar; quick but tasty

I did not think this recipe was anything special. There was no juice left after the apples sauteed so the "sauce" was all butter.

This is delicious! I used pork cutlets, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's going in the regular recipe rotation.
