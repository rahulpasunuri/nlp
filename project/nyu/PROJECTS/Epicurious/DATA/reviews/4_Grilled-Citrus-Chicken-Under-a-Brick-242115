Great flavor! Marinated overnight and prefer lemon under the skin. used thighs rather whole chicken as it was easier to plate for dinner guests. skin was crisp and meat was very moist.

WOW!!! I made this with a cast iron skillet on the grill and we didn't have any leftovers! My husband had a great idea to use the leftover marinade and put it in the skillet on top of the chicken to steam while cooking with the grill lid on. I saved some of the marinade before I put the chicken in it for some sliced zucchini and grilled those once the chicken was done and served it with brown rice with butter! My kids devoured the whole thing!! Will be making again very soon.

Made this last night. Excellent! Forgot to oil the grill rack so the skin stuck a bit but still was excellent. Served with smoky corn salad, wild rice and tomato and mozzarella salad with pesto and balsamic glaze. Yummy!

This was very good - don't have a grill, so put the bird in the oven at 350 for 20 min, finished under the broiler. Spice rub complements the marinade nicely. Used smoked paprika, glad that I did.

I loved this recipe! My boyfriend said it was the best chicken he has ever had! We used his cast iron grill/griddle to weigh it down and it worked perfectly. I had to cook it about 3 minutes more than they said, but it was moist delicious and perfectly cooked! The skin looks like it is burnt but it tastes amazing from that rub. You should definitely make this recipe, it is one of the best.

This was a wonderful summer meal! I've made it twice in one week. The kids and DH love it. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect, crisp and blackened on the outside and tender and flavorful inside. I will quadruple the recipe and make it for a barbeque I'm hosting in July--served with a salad of spinach, mixed greens, and strawberries, spanish rice, and blueberry cobbler with ice cream for dessert. YUM! thanks for a great recipe.

This was the best chicken we ever had. We did have to cook it longer then the recipe called for.

Couple things about this recipe. 1.) No mention of grilling temperature. 2.) Brick vs Cast Iron Pan Issue. With regards to the grilling temperature - a Medium to High temperature for the duration listed will yielded a dry bird. The brick wrapped in foil works better than the cast iron pan, as the pan gets too hot and cooks the bird from the other side (also drying it out). Best to use a Low to Medium grilling heat or reduce the listed times. Otherwise - Spice combination was incredible. Will try this again albeit at a lower grilling temperature.

I was a bit skeptical about this repice but it turned out great. I didn't use the brick nor the cast iron skillet.I may add more fresh herbs next time because I could barely taste them.

Marinated for 5 hours and followed recipe and method exactly. The chicken was moist and tender and the crispy skin (slightly charred) yummy. However, I did not taste the marinade very much, just a little on the wings. Perhaps I didn't turn it over enough or I should have put it in the fridge, I'm not too experienced with marinades. Next time I'll pierce the chicken a few times, that may improve the marination. The brick method seems to have produced the moistness.

Followed the recipe exactly - except marinated the chicken for 5 hours - based on all the previous reviews, I was expecting something exceptional, and this fell far short. Wouldn't make it again, as there are other recipes for marinated chicken that I think are far better.

I came inside from my dinner party by the grill to comment on how wonderful this chicken turned out. The white meat was incredibly moist and succulent, which is the true test for any grilled chicken method. Beware of BBQ flare ups. Other than that, go for it!

This is a really nice recipe for grilled chicken, and very easy to prepare in advance for a weekday dinner. However, it is essential to adjust the cooking time for a chicken larger than the one in the recipe. Mine was a little over 4 pounds and it required an extra 15 minutes.

This is good food. Surprisingly good, the citrus is not at all overbearing (marinated 4 hours). I'd stick with the method and use the bricks, as it makes for more tender and moist chicken. When you remove the brick the salt and the expansion of the chicken wick the juices back in. As for spices, I dropped the rosemary and used smoked paprika instead of sweet. Try this it's worth a go.

Excllent. To preserve the crispiness of the skin though, next time I make it I won't put the bricks back on after flipping it over. The bricks tend to steam the crispiness out of the skin...and since the bird is alreadu well flattened at this point, they don't seem neccesary.

Excellent, I brined the bird before hand so that may account for the moistness. To preserve the crispiness of the skin, next time I make it I won't put the bricks back on the bird after I've flipped it. Having them on the skin after it had crisped essentially steamed it. The bird was already well flattened at that point so the bricks seem uneccesary to the second stage of cooking.

Very moist and delicious. I think the key is to leave the chicken on the grill without disturbing it for the recommended 15 min then 20 minutes on the other side. Cooked perfectly, skin was crispy. Will definitely make again.

Have made this 7 times already. Out of this world. Almost refreshing tasting. Super moist. A real crowd pleaser. Weighting it down does not seem to be necessary.

I've made this twice, once following the recipe exactly and the second time squeezing lemons on it rather than oranges. I prefer the zingier lemons, but the important thing is that you get a nice moist flavorful chicken this way. Nice with roasted asparagus and risotto.

Followed recipe exactly, except marinated chicken overnight. The skin charred and pulled away when we flipped the chicken. Maybe the grill was too hot. This made for a very ugly presentation, but the flavor was terrific. Have some chopped parsley or cilantro on hand to salvage the messy appearance. Serve margaritas and maybe no one will notice.

Delicious flavours.Followed the recipe exactly but barbecued the "flatty" chicken without the brick,didn't think it was necessary and wondered if it would squeeze all the juices out.

Served this to a dinner party ... loved by all. Had the butcher butterfly boneless breasts with the first two joints of the wing attached. Also forgot the oranges, but included the slices under the skin. Terrific. The skin didn't get crispy ... probably should have cooked longer on that side. Still fab. (oh, and super easy)

Highly recommended: the meat was unbelievably moist and, after 24 hours in the marinade, deeply penetrated with citrus tangyness. Cooking in a friend's kitchen, I accidentally substituted unlabeled sugar for salt in the marinade, so the skin burned under the weight, but we are not really skin eaters anyway. Orange slices fell out when we turned chicken, and breast was done before thighs. NEXT TIME: Ill ¼ the chicken, add way more garlic and herbs and skip inserting slices. Grilling a whole orange was a waste of time too, though maybe it depends on the orange variety.

Easy and delicious. Being pressed for time, I used chicken breasts that I had in the fridge and store- bought mojo marinade to which I added OJ, paprika, rosemary and freshly chopped garlic; only marinated for 3 hours. Awesome and my family loved it; used leftovers in next night's "at- home salad bar for dinner." One catch - skin stuck to foil wrapped around iron skillet (used foil to cut down on cleaning time). Will use spray oil on foil next time.

Brined the chicken for ~18 hours before marinating; otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Very easy to make and guests loved it; will definitely make again.

I was looking for a new way to BBQ turkey breasts & found it in this recipe. It was excellent! I didn't flatten as they were cooking, but the breasts turned out crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside.

Very easy recipe. I marinated the chicken overnight and the citrus flavor came through nicely. I had no lemon so increased the lime to compensate. The BBQ was at about 400 and the skin ended up quite burnt but delicious anyway. The kids were intrigued by the bricks. The polenta was also delicious. I will definitely make this again this summer.

Wonderful dish, and so very easy. The flavors were perfect, and the chicken came out very moist. My guests loved it. This will be a go-to recipe for the summer. Definitely marinate overnight. It gives the chicken that wonderful, bright citrus flavor.

I misread the recipe so ended up heavy on the lemons and light on the oranges. Squeezed 2 oranges and sliced up lemons for under the skin. It was wonderful! We really loved it.

We loved this dish. I marinated the chicken or about 3 hours and the flavour was delicious. I didn't place the orange under the skin but we did love the roasted orange and next time I will roast 2 oranges. I served it all on a platter with pan fried squares of the creamy corn studded polenta.

The chicken had lots of flavor, but was a tad dry. Think I'll brine first before I make again. The grilled orange was great & the accompanying creamy corn-studded polenta was outstanding.

I only had time to marinate the chicken for 90 minutes so we didn't get a very strong citrus flavor. That being said, it was juicy and delicious. Next time, I'll marinade it for at least 3 hours.

Delish! The orange slices under the skin really made this dish. I used more garlic and herbs too.

Fan-flippin-tastic! This chicken packs a load of flavor. The grilled orange infuses the chicken with its freshness and intensity. I don't understand one clove of garlic - don't quite know how to add, so I used four cloves - Bam! (Can't seem to help myself.) Served the chicken alongside sliced garlicky grilled potatoes and asparagus and this is a dream meal. My husband and daughters were cleaning the chicken off the bone. Give it a try & you'll be doing the same I guarantee it.

This is an incredible, delicious recipe! Hubby raved about it! I made it almost per the recipe (I snipped off and chopped a little too much of the herbs so I used it all) and it came out unbelievably moist. I did have to cook it longer than the recipe called for, but only because I had a larger chicken. I made this for dinner two nights ago and with just the 2 of us we have leftovers that we are looking forward to having tonight! Definitely a keeper recipe. I was tempted to skip the grilled orange part, but don't. It really adds to the dish.

I loved this, but I had to double the citrus amounts to adequately cover for marinading. I also added some dry mustard to the rub. This is now a favorite and I will make it again and send it on to others.

I agree with the previous reviewer - I wasn't sure about the orange but this was one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. Made exactly as is and will be making it again this weekend.

WOW!! This was fantastic! It was so moist and flavorful. I wondered a little about grilling the whole orange till it was charred and squeezing the juice over the cooked chicken, but absolutely do this, as it imparted a smokey orange flavor that really makes the dish! This is definitely a keeper. We did cook it a little longer than recommended, but maybe our grill was not hot enough. We served this with the Mango Radicchio Caprese with basil vinaigrette from the same (May 2008) issue of Bon Appetit and it was also fabulous and went very well with the chicken. I would give this 5 forks if I could!
