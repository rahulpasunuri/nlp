One yea; one nay in our house so this one won't be on our table again.

Wonderful combination of textures and falvors. As Julia Child says, "what would we do without shallots?" The thing to remember about using endive is to remove the leaves one by one by either cutting the bottom part of the core in small pieces or breaking the leaves off the core as you would an artichoke. Disgard the center or heart of the endive as this is bitter.

My husband liked this better than I did. I've determined that I'm not an endive fan. It's too bitter. However, the salad was good and if I make it again I will use less endive and more mushrooms.
