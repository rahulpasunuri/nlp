So good! I altered it for ingredients I already had in my pantry. I used regular eggplants instead of Japanese and olive oil instead of peanut oil Also, this was my first time using yellow miso paste. They had it at my grocery store (Publix) but it was difficult to find. Can't remember exactly where it was, but it is refrigerated. I think it was by the bacon, hot dogs, etc. Delicious ingredient, keeps for a very long time and I use the salad dressing recipe on its lid all the time.

OK. I know people don't like it when you review the recipe and you didn't do it to the letter...but I didn't have everything on hand and wanted to make some revisions. I didn't have curry paste, so I made my own. I used lemongrass, fresh ginger, ground coriander, fish sauce, cumin, chipotle sauce, a little soy sauce, sugar and coconut milk and put it all in the food processor. Used fresh green beans from the garden. Teeny japanese egg plants cut into slices. It was heavenly. I served it over basmati rice and topped with chopped cilantro and some bean sprouts that I had. My 2 and 4 year old were dipping fried tofu slices in the sauce and begging for more. I will definitely keep this in the repertoire and absolutely recommend home-made curry paste. Oh! And I dumped the rest of the can of coconut milk in at the end and simmered a bit. Amazing.

The string beans were delicious but the eggplant needed a lot longer to cook than three minutes. Since I followed the directions, the eggplant was undercooked. Toasted sesame seeds were a good addition.

Excellent! Used scant 1tsp green curry paste (still pretty warm) and 1 tsp fish sauce with 1/3 c water in lieu of miso which I was out of. Threw in a few green onions and used small green beans instead of verts. Really great side dish in just 10 mins or so.

I love this recipe. I made it with regular green beans (cooked a wee bit longer) and served it with the salmon with thai red curry on this site). the red curry has a nice earthy spice without too much heat. wonderful!

Love this! Definitely can cut down on the amount of oil. Next time I won't use more than 1 tablespoon of oil and my non-stick skillet. But the flavors are wonderful, and I love the combination. Wouldn't have thought of using the 2 veggies together...thanks for the great idea!

No idea why this got mixed reviews, we LOVED it. We used red miso because it's what we had, and that was fine. A delicious, quick and easy vegetarian meal.

This is why I love epicurious. I have something in my kitchen that I don't know what to do with, and as an extra challenge, I'm only going to cook with what's on hand. I do a search for eggplant and get this incredible, earthy, spicy, crunchy and fresh veggie dish. I had organic green beans and baby eggplant picked by my daughter. The beans were fat and the eggplant was small, but there is a nice rustic feel to the dish. I have red miso instead of yellow. I served it with grilled filet mignon, cornbread muffins and tuna, potato and artichoke salad. Since I doubled the sauce, I'm cooking some rice and tossing some sliced steak with the leftovers. Just amazing. (also, this is definitely a Japanese flavor, not Thai).

Delicious. I realized I didn't have miso, so I used a little white wine and a splash of fish sauce to add a depth of flavor/umami. But the basic combination is absolutely delicious.

Really delicious mix of flavors and very easy to make. I sauteed tofu and kale and added those in with Japanese eggplants. Yum! The only thing I would change is to double the amount of sauce as it didn't make that much.

I love this simple curry. I use white miso paste when I make it and I always add extra Thai red curry paste. I also add more ginger and sometimes a chili or two. It is great with tofu too.

excellent mix of flavors

this is incredible! not that you would ever guess, it definitely seems simple enough but it is one of our favorite dishes we add some basil at the end and since we dont have any access to yello miso dont use it. Let the eggplant burn a little and use one tb brown sugar too! EXCELLENT

I was expecting more to be honest, not a lot of heat but that might have been due to my thai red curry paste selected. IT did taste clean - but i would have done more giner and ore chili

I needed a side dish to round out a meal of Thai leftovers and other odds and ends, and this was a great way to do it. I used yellow squash in place of the eggplant, and some julienned carrots added to the beans; I boiled them briefly before stir-frying. It was a colorful and flavorful side dish.

A simple and delicious weekend veg dish. I used regular green beens and simply cooked them longer. Cook it until the sauce 'thickens' and sticks to the vegies. I served with a baked salmon filet with sesame vinaigrette and steamed rice. yum.

Yummalicious! Cook until the "sauce" seems dry. Served it with shrimp-fried rice, seasoned similarly. Agree with others: need to use the real (usually canned) Thai red curry paste.

Lovely weeknight meal. I added chicken to make more substantial. Substituted green beans for the haricots vert, which required more cooking time. If substituting you might want to saute beans first so the eggplant doesn't become too mushy. Skipped the miso and added a bit more curry. Topped with cilantro and served with brown rice. Recommend when you've got a Thai craving because this couldn't be any easier.

Has promise. Maybe I just purchased a really intense Thai curry but it was way too hot (and I like spicy food). I added a little honey as an immediate fix. Next time I'll halve the curry The beans and eggplant are terrific. Also took some other reviews into account and added tofu and yellow pepper.

I have made this recipe many times. The flavors are great if you use the kind of red curry paste that you buy in a can from the Thai markets (not the insipid kind in jars from the supermarket)and if you add more like a tablespoon rather than a teaspoon. It is spicy, though - too spicy for kids.

I followed this recipe exactly...up until the point when I tasted it. It was just SPICY, without any real flavor, and I did not think that my family would enjoy it. I then got myself into a mess adding lime, sugar, and coconut milk in a futile attempt to "improve" the dish. Ahhh! I often improvise Thai eggplant dishes, trying to mimic those I have eaten in Thai restaurants, with better results than with this recipe (though with several overlapping ingredients). In this case, I blame the miso, which I absolutely love in its own sphere of reality (i.e. Japanese cuisine), because I have never been aware of it being a common ingredient in Thai cooking (I'm all for fusion cooking, but it has to taste good!). So no, I do not think this dish would be served at an upscale Chinese restaurant...

Very delicious. Goes great over white rice.

I've been making this almost every week for over a month- I just can't stop. It's quite spicy, and the eggplant has a very creamy texture. Unique.

I love this recipe. I've made it at least 6 times and have given it to several friends. Easy, tasty and left-overs are excellent. I make extra curry sauce and keep it in the fridge.

I absolutely loved this dish. It is hearty, full flavored, and yes a bit spicy. I used a non-stick wok and reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon and it was just delicious. You would expect to have this served at a great Chinese restaurant.

I am eatting this for lunch as I write this review, and it is delicious! I added added in fresh thai basil, firm tofu and yellow onion. The flavor is wonderful, the combination of the garlic, ginger, miso and curry gives a full, entoxicatingly fragrant body to the vegetables. Fairly easy to make, and I can't imagine that anyone could not like it, even non-eggplant lovers. Highly, highly recommended. I could imagine a great dinner party menu including this and sesame crusted salmon with orange-miso dipping sauce, which should be online as well (it was in Bon Appetite), and of course rice.

Made this side dish for an "asian" dinner. Everyone loved it. Replaced the red thai curry with middle-eastern Harissa sauce.

My regular grocery store didn't have miso...so I substituted the same amount of commercial asian black bean sauce and used chicken stock instead of water. I also added shitake mushrooms to the recipe as well just because I had them around. The dish was definitely zippy with the curry paste and was delicious over jasmine rice. Next time I think I'll add shrimp (for my husband) to make it a real main course.

Green beans and eggplants aren't my husband's favorite, but he and I loved this combo. However, for us, I will reduce the red curry paste by half. This will provide very mild heat instead of medium heat. Over rice is a great idea.

Really great. It makes a lot more sauce than really necessary, so serve it with rice.
