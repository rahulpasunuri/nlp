This was an excellent and easy recipe. The cakes were moist, but not too sweet. Had a tough time finding a small quantity of instant espresso, so I substituted the International Foods Italian Cappuccino crystal. It was excellent. A big hit, would definitely make again

I make this recipe all the time, for just about any special occaision. It's so easy, and everyone loves them. My fiance's father actually calls them Zoloft cakes because they make everyone so happy, and now that's the only name my friends know them by!

Divots! Nobody mentioned divots! I had small divots in the middle of each cake???? I guess that's why you serve them upside down. I heeded the "too dry by overcooking" advice , so I kept a close eye out. Tested the first time, it was raw batter. Let cook another minute. Tested the second time and still raw batter. Let go for one more minute (I actually set my timer all three times), and well, I got DRY. They taste good if you like dry, so I guess if you have the patience to test, and stand watch, these would be decent. For me, there are lots of other small chocolate cake recipes that don't have the fine line of could be good, could be bad. I'll make them instead.

I made this for my friends 30th birthday and it was a big hit. I used kahlua in the cakes and in the whipped cream and that came out really well. Next time Im going to try it with bittersweet chips, and a raspberry sauce. Its really dense and fudgy, like a torte. I noticed the cups that were really full were the ones to colapse the most, but the cream covers the colapse.

These are fabulous - amazingly quick and delicious. The trick is to UNDERCOOK them - I usually only bake them for 9-10 minutes. They'll be gooey in the middle and cakey on the outside. Great with ice cream if you don't feel like making the whipped cream, and are great served with berries and/or heated jam. Mmmmmmmmm. I make these often when I need to throw an impressive dessert together in a hurry, or when I just need a scrumptious chocolate fix.

Am I the only one whose muffin tins were either too large or too small? I opted for the too-large tin, and the result looked like a hockey puck. I may try again with the too-small tin, as the prep was easy and the accompanying espresso cream, raspberries and raspberry sauce I added made a beautiful presentation.

I thought this recipe was a total bomb. I usually am thrilled with any recipe rated 3 or higher forks. But this one had no pizazze. The cake was dry even though I watched the time carefully. Also, I used Ghiradelli chocolate. I definitely won't add this one to my permanent collection.

This dessert was amazing!!! I will be making it again and again. The cake was light, fluffy and not too sweet. I also could not find any instant espresso but used folgers classic roast instant coffee for the cream. Some tips for it though are to make sure to measure out precisely how much batter for each cup cake. With this cake easily becoming dry, exact measurements is required! Or you'll end up with gooey cakes and hard cakes. Also the raspberry puree is a great compliment to this dessert. If I could I would give it 5 forks!

I made this for our anniversary and my husband was floored. I want to tinker with the cakes- mine turned out a little dry, but next time I'll try some of the tips here. The espresso cream was divine! Next time I might try a thin chocolate sauce drizzled on top as well. And don't skip the raspberries. The sweet berry flavor is a perfect counterpoint to the bittersweet chocolate.

I've made this recipe three times. 1) good; 2) too dry and not-so-good 3) fabulous. The difference? Cooking time and chocolate quality. The 3rd time I used Perugina chocolate and timed it just right - 1 min more then a gooey toothpick. They were moist, chocolatey and I served them with malted vanilla ice cream.

Made this last night to embarrass my boyfriend who is never big on his birthday. Served it with 25 year old vintage port. As someone who doesn't bake a lot, this was dead easy and quite a hit with everyone. My boyfriend does not like things too sweet, and he had 2 servings. The recipe calls for "instant espresso powder" but the whole concept seems counter-productive and alien. I used freshly ground espresso, a little less than the recipe called for.

I liked this recipe a lot which didn't surprise me since I love chocolate and coffee flavors. I didn't have espresso powder but used some sanka crystals I had in my cupboard (good use of something otherwise unused). The cakes were a touch on the dry side because I did the toothpick trick and waited too long the second time I checked. I would agree with previous reviewer that next time I will time it exact and pull them out of the oven right away. The batter is enough to fill the cups half way and they come out the right size. I wanted to make them just like the picture but I realized after I went to the grocery store that there wasn't enough chocolate to make the shavings at the end as you need all the chocolate for the batter. Next time, I will buy extra chocolate for the garnish. This dessert looks and tastes impressive.

I cooked them a bit longer because the center kept coming out with crumbs and they were a bit dry. I would recommend following the recipe and pulling them out with crumbs and immediately dislodging them from the pan. I served them with the espresso cream along with raspberry sauce (frozen raspberries blended with sugar) my company raved. I would make them again because they are so easy!

My roommate, who is a big fan of both chocolate and whipped cream, declared this her "dream dessert". It was super easy, and incredibly yummy. I suspect that the cook who wrote the previous review let them bake too long, since the ones I made are still moist two days later. Also, you should have enough batter for all 12 (if making a full recipe) if you only fill the muffin cups halfway. They expand while baking.

Be carefull if you make this recipe. I halved it but only had enough batter to make 3 one-half cup size 'muffins'. I cooked them about 12 minutes and then let them set for a couple hours before I served them, and they were horribly dry and not great tasting. My chocoholic husband didn't rate them high at all even though he did like the espresso flavored whip cream.
