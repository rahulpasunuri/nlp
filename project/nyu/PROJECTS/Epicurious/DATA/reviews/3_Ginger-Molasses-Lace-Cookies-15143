Superb! But I need to practice rolling them on a wooden handle more. To get more ginger taste, I put 3 slices of fresh ginger in while boiling the sugar and butter. And they only needed 8 minutes in my oven.

Don't cook these longer than 5 minutes b/c they will burn. They are greasy, they are not flavorful, and there is a lot of parchment paper waste. Not worth it - I will never make these again.

Best cookies,on my 3rd batch of season. Only issue is the recipe does not make 60 cookies, closer to 40.

you can't use wax paper instead of parchment paper, because the WAX will MELT in the oven...

This is a healthy and delicious cookie. No eggs is what I've been looking for and the taste is superb!

I guess maybe I didn't do these right, but I didn't really like them at all - from start to finish. I used wax paper instead of parchment paper to cook them on, and they wouldn't come off the paper hot or cooled, even with all that margarine. And, in the little pieces of cookie I was able to take off the paper and taste, the ginger was too overpowering for my liking. I had to throw the whole batch away, stuck to the wax paper. Too much work for such a disappointing turn-out.

I guess I didn't know what "lace" cookies were, but this tasted more like candy than cookies. The flavors were otherwise fine. Also, I agree that the dough was way to soft and sticky (even after chilling it a bit) to be "rolled" into anything.

Excellent cookies easily made

This is a really easy and deliscious recipe but my batter was very liquidy and was not able to "roll balls". No worries though, the results were fabulous - cool baked cookie on cookie tray about 2 min, then picked up and roll around a turkey baster for beautiful presentation.
