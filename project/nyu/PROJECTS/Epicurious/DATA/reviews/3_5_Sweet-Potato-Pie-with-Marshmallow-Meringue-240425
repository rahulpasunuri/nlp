After serving this last year at Thanksgiving and Christmas, I believe this will be "my dessert" each winter holiday. My friends who cook ask for the recipe the second they taste it. Going to make it this year at home and on the road. Worth the work!

I just made this recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving and did not make any adjustments except I chose to use a store bought graham cracker crust due to time limitations. My family and I unanimously agreed that it was delicious and the presentation eye catching. I did not find it to be overly sweet and the amount of seasonings recommended were just right. I would definitely make this again.

Yummy and filling. Omitted the 1/4 cup sugar and the 1/4 teaspoon salt. Did not make meringue, it could be a good touch! For the base, I used cornflake crumbs, a great salty savory contrast to the filling. Folks said they preferred it to pumpkin pie, I definitely think it stands up better on "its own" (no whipping cream, ice cream, etc.) than pumpkin does.

I loved this pie, and so did everyone I served it to! I did vary it up a bit though. I ran out of nutmeg, so I substitute some ginger instead. I also accidently left the pie in the over a little to long at the end, and the marshmallow meringue darkened a bit too much. This actually added a nice toasted marshmallow flavor, which was surprisingly well received. I also thought the yam filling was distinct and delicious, and didn't taste like pumpkin at all.

This recipe has become a staple at my family's Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. It is so easy to make, and absolutely delicious for anyone who likes sweet potatoes and wants to switch up the pumpkin pie for something a little different. I have never made the meringue topping since I'm not a big meringue fan - and admittedly run out of time usually - but all this pie really needs to finish it off is a little whipped cream.

All the extra sugar is unnecessary. I didn't add sugar to the meringue or the filling and everyone agreed that if it had been any sweeter it would have been too much. That being said, it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. And even my boyfriend who doesn't normally like desserts like this one said it was awesome.

I forgot about this pie. I made it last year for Thanksgiving. The meringue is easy and delicious. Putting the marshmallow cream back on my shopping list.

This pie is so delicious that I have stopped making pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving & now make this one. I have made this pie for the past two years & will definitely be making it again this year.

I made only the filling - used a prepared crust. Used one large yam and had extra filling which I poured into a small silicone baking container and baked along with the pie - worked fine. Mistakenly used 2 T not 2t of fresh lemon juice - but that was a good thing. It was not too sweet. Deliciously sweet per my 11 year old but not cloying. Forgot salt. No one missed it. This was excellent - looked great, cooked perfectly, tasted delicious. Next time won't bother with crust at all.

I don't know why I didn't read the reviews before trying this recipe. The pie is delicious, but too sweet as written. I will omit sugar from the crust and sweet potato filling next time. I also think I may try evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed for the filling. I like the marshmallow meringue, but it will only work if the filling is much less sweet. I used the 3 yolks left over from my meringue in the custard filling instead of 2 whole eggs, and the consistency was perfect.

We hosted a coffee/champagne/dessert Christmas get-together for 10 people. I used the Chocolate-Caramel Macadamia Nut Tart form this site as well as an English Trifle, Sticky Buns, Marbled Graham Cookies, Cream Cheese Peppermint Squares, and this Sweet Potato Pie..... and although it was well receive, it was not high on the list by either me or my guests. It was way to sweet, cloyingly so that the potato is more a vehicle for sugar rather than a flavor of it's own. I have an old sweet potato pie recipe from a soul cooking friend which I will continue to use, rather than this one [she also puts butter in her filling - noticeably missing flavor enhancement in this recipe]. The topping turned out perfectly however, so I may use it in the future with my own pie recipe.

My whole family loved this pie. I used Marshmallow Fluff instead of the Kraft Creme and it was fine. This is time consuming but was worth it to get the reaction that I did as the Thanksgiving dessert!

Was a delicious Thanksgiving dessert. The changes I made: (1) did not add sugar to the sweet potato filling and it was perfectly sweet in the end; (2) substituted gingersnap cookies for graham crackers in crust; (3) used 4 tbsp butter for the crust; (4) topped with toasted sugared pecans.

My wife and I made this recipe over the weekend for a Fakesgiving dinner party. It was a real hit. Like many reviewers we did not add any sugar to the sweet potato filling. After adding sweetened condensed milk it was sweet enough. I think next time we make it I'll double the meringue recipe, it didn't seem as high as the picture.

This is a holiday staple at our house! The first year I made it exactly like the recipe. Now, to make it easier for the kids to help, we cheat and use canned sweet potatoes. There is never any left overs!

This was delicious, but I think it was a little too sweet. The graham cracker crust turned out wonderful, but got soggy the day after, swimming in the melting sugar from the pie and meringue. I'd say you almost need no sugar in the sweet potatoes and marshmallow meringue. I'd make it again, but with adjustments.

I took other reviewer's advice and left out the added sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone thought it was great. It was still very sweet, any more sugar would have been too much.

Tasted exactly like pumpkin pie- too much nutmeg and cinnamon. Everyone who ate it couldn't even tell it was sweet potato- it looks, smells and taste like pumpkin! : (

I made this recipe for my family on Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit! I made a few changes, though. Whenever I make graham cracker crusts, I up the health factor by using an egg white and 1 tbsp. melted butter, along with a little powdered sugar and (the magic ingredient!) some cinnamon. This crust actually holds together better without being too hard to cut through. As for the topping, I took other suggestions and omitted the marshmallow creme, substituting a few extra egg whites. It was DEFINITELY still sweet enough! All in all, A+. I'm definitely making this again next year!

This recipe is super easy and yum-o-lious! I have made it twice and the second time I must admit I cheated and used a store bought graham cracker crust. It is a good combination of texture and taste.

I am a sweet potato fan and love this recipe -- the crust, filling and especially the meringue. I've made it for other afficionados who also raved about it. If you like toasted marshmallows, you'll like the topping. For leftovers, the meringue isn't quite as good so I set it under the broiler again to make a crisp topping. Fabulous!

The end result of the pie got some good reviews. However, the crust was a bit too crumbly on the edges but still cut well. I did not add the sugar to the sweet potato filling as other cooks have noted it would have been too sweet with the topping. I followed the directions to add the meringue to a cold pie and it 'weeped' a little. I have read other meringue methods to always add meringue to a hot pie to prevent this from happening. It looked and tasted good and came out better than I anticipated.

I made a traditional flour crust. The filling and meringue with this crust were delicious!!! I added less sugar with the sweet potatoes in anticipation of the sweet meringue. Texture much smoother than a pumpkin pie! Wonderful!

I thought this pie was delicious, and I also didn't do the marshmallow topping. One problem I had was with the crust. I didn't have enough graham cracker crumbs to build them up above the rim of my pie dish, which the recipe says to do (although I had the amount of crumbs called for in the recipe). I don't think that would have worked anyway, since it was very crumbly and probably wouldn't have built up very well without falling off and out of the pie dish. I used the 6 tablespoons of butter as instructed, which made the crumbs very, very moist. When I baked it for 10 minutes, the crust was still moist and the butter was still bubbling, but it had shrunk down so that there was almost no crust left on the sides of the pie dish. I baked for another 5 minutes (15 total) because it didn't seem done. Anyways, it tasted great when it came out but was a bit hard, maybe because of the overbaking or maybe because of the shrinking down in the oven. Next time I'll use more graham cracker crumbs and try the same amount of butter. The pie was great alone, but we tried it the next day with some vanilla ice cream, which is also delicious. It holds up really well in the fridge - I made this on Friday during the day, served on Saturday night, and we're still eating it on Wednesday! Yummy recipe that I will definitely try again.

The pie was good, but I wouldn't make it again. I spent a day deliberating whether to make an italian meringue topping or the one it calls for, and now I wish I'd read the reviews. It was way too sweet. My crust wasn't the one from the recipe, so I can't comment on that. I would consider making it again, but not with the marshmallow fluff in the meringue.

The pie is sooooooooo yummy! I didn't make the marshmallow topping, though. I think it would be much too sweet with it.

The pie was absolutely delicious! I roasted off 3# of sweet potatoes which gave me 3 extra cups of puree. I used this to make a harvest bread. I wouldn't use the marshmellow fluffi in the future. Tradional meringue would work perfectly.

This pie turned out as pretty as the picture. Unfortunately, it is gag-me sweet (this coming from someone with quite a sweet tooth). The crust is VERY rich, and the meringue is so sweet that you can't taste the pie filling. It's really too bad - beacsue it came out looking quite impressive.
