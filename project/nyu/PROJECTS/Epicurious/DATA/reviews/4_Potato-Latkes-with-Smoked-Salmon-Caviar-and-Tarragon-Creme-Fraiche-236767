Yummy. Made as a main course and as an appetizer. People liked it.

We made this as our contribution (First Course) to a holiday group dinner and it was exceptionally good. Prepared it as written with two latkes per plate: one with saltier norwegian lox and the other with a slightly more smokey scottish rendition. I used golden white fish caviar which worked brilliantly. As this was part of a menu suggesting that it be served with a citrus salad, I used the Citrus Salad with Minted Sugar : (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/fo od/views/Citrus-Salad-with-Mint- Sugar-108943) and stuck with the pomegranate seeds rather than the dried cranberries. The pairing served with a Piper Heidsick Champage drew universal raves. Enjoy

Absolutely delicious! Served this at a family Sunday brunch and received compliments throughout. The flavour combination is bang on. Make an extra batch or two of latkes - I ran out and I even made extra to boot. They will be gobbled up! Yum! A keeper for me, and I am quite particular...

We all thought that this was GREAT! It was our New Year's Eve brunch and started off 2007 on the right foot. Had it with a little of the bubbly...yum.

This is a nice way to eat smoked salmon. The latkes are very easy, the creme fraiche is nice and light and the flavors all meld nicely.
