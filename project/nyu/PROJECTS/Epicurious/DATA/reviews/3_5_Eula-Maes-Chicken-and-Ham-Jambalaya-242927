This was tasty although not as spicy as I've come to enjoy with jambalaya. It also had a few technical flaws. The 3 cups of broth plus the residual liquid from the tomatoes was NOT enough liquid for 2 cups of white rice. So I added a cup of dry white wine.

Added tumeric, cumin, and cinnemon. Substituted carrot for the celery. Came out deliciouso, just a hint of curry to add to the jambalaya goodness.

it is the weekend before Madi Gras (Fat Tuesday for you Yankees); no football games so a great time to entertain...one inch of snow on the ground and more coming to Va...enough Chilean red to warm you before you spoon up this delectable La favorite. Got corn bread and a red cabbage/tangerine/fennel salad.......when will that red velvet cake be slathered with sour cream icing?

I agree with the reviewer from Denver.It was too much work for not enough wow. Paul Proudhomme is the chef to go to for New Orleans food.

This recipe was so so. I'm a big fan of Paul Proudhomme so this recipe just didn't measure up. Careful to leave a lot of time to prepare. It somehow lacked the richness one would expect from jambalaya.
