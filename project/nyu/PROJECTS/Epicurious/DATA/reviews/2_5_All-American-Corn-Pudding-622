I would rate this a 3.5 too. It was easy to make (I had all of the ingredients on hand) and it was quite tasty. I was preparing a last- minute dinner party and wanted a vegetable dish to go with All American Baby Back Pork Ribs that we were taking out/bringing in from a restaurant. It got compliments.

Actually, I'd rate it 3.5. I found this easy to execute with a food processor to cream the corn, which I rinsed and tossed in the dishwasher afterwards, so the clean-up was minimal. Since I only had non-fat dairy milk on hand, I used unsweetened low-fat soy milk. Worked seamlessly. Served with tuna latkes with dill pesto, steamed green beans, and sliced tomatoes. Would work well with roast pork or turkey.

Simplify! I skipped the pureeing step and used 1 can creamed corn and 1 can whole kernel corn. I didn't bother to saute the green onion ahead of time and, if you do it my way, you can mix it in the same dish you bake it in. I cut the milk down to 3/4 cup to compensate for the liquid in the creamed corn. Cuts the prep time to practically nothing!

This was good, but a bit bland. Given how many dirty dishes were left after the prep stage, I'll probably choose something a little easier next time. I made it with canned corn (premium stuff) and it worked fine. Was well received, but too complicated for our lifestyle.

This took over an hour to get solid but there was alot of food in the oven so this may have been why. Guests were not wild about the texture but I really enjoyed it warmed up on the second day.
