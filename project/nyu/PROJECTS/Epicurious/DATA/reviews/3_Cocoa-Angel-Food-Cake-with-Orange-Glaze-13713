This cake came out with a lovely light, spongy texture and good chocolate flavour. I prefer the glaze a little more orangey, so I added a few drops of orange flavouring rather than the liquor, which worked well.

I like this recipe and have used it repeatedly, although it is challenging, and I got the heavy result a couple times. It takes practice. I like a chocolate version of angel food cake.

Awesome cake IF you follow the directions closely. The most challenging part is whipping the egg whites just enough but not too much, and then patiently folding in the flour mixture.

I thought this cake was super. I had been planning to make this for a while, but when I looked at the reviews I was a bit hesitant. I'm glad I did though; this cake was light and delicious. It is a great chocolate indulgence without the guilt. I think that it takes a lot of focus, though--you really need to follow the instructions carefully. FYI, I couldn't find self-rising cake flour, so I went to the cake flour's website, which recommended 1 c. cake flour, 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 tsp. salt as the substitute for 1 c. cake flour.

I made this for someone in my office who is on a no fat, no cholesterol diet. The cake did turn out rather dense and heavy, but I think it may be because I beat in the dry ingredients at low speed instead of folding them in properly like I should have. I did not use the orange glaze topping, I used a marshmallow icing instead. A good choice, because the cake itself is not very sweet. This disappeared in about an hour in an office of 15 people -- and not everyone got to try some. Everyone said it was great!

I've had this recipe clipped from the magazine for years, finally just made it. Very disappointing. Cake was sticky and heavy, not very high, not like true angel food cake at all. Orange glaze did help, but not enough. never again.

I this only has egg whites, but it turned out to be a very heavy and dense cake, nothing like an angel food cake. I can't imagine what I did differently. Also, the orange glaze does not have a good consistency after cooling. The whole thing was a disaster.

THIS WAS VERY EGGY WITH A FUNNY AFTERTASTE. IT WAS MORE LIKE BAD CHOCOALTE CAKE THAN LIKE ANGELFOOD CAKE. I DON'T TRUST MYSELF AND I'M WONDERING IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG!
