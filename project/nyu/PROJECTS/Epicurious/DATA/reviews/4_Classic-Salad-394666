Really great recipe. I have a friend that asks me for it every time she's going to cook dinner for her boyfriend.

This is even better if you add a spoonful of the juices from a roast chicken to the dressing!

Easy, fresh and delicious. I used a little anchovy paste instead of anchovy and lemon juice instead of vinegar.
