Very yummy! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into about 2" pieces. Served with coconut basmati rice. Used petite diced tomatoes and skipped the food processor part. Had a nice spiciness from the cayenne and a creamy flavor from the peanut butter!

Seriously unimpressed. To be honest, I did some minor substitutions - ketchup for tomato paste, fresh hot chili peppers for cayenne - but I don't think it was the problem. It was bland - the flavors just didn't meld.

Super delicious. I didn't change a thing about this recipe. The stew is rich, complex, and incredibly filling.

This has been an old favorite for my family for a long time. I follow the recipe as is, except that I add cauliflower to the stew for one more added texture.

Surprisingly good. I was a little taken back by the peanut butter, but it turned out really tasty. If I were to make this again, I would use a little less peanut butter and more stock or tomato sauce. It came out a lot thicker than I expected. The okra got soggy after a while and if I made it again, I'd fry up the okra to top off the stew with. We had tons leftover and froze it, which kept very well.

This turned out great - even our 12 and 11 yr old liked it, with the 12YO actually eating the okra. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and fresh okra from our CSA. One thing I learned is to not use the big okras - they're not edible since they're so fiberous.

Has anyone tried to freeze this?

Very good. Will add more spices next time. Reminds of my childhood when my grandmother would make this stew for me :) I also expected the stew to be a bit thicker, but it tasted great! Will definitely make again

Fantastic recipe--easily adaptable for vegans/vegetarians (which I am); I used Quorn "chicken", and it was amazing. Would be great with fried tofu or chicken-style seitan too.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Nice and tasty, with a good amount of heat. I made a few changes: I added a little coriander when sauteeing the onions and squeezed some lime juice in. Next time I'll probably add more okra, too. This will definitely be a recipe I'll make again.

Surprisingly yummy. Looked a bit bland as it was cooking but the finished results were delicious. Couldn't get my hands on any Okra so I threw in some spinach leaves before serving (for some greenery). Also used squash instead of sweet potatoes. Adding this to my collection for sure.

similar to a ground nut stew I make usually with pork - to the question of the sticking to the bottom of the pan I find it identical when I add the peanut butter at the very end, after everything is cooked.

I made this dish for our book club where the theme of our night was West Africa. We loved it! This is a fantastic and unique fall meal! The amount of cayenne was perfect - not overpowering but certainly there. I used cut up chicken breasts instead of frying a whole chicken and browned it in a a few tbsps of vegetable oil. Very easy and very good!

I have made this several times and friends and family love it. Do not use frozen okra. Fresh or canned is the way to go. I do add a couple of carrots and after browning the chicken set aside the white meat untill the end so it stays tender. My old fashioned hard to please husband prefers this to chicken and dumplings!

My boyfriend said this dish would be very good on a cold winter's night. I agree, except that I wanted to make it with fresh okra from the garden and this is September. I prepared this dish as written, except that I used fresh okra. It was good, and a nice way to use okra. It is a healthy dish as well.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I followed the recipe as written, sans tomato paste (didn't have any in the pantry). This was a great way to use the fresh okra I picked up from the farmer's market this weekend, I will be making this again.

This is a good dish. It's nice with chunky peanut butter too. I think I prefer it that way actually. I suggest removing the bones from the chicken because it's awkward to deal with the bones while eating a soup dish (spoons don't really do the job).

This was very good. I whisked the peanut butter in to the chicken broth before adding, which prevented it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. This recipe was a big hit with dinner guests. I will make it again, often.

i am about to make this dish, i just wanted to point out that acidic things, such as lemon juice or tomato sauce, helps to "cut" the sliminess that okra gets when it's cooked. so that would explain the reviewer who omitted the tomato and got a slimy result. this is a good thing to remember in other okra recipes that don't call for something acidic but wouldn't suffer from its addition.

Rating: 2
Tasty - but the flavour wasn't as full as we like, so I made additions: juice of 1 large lime, canned okra (fresh not available) but didn't go slimy like frozen might, lots of fresh cilantro just before serving. Next time I'll use a little less peanut butter and add chopped peanuts.

This dish is one of those dishes that you walk into the kitchen and say "MMMmmm, what is cooking that smells so good!?" We thought this was delicious, and are looking forward to the leftovers tonight! At first I was concerned with it being too hot with that much cayenne, but the heat was just right. The only change I did to the recipe was to add more broth to thin the stew, which I would recommend. Next time I make this dish I'm going to cook the sweet potatoes in the stew some before adding the okra to prevent the okra from getting overcooked. I like the suggestion the other reviewers gave of including cauliflower and a touch of lime, so will definitely try those variations in the future. The peanut butter did stick to the bottom of the pan, so if anyone has suggestions as to how to prevent that, I'm open to them! I know that this will be a winter staple in our household for many years to come. Too bad there isn't a higher rating than four forks . . . .

For those of you who used okra and didn't like it or found it slimy, only use whole okra and you won't have that problem!

Rating: 1
Blah. This is bland and needs a whole lot of spices to fix it. I usually agree with the fork ratings on this website but this recipe was a huge disappointment. Will try to salvage it tomorrow by adding cumin, cilantro, chile peppers etc. tomorrow. The African peanut soup from "I can't believe it's tofu" on this website is much better.

I thought this was great, next time will make just a few changes. The sauce was REALLY thick, maybe will cut down a bit on peanut butter and add more broth. Had trouble with the peanut butter sticking to the bottom of the pan but it didn't affect the flavor. Added carrots and will experiment with other veggies as well. Served with brown rice and was delicious!

The dish was very easy and delicious to make. I didn't have any tomatoe paste so I omitted it. I thing next time I will use something other then orka. I didn't care for all the seeds and there is sort of film inside that didn't go very well.

Rating: 3
I made this in a slow cooker per another reviewer's suggestion. I cooked it a little too long b/c the sweet potatoes got mushy. I would adjust that next time and use skinless chicken breasts to reduce the grease. I did add peas at the very end - a nice addition. Would love to figure out how to make the porridge they mention with the recipe.

Rating: 3
Very good and very different. Based on the previous reviewers suggestions I used the juice of a lime to help balance the flavors. I knew okra wasn't going to fly with my husband so I used cauliflower instead, it was great. This was interesting and I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
I served this dish to my in-laws and they loved it - we all loved it. I did add the juice of one lime. My version had a nice kick of spice too. I browned the chicken then compiled all the ingredients into the slow cooker so the meat was falling off the bone: a true stew. I will definitely make this again.

This dish was colorful, healthy, and tasted fine. However, the flavor was not outstanding and the leftovers were slimey because of the okra. If I made it again, I would make it spicier and try to avoid having leftovers.

It is a beautiful color for serving during autumn. I didn't think the taste was spectacular, however, there isn't any left! Would make again. Husband liked it. Kids were so-so with it.

All was scrumptious except that the okra was "yucka" according to my group. (I had never cooked with okra before.) Next time I would delete it and add some large strips of green bell peppers a little while after adding the sweet potatoes, and thicken the pot with a mixture of flour/water. I used 4 large leg quarters that weighed 56 oz. after skinning and de-fatting, and we flashed them for 5 minutes a side on high on the gas grill until they were nicely browned (eliminated the frying in oil). Made 50% more sauce, and deleted the tomato paste (don't like it) and used 2 cans of tomatoes. I had sauce leftover (no sweet potatoes though) to which I added par-boiled white potato cubes when we ate the leftovers. The sauce tasted great even before adding the okra and sweet potatoes, so I think that it will still be good with green peppers!!! Do try this, though, esp. if you LIKE okra!!!

this recipe was so delicious for a cold fall night. it's good with wild rice mixed into the stew. i would highly recommend it!

Good, but could use a little something more. Also -- thawed okra cooks much faster than raw sweet potato, so add the latter to the ppot first.

i enjoyed making and serving this chicken dish and will definitely make it again. i did, however, make a small but i think important addition. the peanut butter makes an unusual sauce but it can feel overly rich. i added the juice of a lime, which i felt balanced out the flavors beautifully. when i make this dish again, i may even increase that amount. another thing to watch out for; as the dish simmers at the end, the peanut butter settles to the bottom of the pan and can burn easily so it's important to keep stirring down to the bottom of the sauce from time to time to keep everything emulsified

We felt this dish was a little flat. It could have used more dimension with additional aromatic spices to round out the flavor like cumin, cardamom, coriander, cinnamon. Try serving with rice with minced cilantro. It will add a fresh touch to this dish, and will balance the richness of the peanuts and potatoes.

This dish could be renamed Southern Chicken Stew with Okra. It has all the ingredients popular in the South. This recipe is delicious. The only thing better than peanuts with okra is peanuts with chocolate.

Delicious, rich and hearty soup, though the chicken is by no means necessary. It works just as well without it.

Interesting flavors, but not for everybody. My family doesn't like okra. The peanut butter turned some off. I'm glad I tried it once, but won't be making this again.

What a great dish! I have never tried African food of any kind and this is a great introduction. I used chicken breasts, fresh okra and chunky peanut butter (smooth is not an option in our house!) and had great success.

Wonderful!! I was worried the flavor might be too peanut-butter-y, but it wasn't, it was just right. I also used lo-fat peanut butter (all I had in the house) and it worked fine. I also added some spinach, and that turned out to be a nice addition. Definitely worthy of serving to company.

This dish is unbelieveable!!! Only changes I made I used fresh okra, which may make it slimy tomorrow but fresh seems absolutely fine, and I used chicken breasts. Awesome flavor, will make this a lot for the fall and winter, haven't even tried it with the rice I made to go with it, either way...great dish!
