I should have read the review first. It's good, but yes too much butter and salt.

I used this as the basis for Matzo Brei with onion. This is a cooking food site so please don't try it as the expression goes "if you can not stand the heat stay out of the kitchen". I enjoyed this and used it to correct a few things too much egg, preparation of the Matzo. But I have to say a few things for those that love to interject their tastes into things non-stop rather than appreciate good things the way they are. Matzo Brei is inextricably traditional Ashkenazi Jewish cooking from a tradition largely lost due to WWII Holocaust. Two the first time I remember eating Matzo Brei as a child it was prepared and served by a Jewish concentration camp Survivor (whom had her number on her right forearm above the wrist). Where the onions were not grated but cut into small pieces and fried until light brown, with approximately the amount of butter prescribed here, as that was the European fashion in a pre Julia Childs pre-health finicky society where food was appreciate for what it is. So though I would not object to any one cooking as they like I had to say all this in full appreciation of this meal which I rated three forks as nothing is perfect. The technique of preparing the Matzo with cold running water especially worked well as previously I have had problems. The basis of the recipe was added to browned chopped onions and worked well.

I thought this was wonderful and reminded me of the kind my grandma used to make. I changed a couple of things: less butter (just about 2T), less salt and wet the matzah with hot water.

Pretty much how my family makes it, except we just use enough butter to grease the pan. Also, rather than running cold water over the matzot we pour a tea-kettle's worth of boiling water. I know some people do a sweet matzo brei, but I definitely prefer it topped with nothing but salt.

Tasty recipe. Quick and easy. However, this calls for a ridiculous amount of butter. I halved the butter and it was still too much. I think you could use 1-2 tablespoons or even just enough to coat the pan and the matzo brie would taste better. My husband agrees. Unless you just really like butter.

OK, OK, this isn't a review, but neither is this matzo brei. Use only 2 eggs, sugar and cinnamon. you can also cut way down on the butter, just enough to grease the pan. then serve with some warm maple syrup

I thought it was way too salty. Will try to use 1/4 tsp salt next time. Will also try incorporating some tips I've read here.

Ok the way that is stated but I make it with grated onion in the egg. Have made it this way for 20 years and it is always great! I break the matzos into pieces but not too small. Place in sieve and let hot water moisten them very well. Afterwards, place the matzos in egg that already has grated onion, salt and freshly ground pepper. Melt unsalted butter in pan and cook your matzo brei. Also, optional add fresh chopped parsley to eggs.

This was good. But, my family recipe is better. The process is similar... large broken pieces of matzo are soaked in milk until softened. Then the pieces are "squeezed" to eliminate extra liquid, then dipped in beaten egg and put into a heavy skillet with melted butter. Cook over medium flame, breaking up into small pieces with a spatula, and "fry" until crispy... salt, pepper and raspberry jelly.... mmmmmm!

My kids love it topped with maple syrup, since store bought pancake syrup is not Kosher for Passover.
