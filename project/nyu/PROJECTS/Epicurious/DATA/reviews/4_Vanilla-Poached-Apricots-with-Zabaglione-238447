I only made the apricots portion of the original recipe; I served them over scoops of vanilla frozen yogurt. After the apricots were finished poaching, I removed them and continued to boil the liquid to reduce it a bit. Once it was chilled, I spooned a little over the yogurt as a syrup, along with the apricot halves. The apricots were so tender and full of flavor! Will definitely be making over and over as long as the apricots hold out.
