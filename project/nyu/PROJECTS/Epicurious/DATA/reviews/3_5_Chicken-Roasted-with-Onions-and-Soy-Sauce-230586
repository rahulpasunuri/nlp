Very delicious! however, I like my food hot and spicy so I replaced the oils with hot chili oil and add minced ginger. Eliminated the salt and pepper. Also I baked everything in my deep dish, clear glass Pyrex-perhaps that was another reason it came out so delish. Also I caramelized the onions in the hot chili oil for 3 minutes; (hint: to carmelize do NOT stir them during cooking)

This has become a classic in our home. I make it as is except cut out the salt - the soy sauce already does its job. I serve this with cucumber salad on the side and hot, plain white rice. Fantastic.

This is one of my go-to dishes. Sometimes, I make it with boneless chicken, too. It's so good and the sauce is great... sometimes I half again the sauce just to have more of it to sop in the rice! Everyone loves it, every time.

Made as stated. I will put some red pepper flakes in next time==our taste.

Excellent! I did not use the salt as previously suggested. It certainly did not need it. The breasts I used were on the small size & dried out. Still really good. I will use larger ones next time. Bet this would be good with thighs! There were just 2 of us, but I used the full recipe of the sauce. I will double for 4.

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes that I have found on Epicurious. It is so easy and simple to make. My husband and I eat this over and over.

Very, very good.....I doubled the marinade....added ginger and sambal to taste, then marinated for 6 hours. Sauteed the onions for 15 minutes, then added chicken and marinade. Roasted at 375 for 30 mins--chicken breast was cooked--and continued concentrating onions for another 10 mins! Served over jasmine rice.....try it, it's worth it!

This was just OK. We all thought it was too salty. It has potential though with some modifications. Will probably give it one more try since it was pretty easy to put together for a week night meal.

I had read that others suggested adding heat and marinating longer and that the recipe required more marinade, more sauce. I doubled the marinade and used this for only 2 boneless chicken breasts. I added a half teaspoon of red chili paste and a teaspoon of minced ginger and marinated overnight---this was not intentional it jusy worked out that way, I was careful to turn the chicken and reposition the onions every 8 hours or so. For some reason it was the onions that picked up the heat of the chili paste. I had napa cabbage, green beans,and red pepper and carrot in the fridge (had made some minestrone) so I blanched green beans then sauteed in smoking hot peanut oil w garlic, sauteed julienned carrot w a little ginger and finished w rice wine, sauteed julienned red pepper and nappa cabbage w peanut oil, sesame oil and a dash of soy, combined and sliced the finished chicken on this bed of veggies and it was great, colorful and tasty. I dusted w some black sesame seeds that also made it fun.

Didn't take original, taste like Chicken adobo. Doubled the sauces and should have excluded the salt all together since Soy Sauce has enough of it.

I doubled the sauce/marinade, omitted the extra salt (which was a good call), and used Pinot Grigio since I had no gin or rice wine. There was a lovely heap of carmelized onions in the pan when it was finished. The sauce didn't permeate the chicken as much as I would have liked but having extra sauce made up for it. I took the chicken out after an hour and ten minutes because 90 minutes seemed like overkill on the breast meat. It was delicious and ridiculously easy to make.

Great recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed it and the leftovers are almost better! The only thing I noticed with this recipe is that it was extremely salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce. I did however add the salt that was called for in the recipe, when I make this again I won't add the salt. I also doubled the recipe for the sauce so that there would be lots and served it with rice. The sauce with the rice is excellent!

Expected to like this dish more than I did. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts as that was what I had on hand and other reviews had used the same. For my taste, it needs to marinate much longer, perhaps overnight. I didn't use the salt as the soy sauce is high enough in salt. Next time I would probably add some ginger and/or hot sauce to the marinade to kick it up.

This dish has become a staple in my house. My toddlers love it. I have made it according to the recipe leaving the skin on the chicken and found it way to greasy and had a hard time ladeling the fat off. Also sauce didn't marinade through the skin very well, making the inside of the chicken kinda bland. There wasn't enough sauce (because everyone loves pouring extra sauce over their rice) and it was a little salty. So I now use chicken thighs with the bone in and peel off the skin and I double the sauce and omit the salt. I don't even bother marinating it. The skinless chicken soaks up all the sauce while cooking and turns a yummy color.

The combination of the saltiness from the soy sauce and the sweetness from the carmelization of onions makes this dish very interesting. It not an authentic Chinese dish but much better than Charlie Phan's vietmanese claypot dish.

An easy to prepare chicken dish. I used 2 lbs. of chicken breasts instead of drumsticks and it turned out great. I portioned it out with some steamed brown rice and took it to work for lunch.

I'm sad to admit I was a bit disappointed in this recipe after the reviews. It's nothing great and doesn't have a real chinese flavor to it.

Made it with chicken drumsticks and it was great. Did not use the rice wine/gin and it was fine. If anything, it was a bit salty - so maybe would not add any salt next time. But a very tasty meal. I did not need to cook for 90 minutes (only did 60), but maybe it was because I only cooked 5 drumsticks. I did have a bowl of potatoes and 2 spaghetti squash halves roasting in the oven too though...

This is a very good and simple recipe with subtle flavor. I pretty muched followed the recipe and used the Gin although I did use a garlic press to save some time. The onions at the end are incredible. The kids even approved of it.

Was fairly dissapointed in this dish. Not terrible......but won't be making again. Had high hopes based on some of the ratings....but it just didn't do much for me or my husband. He said throw this one away :(

The first time I made this, I tried to get away with substitutions and improvising - like using regular soy sauce and longer marinating time - but the dish came out just so-so. The next time I made it, I shopped for the correct ingredients and followed the recipe exactly. It made a huge difference, and has become a keeper in our home of seven people, ranging in age from 3 to 75. A real crowd pleaser, and easy to prepare.

This was a very easy dish to make. Had all the ingredients at home. I enjoyed making it today because it is so easy and painless. It smelled great while cooking. I think the taste is not bad but not a "wow" dish. It was a bit bland. I will probably make it again when I don't know what to make or when I have very little in the kitchen (all ingredients are easy to have on hand).

So easy, and comes out with a great Chinese taste, though the recipe is actually pretty healthy. I used chicken tenders, and sauteed shallots b/c I didn't have any onions. I put broccoli spears in with the dish and baked it all together - it came out great. Served w/ wild rice.

This was a very easy and satisfying weeknight dinner. I, too, used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and reduced the cooking time by half.

Delicious and simple. Have made this dish twice using whole chicken cut into eighths and a few extra thighs and drumsticks. Served with rice and stir fried vegs. Also plenty of sauce since the dark meat releases more liquid.

Didn't realize until they were thawed, that the chicken breasts I took out of my freezer were boneless. No problem--that just reduced the cooking time by half, which I counted as a bonus. This is an absolutely scrumptious recipe. I made it last night for the first time. My guests loved it, went back for seconds, and I still ended up with leftovers, which I am delightedly looking forward to having for dinner tonight. Served it with pasta noodles cooked al dente and refrigerated ahead of time, then warmed in peanut oil. There is a Green Onion Casserole on this site that I included in this menu, as well. (My review/rating of the casserole is posted with that recipe.) It was the perfect complement. Lucky me! :) Thanks for this terrific recipe.

Deeelicious!!..I used skinless thighs and legs;worked as well.I interpreted "blast" as raising the heat to 500 for 7 mins.I reduced the salt to a half tsp,and garnished with toasted sesame seeds and fresh corriander. Green beans and basmati rice make this dish sing!

A good recipe. My whole family liked it. I took the chicken out after only an hour as it was completely cooked through by then. Did anybody who cooked it the full 90 minutes think it was dry or overdone? Thanks.

Absolutely wonderful. Very easy, the flavor is wonderful, and the sauce adapts well to increases or decreases for serving size. My husband raves about it and had me make it the very next night after I served it for the first time. A definate keeper - great because I always have the ingredients on hand.

This was a wonderful dish. Took a long time, but it was well worth it. I would make this again and figure out how to increase the amount of liquid left in the dish at the end, it was wonderful to pour over the rice, but I was left wanting more. (Which is never a bad thing!)
