The puree was very good. I followed suit with other reviewers and used cilantro in place of parsley, as that sounded much better to me. The chowder was a little boring, it definitely needs the addition of the puree to add some heat and fresh green. Since I made this in February I didn't get to use fresh corn, so had to make do with canned creamed corn and frozen kernels. Not as good as fresh, but it was fine if you want to make this in winter. Perfect recipe for the immersion blender. I omitted the optional ham steak, so can't speak for how that turns out when blended. I'd give this somewhere between 2 and 3 stars, but since the recipe calls for fresh corn I'll bump it up to 3.

This had a bright and delicious flavor. I used roasted hatch chile instead of jalapenos that I left in chunks instead of adding to the puree. I used 2 more ears of corn and omitted the potato. Also added 10 shrimps in the shell.

I used 3 roasted hatch chilis in place of the 5 jalapenos, cilantro in place of parsley, baking potato in place of the boiling potato, and alderwood smoked salmon in place of the ham. I feel that the strength of this recipe lies in the flavor of the corn. If you can get farm-fresh corn on the cob, it might be delicious, but the flavor of mine was a little dull. Note that 4 med-large ears gives 4 cups of corn. I served it with buttermilk biscuits. My husband loved it, though!

3 1/2...... fairly easy to make if you have a hand blender(essential tool!). Made my puree really kicking with habanero. My two cents: maybe a bit potato heavy and a bit of cream/dairy wont hurt.... the puree itself is awesome!

I made both to prove a point and my 5 guests agreed: ditch the parsley - sub cilantro in the puree. Much more authentic flavor, and boosts the intensity from "not bad" to "now THAT's what I'm talking about!"

easy enough. you could cheat a bit and just use creamed corn and use a potato masher at the end instead of playing the put it in the blender game ;-)

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I left out the potatoes entirely, and did not replace them with anything, and it has a wonderful fresh corn flavor. The blandness referenced by some other cooks may be due to the potatoes. The jalapeno and parsley puree is the perfect addition. I used 1/2 parsley and 1/2 cilantro instead of all parsley. Other than these small changes, I did not alter the recipe at all. I've made it twice now, and will make it again.

Lackluster chowder...but the outstandingly addictive parsley puree could brighten and add a new dimension to any chowder.

This recipe was great. I changed it a little bit. I did not use potatoes. I used a can of great Northern beans. Instead of the puree I used a tablespoon of canned jalapenos and a teaspoon of lime juice. I pureed these with about a cup or 2 of the chowder. My husband loved it.

I love this chowder! Don't skip or skimp on the jalapeno and parsley puree. It is very necessary and is an excellent accompaniment. The puree is so good and simple that I'm going to try to incorporate it into other recipes. Without it, this dish is just another simple corn chowder.

A hearty yet fairly light soup since I skipped all the oil and just added the roasted jalapenos, garlic and parsley to the soup. I used some leftover peameal (aka 'Canadian' bacon) instead of the ham. Next time I'll add more corn and less potatoes. It was quite spicy and we loved the roasted taste of the jalapenos. Served it with a spinach salad and toasted whole wheat organic pita bread.

the jalapeno/parsley sauce was WONDERFUL -- i use it in the Corn and Cheddar Chowder recipe from 2000. but i don't plan to make this soup again. too much potato, no creaminess, and incredibly bland. and i don't like the ham in lieu of bacon. the first corn chowder recipe i didn't enjoy, and i've tried several.

The puree makes this soup...I used parsley and cilantro. The puree also allows for people to add it according to their preference for hotness...a real plus when I made this for new neighbors and wasn't sure if they like spicy foods. I used an old ham bone I had in the freezer, less potatoes and added 1 c. heavy cream. Served with corn bread and salad...yum!!!

This was a wonderful recipe. I made a few changes that I think really added to the flavor. I used a tablespoon of chili powder, and two table spoons of fresh sage in the chowder. I also used vegetable broth (I'm vegetarian) and added a little bit of rice milk. Also I used 4 Jalapenos and 1 Habenero in the puree and substitued cilantro for parsley. Very tasty. Everyone loved it.

I used cilantro instead of parsley and fat-free half-n-half for most of the water. I think you could just spray your pan to cook the onion and celery instead of oil, in order to cut back on the fat. I think next time I would cut the potatoes and ham into slightly smaller pieces, just so you could get a little of both in a spoonful. The jalapeno sauce with cilantro is wonderful, I will make it again for topping chicken enchiladas.

I found this to be a pretty simple recipe. The taste was great, though I added one small chicken bullion cube to the mix. My wife, a real corn chowder lover, found the lack of cream noticable and disappointing. Next time, I might add a little to the soup puree, it might add some richness and improve the soup's appearence. Or I might recommend serving the soup with a small scoop of sour cream with the chili puree around it?

This was a bit work intensive but came out very nicely. I added some finely chopped red pepper to the top which complemented the yellow corn and green parsley puree. It also added a nice sweet/cold contrast to the spicy puree.

This was a hit at a work potluck. I made it vegan by omitting the meat & substituting vegetable broth. The jalapeno/parsley puree gives this dish some "kick!"

This is one of our favorite soup recipes -- it's delicious! We use cilantro instead of parsley when making the puree, though.
