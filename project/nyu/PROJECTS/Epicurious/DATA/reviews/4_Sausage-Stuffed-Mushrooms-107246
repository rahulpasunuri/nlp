Delicious. Will definitely make for more parties in the future. These were eaten so quickly by everyone that came over.

I used fresh finely chopped garlic sauteed with the sausage instead of garlic powder in the cream cheese mixture. I also cut out 1/3 the cream cheese(I don't like too much cream cheese). They turned out very nice.

These stuffed mushrooms are always a hit. I do not alter the recipe - use spicy hot italian sausage and follow the recipe as written. Been making these for parties since I was given the recipe by my daughter several years ago.

My absolute go-to recipe for stuffed mushrooms. Making them a day ahead is a great time-saver, and guests absolutely ADORE them.

Rating: 0
People LOVE these things! I accidentally purchased mild sausage, so I just added a little crushed red pepper. I made 5x the recipe (using smaller button mushrooms, yeilding 120-ish), so I wasn't exact in my measurements. I knew I couldn't do without the wine, but doing so many mushrooms at once, there was no way I could brush them all, so I put the wine in a spray bottle & generously sprayed the trays of mushrooms prior to filling. This recipe is very adaptable, as evidenced by all of the tweakings I've read in its reviews. I won't host a party without them!

Rating: 4
I'm finally able to rate this a 4 with a few modifications. Originally recipe needs a bit more zip to counter all the cheese, so I upped the hot sausages to 5 links and added a generous (very) pinch of red pepper flakes. I used large stuffing mushrooms and diced up the stems from 6 of the largest to saute with the stuffing. My dinner guests loved them...and they've tried the original recipe before that they liked, but they said this time they were finally the best ever. (We've got a stuffed mushroom competition going and I've finally taken the lead!)

Just made these last night for a "ladie's night in" party. They were delicious. Great alternative to shellfish stuffed mushrooms or bread stuffing. I don't usually alter recipes, especially on the first try, but I had wonderful breakfast sausage on hand from our local farm, so I used that instead of hot sausage. I also used pecorino romano cheese instead of parmigiana. So yummy! Very easy to make, too.

Rating: 4
I have made these many times according to the recipe and have yet to get a complaint, these are outstanding. I do have to admit I add all the cheese to the mix and pour the wine in the pan (1/4 cup or less). The wine & juices evaporate more or less. Very, very good.

Rating: 4
This is a GREAT party appetizer . .. you can make it in advance and pop in the oven just before your guests show up. I prepare just as the recipe says (with all of the cream cheese). I had forgotten the wine one time and it really does make a difference. An additional depth of flavor. I will chop up the mushroom stems and saute and add to the stuffing mixture!

These stuffed mushrooms are the best! I've made them a bunch of times and everyone goes junkie on them. I agree with others that cutting the cream cheese down to 6-7 ounces, using fresh garlic, and pre-roasting the caps for 10 minutes improves them, plus I have found that the flavours only get better the next day or even the day after that. It's a perfect do-way-ahead dish, (stuff the caps right before baking and forget about the wine - I've only ever remembered that step twice and it makes no difference), and if you drizzle the olive oil across the assembled caps instead of coating the dish, they are even better. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!

Great party appetizer b/c they can be made ahead and are very tasty. I made this for xmas & new years parties both following the recipe as is and modifying it. The modified version is much better: roast the mushrooms first (as others commented) to dewater them and reduce reheating time; use 1/2 the cream cheese; chop some parsley and add to the mix, to lighten them up; use fresh garlic (I used 3-4 cloves minced). I used large mushrooms from Costco.

I've made this a few times and although I thought they were good, I also found something lacking in the consistency of the stuffing. It was too much like oozing cream cheese with chunks of sausage in it. So, I decided to make the following changes: 1) Once the sausage was cooked, I minced it on a cutting board. 2) I decreased the amount of cream cheese by 1/4. 3) I increased the parmesan (I actually used italian blend shredded cheese) by 1/4. 4) I added 1/3 cup (or so) of bread crumbs. Overall, I thought it was much better and so did my test audience. I had read that some people thought the taste was one dimensional and these changes helped.

After reading some of the reviews, I felt I had to chime in. I have been making these since finding the recipe a few years back on this site. These are fantastic - if you follow the recipe. Do not attempt to "lighten" or substitute - they will not be the same. As for those who have commented that the recipe is missing something...it must be the type of sausage you're using. You need to use traditional hot Italian sausage - pork - not turkey or chicken. I live in WNY and our area produces outstanding Italian sausage. Perhaps that's the problem with some of the reviewers? Hope this helps.

Thought this good, and great for a cocktail app because they're easy to eat and serve. Next time I would probably cut down on the cream cheese, which I though detracted from the sausage and mushroom flavors without adding anything great.

Per the reviewers' suggestions, I cut the cream cheese down to five ounces and eliminated the egg yolk. Although I used all hot Italian sausage and fresh garlic, I still thought they lacked spice and interest. My guests and my husband liked them more than I did.

I always get rave reviews of these. I add a little extra cheddar cheese and a heavy dash of Tabasco. The browner you can get the sausage without burning it the better.

Very nice and easy recipe. I used two hot sausages and one sweet and then sauteed a chopped shallot and garlic clove in the sausage drippings - it seemed a shame to waste them. I also pre-cooked the mushrooms to remove excess moisture and put all the parmesan into the mixture at once. I put all the ingredients into the food processor and pulsed briefly, just to break up the sausage chunks and also to combine the ingredients more thoroughly. Don't overpulse though, keep it slightly chunky.

I made these years ago, and sadly forgot them until they showed up on buzz box. They are delicious, sort of like pizza in a mushroom.. I have all the ingredients on hand, and I am going to make these for New Years Eve.

These are the best stuffed mushrooms ever and I've been making them since 2005! The only changes to this recipe that I made included: using Jimmy Dean sausage instead of Italian hot sausage, eliminating the use of white wine, and lastly, increasing the amount of Parmesan cheese in the first paragraph of the recipe to 3/4 cups or more. I always get requests for this recipe and at parties, this is the first appetizer to go!

Fantastic, easy, and a huge hit at parties. As others recommend, I suggest roasting the mushrooms before stuffing -- I only roasted for five minutes, and the stuffed mushrooms were swimming in their juices when I pulled them out! I recommend 10-15 min pre-roast.

I was not wild about this recipe. I just made it, adding sauteed shallots and 2 cloves of garlic as recommended, and it's okay. I feel like it's missing something, but I'm not sure what.

These were fantastic at our Thanksgiving feast. They were equally well recieved at out friends holiday dinner, with whom I sent a tray. My amendments are as follows: I substituted a 12oz package of Jimmy Dean Sausage; I used Italian Herb Mix instead of mere oregano; I forgot the worcestershire and egg, but it did not seem to make a difference. I sauteed and added the finely minced mushroom stems, a shallot and a clove of garlic; I also stirred in some red pepper flakes and fresh, minced parsley. With my additions, this actually made enough filling for 5-6 dozen small-medium, bite-sized mushrooms. Perfect for a party or with drinks/wine.

This turned out well, however I must say i didnt follow the recipe completely and ommited alot. I used mild sausage, cream cheese, onions chopped and cooked and 2 cloves cooked garlic.

I made this tonight for a pot luck appetizer. Everyone enjoyed it. I used 2 clove garlic (cooked with sausage), only 3 ounces of fat free cream cheese, skipped the wine (just didn't have it on hand) and baked it on a rack with foil underneath to catch the drippings. I did not brush the pan with any oil, but think it would have been even better if I had at least brushed the mushroom caps with the olive oil before placing them on the rack. I did not use garlic powder (used fresh instead). I had to raise the temp twice to get it to finish nicely in 25 minutes. At the end the temperature was 400. I think I would just bake for 25 minutes at 400 next time.

These were excellent. I only had 7 medium sized mushrooms so I kind of eyeballed the amounts. Used mild bulk sausage. May add some red pepper to kick it up a bit, as others suggested. Froze the leftover sausage mixture for another time. Definitely a keeper

Tasty and different. Not the usual "bready" mushroom filling. These are elegant enough for a special occasion or holiday. Easy to assemble ahead of time. Will try pre-baking the mushrooms first next time as suggested by others since I did end up with a puddle of liquid in the baking pan. Will also try with some chorizo next time.

Excellent! I have been making this recipe for years and always get rave reviews! The sausage is the most important ingredient. I use fresh italian sausage from my local Italian market.

These were the BEST-EVER stuffed mushrooms we've ever made or had. Using sausage was new to me, it added such great flavor, the hot was a nice kick. They are sooo delicious and sooo unbelievably simple to make. We can't wait to make these again. My husband absolutely loved them & could not have enough. He ended up eating more mushrooms than our main course. I felt maybe there was a little too much cream cheese but my husband thought it was perfect as is. This will be my dish to bring for upcoming holiday parties. I know they will be a major hit.

I was so excited to try this recipe! I'm catering a small, late afternoon tea party and this will be the savory I serve. I tried the suggestion of using sun dried tomatoes. Thought it was good but my husband said it tastes too much like pizza. I plan to do one more test run following the exact recipe. Either way, I think this recipe is a keeper! Tip, I feel the white wine is essential to keeping the mushrooms moist. Pre-bake mushrooms for 10 minutes to help get the water out and then pat dry with paper towel before stuffing. You will have extra filling if you use small mushrooms. However, I think bite sized nibbles are a nicer presentation. I also garnish with chopped parsely. You could spend days trying different variations on this recipe and they would all be good!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe!! My girlfriend made them and everyone raved, so I had to get the raves too! I sure did. I followed someone else's suggestion in the reviews and I boiled the mushrooms which were large before doing so, they didn't make the stuffing as mushy. I tried a few too with the sun-dried tomatoes as suggested and do agree that even makes them better! Great recipe! I have used it already several times and even made when RVing with friends to serve with cocktails and they are so easy to do and again, a big hit! Thanks!

These were amazing! This will now become my stuffed mushroom staple. A few things changed based on other people's reviews: I used both medium sized button mushrooms and bella mushrooms to try out. I added a few drops of wine in the caps and let sit, and brushed over as well. I chopped up fresh garlic and the stems of both the button and bella mushrooms, and cooked with the sausage and oregano. I seasoned the meat with a little salt and pepper too. Also, 8 oz of cream cheese is a lot. I reduced to 6 oz, and maybe next time might reduce to 5. I also used more sausage than called for (used Jimmy Dean sausage). I also added chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil (a must!!! Just drained on paper towels to reduce oil). The freshly grated parmesean cheese made such a difference too. Very cheesy, so keep that in mind. My boyfriend absolutley loved them and wanted more. I am making more for a dinner party tonight (already prepped and ready to go!)

I thought the mushrooms were great and so did everyone else. I boiled the mushroom caps in water until they released their liquid (for a few minutes). They shrink in size, but then you don't have to worry about them making the stuffing mushy. I'll definitely make these again.

YUM... Taking modifications from many others, I omitted the egg, used low-fat cream cheese and decreased it to 6 oz., used fresh garlic instead of powder, and skipped the step of brushing the mushroom caps with wine. They came out great! (oh, and I don't like spicy food so I used sweet sausage - tasty!!)

I made these for our house-warming party and they were the first thing to disappear. I forgot to add the egg but apparently it wasn't missed. Grating the fresh parm was definitely the most time consuming part of this process. In the future I'd use the food processor for that because I think it tastes better than the pre-grated stuff. I used a couple of fresh garlic cloves instead of powder. I also ended up cooking them a bit longer than was suggested and broiled them at the end to brown the cheese. Oh, and I also forgot to add salt and pepper so I sprinkled on top...guess I was a bit forgetful with so many dishes to make. Overall these are pretty easy and I will be serving them again.

Fantastic recipe! Served it several times over the holidays and people keep asking for more. I am definitely going to try it with fresh garlic.

These are always a big hit--I make two batches, one with sausage, and one with soy burger meat, for vegetarians. I tend to cut down on the cream cheese and use more meat or faux meat, as well as real garlic. Instead of brushing the cups with wine I drop in a few drops of wine in each cap and let them sit a little while. Also have used the stuffing with jalapeno peppers--very hot! Never any left overs.

Actually, these are 3 & 1/2 forks...very yummy! We had 2 guests comment that these were the best mushrooms that they'd ever eaten! We used Andouille sausage and mixed the filling in a food processor.

As with many of the other 300+ reviews, I found this versatile recipe quite easy to do and very rewarding. I made a few changes as well - used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder; chopped up the stems and sauted them with the garlic, sausage and oregano; and eliminated the egg yolk. I also opted for a bit less cream cheese (6 oz) and used 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage. Most of these suggestions I stole from other reviews and it was worth it. These were a yummy treat that flew off the platter at a party last weekend. Rave reviews from everyone indeed!

I have made this before and EVERYONE loves them! The only thing that I changed is that I think stuffing mushrooms are too big, I like to eat my mushrooms in one pop because they're usually messy. I use white button, but just check the box over and make sure they're pretty big ones. Also, the first time I made them I found them sliding all over the dish so this time I put them in a mini muffin dish and it was great because I could pull them in and out of the fridge with ease and also they're weren't sliding when i pulled them out of the oven. I do not grease the muffin tin. This is a great make ahead recipe. I make the stuffing a couple days ahead and it's easier to stuff when it's cold.

I made this recipe for last year's Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit. Very easy to make since you can do them ahead of time. There is a lot of filling, so you can probably make more mushrooms than what the recipe indicates. Definitely will make this at the next party.

Fantastic Dish! Yum - would definitely make again! It was really simple and I was able to prep it ahead of time for a dinner party. I left out the white wine, used sweet sausage instead of hot and I slightly reduced the amount of cream cheese to about 6oz instead of the 8 just because I ran out. Everything still came out delicious - very forgiving recipe!

I made this recipe for a large reception (400 people) and it was great. I've played around with it a bit and found a few tidbits. 1. Mushrooms render alot of water when heated. When the water mixes with the filling, it can make the middle soggy. Now I prebake the mushrooms for a few minutes and pour off some of the liquid. I'm still working on an easier solution. 2. You really don't need the egg. the cream cheese binds everything together nicely. 3. Mixing sweet and hot sausage together gives just enough zing without making them too hot. 4. Mushrooms aren't meant to sit in a heated chafing dish for long. When I made these for the reception, they ended up sitting in chafing dishes longer than I anticipated. They still tasted good, but they definitely didn't look that great.

I prepared these in advance and brought to a friends house for dinner. Heated them then. They were excellent, but wow, rich. Wonder how they would be if I used less cream cheese or low fat? Of course, one could just eat less of them too! :)

After seeing this on constant comment/buzz box about a zillion times, I decided to make this for our Super Bowl party. I used mild chicken sausage and small mushrooms (to obviate the need for a knife and fork) and didn't add any white wine. This is a fabulous recipe. It's fast to throw together, can be made ahead (I made my filling & prepped my mushrooms the night before my party), and was enormously popular. The stuffed mushrooms would also make a nice lunch or dinner with salad or soup, but I wouldn't count on having any left over if you serve them for a party.

I used hot Italian sausage patties to cut down on prep time (no casings to remove). Also, used only about 1/3 package cream cheese (all I had on hand). They came out really well, but a tad greasy for me. Next time I'll try turkey sausage. Would make a very easy and impressive appy for almost any occaision. They reheat fine-even twice!

I thought these were only OK, but my guests RAVED over them. I made a couple of platters of them and within minutes there wasn't a bite left. I would definitely do them again.

I have made these for a Christmas party for 2 years now, and everyone loves them. For those who think that this is too rich, try cutting down on the amount of cream cheese you use. Just add enough so that the mixture holds together - this should decrease the "heaviness". I use about 1/3 to 1/2 of the cream cheese that is called for and omit the egg yolk and wine, and they are still awesome. It's nice that these can be assembled a day ahead, then cooked when needed. I liked the idea of a previous reviewer who sauteed the mushrooms, added to the sausage mixture, then put into phyllo cups - I might have to try this next time as a change!

Very yummy. Being a seasoned cook, I took a few short cuts and it still turned out fabulous! Everyone loved and asked for recipe. To save time, I cooked the sausage a couple of weeks in advance and froze. When preparing, I defrosted sausage, chopped in food processor along with cream cheese, worchester and egg yolk. Didn't bother with oregano, garlic or wine as I felt sausage had plenty of flavor. It was simple, fast, and yummy. I now leave precooked sausage in our freezer for a quick appetizer any day of the week. Hats off to the creator!!!

I made this recipe for a cocktail party - but with a twist.

Surprisingly easy and yummy. Served as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. They were a last-minute addition and therefore I didn't have all the ingredients.

These schrooms are awesome and always are the first thing to go at a party. A suggestion if you have leftover filling and don't want to make an omelette (or just eat it with a fork)! Slice a baguette, spread some of the mixture on top and pop it under the broiler for a few minutes. You now have a new appetizer recipe. Love this site...thanks to all you great reviewers for your helpful hints.

Wonderful! I made these for a party and they were the first things to go (and I made the recipe x4 for 35 people!) The recipe said to use 1 tbsp per mushroom and it did not fill as many as the recipe said, so I'm not sure why everyone else had extra filling, but they were delicious.

All my low-carb friends like this recipe because it doesn't have bread crumbs like typical stuffed mushrooms.

My family and I loved this recipe! I used the stuffing to stuff anahiem chiles as well and those were also great. So great they were preferred over the mushroom version.

I also made this recipe for a bunch of guys for a Pre-Preakness breakfast party. They loved them! Then when we got home after a few drinks they drug them out of the fridge and ate the leftovers cold. Its the first thing that came to their mind when we got home. I made a mistake and added the whole egg instead of just the yolk. I also used garlic salt instead of garlic powder but it was still good. Maybe using the whole egg made it more breakfast-like.

One of the best stuffed mushrooms recipies. It was too spicy for my taste because of hot sausage, so now i am just adding a mild sausage. It was a killer at my dinner party. I didn't have any stuffing left because i was eating as i was filling the mushrooms :)) It is a winner, and easy to make.

Waste not want not... I had a ton of filling left over (mushrooms small) - diced the mushroom stems and sauteed with olive oil and white wine, toasted 5 slices old bread & broke up and mixed it all together with leftover filling. Put in baking dish at 350 degrees for 1/2 hour covered with bread crumbs - sinful, decadent sausage mushroom casserole.

I have made these many times for parties and they are always a hit! Some suggestions.. use a potato masher to break up the meat as you cook it,drain the grease off the sausage on paper towels, the egg is not neccesary, and sometimes they need to be popped under the broiler for a minute to brown off the tops without overcooking them. Any leftover filling you might have is great piled on top of partially cooked yellow squash 1/2's and baked...Yum

NYC unless you are a vegetarian, you are a hypocrite. There is no difference between you at the butcher counter and the hunter other than facing reality (and the hunter's fresh meat doesn't have added hormones or antibiotics). The individual hunter's method of kill is, in fact, probably far more humane than the method used for the meat products destined for YOUR purchase at your local store.

I know this is a food site, but I'm really surprised that the woman whose husband is a "big game hunter" has not drawn the ire of the masses! So I'll start . . . You've married the type of person who can look down the site of his gun or bow, and knowingly take the life of a large, innocent animal -- and he enjoys it! Surely this is some sort of a psychological "red flag." We're not talking about stomping on a cockroach, or some other "pest", and it's certainly not a matter of survival. Evolution demands that the human species moves beyond these "primal" urges.

Very good. Made for an Oscar party and these should have won best dish but a damn party punch won instead! How does punch even qualify as a dish!?

I thought that these were much too greasy. I wish I had cut down on the cream cheese. When I pulled them out of the oven, the bottom of the pan had a pool of grease. Yuck! The filling was alright and people liked them, but there are much better stuffed mushrooms out there.

My husband is a big game hunter, so tried out this recipe with elk hot links.....they were the hit of the party! Will definitely make again! AND- they were all prepped and ready to go the night before, so all I had to do is the baking, pre-party! That's the kind of pre-party stress I like!

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious! I only used 3/4 of the cream cheese (lite) and it was fine. The cream cheese takes the edge off the spiciness of the sausage, so for a spicier filling make sure to get a sausage that will stand up to the cream cheese. I also chopped the stems - if you use "more than one bite" mushrooms you will need more filling, and the chopped stems help stretch it. Just make sure to adjust the filling for seasoning before stuffing the 'shrooms.

I think you should definitely use all the cream cheese...made it as a side dish for a big family dinner. I also used 2 garlic cloves as a few reviewers also did. The mushrooms definitely tasted even better the next day. Good stuff, rich, filling.

Hi Glasgow cook. I'm from Belfast but living in San Francisco. Pick any uncooked sausage you like, remove skins and cook accordingly. If I were at home I'd pick big fat Dennys Pork! Add some dried hot peppers if you like spicy and you probably should use less cream cheese. They are really very good. I've served them many times to (scots, irish and brits to rave reviews!

I will then brush the caps with the wine..That will definitely work. Just an idea...........

Delicious and so easy because the dish can be prepared ahead and just be put in the oven when your guests arrive. I used less cream cheese than indicated, plus it was a reduced fat cheese and everything was still perfect. I'm just thinking of a way to make the wine taste a little bit more pronounced. Definately something I'll make again, my guests were very pleased with their entrees!

This recipe was the hit of the cocktail party! One guest said they were the best stuffed mushrooms he has ever had. They are easy, and convenient since they can be prepared ahead of time. I made them exactly as written and would do so again.

Got rave reviews on this one. I cut back on the cream cheese, as other suggested, and noticed a difference. I would use the entire amount in the recipe. I used chicken sausage with sundried tomatoes & mushrooms and it was to die for. I also soaked the mushrooms in white wine. This was an awesome recipe

I agree with the comments and suggested posted by other reviewers. This recipe is worth trying and perfecting to your individual tastes. I've made it numerous times and it's always a hit- easy too!

Made this for- you guessed it- another superbowl party. (GO PATRIOTS!!).I would say that most people loved them while some others found them to be just ok. I doubled the recipe and followed many of the other suggestions. I used 2/3 hot sausage and 1/3 sweet. (would use all hot next time) Also used minced garlic and a bit of shallot with the sausage. Pulsed it in the food processor when cool to make pieces smaller. Agree less cream cheese is sufficient. Used smaller mushrooms and the melon baller works great on them. Great to be able to make ahead.

I don't really like Italian sausage so I used Andouille and it was GREAT. I also dropped 1 tsp white wine in the bottom of each shroom so it would soak it up when sitting in the fridge waiting to cook. That was a bit cleaner than marinating them.

Big hit at Super Bowl party! Used 1/2 fat-free and 1/2 Neufchatel creme cheese to cut calories. Would probably still be great with all fat free. I also sauteed some onion and chopped fresh spinach in the sausage pan for a little extra flavor in the filling. Mde soup with the stems. Don't think I'd try adding the stems to the mixture as others have suggested. You'd have a ton of extra filling, and probably too wet. Keeper!!

Brought these to a Superbowl party yesterday and they were scarfed down in 20 min.. Thank you other cooks--because you took the time to write I tried this recipe and have a keeper. The best part was I made them the night before. Also, I used turkey sausage otherwise followed the recipe.

fantastic! i made it once following the recipe closely -- using cremini mushrooms, 3 oz. cream cheese as suggested, and 3 oz. low-fat ricotta. i made it again with a different cheese altogether, cowgirl creamery mt. tam, loads of fresh tarragon, chicken apple sausage, and canned breadcrumbs to top. both times it turned out great.

Scrumptious! Used a combination of ideas from other reviewers: crumbled and browned one package of regular Jimmy Dean sausage and marinated the mushrooms in white wine while preparing the filling. A nice savory bite with a glass of wine while waiting on a vegetable quiche to bake. Endless possibilities!

Made this "just for us" as the main dish along with a simple orange and spinach salad with blue cheese vinegarette. Lovely! And recipe will be used for guests. But recent review about using lamb sausage has me intrigued: where the heck might I find it? It sounds like it would be wonderful with this recipe.

My husband and I loved these mushrooms. I used lamb sausage, and added extra mushrooms to the stuffing mixture. I zapped the stuffing mix in my cuisinart, which made it very fine and easy to work with. I mixed bread crumbs, melted butter and parmensan for the tops. It masde them yummy and crispy. Next time we'll make them for company.

I made these for a New Years Eve cocktail party and they were gone within 10 minutes of putting them out on the table. We were leaving for a ski vacation the next day and our cocktail party guests threatened to break into our house to search for leftover stuffed mushrooms. Lucky for us, there were none left over! Very easy to make and yummy! Great combination.

Rating: 4
I agree, these are excellent. Used a melon baller to remove stem & hollow out each mushroom. Briefly soaked them in wine. Substituted fresh oregano and fresh garlic chopped. Added finely chopped shallot. Bought a high quality Hot Italian sausage. Delicious but very spicey; would definitely use 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet Italian sausage next time. Cut back a little on the cream cheese also, but I'm sure that using the entire recommended 8 oz. would be fine. Love all the helpful tips from devoted Epicurous fans. thanks.

Made this dish for a party last night. Everyone loved it and asked if I was hiding any more out in the car... they were all devoured within about 5 minutes! Just a note about cooking; they give oof a lot of liquid and needed to be drained prior to serving. I put them into another casserole dish and reheated them for about 10 minutes just before serving.

Excellent! Got raves at a party and was the first appetizer gone (and in a flash!I'll know next time to bring at least a triple batch) Took the advice of previous reviewers and marinated the mushrooms in the white wine; used a melon baller to scoop out the tops and a cookie scoop to fill them w/ the sausage filling. Also used half sweet/half hot Italian sausage. Definitely a keeper recipe. (BTW...expect a LOT of liquid from the mushrooms while baking; I just suctioned it out w/ a baster in the middle of the baking time and after they came out of the oven)

Rating: 3
These were rich and delicious. I did not have garlic powder, so I sauted a minced onion and garlic, added two hot Italian sausages and one sweet Italian sausage, then proceeded with the filling recipe as written. I took the advice of the reviewer from Sammamish,WA and chopped the cooked sausage much finer so it was easier to work with. Because these were for a cocktail party I also took the advice of other reviewers and used 1" crimini and white button mushrooms (which made closer to 45 or 50) so they were easier to manage. Next time I will add a bit more oregano and a splash of wine in the filling. This was definitely an easy and lovely recipe, I will certainly make it again.

Good recipe. Not very hard and everyone (who likes mushrooms) loved it

These were a big hit at our New Year's Eve party. The cream cheese really mellows the hot sausage. I soaked the inside of the caps in white wine for five minutes like a previous reviewer suggested but that was the only change from the recipe. Excellent recipe, will use again and again!

Rating: 4
Wonderful! A big hit at my party last night. I don't think the egg adds much to this recipe. Next time I'll omit it. The cream cheese binds the meat sufficiently. Also, I will use smaller mushrooms next time. These are great for popping in your mouth in one bite.

Rating: 3
We loved these. I would use 50/50 hot and sweet sausage. I removed the cooked sausage from the pan and chopped it much finer before mixing it with the other ingredients so it's not so bulky going into the mush cap.

Excellent recipe. I found I had extra filling and needed a few more mushroom caps. I would consider reducing the amount of cream cheese a bit, maybe to 6oz as one reviewer has already suggested.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent appetizer for a party. Be sure and look through the reviews. I generally make this by using about 3/4 lb. hot sausage and 1/4 lb. sweet sausage per recipe -- but about 6 oz. light cream cheese instead of a full 8-oz. package. This doubles very well. I start off by melon balling the caps (use 1" size -- these are easier to eat when bite size!)and letting them marinate in the wine -- it's easier than brushing it on and the wine adds a nice flavor. When sauteeing the sausage, I add 2-3 cloves minced garlic, some finely chopped onion, and add dried tarragon. I also use closer to one cup Parm for the filling, and add some of the wine also. Great to prepare ahead as indicated in the recipe, but bring the dish to room temp before baking. Prepare for lots of compliments!!

These mushrooms are delicious! We ran out of Parmesan cheese so we didn't have any for the tops but they still turned out well. The tops of mine were just a little bit crunchy. I didn't cook them with the olive oil, just on parchment paper on a cookie sheet with sides. I also drained the sausage on paper towels to get rid of some of the grease. The mushrooms were the first thing to disappear from the table. They were even delicious at room temperature. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my regular cocktail party rotation!

Rating: 4
Ohhhh...YUMMY! The only thing I didn't do was to coat the insides of the mushrooms with the white wine. I did, however, add just a splash to the mixture just prior to stuffing. My only tiny, tiny complaint is: these weren't, of course, slightly crunchy on the tops....fairly soft and mushy. But the flavors are awesome!

Rating: 4
Another big hit with the holiday guests. I doubled the sausage and spices to make it meatier and added some wine to the mixture as well as to the mushroom caps. Easy to make and generates applause.

Excellent and a real crowd pleaser. Instead of brushing the mushroom caps with wine, try pouring wine into each cap and leaving for about 5 minutes. Don't be afraid of the hot sausage -- the cream cheese tempers it so it has just the right zip.

Excellent hors d'oeuvre for company! Impressive looking, simple to make and can be prepared in advance. Everyone loved them, said they were the best stuffed mushrooms they'd tasted.

Made these tonight for company. They RAVED about these! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT- I omitted the egg yolk and the dry white wine. I did not miss either of these. Truly fantastic. They quality of the sausage is important. Use a good one. *Also, save yourself some clean up. There is no need to use a bowl to blend the ingredients. After the cooked sausage has cooled, just add the other ingredients into the same pan, mix together and then stuff the mushrooms.

I gave this recipe 3 forks because my guests loved it but I thought it was just so-so. It was missing depth... something to pull it together, I just tasted the ingredients separately not as a whole.

AND definitely take all the other reviewers suggestions, crucial.

This is a great dish! It is key to use the best sausage that you can find. (I buy mine at an Italian meat market.) It makes all the difference. Also, besides just stemming the mushrooms, you can scrape out the sides and bottoms to allow for extra filling. (I always had extra filling left over!) I've made this many times and always get rave reviews.

This is a great recipe to cut in half--if you just want to make a few. I agree with the reviewer who said the wine isn't needed. I included it and found the mushrooms getting a little watery in the oven. The wine imparts a nice flavor, but I think I'll omit it next time I make them.

I made this for our dinner club, everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again. I would agree that it would be better to make it with small mushrooms so you can just pop them in your mouth. They are a bit gooey and require a plate and fork if you need to take more than one bite. Also, since our store does not sell Italian sausage in links (it comes in a rope), I had to guess how much sausage the recipe called for. I used about 10 oz, and this seemed about right.

How can you go wrong w/ sausage and mushrooms? I made these last weekend for a small dinner party; one guest just "happened" to be standing at my kitchen counter while I was transferring them to a serving platter and he literally ate 4 in less than a minute! Needless to say, they went over very well and every guest asked for the recipe. The only thing I did differently was instead of brushing the caps, I just poured 1/2 cup white wine over the mushrooms and let them marinate while I cooked the sausage and combined the filling. After assembling, I spooned the wine that was still in the bowl over the mushrooms, then baked as directed. These were the tastiest little 'shrooms ever!

More like a 1.5 fork recipe. I doubled this and made them for a Christmas party...I wasn't very impressed and wouldn't make them again, but all the guests loved them. Or maybe they were just being nice. I have had much better stuffed mushrooms.

Great Recipe. I would sautee the mushrooms in some olive oil for a few minutes first, and then bake them for only half the suggested time. I also added some pesto and 4 ounces of jack cheese to the filling mixture.

These were the WORST mushrooms that I've ever had. My husband took a bite of one and threw the rest away. They were so bad, I didn't even put them out for the guests.

This recipe was a huge hit at a recent holiday party. Also got rave reviews at home for Christmas dinner appetizer.

This was a hit... The only thing I would change is to reduce the cream cheese. I cut down on it a bit, and it still seemed like too much. Oh, I also skipped the white wine step and brushed the mushrooms with olive oil instead. I can't answer the other "cook's" question about how much sausage to use, but I can say that the sausages I used were about 4 inches long, 1 inch diameter. It was the only size Italian sausage that I saw available at the grocery store. It turned out to be the perfect amount.

The mushrooms were gone in about five minutes. Excellent recipe. I had a little extra filling, so I used it as a dip for tortilla chips. It is very rich and a little greasy. Perfect for parties. I will make this again at my next party!

What a great recipe. I substituted sweet sausage for the hot and the results were terrific. Very rich but great combination. Easy to make ahead and just pop in the oven when guests arrive. Many commented they were the best stuffed mushrooms they had ever eaten. A keeper!

Fabulous! Not your usual greasy sausage stuffed mushrooms. I have always done crab stuffed mushrooms instead to try to keep things more elegant. Threw these on the menu for a cocktail party at the last minute because they were so easy and could be made ahead. Everyone loved them - especially the men. Even a friend who is a gourmet chef kept going back for more and asked for the recipe! These will be a menu staple from now on.

This is one of the most delicious appetizers I have ever made! Everyone at my party raved! It's also nice that you can make them a day ahead. We used a little less cream cheese and they were delicious.

Very Very Good! All the adults loved these. The kids didn't care for them - too much flavor for them!

Made this recipe for three different Christmas parties - all to raving reviews. (My ONLY change was to sub a tube of Jimmy Dean's regular sausage and a tube of the JD's Hot sausage - for a double recipe). The first time I made these was for my wife's staff party for 14 people. My wife came into the kitchen, collapsed against the counter and procaimed, "Those stuffed mushrooms, oh my gosh, they're fantastic!" Not too much later a guest rushed in yelling, "Those mushrooms ROCK!" My brother-in-law at Christmas hates stuffed mushrooms and devoured 4 of them. Needless to say, this recipe works.

We made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving... one guest, who doesn't even like mushrooms and had one to be polite (and then started wolfing them down) has been pestering his wife to get the recipe pretty much constantly since then. This is a definite keeper!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were easy and had excellent flavor. I used Seet italian Turkey sausage because I had it on hand. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to 'kick it up' a little. I did not do the olive oil and white step and they turned out great.

I made this recipe for an early Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. I'm going to make them again next week for our second Thanksgiving dinner.

This will be my second year hosting Thanksgiving, and I wanted to try some appetizer recipes before I make them for guests. This was delicious! I only gave it three forks because it is quite fattening, but it will be perfect for Thanksgiving.
