This was extraordinarily good... Far tastier than I had imagined, and more elegant. After reading many baked pain perdu recipes where reviewers weren't certain the custard would set, I was worried, but I was greeted with cheesy, puffy, perfectly crunchy goodness on my plate! I added minced garlic to the vinaigrette, mostly because I was half-awake and on auto-pilot. This is my new favorite brunch dish, and it may well become my new favorite midnight snack too!

True to the recipe name, this is a very savory brunch entree. Bland? No way, provided you use a high quality baguette, parmesan, olive oil and red wine vinegar. Didn't need to add or modify a thing.

I've made this many times--it's a go-to recipe when we have some baguette left over. Very simple to make, and feels pretty light. I do agree that using whole milk and being generous with the salt and pepper is important to making the pain perdu flavorful.

Hey, this was good! I cheated a little and melted a pat of butter and a chiffonade of 2 basil leaves in a small saucepan over very low heat, killed the flame, added the milk and gradually whisked in all the parm. Followed recipe from there and turned out great. Lots of flavor from top to bottom. Looked sexy too!

Delicious and very simple. The pain perdu was very flavorful and tasty: just use good parm! I might add tomatoes to the greens next time.

Some have complained about blandness of the pain perdu. :( If, however, you buy a nice piece of parmesan (and I don't mean Kraft shredded junk in a green tube) you will find the dish to be very satisfactory. Pop for the real thing with cheese, be generous with pepper, and this dish will blow your socks off. I steamed some asparagus to lay on top of the salad which went over well. Asparagus seems to go with eggs, cheese, and all these things. I served it cold as part of the herb salad and, I think, it was a very nice addition to make the brunch a little more robust. It's an option.

It had great promise but we were disappointed with the pain perdu; it was bland and not worth the effort.

This was very nice as a light dinner, but I wouldn't try to make it low-fat. I omitted the butter and went light on the Parmesan, and my pain perdu pieces were a little lacking in flavor. The texture, however, was wonderful, and I am never again going to make french toast in a skillet. Also, the egginess of the pain perdu with the egginess of the egg might have been a bit much together. This was a nice change from my usual dinners, though.

I used a nice organic multi-grain bread instead of a baguette, and the result was excellent. I also added tomatoes, red peppers and some nice cheese to the salad, but otherwise I didn't vary anything else. This was a really nice, simple supper. We really enjoyed it.

We enjoyed this. I think the key is a strongly flavored Parmesan.

A little weird, but my husband LOVED it. Quick, easy, mostly do-able with ingredients on hand. Will definitely be making again.

Delicious! I used sourdough bread and it turned out very tasty!

Quick and very good, I added chopped raw asparagus to mine. I used a rather stale baguette so I let it soak in the custard overnight in the fridge. Popped in the oven this morning and it was perfect! Great for dinner or brunch.
