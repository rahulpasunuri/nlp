Excellent, simple dish. Try a little flour on the chicken before sauting as it thickens the sauce. Also -- we sprinkled a rosemary lemon and parsley gremolata on top. WOW! Reall delicious.

Okay, folks, this one's pretty basic. You can pretty much eyeball the ingredients and decide what you want to add more of or cut down on (or substitute) based on your personal tastes. If you don't like this one, you might as well avoid any recipe that contains the word "Provencal".

The ingredients in this dish are a classic Mediterranean combination - if you like tomatoes, olives and garlic it's a no brainer....HOWEVER, I altered the amouns of each ingredient to my liking. Used boneless, skinless breast of chicken (two breasts,) half an onion, 5-6 cloves of garlic, approx. 2 T. of parsley and about a dozen Kalamata olives. Also used a non-stick pan and a bit less olive oil for browning. The result was delicious. Served it with sauteed zucchini (great combo) and oven roasted potatoes. If you chop up the chicken and increase the amounts of other ingredients it would be great over pasta.

It was deliciously simple, though I used less oil and more wine and green olives.

I added capers and more garlic and loved it. Easy to make. Good w/ wild rice.

Prepared this without the olives and with canned whole tomatoes, and still thought it to be quite tasty.

I too found it very boring. This needs at least some mixed herbs and about three times as much parsley and garlic. But even then it will probably remain boring so I will not make this again.

I thought that, while this recipe was easy to prepare and sounded good, it really wasn't worth the effort. The flavors didn't come together as I expected and it was terribly boring - chicken with tomatoes and that's about it.

Tried this dish this week....DELICIOUS. Anticipate serving it to French friends. Easy, VERY flavorful (although I did add Herbs de Provence to chicken along with the salt and pepper I thought it needed just a bit more spice.) Just delicious.

Made this dish a couple of months ago and realized I forgot to write about how flavorful it was! I am looking forward to making it again tonight. very quick, easy, and delicious.

This was wonderful and so quick to prepare! I didn't have a cast-iron skillet, so I fried the chicken in batches in a dutch oven, then fried the onion in the drippings, and then added the chicken back to the pot. I also added chopped fresh thyme with the parsley, and left out the olives. The chicken was moist and flavorful and I couldn't get enough of the sauce! A perfect, quick dinner.

This recipe was easy, but I was disappointed in the flavor. My husband liked it, but not enough to make it again.

Just left the table after making this simple yet delicious dish. I will certainly give this a repeat appearance for dinner soon.
