Made these twice now - once with last summer's harvest, now again this summer. I made changes based on reviews this year and they were far far better, much more crisp - I'd recommend either skipping the step where you process batches of the zucchs in the brine and simply dump the hot brine over before processing in the water bath, or do the batches in the brine, then cover with the hot brine and refrigerate. The hot brine plus processing will make these too soft with that much heat.

Great recipe for those excess summer Zucchini! I made exactly as written except for these two very small adaptations: #1. I used a pinch of 'Tumeric' instead of the saffron,which also gives a 'yellow color'. #2. Just like another reviewer who reviewd this recipe, I made 'Refridgerator Pickles' instead of canning/jarring these. I found the flavor of these excellent, and the texture of them came out much like store bought 'bread & butter pickles', a little on the softer side but still with a bit of snap. I will be making these again & again!

Made these last summer, making them again this summer. Delicious pickles, nice balance of seasonings, although a bit spicy for most kids. My pickles did come out a bit on the softer side. Thinking about trying Pickle Crisp to see if that makes them crispy next time.

This is the second time I have ever pickled anything, so these not turning out so good may be my fault. I was expecting them to taste similar to spicy dill pickles; mine turned out mushy, gross, and far too sweet. If I were to make these again, I would definitely reduce the sugar by half. Also, 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads: is that 1/4 teaspoon packed or just an approximate amount? I used 1/4 packed, so this may have also contributed to the flavors being off.

These are good, I was skeptical that wouldn't be crunchy but the brine really kept them firm. The flavors are unfamilar to me, exotic almost for a pickle. Also I kept to the recipe and only added 2-3 strands of saffron per jar, you don't need more, you can taste it but it's not overpowering. Oh and I made them refrigerator style which may be why they are crunchy, not sure. I did not do the water bath, just capped them and put into the fridge.

Love, love, love these! Perfectly spicy. Trying to make more before the zucchini runs out!

Yum! Made these as written, except with summer squash. The saffron is key! It colors the pickles a beautiful soft yellow, and adds its singular perfume that is surprisingly not overwhelmed by the vinegar and dill. Will make again when I have more squash/zucchini.
