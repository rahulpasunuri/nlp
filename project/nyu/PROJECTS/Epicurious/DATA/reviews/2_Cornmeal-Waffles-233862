Wish I read the reviews and User Rating before making this. It was absolutely bland, and I have no intention of making it again. I prefer to be pleasant about the situation despite my great disappoint. This recipe is not for me.

This recipe had potential but it seemed to need more sugar and less baking soda. Being able to taste the baking soda is generally not a good thing.
