I made this for my husband on Father's Day. Absolutely delicious! He said it was the best omelet he ever had and I agree. I used 4 eggs and we shared it. It makes a very filling breakfast. I love omelets, but wanted a different idea and this was perfect.

Giant is definitely a good description for this omelette. Easily a hearty brunch for two. I also added a couple of Serrano peppers in with the bell peppers and mushrooms to spice it up a bit. The tomatillo sauce is very important so make sure you don't skimp on it.

Excellent! May be a little too heavy for breakfast, so I made it for dinner. Perfect!

I tweaked this a little based on what I had on-hand (a leek, some spinach) and turned it into a fritatta, but it was quick and easy. Great with a side of chipotle potatoes.
