An excellent dish to stretch out a little sausage. I fried everything in lard & quartered grape tomatoes.

I made this exactly as written, even with real breakfast sausage ("Tennessee Pride"), and I was not sorry---it was savory and delicious. Each patty has a lot of bean in it compared to the sausage, so it doesn't come out terribly fatty, as I had feared. Lots of protein in this recipe too, between the eggs, bean and meat.

I used a soy breakfast sausage roll because I just couldn't, in good conscience, buy the fatty regular breakfast sausage. In a grocery store, you can find it typically near produce areas oddly enough - it's not with the other breakfast sausages. It worked well and this recipe is a really healthy, tasty, fun twist on breakfast that was worth it.

I am a celiac and am always looking for new breakfast dishes. I used turkey sausage links instead of a regular sausage roll. The patties were not as firm as I would have thought but it was tasty and different.

I made this yesterday with a few substitutions since I didn't have green taco sauce and we're vegetarians. We used the morningstar sausage in place of the regular meat and added the cilantro to regular salsa. Everyone really liked them as something different for breakfast my toddler ate the entire patty. We did add a tiny bit of cheese too on top of the patty. They were super easy, quick and healthy which is always good too.
