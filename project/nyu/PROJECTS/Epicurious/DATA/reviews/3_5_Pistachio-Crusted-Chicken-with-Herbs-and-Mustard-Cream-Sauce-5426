We always enjoy this dish. Usually with a small pasta or mashed potatoes to take advantage of the sauce. I usually add a drizzle of honey to the mustard/herb slather and let the crusted chiken sit on a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes to help the crust "set" before cooking. Do watch the heat of the skillet as it doesn't take much to burn the nuts and then you have to start over. Love a bitter green veg on the side. mmm

We've made this recipe a couple of times and just absolutely love it. We followed the directions, but took some of the other reviewers advice. We pounded the chicken to make it faster and easier to cook. Next time we'll try skipping the pan frying and just using the oven to make it a little healthier. The sauce is delicious (I love mustard and cream!!!) and went great over the red potato mash that I made to go with it!

I read the reviews and came up with this alternative: First I pounded the chicken breasts so they were all consistently about 1/2" thick. I mixed 2 Tbl. mustard in with 1/3 cup mayonnaise and all the herbs. I slathered a thin layer of that mixture onto both sides of the pounded chicken breasts and rolled them in the pistachio/panko crumb mixture. NO FRYING! I baked them on a baking pan sprayed with PAM at 4oo degrees for about 20 minutes, or until browned. Delicious and less fat.

This recipe certainly had mixed reviews but I made it anyway. And I'm glad I did!! After reading all the other reviewer's modifications I pounded my chicken breasts, cut each into two pieces and spread the mustard/herb mixture on the top. Coated both sides with the nut/crumb mixture and baked at 350 for 25 minutes on a sheet sprayed with PAM. I had enough crumbs and mustard mixture for 4 breasts which equaled 8 or 9 pieces after I cut them. This worked beautifully. Didn't lose any of the coating and didn't have to deal with pan frying. The sauce was divine, but I love mustard. I agree the individual herb flavors got lost a little bit but I figured they all worked together to make this an outstanding dish. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. Will make again, and again, and again!

not a fan of this one. i really liked the pistachio flavor, but found it to be overwhelmed by the mustard. i also didn't find much point to the herbs. i'll give it another try, but this time probably won't stick the chicken in mustard before putting the panko/pistachio coating on...i'll find some sort of adhesive substitute.

Really enjoyed this pistachio crust. The mustard-y flavor was also excellent. The herbs didn't seem that important. The cream sauce was excellent over pasta, and even better the next day.

Rating: 4
really delicious recipe. you can very clearly taste the pistachio and mustard. you do end up with WAY too much pistachio/breadcrumb mix, as others have mentioned, so feel free to scale back. i could not really taste the basil or dill, so i may drop next time.

Rating: 2
I thought the mustard was too overwhelming. I used macadamia nuts instead of the pistachios and used a pesto basil paste instead of the fresh basil, dill and rosemary. I also finished the cooking on the stove instead of using the oven and the chicken came out very moist. If I make again I would seriously cut back on the mustard on both the chicken and the sauce.

this recipe turned out marvelously even though it was my first time and i used dried rosemary and dill. everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
With fresh dill, rosemary and basil from the garden we were looking at 7 forks. As usual more sauce was called for. 3 big breasts made 6 servings. I just fried up the extra nuts and crumbs and put them on top. I served this with rice - maybe that's why I needed more of the yummy sauce.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite chicken recipes. Instead of cooking and baking, I just coated my baking dish with olive oil and baked in the oven for 25 minutes using chicken strips instead of the whole breast. I also made the cream sauce low fat by using plain fat free yogurt instead of whipping cream.

Rating: 3
Have made this many times and everyone always loves it. Shelled the nuts the first time, not worth it, now I just have a good supply of already shelled nuts in the pantry. The combination of flavors is one of my favorites.

Rating: 3
I was disappointed in the result for the amount of effort. I might make again with shelled pistachios, but won't spend 20 minutes shelling pistachios for this again. FYI - For those of you ambitious enough to try this, I only started with 1/2 c pistachios and had a lot left over.

Rating: 3
A flavorful, tasty dish. A little time consuming (buying shelled pistachios would have helped), but well worth the effort. Took the suggestion of cooking the breasts for 25 min at 350, then broiling for a few minutes, but otherwise would not change a thing - tasted terrific and not a nut lost in the process. The combination of flavors was wonderful. My guests raved and cleared their plates!

On paper I thought this looked fabulous, but like other reviewers I also thought there were too many competing flavors. There's a simpler mustard chicken recipe on this site that results in a purer, just more tasty dish. The cream sauce, however, is very good.

A wonderful and flavorful chicken dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Took some time but well worth it. Rounded it out with some sauteed spinach.

Yum! Made exactly as written and served over mashed potatoes - it was wonderful. Very rich sauce however, so next time I may experiment with lightening it so this isn't a "special occasions only" dish.

Rating: 4
The sauce is very rich and delicious. Cooking the chicken requires a lot of attention in order to nicely brown the crust rather than burn the pistachios. But if you do it right, the combination is wonderful!

Rating: 1
Well, the chicken was moist and flavorful however, the dish on a whole (including sauce) is too much work for such little reward. Also, DO NOT double the cream sauce unless you want to drown your chicken -- all it needs is a slight drizzle of the sauce. I doubled it not realizing what I was doing and I had cream sauce for the next week.

This is a very impressive recipe. I used crushed walnuts in place of the pistachios. Nice flavor!! Yummy!!

Rating: 3
Very good and pretty simple too. I skipped the pistachios as I needed something good and fast for a special dinner. This recipe works although I note that cooking the chicken at a medium heat took much longer than the recipe says. I yanked it up and was pleased with results. Gee you cannot go wrong with Panko. I also cut down on the herbs and just used a good amount of dried sage and everyone raved.

I don't understand all the good reviews for this receipe. When I tried dipping the chicken with the mustard mixture into the nuts mixture, most of the coating just falls off as I'm handling it. More falls off while I'm trying to fry it. Then after 7 minutes of baking, the meat is still raw on the inside. I baked another 10 minutes at 400 deg, it is still raw. Meanwhile, more nuts mixture is falling off when I try to cut the chicken to see if its done. Not to mention the mustard sauce that goes over the chicken tastes aweful. The whole thing was a disaster.

We LOVED this recipe!! We doubled the mustard-cream sauce (extremely good) and used a portion to brush on the ckicken breasts. We baked the chicken at 350 for approx 25 mins and then broiled the breasts for a few minutes to avoid having to pan fry the breasts. They were so moist, that you could cut them with a butter knife (even a dull one.) We sliced chicken breast and served on Jasmine rice and covered with mustard sauce. Incredible! We made my fav salad --> vinagr = 4 T raspberry vinegar, 4 T sugar, blend until sugar dissolves then add 1/2 cup oil (while blending.) Candied pecans = 1 1/2 t melted butter + 2 T honey + 1/8 t salt + 1/8 to 1/4 cayenne. Mix in 1 cup pecans. Bake on cookie sheet covered with sprayed parchment at 325 for 7 - 12 minutes (check them so they don't burn.) Sliced Granny Smith's, Blue Cheese, and Italian blend salad that you can buy in the bag --> mix all but dressing together for a wonderful salad.

My husband who hates to have chicken (because he had it so much as a kid) LOVED this recipe. In fact, we are having it this weekend for company. Very impressive!

Rating: 4
I thought the recipe was absolutely delicious. I found the chicken to be extremely moist and full of flavor. Contrary to the other reviewers, I loved the chicken without the mustard sauce. I think the recipe stands on its own without it. I also prepped the chicken ahead of time which worked out great.

Rating: 2
Followed the recipe as per instructions and made sure I didn't burn the chicken as per other reviewers notes. However, I felt this was missing some garlic, onions or chilli, it seemed to miss something to give it a bit of a zing. No one in the family thought it was worth trying again, so as easy as it was I won't be making it again any time soon.

Rating: 4
Very flavorful - definitely double the Mustard Cream Sauce recipe. We served on a bed of fresh pasta...very good. Be sure to watch the chicken in the skillet as the pistachios burn easily.

This was dish was wonderful. The flavors blended very well together and each bite was better than the last! We followed the recipe exactly, except we doubled the mustard cream sauce (as suggested) and we're so glad we did. It truly makes this dish "come together." Great with a dry white wine! Enjoy.

This recipe was great! And you could put a straw into the mustard sauce, it was so very good!!! I made the recipe exactly as it was written, and would not change a thing except make more of it next time. I did double the sauce as was suggested by others on this site and used every last drop. People were stuffed and begging for more sauce! Definitly be sure to make lots of sauce and enjoy!!

This is a winner in my family. I have made this dish 3 times already. The mustard cream sauce is a must. I serve it with rice pilaf and a recipe on this site--green beans with shitake mushrooms which are out of this world.

This is an excellent dish. Sophisticated ingredients make this appropiate for eating with company. Clearly not an everyday dish, so don't worry about the cream content. This is a dish for enjoying, not dieting. Serve with rice, so that guest can savor the remaining cream sauce with it, an crispy asparagus, for a lighter vegetable choice.

I have am enjoying the low carb lifestyle. This recipe was easily adapted. I omitted the bread crumbs, substituted a few pork rinds. I wasn't worried about the cream! This is a keeper.

This was very tasty. I couldn't find panko, so I used regular bread crumbs, which seemed to work just fine. As I was cooking for 5, I made the following adjustments: used same amount of pistachio/bread crumb mix, doubled the mustard/herb sauce you roll the chicken in, and doubled the cream sauce. I wound up having way too much cream sauce. In any case, was very tasty and pretty presentation. Good meal for company.

This dish really deserves more than 2 forks. After reading all the rave reviews I was excited to make it, but we were disappointed with the sauce. Many reviewers shared their ways to make the sauce lower-fat. I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 half n half. The resulting sauce was a strange tinny tasting, lumpy mess. I was upset. But! The chicken was awesome. I will certainly make the chicken again, although not the sauce. I can't bring myself to use that much cream. Served with the lime, basil and potatoes recipe also on this site (DELICIOUS) and asparagus.

this is a stunning dish full of flavour it may be rich but it was fantastic, i followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was splendid the naxt time i took one of the hints and used much less herbs but i found it was great with them and the sauce i added a little white wine to dilute it and it was great

I prepared this for my family and they thought that is was a "special person" meal. After reading other preparers' comments I modified the sauce by using Light cream and further diluting the sauce with 1/2 cup of chicken stock. This was a delicious recipe that the my Mom wanted the recipe for.--If Mom likes it that makes it all worth it.

This was great, I used regular plain bread crumbs instead of panko and instead of putting them in the pan with oil, I spread Pam on them and stuck them in the oven and then at the end I put them under the broiler to get a little crispy. I also left out the herbs as I wanted to taste more of the pistachio flavor, my favorite. The way I made it was a little more of a lower fat recipe. Great dish, my hubby loved it.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful dish! I forgot the fresh dill at the store so doubled the basil & rosemary and it was still great. The breadcrumb mixture made enough to generously coat 6 pieces of chicken. I served it over rice with the sauce drizzled over. It was a hit.

Absolutely delicious! I used regular bread crumbs and it worked out well. The sauce is a bit thick if you reduce the cream by half (it almost has a tartar sauce flavor and texture that way), so next time I'm going to use half and half.

I made this dish for ten people one evening with about two hours notice. It's super easy and impressive with this twist: Pound the chicken flat and cut it into medallion shaped pieces before coating it with the pistachio mix. Then make the Spicy garlic potatoes and zucchini (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105423) and serve the chicken like the photo from http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105414 It's absolutely a knock-out combination. I also made a couple pieces of salmon for the vegetarians in the group and presented it the same way. Rave reviews!!!

My boyfriend and I made this dish and we both loved it. The trick is to keep stirring the cream sauce. But the onions boiled in white wine is SO delicious--gives it a distinct bite. The only downside is the fat factor--there's A LOT of cream in this dish

I made this dish for my boyfriend Sean and he never put his fork down!! Instead of pistachios, I used chopped pecans as well as regular breadcrumbs. The sauce was delicious and could be used with pork, lamb and even certain fish. Use part whipping cream and part half-n-half to cut down on the fat.

Loved this! Have made it twice, both times without the dill, doesn't need it. Does need panko instead of regular breadcrumbs. Second time, used hazelnuts instead of pistachios, and substituted Land O' Lakes Fat Free Half and Half in the sauce, and used olive oil spray for chicken and baked it all the way, worked great, still had all the flavors.

This recipe is fantastic!! We added one beaten egg (with a little milk) to the mustard sauce. This made it easier to apply the nut mixture (and the pistachio coating turned out nice and crispy. An alternate suggestion...for a low calorie version, skip the frying pan and simply bake the chicken. We used 18% cream (instead of whipping cream) and it worked just fine. Goes well with asparagus. Highly recommend this dish if you wish to impress.

OUTSTANDING TASTE!! CHICKEN WAS VERY MOIST

I have made this about 4 times now. I agree with the comment to leave the dill out, it just takes your tastebuds in another direction. Double the items for the mustard to be put on the chicken. I have used just regular bread crumbs and they are just as good as well. I have baked and pan fried this dish and I like it fried. It adds more taste although is more difficult to keep the breading on the chicken. I would add more oil to the pan so the crust would stay on the chicken. The mustard cream sauce is really good and is best with fresh herbs. Do not be afraid to double it because I always find people scraping it off the plate. It is really tasty and does not taste like chicken drowned in mustard sauce.

We loved this recipe!! Though I have to admit the first time I made this I forgot the dill. Second time I made it I used the dill. Skip the Dill!!!! I also made enough of the mustard cream sauce to use in my mashed potatoes. Was outstanding side to this delicious dish.

I was originally attracted to the use of pistachios but, as another person pointed out, the outcome was tasty but unimpressive. The cornmeal crusted chicken recipe which is also featured on this site uses a similar mustard coating and by far better (definately worthy of a 4-spoon rating). Others might want to consider trying that.

This dish does not reflect the good taste of what compose it. It looks fabulous but, after all, it's so-so. If I would have to do it again, I would at least double the recipe of mustard.

It was good, but had a problem in the stove-top phase with keeping the pistachio crust on the chicke. It preferred sticking to the bottom of the pan. More oil (than 2T called for) and hotter flame helped on the 2nd batch, but would appreciate other input on that part of the process.

Rating: 4
SCRUMPTIOUS!! I would increase the goop factor (the dijon mustard) by about a 3/4 cup. The chicken was very moist and juicy; although I do agree with one other cook, you will need to cook the chicken a tidge longer than called for. I made the sauce but found that this dish is very good without it, although you could use the sauce on pasta or rice. I served this dish with angel pasta and glazed carrots. I think that using fresh herbs really adds to the yum of this dish. Will absolutely make it again!!

Rating: 4
Great recipe. It wasn't to difficult to prepare. The oven step works to finish the chix and keep warm to plate--nice touch. I added 1/2 cup of panko more than they called for. I also subbed dried tarragon for the dill, and it worked fine. My wife says the sauce made the dish--it needs a sauce for sure. We liked the sauce enough to try it with other dishes. Enjoy!
