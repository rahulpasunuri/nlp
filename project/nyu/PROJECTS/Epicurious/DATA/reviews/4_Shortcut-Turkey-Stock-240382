Yes, I agree with others. This is a great 'lazy' stock to make. Hardly any effort involved, SO much more flavor than using plain store bought stock, and it yielded some really delicious, knock-out gravy. Definitely worth a few extra minutes to chop a few veggies and there's only one extra pot to wash.

This is the easiest stock recipe that I've ever used, and the gravy it made was fantastic. I made the pancetta sage turkey recipe from this site, and almost skipped this part out of laziness. I have to say that I'm glad I didn't, because it took hardly more effort than I would have expended using plain chicken stock, and it probably contributed to what we thought was the best gravy we've ever had.

I was surprised. As good or better than any I've made from scratch--which is quite a few.
