I use a lot of fig preserves when entertaining, so when a relative gave me 8 pounds of figs from her tree, I tried this recipe. I read a number of recipes and decided I was reduce the sugar quantity to 1 cup of sugar to 1 pound of figs, and add more if needed. Additionally, I used half sugar and half blue agave sweetener (only need 3/4 cup agave to one cup of sugar). I used about 1/8 ground clove for the entire batch of about five pounds of figs and I reduced the minced ginger to about 2 teaspoons for the batch as well. The end result was amazing! A beautiful preserve that has a wonderful fig taste, with some nice spice and a slight hint of lemon. Everyone that has tried it has raved about it! It was very easy from start to finish! NOTE: Boil filled jars to properly seal and preserve!

Since several reviewers considered this jam too heavily spiced, I omitted the spices and added a few sprigs of fresh thyme from the garden. It turned out delicious and will be delicious on toast.

Due to everyone's comments about the wassil-y nature of the finished product, I only used the cinnamon stick and cut the cloves and ginger. I used a mix green Katodas, brown Turkish, and black mission since that's what I had on hand. I thought a hearty pinch of salt really rounded out the flavors and took the tooth hurting edge off the sweetness. I don't think I'd want this on toast or anything, but I'll definitely include it on my next cheese plate or as a chutney-esque accompaniment to something savory.

This recipe is very simple and very good. I've never made preserves, jam, etc. because I've been intimidated but this was easy without needing loads of equipment.

Really like this recipe, not the overwhelming southern tasteless fig preserves. I didn't have a lemon but subbed a small orange, plus added the juice of a lime to help override the extreme sweetness of the figs.

I made this last night on a whim for a date and it turned out wonderfully even with the modifications I made. I roughly halved the recipe, and used less than the corresponding amount of sugar. Instead of a cinnamon stick I used a piece of Star Anise. I also do not have a working blender, so I simply chopped the figs and lemon finely before putting them in the sauce pot. None the less, Chris and I liked it quite a lot as a condiment for a pan fried pork cutlet. I think it could also pair nicely with lamb.

I've made this over the last 3 years and give jars of it to friends during the holidays. They all seem to love it. I use Mission Figs and double the lemon and cut back just a bit on the sugar.

These preserves were excellent and easy to prepare. I agree with other reviewers that the spices overpower the figs to create a jam that reminds one of spiced, winter beverages. We enjoy it with ham, pork, turkey or chicken--not just as a jam for breads.

This is spicy like the wassil beverage. I would make this again, but prefer the pure fig taste of non-spiced preserves and will go back to that in the future. Used mission figs, the only ones available. Made a very sweet, but very beautiful burgundy preserve.

Tasty, but needs more lemon. The fig taste is kind of overwhelmed by the spices. I probably won't be making it again. I prefer our old family recipe using only figs,lemon (juice plus peel) and sugar.

Delicious! And good-looking, too -- a perfect fall/winter jam. A doubled recipe filled 6 half-pint jars for gifts, with a bit left over to keep for myself. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent. This was my first experience with canning, so I was nervous about everything, but it came out great. I used Black Mission figs. It was a bit sweeter than I'd expected -- I would've preferred a bit more tanginess -- but have been enjoying it on toast and crackers, and will probably make it again. Definite recommendation!

I had wonderful results with this recipe. Although I prefer Mission figs for eating, I used Brown Turkeys and was very pleased with the outcome. I quadrupled the recipe, and found that it needed to simmer at 200 degrees for about 40 minutes. I also found that it made about 10 percent more than I expected.

Wow!! This is really good and very easy to make. I already have friends and neighbors begging for more. It really is a jam rather than preserves since the fruit is chopped but whatever you call it, it is excellent! Jim

I found this recipe here and was impressed by the rave reviews. I made a few jars and gave one to my mother to test. She was blown away! So, 12 lbs of figs later, I've made about 35 jars of it. Unfortunately, all I have access to is brown turkey figs. I would love to try some other varieties. I think these will make wonderful gifts!

These are the best preserves we've had. We've made them with both the Calamyrna & Mission figs--Calamyrna taste better, though both are quite good. We live for fig season thanks in large part to this recipe.

I have made this twice already. It's really an unusual combination - quite pleasing. It would be great for the holidays it seems Christmasy. I served it to my nieces who are just begining to be adventurous culinarily and they loved it and said now it can be a tradition, a family recipe that they pass on. I felt very complimented. Recipes like this make me look like a pro. I've never made jam before and I swear you could sell this one it's so good.

Just made this and added 1/4 c. Tawny Port, increased the fresh ginger to 3 tsp and added the zest of 1 lemon. It was great over vanilla ice cream and on waffles for breakfast. Saw a variation of this recipe using an orange in place of the lemon. That sounds good too.

I made this recipe so that I could make a Fig Preserve Cake which appeared in the Atlanta Journal Constitution on 6/22/00 (is that helpful for the reader from Tampa?). Its a wonderful preserve though I would like to also see another posted that featured chunks of figs rather than a puree.

Now please pass along suggestions for using the fig preserves. Wehave tons of preserves and need some ways to use them, other than the more obvious.

Wonderful preserves with an almost Victorian taste. The lemon flavor really came through--rather like a marmalade.
