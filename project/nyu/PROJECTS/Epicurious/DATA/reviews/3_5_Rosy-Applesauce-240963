This was INCREDIBLE - granted, I did a lot of substitutes: Gala apples and strawberries instead of cranberries and several shakes of cinnamon instead of a stick, but it was delicious and the recipe serves as a nice base to figure out how to make various fruit sauces.

This was very easy and everyone loved it. I served it with pork tenderloin.

So-So. I made it based on the excellent reviews. The cranberry threw it off; it was overly tart and kind of sour.

This is the best applesauce I've had. I cut the sugar in half, and like other users, added a half cup of water in the beginning to prevent burning. I omitted the cinnamon and added the zest from a medium orange and a teaspoon of vanilla. Phenomenal!! For some reason couldn't get a 4 fork, but if I could I'd give it a 5.

Excellent and easy to make. The color is wonderful and much better than the brownish version we get with other recipes. My 6 yr old loved it! And it's good for your kidney's because of the cranberries. I only made one slight change: I added 1 Tbsp of water to pot at the start to avoid having apples stick to bottom of the pot.

God I loved this. I used a mix of apples from the farmer's market and fresh cranberries from Whole Foods. It was delicious, and the prettiest red.

Cranberries make an excellent addition to applesauce. I will confess that I used 4 lbs of whatever apples I had on hand - not golden delicious (probably a mix of gala and honeycrisp). I also had to add 1/2 cup of water at the beginning so the sugar would stop burning. Overall, though, very delicious.
