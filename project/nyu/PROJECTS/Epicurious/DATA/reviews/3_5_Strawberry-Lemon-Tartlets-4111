I love this recipe,especially the crust. I add a bit of almond paste to the crust. So adaptable to any kind of filling. you can even substitute lemon curd for any other curd. The rest of the article has many variations for fillings, and I have also had the Apricot Custard Tart, but substituted the apricots for peaches I had on hand. Used Lime Curd and blueberries on top. Banana Curd with coconut and sliced bananas on top. yummmy! The curd brand I always use is Dickinson's. My addition of June 1997 is wearing out, so I had to save this in my recipe box. ;)

gabby5 - I consider your rating invalid. Sounds like you are reviewing the Trader Joe Lemon Curd, not this recipe.

I used Trader Joe's lemon curd and found it way too sweet. I used extra lemon zest and that helped a bit.
