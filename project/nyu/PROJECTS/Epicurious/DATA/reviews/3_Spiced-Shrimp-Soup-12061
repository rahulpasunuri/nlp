Being a cold Canadian, I know great HOT soup. Try putting in a julienne of snow pea and red pepper last minute for color and snap!

A beautiful soup. I briefly sauteed the shrimp shells with a little chopped garlic and a few shallots before adding the water, which brought out the flavor nicely. Taking a cue from Memphis, also added a chopped chipotle in adobo (better than the powder) to the strained broth for a little more depth and kick.

I have been making this soup for years. It is very easy as long as you can get all the ingredients. I have made it for company and they have asked for the recipe. I never get tired of this soup...and it will remain in my recipe file forever!

I'm not sure what I did wrong--I followed the instructions and everything, but the end result was just vile-smelling and tasted salty and fishy. I ordinarily have pretty good luck with Epicurious recipes, and I love Thai and other Asian foods. Maybe it was just a fluke, but I doubt I'd try it again.

This is a great soup, which is easy to make. It goes better, I think, served over rice. I substituted powdered chipotle which gives a more complex flavor than a Thai or serrano chili.

Excellent. Very authentic and light soup. You can also make this with vegetables instead of shrimp. Impressive, but relatively easy to make.
