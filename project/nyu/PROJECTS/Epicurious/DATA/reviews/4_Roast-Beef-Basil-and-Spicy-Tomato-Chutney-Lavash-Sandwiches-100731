Outstanding sandwich. The spicy tomato chutney is what makes the sandwich so special. I have made it two or three times and everyone wants the recipe.

So easy and very tasty. Made it for the Hollywood Bowl and everyone thought it was great. The Spicy Tomato Chutney is spicy enough to serve with chicken also.

Outstanding. I will make it again. Took it for a tailgate party and everyone loved it. A 4 STAR keeper!

Outstanding! This is the reason I check Epicuious first!

Absolutely amazing! It's rare for me to give something "four forks", but it was deservingly fabulous -- especially the tomato chutney. I made it using Trader Joe's tomato/basil foccacia instead of the lavash because I had it on hand (which made traditional sandwiches instead of rolled sandwiches). I thought they would be good, but they were surprisingly amazing -- the chutney is the key to it all. Huge hit.

I chose this recipe because I was looking for a make-ahead sandwich I could pull out of the refridgerator and serve as soon as my guests arrived from out of town, and it exceeded my expectations by far. Everyone gobbled these up, including a finicky nephew who called them "burritto-y things," and adults with sophisticated tastes. The chutney is fabulous, and a must for this recipe. It wasn't watery at all; indeed, to the contrary, it was the "glue" that held the sandwiches together. I made them using rectangular lavash, which was the only kind I could find. I cut the large pieces in half and rolled a large sandwich out of each half. Then I cut the sandwiches in half horizontally. I arranged them on a rectangular tray, which made an attractive presentation, and covered the entire tray with plastic wrap. (There was no need to wrap each sandwich individually.) I served these with two other recipes from this site, prosciutto and brief sandwiches with rosemary fig confit, and curried turkey salad with cashews. It was an excellent make-ahead feast, except for the cashews, which are added at the last minute/

A good jumping off point for those who haven't tried making roll-ups before. To the cook in D.C. and others who have trouble with crumbly lavash, my remedy for this is to lay the bread on a flat surface, mist it lightly with water (a plant mister works well) or cover it with a damp dish towel for 15 min. before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.

The flavors work wonderfully together, and this is an easy finger food with great eye appeal. The chutney made the lavosh a bit damp, though, so I might drain it a bit next time.

These flavors are wonderful together. The basil and spicy tomato chutney compliment each other nicely. I've made this several times as it's easy and a real crowd pleaser. The lavash rolls I used the first time were not pliable and broke when I tried to roll them. But this sandwich tastes great on fresh french bread and ciabata. Enjoy!
