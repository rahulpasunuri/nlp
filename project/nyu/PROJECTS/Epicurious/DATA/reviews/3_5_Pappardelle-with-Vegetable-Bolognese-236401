Doubled the sauce, added garlic, oregano, and herbs de provence! Awesome!

I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't really change anything. I might add garlic, just b/c I think everything tastes better with it. But it's delicious as is. I've made a couple of lackluster lentil bolognese sauces and this is sooo much better. It was very easy, quick (especially for the depth of flavor achieved) and very yummy. Half my family is vegetarian and half eat meat but everyone loved this. It's not really beautiful enough for a dinner party, but great for a family supper.

Really good! Not mind blowing by any means (I wouldn't serve it to guests) but easy, tasty, healthy, cheap. I served it over polenta, not pasta, so I didn't have any pasta water to thin the sauce, but I added some extra wine to thin. Bolognese is supposed to be thick though, so for those who complain that it is too thick, be careful adding too much liquid.

I enjoy a nice hunk of animal as much as the next person, but this dish is awesome without any meat. The sauce is flavorful, hearty and filling. If you were to invite a couple cloves of garlic and some Italian spices (marjoram, basil, oregano, thyme) to the party, it would make this dish just about perfect. Make sure to use a big, bold red wine for more hearty flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good, very satisfying and I actually prefer it over meat because it is lighter and healthier. Next time I will put in a mixture of spices - perhaps thyme with rosemary - to round it out. I used a good quality wine and I am glad i did. This will be a standard part of my winter repetoire.

I recently made this recipe (although it came from the Food Network, but was pretty much the same exact thing. One difference was that she had you add marscapone, along with parm, at the end. I had goat cheese on hand and used that instead. It was delicious and I am actually making it again tonight!

This is such a satisfying dish. I added a can of yellowfin tuna in water (so it's not as fishy as in oil). My husband had no idea it wasn't meat.

I thought this was delicious! I didn't have dried mushrooms so I used a fresh portabella and added reconstituted sun dried tomatoes and used that liquid for the sauce. Instead of tomato paste I used a small can of Hunts (don't judge!) tomato sauce - no salt added. And added fresh parsley in the end. My guests ate it up never even missing the meat!

this is awful! do not make it. the recipe was clearly designed for looks. the bolognese does indeed look like meat. it tastes awful, however. there is no depth or complexity to the dish. all you taste is dried porcini mushrooms

I used regular white mushrooms and put those in with the veggies. Subbed red onion for shallots. Used dry rosemary and a mushroom-based fettucine. I thought it was quite good and could be made with any assortment of vegetables.

Read below the other reviewers changes. It definitely needed more tomato paste and in the end we added chicken stock. It defeated the whole purpose, but it was the only way to make it taste good.

I would prob. give this 2.5 forks - the end product was good, but it was not easy to get to. I agree with other reviews that you need to let it simmer for awhile afert the red wine/mushroom water is added. Also added an extra tablespoon of tomatoe paste and about 1.5cup red wine. Needed more salt and red peppers flakes for added flavor to the end result, but we were happy with it after those adjustments.

I usually hate mushrooms, but this was yummy and substantial. I used farfalle -- good alternative to pappardelle, which was nowhere to be found in my local market.

The mushrooms and pepper make this dish, and the texture of the veggies (pulsed in a food processor) is similar to ground beef. Be careful with the rosemary, though. I use just 1 tsp or omit altogether -- it can be overpowering.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! I wanted something quick and vegetarian for supper and this was it. It's fairly easy and quick to make - I especially love pulsing the veggies in the food processor. It's a real time saver! I couldn't find pappardelle at the store, so I used tagliatelle. It was delicious and my husband could definitely detect the mushroom taste from the soaking liquid. I'd highly recommend this recipe for a quick, easy mid-week meal.

Would have given it 31/2. Worked fine with tagliatelle since my grocery didn't have pappardelle. Store also ran out of fresh rosemary. Dried worked but was inferior. Husband didn't fall for the lack of meat but toddler gobbled it up.

I liked the basic recipe but didn't love it (too mushroomy tasting for me). I ended up adding a can of tomato puree and another 1/2 cup red wine and then let it simmer for over an hour. I liked that result much better and will make it again.

Works very well. Carrots and pepper give it a sweet flavor. No need to chop fine. Small ridged type pasta worked well with the sauce too.

This is a fantastic recipe. Both my husband and I loved it. He has been vegetarian for years and doesn't remember what real bolognese tastes like, so maybe he's easily impressed. But I eat meat on occasion, and I love bolognese, and this sauce was delicious. Very rich, great texture (not too dry but not too "saucy"). Unfortunately, I couldn't find dried porcinis, so had to use a mixture of dried wild mushrooms, but it was still great. Go heavy on the red wine.

it's great. the recipe is much better when you add just a bit more olive oil, 2-3 garlic cloves and cook it just slightly more than the recipe calls for, 12-15 minutes more after you add the wine + 1.5/2 cups water/cooking liquid. it gets just the right taste and consistency. I would give it 3.5 forks, but guess 4 is just right as this is exeptional for a meatless bolognese. and do use dried porcini it's totaly different taste from any other fresh mushroom. this is I guess what gives it the "meaty" taste.

We loved this. I made it easier by pulsing baby bellas with the other veggies in the beginning. I opted out of the fried shrooms. I doubled the tomato paste and added a cup of pasta water while the sauce was cooking because it got dry fast. The key is to use lots of parmesan. My husband initially didn't believe there was no meat in it!

Good. would give it a 2.5 if I could. Needed a little more liquid and a little more flavor. It just wasn't coming together with the right texture and sauciness. I added a touch more red wine and a little chicken broth. I also added a bit more olive oil for a silkier texture. In the end, it was well received... The flavor, howeve,r as not as intense as you might imagine.

I thought this dish was excellent. I am a carnivore and struggle to find good dishes to make for vegetarian friends. This came out great. Rich flavor. No changes except I added a couple more carrots and went heavy on the mushrooms. It is great.

Filling, wintry comfort food, but not amazing. Might attempt it again, and if so, would try adding a big pile of chopped or sliced garlic, some crushed red pepper for heat, and a sprinkling of chopped Italian parsley as garnish.
