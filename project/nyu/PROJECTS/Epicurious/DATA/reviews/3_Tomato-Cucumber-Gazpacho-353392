My partner refused to eat this. The anchovy paste and mayonnaise ruined it for me. Without them - probably a tasty, easy, low calorie gazpacho.

Nice easy gazpacho. The anchovy paste gives this soup a nice flavor.

I omitted the Anchovy Paste and I blended all the ingredients instead of holding some out to add at the end. I also made a Pesto Pizza with it. Delish!

Omitted the Anchovy Paste and used tomatoes and cucumbers from our Garden. I also blended all the cucumbers and onions instead of holding them out until the end. I Pureed it in the blender but let it stay a little chunky. Extremely easy and very fresh tasting. We made a Pesto Pizza to go along with it.

I thought this was wonderful and easy gazpacho. I just eliminated the basil and toned down the anchovy paste. Much easier than others I've made with delicous results.

This was tasty and easy soup and especially pleased my mother-in-law who has an aversion to peppers (which most of my gazpacho recipes include). We omitted the anchovy paste and were very happy with the results. We liked it so much, we made it twice during her visit.

This sounds like the worst gaspacho recipe I've ever heard of. Basil? Mayo? ICK! For a more authentic version try the Fresh Tomato Gazpacho on Epicurious. Gazpacho is simple-Tomatoes (seeded, don't worry about skin though), Cucumbers, Red Onion, Olive Oil, Red Wine/Sherry Vinegar and crusty or stale or toasted bread or croutons. Either Chop and mix (croutons on top), or blend all the ingredients (croutons included) together. Add red/green peppers if you want. Done, easy, delish.

The anchovy paste odor and taste was overpowering to us. IF we made the soup again, we'd omit anchovy in favor of sea salt and would substitute creme fraiche for the mayo.

This is an interesting pan-Mediterranean gazpacho: the anchovy paste, basil, mayo, & parm croutons certainly give a pungent/sweet Italian flair. I very much enjoyed the refreshing result, but it's not traditional Andalusian gazpacho, if that's what you're looking for.
