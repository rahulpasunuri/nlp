I followed the recipe exactly, though I put it in an oval Le Cruset small baking pan vs. ramekins. This is not a juicy cobbler like you might expect. I had some cranberries I wanted to put to use but I doubt I'll make this again. My husband was excited by the prospect but quite disappointed by the result.

easy and quick recipe, made little muffin-like discs with crisp outsides and a fruity hit. i also probably over-mixed. substituted frozen strawberries as my fruit, used bread flour, added honey to the strawberries, and used plain instead of vanilla yogurt. anyway, very delicious bites. a flexible and easy recipe.

Not a winner...universally rated very poorly. Would never make it again.

I'm not sure how this got so many 4-fork ratings. The pear and cranberry part is good, but the cobbler part isn't! I read the reviews before starting and was very careful not to overstir the mixture - also, I spooned it into the bottom, then put the fruit in, then spread it over the top. After baking, the dish was BEAUTIFUL - but not tasty or sweet, and certainly not what I expected for cobbler. If I had ordered it in a restaurant for dessert, I would never return for it or order it again.

I over mixed the batter as well and it turned out like a muffin. My boyfriend really loved this recipe and we'll certainly make it again, I think not over mixing the batter is key!

If I wanted a delicious moist muffin, this would be the recipe. As a cobbler, it is a big disappointment. No crunchy topping, no oozy fruit at the bottom. You basically can lift the whole thing out in one piece (ie, it looks like a muffin). The other reviewers were right in calling it what it is.

I was looking for a dessert to mkae that would be easy after a day of skiing. Not only did everyone love this dessert but everyuone asked for the recipe! I made the recipe twice the first time as it states and the second time my husband wanted apples and not pears. Well i mixxed the apples and pears together and it was amazing. It was just enough tartness, he asked me to keep this recipe and make it again. Here i was worried it would be too healthy and he would not like it! i stuck gold!

I over mixed the oats/sugar/egg/etc and the cobblers seemed more like muffins. Will try again and leave the mixture a little chunkier, I think. Used frozen blueberries instead of cranberries and it was a sweet addition. I also drizzled some honey over each cobbler and sprinkled some cinnamon. I may also lightly coat the fruit with some sugar or cinnamon next time as well. Also, a dollop of yogurt on top is something to consider.

Made as written and it was pretty good, but I thought it needed a little sugar over the fruit, and I don't like super sweet fruit desserts. Had a nice, mild ginger flavor and the oatmeal topping was quite good. I will make it again with a small amount of sugar and perhaps a little cinnamon in with the fruit.

This recipe is pretty good! i used apples instead of pears since i love apples more and i used a muffin pan. Its really yummy, i tended to like to use a little more oats but =]

Didn't have ramekins that big so made it as muffins and just mixed the fruit into the oat mixture. Delicious!
