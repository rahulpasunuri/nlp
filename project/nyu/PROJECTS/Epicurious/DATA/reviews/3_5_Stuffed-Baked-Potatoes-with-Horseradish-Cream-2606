Both my husband and daughter loved the potatoes but didn't like the topping very much. Said it was too much on the Horseradish side.

This is a Thanksgiving staple. I make it the day before and then just have to put them in the oven as the turkey comes out. Absolute standby for all meats. YUM! You cannot go wrong with this recipe but I do recommend adding a little extra milk and sour cream.

These were great. I have made them several times and find that I like them best with the addition of a little garlic and about 1/2c shredded cheddar cheese. You will need to add a couple Tb. milk to the mix too.

Must like horseradish. I served this with Prime rib, and it was delicious. I was in the North Country and fresh dill was very expensive, so I substituted a little green onion top. My feeling is that dill, chives, or green onion top would all be suitable because the main purpose is to add a bit of color and interest. Also, I agree with prior posting. The second baking is just to heat them and brown the tops a bit. I baked them with my meat at 400 degrees for 35 minutes, so temp and time are adjustable. Great dish to do ahead.

A horseradish lover's delight! Well worth the effort. The second bake time of 50 minutes is 15 minutes too long if the potatoes have not been refrigerated.

Very nice dish, I made this with steaks and it was delicious. We are horseradish lovers, so today I'm making it for the second time but with less sour cream and more horseradish. I would say that the dill is optional.

I liked this a lot. My boyfriend is a huge fan of horseradish so I'm always happy to find recipes that use it. I added extra horseradish after I reduced the recipe for two potatoes instead of six. I also added a little dill to the potatoes themselves. I did not, however, use fresh dill so I used less in the topping than called for. I sprinkled with a little parm a couple of minuutes before taking them out of the oven. The only problem I had was that I couldn't fit the all of the potatoes back in the skins. I overdid it and they made a mess on the cookie sheet.

I first tried this recipe when it came out in 1994...and again a few years later. My son who is now 10 requested it specifically for our Christmas dinner this year. if you like horseradish this will be very appealing to you.

I was looking for a poato recipe with zippy flavor and this was perfect. Easy to make and simple ingredients. I used all the horseradish in the potatoes and didn't use the sour cream topping mixture.

Didn't think this recipe was that good.

Simple ingredients for a wonderful result! Of course, you should add more or less of the key ingredients to make it specific to your tastes (as with any recipe), but it's the combination that is key. Can't wait to make it again! KIMBER

I served this to friends who now request it when they come for dinner. We also make it often for ourselves. I recommend a little extra sour cream. Perfect with grilled steak.

I loved this recipe for potatoes, but if you crave horseradish, you might want to increase the amount used in this recipe. It's great with grilled flank steak.

I love the flavour of horseradish and sour cream and this recipe did not disappoint.

This recipe debuted before three of my closest friends and they loved it (even the one that hates horseradish). The rationale behind a "three-fork" rating on this terrific recipe is that the stuffing needs a few additional spoons of sour cream and a dab of milk (for moisture) before final warming. Highly recommended...
