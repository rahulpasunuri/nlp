While I used beef stew meat in place of sirloin, and tomato sauce in place of whole tomatoes (my husband doesn't care for the texture of cooked tomatoes), and omitted the jalapeno, I did the rest of the recipe as written. It was. . . disappointing, bland, and with little texture. As written, it also makes for a *lot* of food, so halve the recipe the first time you try it, is my advice.

This chili is luscious! Every time I make it someone asks for the recipe. As with most chili, it gets better the second day! The three types of meat really give it great depth of flavor.

if you find it too salty, the chorizo isn't your problem, it's the TABLESPOON of garlic SALT! just replace with garlic powder and keep the chorizo

This is a real crowd pleaser. I have made it many times and it never fails to get rave reviews.

I love this recipe! I don't use garlic salt. I use garlic powder instead. I also season the meat before browning with chili powder, garlic, onion powder, and cumin. I use low sodium beef broth and 28oz cans of tomato. I add a large can of pinto beans, they absorb the salt.

Excellent base chili, will make this again. I did modify the recipe slightly, I used 2 lbs of porterhouse, 12 oz of ground beef, and 1/2 lb of chorizo. I used half the cilantro, 1 TBSP of ground cinnamon, and 4 Serrano peppers. Lastly, I slow cooked the chili for about 5 hours. Not a question about the saltiness.

This was a great basic chili recipe, which I followed to the letter, but was almost inedibly salty, and I'm not usually sensitive to salty foods!

This recipe is the best chili I've ever had and has become a staple in our house. I've never used the chorizo (can't find it here in Chas) but have substituted spicy italian sausage, extra ground beef, or left it out altogether and I've never had a complaint. I add black and kidney beans and have at times substituted chicken for beef, both ground and chopped, for a healthier version. Never had a salt issue, either. It's raining and nasty here...am off to the store right now for the ingredients and can't wait!

The best chili recipe!! Rave reviews every time I make it. As to all the comments on saltiness: use low sodium broth, or OMIT the chorizo and substitute equal weight of ground beef. Also, I add a little sugar to temper all the chili and heat. This is also great with ground turkey, (use equal amount of weight ratio to ALL the meats) and brown when you would the ground beef. Makes a healthier and lighter version, but just as tasty! Great with serranos for more heat

This is a great, hearty dish! This chili has become my signature chili, with a few modifications: To cut down on the saltiness, I use 1/2 T. of garlic salt and substitute 1/2 T. of garlic powder. I also add 2 large cans of kidney beans (what's chili w/o the beans?). Delicious!

This was very good. Great for a cold winter night. Nicely spiced and very conventional in it's chili taste. I made mine in a crockpot all day. It was perfect. Also good for the hi protein diet types as well. I used all the peppers but seeded half of them. Still quite spicey.

I like cilantro but unfortunately the people I made this for do not like it. I was lukewarm on this recipe. I added beans and some cumin. I liked it better the next day. I probably will not make it again.

This has become my signature dish. I get a lot of requests for it. If it's too salty, don't use Hunt's tomatoes (see the label for sodium content) and use low sodium beef broth.

This recipe is really wonderful! The fresh cilantro is a must, and adds a unique, rich flavor (even if you don't otherwise care for cilantro). It is the only chili recipe I would consider making - we are hooked!

This recipe, while not quick and easy, is fabulous. The complexity of flavors and it's departure from "traditional" chili make it a winner!!

Like others have said..this was a good base. I substituted so much that, could EL CID claim this one? I added chili beans, used a mixture of beef stock, chicken stock and some beer. I added additional chili powder and cumin then cooked for hours. I used spanish chorizo, round steak and ground chuck. Not sure if the spanish chorizo was too mild, but this chili could be hotter. It was never too salty...did you use bouillon for stock?

I love salt and this recipe was way too salty for me. I almost think there is an error in the recipe. I have made this a few times and it's a pretty good basic chili, but I'm not sure how it was picked best chili in the USA!

I've made this twice in two weeks..my family loves it and they normally don't care for chili. The various seasonings make it interesting. I served it with jalepenos, sour cream and shredded cheese.....will become a "family" recipe

Seasoned to taste, this is a great recipe. I don't understand the "salty" comment. Season and taste often, and, as with most chili recipes, it's better the second day.

We make chili often and this recipe was a bust. A little salty would be an understatement; we added no salt and still found it to be a sodium overload. It also has no depth of flavor. Not a great chili at all.

I loved this Chili! I couldn't find chorizo so I used portuguese sausage instead. I used beef and pork tenderloin added red and black beans and left out the peppers. The result was a hearty chili that I ate all week. YUM!

Great chili. Chorizo was the key. Added kidney and black beans. Letting this simmer for 3-4 hrs is a plus

Very rich and hearty. Was a hit even with the kids. I omitted the jalenpeno peppers because I thought it might make it to hot. It was great without them. It was a little to salty for me so I would definitely cut down on the salt. I think the chorizo adds that need salt. Would make again!

I made this chili when the recipe was first published in Parade. It really is delicious.
