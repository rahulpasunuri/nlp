I really enjoyed this recipe but then I love arugula. It was very flavourful with a slight sweet and sour taste.I added sauted onions and mushrooms over the steak, Will make this regularly.

Made this dish for the first time last night and an instant classic! Made it for just my husband and myself last night, but definately a "company-worthy" recipe and plan to use it when we have guests next month. The marinade itself is wonderful. Made it as outlined with the exception that I opted not to strain the oil as had pretty much emulsified the oil. Everything blended wonderfully and the ricotta whipped potatoes with the dish were excellent.

So delicious, my wife wants it on my permanent dinner choices. The Ricotta Mashed Potatoes were also good when I added a roasted bulb of garlic to the mix. The Arugula oil is good on bread instead of butter or plain olive oil.

Found this dish quite tasty . didnt care for the peppers to much , found stuffed mushrooms go better .
