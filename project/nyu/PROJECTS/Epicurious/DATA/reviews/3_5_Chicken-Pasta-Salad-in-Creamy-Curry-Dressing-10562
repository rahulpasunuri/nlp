Really good even with my modifications. No chicken, so used leftover homemade andouille hamburger patties chopped up and a couple pieces of salami chopped up. Did not "cook" the dressing. Used 1 can of coconut milk ( due to dairy allergies), 2 Tbsps ww vinegar, 2 tsps curry pwdr, no butter, 1 tsp. Aleppo peppers gr., 2 tbsps mango chutney, 3 cl. fresh garlic, 2 tsps, finely minced ginger, salt and pepper. Then used an assortment of fresh veggies, celery, red pepper, cilantro, red onion, peas, Turned out really good! Kids and hubbie gobbled it up. I do think it would be even better using chicken, tomatoes, basil but with a fresh dressing as I listed.

Excellent!!! :-) I used rice pasta and added a little bit of cubed mozzarella... YUM!

I whipped this up in no time and was quite excited about it. I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used a beef steak and cut it to bite sized pieces. Another change I made was to substitute hot curry powder and leave out the hot red pepper flakes. And yet another, I didn't have heavy cream so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and whisked flour with some skim milk (it worked). NOW...I served this to my three little boys - they loved it, clamoring for seconds and in high praise mode. I had a little taste of theirs' when I was serving and I must admit I found it really bland. I left it covered and at room temp. and didn't get around to it until about 1/2 hour or so later. That time made all the difference for me! Yes sir. It was super!! So now I am a huge fan and my kids want me to make it again. This, in itself, is rare as I do not rotate recipes and we always are trying something new. Thank you EPI.

I would definitely make this again. It is easy and very good. I did make extra curry sauce based on other comments. Other than that I followed the recipe.

I recently was going to a potluck at work, when someone asked about this dish. They remembered (and loved!) it even though I had not brought it to a work function in almost 20 years!!!

This is a regular at my house, the kids love it. I double the cherry tomatoes and chutney and then increase the dressing 1 1/2 times.

I am always attracted to this recipe (creamy curry mmmm) and then on further reading I wind up not making it. But tonight I decided to give it a whirl. I used a pound of pasta and quadrupled everything but I am not satisfied with the proportions. I think extra chicken is needed and definitely a lot lot lot more tomatoes. Almonds or pine nuts would be very good too. And peas. I cooked the chicken in the garlic & ginger and then made the sauce in the pot with the cooked chicken. It was a little watery and didn't really cook down even after around 10 minutes of a simmer but tasted just fine on the pasta. I regret not using coconut milk instead of half and half. I used a can of mango because it was $1.59 compared to $5.69 for a can of mango chutney. It was a good substitution.

I'm really annoyed at a salad recipe that is for two servings.

This was pretty tasty and comes together really fast. Next time, I'll probably double the amount of sauce and use a pre-cooked chicken.

Delicious! A perfect step up from the typical pasta salad at a summer party. The dressing needs to be doubled like others have said before.

this dish is excellent! i have made it 4 times and each time the bowls have been licked clean! i held off the scallions and red peppers... (i am not a fan of spice!) anyways-delicious dish, a definite easy dinner!

I enjoyed this recipe, however, it wasn't as well received by friends at a recent cookout. Many people do not favor the curry flavor and therefore it was barely touched by the majority of guests.

Just looking for some chicken salad to make for work lunch and this one seemed great. I used coconut milk, too, and cut-up chicken strips; added celery for crunch. I love this sort of thing! Overnight in the fridge and it should be just the perfect balm for my work frazzles tomorrow!

This was very tasty. I doubled the recipe and used rotisserie chicken, added a red bell pepper, used coconut milk instead of heavy cream (delicious) and fresh diced mango instead of chutney. Also I used rotini tri-colore for the pasta, the dish looked very nice and colorful. Really good!

My daughter made this last night. It was fantastic. She used a rotisserie chicken and a pound of pasta and she admitted to making extra sauce. We love curry and mango chutney flavors - it was just right! I will definitely make this again and again.

Forgot to include in my review that I used applesauce instead of the mango chutney.

I REALLY love this recipe. A few things I did different - used cheese tortellini, used half & half instead of heavy cream (I once tried using 2% with a little flour mixed in and it worked great too), added some creamed coconut, and used chopped red apples instead of the tomato (I tried the salad once with tomato and once with grapes and the apple was by far my favourite...oh so yummy!).

This has become a staple for us.I agree with the other reviewers that making extra sauce is recommended.It is particularly important in case there are left-overs ( I usually double the recipe so that we can have it again as left-overs the next day as it keeps and reheats really well.) I cannot recommend this highly enough.The curry flavor is in no way overpowering I hasten to add.

From previous reviews I expected more from this. OK, but nothing special.

This recipe was delicious! I took the advice of others and made triple the sauce. I also used cheese tortellini's and substituted shrimp for chicken and added extra tomatoes. I used 1/3 of the vinegar that it called for in the recipe. Also used Madras curry paste instead of regular curry powder which really gave it a "kick"! DO NOT add the sauce to the pasta until you are ready to serve. Had a small portion left from dinner and refrigerated it and the next day it was gummy. The flavors in this dish are wonderful for you curry lovers!

My boyfriend and I loved this salad. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and tripled the sauce. I also ran out of curry powder while it was cooking and let it sit on low until my boyfriend could get back from the store. I think it helped to bring out the flavors even more. Excellent. I will definitely make this again.

This is really the first recipe I have tried from this site. Very tasty! I used plain yogurt and coconut milk combination instead of the heavy cream, I didn't really measure, just kept adding till I liked the consistancy. I also added dried apricots, golden raisins, red seedless grapes, chopped fresh mango and pignoli nuts.

I can't imagine making this salad without following the super-helpful tips posted. This was a hit at the potluck today! (I quadrupled the recipe.) I cooked tri-colored farfalle and refrigerated it overnight. It stuck together so I just ran it under warm water and it loosened right up. Also, I used a store-bought roast chicken, and added sliced red grapes, pea pods (slightly steamed), red peppers, red onion, scallions, basil and topped it with sliced almonds. I followed the suggestion to strain the garlic and ginger from the dressing. Added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. Used more chutney and vinegar than the recipe called for. Also substituted fat-free half-and-half for heavy cream, and it still tasted decadent.

As a rule I generally first try the recipes from Gourmet exactly as written, but have learned that we usually like lots more sauce than allowed for by Gourmet. So, I doubled the sauce ingredients and will more than double the next time. Otherwise, we thought this a great salad. Thanks to Ann from Bucharest - will take you up on the tip re the pasta next time.

I like the flavor of this recipe, however a few reviewers said the recipe quantities 'as is' make for a dry salad, that is an understatement! I doubled the sauce recipe and it is still way too dry (I don't know if it is the pasta I am using?). I will make this again (with MUCH MORE sauce), but if anyone is looking for another good curry chicken salad, I like the Curried Chicken Salad from June 2002. It doesn't have pasta, but it is more the cold, refreshing salad I was looking for in this recipe.

Rating: 4
Soo! Good!! However: I made 1 1/2 times the sauce, mixed all up & served later. Not a good idea! :( Got very dry. Next time, I shall mix the salad & dressing (1 1/2 recipe) and keep them separate until serving. I added toasted pine nuts & raisins. Craisins would be good too. Oh! A great way to use up the store rotisserie chicken! Really good & such a great change from the same old same old. Loved it! It is really sooo good!

Yum, making it for the second time in two weeks tonight. I made it the first time as written only I doubled the sauce. I used 1/2 and 1/2 with no problems. Still going to use cherry tomatoes and I'm going to increase the chutney, hot pepper flakes and a bit more vinegar. We like the extremes of sweet, hot, sour and creamy.

Rating: 3
Yum Yum! Took advice and used red grapes instead of tomatoes. I used 1/4 less vinegar and half again as much curry. I used Penzeys Sweet Curry which is always good. Added toasted almonds & cooled pasta a few hrs before adding dressing. Cooked chicken in pan after making dressing. Just added more butter,garlic & curry. Definetly a keeper.

I haven't yet made this recipe but it sounds delish and I am going to make it as soon as I can. I just wanted to say for those who had trouble with the past sucking up all the dressing that I have found (trial and error and plenty of frustration) that if you boil the pasta one day before and chill it (about 24h) it won't soak up nearly as much dressing as it usually does. Hope that helps.

i was mortified that this salad turned out to be a flop. I read the reviews and took the best advice and still it turned out dry ( i made lots more dressing than required). If I would have added even a quarter of the vinegar requested it would have been intolerable. Please by earlier advice try it before serving it to guests. Also, consider your guest list - some people don't like curry and this one has an odd taste which I can only attribute to the kind of chutney used.

If you're looking for a review to sway you towards making this dish, look no further! Good bite to run-of-the-mill-pasta-salad. I put in some celery to give it some crunch, though. I went ahead and used both cherry tomatoes and red grapes; good flavors! The only suggestion I have is to let the pasta chill seperate from the dressing, otherwise the pasta soaks up the dressing and it could make the dish too dry. It doesn't hurt to make extra dressing and add it to each serving as desired. (BETTER PREPARED AND NOT NEEDED THAN NEEDED AND NOT PREPARED!) Good!

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This was sooo good! I took the advice of some other (very wise) reviewers and added halved red, seedless grapes in lieu of the tomatoes. What a fantastic (idea and) decision this was! I sprinkled them, along with some chiffonade of basil, over the top of the salad right before serving. It turned out to be one of the most beautiful and delicious dishes I have ever made! I couldn't believe how yummy, roll-your-eyes-to-the-back-of-your-head GOOD this was!! I also added golden raisins, chopped roasted almonds, and a sprinkling of red chili flakes to the curry mixture. I threw in some more curry, too. This was so easy to make for a group of people. I had 12 guests over last night, so I multiplied all the measurements by 8...PERFECT! This will stay in my recipe box forever!!

A great pasta salad when you want something a little different. I used coconut milk, as was suggested by another reviewer, and got great results. Added some raisins for a bit of sweetness. If you like Indian food, you will definitely love this dish!

Brush the chicken with a combination of honey dijon mustard and curry powder and bake rather than poach. Sliver. Substitute one diced ripe mango for the chutney. Substitute 1/4 cup toasted cashews for tomatoes and increase the chopped basil and scallions. My sweetheart loved this on a warm July evening.

I adapted this recipe to make a wonderful basmati rice salad--definitely a standout on the Fourth of July bill of fare! I followed the lead of another reviewer and substituted halved red grapes for the tomatoes. I also chopped up some red peppers and dried apricots that I added along with a can of sliced water chestnuts for extra flavor and texture. Stir in a few tablespoons of canola oil to prevent rice from getting sticky. The fusion of sweetness and spice with textures ranging from soft to firm to crisp make this salad a joy to savor and to serve.

First, this only makes 2 servings, so warning. The dressing is strong curry, and isn't creamy enough. I thought it was flavorful, just didn't deserve the kind of reviews others had given this dish. Don't prepare this for guests without first trying it on your own

This dish was de-ee-licious, quick and easy to make with ingredients that I already had. The whole family loved it including my 10 yr old grandson (even though he thought the grapes were olives!) - yes I substitued grapes, tomatoes just don't go with this recipe. Will definitely make again.

Awesome! I tweaked it a bit...used orzo, used 1/2 cream and 1/2 coconut milk, subbed grapes for the tomatoes and added toasted almond slivers. Everybody loved it!

Awesome, doubled the curry and added orange pepper for crunch and extra colour. Great alternative to mayo pasta salad, so much more flavour.

Really nice flavor. I used American Mango Chutney (I didn't know there was a difference but realized I didn't need to drain or chop). I made a little too much pasta so there definately wasn't enough sauce. I will make more sauce or less pasta next time. Great recipe.

The salad was excellent and a big hit! Since I had to bring this to a party of 30 people, I tripled the recipe which worked well as a side dish. I also followed the advice of others who mentioned that it was a bit dry, so I made more than just triple the dressing, which was good advice.

Although I thought the salad was a little dry, my family thought it was wonderful. Next time, I might use a little more dressing.

Very nice as is, but next time I'd double the cherry tomatoes and heavy cream and be more liberal with the red pepper flakes. 2 generous servings: a double recipe would serve 5.

I actually made this dish hot with angel hair pasta...It was totally delicious. Great variation on a plain old pasta night and easy to make. I didn't have any mango chutney on hand, so I sweetened with a pinch of brown sugar.

I love curry and I love the idea of this salad. I was disappointed with the dressing. I threw it out and then mixed jarred curry sauce with mango chutney. Frankly, that was much better than the stuff I made from the recipe. I followed the directions, but didn't seam to get the great result found by so many other people.

I'm only commenting on the dressing...I wanted to make a curried pasta salad, so I made the dressing (doubled), poured it on the ready made fusili and veggies, and refrigerated over night. Took it to my dad's birthday gathering (he's a curry fan - like father, like daughter), and was practically inhaled by everyone. This really beats the old 'add-curry-powder-to-mayo' dressings you often see out there! This will become my standard.

It was a good pasta salad to serve to my sometimes finicky kids. I left out the tomatoes, and did as the other cook did and used plain yogurt instead of cream to make it a bit lighter. The addition of the chutney really makes it good. Everyone ate it up!

I liked this recipe but made a few changes which i think were for the better: -I omitted the cherry tomatoes and used seedless red grapes instead -I doubled the recipe for the sauce. While maikng the sauce, I strained out the garlic and ginger pieces before adding the rest of the ingredients, and also added about a tablespoon of mayo to make it a little creamier/thicker -since I like a sweeter curry, I also added about a teaspoon of white sugar But it is a great recipe to use and also esay to make your own additions!

This got rave reviews from my husband who is partial to chutney and curry. I used cut up fresh tomatoes, chopped onion and light sour cream instead of cherry tomatoes, green onions and cream. It was a very creamy and nicely tangy dressing.

My family and I loved this dish! To make it quicker I used a rotisserie chicken. Also, since I couldn't find chutney I just used fruit preserves. I've taken it to three barbeques this summer and everyone has asked for the recipe!

Yummy, though I skipped the tomatoes. A nice spin on the usual oil/mayo-laden chicken pasta salad. Plan to do it again for company.
