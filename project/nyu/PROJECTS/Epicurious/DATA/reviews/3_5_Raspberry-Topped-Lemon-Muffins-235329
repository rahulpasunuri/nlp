Just made the muffins. I agree with the other cooks, cut the sugar in the recipe. A bit too sweet for my taste. Add more lemon topping to the muffin for a more intense lemon flavor. I added 1 tble of poppy seeds. So so recipe, will probably not make again, off to the next adventure.

Have made these half a dozen times now and they get better and better each time. I follow the recipe exactly for the muffin but don't use as much cream or lemon sugar to top them.

Don't let your daughter smash the microwave plate while softening the butter, as this adds significantly to the unit cost of the muffins. Ours were unsaleable at $1.75

Worked a treat (in fact 10 year old Gabriel searched for these and did all the work herself). Recommended, and worth the effort. We substituted raisins for raspberries because we couldn't be bothered to go out for them.

I really wanted this recipe to be good, but it was just OK at best. I can't understand the rave reviews - there is something off about the proportions in the recipe. The buttermilk curdles the eggs and sugar when added... the batter is very sticky and has a slightly gummy texture after it's baked. The lemon flavour is very subtle, and my muffins barely rose at all - small, flat tops. Also, who makes 14 muffins? Strange to find a recipe for muffins that isn't in multiples of 6 or 12... very mediocre recipe. Agree with other reviewers that the sugar could be cut.

I halved the sugar in the muffin recipe, and it was fine. I did not have enough buttermilk, so I added some milk to thin it out. I did not have raspberries, but it was fine without them. I added the lemon-sugar before baking, and the tops came out tasting like lemon candy! Yum!

perfect as is and thought they were very beautiful.

Very yummy muffins - the lemon sugar was wonderful. I wanted to make them a *tad* healthier, so I made a few modifications: I used half white whole wheat flour; reduced total sugar to 3/4 c.; used 2 Tbsp. melted butter + 1/4 c. canola oil; used half & half instead of whipping cream for brushing on top. I also used frozen raspberries for half the muffins, frozen blueberries for the other half - both were excellent. Cooking time was more like 25-30 minutes. (Cook until golden and toothpick comes out clean.)

These are not "pretty looking" muffins as they don't rise nicely. More vanilla flavored than lemon, although, the lemon sugar on top helps. Inside texture is fine, but mixing raspberries with batter would have been tastier.

This was my first-ever muffin and they were awesome! made exactly as directed except i didn't have the paper thingys so i just sprayed my non-stick muffin pan with pam and it worked fine. i think the lemon sugar is critical  would be a touch boring without it.

These were a hit! Would probably be good with any berries actually. I thought it was silly that this recipe made 14 muffins when the muffin-pan people intended us to cook muffins in multiples of 6...if you add more fruit inside of the muffins you can easily stretch the batter. The lemon sugar on top is a MUST.

I just made these as mini muffins (yield: 52, baking time: 20 min.) and they are fantastic. I omitted the cream and extra sugar on top, because it seemed like overkill, but the flavor is immense and perfectly contrasted with the berry in the middle. They're adorable.

These were light, refreshing muffins! Having no buttermilk, I substituted with sour cream which worked well. Rather than putting the berries on top, I folded them into the batter. Used both blueberries and raspberries. If I were to make these again, I would definitely use only raspberries...they work better with the lemon sugar than blueberries.

yummy just as it is!

These were a huge hit! I folded in the raspberries and lemon peel and with having a sweet tooth, I made a strusel topping of 1/2 c suger 1/2 c flour and 1/4 c butter and sprinkled on top prior to baking. Moist and a wonderful taste.

Very good but I would leave the lemon sugar off the tops.

These came out delicious. Made the recipe with just a couple of changes. Doubled the recipe to yield 24 muffins. Used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of a second 1/2 cup of butter. Added 1/2 of juice from squeezed lemon to batter instead of vanilla, and rest of juice to the 1/4 cup sugar mashed with zest to spread on top of warm baked muffins. Folded in a couple of cups of mixed berries (saskatoons, blueberries, raspberries)into batter just before spooning into muffin pan. These came out great baked without papers in my silicone muffin pan. Will try half whole wheat flour and just blueberries when I make them again.
