Easy, peasy, delicious. And so healthy - I used Boar's Head All Natural Roast Beef.

Great summer dish for the heat waves! Used normal cucumbers, since I could not find seedless in German grocery stores and let it sit for an hour as other reviewers suggested before digging in!

This was such a surprising flavor combination. I loved it! Very good for summertime.

This was so quick and easy I could hardly believe it. It had great fresh flavor. I used some leftover beef from last night's grill, and fresh pineapple. I really didn't expect my teenagers to like it but they ate every last bit. The combination of hot pepper flakes, fish sauce, shallots, and fresh pineapple was so delicious. No leftovers. Only thing about this salad, both kids went right to the fridge after dinner looking for more food. Not a main dish salad so be warned. Practically perfect otherwise though.

This recipe is very different than anything I've had before. I really liked the flavor, but I think the amount fish sauce weirded my husband out a little. I will probably try again in the summer.

i agree with the previous reviewer, let the salad sit for an hour or so before serving. very easy and quick - tasty.

Quick and easy to prepare. I'd recommend putting it in the fridge for an hour or two with some of the dressing to let everything meld and chill. Lovely midweek dish!
