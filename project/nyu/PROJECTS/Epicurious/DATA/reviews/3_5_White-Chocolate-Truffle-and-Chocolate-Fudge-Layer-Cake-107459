I do a lot of baking and I also had trouble with the filling of this cake: either frozen solid or too runny to use :( I don't want to be too negative because I also used only one cup of white chocolate and maybe that made it too runny......

This is an elegant cake that I have made for years especially around the holidays. I top the cake with large bittersweet chocolate curls. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe. I did make some changes, but very few. I followed the advice of some reviewers and put half the butter called for in the filling/frosting. I also added 1/4 teasp. salt in the filling along with the almond. Cuts the sweetness and and enhances the flavor. I baked the cakes about eight minutes less than required. It was perfect. I used the Amaretto, and I think it is a good idea to do so for the taste of the cake. I had no problem with the filling or frosting. Made everything the night before and refrigerated both the 1 1/2 cup filling and whipped cream frosting. Put together the next morning and KEPT CAKE REFRIGERATED. It was a great success.

Made it for my sister in law's birthday and was somewhat disappointed. For the amount of effort required the fruit of my labor was just not worth it. Granted, it was better than a store bought cake/mix. Maybe a few mods would help it out a bit but I'm not willing to try this one again.

This is my "varsity" cake, made only for someone loved or really cared about. It is divine! I often add on top of the white chocolate filling a layer of raspberry jam/spreadable fruit, or omit the white chocolate filling altogether and apply only the fruit layer. Also, if I have them, I garnish with fresh raspberries at the base of the cake. I agree with other reviewers about the filling, which I use much less of as filling than is called for as the first few times I made this most people found it to be too sweet and over-the-top, then freeze the rest for the next cake's frosting. I use the recommended amount of butter for the filling, but DO definitely freeze/chill as directed. Always gets rave reviews, and folks always, yes, always, want seconds.

I have a food science degree and culinary background and think this is a fabulous recipe. I follow the directions exactly which is unusual for me and it come out wonderful. The cake is moist and dense. The key to the cake as with all chocolate desserts, underbake. Remove cake when crumbs still stick to your toothpick. I have had no problem with filling and frosting, but do make everything the day before assembly. I don't make chocolate stars for the top, but a mound of chocolate curls intstead. Enjoy!!!

Every time I make this cake I get rave reviews. In fact, I had two people ask me for this recipe this week. The filling doesn't work for me, so all I do is whip up the cream and add about 4 ounces (not a pound) of the white chocolate and use that for both the frosting and the filling. You can make it ahead and just whip the air back into it if you need to. It cuts down on the time it takes to make the cake and it's less expensive when you don't use so much white chocolate). I also don't use the amaretto - it'd probably be good but again, it's easier and cheaper not to, and the cake is really moist already. I also beat the completed batter for about a minute and a half before pouring into the pans, and I use Baker's Joy to spray the pans and paper down with. Easier to use, plus it makes a nice "crust" that's easy to frost.

I made this recipe one time exactly the way they have it listed just to try it. While the cake was very good I preferred my own recipe for chocolate fudge cake - it's fudgier. Once I adjusted the filling and cream mixtures to stabilize them more, I ended up with what everyone says is the best chocolate cake they ever ate (other than my dark chocolate truffle fudge cake:) Thank goodness for the inspiration this recipe provided.

Rating: 4
This was the best cake I ever had! I had some problems with the cake itself. It was a bit crumbly but I think it had to do with the pan I baked them in and not the recipe. I used half the amount of butter in the filling as suggested by others. I whipped the filling a bit to get a good spreading consistency. Everything else went well. As long as the cake stayed refrigerated, I had no problems with the filling or topping. The ingredients were a bit expensive but it was totally worth it. I will definitely be making this again!

Rating: 4
This was great, and not too difficult. I reduced the amount of butter as per suggestions. The only thing is that it does melt, I wouldn't take it to a party or a pot-luck since it'll likely be sitting out on a table and the frosting will be not so nice, and the chocolate stars will start to fall off the cake and droop a little themselves.

Count me among those who had trouble with the filling. It was firm out of the freezer -- too firm to spread. Then, within instants, it thawed to the consistency of honey. Not the right consistency for a filling, though tasty.

Fantastic!!!! I made this taking the advice of several reviews. I used only 2tbls of butter in the frosting, rather than 4 and I used 12 oz of guittard white chocolate. When it came to the cake, I made my list, went to the store and found that some of the ingredients were very expennsive. This is for my son's birhday and we have already spent too much, so, went to the box cake isle and found a double chocolate cake and used that. Instead of ameretto, I used a chocolate ganache. I put it on while the ganache was still warm, so it would absorbe into the cake. WOW!!!! Will most definaetly make this again. Next time, I will make the cake too!

This was fantastic! I was concerned after reading the horror stories, but the cake turned out beautifully. I reduced the butter to 2 tbsp for the frosting and used 4 Lindt white chocolate bars (a little less than a pound). I made the frosting and filling a day beforehand and left it in the fridge overnight. The filling became too stiff for me to spread the next day, and I had to wait a while for it to come to room temperature. I assembled the cake and stuck it back in the fridge. The guests were impressed with how it turned out..it looked better than it did in the picture!

Made it for my 12 yr old son's birthday and he loved it. The high fat content of the filling resulted in a goo even after freezing for 24 hrs. Would like to know of anyone used different filling ingredients to firm it up - I used good white choc and white baking chips. I wonder if less butter would help or if using a bit (not much) of almond bark would help.

This is a FABULOUS cake, great for any type of CELEBRATION! I have made this on many occasions. You can use your favorite chocolate cake recipe or use a cake mix following the butter recipe and you will still end up with an AMAZING cake! Start two or three days ahead. The filling and frosting require set up time and are easier to work with if chilled properly. The chocolate stars can be changed into any appropriate shape to suit your presentation. I have used hearts, stars, dog bones, firefighter hats and various other shapes to create a special occasion cake. Have fun, and ENJOY! =))

Oh wow!!! This cake was delicious!! I made it for my Mother-in-law's birthday. The whip cream frosting was not as stiff as I had hoped, but the filling was perfect. Some said they over cooked the cake so I didnt cook it so long and ended up with a brownie type of consistancy. I didnt have any cutters to make the stars so I just drizzled the chocolate on top in thin streams and put small silver ball sprinkles on it. It still look pretty nice. It really helps if you make the frosting, filling and chocolate a day ahead and just leave the cakes to bake the day of. Then all you will have to do is put it all together. All in all, I would make this cake again and I would definately recommend it to others. You will absolutely want to have a second slice of cake..

Very delicious chocolate cake recipe. Chocolaty and dense. I was pressed for time, so instead of chilling filling and icing separate, I chilled the entire white chocolate mixture overnight, then separated the filling amount from what went into the frosting. Than for the frosting, I simply added the chilled white chocolate mix to the cream and beat slightly to retain peaks. Came out beautifully. As stated before, definitely keep the filling chilled as it does get a little loose.

Ive yet to try the icing, as Im not a huge fan of white chocolate, but Ive made the cake 3 or 4 times now, and it gets consistent rave reviews. Fantastic as cupcakes with a basic white buttercream frosting flavored with Grand Marnier, delish with a milk chocolate icing. Im making a tiered cake with it for our engagement party, and sent the practice layers that I made yesterday - sans icing, just a dusting of powdered sugar so as to be semi-presentable- looking - to work with the beau and hes been getting accolades from his coworkers all day! I highly recommend this recipe; its a tender, moist, delicious cake thats earned me many compliments!

This cake was not nearly as difficult as so many reviewers said. I made everything the day before -- left the filling in the freezer and the wrapped cake and frosting in the refrigerator overnight. It all went together easily the next day. If I make this again, I might bake the cakes five minutes less. Everyone raved about this cake.

I was happy with the end result of this cake, it looked impressive and tasted good as well. I definitely have a few recommendations: I followed other's advice to cook the cake for less time, just under 30 was more than enough. Also I think the key to the filling is keeping it basically frozen, I let mine chill in the fridge after freezing and when I applied it it just oozed out all over and I basically lost 75% of it so I lost the beautiful white layer between the cakes. Same goes for the whipped topping, it was not stiff enough and didn't stand up like a real frosting. I chilled it in the freezer for a short period of time and rewhipped it and it was great. So all in all things have to be cold and stiff. The stars looked great and I sifted a little cocoa powder on the top. Definitely dying to try this again.

I made this cake, the month it was released in the magazine. It was a fair bit of work,but the results were well worth it.

It turned out very rich and moist, all components were excellent and the presentation was gorgeous, definitely a keeper.

This cake was excellent and the absolute hit of the party. Even though it appeared uber complicated, it really wasn't too bad, but very time consuming, as all the ingredients need to be very cold. I used a cake mix like another reviewer to save time and it turned out fabulous. The truffle mixture I had to do twice, as the first one seperated a little but, but I think I didn't have enough chocolate. Keep your bowl and whisk attachment very cold (in freezer overnight) for the frosting and I added a pinch of non-flavored gelatin (a the advice of an experienced cook) to the frosting which helped keep the peaks. Take your time and it will turn out. Make sure its chilled after frosting to firm up all ingredients before serving. People couldn't get over the cake and I was very proud.

We loved this cake. I will undercook the cakes the next time as they were a bit too dry. But the filling was fantastic and the frosting great too. Wasn't as smooth of a frosting as I like, but tasted great. And the stars made it look so beautiful! (I also had butterflies). Definitely a keeper.

I was nervous about making this cake after reading all the problems people had but my husband wanted me to try it for our New Year's Party. This cake was a HUGE success! My sister said it was the best thing I'd ever made and after serving everyone and then tasting it myself, I had to agree. I didn't have Amaretto so I used 4 Tbsp apple brandy (Caldavos) and added 1 tsp of almond extract. I made 4 layers and put the truffle layer in the middle one. I lined the edge of the middle layer with whipped cream before pouring the truffle filling into it. I also re-whipped the cream-truffle frosting mixture to keep it very stiff before spreading over the cake. Didn't have cooking spray so I dipped my cookie cutters in Crisco before eat cut. And finally, I sprinkled very coarse sanding sugar and silver dragees for a festive New Year's effect! I kept the cake in the "walk-in-cooler" (aka the garage here in cold wintered Minnesota) until ready to serve then put it back out there afterwards. This is definitely a keeper recipe!!!

And of course I used Belgian chocolate: Cote d'Or, perhaps that makes a difference too for the filling...

I made the cake for our family Christmas lunch. Everyone loved it! I didn't add the almond flavour to the whipped cream icing, but I did add the amaretto on the cakes. There was too much whipped cream icing, so I put the leftovers in glasses as a chocolate mousse. I used 40% cream, the highest content of fat that you can get in Belgium, and the best for whipping. I whipped a bit more after adding the chocolate mixture, and it certainly wasn't runny as some claimed here. I guess they didn't use the proper cream, or didn't whip the cream long enough... Delicious, and I'll make it again!

I made this cake for Christmas dinner. I made 2 other desserts and this one won hands down. The one small issue is with the frosting. It was really good as it is very light, but you have to keep the cake refrigerated once completed or the frosting starts to run at room temperature. I made it ahead of time and put it in the fridge. I took it out at dessert time and the frosting was room temperature but the cake was still cold and hence was a little heavy. This cake, I think, is best made and served immediately. You can make the cakes ahead of time and wrap them, but I'd suggest doing the frosting, chilling it, and then assemble the cake and serve immediately for best results.

I made this recipe to take to a 50th birthday party. I was short on time and wanted to let some of the ingredients get really cold so I started the day before. I made the cake layers a day ahead and let them cool and then wrapped them in saran wrap and let them sit at room temperature overnight. I made the filling and put it in the refrigerator overnight. I also made the frosting and whipped it fairly firm and then put in the refrigerator overnight. The next day I sliced the cake layers in half and was going to put the filling in between the layers, however, the filling was too runny. The same problem others have had. If I were to make this again, I would add some cornstarch to the cream and butter and let it thicken slightly and then add the white chocolate and refrigerate. I really think that it needs some thickening agent. Anyway, I ended up throwing out the filling and using vanilla pudding in the middle (to which I had added some white chocolate). I re-whipped the whipping cream until firm and then put the cake together. It tasted wonderful. Don't leave out he Amaretto! It adds a lot to the overally flavor. Make sure to whip the cream firm or it won't stay on the outside of the cake.

I made this for a friend for her birthday; I'm not as big of a fan of white chocolate as she is, so maybe thats why I'm only giving it 3 forks. My filling was just fine, and the frosting was a little too slippery but I blame that entirely on my not whipping it firm enough. I am not sure why so many people had problems...July in Chicago is not exactly the greatest time of year for keeping ingredients cool, and it worked out okay for me. Follow the directions, use good white chocolate (I used Callebaut) and hopefully you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 4
Unlike other reviewers I had no problem with the filling running. I split the cake into four layers (badly) and even skimped on chilling time. My fridge tends to freeze everything even on the low setting so that might have had something to do with it. I realized too late that I didn't have enough vanilla extract for the filling and frosting, so I tripled the almond, and Thank God, because it was divine. There were a lot of 'oh wow's' when I served it. I skipped the amaretto step because I was too lazy to go the liquor store. Everything other direction was followed to a tee, and the cake turned out pretty darn good, or magnificent really considering it was my first cake from scratch. I used ghirardelli, and I agree with other posters that this is an expensive cake, but well worth it in my opinion.

If you want to impress your guests, this is the cake! My guests actually clapped! I did have some trouble with the filling oozing over the sides but it was easy to cover up with the frosting. Instead of stars I used other assorted "Christmasy" cookie cutter shapes (e.g. Christmas trees, sled, Santa, etc.) which made it very festive. Give yourself time for this cake. It is fun to make, as long as you're not rushed.

Made for my sister's annual Chocolate Christmas party to rave reviews! Instead of the stars, I crushed peppermints and put over the side of the cake. Other changes: Eliminated the butter from the white chocolate mixture (No oozing). Made and refrigerated cakes overnight. Mixed the whipping cream & lukewarm chocolate, refrigerated overnight and whipped VERY stiff the next day. (Kept the 1 1/2 cups truffle mixture at room temp). Split each cake to make 4 layers (two per layer). I used the 1/2 of the truffle filling between layer #2/#3 (whipped cream for others). Used remaining truffle to make a crumb coat for the cake. Very sweet, very dense cake. My sister wants the recipe!

I made this version of this cake for an anniversary party. It was amazing!! The couple didn't want to share it with their guests. If youre making this cake be patient and let the frosting cool for the same abount of time as the center. I replaced the stars with chocolate hearts and shavings and used raspberry liqour in place of the Ammaretto.

I'm not sure why everyone was having problems with this cake. I adored it and it turned out perfectly. The only thing I can think of is that this is a cake that you can not rush while making it. You really need to cool the chocolate mixture to room temp before folding into the whipped cream - that is a critical step. Also, the filling MUST be chilled before you put it between the layers. As another cook noted when filling a cake you should always put a line of the whipped cream around the edge of the cake and then put the filling on the cake layer to keep the filling from coming out (although even after cutting I did not have a problem with the filling moving.) This actually made more whipped cream icing then I prefer so I used the remaining whipped cream for in my morning coffee - very tastey.

I have been making this cake since it was the cover recipe back in '02. I am baking it yet again today and thought I would add my review. I am utterly SHOCKED at the low reviews, I would have thought a 4 star from everyone!! This is my husband's all-time favorite dessert and he gets it each year on his birthday. I choose to simplify by using Duncan Hines' Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and add 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the batter. The frosting and truffle is enough work with two little kids running around! Then I do the recipe as described with the following additions: I cut my layers in half to make it a four-layer cake, put additional frosting on layers 1 and 3 with a coating of chocolate sprinkles, then put the truffle on layer 2. It is amazing and beautiful. If you are a white chocolate mousse fan you will dream about this cake long after it has been finished. Try it!! I promise you will love it.

I found this cake to be on the dry side, perhaps because I used a very high cocoa % chocolate. Other than that I had no problems with oozing, in fact I never bothered to chill at all, but I do have a very cold kitchen. If I make it again I'd be more liberal with the Amaretto and frost right away to ensure cake moistness. Everyone who ate the cake was impressed, it vanished in SECONDS.

Rating: 4
This was SO good -- we do a "fabulous chocolate dessert" for Christmas dinner every year and this was one of the best we've done. You do need to keep all ingredients COLD! to keep the truffle from oozing, as noted. Next time, I might make more truffle whipped cream and make it both the filling and the frosting -- the pure truffle filling was a bit rich and there was that oozing problem.

Well, I must say I am glad I had not read the reviews for this one! I made it from the magazine, and it was delicious, beautiful, and a huge hit with my guests for Christmas dinner. I was making other deserts, so had prepared the filling one day ahead, and put both portions in the refrigerator, and it was very thick the next day. I actually warmed the part to be added to whipped cream, as it said to use it lukewarm. Everything went together smoothly, and stayed together. Maybe those who had runny fillings and frostings didn't chill enough or beat the cream stiff enough. I would suggest you try again....this cake is too good to be missed! :-)

I decided to make this cake for the first family Christmas dinner me and my husband hosted. I have to say that after reading all the negative and disastrous reviews I was a little afraid of it and had already braced myself for disaster. It all went perfect! I guess because i heeded the advice of many reviewers (chill everything thuroughly before assembly; Thank you everybody!!) When it came time to assemble, I worked fast and when done, stuck the whole thing back in the fridge. Nothing slid, moved or otherwise. As far as the amount of work is concerned: i really didn't think it was that much work; the usual workload when making a cake from scratch i would say. Everybody loved it (even those not big on choc. cake), but all agreed it was very, very rich. Cut the slices thin!

I have made many cake recipes and mostly all of them came out perfect, except this one!!! Three hours is NOT enough time for the fillng to freeze. Almost all the filling leaked out of the cake and I had to invent another filling...horrible. I really should have followed the other's suggestions. I'm never making this cake again!! Waste of money.

Rating: 4
what a memorable cake! don't let the others scare you. i followed the recipe and it was not difficult. making it in the cold january may have helped. to prevent any filling from running, you should pipe some frosting around the edge of the bottom layer to contain the filling. i decided to add well drained frozen raspberries (12oz) on top of the filling. i think it added a flavor of even more magnificent than the original recipe. the fine chocolate was pricy but have you priced cakes at the finer bakeries?

I actually thought the cake was a little dry and dense, although I think I used 2 c. flour and then sifted that (that's the measurement in the actual magazine issue). Now it says 1 3/4 c. flour, sifted, which would probably make it less dense. I might have overcooked it, hence it being dry. I too had trouble with the icing oozing despite being in the freezer for 3 hours. I never thought about the pricey aspect of the cake - it's still a lot cheaper than buying a store bought cake. The frosting was so yummy!

I too made this for Christmas and the filling oozed despite the freezing. This recipe should be revised so that the filling isn't so troublesome. Fortunately, the rest of the cake turned out wonderfully and my guests loved it. I used hazelnut liquor and extract instead of the almond. Very tasty!

I made this cake for Christmas, and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone nicknamed it "Death By Chocolate!" It wasn't difficult to make, though it didn't turn out perfectly. My filling did ooze out, but it still tasted and looked incredible. I blamed the oozing on not freezing it like the recipe suggests (I'll test this theory next time I make it). I made the filling and frosting the night before and thought leaving it in the fridge all night would be sufficient. The frosting was perfect. I even cut out the stars by hand with a paring knife because I couldn't find cookie cutters, and they were perfect. I would recommend putting a little more amaretto on the cake than the recipe calls for though - YUM!

This is a really good, moist, chocolate flavorful cake. But-as others have noted, with the best of ingrediants a pricey cake. So, it may not be worth all the money if you have a good chocolate cake recipe you already love. I did love the white chocolate filling to contrast with the rest.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday for the third year in a row, but will never make it again. While it is absolutely delicious, it is far too expensive, if, like me, you use top quality ingredients, and far too time consuming to do it right. I finally figured out that you have to chill, chill, chill everything, cake and all, for longer than the recipe says in order for the filling not to run out between the layers and the frosting to not slip down the sides. You also need to chill between steps and even half steps. And there is far too much frosting for the cake. Make it if you want a really rich, decadent show stopper, but chill, chill, chill.

Rating: 1
Bigger that Uluru, too expensive. And far to fiddly. If you like chocolate, I would say eat this and die. If I were to make this cake again I would not put the "white truffle" in the centre but use the frosting cream for filling and icing. I decided that I wanted two cakes so reversed the ingredients. One cake dark chocolate and the other a white cake. But did not use white chocolate in cake mixture. For the white cake I put a brown chocolate truffle in the centre which set without refridging. Pressed slices of marzipan into cake and baked. Iced it with brown chocolate and cream frosting. I also cut down on the sugar in the cake as I made a basic white cake mixture. Both cakes were massive but so time consuming to make. Waiting 2 to 3 hours for frosting and truffle to set is really not to be considered if you want to "knock up" a quick chocolate cake. I will stick to my own recipe and leave this one for the bored and adventurous who has time to kill.

OK, despite the number of people having problems with this recipe, we decided to try it out. First thing we did was make sure that the whip cream was beaten *very* stiff for the filling, second thing was to allow lots of time for everything to get good and chilled. We had absolutely no problems putting this together. I suspect a warm kitchen, or a humid kitchen could present a challenge with this, but as long as everything is kept cold it should work out fine. Taste wise, this was extremely good, although very, very rich. I would suggest that serving sizes be kept small, maybe 24 slices to a cake. Everyone seemed to love it (a couple folks requested the recipe) and all commented on the ensuing sugar rush from eating this. Remember that chocolate is the star in this recipe and don't cheap out on low quality ingredients.

Of four cakes worth of this recipe that I made for a wedding of 60 people, it was hard to save one slice. The cake had the perfect mix of dark rich chocolate flavor with light whipped cream almond frosting to cut the sweetness.

I tried this for my daughter's birthday. I had problems with the filling and the frosting was too soft. I ended up filling and frosting the cake with plain old chocolate buttercream and it was fine. I still have the filling but I used the whipped cream and chocolate "frosting" and put it in my guests' coffee! I'm going to try the cake again and see how it works out this time.

I made this cake twice. The first time was for my daughter's birthday. Everyone loved it. The cake was easy to make. It baked nicely and evenly. The filling was a mess. The frosting was great, but it didn't look like I was hoping it would. My daughter is my worst critic, she loved it. The second time I made it, I used 3/4 of a cup of cream instead of 1 full cup to the LB. of white choc. It was thicker. I used only 1 cup of the filling instead of the one and half that the recipe calls for.The last cake I made I had too much filling. Left the filling in the freezer for 8 hours, it was hard as a rock. So I put it in the refrig. for about another 3 hours. When I went to put the cake together the filling was still hard so I warmed it up a bit and it soften well. This cake was a square 9" pan and the filling was just the right amount. It was very thick and it stayed in it place. The frosting was lumping because the choc. started to harden maybe because I used less cream to melt the choc. But it was O.K. I also was using more filling mixture in the frosting due to the fact that I only used 1 cup of filling. The frosting was thicker and creamer. Over all it was delicious!!! It looked good to, better than the first one. I will defintly make it again.

The cake was ok. The icing and filling was a disaster and I followed it to the T and would consider myself to be an experienced baker. There were too many steps and I was very disappointed. This recipe taught me to read reviews first! I would use the chocolate star idea on another layer cake recipe - they were very cute and you can change the cut-out to fit the occasion.

I've made this cake three times. While it is delicious and a real crowd pleaser, I've found the frosting to be incredibly runny. I usually end of frosting half the cake, putting back in the fridge and trying again. Anyone have any suggestions on how to firm up the frosting?

I've read most of the reviews and I've got a suggestion to those who have problems with dry cakes. Make a "syrup" of: 1 part water to half part sugar by dissolving the sugar completely in a sauce pan. Cool. Put this "sugar water" in a candy making bottle fitted with the pour spout and squeeze over any cake. The amounts vary. I go over the cake 2-3 times with this mixture and then layer and ice my cake as usual. You can also try to add flavored coffee syrups or butter/almond extracts.

It tasted delicious but... like many other reviewers... my filling would not stay in the middle of the cake! I even put it in the freezer for several hours. I don't know the answer, maybe less cream for the filling? I'd like to perfect it... because this cake is really special. Love the stars!

Tip for first-time users: read the reviews first. The cake is a really-not-too-bad chocolate cake, but frosting and filling were disasters. Frosting curdled and couldn't be repaired, even with helpful tips from previous victims. Filling did not set up properly, and was too sweet. I finally punted, scraped as much off as possible and frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting. Instead of stars, I did various shapes and sizes of cats. Too cute.

Oh, my lands. This is the BEST cake I have ever made. The filling was heavenly, and the frosting was deemed to be "addictive" by my boyfriend, whom I made it for as a birthday cake (and who's not even particularly into sweets!). I'm physically restraining myself from heading to the kitchen to gobble up the leftovers right this minute. I made no modifications to the recipe, except one - I did add 4Tbsp confectioner's sugar to the frosting, as Singapore suggested. Also, I didn't worry in the least about overbeating it. It turned out great! The cake itself was moist and fudgy. I'll DEFINITELY be making it again, at the first opportunity!

I was scared by all the comments about puddly frosting so I used confectioners suger to stabilise the whipped cream (2 tablespoons per cup of cream). This worked well, no water at all and the slightly sweeter frosting went well with the intensity of the cake (used 85% choc). You could use gelatin as a previous reviewer suggested but I couldn't bear the thought. The cake itself was not dry at all which some reviewers found - try covering the cake when cooling it or transfer to an unused microwave(airtight) but beware of old lingering smells, chocolate bacon cake is gross. I got a bit of oozing of the filling so chilled it at every possible moment: Spread filling, chill, spread frosting, chill. I agree that the proportion of the cream to white choc for the filling is suspect. Or perhaps the fat content of the cream makes a difference. I used 35% fat, will try 45% next time. Or perhaps just use the frosting for the filling instead. Overall, excellent and delicious after X'mas dinner! loved by everyone and a nice change from the usual dark chocolate. A great use of white choc - I've always shied away from white but went for this after the great reviews. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone having 2nd thoughts.

I also had difficulty with layering. The icing would not hold between the layers and oozed everywhere. I ended up throwing the entire cake away after my icing (top) showed the texture of cottage cheese (this may have been a cooling issue - I had guests stop over while I was baking...). I may try again for pride's sake - but will have to have plan B ready and waiting.

Quite sinsational flavors. A very serious cake that's not has difficult as a first reading suggests. My problem was that the filling between the layers did not adhere very well, oozing out the sides, despite being quite well chilled. I'm not sure how to correct this beyond chilling it even more. The outer frosting, whipped cream with white chocolate is heavenly

Rating: 1
What a mess. I let the chocolate filing chill for over 6 hours in the freezer and when I put it on the bottom layer it oozed everywhere. The icing is not holding on to the sides very well either. I am supposed to bring this to a brunch tomorrow and it's chilling the the fridge right now - I hope I can salvage it - what an expensive mess! The easiest part of this whole recipe was making the stars. It was to time consuming to even attempt to get this right a second time around.

I made this cake for two birthday parties, first in late December last year for a friend who owns a high end Italian Bakery and again in August for my epicurian sister's birthday (challenging crowds to impress), and the frosting broke both times. First time, even though I was stranded with a pint of skim milk to drink along with the cake, it was absolutely the most decadant, delicate, flavorful, perfect cake I had ever eaten. For it, I used the best ingredients I could find, including very high quality Valrhona chocolates, fresh cream from a local dairy, and organic butter. Second time, I left the cakes cooling in the pans too long and they dried out. The cream didn't break quite as much as the first time, but, it was challenging to spread. I'll make it again.

I thought this cake seemed dry, but it was just very dense. Everyone loved it, I think it is better the second day. For a special touch I melted white chocolate and colored it green and red, and drizzled it over the stars. Added a bit of color and looked amazing!

Rating: 3
The frosting and filling were so delish and I didn't have trouble with consistency. I did want to make it for a larger crowd, so added a third layer. Is there any way to add such a layer that the cake doesn't tilt? That drives me mad! Any ideas? I baked for someone else, so didn't have an actual "piece" but did put crumbs, filling, and frosting together and it was great!

Rating: 2
I agree with the previous reviewer - there's a lot to say about this cake. For me, I'll be using the cake recipe again and again and again. But when I made the cake the first time, at the last minute, I went with a cream cheese frosting, as I just didn't trust the consistency of the cream frosting I made. I got rave reviews despite the frosting switch, so I'm sticking to that combination. It's worth taking the time to make the stars - it really finishes it off.

Rating: 3
This is a very good filling and very good whipped cream frosting though I am not sure that I am going to use the same cake next time. I made it once with a boxed cake actually and it made for an easy alternative and still received raves! The light whipped frosting is a nice contrast to the dark cake.

Rating: 4
This has to be the most contentious recipe ever published. I've made the whole recipe 2 times, and have used just the cake (with other icings) on several occasions. I will never use any other chocolate cake recipe again. The icing is good too - just takes a long time, and sometimes it is just easier to go with a different effect. I had trouble with the icing the first time - I obviously didn't beat it long enough, as I was afraid of overbeating it. Didn't have the same problems the second time. for the people who "doctor" the recipe - you can't really review THIS recipe if you've changed it. you're creating a different one - good thing to do sometimes, but your reviews don't make much sense to me since you're dealing with an entirely different cake. And for the person who added a review though he/she admitted he/she didn't even USE the recipe but used a duncan hines cake mis - what are you even doing here? I got a good laugh out of it though.

I had wanted something very special for my husbands 45th bday and being a chocolate afficiondo this recipe turned me on. However, I did find the cake to be a little on the dry side. I have read the other comments and no one mentioned that. I will make again, but may look at beating less and adding another egg. Mary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

I have made this cake many times because everyone always raves about it. It can be made in one day, refridgerate the frosting and filling for a longer period of time. The flavors blend perfectly. It is a dense cake with a light frosting and rich filling. Make it if you want to make a huge impression!

I used the frosting/filling recipe with another cake. The filling is wonderful... the frosting separated. It could be the humidity, but when I went to retrieve the cake to serve it after several hours, there was a puddle of water on the serving tray. I'd recommend draining the frosting in some cheesecloth or a fine sieve as it sets in the fridge prior to putting it on the cake. I mopped up the mess - luckily it didn't soak the cake, and it was tasty!

I am not a baker. But this recipe was fairly easy and each time I made it raves came from our guests. I don't bother with the chocolate stars. The cake is great with just shaved choclate from a Hersey bar.

This was the most amazing cake I had ever tasted... admittedly, I did add a little something extra: raspberry curd between each layer. I also cut the cakes in half to create 4 layers. I thought that the cake itself was very dark and fudgy, and I had no problem at all with the filling being too thin. In fact, I used extra white chocolate as others had suggested, and I would say that my filling was actualy a little too thick! I also went cheap on the filling & just used a bag of Ghiradelli white chips with excellent results. The frosting was unbelievable good and made for easy assembly and beautiful presentation. I will make this cake for any extra special occasion in the future. It is very rich and delicious... and I'll always add the raspberry curd too!

I have made this cake three times (always omitting the Amaretto, because many of my friends don't drink, and subsitituting vanilla extract for the almond extract). I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate and cocoa, and Ghirardelli white chocolate (from Trader Joe's). It came out perfect every time! I have not had trouble with the filling being runny; in fact, I left it in the freezer for three hours last time and it was so firm I had to let it sit for 30 minutes before I could use it. Everyone I have served this cake to loved it, and several people had seconds. The last time I made the cake, I revised the order in which I made the components, and my way was more efficient. I made the filling first, then the frosting, then the stars, and finally the cake. (The filling has to freeze for two hours and the frosting must chill for three, which can happen while the cake is baking.) One word of caution: make sure to keep this cake chilled after assembling it; otherwise, the frosting loses its fluffy appearance. It's still delicious, though!

To be honest, I was in a hurry when I made this cake, and skipped the cake recipe, using boxed cake instead. However, I followed the frosting and filling recipe. We LOVED it! I made it again to take to work and it was a HUGE hit. (I did skip the Amaretto, however) The first two times I made it, I used Nestle white chocolate chips. Make the filling and frosting a day ahead and it sets up fine. The third time I made it I did so for a bake sale, so decided to buy a better quality of white chocolate like the recipe suggests. It failed to set! I would HIGHLY recommend using the white chocolate chips instead. They not only taste better, they also set up better. HAVE FUN! This is a delicious recipe!

Took this on over the Thanksgiving holiday. Like other reviewers, this cake was a project. The filling was a bit oozy, and the cake lost a bit of its shape when sliced. HOWEVER I really liked the density and richness of the cake and have made it again, frosting it with my own chocolate icing.

This cake is pretty labor-intensive. I wasn't wild about it - too sweet and runny. We ate about half of it at a dinner party and I took the other half to a friends party, which I dropped on the street. Always an interesting experience in New York. People are so sympathetic over a dropped cake. who knew? The cake is lovely once all assembled - runny filling or not. Perhaps that's the key to a little attention - drop lovely cakes in NYC.

I made this for my grandmother's birthday. Followed the directions exactly, and had the filling run all over everywhere. Cake was okay, not the best chocolate cake I'd ever made, but not the worst either. Had no problem with the frosting. Used tempered chocolate instead of adding shortening (YUCK!) to the melted chocolate for the stars. And to the patronizing cook from Minneapolis, even following the directions exactly will not guarantee good results on this cake. As I am baking professionally, I do have just a bit of relavent baking experience.

This cake is wonderful, and I can't wait to make it, I had had it at a friends and couldn't wait to try it, she had a problem with the frosting as mentioned by other reviewers so I was aware that I might have a problem with the frosting. The only step that I took to prevent it was chilling the white chocolate in the freezer longer and applying the frosting rather slowly and layering it because it is undoubtedly worth the trouble, our friends had seconds and want me to make it again!

I made this cake twice, once for Christmas Eve- and it was gone before some people got any, which did not make my mother very happy!- and got more raves than any I've ever baked. I made it for a dinner party a few weeks later and so far a half dozen of those guests have emailed me for the recipe. I followed the directions exactly, but when I put the filling on the bottom layer I then put it on the porch for an hour or so (in Boston, the porch is colder than the freezer at this time of year!) then put on the second layer. You need to be daring with whipping the cream, if you're afraid of overdoing it will not hold. My son's friend offered to plow our driveway all winter if I make him one of these at the end of the season!

I froze the filling for 2 hours, as the recipe stated. When I assembeled the cake, the filling wouldn't stay on top of the bottom layer and all slid off the sides onto the plate, and all over the fridge. This turned out to be a very expensive mess.

#1 I used my favourite Duncan Hines Mix and added extra melted chocolate to the mix.......great #2 Next time I will not add as much whipped cream and more melted white chocolate... #3 Make sure the filling for center is 24 hrs chilled.

In order to get the icing to stay put, I had to mix in some dissolved geletin, some liquid parafin wax, half gallon of carpenters' glue, a shovelfull of straw, a sack of quick-set cement, and some re-bar. It was beautiful (and delicious!)

This was fun to make and not at all difficult. It did call for a little too much whipped cream as I threw a lot of it out. For the garnish, I only used 3 cutout stars and laid them flat on the cake. Very cute!

What a waste of fine ingredients! The filling was way overboard in quantity, and within 5 minutes of assembly, ran out the sides and made a big mess. I ended up scraping off the excess and didn't even attempt to recycle it for another time - it just wasn't good enough. Only the stars will make it to another, better recipe.

Good thing this disaster was going to good friends for dessert. Never experienced such a mess - my husband and I were in in hysterics as we watched it slip-sliding away in the car. The filling ran out, the top fell to the side and the frosting seemed to have a life of its' own. I thoroughly chilled everything, even froze the cake in the afternoon. There is NO hope for this recipe. (Guess I should have read the reviews first...) oh yeah. The stars are cute...

This was absolutely beautiful on the front of the magazine, and I was insipired to make it for a holiday party this season. I was disappointed, however, in the texture of both the cake and the filling. The cake was dry, and the filling was sticky and runny. Additionally, I found that the stars were best removed as soon as you cut them, rather than allowing to sit thiry minutes--they became brittle and much harder to remove. Cut them out and lift them immediately from the surrounding chocolate. The next time I wanted this effect, I made my old favorite rich chocolate cake and white buttercream, put the stars on top, and I think it was far better tasting(and certainly less time-consuming and expensive) than the results from this recipe.

This was admittedly delicious, but I agree with NY, NY -- it was a loooong way to go for a good chocolate cake. None of my guests were "wowed" enough to make a comment. Next time I'll do myself a favor and order a cake from Bristol Farms and spend the rest of the day with my family.

I haven't made the cake but did it occur to anyone that the widely differing filling/frosting results may be due to the use of either pastuerized or ultra-pasteurized whipping cream? It makes a big difference sometimes.

I read the reviews for this recipe before making it with my girlfriend for another couples anniversary. I woke up early on Friday morning and got to her house at 10:30 when we started. Upon icing the cake over 5 hours had passed and it was about 3:30. I had the best time ever and came out with the best results. I will deffinately make this cake again. We took turns licking the spatula that we folded the outer layer of refrigerating icing with. My girlfriend and I are only 16 years of age and had great results... so if you can't make this cake... then you need help.

Made this cake for a dinner party for 12. I didn't think it was a lot of trouble to make, but I did have to leave my filling in the freezer for 4 hours to keep it from running off of the bottom layer. The texture of the cake itself was very good but better the second day, I didn't think it was dry, just dense. Everyone enjoyed and it was very pretty, but I've made better cakes out of Death by Chocolate. Over all I was a little let down. I may use a differant frosting if I made it again, the flavored whipped cream frosting was just OK to me.

I made this cake for a New Year's party we attended. I'm glad I read the previous reviews because they prepared me for the amount of work involved, but it was worth the labor. The finished product was perfect, it looked great and tasted wonderful. The stars are just a great addition.

I made this for new years eve. I did not have unsweetened chocolate to melt so used the appropriate substitution of cocoa and shortening for half and melted semisweet for the remaining. The liquor does help to moisten the cake. I was in a time crunch as I began to frost the cake so froze the filling in a flat dish it ran a bit but not as much as others spoke of. There was a bit much of the filling so I split it into 4 layer yielding not quite enough. Overall though the cake was good and a pretty presentation.

As I am an avid baker, and have tried several other recipes by Mrs Klivans, I made this recipe for a Christmas dinner expecting great results. Thank God I have the experience to "doctor up" baking disasters, because this was. The cake was thick and rich, but as the baker from Enumclaw, WA surmised, the proportions of white chocolate split between the filling and frosting were incorrect, or Mrs. Klivans left out an important step, such as whipping the cooled filling. The filling never thickened in the freezer and did run over the bottom layer. The frosting was ok and held, but once I had the entire thing frosted (had to scrape the runny filling up and try to refreeze the whole cake) I inserted, from the top of the cake, several large wooden skewers to save the top from sliding off the bottom layer. I broke off the skewers close to the top and concealed them with frosting and the stars and pulled the skewers out just before serving. Could the recipe creator review her recipe and comment as to why so many of us had such poor results from a cake that really looked so great in the magazine?

This cake was a smash hit. EVERYBODY loved it, even those who generally aren't cake or lovers of sweets. It looked absolutely phenomenal. I baked the cake layers ahead of time and froze them. I thawed them before adding the filling. Next time I will put the filling directly on the frozen layers. My filling only ran a little and no one could tell once the frosting was on. The recipe said to whip to peaks but didn't specify what kind of peaks, so I did very light peaks. After 3.5 hours in the fridge, my frosting wasn't holding medium peaks. So I just rewhipped the cream to medium peaks. I also made sure that my cake was refrigerated and very cool before spreading the frosting. It was perfect and now, a day later, it is still perfect. The stars were magnificent and I found them quite easy to make. Next time, instead of aluminum foil I will probably put them on a silpat sheet. My mom, who is an expert baker but not a lover of sweets, said this was the best cake I've ever made.

Good thing I was making this for my husband and not company. Either the proportions of cream to white chocolate for the ganache are off (didn't seem likely as I have used various ganache recipes with a larger proportion of cream to white chocolate) or a step was left out - many recipes call for beating the ganache to thicken. It slid it's way over the bottom layer onto the small platter I had put the cake on. The whipped cream icing didn't hold up either - and I have made whipped cream icings before, although only one other with white chocolate in it. I will try again using myown techniques unless someone comes up with a suggestion. The cake itself is wonderfully dark and fudgy -

This cake is FABULOUS! It is the best homemade cake I have ever had, and better than most store bought ones too! I used an organic chocolate cake mix because I didn't have time to try to make the cake and for it to maybe not turn out right. Also, I whipped the cream til it had just stiffened and then whipped in the white chocolate mixture for the frosting (BAD IDEA) to save time, but it ended up kind of curdling. So I just filled the cake with the 1 1/2 C of w choco that had been set aside and frosted it with whipped cream that I had added a little almond extract to. Then I added the stars. It was awesome and everyone loved it. I am making it again today, but this time I am brushing it with more amaretto to make it more moist and because the flavor is wonderful. Also, the stars were a pain to make (but looked cool!), so I am grating white chocolate on the top this time. This is more sofisticated than regular chocolate cake and is just great....

Rating: 1
If you're going to make this cake, make the icing first, then the cake, then the stars. This way the icing can chill while the cake is baking and cooling. Also, I would suggest that you refrigerate the cake so that it is cold, not just cool. Otherwise, the filling is going to melt and the top layer will slide off. However, I wouldn't make this cake ever again. Two failed attempts were more than enough for me.

I wish I'd read the reviews first before spending so much time to make this cake. Much additional time was spent trying to fix it. After 3 hours' freezing, my filling ran off the cake, so I scraped it all up, refroze it for 6 hours, and it still ran! My frosting did not hold up as well, and it slid downward, but not totally off. Luckily my cake dish had sides. It looked more like a round castle surrounded by a moat of whipped cream and white chocolate. The cake was too dense and hard to cut. I found the stars easy to make and at least THEY looked good. It did taste good, though, despite terrible presentation.

Rating: 1
Here is what I think: The fact that this cake is getting such mixed reviews tells me that it is way too sensitive to differences (even slight) in temperatures, techniques, and types of ingredients. My husband and I are both experienced cooks, but our cake was dry (cooked it 27 minutes), all of the filling ran out, and the frosting was nothing to write home about. We have cake recipes that are easier to make, are always successful, and taste much, much better. Try it if you want to, but I definitely don't recommend it!

before i launch into what went wrong, let me just say it tasted delish and i would definitely make it again - i encountered the same problems as other reviewers, center took more time to set in freezer, but not a big deal. it didn't run once it was cold enough. frosting did run, but slowly, so i put the cake in the freezer long enough for the frosting to become stiff, and then cleaned it up - was fine and held. cake did fall in the oven, which was probably attributable to 1) too small of pans, and 2) living in high altitude. still tasted fine - worth the trouble for a special occasion!

This cake was fantastic. I had no trouble with the stars but had only one size cutter so made half stars and half angels. The filling for me was firm. I used Ghiradelli.

The cake part was fabulous, very good. My filling was also very thick, so much that I had to let it stand at room temp for a couple of hours (this after it was in the freezer for a couple of hours) go figure! My frosting was fine, but did not look like the picture. I used heavy whipping cream instead of whipped cream because it was what I had available. The stars were not too tough, I didn't add shortening, and I didn't use 6 oz of chocolate, more like 3 oz.

This recipe did take a lot of work, but it was well worth it! I think the trick to making the frosting/filling thick is to use really high quality white chocolate and high quality butter (such as land o lakes which doesn't have as much water as lower quality butter or margerines) I didn't have any trouble with this getting thick. Another tip would be to only spread to about an inch from the side when putting the filling on- this way when it settles it won't run off the side of the cake. This cake got rave reviews from everyone who tried it, some saying it's the best they've EVER had. Well worth the effort!

Rating: 2
I should have known better, considering all the other reviews. The cake is really good, the stars not bad to make, but definitely more successful with the veg. oil (which another reviewer used) than the shortening. BUT, the filling and the frosting were both disastrous! Not worth the hassle. I would make the cake again, along with the stars, but use some other kind of sure-bet frosting.

I've made this cake twice now. The first time I thought I did something wrong because, like other reviews have mentioned, it was a total disaster. The white chocolate truffle was too runny so the top cake slide off the bottom. The second time I left the white truffle in the freezer over night, same results. The taste was delicious, not too sweet at all. If I make this cake again, I would cut the butter for the filling in half in an effort to make it thicker. I skipped the stars, seemed like a waste of time.

Rating: 2
This was a good cake, but my filling also ran off the cake when I put it on after freezing it for 3 hours. It was pretty, but if I make it again I will probably use the frosting as the filling, too, or put it on frozen cake layers. Putting it back in the fridge stopped the running after a few minutes. I used Bakers white chocolate - what brand did others without runing problems use? The cake traveled well to a party, but I carried the stars in a different container and put them on there.

I had no trouble with the assembly of the cake. The stars are tricky (too thick or too thin)but I just remelted the chocolate and tried again. The end result was beautiful but I thought the truffle filling was too heavy and not worth a pound of white chocolate. I would prefer using the frosting as filling.

I made this cake twice and both times it was FANTASTIC! The end result (be sure to make the stars) is incredible! I didn't have any trouble whatsoever with the truffle filling - I froze my cake layers before assembling and it set up beautifully. The chocolate stars are tricky: be sure to follow the measurements and the instructions to the letter... otherwise you'll end up with stars that are too thick or too thin. A big help: after making the impressions with your cookie cutters, run a spatula between the aluminum foil and the chocolate so the stars come up easier. I also used three different cookie cutter stars - small, medium and large - and the results were impressive! Sprinkle some silver dragees on top of the cake at the very end for a truly enchanting effect. Have fun!!!!

A big disappointment!!! The truffle filling was very runny, even though I froze it for 4 hours instead of 2. I was expecting it to have a more "fudgy" texture. However, I did enjoy making the chocolate stars, and they looked good on the cake.

So, my cake didn't look like the picture. The filling was a little oozy, and whipped cream frosting is a major pain any time of year, even when it's cool outside. If you don't have a food stylist to hover over your cake, though, I wouldn't worry about a little slipping and sliding. Whipped cream does that. It'll taste great! (We had no leftovers.)

Ditto to runny truffle filling! All the while I worked, I thought, "This is tasting wonderful. This is thickening nicely. I can't wait." The truffle filling was nice and thick when it came out of the freezer. Then... The filling ran off the completely cooled cake, so I spooned it up and piled it back on, only to have to keep spooning it up. I finally spooned it over the top layer, which I'd secured with toothpicks. The frosting was fine, and the cake tasted delicious, but next time I'll make the cake and use another filling/frosting, maybe cream cheese.

Very Yummy! A lot of work and a little expensive but worth it! The frosting was a little difficult to work with but worth the effort!

Oh, my gosh! This is the best cake ever. What a treat! The chocolate cake is rich and dense. The truffle filling was a little runny but not to worry, it worked just fine. I had to re-whip the frosting after it had chilled in order to get it thick enough. This worked out perfectly. This is an incredible cake. Definitely worth a try. I'll use it again for special occassions.

I have to disagree with the white chocolate truffle filling being too sweet or runny. Mine was neither of these! It was fudgy and yummy and not at all gooey, in fact for me it could have been a little sweeter! It came together beautifully and made the most gorgeuos and impressive presentation.

I had somewhat better luck with this recipe, but it still wasn't perfect--I'd make it again, but with modifications. I had one of my two cake layers work perfectly (baked in a nonstick Hoffritz pan) and one (from the same batter!) fall apart (baked in a standard aluminum pan). Both were in the oven for exactly the same amount of time...go figure! I had no problems with the truffle filling--be sure it freezes for a full two hours before trying to spread it. The frosting, though, was problematic--in the future, I would use something to stabilize the whipped cream in some way before folding in the truffle filling. All told, though, it still tasted good! Didn't bother with the chocolate stars--we didn't miss them.

I agree with the other reader from Washington, DC. Although I thought the cake had a nice flavor, putting it together was a total disaster. The white chocolate truffle was too runny so the top layer of the cake just slide off the bottom. I am somewhat of a novice at baking but I followed the recipe to the letter. Does anyone out there have any hints on how I can make this recipe work? Thanks!

This recipe didn't come together at all for me -- although I am a non-experienced baker. The cakes fell apart, the frosting was too loose to spread and the white chocolate filling was far too sweet. I'm curious to hear how it turned out for other people, and if experienced bakers had my problem.
