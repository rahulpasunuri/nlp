I made this with lime marmalade and it worked wonderfully. The lime gives a great zip to the relish and makes it perfect. I gave it away for Christmas and everyone has raved. This will be one of my standards.

This is very tasty, but a bit too sweet. Next time I make it, I will use half of the marmalade. If you like your cranberry sauce/relish tart, this is probably not the recipe for you.

What a wonderful surprise! This is a wonderful combination of flavors that works equally well as a relish and a jam. The second batch I made, I cooked a little longer so the cranberries were more disintegrated and used it on toast. I made more to give as Christmas gifts. This will become an annual thing, I'm sure.

Came across this recipe and since I had all the imgredients thought I'd try it. It's absolutely delicious and goes with many entrees - chicken, duck, pork. Will probably make again for the Thanksgiving turkey; something a bit different than the usual cranberry relish. It's both tart and sweet.
