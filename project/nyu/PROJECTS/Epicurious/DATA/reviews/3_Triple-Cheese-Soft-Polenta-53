This is a great weeknight side dish, and best of all, it's a flexible recipe. You don't have to use the exact cheeses called for, but can sub in whatever you have on hand. I made it with swiss, parmesan and a little cream cheese, and it came out great.

This Polenta makes an excellent side-dish while warm. Like any polenta mixture, as it cools, the firmer it gets. While warm, it is a fluffy, tasty addition to any meal. I like to serve it with chicken dishes.
