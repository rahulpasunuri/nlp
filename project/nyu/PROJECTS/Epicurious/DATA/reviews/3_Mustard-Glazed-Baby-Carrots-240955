This is good, and easy. I know I'll be making it again.

Tasty, and very easy. I'll make this often, since I have the mustard now. It should make a good side dish for almost anything.

Soooo, I don't like cooked carrots. But all I had on hand for a side dish was some baby carrots for snacking. I gave this a whirl and honestly it was tasty! Quick, easy, yummy. That was like 6 weeks ago yet I am still thinking about it... so figured that warranted a review. :)

These were pretty good and a nice change of pace. They weren't the best carrots I've ever had in my life but I'd make them again when I need something with a mustard flavor.

I used regular carrots, cut into slices, and this came out great. Nice to have a less-sweet version of carrots, altho I still do love orange juice + butter... We make this all the time.

I substituted honey for the sugar and it turmed out well. A very easy but delicious side dish.

I don't usually care for cooked carrots, but these were quite tasty. Quick and easy, too.

Not as interesting as I had hoped. I'd rather just put herbs and butter with carrots.
