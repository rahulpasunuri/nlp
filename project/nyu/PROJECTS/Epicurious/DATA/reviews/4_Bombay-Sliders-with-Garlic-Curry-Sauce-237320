easy to prepare. Fun to eat. Something different from same old cookout fare. I use a curry, mayo, lemon sauce instead of the one listed here. Either works well.

Not great, but okay. Followed the recipe except to change the ratio of mayo & yougurt. I thought the flavor of the sliders were good, but did not like the texture -- too wet & mushy. The garlic curry sauce is very good - I plan to use the left over sauce with Salmon Curry Cakes (Sunset Magazine recipe).

This is one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made. The fresh ginger is totally the highlight (although I was skeptical when I saw that in the recipe). This is super delicious served on toasted sesame bread. You will not be sorry you made it. Your mouth will rejoice in delight.

I was looking for a great slider recipe that didn't include beef and this one was a hit. I had some left over slider buns from a party the previous weekend and this recipe we perfect. SO much flavor in a little slider.

Rating: 4
Incredible flavors and something that even my 3 & 5 year old will eat. We make these all the time. I made one change, which was to omit the mayo completely from the sauce and meat, and instead use greek yogurt. The yogurt tastes better than mayo and omits all that unneccessary fat. I would also suggest spraying the grill if you grill the sliders, as mine tend to stick, especially when I changed over to yogurt.

This is by far one of the best recipes I've sampled on Epicurious. My kids, friends can't get enough of these sliders, however I did make several changes and additions that adds to the experience. I would not use cilantro and substitute minced shallots for the green onions. I also added a teaspoon of curry to the meat mix and used chili flakes instead of the chili powder. The key here is to add mozzarella cheese inserted into the inside of the rolled up slider (preferably buffalo mozzarella from Italy). Do not broil them unless you are serving them as meatball appetizers (this works too). Under medium heat in a skillet add the olive oil and heat for 3-4 minutes as a ball - then gently flip them over using a flat thin metal spatula and press down just enough so that the cheese doesn't spill out. Lastly for the sauce mixture I would also add a 1/2 teaspoon of the cu

This recipe and all these reviews make this look so amazing and a must try. This is quite possibly the worst thing i have ever eaten in my life and i tried it twice just to make sure i didn't do something wrong the first time i made them. Incredibly messy to make and the flavor is just blah. Cut way way back on the curry and it might have a fighting chance.

I made these tonight for dinner, and they were wonderful. I didn't have fresh ginger or curry powder, and couldn't stand schlepping to the store again, but they were still great. The garlic curry sauce without the curry is still very good. Three minutes per side is perfect if you take them out and let them sit on the broiling pan for a couple of minutes. They're moist and delicious, and I'm happy.

I don't cook with curry to often at home, but I loved the end result of these sliders. My only suggestion is to ease up on the amount of mayo that goes into the ground turkey. Our burgers ended up a little wet and thus hard to shape and flip. But a little extra oil in our cast iron skillet helped brown each side and the burgers were delicious!

This recipe is quite good. I made the sauce and meat with Miracle-Whip Lite & Lite Sour Cream in place of the yogurt. The Miracle Whip certainly provided its "tangy" zip -- which is counterintuitive to the sauce (I'm on a diet, so I can't drop 1200 calories of mayo into a meal...); however, with real mayo I think this recipe is likely very good. The seasoning of the meat is a little light for 2lbs of ground turkey. I used the recipes seasoning with 1-1/4lbs of ground turkey and thought the meat was flavorful. One of my burgers fell apart in a George Foreman grill, and I pan friend the remaining 3 full size burgers.

These were amazing--in taste and in ease of preparation. I made open-faced burgers because they did stack a little high on the sourdough rolls I used. Also used 1/2 non-fat greek yogurt for the sauce. Served roasted sweet potatoes alongside for a gourmet burger & fries dinner!

I made a triple batch for a work potluck lunch and it was well received by the curry lovers in the group. The turkey turned out very moist, but the overall sandwich stacked so high that they were tough to eat. Next time I will have to make thinner patties. The King Hawaiian Dinner rolls were great, but added to the height of the slider, so I will try different rolls next time or just do full size burgers. Like others, I used about half mayo and half yogurt for the sauce base.

I made these as regular sized burgers for two people, about 1/3# ground turkey per person and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. They were really good, a nice twist on the usual. I'd definitely make them again and also do them as sliders for a party.

Made these as an appetizer for an Opening Night theatre party, but crumble/fried the chicken first then added the other ingredients. Piled the lot into halved mini pitas and they went in a snap with raves! Had leftover mixture (I had doubled the recipe), so the next night I added some left over Mango Chutney and plum sauce to the meat mixture and the folks were more than happy to heap it onto sliced baguettes!! Ah, the wonders of adapting!! A definate keeper!!

Never tried a turkey burger before and this was delicious. Used all yogurt because I just dont like mayonaisse and loved the moist burger, the spicy curry sauce, and the crunch of the toppings. Yum.

I made some adjustments to the recipe and was super-pleased with the result. I used 2/3 turkey and 1/3 pork; in the sauce I had to use sour cream as I'd run out of yogurt.

I've made this twice now and it's really good! First time, I made it on a regular hamburger bun with the garlic curry sauce and the fixings. My husband and I loved it! A tasty and healthy alternative to a beef hamburger. I liked it so much that I made these as meatballs for a party! Cook them 2 nights before and heated them up in the microwave. Served it in a huge platter with the garlic curry sauce in the middle. A huge hit! Went really fast!! Only thing is I had tons of garlic sauce left both times... so unless you slather your patties/meatballs with sauce, don't make the full sauce recipe.

What a fun, excellent recipe. Like the cheesehead cook below, I made the sauce with 1/2 lowfat mayo and 1/2 lowfat plain yogurt, kept all the other ingredients as in the recipe. Delicious. Instead of rolls or buns, I toasted those mini cocktail rye breads. It was a good and interesting combination with the patties, but a regular bun or roll would probably let the sliders' taste come through more. Note that the sliders dry out quickly in the refrigerator, so either use a lot of sauce when you reheat, or don't keep them very long. But that won't be difficult!

This was excellent! My husband and I felt that there was the right amount of curry. We took the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and served these along with Mango Salsa (Bon Appetit, 1998) and felt the sharp, sweet, freshness of the salsa offset the creaminess of the garlic curry sauce very nicely. We served it on toasted Hawaiian sweet bread and used sliced sweet onions with the tomato and cucumber. We'll definitely make this again.
