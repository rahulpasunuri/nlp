I thought having macaroni and potatoe in the same casserole would be odd, but was wonderful. I added some sauteed mushrooms to the onions and threw in some frozen peas for color and topped with paprika. Awesome

Slippek from New York is a genius! I let the onions get really dark, and used the funkiest swiss-esque cheese at my local store (a cave aged gruyere), and the gratin came out comfortingly delicious. The simple apple sauce (s)he recommends is PERFECT for a snowy evening meal. Both are even tastier the next day!

This is a version of a Swiss dish properly called Aeplermagaronen, or alpine macaroni. The key is the cheese---use something flavorful and complex, like an Irish Coolea, for a portion of the cheese. If you carmelize the onions and use good cheese, this dish doesn't need any more "umph." Also, the Swiss way is to serve it with a homemade tart applesauce as an accompaniment. Slice granny smith (or other tart, firm apples) into thickish slices, put them in a pot, and fill pot with water to 1" below the apple line. Add lemon juice, honey, and cinammon (or nutmeg or allspice or chinese 5-spice powder) to taste. Bring to a boil and simmer till apples are soft and slightly transparent.

I added chicken to the mix to make it a little more of a balanced of a meal. I also topped it with shredded mozarella and corn flake crumbs, which was a nice touch. We liked the dish a lot, however it lacked any 'umpf', and therefore would add some seasoning (garlic, chili flakes, etc.) to it next time.

This was a hit! I followed some people's suggestions and mashed the potatos with a little of the cream before mixing them with the macaroni. I also only used 2 onions, and carmelized them. It also goes good with some hot sauce.

This was a definite hit and versatile. You can add ham/chicken/peas, whatever. I added more cheese as suggested and I had a little extra potato so included that as well. Added garlic, then carmelized the onions, I found two to be plenty.

I am a gourmet cook but when it comes to Mac & Cheese it's always Kraft Mac & Cheese. I didn't think I could get away with the "blue box" for Easter dinner so I was on the hunt for something different and this is it folks! Take the time and care to really carmelize the onions (cut into quarters then slice)and mash the potato well with a little of the cream & milk before mixing in the macaroni. Use Barilla elbow mac as it has little ridges that hold sauce well. I cleaned out my fridge and used a little cheddar, mozerella and, mont jack...use your favorites and you'll like it.

Tried this for a crowd - everyone loved it. Used a mix of cheeses in lieu of the specified Swiss. Other than that follwed recipe exactly. This is a great party dish - easy and can be prepared in advance.

I used half and half instead of cream and milk. Really great!!! If you mash the potato slightly and MIX WELL with the rest, it comes out beautifully. I used 2 cups cheddar. I browned the top under the broiler for a nice golden brown top.

Absolutely wonderful - you must use gruyere (or raclette) to get the best flavor - it reminds me of my Swiss grandmother's Alpler Macaron (we called it swiss macaroni and cheese when we were young) and it tastes pretty much like the real thing! Try it with chunky applesauce, like the Swiss do. Pure heaven!

Really interesting dish, but I had to make some modifications. Perhaps I was mislead by the "gratin" in the title because I was expecting a much cheesier dish. As per the directions I added salt and pepper to taste but I still found it really bland so I doubled the grated cheese (I went with old cheddar instead of swiss) and added 1/4 cup of grated romano cheese and cayenne pepper for "kick" and colour. Turned out great!

We loved it! I used a combination of colby, white cheddar and swiss. It was great! I went with less oinion to avoid overpowering the pasta and potato - definitely would make it again.

I took the advice of the Mozorella cheese and the garlic, and this dish was a major success. My husband and I just LOVE it. I will definitely make it again. and again. and again!

I cook this recipe last night which was a hit with my family. The only difference is that instead of using Swiss Cheese, I used Mozzarella, and my family are cheese lovers, so I used 2 cups of grated cheese. As well, I added one clove of garlic with the sauteed onions. It makes it a different flavor to it. Thumbs Up!

My mother would make this and add diced ham, add a soup or salad and you have a very simple but tasty filling meal.

This is very tasty comfort food. It went well with a roast beef. The next time, I'll make it with a simple meat loaf.
