This is the 4th year I will be making this for Thanksgiving and it is simply great. I had a hard time finding wild rice not mixed, so I used a white/wild mix and it is fabulous. No one could tell that it wasn't supposed to be that way.

Excellent! I used a mixed meat light kielbasa and it was fabulous. Very easy to make and reheats very well. Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving this year.

I made this on Thanksgiving (with only one cup of leeks) and it was terrific; everyone loved it. The only thing I didn't care for was the Kielbasa. I've made this several times since without the meat and haven't missed it, although I might try it with my favorite chorizo. It works just as well with shallots.

We loved this. It's great hot or cold and it freezes fine. I used olive oil in place of some of the butter and some turkey sausage to make it lighter.

I thought this was really delicious! Had my family over for dinner and my father had 3 servings. Next time I'm going to try substituting other kinds of sausage. First time had trouble with the wild rice but then I bought pre-cooked and that worked perfectly.

This was really bland. It sounded so wonderful, and just wasn't very flavorful. Out of 10 people at Thanksgiving, only 1 liked it.
