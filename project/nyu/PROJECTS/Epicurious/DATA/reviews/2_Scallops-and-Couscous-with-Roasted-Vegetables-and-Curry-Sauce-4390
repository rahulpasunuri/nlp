This recipe contained too many flavors that didn't blend well. I would not waste my scallops on this recipe again.

As usual, I made some changes: first of all, I left out the scallops to make a vegetarian meal. I also more than doubled the curry powder and yoghurt in the sauce -- next time I'll just double it. I threw in some other vegetables I had: squash, fennel and turnips. I'll make this several times this winter with whatever root vegetables I have on hand. It's very good and very easy.

Definitely for the 'mild' at heart. The couscous is a nice touch. Try a touch of non-fat sour cream, or better yet some non-fat plain yogurt, and a touch of lime juice to the sauce mixture for a bit of extra umph.
