Great hearty pasta and so colorful. Added some nutmeg, and used broccolini instead of radicchio. My guest had seconds.

I used chevre instead of ricotta cause that's what i had and fettuccini in place of the pappardelle. It was very good but I thought it needed some carmelized onions or shallots to give it a kick. Also, some reviewers said they added fresh sage and I think that would have jazzed it up some more. Overall, it was colorful with vibrant fall colors and tasty. Also, I was glad to use up some veggies I still had from last Friday's CSA share.

The butternut squash takes much longer than that too cook. he radicchio was too bitter for my taste and the rest of the flavours were almost too mellow. With some tweaking this could be very good though.

Very easy and wonderful flavors. The butternut squash does take longer to soften than 6 minutes. I used a 5 oz container of arugula instead of the radicchio, it adds the slightly bitter taste that compliments the buttery pine nuts and the sweet squash. I also addded sliced red onion and a dash of red pepper flakes. The colors make a beautiful presentation and the taste is delicious. This dish is a keeper!

Quick and easy and really tasty. The butternut squash took much longer than the recipe said. Used a creamy fresh goats cheese (couldn't find the ricotta) which helped cut the bitterness of the radicchio. The pine nuts are essential!!

Very different and interesting pasta dish. Based on recommendations earlier, I made it with endive, since I am not that big of a fan of radicchio. I bought fresh pasta at whole foods, which I think added a lot to the taste. It was very very good!

I loved this. I substituted pecans for the pine nuts and it was delicious. I wish I'd put more in. Quality cheese is key, IMO.

Not bad, not great. Perhaps I just don't like the intense bitterness of radicchio. I thought it ruined the rest of the ingredients that went so well together.

I also added the red onion while cooking the squash. I would use only half the butter up front and add the olive oil later when adding the pasta to the squash and radicchio so it doesn't get too dry. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts since I had them on hand, and I sprinkled them with cayenne pepper after frying them--great subtle kick to the dish.

I halved the the butter as well, added fresh sage leaves, and then used regular ricotta (since I had it on hand) at the end. I also used regular egg noodles. My kids who swore they were not going to eat it ended up loving it. Next time I am going to add the suggested red onion when I am cooking the squash.

This is a recipe that I make regularly. This last time, I used leeks instead of red onion (see other reviews) and walnuts instead of pine nuts. I also used the fresh sage. It was excellent. I recommend the ricotta salata, as the saltiness/creaminess adds something extra. You could probably try feta for the same reasons.

This recipe quickly became a favorite, and I make it frequently. The radicchio was a little too bitter for my taste, so I generally substitute escarole. The ricoto salata really makes this dish.

We really liked this recipe, it was a little bitter at first but with additional salt and more cheese it turned out great. I did not have pine nuts so used chopped walnuts and that worked great. I also used a lot less butter. Probably only about 1-2 tablespoons in order to cut the fat, I don't think it sacraficed the taste. I did not use olive oil. Also, I only had whole wheat egg noodles so I used those and it worked great. I would definitely make it again. it was quick and easy.

I made this for my husband and we both loved it. We ended up making it again later in the week because we were craving it and it is such an easy recipe. Both times we added half a thinly sliced red onion, and the second time we halved the butter and it was just as good. We didn't add water or chicken broth at the end, didn't feel like it needed it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and thought this was really bland and greasy. We added some blue cheese, which helped - but just barely. I would cut the butter in half (at least) and roast the squash instead of sauteeing it - you could also use a different type of greens and/or nuts (arugula, walnuts and bleu cheese would be good.) I'd also suggest adding some shallots or onions to the sauteed greens - something to punch up the flavor a bit.

I made this again with the radicchio, following the recipe exactly (except that I used romano cheese), and it was fantastic! What a great combination of flavors. The browned butter really brings out the rich sweetness of the squash, the bitterness of the radicchio is a perfect contrast, the pine nuts add a nice crunch and flavor, and the cheese adds piquancy. This time of year I especially crave bitter greens. I made it last night and just had leftovers for lunch. Yummy!

taking some queues from other reviewers, I added red onion and used chicken broth (instead of reserve water). I kept the pine nuts, and doused a little extra pepper on the finished dish. This is a great, easy, FLAVORFUL meal! A keeper, for sure. We served with a strawberry balsamic salad and a nice full bodied chardonnay!

My boyfriend and I substituted sauteed red onions (cipolline preferable) for the pine nuts. A wonderfully sweet complement to the radicchio. Used acorn squash instead of the butternut, as well. Result was a quick and delicious meal, although would use less butter next time. Also served with salad of micro-greens, apples and balsamic vinaigrette.

One thing I forgot to mention in my earlier rave review of this dish ... the creamy richness of the egg noodles is a classic foil for the crunchy pinenuts. To some others who have commented who didn't like this dish, it's true that if you don't enjoy a bitter note in a dish, even when offset by the sweetness of the squash, you probably won't like this. But if you like point-counterpoint flavors in every mouthful, this dish is splendid.

I know the year is early so far, but this is my favorite dish of 2009. The sweetness of the butternut and the brown butter, the bitterness of the radicchio, the crunch of the pinenuts, the saltiness of the cheese ... this hits all the flavor notes. Yummy.

I really enjoyed this recipe! My husband doesn't love the bitterness of radicchio so stirred in some mascarpone and thought it was a terrific addition. I couldn't find pappardelle so substituted fresh egg fettucine.

This recipe is a great fast meal. I didn't have papardelle but instead used Israeli couscous which worked very well. I added 1/2 cup of carmelized onions to compliment the squash. I also followed some other reviewers and added some chopped sage. delicious!

for some reason, neither whole foods nor harris teeter had butternut, so I did garnet yams, roasted with some sliced shallots, and was inspired for some reason to add sauteed chicken livers. Nice. Pine nuts got lost in the richness.

This dish was amazing - had to cook the squash about twice as long as indicated but the final result rocked. I had to use egg noodles, unfortunately Tampa is a little provincial when it comes to pasta...

Awesome quick meal! The brown butter, squash, and wilted radicchio is an amazing combination.

Good, easy, very quick (20 minutes); the toasted pine nuts make this dish. I didn't have radicchio, so I used kale (chopped in fine strips); used egg noodles and parmesan; added Tabasco

Radicchio was really bitter and the dish lacked pizzaz. If I try it again, I'd add broccoli and certainly some crushed red pepper.

I thought this was quite delicious. I would certainly make it again.

Thought I would try it as it sounded good and had good reviews but i found the radicchio to be overly bitter. Maybe it was just the radicchio I used. I added red onion and sage. I just found the bitterness overwhelming and the dish kind of bland.

This was surprisingly good, considering I was missing one of the main ingredients, the radicchio. I was in the mood for something different for dinner, so decided to try it anyway. I added some steamed broccoli, cut into small pieces, after the squash was soft, for a little color. I also added some chopped fresh sage leaves, as one other reviewer mentioned. Not bad at all! I will definitely try this again when I have radicchio on hand.

Such a simple, fast yet delicious recipe. It is perfect for a weekday when you are tired and hungry, and want to make a one-dish meal. I added some herbs- sage, and thyme, and a little bit of onion like other reviewers suggested. I believe the leftovers will be good as well! I will definitely make it again!

blech. I don't know what happened here - I've never been able to go wrong with butternut squash... but this fell short.

At the recommendation of "A Cook" (12/30/08) I also added red onion and fresh sage  OVER COOKED EVERYTHING, and it still turned out absolutely delicious! This recipe is going into regular rotation...

This was very good--I admit that I thought it would be a little bland on first reading, so I added a half a red onion, chopped, and 1 TB minced fresh sage leaves. I changed the order of the cooking slightly to accommodate the additions--kept the pine nuts out at first, cooking only the squash, then after removing the tender squash, I sauteed the onion and pine nuts until slightly caramelized. I added the squash back in, along with the radicchio, as described in the recipe. The ricotta salata was a good change from the parmesan I would normally use, by the way. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I thought it needed more veg so doubled the squash and will add even more next time. Used pecan pieces instead of pine nuts.
