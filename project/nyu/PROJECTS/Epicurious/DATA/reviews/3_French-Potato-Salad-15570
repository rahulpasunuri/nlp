Enjoyed this recipe. Made wedges of potatoes and they needed a little more time. Not an amazing recipe but something I would make again.

I rated and commented on this recipe by mistake. It was the French Potato Salad from Bon Appetit, August 1999 that I loved. Sorry.

Lost track and over cooked the potatoes which was probably a good thing. All of the great sauce was soaked up by the slightly mushy potatoes to give it a delightfully sour taste. My wife thought it reminded her of German potato salad. I'm looking forward to making it again.

This is a perfect summer dish for picnics without the worry spoiled mayo poisoning all your guests. ( I hate that when it happens) We entertain on our boat often and there's nothing better than a recipe that needs to be room temp!! I serve it with cold slices of grilled steaks and a slightly chilled 98 Chiant Classico 98!!

I'm not much of a cook, so it's nice to find recipes that are this easy and this good.

A friend made this recipe for me 2 years ago and lost track of her copy of the recipe. She finally tracked it down recently and I'm definitely adding it to my keeper file. I followed the recipe faithfully and it was great. Toward perfection, I think there was a little too much liquid, so I will reduce the chicken broth and wine slightly next time. Perhaps a little less mustard. Finally, since you add the dressing to the warm potatoes, the parsley is slightly cooked - I recommend adding the parsley after the salad has cooled.

Had to make a lot of substitutions -- found the recipe at the last minute. Used cilantro instead of parsley, tiny new white onions instead of shallots, and added marinated sun dried tomatoes I had in the refrigerator. The basic dressing was delicious. We marinated the potatoes in the dressing - adding them while they were still very hot -- and we were very pleased with the result.

Not worth the time envolved.
