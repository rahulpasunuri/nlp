I searched for recipes during an overabundance of Leeks and Dill from my home garden and found this recipe...I used store-bought frozen phyllo pastry insteading of making the pie crust. Excellent! My husband does not usually like feta cheese but he liked this a lot. I have also tried the filling with a mashed potato Shepherd's Pie-type crust instead of the pie crust - also really good. Kind of British/Greek fusion :-)

I thought these were only OK. My brother-in-law said they were wonderful. But, maybe he was just being polite...

This was great. A little time consuming, but great for a company dinner or Sunday lunch. I made a few changes and it was superb. In the filling, I left out the dill (i hate it), cut down on the mint a bit, and added enough basil and chevril to bring the herb amount up to the same volume as in the recipe. Also, I used more Parmesan than the recipe called for. The pie crust was surprising easy to make and handle -- well worth the effort. I also brushed the top with a mixture of melted butter and milk about 15 minutes before it was due to come out to help it brown.
