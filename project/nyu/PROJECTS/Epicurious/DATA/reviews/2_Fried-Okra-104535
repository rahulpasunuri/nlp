This recipe is just plain stupid. In general I never boil any vegetable but I absolutely wouldn't boil okra. The previous reviewer has a much better recipe.

I too have not made this but boy do I ever agree with a former reviewer of this recipe who said that boiling the okra first is plain stupid. I grew up eating fried okra and make it myself and have never heard of this "technique" - - seems sort of odd to me. I slice the okra into 1/2 inch pieces, salt and pepper them, dip them in egg, roll them in flour and corn meal and fry in a medium-hot skillet until golden brown and then drain it on paper towels... It comes out crisp and tasty and everyone who tries it for the first time seems to love it... Hmm, go figure???

Hmmm... I would never presume to rate a recipe I haven't actually tried. Since there is nothing on earth that could entice me to try this one, I shall merely offer my opinion. Boiling okra before you fry it is about like boiling beef tenderloin before you grill it. One shudders at the thought....... I'm all about experimenting and stuff, but there *are* limits. This suggestion is just plain dumb!

I've grown up on fried okra and never heard of boiling it first! If you get young, tender pods, there is no need to cook them first. We cut up our okra, dumped it into buttermilk for a while, then into a mixture of corn meal and flour seasoned with salt and pepper. The coating stays on and the okra fries up beautifully. Just make sure your oil is not too hot!

i am new to fried okra and had not perfected it yet. i tried the boiled with cornmeal. found to too be too tough. i tried a number of versions and came up with what i consider the perfect fried okra. cut okra, soak in milk, mix hushpuppy mix with a little cornmeal, salt and pepper, dredge and fry. i received rave reviews. i dont think you need to boil it. i think the difference is in the coating and cornmeal is too coarse. you can use hushpuppy mix or seafood breader. also, i dont even measure, i just add what i need to coat the okra.

This is a pretty typical method of frying okra in the South. To make the coating adhere to the okra, create a thin, soupy "paste" of flour & water. Put the okra in this prior to rolling in the coating.

This is the way my mother made this dish when I was growing up. It's great with southern dishes, serve with Tabasco for an added kick!

okra is one of those vegetables that is a little strange .. but I grew up on fried okra. I boil the okra 8-10 minutes (after the water begins to boil w/ okra in it) and then take out and drain. Shake the okra w/ corn meal and pan fry in butter untill the crusty corn meal coating stays in tact. A bit a black peppr or cayanne could spice it up a bit. Don't worry about the okra splitting because it will. The corn meal and okra fried in butter is the only way I'll eat it.

I have never heard of boiling the okra before frying - at least I have never known anyone in Louisiana/Texas/Oklahoma who does it that way. Try this instead. Cut off ends and then slice into about 1/3 inch pieces. Toss the okra with beaten egg whiteto coat then toss with the seasoned cornmeal. Fry. You will have nicely coated okra without losing all the cornmeal to the oil. This will work with frozen okra (let it thaw) as well as fresh. You can also take the okra through the cornmeal step and then freeze (spread it out on a pan until frozen.) I like fried okra with pico de gallo for some reason or other - not salsa though.

This recipe doesn't explain how to coat the okra with the cornmeal. I had a dismal experience because most of the coating came off in the hot oil, creating a nice brown mess that slowed down the frying process and resulted in soggy, oily okra. This recipe needs to be re-written in more detail, explaining the fine points of pan frying or deep fat frying when using cornmeal.

After boiling, the okra becomes very tender and is too easy to break while trying to saute.

I buy okra fresh from produce markets during season and freeze them whole. Then, in the middle of Winter I take them out, slice them, still frozen and put them into a mixture of 1 egg and 1/3 C. milk. Dredge in mixture of 1/2 C. of Crushed Crackers (Ritz or Saltine)and 1/2 C. flour Fry in hot oil (I prefer Crisco) Drain fried okra on brown paper bags or newspapers (I always have those and don't always have paper towels) Sprinkle with a mixture of Cajun Spices, salt and Lemon Pepper. (Gently, I tend to over-spice) Enjoy!
