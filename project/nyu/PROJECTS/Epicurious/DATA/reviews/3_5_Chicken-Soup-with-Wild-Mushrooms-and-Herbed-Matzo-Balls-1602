This soup base was delicious. We made the mushroom flavored water with dried porchini, but discarded the mushrooms because we hate the texture of dried/reconstituted mushrooms. We used cheap chicken backs and wings to make the stock and it was so delicious. Added coarsely chopped carrots to the final soup - a must. The matzo balls were small and tasty; not great, but good. They were medium weight. Better than plain matzo balls, but not as good as I had hoped.

My thanks to the cook from New Jersey who recommended removing the chicken early and shredding it. I now don't feel wasteful and have tried new dishes with the shredded chicken that I hadn't thought of making before! Now on to the recipe: I didn't make the matza balls, but the chicken soup was wonderful. I had never thought to brown it before boiling, but it's the perfect addition--it imparts a rich colour and deep flavour to the soup that can't be beat!. I really love this soup; it is officially replacing my old recipe!

To the cook from Loren. If you have objections to wasting a chicken to make the stock you can remove the chicken after one hour. Let cool, then shred the meat off the bone and return the bones to the pot for the rest of the cooking time. Then you can use the chicken for salad or pot pies. The soup will come out just as rich. Also you can just use a family size pack of chicken thighs. They cost next to nothing on sale. You can make the stock whenever you have the time and keep it in the freezer for up to 6 months. Then you always have fresh homemade stock for any recipe.

I guess I'm a traditionalist where matzo balls are concerned. I found the addition of tarragon to a matzo ball to be a little bit strange. However, the addition of the mushrooms and tarragon to the broth was superb, and gave a nice complex character to what would otherwise be a very bland soup. I think next time I'll add chicken and rice to the mushrooms and broth, for a great hearty winter meal. For matzo balls though I'll stick with carrots and dill instead.

Good recipe. This is the first matzah ball recipe I've attempted; if you're looking for others on epicurious, be sure to try variations of the spelling (Matzah, Matzoh, Matzo). This is an awful lot of work to make chicken stock. If you're lazy, have objections to wasting a chicken just to make stock, or want a cheaper alternative, you can easily just buy standard chicken stock, add some good white wine and spices, and be done with that part. The recipe is rather fast and effortless except for the stock making. If you need the 1/3 cup chicken fat, just get 2.5 lbs of thighs, separate the skin and as much fat as you can get, and fry just the skin+fat under high heat until all the fet is rendered (about 10min). Then brown the meat and add it to your soup later on or save it for another dish. I didn't like the shitake mushroom flavoring in combination with the stock (although I do like shitakes and cook with them frequently), so add the liquid slowly so you have a chance to back out in case you end up feeling similarly. There's a variety of secrets for how to make fluffy matzah balls; my recommendtaion is to make sure they are rather wet and sticky, add more water if need be. I'd cook just one to make sure it expands appropriately (it should at least triple in size); if it's too dense, then add more water and re-refrigerate. I couldn't find Matzah Meal at my local store, so I just used a matzah ball mix, which usually consists of maztah meal plus some spices and carbonates and salt, so just omit adding more salt and you should be fine.

After years of chicken broth, finally one I would make again

Some of my 12 Passover guests had never tasted matzo ball soup, let alone a home made stock. This was a big hit among all. Definately worth the work.

this recipe took a long time but the soup was delicious. the matzo balls were a little salty for my taste. will try with a little less salt next time.

Rating: 3
This is the most delicicous soup. But do not make it for anyone who does not like anything salty. To me, it is perfection.

I've made this four times in the last two months - all to rave reviews. Fresh herbs really add to the flavor. Sometimes, I pull the chicken off the bones part way through and add it at the end.

This is a fabulous recipe. The soup itself was wonderfully fragrant, and the matzo balls were tasty. The tarragon adds a nice note. I'll probably add more black pepper next time when I'm making the stock. Yum!

I have made this version of matzo ball soup every Passover since the recipe was first published in 1991. My family loves it and will not eat anything else. I would highly recommend it, it is not like my grandmother's but it is even better.

This took some time but was worth it. I had never made matzo balls before but didn't have a problem with this recipe. Next time I will double the recipe and then freeze some.

This was so good! The shitake mushrooms gave the broth an incredible taste. And they are not kidding when they say make the balls 1 inch-the first time I made them, I made them about 3 inches and they expanded to the size of a softball! The recipe is relatively healthy, it is filling but plan on spending some time putting it together.

I make this instead of the traditional matzah ball soup. The flavors are a lot more sophisticated and intriguing. Try it! It's great!

This soup even the youngest(6yrs)even ate it! I accidently put the herb tarragon into the soup and made it even tastier!I couldn't believe the fussier 6 year loved it! the guests wanted more. The next time I will cook more of the soup to hopefully have leftovers. The children wanted more but there was none!!!!

this was my first attempt at matzo ball soup and it was a great success. It was easy to make and very tasty. I added two cut up carrots to the soup; and the wine I used was a little on the sweet side, but it was a big hit and I hope to do it again--even if it isn't Passover

I have made this my standard recipe for matzo ball soup. Everyone who has tried it has enjoyed it immensely.
