This was really good! I made it for New Years Eve dinner last night and it was super yummy just as written and the best part was I had all of sauce ingredients on hand. When the sauce was done reducing I decided to finish it with some cream and it was rich but delicious! Highly recommend if you're making this for a special dinner. For the person who had trouble with sticking in the pan - my best guess would be you either didn't have enough fat in pan or your temp was too low. Hope that helps :)

We are veal lovers and really enjoyed this. It is simila to veal marsala, but a little stronger flavors.

I made this dish for company and served it with a side dish of pasta with a red sauce. I received rave reviews. I have also made the dish with chicken which works out just as well. It is a nice, simple recipe that does not keep you in the kitchen when you have guests. I have made the meat earlier in the day and refrigerated it then put the platter in the oven on a low setting while we had cocktails and the salad course, it kept very well.

Actually if my husband liked veal better, I might make this again. I did find it a bit heavy tasting - perhaps an even balance of beef and chicken broth. Also, reduced sauce still lacked thickness so I added a bit of cornstarch.

This is my kind of food! Delicious, easy and relatively low in calories. (Works out to 1 tablespoon oil/butter per serving)I used all chicken broth as beef is too strong a flavor for the veal. You can cut down on the amount of broth so you don't have to reduce it for so long. Goes well with rice or noodles.

WOW! This was the best. I made fresh chicken stock and used leftover onion soup. Too much flour stuck to the pan. I barely had flour on the veal. Any tips about this out there?

This recipe was ok, but nothing real special. The sauce needed more spices,and possibly some mushrooms. I used cooking sherry - probably better to use the real sherry wine. Simple dish, simple taste.

Once again, this veal dish is a snap to make.
