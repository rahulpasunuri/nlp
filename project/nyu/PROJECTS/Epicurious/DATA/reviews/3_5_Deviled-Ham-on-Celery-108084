Agree with A Cook from Manahawkin, these are a great addition to a hors d"oeuvres party menu. We served them at our 2012 Derby Party-great look & flavor and you can't beat the ease of prep!

I'm not sure why only 67% would make again, every time I make it people love it. I serve it with celery as the recipe suggest, but is also delicious with rye Triscuits. Part of my Kentucky Derby menu, especially because I can make ahead and it keeps well.

This is a great recipe! By far the best ham salad I've ever made.

I was skeptical about this recipe since it had mixed reviews but I needed something quick, simple, and make ahead for my party. It turned out great! I used the "already cubed" ham from the store but I chopped it a little finer. Other than that, I stuck with the recipe. This was all gone by the end of the night.

The final flavor was very uninspired. I used smoked chicken and was surprised at how little real flavor came through this salad, despite the ingredients.

This is my favorite recipe for a "ham salad" Not only is it great as an appetizer but it also makes delicious sandwiches to take to work. I make it every year with my left over Easter Ham. This year I added a little smoked Spanish Paprika and it knocked my socks off.

I thought this was good, but served it with several other nibbles at a cocktail party and almost all were left. Won't make it for a party again.

I followed the recipe only using left over ham from easter. It was great. I loved it on celery.
