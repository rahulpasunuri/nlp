Much too sweet! I made this with precious fresh tomatoes from my Seattle garden; relatively sweet varieties, they combined with the sugar into a "salad" that tasted more like a weird dessert...so disappointing. And that, even with the suggested savories of dijon and garlic. I don't think I'll make this again, but if I do, I most certainly will omit the sugar.

Loved this salad! Easy and delicious! Cooked rice according to package directions. Will make again!

Delicious! Sorry for the substitutions, but this was an emergency Sunday night side dish. I used leftover Jasimine rice (made too much for an earlier meal), and based on the previous reviews I added garlic and Dijon mustard to the dressing and used apple cider vinegar (ran out of white wine vinegar). Also, I threw in cucumbers and red onion that needed to be used. Served it grilled Salmon burgers--yum--nice and refreshing on a hot July night.

Really good but make the rice according to the package rather than the recipe. Then add the dressing, tomatoes and basil.

You can make this so easy by using Trader Joe's frozen brown rice that you cook for 3 minutes in the bag, let it cool and then go for it. I also add little mozzarella balls and plenty of the dressing (make extra) to make sure it has enough flavor. I'll have to try the dijon suggestion. But everyone always likes this dish.

This salad is delicious! The only problem is that you have to add a lot of basil and dressing so the rice gets tasty.

Always a hit in my house! Everyone loves this dish. I made a few changes, which I really love. I omit the sugar and actually use apple cider vinegar. I also add garlic which gives it a major kick!

I've cooked brown rice before and no- one in my family (husband and two kids) would eat it. For health reasons I wanted to try it again. This recipe was a huge hit; nothing left at the end of the meal. The only thing I did differently was add two cloves of chopped garlic to the dressing. I let the rice cool for a few hours before adding the dressing too and then refrigerated the whole salad for a few hours prior to eating. I served it with potato and chive crusted cod (which I baked in the oven) and corn. I will defintely be making this recipe again.

This is an excellent summer dish. I used a rice steamer and omitted the salt, adding a sprinkle at the end and it was delicious served with bbq'd salmon fillets. Fresh, wholesome and delicious!

This is a wonderful light side salad. I added a small amount of minced garlic and cucumbers and garnished it with crumbled feta. Fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden this summer will put it over the top!

I cooked recipe as suggested with the exception of cooking the rice. I soaked rice for two hours and cooked in covered pan with four cups of water by bringing to a boil and turning down to a simmer for 20 minutes, removed from heat and let set for 5 to 10 minutes. I did use the salt as suggested, but will use no salt in the future. Way too salty and not needed with basil and tomato flavors.

This was a very tasty salad. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added Dijon to the dressing along with fresh garlic. The brown rice turned out a little too soft, will use jasmine rice in the future.

This is a Great summer side dish. It's best made with fresh summer tomatoes. The vinegar gives it a nice flavor. I've made it several times, and I'm going to make it again today. For a twist with more protein, I've also made it with Quinoa. That also turned out great.

I made this with leftover brown jasmine rice, which was something less than tender and succulent. Next time I will cook fresh rice for this dish.The tinkering suggested by the other reviewers is inspiring, but it was very nice as written.

This worked well for a big picnic, complementing, rather than steeling the show from, the big hits(sliced grilled lamb & beet salad with plums and goat cheese). Nonetheless, it wasn't really a "home run." As other reviewers seemed to have concluded from their own additions, it definitely needed "something." If I bothered to make it again I might coook the rice with chicken broth and add dijon mustard or crumbled feta.

I had some leftover brown rice from last night's dinner, and this was a perfect way to use it up. I added some black beans to make it a vegetarian main dish, and I used Dijon mustard in the dressing, as another reviewer suggested. It was very simple and very tasty lunch. I won't be throwing out leftover rice again.

Very easy, very tasty! I made 1 1/2-times the dressing (adding a touch of Dijon to bind/flavor it + fresh ground black pepper), & added half of a diced English cucumber, about 1/4 cup slivered Kalamata olives, and some crumbled feta. While cooking the rice, prepped/mixed all the other ingreds, then added the rice straight from the pot and served immediately (sort of room temp). Grilled some Italian turkey sausages & colored bell peppers to accompany ~ delish! One note: I had to add more water (maybe 1/2 cup) and cook the rice longer (maybe 15 minutes) and it was still quite chewy. Using 2 t. kosher salt the rice is VERY salty, but by the time you add it to the other ingredients (don't be tempted to salt them at all, especially if you use the olives/feta) the seasonings are fine.

I call this the 'Summer Salad of 2004', I made it so many times. I generally add a touch more garlic and ground pepper to just about everything, but other than that, I made it as is. Fresh, great mix of textures.

This side dish was very good, though I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, reduced the oil, and didn't add the sugar. It was really nice with the Yogurt Spiced Chicken Breast from the August 2004 Gourmet.

I LOVED this recipe! Soooo easy to make and THE perfect dish for summer picnics! You can have it as a side dish or add chicken pieces like I did to make it into the main dish. Another thing is that it keeps really well so if you have leftovers, you can even wrap it up into a tortilla and have a wrap for lunch the next day or even stuff it into a pita. Yum! :)

Only average, at best. Disappointed, because I love Ina Garten's other recipes.

GREAT light, refreshing, summer recipe. I doubled the recipe for a crew of 6. I think that it would have been way to much tomatoes if I had doubled that portion (luckily I didn't buy to many.) Everyone ate it up.

This was a terrific recipe - so quick and easy to make - a big hit with the guests I served it to - expecially in the summer when the tomatoes and basil were so fresh!

This is a very easy dish to make that tastes great. Has a nice flavor, especially if you love the taste of tomato and basil. You can experiment with different vinegars to get different tastes for the salad, also with adding other ingredients such as broccoli. I like to eat it slightly warmed. Have already made it twice.

An ok salad (lacking variety of flavour)and it's not enough for a "meal". I would add shrimp and/or more vegetables (cucumber like one person suggested). Extremely quick and easy to prepare.

I love this recipe. I have a rice cooker which makes this a quick and easy meal. It is both healthy and delicious - a combination which isn't always easy to find!

Used red grape tomatoes, quartered, and texmati rice. Easy and makes for a nice light lunch.

I am always looking for good nutritious make-ahead food and this is one of my favorites. It meets all of my needs for a dish that I can prepare for guests or for potlucks that suits my needs as an athlete and health conscience person who loves to eat.

This is the kind of recipe that you can whip up with whatever you've got in the kitchen. I substituted brown rice vinegar for the white wine vinegar, and used organic cherry tomatos. It was delicious, easy to make, and healthy (I think the sugar adds a nice light sweetness).

Personally I don't like brown rice that's why I thought it was so, so. My husband thought it was lacking flavour so he added some soy sauce.

This is a great salad for a luncheon. It has great flavor and is very light. I peeled and seeded the tomatos and added cucumber w/out the seeds. It was delicious and those who ate it asked for the recipe
