Based on the reviews comments that this could be bland, I added finely chopped anchovies, probably 6 or 7 and several cloves of garlic with lots of Mediterranean herbs, rosemary, oregano, lots of basil, thyme, etc along with a few dashes of hot sauce in the eggs. I also used just a small amount of basil tomato sausage to make sure there was plenty of flavor. I used tomatoes that I had oven dried and roast baby red and yellow peppers tossed with balsamic vinegar. I substituted chopped kale for the spinach to have less liquid. My guests and I loved it. Easy to tweak with what you like and have (or don't have) on hand.

I added sauteed mushrooms, garlic, & more tomato topping,& more more cheese toppimg Also.I used Thai basil (because that is what was fresh in the garden) & more than doubled the amount called for in the recipe. Gsrlic added into the spinach saute. Near the end of the spinach, add a dash of white wine. I did not even need to drain excess fluid from the mix as I cooked it down, but not overcooked I also used a 10" pie pan since the 9" was too shallow for the amount of egg mixture. And I had crank up the heat on the convection oven to get a more evenbake & a much better browning,especially at the end. Be sure to let this rest! Serve with crusty bread How about adding some fennel -- sliced & sauteed, or just sliced & placed on top of the spinach mix in the pan More sliced tomatoes. In this case, dab a paper towel over the top before adding the cheesy topping More fresh herbs

The consistency on this dish was not pleasant, way too runny. I thought with the eggs that it would set more solidly. I'm going to make it again using less ricotta and hope that makes it a firmer, and closer to a pie, consistency.

Excellent recipe but definitely needs additional seasoning (even just S&P will suffice). I have made it twice now and believe that using more egg whites = longer bake time. I am able to stretch 1 red potato for the entire crust, using my mandoline on the thinnest setting. I recommend s&p on the potatoes and a little extra baking time (20 min). After wilting the spinach, I chop it to make it a little more kid-friendly - no leafy bites. My kids are not spinach-lovers and the older one LIKED this, and the younger one managed to get a few bites down without much complaint (but she doesn't even like eggs so this dish is a double-whammy). This is very versatile - you could change up the cheese and veggies or add meat and get a different "pie" every time. Perfect brunch food!! Also good served cold.

Very good and very easy! I added a tiny bit of chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and used only basil. This would be great for a brunch. And you know what goes great on top? Sriracha!!! (Hot chili sauce)

Used all egg whites, garlic, extra olives, some goat cheese, thyme, dill...good, but needed a little something extra. Maybe some cayenne or red pepper, and next time will broil before sprinkling the cheese to caramelize the tomatoes a bit.

I will definitely be making this dish again. It was delicious and hearty, without being heavy. I would recommend adding some spice to the egg mixture (some hot sauce, pepper, dijon mustard, and garlic perhaps?). Very tasty.

Even though I used all of the tips recommended by other cooks (grate the potatoes, add much more seasoning, add garlic) it was still bland and mushy. Took a long time to make and even longer to bake. My husband and I each had half a slice and pitched the rest.

Everyone is right, you have to at least double the baking time listed -- for me, it needed 50 mins. I didn't have any regular potatoes so for the crust I used one medium sweet potato and sliced it thin, in a single, slightly overlapping layer of discs. I didn't have any feta so I used shredded parmesan instead. I didn't have any spinach so I used kale instead. Came out great! My husband loved it -- ate half the pie. Very rich tasting, yet very healthy. Will definitely add this to my repertoire!

Not bad; I'm keeping the recipe to play around with. I didn't particularly like it, but my family did. I used more olives, sauteed the onion with olive oil, 4 whole eggs instead of separating them, and made half the cottage cheese feta. I also used Parmesan instead of mozzarella. It was a bit bland, but not bad. I'm definitely going to try putting garlic in with the spinach next time.

I also used 4 whole eggs and it came out beautifully!! So light and delicious... can't wait to make it again!

This is a really easy and healthy dinner. Like other reviewers, I added a lot of spice - salt, pepper, oregano and thyme - to most of the layers. Also, I used kale and sauteed the onion and kale with a bit of anchovy paste and white white - yum! I would add garlic next time, too. I must have sliced the potato layer too thick because it was not soft enough at the end. But a great way to use up leftovers or have a nice veggie meal.

My husband and I loved this, also. I seasoned the potatoes and eggs with salt and pepper and used 4 whole eggs instead of the eggs/whites.

My husband and I loved this. It's great for weekday dinner. I did season the potatoes and the egg mixture with salt and pepper, but not a lot. That was the only substitution I made.

This is a delicious, healthy meal. I used low-fat cottage cheese and omitted the olives as I don't care for them. I added salt and pepper to the egg mixture for seasoning. It took 10-15 mins longer to cook than stated in the recipe, but the result was delicious.

Very nice dish that also looks very pretty to serve. We made this for a brunch and guests were very complimentary of the light, fresh flavors. Followed the recipe as written and enjoyed it!

Simply lovely and very quick to make. While it can indeed be tweaked it's also great on it's own. It feels light which is a wonder for a cheese pie.

Delicious! Very easy to make. Added a layer of rotisserie chicken on top of the spinach/onion layer. Yum! Will definitely make this again.

This turned out really well. Hubby made it and boiled the potatoes first. I would add a little more seasoning, even just salt and pepper, to the potato base next time.

Quick, easy, healthy and light. Be sure to use plenty of seasing on the potatoes. I might try pan frying them to add some crisp. It is a delicious meal for anytime of the day.

I love that this recipe is so low on fat. I took other reviews' advice and grated the potatos, and once they were in the pie plate, I patted them with paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. The crust came out okay, but I would make another suggestion - I would use a mandolin to thinly slice and layer the potatoes. I wasn't too pleased with the shredded potatoes because the burned a little and were almost unnoticable in the dish. I used lots and lots of oregano, thyme, salt and pepper throughout. I also used a whole onion (which I sauteed with anchovies) and the entire container of feta. I substituted capers for the olives. It was easy, satisfying, and really delicious!!

Quick and easy with nice flavor. Very pretty dish.

In fear of this being too bland, I dumped (not sprinkled) both basil AND dill throughout (and strangely enough, it worked). I shredded the potatoes as advised for the crust and added salt and dried dill to the potatoes before cooking. For the egg filling, I beat the eggs until quite foamy and added salt, pepper, fresh dill and dried basil. I couldn't tell you how much I used--I poured a lot in. I also used more feta than called for, and the feta itself was already "flavored" with basil and tomatoes. I used arugula--only about 5 oz--and omitted the olives. I baked for an hour (including 5 min for melting the shredded cheese). It turned out wonderfully.

A dish so lovely should taste a whole lot better. I agree with the cook from Tacoma that the cooking time needs to be longer. The dish definitely needs more salt. The reviewer who suggested grating the potatoes first may have been on to something, so I may try that in the future. Truth be told, tasting this disk made me long for Spanikopita, which this tried to imitate. If the large quantity of leftovers are incredible for breakfast, I'll report back.

Like others, I love this recipe. Certainly plenty of opportunity to finesse to your personal taste. Two suggestions: 1. season the potatoe "crust" well before baking; 2. plan on taking at least twice as long to bake the entire pie. I was suspicious when I read the recipe and felt sure that the quoted 20 mins would be woefully inadequate, and I was right. Mine took about 50 mins. Also, the olives add nothing (unless you treble the amount and make the entire pie Greek), and next time I'll try oregano instead of basil.

I have made this recipe several times since first trying it a few months ago, and it is a fabulous and easy one dish meal that is low carb, relatively low fat and a great way to eat a ton of veggies. Best of all, the recipe is versatile enough to attempt with a myriad of ingredients, as long as you stick to the potato base, sauteed green mixture, egg/ricotta toping and tomatoes on top. For example, tonight I did sauteed organic kale with itallian sausage, put goat cheese in the egg mixture instead of feta, topped with cheddar over the tomato, and used a variety of fresh herbs. Delicious!

Absolutely! This is a scrumptious terrific, meatless dish for guests if they are lacto-ovo vegetarians, but I would serve it to anyone. However, this great one-dish meal is absolutely incredible with more herbs, great olive oil and terrific cheeses. So, I read the reviews -- which were all very helpful in different ways but consistent in suggesting more herbs. My modifications don't include a calorie count: Change in ingredients: Virgin Olive Oil instead of spray Idaho potatoes Swiss Chard Regular Ricotta (small container) Goat Feta (chunk about 2" x 2") Definitely Asiago (small container) Buffalo mozzarella One stalk oregano (the kind that comes in the grocery store in a small plastic container) Add quality virgin olive oil sprinkle over potatoes and then add a little to your taste to the middle layer. I tripled and quadrupled the amts for potatoes, basil and added oregona - so 4 large potatoes, one cup basil, one stalk of oregano, large handful of Kalamata olives. The Chard does not add moisture the way spinach does and it has a very pleasant flavor, but also is a much better texture. Followed the recipie but forgot the eggs! While it would hold together better for sure, I really liked it without the eggs. Salt and pepper. Wow!

A good idea for a dish that could use some improvement. The pie came out looking beautiful, but tasting very bland. I will make it again, but will add garlic to the spinach mixture and will double the spinach. I also would highly recommend adding some salt and pepper before cooking. Also, the potato crust would hold together better if the potatoes were grated instead of sliced.

For a low fat recipe, this dish turned out amazingly well. Aesthetically, it looks really good when served and taste wise, the basil and tomatoes really add a nice touch. The only criticism with the recipe would be that it lists baking time at 20 to 25 minutes but it took me at least twice as long for the egg to set.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. I used egg substitute and 1% cottage cheese. I also omitted the feta, swiss and parma cheese to make it less "cheesey." I used fresh swiss chard. In the future I would add twice as much dill and some other spice to make it more flavorful.

This turned out surprisingly good. Skipped the feta b/c I don't like it. Had to bake about 8 minutes longer, could be the oven or the altitude. The basil really makes it.
