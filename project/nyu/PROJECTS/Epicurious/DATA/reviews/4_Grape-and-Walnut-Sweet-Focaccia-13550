Usually when I try a new recipe I follow it exactly as written, but I had a bag full of sweet plums from a friend's tree and was looking for a way to use them. The focaccia turned out just right, crusty and brown on top and soft in th center. Baking time was closer to 25 minutes than 35. We ate it right out of the oven but froze some for breakfast or brunch. I'd try it again with grapes, figs, maybe even the last peaches of the season.
