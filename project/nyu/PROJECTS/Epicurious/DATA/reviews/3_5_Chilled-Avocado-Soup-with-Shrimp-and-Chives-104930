I substituted lime for lemon and cilantro for chives but otherwise kept the dish exactly as written. Incredible! Have made it twice now to rave reviews! Definitely a keeper!

I took the advice of other posters and increased the jalapenos to three, used vegetable stock and not water as well as substituted cilantro for chives. This soup turned out fantastic and not overly spicy. Was very refreshing and a definite hit with people who are not big fans of chilled soup.

Great summer soup. I pumped up the flavor a bit by adding two roasted and peeled poblanos to the puree. Then I simmered the broth with a bulb of garlic, cloves separted, for about 30 minutes, cooled and then added to blender. Cilantro is a great addition to the shrimp garnish.

Even after I doctored this beyond recognition, (more garlic, more chives, the addition of lime juice, cilantro, a small serrano chile...) I still did not like it. Maybe a more avid avocado fan might like it better.

Took the advice of other cooks and upped the jalepenos (I used three). Also used four cups of vegetable stock in lieu of the chicken stock and water, which made this soup incredibly flavorful and vegan friendly. For the cucumber mixture, I used cilantro & lime. This is the perfect recipe for a hot day or warm evening.

This was a great starter - I heeded other reviewers' comments and used 3 c. broth and 1 c. water for richer flavor. I doubled the chile and substituted serrano chile for the jalapeno, since serranos tend to be more consistent in heat and flavor. Due to a food allergy I eliminated the shrimp mixture - when serving I garnished with freshly grated lemon zest. Colorful and delicious.

A slightly more complex (in taste, not in prep) take on traditional avo soup. I agree with other reviewers who found it slightly bland as written though - a higher stock to water ratio is needed, and either more chili or a few dashes of tabasco help. I also added just a few cumin seeds to the onions and chilis. I suggest sieving it for improved texture.

i agree it is easy, but prep took longer than i thought it would. i also increased pepper & onion, added cilantro with chives, and i used medium shrimp coarsely chopped. i topped each serving with one whole shrimp w/ tail and squiggled w/ sour cream. pretty, summery, and super fresh-tasting. my guests really liked it. (keeps longer than recipe says--drop avocado pits into soup to retain color--and store shrimp mix separately.)

Not only is this a truly delicious summer dish, it is an absolute sinch to make!

deliciously unusual soup that got rave reviews; I used one less avocado than called for, and it was still full of flavor.

The group I made this for could not stop talking about the soup. I used mostly chicken broth for the liquid, double the jalapeno, and used cilantro in the soup and as the garnish instead of chives.

It is a wonderful hot summer evening supper. My friends just thought it was the end.... We loved it... Would not change a thing.

I like the idea of this soup but found it to be a little on the bland side. I gave it a 3 because it really does have potential as a summer time first course when entertaining. Next time I would double or triple the jalapeno and use a medium or larger white onion. I used 3 cups of broth and only 1 cup of water, I didn't want to dilute flavor with water. I used more lemon zest than called for. I think extra chive would also add to the flavor. The lefotvers are in the refrigerator and have not sidcolored. The secret it to lay plastic wrap on top of the soup surface.

This is a delicious chilled soup for avocado lovers- the jalapeno taste is very subtle. Does not keep past 4 hours! (Changes color and taste).

This is a nice-looking dish with the pale pink shrimp on the green avacado soup. I marinated the shrimp in lime juice, 1 tblsp. peanut oil, a good dose of ground black pepper and the zest from a lemon. Next time, I'll put another jalepeno in with the soup. If your guests love avocado, they will love this soup.

The picture in the mag makes this soup look unappetizing - its actually very good. I used cilantro instead of chives. Its very elegant and refreshing, not nearly as goopy as it looks in the picture. I recommend it highly. Its also easy.
