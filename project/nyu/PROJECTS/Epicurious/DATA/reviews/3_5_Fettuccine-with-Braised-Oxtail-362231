This was good, and I made it to the letter. But the braising liquid reduced down to maybe a cup or a bit more by the end of about 2 hours. I had to add water and some more red wine, and I still don't think it was enough to really bring out the richness we were looking for. I think I'll try other recipes for oxtail before circling back to this one.

Very nice and very rich. Perfect for a cold February night. Didn't have parsnips so I substituted carrots which worked well. The sauce was exceptional. Would definitely make again.

This was my first time eating oxtail and wow what a way to try it! The sauce is to die for! About the 'amt' of oxtail. I made this recipe b/c I was at a farmer's market where they had oxtail. When she pulled it out of the freezer chest, it was an entire tail! I had to "butcher" it myself. Fun? Um, I just had to not think about it. Anyways, I think it means 4 slices of oxtail like you would buy in the grocery store. Also, I ate this over polenta, which in my opinion is better than pasta.

The '4 oxtails' is confusing. Did you mean 4 whole oxtails or 4 pieces of oxtail? A whole oxtail seem excessive. But 4 pieces (1 piece per person) may be too little and will depend on which section of the tail the piece is cut from. Where I shop, oxtails are cut to pieces. I don't think I've ever seen a whole oxtail. I don't think I want to see one.
