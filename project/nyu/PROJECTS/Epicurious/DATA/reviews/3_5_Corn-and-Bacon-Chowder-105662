Disappointing. Very bland. I have made better.

This was so-so. Not horrible but, well, just so-so. I doubled the potatoes and think it was the right quantity. I also waited to add the milk until the potatoes were cooked. I only added 1 1/4 cups milk and it still seemed watery and bland, so I added 2 Tbsp. cream. This is a very easy recipe and, with some doctoring to make it a little more rich and flavorful, could be good.

Haven't made it yet. If you add chicken - do you still use the bacon also? Could you add shrimp with bacon or do you need to use ONLY shrimp? Thanks for any input.

Very good corn chowder, simple to prepare. I added extra potatoes and some salt.

Well, I must admit that this recipe was my very first experiment with Epicurious. I am super excited about this site, but not so excited about this chowder. My man loves spicey and that is exactly what he got...I made it just a tad too HOT. I did add smoked gouda like others had mentioned...I liked the addition. All in all I would say that the best part of this recipe is the smell of bacon left in mi casa after the dinner was cleaned up. Happy Tuesday to all, and wish me better luck on my second experiment!

Followed the recipe, but used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Plenty of flavor. A big hit at the end of a cold rainy day.

I was definitely concerned about the flavor factor after reading the reviews, but addition of cayenne did the job. I also added almost double the bacon and potatoes + 1 red bell pepper for a really hearty soup. The consistency was a bit thin for what I consider chowder, but still really tastey.

Yum Yum. This was a hit at my house. Because corn is ready right now, I cooked fresh corn cobbs instead of frozen packaged. (I used 5 ears of white corn) I think the fresh corn made it even better. Good comfort food. I will definately make it again.

This recipe was delicious. Next time, I think I'll only add half the bacon.

Loved this recipe. I'm not a big fan of bacon except for breakfast so I added sweet italian sausage instead. Also, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable. It turned out delicious and would make it again!

I have made this several times and its great. To change it up, use hot italian sausage that you brown and chop. Add the browned sausage after the chowder has simmered for a while and about 10 mins. before you serve. Also I use fresh corn that I boil and cut off the cob - you get a more more fresh flavor. Serve it with french bread and smoked gouda cheese!

My family loves this one. It's a weeknight staple that I know everyone will enjoy. I can be made in 30 minutes and the kids love to help.

To add more flavor,I used a leftover ham bone instead of the bacon and it work out great!

Oh, and to add to my review below, I also used hickory smoked organic bacon. If I were to change anything I would probably double the bacon and the potatos (you can bairly find them among the corn)

I'm not quite sure why everyone is having so many problems with not having enough flavor - this is one of the more flaverful corn chowders I've had (and I've had a lot of corn chowders). As far as things that I substituted: I used one cup of soy milk and one cup of regular milk because we didn't have enough regular milk; insted of the creamed corn I used organic "creamy corn soup" (I'm not about to touch unorganic creamed corn and whole foods didn't have any - no suprise) and added more frozen corn (I'd say i had around 24oz. total); I omitted the celery leaves because I didn't want to find them and they were cut off the stocks, and lastly i added a roux created out of 2tbs of butter and 2 tbs of flour because I could tell it wasn't thick enough for my tast.

Excellent and so easy to prepare. A comforting, rich chowder with a great combination of contrasting textures and tastes. Highly recommend! So does my hubby.

good chower,used fresh corn,who knows what goes in frozen.also when the cobs are scraped lots of milk is extracted which enriches the soup used chicken broth and fresh sage[no bay on hand]a diced parsnip and heavy cream and as in all chowders finished with a dab of butter.pretty decent corn chowder.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I added a chopped red pepper to the veggies. We used Organic Vegetable Broth was well.

Bland and dull. Even my kids, who are notorious for loving boring food, shunned this and opted for Cheerios for dinner. I pureed it, thinking that would help, added a bucket of salt, nothing could really cure it. A much better recipe is the Corn and Cheddar Chowder (Gourmet, Jan. 2000), it is really an outstanding soup. Pass on this one. It's as boring as wallpaper paste.

This was quite good. I added extra potatoes, used chicken broth instead of veggie broth, and added some marjoram and thyme in addition to the Tabasco sauce. I happened to have some pepper bacon in the freezer, and that worked very well in this recipe.

This was excellent! I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, but otherwise didn't change anything. Added tabasco for spice. Recommended!

Not enough flavor. Let it sit in the fridge over night and tasted the same the next day.

This is the easiest, tastiest chowder I've ever made. I used the recipe 4 times this winter. My other half loves it.

I love this easy recipe. I use Danish Bacon which has a lot less fat (about 1 tbs. in 1 lb.). For added heartiness, I add more potato and veggies.

My husband and I loved this! Served with crusty bread smeared with baked garlic, this quick meal was perfect on a cold night. I added extra hot sauce and simmered it down an extra 20 minutes for more flavor. Yum!

Easy to prepare, will surely make again. Would be good with lobster meat, crawfish or shrimp.

This chowder is convenient in that it uses ingredients most folks always have in the fridge/panntry. However, the results are mediocre--edible, but boring.

I wasn't thrilled. I thought this soup was too bland. There are so many better recipes than this, that I would not make this again.

I have made this for my husband and I and then to take to a gathering. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used turkey bacon to cut down on the sat.fat and chicken broth. Very yummy.

Easy and delicious. I omitted the celery and celery leaves, and added a diced bell pepper and two chopped chipotles for smokiness and added spice. Also, I swirled in a lump of butter just before serving.

My husband loves this soup so much I have to cook it by the gallon and keep it in the freezer! I love that it's so easy and quick to prepare.

This is a great cream soup starter recipe for anyone looking for something flavorfull, quick, and easy. A couple of things that i would suggest is adding some ceyene while it is cooking as well as about 4oz. of shredded smoked ghouda cheese. the smokiness of the cheese goes great with the bacon.

I wasn't wild about this soup and neither was my husband. I wasn't bad but there really wasn't anything great about it. I don't think that I would go out of my way to make this one. Happy cooking.

My husband LOVED this recipe. I am a little ho-hum. I was very pleased until I added the Campbell's vegetable broth. It turned the color from a nice white to a carmely color and it altered the flavor of the chowder dramatically, giving almost a burnt taste. When I make it again, I would use chicken broth instead. A good hearty recipe.

great fast and easy soup with great flavor

Using the chicken idea and adding one green chili roasted, use one cup white wine with broth to braise chicken, add one glove garlic to the mixture and if you fancy use an herb mix as well in broth, use a little S&P, when chicken is done strain mixture and add to soup, dice chicken and render in bacon fat until browned, add to soup, also add diced green chili, serve with oyster crackers, great for the cold weather and a hearty soup by the fire...peace

Made it for Thanksgiving dinner as is. Everyone LOVED it and had second helpings. We are having guests over for dinner tomorrow and I'm back to make it again!

I agree with other reviews that essentially say that this soup's flavor really comes together on the 2nd day. I substituted turkey bacon and it worked fine (just added some oil to the pan when frying up the bacon). It's a good hearty fall/winter soup.

Absolutely fantastic. A regular at my house now. At the request of my husband, I have altered the recipe: double the bacon, double the potato. I like one other review's idea of adding chicken. Think I will try that next time as well...

My boyfriend and I made this chowder on the first cold day we had, what a great soup!! Next time I would definatley add sweet sauage or chicken.

Made this recipie as directed and thought it was very good. Next time I will add a bit of sugar but otherwise thought this was a satisfying and easy chowder.

I forgot to add the bay leaves, and could only find medium red taco sauce to add. It was just okay. The sweet corn mixed with bacon just made an odd combination of salty, sweet, and oily. I'll eat it, but I wouldn't make it again.

My husband and I absolutely love this soup. It's great comfort food and very satisfying. I did add a bit more hot sauce. I didn't worry about the amount of bacon as it's cooked till crispy and the fat cooks off. I've made this several times as my husband keeps requesting it. The flavor is even better the next day. A real keeper!

This was a great recipe. I think next time I might use skim milk and less bacon to cut down on fat and calories.
