I've never had sfina/zeppole before so I can't rate this recipe on its authenticity, but these were pretty good fritters. I found that I enjoyed them more sans cinnamon-sugar and dipped into cherry jam instead.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU! Many years ago, I lost my family's sfingi recipe and have been searching high and low for a recipe even close to it. You have it. They are(almost) as good as my grandmother's. They melt in your mouth! My family traditionaly serves sfingi with warm honey, but the cinnamon/sugar mix was good as well. I have also stuffed them with a sweetened riccotta cheese mixture.

Easy to make. And a good snack. I found the 1/2 teaspoon too small. I used a heaping teaspoon. The only thing that i didnt like was how mushy the inside was.
