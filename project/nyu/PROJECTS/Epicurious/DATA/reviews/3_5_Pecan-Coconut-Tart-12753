This was pretty good. I think I might've baked it too long, though, as the edges were a little hard. Great texture, though. The honey and pecans really stood out compared to the coconut. Got good reviews from my dinner guests.

Such high hopes. Followed directions exactly. It came out moist but salty. It wasn't the nuts, they weren't salted.

This was a hit with everyone young and old!

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and will most likely make it again for other occasions. This amazing combination of ingredients will remind you of a fancy candy bar. The addition of sunflower seeds and chocolate drizzle are nice touches that shouldn't be skipped. Plus, the presentation is great. Watch closely as it bakes, as my tart was good to go after about 19 minutes, and I probably could have taken it out sooner.

Love it! One of my new favorite desserts. This tart is rich and flavorful without being overly sweet.

This was amazing! S Next time I may drizzle each individual piece. A show stopper and a keeper!

Unbelieveably delicious! I made this for a Mexican themed appetizer party, cut it into very thin slices and not a single one was left! (That means that everyone went back for seconds!) The texture is great and the sun flower seeds are a good twist. I am waiting for the opportunity to make this again. You won't be dissapointed with this!

I made this for a party and everyone adored it; took seconds; and wanted the recipe. It was even better the next day. Do be careful on the cooking time: I cooked till the entire tart seemed almost set, and thought it was a little overdone. Terrific, though; and very easy to make.

the most sickeningly decadent and sinful dessert... we all savored every crispy, buttery, chewy bite... absolutely wonderful.

This is to die for. Made it for a party and it was a huge hit. Don't skip the chocolate drizzle, it makes it look like it came from a bakery. The fact that it was so simple to make was an added bonus!

I made this for my cooking club last winter, and as an act of faith, a second one for my boyfriend's family at the same time. Both were amazing... And both got rave reviews! I melted some extra chocolate in the microwave and used a fork to "scatter" chocolate over the top- I will definitely make this again!

None of my guests wanted to eat this because it made a gorgeous dish - but when they relinquished to the knife, this tart got "ooos" and "aahs."

Obviously rich and dense, this tart is superb. Don't skip drizzling the chocolate sauce and do serve a dollop of fresh whipped cream next to each slice. I baked the bottom crust for 25 minutes to perfection. The only problem I had was that I could not get the tart (too heavy) off of the spring form bottom so I had to cut on there...no big deal.

Made this for a Mexican Fiesta party. I thought the crust was a bit dry. I might cook slightly less next time. I would prefer the filling to be a bit more moist. The flavor was good. I don't think I overcooked it and caused it to be dry - but I would try slightly undercooking it next time.

Very easy recipe to prepare, other than the sunflower seeds, I had all the ingredients in my pantry. My dinner group loved it. Their comment was that it tasted similar to the Greek dessert Baklava.
