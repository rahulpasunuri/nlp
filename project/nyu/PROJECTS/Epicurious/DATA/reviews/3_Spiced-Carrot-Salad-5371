I, too, grated the carrots. I also steamed them for about 2 minutes to soften them up a bit and bring out their flavor. I julienned sweet red pepper and added that.

This is a good recipe. I used the dressing for a "spicy carrot slaw" that I made with store-bought (raw) shredded carrots -- definitely not your standard picnic fare. I gave it 8 hours to chill & mellow. Spices really fell off a day later. Very nice presentation with carrots and cilantro.

I have not made this recipe as directed, but prepared a modified version of it several times, and was asked for the recipe. Instead of cooking the carrots, grate them, and simply toss them with the other ingredients. I did not use garlic; rather than chopping it, you could infuse the olive oil with crushed garlic cloves while preparing the other ingredients. I used parsley instead of cilantro, and added golden raisins and toasted slivered almonds. This raw preparation benefits from sitting in the fridge overnight, but it is quite flavorful freshly prepared. Vibrant and refreshing!
