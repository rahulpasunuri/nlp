After changing the recipe by not adding the chili oil or crab, it was incredibly delicious. I tried adding what the recipe recommended and it was foul. Here is what it needed for garnish instead: 1 cubed avocado, 1 tsp. toasted, ground cumin, 2 tsp finely diced onion, 1 tsp per serving of olive oil, 2 tsp per serving of diced and steamed broccoli stems.

Great idea, we loved this soup. The most significant change I made was preparing a shrimp stock, reducing it and cooking the cut and scraped corn kernels and milk together with it. I also added crab when I pureed the soup and reserved some to serve on top.

This took rather a lot of effort and dishes but came out great. It's sophisticated, but simple. Good, fresh corn is crucial, though. I did without the chile oil.

This is really a great soup. Refreshing, but not heavy (despite being creamy). I thought it might be fun to have a chunkier, more rustic soup, so I saved a bit of the whole corn kernels & stirred them back into the pureed soup. I also didn't throw away the pureed corn solids. I used fresh Dungeness crab, since that's what we get in OR. The chile oil is brilliant - really adds a nice hit; not too much, though - crab is so delicate! This is definitely worthy for a summer dinner party.

An easy and excellent summer treat. The chile oil gives it a gourmet touch and the colors make a beautiful presentation. I would consider making it with a bit of lobster in place of the crabmeat.

mmmmmmm. it's the essence of corn, in a soup. so simple, so pure, so good!!! i left out the crab and the chives. i think the chives would be nice if i had them. and i left out the chile oil with the second bowl i ate -- it was so good just by itself.

I liked this soup. I used corn on the cob from the supermarket (not picked-that-day fresh, but fine for this recipe), a combination of skim milk & Fat free half & half --yes, I'm on a diet ; )--some Frank's hot sauce (actually, lots of it), salt and pepper. Oh, and I warmed it up, too. Nice combo of flavours and a fine light lunch.

I refuse to boil my corn myself as I can't tolerate the screaming as I plunge them into the water. Have your local cornmonger do this step for you. Sorry, but I could'nt resist.....

Bravo twotaconancy!!! Just read your lobster review prior to this review and burst out laughing. Too true that someone does the dirty work, even if it ain't me!!!

Why in the world would anyone cook fresh local corn! We wait all year for this delight, too soon gone. Just BOIL it, butter it, and enjoy! :-)

Very disappointing. I used the best of ingredients (farmer's market corn, chives from my garden, etc.) Soup tasted like liquid custard (too sweet)...had to keep adding more oil and salt to try to balance flavors (to no avail). Looks lovely, tastes very-ok.
