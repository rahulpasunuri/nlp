Made this tonight. Exceeded expectations even after I read the great reviews here. I had to alter it a tad, didn't have fresh mint so used dried, honey and a bit of cran-strawberry juice instead of the molasses and wheat flatbread instead of pita. I made the yogurt (greek yogurt) with diced cucumber, honey and a little lemon juice. Oh and no shallot. Skipped the oil since I had packaged ground lamb that had plenty of fat. I'll definitely make this one again, my husband insists on it.

This is an extraordinary recipe. I made it exactly as written w/ exception of pom molasses which was not available in three Madison WI market I scoured. So did considerable Google research on a substitute: for 1/4 C equivalent, 1T honey & 1 T balsamic (not aged for it is too sweet) or other vinegar (I used red wine). I also used tomatoes from my garden. This is a complex dish with full and rich flavors. Simple salad of radishes, cucumber and snap pea complemented well. @Mkellykennedy: the tomato sauce tastes nothing like a typical Italian sauce on meatball sandwiches. Try it again as written. I believe you will be very pleasantly surprised.

I make them with turkey ground instead of lamb and I have to say that it is very very good. Everything else is the same and I have to say that It is really good. My friend did it with chicken ground and it was very good too.

full disclosure: i'm not much of a cook, although the few things i do i tend to do well. i had some lamb to use up and found this recipe - amazing! it took me about 2 hrs (i could probably get it down to 75-90 mins) which was more than i had anticipated, but the results were delicious. the mixture really brought out the flavor of the lamb, which turned out perfectly tender, and the sauce complemented it perfectly. two things i'd change: 1) lightly sautee the onions before putting them into the lamb mixture. 2) do something with the yogurt sauce. maybe puree some mint and cilantro and stir it in there with some salt and pepper, anything to liven it up just a tad. otherwise, splendid.

I made this almost exactly as described. While I was frying the little oval lamb kababs I thought it was too much trouble, but everything else went very quickly and simultaneously and the result was just superb, so much better than the usual lamb pitas. I used ground lamb from Three Corner Farm in the NYC Greenmarket-- not fatty and terrific flavor. The tomato sauce is very unusual--chunky and tart. The spices are mellow: the cumin doesn't overwhelm, the allspice is unusual, there's a nice bit of heat following. I added lemon juice and salt to the yogurt, and we put thinly sliced cucumbers, mint, cilantro, and farmers' market microgreens into whole wheat pitas with the meat and sauces. Heaven.

I didn't have cilantro, and I served this over couscous (with raisins and pine nuts) instead of on pitas, but otherwise, followed the recipe and find it delicious! I made the sauce in a cast iron skillet which really helps the tomatoes carmelize. Yum!

DELICIOUS! This is an amazing dish with great flavors. Prep time is reasonable. A great middle of the week dish!

This is a weeknight recipe that I keep coming back to. We had it for the umpteenth time tonight and it remains one of our casual favorites. I make it with fresh tomatoes in the summer. Don't skip the mint. I ususally serve it with some variation on a greek salad. Wonderful!

To the cook in Brooklyn who thought the dish was too sweet: I do think it was probably your homemade molasses :) Pomegranate molasses is actually very sour--in many dishes, it is used in place of lemon juice! Next time, try lemon juice and see if it fares better.

This dish was awfully tasty, but a little too sweet/carmelly for my liking. This could be because I whipped up a makeshift pomegranate molasses by mixing unsweetened pomegranate juice with a bit of sugar. Still, I think the diced tomatoes overwhelmed the dish, making it too sweet and tomatoey. I'd make it again, skipping the pomegranate, and using whole peeled tomatoes instead.

Excellent! Finger-licking good! Used ground turkey instead of lamb, and reduced salt to 1 tsp.

I really liked this. I would not make the sauce again, it made it seem like a meatball sandwich. I would just make a cucumber yogurt sauce

I made this recipe randomly about a month ago and it was really sensational. I served it w/ the cucumber mint raita sauce, in pitas w/ sliced purple cabbage. It was one of the best meals I've made on a weeknight in a while, and I cook all the time. So now here I am looking up the recipe once again, this time I plan to serve it alongside some Lebanese lamb pies (Fatayeer), plus the Raita. I think what makes this sauce really work is the combo of the allspice and pomegrante molasses (found at BiRite in SF). If you don't have the pomegrante molasses, I think you could fake it by reducing (over low heat) some lemon juice with honey and a bit of red fruit juice (such as POM, cranberrry or raspberry juice), until it thickens.

Very, very nice. The first night I mixed up the lamb mixture, cooked up half of it, and served the lamb patties without any sauce. They were delicious and were also good at room temperature for lunch the next day. The next night I cooked the remaining lamb mixture. I wanted to serve it with a sauce but had no time and energy for the sauce in the recipe. In the fridge I found a shrimp cocktail sauce left over from Thanksgiving (yes, the kind with ketchup and horseradish) which I doctored with pomegranate molassses, allspice, and lemon juice. It tasted great with the lamb. Next time I will make the sauce properly and will have yogurt on hand to serve with it. I'll skip the pita, though, because I don't need or miss the carbs.

I've made this three or four times in the last two months, and it is AMAZING. Never disappoints, and the pomegranate molesses adds a key, almost smoky flavor to the sauce. So good.

Great dish!!! I didn't make it exactly to plan. I was cleaning out the fridge, looking for something with canned tomatoes, cilantro and lamb! SURPRISE! I did as others did and put each in the blender. The first I used as a crust for a lamb steak. The sauce I boiled after blending. I fried the lamb steaks in a dry pan, put over rice, and poured on the sauce. Delish! I didn't have pomegranate, but used a good tablespoon+ of honey in a half-recipe. The sauce is also good over an omlette! I was very surprised, as I wouldn't naturally think of putting these ingredients together. I'm looking forward to trying it as written.

This is an excellent recipe and much easier than I had originally thought because I just smushed everything for the patties (except the lamb) in the food processor and than hand mixed the meat in. Same for the tomato sauce. Didn't have the pomegrante molassas so tried some regular molassas with some tamarind paste. Strongly recommend using Greek yoghurt since it has more body and "bite". The presentation of the little patties together with the pita halves, yoghurt and scallions was very attractive. And, oh yes; I too am not a mint person, but I strongly recommend using it. I think that that hint of it just made the patties extra special.

To heatwolee@wlu.edu You could try using some molasses, lemon juice and a dash of honey instead of pomegranate molasses. You can order the pomegranate molasses online from Middle Eastern grocery stores.

My rating is for the sauce only which I used on Spiced Lamb in Pita, also on this site. Although I usually follow a recipe to a tee, because of a variety of problems I cheated and used dried minced onion, garlic salt and no pomegranate molasses which I did have on hand. I'm not recommending my method, just to say that done properly the sauce would possibly rate 4 forks. Next time when I'm feeling better I plan to do it the "right way" because as it was, the sauce was delicious.

Originally rated on 05/19/03: OUTSTANDING! I've never cooked with ground lamb before or eaten any, just rack of lamb, and this was delicious! I didn't add the 2 T of oil to the meat, since I just bought "ground lamb" (not lean) and I figured it didn't need that at all... and it didn't! I might opt for grilling these little patties next time too, for a healthier version. This is a definite repeater recipe and would be great for company. I am not a huge mint fan, and didn't have any on hand, so I didn't use it & I didn't have yogurt, so I subbed light sour cream, which was great. I also think that these would be good cooked crumbled and mixed with the tomato sauce and then put into the pitas? Any way, I am sure they would be excellent. I also love Greek food, and this reminded me of that. Serve with tabbouleh & hummus?! YUM!! June 16, 2003 I just made this tonight with ground turkey and grilled them and they were wonderful. My friend loved them and I highly recommend this recipe!!!

A great weeknight dinner. I'm definitely making this recipe again. I used leanest ground beef instead of lamb, canned breadcrumbs and no pomegranite--but it was still great. And you can make the patties in advance--great reheated in the tomato sauce!

this was really good. great flavor, i will definately make it again. i dont rate things often, but i was compelled to tell you how good it was. i didn't have the pomegranate molasses, and just went without, bc what do you use instead, plain molasses? pomegranate juice? honey? anyway, it was great without it.

Very savory. Substituted ground beef and boxed bread crumbs and don't think it was any the worse. The yogurt with mint was a real hit. Couldn't find pomegranate molasses so substituted honey. Served with saffron rice with toasted pine nuts. Lovely dinner.
