I made this vinaigrette to go with a cold soba noodle salad, tossed with fresh vegetables. I added a healthy tablespoon of freshly grated ginger to the recipe, which I think rounded it out nicely.

Rarely has such a simple recipe been so spectacular. I used this as a salad dressing over baby spinach and served with Fillet of Beef with Asian Spice Rub and Teriyaki Portobellos (both from this site), and even morsel was gone. The salad was the best of all!
