Really good. A non-stick skillet works best. I serve them as a starter at supper.

Changed the recipe a bit as I just couldn't put all that butter in. Used half and half instead of whole milk and butter, also cut the BP in half. I agree that 1/4 cup batter makes an easier to turn pancake. My changes reduced calories by 1/3, and brought the saturated fat from 11g to 3g. Will make again using half cornmeal and half flour for more corn flavor and texture.

I used these as wraps for an array of fresh veggies, some light cheese and salsa. The flavor of fresh corn didn't shine through the way I hoped, but these were still a good way to use a big bunch of ears I needed to get rid of. I didn't have any butter, so I'm sure that affected the flavor. I used a splash of olive oil instead. My boyfriend really liked it, so I will likely try some variation of this again.

These are also known as Cachapas, a typical Venezuelan dish.

this was a good recipe to try, I added 1/2 c of fine corn meal to the batter and some fresh corn. I fried an egg and a piece of no nitrate salami and placed it on top of the corn cake! It was really good!

First time I made this they were mini and served with lox, creme fraiche and tobiko, Wowwza. Next time I made for breakfast with double smoked bacon, Lord help me I was in heaven. What an impressive meal to make for a loved one.

Loved these! I loved the way the baking powder made them so light and fluffy. I served them as a side for dinner with fish and made a peach, tomato, jalapeno, lime, cilantro, salsa to serve with the pancakes. Had Creme Fresh too. cannot wait to make again!

really good...have made them a couple times now, both for brekkie with maple syrup. i also cut back on butter to 2T b/c it has a good amount of oil in batter as well.

This recipe is a perfect way to eat corn for breakfast. The one modification I made was in the amount of butter. 1 stick seemed a little excessive and I cut the quantity way back from 1 stick to 2 tablespoons. Although I'm sure they were much different and decidedly less rich they were perfect and I did not miss the butter- especially since it was 90 degrees outside! I will absolutely make these time and time again.

I made these for a summer dinner meeting to have as the appies. I served them with Creme Fraiche. I think the 4 teaspoons of baking powder is way too much baking powder given 1 cup of flour. The batter started to foam up and look like a sponge when I mixed it all together. The pancakes themselves were a little too delicate for me...most likely due to the baking powder. I do suggest not using 1/3 of a cup of batter as reocmmended in the recipe but using 1/4 cup or less. The 1/3 cup resulted in a too large pancake.

Made these for appie with Lox, creme fraiche and tobiko. Yum-yum-yum. Make as small as possible. 1 tsp batter. To a Cook from Boston...Fresh, uncooked corn. Hence the name...Fresh Corn Pancakes.

I really enjoyed these for a brunch with maple syrup and butter. Husband thought they were 'lacking' in flavor. I'd be curious to try them with salsa as a more savory dish (minus the sugar in the batter).

These were great, I made them last night. In order to make the prep a little easier, I just pureed all of the corn with the milk, didn't strain it, and prepped the wet ingredients separate from the dry...only mixing them together at the end. They were delicious and we both loved them.

I think the recipe calls for uncooked corn, that is what I used. My batter was very thin, had to add flour. Served with sour cream and salsa, they were delicious. Will definitely make again.

Not a review, but a question. For these pancakes to work, am I to scrape the corn from uncooked or cooked ears of corn? Thanks in advance to anyone familiar with this recipe!
