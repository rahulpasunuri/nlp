This is a hodge podge recipe. Not at all authentic. I grew up in Bombay and the Chowpati Bhel is the best. Lets not bastardize authentic Indian recipes which are unique in flavor and taste please!!

Indian ketchup is very different from American ketchup, and the two are not interchangeable. Try Maggi brand and you will see. Definitely not horrific "crap", if the ingredients are fresh it works out fine. By the way, where are we suppose to get fresh green mangoes to make mango chutney here in the States? A jar will have to do, depending on the locality.

Tomato ketchup, cornflakes, mango chutney....?! This recipe is gross....I agree with the previous reviewer. I wish there were some kind of negative rating that could be given. Its amazing the kind of crap that gets passed on as Indian food. The author needs to make a trip to Chowpatty again and pay attention when your bhel is being made....a bhel is a deceptively easy snack to make. the guy making it may mix a number of ingredients together and give it to you fresh in a matter of minutes but the chutneys that go into it take very elaborate preparation. There is typically a sweet/ tangy tamaring chutney with several spices, a hot green cilantro and mint chutney, finely chopped onions, Sev, chopped boiled potatoes, kurmura, papdi ( deep fried flat disks of dough) etc.

This recipe sucks!! Please do NOT call this Bombay bhel - Here is a basic recipe - Stir together 2 cups puffed rice (kurmura), 1/4 cup fine chopped onion; 1/4 cup chopped boiled potatoes; 1/4 cup coarse chopped roasted peanuts; 2 - 4 tsps cilantro chutney(blend 1 bunch cilantro, 2 jalapeno peppers, couple mint leaves, water); 2- 4 tsps date chutney (blend together 1 cup dates and 1/2 cup tamarind soaked in water) and salt to taste.

Nothing like the real thing...substitute a few tablespoons of tamarind juice instead of the ketchup its more authentic.

I wouldn't use the tomato ketchup though, as it alters the taste of the Bhel considerably. Otherwise it is a really good recipe.

This recipe is far from the real thing, however, as an adaptation, it's O.K. Real Bhel-Puri or Sev-Puri is out of this world. I know, I called Bombay home for 25 years

Unbelievably gross!!! I wish there was a score of minus 4 forks!!! I should have known by the ingredients but I'm willing to try anything unusual.Had to throw this away! Not even the dog or the neighbor who eats anything would eat it!!!!
