Does anyone know nutrition info for this recipe? Wondering how many calories/protein/fiber in each pattie....

Really good. Normally we buy Morningstar breakfast patties, and these are a really tasty, healthy alternative. I added a bit of garlic and fresh rosemary and ground the nuts very fine which made making them into patties really easy. Next time I may use a little liquid smoke just to see if it works with these.

I used dried marjoram instead of sage/thyme, hoping to avoid the Thanksgiving stuffing comparison alluded to in a previous review. Also added garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. They tasted pretty good. Definitely some issues with texture and falling apart. Maybe next time (and there will probably be a next time b/c I am now sitting on a 5 lb bag of spelt flour that I had to buy just for the 2T called for here) I might consider making it as a "meat"loaf instead.

Delicious! We really enjoyed these patties, they are chock-full of good ingredients and are filling without being overly heavy. Great addition to any vegetarian diet.

This is just so delicious! There is so much you can do with this. Very filling and healthy. Try this!

Delicious, I made some small tweeks, added some extra thyme used baby portabella mushrooms instead of button and blended everything in my highspeed blender for a few minutes to get a smoother "sausage like" texture. Good any time of day, I'm thinking a few drops of maple syrup may invoke more of a breakfasty feel?

These are good. Nothing incredible, but a nice savory alternative to oatmeal or granola if you want to get whole grains and nuts in the morning. The patties were very loose -- next time I'll try pulsing some of the ingredients in the food processor.

I'm always on the search for savory but non-meat breakfast solutions, and this one was fabulous! I had to tweak the recipe, but that could be because I modified it. I used bread flour instead of brown rice/spelt flour. I only had about a half-cup of nuts, and I used about 1½ c chopped mushrooms. I used wild rice. When prepared this way, it didn't form patties at all. I first pulsed about a quarter of the mixture in the food processor, but it still wasn't pattying up for me. So I kept adding breadcrumbs until it did. End result is very satisfying!

First, I didn't make these for breakfast - we're not breakfast people (except for maybe around 11 AM on Sundays!). I did make it, as written, and paired it with the spinach pie - also in the "detox" menu  for dinner last night. The patties won! I made it as written, and after doing a quick taste-test, added some fresh rosemary, and used fresh thyme instead of dried. Next time I will follow the other reviewers suggestions and add some garlic, and perhaps use a mix of nuts - we only had chopped walnuts in the house. All in all, the patties were very good. This is a nice recipe to experiment with, and my son loved them, so I'll have plenty of opportunities!

I added the following to the recipe: 3-4 cloves of garlic, double onion, fresh oregano, thyme and sage, double the nuts (sunflower, almond and peanut), soy milk, and it was DELICIOUS! I left it out for 40 minutes on the counter while I ran an errand, and it was a perfect consistency for the oven. Paired it with faux sausage and (white bean) gravy from a post-punk kitchen recipe. Genius vegan breakfast-dinner!

Very tasty, even better the next day. I replaced the rolled oats and cooked rice with 2 cups cooked quinoa. Used the mushroom liquid from soaking dried shiitake as stock (good!) and finely ground raw almonds instead of finely chopped. While the mixture was sticky, using a scoop it was easy to form into patties, and they kept their shape nicely. Next time I will add garlic to increase the flavour.

I messed with this recipe a bit, trying to imitate some vegan breakfast patties I had at the wonderful Sunrise Cafe in Yellow Springs, OH. So take my rating with a pinch of salt;-) Used rice milk, added 1/2 c finely shredded carrots, and used flax seeds for 1/2 the volume of the nuts. Still, my results were just so-so, and I have not discovered their chef's secret...

These tasted good, if you like eating something that tastes like turkey stuffing for breakfast. It almost even had the same texture as stuffing and fell apart very easily. A mess to make into patties.

I am not sure why this is labeled breakfast. Thyme is difficult for me to enjoy early in the morning. I would recommend less thyme and sage and make it for lunch or a snack.

These are even better the next day. I sprinkle each with additional soy sauce after reheating them. They do freeze well, too - just as the recipe states.

Delicious and so healthy. I feel so much better when I have high quality protein for breakfast vs. sugar processed stuff. This smells and tastes like thanksgiving stuffing, but doesn't weigh you down. Had trouble getting the patties to stick together, perhaps will make sure the soymilk is really think next time...
