Heavenly, what a lovely summer treat. The cream very nicely tames the tartness of the gooseberries. I was worried that the cream might need sugar, but it doesn't. A mint leaf is the perfect garnish.

There are only a few recipes for gooseberries but I look forward to making this every August when my gooseberries ripen. Another simplified recipe: 3 cups of gooseberries and 3/4 cup of sugar. Boil as directed and fold in 1 cup of unsweetened whipped cream when cooled. Zippy and creamy. Gooseberries rock.

I made this mostly because I was amused by the name. But perhaps gooseberries are an acquired taste. We all found the flavor of the compote odd, especially in combination with the cream.
