Made this with the Moroccan Lamb Kebabs and based on earlier reviews I added golden raisins, which were a nice touch. I used the quick cooking Couscous. Definitely going to make this again.

I love this recipe! The last time I made it, I added pine nuts and dried apricots. This goes particularly well with lamb. Here is a picture and my review: http://www.ajinthekitchen.com/imported-20110212231825/2011/4/3/quick-bite-golden-couscous.html

Greatly enjoyed this recipe - it is more mild than other couscous recipes, but when made with the lamb kebabs it is perfect compliment to the lamb. I used quick-cook couscous and prepared the couscous with only 3 cups of broth and added more right before serving because couscous had absorbed most of the liquid. Followed others suggestions and added raisins and dried apricots - love them! Definitely make this again.

I used equal parts couscous and broth; add the golden raisins as they are a wonderful touch.

Have made several times...some with great results, and some with near disaster. Apparently couscous comes in different varieties of cook time. I like the whole wheat organic, and ended up with soup. So, now I prepare couscous plain, however the box, bag etc tells me to- quick cook, slow cook, wheat, organic whatever- with broth, no butter. I reduce the broth by a bit from however the label tells me to. In a separate pan, I saute the onions and spices in this recipe and a few tablespoons of broth. I also add chopped dates and the raisins. When the couscous is done, I add the perfectly textured couscous- no soup- to the seasoned paste and toss. Perfect every time.

This is great couscous. Next time around I will try with the Golden Raisins as other reviewers suggested. I'm guessing this will give a bit more complexity to this dish. 3- days worth of leftovers after feeding 5!

Absolutely delicious! As other reviewers noted, adding golden raisins makes this dish.

Apart from halving the recipe, I followed it exactly. I wish I'd paid more attention to the broth/pasta ratio because when I lifted the pot lid at the end of the 12 minute rest period, I encountered a soupy mess. I was able to salvage it by cooking off the excess, but the end result was more reminiscent of rice-a-roni than couscous. And meanwhile my nice grilled lamb and veg, which had been timed to coincide with the couscous, were steamed in their own juices in a warm oven.

I found this a little bland. I much preferred the Couscous timbales with pistachios, scallions, and currents (Gourmet July '91) as an accompaniement.

delicious! i halved the recipe (and used less butter), and added golden raisins. the flavors go so well together - and is even better with very fresh spices. Served with Tagine Bil Kok from this site.

I cut everything in half, but otherwise made it exactly as written, with the addition of an equal amount of currents along with the almonds. It is an excellent side dish and makes a lot. My husband loved it, even going so far as saying "this recipe is a keeper". I served it with grilled lamb chops and later with chicken with lemon sauce.

Maybe i did something wrong, but i didn't much care for the flavor of this. Plus, the couscous was overcooked.

I just made this recipe with the 'African Adobo Rubbed Tuna Steaks' from this sight and it was to die for! This couscous is so easy, and the flavors are fantastic. I added some crumbled mild feta, which was added some nice flavour without overwhelming the dish. Will make again!

My new utility player of side dishes. I can't think of anything you couldn't serve it with. Maybe 3-4 mintutes of extra work than a box but tons better. Tuscany Hills, I can't think of what may have happened. I also used organic from a local natural foods store, not quick cook. Followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect. Maybe altitude is the only thing I can think of? We're about 6,800 feet so I'm used to adjusting for it. Don't know what to tell you? We loved it.

This is wonderful couscous and a great alternative to rice! I caramelized the onions and it added a superb flavour. Enjoy!

This dish is so easy to make and works wonderfully as a side to moussaka. Everyone in my family loves it!

Wow - this is almost as easy as those pre-packaged boxes of couscous and tasts so much better!

This recipe was great! I made it for a crowd and got rave reviews. I used smokehouse almonds in it instead of almonds on top. It just needed a little "fluffing up" and it was perfect.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I'm not sure if I did something wrong. I cook constantly so I know I followed the recipe. The only thing I did was half it. The coucous turned out like soup. I used heath food store cousous and I wonder if it needs longer time to cook. Apparently there's quick-cooking.

Tasty and easy to make. Goes really well with just about every kind of lamb. I added golden raisins to the broth to plump up just before pouring it into the couscous mixture. Delicious!

I couldn't find a recipe for Israeli couscous, so I adapted this one which worked well. You need to simmer Israeli couscous for 10-15 minutes after the broth is added. Excellent with lamb, turkey, or grilled chicken.

Delicious alongside Lamb Chops with Cumin and Lime. Only made 1/3 of recipe, as there were only 2 of us for dinner, and still had quite a bit leftover. Yum!

Goes really nicely with the Morrocan Lamb - highly recommend the combination.
