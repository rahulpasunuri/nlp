What an incredible dessert! Because I'm not a torte/flan recipe seeker, I admit I did nearly have a panic attack when I was about to fold in the egg white- thinking it looked far too "clumpy" and dry for it to rise properly. But it worked out fine. This was a fiesta of flavours, with terrific depth and play off each other. Just make sure you boil that caramel sauce properly- nobody likes a gritty sauce. Not a bite was left on anyone's plate!

Scrumptious!!! I agree with the sticking to the rack part... but other than that, it was absolutely delicious! And not too difficult to make...

Very moist cake, delicious caramel topping, easy to make and a nice change for a Passover recipe from the usual flourless chocolate torte! A real hit!

I think you have to ignore the instruction about inverting the torte to cool. I've made this twice now, with a greased and ungreased pan, and both times it fell and stuck to the rack. In fact, greasing works better, because at least the sides fell cleanly and didn't tear. With the caramel on top it doesn't matter so much, but the sides look terrible. Also, if you're going to let the compote sit for more than a day, I'd cut way back on the ginger--it completely overpowers the mango, which on its own is a nice complement to the cake.

The torte was perfect - the egg whites kept it very light as opposed the the heavy feel often found with almond based cakes. The compote was very, very loose but very good on the torte as well as the next day on ice cream - I imagine very good on waffles too.
