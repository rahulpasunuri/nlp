Great receipe although the fruit took ages to free from membranes. Citrus sugar was great. I served this with yogurt at brunch.

Time consuming but easy way to prepare a reasonably healthy dessert. I made it the night before, and served it at a brunch. The citrus sugar was a hit.

This turned out really nicely. Everyone really enjoyed it. The citrus sugar is a lovely garnish.

Great! So easy. I make it without the grapes, and use both blood oranges and naval oranges with pink grapefruit. It looks beautiful. I also use more of the sugar/zest combo in the dish. It is so refreshing, and everyone seems to enjoy it.

This was a very nice and easy fruit dish. I liked the citrus sugar very much. I would serve it to my lady friends when we get together for lunch. I would not however recommend it for anyone with diabetes even with the sugar on the side. It still packs quite a sugar punch as it is!

Great recipe, will be an all time favorite of mine to serve to guests. I like the idea of haveing the sugar on the side for those who are not diabetic at my parties, the little bit that is in the recipe is okay for anyone to have. It is so hard to find desserts that diabetic can eat and are still pretty enough to set on the table and have the other guests enjoy it just as much.
