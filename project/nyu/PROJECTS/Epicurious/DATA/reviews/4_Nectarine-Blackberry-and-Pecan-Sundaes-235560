Made this for four so had some left over ingredients to make extra. Added sugar to the blackberries but not the nectarines. Simple, pretty and yummy. After we were done, we wondered what it would taste like with some raspberry liqueur (Chambord) added to the pureed blackberries. Second helpings were beyond compare!! Will serve again with the liqueur included!!!!

I loved this recipe. Easy, yet a wonderful combination of toasted nuts, fruits and ice cream. It looked impressive, too.

Fresh blackberries from the hedgerows of Devon and fresh nectarines provided a superb combination. Go easy on the sugar, though. I did not use any as the fruits and ice cream were sweet enough. Plan to try different fruit combinations, especially as I grow my own black currants.
