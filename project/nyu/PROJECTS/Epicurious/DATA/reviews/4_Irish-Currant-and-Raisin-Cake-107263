A terrific, family-friendly cake. I found the texture was best on the day it was made, but the taste held up for about three days afterwards. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I made this cake to use up some currants and golden raisins I've had in my pantry for a while. It's a solid coffee cake, not terribly sweet, and kind of light (as opposed to dense) textured. To reiterate ahfisher's comment, this cake does not need 55 minutes in the oven. The one I made was completely baked at the 45 minute mark, and next time I'll pull it out at 40 minutes to get a lighter golden color. Also, I don't think the parchment paper is necessary. I used it, but with my nonstick pan I would have been able to remove the cake with no problems.

This is a great recipe when you get last-minute guests or when you feel like an afternoon treat. I didn't make any ingredient substitutions, but I made a couple of procedural changes. I don't have a "heavy duty mixer", so I used my electric hand beater and it worked fine. (I gave the butter a head start by semi-melting it in the microwave first). I also found that the cake was done in 40 and that it tasted very nice almost right out of the oven! The taste was light and not too sweet. It's a perfect tea-time treat and I will definitely be making this again!

I did not have currants, they´re not easy to find them in mexico, so I used 1 cup of golden raisins, it came out real tasty, easy to prepare too. Simple and delicious!

I love this cake... I pour a cup +/- Irish Whiskey over it before letting it sit. Super Yu. Jameson is my favorite over the cake but Powers add a nice flavor of spice with the Whiskey

I made this cake for a St. Patrick's Day party this year. It was a huge success, and I've had requests to make it again next year. I did top it with a simple sugar glaze so it was a little more decorated though.

This is a wonderful cake. I've made it several times. I make a sugar syrup and add irish whiskey to it, then glaze the cooled cake with it-yum!

This was just lovely - good simple flavours and nice texture, a little crumbly which I like with a pale fruitcake (as opposed to the heavy dark versions). My husband and our cake-loving baby loved it too!

fell asleep and let it bake an extra 30-40 min, and it still turned out so tasty I ate 3 pieces!

I changed some of the things around. I used two eggs instead of one (maybe it's to do with the size of the eggs, but I didn't think one was enough). I used one cup of low-fat milk instead of 3/4. I made it with sultanas, ginger (in syrup) and walnuts--it came out really well.

Loved this recipe. It is very much like scone or Irish Soda Bread.
