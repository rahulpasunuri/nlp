A dandy omelet. @Cook4YT, if you don't remember it, how do you know it was good?

This was an excellent omelette recipe. I added caramelized onions and (2) cloves of sauteed garlic to the egg mixture. I didn't have parsley so I doubled the other herbs and it was excellent.

This is an excellent simple omelet. I make a version with whatever fresh herbs I have handy and fresh ricotta or other soft non-goat's milk cheese as I don't really like goat cheese. Ricotta works very well. When I have them, I add caramelized onions.

It's good, but not the one you will remember.

Made this omelet as part of my final practical exam in my Food Prep class. Easy to do, looked pretty on the plate, and flavors don't overwhelm the delivate flavor of the eggs. Very good.
