Have made this successfully several times. The last time, I did not have whole milk and 1% was fine. I try to separate the eggs in advance and let them sit at room temp for a while. I've changed the measurements to 6 whites and 4 yolks and reduced the other ingredients by about a third with no problem. Don't forget to leave time for the base to cool before adding the whites. I'd like to try freezing this, too (I hear this can be done with souffles prior to baking). Just ate leftover souffle for lunch and although it was no longer very puffy it was still quite good.

This is fantastic, as is. Filled probably a six-cup souffle dish, then put the rest in four small ramekins. The large souffle turned out the best - rose beautifully, browned perfectly on top. The small ones that I baked the following day didn't rise as much, and got a bit too brown on top. This is a keeper. Perfect for brunch - eggy and cheesy.

This is EXCELLENT. Easy to make, and the results are incomparable. I used Trader Joe's Gruyere/White Cheddar blend and their pecorino/romano/parmesan blend because that's what I had on hand. Don't omit the cayenne & nutmeg; they add the perfect subtle depth of flavor. The souffle baked perfectly and came out silky smooth. I love that you can add anything else you like...chives are great, or thyme or sage, or bacon or...? But just as written is yummy. Husband LOVED it too.

I have made this recipe dozens of times and it is perfect every time. I follow the recipe exactly. The batter is gorgeous and the souffle beautiful and delicious. I recommend measuring and prepping in advance so that you can work quickly.

Made recipe as it was written, and it was fast, easy and full of flavor. I used a really good Gruyere. It doesn't ask for much, so it's worth it to use a great cheese. An excellent base to get creative and build on with your favorite flavors, but truly excellent as it is.

This is one of my go-to recipes for a light lunch or dinner. I always serve it with a salad. It is the only souffle recipe I've been brave enough to make and it hasn't let me down. I do put the 10-cup souffle dish in the fridge to chill after buttering and coating with the Parmesan. If you are lucky to have any leftover...it is really yummy the next morning for breakfast.

We really enjoyed this souffle. Simple to make and great on Fri during Lent! Didnt want to buy gruyere so used an Italian shredded blend I already had along with good Parmesan. Halved the recipe and made in smaller ramekins. Served with crisp salad and we were good to go. Even meat-lover hubby was impressed.

This is the best souffle I have ever made. It is totally reliable. I have never had a failure. I've added vegetables and/or meat to it to great effect. I've halved it with success.

This is an amazing recipe! I adjusted the flavorings by using smoked paprika instead of cayenne and adding 1/2 tsp of dry mustard. Then, I substituted Tilamook sharp cheddar for the gruyere and bourbon for the white wine. After that I added the meat from 1 cooked and cleaned dungeness crab (around 6 oz. of meat total, I would guess) and 1 heaping tsp of minced fresh thyme. Due to the presence of the crab, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of milk, which caused the cooking time to be around 15 minutes longer. All that being said, it tasted absolutely wonderful! My husband and I couldn't stop eating it!

Okay, I did sub Jarlsberg (cheaper) and Romano (to make up for less flavor in the Jarlsberg) but it was super-salty. I think the recipe is good except for the salt, so I think I will try it again with half the salt. It would also be good with chopped chives and/or finely chopped ham...

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at making a souffle. The recipe was very easy to follow and clearly written. The results were nothing short of perfection and very impressive. Everyone loved it. I used gouda since gruyere was not readily available at my local market. I will make this again, but I will substitute crab for half of the cheese and serve it with a cucumber salad to make it more of a complete meal. I also would let it bake an additional five minutes to let it really set in the center. This was an outstanding experience!

Rating: 4
This is over the top delicious. I love to cook but had never tried a souffle - this one is easy, easy! My husband loved it. I now add a little mustard to it and a little more cheese after making it several times. Taking a tip from another review, I make half a recipe & we share the leftover one as a great breakfast or lunch. Highly recommend.

Blahhh. The texture of this souffle was really great, but it had absolutely no flavor. I'm not sure what it needs. Goat cheese? Lots more spices? Chives? Spinach? Something! My husband drowned it in hot sauce and I drowned it in chives and plain yogurt. Still, blah. I even used just laid local eggs which have so much flavor. Wish I hadn't wasted them on this. Wouldn't make this again without adding something flavorufl

VERY simple to make, I had no idea how a souffle was made 2 days ago but I just decided I was going to do it and I did it and it was perfection!

Rating: 3
Very good... I used Gouda which was nice. You really need to cut back on the salt, though. We love salt and this was way too salty. I would almost omit the salt altogether. This would be great with herbs or other additions like asparagus. I made a 4/5 batch to fit my 8 c souffle dish. Still could serve 3-4 with big portions. Will make again with adjustments.

Rating: 4
This is really good - pretty easy to make. It's a good idea to store the prepared souffle dish in the freezer while making the souffle mixture. I added some chopped garlic to the melted butter and was pretty generous with the cayenne (still wasn't very detectable). I will maybe add more next time. I used a 2 1/4 QT souffle dish and it turned out fine

Really tasty and surprisingly easy. Made this for Mom for Mother's Day this past year and it was a big hit. Definitely serve it ASAP! We had a tough time wrangling everyone to the table and the souffle began to fall after a few minutes.

I find this to be a tricky recipe, in spite of the seeming easiness of the ingredients. Think batter all over the kitchen walls and floor... I persist in this fantasy of being able to turn out soufflés in a 20-minute span after coming home from work on a weeknight. In reality, it's a lot harder than baking a cake especially if you are watching Ugly Betty on the side. In case you were wondering, I don't think you can get away with shirking on eggs (using 7 whites + 7 yolks instead of the 8+2 indicated, as it won't rise as much). My attempt takes a lot longer than is indicated to bake (full hour, this time). It does taste fantastic and both times I made it, my significant other, a diehard meat- and-potatoes type, has remarked about how satisfying it is to eat. It's full, rich but not greasy.

Rating: 4
I had never made souffle before - and whipping eggs is never something I would probably choose to do - however I needed to "get rid" of a bunch of Gruyere I had (and didn't like the cheese plain) - but boy was this ever good. I just put in one giant low rim steel/ceramic pan. I also made w/o wine. A bit of a pain to make - but very delicious.

Rating: 0
a good tip that i found great for a souffle is to use some truffle oil to add a nutty flavor to the souffle...the best recipe i have found was from a site called behindtheburner.com...I really liked that they use real-life restaurants chefs to show a demonstration video, and they give you a discount for buying the cheese for the souffle, too.

So easy and very popular with my husband and son. I doubled the recipe so I'd have leftovers... on day 2 we popped them out of the ramekins and ate them like bicuits -- sliced them in half and put a slice of ham for a sandwich!!! Mmmmmm.

This one's a keeper! I used additional whole milk instead of the white wine, and four 3/4 cup ramekins and one oval dish (probably about 5 cups large). I liked these quiches even more than the "Madame Quiche's Quiche Au Fromage" on this site. I plan on making it for my next brunch.

This was delicious. We had it with arugula salad with a honey-dijon champagne vinaigrette. Yum! I substituted some Brooklyn Lager beer for the white wine, and it tasted great! Will definitely make again, perhaps try some fresh herbs in the mix.

Fabulous recipe! For the cook from Canyon County - NO!! Souffle is not to be made into a casserole and should be nothing like it! Plus, the addition of extra water (from the spinach) would probably make the souffle not "puff" the way it should. Those of you who had watery results I am thinking that you either did not whip the whites enough or you let them sit before everything was put together. Heat and moisture create the steam that make souffle rise. Too much or too little will destroy it, making it a touchy dish

Cook, just cook the souffle a little longer, until it barely jiggles when shaken gently. Also, mine are always moist when I first open them up and then set with the heat as I serve them.

This was my very first souffle (made or eaten). I thought it was quite easy to prepare and perfect for a dinner party. However, for those who have more experience with souffles, please help me with this: I made thre recipe as written and I thought the souffle was a bit too moist (not watery, but too much moisture) in the center. Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid this, or is it supposed to be like that? It looked done when I took it from the oven and this was only discovered once it was served and too late to correct.

My first cheese souffle-- either eaten or cooked. Made it because my boyfriend begged me. It was a big hit with him. He thought it was off the hook, tasty, puffy, perfectly done and had me take pictures. For my part I have to say that the concept of a cheese souffle-- it's an awful lot of work for a puffed up quiche. One tip-- try to use a skillet bigger than 10". Mine is 10" and the volume of the batter made folding the egg whites in a challenge.

I've made this twice now as a dinner party appetizer and it was outstanding both times. For convenience, I used 7 yolks and 7 whites and the souffles still rose wonderfully. I made a few hours ahead up to the addition of the cheeses, then just whisked and added the whites when ready to cook.

I was a first time souffle maker and it turned out even better than the one in the picture! i'm giving it three stars because I guess I cant go completely nuts over a souffle (i'm a carb gal), but it was indeed delicious! A few pointers for people who want to make this for a dinner party: First off, go for it! I prepared most everything in advance... seperated the eggs, set out the flour and spices, greased and dusted the dish, etc, all before my guests showed up. When the time came to actually make the roux and then whip up the egg whites, then fold em all in, well it took about ten minutes total. So, in short, it is completely doable for entertaining if you just get your "mis en place" going. I served it with the ginger-syrup fruit salad from this site, and a nice mache salad with vinaigrette and varietal tomatoes. a great summer meal.

Just beyond perfect. I've used this recipe so often that I can make it now from memory, and it always comes out perfect. I've substituted countless cheeses (sheep's milk gouda is my favorite), but it's great just as written. A guest of mine from South Africa asked for the recipe to take hom! I've had guests scrape the baked souffle off the bottom of the baking sheet. It's just so good I could cry.

This recipe was so delicious. I'm always one to start changing things based on expediency (I don't have an item) or preference. But I made this strictly in accordance with the recipe, and it was fabulous. One small drawback: I could easily have eaten the whole thing because it was so delicious.

This was my first-ever souffle - and it turned out perfect! I didn't "crown" it because the first time I make something I like to go basic and only innovate should I decide to make it again, but it still rose about six inches over the edge of the dish. I was also pleasantly surprised to see at how quickly the the cooking went after the initial prep was done.

Finally, an always-perfect cheese souffle. You can change the cheeses (my favorites are Dry Jack and Everona), use skim milk if you want, answer the phone in the middle of everything, and make it on a humid July evening, and it will still be impressive and wonderful. With an organic baked potato and an arugula salad, it's hard to beat.
