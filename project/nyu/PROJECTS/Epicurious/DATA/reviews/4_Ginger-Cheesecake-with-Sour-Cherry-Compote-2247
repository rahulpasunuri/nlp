I didn't use any candied ginger. Put 2 Tbs fresh ginger in the cheesecake with a plain graham cracker crust. Very good! Light ginger flavor went well with the sour cherries. Added corn starch to make the sauce thicker for topping. Used frozen sour pie cherries and omitted the lemon juice.

I made this recipe one year and it was terrific. The next year, I couldn't find the recipe, so made a different ginger cheesecake recipe - which tasted awful by comparison. Last year I was happy to have found the recipe again. It IS a strong flavor if one is used to the usual vanilla-tasting New York cheesecake, which I love. However, I did not take any "forks" off for this because it is what it claims to be. It's a bit strong, but it is a nice flavor. We eat it at Thanksgiving. This year, to change things up a bit, I'm going to make a cranberry topping instead of the cherry and I hope it will give a similar ironic twist to the over all flavor. BTW - I am writing from Denmark, where I live currently, and there is sadly no equivalent to gingerbread cookies or vanilla wafers. Only a more course pfefferneus-type cookie. So I am still experimenting to develop a comparable crust. I can't wait to get started making it for this year!

Made this delish cheesecake for Christmas Eve and it was a great hit - very rich and gingery and the cherry compote was perfect. I used a bag of frozen Door County cherries and they made a lush dark sauce (I thickened with a bit of cornstarch, too) with barely-burst fruit - yum! Also followed the 20-70- 15 cooking recommendation and added the pan of water on the rack below my cheesecake - first time in forever that my cheesecase hasn't cracked (even though it would have been pretty well hidden). Beautiful!

Yet another excellent cheesecake recipe from epicurious.com! I made this for Christmas, and baked the extended time based on other reviews. It was a hit!

I'm not a cheesecake person, but this one was fabulous. I increased the cooking time over the covered cake by about 20 minutes, and probably could have let it go a bit longer. I added an extra TB of fresh ginger and some cornstarch to the cherry compote to make it thicker.

A must try if you love ginger and cherries together! Lots of ginger flavor. I used light cream cheese and it workled fine. Wanted a thick cherry topping so I added a lttle cornstarch to the lemon juice and stirred that in after the rest came to a boil and continued to boil for 1 minute. Used frozen pie cherries and the contrast between the ginger and cherries was perfect.

I left out the crystallized ginger because it cost $12 a bottle and I hate having a cupboard full of obscure spices I can't use. I added a little more ground ginger in the topping. I added macadamia nuts to the crust. I tried using frozen sour cherries and I think it added too much water as compote should have been much thicker. Baked the extra time as recommended by previous cook. Taste combo was too die for if you like fresh ginger and sour cherries.

This cheesecake is truly decadent. I read the previous review noting the additional baking time and found it to be just right; 20 minutes, 70 minutes, then 15 minutes w/topping. I used canned cherries which worked out wonderfully. This recipie is wonderful with a black tea at tea time. Truly a keeper.

My friends loved this! To bake, however, I filled a glass 9x13 pan 2/3 full with water and put that on the lowest rack, with the cheesecake above it [see recepe comments for ginger & white chocolate cheesecake -- that's where I got the idea]. This prevented cracking. I did have to cook it longer as well: I baked it uncovered for 20 minutes, then covered for another 70 minutes (until center was reasonably set) and then another 15 minutes with the topping. The first day, the ginger flavor was a bit too much, but it mellowed the 2nd day. I would consider making the crust with 1/2 or 1/3 Nilla wafers and the rest with ginger snaps, to make the ginger flavor a little more subtle.

A fun and tangy recipe. A big hit. I found candied ginger that was fairly flat, and cut out flowers with a cookie cutter to garnish.

This cheesecake has an interesting flavor from the ginger. I had a little trouble with the crust sticking to the pan when the cheesecake was served. I also baked it for longer than the directions indicate and the texture was still a bit too soft and mushy in my opinion. The cherry compote was a nice contrast to the pronounced ginger taste. This is a good recipe to make if you are looking for something different.

Truly the best cheesecake I've ever had/made! Even though the cake ran (I think I overbeat it), people were eating it out of the pan with spoons. Can't wait to make it correctly!

My children begged for more! This was an absolute hit at the dinner party. I will make this cheesecake again and again..

This got rave reviews from my friends despite the fact that I made it with fat-free cream cheese and sour cream and without the cherry compote. It was only when people were commenting on how tasty and how light it was that I revealed I'd "cheated" them on butterfat. . . at which point everyone positively ATTACKED what was left.

One of the best cheesecakes I've made. This would also be a great fall and winter dessert. As fresh sour cherries were not available, I used dried ones and reconstituted them with boiling water, adding the fresh lemon juice and only about 1/4 cup of the sugar with great results. (Use a slotted spoon for the cherries as it is quite watery.) Excellent!

Delicious, and the cherry compote made it not too rich at the end of a big meal. I thickened the cherry juice just a bit with about a tablespoon of cornstarch.
