Wow! What a simple but divine marriage of flavours! Followed this recipe pretty much exactly except that at the end, I tossed all the pasta in the reduced sauce, then added the chicken and extra sauce on top. YUMMY!

This recipe was really good with a few key changes. The instructions for cooking the chicken were way off and the pasta amount was impractical. I reviewed the article, with my changes, in detail here: http://misschefy.wordpress.com

The flavors are delicious. I recommend browning the chicken in much less olive oil (around 3T), poured directly from the sundried tomato jar. Deglaze with a drinkable red wine. Then toss in the entirety of the sauce ingredients--you'll probably want to double the liquid components of the sauce. Simmer for longer than called for--at least 20 minutes. Divine!

My boyfriend just joined a cycling team. He requests that I make him this dish the night before he races. We have renamed it "Power Pasta" in our house. I made some slight adjustments. First, I make a sauce by using less olive oil, just a few tablespoons, and in addition to the balsamic, I throw in some red wine (whatever I'm drinking when I'm cooking this dish is what goes in) - maybe about 1/4 cup or so, and then all of the other ingredients (except chicken). Then, I brown the chicken breast in a large sauted pan. Pour the sauce over, and then I let it reduce around the chicken breast. It comes out so rich and delicious. It's fabulous!

I've made this dish many times and it is always delicious. I often add an extra can of diced tomatoes, portobello mushrooms and a splash of wine. It is delicious with fresh basil and romano cheese! Made it for my boyfriend this weekend to rave reviews!

This is not only easy but very good...as someone already noted in one of the reviews, it's a bit too oily. I would cut back on the oil a bit the next time I make this dish. I also added a clove of minced garlic and cooked the chicken using the entire dressing instead of just half like the recipes calls for. I served it with grated parmesean cheese on top. I think that I'll try it with olives or capers next time.

This dish is full of flavor and easy to prepare. I made it for guests who were impressed with the taste and how beautifully it plates - very colorful and fresh. I used a mix of spinach and egg fettucine for color, and doubled the sauce to make sure there was enough, this based on previous reviews. My one criticism is that the dish is so heavy on olive oil that it feels a bit heavy overall. Next time I'd use less of the sauce to simmer with the chicken so that the chicken broth was the primary poaching liquid instead, and would then use the sauce more as a finisher. For variety I could see tossing in kalamata olives or feta cheese as well. Overall, a lovely dish and I'll make it again.

I reviewed this recipe before after I had to substitute almost everything in it for something else, and it was delicious. Then I made it according to the recipe and didn't like it as much... so my bastardaized verions stands - extra garlic, beer instead of broth, cook everything together. It's perfect every time.

This was the first time I've made this dish and it was a big hit! It was delicious!!! I omitted the red onions since I don't like them. I would definitely make this again. I used shell pasta which made it easier for my toddler to pick up. I also used ground chicken, which made preparing the dish even easier.

Rating: 4
Delicious - my husband called it "painfully good". I used black olives instead of sun-dried tomatoes because that was what we happened to have around, and it was delicious that way too. The way the onions are cooked in this recipe they become sweet but keep a lot of their crispness.

This was an excellent winter's evening meal. I tossed in some kalamata olives and toasted pine nuts but doesn't need that at all. I just love toasted pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes in a dish.

oh yes, and I threw all of the sauce in with the chicken and cooked on low for a while.

ok, I bastardized this recipe in the extreme and it was still delicious. I made this the other night when I was drastically low on groceries and staring into my fridge going "hmm.. what can I make with a chicken breast and a can of sun-dried tomatoes?" No onion - used extra garlic. No fresh basil (with the cold weather, my plants are not producing as quickly as I'd like), so used dry. I used half of the oil from the can of tomatoes (which also had some capers and seasonings of its own) and half plain olive oil. Got to the last step and realized that I had nothing resembling broth anywhere in my house... finally settled on a half a bottle of the beer I was drinking. Served with tortellini instead of linguine. Completely freaking delicious! couldn't even talk during dinner.. too yummy..

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe,it is wonderful!! I would not change a thing. I am anxious to try the dressing on our salad!

This is sooo wonderful it has become a staple at our house. I double the dressing and cook all of it except the basil which I add at the very end to keep it's flavor. Everytime I make this, my daughter calls all her friends and they show up for dinner LOL.

Rating: 3
This was super easy and very tasty. Like others, we topped it with some shredded parmesan and added the linguine to the pan, to cover it with the sauce. The fresh basil is crucial to this - I would not make it without it.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite recipes on Epicurious - and surprisingly so! I didn't think such simple ingredients could go so well together. I would not change a thing - the chicken stays moist, the basil and sundried tomatoes play well off each other - and the sugar gives it that extra oomph that sets it apart from other similar dishes.

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious, with the following variation: after putting the dressing together, I cooked it through on a low heat, so that that the onion and garlic were not raw. This sweetened the onion nicely too. I also added freshly-grated parmesan on top as a garnish. Very flavourful. (Also try with tuna instead of the chicken!)

Rating: 4
I cooked the onions and garlic with the chicken (which I cubed beforehand). I omitted the basil, and used the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. Also, I took the advice of a previous reviewer and tossed the noodles (I used ziti) in with the chicken and sauce (didn't reserve any on the side). Got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe!

Rating: 3
Very good and very easy! I didn't have fresh basil so I had to use dried sweet basil. To make up for this, I served this with fresh spinach leaves to be placed on top of the noodles prior to the sauce. I don't care for sundried toms so I drained a can of fire-roasted toms with green chiles and used that instead. Very good!

Rating: 3
I also wanted to add that once the chicken was cooked and sliced, I added the pasta to the pan to coat with the sauce instead of just pouring it over - that way the pasta heats up and all of the strands have that lovely sauce!

Rating: 3
This is my new favorite dish - not only is it delicious, but it is a cinch to prepare! I did make a few modifications: I added 1 more tablespoon of vinegar, I used less olive oil (just a bit more than 1/3 of a cup), I left out the onions completely, used dried instead of fresh basil and added ALL of the "dressing" with the chicken broth. This comes out delicious every time. It's quick enough to make on a weeknight, but also yummy and pretty enough to make for a date! Next time I may add a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat. This has absolutely found its way into my "keeper" file!

Rating: 3
big success with the kids. I'd cut back on the amount of oil, and in January, with it's paucity of basil, used coriander instead. hope I remember to try this when I have basil overflowing in the garden in 6 months.

Rating: 4
This is elegant, beautiful and tasty. The only thing I did different was that I did not have fresh boneless chicken breasts but I did have some pre-cooked chickien breast pieces from Costco. I added a couple of handfuls of the chicken to the sauce for a couple of minutes near the end of cooking just to eat it through. Hubby inhaled it. This is a definite keeper.

This is an easy, robustly flavorful dinner, which is easily pulled together on a weeknight. Both times I've prepared it, I've used 2/3 cup of finely chopped onion and liked the results. The second time I prepared this dish, I was dismayed to discover I was out of olive oil. I substituted canola oil with good results; the flavor was simply milder.

Rating: 1
I was a little disappointed with this recipe, for several reasons. Maybe with some modifications, it could be better. One is to cook the onions. They onions and raw garlic was very overpowering in a pasta dish. Two is to heat the sauce with the pasta. When you add it at the end it is too cold. This actually would be great as a cold pasta salad.

We love pasta but I rarely make something that tastes as good as the recipe looks. But my husband said this was a keeper. The only request he had was that I add something to give it a bit more "kick" next time. Any suggestions?

I love olive oil but this is far too much. Use dry sundried tomatoes instead of the ones packed in oil, cut the olive oil by 1/2 and it is OK but not a keeper.

We've made this one again and again as a simple week-night meal (relatively quick, too!) Every time I've made it with the full amount of oil, but I will try reducing it next time as suggested and see how it works... I also eliminate the onions and usually add 2 cloves of garlic to cut down the sweetness a bit. The dressing is also good over a salad and the whole dish is wonderful as a next-day cold pasta and chicken salad.

I have made this dish several times and it is always delicious. Wonderfully easy to prepare which makes it great for crowds. Haven't come across a guest who didn't rave about this dish. Since our family adores olive oil I do not reduce the amount very much at all.

Really tasty, simple dish. I agree with other reviewers that it is too oily though. Next time I'll reduce the oil by about a third. Added roasted pine nuts - Yummy!

Nope. Too sweet and surprisingly bland. Perhaps if you up the garlic, eliminate the sugar, and change the balsamic to white balsalmic vinegar you might have something. As my husband said, this would be better over salad greens than pasta and chicken.

A wonderful dish, we make a shortcut version of it with precooked Tyson chicken and a can or two of the new Hunts "Diced Tomatoes with Balsamic Vinegar, Basil, and Olive Oil" and some added sun dried tomatoes for flavor.

This recipe is the greatest. I always make the dressing ahead of time, and I can cook it in about 15 minutes flat when my husband gets home. I make this ALL the time. I have made the following modifications, but I think it all depends on your own taste: I use 6 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup red onion, can subs the basil with 3 tbsp pesto (or even do a little of both), 1/4 cup of oil, 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and increase linguini anywhere from 1 to 1.5lb. Top it with freshly grated parmesan, and you have a winner that can be served during the week or for company.
