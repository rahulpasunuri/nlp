Marcella Hazan has an even better recipe. Instead of pancetta, she uses anchovy fillets as the base of the sauce. You warm them in a skillet with olive oil to melt them. Add your cooked broccoli to finish the sauce. When the pasta is done, add it directly to the skillet containing your sauce, along with your cheese and a bit of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Heat the mixture until blended well. It makes for a surprisingly creamy sauce. I like to add extra pepperoncino for more heat!
