I took the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of spice to the caramel filling. I was instantly sorry that I did. The wonderful caramel aroma was instantly gone. Next time I will omit the almond extract as well. Caramel, vanilla and apple is more than enough. No need to guild the lily.

This recipe was so amazing! I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner we were attending and everyone raved....a couple of adjustments I made: One, the host has a gluten allergy, so I cooked the crisp separately on a cookie sheet for 20 minutes while the apples were cooking on another rack. Honestly, I think this made the recipe even better! The crisp was SO perfectly crunchy! Two, I added cinnamon, all spice, ginger and sugar to the apples and tossed them before adding the caramel. Again, I think this really made the dish pop. The spice was one of the best parts, and without it I think it would have been a bit bland. I did make a bit of extra caramel as well based on other reviews. Topped with some vanilla ice cream....to die for! Even with the apples and ice cream alone, my friend loved it and appreciated the gluten free option.

I doubled the topping and made half again of the caramel, both of which I would do again (caramel is 1 cup sugar, scant 1/3 cup liquid and 4.5 T butter). I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to the topping, which I probably wouldn't do again because it detracted from the apple flavor; also added 1/2 oatmeal which made the topping too hard for my taste. I subbed apple brandy for the liquid in the caramel, which I wouldn't do again because it didn't add anything. I would probably go with the gentleman's suggestion of using frozen apple concentrate to boost the apple flavor in the caramel. It was good, easy and fun to make, but not really special enough for Thanksgiving.

I also doubled the topping (but used 1 C of oatmeal instead of a second cup of flour). I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 t ground ginger as some other reviewers suggested. Unfortunately, I think this covered the taste of the caramel, but it was a fabulous crisp regardless. Even better cold the next day!

Searching for a recipe that didn't include dough for a Thanksgiving dessert to bring to dinner, I came across this recipe. DELICIOUS! Taking the advice of others I added cinnamon to the caramel and topping mixture as well as doubling the topping. This will be my go-to recipe for winter desserts from now on.

This was delicious!! I made it gluten free by using some gluten free bread croutons that I were extra from my stuffing. I also did half oatmeal. Loved the caramel flavor and the almonds!!

We love this recipe and I have made it several times. The caramel really elevates this crisp. We like a bit more texture in our crisp, so I use a mixture of 1/2 cup each of oats and flour for the topping.

Well, yes, I will make it again, but here is a simple but worthwhile tip. Forget the quarter cup of apple juice and replace it with a quarter cup of frozen apple juice concentrate! Even with drier apples, this will spike up the flavor and moisture on most apple baking creations, including pies. Although a recipe I found calling for some apple concentrate did not recommend frozen concentrate,this is a knock-out flavor helper.

This is an exceptional apple crisp. I doubled the topping as suggested and was glad I did. I also made a bit more caramel... Served with creme fraiche. I loved it, my friends loved it.. Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent Apple Crisp. More prep work than your average crisp, but better than average. I took the advice of others & doubled the topping. I made the topping in advance & kept it in the refrigerator for 2 days -- the crisp was still great. I used Gala & Honeycrisp apples. Heated the leftover crisp in the oven the next day, still wonderful. I would make it for company. Enjoy!

Delish! Warning... this might be obvious to people who cook all the time, but DO NOT take a little taste with your finger when making the caramel. It will harden on your finger and burn it badly. Yep... learned that the hard way. :( Other than that, I followed the advice of other reviews. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice to the topping. Just several dashes of all 3. And, I did the 1/2 flour, 1/2 oatmeal. It was really good. Other change: I didn't have apple juice, but I did have chardonnay. Used 1/4 cup of that instead and it was perfect. Other change: I used 3 different kinds of apples that I got at the farmer's market. That made it interesting and we were able to taste the different apples and see which ones we liked the best. I peeled them and then used the apple corer/slicer set to 16 pieces. So fast and easy. I also coarsely chopped whole almonds instead of getting the pre-sliced ones. Oh and you must serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. My friends and LOVED it.

Boring. I was really disappointed in this recipe. No caramel flavor.

I tweaked this recipe a bit and loved the outcome. I couldn't imagine an apple crisp without spices, so I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon cloves to the topping. I also subbed old fashioned oats for half the flour to give it more texture and crunch. I followed the recipe exactly in every other way and it turned out wonderfully. As another reviewer noted, the caramel seems a bit lumpy at first, but it cooks down beautifully in the oven.

This was incredible! I forgot to add the slivered almonds but did add the extract. Yum, yum, yum, yum!!!

Really great flavors and the caramel is an excellent touch. I did not have almonds or almond extract so I used walnuts instead. I also doubled the filling (but only had to use 3/4 of the batch). I found that my topping started to brown in places 15 min in, even in the middle rack, and so ended up turning down the heat to 325 so the top wouldn't burn. Baked at 325 and then turned it up to 350 for the last 7-8 minutes and it finished in about an hour.

I first I thought that this recipe was flawed. When you mix the caramel with the apples it hardens on contact and clumps. But is all disperses evenly in the oven! This was so good it should be illegal! I didn't have almonds or almond extract but it was still very tasty. It wouldn't hurt to double the topping as the first review says. Very yummy, I will make it again.

Delicious. I doubled the topping portion (but only used 1/2 c. sliced almonds). I used 12 medium sized apples (could have doubled it to 14). Filling - I used cider instead of juice and tossed a small shot of apple liqueur into the mix (did NOT double the caramel portion). This filled a large baking dish nicely. Took right at an hour to bake. It was devoured. Will definitely make again, the almonds and almond extract were a nice touch.
