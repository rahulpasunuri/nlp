Excellent! I used an organic chicken from Trader Joe's. I made only 1/4 of the Mustard Vinaigrette recipe because I didn't make the potato dish that uses it.

So easy and delicious! Not something I'll make all the time, but if roasting a chicken is ever in order, this is my go-to!

This is my husband's favorite roast chicken recipe. It makes good use of my rosemary and sage plants.

I liked this recipe. Don't know how often I will make it though. I don't think it's good enough to make me want to put it in regular rotation. Next time I will let the chicken marinate wiht the vinegrette a little longer so the taste really seeps through.

So lovely. But here is the thing, Even tho the vinaigrette kept the bird so juicy, It would have been criminal not to make a sauce out of the goobers in the bottom of the roasting pan. 1/2 hr before chicken done, I threw some very small red skinned taters in the bottom. When they were tender, plated the chicken and taters, and made a gravy with a wild shroom mix and a roux w/chicken stock. Oh, so good. Hubby was so happy. Dipped some of bird in the vinaigrette and will save the restof that sauce for another use. Definitely on the list to make again.

This is a delicious recipe & perfect with the recipe for potato & haricort salad with the same Mustard Vinaigrette that was in the same issue. I've made it many times over the year & it is always perfect!

I would give this recipe 5 forks if I could! I have been making this for years and chicken is always very flavorful and moist. It's worth the little bit of effort that goes into it! Highly recommended!

Delicious vinaigrette. Used these on chicken breasts roasted in the oven - this was delicious. The white wine vinegar brightens the flavor. I actually increased the sage tremendously and found that to be a nice change.

Where is the recipe for the mustard vinaigrette????

This has become my "stand-by" chicken recipe. It's just as wonderful for guests as it is for a family dinner. I have substituted fresh tarragon with equally impressive results. I have found that I can prepare the chicken up to roasting at least one day ahead then put it into the oven when needed. This also serves as a marinade to intensify the flavors.

Oops! Wrong recipe! That review was meant for a Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Pasta recipe on marthastewart.com.... it's good =)

I make a brussels sprouts dish similar to this one's flavor, but without the pasta, and the sprouts are blackened to give it great flavor. I will make this again when I want a more filling side. Great!

I decided to grill the chicken after reading another's review. Really easy and has a wonderful flavor. It's the first chicken recipe that my husband has gone nuts for and any left-overs are great in a salad.

I have made this chicken so many times since it was published, that I know it by heart. It always receives raves from my guests, whether I serve it cold for a Hollywood Bowl picnic or hot on the table at home. The vinaigrette paste works well on smaller chickens and game hens, as well.

This was soo good!! I didn't have fresh herbs or even sage. I can only imagine how good it would have been with them!! Also, the mustard vinagrette (which I made with honey mustard) was awesome!!

Rating: 4
This was sooo good! I used dried rosemary since i didn't have fresh, and didn't even use sage. I can only imagine how great it would have been if I had! And the butter salsa is just to die for! I used the leftover butter the next day to saute chicken breasts.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe for years! It's quick and easy; can be done with boneless chicken breasts if you don't want to do the whole chicken. Just adjust the cooking time. The Terragon Dressing is great as a side sauce, on veggies and, or for grilling. You have to try it!

I have been making this recipe for many years and thought it was time to give my praise to it online. It is a GREAT coating for chicken! I have made it in the oven, as the recipe envisions, but now I usually double the vinaigrette and cover smaller whole chickens (4 lb chickens - 2 or 3 of them) with the vinaigrette and throw them on the grill. Since there is no sugar in the vinaigrette, the coating doesn't burn and the chickens come out moist and the flavor is fabulous.

My family loved this recipe, something different from your everyday roasted chicken! Very savory - great for company. I also used the vinegarette for roasting vegetables.

Different, and very good -- though not as easy as just sticking the thing in the oven with some butter and herbs. This will go in the "company" roasted chicken recipes.

Good, but other roast chicken recipes on this website are better. Probably won't repeat. Didn't like the vinaigrette served on the side. Weird texture for that purpose.

My husband claimed this was "the best" chicken he ever had. While that might be overstating it, it was excellent.

Loved it, tasty and easy! I made the full mustard recipe and stuffed extra under the skin (breast and legs). Don't skimp on the fresh herbs! For a 5.5 lb chicken it took an extra 15 minutes to cook than the recipe mentioned (check the legs). I sauteed portabello mushrooms with some drippings and butter as a vegetable side. Looks elegant. Very easy.

I made this for my sister who is recovering from an illness and it really brightened her day! I used a 6 1/2 pound roasting chicken and felt like it needed about 30 more mins of cooking time more than what was called for. I served it with oven roasted winter vegetables and a polenta recipe from this web site. Yummy!

the vinaigrette made about twice as much as you will need for the recipe and the cooking time is definitely not long enough. I had a 4 pound chicken (smaller than called for) that was still uncooked in the designated time.

Wonderful. My garden still has sage and rosemary, and what a treat to use them in such quantity! A great autumn Sunday dinner. And leftovers to look forward to. Haven't tried it for picnics yet.

This was my first time roasting a whole chicken. I roasted two four pound chickens and added lemon slices inside each. They were tender and juicy. Made a gravy from the drippings and the remaining vinaigrette.

Heavenly! Perhaps the best roast chicken I have ever made! Also only used 1/2 cup olive oil. Served remaining sauce over steamed broccoli. It was scrumptious.

This recipe makes an excellent roast chicken! I followed one cook's advice to use less oil and another persons suggestion to use all the vinaigrette during cooking. I turned the vinaigrette into a marinade, pureeing 1/8 c olive oil, lots of sage and rosemary and shallots, garlic and some red onion that was sitting in the fridge. I marinated the chicken for 48 hours and roasted it at 375 for an hour and 15 mins. Delicious!!!

MMMMM! I roasted some sliced yams in the pan with the chicken. I made about half the vinaigrette in the recipe and slathered it all over - it was delicious!

I cooked this with a 4 lb chicken. The chicken was very juicy and I made a gravy from the pan juices. I would cook the chicken with the vinaigrette again, but the vinaigrette was too strong for eating or dipping with the cooked chicken. I am going to use the rest of it to glaze a half of leg of lamb tomorrow, I think it will be outstanding.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this recipe - everyone who's tasted it says it's the best roast chicken they've ever eaten. The only thing I change is I put the whole vinaigrette in, on and under the chicken before cooking - I don't save any for later. It makes it incredibly moist and tender..

Rating: 4
whoa! my first roast chicken, and it was terrific. i roasted two, 4 lb. young chickens in the same pan and used all of the vinaigrette (not just 1 cup)-- i put more than recommended under the skin and over the top, and used the rest for serving sauce. the chicken was moist, the skin was crisp, and the boys were happy!

Excellent vinaigrette! Added 2-3 cloves minced garlic to the vinaigrette sauce during preparation. Also coated chicken liberally both under the skin on front and back sides as well as on the outside during baking. Chicken turned out extremely moist and tasty. Definitely would make again!

This was an excellent recipe. I used half the amount of oil called for in the vinaigrette without any problems.

This is a wonderful recipe, I'll definitely make it again. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used 1/2 the amount of dried herbs, and I also used a white onion instead of shallots. I put more under the skin than the recipe called for, so next time I'll double the vinaigrette recipe. Plus, it's just so good on top of the chicken, I'll have to make more!

This was my first ever roast chicken and it turned out perfectly! Took a little time, but the vinaigrette adds a really nice flavor and the chicken was perfectly moist. The extra dressing served on the side was also a hit. Unfortunately no leftovers to try the next day, but will definitely make again.

Simply excellent! I just used the vinaigrette to marinade 3 chicken breasts. I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted the following. Plain mustard 1/4, 1 tbs honey, dry sherry for the vinegar, 2 tbs balsamic vinegar, poultry spice, & coriander seeds. The chicken came out moist and tender. The rosemary definitely added such a nice flavor.

Delish! I cut the calories a bit by replacing just shy of half the oil in the vinaigrette with chicken broth and didn't miss a thing.. the vinagrette is great with shrimp or scallops also

This is a delicious roasted chicken recipe. I left out sage and it was perfect. Enjoyed it hot and cold next day.

I found the vinaigrette and roast chicken pairing too heavy. The vinaigrette itself is excellent. In France I have had stewed hen or boiled plain chicken served cold with a similar vinaigrette and I think I prefer that less greasy pairing.

The most consistently best company main course yet! The wonderful aromas welcome guests, and the presentation is beautiful. A simple romaine, apple, red onion, and crumbled roquefort salad with raspberry vinaigrette, and crusty french bread round it out with lots of wine!

This is an outstanding recipe, the mustard vinaigrette is wonderful! I used a cut chicken and rubbed the vinaigrette under and on the skin, then let set for 20 minutes before baking, it was so moist and delicious, worth every minute in the kitchen!!!

Wonderful! A huge hit! I forgot to print the vinaigrette recipe, so I used one from another cookbook that called for balsamic. Very very good.

When preparing this dish I made two mistakes which may have contributed to making it even more delicious: I put the chicken breast side down on a rack in a roasting pan, and I broiled it for the first 30 to 45 minutes. To make up for those mistakes, I basted the back with what was left of the vinaigrette, and I turned the chicken over and broiled the breast side for the last 5-10 minutes. As a result, the skin was really nicely cooked and the breasts were incredibly moist. I also strained the pan juices, removed most of the fat, and served it on the side. It was very, very good!

This is a fantastic and easy recipe! I did not want to do a whole chicken, so made it with boneless, skinless pieces. It worked beautifully and will make a lovely dinner for guests.

This was delicious! It was a little time consuming but well worth the effort. I would suggest serving it hot. I have not tried the cold version but I roasted the chicken and served it immediately with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. Surprisingly, the pan drippings made an interesting and delicious gravy...and I don't even like gravy!

This is one of the best roast chicken recipes I've made. It is excellent for leftovers and the mustard vinaigrette is delicious. I've used it on a salad with the leftover chicken. Also, you can mix it with a little mayonnaise to make a chicken salad. It's a keeper!
