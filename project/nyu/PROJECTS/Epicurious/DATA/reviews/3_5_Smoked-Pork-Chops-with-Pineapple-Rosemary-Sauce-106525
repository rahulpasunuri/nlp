I used fresh pineapple, but did not go through the process of making the juice. I used canned, unsweetened juice instead. We found the reduced sauce incredibly sweet. The rosemary and garlic flavors were difficult to discern. I doubt if we will use this recipe again. To the cook from Okanagan,BC: Your description of the smoked pork chops is right on! Smoked chops are like ham steak wannabees.

The pineapple sauce has a nice tang. I combined some canned juice with some fresh pineapple chunks from the produce counter to come up with the required amount of liquid. But this is really just another meal, not something to write home about.

I tried a variation on this smoked chop & fruit theme... per person, layer the following in a foil packet: half a yam (sliced thin and tossed with olive oil, salt & pepper), one smoked pork chop, one small ripe peach (peeled and cut in thick wedges), chopped green onions, and a rosemary sprig (or use rosemary-infused olive oil). Cook packets on BBQ 20 mins. Delicious! The yams cooked in the smoky pork juice were especially good. My husband suggested smearing a little dijon mustard on the chops first too. One question though... the chops I got were more like ham in a pork chop disguise... is that how they're supposed to be? I was expecting something with the meat texture of a real pork chop and a smoky taste. (P.S. When I say "yam" I mean the orange ones. I think some places they're called sweet potatoes.)

This is a wonderful recipe for smoked pork chops. And for the user who asked if anyone has tried the recipe with canned pineapple...I did. I have tried both ways and for the extra trouble of using fresh, I will forever use the canned. I am fortunate to live near Usingers in Milwaukee, they have the best smoked pork chops. This is by far the best recipe I have found for smoked chops.

the rosemary flavor was a perfect match for the sweetness from the pineapple. Simply great. I am wondering if anyone has tried this using canned pineapple juice?
