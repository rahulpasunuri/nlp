Excellent! I only had tuna packed in water so I added a little EVOO to the tuna. A nice twist on traditional tuna salad.

Excellent! The ingredients work very well together. Easy to make. Heads above what you could buy in a restaurant. Only change was to use a half pound of fresh tuna cooked in a pan. Shredded after cooled. Next time might try adding capers. Highly recommended.

Wonderful take on tuna salad - this is in regular rotation at my house! Works best if you can make the tuna salad at least a few hours in advance to allow the flavors to develop. Also works well as a salad or a stuffed tomato. I've made it with mayonnaise and without, using a bit of extra olive oil. Fresh basil is also a nice addition.

This is really good. I had some fresh tuna on hand, which I pan-seared in olive oil on both sides and then allowed to cool in the pan, which cooked it through. I flaked it fairly coarsely and tossed it with some olive oil and juices from the pan before combining with the other ingredients. After tasting, I added capers to the salad, which I think improves it.

I've made this three times and it's a really nice, sophisticated take on plain old tuna salad. The lemon juice and olive oil make it great! Freshly ground black pepper is a must on top.

Wow! The best tuna salad I've ever made! And even better, I had everything on hand - at 5:30 I was wondering what the heck I was going to make for dinner, and an hour later we were eating this lovely dish. Made the salad as written (I used about triple the red onion because we love onion), and used Tonnino tuna from my local organic grocer. It costs 5 times as much, but is 5 times better than your tinned tuna. In lieu of sandwiches, I served it on a bed of lettuce & arugula w. Italian dressing, a sliced hard-boiled egg & half a sliced tomato, and then put the tuna on top of half an avocado. Sort of child of tuna salad & salad nicoise. This is definitely going in my standard repetoire - especially with summer coming. Hubby (who is trying to lose a few pounds) loved it too!

This was such a nice break from the standard tuna sandwich. I didn't have red pepper so I substituted sundried tomatoes. Amazing.

Although I am not much of a tuna fan, this salad is over the top. I added chopped parsley and replaced roasted red peppers for pimentos since that is what I had on hand. Excellent as a stuffing for an avocado half or tomato too.

Best tuna sandwich ever. Found that if you let the ingredients drain a while then make the sandwich its not so wet.

This was outstanding, and a fast recipe to prepare!! I used only 2 tbs of mayo, (the olive oil mayo is 1/2 the fat without sacrificing taste), and increased lemon juice by 2 tbs. I also added pepper- AMAZING!! We serving it in whole wheat wraps and is the perfect summer lunch

Great all-around recipe. I added a few things: 1 t. whole-grain mustard 1 t. anchovy paste 1/2 clove minced garlic small handful chopped basil *MMMMMMM* If you are feeling inspired, use home-made mayo...*drool*

why was I ever eating tuna packed in water? this is incredible. mouth-watering. I used regular black olives instead of kalamata and regular sandwich bread because I'm cheap.

Left over fresh tuna from the grill; divine! Made this exactly as stated and it was wonderful! A keeper.

Very, very good flavors. I have made this with all kinds of olives and it's REALLY good in a tuna melt with provolone or swiss cheeses. Definite keeper.

Tasty and easy to make. This will become a lunch staple for a while yet. As others did, I added some basil and toasted the baguette.

My new favourite Tuna Salad! Great flavour with the olives and lemon juice. I had to make some substitions to work with what i had on hand: used a little bit of sundried tomato pesto along with some finely chopped red pepper as i didn't have any roasted red peppers or celery. I also added some chopped fresh basil. Delicious!

This is a great, fancier-than-usual tuna salad that I'm happy to serve as a casual but nice lunch when entertaining.

Rating: 3
I would definitely make this again, and judging from my husband's response, he will definitely eat it again. After mixing the filling, I let the flavors meld a bit while I heated the baguette in the oven to crisp the outside and warm the inside. A different twist to the usual tuna/mayo/celery sandwich for lunch.

I served these on fresh rolls with zucchini slices instead of lettuce. Scrumptious.

Excellent tuna salad. I added 1/4 cup small diced sundried tomatos and used black olives from a can instead, came out great.

the celery i got yesterday was bendy and squishy today (grr!) so skipped that, and served over mixed greens. it was a huge hit and got great reviews from all concerned. will enter the regular lunch rotation.

I just made this and it was delicious! Nice blend of ingredients. Definitely will be making again and again.

I had to leave out the onion and celery for my picky eaters, and had limes but no lemons around. Still, this was truly wonderful. I agree with the others that tuna packed in oil is a must, and next time, I definitely need to try this on olive bread. This would probably be really good as a melt with cheddar too. Mmmm!

Quick, simple, delicious. Would definately make it again.

I have made it twice already, and people consistenly say it is the best tuna salad they ever have tasted. Both times I added my own twist: chopped apple, and fresh parsley. The blend of flavors is fabulos! I served the salad in a bowl garnished with apple wedges. After the bread was gone, my guests ate the salad by itself.

One of the best tuna salad recipes I've ever tasted! The flavors blended perfectly together. I followed the recipe almost exactly. For a low-fat alternative, I used 1/8 cup mayonnaise mixed with 1/8 cup nonfat yogurt and it came out deliciously.

Great. I used fresh tuna that I poached and skipped the bread altogether. Just piled a big scoop onto some mixed greens. Yum.

Yum! I didn't have the red peppers or the celery and it still turned out great, much better than my normal tuna salad. I added a fair amount of salt, course ground black pepper and some cornichons because I had them. I served the sandwiches open-faced with sliced grape tomatoes on top. This was really good.

Actually realized I had no olives after already mixing the other ingredients, but this was still so yummy! It is a nice change from my old mayo and pickle tuna salad. Very quick and easy, makes a nice light lunch.

A great new way to make tuna salad. The flavors are terrific. I added capers. Definitely make overnight if ya can. The flavors set & it's great. Any fresh bread & a slice of tomato makes a great presentation. Best of all, it's fast & EASY!!

Very tastey! A nice change from the typical tuna salad sando. I'll definately make it again, skip the olive oil on the bread and add tomato to the sandwich.

Very good. Different from typical tuna salad. I used tuna in water, and you must drain really well, or it's soggy. My wife added apple for a twist.

I added capers too. It was easy and delicious. Felt like I was eating a gourmet cafe sandwich at home!

I make tuna salad sandwiches once a week. This is the recipe I will use from now on (really, really good), although I made a few changes. I used tuna in water and fresh chopped red pepper. I baked the rolls in the toaster oven @ 400 degrees for approx. 10 minutes before I cut them open to make the sandwiches.

Try making this with olive bread, other variation arugula for lettuce. These would be good made the day before, they soften up a bit and I thought that improved them. Don't cut baguette in 3 pieces, it makes the sandwich too big. I wrapped them in sandwich wax paper sheets because they tend to juice a lot. Don't skip the oil and salt & pepper on bread it makes a difference.

My favorite tuna sandwich ever. I've given this recipe to everyone I know and they all love it. Try it one time just as it's written, even though you may be tempted to add other ingredients. It's so refreshing and fun, and tuna in olive oil is completely different in flavor than that in water...wow! I do suggest using a bread that's not too chewy or else all the tuna mushes out the sides =)

I thought this recipe was a great twist on the tune sandwich. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe didn't impress me as greatly different from those one would find in most cookbooks. Since I have some left over, I plan to add some other ingedients, like horseradish, tabasco, etc.

I add a couple good shakes of Tabasco and lots of horeseradish, drained, to make it really pop. My fave.

I have never been a fan of tuna salad but this was great. I made the sandwiches with a lovely hearty rye with pupkin seeds from the When Pigs Fly Bakery that I toasted. Also I used 1 can of lite tuna in oil and one can of solid white tuna in water. This would be equally delish topping a big garden salad.

Very good! I made the tuna salad a day ahead of time for our Fourth of July picnic. I put the sandwiches together using small club rolls instead of a baguette, which worked fine. Sandwiches are even better the next day. Tuna and olives are a great combo.

I used tuna in water (rather than oil) and put in rye bread (both recommended), but this was an easy and tasty lunch treat.
