I made these with chives and a pinch of cayenne instead of dill. I also used a small scoop so the would be slightly larger and uniform. After they cooled, I split them and stuffed them with a chicken salad made of breast meat, celery, quartered green grapes, toasted almond slivers, sour cream and mayo. What a hit at the party!

I recommend using a harder cheese on the top (like parmesan). They tend to poof up more with a harder cheese vs. with the cheddar. The cheddar is a little heavier and tends to weigh them down. Also tried with goat cheese and finely chopped basil and enjoyed that as well.

I made these and a similar recipe by Ina Garten that called for whole milk instead of water. I found this version to be lighter, puffier, and tastier. The milk version was too dense and slightly burned on the bottom from the milk solids. Very tasty. Try with gouda too for a nice smokey flavor.

These are like small popovers - light and eggy. I did not have any dill on hand or cheddar cheese so I substituted chives and freshly grated Locatelli romano. Delicious and different.

I liked these and think that I may do other cheeses and herbs to improve upon it. After reading reviews, I added about 1/2 tsp kosher salt, which I was glad to have done. These were cute and a nice appetizer. The dough was really fun to make--I've never made a dough like this and it was interesting to watch it change as ingredients were added. I used a ziploc sandwich bag for piping, which worked fine.

These were WONDERFUL! Nice and light and airy and cheesy! I would serve these as a bisquit and not as an appetizer which is what they came up as. Lovely!

I have made this several times. Freeze very well.

Sure they're cute and have a nice fun size for popping in your mouth, but they were so blah... dry and flavourless... ew.. I think they would need a lot of something for me to ever make this again, though what I'm not sure...

This requires a really good cheese. I served it with a main dish salad and it was a good accompaniment.

I took the advice of other users and modified the recipe slightly. I removed the dill and added three finely chopped jalapenos. I removed most of the seeds to reduce the heat but still wanted that zing. The combination of jalapenos and cheddar in a puff was a hit! The jalapenos made the batter a little watery so next time I will add a little more flour to compensate.

very disappointing; I added 8 oz sharpest cheddar and almost all of the fresh dill & 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper...all it did was keep my mouth busy. I would try again and perhaps put a piece of ham in the puff before baking.

Disappointing! This recipe was easy to make and the individual puffs were pretty but the taste was BLAND! I eventually added Tabasco and cayenne but neither helped sufficiently to make this the tasty recipe I had hoped for.

It was easy to make and the texture was good, but I found this very bland. Perhaps adding more salt, herbs & cheese as other reviewers have done would help.

These are absolutely fantastic! Had them at a family gathering on Sunday and made them for guests on Wednesday! Very easy to make and turn out beautifully...crispy on the outside and light and airy in the middle. I also added some chopped fresh chives from the garden. Used a plastic bag with corner cut off instead of pastry bag...worked well. More recently, tried using 1 tbsp chopped thai chili pepper and 1 tbsp chopped chives, instead of dill, was EXCELLENT!

These were very simple to make, and you really don't need a pastry bag, but I found them very eggy and a little bland. I use more fresh dill and cheddar than called for, but by the second batch sprinkled a little garlic salt on top. I also added some cheese to the top mid-way through cooking which helps. Still not the greatest...

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it three times so far and I've recieved rave reviews. I'm not an excellent cook but I do try and this is a recipe meant to impress. I highly recommend that you try this recipe! You won't regret it!

Didn't love this recipe. They cool quickly and I found them a bit dry and bland. I may make a sauce for them to be dipped in or maybe I'll serve them beside my cheese platter - to be served at a shower. I'll reply further once I get the guests responses.

Made these for a business dinner for VP of the company. Very hard to impress! But they were a great hit with just a few changes. To keep down the VP's high cholesterol (she's a health nut), we substituted egg beaters for eggs, and margarine for butter. Cheddar-flavoured tofu filled in beautifully for the cheese. Dill can be really hard to find in Sillikers at this time of year, so we substituted bok choy, which is grown organically near by, and added a nice Asian flair. Normally a teetotaller, the VP was so taken by the presentation in the magazine that she drank an entire pitcher of the herbal white sangria all on her own! So, I guess this is a rave review for both recipes. We used port instead of white wine, but it still turned out great.

Want to try this recipe, but more so, the drink that is in the picture. Looks very refreshing. (and pretty with the little flowers.) If anyone has any idea what it is (possibly the editor), please e-mail me or post a message on this page. Thank you kindly.

Very good. Made these for a dinner party the following day. I highly recommend making them in advance; although making the "dough" is a relatively simple process, I found it rather time-consuming to pipe them through the pastry bag. I used all five eggs, commercial sharp cheddar, and added a little more dill than called for. I expected them to spread and puff more than they did; next time I will pipe them a little larger than the suggested one inch. Not heart-healthy but very good.

I made these yesterday. Everybody loved them. The only thing I was unsure about was after adding the flour and stirring, I used a non-stick pan so it immediately pulled away from the sides. I wasn't sure if I should keep it on the heat for 2 minutes or not. I sort of compromised and kept it on about a minute. I would definitely make these again. Inexpensive and makes a lot.
