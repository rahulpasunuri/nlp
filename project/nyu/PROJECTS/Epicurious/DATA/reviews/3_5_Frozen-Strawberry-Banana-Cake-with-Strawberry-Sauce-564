I prepared this recipe for 10 dinner guests. All of them raved! I thought this recipe was just ok. This cake is very easy to prepare. I used vanilla flavored frozen yogurt instead of banana strawberry frozen yogurt. I omitted the sliced bananas and served the cake with the sauce described in the recipe and chopped strawberries. The guests were talking about the cake two days later!

There is not enough room here to tell you how wonderful this is, although I did not make exactly as instructed, I used vanilla Ice Cream in place of the frozen yogurt..and on top I piped rosettes of whipped cream after it was frozen,then returned to the freezer until it was sliced,I omitted the sliced berries on top and did not add the banana...feeds a large crowd

Being a novice cook, this cake was very easy to make, and looked very "gourmet" when served. I served it sliced, with sauce drizzled on top, then sprinkled a few banana slices on each piece. Couldn't find the exact yogurt, so substituted dark cherry yogurt instead and came out great!

Could not find the exact ingredients and was forced to substitute lemon sorbet and strawberry frozen yogurt. 12 ounces pound cake is not enough; I would buy a bigger one next time. We did not use any banana but this presented well with the top covered with stemmed, whole strawberries.
