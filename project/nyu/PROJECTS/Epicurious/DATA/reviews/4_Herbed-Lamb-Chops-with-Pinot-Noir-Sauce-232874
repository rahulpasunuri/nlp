Excellent Lamb Chop recipe! My husband who said he hated lamb agreed that this receipe is a keeper and changed his mind on lamb! The lamb was moist and tender utilizing the recipes instruction. The sauce is worth the work! I tried this recipe for a second time and used port wine which is even better! If you want to look like and taste like a Top Cheif this recipe is the one!

This is my goto for lamb...and I just do the herbed lamb part most of the time. Sometimes I add some shallots and roast those and then deglaze the pan with some red wine and beef broth, boil down and it's a lot less time. Sometimes just the lamb and it's just delicious with sauteed mushrooms on the side and a starch. Great recipe, don't hesitate.

Spectacular. Substited 1c beef broth boiled down to scant 1/4 c for lamb, because I had to! Followed rest of recipe which I cut down by 1/3 because I only had 4 lovely Elysian Fields chops. Cooked sauce to almost a glaze, strained and swirled in 2T butter to soften. 3 Michelin stars. Grilled herbed chops.

This was a lovely Easter dinner for my family and guests. Wonderful flavor and not difficult at all, especially to put in the oven after getting home from church (as opposed to trying to figure out the timing of a roast!). I will say that the sauce is time consuming and must be made the day ahead if time is tight. I took the advise of others here and cut the recipe for the sauce by a 1/3, i.e. using 2 lbs of meat, 2/3 wine, etc. And it was just right. Fabulous flavor! And the herbs on this are fantastic. I skipped the browning step and popped them in the oven (after bringing them to room temp) and they were perfect. Can't imagine why you'd disrupt all those good herbs to brown these? I paired it with some other BA recipes, one for mashed potatoes with spinach and chives, the other for asparagus with sauce maltaise. My guests were thrilled.

Wish there was a fifth fork! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! My husband, son and i just finished the left overs and we were licking the plates. The lamb was delicious and the sauce divine. Easily made sauce and prepped the lamb racks day before and the rest was easy - everyone was very impressed. I can't wait to make this again.

made this with a very diminuitive rack of icelandic lamb (8 chops, just under 1# of meat) and it was incredible. I let the rack marinate for 5-6 hours, though next time I'll let it go a whole day. For the sauce, I used a whole bottle of pinot, 2.5 cups of low-sodium chicken stock, 1# of lamb bones/riblets, halved the veg, and since I realized at the last minute that I was out of herbes de Provence (rats), I put in fennel, lavender, and tarragon. I wound up simmering it down for about 2 hours, winding up with a cup of beautiful, rich sauce. Even my husband, an avowed hater of lamb, asked for more. This dish is officially a winner! Served with simple roasted garlic mashed potatoes and carrots roasted with rosemary.

Quite disappointing for the amount of time that is involved. The Pinot Noir sauce hardly adds any flavor, it almost detracts from it. There are much better lamb recipes out there and it seems that with lamb "less is more".

Fantastic all the way around! I used closer to 2 lb. meat to save money, but still had a rich and flavorful sauce. Note, however - I found the sauce makes lots - as in more than what is needed for 3 racks of lamb. If you want leftovers, make the full sauce recipe, otherwise you could probably reduce by about 1/4. Highly recommend prepping the racks of lamb a day ahead!

Fantastic recipe, classic herbed rack of lamb! Highly recommend 100% grass-fed or milk-fed lamb, which you can get at Farmer's Markets. Sauce is wonderfully rich and flavorful, just make sure you're attentive at the end when thickening! Cook meat to rare, let the succulence of the meat speak for itself!

I also searched for lamb chops, found this, and didn't find it to be a problem at all. I added the paste to the chops, seared them to get a good crust, and finished in the oven. I reduced the sauce MUCH longer than called for and it was great. There was a lot of sauce left over so the next day I sauted shrooms and added a bit of sauce and served over pork chops, great again.

BIG PROBLEM - I asked for a lamb chop recipe and this calls for rack. How can that be? As a good cook I can adjust for that but it seems very sloppy to me. Make it again? maybe with a rack!

I didn't make the sauce, just didn't allow enough time. But.. After cooking the chops in the pan, i took them out, added red onions, and the leftover marinade. after that cooked i added about 1 1/2 cups of red wine until that reduced. Lowered the heat Then added about 2 tbls of butter and cooked for about 5 more min on low. The Lamb was awesome, chops from costco, and so was the sauce. also made garlic mashed potatoes with some sheep milk cheese added to it.

it was really tasty served as an appetizer at a wine party. I added some chopped garlic to the herb mixture and marinated for an hour at to bring the meat to room temp, then sliced into individual ribs and grilled for a couple minutes on each side and reheated at party in microwave for 1 minute, put on a tray and drizzled the sauce over the top (made the sauce with some cab I had on hand and it was really yummy)

This recipe made great lamb chops. A classic recipe with fresh herbs and simple preparation. I marinated the chops for a day, then seared on top of the stove and baked as indicated. Added garlic to the herb mix. Made the sauce, but it was unnecessary. A great crowd pleaser!

I used one rack of lamb and halved the sauce recipe - and boy am I glad I did, it made a ton. The sauce was delicious even though the wine we chose turned out to be undrinkable. I couldn't find any lamb stew meat or riblets. I added about two teaspoons of veal demi-glace with the broth instead. The lamb was perfect, the sauce was amazing and I would absolutely make this again!

Fantastic! I upped the recipe by 50% to serve 12 at a family gathering. The results were excellent will raves from all. Next time I will make the sauce and the herb rub the day before to cut down on the kitchen time the day of the meal.

I made this for Mother's Day and found it to be a scrumptous main dish. The lamb is very good on it's own with out the sauce (I prepared it the night before so the herbs really seasoned the meat) I should have done the sauce the night before also but ran out of time. I used 3 cups of low salt beef broth in lieu of the chicken broth and couldn't find lamb stew meat and thought it turned out well...a bit tart... perhaps I should have used more broth. I boiled it down for about an hour and did not strain it. Served it w. corn pudding and sauteed squash/zucchini - was a def. crowd pleaser.

I kind of hacked this recipe, but it was fabulous. The butcher didn't have lamb bones. So I used a low sodium beef broth: Sauteed thyme & bay leaf and shallots in EVOO. Then added 1 can of stock and reduced to half. Added about two cups Pinot Noir and reduced to 1/3. Strained YUMMY - no additional fat required. Marinated petit lamb chops in EVOO, tons of garlic, fresh rosemary and parsley, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper overnight. Seared in pan on stove then finished in 425 oven as others suggested. Served this with spring root vegetable puree and roasted garlic red potatoes. Fabulous! Sorry I couldn't follow the directions exactly, but they were inspirational based on what was available. A keeper! My boyfriend loved this and he didn't think he like lamb!

Wish there were a 5-fork rating available for this one! I made the entire dinner this was part of and it was out of this world! (Did substituted the menu appetizer based on bad reviews for the crab-meat parmesean canapes also ont his site). The sauce here is worth the work - I used lamb necks because that's what the butcher had available. Very impressive main course and perfect paired with a rich pinot noir.

Wonderful and easy. The sauce is to die for. Used a combination of veal, lamb and venison for the sauce and made it the day before. Herbed the racks also the night before and browned them the afternoon of the dinner. Roasted all racks to med-rare, but did not let them rest, but for a few minutes. All guest loved the lamb and used extra bread to wipe up any remaining sauce on their plate.

An unqualified hit. Made it for six people using two racks of lamb - just the right amount. Made the sauce the night before with lamb shanks cut into short pieces so got two wonderful dinners out of this recipe. Served the rack of lamb with minted sugar snap peas and potatoes lyonnaise. YUM!

The sauce is basically a quick brown stock. Complex and worth the extra effort. We served it w/ sauteed mixed wild mushrooms (chanterelles, oyster, and shitake). Loved it. A great wine-friendly dish and a great party dish in the sense that almost everything can be done ahead of time EXCEPT the final roasting, which we did while we were having the first course. No time lost.

Not a quick prep but a nice result. We didn't think the sauce had much flavor for all the work and ingredients. The lamb was wonderfully flavored and perfectly medium rare. I made the salad and potato gratin from this menu for a great weekend dinner at home. Company quality.

I made this for my best friend's birthday dinner. It was a fabulous meal. I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a recipe that looks far more complicated than it actually is. I served it to some "foodie" friends of mine from California and they raved about it. Also, the recipe for the sauce, with a couple of substitutions (for the type of meat bones used) can be used with venison, buffalo, ostrich, or beef!

I'm just preparing to make this a second time. There is nothing I would change

I don't even like lamb and I LOVED this. So fresh. Sooooooo easy to prepare! DELISH!!!! A real treat on a rainy drizzly fall evening! Will definitely make again. Did not have all fresh herbs so I mixed dried with fresh and it was delish. Served over garlic/chive mashed potatoes to rave reviews!

My guests were licking their fingers and asking for more of this scrumptious recipe. Timely yes, but oh so very worthwhile.
