Well I plan to try this recipe. The 4 forks are for this exceptional Sweet Potato. The flesh is white and is more fluffy than an orange Sweet Potato. I'll never forget the first time I bought them, I did not realize that they were white inside --- so when we opened them up and both exclaimed OOOOOOOO! Momentary disappointment melted into joy after just one bite! Sweeter, drier/fluffier Wonderful!

I actually saw the mentioned episode of Hanamaru Market while waiting in a doctors office. Immediately upon returning home I tried this recipe, finding it as flavorful and delicious to others I've tried around Japan without the oily finish. This dish is even better served along side a dish of vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!
