Made it with 3 lb Amish cut up chicken cooked in cast iron skillet. Delicious but not enough juices for 10 ounces of bread. Would make a white wine sauce next time?

I also always brine (1-3 days) the chicken, and save my fancy Oklahoma pastured "Cou Nu" chickens for roasting. Last time i made it there was no arugula in the garden, so i added chopped collard greens to the stock and vinegar as i brought them to a boil. Not as nutty/bitter as arugula (and no longer a salad, really), but delicious collards. I'm sure it would be equally good with mustard or turnip greens.

but one of the keys according to the Zuni recipe is to wash, salt & pepper the chicken and let it rest in a loosely covered pyrex dish in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 days. I don't think this step should be skipped.

This is very close to the original. I subbed spinach and dried cranberries once because we made this on a whim and weren't stocked, and I kind of liked it better. Terrific and very festive!

I have had this dish at Zuni numerous times. It is truly a classic. Now that I don't live in SF any more, I make it at home weekly-- honestly. I use a smaller, young chicken (3 lbs., kosher, farm-raised) and cook it a la Thomas Keller's recipe on this site (My Favorite Simple Roast Chicken) in a convection oven. The chicken cooks FAST and gets super crispy. Then I follow directions above for the "salad". It turns out perfect every time.

To this recipe I added a generous addition of fresh herbs of tyme, oregano and basil under the skin of the chicken before baking. The herbs permeated the meat of the chicken and added a very flavorful taste to the chicken.

I've made this several times -- for a bridal shower, xmas brunch, and it always works fabulously. I'm serving it tonight for company (roasted the chicken yesterday) for a cool summer meal. For a nice variety, you can sub apple cider vinegar and apples for the white wine vinegar and raisins. Yum.

A good dish. I made it for a potluck brunch and everyone seemed to enjoy it. A few changes due to the buffet nature of the meal.... I pulled the chicked off the bone and tossed it along with the bread and arugula. Per a previous reviewers suggestion, I made more dressing, and it could have used even more ( Maybe 2x's more. Finished the whole thing with a topping of toasted pine nuts and ultra sweet cherry tomatoes. The result looked as good as it tasted. I will make this again soon. I think I would even add some chopped apples to the salad to add a different textural crunch.

I thought it was teriffic. I also made it again with a variation I put chopped grilled chicken into salad very tasty and quick.

Quick recipe for making two dishes at once. The salad is tasty and unusual. Having read another review, we added 1/2 c extra of chicken broth in the pan before reducing to ensure enough moisture for the bread. It didn't hide the light taste of vinegar.

You really can't beat a roasted chicken and this recipe is easy and soooo good!! I also deleted the fruit (because I didn't have it on hand)and substituted a bag of spring mix baby greens for the arugula. Can't wait to make it again.....

Excellent dish! I omitted the currants. Be careful because the bread will soak up most of the sauce. I also suggest using a free range chicken.
