Based on other comments, I made this, with a few changes, for a romantic Christmas eve dinner for 2. First, I would definitely recommend using at least a proportion of gourmet mushrooms. I only used 20%, but the flavor difference is huge. Next, the better half was concerned about the quantity of butter, so I made the finishing sauce with "cooking cream" (a Philadelphia cream cheese based product with less fat than butter), which thickens up nicely. Finally, to make it a main course, I served it over thin egg noodles, with steamed asparagus and a side salad. Quite delicious and the extra bulk overcame any saltiness issues. Had the meal with a premium wooded Chardonnay from Margaret River (where else?) which matched beautifully. Will definitely be making this again.

Sorry I didn't have any fancy mushrooms or parsley but it turned out pretty good. I didn't use this as a first course but had it with rice and asparagus. 3 1/2 stars

well, i was sceptical because of some of the reviews but i had most of the ingredients on hand (used plain, old mushrooms) so.... it was wonderful!!!! I cut back a little on the butte rand used my plain mushrooms but my husband and i both loved the dish - will be revisiting this quite often!! fabulous!!

I served this over mixed greens as a luncheon salad for two. It was delicious. I used less butter than called for in the finishing step and it turned out just fine. I might add a litle more curry next time. I used shitakes, oysters and crimini mushrooms. It made an elegant lunch and certainly company worthy.

We really enjoyed this dish, with a few changes. I also used only 2t of soy (low salt), and added: 1/4c white wine, 1t Minor's Chicken Soup Base (added to the H2O) these bases are much better quality than bouillon!!!, 1/2lb of fresh spinich "wilted" (in saute process). This ensures enough sauce to serve over angel hair pasta!!!! It was great!

This was quick and easy but much too salty for my taste, even though I used unsalted butter and reduced sodium soy sauce. I greatly prefer the "Pan Seared Tuna with Ginger-Shitake Cream Sauce" on this site.

Great recipe. Used the lime juice instead of lemon. The sauce was tasty,pefect. Mushrooms were pricy so used 3/4 shittake's and then regular fresh mushrooms.Raves.I did the mushroomsa earlier in the day and nuked them after scallops and sauce were done. Rave reviews. Try this one!

Super-delicious!! I used half a package of Trader Joe's frozen wild mushroom medley; sauteed in 1 T butter with minced garlic, S & P. Then I took others' suggestions and used lime instead of lemon. I will DEFINITELY make it again!!

Browned 12 uncooked shrimp with scallops. Added 3 oz. cream cheese to thicken sauce. Served over linguini with mandarin/romaine/almond salad. My husband says I can make it again.

Out of this world! Only change I made to the recipe: I used brown crimini mushrooms instead of wild, and they were just great!

Loved this recipe, as did my wife. Only changes I made were to use bacon fat in lieu of olive oil, added some chopped shallots with the oysters, and deglazed with dry white wine in lieu of the water. Delicious, and easy/quick to make.

This is simple and really great. The other reviewers were right on. I'll definitely make this again. Follow the recipe and you can't miss. I squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the scallops immediately prior to serving. I served with linguine tossed with fresh tomatoes and herbs.

Absolutely YUMMY! My husband and I have been following the Aitkens diet and this was a real treat to serve over a bed of greens. Next time I make it though I will reduce the soy sauce in half. Seemed a little salty for our taste.

I used bay scallops and was happy with the result. I would use less water with the bay scallops, as they threw off much liquid.

How simple and delicious! My husband isn't a big fan of scallops but he really liked this dish.

Fantastic ! Have made this recipe at least 5 times - all to rave reviews ! I use a mix of shiitake and "baby-bella" mushrooms.

Rating: 1
I've made lots of recipes from this site, and usually agree with the reviewers. Not in this case. I actually thought it was kind of gross. If you do decide to make this, make sure you sear the mushrooms in small batches so they'll sautee rather than boil in their own juices.

Have made this recipe exactly as written twice now. Have received rave reviews each time - would not change a thing. Served with a side of wild rice and some roasted asparagus - SUPER!!

Yuck! I followed the suggestions from one of the reviewers to mix it with pasta and it came out awful. Probably would be best on its own or with a side of rice to combine with its asian flavours.

I just made this for dinner tonight and let me say the other reviewers have it right on....this is delicious. Very simple and very tasty. I prefer my food a bit spicy so I used hot curry. Served with a side of sauteed spinach. I am also in agreement that it tastes fine with 1/2 the butter.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I was surprised at how few ingredients could be combined to produce a flavor that would turn my head. The only thing I would change is to add a thickening agent to the sauce. Just a little bit of arrowroot would do. I think 1/2 t. is all you need. Let me know.

Made this into a main course for a quick weekday dinner...used shiitake and chanterelles, about a pound of scallops, and served over tagliatelle. I mixed the cooked mushrooms with the drained pasta at the end, topped with the scallops, and then added the sauce over the top. You can significantly reduce the butter without any ill effects - keep about 1/2 cup of the pasta water on hand to add back to the pasta mushroom mix if it seems too tight. Added a simple arugula salad on the side to round out the meal - you can make a quick dressing with good olive oil and the leftover lemon juice to pick up on the flavors in the soy/lemon mixture. Nice, will make again.

As a first course, I served this over slightly wilted spinach. Beautiful presentation and delicious. I agree with previous reviewers -- you can cut the butter by at least half and add some garlic or chopped shallots to the mushrooms.

My husband made this while I was in class last night, then reheated it for me in the microwave. Fabulous! I could not believe the flavor combination. He used less butter than the recipe calls for, and only portobella since that is what we had. Terrific job! I asked him for it again tonight! He made it over brown rice, which gave it a nice flavor/texture. A true winner!

Wow! Followed advice and used less butter and lime instead of lemon. Soaked dried fancy mushrooms in white wine and added then fresh white mushrooms. Used a Tamari Ginger sauce instead of plain soy and threw in some candied ginger. Fast, clean dish that I will now use wow family and friends.

I must politely disagree with "Sacramento." This was one of the most delicious meals I've made in a long time. I added a bit of minced garlic while saute'ing the mushrooms, and it was great. Serving over rice would be a nice complement.

I HATE scallops! The only reason I made this recipe was because, first --everyone raved about it and majority of the people rated this recipe 4-forks. Secondly, my boyfriend likes scallops and this dish was one of the five-course meals I've made for his birthday dinner. The only substitution I would make next time is throwing in white mushrooms instead of shitake and oyster. And use shrimps instead of scallops.

Loved this recipe! I made it with ingredients on hand so the quantities might have been off, but we had it for a main course and it was great. Used about 1/2 lb. regular mushrooms and 1 lb. scallops. I threw in a scallion with the scallops which I cut in halves, used less margarine than called for and used ginger instead of curry as suggested. Using the whole sauce recipe was fine and would be good over rice, maybe even thickened a little next time, but the flavor was delicious. Definitely a keeper!

This dish was easy and elegant. My husband and I both agreed that the dish could be made without the scallops and served as either a vegetarian entree or vegetable side dish. A wide variety of mushrooms adds a lot of interest to this dish.

I am a newlywed and came by your site the other day. I prepared this last night for my husband and he just kept raving about it with every bite. It was hard to believe that I prepared something so incredibly delicous. Will definetly make this again!! Thanks for making me look so good!

THIS was INCREDIBLE! We loved it so much we doubled the recipe and served it over rice! Incidentally, if you don't have options for the more exotic mushrooms try you standard mushrooms and it's just as good!!!

Delicious! I used white mushrooms instead of wild and half the butter and it was still great. Also I used ginger instead of curry powder due to preference. I served it over white rice and it was a big hit! I'll definitely make this again.

We were looking for something special, and decided to combine the vegetables from a previous scallop recipe, confetti veggies, and we were extremely pleased with the combination. Next time we would add ginger to the veggies, and do the beans a little longer. We decided to reduce on the amount of butter by about one half. This did not detract from the recipe in our opinion. Our scallops were LARGE and very FRESH, the mushrooms delicious, and everything just blended together into a very enjoyable meal. This is most definitely a "Company" meal for the future.

WOW!!! This is a fantastic scallop recipe! It is EXTREMELY easy and exceptionally tasty. We have made it 3 times. Wonderful presentation! We tried it with lemon but now subsitute lime in place of lemon and use only 3 tsp. LOW SALT soy sauce. We have made it with both wild and white (regular) mushroom and found the regular mushrooms to be just as flavorful (considering the sauce). Definately use only 1/2 the butter called for in the sauce. Have we convinced you? TRY IT!!!!!

We enjoyed this recipe, even made with scallop medallions. Would cut down on the salt next time, but that could be because I used salted margarine instead of unsalted butter. Easy to make.

Rating: 4
This was an incredibly good recipe. It was not that difficult to make, and it doesn't leave all that much cleaning afterwards. I would recommend it as a main course for two, doubled and so on for more people. In addition, I would recommend a side of horseradish or garlic mashed potatoes to go with it when served as a main course.

Absolutely delicious! I am not a scallop or mushroom fan, but I found this dish to be outstanding. We made a few substitutions- used regular white mushrooms since the supermarket didn't carry the kind called for, and we cut the butter by probably 50% and it was great! My father is a very picky eater, and he ate not only his portion but another guests' also. Would definately make again.

This is "Company Quality", our family's highest rating! I cut down on the amount of butter by at least half and it was still fantastic ! It couldn't be easier. Would serve this to our most discriminating guest and would be amazed if it wasn't appreciated.
