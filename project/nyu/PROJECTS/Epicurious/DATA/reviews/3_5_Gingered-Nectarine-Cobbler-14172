I have been making this delicious recipe for several years, first to finish up some ripe nectarines. I follow the recipe completely, but triple to make a nice quantity. It is always a crowd please; never boring! The ginger is the key. Great with vanilla ice cream.

Brilliant way to use up a few nectarines I had lying around that were a bit past their best! I wouldn't have thought of adding ginger myself, but it was delicious! It was a hit with my kids too, despite the fact that they're not keen on nectarines uncooked. I made a very slightly different topping, more like a traditional British crumble, and added oats to it as well, but I still added the cinnamon (plus a pinch of dry ginger as well). I served mine with custard.

I thought this was good, but not great. There is a peach cobbler recipe on this site and nectarine & blackberry cobbler recipe that I think are better.

One of my all-time favorite cobbler recipes for ripe, summertime nectarines. I've made this recipe several times since it first appeared in 1997, and have always received rave reviews. The only changes I'd make are to (1) double the topping recipe, and (2) serve with vanilla ice cream or creme anglaise. Yum!

I have made this recipe 2x already. I found that adding a little of the crystallized ginger to the short bread topping added a little extra flavor and zing. I also omitted the corn starch. An easy and delicious dessert.

Easy and delicious. Always gets raves. Best with a side of vanilla ice cream.

Quick and easy to make, but boring. I would add blueberries next time, and definitely double or triple the amount of cinnamon-sugar topping.

It was easy to make. I think I would make more topping next time.
