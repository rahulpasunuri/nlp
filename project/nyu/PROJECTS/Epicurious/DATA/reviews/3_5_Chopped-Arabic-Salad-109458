Very good and easy to make for a quick side dish to accompany grilled lamb or spicy meat. Didn't have puslane but would like to make it next time with it.

This is a great light side dish for a bbq. It was very watery the next day though, I recommend eating it the day it's made.

also known as fattouch salad in some middle eastern restaurants, this salad tastes even better the next day. also, try using a dill yogurt with this...it's pretty amazing!

This is a great recipe. I added 2 tbsp of organic yogurt to make the dressing creamy and i also threw in some diced kalamata olives. i love the taste of the fresh mint it really makes this salad special.

This is a great dish! I have made it several times and get rave reviews each time. I like to add the EVOO to taste and I add the salt at the end so the salad is less soupy when served.

I find this to be one of the most refreshing salads in the world. You don't have to limit yourself to just tomatoes, onions, and cukes. Any vegetable that can hold its crispness will work. I had a daikon radish, and since radish was always abundant in my grandmother's arabic salads, I felt like I should add it out of nostalgia. I would have loved to have added sumac, but I didn't have time to really look for it, although I am sure my market carries it. As I said, carrots (diced), radish, green bell pepper, and toasted pita can all be added-- just use what you have on hand, really.

A definite favorite of mine. An excellent addition to this salad is a spice called Sumac(for added tartness), it can easily be found in middle eastern markets, the olive oil has to be good and some toasted pita bread cut into small pieces and sprinkled on top, totally YUMMY?

This brings back memories of my childhood in Toledo,Oh. On a hot muggy summer day this was heaven to eat as It just cooled you off
