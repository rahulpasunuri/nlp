This is a nice crust, and easier than a yeasted pizza crust by far. I liked the sour cream topping as well, although I didn't really follow the recipe beyond that. The one thing to note about the spelt crust is that it has a tendency to be soggy, so the pizza stone is key.

Linseed oil is flaxseed oil. I think it might be a Britishism?

I wondered about the linseed oil, too, but I think, if I'm not mistaken, that rapeseed oil is the cooking linseed oil. I'm not positive.

Linseed oil? Really? It's used in oil paint and furniture finishing. Are you thinking flaxseed oil?
