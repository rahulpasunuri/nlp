Ok, I did not have cornmeal so the pancakes were made with flour only. That wasn't anything to write home about but the syrup was amazing.

Okay - maybe I messed up. I substituted yogurt for the cream cheese to lower the fat content - and they were fine - but nothing special. I made the syrup the night before and reheated in the microwave - so it was quite good. Next time I want the flavor of cornbread - I'd rather just make cornbread. Next time I want really special pancakes - I'll make my Pumpkin Pancakes.

I used 1/2 ricotta cheese and 1/2 cream cheese in mine and they came ou incredibly light. These also do well as a savory pancake, served with huevos rancheros (minus the tortillas).

Excellent easy elegance - I used Goya's rougher cut cornmeal rather than a fine cornmeal and let the batter sit for a good five min before making the pancakes (nice cornmeal texture/taste). I also added flour-dusted dry cranberries to the batter (1/2 c or so) and just used plain maple syrup -- definitely a keeper ONE QUESTION, THOUGH: does anyone know if one could one substitute yogurt, fat free sour cream or fat free cream cheese for the cream cheese?

I had people tell me they really liked it, but I wasn't to fond of the pancakes themselves. I really liked the idea of adding fruit to the syrup so that I will definately do again. As for the pancakes I would just make a traditional recipe and use the syrup on them.

I doubt I'll make these again. The pancakes themselves were nothing special, and we didn't particularly care for the syrup. These weren't hard to make, but I remain on the prowl for a great pancake recipe, something special for weekends.

This one turned out excellent, and will be added to my stable of reliable pancake recipes. The batter is a bit watery initially, but fluffs up nicely after it sits for a few minutes. Not as much cornmeal presence as some other recipes, but enough to give it some of that distinctive gritty texture and flavor. Didn't try the syrup recipe, as I'm a big fan of straight maple syrup.

Excellent! The best pancakes I've ever had! Did not try the syrup but these are very good with regular mapple syrup.

The best pancakes I have ever had and the maple syrup fruit mixture was wonderful. I made this recipe for a gathering of 27 people without a hitch.

A great alternative to the standard white flour and eggs pancakes. All my friends loved it.

Definately everyone's favorite for breakfast!! They are extremely delicious and my secret recipe for when having guests stay over. Can also be made for dessert! Batter can be made the night before, also, and I found that they taste just as good!
