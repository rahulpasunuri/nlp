LOVE this salad. The dressing is amazing. I did just as instructed and wouldn't change a thing. It got rave reviews by my guests too.

I served this as a side dish for Easter with this site's Crown Pork Roast with Apple Stuffing...so I omitted the greens. Not a papaya fan, so I just chopped up some more apricots. I served it al dente, and wound up with a lot left over, because I had LOTS of other dishes. Next day, I added some soy sauce and hot pepper flakes to the dressing, marinaded some chicken in it, and then made a stir fry with the leftover beans. Even better than the original recipe!

Green beans & apricots meld well together, and the papaya garnish brightened the platter (we didn't serve individually). Omitted the pistacios. Salad greens don't hold up that well to the weight of the beans, so definitely assemble right before serving.

Absolutely wonderful flavors! Used only apricot nectar (no pinneapple) Added leftover smoked duck breast. Delicious!!

Sorry Seattle, this oil-free dressing is certainly low-fat, but it's most definitely not low-cal.

delicious low cal vinaigrette.

I substituted mango for papaya, and instead of apricot pineapple nectar, I just pureed a can of apricots (with juice).

Absolutely delicious! I LOVE this salad. Added the garlic and sesame oil per user suggestions, and used arugula for the greens. I think the salad benefits from dicing the papaya--the slices on top keeps the flavors separate, and it's really all the flavors together that make it so nice. A definite keeper.

Very impressive and tasty salad. I served this salad, along with the Seared Salmon on Spinach and Orzo Pilaf with Green Onions and Parmesan (both are Bon Appetit recipes as well) to our supper club. The papaya seeds have a peppery taste, so I added a tablespoon of seeds to dressing when I processed it in the blender.

This salad was served at a dinner party I attended, so I can only comment on the taste (not the preparation). It was delicious. The green beans were crisp, and the combination of flavors was impressive. Thanks!

Wonderful, sophisticated, and comes together in no time if you boil your beans ahead of time. Sliced the beans in half crosswise for easier eating. Used mango instead of papaya, because that's what I already had (plus my family doesn't care for papaya). Light, elegant and delicious. Will be making this again!

This is a nice, light summer salad. I made it without the leafy greens, as a bean salad with the papaya, nuts, and feta tossed in and took it to a pot luck lunch at the office. Everyone seemed to like it, though I didn't have anyone asking for the recipe. - A nice twist on an old standard.

I liked this OK when I made it, but I think I improved it. Actually it's totally different. I mad the dressing with 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and hot pepper flakes (as suggested), then I thought that it did need oil. But I am currently on Weight Watchers, so I added buttermilk and some balsamic vinegar. I dressed a composed salad of green beans, asparagus, roast beets and blanched carrots over lettuce. The feta and nuts finished it off (I used toasted slivered almonds since that what was handy). Very pretty and really good. Much more sophisticated flavors than the original.

I made this recipe for my friends for a BBQ meal at the race track. It was a hit. They ate all the beans and used the extra vinaigrette as dip for the crudites. Will be making it again.

I made this dish for Easter and it was a huge hit! I took the suggestion from another cook and tossed the beans in a little olive oil first with a dash of cayenne before adding the vinaigrette. However, I didn't use the greens, I just served it as a green bean salad. Also, the feta and papaya tossed in really made it outstanding!

My husband thinks this salad is awesome. He loved the apricot vinaigrette (but didn't know what it was until I told him). I followed the recipe exactly. I used Kerns apricot-pineapple nectar. It's available at most markets. This salad would be good even without the green beans, which took a little time to cook -- just double up on the greens.

I'm with everyone else - this is a delicious salad. The complex blend of flavors is unique and wonderful. I keep the dressing on hand now. I didn't have papaya, so used sliced peaches, which were very good. Definitely a keeper.

This is a wonderful salad dressing--thick, tangy, and satisfying. I encorporated others' suggestions (namely adding 2 garlic cloves and 1 tsp sesame oil) before blending. Took this dressing to a potluck pizza party, served over a variant of this salad: mixed greens, yellow bell peppers, sliced scallions, toasted pistachios, and herbed feta--great!

This is an EXCELLENT salad, the first dish that I have given a rating of 4 forks! I didn't have dried apricots, so I used dried figs. Still yummy. We will definitely make this dish again!

Wonderful! The apricot vinaigrette is terrific. I made this for a small dinner party and they all asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper. ( I now keep the vinaigrette on hand for salad dressing.)

I've made this salad twice and plan to make it again for a party today. It's excellent. The second time I doubled the recipe and substituted pear slices for the papaya, and cut the green beans to a small size so I could toss it in a large bowl and serve it at a BBQ with friends. The dressing is a little tart for me, so I just make less of it. I'll have to try some of the suggestions I've seen in previous reviews. Thanks Epicurious. This is a great site.

I've made this recipe 3 times in 2 weeks. Everyone has begged me for the recipe. I used apricot nector. It's a great summer time salad.

I've made this salad several times & everyone loves yet. I add 1-2 cloves of crushed garlic, a splash of olive oil & a dash of cayenne pepper to the dressing. The greens get soggy if you toss them with the dressing too far ahead of time, so I like to wait until just before serving to dress them.

To create an entree salad, I added grilled chicken. I was also craving some Asian flair, so I added 2 tablespoons sesame oil to the dressing....delicious result!

What a wonderful find for a low-fat recipe. I made it with balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar. Also, just apricot nectar for lack of the combo. I am now keeping a jar of the dressing in the refrigerator for use on other salads. Delicious

What a refreshing, unique dish! A big hit at our BBQ. Easy to serve buffet style on a large platter. I think that boiling the green bean for 5 mins. is too long, I like crispy green beans in a salad and they were a little on the soft side even with the ice water plunge after cooking. Try 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. Enjoy!

This is a very unique and delicious combination of flavors! I used apricot nectar instead of the apricot-pineapple nectar and feta cheese instead of the ricotta. A Must try!

Excellent and unusual. Good summer dish. I mixed Apricot Nectar with Pineapple juice (couldn't find the mix) and it worked out fine.

Great refreshing salad. The apricot-pineapple nector is available in soda size cans under the label Kerns which is a division of Nestle. They have many varieties of gruit juices. I used the processor to puree and it worked great. The dressing would also be good on pork or ham.

I have no idea where to get pineapple-apricot nectar so I just went with apricot nectar and it was fantastic. The dried apricots didn't seem to blend into the dressing very well, even after plumping for 15 minutes. I think I'd use the food processor rather than the blender next time.
