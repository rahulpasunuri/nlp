to the previous cook - in my experience you have to squeeze all the water and starch out of shredded potatoes before trying to form them and fry them. You can use a dishtowel or paper towels for this. I always do this before I make any kind of potato cake or rosti type dish, otherwise like you said the potatoes don't crisp well and come out gummy.

I must have done something wrong. The dish came out soggy and tasteless. Any ideas anyone??

This is fabulous! Well worth the effort. I often add cheese, a good white cheddar is wonderful, but use any kind you like. I am a personal chef and my clients love this!
