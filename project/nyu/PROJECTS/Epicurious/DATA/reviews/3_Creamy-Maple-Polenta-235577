First time cooking polenta so didn't really know what to expect. Easy to make but be careful of the polenta boiling because it splatters and it's hot. It was good for a snowy brunch but I wouldn't bother again.

Amazing, amazing, amazing! We make it with 1% milk and half the butter, and it's still fabulous.

This is AMAZING. Everyone in my house gobbles it up. I made it with 1% milk and half the butter the second time, and it was just as delicious.

I have made this recipe more than 100 times. I love it for a quick and hearty breakfast, a mid-day brunch, or with berries and brandy for dessert. This is a wonderfully easy recipe. I've topped this deliciousness with fruit, nuts, bananas foster ... use your imagination. But, let me know what you do and I'll do it too. hotDiggityBlog.com

Add some blueberries and a little rum or cointreau. Also use a finer grade of cornmeal then typically found in supermarkets. This was a homerun with guests

This was pretty good... fairly plain... next time I might add more maple syrup, but the flavours were good and it was quite creamy.
