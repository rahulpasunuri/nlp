This is best made as written. The butter doesn't taste heavy at all. In fact, the butter makes it lighter than cream cheese-based spreads. It's a whole different animal; you should try it as is. The one change I usually make is to use pre-seasoned lemon pepper smoked trout, which punches up the lemon flavor nicely. It makes a nice filling for tea sandwiches as well.

I have made this recipe exactly as is many times, and it is wonderful - can't imagine using salmon or cream cheese in this ... I don't find it too rich at all, just delicious. Always gets rave reviews, and I love it because it is easy and can be made ahead of time. I've even found that it freezes decently, so I usually make a double batch and put some away for later. The only change I make is to puree all the trout, rather than reserving some chunks to stir in at the end, as I prefer a smoother texture. Be sure to serve it at room temperature, to get a more spreadable consistency. I like it on water crackers, or with cream cheese, tomato, onion, and capers on a bagel.

I am not rating this recipe, just commenting on the main ingredient since several people couldn't locate smoked trout and used salmon with so-so results. I found smoked trout at Costco, about $7/12- oz. Hot-smoked salmon would be a suitable substitute whereas canned or cold smoked salmon probably wouldn't work well. Hot-smoked fish is always a filet with the skin on, and is clearly cooked whereas cold smoked salmon has a raw texture similar to lox or nova. In Florida, smoked spread made from smoked white fish is very common. I've also had smoked fish spread in the Pacific Northwest made from hot- smoked salmon. I didn't make this recipe because the water and butter in this recipe was a surprise so found an alternative concoction using cream cheese. Came out great, and served it on endive leaves instead of crackers for some added pizzazz.

This recipe makes a lot and it's very rich. It was good, but seemed a bit bland to be honest; like it was missing something, but I'm not sure what. I smoked my own trout and loved it on it's own, but the flavor really diluted once it combined with all the other ingredients.

I too went 1/2 butter and 1/2 cream cheese with a lettle less water. Added a bit more lemon and a few grinds of sea salt. I and my guests liked it.

Excellent! I took other reviewer's suggestions and used 1 stick of unsalted butter and 1/2 cup whipped light cream cheese (instead of 2 sticks butter), and only used about 2/3-3/4 cup water - checking the consistency as I blended. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was positively delicious. The crowd of 7 people devoured it. I served it with melba toasts and wheat crackers, but next time I'd would use more firm/thicker cracker (like an Akmak or RyKrisp) or mini pumpernickel or rye bread rounds.

Definitely too rich as is. Would go lighter on butter, cream cheese would probably be the way to go. Didn't put as much water as stated in the recipe - was adding it in small quantities - I think the whole quantity would be too much.

I couldn't find smoked trout on short notice, so I substitued dry smoked salmon. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter, and served it with crispbread wafers. My guests devoured it. Personally, I found it a bit rich.

I used trout that had been smoked by my butcher with lemon and pepper. I used half a cup of water, then checked taste and consistency...perfect. This made three small dishes full, one for us, one for my smoked trout mad dad and one as a gift for a friend! The flaked trout was fantastic, made it less 'processed' tasting. I agree with the other reviewer that when substituting ingredients enormously, you are actually making and rating something quite different.

I substituted smoked Dorado for the trout. Fortunately I did not add all of the smoked fish to the rest of the ingredients before making a small test batch. I tried a small taste of the mixture with the fish and found it too oily and mushy. I started over and substituted lite cream cheese for the butter. I did not process the smoked trout as suggested. I stirred it into the cream cheese in large flaked pieces. It was very good and less fattening which my guests appreciated.

To the person who used salmon instead -- don't rate recipes if you've switched a main ingredient! I can't imagine tabasco with salmon! If it was watery, it's because you added too much.

Made this for a gathering of the guys I fish with. Everyone loved it.

I made this with smoked salmon and it was a waste of good salmon. The texture was unpleasant, watery. Wouldn't recommend it.

It's very rich of course, but an excellent use of smoked trout. If you smoke your own, you will probably need to add salt. I also increased the pepper and hot sauce.
