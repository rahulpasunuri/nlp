I suppose my expectations were higher: the purple cauliflower and the whip creeam sauce was the best bit, perhaps, but altogether not too eager to cook it again.

I was hesitant to make this recipe because it looks so white and bland, and I did try to make it more appealing by adding a bed of sauteed swiss chard, but it still didn't work. The flavors sort of blended in to each other and nothing really stood out. I should have paid attention to other reviewers and added more spice, but I won't be making this again. I made the cauliflower puree with only 1/2 cup of cream. It was good, but still looks like paste, and I have a lot left over. I may try to thin it with chicken stock and turn it into a soup, although I'm concerned the cream may cause it to curdle. If I try that, I'll report back.

Great recipe! I used Cod instead of Monkfish and like many others substituted chicken stock for all of the water, which added a lot of flavor. For the sauce I didn't use cream and only used cauliflower, chicken stock, butter, salt and pepper. It was delicious! Will definitely be making this again!

Awesome combination of flavors, sturdy ingredients, in all a lovely dish. I will definitely use the califlower sauce for other purposes. A great recipe that lends itself to many variations.

I used double the curry and half the paprika. I did not make the sauce. I used chicken broth instead of water. AND I topped the finished lentil cauliflower mixture with roasted unsalted cashews before serving. Delicious and healthy.

This was nice. I was worried about the other reviews that said it was bland. I changed a few things. Instead of using just water to cook the lentils, I used 50/50 water-chicken stock. As far as the cauliflower, I skipped the cream too. I used 1/2 yogurt & 1/2 low fat milk whisked together. I think this gave the cauliflower a nice tangy quality. I tasted the cauliflower through out the cooking process, and found that the major infusion of flavor came with the final stage of browning the cauliflower. I never ended up adding the water because there was liquid left over from the simmering step. Rockfish is somewhat bland, but after seasoning with lots of salt and pepper, everything worked great together. I accidentally forgot the parsley and lemon, but think that would have made it even better. One problem with the description of this recipe is that it is not a cauliflower puree as mentioned in the recipe. Good and healthy!

Vegetarians (and meat eaters like me who care about good health) rejoice. This is a fantastic dish. I skipped the whipping cream and used a little 2% milk mixed with water. I made the puree but mixed it into the lentils and cauliflower. I skipped the butter and sauteed the cauliflower with olive oil. Wonderful as a side for salmon or as a main course with a little brown rice. Everything is in there!

I doubled the curry and still found this extremely bland. Would not make again.

I didn't make the monkfish but the lentils and cauliflower are a delicious side, or just served as a stew would be great too.

the lentils and browned butter cauliflower portion of this recipe is quite bland - and i found the lentils to be mushy after less than 20 mins of cooking.

Wow - I loved this. The only things I did differently was use cayenne pepper instead of paprika as that was all I had in the cupboard, and I cooked the lentils for longer as after 30 minutes they were way too crunchy. The cauliflower/cream sauce is a vital component in this dish as it adds depth. An easy dish to prepare and perfect for entertaining as you can do so much in advance.

I also did only the lentils part of this recipe. I thought they were really mushy. I did use lentilles de Puy and 2/12 cups of water but I think it would have been better with even less water. I don't like the lentils to totally fall apart. A better lentil recipe from this site is the braised lentils. I use that one over and over. Maybe next time I will add cauliflower to that recipe. I did like the addition of cauliflower it gave some much needed flavor.

This is a wintertime brunch and dinner dish that I come back to over and over again. Fragrant curry is the key to the dish, magically melding the flavors of the cauliflower, lentils, fish, and gremolata. Never been crazy for the texture of monkfish, so I usually substitute a firmer, flakier whitefish. Making the separate components of the dish is an involved and time-consuming process, but everything except the fish can be prepared way in advance and re-heated as the fish cooks. The cauliflower puree retains heat beautifully, so one can take one's time plating the food and be sure that it will arrive at the table piping hot.

Only did the lentils and cauliflower part. Was very good despite my misgivings during cooking (the lentils seemed bland). The cauliflower is terrific and adds much needed flavor. Added some cumin and butter to the lentils--next time will add bacon and garlic. Lentils needed more fat to bring out flavor.

i got a HUGE head of cauliflower in my organic box this week and it's not my favorite...but this dish was a great hit, especially the sauce...mmmm....maybe more curry next time? the lentils/cauliflower needed a little something extra, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and it was great...best way to eat cauliflower
