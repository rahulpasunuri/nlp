I had low expectations for this deceptively simple dish, but boy was I wrong! This is absolutely delicious. I used Greek basil, which has a bit of spice to it, and freshly caught snapper.My guests were blown away by how strongly the flavor of the vinaigrette came through after such easy preparation. I will absolutely make this again many, many times.

This was terrific and I'll be making it often and trying it with different kinds of fish as well. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a recipe to showcase very fresh ingredients. I bought the red snapper from the fishmonger the same morning I made the dish, also used fresh lemons and fresh basil. I think it's better to broil than to bake because the fish comes out more moist.

I loved it! My family loved it! I think the main trick is to use fresh ingredients.

This was ok. It was a simple week day meal. I baked the fish in the oven on 350 as I do not like the broiler on my oven. I served it with the olive oil glazed potatoes and broccoli.

I served this at a large holiday meal. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Simple, yet attention-grabbing. I couldn't find good fresh snapper when I wanted to use this recipe, so I put the vinaigrette over tilapia fillets and it worked very well. I also didn't want to turn my broiler on, so I baked it in the oven on high temperature.

I have been trying to eat more fish in my diet, and this was a great recipe. I loved how light it was. My husband is not a fish person either and he thought it was good. Great sign. I used fresh basil, which tasted wonderful with the snapper.

QUITE BLAND. THERE ARE MANY MORE INTERESTING RECIPES FOR RED SNAPPER THAT WOULD DO IT BETTER JUSTICE. EVEN JUST A LITTLE GARLIC BUTTER WOULD BE NICER!

Excellent, simple yet very tasty. Easy to make. Some times the best ones are those with just a few ingredients. So make sure you have very fresh snapper, good quality basil and use only fresh squeezed lemon juice - that will make the difference in this dish.

This was definately not a great recipe. It was just okay. It was very easy and fast to prepare though.

To MC218 from Grosse Point...Just lightly oil the pan so the fish won't stick. The oil in the recipe ingredient list is used as per the instructions, but a small additional amount is required for the pan (I would just brush oil in the pan). This is a nice fish recipe. And, very easy to prepare.

Very tasty, but this is not really a "recipe." It's . . . uh. . . broiled fish.

To mc218 from Grosse Pointe Woods, MI -- The recipe says to oil the pan, not to put oil IN the pan.

Just a quick question before I try it--When it says preheat broiler and oil in a shallow baking pan, how much oil does it mean? Thanking you in advance.

I love this recipe. I've used this vinigrette on all kinds of seafood. I also like to cook this on the grill.

It doesn't have vinegar but it does have lemon juice which is acidic and stands in for the vinegar. I was thinking this would be delicious with bluefish as well.

Lemon juice serves as the vinegar simply delicious!

This was a fine dish when prepared according to directions, and quite simple. And "A Cook" your point is well taken. But "vinaigrette" does not=containing vinegar. In general, it connotes a sauce with an acetic ingredient whisked with oil. Here, the lemon is that ingredient. Other acetic ingredients could include lime, orange etc. There is no ingredient missing.

A vinaigrette needs something acidy, not necessarily vinegar - lemon juice suffices. No ingredient has been left out.

I haven't tried this yet, but am wondering...doesn't vinaigrette usually have vinegar? Did they leave out an indredient?
