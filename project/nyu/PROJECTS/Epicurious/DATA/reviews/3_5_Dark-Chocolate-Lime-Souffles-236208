do not try to make this recipe if you want a real souffle. if you are in for some sort of low-carb muffin thing, however, these would be good. i baked these for 13 minutes and they were still somewhat dry. the whipped cream is essential. dont skip it. the flavors combine nicely though

Excellent recipe to try. As others have said, take care not to over bake or it will quickly become too dry. I've used orange juice/peel as an alternative to the lime and it was delicious!

Delicious. I gave three forks because it wasn't exactly like a souffle, more like a muffin. But I was not sure how to time this one. Does one prepare the batter in advance and put the souffles in the oven just before serving (after eating main course) or does one bake the souffle in advance and then reheat just before serving.

Family & guests loved this. Lime whippped cream was just the right touch. Ingredients & timing just right. Have been asked for the recipe 4 times after just one dinner.

This was one of the best desserts I've made. Based on previous reviews, I was concerned about overbaking so only left them in the oven for 12 minutes which wasn't long enough and they didn't totally set. They were, however, absolutely wonderful anyway. The whipped cream on its own was very tart, but when each spoonful was matched with the bitterweet chocolate it was fantastic. Easy recipe, quick to do, and restaurant quality results. I will make again and not change a thing.

This was so much fun to make. i took these treats to a dinner party and they were the hit of the whole show. I used a few extra chocolate chips to loosen up the dry cake. I would make this delicious recipe for any nice dinner function.

I listened to the suggestions and didn't bake it for 14 minutes and it turned out to be absolutely delish. The lime whipped cream also had a unique taste that complemented the soufflé nicely

It just doesn't make sense that a souffle has chocolate chips in it. Doesn't that break a rule? They were dense and dry at 14 minutes. Consistency is more like a muffin. If you can cook it correctly, an Armagnac goes very well.

The souffles were a bit dense, but it could have been due to my techniques and not the recipe. Do not overbake. Great flavors. The lime cream is excellent. I will use it with other recipes.

Absolutely fabulous! We were literally licking the last bits from our dishes. The lime whipped cream is essential - don't skip it!
