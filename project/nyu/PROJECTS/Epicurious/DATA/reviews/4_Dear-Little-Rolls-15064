Simple, quick rolls that are essentially crescent rolls. The butter is what makes them--we used butter instead of margarine and I highly recommend you do the same. The crumb isn't terribly complex and that's what's preventing me giving these rolls 4 spoons: I expect a little more from a homemade roll, but these are simple and fast.

I made these rolls because I ran out of bread flour and this recipe didn't require it. I did as several reviewers suggested and used 2 packages of yeast and let it bloom first. While not the greatest roll I've ever had, these were super easy and pretty tasty. I used one third of the recipe to make dinner rolls and the rest to make cinnamon rolls. I would definitely make this recipe again for dinner rolls if I was out of bread flour, and would use it again to make cinnamon rolls.

I've been using this recipe for years and love it. I've even used half a packet of yeast and it still came out fine. It's important to make sure that your milk isn't too hot or it'll kill the yeast. I also proof the yeast by combining it with the milk and sugar for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients. If you do these two things your dough should rise just fine.

My family loved these rolls, although my boyfriend and I agreed with the other reviewers who said that they were a little sweet and a little bland. If I make them again, I might use less sugar and more salt. It's true that the dough takes a lot longer to rise than the recipe says it will. Mine only really started to rise after about 3 hours. I'm also not so sure what people were talking about when they said that the recipe is not labor intensive. Overall, though, I liked that recipe and I'll probably make it again.

This is a great, simple sweet white roll recipe. I agree with other reviewers that 2 packets of yeast (proofed in the cooled liquids before adding to the flour) will guarantee a good rise. Also, to improve the flavor, shape the dough and let it rise for the second time overnight in the fridge. Then just bring them to room temperature & make sure they've risen to your desired 'puffiness' level, and then bake according to instructions. This extra step lets you prep the day before and also makes for a more flavorfull roll.

This a wonderful recipe. I use it to make Kolaches, which I filled with bacon/egg/cheese or egg/sausage or spinach/garlic/ mushroom. The eggs I scrambled and only cooked them until slightly runny to avoid overcooking in the oven. They are a BIG breakfast hit around here! 10 minutes to reheat in the oven every morning and my husband and children get a hot meal!

I've made many batches of this roll over the years. While most of them have turned out well, some have flopped, especially when I try to cut the rising time and end up with hard little nuggets. My family likes a sweet roll but I have decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and it seems sweet enough. I also use butter instead of margarine. Also, I've learned to adjust oven temps when necessary. We've never had leftovers but it is so popular with our relatives that I've had to make extra. Even when I've added variations (wheat flour, nuts, herbs, dried or some combination) of the roll alongside the plain, it is the latter that disappears first!

Per other reviewers I used two packets of yeast and only 1/4c sugar. These were great. Since it is just my husband and I, I used half for cinnamon rolls and half for dinner rolls. I would have liked them slightly fluffier for the dinner rolls, anyone have any ideas?

fairly disappointed with the results. we felt the rolls were flavorless. not worth making again when decent rolls are so cheap. i definitely can't recommend these. i guess if you don't have access to decent rolls, then these would be a fair alternative...

I've been making these rolls for 2 years now. To make them 4-star quality I made some changes to the recipe. I use only butter no margarine. Let the dough rise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours on the first rising and 2 hours the second. Mostly importantly I lowered the oven temperature to 325 and bake them approximately 15 minutes. Restaurant quality results!

While experienced at making bread, this was my first try with rolls, and these were absolutely delicious. A big Thanksgiving hit with everyone. Will definitely make them again--many more times!

This is the second time I've made these, and they are so tasty. Yes, a little sweeter than some rolls, as someone comented, but I think it's more flavorful--slightly sweet is good with a soft, buttery roll. Next time I'm making them into round shapes--the croissant type comes out a bit too small. This dough would make awesome cinnamon rolls!

these were really disappointing. they had no flavor...they were flavorless rolls. i thought maybe i had done something wrong but when i looked at the recipe again i know i did everything right. even w. all of the butter and sugar there was no flavor

These are wonderful! I used only butter and am a little concerned about arteries as the rolls are brushed in melted butter at every junction, but the taste is well worth it! A perfect holiday roll.

These were a little too sweet for me. I would cut back on the sugar. They don't keep well. My dog enjoyed them the next day though.

Wonderful, but --in case you were wondering-- these do NOT freeze well.

I forgot to proof the yeast as another reviewer suggested and it took forever to rise. After an hour and seeing that the dough hadn't changed I started to get worried. In another hour the yeast finally started to kick in and I ended up with the cutest, tasty little things! I got lots of compliments at Thanksgiving and they disappeared quickly.

These rolls were fabulous! They were so light and buttery. I loved them! The first rise took about 2 hours but they rose quickly once in the pan. I did not punch down the dough. I also just rolled them into balls, brushed with butter, spinkled with sesame and poppy seeds and baked in round cake pans and muffin tins. I recommend not using non-stick muffin tins. Those rolls burned slightly even though the cooking time wasn't up. The other rolls came out perfectly, though.

I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner both this year and last. My husband and guests have raved about them on both occassions. Due to the long raising time, I start the dough the day before baking. After dough has risen once, punch it down, shape it into a ball and place in a greased bowl. Put it the fridge covered with plastic. The next day, punch down, let it rest about 20 minutes and shape into rolls. Then let rise again. I prefer larger rolls than the recipe calls for and so cut them into 24 rather than 36 pieces. Watch them! They burn easily. 8 minutes max. Definitely a keeper recipe

These made a nice addition to our Thanskgiving dinner, these were pretty tasty rolls that were very easy to prepare. Following other reviewers advice, I first added the yeast to heated milk with a pinch of sugar and then added the margarine and other ingredients (I used half butter and half margarine) to help with the rising process. I also cut the dough into strips and tied simple knots around several pieces of cut garlic chives. Next time I think I will add herbs to the dough to give the buns a little extra something.

These were so incredibly delicious! The dough did take forever to rise (more than 2 hours), but other than that, PERFECTION! The end result was a yeasty, slightly sweet, tender roll that undoubtedly beats the store-bought kind. My friends raved about them and couldn't believe that I made them from scratch. I rolled them up in little balls, baked them in round cake pans, then split them up and used them in the "Mini Ham and Cheese Rolls" recipe that is also on this Web site. They made for extremely delicious and satisfying appetizers. I will definitely make these rolls again and again; I'm sure my whole family would appreciate this recipe, too!

These rolls were absolutely wonderful; everyone raved about them. I almost tried to cut the recipe in half, fearing that people would never eat so many for dinner. Wrong! There are only about 5 left. I did make one change; used butter instead of margerine in the recipe. This recipe shall replace my staple recipe for dinner rolls.

Love these rolls! Mine also took a long time to rise. Luckily I anticipated this and prepared them early for Thanksgiving dinner, setting them aside and giving them plenty of time to do their thing. It was worth the wait! My 10 yr. old step-daughter loved them so much, she pleaded every night for a week that we make them again!

I made these rolls yesterday for a Christmas dinner I attended. They were perfection. After reading the other reviews, I decided to call the (800) Fleishmann's yeast experts. I mentioned how long other people said these rolls take to rise, and she suggested a couple of changes: 1) instead of 1 cup milk, make it half cup milk/half cup water. Also, use 2 packages of dry yeast (I had the Rapid Rise). also, I warmed the milk/water to about 110 to 115 degrees, and put in the soft butter, which melted. My dough was a bit sticky, so I added a bit more flour. I used my mixer with dough hooks, and only mixed about 3 mins. then kneaded by hand. These rolls were a great hit with everyone. They were soft, tender and delicious, and their appearance was "professional." I let them rise in my furnace room (where the thermometer registered 85-90 degrees. They rose with no problems and didn't take long at all. KCD in Virginia

I highly recommend these--they were very popular at our Thanksgiving this year. I didn't think the rolls took an excessively long time to rise--but I followed the advice of the earlier reviewer and proofed the yeast with 1/4 c. warm water and a little sugar. Also the kitchen was very warm from all the Thanksgiving cooking.

Outstanding. I followed the recipe to the letter and got terrific results. I used Quick Rise yeast that I got at an ordinary grocery store and I didn't have to wait long for it to rise Tender, golden and with a rich yeast taste, yummers. I could easily see adding cinnamon sugar when the triangles were rolled up to create cinnamon buns. Give this one a try!!

Delicious! Easy. You don't have to do the shaping thing. Just roll balls in butter and put them in a pan. This makes great pan rolls, too.

Very delicious rolls. However, the time limit to cook them in the oven should be 7-10 minutes. I found they start to burn longer then 10 minutes, even on the top rack. To eliminate the enormous time waiting for the rolls to rise, I made these rolls like making bread: a quarter cup of tepid water with a teaspoon of sugar with the yeast, then added the eggs, flour, etc. They were a hit at our barbeque.

As others have said, these do take a litle longer to rise then the recipe says, but they are flexible in that you can make them a day or two ahead of time and just bring them to room temperature before you bake them. I added a generous pinch of saffron to the dough, and then they had a delicately sweet taste and a pale yellowish color that made them excellent to serve with a warm winter stew or a squash soup. I would definitely make them again--try the saffron!

Nice and light and fluffy. The kids loved them. After punching these down after the first rise, I put the dough in the fridge overnight and made the rolls the next afternoon. The dough did rise some overnight, but plan to make the rolls 1 1/2 to 2 hours before baking to allow ample time for the rolls to rise.

These rolls were a big hit at Thanksgiving. Everyone loved them. I would give them 4 forks, but like everyone else has mentioned, they took forever to rise. I added the yeast to the warm milk mixture to speed things up. Didn't work. They will be a Thanksgiving tradition from now on anyway.

Absolutely perfect and easy to make!! Beware though... It took about 2 hours each time for the dough to rise. Don't be in a rush. I refrigerated the dough after cutting and shaping it, then baked it two days later for Thanksgiving. My family has decided to have these for all holiday meals from now on.

I am a beginner baker when it comes to yeast rised bread. I followed the recipie as written,and I did get my yeast to rise quickly, put it together and knead, however, I did not find these rolls to my liking,I didn't like the taste, or the texture, I am not sure if I did something wrong when rolling it out, but they didn't come out like the ones in the bakery, it must be my inexperience. If someone could give me some good points on how to knead, or roll the rolls I will be forever grateful.

These were fabulous. However they took forever to rise, when I make them again I think I will proof the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water with a bit of sugar and reduce the milk by a quarter of a cup to see if this speeds them up. I also spread one third of the dough with butter,brown sugar and cinnamon and made a dozen cinnamon buns along with the rolls. They were terrific too.
