What an outstanding recipe! Don't know how anyone could make this sweet, unless only sweet pickles were used. I used cornichons for the pickle, and the sauce was great. Also had very nice fresh, whole mackerel, which I butterflied, left on head and tail, and gently removed spine and other bones. Nice presentation, and guests really enjoyed the dish. Add an additional half hour prep time to clean, debone, and butterfly six fish.

I had fresh Mackerel and this was great! I had to use fresh (not pickled) sweet onion and added red and yellow peppers. I cooked it on the grille in tinfoil. The fish was just great and I will be trying the concept with other "fishy" fish.

whoa. intense. i'm not rating this recipe, just commenting on it... i actually like most of the ingredients here - mackerel's my favorite sushi, i like my martinis dirty with pickled onions when possible, and i'm addicted to maille dijon mustard - but even i don't think i would try to make this dish! crazee!!!!

My husband liked this a lot, but I hated it. This unusual since I love fish and USED to like mackeral. The onions and pickle butter were very nice, and I probably will use it on fish that I like i.e., catfish, shad, etc. I may even use it on a shrimp broil. However, it needs lemony flavoring to cut down the sweetness of the onion-pickle butter.
