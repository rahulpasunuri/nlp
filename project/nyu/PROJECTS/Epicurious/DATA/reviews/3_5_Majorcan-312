Having studied in Mallorca for a year during college, this pizza, or "coca", was a staple of my diet. This is a good recipe, but my host family there always added a 1/2 cup of beer (that's right) to the dough mixture and sprinkled on a good measure of pepper over the chopped vegetables.

The best pizza ever, according to my husband. I put a bit of ricotta and mozarella on the top, and used a more traditional pizza crust.

worthy rendition. authentically made on flute bread, but the white bread dough was a decent substitution. never sampled this in mallorca but did have a taste in valencia. often sliced tomatoes and/or slated spanish anchovies are added as well.

Slightly sweet but good. A definite make-again.
