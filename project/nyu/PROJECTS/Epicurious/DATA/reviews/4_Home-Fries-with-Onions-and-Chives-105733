Great recipe. Chilling does make all the difference. I cheated once and only chilled for an hour and they were not as good. My family loves it.

This recipe seems like a lot of work but it is actually very easy. I added one red bell pepper to the onions as suggested by others. Everyone loved the potatoes - they make a great breakfast side.

These home fries browned up so much faster and better than any others I've ever made; the chilling process must be the key. Works well for a do ahead dish, as the potatoes can be browned on the stove top and then moved directly into the oven in an iron skillet (or tranferred to baking dished if you're making a lot) to keep warm before serving. Added some sliced garlic and red pepper flakes to the onions, which also worked perfectly done ahead. Chives added much-needed color to the finished product; next time, will add red pepper also as suggested by other reviewers.

made this for a new years day brunch--everyone had seconds, thirds, and just kept eating it all day--it was a huge hit!

The flavor was very nice. It took a long time to make it, so we started it the night before. But it was worth the wait.

I made this for mother's day and everyone loved it! Chilling the potatoes does indeed make a difference, and my engineer husband said the theory has scientific merit. I would make it again!

This is a good basic recipe for Home Fries. I will make three changes when I make it again. First I will peel the potatoes. I will add some small dice red pepper for color and sweetness. Finally I will toss the potatoes with the olive oil and add a little spice like some cayenne pepper. I cooked the potatoes on a cast iron skillet and that worked very well.

These are the best home fries I've ever had. Very easy recipe.

A good breakfast (or lunch/dinner, although the leftovers didn't make it past noon). I used dill and a little parsley instead of chives. Nice and easy.

The home fries were delicious. I used a little less butter than the recipe called for and it was fine. I also cooked all the potatoes at the same time using an electric griddle. It saved some time and effort.

These were some of the best tasting home fries I ever had. Followed recipe, but did not add olive oil. Instead, I drained most of the grease off of a pan I had just fried bacon in and added about 2 tbs butter. Took the cook from Denver's advice and diced the onions. Cooked the onions and potatoes together. They did not really crisp up a whole lot, but, man, you just won't care. Served with bacon and herbed brie scrambled eggs. Deeelicious. The chives made for a nice presentation. I'll make this one again for sure.

Very easy, and simple. I made it for a brunch, and everyone loved them. I had decided to make them at the last minute, and couldn't find chives, so I went without -- they were still great, although I do intend to make them again trying chives.

These potatoes were excellent. In addition to this dish, for Easter I made the three cheese and egg dish and the spicy sweet bacon from the brunch menu in this issue. It was a big hit. For this dish, the onions were too thinly sliced and clumped together. I recommend dicing the onions into bigger pieces so that they mix in better with the potatoes when tossed. I would definitely make this dish again.
