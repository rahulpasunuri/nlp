This salad was the perfect complement to a delicious beet risotto: http://kitchentable.wordpress.com/2007/12/27/recipe-beet-risotto-with-greens/ Because the risotto is accented with lemon juice and lemon zest, I looked for a citrus salad. I used Cara Cara oranges because of their pretty pink tinge. I didn't have any ripe avocados in hand, but the recipe still worked out fine.

We thought this salad was wonderful. I substituted Meyer lemon juice for vinegar. I will make often.

Good combinations of tastes and textures, however I would cut the fennel portion in half.

very good. I added a slpash of orange juice to the dressing and also added quinoa for a protein source and it made a great lunch.

Delicious recipe! The combination of orange, fennel and avacado is delicious. I wouldn't change this recipe a bit.

I really did not like the texture of this meal. There were too many textures and the flavor was extremely odd. It is not something I would make again.

Absolutely delicious. An unusual combination of ingredients but it works really well. Easy to make, too. I doubled everything but the fennel & felt those were good proportions, and it served 5 people.
