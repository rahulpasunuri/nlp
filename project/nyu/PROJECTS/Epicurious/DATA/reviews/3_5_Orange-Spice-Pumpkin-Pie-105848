Excellent -- still tastes like pumpkin pie, but with a fun twist. I substituted a tiny amount of fresh grated ginger for the candied stuff to preserve the smooth texture. Also lazily used pre-made graham tart crusts; the recipe filled exactly 12. A big hit with some family members who aren't typically pumpkin pie fans.

I made this for our Canadian Thanksgiving on Monday, and it was sensational! Creamy, cheesecake texture with hints of orange and ginger. I don't generally like pumpkin pie, but this was definitely not ordinary. I used a large can of pumpkin, and doubled the ingredients to make two full 9" pies.

this is hands down the worst pie i have ever, ever made. i followed the recipe to the letter and the ginger overpowered the pie to the point i couldn't taste the pumpkin. if you are going to make this pie, i would suggest cutting the ginger in half, or more.

Crystalized ginger & orange zest gave this flair without turning it into anything other than a traditional pie. My guests loved it, as did I.

I just posted and now I rememeber I didnt use the crust recipe or add the rum.

I made this pie 2 years ago, and it was great. It was the perfect combo of "traditional and different" memorable enough for me to go looking for the recipe 2 years later (I originally got it out of the magazine) (someone else brought the pies last year.)

Good texture, I added a tablespoon of zest instead of a teaspoon and it overpowered the pumpkin taste.

This pie turned out very well. I added extra spices in the mix and candied citrus peel on the top for a lovely decoration. See a photo and check out how I did mine on www.porcinichronicles.blogspot.com

I made this back in 2001 for Thanksgiving or Christmas (can't remember which) and am going to be making it again tomorrow. The traditionalists in my family thought it was excellent and it was different enough to make me happy (I like to try new desserts all the time, even for traditional meals).

I actually haven't made this recipe. but someone asked about using fresh pumpkins (how can you not find canned pumpkins around? they seemed to be EVERYWHERE). definitely use a small pumpkin, usually referred to as a "sweet pumpkin" or "pie pumpkin" and avoid the big ones. they aren't good for anything but decorations! cut up two or three sugar pumpkins into large chunks, and removed the seeds. then steam over boiling water for 25 to 30 minutes until fork tender. drain and let the pumpkin cool. then scrape out the meat of the pumpkin from the skin and puree in a food processor in 1 cup batches. you can also cook the pumpkin in the microwave (roughly 15 minutes but it depends on your microwave) or bake the pumpkin (350F for about an hour). if you want your pie to extra smooth and glossy you can press the puree through a fine mish sieve or use a food mill with the finest disk. enjoy.

I plan to make this tomorrow, but I want to respond to the cook from Ireland. I just got through cooking a fresh pumpkin, and they are superior to canned puree. If you can, get a Sugar Baby, or pie pumpkin; they're slightly larger than an acorn squash (you have those in Ireland?) You may need two, depending on size. Cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, place it in a shallow baking pan cut side down and cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 375? until its soft; mine was done in an hour. When cool, scrape the pulp out of the shell and puree. Some recipes have you steam it, but it is less wet this way. Good luck!

Lovely subtle orange flavour and a nice light texture to the filling.

I made this pie last year for Thanksgiving. Everyone is my family loved it. This is the best pumpkin pie that I've ever had.

I can't find canned pumpkin. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how much pumpkin I should buy, what variety (the big, jack-o-lantern ones are tasteless), and how to cook it? I'm afraid the pumpkin will be too wet compared to the canned stuff. I'm sure you can make a pumpkin pie from a real pumpkin (what did those pilgrims do?).

I'm not a pumpkin pie lover by nature, but I made this for a dessert for a church group, and even used a good frozen pie crust, and this tasted wonderful!! So easy and tastes great - a BIG plus in my collection!

Be sure to FINELY chop the crystalized ginger. A nice pie.

Each year I try another recipe for pumpkin pie. No more. This is a wonderful, light tasting treat that disappeared in no time at all. I did cheat a bit by using a purchased, good quality pie shell. Try it !

I forgot the eggs and it still came out good (though it was a bit soft before refridgerating). I loved the orangy-gingery taste. I also used the remaining heavy cream to create some whipped cream to top the pie...this would probably make an excellent pumpkin brulee recipe as well!

This was the most delicious pumpkin pie I've ever eaten. It came out creamy and delicious. The orange scented flavor made the pie memorable. This is a very extravagant, exotic pumpkin pie that I feel everyone could love.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and the whole family liked it. Even my husband who is not a pumpkin pie fan thought it was good. I already have requests to make it again for Christmas.

A delightful change from the normal and mundane pumpkin pie. A treasure that erases boredom and prompts raves. I made this pie for the first time last year, and everyone raved about it. If made correctly, or even tested with a lighter hand, it should produce an excellent pie. I also found that it made TWO pies, instead of the one.

A pretty decent pumpkin pie. I used fresh pumpkin puree (which is surprisingly easy to make). I also substituted half of the brown sugar for 1/4 cup of maple syrup, and halved the amount of orange peel (which I'll omit the next time as I found it was a little too strong for the pumpkin). Follow up: made this pie again recently. Bumped up the maple syrup to 1/3 cup and completely omitted the orange zest. Turned out great and got rave reviews.

This pie was not good. Wayyyyy too orangie. It tasted like I'd put a creamsicle in it. Wait, I guess I sort of did. Anyway, not good. I'll stick with the traditional recipes.

I madethis pie for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. It has a much fresher, lighter taste than most pumpkin pies. I put some triple sec in the whipped cream and that went very well with it.

We made this for Thanksgiving, and it was well-received by all, even those who are not usually fans of pumpkin pie. It is lighter than many other versions of pumpkin pie, and the orange peel and rum subtly enhance the pie's flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper--we will be making it again for sure!

This is the best Pumpkin Pie EVER! I normally dislike pumpkin pie, but this recipe was the best and we all loved it at Thanksgiving. Will definately add it to my recipe book for future gatherings! I doubled the recipe the next day and found it made enough to make 3 nine-inch size pies.

Delicious pie - got big raves in our house for thanksgiving... the pie was not fully cooked after one hour, though.

We LOVE pumpkin pie and this is the best one yet. An indescribable fluffy custard. I served it with your recipe for honey-marscapone topping. The two flavors are incredible together!! Took it to the family Thanksgiving, & the other pumpkins pies were left just sitting there looking envious! This recipe is now a holiday regular. I used 1 Tbs of an Austrian rum called Strohs that has a "fruity" bouquet and brought out the orange perfectly.

Pumpkin pie is always a favorite in this house! We usually have 4 pies of different kinds and pastries. I made two this afternoon, one for tomorrow (Thanksgiving) and one to try after dinner and it's after dinner! We love this pie! There is none left and I'm warning everyone to stay away from the other pie; until dessert is served tomorrow! It is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness and the fresh orange rind gives great flavor. This pumpkin pie is now going to be part of my holiday recipe file; it's a KEEPER!
