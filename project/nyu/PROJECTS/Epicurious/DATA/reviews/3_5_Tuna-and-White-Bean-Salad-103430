I don't even like seafood, but I loved this recipe. I made it as-is and served it with italian bread. I thought it was a little heavy on the oil especially because it is packed in oil, but that is easy to change per preference. My husband who is very picky and looked at it with a frown also ended up loving it. I wouldn't change a thing.

Pretty darn good. I would go easier next time with the fresh sage, as a little goes a long way. I also used Whole Foods albacore tuna in water, but drizzled a really good olive oil on it. I served it on a bed of arugula with tomatoes. Makes a nice light lunch. Next time, I'll try cilantro, because it's more "summer-y".

Very good and simple. I subbed navy beans as I was out of cannellini. Just took a bite and had to log on to say how good this is! Since there are so few ingredients, it is imperative that you use the best you can, as other reviewers have noted. I'm going back for more!

Love this dish! I added celery and served the bean/tuna combo with arugula (made extra dressing for the salad) and parmesan on the side. THE TRICK IS THE TUNA!! Use only good Italian tuna in olive oil- it makes this recipe sing!

This was a good recipe. I made a few slight changes: used tuna in water vs. oil, skipped the sage, added fresh cilantro and fresh lemon juice.

Very popular at a weekend lunch. Used the best tuna I could get. Also followed another reviewer's advice and added cilantro instead of parsely.

This is a yummy summertime staple using the highest quality ingredients.

I made this for a luncheon today and received good reviews. I used Italian Tuna (Tonno) in olive oil and added no additional oil. I also used two cans of tuna to a can of beans and substituted fresh lemon juice for the vinegar. I added a little cilantro as well. Very good.

This recipe is great, but it's all about the quality of ingredients: Make sure to use high quality tuna and very good olive oil. Also, some good substitutions: Try scallions instead of onions; lemon instead of vinegar.

This is really nice summer salad recipe. I added a stalk of celery which provided a good crunchy texture in the salad. Also, I used a mix of fresh thyme, oregano, and sage so the salad wasn't overpowered by the herbs.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use some of the sage in my garden, and this was perfect. I used Progresso tuna in olive oil (didn't need to add add'l oil). It was quick and delicious and the herbs added such flavor and freshness. I will make this often.

What a great summer dish. I find it's even better on the second day, after the flavors have had some time to settle into one another.

Sage is a bit too much for delicate tuna - I'd cut it down or completely out. Thyme instead? It was tasty. I toasted a baguette and made a sandwich out of it.

You can't make this with tuna packed in water and then rate the recipe. It MUST be made with italian tuna packed in olive oil - it's a completely different flavor and not "bland" at all.

I added alot of salt/pepper and lemon juice, and this salad was fantastic. I tossed in a handful of toasted pine nuts the next day, and it was even better. I would definitely make this dish a day or at least a few hours ahead!

Only okay, very not special, and no matter how much I drained the beans, was still watery. Use freshly soaked beans perhaps? Not sure how to make it any better

I couldn't believe how simple and good this was! I didn't use the oil from the tuna, subsituted lemon juice and a dash of balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and added a minced garlic clove and some red pepper flakes (because this was crying out for them). Divine! And relatively healthy. The sage is key, I wouldn't bother making this if I didn't have any.

I did make this salad with the sage and parsley and it was wonderful! Even if you don't have the parsley, the sage is a really tasty addition to the beans. I served it on a bed of romaine for a little crunch-- yum!

Very good! Wouldn't serve it to guests but am planning on making it again this week to take for my lunch! I used flaked white tuna in water and didn't have parsley or sage and it was great (did add a little salt to the dressing). Try it, you'll like it! And it is a healthy choice...

I recommend that cooks follow the recipe exactly: it is a delicious, simple recipe with hearty, satisfying results. It is so easy to make, it's hard to imagine the results, but it is simply perfect just the way it is. This is a terrific low-fat salad that can stand as a meal - take it to the office for lunch: Jam-packed with protein. I love it!

I made this for a cooking store and improvised. I did not have the parsely or sage, so used some seasoning, oregano, and some chili oil. Also, used tuna packed in water and served it over a bed of romaine. Topped it all off with grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Every single person needed the recipe. This one is a keeper - added red hot chili peppers too!

Very simple with delicious results, even with variations. I used tuna packed in water and olive oil and it was still great.

Yummy. Great all-purpose lunch salad. I used 1/2 can beans to a small can tuna. Don't want bean overkill! Also gives me the idea to add tuna to conventional 3-bean salads...

Didn't have a can of white kidney beans so used a can of mixed beans instead. Didn't really measure the ingredients - just put in the amounts I thought I'd like. Amazing results. Don't use sage very often, and never before in a raw state, and I think it tastes great. Used tuna packed in water but drained water really well. Will definitely make again and some of the ideas from all the comments below sound good too: garlic, tomatoes, basil etc.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I added some lemon and cut the sage in half, as recommended by other chefs. It came out wonderful -- fresh taste, nice flavors, and looks nice on a bed of lettuce.

My mother used to prepare a variation of this when I was a child. The main difference between this recipe and ours is that we added plenty of sliced fresh garden tomatoes. Ya just gotta try it!

Delicious! Two deviations: I used Pastene tonno (so much better than regular tuna) and red wine vinegar. I put all but the tuna together the day before to allow the flavors to sink in to the beans. The morning before I served the dish, I added the tonno and served the mixture over a bed of greens (mesclun mix). I drizzled a bit of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar onto each salad and served. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this salad for 50 of my friends in my kayaking club, and everyone raves about it. I have made it for our clambake, and also for our annual meeting, and every time it is finished. I also serve it with about 7 loafs of bread, namely whole wheat, and semolina. Fantastic salad, especially with sage, my favorite herb. Thanks.

Very easy to make for a quick lunch but I agree with the reviewer who said that it's not party food -- it was a little mushy and not that pretty. But after a night in the fridge the flavors melded very nicely. I threw in a little celery for crunch. Yum.

We made this at night for lunch the next day. Maybe the trick is to eat it right away? The vinegar and fresh sage completely overwhelmed the dish, and it was inedible! For us, this was a one, but if the flavors hadn't settled so much, I can see how it would be a 2. Nothing special.

This exceeded all my expectations for a tuna recipe. It was so great, I love how light it is. Plus, it's pretty typical stuff that you might have on hand anyhow.

I have made this several times now. I use the Albacore tuna, increase the amount of olive oil and use balsamic vinegar. Great for a light dinner.

This was excellent for lunch. I made it on the spur of the moment. Since I had only a 20.35 oz jar of white beans, I used 2 6 oz cans of tuna (one in olive oil and one in water). Although the proportions were not as stated in the recipe, it turned out ecellent. I also added two cloves of minced garlic and used basil instead of sage. I'll try sage next time.

I have made several white bean and tuna recipes over the years and this one is just perfect! I may have gone a little lighter on the sage than specified, but otherwise didn't change a thing. A perfect balance. I'm sure most epicurious people know this, but it is very important in this recipe to use tuna in oil, preferably Italian. The first time I went to make this dish I used albacore (which I generally prefer for sandwiches), and it just was not right. A world of difference!

I make this all the time. Love it.

Similar to one of my lunchtime staples, only I use lemon juice, shallots and fresh basil for the vinegar, onion and sage, respectively. I tried it following this recipe and it's just as good. One of my favorite bruschetta toppings.

Rating: 3
This dish is similar to ones found in many old Italian cookbooks. I make this often, but have to admit that this recipe omits something vital to me - GARLIC! It makes it more colorful to serve it inside a seasoned tomato cut almost all the way through into wedges. I've also added cooked green beans to the main mixture. Basil substitutes well for the sage, if that's what you prefer. The other cooks are right - the ingredients need to be good quality (esp. the tuna).

Definitely very easy and a better than average tuna salad. However, it is not party food.

My husband and I are not big bean eaters. I made this recipe just from the reviews it got. It was very good, surprisingly so. I used quality white tuna and a very good extra-virgin olive oil. It was easy to make. I served it to company as an amuse course before eating our dinner, everyone really enjoyed it.

Rating: 3
Loved it! Made it with fresh sage and Chianti vinegar. I'll never go back to plain mayo and celery! So easy, too.

Rating: 3
I think this recipe stands or falls on the quality of the ingredients. The cook from Oxford, UK, certainly has a point. We made it with fresh herbs from my herb garden, really good canned tuna & an excellent, extra-virgin olive oil. Although not 'out of this world', it was quick, healthy & very tasty. We served it with good crusty bread & a glass of white wine.

The best thing this recipe has going for it is that it is extremely fast and easy to make. I found it bland and not at all special. I would not make it again as a main course, or as a starter, but it might be okay at a BBQ or picnic.

I did not actually make this recipe but a very good friend of mine made it and brought it over for a BBQ. I thought it was GREAT! The oil in the recipe doesn't allow for good leftovers but we didn't have to worry about much! It went quick. The recipe may sound wierd but it tastes great. Looking forward to making it myself.

I'm usually wary around tuna, but this was very good. I let it sit overnight and the flavors soaked into the beans beautifully. It will probably become a staple around here...

This receipe really surprised me.. I don't normally like anything with beans in it..but my husband made it and convinced me to try some! It's wonderful -very filling - and easy!

This salad meets all of my requirements for a great impromptu summer supper. Definitely use fresh sage if you can, and stick with the red wine vinegar. I didn't have parsley, so I used fresh sorrel from my garden instead. Also, I slightly increased the amount of olive oil and vinegar, and served it on a bed of baby greens. Beautiful.

Delicious! I made it in my sons restaurant, great for people who are not able to eat mayo. Tried balsamic vinegar, doesn't go well and makes tuna look very dark. I added diced carrots for color.

An interesting concept, though somewhat boring. Next time I will use fresh tuna loin seared to MR. Garlic and perhaps balsamic vinegar would almost certainly add more complexity to the dish. Toasted french bread rubbed with fresh garlic and butter is the perfect side.
