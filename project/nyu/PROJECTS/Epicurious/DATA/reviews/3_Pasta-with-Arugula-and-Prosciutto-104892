The arugula is a little bitter, so I doubled the prosciutto. I think I would triple or quadruple the prosciutto to balance the arugula.

Made it for dinner last night... Everyone loved it. Fantastic resipe, I did add a little extra lemon juice to enhance the flavor.

This is a simple recipe perfect for a quick weekday meal. As others have mentioned, quality ingredients are key. Our family preferred the addition of lemon juice to provide some nice acid.

I used baby arugula, added some halved grape tomatoes and followed the recs in here to sauté some garlic and red pepper flakes ... DELISH! To make sure that the arugula gets wilted, place the arugula, prosciutto, lemon peel and any other mix-ins in the bottom of a bowl. Then put the steaming hot pasta on top. Let sit for a few minutes before tossing. If pasta is too dry, add a few drops of lemon juice.

This is one of those simple, lovely Italian pastas that only require the best of ingredients. We just returned from Italy and so I was able to use parmigiano and olive oil that we brought back...I think the quality of the ingredients make the difference. I used organic arugula and imported prosciutto as well...and I didn't use as much of any ingredient as was called for, except the pasta.

This pasta was awesome! It was so easy. Before I tossed the pasta, I sauteed some garlic & red pepper flakes. I didn't use all the arugula it calls for because we didn't have that much in our family garden. Also, I'm not too crazy for lemon in pasta so instead of zest, I just did a couple drops of lemon juice. It's a yummy last minute dinner or sunday brunch! I'm so making this again!

This gets an "A" for easy, but, taking my cue from Vancouver and others, tweaked it a bit: sauteed some crushed red pepper and garlic, added grape tomatoes and pine nuts. I also pre-wilted the arugula, but found it quite sharp. The pine nuts and tomatoes softened it to make it more palatable.

This was not a stunning dish. It was edible but the combination of arugula, lemon zest and proscuitto is just okay. From the number of recommendations I was hoping for some very wonderful combination of flavors and got only okay. I will be using my proscuitto and arugula in a better deserving dish.

Yeech. The arugula was just too bitter in this combination. I'll keep my pesto basil from now on.

I started this recipe by sauteing some thinly sliced garlic in olive oil with red pepper flakes, and adding the proscuitto to crisp up, and then added the arugula to wilt. It was a good dish, but I added chicken broth to loosen up the sauce and would not recommend it; add the pasta water instead, because the chicken broth, with the proscuitto, AND the cheese made the dish too salty. All in all a good dish, and quick to make.

delicious, easy, quick. we found that the argula wilted nicely. add the proscuitto last as it cooked a little. we used piave instead of reg. parm. added pinenuts too, excellent.

I loved this very simple and quick recipe. The arugula doesn't wilt much, but I prefer it that way along with the uncooked proscuitto. I think the flavors are better that way. The lemon adds a nice zip. A very good olive is essential for the best taste.

I'm 13 and made this dish for my parents anniversary. My family and i were pleased. I thought that the combination of lemon zest and parmesan cheese didn't go well together. If i make it again i will add some chicken broth and get rid of the lemon ze. overall it was good! (recommendation from my little sister is to have no arugala for kids)

I changed the recipe a bit, but adding carmelized onions and chopped roma tomato. I also eliminated the lemon zest. Another option to using Parmesan is to use shredded Pecorino.

This was a fabulous dish for company! Fast and easy, leaving me plenty of time to be social. The arugula didn't wilt as I would have like it to, so next will pan-wilt it slightly as the pasta cooks. Also want to try it replacing the prosciutto with anchiovies and serving it w/pan seared scallops.

I felt the proscuitto got lost amid the lemon and sharp arugula. Still, it was an interesting departure from the usual weeknight fare and so easy to make, I'll probably make it again. I wouldn't make for company, however. My partner liked it more than me, but he's an arugula freak.

Delicious and simple to make. I also added a little garlic. For whatever reason, my arugula didn't wilt very much so next time I might give it a very quick saute first.

This is very, very good and simple. I added some fresh mozzarella, fresh garlic and dried red pepper. Really good - great weeknight recipe!

This is by far one of my husband's (and my!) favorite pasta dishes. I use whole wheat pasta, which helps to enhance the flavor and heartiness of this dish.

Easy and Good! I was surprised that this recipe was so good. It looked a little "dry" on paper. Husband raved and he is a meat eater. Lemon zest makes it along with fresh arugula.

This recipe was great! Simple and tasty. I also added some chopped roasted red bell pepper and a splash of balsamic vinegar for extra flavor.

Very tasty and easy, a great dish for a summer evening. We added some fresh lemon juice, which made the flavor more interesting. Next time I'll the cheese at the table rather than in the pot.

We have an abundance of arugula in our garden so I've been trying all kinds of arugula recipes. I love bitter greens with pasta. I loved all the arugula but my husband agreed with the other reviewers that he would have like it better with less. I didn't like the way the prosciutto turned out in the dish. I think next time I might saute until crisp and use as a garnish. I also didn't use quite as much cheese but had on table for people to use more if they wanted.

Easy for a weeknight dinner -- and a big step up from pasta with sauce from a jar. I used about half the amount of arugula (1/4 lb for 2 people) and it was plenty.

I enjoyed this dish, but my husband didn't care for it much. He added fresh lemon juice and a splash of balsamic vinegar. We also used less arugula than the recipe called for.

I couldn't find arugula in my supermarket so I substituted spinach. It turned out wonderfully. Perfect dinner to make in the warmer weather since there is only the pasta cooking.
