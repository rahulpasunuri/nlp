I have made this recipe several times, and keep coming back to it. This time I doubled the recipe, and therefore cooked the chicken in a separate pan from the vegetables. I poured off the juices from the chicken onto the vegetables part way through cooking. Didn't have potatoes this time, so did without, and cooked a lovely orzo dish on the side. Our guests raved about the flavour of the meal. Even the four kids loved it.

We love this recipe and prepare it regularly. I would disagreed with some of the other comments: I don't think it needs any changes or additions. Delightful as originally written. I would recommend you try it that way first and then change if you want to.

This is so Jacques Pepin, I love it! Herbs de Provence add a lot of savory flavor to the veggies. It's important to know your oven to avoid smoke; I went with 450, and the dish turned out gorgeous.

This is my go to for fast and delicious. I added a slice fennel bulb and some oregano. No problem with smoking and have done it in two pans also. Everyone raves!

Delicious! Mine did not smoke excessively. I added garlic cloves, new potatoes, zucchini. It's a lot of tomato but would be delicious to serve it with crusty bread, toasted, and spread with ricotta, then put the tomatoes on top. I will definitely repeat!

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I think I've actually made it better than the original by testing and tweaking. I've posted my adapted version at ellebeaugrease.blogspot.com

Doubled the recipe because this is a good one to store in the freezer, and cooked the chicken and veggies in separate pans. I agree with another reviewer, the recipe needed some additions to make it more flavorful. I made a lot of substitutions all of which I would keep: First, I used skinless chicken, which of course made it less crispy but it would have been too greasy for me otherwise. Had no fresh tomatoes or sundried, but I used black olives and canned chopped tomatoes. Following another reviewer's tip I added Provance herbs that I had around: lavender, rosemary and thyme (next time would add sage too) as well as diced garlic (about 5 cloves). Also added chopped onions and Parsnips instead of potatoes because I didnt have the latter, but was glad I did because the parsnips added a sweet acidic flavor that deepened the broth - so i'll keep that substitution. Finally deglazed the pans with chardonnay (took pans out and emptied them, then put in a glass of wine each and set them over stove burners to burn off the alcohol). That made the flavor intense. I also flambeed a shot of brandy in the deglazing mixture, which added another level of flavor, but certainly not essential. It was delicious and looks like it will freeze well -- next time I will make more of the broth and serve with bread.

I like this recipe for easy entertaining but it needed work. Shame on Epicurious for omitting 2 key Provencal ingredients: garlic and Herbes de Provence (or some herbs for flavor like basil or oregano.) I also used chicken broth rather than water and a combo of boneless breasts & legs. I garnished with crumbled feta. Very tasty!

Great week night meal. The vegetables do get burnt to a crisp, every time, but for me the smoke hasn't been bad and the taste of the veggies and the chicken is always great. Chicken gets nice and crispy at this temperature. Added zucchini and garlic (in skin, then squeezed out later). Don't skimp on the tomatoes, they each have their own flavor and texture.

This easy, hands off cooking method resulted in perfectly cooked chicken with minimal effort. Yes, reduce the temperature by 50 degrees, but don't pass this luscious low-calorie weeknight one pan gem by!

Unlike other reviewers, I had no trouble with smoking. I did start at a lower temp (375 convection) but gradually increased and ended up at 450. THe chicken was fine, but the vegetables were to die for. I used high quality tomatoes and olives, added some onion and absolutely loved it.

OK, the chicken is delish. BUT..... your neighbors may be calling the fire department if they see the smoke pouring out of your windows. I doubled the recipe and used two different ovens, regular and convection at 25 degrees lower. They both smoked like crazy. It was all I could do to make it through the first two stages. I had to shut them down and remove them a minute or two after tossing on the water. But, by then the chicken was cooked anyway. Maybe this is a summer dish that can be cooked with every window in the house open and a commercial fan running full blast.

VERY smokey--I think the temperature is too high on this recipe. I dropped the temp. by 50 degrees and the vegetables charred and burned before the elapsed time. The chicken was somewhat overcooked before I added the sundried tomatoes and olives. Can't tell you how it tastes yet...too smokey. There are easier recipes for roast chicken!
