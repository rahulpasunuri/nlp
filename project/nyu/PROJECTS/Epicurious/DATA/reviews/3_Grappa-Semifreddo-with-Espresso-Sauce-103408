If you are a true grappa fan (as we are) you will enjoy this as another way to use a favorite spirit. Otherwise we found the semifreddo to be rather bland and the espresso suace while tasty was a bit too much of burnt coffee. While the cook from Sydney's substitution of Irish Cream obviously makes it a different dish, I think any flavorful spirit or liqueur would be nice, as would simple vanilla. I also will not remove the molds from the freezer before serving the next time - the desserts were rather soft and runny.

I have made this dessert five or six times, and have enjoyed it immensely. It is unique and most guests enjoy trying something new--and tasty. Make sure the grappa is ice cold when it is poured over the dessert.

A gorgeous grown-up dessert which can be prepared a week in advance for a special dinner. Couldn't find grappa, so substituted Bailey's Irish Cream, which worked well, and simply poured warm, strong sweetened espresso around the sliced semifreddo at the table. Everyone loved it.
