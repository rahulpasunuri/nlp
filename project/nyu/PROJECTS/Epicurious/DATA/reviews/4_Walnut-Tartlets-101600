These are amazing! The orange and anise flavors go together perfectly. Everyone was stuffed after Easter dinner, but somehow we all made room for these. Make sure you line your baking sheet with parchment paper though - the filling bubbles up during baking, and cleaning it up would have been a chore. With the parchment paper, it peeled off in big, candy-like sheets, which turned out to be delicious.

Wow. I don't even know where to begin. This is a brilliant recipe. I was in complete heaven, as were my guests. Here are my thoughts: each one of these (at the 4.5" pan size) is quite large. For more appropriate individual portions I would look for a 3.5" pan. (I could only finish a half of one and I'm a healthy eater). The amount of filling is a bit generous, so be certain to either make the sides high enough or save a little bit to use with something else (or make an extra half of a tart). I used refrigerated pie crusts (to my chagrin) and they worked perfectly. The beauty of this dish is that the anise cuts the sweetness perfectly, but it (the anise) isn't overwhelming at all. I can't wait to make this again. It is now one of my top 5 dessert recipes. (And incidentally, since it is carb and protein packed, I'll be taking some of the extras with me on a hike tomorrow!).
