This is the perfect fall cake! I'm giving it to a work colleague for her birthday tomorrow morning. I used homemade applesauce in the recipe. I'm going to spoon warmed applesauce to accompany this.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday and we all loved the cake! It was a perfect healthy treat. I adjusted the spices (added more of everything) and also used the maple/molasses glaze. Delicious recipe. I think it would also do well as cupcakes

I heeded others' advice and made a few alterations. I added 1/3 c molasses and upped the spice quantities, plus added cloves and mace. I also substituted a cup of whole wheat flour, just for kicks. (I wanted more of a bread than a cake.) I used pecans instead of walnuts--just personal preference--halved the amount and instead used a cup of raisins. I don't have a bundt pan, so I used two 8 inch loaf pans. All in all, a nice bread (my version is definitely more of a bread than a cake), with a light flavor. It would be a great with cream cheese for breakfast. I'm eager to make muffins with this recipe. A success, but not something to rave about.

I added extra spices also, and my cake took about 65 minutes to bake. I made the maple glaze for the top, and it was GREAT!!! Thanks, TL.

Turned out better then I thought based on other reviews. Everyone at work loved it! I did make a few modifications: Doubled cinnamon, increased other spices to 2 t and added 1/2 t ground cloves as recommended. I also added about 1/4 cup dark molasses (70g) that made it extra delicous. Once it was cool, I created a maple syrup/molasses glaze and drizzled over the top. That recipe was 3T Maple Syrup, 1T Dark Molasses (bring to a boil and boil about 1 minute). Cool 1 minute and add 1 cup powdered sugar (100g) and stir until smooth. Then add about 2T cool butter and beat until smooth. Add a few drops of water if it's not pourable - then drizzle over cool cake.

I really enjoyed making and eating this cake. The spices made the kitchen smell wonderful during baking. To make the cake a little more exciting, I made an apple compote with cardamon and served it hot over slices of cake. Next time I might substitute honey for the brown sugar and have it a la mode.

I made this for my toddler's snack at pre-school. Was looking for something "healthy". I cooked the batter in a jellyroll and sliced it up using heart-shaped cookie cutter, then sprinkled with powder sugar. The cake cooked much faster in the jellyroll (I took it out of the oven after 25 minutes), but I still might have over done it - my cake is a tad dry. Like the other reviewers said - the flavor was a bit bland,I'm curious to see what the toddlers think.

based on the other reviews, I doubled the spices, added 1/4 cup of molasses and the zest of one lemon...really the only difference this made was to deepen the flavor to make this a great cake that I will certainly make again.

I substituted canned pumpkin (15 OZ) for the applesauce and it is a great fall recipe.

Pleasant, but unsatisfying. Easy to mix up with a whisk, fast, and beautiful texture (unmolded perfectly, too). But overall kind of blah--maybe just not my kind of cake.

my family loves this, i add alittle extra applesauce and add cinnamon to the applesauce. i also make honey roasted walnuts and barely chop them. never dry or heavy i dont know what the others are complaining about, imagination is a intricate part of cooking.

This came out moist, tender and fragrant. I accidentally included a teaspoon and a half of cloves to the spices, which ended up making the cake even more flavorful. It made a huge amount of batter, I was able to fill two 8-inch cake pans and a mini-loaf pan. I'm not sure why the other reviewers thought this cake was bland-ish --maybe it had to do with their choice of applesauce? Mine was organic and unsweetened. So far, people have only raved! I'll make this again soon.

A decent cake, but it needed a little oomph. It wasn't spicy enough and it lacked a deep apple flavor, but it would be good for a crowd with mixed tastes.

I just wasn't that impressed, there are better apple spice cake recipes out there. My husband says he likes it, but for some reason it's still sitting on the counter ...

This cake has a wonderful, light texture from the beaten eggs. The crumb is tender, moist, and not dense like other cakes of this nature. The only complaint that I had was that it didn't seem to have a strong apple flavor. Perhaps next time I should start with homemade applesauce, maybe from Macintosh apples or a similar, flavorful variety. The crust tends to harden after a day or so, so make sure to eat or store the cake as specified.
