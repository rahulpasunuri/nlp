Like the others, I think it needs more cod. Double the cod and it is just about right. Just flake the fish after poaching. I get my cod from a local European grocery.

This is a very easy recipe. There could be more cod, but that is to be adjusted according to the cook's preference. I made it as the base for a souffle', and it's perfect. Just add bechamel, and fold it into whipped egg whites.

1/4 pound is not nearly enough salt cod. You need at least a pound. There are much better recipes for brandade.

I made brandade for a dinner party and our guests fell on it with great enthusiasm. I served it warm with melba toast on the side so they could spread as much as they liked onto the toast. I made it several days ahead of time and like the recipe says it didn't suffer at all from this. I decided on tasting it that it needed more salt cod and I had plenty of time to soak more and add it.
