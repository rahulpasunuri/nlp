A very nice dessert. The "snow" looks very nice and is quite neutral with a soft almond taste. The cherries in port were real tasty and visually contrasted beautifully with the snow. A recommended dessert. Also easy to make.

this was a lovely little dessert! Cool, refreshing, and very pretty. i made it at the end of a light dumpling dinner and it was very well-received. it was also super easy to make! i was so nervous when i poured the mixture and put it in the freezer, that it wasn't going to end up looking like the picture, but it really did. i would make again in a pinch.

Interesting recipe ... a little too interesting. My dinner guests were polite.

What a delightfully poetic little dessert. Easy and delicious and wonderful to show off. The cherry port sauce wasn't to sweet, then again I used a regular port instead of a ruby port. I also took the suggestion of using the blender which made the dish have a wonderfully fluffy snow like topping. Really wonderful easy dish with a beautiful presentation and for that I give it 4 forks.

This is a fantastic low-cal, low-fat dessert that is ridiculously easy to make. I made it for my mother's birthday dinner and it tasted and looked great. I'll be making this regularly.

Perfect - just like my favorite childhood dessert - but better! I used the blender though - it makes for faster / more foam!

I tried this recipe on a whim...It was super easy and went over well. The cherries in port were a bit too sweet, but it could have been due to the type of dried cherries I used. Next time I would use either dried sour cherries or less sugar. I would also advise anyone making it that 45 minutes isn't really enough time for it to properly set.

I made this as an ending to sushi night at our Gourmet Club. Everyone liked it and ate their entire portions. I'd make it again.

Good recipe to make when you want "something" after a Chinese meal. Definately not for all tastes, but an interesting Asian-style desert. Very easy to make and can be made way in advance.
