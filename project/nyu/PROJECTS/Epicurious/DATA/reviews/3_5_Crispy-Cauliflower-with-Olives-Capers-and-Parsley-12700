Jennifer a b was spot on with the changes she made in the execution of this recipe. I repeat her note below - the results allow the flavor of the olives and capers to meld with the carmelized cauliflower. Here it is. The high temperature frying (without a lid) should be done for a shorter time to brown the cauliflower, and then the olives, capers (and garlic) with a bit of water should be added, place the lid on. Finally, the oil, vinegar and parsley should be added at the end.

The idea is sound, but I think that the execution is flawed. The flavor of the olives and the capers should permeate the dish. I think that the high temperature frying (without a lid) should be done for a shorter time to brown the cauliflower, and then the olives, capers (and garlic) with a bit of water should be added, the lid on. Finally, the oil, vinegar and parsley should be added at the end. The flavors were good, but not well merged. It was like eating bits of cauliflower with the seasonings added when I made it according to the recipe. Next time, I would try it the way I have outlined.

added roasted red peppers and it made a festive dish for a holiday potluck. parboiled first so could make partially in advance, then roasted at high heat to brown them, then added other ingredients. very good at room temp. can't comment on the amount of capers, olives, and parsley... just added to taste. very good.

Wow, this is a great way to zip up a bland vegetable (tho I love cauliflower anyway). On medium high heat, I had to watch it carefully to prevent burning, and found that it only needs 5 minutes to cook uncovered. Also if you don't have any parsley in the house, it's still good without.

I hate cauliflower, but my weekly delivery of veggies included 2 heads! I tried this recipe and I now am a fan of cauliflower (only using this recipe of course). The fact that it is minimal work is also a nice bonus.

I've made it twice, and both times I doubled the olives and capers. I also used cilantro instead of parsley both times because the supermarket had no parsley. The second time I made it, I added maybe 6 ounces of leftover chicken cut up, and it fed two people well with about 3/4 cup leftovers.

Great mix of flavors and it complements the cauliflower well. Since I can't ever leave a recipe alone, I'm considering increasing the amount of olives, capers, and parsley. I'm also considering adding a couple anchovies.

A disappointment. I didn't like the browned cauliflower taste and it didn't at all match the flavour of the olives and capers.

This recipe was easy and produced a tasty dish. Finally, something to do with cauliflower that doesn't add cheese or breadcrumbs.

I served this with pappardelle with beef ragu, and broiled tomatoes with olives and garlic, and WOW what a great combination! The cauliflower was truly crunchy, and the olives and capers (not surprisingly) complemented each other deliughtfully. This was an easy-to-make, versatile side dish.

This failed to excite. Skillet roasting the cauliflower developed its sweetness, but the olive relish didn't work with it.

this is a good way to make cauliflower more interesting. very easy. i actually threw the olive mixture in at the very end of cooking the cauliflower so that the flavors would get absorbed.

Excellent side dish. Best way I have ever eaten cauliflower! I also doubled the capers and olives. One large head will do for 3 people...plan on seconds!

I used an olive tapenade and saved a step. It was quick, easy, very tasty and didn't have enough for seconds. I will not hesitate to use this recipe often.

A delightful change from the norm. I too doubled the olives and capers. Will definately make again.

Great way to waste a cauliflower. I love this combination of olives, capers, etc., just not with cauliflower.

Following the other readers suggestions I doubled the capers and olives and had a delicious and generous vegetable dish.

Definitely double the olives and capers. Very tasty and a nice change from the classic cauliflower and cheese sauce.

excellent recipe for cauliflower....i used cream, skipped the breadcrumbs and used cheddar instead of fontina (will make with fontina but I didn't have any on hand) and it was still great

If possible I would have given this 3.5 forks. Really yummy side dish. I would recommend doubling to make sure there are leftovers.

Sauteed cauliflower is my favorite way to cook the tasty vegie and this sauce heighten the flavor. It will definitely serve more than two, as described.

I made this as directed and it was pretty good. Next time I would chop the cauliflower into smaller pieces and I would double the amount of olives and capers. As a side dish it will serve more than 2.
