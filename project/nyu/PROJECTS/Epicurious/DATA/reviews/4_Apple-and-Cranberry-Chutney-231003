The roasting makes this! I have made this twice. Once with crabapples and once with Gala. Both are superb. I tried freezing the crabapple, and it didn't last -- mushy and watery. My best results have been within 24 hours of making it. Definitely let it sit and marinate.

This is easy and to my taste has the perfect balance of savory and sweet. Roasting the apples and onions brings out their sweetness much better than chutney recipes that call for simmering on the stovetop.

I really love this chutney. Will be serving with homemade venison sausage for a bbq. Will let you know if it's a hit or not....

Good. I really did get a lot of response from my family on this, so I would probably try something different next time. I did like that it was a touch tart and not overly sweet.

Nice rich flavor -- a little more time-consuming to make than the stove-top version, but really delicious the day it is made. Next day it's a little dry right from the fridge, so you want to bring it to room temp, or heat it up briefly.

I loved this. I forgot to put the orange juice in and it was still great. Looking forward to making it again. It would be delicious on top of baked brie!

Love this recipe - have fixed it every year since it was first published. The savory quality is a much appreciated departure from overly sweet cranberry sauces.

Last night for dessert I had a mug of vanilla yogurt topped with this apply cranberry chutney. It was absolutely scrumptious! www.jennagavula.com http://tinyurl.com/22msgap

No just for Thanksgiving! I've served with chicken but also with baked yams. Absolutely wonderful blend. Make it a day or more ahead and reheat in the oven for 15 minutes or serve at room temperature.

Very good, great as an appetizer with cream cheese on crackers.

This is on its way to being a Thanksgiving regular. It is savory in a very NON-parsley-sage-rosemary-and-thyme way. With this, you almost don't need gravy.

My family actually consented to add a new recipe to the "must make" Thanksgiving menu. This chutney is delicious and is fantastic on turkey sandwiches once the leftover feasts beginl

Excellent! Will be back on our Thanksgiving table next year.

I was expecting this to be sweeter, but it mostly tasted like onions and mustard. Not a keeper for me.

I was expecting something a bit sweeter and less onion-y/mustard-y - this was definitely tangy, and just not very good. Not a keeper for my book.

Tangy and not cloyingly sweet like some chutneys, this is wonderful even as a side dish with pork, warm from the oven or room temperature.
