I made this frosting exactly per the recipe and it was, bar none, the BEST frosting I have ever made! It was thick, glossy, set up beautifully and tasted great. Super easy to make too. Can anyone share some tips on how to change the recipe to make a white icing? What would one replace the cocoa powder with?

My alterations: 8 marshmallows instead of 6 and 1/3 heavy whipping cream (wanted to use it up) instead of 1/3 plus 1 T milk. I had the opposite problem from everyone else. My frosting turned out so thick it was like a dough. I kept adding more and more whipping cream until it was a creamy consistency. In the end though, it was DELICIOUS. I love having a recipe that uses up my hardened marshmallows. It is a tad on the sweet side, even for a sugar addict like me. Will definitely make again though.

I followed the recipe as I should have, but the confectioners sugar came out too much. The flavor was overpowering. The frosting was also very thin. I tried thickening it up by adding more marshmallows, but it was still too thin. I ended up buying store bought, which I hate because of the trans fat.

I used this as a glaze for cupcakes made with the melted ice cream cake mix. I used 8 marshmallows and 3/4 cups of cocoa. I let it cool before dunking in the cupcakes - it was delicious!! Since it is a glaze, though, it is a tad messy. (no one minded - more to lick off the plates...).

I used 7 marshmallows and about 1 3/4 cups of sugar, along with the juice left over from boiling dried cherries for the cake. I let it cool for a while and it flowed over the cake very nicely. The texture was just right and it wasn't too sweet.

After reading the previous reviews I made the following adjustments as I needed a thicker pouring frosting. I increase mashmallows to 10 addeded 2 extra T of butter for a total of 6 and decreased the liquid to 5 T of half and half ( evaporate milk would work well providing extra richness and a thicker constistency). I poured the frosting over the cake on a wire rack and collected the overflow as well as the remaining frosting and beat it until it thickend and lightened for decorating/piping purposes. Delicious and easy!

perfect quick recipe. I made it without the cocoa on top of a chocolate cake. It was out of desperation when I needed a fast frosting. I will make this again! Not bad if you ad a little mint extract as well.

Great tasting, easy to make. Like the previous cooks suggested, I added additional powdered sugar about 3/4 cup to make it thicker. This recipe is a keeper. Yum

Very easy! I would definitely make this again. I used it to glaze a brown sugar bundt cake--delicious! I also substituted mini marshmallows (10 per 1 large) which worked fine, but did take a bit longer than 3-4 minutes to melt. This is a keeper for emergencies...everyone has these ingredients in the cupboard!

Much sweeter than I anticipated. I used it on a chocolate cake and it was a bit much. I'd try it on a yellow cake next time. Make sure you sift the sugar and cocoa...my sifter broke and the frosting was a bit lumpy. It's very easy to make and takes no time to frost the cake...you basically pour it on. As said before, it is more like a thick glaze.

I would use less sugar next time. It was more like a glaze. Everyone loved it.

I had to add another cup of sifted powdered sugar to have a spreadable consistency. Also a dash of salt helps the flavor.
