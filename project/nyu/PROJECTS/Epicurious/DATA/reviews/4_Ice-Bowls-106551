Poogene's comment made me smile. Sadly too many people here are too pretentious and uptight to find time for a little humor in their day!

I think it's great!!! Always looking for more attractive ways to serve simple but great tasting food!!! Now why don't we all do something a little more constructive and actually whip up another awesome epicurious recipe rather than resorting to the childishness I see here.

To the clueless "cook" this is called the art of displaying a chilled dish. My sister who does small catering jobs makes the most beautiful ice bowls. She uses many different types of greens as well as a color ( cranberry or some other type of berry). So use this ice bowl to keep your cold food cold and beautifully displayed during the warm weather.
