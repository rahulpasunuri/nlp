So easy and very good. No kahlua so used Grand Marnier and it was great.

Chocolate lovers will loved this, served with whipped cream on the side, since the cake is very dense and needed something to cut it.

amazing cake...one of our favorites! My only tip: use butter to grease the pan or it will stick.

Really excellent! Great for a crowd. I was afraid it might taste like a cake mix but not at all. The liqueurs make it wonderful. I poked holes in the cake when adding the orange glaze which help it sink into the cake,

Yowza! So moist! I made it in a 10x3 round and just kept my eye on it to make sure it baked long enough. Took a little over an hour, I think. Also, I poked a bunch of holes into the cake to encourage the syrup to stop running off the sides and pooling underneath. It's a lot of syrup. You could probably use half and still have a super-moist, delicious and subtly orange-flavored cake. Everyone loved it!

One of the moistest and best cakes I have ever had the pleasure of making. This one is such a keeper!

This was so good that I made three of these cakes in a 1-week period for several events. And there wasn't a crumb left! Definitely a keeper!

My friend made this for my birthday, & I swear, it was the best cake I ever had! A real treat!!!

I made this for a friend's birthday. She loved it, so I made it this time for my husband's birthday. We thought it was simply the best chocolate cake we'd ever had. Easy to follow recipe. The orange flavor went so well with the chocolate. I took a little more time in pouring the syrup, letting the cake absorb it before adding more. Definitely a keeper.

The cake mix taste and texture are well disguised in this recipe and it's really worth making and eating. Use really good chocolate (guittard extra is perfect) and add a bit of orange extract to both cake and glaze and use strong coffee instead of the coffee liquer.

I followed recipe and used a 10 cup bundt pan and the cake spilled all over the oven. What did I do wrong?

I have been making this recipe since the March 1991 issue of Bon Appetit came out. I have had this as my birthday cake for many years and have sold thousands of cakes, everyone loves it!! Highly Recomended

Has anybody tried this recipe using regular 9" cake pans instead of a Bundt pan? Would like to know it it would work in this way.

This was very, very good and easy, and I received rave reviews even when I served the letters 4 or 5 days later-stayed incredibly moist. I made some substitutions (partly to accomodate a friend's diet)-used yogurt and egg beaters to sub for sour cream and eggs. I also forgot the 1/2 cup of oil and it was still incredibly moist. I added extra orange zest to the syrup, and used oj instead of coffee as my friend hates coffee. Fantastic!

Wonderful. Made with a few times varying according to mood and items on hand. Very clever to use a cake mix. Still cooking from scratch as far as I am concerned.

Perfect! But add orange extact to batter. To many compliments.... Loved it too.....

Am I the only one who is really annoyed about finding a cake-mix as part of this recipe? I'm seeing this more and more on this website. It's fine to offer it as an alternative for those who don't want to do the whole from-scratch thing, but there are some of us who prefer controlling the quality of ingredients by NOT using mixes.

I made this cake for the first time last nite for my boss's birthday today and followed the recipe exactly. I Did not feel, as others did, that there was too much syrup...just poured it on the hot "right-out-of-the-oven" cake and watched the cake absorb it all. Cooled 1/2 hour and it literally slipped from the pan. The aromas wafting up from this cake were unbelievable. The cake received raves. I love the Epicurious site and have had many, many compliments on dishes/desserts/misc. that have come from here. KUDOS and keep those recipes coming.

I made this for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it. As others suggested, I substituted coffee for water, grand marnier for coffee liquor and added a teaspoon of espresso powder. I also made a chocolate drip topping with grand marnier, espresso and cocoa powder.

So easy! But also delicious and impressively rich. I don't think anyone would have guessed it was box cake (but I love that about it). I made it for a new year's eve dinner party and everyone had multiple slices (of course, over a few hours because it's pretty intense). I made just as directed but did let the cake cool for an hour before removing it from the pan - no troubles whatsoever!

Simply divine!!

Good, but it's still clearly a cake-mix cake. I'd like a stronger orange flavor, so the orange extract idea sounds good. Regarding the syrup, I recommend using a larger saucepan so it won't boil over! The syrup also is too sweet, even after being absorbed into the cake. I also recommend halving the syrup. After pouring as much as possible on top of the cake in the pan, there was so much left over that after inverting the cake onto a wire rack, I poured more syrup on the rest of the cake. There still was too much! BTW, I had no trouble removing the cake from the pan, and I didn't even wait the full 30 minutes.

This is a great special occasion cake. I like the one-bowl preparation. I recommend letting the cake cooler closer to an hour before removing it from the bundt pan to avoid it sticking to the pan.

This recipe is wonderful. I made to alterations; exchanging orange extract for the orange liqueur (to taste) and I also added crystalized ginger. I took it to a dinner party and it was a huge success!

This was wonderful! I forgot to buy coffee liqueur, and had to use Irish cream instead, but it was fine (although the coffee liqueur probably would have been a little bit better). I might try just using straight coffee rather than either of these to cut down the sweetness a bit next time. I'm absolutely amazed at how moist this is! I've never eaten such a moist cake in my life. My husband thought I was crazy when I started to pour the butter mixture over it, but he understood as soon as he took a bite. This would be a fun recipe to try variations on - Chambord instead of Grand Marnier comes to mind. It's easy enough to make and creates little enough mess that making it frequently in order to tweak and personalize it would be completely feasible.

I made this the night before for a luncheon. I did not use all of the sauce because it seemed like too much, but I may use it all next time because I thought it was very good. Otherwise, I made the cake accordingly to the recipe. The only thing I would change next time would be using half-and-half white and chocolate chips, as some other cooks suggested, and/or different garnish options.

Rating: 4
I'm giving this a 4 because my "tasters" went bonkers over it though I personally thought it was too sweet. If I made it again, I would half the syrup. I loved the chocolate flavor. The texture was interesting because the chocolate chips melted and stayed gooey rather than hardening up when the cake cooled like they do in most cookies. I thought it was very easy to make. The box mix cuts a few steps. My tasters had NO idea the base was from a box.

I'm only holding off on giving this cake a "4" rating because I had trouble getting it out of the pan. That was probably my fault; I think it would've made more sense to wait more than the 30 minutes after pouring the syrup on to get the cake out of the pan. This is a VERY moist, dense cake, almost like it's not fully baked in the middle (although mine was). I used all the syrup (which I loved!) and took other reviewer's advice and added 1 tsp. orange extract to the cake batter and used a half-and-half mixture of white chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips. Also, I didn't have sour cream, so I used a cup of plain nonfat yogurt, which worked just fine. (Honestly, I can't imagine this cake being any richer than it was!) This is one fantastic cake, and about as dark as it could be. I garnished my cake with curls of orange peel and plenty of confectioner's sugar.

You've got to love the flavor of chocolate and orange but if you do this is a wonderful cake and very easy as well. I used only half the amount of syrup and added about a tsp of orange extract to the cake. I also used a combination of white and dark chocolate pieces and that added a nice contrast.

Rating: 3
I loved this cake, as did the crowd of chocolate lovers I presented it to. I followed one cook's advice and dipped a bunch of orange sections in melted chocolate, which I used to decorate and serve with the cake. I didn't pour all of the butter/sugar/orange liqueur mixture on the cake as it just seemed too rich. It's a very moist cake, so I baked it a bit longer and tented it with aluminum foil when the outside edge was looking more done than the center of the cake. A big hit and pretty foolproof!

I really wanted something chocolate for Thanksgiving and this had such great reviews I had to try it. I have to admit though that it tasted like a box cake and I couldn't get past that. If I am going to go to all that work I might as well make something completely from scratch.

Rating: 3
This cake is wonderful! I made it for a Grey Cup (Canadian SuperBowl) party and it got raves. However, it was cooked after 45 minutes, so check it before the hour is up. I added a chocolate glaze and chocolate dipped oranges to make it look a little more special. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
This is sooo good! The cake is rich and gooey and the orange flavor is strong enough to not be overpowered by the intense chocolate. The hardest part of the recipe is grating the orange peel - it's clear skies after that. Next time I will try drizzling with a chocolate sauce to make it look as decadent as it tastes. Without it, it does look like a plain old bundt cake.

I made this for a gathering and it was a huge hit. As suggested by someone else, I used coffee instead of water. I even forgot to add the chocolate chips, but it was still great. I plan to make it again this weekend with the chocolate.

We really liked this, but it seemed almost wet and a little soggy. I think I might not use so much sauce next time. I used orange juice instead of the liquors and forgot the chocolate chips so will probably be even better next time.

Made this yesterday with the suggestions of using only the orange liquor for the topping and only 1/2 cup of chips. I hate to admit it but there is nothing left of the cake since we ate it all!

I have been serving this dessert since 1991 and always receive requests for the recipe. It is wonderful!

This was a great recipe. Everyone at Thanksgiving loved it! The second time I made this I omitted the sugar/butter sauce and just used the orange liqueur(1/4 cup). Prior to serving I drizzled this with a chocolate-orange sauce. Everyone who tasted both variations loved the latter hands down.

Rating: 4
I followed the advise of one of the previous reviewers and added a half cup of chips. I also baked the cake in a non-stick 9" x 13" pan (sprayed with Pam). This cake was absolutely delicious and only gets better with age. We will definitely be making this cake for the Christmas holidays!!

This cake is super simple and very delicious. But omit the butter/sugar syrup or substitute a little Gran Marnier. Also, any time a chocolate recipe calls for water, substitute coffee - it enhances the flavor. I also only put in about 1/2 cup of chips.

A must for any chocaholic's recipe box! I was very reluctant about the packaged ingredients when I first read the recipe; however, it's definitely worth doing again and again and is now a favourite at our house for birthdays.

My family just loves this cake! I think it could do without the chocolate chips and still be good. You only need a small slice... it's deadly!! :)
