This was nice. The sauce was much more mild than I thought it would be--almost sweet. I would have liked a little more oomph. My children loved it.

I took the skin off the chicken and it cooked perfectly. I would not conserve the vegetables as another cook suggested as they were a bit vinegary. The sauce was lovely. I upped the fresh thyme and carrot, otherwise it's as written. I forgot the finishing butter and didnt miss it.

OK so I didn't make this chicken. I made Beer can chicken using hard cider. BUT I did make the vinegar sauce to accompany the chicken and man is it amazing! I have had other chefs vinegar sauce before and this is amazing! Word to the wise: don't skip the reduction. I Did use 2Tbs of Alder smoked beef tallow instead of butter in the beginning but used butter on the finish. So Tasty!

Don't you love it when some writes, "This isn't very good. Of course, I didn't follow the recipe...." It's a bit time consuming, but not all that difficult. The results are very well worth the time and effort.

I made this recipe last night with rice and cannot say enough about it. Absolutely incredible flavor with this dish. Easy to make and prep ahead of time. I removed the skin from legs and thighs and it was perfect. Its definately going to be a regular sunday dinner in our house.

This was phenom... followed the recipe as accurately as possible and from the first bite, my guests had that look of ecstasy in their faces. I found the last part of the recipe a little confusing (the part about straining the sauce through a sieve than discarding solids - are you actually supposed to discard all the onions and carrots? Couldn't bring myself to do that, so I stirred them in with rice to serve the chicken on and they were great.) Will definitely make again.

I couldn't "envision" what this recipe would taste like and I was pleasantly surprised. My husband loved it, too - we both thought it had a wonderful depth of flavor, especially considering it did not take long to make. We think this sauce would be great on lamb, pork or duck, as well.

Followed the recipe, with the exception of the fresh thyme. Was fantastic and leftovers were great. Served with egg noodles. Yum.

Despite the simplistic name of this recipe it may be the best Chicken vinegar recipe I have ever found. It was very well received by my patrons and I found the flavor4 to be exquisite. I used franzia blush wine for the reduction but otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Thank you to the contributer for this great classic. - Chef David

Really good and easy....I used 3 large chicken breasts with skins and bones still on and fresh thyme. I served it with Baked potatoes and put some of the sauce on the potatoes as well. Nothing left over...

Made this at a Thanksgiving dinner for two and will be repeating again this week--easy, delicious, and the sauce tastes amazing on everything!!

After reading these reviews, I'm wondering what I did wrong. I used boneless chicken breasts, but did not reduce the sauce recipe. It seemed like a lot of steps and effort for the end result. It was good, but not great, and I have a similar recipe with less steps that I'll make next time instead.

So good that my husband thinks I can cook now. Am tempted to do it every night.

Quite scrumptious, and not as difficult as you might think. I was making it for only 2, so I used boneless chicken breasts, but did not halve the sauce recipe. I used dried herbs, as well. In the end, I put the chicken under the broiler to finish it off. I also flipped the breasts over a few times during cooking, so they could absorb more of the sauce. Delicious served over rice.

Delicious! Relatively simple to make. I am not used to working with an entire chicken. It was relatively simple and the recipe is easy to follow. Overall a great recipe and delicious to boot. I made it with the yellow rice also on this site.

Delicious and quite easy. We skipped the chicken broth and therefore cut the sugar in half. We also needed to use dry thyme as fresh was not on hand. We'll make this over and over as these ingredients are usually in the house. Everyone enjoyed and wished for more, even my two-year old.
