Most tart pans are smaller, and you really need the larger size for this to come out right. It's a really lovely springtime first course - everyone asked for seconds. I like the balance of flavors, and my concern about other reviewers' idea of adding more cheese is that it would overpower the delicate asparagus. My only other suggestion is to top the tart with the asparagus tips at the point when the oven temperature goes down to keep them crisp.

Leeks instead of scallions. Added extra crumbled cheese and some left over capsicums - yummy. Used nice salty creamy goats cheese which I think is a must. Kids and hubby loved it!

I didn't care for this dish as described, but more goat cheese (at least half more), chopped sundried tomatoes, and longer cooking time to properly set made it more palatable to me.

THis wasn't a great thing to try in my family since my 2 younger kids don't like goat cheese. But I had a lot open and wanted to try using it rather than tossing it. I prepared the filling the day before, so i could come home from work, roll out the dough, and pop the thing in the oven. After the requisite 23 minutes, it wasn't quite browned on top, but it was late, so i served it. Big mistake. THe crust on the bottom was totally underbaked, and quite disgusting, even for me who eats just about anything that doesn't move. I baked it again for about another 25 minutes, and it browned nicely, but I had already lost my audience. My youngest complained about the tarragon. Yes, the tart is quite timid, but I think this might work for a more 'sophisticated' crowd, or at least one that will eat goat cheese and asparagus. I really recommend baking it for longer than the suggested time.

This was fine, nothing amazing. I had extra goat cheese so I dropped it in 1/2-1 tsp. dolops around the top before baking, it was a nice texture contrast. I also skipped the extra step of steaming the asparagus, and just sauteed it for a minute before adding the scalions. I will probably make it again, am always on the lookout for more ways to use asparagus.

So easy, so good. Everyone raved. Couldn't find the bottom to my tart pan, so just placed the rim on a cookie sheet before putting the pastry in - it worked perfectly. Next time i may try a dash of cayenne. Would advise everyone to prick the tart shell with a fork before filling - it bubbled up a little halfway through baking. The tart needed a bit longer to set, also.

It was a little bland for my taste. It was fine, but a lot of work for something that was just okay.

This was very good--the second time around... Mistakes: I couldn't find my 11" round pan, so I used a 12 X 4 rectangular one. I didn't cover the decorative asparagus well enough with the custard and it shriveled in the oven. The puff pastry didn't cook completely before the asparagus crispified, so I served it as-is. There were plenty of left-overs and I was disappointed Redemption: The next day I gave it another whack; I put the left over tart on an oven-proof plate, removed the top asparagus, and cooked it until the crust was done. Yay! It was very, VERY good. My advice: Make sure to cover nearly all of the asparagus, cook it in the right pan, and don't serve it until the pastry is done! --oh yeah, and add some crumbled bacon if you eat meat!

I made this for dinner last week - it was very good. The asparagus was crisp and the cheese was creamy. I used chives instead of scallions. I had to bake it longer than the recipe directed in order to set the custard. Overall a very nice dish.

I sauteed some garlic with the scallions. It was tasty, but perhaps it overshadowed some of the goat cheese flavor. Still, it's a good spring recipe.

when asparagus are in season this is a laovely addition to the repetoire. The recipe is straight forward to prepare and the result was quite delicious. One change: I used a larger amount of goat cheese, probably almost double the amount called for.
