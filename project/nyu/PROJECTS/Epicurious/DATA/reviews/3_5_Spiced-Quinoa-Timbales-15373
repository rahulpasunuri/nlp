Very good yet simple dish. The only change I made was dried cranberries instead of raisins/currants because it is what I had on hand. Definitely a dish I will make again!

I have to say that trying to do thisa recipe with risotto is not anywhere near the truth. This is directed to cornelljim in Buffalo Quinoa will probably not be in your local Supermarket, please check a health food store or a natural foods store. Very easy to find. Use a bit of cinnamon nutmeg some raisins or currants. Use any recipe that is based on couscous as the tecxture will be similar.Hope this helps

We prepared this for friends last eve, with a twist. Finding the quinoa proved impossible, so given that our crowd were traditional italian hearty eaters, we used a prepackaged boxed rissoto we had on hand as substitute. Shallots were used vs onions, and we doubled the currants, cuman, tumeric and cinnamon. After the dish was simmered to the right texture, there seemed to be something missing. We added 5 oz of pine nuts, let the dish sit for 10 minutes (didnt want the pine nuts to get lost in the flavors or textures) and served. The response from all was exubriant. This one will become a permanent dish in our repetoire! One observation is that we cooked the rissoto 1st until about 3/4 done. Then we added it to the mix and let it finish cooking to texture to take on some of the flavors from the seasoning and firm up the mixture.

This was a surprisingly hearty meal, my husband prclaimed it "Excellent!" I used red quinoa and let it simmer a bit longer than the recipe suggested, that took care of the extra liquid. Also, the meal I was planning had more of a European than Moroccan flavor so I sauteed 1/3 cup minced mushrooms with 1 Tbs shallot (instead of the currants) and used marjoram and black pepper instead of the turmeric, cinnamon and cumin. Finally I sprinkled a bit of parmesan in the bottom of the timbale cups. This recipe handles substitutions well and I'll definitely make it again!

too much liquid for the quinoa and found the amt of spice too strong for the delicate flavour of quinoa- a disappointment

This is a great recipe! We made it last night for a vegan friend, so I used veggie broth instead of chicken. Also, substituted leeks for onions and cranberries for raisins. Great flavor; compliments other dishes well. As for the debate below: rinsing quinoa prior to cooking is a matter of personal taste. Yes, it tends to be lighter and fluffier if you wash it first. My personal preference is a nutty flavor, so I don't rinse it and I do toast it (a minute in the pan with the oil before adding water/stock).

First time for quinoa, but it won't be our last. Great taste and better than cous cous.

Wonderful! I didn't bother to put into timbales, just served it as a side dish with morrocan chicken. yum.

I have been preparing this dish long previous to seeing the recipe here. Try garam masala instead of cumin for a middle-eastern impact. Or just add fresh crushed coriander along with the cumin. Also, a handful of toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds are pleasing here. Finally, dried cranberries are a must!!!

I made this using couscous and it was wonderful. Best when hot, but still good warm. East and foolproof.

A very good dish, however you should feel free to add more raisins and tomatoes if you prefer. Dry roasting the quinoa in a pan is a great way to add flavor (thanks Tim!), and don't fuss with the molds if it isn't your thing.

Not bad. There's a world of additions one can make to this! A note to the reader who didn't rinse... Quinoa really needs to be rinsed - not for cooking ease, but to remove bitterness. Also, quinoa is better dry-toasted in a frying pan, then rinsed. Try it!

Easy to make. I added more onion and more tomatoes. Good the first day. Better the next.

This dish seems to have a north African influence and is exceptionally easy to make. I skipped making the molds and served as a side dish with grilled chicken. I also skipped rinsing the grain as it cooks well enough without this step (and I do not own a small enough sieve.

Just a note to the reviewer below (I haven't made this yet): I just came from the foodtv.com site and there is a recipe for a quinoa dessert, similar to rice pudding...

Excellent ! I love this grain/seed and can't cook with it enough. I am also looking for a Quinoa dessert recipe.
