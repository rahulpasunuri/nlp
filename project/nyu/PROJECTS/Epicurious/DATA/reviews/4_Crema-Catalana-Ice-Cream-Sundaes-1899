Great flavor, just keep in mind that it is quite sweet and VERY rich.

I made only the ice cream part of this recipe. It is delicious. The only change I made is that I added a little vanilla bean as well as the vanilla extract. I have made this ice cream twice, and both times when I added the cream to the boiling sugar and water mixture, I ended up with a big lump of candy in the pot. I mention this because if it happens to you, don't panic. Just keep whisking and it will dissolve.

I made the ice cream but not the sauce (based on the previous reviewer's comments). This was my first ice cream attempt, and no one was disappointed. This is a very rich recipe. I'll make it again. I think you could reduce the sugar a bit, although it's great as is. Served this with the caramel sauce from Rose Levy Beranbaum's Pie & Pastry Bible (recipe can be found on this site)

The ice cream was incredible. Rich and flavorful. The caramel topping was not as good. I would replace with a dry caramel sprinkled over the top in the future. The only thing I might add to the ice cream is lemon flavoring from the rind to make it taste a bit more like the dessert
