And so begins my love affair with sunchokes. I veganized the recipe on account of a dining partner, using Earth Balance instead of butter. And it still gets 4 forks. Simple and delicious!

Definitely had to buy this before going home. I don't think the local store would know what sunchokes are let alone carry them. Panguitch is a town of about 1,000 peopel Didn't to the cooking water as a thinner as our Valentine's dinner is always decadent. Put in butter and cream instead. Only thing I would do differently for this would be either starting the sunchokes about ten minutes earlier or just doing the whole thing ten minutes longer which I'm not a fan of. Also squeezed a lemon in the mix as I decided that every dish would have lemon in it. My little easter egg. Very good as fixed. Probably very good as written.

This was very very good and extremely easy to make -- used 1% milk in place of water and chives from our garden -- the sunchokes add a great depth to the flavor of the potatoes

This is a great stand in for the same old mashed potatoes. I leave the skins on my potatoes for a little extra texture, and a little pepper for more flavor.

I really liked the texture and nuttiness the jerusalem artichokes added to the mashed potatoes. Served this as a side for pan-seared turbot topped with melted leeks. Gave this 3 stars as I tweaked the recipe by using milk instead of water and adding scallions as suggested below.

I've never cooked with sunchokes before, but now I'm a fan. The artichoke taste is a welcome addition to the basic mashed potato recipe.

Ok - but watery. Use only a little of the cooking liquid. Needs something to finish - like scallions.
