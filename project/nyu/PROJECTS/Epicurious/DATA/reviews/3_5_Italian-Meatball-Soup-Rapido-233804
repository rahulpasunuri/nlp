I LOVE this recipe. I have made it for many groups and its always a winner. Key modifications: use orzo instead of beans (must add more liquid), add can of tomato paste, and add dried Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme) to make this an amazing dish that is delish and comforting. Turkey meatballs are just as good if you want to cut the fat.

I used Aidell's caramelized onion chicken meatballs and added a pinch of fennel seed to the broth to make it more "Italian." Fresh basil to finish. Very nice, comforting, easy mid-week dinner. I too am a meatball snob and have always made my own, but I threw these in the cart after a grocery store tasting. They were delicious in this easy, go-to soup.

I followed the recipe other than making my favorite homemade turkey meatballs rather than using frozen meatballs and also used fresh rather than frozen onions. My husband and I found it very hearty and satisfying. We had lots of leftovers and I even brought some to a sick friend who thought it hit the spot! This is a great weeknight recipe!

This recipe is easy even when you make it from scratch. I make a big pot and freeze the soup in pints.

I agree with other reviewers. This soup is a great base to start with. I add kale instead of spinach. It tends to hold up longer and the flavor is very good. Conversions are easy. I made a vegan version with veggie broth, a variety of mushrooms and lots of fresh herbs to round out the flavor. Huge compliments all around. I'll try the homemade chicken meatballs next time.

This is a great base recipe to then 'gussy' up with what's available in your kitchen that week. For me that meant using beef broth, adding a cup of red wine, tossing in a bay leaf, oregano, thyme, sage and cayenne pepper. I also added some gluten free pasta to make it more substantial. Overall, it came out yummy and I suspect will be even more flavorful tomorrow. And of course, like other reviewers mentioned super easy for a week night.

Great "refrigerator" soup - good for getting rid of what's in the vegetable drawers or in my case what needs to be used up from the garden. Stuck to the basic recipe, making mini meatballs from mild italian sausage. Used 8 cups homemade chicken stock from the freezer. Didn't have spinach so added chopped green beans the last 5 min. of cooking and sauteed zucchini & lots of chopped parsley. Even 2 picky 7 year old boys enjoyed this with some crusty baguette.

I thought this was good but not excellent. I used fresh onion (obviously) and tiny chicken meatballs that I had made a few weeks ago and froze. I also used mostly stock with just a bit of water bc I ran out of stock. Still thought the flavor was lacking--maybe I under-salted. All in all, a nice, quick, satisfying dinner. Would make again with chipotle or pistou.

Don't buy the frozen meatballs because the flavor will NOT be as good as home cooked mini meatballs. (if you make them, the smaller the better)I add more cheese at the end because most of it will stick to the side of your pot. This is a great hit with my teenagers, one of which is vegetarian so we skip the meatballs for her and use vegetable broth.

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used the Meatballs with Parsley and Parmesan recipe for this, only I made those meatballs with ground turkey. I found this soup delicious and quite filling. To dailyoddball from Canada, I think the frozen spinach may have been your problem. Did you use the whole bag? If so, try using half next time. I'm looking forward to the leftovers for dinner tonight.

I must have done something wrong..I followed the recipe except I used frozen spinach instead and I think it overpowered all the other flavours.Any ideas as everyone else loved it?

Quick and tasty, and converts nicely to a vegetarian dish for the non-meat-eaters among us. I used fresh onion, three each carrots and celery stalks, and frozen spinach. Added some basil, oregano, a bay leaf and a dash of cayenne. Used veggie stock, no water, and Trader Joe's soy meatballs baked in the oven then added just before serving. Went nicely with artisan olive bread. Even better the next day!

I used 2/3 cup orzo instead of beans and homemade Meatballs with Parsley and Parmesean(June 1996)rather than store bought. This soup was delicious. The true test was when my 18yr old son said "This is unreal Mom". I am thinking of adding this to my Christmas Eve menu as a choice for those who do not like seafood chowder. Thanks epicurious...another success!!

This was great for our family, including boys 7, 5, & 1yr. Quick and easy, great with parmesan foccacia for dipping. My only change was to add about 1/3 lb of orzo, which I thought it would have been missing something without. Will make this again!

I make soup several times a week, and this is my new favorite. I added 1 1/2 cups of rice, making an already hearty soup even heartier. So wonderful and so easy!

Remember 2 forks means "good", and it was good, fast, and simple. It was a different way to use some of the frozen meatballs I get from Costco. They really are a great convenience food. I didn't feel that the cheese was necessary in the soup. I think it would have been better melted on toast and served on the side.

This was very tasty and extremely easy to make! It's a keeper!

Very good! I used a little extra celery and carrots, also freshly grated parmesan because I couldn't find the cheese called for. I didn't use much salt because the meatballs were already seasoned well. Will definitely make this again!

I really liked this recipe. However, I only used 1 quart of stock and did not add any additional liquid. I added 1 teaspoon of thyme, 2 bay leaves, and 1 small can of tomato paste. Turned out great!

This recipe was awesome! Im a vegetarian, so I subbed the chicken stock for veggie stock, and I replaced the frozen meatballs with soy meatballs. I had no white beans in my fridge, so I ommited them. A real italian taste, goes nicely with a glass of red and some warm bread.

For an easy sub for the refrigerated/frozen meatballs, I generally buy sweet Italian chicken/turkey sausage, cut it into pieces, and brown -- instant meatballs! Also, escarole works great in place of the spinach.

I've made this twice now (but eaten it more times than that because I was able to freeze so much of it) and I've loved it every time. The first time I made it, I used white and red kindney beans which added a visual interest. The second time I made it I added in (and I have no idea what this pasta is called) very small spherical pasta. The only mistake I made was that I didn't take into account that the pasta would absorb a lot of the liquid so I wasn't left with much liquid in the end. The "soup", however, stood up to my mistake because of all it's great flavors. I will make this soup for the rest of my cooking life.

I thought this soup was easy and delicious. Though I added some fresh thyme and parsely to make up for the canned ingredients. Question: Can someone tell me what epicurious means by the label "healthy"? I have looked all over the website and cannot find out what constitutes this...Wouldnt it be nice if each recipe was listed with its nutritional information?

I never trust frozen meatballs so I made the Italian Meatballs with Parmesan and used them instead. This was well worth the added effort. Yummm.

I made this soup last night and it was a winner, hands down. My husband and I both loved it. It was really easy to make and absolutely delicious. I made fresh baked meatballs instead of sauteeing frozen ones. It made for a wonderful appetizer. I would deinitely make it again

I used "real meatballs" instead of frozen, that makes a large positive difference. I also tossed in some small shells to make it fun. My girls loved it...it was a big hit! I'll keep this recipe.

I made 1/2 of this recipe the other day, but did increase the garlic cloves to 3, used the whole stalk of celery and the whole 6 oz. of spinach. Also used fresh onions. Added a scant 1 tsp. of both dried oregano and basil leaves, and a scant 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. Didn't add any tomatoes. Didnt have the correct cheese, so I subbed Pecorino-Romano (NEVER make this substitution!!!) It turned out TOO salty, and I didnt even add any table salt. I concur with the "Cook from Chicago, California on 12/24/06" that this recipe is not really very healthy, but I object more to the sodium content than the calories. I will make this again, but will use the correct cheese (or none), and sub some (or all) Campbell's No-Salt Added Broth for the reduced-sodium (Swanson). Even though too salty, it was quite good, and could be excellent with modifications. I would like to add salt to taste at the end. Also, I will have to look for better frozen meatballs next time-- Great Value from W/M are too mealy.

Very, very tasty in proportion to the work involved. I use vegetarian meatballs and vegetarian "chicken" broth, and it's become a favorite. Yum!

This recipe has become a family weeknight favorite because it is easy to prepare and delicious. I have used soy meatballs to reduce the fat & calories and like to add some dried summer savory and a bit of cracked red pepper flakes.

A new "frequent flyer" in my weeknight recipe file because of the ease of preparation. To make this recipe healthier I used soy protein meatballs & heated them in the oven per pkg. directions. This reduced the amount of olive oil required. I added dried savory & used Great Northern beans.

This note is not only an endorsement for this wonderful soup but also for this website. I was in a frenzy this weekend after having lost my magazine clipping of this recipe...thank goodness for epicurious! I've made this soup on a ton of occasions for my married-into Italian family, and it's a winner every single time. I use fresh onions and cut the frozen meatballs in half.

I made this for my boyfriend and myself for an easy weekday dinner, along with foccacia bread. Boyfriend hates all vegetables and thinner soups. He LOVED this recipe. He couldn't praise it enough, and that's unusual. I loved it as well! Healthy, easy, tasty!

This was so simple, and really delicious. A few changes -- I put a parmesan cheese rind into the soup while it was cooking. The rind adds a wonderful depth of flavor. I used turkey stock left over from Thanksgiving, and frozen turkey meatballs. It is very much like Italian Wedding soup, I think! I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe - delicious, substantial and best of all, QUICK - this one was served on New Years Eve, and is destined to become a winter staple in our home. As to variations on the original recipe theme, I used what I had available in the kitchen - hence, in went turkey meatballs rather than beef, fresh onion instead of frozen, and chicken bouillon cubes w/water in lieu of the recommended canned broth. All in all, a winner of a recipe!

Great hearty soup for a cold snowy night. Took the advice of others and added a can of seasoned tomatoes. I also added fresh white mushrooms, orzo, a large can of cannelli beans, extra veggies, along with some fresh parsley and basil. Paired it with a hearty whole grain artisan bread and a glass of zinfandel. Yum! Very easy, I'll definitely make again.

Oh, ick!! Frozen meatballs?!!! After trying this - No thank you/ never again! The meatballs were the MOST tasteless, disgusting thing I have EVER had. It's really sad too, because I think this recipe has potential - just NOT with frozen, yucky meatballs.

To the cook from Chicago, yes there are plenty of ways to cut calories in this dish, but as a complete meal, it isn't that extreme. I stick to a 1900 calorie a day "live it" and this recipe stays within my guidelines. I would try to cut a little so I could have some yummy crackers with it, then go for a nice walk afterward. Yum!

This recipe was indeed delicious. What I don't understand, however, is how it could possibly have been classified as being "healthy"--one serving of the soup contains approximately 800 calories, with over half of that being fat. 1 lb of meatballs contains roughly 1100 calories, the 2 cans of beans added roughly another 800, the oil adds 600. Add another 200 for the cheese, 100 for the broth, 200 for all the vegetables, and you're talking over 3000 calories for the entire dish. When I made this, I cut out the oil completely (and used pam spray). I found one can of beans to be more then sufficent, and I also used 6 ounces (not 15-20!) of mini-meatballs. I also tossed in 1/4 C of mini pasta. The nutrition information made this way is just under 300 calories...which I consider to be a lot more reasonable for a "healthy" main course soup

This is one of those 3.5 meals in our family. I tripled this and shared with friends. It went over really well. I ended up throwing in some roasted squash that was left over from another dish. ALso used canned tom's with spices already added.

I too used the frozen pre-cooked meatballs from Sam's (or Costco, I forget) but I tossed them in 1 Tbls olive oil and put them under the broiler in a round cake pan while preparing the stove-top portion of the soup. It was easy to give the cake pan a shake or two to turn the meatballs for further browning, then just empty into the soup when called for. My husband is not a big fan of cooked spinach but he liked this dish. Chunks of crusty bread really made this a meal.

I didn't cook the meatballs--the Italian ones I get at SAM's club are precooked. Also, you can use frozen spinach--well drained!

Looked really good in the magazine so I thought I would give it a try. The neighbors were over for some wine and I said, "stay for dinner, new recipe". Of course they stayed. I used 1 whole medium onion (not frozen), only 1 can of beans and doubled the amount of veggies and it was absolutely perfect! It was added to my "favorite recipes" folder

It took longer than 10 minutes, but it was easy and very good. I didn't add the water, just forgot it, and I think that the broth would be too thin if I had. I added more carrots and celery, otherwise, made it just as written. It's even better the next day. I will definitely make it again, maybe add potatoes as recommended below.

Fabulous! Only change was to use all chicken broth & no water. Served with a crusty bread for dinner & was also great for lunch the following day.

Good and simple. If you want to make the broth more rich, deglaze the meatball pan with a splash (maybe 1/4 cup) of dry white wine. Boil it down a tad and add that to the broth as it simmers. Makes for a much fuller broth.

I made this soup for my extended family with very mixed tastes and opinions AFTER running non-stop all day. It was wonderful and so easy. The only thing I may try next time is to add some diced potatoes for a bit more substance and a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. Yum-o!

Makes a great meal with a loaf of crusty bread. A couple of additions are called for. I added in some oregano and basil for added flavor. And next time I will add more celery and carrots.
