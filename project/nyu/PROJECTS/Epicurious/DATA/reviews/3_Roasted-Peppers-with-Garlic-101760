Great recipe! I followed the directions from Donna Mileti Benenson and had excellent results! I used these for a focaccia sandwich with basil pesto, topped with slices of roasted eggplant, roasted peppers, and mozzarella cheese! Got rave reviews for the sandwich!

I thought these were delicious and easy, and I'd definitely make again. They went great with the chicken w/capers. I later put them in a sandwich with goat cheese--yum. They'd be great to keep on hand as a condiment.

These are a great base for roasted red pepper sauce. Puree the peppers, add a cup of white wine, simmer until reduced slightly. Great over chicken or fish or vegetables. (Note: I've also found that if you have your outdoor grill going for a different meal, while you're at it, char the peppers on the grill instead to use for the next night's meal!)

Excellent classic dish,poor method. This recipe fails to take advantage of the superb juices emitted by the peppers, by advising one to cut them before broiling or roasting, and also, by not suggesting that they then be seeded and skinned over a colander or strainer set in a bowl to save the rich juices. For years I've made roasted peppers, up to a dozen broiled on a broiler pan at a time, and people love them and say they can't get them like this anywhere else. Well, they can: Rotate peppers on pan as each side charrs. When soft and blackened, gently place peppers in a paper bag, rolled tightly closed and set in a bowl until cool enough to handle. Put a colander in another bowl and remove one pepper at a time from sealed bag and open peppers up in the colander to seed and skin, so all juices are strained into the bowl. Use strained juices to marinate peppers, adding olive oil and garlic and salt to taste. (Rinsed salted capers and slivers of anchoives can also be added to taste, but often the peppers are so sweet, this is overkill.) This method will give you sweet natural juices,and not only cut down on the amount of olive oil one needs, but will also dramatically enrich the intensity of roasted pepper flavor. A tip: to keep seeds and charred skin from sticking to fingers, splash fingers, never the peppers,under cold water as needed.

I have made this recipe for years and it is excellent. The only difference I do is add a bit more garlic (minced) and add a tablespoon of Balsamic vinegar. Yum!!
