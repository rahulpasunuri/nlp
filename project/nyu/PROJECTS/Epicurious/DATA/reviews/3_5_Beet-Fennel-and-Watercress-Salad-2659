This didn't do much for me - honey made it sweeter than it needed to be. For what it's worth, I use vacuum-packed beets all the time and they're delicious.

Beets and watercress, with fennel or red onion are a pretty clssic combo. What makes this a little different is the dressing. For those who say buy beets already cooked.. DON'T! That will completely destroy this dish... Beets are incredibly simpel to make, so I have no idea why a cook talked about it being so time consuming.

Absolutely delicious! I agree that its alot of work with the beets, but its worth it. Didn't have watercress on hand so I used baby spinach. Very good.

The recipe is wonderful. The one comment I would make is, buy the beets already cooked if you can (not canned!!! but many high end markets sell cooked/non-marinated beets). Making the beets was messy, frustrating and terribly time consuming.
