The filling tastes really good, perhaps a bit more rum or let the raisins soak longer. But the crust, maybe I did something wrong, is it flat and not fluffy like in the picture.

This is awesome. Definitely not your typical 'boring' apple pie. I used Captain Morgans and a little more than 1 teaspoon zest. Gives a refreshing twist and rave reviews from everyone I've made it for!

Made this last night and was very pleased with the result, even with purchased piecrust. Soaked the raisins in Capt Morgan rum and used half cup. Sautéed a mix of four apple types - gala, Granny Smith, Fuji and Paula in butter before adding sugar/spice mix and baking. This ones a keeper.

Foolproof and uber-delicious!!! To get the best flavor profile, it is a must that you use the apple variety in the "Cook's Note". I make this recipe a couple times a year,have been making it since it was first published and I think I'll never try another apple pie recipe again.

For the record, I don't like apple pie. But my husband does, and due to my dietary changes I gave this recipe a go, with tweaks...left out the lemon zest and the rum, used apples and pears in a 2:1 ratio with the skins on, and added disaronno instead. With homestyle ice cream it was really good...for an apply pie!

I cut this into thirds using two apples to just make it for me and hubby. Yum. The only changes I made were to replace the flour with cornstarch and leave out the raisins...but I left in the rum!

Excellent and easy recipe. I used 3 granny smith and 3 large galas which made a nice high pie. I followed the recipe to a T except for the crust. I also made the filling the night before to save time. It was perfection!

I used Black Strap Rum to soak the raisins and this pie won BEST PIE in a contest! I never got to taste it but I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.

I've made this for years and have evolved it a bit. Here's what I currently do: - Use the "Flaky Pie Crust" recipe in Epicurious - Make it in a gratin dish and increase the filling by 50%, the crust is sufficient - Borrowed a Gordon Ramsay method and precook the filling with some butter to caramelize and cook down the apples a bit (filling can also be made the day before) - Don't use Mcintosh anymore. Currently trying Golden Delicious or Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp or Pink Lady (if its available). I'm still trying to figure out the ultimate combination. - cube and then re-freeze the shortening and butter for about 30 minutes to help make a really crumbly mixture in the food processor - roll the crust onto floured wax paper for easier transfer - grind fresh nutmeg in a coffee grinder - only change to the crust is 3 tbsp vodka + 3 tbsp water. Was told about the vodka trick a couple years ago and seems to help increase the flakiness.

I've made this recipe for years and my family, friends, and co-workers all look forward to it. I use the "Flaky Pie Crust" recipe in Epicurious. I make it in a gratin dish and increase the filling recipe by 50% - the crust is sufficient. I also pre-cook the fie filling (method borrowed from a Gordon Ramsay recipe) with some butter to caramelize the apples and to cook them down a bit to avoid the air gap between the apples and crust - the crust recipe is really flakey and holds its original shape. By pre-cooking the filling it can be made the day before. I also freshly grind the nutmeg in a coffee grinder. I roll out the crust on floured wax paper for easier handling. I also cube and freeze the butter and shortening for about 30 minutes and make sure it doesn't start to melt when pulsing in the food processor so its really crumbly. My only change to the crust is I use 3 tbsp of vodka + 3 tbsp of water in the crust - was told a couple years ago it helps with the flakiness and seems to help! I also don't use Mcintosh anymore as they get too mushy. Right now I'm trying fresh organic Golden Delicious and Gala, Fuji, and Honeycrisp (9 apples in total).

Delicious apple pie, the rum and raisins really added something special. And, it was not soupy at all, nice and firm. Definitely a keeper.

This pie was a HUGE hit when I served it to friends and family at a dinner party. I did make a few significant alterations based on my resources. Rather than purchasing dark rum, I used Wild Turkey American Honey whiskey since I already had it. I also used all Granny Smith apples (rather than 3 different, two-of-a-kind) and added about 2 Tablespoons of regular sugar to balance the tartness. I never brush my crust prior to baking, but wait until it is fresh from the oven and brush with melted butter, then sprinkle with sugar.Whenever I do have rum and a variety of apples, I'll be interested to see how it compares as we all LOVED the variation!

Rating: 4
Yummy! I used eight apples, two each of Granny Smith, Rome, Crispin, and McIntosh. I also ended up adding more rum and soaking the raisins longer to make them even plumper. I think a better crust could improve the recipe, but the one listed in ok. I will make this one again.

Rating: 4
Terrific pie. The pastry is, after decades of pie-making, my new go-to -- perfect in every way. I added another 1/3 of a cup of raisins and doubled the rum, used a bit more flour to make sure it all didn't run and I have exactly one skinny little piece left. My guests went nuts for it.

This pie needs to be renamed "Vanishing Pie" This pie will disappear within minutes of being put on the table. Both the raisin & variety of apples give a good quality & depth to this pie. YUMMY!

The crust was flakey on the bottom!! Insane. I was so impressed and so was my husband. I got cheeky with the crust and even wrote "Husband, I love you - Wife" in cut-outs on the top crust. It was still perfect and easy to place with all that on there! Really really easy to work with. Plus the filling isn't so soggy and gross as to render the crust anything other than flaky deliciousness. Instead of the shortening, I just made it all-butter. The rum and raisins soaked in a little to the crust but not enough to keep the flakiness at bay! The filling was the perfect texture/flavour and liquidiness. Even if I did use my apple slinky instead of doing it by hand. But I'm lazy like that (you know, lazy... can't chop apples but can customize a crust in messages...yeah). Husband loved it so much. Said I could be a professional pie maker with this upgrade in my pie-making abilities. Shh.

I made this for my father-in-law who loves anything with rum and raisins. This recipe doesn't disappoints! I added a bit more apples, raisins and rum. My husband said it was the best pie he ever had. He doesn't like pie in general. Will be serving this again at tonight's dinner party!

Yup. Won first place in the district fair here in Connecticut. Make no adjustments to the recipe. By adding more rum, it turns out a little too juicy.

I love fresh fruit pies. They are my absolute favorite dessert ever, but apple pie has always left me feeling underwhelmed. THIS apple pie is AMAZING. No longer just mush with cinnamon -- the rum-steeped raisins push the flavor profile over the edge. (Make sure you use good rum.) I used a mix of sweet gala & fuji with heirloom smokehouse and one other tart variety I can't remember -- it was bangin! A big hit at Erev Rosh Hashanah dinner.

I made this pie last night with 7 Shamrock apples. It turned out beautifully. The interior of the pie was perfectly balanced, including the kick that the rum & raisins provided. The recipe was easy to follow. Note: Embarrassed as I am to admit it, I used a pre-made crust (Pillsbury), which was fine, but really didn't do the pie justice. When I make this pie again, I'll definitely make the crust from scratch.

Rating: 4
This was the first pie I have ever made from scratch. I'm new at cooking/baking, so I was very worried, but it turned out SO DELICIOUS! The crust was perfect too! The only things I did different was to use apples brought in from a friends apple trees; I'm not even sure what kind they were, but they were my inspiration for tackling this challenge and I also used spiced rum instead of dark because it was what I had. I found the recipe pretty simple to follow, but the task itself was huge for a newbie. I don't own a rolling pin.. I had to get creative. I expected it to be a lot of work, but the pie was worth it. I ended up taking some to work and everyone raved. Great, great recipe. Thanks for giving me a very proud pie moment.

This is a perfect pie. I followed this and the crust recipe to a "T," and I was very happy with how great it turned out. The only thing I did differently was use RAW sugar instead of sanding. I doubled the recipe to make two at once, and it all worked out fine. A good variety of apples I imagine help; I used all four recommended. I made this and two banana cream pies for my friends, and the apple pies were inhaled before the banana cream pies were cut.

I made this recipe as is, other than adding a dash of mace. In my opionion, PIE PERFECTION! :-) I can't speak for the crust as I always use the recipe handed down to me from my Grammy. I ended up taking half the pie to the librarian ladies in town because I could not stop eating it. This is so incredibly delicious. Try it and enjoy!

Like many of the previous reviewers, I upped the rum (1/3 c.) and raisins (1/2 c.). Brushed the crust with half and half and sprinkled demerara sugar on top. The crust was very flaky, almost too dry and crumbly, but served warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it was nearly perfect. This is the second one I made this weekend - the first one yesterday, went to a church bake sale. It was on the table for less than two minutes before selling! My husband insisted I make another tonight - great idea, honey. :-)

This turned out to be absolutely the best apple pie that I've ever made. Granted, it's only the 2nd apple pie that I've ever made, but still, it's darn good eats! Followed the directions exactly and the only issue that I had was that all of the apples would not fit into the crust. I had about 3/4 of an apple worth of slices left over. That's probably just due to unusually large apples to begin with.

Who said it was tasteless? It was delicious! I didnt have rum, so I used an austrian pear schnapps and it was a perfect dessert for the dinner. And it was "international" approved too: On the table there were 2 english boys, 3 spaniards (1 girl and 2 boy), 1 holland girl, 1 indonisian girl, 2 austrian boys and one mexican girl (me)... We all live in Spain though. :-) ¡Buen provecho!

I'm not sure why others thought it was boring. It was delicious and a hit at my dinner party! I did up the rum (per an earlier suggestion) to 5 tablespoons, in addition to 1/2 cup of raisins. I'm a cinnamon lover, so I put a full teaspoon in, along with 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.

The prior reviews are not consistent with my experience. This recipe tastes just like it reads on the ingredients: a solid, tasty rum raisin apple pie. Got to use dark rum though folks - maybe next time I would add a bit more of it, but this is certainly a good, although not spectacular, dish.

I followed this recipe exactly and wasn't too impressed. The crust was so-so but the filling did not have enough of a distinct flavor. I guess I was hoping for something more traditional. Or maybe I undercooked the apples?

This recipe was awesome. I made two for our Christmas party and both were gone by the end of the night. Tweaking: 1/2 cup of raisins, 4 1/2- 5 tablespoons of rum (Myer's Dark rum), add 3/4 cup of sugar (if you like a sweet pie), vary the apples of 2 red delicious apples, 2 galas, and 2 grannies, and finally replace the milk with 1/4 cup of whipping cream. It is delicious! Making several for gifts this year.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was the best apple pie I've ever eaten. The only thing I did differently was to use a little more raisins and use a crisp topping instead of pie crust. The filling was so good that I didn't even taste the pie crust -- my least favorite part of pie.

This was my first self-made classic american pie ever and I got this dough recipe wrong. I can only recommend to take less vegetable shortening for the dough and keep it COOL. The Dough-recipe didn't make that clear, if you ask me. But the pie...mainly because of the great, great filling(really, I can't imagine to improve it any more) was just supberb nontheless. I will definitely make this one again...and again...

This was the best apple pie I've ever had! Changed the crust to one with chopped walnuts to complement the apples (mostly flour, but approx. 1:3 ratio walnuts to flour). Also decreased the sugar in the filling and used sugar in the raw. Finally, poured some dark rum on the pie after cooking to enhance the rum flavor (adults only!) This was delicious with simple whipped cream.

I made the "simple" crust, and must have done something wrong because it just crumbled when I tried to roll it out. I went back to the store and bought a Pillsbury refrigerated crust. I also did up the rum and raisins and also the spices. It was very pretty and tasted good. I was a bit dissappointed in my crust.

This is one of the best apple pies I've had (and believe me, there have been quite a few). The darker flavors of the rum balance nicely with the pie's overall sweetness. One added step that I've taken to is to incorporate another couple of tablespoons of rum into the filling. This one is definitely a keeper!
