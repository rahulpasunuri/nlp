Great simple potato salad, which has become our regular recipe. The mustard adds a little bit of flavor. Skipped the dill, eggs and apples, and reduce the mayo/sour cream accordingly. Several people ask for the recipe.

We love this recipe as a base recipe for our taste. No fruit etc. The dil and the french dressing make this a great treat for us

No one in my family liked this potato salad. In fact, we really hated it!! Way too much vinegar; also the mayo/sour cream dressing was bland and there was too much of it. I would rate it negative forks if possible!!

This was very good, with or without the apples. I'm glad I reduced the recipe by a third, as it still made enough for at least 6-8. Next time, however, I will reduce the amount of dressing even further.

I love this potato salad. My mother has been making it for as long as I can remember, except without the apples, and with scallions instead of onion. Everyone loves it. The French Dressing makes it a little tangy, besides adding color.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now and it's the best potato salad I've ever had. I am always asked to bring it to BBQ's. I would suggest making it the day you want to eat it though - it's not as good if it's been refrigerated overnight.

My boyfriend took one bite and said it was my best potato salad recipe yet. I didn't have dill or celery and used prepared mustard instead of dry, with balsamic vinegar mixed with prepared Fremch dressing. Used 1 1/2 apples not 2. Oldest child didnt like the apple. Fat free sour cream was fine. Next time wouldnt marinate in dressing, I always add the dressing last and all at once or it breaks up the potatoes. Not bad, not spectacular. Boyfriend rated it 3 spoons.
