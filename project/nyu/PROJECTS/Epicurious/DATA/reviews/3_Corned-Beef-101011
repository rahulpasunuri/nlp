I've finally figured out that there is only one way to cook a corned beef and have it come out perfect every time. I cook mine overnight in a crockpot, on low. Add about a cup of beer and throw in a few tabelspoons of Zatarain's Shrimp and Crab Boil mix (I know it sounds weird, just trust me though...). I'll put one in the pot before going to bed and by about 3:00 a.m. all the menfolk in my house are up stirring around because the aroma wakes them up. Beef is perfect for hash in the a.m....

Easy, excellent! I added to the water: bay leaf, sliced onion, peppercorns and parsley flakes.

I really don't understand why I see reviews with people wanting to get the salt out of the meat. By definition, to corn a cut of beef means "To season and preserve with granulated salt." It's how the meat has always been prepared, and if you don't like that, eat something else. Corned beef is a very traditional dish for irish folk and St. Patricks day. The reason it's served with bland foods like mashed potatos and cabbage is to temper the saltiness of the beef. It also comes from the days when pickling was one of the few ways you could keep a good cut of meat fresh when there were no refridgerators.

A gentle simmer for 2 & 1/2 hours in Guinness Stout is a definitely winner!

TO MAKE IT BETTER: Cook with BEER! I add 2 cans of beer to the water to start. Guinness works especially well! DELICIOUS.

We made corned beef this way until we felt it was too mushy and the flavor too diluted. Instead, we now simmer the corned beef for 1 1/2 hours (and add more pickling spice and peppercorns to what comes with the meat) and then bake it at 300 degrees for 1 to 1 1/2 hours to desired softness. Simmering at too hard of a boil will toughen it, so be careful. The baking at the end dires it out to concentrate the flavors.

It's good, but not great. You might want to try the 3-4 lbs. corned beef this way. WASH IT TWICE. This gets most of the salt out. Put 1 1/2" water in your pan. Dump 1 1/2 handsfull of pickling spice in the water. Put your beef in the pan, fat side up. Then put another 1 1/2 handsful pickling spice on top of the beef. Cover it loosely. Bake 300 degrees F. Bake for: 1 1/2 hours PER POUND.

This recipe was sent to me from Mannheim, Germany. I haven't tried it but I have emailed it to several people looking for a scratch recipe. Let me know how it turns out! _____________________________________________________ For a 5 lbs piece of brisket (+/- .5 lbs) I take 6-7 qt cold water, bring to boil after adding 2-3 lbs of brining salt (or salt with a heavy pinch of saltpeter...same thing) and .5-1 lbs brown sugar and a heavy helping of pickeling spice and some garlic. After the water has boiledtake it from the heat, add red paprika powder and let the mixture cool off. The next day take room temp brisket and with a marinade injector fill as much of the brine into the meat as it will take. Make sure you filter the brine as not to "stuff up" the injector with pickeling spice. If you don't have an injector add 1-2 weeks to the brining time. Cover the injected meat with the remaining brine and weigh the meat down with plates or glas platters to ensure the meat does not have any contact with air. Close your brining container (anything will do) and refrigerate for 8-10 days, turning the meat every 2-3 days. This ensures equal coloring of the meat. When done put the meat into clear cold water overnight and then put into fresh water with an onion spiked with some cloves and some bay leaves and peppercorns. Slowly bring to a boil then turn down the heat and continue to simmer for 2-3 hours. This is needed to to get the imense salt amounts out of the meat and tenderize it. Et voila...corned beef from scratch.

I'm convinced that the best way to make corned beef is to start it in cold water and cook it all day in a crockpot at the lowest setting possible. Don't bother skimming. Unplug the crockpot about 1/2 hour before serving. Slice across the grain with a very sharp carving knife. If you do cook it on the stove, keep the simmer as low as possible. A few tiny bubbles at a time. Anything higher than that will cause the meat to tighten up and get tough. Serve as soon as possible after removing from the liquid, as the meat will begin to dry very quickly.

I have used Julia Childs' recipe from her "How to Cook" book many times to prepare corned beef from a whole beef brisket. It is excellent. It takes about two weeks to cure. Enjoy!

One of Craig Claiborne's cookbooks - maybe "Favorites" - has a recipe for corning beef - and also for making your own pastrami.

I too was looking to "corn" my own beef. I think I'll look in the "pickle" section.

Spelling correction: on the cookbook's name with good recipe for brining your own corned beef. Should read 'laVarenne Pratique' (1989 Macmillan of Canada) by Anne Willan. Unfortunately I am not French Canadian.

I have been searching various websites to find a recipe for making corned beef - that is preparing a brisket in a brine/pickling solution. I cannot find any information. I would also like to know how pastrami -not deli bought - is prepared. Please e-mail a method for preparing a brisket to BECOME corned beef.
