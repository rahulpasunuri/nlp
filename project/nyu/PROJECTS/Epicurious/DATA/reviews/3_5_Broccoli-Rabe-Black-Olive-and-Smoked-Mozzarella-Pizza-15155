Good, not great. We added red chili flakes but felt it could have used something more.

This is a great go to recipe. Perfect as is, no adjustments needed.

So flavorful! I used fresh pizza dough, added plum tomatoes & mushrooms, drizzled more olive oil, added a bit extra parm-reggiano and used feta cheese instead of smoked mozz but it turned out delicious... i hope to try it with artichokes next time...

I have made this recipe several times and love it. It was a good hit at a casual dinner party.
