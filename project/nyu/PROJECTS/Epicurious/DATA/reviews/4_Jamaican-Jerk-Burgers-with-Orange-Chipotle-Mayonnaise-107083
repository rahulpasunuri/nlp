Wonderful recipe! Don't change a thing when you make this - and don't substitue the habanero with jalapeno or any other chili or it will taste drastically different than intended. We add 1 cup of the jerk sauce directly into the ground beef (no marinating). Use any left over sauce for dipping.

Loved these burgers. I simmered down the extra marinade which made a fabulous sauce (everyones favorite part). Could stand to omit the Mayo, not outstanding and adds lots of calories. Used one seeded habanero, not a lot of heat. Didn't bother with the lettuce. Can see using the sauce on chicken too. Yum! Served with Caribbean rice and beans which were a big hit too.

So, its a simplified, maybe not entirely authentic jerk sauce. I don't care! It's absolutely delicious. At the suggestion of others, I cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 cup or so, and same with the soy sauce. I like serrano chilies, so I used those for the heat. Still basically the same sauce. Not really much else to say, it's a good burger with a really, really delicious marinade/sauce. The mayo was very good too, though now I need to find a way to use this (almost) full can of chipotle chilies.

I agree with some of the other reviews in that it was a little overly sweet. It just felt like it was missing something. I even cut down the brown sugar to 1/3 c. and added some cilantro to the sauce. I also marinated the meat for 2 hours, and I think that was a great move. I added swiss cheese to the burger and I think that helped too. It was pretty good. My husband absolutely loved it, but I thought it would stand out a little more.

This recipe turned out amazingly well! The `jerk`sauce, although not authentic, was delicious. Marinating the burgers really added to the flavor. Next time, I will add salt and pepper inside the patties. (I wasn`t sure if the sauce would over salt them, but it didn`t.)If you have the time, marinate some grilled eggplant in oil and vinegar, and serve on these burgers. The tangy contrast really serves the juicy meat and creamy sauce.

This is more of a blend of Korean bbq and jerk seasoning. Yes, it is yummy but too sweeet and way too much shoyu for a true jerk flavor. If you are looking for a more original jerk taste try the Grilled Jerk Chicken recipe on this site. I loved the mayo!

These burgers were really delicious and I received many compliments on them. The girls even went back for more of the yummy mayo. However, like other reviewers, it didn't seem like real jerk to me. I used jalapeno peppers because I wasn't sure how hot my guests would like it but I left everything else the same. The marinade was excellent, I will definitely make these again but only 3 forks instead of 4 since I didn't get the real jerk flavor from them.

A delight. I simply reduced the amount of soy, brown sugar and oil. It was still a flavorful, yet rich and plentiful, liquid marinade. The adobo-orange mayo was the surprise element. The combo made for a burst of flavor in each bite. Use soft rolls, and definitely include the onions, tomato and a crunchy lettuce.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe - with excellent, easy-to-make components! I marinated the burgers longer (2 hours) and they were the most tender, juicy burgers I've had in ages. The jerk sauce is simple & uncomplicated (as compared to other jerk sauces I've made), but delivers on flavour BIG TIME. I cut back and made 2 burgers, but kept the mayonnaise & jerk sauce quantities as-is - and very glad I did! I used the leftover jerk sauce as a marinade for bone-in chicken breasts & baby back ribs, and drizzled a bit of the jerk in a Jamaican-style sweet potato salad. I mixed some of the Orange-Chipotle Mayo in my dressing for an island-style coleslaw (added thin sliced apples, pineapples, radishes, and red onion to a coleslaw mix), and made some Jamaican rice & black-eyed peas. End result?? I had TWO fabulous, different meals from this one recipe! Will DEFINATELY make this again!

This was a no-brainer. The husband and I love Jerk seasonings and Adobo peppers so when I saw a recipe to bring them together...heaven. The Jerksauce is the best I've ever made. I can not WAIT to cook some ribs with it. I am thinking about making these in a mini form for a party as appetizers.

These burgers are my "go-to" dish. They are spicy, if you don't want super spicy use green chilies instead of the habanero!!!! But so incredibly delicous, my guests are always impressed and ask for the recipe. Bonus, they are EASY.

Marinated burgers ROCK! I mix half pork and half beef in my burgers though, makes them more moist.. just a personal preference.

Unbelievably tasty! I only had time to marinate an hour and they were still delicious. I didn't have time to grill so I just used a grill pan inside. The mayo is delicious, I used just the chilies in adobo (no OJ) as my husband doesn't like the taste, and it was still amazing. Be sure to brush the extra sauce on while cooking I think it makes a big difference!

A staple in my house. Wonderful. Delicious. Period. I use ground turkey and it is still juicy and delicious and the only condiments needed are tomato, onion, and lettuce. Highly recommended. (PS - I used the habenero).

This is a great recipe - anyone who didn't like it probably did it wrong. What I have to offer is a comparison between turkey & beef burgers. I made the marinade & used most of it on turkey burgers, I let them marinate for 5 hours. They were REALLY good - probably the best turkey burger I've ever had. A few days later made burgers again, this time with beef. They marinated for about 20 minutes & turned into the best burger I've ever had. One tip - if you're like me and it takes you 3 months to use up a can of chipotle chilies, line an ice cube tray with plastic wrap & freeze the left over chilies individually.

What a great recipe! I follow the recipe pretty much except that I leave the burgers in the jerk sauce 3-5 hrs.I let them sit at room temp. for 20 mins before grilling. I use frozen oj with the mayo and about 1 tsp of fresh orange peel. I think the next time I will use only fresh orange peel so it doesn't become to thin. This recipe is a keeper!!

Delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and spice. I prefer more spice so I added another pepper and threw in some seeds. Found out a blender works just as well as a processor. I used the leftover mayo on chicken sandwiches.

I really enjoyed the jerk sauce. I used half as a marinade (to which I added more garlic and sesame oil) and basted the burgers with the other half. The chipotle mayo was also tasty, but I could hardly taste the orange flavor - maybe next time I will add some zest.

these are unbelievably tasty! i used scotch bonnet peppers (i love it hot), added extra chipotles, and marinated the patties for about 4 hours. a thick slice of tomato on top - mmm! i don't think the mayo added much, and the amount was WAY more than i'd ever use. my boyfriend called the flavor 'fake jerk' even though he liked the burgers -- so next time, i'll try adding some store-bought jamaican jerk seasoning for more authenticity.

These are the best burgers I've ever had and guests have told me the same thing. The jerk sauce is spectacular. I have made them several times and will again for a big BBQ this weekend. I don't believe you need to mix the sauce into the meat. I like to add a slice of swiss cheese and last time I added a slice of grilled pineapple. FANTASTIC!!!

These burgers were just great. I marinated them for about 8 hours, added 1T orange juice plus orange zest to the mayo (to prevent runnyness) , added a little ground cinamin and ground cloves to the marinade, as well as a little chipotle hot sauce. I also topped the burgers with a slice of a mild cheese. Mmmmmm! Thanks Epicurious and other cooks for the suggestions. By the way, the anduille burgers listed in the same article are also great and I have made these several times before. No more boring hamburgers for us!

I hardly ever give any recipe 4 forks, let alone burgers. But these are amazing. Used only one jalapeno, because that is what I had in the house. Also marinated burgers all day. THey were superb, and everyone at the table said so on their own. I even thought mayonaise on burgers was really weird, but the chipotles really put this mayonaise in a different category. Make this!

I have made this twice, once with Jaleopeno peppers ans tonight with habanero. The Habenero was better but.. My wife asked me to sho- and make dinner. This was at 4:00. An hour to shop and 1 1/2 hours to make dinner with barely sufficient marinade time. The whole house was complaining about how late dinner was. They all shutup when it was finally served. Then, the complements and apologies started. Would I make this again? You bet!

I followed the advice of some reviewers to mix of the jerk sauce into the meat before mixing patties. I like to make a lot of something like this and freeze for convenient weekday family meals. I added about 3/4 cup to 4 lbs of meat and it seemed like too much as the patties don't seem to stay together that well. Taste was pretty good and they were moist, but I did not grill them as they would have been a mess. Next time I will try the other actual directions and then freeze. My husband did not rave, but said they were "pretty good for burgers." Kids have not tried them yet.

My wife and I made this over 4th of July and loved it. We tried it two different ways...(1) follow the reciped exactly and (2) mix the burger and marinade together and then make the patties. Following the recipe was much better. We will defintely be making this again!

This has become one of our all time favorite recipes. We've made it numerous times and we never tire of it! Like some of the other reviewers, I mix the jerk sauce in with the meat instead of brushing it on. We usually leave some left over to brush on the bun as desired. Would highly recommend. The jerk sauce is good on grilled chicken too!

I've reviewed this dish before and suggested to use a couple of tablespoons of frozen orange juice concentrate instead of the orange juice for better flavor, and to keep the mayo from being so runny. I would like to add to this suggestion that you try Tabasco brand chipotle hot sauce. Start with a teaspoon and adjust until you like it. Every time I make these, I have to give out the recipe. They are so damn good!

Rating: 4
Wow! Great burgers! I did alter the recipe to include items I had on hand. The mayonaise: I used a little OJ and a tsp of orange zest with the chipotle chile and mayo. The orange zest gives a nice orange flavor. Instead of green onions I used 1/2 sweet red onion, instead of habanero chile I used chipotle chile. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg. I added 1/4 cup of the Jerk Sauce to the hamburger and kneaded it in before forming the patties. Grilled on outdoor grill. I put a slice of American cheese and two slices of bacon on each cooked burger. The whole family LOVED this! The burgers were juicy and one of the best burgers ever!

I had no problem halving this recipe, but I admit that I didn't bother with measuring the jalepenos, etc. - just went by taste. I marinated the meat about 4 hours and it turned out awesome. The chipotle mayo certainly takes a back seat to the reserved marinade used as a sauce, but it makes a nice contrast for those who don't like as much heat. I served this on toasted kaiser rolls with slices of avocado and beefsteak tomatoes. We grilled some potatoes and corn on the cob for sides, and I served cinnamon apple iced tea. Scrumptious! Definitely a meal that could be served to guests with relatively little effort and big results.

Rating: 4
Scrumptious, delicious, fantastic, these ARE the best burgers! I make the jerk sauce and mix it with the meat since brushing the sauce on invites flames. The taste is still the same when the sauce is incorporated into the meat. I have never used the mayonnaise so can't comment on it.

I made this with elk, which is very lean and tends to be dry. Adding some chopped onion and red pepper helps retain moisture. Also left it in the marinade a little longer. It turned out fabulous and I would recommend the recipe for any lean meat.

possibly the best hamburgers ever.

I've already reviewed these and stand by earlier comments that these are fab....But, I have a recommendation for the mayonaise as I found it quite runny. Use orange juice concentrate straight from the can (a T or two...to taste) along with chipotle seasoning powder as opposed to the juicier chipotle in adobo. Same fabulous results, and the sauce is more like a mayo!

Like so many have said, these are GREAT! The jerk marinade produces burgers that are flavorful, juicy, and richly caramelized off the grill. Served these along with sweet potato fries and Carolina Coleslaw (both on this site) and the family raved. Took reviewers' tips and decreased soy and increased garlic in the marinade. In the mayo, I added extra chipotle and added 1/4 t. fresh grated orange rind to pump up the orange flavor. Next time I'd decrease the orange juice to 2T to keep the mayo thicker. We'll be enjoying these burgers again this summer!

These are great. I used many reader tips (Thanks! I count on them) to get them just right for us, & make regularly. I forget the mayo & throw in chipotle with the jerk sauce. We like them with tomato, avocado or cucumber. Oven fries or onion rings on side.

This sauce was fantastic! I didn't bother with the mayo--I eat my burger without a bun anyway, because I can't eat wheat/gluten. Also used gluten-free soy sauce (San-J). I'll use less soy sauce and more garlic next time, as others recommended. I served it with a salad of red leaf lettuce, red onion, avocado, papaya and catalina dressing, and it was a nice complement.

Used ground chuck to produce these juicy burgers. The sauce/marinade was to die for...just bursting with flavor and super simple to make. It was so great that I didn't need to add additional salt since the soy did the job. I did increase the garlic, but totally forgot to add the allspice. Heat was just right using 2 medium seeded jalapenos. I will certainly make this recipe again with the allspice and probably increase the thyme also. Flavor just didn't come through enough even using fresh from my garden. We are not mayo users but I went ahead and made it anyway. Was good but didn't think that it really lent anything extra to the recipe. I garnished with thinly sliced red onions, tomatoes, and arugula. This sauce would be super on boneless chicken or even pork. In a word...YUMMMMMMMMM!

Delicious! I followed the directions to the letter. I'm a novice cook, so I only recently learned that you're not supposed to: 1) not over work or press the ground beef when forming patties, 2) use the least lean ground beef as you're willing to go and 3) don't press down on the burgers with a spatula as they're grilling. I don't know if that is common knowledge, but having followed those tips, I made the by far juiciest, tastiest burgers ever!
