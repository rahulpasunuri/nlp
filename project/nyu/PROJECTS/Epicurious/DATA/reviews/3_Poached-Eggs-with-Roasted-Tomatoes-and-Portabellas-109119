I made this recipe for my family, everyone loved it! I'm a huge fan of Portabellas so that made this recipe all the more wonderful! I had never made this recipe before, but i must say it did turn out pretty good. I was a little bit unhappy that the yolks were a bit under cooked though.(:

Though I've always loved poached eggs, I was afraid to try my hand and making them. Now that I'm living in England, it's a must. I found this site and prepared perfect poached eggs for this recipe. t has all kinds of various preparation methods to choose from- http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/16/how-make-perfect-poached-egg -As far as the recipe goes, I was not a fan of the balsamic vingear, used lots of cheese, 3 slices of tomato per portabella, and also drained portabellas and poached eggs. Also, it's difficult (for me at least) to prepare this for simultaneous consumption (assuming you're cooking for another as well)

Made as written with a different cheese (Mancheko) and added a dollop of homemade tomatillo salsa after broiling. Side of sausage, an apple-almond pancake topped with black currant jam and fresh-squeezed juice rounded out a dynamite Sunday brunch.

Really good recipe and quite simple and quick. I somewhat agree with the tomato dessenters. Next time I will use a thick slice rather than half a roma and a little more balsamic. I used lite havarti cheese.

Yum! It was my first attempt at poaching and it took a LOT longer than 2-3min so I clearly did something wrong, however, once it was finished it was really good. Amazing flavor and texture combinations. I also used muenster as I'm not a huge fan of fontina and used tomato slices on others suggestions.

I thought this was pretty good, but really lacked something...basil maybe. Too many other better breakfast dishes to make this one again.

We've made this a couple of times now -- every time for a light dinner with salad. The only thing I have changed is to use very thick slices of tomato rather than half a roma. A great weeknight dinner.

Excellent-we had it for DINNER with a salad. Great!

this is delish but doesn't anyone else have problems with adding white vinegar to the egg water?? That makes them awful and i've tried it 3 times. Usually I crack all the eggs into a dish; swirl the salted, boiling water lower the heat and pour the eggs into the middle. Loosen the eggs when they set and raise the flame. As soon as they start to simmer again, they are done. Vinegar disperses the whites and makes them stick. why is this a "trick" now?

It's a great recipe to make ahead of time. (I poached the eggs well before my guests came, and then I reheated them before serving.) I agree with some of the other reviewers - I will use a bit less tomato next time. But other than that, we all loved it.

Made this for the third time now. I actually made six with portobellas and six with english muffins. The portobellas are superior of course, but I wasn't sure if everyone would eat mushrooms for breakfast. (they did.) but i was difficult not to overcook the eggs with that many. i very much suggest using Muenster cheese, it melted and browned wonderfully and tasted delicious.

I made this the first time a few weeks ago and will be making it again tomorrow .. We loved it , I just happened to have everything on hand to make for Sunday morning breakfast ..

I have made this a couple of times, and it's really good. This weekend I used English muffins instead of the mushrooms, so it was more like Eggs Benedict. But the slices of fontina doesn't melt very well and made a bit of a mess. Did anyone else have this problem?

Delicious, although the stacks were a bit tippy. I poached the eggs in an egg poacher to simplify things.

This recipe is fabulous. I can't believe people care about how Porto(a)bello is spelled... I have made this recipe for everyone from my mother to a teacher at one of the culinary institutes and they all loved it!

It was alright. I think I'd like to try it again... maybe use slices of tomato instead of halves. It was a bit juicy for me and could use more flavor.

I don't really like poached eggs, so I'm going to try this with shirred eggs using the mushroom caps as cups, with cheese and other toppings, and baking them. That sounds a lot tastier. BTW, you shouldn't drain poached eggs directly on paper towels unless you like eating wet paper towel.

Easy to make and fast. Tastes great too. Also is great for any Atkins/South Beach dieters.

While I usually agree with you when it comes to "proper" spellings for things, to be fair, it must also be noted that Webster's English dictionary lists portabella as a perfectly acceptable variant of portobello.

Please be advised that the correct spelling for "Portabella" mushrom is: PORTOBELLO "Portabella" in italian means: NICE DOOR

Really nice brunch dish. I used larger portabellas and 2 tomato halves for each.
