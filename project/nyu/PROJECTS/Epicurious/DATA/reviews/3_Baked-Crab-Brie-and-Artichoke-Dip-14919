Following some recommendations here, I added extra tobasco and a few shakes of some old bay seasoning. Pretty good. I had the brie fully melted down before i baked it, though, and the dip came out "meatier" -- not really "creamy." If I make it again, i'll take care not to fully melt the brie before I bake it.

I served this at a dinner party and it was a huge success but personally it was a little bland for me. Maybe I'll use a little more tabasco next time.

This recipe was actually quite good...but then I added some more food items. I added red bell pepper, jalapenos and instead of getting the expensive brie or leek, I just used an italian blend and green onions. It turned out to be a big success!

Bland does not begin to describe the less-than-impressive character of this dish. I have eaten dips from the freezer case that taste better. This recipe does not do the crab justice. Had it cost less, I would have thrown it out and may eventually have to anyway. My recommendation is to file this recipe under "expensive culinary mediocrity."

Because I was able to heed advice from previous reviews, this dish turned out very well for me and received tons of compliments. Having tasted a sample towards end of prep I agreed that the brie just didn't offer the full kick that this dip needed to make it restaurant quality, and so an additional 1/4 C. of grated parmesan did the trick, plus some extra seasoning (Old Bay). I also think that a high level of ingredient quality helped make it, as the crab I used was freshly steamed and very meaty. Food processor definitely a must on this one, too, otherwise way too much chopping involved!

Agreed that with the rich assortments of ingredients in this recipe it should have taster better. Followed recipe EXACTLY and entire family found it bland and disappointing...you couldn't even taste the crab!

I've made this dip several times and it is always a hit.

I made this for a party and it was a hit. But it is incredibly rich, so you may want to cut the recipe in half if you are serving it with other food or to a small group of people.

Thought it was ok. I feel confident that there is a better crab dip recipe out there.

Why would one omit the crab in this recipe? It's called "CRAB, brie, and artichoke dip"...hmmm, why ever didn't it turn out??? However, WITH the crab, I found it to be quite lovely. Worth making again.

Those who thought that the recipe was runny, yet elected to omit the crab meat, do you think that perhaps the reason that the recipe calls for crab meat is to absorb some of the liquid????? Make this recipe the way it is supposed to be made and it is really, really good. I did add a half of a cup of parmesan cheese. Excellent Fiesta Bowl snack!!!!!! GO BUCKS!!!!!!!!

This is one of my favourite potluck appetizer recipes. I have never brought this to a party (of any size) and had to bring home leftovers. I used the recipe as a starting point and made my own modifications (usually depending on what I have on hand). I always omit the crab, add more artichokes (use a 14 oz can), use one package of frozen spinach, and replace some of the brie with cream cheese and some parmesan. I also add the cream slowly, until it is at a dip consistency that I like. I also "sweat" the leek/onion mixture for quite a while so they are slightly carmelized and almost melting. I have a rather dog-eared copy of this in my own recipe file.

I was a little nervous about making this recipe considering the mixed reviews but with the ingredients I didn't see how it could be bad. I took it to a party and it was a BIG hit! I didn't find it to be "runny" -I substituted some more wine for some of the cream and added about a cup of artichoke hearts. This recipe is a definite keeper.P

Made this last night for friends because the reviews were so good. I thought it was ok, but not fantastic. Used the recipe as is, but with the addition of parmesan sprinkled on top before baking.

It took many trys to perfect this recipe but we finally did it. We omitted the crab altogether, the tarragon, and the Tabasco. 2 small cloves of garlic, only 2 Tbl. parsley, and much less dill. Here's the key, add about a half-cup or so of grated Parmesan when you add the Brie. This will thicken the sauce more and give it a far better flavor. Also, make sure you buy good Brie, it makes all the difference. Hope my tips help, enjoy!

Made this for a party and everyone raved about it. Cut back on the tarragon if you don't care for a heavy tarragon flavor. Worth the work involved!
