I marinated the shrooms for an hour in 1/2 c olive oil, 1/4 c balsamic vinegar, 6 minced cloves of garlic, and 3 tsp dried thyme, with red pepper flakes, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste. I really enjoyed this, the flavors went so well together!!

This was easy and I loved the bleu cheese sauce. However, I thought the portobello mushrooms were a little lacking i flavor. The next time I cook this I might marinate them for a few hours in maybe an olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic mixture.
