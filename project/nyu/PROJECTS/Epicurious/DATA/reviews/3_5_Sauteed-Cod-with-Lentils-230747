I only made the lentils portion because I was in need of a good recipe. Fresh, fast and delicious ! This will definitely be made again, in fact the 5yr old said he loved it !!!!

Made this almost exactly as called for in the recipe and it turned out great. I used halibut instead of cod and dried parsley instead of fresh. I also used precooked lentils from Trader Joe's. Even with these changes the dish was flavorful and filling, and pretty easy to make. Highly probable that I will make this again.

Made this recipe today. It was a hit with my family. My mom says the lentils were the best she had ever tasted. Could not find the French green lentils in my grocery store. Regular lentils were delicious.

I made the lentils as a side dish to simple broiled salmon. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I substituted dried tarragon and a shallot which I added when cooking the onions. Very yummy. My boyfriend and I both had seconds of the lentils.

I made the recipe as directed and it turned out great. Family asked that it be put in the rotation. I would put more parsley in the lentils next time.

I haven't made the fish; I've just used frozen Trident cod instead. But the lentils are delicious and are a great basic recipe. I've made them repeatedly. Make sure to use french green lentils--its like the difference between navy beans and garbonzo beans--significant. Green lentils are firm and difficult to overcook if you are paying any attention at all.

Used the reccomended lentils and found overall a good lentil side dish I cooked the lenitls ahead of time but only for about ten minutes as I did not want mushy lentils as other reviewer mentioned. Had to cook lentils longer than anticipated. I chose to bake the haddock so can not rate the sauteed fish.

Fabulous. I make the lentils almost weekly and will do it with different fish. It also makes a lovely accompaniment to panko crusted scallops.

Delicious -- and it even appealed to picky 14-year-old girls who showed up for dinner at my house! Instead of making the lentils I bought pre-cooked small brown lentils at Trader Joe's and added them to a pan of sauteed onions, garlic and bit of wine. Served with sauteed baby bok choy- a huge hit.

My husband made this for me--and I loved it! It was fresh tasting, nutritious and with a Savignon Blanc, a great treat! I'm cooking it tonight and hope I do as well as he.

Very easy to make and delicious. I would suggest shortening the cook time on the lentils a touch because they cooked more than i expected after adding them to the onions.

Easy weeknight meal. It did lack a little in flavor. After tasting the lentilsI used more lemon in the and added smoked paprika. That helped tremendously. I also dredged the fish in just a little seasoned flour for more browning and we added some malt vinegar on top at the end.

I have made this several times, it is very simple but delicious. I have not been able to find green lentils, but it is fine with the plain brown ones.

An easy way to cook cod is to olive oil a pan and roast it in the oven at 375 until just cooked through (don't forget carry-over cooking). Top each piece with a nob of butter, better yet garlic/herb butter, before roasting and a dash of vermouth, lemon juice, white wine or white balsamic vinegar (or a combination of these) in the pan. Absolutely lovely!

If i make this again , it will be with changes. The lentils were great, but the fish was a little bit chewy.. maybe i cooked it too long, or maybe it is too thick to saute until done all the way through...could anyone recommend an alternative way to cook the fish? If i sear it, and then place the skillet in the oven to bake, would it be better?

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was very bland. Wouldn't make it again.

This was really good as well as simple. My husband, who's not usually a big lentil fan, also enjoyed it. I followed the recipe to the letter for a change and would do so again with the exception that my lentils needed more water as they kept soaking up all the water as they simmered. Classic, tasty, and simple for a weekday meal; a definite make-again with whatever fish looks good at the market.

Delicious. I cut the recipe in half for two, had too much lentils, and should have increased the oil and butter for sauteeing the cod.
