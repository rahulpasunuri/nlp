My stores didn't have veal chops; instead I used scallopini. I lightly coated them with egg, flour, and bread crumbs and fried them for about 30 seconds on each side then continued with the recipe as written. Excellent; but the farrow mixture was absolutely amazing!! Will definetely do this part of the recipe again!

This recipe was a big hit. I made a few changes - I sprinkled the meat with some minced fresh rosemary before searing and also added minced garlic with the shallots. The sauce with the balsamic vinegar was delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

This was truly, a delicious and simple meal! The whole family loved it! Especially the farro! My 8- year-old daughter had thirds. However, to call the farro a ragout seems misplaced, as I find it more like a pilaf. I had to use hard farro so it took more time cooking, but the end result was worth it. Served with a simple salad of carrot and zucchini ribbons. Excellent!

I only made the veal chops (not the farro) but the timing and pan sauce were absolutely perfect. I will make the whole recipe next time!

Flavorful and easy to make. I had to order the farro by mail, but I'll use it again.
