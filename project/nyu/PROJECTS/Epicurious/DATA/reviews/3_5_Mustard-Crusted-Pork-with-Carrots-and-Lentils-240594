Excellent dish - the lentils are the highlight! I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Very easy, yet delicious recipe! Husband and daughter (10) really liked it. Will make this again.

I used squash instead of carrots (didn't preheat) and I cooked the lentils in beef broth instead of chicken. Really delicious and easy to substitute in the ingredients you have on hand.

Very good, I'd give it 3 forks if I'd followed the recipe exactly. To me, the lentils were the best part of the dish and the biggest surprise. I cooked french lentils and combined them with the sauce, some red onions and a little white vinegar - the taste was amazing. For pork, I used extra mustard and panko crumbs per other reviews and the pork tasted great and was moist. Very similar to a recipe I already make though. I am not sure about the role of the carrots in the dish. Looks very nice, but the sweetness was just too bright. I will add balsamic to the roasting pan next time and maybe put the finished carrots into the lentils.

I made this for a week night meal, used dried red lentils and because of timing didn't even make the sauce at the end. We just had the tenderloin encrusted with panko, lentils and carrots. It was moist and delicious. I did mix a bit of garlic vignagrette I had in the pantry with the panko crumbs instead of using olive oil.

Made this for a quick last minute dinner. The pork was delicious and tender. I used 2 tablespoons for the coating, because 1 did not seem enough. Instead of traditional breadcrumbs, used panko. They are japaneses breadcrumbs. My husband and 4 year old twins daughters gobbled it up. I did not care for the lentils and carrots.

Great recipe. I brown the pork and then roast the carrots in the same pan to save on dishes and add a little extra flavor to the carrots.

oh so yummy! My alterations though.... I added a clove of minced garlic to the dijon. I seared the meat and let cool for 5-10 then brushed on the Dijon and rolled in bread crumbs.(would have used panko if I could get them where I live) I would not cook on top of the carrots as the bottom does get soggy, as mentioned by other reviews, so I would roast either on a rack with veg under or in a separate dish. I also added potatoes to the carrots. I used puy lentils and let it simmer for a good 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid nearly evaporated. ( I didn't want soup but nice moist lentils) Do not over cook your pork, take out as it suggests and let sit 10 minutes rather than 5. Pork should be served still pink in the middle and if let sit it will continue to raise in temp.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I needed a quick tenderloin recipe and this one fit the bill. It was quick, easy and enjoyed by all! Instead of the carrots, I roasted broccoli and cauliflower with it.

This dish was great for a nice weeknight meal that's filling and somewhat low in calories. I cut them farther by using only 1 TB EVOO for the roasted carrots and I used the same skillet I seared the pork in to cook the lentils and only added one scant TB of oil to that. I would also recommend starting the lentils after the pork has roasted for about 10 minutes to not overcook them since they call for canned lentils.

I've made this several times, for company and for a weeknight supper. It's easy and really good, and it looks like something that you spent hours on. I've also roasted potatoes with the carrots--a good accompaniment for the juicy pork. Trader Joe's sells some really nice cooked lentils in the refrigerated section.

We love this dish, and it has become a regular in our house. Couple of notes: We use a lot more mustard to brush the pork and we blanch the carrots for 3-4 minutes before roasting as they aren't always cooked all the way (depending on the size of your tenderloin). Also, we use dried lentils, cooking them in chicken stock with the thyme and garlic. I often add a splash of red wine vinegar to the lentils just to boost the acidity of the dish and give it a kick.

This dish was delicious, although I think there are a few things that could be improved. To begin, I browned the pork in olive oil and garlic, set aside, and then used the same pan with the juices to roast the carrots in. I also did not use a specific amount of mustard, but enough generously coat the tenderloin in coarse ground dijon mustard (with whole mustard seeds.) As per another reviewers suggestion, I used panko bread crumbs, too. In the future, though, I would roast the pork in a separate pan maybe even on a rack, instead of in with the carrots, as the bottom of the coating became soggy. Overall this was a very tasty and satisfying meal.

I made the pork roast without the lentils and carrots...although, I would really like to try with the lentils next time. The pork recipe was really delicious!! I will definetly make it again. It's a simple, but flavorful way to change up a dinner staple. Great recipe!

Loved this recipe. It was quick and easy. I cut down on the chicken broth and cooked the lentils for a longer time just to get a little more flavor... I also added a little more mustard to the lentil mixture. The carrots cooked beautifully in the oven, and the pork stayed moist and was delicious.

25 grams of fat per serving--and this is in the "healthy recipe" category??

Was good. But even after I tripled the amount of mustard in the lentils, my husband said he would prefer more mustard. Next time I might add some dried mustard to the breadcrumbs.

This recipe is great. We didn't feel like there were enough lentils...they were soooooooooo gooooood...amazingly good. I sliced baby carrots myself. I added 1 more clove of garlic. I used Panko and deli dijon mustard. This was easy to make and ohhh so tasty. It would have been great to have more left- overs but we snarfed most of it down. I served this with Herb Roasted sweet onions. Next time I'll serve it with collard greens or kale. Delllish!!

I was actually worried the dijon would be obnoxious, but the recipe turned out quite bland. Also, the lentils were quite dry, even with additional broth and cook time. I'd recommend just making lentil soup as a side.

Very quick and easy for an impressive weeknight meal - made this for our 7 month wedding anniversary! I used dried lentils and added about 1 cup more chicken broth (organic, low-sodium) than called for - added in small increments and let it simmer down each time - lentils were very tender. Also used fresh rosemary b/c I didn't have fresh thyme. I cooked the pork to 155 which was a bit to well done for me. Went to a cooking class the night before and the chef recommended pork tenderloin to come out of the over at 145 degrees. His was extremely tender, almost the texture of a fine beef tenderloin. I'll cook this recipe shorter next time to achieve 145 degrees.

The lentils were dry and the pork did not have enough flavor from the mustard. Maybe more mustard?

The pork didn't taste so well and the coating partially came off

Given how little time this takes to make, I was amazed by the flavor. A great weeknight supper. Used panko on the advice of another reviewer - good call. Might cut the carrots a little thicker next time - a few got burned while roasting. Even little kiddies (5 and 2) ate this up!

I've made this with canned lentils and dried lentils both were great. Easy, rave reviews

This was a really nice winter Sunday night supper with a nice glass of wine and salad. My dinner companion said "It's a keeper!". I cut my own carrot sticks and used panko bread crumbs, otherwise followed the recipe.

I rate this 4 forks because it is remarkably tasty for a quick meal. Used dried thyme rather than fresh because it's all that I had- used baby carrots rather than sticks- other than that I followed the instructions exactly. Served with green beans and when plated the whole dish was colorful and impressive!

I almost didn't make because is sounded too easy to be good. I am so glad I did. This is very good, easy, and inexpensive! Also have you noticed how many flavors of mustard are in the supermarket now?? Lots of possibilities.

An entire meal, easy and fast. I used Japanese (panko) bread crumbs, which were light and good. Didn't have canned lentils so used canned small white beans instead. Delicious!

Only made the pork and it was delightful. Cooked it until 155 degrees, removed from oven, put on warmed plate, covered with foil and let sit for 10 min. Temp increased to 165 degrees and was juicy and cooked. Nice change from our reg pork

We would ideally rank it 3 1/2 forks...Did this last night and we loved it! Fast and easy. The lentils were especially delicious - do not skip! Cooked the pork to 155 degrees and let it rest covered for 5 minutes. Perfect! Will definitely do this again.

This was soooo easy and very tasty!!! I needed to cook the pork a little longer than recommended. The lentils were super good. I would also increase the roasting time for the carrots. GREAT!

Good, but there are other recipes that are better on this site. Super easy, very tasty homestyle pork.

Easy and fast, took about 30 mins from start to finish to do the entire meal. Cooked the pork to 165 F and it was just right.

Excellent and quick. I would be sure to turn the carrots when adding the pork or they might burn.

This was great, but if you take it out when the thermometer reads 145 degrees, it will be rare. all the other epicurious recipes for pork tenderloin say to take it out when the thermometer reads 155 degrees. next time i would actually do 165, as the center pieces were mostly pink. i would prefer the meat to be cooked enough so that it is pink in the center but mostly cooked. i know americans like their meat practically oinking, but i've just never been abl to get on board with that. the lentils and carrots were great. i would recommend adding the olive oil to the pork fat in the pan and cooking the garlic and thyme in there. there was this little flap of meat that was not aethetically pleasing on the tenderloin, so i cut that off, cut it in small pieces and fried it before adding the garlic and thyme. the flavors went very well together.
