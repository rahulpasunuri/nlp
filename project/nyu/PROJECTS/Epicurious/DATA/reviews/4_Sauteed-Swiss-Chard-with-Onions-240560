This was very good. I added sauteed mushrooms and cooked up some pork sausage meatballs to add to it. The onions added some sweetness to the greens. Very good!

This was quite delicious! As well as easy. I did find that it did not taste as yummy the next day reheated. But will still definitely make again.

This recipe allows the earthy roasted beet flavors in Chard to shine. The stems had a surprisingly good texture and taste. I reduced the salt and recommend taking care to not over cook the chard. I will do Rainbow Chard like this again, served over eggs and a bagel.

Totally delicious and easy to make. Has a classy appeal to complement just about any entree, yet not time consuming. Everyone loved it -- make extra!

Not sure why my previous review didn't post, but here goes again....I just made this for the second time, and my second time cooking with Swiss Chard! I used this recipe as a starting point, and added the following: Spring Garlic instead of regular, added sliced golden beet and sweet potato to the chard stems, and added parsley and thyme with the chard leaves. I finished off with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and a sprinkling of goat cheese, as some other reviewers suggested. Very hearty and delicious!!

Great quick 15" recipe. Slicing onions and then cooking while chopping up the garlic and chard is a great time saver per a previous reviewer's suggestion. I used salted butter since I was out of unsalted and then used 1/2 tsp which was flavorful enough. I added extra pepper since I'm a fan. TASTY!

very tasty, i have never cooked chard before. i left out the butter and used extra olive oil, also i found you could shorten the prep time by cutting the chard while the onions cooked

Rating: 4
Easy. Delicious. I halved the recipe because I only had one head of chard. But I still put in two cloves of garlic. I cooked the chard just until it wilted. Overcooked shard is not good.

Perfect and simple. I used sweet onion. Make sure you get those onions caramelized, and you'll have an amazing dish.

Rating: 4
Really easy and wonderful. Used rainbow chard. Didn't do all the fancy cutting. Just separated the thick stems (sliced into 1 1/2" lengths) from the slightly thick veins (same method) and cut leaves horizontally into 1 1/2-2" widths. Everything else the same (really get some carmelization on those onions) as per the recipe. At the end, crumbled around 2 oz of tart goat cheese and stirred really quickly before serving (didn't melt it or heat it too much). Much like the folks who added vinegar, I got a nice tartness plus extra richness. Would highly recommend that variation!

Big hit. Used sweet onions which was great, and neglected to see directions regarding stalks before they got trashed, but that didn't bother anyone. Cooked with Roast Beef au Poivre, and sweet potatoes au gratin and it was one of the best meals ever.

Best chard recipe I have--husband loved it too. Reduced the salt a bit, and increased the garlic. I put the balsamic on the table, but the chard tasted so good by itself we never even used it.

Rating: 3
I thought it was good but not amazing- I had to halve the recipe due to the amount of chard I had but didn't appropriately adjust cooking times which could be the reason why. I did take advice from other reviews and reduce the amount of salt and added a splash of balsamic and a bit of shredded aged parmesan reggiano at the end. Served it with a simple grilled chicken and it did nicely. I will try it again, though, and try not to overcook it.

Rating: 4
Eating this delish as I type. Made it ahead with intention of eating it room temp with salmon at lunch, but couldn't resist the aroma and rainbow beauty of the chard warm, even though it will be 98 degrees today. I, too, like acid with my greens, so I added some balsamic to the stems, ribs, and onion mixture just before adding the leaves. Next time I'm adding a diced apple or pear to the saute.

Really good basic swiss chard recipe. The only changes I made was to caramelized the onions before I added the garlic, so good!

Totally savory. My grandmother used to make chard this way, with stalks ("back in the day" they never wasted anything). I reduced salt as per other reviews, and served with freshly grated parmesan. Very easy recipe and reward is a great tasting, as well as great for you, veg!

This is a good basic recipe for chard or any green, but I agree it needs a little acid. A drizzle of balsamic vinegar right before serving definitely brightened the flavor. I think raisins or other dried fruit would also be a nice addition.

We enjoyed this recipe tonight with freshly picked rainbow chard from our garden. It was very good, and might have been a four-star had it not been so salty. I halved the recipe, including the salt and pepper, but think that one addition of salt (when the onions and garlic are being sauteed) would have been more than sufficient. I will definitely try it again, next time with half as much salt!

Just made this tonight, and I'm wondering if there's a little grade inflation happening in the reviews section. With all the four-fork reviews, and with all the chopping and pot-watching required, I thought this would be a really great dish, but it's just OK. And I LOVE greens. I could barely taste the garlic, even though I'd used more than was called for, and the sweetness of the onions overpowered all the other flavors. I agree with the reviewer who said she thought this needed some acid. Next time (and I will try again, because I'm determined to find the perfect chard recipe!), I'll use 6 cloves of garlic, 1 onion (or 2 of a not-so-sweet variety), a little more salt, and a splash of white wine...which makes this not the same recipe but I think will be closer to something that'd earn four forks from me.

I thought this dish needed some acid, so I added a bit of red wine vinegar and sprinkled some red pepper flakes becuase we like things a bit on the spicy side. I'd make it again with those same adjustments.

I love, love, love this recipe. Like others, I have played around with it -- adding bacon, raisins, salted pecans, browning the onions, mixing the chard and onions with ricotta and using it as an omelette filling, etc. -- but in fact, just as written it's the best greens I've ever had.

Very tasty, this recipe helped with the timing. I sprinkled some dried currants in it toward the end and it gave it a nice bite

OK I cheated! I sauted six slices of chopped bacon instead of the olive oil. I also added a chopped granny smith apple. The bacon and apple made a nice flavor, plus I splashed some apple cider vinegar at the end. YUMMY!

A delicious, simple way to prepare swiss chard. I made just one serving and used only olive oil. I also added a couple of sliced nicoise olives at the end.

We are growing swiss chard in the garden and this recipe is the main one I use. It is wonderful. However, because of personal taste I cut the amount of onions way down (1/2 of one medium onion) and doubled the garlic. One of the reasons the onions may have been too dominant is that we were using very fresh swiss chard that cooked down a lot throwing off the balance.

Rating: 4
Very very good. I grew rainbow chard and used a combination of chards and made TONS of the recipe and then froze it. Later it was just as good when reheated. Also, I put some through a food processor, added ricotta and eggs and parmesan, and made a great ravioli filling. This is a fantastic recipe.

Used organic chard freshly picked on the Duchy farm estate, Highgrove, Gloucestershire. This "royal" chard was so sweet! It's a new vegetable for us and we will definitely try it again, fresh out of the ground, and cooked just this way!

i make swiss chard all the time usually sauteing it with a bit of onion/shallot or bacon so i though how much different could this be? WAY different! this particular recipe is the bomb!!! i'll be making chard this way from now on... highly recommended!

Rating: 4
WOW! This is the first I ever cooked chard, and I thought it was outstanding! My husband liked it too. I only had the chard because it was one of the vegetables available at our local biodynamic CSA farm. (Community Supported Agriculture). So it helps that our chard was probably picked from the ground the day before and couldn't be fresher or of better quality. Don't let the taste of it raw turn you off  before you cook it, it tastes like beets because the two species are related. Once it's cooked, it's delicious & nutritious!

Rating: 3
Quite tasty and quick. I made this exactly as written. I found the caramelized onions were a near-perfect complement to the chard, and the variety of textures from the ribs, stems, and leaves was pleasant. I'll definitely make this again, although I think I might try adding bacon instead of onions some time.

Wow! This was really good. So simple yet really perfect. I used red chard and halved the recipe. Mine turned out a bit watery, but the watery stuff was like a very savory broth so I'm not really complaining. I'll be making this again and again.

This is a nice basic recipe for sauteed chard. My changes were to use duck fat from making duck confit in place of the olive oil, red onions, doubled the garlic, and used mixed chard. After tasting during final stage of cooking I too added a few splashes of fig balsamico to add a different note to the flavor. Served over creamy polenta, with a crispy leg of duck confit.

Crazy good. My husband, who never met a leafy green vegetable he didn't hate, asked for more. If you didn't like it, you didn't make it right. I didn't use any butter, just the oil and it was perfect.

QUESTION: I'm thinking of making this dish to serve with Slow-Roasted Duck with Olive Gravy and Garlic- Fennel Confit and with Wild Rice with Wild Mushrooms. What I'd like to do is add some truffle oil (black, probably) to this Swiss Chard dish, as in the Spinach and Mushrooms with Truffle Oil recipe on this site (would prefer to do the chard over the spinach). Do you think the truffle oil will work well with this dish? I'd hate to spend the money on the oil if it sounds like a bad idea. Thanks, and Happy Holidays!

Here it is Nov 4 and I am still picking Swiss Chard. Served it over Mark Bittman's polenta. Let's just say it was a fabulous dish. The carmelized onions made it taste like I had added sugar. I added parmesan cheese to the polenta and used next to no salt. Perhaps I'll get in another harvest before we get a deep frost.

This was a revelation! I never ate chard before and we loved it. My four-year-old ate it until it was gone. I made it a second time and had to avoid onions and garlic so used green onions and it was yummy still. 4-year-old added liberal balsamic.

I have to disagree with all the rave reviews. Made this last night as written with chard from the garden and thought it was just OK. We really like chard, but didn't find that the onion added all that much. It was really pretty bland, and way too buttery for our tastes, as well. If I were to make it again I'd use just olive oil, maybe shallots instead of onions.

Delicious. The 2nd time I made it, I soaked some golden raisins in vermouth and threw those in as well. Wow.

Yum! Used chard right from the garden. It was more tender than store-bought, so it didn't need to cook as long. The stems were outrageous! Only deviation - didn't use butter - just olive oil. Saved the butter for the polenta. Made "buttery Polenta" on this site, adding a little more water and 1/3 c grated parm. Served chard on top of polenta. Beautiful and excellent. Could say it was very italian or southern!

Yummy! Never cooked greens before because Mum didn't serve them. Got a big bunch of swiss chard from the coop so had to dive in. This is simple and delicious. Chard does not have the bitterness of other greens I've been served. Looking forward to the next coop box!

Great recipe. Exchanged onions for shallots and added a bit of white wine and chili powder when the stems were almost done, before adding the leaves

Rating: 4
This was so simple and much more flavorful than I expected. I cooked the stems 2 hours ahead of time, added the leaves, covered it and turned the heat off. Then 5 minutes before serving I turned the heat back on and cooked with the lid on. It was cooked perfectly.

Really delicious, particularly if you let the onions and garlic caramelize well. The sweetness plays off the earthiness of the chard. Let the stems soften really well, too. Definitely in agreement that there's too much salt.

Good recipe, but I it can be simplified in the prep process as it all gets wilted anyway. I salt & peppered to taste and was happy with just enough oil/butter to coat. Less detailed prep made it easy and quick to make on a week night.

This was by far, the best chard recipe I've tried. I was shocked to see my husband go back for seconds; he is notorious for not enjoying anything with leafy greens. So good yet so simple.
