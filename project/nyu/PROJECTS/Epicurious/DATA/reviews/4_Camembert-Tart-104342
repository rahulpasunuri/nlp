This is delicious. It's my go to brunch recipe. It bakes up all golden and puffy and is very impressive looking-- and tasting. Easy as pie...no pun intended.

This is one recipe I keep using over and over! Yummy, cheesy and delicious!

I used a frozen pie shell, fat free half and half, and a little less camembert cheese. It was easy, quick, and very rich. I might try it with brie next time as I find camembert a little strong for me. The recipe didn't indicate but I did cut off the rind.
