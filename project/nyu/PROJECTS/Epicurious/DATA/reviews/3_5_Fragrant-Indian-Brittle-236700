Excellent party snack! I made a few changes, but the result was still awesome (as evidenced by the party goers from India that loved this snack). 1. I used ground cardamom since cardamom pods could not be found in my small community. 2. I used whole almonds rather than sliced to give this more of a bulky, chunky texture. 3. I used Silpat pads instead of parchment and avoided the greasy residue/stuck parchment paper others complained about. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

A friend has made this with great success each year at the holidays, and this year I gave it a go. After reading other reviews, I stirred often, and took it off the heat when it was a dark caramel color. I think it was around 320 at that point. Rolled out just fine and has great crunch. I used the eight cardamom pods recommended in the recipe, and if anything would add a few more.

I make this every holiday. Delicious!

anyone else have an issue with the parchment not coming cleanly off the brittle? I oiled as per instructions.

Made this for gift giving and could have eaten all of it by myself! Used mixed nuts called pistachios' lover mix. Was salted so did not add additional to brittle. Did not chop nuts or roll top-just had beautiful coated whole nuts. I'm in process of making second batch!!!!

This is great. I've never tried to make candy before, and don't have a thermometer. But it is perfect, even though I was winging it on the temp. Didn't have corn syrup so doubled the honey, used perhaps a bit extra cardamom and salt, and pumpkin seeds in place of the almonds. Beautiful to look at, easy to make, and very tasty! If I make it again (and I'll have to, as I made it for gifts but keep going back to the tin for just one more little bit...) I might throw in the cayenne suggested by another reviewer or find something else to complement the cardamom.

I haven't made this yet, but since one of the reviewers mentioned that nuts were expensive, I wanted to suggest going to an Indian grocery store. The nuts are MUCH cheaper there, and you can get them in quantity. They sell shelled pistachios, too.

Delicious. Might need a bit more cardamom. And I wonder if the ground spice, which most cooks have in their rack, is a good substitute for crushed seeds fresh from the pod. I was able to get the mixture up to only about 325 degrees in the pan I was using, but I think that was enough.

I found the cardomom a bit overpowering in this recipe. After reading the reviews about stuff burning at 350F, i changed the order of the recipe a little bit. I cooked the sugar, corn syrup and water to 350F, and then let it drop to 310 before adding the rest of the ingredients. this worked well, and nothing burned.

I think we've all been there at one time. About the recipe -- I wonder if you could put some dried cranberries in with the nuts. My mother loves cranberries and pistachios in combination and Mother's Day is almost here.

A tasty variation on regular peanut brittle. I used a can of mixed nuts instead of carefully measured amounts. I look forward to making again.

After reading previous reviews I only took this to 300F and it turned out super yummy. I had no problems rolling it out or scoring it into lovely little pieces. The cardamom and honey make this brittle unusual and a keeper.

I almost burned this! 350 is way too high. 295 is much better. Cardamom is way too pungent - 4 pods would suffice.

Made the recipe as called for with a candy thermometer and it turned out fine. Not usually fond of cardomon but liked the exotic taste. Looked pretty on holiday plates

after burning the first batch, i figured out that if you stir it constantly you can actually get the temperature up to 350. the brittle has a nice texture and good flavor, though i may actually use more cardamom the next time. maybe my pods were old?

I have made this twice so far. Once to the suggestions of cooking to 285, which i found it to be a little undercooked.. it was still sticky to the teeth.. it needed to be cooked to the brittle stage instead of the hard candy stage..... As for the cardamon.. i used 8 pods.. and other than the stickiness.. it seemed the cardamon was just about right. The second time I made it.. i cooked it to about 310/315,, right when it begins to carmelize and turn golden. I also added about 1/8 teaspon of cayenne pepper.. and increased the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.. The end result was much better in my opinion.. the cardamon only is a bit one note.. and i love spicy sweets :)

I agree with the other reviewers regarding the cooking temperature. My sugar mixture started to burn at 325F and I had to slowly pour the burned sugar into a large pot of cold water to solidify so I could safely throw it away. I tried the recipe again but cooked my mixture to 300F (hard crack on my candy thermometer) and used about half a teaspoon of some old cardamon I had, so the cardamom flavor was not too strong. I also used some pecans in place in some of the other nuts since I had them in the house. I served the nut brittle with my Christmas cookies as an accent and recieved a lot of compliments. I would definitely make the recipe again, but with the modifications.

I agree with previous reviews that this should only be cooked to 300. Beyond that it is a burned mess. I used the full amount of spice and it was very good. I am including this in my Christmas gifts.

Fantastic! At another reviewer's suggestion, I only cooked it to 300 and used less cardamom. A half teaspoon was definitely plenty. Perfect consistency and a nice holiday treat.

At 350 my brittle burned, which made it inedible. I only later consulted other brittle recipes that call for sugar to be cooked to 285. Also the cardamom is really pungent. 1/2 tsp may be enough. Such a pity to waste all those expensive nuts!
