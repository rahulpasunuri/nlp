I never usually write reviews, but I had to save someone from making this, unless they make the alterations some other readers suggest, which I'm sure are great. My husband and I couldn't eat it - it was way too salty and the sherry taste was overpowering. I ended up adding a squeeze of orange to take the bitterness of the orange peel down a notch. Be very careful when making this, and maybe try the marinade before to be sure it suits yoU!

This recipe was way too salty (I even omitted the "salt and pepper" step). Also, the broccoli should be added AFTER the sauce reduces or the broccoli will shrink considerably. I would add some black bean paste and use far less soy sauce. Might try this again with some more tweaks. The orange flavor needed more sweetness to bring it out.

This is an excellent every day recipe. I used a small sirloin steak I had in the fridge and since it was already tender, I did not marinate for very long (no time). I think I would add mushrooms next time but not ginger.

This is a perfect basic stir fry sauce recipe. I add ginger to this often for a kick. It works well with tofu, beef and chicken. Enjoy!

Made it with big cubes of Ahi Tuna because that is what I had on hand. Delicious. As others said, don't add any salt. Maybe even try low sodium soy? And I may have ben heavy handed with the honey. Because the fish is good less cooked, I sauteed everything together at the same time. Worked great, leaving delicious pink tuna in the middle.

As other reviewers suggested, I added 1 T chopped ginger and some red pepper flakes. I also added 1 T of Worcesteshire and 1 T of oyster sauce. Absolutely fab. My family devoured it. I usually don't review the recipe if I didn't follow it exactly but I did taste the marinade with just the 5 ingredients and it was rather bland. Warning: Don't add any salt to this recipe!

This is an okay/good recipe. Needs salt and the ginger would have been good, but I didn't have it on had. I was working with what was on hand. So for a last-minute meal this is a good one. Not a recipe for entertaining, just a good everyday recipe.

I have to say, I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was pretty bland. My homemade eggrolls ended up being the main course as neither my husband nor I finished the beef & broccoli. I think maybe next time I'll add some ginger to the marinade, & some hot pepper flakes to give it a little kick. That being said, it wasn't horrible. Just needs a little doctoring up.

I made this with chicken and also added zucchini, carrots and green pepper. Per others' suggestions, I added a generous amount of finely minced ginger and also a bit of garlic. We loved it.

Great easy recipe. I did as others have mentioned and added 1/2 Tbs. of Ginger and a dash or two of oyster sauce and the dish was a great success. I added 2 heads of broccoli but that is because our family loves more veggies then meat in our dishes. With 2 heads of broccoli it came out even meat to veggies.

listening to other reviewers, I added a tablespoon of grated ginger. Also added a little sesame oil and oyster sauce to the oil. It was excellent!

Was good. Kids LOVED it!! Used lemon instead of orange, doubled garlic (my fam loves garlic, added about 2 cloves to hot oil) and substituted leftover chicken for beef. Would agree with others that it needs a bit of ginger. Oh, and I also cooked meat, removed, fried broccoli in wok then added meat back in. Who has time for more dirty dishes...

An American version of Beef N Brocolli that tastes like something from the 60's when mainstream America had yet to awaken to its epicurean renaissance: too much sauce, no zesty flavor (though it calls for orange zest), nothing bright or elegant about this recipe. My whole family was appalled at the recipe, not its execution. Definitely not a keeper.

Actually, if I could, I would rate this 2 1/2 forks. It's good, not tremendous. Everyone at the table enjoyed it, and it's very fast. Used lemon instead of orange rind, because that's what I had.

This is simple and not that bad, although I agree that it is missing something, and next time I'll go for it. I think It needs some cashews as well as oyster sauce. A little chili oil or crushed peppers too.

This recipe needs two ingredients very badly: oyster sauce and fresh ginger. This way it's much too bland and uninteresting. Check out the Beef, MUSHROOM and broccoli stir-fry on this site, it is the real thing.

Made this last night, was ok. It really was missing something. The dish needed a little zing, something to brighten it up. Don't think I'd bother to make it again, there are plenty of other beef and broccoli recipes to try.

A really tasty and easy dish to make, especially for 2 people. My wife loved it! I'd recommend adding a bit more broccoli, maybe another 1/2 head. And I substituted chicken for beef (two boneless, skinless breasts totaling 1 lb.) and is was still fantastic!

I used a pound and a half of meat and did not have to alter the recipe to compensate. I used red wine in place of sherry. The meat marinated for a day and a half in a ziploc bag. We did not find it too salty; the flavors of the marinade in the meat were mild. It looks and tastes like something you worked hard on!

Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I took 1 bite and threw up. WARNING! DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE! YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This dish was incredible. Three and a half forks for this superbly tasty recipe. I used one and a half times the meat, so I doubled the sauce recipe. The following modifications came out really well: merlot instead of sherry, 1 tbsp of orange juice per sauce recipe instead of peel, and put half the garlic the recipe calls for in the pan with the oil instead of the sauce.

I'm willing to chalk this up to a matter of taste, but I did not care for this dish at all. My husband said it was ok but it was WAY to salty for me. I even used reduced sodium soy sauce. It looked pretty but was very bland. I did only have time to marinate for an hour so that could've been part of the problem. I'll never know, though, because I won't be making it again.

I followed the lead of the cook from Coudersport, PA. Her additions were fantastic. The sauce came out a little too sweet -- but I sort of estimated the honey so it may have been a problem on my end. Definitely a keeper -- a great fast weekeday recipe.

I doubled the sauce recipe and added more garlic (about 3 cloves) and 2 tsp of grated ginger. Only used 1 tsp of grated orange peel total and that was plenty, more would've overwhelmed the other flavors. I also added chicken breast and shrimp. My family loved it and wondered "when are you making this again, mom?" I marinated the chicken and beef for 4 hours total. This will become a "regular" in rotation at our house!

I've made this several times, and it's really a great weekday quick dinner. I invariably find myself without an orange, so I use orange juice instead although I'm sure it's not quite as good. I also toast sesame seeds in sesame oil before adding the beef to the saute pan. Definitely worth the effort. Very tasty.

Very tasty! I also thought the orange flavor was a bit strong -- I'm going to try substituting ginger next time. Overall, though, I liked it very much.

I was only able to marinate it for 1 hour, and it lacked flavor. I had to add more soy sauce, sugar, ginger and a little water. Not horrible...not great.

We made this with leftover flank steak. I added it after the broccoli. I thought the orange flavor was a touch strong so next time I would make with 1 tsp orange peel. Very good flavor.

I am the head chief of Sheik Abdul Allele, in the Persian Gulf. Yes his Highness loves his Chinese food very much and this one is a strong favourite of his, and so simple for me, all of his 38 wives enjoy it as well. The alcohol is a big No No here. No wine.

I used dry red wine instead of the sherry, and left out the orange zest. I'll definitely be adding this to our regular repertoire.

There was something about the sherry with the beef that I didn't like too much. I've made better. I would try lime juice instead of the sherry next time.

Great, simple weeknight recipe. Few tips though. First, dry the meat real well so that it browns, not steams. Second, forget blanching the broccoli. Who needs another dirty pot. Just remove the meat to a bowl after stir-frying, then fry vegetables. Add marinade and simmer a few miuntes to cook. Return meat and acccumulated juices to re-warm. Keeps veges nice and crisp!

I enjoyed the flavor of orange in the stir fry, it was a nice change.

Quick and easy, but the 1/4 cup soy sauce was too salty. I'd substitute 1/8 cup beef broth for half the soy, and add some fresh grated ginger to the hot oil at the beginning. Oh, and I made this with bell pepper and shiitake mushrooms to add a little variety.

Being a mom on the go, I pre-cut all the veggies, marinated the beef, and stir-fried the next day for a super-quick, delicious meal.

The marinade is very easy to make and has a good flavor. Next time I might use a bit less orange rind. Good simple dish.
