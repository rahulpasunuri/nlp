These should be called Italian Snickerdoodles. Way too buttery and they grow a bunch during baking. Don't even think about making a shape other than a circle. My stars and angels are clumps. A 2 1/2 " diameter round cutter grows into a 3 1/4" cookie. I do like the lemon and anise flavor though.

These were fine. Halfway thru prep I realised that I had no aniseed left so used 5 spice powder, which went well with the lemon. The dough was very sticky and hard to manage. I will try again using aniseed and maybe controlling the amount of lemon juice better. Worth a try.

So-So. Although they were easy, I was unimpressed by the taste. They tasted like a slightly different shortbread cookie.

I made these in a star shape with a silver cachous ( not sure of the spelling sorry ) and they were really delicious. Looked pretty and tasted nice too. Only good things to say about these little cookies :)

These cookies are fabulous. My fiance is of Mexican descent, and was the one who first told me what a "biscochito" was. His mom, who passed away fourteen years ago, used to make them for him. I was thrilled to find this recipe that is like his mother's. He loves them, and so do his children and mine. They are a very crip cookie. One word of advice...the dough is sticky, so it's helpful to put it in the fridge between batches.

Crispy, yet chewy, with an unexpected burst of flavor. Delightful!

My personal favorite of the new Christmas cookie recipes I tried this year. Watch the oven temp: I burned the first batch! I dropped the temp by 25 and started watching them around 10 minutes to be sure. (I used cowboy shapes too: strangely appropriate!)

This is the second Holiday I am making these cookies. They are a lot of fun if you make them in cowboy type shapes. Plus they are a nice change from the standard. With so many cookie recipes out there I don't do repeats unless they're really good!!
