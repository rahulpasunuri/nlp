I have used this recipe several times and I have even substituted chicken for fish filets cut into small pieces. The kids love it and its healthy.

I was concerned about other reviewers saying that this recipe was a bit bland so I made a simple balsalmic vinaigrette and added a couple spoons of black olive tapenade. I used homemade whole wheat breadcrumbs and added Herbs de Provence rathern than any of the standalone dried herbs the recipe called for. I also lightly tenderized the chicken with a mallot. I ended up pan frying them-- it was only two tablespoons of olive oil--and cooked them for about 5 minutes less than the recipe called for (the meat was still cooked all the way through). The end result was delicious and very easy. I will definitely make these again for my toddler--and for me.

while my husband i thought these were delicious, my twin toddlers hated the slight tangy taste that came from the vinaigrette

Great quick recipe. I'm a college student so I love finding fast recipes that also tastes good. I had this with the Honey mustard sauce recipe. Will make again.

Our family loves this. It is quick and straight-forward. I use a balsalmic viniagrette which adds a nice flavor. I cut the chicken in very thin slices and it cooks really quickly.

The best chicken nuggets ever. They are easy and delicious. They definately beat the nuggets you purchase in the freezer section or fast food restaurants. My kids, husband & I loved them. You should try them!

Are you serious? Completely cook the 1 inch cubes of chicken in chicken broth, then bake for 20 minutes at 400, or bake 1 inch cubes of chicken for 40 min at 400. I am surprised you could still bite into the chicken after cooking it that long. A 1 inch cube of chicken will cook in minutes at 400 degrees. I would hate to eat at your house.

I saw this recipe and wanted to make it right away. We do a lot of cooking with italian dressing at our house so when I saw vinagrette I immediately substituted it in. They were really easy, quick to throw together and tasted great. best chicken nuggets i have tasted!

I rated this recipe on the ingrediants listed and how I believe it will taste. This sounds like a very good recipe. The only thing I will change when I make it is I won't fry them. I don't like to fry anything...messy cooking when you fry. I will just bake it in the oven. My recipe for chicken nuggets are cut chicken breasts into large cubes or 1 inch thick strips. Cook chicken in a frying pan using 1 cup of chicken broth seasoned with garlic powder and mrs. dash orig.table blend. After chicken is fully cooked, Take Italian seasoned bread crumbs and place as much as needed into a baggy. Place chicken peices in with bread crumbs and shake till coated well. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 min. till crispy in a 375-4OOoF oven.(This is great to make and put in a freezer container to have great chicken nuggets avail. for lunch any time, quickly,by heating in a microwave or in the oven.) OR Cut chicken into pieces, coat chicken pieces with melted butter, or chicken broth, or just plain old water. Put bread crumbs in a baggy, add chicken, shake until well coated. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 375 to 4OO degrees F. for 4O min. check to make sure no pink is left and chicken is completely cooked. When I find out how to post my recipes here to be reviewed I won't keep adding my own in with my review of a recipe (Sorry for doing that :oI )
