This is my wife's birthday present, and has been, since 1999. It is her favorite meal. We typically make a double bath of the breadcrumb mixture, as we both like the addition.

Great with pork chops. I used lots of fresh sage, and store bought panko. Will increase amount of crumb mixture next time. My parents loved it, and have asked for the recipe.

Delicious and so easy to make. Next time I would add a lot more sage.

This was delicious. I made it exactly as written. The only thing I would change for next time is to make sure the cheese is at room temp so it doesn't take so long to melt in the hot pasta.

I'm sorry to be the dissenter here, but I really didn't like this. The flavor was OK, but traditional (bechamel + gruyere) recipes are much better. And, I really didn't like the crunchy breadcrumbs.

This dinner turned out excellent!!! For the crumble I added onions and didn't really follow the directions using much more sage and garlic then it called for. I also used large shells instead of macaroni. I liked this better because I felt like it held the cheese and crumble better. Add the cheese to the pasta only right before you are ready to serve or else it separates, it still tastes good but looks kinda messy. Overall AMAZING!

This was a fabulous recipe, but I did dress mine up. I sauteed garlic in the butter (to which I'd added 1 T olive oil) before adding bread crumbs and substituted dried rosemary for the sage. I added pine nuts to the bread crumbs about 1/2 way through the cooking. I added a couple T half and half to the cheeses to make the mixture a little more creamy before adding pasta. Lovely!

It was great! I used campanelle instead of elbow macaroni and used shredded parmesan instead of grated. Will definitely make this again!

This is so yummy! The sage topping was good, but next time I am going to use some other fresh herb and see how that tastes, maybe basil. I made half with low-carb pasta and that even tasted good, but the egg noodles were, of course, better.

So good - It's a nice dish in the winter - so creamy and earthy.

This was really good. I ate the whole thing myself in one sitting! It only took ~20 minutes to make. I added some grated cheddar along with the other cheeses. Next time I will make wayyyy more of the sage-breadcrumb mixture, it was delicious.

This is a four fork recipe because it's so easy and so good. Didn't change a thing.

I made two mistakes with this recipe. One, I used store bought bread crumbs and two, I used dried Sage. I know...big mistake! I wanted to try this recipe so bad and didn't have the fresh on hand so I opted for the other. I enjoyed this dish but it was a little heavy with all that mascarpone cheese. I'd try it again but will hold out for fresh bread crumbs & fresh from the garden sage. I bet this dish will be a winner when I make it the "right" way :)

This was definitely easy and delicious, although the mascarpone made it pricy, as well. Peas on the side were a nice complement -- thank-you to the chef who mentioned them. I also used a ton of sage (maybe double what the recipe calls for) with good results.

The way I made this, I would rate it 3 1/2 forks. I minced up one clove of garlic and sauteed that in the butter first. Next, I added about 1 1/2 cups of leftover cooked chicken with the sage and breadcrumbs. It was a great and delicious way to use up leftovers. Also, I used vermicelli instead of elbow macaroni. This was a wonderful quick meal.

This was a quick dish for supper. I really like fresh sage and when I make it next time I intend to add the sage leaves to the butter for about 30 seconds before the crumbs - just to make the flavor a bit more intense.

We thought this dish was quite tasty. The next time I make it I'll use about half the amount of macaroni. We had LOTS left over.

I increased the amount of cheese I used by adding grated romano, too. We love cheese. I had to use store bought bread crumbs which was a mistake. After being browned they took on a grainy texture that I don't really care for. Overall it was very good. My husband loved it! So, did the dogs. We had a little left over. It would be very good with peas and sliced ham mixed in.

I made this dish for a vegetarian friend of mine for dinner and she loved it, as did I, and it was very easy to make.
