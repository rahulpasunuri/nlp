Very very good recipe. It strongly resembles my family recipe that goes back a number of generations. The simplicity of the ingredients may be misleading to some because of a seeming "lack in seasoning". In reality, there is most certainly no lack in flavor or texture. The transformation of the ingredients is amazing in how they blend together to produce something truly worth the effort, time, and money. It can (and is) also be made with maple syrup in place of the maple sugar, if the sugar form is too difficult to find or too expensive to purchase.

This looks to be the same recipe (or extremely close) as one I have tried for traditional tarte au sucre d'erable. As the author whose book I got my recipe from pointed out, eggs were too valuable a commodity in colonial Quebec to be used to set a common pie. Maple sugar pie is surprisingly not as sweet as you would think, considering the filling is almost all maple sugar. The flavour is intensely maple, and the consistency like a very good quality soft fudge. Serve with a good pour of heavy cream, and you have a little piece of maple heaven.

This is a traditional tarte au sucre from Quebec- it is extremely sweet, but delicious- we look forward to eating it in the Gaspe every summer- Best if served warm with vanilla ice cream!

To the cook below: where does it say this is a maple "custard" pie? It's a maple sugar pie and this is a very traditional French-Canadian method.

How can there be a custard without eggs? FLOUR in the mixture instead? Yuck.

A very simple recipe that makes a tasty pie. The result is a custard that is sweet and smooth. We served it warm with french vanilla ice cream and really enjoyed it! The presentation needs a little help...
