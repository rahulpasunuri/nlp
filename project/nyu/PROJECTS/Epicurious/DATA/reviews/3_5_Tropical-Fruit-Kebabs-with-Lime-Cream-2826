Super easy, refreshing and simple. You really can add any fruit.

This came out very well using creamy white yogurt, instead of sour cream (which is almost impossible to find where I live). You should omit the sugar, as this type of yogurt is usually already sweetened. The lime taste was quite pleasant and pronounced, using the amount called for in the recipe. I made the kebabs with pineapple, mango, and banana. Another more colorful fruit would have been a nice touch, but the papaya I bought was flavourless and I threw it out rather than use it. Perhaps kiwi would go well. A note to keep in mind for future reference is to buy mangoes and papayas about a week in advance, as those found in the grocery store are often immature.

I gave this recipe 3 forks only because of the major changes I made to the recipe. After making it according to the recipe, all I tasted was sour cream. Not wanting to just give up on the recipe, I kept adding more of the other ingredients. I ended up using about 15 tablespoons of lime juice, 6 tablespoons of sugar, and 4 teaspoons of very finely grated lime peel. Those changes made the dip very flavorful, a beautiful pale green color, and not too sweet. I served this with a variety of fruit but found that this pairs best with more citrus fruits like pineapple,oranges, etc. Grapes, cherries and strawberries were good too. With those changes, I'd definitely make this again.

Good, but nothing special. This recipe definitely depends heavily upon having top-notch fruit. I would like more lime flavor in the cream. Also, the skewers could do with a little more color.

Brought it to a pot luck and several people asked for the recipe. Didn't use the same fruits, but still good.

I just sliced up some tropical fruit and served the lime cream for dipping. Very refreshing and easy way to round out a Latin, South American menu. You could make this cream any flavor like lemon, orange, etc. I liked the combination of dipping pineapple into the lime cream. Perfect for a light summer dessert, that couldn't be more simple

Just tossed fruit in a bowl and served with lime cream on the side. AMAZING

We thought this dish was overrated. The fruit kebabs are an interesting idea, and make for a beautiful presentation, but the lime cream left much to be desired. We preferred the fruit on its own, and might make the kebabs again without the lime cream.

I added strawberries for color. The Lime Cream was delicious; very refreshing.

I loved this recipe! Its so great just for a snack with any kind of fruit, especially for after school since I'm still in high school. The lime cream gets better over time. If you like lime, you'll love this. Besides, its so easy to make!

The lime cream is what really makes this recipe. I substituted low-fat yogurt instead of the sour cream and it was fabulous! I didn't bother with the skewers, just put out the fruit in a hostess tray with lots of toothpicks.

I actually just made the lime cream to go with my friend's fruit salad. It was delicious!

I liked it but my dinner guests raved about it and it seemed to be the general consensus that the lime cream sauce was what made these little fruit skewers a hit. I also added a maraschino cherry on the end of each skewer for color. It is definitely a beautiful and delicious addition to an appetizer spread.

The flavors of this dish are wonderful, but it was difficult to get the fruit to stay on the skewer without slipping off.
