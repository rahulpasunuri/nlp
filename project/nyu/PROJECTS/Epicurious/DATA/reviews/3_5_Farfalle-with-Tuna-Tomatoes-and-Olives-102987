Recipe is ok, but if you add white wine, lemon juice and garlic it will be even better! (And offcourse use tuna packed in oil, much better..)

very easy and good. A little salty the first time around but that is easy to correct. Added capers, toasted pine nuts, and garlic powder.

I was surprised about this one. The smell of anchovies was strong for me, but it tasted great!

It doesn't get much easier than this. If I were to make this again, I'd use it as a first course for four or as a lunch for two or three. Dishes like these don't really fly in my house as dinner because we all get tired half way thru the plate of the same flavors bite after bite after bite.

I had high hopes for this dish-easy and items are usually on hand. My husband and I thought this was a decent last minute dinner but neither one of us ate the leftovers. My daughter who loves everything would not eat more than a couple bites. We love all the ingredients but together it was just too much.

I'm giving this a 2 because it wasn't horrible, but I would not make it again. I got some sashimi grade (absolutely wonderful) canned tuna and thought this would be a great way to showcase it. Not to be a jerk, but it tasted like a "high end tuna helper".

It looks great but could use more olives and maybe even more anchovies. Otherwise, I loved it!

This recipe was easy and very tasty. A word of caution - be careful when adding the anchivoies to the oil becasue it splattered like crazy!

Great flavor -- and don't be afraid of the anchovy -- it balances everything out! I also used the paste, a conservative 2 Tbsp olive oil, but increased the amount of olives (use pitted kalamatas, saves time). Doubled it, too. We like a little more sauce w/pasta. Easy and very good!

A rare "4 forks" from many recipes tested from here. It deserves such a high rating becuase of its ease to make relative to how great the taste is! I used pre-sliced olives and anchovy paste which made the recipe even faster and easier to make.

This was very good. I omitted the anchovies and also the olive oil, resulting in a somewhat lighter dish. I also made three servings of pasta instead of two with the same amount of sauce and was still stuffed by the end. With such assertive flavors, a simple dessert of fresh fruit is welcome and makes for a very healthful but satisfying meal.

Incredible easy nutritious dinner! My husband made yummy sound from first forkfull to last. I added toasted pine nuts this time and started dreaming up other modifications: herbed tomatoes, add feta, add garlic.

I didn't have quite the amount of olives called for, but after tasting it, added some capers which I thought worked very nicely. I would probably cut down on the oil if I made this again. I was looking for something different from Mom's Tuna Noodle Casserole, and this was a nice change a very tasty.

I like this dish mostly because it's so easy and so quick to put together. I whipped it together after a long drive home with my mother, and she loved it. I didn't use anchovies but I think I used a good substitute: A tablespoon or so of Ken's Lite Caesar dressing, which has some anchovies in it.

Wonderful! This dish was really easy to prepare. It was very flavorful. Farfalle is such a terric noodle.My husband isn't a fan of anchovies, he thought it tasted a little fishy. I may try it without them next time.

I was very happy with this dish. It took less than half an hour (even the first time)and was incredibly flavorful, given how little effort it took to make.

A little too many olives. Half would do. Otherwise, quick and delicous.

This is a really good recipe, even without the anchovies. My wife hates them, so I made the sauce without them and then added one fillet mashed on my plate. Definitely easy and make again, maybe next time with the anchovies.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I both thought it was fantastic. It's so fast and easy to make, but it's really flavorful. I used 2 tablespoons of anchovy paste instead of the fillets b/c I had the paste already. Also, next time I will double the amount of olives, at my husband's request. He also thinks it would be great with capers, but since I can't stand capers, I'll let him add them to his portion after it's cooked! Really, this is a great, easy recipe that I plan to make often.
