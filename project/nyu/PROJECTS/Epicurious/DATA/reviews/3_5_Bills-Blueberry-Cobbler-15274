I had some wonderfully fresh blueberries from Michigan that I bought at the Farmer's Market. I did what everyone suggested and reduced the butter to 4 tbls and the sugar to 1/2 cup. and used Skim Milk. I added lemon juice and some lemon zest. I also added a peach chopped (also from the Farmer's Market). It turned out SOOO good! The crust get crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. It's very easy and very tasty!! I only rated it 3 forks because the original recipe wasn't so great with so much sugar and butter. But the way I made it was perfect.

A little too much butter is an understatement. A total waste of blueberries. Can't even imagine adding the fat in ice cream to this. BIG disappointment!

Made as directed; super simple, no mixer and no egg! Served warmed with no topping and the group devoured it in five minutes. Will make again and try with only 1/2 stick of butter to see how it turns out...would like to try it with other fruit as well. Very Very Easy.

Been making this for a couple of years every Spring/Summer when blueberries are abundant. Love it. Always cut down on the butter (i use SmartBalance sticks) nutmeg and sugar. Not like a traditional cobbler in the least but it is a delicious, easy dessert.

My children and I did not care for the flavor but my husband said he liked it. It did not remind me of any cobbler I had tasted before. I like the down home kinda cobbler...which this was not. Wont be making this anytime soon. The nice thing was that it was very easy to make.

I usually make - and like - a more biscuit-like cobbler, so I was a little skeptical about this version, even with all the positive reviews. As a previous reviewer suggested, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 4 tablespoons butter, and I also used skimmed milk. Over all, this was probably a lot lower in calories than my usual cobbler, and just as satisfying in its own way. Delicious!

Couldn't be easier, you really just plop things together! Butter is deathly delicious, but would be just fine with less. Don't omit the nutmeg, it is really fantastic.

I just made this last night and, while we enjoyed the flavors very much, I had a problem with the blueberry "center," which ended up with raw batter in it even after cooking for the right amount of time. The "cake" around the blueberries was delicious and completely baked, but the blueberries in the middle were almost ruined with runny, uncooked batter. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time), I'll mix the blueberries and batter a bit before baking. Hopefully that will fix the problem.

Um, wow. I used frozen blueberries and a bit less butter on everyone's recommendation, and it turned out very very well. More than that, it looked impressive.

Oi, we didn't like this! I had to substitute shortening for the fat and I cut down on the sugar as per others' suggestions but otherwise did it as written...the pastry came out what I'd consider weird for cobbler and the spice taste was too strong for me. It was better the 2nd day with milk. Guess I'm just wishing for Grandma's cobbler at the lake!

Reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons but I think it was still too much. I reduced the sugar to just a little over 1/2 cup, which yielded the perfect amount of sweetness. Used frozen blueberries. Substituted almond milk for regular milk, and it worked out well. I made this for a dinner party, and my guests loved it. I would definitely make it again but with less butter.

I've made this recipe to great reviews from my family--especially my husband. It couldn't be easier to make, and it's great for berries that may have been in the fridge for a few days. It's yummy with vanilla ice cream right after it comes out of the oven.

First, I don't bake, ANYTHING. I was looking for a recipe so I could use an enormous amount of blueberries we had that were about to go bad. I had all of these ingredients on hand so I gave it a try. Was so very easy and turned out just fine. I used 1/2 c splenda and 1/2 cup sugar and used probably a 1/3c of I Can't Believe it's Not Butter. Threw in a little lemon zest and juice with the blueberries. My husband and 18 month old loved it and ate it for the next three days. Was so simple and good that I am making tonight for a dinner party

Rating: 3
This was a great quick and easy dessert for a Friday night dinner with friends. I did cut the butter down to half a stick, added the zest of one lemon to the blueberries, and added a healthy teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter. It turned out so well and was great with vanilla ice cream! I'll try this later in the summer with peaches.

Made this for a group of 30 people . . .it was a hit. When the professional cook in the group asked for the recipe, I knew I struck gold on this one. Used 1/2 stick of butter (as suggested), 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, lemon zest and some of the juice of the lemon per recipe. I made 4x the amount in two 9 x 13 baking dishes. It was fast and easy . . .and perfect for the 4th of July weekend.

WAY too rich; I'd cut out at least tbsp butter. Besides that, it's just not anything special.

This recipe is super easy to make, you really can't beat it time-wise. I would definitely cut back on the sugar next time, it was a little too sweet for my taste. I did add lemon zest to the dry ingredients and I used thawed, previously frozen Maine blueberries and it turned out really well! The crust to me, tasted more cakey-almost like a pineapple upside down cake crust. Certainly not a "traditional" cobbler, but tasty just the same!

Rating: 3
More From Me. I tested this recipe tonight to see what the crust "issue" is. It's a fine crust! It's not the traditional cobbler crust, but a fine and tasty crust. (I added almond extract and extra cinnamon.) The recipe is very easy. Much more so than my usual recipe. I think if I were to put some fruit around the edges of the batter where the thicker crisping occurs, it may alleviate that problem. Though I love the recipe, I want a cobbler crust that's a little more traditional.

This is a srange recipe (the method seems very odd) - but wow! Yum! And it's so simple. The combination of blueberry and fresh nutmeg was really good. I'm not much of a dessert maker, but I definitely plan to try this with other fruits in the future (I think pitted fresh cherries, with a little almond extract in the batter would be fantastic). Guests loved it.

I consider myself too good (*wink*) to rate recipes but this recipe has re-defined my desserts capability. This recipe is fantastic, so good I came downstairs at three in the morning to see a guest eating the leftovers in her nightgown. Use blueberries, raspberries, strawberries or whatever...this recipe is an all-star classic to be kept in back pocket.

I made this recipe over and over again this summer with the incredible wild blueberry crop we had in New York. My summer guests always loved it and I got rave reviews from some serious blueberry bakers up there. A few changes made it better each time. #1 - Halve the butter. I did not mind the amount of butter when the cobbler was first served out of the oven, but after sitting overnight that amount of butter congealed and was a bit gross. I cut it to 1/2 stick and it still worked wonderfully. This cobbler is nice the next day for breakfast! #2 - Add some grated lemon peel. This was the kicker that really wowed my guests. #3 - I skipped the nutmeg most of the time and didn't miss it. The recipe was so easy I could whip one up right before cocktails and serve warm blueberry cobbler by the time we were ready to serve dessert.

Excellent and easy to make. I chose this recipe since, aside from the blueberries, all the other items are regular items in my pantry. It's always great to find something to make with ingredients on hand! The texture of the cake part is awesome - - nice and chewy and it 'fries' in the butter while it cooks. My mother in law asked for the recipe.

Glad I waited overnight to review this. It is GREAT cold. I'll make it again just to eat it that way. My husband liked it very well last night too, warm from the oven. I did not like the texture of the cake part, as others have written it was chewy and strange. But still tasty, can't go too far wrong with summer blueberries. Did cut the butter to 4T, that part seemed OK. Used a combo of nutmet and cinnamon

I'm giving this recipe "no forks" because it did not work at ALL for me. I followed the directions exactly and ended up wasting some good blueberries. I don't quite understand how it can work for anyone! The outside perimeter was too done and the inside circle was not done at all and the texture was horrible and didn't even resemble a cobbler. My family took one bite and we tossed the whole rest of the pan. It sounded so easy and too good to be true. It was. Don't bother.

A (SLIGHTLY) HEALTHIER VERSION - * 1/2 cup (4 Tbls) salted butter * 1 cup whole wheat flour * 2 tsp baking powder * 1/2 tsp salt * 1/4 tsp nutmeg * 1/2 cup sugar * 2/3 cup plain soymilk * 2 cups blueberries (or any fruit, in chunks) * Serve with vanilla soy-icecream ****** This is a lovely base recipe, but previous reviewers are right. The original is heavy on the butter, sugar and nutmeg. It is however, super easy to prepare, and a good size for a small batch serving 4-5. [ABOUT MY VARIATIONS] The salted butter is a nice balance for the sweet dough, and believe me, 1/2 cup is plenty to make the pastry sweet. Whole wheat flour (if you happen to have it, gives a nice nutty flavor to the pastry) I also added a 1/4 tsp of cardamom to offset the nutmeg, and sprinkled the fruit with 2 tsp of granular turbinado sugar. Blueberries were out of season, so I used strawberries and pears, but I could see this working as a quick strawberry shortcake type dessert with just strawberries. I'll definitely make this again. In fact, I'm thinking of using 1/4 cup of blue corn meal to give the pastry even more texture.

Just made these. Love the concept and they are easy but a few suggestions. 1) I would say 30 minutes is the correct cooking time, 2) if you don't like your cobbler to taste like spice cake I would cut down on the nutmeg big time, 3) The sugar content is a little high, but I like my cobblers more biscuity than super sweet.

This recipe is great. I have no problem with butter and sugar, though I did successfully reduce the butter to about 1/4 cup. I also added 6 oz. of blackberriers, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar, and added about 1 T. of brown sugar to the berry mixture. It is blueberry season in the Midwest, and I have made this twice in the past week to rave reviews from all. Yummmilicious!

I also give the 4th fork for convenience. I made this for the first time last night and because my husband and I ate the whole thing (!) I've got another one in the oven right now for the kids. In fact, my 8 and 9 yr olds made it with very little intervention from me. I hate when people review a recipe and include all the ways they changed it -- making it another recipe entirely -- but I have to admit to using ginger and a little cinnamon because I was out of nutmeg. I also used salted butter because that is what I had and it gave the chewy edges of the cobbler a salty/sweet yum. It tasted so delicious warm (very warm - we were impatient) and I liked it plain, but my husband insisted on adding a blob of vanilla ice cream. It may have been the hour and our weakened state of mind, but late last night this was the most phenomenal dessert we'd ever had!

I just made this dish with fresh peak-season blueberries I picked today. It was delicious, but I made it with a few alterations. First, I used 3/4 cup of sugar. However, I used half regular granulated sugar and half lightly packed brown sugar. I really like the warm and classic flavor imparted by brown sugar. Second, I used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I like the flavor of cinnamon better - it reminds me more of a classic cobbler. Third, I decreased the butter to 4.5 tbs. of butter. It was actually the perfect amount... nice flavor without the grease. Fourth, I opted NOT to add vanilla, as other recipes had suggested because I like to serve cobbler with vanilla ice cream and too much vanilla is boring. Fifth, I used 2.5 cups of blueberries, not the 2 cups called for. Finally, I pulled it as soon as it was golden brown and the blueberries were bubbling, which was about 25 minutes, not 40 like the recipe said. The recipe does say to pull it at this point, and this is a key factor in this dish's success so I wanted to point this out that it may not be close to 40 minutes. Although the recipe turned out REALLY well and I would make it again in a heartbeat, it is just not deserving of a 4 fork rating because it required so much alteration to truly shine.

Rating: 4
I read a number of recipes for berry buckles, crisps and cobblers, bettys and pandowdys, and this was hands-down the easiest. I believe it is probably also the best. I reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons, reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and added 2 teaspoons of orange zest and a teaspoon each of ground ginger and ground cinnamon to the batter. I used fresh blueberries and raspberries. I was NOT greasy, NOT tough and tasted delicious the next day. It didn't last beyond that. Thanks, Bill!

This gets its fourth fork simply for the speed factor - I had this in the oven within 5 minutes. And to those whining about all of the butter: if you are worried about calories, it is possible to eat the berries plain you know...

This recipe has way too much butter! This is not the light and midly healthful fruit-filled dessert I had hoped for. Nor is it like any other cobbler I have ever made. Instead, it is like sweet fried dough with blueberries in the middle.

Waaaaaaay too much butter. You can't taste the fruit for all the grease. Also the fruit doesn't blend well with the batter during baking - fruit mixture clumps in the middle, chewy dough sticks to the sides. I think this recipe has the right idea about the simplicity of making good cobbler, but the ingredients need to be worked out differently.

So good! I, too, skipped the nutmeg and went for a capful of vanilla extract instead (not a big nutmeg fan). This recipe melts in your mouth! Best when served only slighty cooled from the oven with a big old scoop of vanilla ice cream. I baked mine in my cast iron pot, which helped cook the cobbler evenly throughout.

Made this recipe for the first time. I thought it was delicious, but it wasn't as pleasing to the eye as I would have liked. No complaints from my family, however.

Lovely for a simple dessert! Quick to put together, and quicker to eat! Even the little 5 year old gobbled it down. Followed recipe as stated, but did add the vanilla. It was a nice addition. I did think that the cake portion was a little tough. I didn't overbeat the batter, not sure why it was a bit chewy. Maybe it's supposed to be, or maybe I'm being over critical. Either way, it won't stop me from making it again, and trying it with other fruits!

This has become a true favorite. I have made it several times and it is always great. I do make a few adjustments though: I use cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I add 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter (because I like the flavor). Use skim milk instead of whole. Also I add lemon rind and juice to the blueberries before adding them to dish. This enhances their flavor. And I sprinkle sugar on top before baking, which crystalizes in the oven. Overall, YUM!

Made this with my 10 year old. It was wonderful! I also cut the amount of butter to about 5 tablespoons. Still very buttery but nice. Did not have whole milk so I substituted 1/3 cup skim milk and 1/3 cup sour cream to maintain some of the fat the whole milk would have provided. Can't say how it is cold because we couldn't wait more than 5 minutes out of the oven. Delicious but boy those blueberries were hot! Next time we'll wait 10 minutes.

I've made this recipe several times in the last year. It doesn't come out rubbery if you get the proportions of butter just right. The original recipe does have too much butter, so I cut it down to 4 TB. Cutting it any further seems to yield the rubbery texture. I absolutely use fresh nutmeg, there is no comparison in taste with ground. I've made hundreds of desserts in the 30 years or so that I've been cooking and this got the same rave reviews despite the ease of preparation, probably as much as any dessert I've spent 6-8 hours preparing. I refuse to give this recipe a 4 rating because it had to be doctored.

I found blueberries at the local grocery store at 2 pints for $1 last year. I decided I had to buy several and wanted to make something with the blueberry cobbler. I prefer this type of cobbler vs. the biscuit topping and it was great. My husband and I enjoyed this so much. One change to the recipe was that I used spelt (a different grain, which has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor) flour instead of regular white, as I prefer to avoid wheat and it was great.

We just got back from picking blueberries this morning and I simply *had* to make this cobbler, it's a true taste of summer. I guess the nutmeg debate continues, I used a small whole fresh-ground nutmeg, and I loved the punch it gave the batter. This is so easy, I'm going to make it when we go camping next weekend! Thanks, epi, for sharing this recipe (and all of them!). p.s. Fresh nutmeg rules!!! It really makes a big difference, in my opinion.

This is sooo delicious. I had tons of very big, very sweet blueberries so I used more than called for. I also used a little less sugar and butter, as suggested, and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg since I didn't have any, and I like cinnamon much more anyway. I'm sure vanilla ice cream would send it completely over the top. The best part is the cakey, buttery edges. I like this much better than biscuit-type cobblers. By the way, it was done in just 30 minutes (I used a glass pan).

I used a bag of frozen blackberries I had in the freezer. I didn't have time to thaw them, so I just added a couple of tablespoons of flour to them to absorb some of the liquid. Overall it was good - my husband ate two helpings. But it was a little sweet for my taste. I did add a 1/2 ts of vanilla and eliminated the nutmeg. Maybe the vanilla made it too sweet. Will try another recipe next time.

Rating: 3
I used frozen blueberries and made sure to pour off most of the liquid that had accumulated during defrosting so as not to introduce more liquids into the batter. For good measure I threw in an extra half cup of berries. I put it in the oven as we sat down to dinner and served with fresh whipped cream. The girls swooned over it.

Rating: 3
Made exactly as written, except for using ground nutmeg (I've never actually used fresh; is there a big difference???) I did feel that the nutmeg flavor was a bit strong, but I see that a previous reviewer did comment on this being a side effect of not using fresh. I used frozen berries from last summer, and didn't change anything else. Left it on the kitchen counter overnight, and it's not rubbery at all. I wonder if the refrigeration is detrimental? The butter and sugar gave a slightly caramelized edge to the crust which is wonderful! Very easy, and I'll definitely make again, both with blueberries and other fruit; thanks for the suggestion of crystallized ginger with peaches :)

This is one dish I won't make again, I was quite dissapointed.

She's right ... it's scrumptious and my favorite kind of recipe: it's fast, easy, uses ingredients you always have in the house, and the end product is an old-fashioned, homey dessert your family and friends will love, especially topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I can't wait to make this again with other fresh fruits, and with canned peaches next winter.

This is a very delicious cobbler. I doubled the recipe and used a 9"X 13" pan. The only thing I changed was the amount of nutmeg. I used about half the amount called for, as recommended by other reviewers. My husband loves blueberry anything, and he just raved about this dessert. I'm glad I made a double batch so there's some left for tonight. I'll definitely make this again with blueberries and also try it with other seasonal fruits. Give it a try. You won't be sorry.

I followed the other suggestions and cut down on the butter, sugar, nutmeg, increased the blueberries to 2-3/4 cup and served it over ice cream. This recipe would be good to serve to family on the weekends and/or finishing up my huge stash of frozen blueberries. I would, however, not serve this to guests as it is more of a comfort food and not the elegant dessert you want to impress friends with

Years ago when it was first published in the magazine, I tried it, and it was simply great! Now that I am stationed away from the U.S.A and crave "real food", I just have to have blueberry coobler, and this by far is the best one yet! Follow the recipe exactly for best results.

I have made this a number of times this summer - reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons and use evaporated skim milk - which makes the texture much less greasy. It is so easy, works really with other fruit (just made it with peaches) and is great for family dinners.

This was very easy to make, but definitely CUT BACK ON THE NUTMEG, and the BUTTER. Also, I think I'lll spread the berries around some rather then put them all in the middle of the cobbler. They didn't spread out like I thought they would, and the cake part didn't cover up any of the berries. I'll make this again, making a few changes, before I give up.

This recipe is awful. It calls for too much butter and the cobbler becomes rubbery. My husband and I ended up throwing it in the garbage.

this is so easy and yummy. i misread the directions and whisked the milk with the butter instead of the batter. i also folded all the ingredients together, including the blueberries so they were throughout. the milk makes it very moist. a crumb top would be good too!

Hmmm....I LOVE blueberries, but DID NOT LOVE this recipe. Too much butter; the cobbler was greasy and tasted odd. The blueberries cook up nicely, but overall, I'd keep scrolling the recipe list for another blueberry treat.

My husband was in the mood for a "Blueberry Something" or other. I found this recipe and it had the main ingredient I was looking for: "EASY!" It turned out delicious! I would, however, reduce the amount of nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon. I'll be making this again....it's probably great with any seasonal fruit used!

Delicious and easy to make

Easy and delicious. Always a good combination for a recipe that I make while taking care of my two young children. I made this cobbler almost weekly throughout the summer last year.

Instant favorite! Made it for my boyfriend who never had a cobbler before. He loved it! Would definitely make it again.

I have made this basic cobbler with blueberries, peaches, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries - whatever is in season. It is very easy and very yummy! I tend to add less nutmeg, particularly if using freshly grated... I would not hesitate to make it over and over with whatever fruit I had on hand.

I loved this recipe! It is definitely better the next day, and ice cream works well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, easy dessert.

I became aware of this recipe from a comment on it in the July '99 issue of Gourmet and sought to find it to try it myself. I made it for my husband and I and he thought it was incredible, and I agree. I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup only because of another's review and it was perfect. This will definitely be a staple in our house for blueberry season.

Very easy. Cut back on the sugar by 1/8 to 1/4 cup. Cut back on the nutmeg by 1/4 tsp. Add grated zest of 1 lemon. Served it with pecan praline icecream.... it got rave reviews. Pat Lynch

This recipe is so simple, yet delicious. I have my grandchildren make it after we go blueberrying. And it works with blackberries and other fruits.

This was great and very easy. I will definitely cut down on the sugar next time, though. The cake portion of the cobbler was incredibly sweet.
