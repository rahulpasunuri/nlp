I love dates and I love these bars. The only thing different from the intructions that I did was zap the date mixture in my food processor to breakdown the date skins and fibers. My husband and kids (13 and 11) all raved.

I have made this recipe twice - it has been great both times. I made it pretty much as directed, except I boiled the dates for longer. I really think you have to use your judgement when boiling the filling. The type of date (and how old it is) will affect how long it needs to boil, in my opinion. Today, I made this to use up some dates that were a bit long in the tooth, to say the least. They were dryish, and I had to boil them for about 18 minutes for them to really break down and start to form a "sauce". In my opinion, the texture at the end of the boil should be kind of syrupy and thick, like runny preserves. The finished product (from dates that were not at their peak) was fabulous. The cookie part was rich and slightly crunchy; the date center was just starting to blend with the cookie and was tender and chewy. Honestly, I think they turned out better this time. If you don't like the way the filling looks after 10 minutes, just let it boil until it looks good to you. This recipe is great with vanilla ice cream. My husband claims to not love dates but he was elated to hear that we have 3/4 of the pan left over!

I wonder if the dates made the difference? We started with Whole Foods pitted deglet dates, and they turned unappetizing pale and fell apart a bit during the boiling. I hit them with an immersion blender. After baking, this was bland and flavorless and not date-ey at all. Crusts were functional, but nothing to rave over. I wonder if someone might comment on how the dates looked as they cooked; because of the raves, I'd love to get this to work!

Between the sugar overload and the cinnamon, it is almost impossible to know that one is eating a cookie bar with dates in it! This was a disappointment if you love dates as I do.

This was a surprise hit. I looked for this recipe after having a box of dates in my fridge for weeks. Little did I know how fantastic they would be! I added a bit of nutmeg and a pinch of allspice to the cinnamon.

One more thing...I try to clump the topping together by using my hands to ball up the topping and drop it onto the top, and then lightly pat it down and sprinkle the rest of the topping so it is fully covered. Yum!

Wonderful! This is so easy and delicious, and everyone likes that it is not too sweet. I have made it with and without the cinnamon, and I think the cinnamon is better left out if you are making it in the spring or summer. I put it in a 9x9 brownie pan and it has been a hit at three dinner parties. Some people are not fans of dates, but once they try it they will be hooked!

I made these today with my 3 year old. Very easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2c less sugar, didn't have brown sugar so I used white and added two heaping dollops of honey to the hot simmering dates. Also added 3/4c choc chips to dry mix. Yummy!

quick and easy. if you LOVE dates, you'll love this recipe. after the dates simmered and softened, i used a hand blender to make them smooth as the dates were lumpy and not very gooby. the smooth date mix spread easily. i would also recommend not cutting them until the day after they were made. otherwise the bars are not 'nice and neat'. DELICIOUS!!!

Rating: 4
These were delicious! Easy, fast, will make again and again. I cut the sugar by 1/2 c. and the crust still held together. Because of the dates, these bars were still plenty sweet. These date bars are a great and healthier alternative to many desserts.

My husband requested date bars as our contribution to a community event he is leading tomorrow. Since I didn't have a recipe, I did a search for date bars and, after reviewing several recipes and the reviews with them, I settled on this one to try. I also doubled the recipe and made two 8x8 pans. They are absolutely scrumptious and my husband loved them! These are not too sweet and they held together beautifully. Be sure to press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan pretty firmly and again on top with a bit less pressure to insure they stick together. And let them cool completely before cutting them. This one will definitely go into my keepers recipe box to make for grandkids and lots of holiday gatherings...I may add walnuts to the crumb mixture, too. Excellent!

I love date bars. These were good but not great. I did add nuts. If I make this version again I may add coconut too. They were easy to make.

These were a disappointment for me. They tasted great...very rich, but perhaps I didn't cook them long enough, or I didn't cook the filling down enough. They were very soggy.

These bars are delicious, though RICH! I added 1/2 cup of coconut and some thinly sliced crystalized ginger to mine.

Great recipe. Easy to make. I used a carton of fresh dates, added a couple handfuls of finely chopped pecans, and substituted 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour for 1/2 c of the white flour. They turned out great.

Bars turned out looking just like the picture and they taste great. Plus, they were relativly easy to make. However, the bars should include nuts and be cooked longer than suggested for a better texture. With the date filling, I find it a bit too sweet. A varient of this recipe using a tart apple filling would better balance the sweet and buttery crust.

These are great and don't need any changes!

I just made these, used 1/2 dates and 1/2 fresh figs. Kitchen smelled great. Taste as good as they amelled. I did add nuts as several suggested. Very good and very easy. Might try another fruit combo next time.

I made this recipe with very few changes. I used apple juice instead of water and added a touch of lemon juice. I also used gluten free flour and oats. To make this vegan, I replaced the butter with solid coconut oil. They looked and tasted exactly how I wanted them to! For my variations, I posted the recipe on The Mini Canteen Blog

Delicious, soft yet chewy and also crumbly, and certainly very buttery. I also loved that they weren't too sweet. I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the oat mixture. Next time I make this, though, I would reduce the proportion of crust to fruit, to make it somewhat lighter. The butter flavor--though tasty--is almost overwhelming.

I always loved the "mix" my mom and I made when I was young! I just found this recipe after getting a box of dates on sale @ Walgreens. I started the recipe and only had 1 cup of dates, so I added 1/2 cup of dried chopped apricots. Well, my husband kept pacing in the kitchen until they cooled down. These are sooo... good. They are the BEST!!!!

My daughter and I use to make Betty Crocker Date Bar Mix all the time when she was growing up. She got a taste for them a few weeks ago and we found out they are no longer making the mix. Very strange as they were always popular with our friends. Anyway a little researchg and I found this recipe. Wonderfull is all I can say. Thank you Edina

These are delicious! During baking, the butter-oat crust on top and bottom melts together with the date mixture in the middle, making for a wonderful sticky slice. I actually baked mine in a buttered 9-inch round non-stick cake pan, and sliced it like a pie (at 1 ¼ inches thick, it practically is a pie!). When cooled, it easily slipped out of the pan intact. Ill definitely be making this recipe again, and also plan to experiment with an apple pie type filling in this scrumptious and very easy crust. Highly recommended!

Probably the best date bare recipe I've had since my mothers. The filling is just sweet enough and the cookie part is not too crumbly. It stays put nicely and has a wonderful buttery flavor.

Rating: 4
These are AMAZING!!! Perfect. Moist & chewy, and you can do all the dry prep while the dates are thickening on the stovetop, so they are super quick to make. I bought a pack of pitted dates, and these honestly took me about 15 mins to prep before I was putting them in the oven.

Just made these and they smell great (still too hot to cut). Very easy recipe - I followed it exactly and recommend using scissors to cut up the dates (just squeeze out the pit). Loved the fact that it had very few ingredients (no milk, no eggs, etc), so I will always have supplies on hand to make it again!

I made these bars the other day and they turned out beautifully. Moist, delicious and just the right amount of cinnamon. It's hard to eat just one. I used light brown sugar only because I did not have dark and baked them for 35 minutes.I will make these again and again.

I folded one cup of peanut butter into the oat mixture and what a great snack! I dont care for dates but my fiance and sister are my certified testers and they LOVED it! Next time I am going to try walnuts instead of the peanut butter.

These are delicious! I used 2 cups fresh figs from our tree instead of the dates and needed to add a little cornstarch to thicken the fig mixture. Also added toasted walnuts to the fig mixture. They cut beautifully and taste sensational.

Amazing! Cannot stop eating them. i added a few more random spices from my cupboard like dash of ginger, nutmeg, clove. They crumble part melts in your mouth and you forget you are eating something thats supposed to be good for you when you taste the date.

I really liked these. I added nuts to the dates and would add more next time. I would also consider a little less sugar in the topping

These came out great, but I took the advice of another reviewer and tried candied ginger in the topping. I don't recommend that, it overpowers the flavor of the dates. Adding nuts, however, gives it a nice crunch.

Rating: 0
The dates I used were the wrong variety (they were labeled "Barhi). Filling turned out mushy and bland. When I find a good dark, strong-flavored, chewy date, I'm sure these will be fantastic. To gauge amount of water: Filling didn't change much from simmered to baked and cooled. The crumble was fun: if pressed hard it makes a good firm bottom crust. The top was definitely crumbly -- better served on a plate.

I had never made date bars before and this recipe is great! I pulsed the oat mixture in the food processor and added pecans. Used oiled knife to chop dates. Pressed oat mixture firmly on bottom and top. Next time I may use more dates for the filling...personal preference. Very yummy!!

Due to popular demand, I have now made these twice this month (and it is only the 20th). I'd like to try the suggestion to replace a little of the water with orange juice next time.

Won't need another date squares recipe - this one should be exactly what you expect if you're looking for typical soft, chewy bars (topping is chewy, not crunchy/crispy). I used fresh dates from Bam, which worked well, though you might need to add more dates or reduce water. Cinnamon alone is great - that amount really comes through in the topping. Cardamom or anise might be nice. These are pretty soft so you may want a fork if you're trying to be polite.

Great receipe - reliable and delicious. Just like Mom used to make! Best if made with Medjool dates. The pre-chopped dates in a box are too hard and sugary. Medjools are the best. Buy them in bulk at Whole Foods. The recipe can also be made in a round cake or tart pan and served in wedges with vanilla ice cream. Good take-along recipe for any gathering.

This was just like my mom used to make and I've been looking for this recipe for a while. We called it matrimonial cake where I grew up. I didn't change a thing except used a glass pan as I didn't have a metal one.

Made these with light brown sugar instead of the dark and they were ok. When I did get off my lazy ass and got some dark brown sugar and Medjool dates, this recipe turned out fantastic, very good butterscotch flavor and a good pick for a cookie that requires no eggs.

These were really good and had a great flavor. My topping was a little dry (although only I noticed), so don't skrimp on the butter in the topping, next time I'l add an extra tablespoon to ensure it's not too crumbly. Try adding 1/2 cup of chopped crystalized ginger and 1/2 cup pecans to the topping as well. I substituted 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup of orange juice. I'll definately make these again.

Fabulous!!! Crunchy topping and silky, lush filling: really out of this world. Tears came to my eyes as I ate the last crumbs out of the pan.

Rating: 4
These are easy and great! To the person who had trouble with the date-mixture getting thick, you just have to cook it longer. The water has to evaporate--go on how it looks, not on the time stated in the recipe. Also, it helps to stir the date mixture often while it's simmering to break up the dates more.

I am a native of the California Date desert. Fresh dates are plentiful. Delish! I also sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top before baking.

Oh brother. I really, really wanted these to come out, but for some reason the dates never got "thick" as the recipe stated. So I "poured" (not "spread" the date mixture as required) over the prepared crust mixture, all the while thinking that it didn't seem right. What I got was Date Goop. Hmmm, maybe I can serve it over ice cream! Anyway, I used the 8 oz. package of Dromedary Brand Chopped Dates which measured 1 ½ cups. Can anyone give feedback on this stage of the recipe? Help me figure out what I may have done wrong. Thanks!

I've been trying to find a date bar recipe for awhile. This is wonderful and simple. I followed the recipe exactly. Other recipes I found added brown sugar to the date mixture, that made it way too sweet. This is perfect.

These bars are terrific! Do yourself a favor and use your Cuisinart for the crust; combine all dry ingredients EXCEPT the oatmeal and pulse to crumb texture then add oatmeal last (it will be a better, bumpier texture) and pulse until crumbly. After assembling it, sprinkle the top with chopped walnuts or pecans & press lightly to adhere then bake. Serve warm with ice cream or room temp. They won't last long.

I loved these date bars. They are easy and homey yet somehow exotic. There is just enough salt in the recipe to even out the sticky sweet dates. I will definately keep this in my rotation of easy, tasty, everyday desserts. I can't wait to try them with a tall glass of ice cold milk!

My husband loves date bars and says these are his favorite of all the recipes I've tried. He can't get enough of them. Many recipes I tried before had too much crust or were far too sweet. I'm glad to finally have a recipe worth keeping. They're super easy to make, too.

These were OK for a relatively quick and easy recipe, but won't go down as a favourite. For a great date slice with a little more effort, try the date apple-nut bars also on this site. They are fabulous - the apple/date combination moderates the extreme sweetness of the dates and the chopped nuts in the dough add a lovely texture.

My children (5 and 6) made this with me, and it was a huge hit. Mixing with hands and pressing in the pan was appealing, it is quite simple, and the final product was loved by the whole family. We're making it again to take to a friend's party tonight.

Date squares are comfort food to me but I have never made them. These were very easy to make. More cinnamon-y than I am used to. I enjoyed them more the second day versus right away. Everyone I gave some to raved about them and I have given the recipe out to many who have asked for it.
