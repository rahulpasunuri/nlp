I did not like this recipe--the dough was impossible to work with, the cookies came out tasting gritty and they were so hard that the ice cream squished out the sides when we ate them. I would find another recipe for ice cream sandwiches.

Many steps, but worth the trouble. It's key to work with chilled dough to cut the squares (even re-chill it as needed). I used a pastry cutter to cut out the squares which added a cute edge. The sandwiches are quite large - I will make again as 1.5 x 3 in. rectangles.

With the amount of work required, I needed to be bowled over by the results. Dinner guests for a barbeque seemed to enjoy the dessert, but I was not impressed by the results.

This recipe takes some work...especially to make the chocolate dough for the sandwiches. I didn't dip the sandwich in chocolate for lack of time, but it turned out delicious anyways! I've made it twice and haven't had the time to dip in chocolate. My guests have loved it!

I would define myself as an advanced beginner cook. Given that, I found this recipe very difficult. The dough was difficult to work with and was too soft. The white chocolate was immpossible to dip, I ended up just putting it on the cookies like frosting. But the taste was excellent and I will try it again. A more advanced cook will probably find it easier.

The ice cream was rather difficult to shape... I did it by working in the freezer! Also keep the cookie dough very cold or it won't keep its shape when moving it to the cookie sheet. Its a long process, but a yummy outcome.
