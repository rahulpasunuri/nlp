So easy and yummy. It was really nice to find a recipe that only uses one package of raspberries because they can be expensive. When they go on sale, buy a few and make two cakes. It disappears pretty fast!

Excellent! LOVE this cake! Just made an autumn version with cranberries and it came out perfectly. Agree with one reviewer that the oven temp is a little high-- might try 385 or so next time.

Easy, very tasty and fast. Elegant enough for guests and simple enough to throw together when you don't know what to do with that buttermilk in the refrigerator!

Not worthy of 4 forks but good, simple, reliable, easy to make little desert. Fruit stayed at the top for me, I left the raspberries in the fridge until I was ready to put them in the cake. This probably helped.

Excellent. Made it with a combination of raspberries and blueberries for 4th of July. It looked great and tasted great. It seemed to me the oven temperature was a little high b/c the edges started to burn before the middle cooked. After reading others say the raspberries sank to the bottom, I subbed shortening for half of the butter, in the hope it would retard the berry sinkage. (Since I was mixing everything by hand I was concerned I wouldn't be able to beat it as well as others recommended.) Worked beautifully. Berries were studded throughout, including a few still peaking out the top, and none of them hit the bottom of the pan.

Substituted brown sugar and used both pear and raspberries. I also mixed almond meal with the brown sugar reserved for the topping for a bit more crunch.

Originally saw the recipe on smittenkitchen (she credits Gourmet), and baked it up last night. I made it in an 8" square pan so it was thicker and took a little longer to bake. I would say it's almost TOO moist, as if that could be considered a fault! You must line the pan with parchment, and I also sprayed with pam to be on the safe side:) all of my berries sunk to the bottom but it hardly matters. Perfect for summer: doesn't heat up your kitchen too badly since it bakes quickly. Make it immediately with any berry at all.

I have made this cake several times in the past two weeks because 1)everybody loves it. 2)it's sooo easy and 3) it's a great way to get rid of the buttermilk! Seriously, I've made it with blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, pineapple and now peaches. Each one tastes great!

Easy, quick and so delicious, I doubled the recipe and it came out great, like a muffin. I agree with a reviewer who said you can' t over beat the sugar and butter. I also used frozen blueberries, without their juices.

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used brown sugar and pineapple on the bottom instead of the top. Next time I'll use the raspberries but I had pineapple on hand. I will definitely make this again. Its a good cake that lends itself to modifying.

I usually double the recipe and bake up two - works beautifully. Have used frozen mixed berries with great results - I suggest covering almost the entire top of the pre-baked cake with berries - that is, the more the better! I agree with other reviewers: use parchment paper and cream the butter and the sugar for longer than you think. Essentially, you can't overwhip at this stage.

I began making this when I was pregnant and I'm sorry to admit I ate basically the entire cake the first time I baked it. It's two years later and I still love this simple cake. The changes I make are using milk & lemon juice in lieu of buttermilk and vanilla bean scrapings instead of extract. The fluffy, ethereal batter just kind of eats up the raspberries as you bake it and I love the way the turbinado atop it tastes.

Lovely cake, light, moist, and fruity, perfect for summer. Oh, also easy, and really low-cal. Doesn't get better than that. It will become a regular in our house, and the only thing I will change will be the fruit, just to test it out. I did cut the sugar down to 1/2c and didn't sprinkle any on top either. Didn't miss it (but then I routinely use 25% less sugar than stated).

This is a very good, not-too-sweet cake. It seems more like a coffee cake really. I made as directed except that I topped it with cinnamon sugar. It would also work well as a homey dessert, served with whipped cream.

Rating this as a four (exceptional) AFTER making a second time...made it last nite exactly as the recipe states...well that's not true, I thought the 1.5T sugar sprinkled on top seemed like too much and I ended up regretting that. What I changed tonite to make it amazing is to lower the oven to 375* for 25 minutes versus 400* for 23 - last nite it was too dry & toasty even taking it out early, tonite it was PERFECT. Don't know if elevation might affect it, but this is a stellar summer cake. Per other reviewers I also used parchment and beat the sugar/butter for a very long while, as well as once I added the egg and the berries didn't sink to the bottom, just sunk to the right spot. This is a defo repeater!

So easey. Will be my go-to dessert recipe for last minute dinner guests. Tastes very good. We ate it with vanilla icecream. Yum:) Didn't make any changes and i don't think that I will but it would also be delicious with blueberries.

I substituted sour cherries for raspberries and almond extract for vanilla, and it was lovely! (I'm sure the original version is great too!) The sugar sprinkled overtop the cake creates a crispy, golden, sparkly crust - no need to dress it up with frosting, I'd say. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I lined the pan with parchment.

AWESOME! No need for any changes, made as directed but with cake flour which made it incredibly light and fluffy. I loved the fresh raspberries - the perfect tart berry for this cake - I wouldn't sub it out. Berries sink to the bottom while cooking, which did make the removal from the pan a little messy. Would make again in a heartbeat.

I made this with fresh blackberries from a local farm. I also topped it with a buttermilk glaze made from 3/4c confec. sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tbls of buttermilk. Holy Cow it was delicious!!! So moist and tender and so flippin easy!!! A note to novice cooks, make sure that all ingredients are at room temp. It makes such a difference in baking. I will definitely make again! Would be so delicious with blueberries as well!!

Soooo good and so easy. Tried this today (we don't bake much in the summer but temps are below 100 this weekend). Amazing flavor and texture; cake plus berries such a delight. This goes immediately into the favorites folder. Baked it in two 6-inch pans so there's one in the freezer for next week.

This is a simple delicious cake. Would probably serve with whipped cream for guests, but for the family a glass of milk will do. Nice and light for summer.

This is one of those recipes that I come back to every spring/summer. I walk through the farmers market and the berries scream out - Please whip me into a cake. It has great flavor, texture and works really well as a breakfast cake or with a dollop of sweetened sour cream. The only thing I change is that I add a 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom, I mix the berries up a bit adding strawberries if in season, and I pre- sweeten the berries with some brown sugar to add a little extra sumthin.

Yes this recipe was quick and easy and it worked. But it was really nothing special. I was very disappointed. The texture was a bit spongy and the flavour reminded me of something I would purchase at the supermarket even though I used top quality ingredients. It just didn`t work for me. I feel that I wasted a precious carton of the season's first fresh raspberries. I am obviously in the minority here so it must be a matter of different strokes...

Made it twice to raves. Moist with lots of flavor. Followed another reviewer's advice and added lemon zest in the batter. I also added some flaxseeds in batter to add fiber and also had cherries on hand so used that instead. Will next try blueberries!

Make this cake today, right now. It is so incredibly good. The raspberries are the perfect tart contrast against a simple, sweet cake. I doubled the recipe and baked in two 9" rounds. Topped with demarara sugar. Didn't have buttermilk, so used half+half with lemon juice instead.

I made this for friends over 4th of July weekend. It was so simple and delicious. It went perfectly with homemade vanilla ice cream, although it doesn't need anything else with it, since it is so moist. The fresh raspberries out of the garden weren't lost in a long list of ingredients either. I will make this again with other berries as well, although I'll enjoy it with the raspberries while they are in season.

This is so easy and so tasty. I will try using other berries as others have suggested. I did have to use Splenda, but it didn't seem to make a difference. I also used lemon zest in the batter and 2T. of sugar in the raw on top,for a crunchy topping. I made it in a fluted pie plate, which I lightly greased. I had no problem with sticking and served it right from the dish. I baked it in a 375 degree convection oven for 25 min. Perfect!!

I have made this cake 3 times since printing it Friday night! It's easy and delicious. The first 2 were made with just raspberries, the next was with Blackberries, Raspberries and Strawberries. I sprinkle powdered sugar on it when it's cool...also, because of my oven I only needed to bake for 21 minutes for the first two. I lowered the temp (dark pan) the next time and it took 25 minutes.

SOOOOO good! Made with fresh raspberries from my garden. Took the advice of other reviewers and baked in an 8-inch pan for a slighlty thicker cake, and sprinkled with 2T raw sugar for extra crunch. Used parchment in the bottom of the pan, and had no trouble getting the cake out. Served with a little amaretto-spiked whipped cream. The leftovers were delicious for breakfast the next day.

Fast, easy, versatile, and delicious. What more could you want? Oh, and did I mention DANGEROUS?? Could easily eat the entire cake by myself (I'm halfway there already!) in one sitting. Made recipe as is with the following exceptions: 1 1/2 cups of diced strawberries, and sprinkled powdered sugar on top at the end. As others mention, be aware that it does make a 'short' cake (about 1 1/4 inches high in a 9inch cake pan). But that's fine. Still pretty and delicious. Looks just like a specialty cake you'd get in a fancy bakery that you'd overpay for, haha. =) You really could just substitute any berries in this recipe. I'd caution those using frozen berries like blueberries though, as I can see it would likely turn the whole cake blue (unless you can dry them before putting on the cake) - unless that's what you want of course. The powdered sugar just makes it look that much extra pretty (will definitely be making this for company or to take to parties). The sugar on top is a must - it as just that little extra bit of delicate crunch on top that makes it extra special (even under the powdered sugar).

My husband made this today. Oh. My. God. This was ridiculously good. Smells amazing, looks beautiful and tastes divine. He put some berries in right side up and some upside down, then pushed them all down a bit. They dispersed nicely throughout the cake as it baked. We couldn't find full fat buttermilk, so he used low-fat with no ill effects. He also used an 8-inch pan and it worked fine. We use the Williams Sonoma Goldtouch non-stick pans and they work amazingly well. Zero sticking. The contrast between the sweet sugar crust and tart rasperries is beautiful. I think next time we will make creme chantilly with lemon zest to keep up the sweet/tart theme. Make this cake!!!

Made this last night, no leftovers! Came out of the pan like a dream, easy to prepare, the flavor and texture were wonderful, used raw sugar to sprinkle over the top as it gave more sparkle. Will try next week with fresh picked blackberries and clotted cream.This will become my go to for a quick, impressive dessert,

Beautiful buckets of fresh blackberries at the farmer's market this morning and I owed a "Thank you" to a neighbor; so I doubled the recipe. Inspired by a previous poster, I zested and squeezed the last of my Meyer lemons into the batter and added an extra egg. Parchment paper in the bottoms of the pans... truly delightful. And it couldn't be any easier. This will have a place on my brunch table or the book club tea table often.

This cake is wonderful--delicious! I made two changes: doubled the vanilla and used an 8-inch cake pan to make a "thicker" cake. Baked 25 minutes and it was perfect! (Next time will use parchment paper, though, because raspberries stuck to pan a little bit.) Served with Haagen-Daz Raspberry Swirl Frozen Non-fat Yogurt and my guests said it was "heavenly." I agree and will make this again and again with other fresh fruits, i.e., blueberries, strawberries, cherries...you name it.

Doubled the recipe given the other comments on how little batter there seems to be and cake came out dense, but still very delicious...used frozen raspberries and I found that I probably couldn't tell the difference (between fresh/frozen) as the batter folds over the berries when cooking. I really liked the consistency of the cake portion, light and fluffy and moist, especially with the sugar topping. I also used more sugar than called for in the recipe for the topping (3 tbsp), but I find this will vary with each person's taste. However, will try to use strawberries or blueberries as I enjoy those more. Easy to make, and this recipe is a keeper for quick last minute baking!

Rating: 4
Great brunch cake! I used a little over 1 cup of thawed frozen wild blueberries, sprinkled with coarse sugar, and served with whipped cream spiked with lemon zest. I think I overbaked it, though, as it was a tad bit dry - I baked it for 27 minutes in my gas oven, which tends to take 20% longer than most recipes call for, so keep an eye on your cake. Make sure to grease your pan well, as I had a little trouble getting mine out of the pan. Will make again!

You know, I liked this, but I didn't think it was great. It was easy and tasty, but relatively plain, I felt. I did use blueberries, not raspberries, but everything else I followed exactly. Served with lemon curd, which helped some. Not sure if I'd make it again, though. Didn't seem special enough to me.

This was pretty good and was definitely easy to make. I thought the raspberries would be 'inside' the cake, and I also thought the cake would be thicker - it was probably only about 1.5-2" high, but regardless it tasted pretty good. Almost reminded me of pound cake.

I put the cake in the oven sans parchment paper and THEN read the reviews about how difficult it is to remove from the pan. But mine still came out intact! Tips for removal: 1 - As soon as cake is out of oven, run a dull knife around the edge of pan to loosen. 2 - After the cake has cooled for 10-15 minutes, stand the cake pan up on a 45 degree angle, and firmly tap the pan against the kitchen counter (lay a towel down to protect your counter surface); rotate it like a wheel, and tap again. This helps loosen the cake from the bottom before you turn it out of the pan.

I made this once in Germany and it was AWFUL somehow -- too dense, not sweet enough; like a subpar muffin.

very moist and tasty. I doubled it exactly, except I used 12 oz total of mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries) and slightly less sugar on top.

This cake was great. I agree with others, you should use parchment paper & also do not take out of pan after 10 min. I think it needs more time. I will try this cake in an 8" pan & put berries upside down to see if that helps the sinking problem. Def. a keeper.

Fabulous, easy, adaptable. I used fresh peaches cut into 3/4" pieces. My favorite adaptation: Sugar in the Raw sprinkled on top instead of plain sugar.

This recipe is a quick win! Got some fresh berries? You can whip this up in no time. Not sure what does it exactly, because it is very simple, maybe the buttermilk & vanilla combo is what makes it so good. I think it works well with a little whipped cream on the side, but it also stands on its own. Much prettier looking when done than in the small photo here.

Made this with blackberries, doubled the recipe and baked in two 8" pans. Torted the cakes then filled and frosted with blackberry buttercream (Italian meringue buttercream with fresh blackberry puree). So good.

I made my cake with blueberries and a dash of pumpkin pie spice blend. This cake is light and not too sweet. WARNING: It will take strong will and determination to resist devouring an entire cake within an hour of pulling it out of the oven. Especially if you made two of them. But try because it's even better the next morning for breakfast, warmed-up with a side of eggs and bacon or sausage.

This was certainly easy enough to make on a weeknight. It's a good basic cake. I did add some almond extract to the recipe. Next time I will do the same and increase the amount of fruit. Maybe some chocolate chips with the raspberries?

excellent cake after using 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/2 a stick of butter. i used blueberries instead of reaspberries...delicious!

SOO good! Turned out great and I forgot to add the sugar on top! I cooked for a shorter time and it turned out very moist- I also added nectarines to the raspberries and it was a great combination!

A very basic cake that is a tasty way to use raspberries. Since it's not too sweet it works well not only as a dessert, but also as a breakfast treat.

Made this for 4th of July bbq; and I made three: one with blueberry, one with blackberry, and one with raspberry. I actually forgot to put the sugar on top of the blueberry one, but it came out just fine- only minus a little of the fabulous crystallized sugar. If you wanted to eliminate some sugar, that part was eliminated without making a huge difference. All were delicious, and got tons of compliments. Super easy, and wonderful with homemade whipped cream on the side. My only issue is that the presentation leaves a bit to be desired. The blueberry one kind of reminded me of a giant blueberry buttermilk pancake. But, once everyone bit in, appearances were forgotten, and all three disappeared in a matter of minutes!

I think the reason this recipe is getting reviews is because it's so easy to make! I don't like to review unless I can add to the conversation, so here goes: I used a silicone pan, and I buttered and floured it as directed - and had NO trouble getting the cake out. Very moist and yummy!

This cake is a simple, plain cake that is a nice thing to make if you don't have much time, but do have raspberries. It is nice enough to serve for dessert or brunch. I would make it in an 8" pan if I had one to make it taller. I had NO trouble getting it out of the pan. I used a parchment round and baker's release spray. Make sure it has cooled enough before removing from pan and you should have no trouble.

This was a VERY tasty cake and easy to make, but I can't stress enough - use parchment! I buttered and floured the pan as instructed, and used a non-stick cake pan, but the removal of the cake was a DISASTER. The whole thing just fell apart. A friend made the cake and added chocolate, which I thought was really great. But he too had problems with it sticking to the pan.

This was fast, easy, and delicious. I made it for Sunday brunch and it's perfect with coffee in the morning. Next time I'll make it in an 8" pan, in a 9" pan it's only about 1 1/4" thick; and I'd prefer a taller version myself.

Extremely easy and very tasty! I added more berries and reduced the sugar topping! Fast cake to bake on a weeknight but elegant enough to serve for company.

While I was busy mixing the batter, my son was busy eating half the raspberries. I peeled & sliced a nectarine and added that to the berries, and it was delicious. The oven mysteriously shut itself off midway through baking, but even with that goof, the cake still turned out very nicely. It does not keep its crunchy topping after the first day.

I am fortunate enough to have raspberries in our yard, thanks to my unsuccessful attempts at pruning my husband's garden. This recipe is an ideal way to use them: the combination of sweet & tart is perfect, and whether for dessert or breakfast, it's irresistible. I follow the recipe exactly and use Cabot's unsalted butter - beating for 2 minutes is important - and bake for 20 minutes. Even though it's quite moist, the cake comes right out of the pan. No need for accompaniment, either.

Made this with blueberries, and am about to do it again. Tasty anytime, but we had it warm for brunch with a splash of maple syrup, scrambled eggs and sausages. Decadent but delicious, like a wedge of fluffy blueberry pancake. I didn't top with granulated sugar before baking, but gave it a light dusting of icing sugar before serving. (Used a springform pan and a round of parchment to eliminate removal issues.) This cake stays moist for days and is so simple it lends itself to any number of permutations. My husband has been noshing on it morning, noon and night.

The concept is great, but I think the raspberries were too tart. I also used whole wheat flour, which probably made the cake too dense. I doubled it and baked in one pan; boy did it rise! I'll try this again with a different fruit, like blueberries, and the right flour.

Made this cake with blackberries and it was great. May whole family loved it.

Rating: 4
Four forks due to the great flavor and exceptional ease of making. I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 pan and allowed to cool in pan. I scattered enough blackberries to completely cover top (probably about 4-4 1/2 cups) which was a perfect amount. I was worried the berries would be too heavy and add too much liquid, but they didn't.

I made this for Father's Day. It was moist and was a good lite summer dessert. I had tasted the batter and thought it a bit sweet, but the tartness of the raspberries balanced it out. It's not a "wow, this is absolutely amazing" cake, but it was good and I would make it again.

I have made this cake multiple times, it is quick and easy. Received rave reviews! Combination of raspberries and blueberries is really good too.

Wahoo! Love this cake... I prefer 'rich' to 'light', and doubled the butter. I agree with the advice to use more berries. Super easy and quick to mix up. I've made it a bunch of times already... Delish!! It's making it into the family recipe book, and that's the highest honor I can give it...

I made two for a party over the weekend, topped with a little whipped cream, and everyone loved it. Super easy to make, I used PAM on the pans and had no trouble getting them out. The only change I would suggest is adding more berries if you have them.

I used a nonstick pan and it came out of the pan with no trouble. I gave this cake to some people and they thought it was so wonderful that they called me to tell me that it was all gone. I used black raspberries.

Totally fabulous! Super quick and delicious. I had this puppy whipped up and in the oven within 20 minutes. Watch the time, though, my cake cooked in about 20 minutes. Looked a little raw on the top so I left in another 3 minutes, and the cake ended up a bit dry and too dark on the edges. I was the only one who noticed though. In any case, the cake had a nice delicate flavor and texture. I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Wonderful cake. My first attempt didn't come out of the pan either. I cut a piece of parchment in a circle using the pan as a guide to fix this problem. I have made it with blackberries also!

This is a great basic cake - I've made it 3-4 times now - originally with berries which was great but more recently with any fruit I have at hand - apple slices and cinnamon, tinned peach slices and even just sultanas. I've cut the sugar a little bit as I sometimes give it to my toddler but the buttermilk keeps it tender and the fruit is sweet enough - a great recipe

Will be a summer dessert staple while berries are on sale. The parchment is a must, first attempt didn't come out in one piece but was still fabulous. Worked great other times with blackberries (added lemon zest to the batter) and blueberries. Used 2 Tbsp demerara sugar for sprinkling.

This was a tasty recipe (I used yogurt, not buttermilk, since that was what I had). I liked the tangy flavor and overall texture of the cake. I baked in a springform pan which made serving the cake easy. It was good warm with vanilla ice cream as well as room temperature with a glass of milk. There weren't a lot of raspberries in each bite so I might use 1 1/2 cups next time.

A good easy cake - not as special as I would have thought from the other reviews, but no complaints. I used a piece of parchment in the pan and it came out without a problem.

I just made this cake and it was absolutely amazing. I made it with fresh raspberries and used a piece of parchment paper that I cut out and put at the bottom of the pan to keep it from sticking as others had complained about. Can't wait to try it with other types of berries.

I could have eaten the whole cake by myself. Everything was perfect except when I tried to turn it out of the pan; I will use a parchment round next time. I used Maui raw sugar on top, it was great.

Delicious and easy summer dessert. I knew I'd like it when I saw the picture, and I did--along with everyone else. Served it with macerated raspberries and vanilla ice cream, but I'm not sure that either was really needed.

I knew I would love this recipe from the first moment I laid my eyes on it, but my hip to waist ratio said, I would have to modify this to suit my low-fat lifestyle. Modify I did, and it turn out wonderfully. I replaced the butter with unsweetened applesauce, reduced the sugar by 1/3, and used 0% sour cream instead of buttermilk (only because I was not using butter, and felt I might need the added creaminess. My cake turned out of the pan effortlessly, though in future I might add only half the berries while cooking and the rest once is it done since, around the berries the batter seemed a bit raw.

Wonderful. I ate a quarter of a cake by myself. Luckily I doubled it because everyone else liked it too. I did use frozen instead of fresh raspberries, but don't think it would make a difference either way for this. Also used turbinado sugar for the sprinkling.

Yum, this is just my kind of cake! The tartness of the raspberries was a perfect combination for this buttery cake. It did stick to the pan alittle. Next time I will try baking in a spring form pan.

wow!wow!wow! The cake was tender and melt-in-the-mouth. It had been a while since I had a homemade vanilla-type cake. The first bit was divine. I'm sure this would work great w/ other summer berries. Like another reader I made this as a breakfast cake. Mine stuck to the pan as well so in future I may just serve as a "coffeecake" in the pan. Only used a scant T of sugar on top but no other adjustments.

I really couldn't imagine that this cake was worthy of all of the raves it was receiving, so satisfied my curiosity this morning by making it under the guise of a "breakfast cake". (Yes, we did eat cake for breakfast!) It was great! It did not turn out of the pan though, well, half of it did, and fortunately I was able to carefully put that half back into the pan and serve from there. I think a parchment round would aid in a successful removal the next time. I added a few scrapings of fresh nutmeg to the flour mixture and 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract along with the vanilla since I think almond goes so well with raspberries. It's a keeper, and next time I think I'll try it with blueberries.

This was so delicious--light, flavorful, with slightly caramelizing bits. I used sliced fresh strawberries from the farmers' market: the batter would be good with slices peaches, pears, plums, chocolate... Also very fast and idiot-proof.

Simple, delicious, and QUICK recipe that is perfect for the summer months! Like other reviewers, I had some difficulty turning out the cake, but succeeded with some luck and a quick hand - and didn't break it. I can't wait to make this again next weekend, it was a hit! Delicious with some vanilla ice cream! I think I'll try frozen fruit when the fresh is out of season too.

I used the food processor for this wonderfully easy and flavorful cake. Place butter, sugar, egg, vanilla and buttermilk in bowl of food processor and process until well mixed. Add previously-blended dry ingredients to the processor bowl and pulse briefly until blended. Do not overprocess. Dot raspberries over the surface of the cake, using about one and a half cups of berries. The cake turned out of the pan beautifully. People loved this cake.

The cake was easy to make & not too sweet. I added to many raspberries, & I knew it would be hard to turn out. I serve cut from the pan w/ ice cream. It was great after a BBQ ribs & such for dinner.

So good! And easy. I used frozen raspberries rather than fresh (MUCH better flavor unless you grow them in your backyard). I will skip the instruction to "turn out onto a rack" because that didn't work AT ALL, the cake just came apart. Next time will serve right out of the pan. Terrific warm with vanilla ice cream. Excellent!!
