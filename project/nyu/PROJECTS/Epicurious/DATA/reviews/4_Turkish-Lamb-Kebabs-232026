Delicious. Very easy to make. I cannot find the peppers in our local markets...just add a little ground cayenne pepper if need be. In addition, I add garlic powder & oregano to the meat marinade.

this dish is excellent and the recipe remains true to what my Turkish ancestors have been eating for centuries!!! So yes, it is very much a Turkish dish! :-)
