I served this to a crowd and it was a hit. We served it with fresh bread and sea salt crackers instead of the endive. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Very good. We served at a dinner party by 'stuffing' the endive leaves and then drizzling the sauce on top before passing around. The sauce could use more flavour - maybe more cayenne? - and the green pepper was overwhelming. I would recommend reducing or eliminating the green pepper altogether.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it came out quite delicious. I eliminated the carrots and apples, and substituted greek yogurt for the mayo. I think the endive I had was just a little too bitter, but the salad and dressing were great.

This was fresh and wonderful! I made it for a gourmet dinner brunch and everyone loved it. I also made the french toast creme brulee' and everyone raved about that too. I also made the eggs benedict casserole--not so good.

I have to admit that I don't know what all the fuss is over this recipe.....I followed it pretty much exactly and although the presentation was lovely, I found the crab salad to be quite bland and the dressing was downright yucky....maybe I did something wrong? I don't know, but with the leftovers I added one egg, some breadcrumbs and a bit of worcesterchire sauce and made crab cakes out of the rest. Now those were pretty good! I ditched the dressing and served them with tartar sauce. Oh well...

While I didn't care for the crab salad at all -- the apples and vegetables overwhelm the -- the dressing is excellent. I find that the dressing stores well in the refrigerator and is great on a dinner salad. Tomorrow, I'll make a crab salad of my own to serve on endive with the dressing.

Absolutely delicious. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. The best crab salad on endive spear recipe I have made. And I used canned crab meat too! I couldn't stop eating it right out of the bowl. You can make it in advance and assemble it easily so I will definitely make this again and again. Great for entertaining. My guests loved it!

A perfect dinner party starter -- be sure to use the best crab meat you can find and pick it over carefully.

Wonderful! I made this for a gourmet club dinner and it was a big hit. I put the salad together on separate plates and it was very attractive. The crab salad was perfect and the dressing was great. It took a while to do all the chopping, but I would do it again. You MUST try this...
