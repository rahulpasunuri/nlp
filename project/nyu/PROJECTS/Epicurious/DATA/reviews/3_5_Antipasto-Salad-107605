Not only is this salad delicious but it looks beautiful on a platter. I added small balls of bocconcini. I have made this a few times. I think it would be great as an entree with slices of grilled beef or chicken breasts on top.

Served this to dinner guests last night, along with Penne with Shrimp, Asparagus and Sun-Dried Tomatoes and they loved both. This salad has all the right ingredients, especially if you add salami slices. Go for it!

I made this a few times already and this is a big hit all the times.My large Italian family loved it!The onions were delicious!. I double this recipe every time I make it. Not only did it look gorgeous on the platter, but the easy to make vinagrette was just perfect! This was one of the best salads I have ever made!

This is the best salad I have had--bar none! Definitely restaurant quality! Takes minutes when onions & dressing are made the day before. Company was impressed. Had left overs the next day- -excellent!

Wonderful recipe. I was a little uncertain about so many jar items, but it was delicious. Included this salad with Christmas eve dinner and it was a huge hit. followed the recipe and everything was delicious. Served with stuffed mushrooms, lasagna and sauteed garlic and zucchini.

Fabulous!!! I marinated the vegetables with one cup of water only. Also I let them sit for about two hours prior to serving. I combined the vegetables with the romaine and parsley prior to serving. Also used only half of the dressing. PERFECT!!! Great side dish or a dinner add sliced salami and serve with a baguette.

Made this "as is" following the recipe, doubing everything, for our grandson's 14th birthday yesterday (he requested this salad). It was the perfect foil served with rich, smokey barbecued ribs and sweet-spicy baked beans. There were no leftovers.

It seems to me that A Cook from California should have just made her own version of Antipasto and given her/himself 4 forks rather than almost completely rewriting this recipe. It was very good and my family enjoyed it tremendously.

Very tasty for a potluck/picnic! If you're not careful, it might turn out to be too sour for you. Here are some suggestions: Use rice vinegar; add a bit less salt and a bit more sugar; add a bit more garlic; taste before adding olive oil. Use a light olive oil; too many flavors already. The dressing isn't very special: add some lemon peel and fresh herbs (eg basil) and let the flavors blend before mixing into the salad. For the salad: Add thin strips of pepperoni and provolone. Kalamata olives work well; don't try dry-cured. Don't toss at the last minute - let the salad marinate in the dressing; toss again before serving.

I love this antipasto salad and so does everyone I serve it to. Be sure to use the fresh garlic and don't skip on the red onions. You can add different types cheese, and meats. I put marinated mushrooms and everyone loves that. I would highly recommend this salad, everyone will want the recipe.

Seems like there could have been more flavor to the dressing. Nice presentation. Great for those who love the ingredients (roasted red peps, artichoke hearts, etc.

Love this salad! I add some tag ends and whatever fresh veggies I have in the refrigerator to this too. Simpe and delish! We will be having this salad after Thanksgiving. I will add chunks of turkey to it along with some fresh cut figs from our tree, some re-hydrated craisins and some chopped dried apricots. This is good to use up any feta crumbles you have too!

I did not make the onions, and instead added fresh mozzarella, sliced fennel, and my own marinated roasted tomatoes (yum!). Absolutely beautiful presentation with all the bright colors, and tasted great, too!

This is a great salad as is, and very easy to customize to what you have on hand or your own specific tastes. I loved the pickled red onions; they are still sweet and crunchy, but with none of that raw edge that puts some people off. Great for a party!

this is the best salad I ever made. Because my Italian family can not have meat on Christmas eve ,I served it with halved boiled eggs. They gave it an even beautiful array of colors.Next time I will add few slices of cheese and sliced salami or prociuto Few friends and relatives asked me for the recipe.relatives asked me for the recipe.

Great salad. Served Christmas Eve dinner with Cioppino. Perfect combo. I did as others recommended by substituting marinated artichoke hearts with canned (in water), drained the pepperocini(sp?) seeds and excess vinegar. Didn't prepare the red onions, just sliced thinly. Added shredded reggiano parmasiano. Perfectemondo!

This is a delicious salad! I served it at a dinner party along with shrimp scampi served over pasta and it was a perfect salad for the meal. I made my own roasted peppers and added Italian Queen olives stuffed with bleu cheese and some thinly sliced Genoa salami and my guests positively raved about it. A keeper, for sure!

I made this dish with our traditional Italian dinner this past Christmas night for the first time. It was fabulous and my company loved it! I took the advice of others and added genoa salami and provolone, but other than that I pretty much stuck to the recipe. Not only did it look gorgeous on the platter, but the easy to make vinagrette was just perfect with the salad! This was one of the best salads I have ever made.

Simple to make, impressive on a platter at a party and delicious...the triple threat! This dish is highly versatile, add meat (sliced deli meats or cold cubed chicken) to make it a main course or delete items if you do not have or care for them either way it is a winner.

I loved this recipe. It is so colorful and festive; a wonderful dish for dinner party to serve before the main pasta dish. The fun part is that you can add slices of Italian cold cuts and different cheeses. Great recipe!

Go with the recipe as written for a quick and tasty dinner. Otherwise, roast your own peppers, marinate your own artichoke hearts, cure your own olives, whatever makes you happy. I love to cook but why complicate a great recipe?

I made this salad for a dinner party and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Some guests with limited tastes didn't like the olives and onions but overall it was good. It was a very easy dish to prepare and went well with the pasta I was serving. Based on recommendations from other reviewers, I used some fresh ingredient instead of canned.

This was a delicious and very festive looking salad. I would definately make again and maybe add some meats and cheeses-but its' also great on it's own.

I agree with VA. Too much canned stuff. Do roast the peppers, tomatoes, and onions yourself. Just salt, pepper, oil them, and pop them into the oven for 15 minutes-- fantastic!!!) I didn't particularly enjoy the romaine in this mix- will try mesclun next time. I topped with sliced sopressata, and garnished with a couple quail eggs and parm. Yum.

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was a great success. I added a good dried/herbed salami and shaved parmesan cheese. I tripled the recipe to accomodate three dozen guests and the resulting mound of ingredients made for a great presentation on the platter. I was asked for the recipe on the spot and gave away my print-out.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but the flavors of this dish were very unbalanced. There were too many marinated things, and way too much salad dressing. A lot of effort constructing this for not a fantastic result.

Our Sons of Italy in America Club always concludes our events with a huge Antipasta, Italian Bread, and wine. Our Antipasta is basically the same as this recipe but we include Genoa Salami,large pepperoni,and capacola, all thinly sliced. We also add thinly sliced and cut in strips mozzerella and provolone, also crumbled blue cheese. Add mushroom buttons fresh or canned. We normally use the marinade from the Artichokes for the dressing. But tried this dressing and everyone enjoyed it for a nice change. This is a meal for us after a hard day of making and selling pizza's at local festivals. Home of Ft. Bragg! HOOHAH!

I made this for a staff get-together. Many rave reviews. Especially from one pregnant woman who just couldn't get enough of it. I personally don't care for artichoke hearts, but I just left mine on the side of the plate, while everyone else gobbled them up. I will definitely make this dish to pass in the future!

Delicious salad and delicious dressing. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry ones, added a few sliced radishes and some good olives. I really liked the poached/picked onion, although the salad would've been fine with regular red onion. The poaching/pickling made the red onion more digestible, I guess, and was tasty. The dressing is simple and delicious. Beautiful!

Made this as a PASTA SALAD. It was great. Simply replaced the lettuce with rotini and tossed all ingredients together. The dressing was a tad too vinegary and I used part balsamic and part red wine vinegars. Used grape tomatoes instead of cherry. Next time, I won't bother poaching the red onion - leave it raw. As a finishing touch, I sprinkled Parmesan on top.

"Also called Tuscan peppers, these thin, 2- to 3-inch-long chiles have a bright red, wrinkled skin. They have a slightly sweet flavor that can range from medium to medium-hot. Pepperoncini are most often sold pickled and used as part of an antipasto."

I made this salad for a casual dinner party this past weekend. It was a complete hit! I was a little pressed for time so just made up my own vinaigrette from a local mustard, local balsamic vinegar, and local olive oil. I also substituted sweet cherry peppers for the roasted red peppers (I thought they looked prettier when I saw the jar on the shelf ... LOL). Everyone was oohing and ahhing over how wonderful the salad looked and, believe me, the flavour lived up to the appearance!

Pepperoncinis are jarred miniature peppers in a vinegar brine. Star makes a good brand. They are sold near the pickles at the grocery store.

What is peperoncini? I thought it was dried hot red pepper flakes. 1 cup would surely be too much and it doesn't need draining.

Doubled this recipe and served it on a huge white platter for our Super Bowl party last night. It was just beautiful and everyone loved it. The men fought over the last few bites. I followed recipe exactly except that I used twice as many artichokes as I had just a large jar. I will be making this many times.

"Antipasto" simply refers to a course served before the main part of a meal; in other words, an appetizer. It may or may not contain meat, eggs, cheese, fish, or seafood. If you don't believe me, check the Oxford Companion to Food. That said, there's no reason you couldn't add any of the above to make it more substantial, or even a meal in itself with some bread. But for a light opener to a big meal, or accompanied by other appetizer-like foods, this was excellent, and could take the place of a green salad that Italians normally serve after the main course, and Americans serve before or during. Enjoy.

This was one of the best salads I have ever made! I added cubed salami, pepperoni slices, and cubed provolone. I also replaced 2 T of the olive oil in the dressing with water to decrease the fat content and it was still great.

I have a question...why would someone have to take all the time of making the dressing for the salad, when we are asked to drain a perfectly good dressing from the artichoke hearts? Why not use it? There's the vinaigrette all good to go, & we're tossing it...just doesn't seem right to me.

A true Italian antipasto includes sliced cold cuts such as salami, cappicola, prisciutto, and cheeses.

Great salad! Easy to make and beautiful to look at. I used less oil and less dressing, it still had plenty of flavor. I also added chucks of mozzarella and shaved parmesan. Very adaptable.
