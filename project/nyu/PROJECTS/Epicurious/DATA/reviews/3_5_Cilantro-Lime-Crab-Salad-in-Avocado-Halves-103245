I didn't have crab on hand but I had fresh wild salmon that I had slow roasted with sumac; it was an excellent substitute and it was perfect with the lime and cilantro. I used chives instead of red onion and less mayonnaise. I also thought about using Chobani plain Greek yogurt instead, but I'll try that next time. Putting it in the fridge overnight allowed the flavours to blend and it was delicious on halved avocado!

Love this recipe. My husband requests it often. If only crab were cheaper here! I swapped out red onion for scallions, and we serve this with pita chips, as well.

I had a ripe avocado and a can of crabmeat and found this recipe on this website; what a gem of a find! Very easy and very tasty! Great start to a meal. Love the combination of flavors.

I tested this before making it for a luncheon, and felt the red onion was too aggressive in flavor and quantity, as was the cumin. I also felt the overall effect was too mushy. I used about 2 tbsp green onions instead of red and a pinch of cumin, and diced orange bell pepper for crunch. I made my own mayonnaise with canola oil and a little orange juice, and served the crab in avocado on top of watercress for a better, less stark, presentation. A bottle of Puligny-Montrachet paired nicely.

I made this just as the recipe states. It was delicious. Served with mixed greens, chopped tomatoes, chopped papaya and balsamic vinegar. I didn't get how the corn muffins fit in but I served corn tortilla chips along side and it worked really well. Easy light summer dinner.

Yum! Great cool meal for a hot summer day. I used giant Alaskan King Crab claws and torn into large chunks to add texture. This is a very rich dish with the mayo, crab and avocado. You defintely need the lime wedge to adjust the richness.

Something was definitely missing from this recipe, and the onion was too overpowering.

This just missed. Too much lime, not enough moxie. Maybe Arizona was right, chiles could help?

I would give htis recipe 3 1/2 forks if I could, although I did substitue celery for the red onion since none of my girlfriends like raw onion. It was still exquisite! I may try scallions as one reviewer suggested, but I will definitely make it again.What a great combination of flavours--I can't wait to make it for my husband!

I never give 4 forks because there are very few recipes that are "beyond compare". I am giving this one 4, however, because it truly is delicious, easy and a brand new combination of ingredients (at least in my experience). Obviously, the freshness of the ingredients is key--I used a lump crabmeat right off the boat and happened to have avocados that were at that perfect stage of ripeness. Without that, the dish would not have been nearly so incredible. I think the crab salad might be great for cocktails on crackers as well.

This was a perfect, light, summer supper. I used shallots instead of onions, and fanned avocado slices on the plate then mounded the crab salad on top.

Excellent. The crab flavor comes through nicely and is enhanced.

Excellent - fresh and light. Other than reducing the amount of onion (only because I'm not a big raw onion fan) I followed the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful.

I made this for a dinner party served over a bed of lettuce for the salad course. All 10 guests asked for the recipe, so I believe it was a hit. I made it a day ahead of time and thought at first it was a bit bland, even after adding extra cilantro, cumin and lime juice. The taste definitely improved overnight and I will alway prepare it ahead of time to give it a chance to meld.

A wonderful dish! I have made it a few times as a side dish and my guests rave! A keeper for sure.

Well, this definitely needs more of something, I just don't know what. Maybe serrano or something to give it some flavor. I ended up doubling this since I had a 1 pound can of Costco crab, and ended up using a high amount of pepper and Old Bay to try to get some flavor out of it. Maybe more lime and cilantro? It's not been plated yet, just made the salad, so it's marinating in the fridge, and hopefully it will develop.

My guests loved this recipe, but I was disappointed. I followed the recipe closely with minor adjustments to seasoning such as additional lime juice and I served it over avocado slices instead of halves. I realize the problem is that the seasonings mask the delicacy of the crab and I'm looking for recipes that highlight the flavor of the crab.

Sure to become a hot-weather favorite. Thanks to Costco's good quality affordable canned crab, this dish is a snap. I too fanned out my avocado on plates and scooped crab salad on top for nice presentation.

Excellent and easy. We used fresh Dungeness crab, substituted scallions for the red onions and served it over sliced avocado.

Made this as an easy weeknight supper for the whole family. I had to triple the recipe for my family of six. My kids fussed when they heard the name, but quickly changed their tune after the first bite. Delicious! Easy! The only thing I would change is to reduce the red onion. When I tripled the recipe I didn't need to triple the onion. It ended up being way too strong.

Needs salt. Duhhhhhh :( Other than that, it is simple and tasty. I fanned the avo for looks, then topped the upper part of the fan with the salad. Just stuffing an avo as is seems hokey and lazy :)

I love this recipe it is super easy and fast. I used canned crabmeat as fresh is hard to come by here. I halfed the amount of mayo for mine, but used the amount called for in my husbands as he thought it was too dry without. I suggest adding half and then tasting. I as used both celery & garlic salt in here that seemed to enhance flavors. I served this with the balsamic tomato salad as suggested. A great week night meal.

While my teen wouldn't bite, I thought this was over all pretty good, but not teriffic. Maybe it's because I made it in winter? I'll finish it tomorrow though, and enjoy it one more time. Probably be better after sitting all night!!

Very good crab salad. I liked the lime-cilantro dressing very much. Couldn't find any avocado so served it on lettuce leaves.

This was wonderful with Maryland backfin crabmeat. However, add sauce a little at a time so you do not make the crab mixture too saucy. I think the recipe calls for too much sauce.

Really good! I steamed and picked Snow Crab legs which brought the cost down considerably while maintaining quality. I doubled everything but the mayo. I may have used 2tbsp of mayo for consistency. I would serve this as an appetizer for guests.

I made this recipe twice with imitation crab meat. It was so quick, easy and delicious. I served it over a bed of greens that had been dressed with a chili-lime vinaigrette that I make.

Rating: 4
Very nice and eminently adaptable. I'm sure it's superb as written, but since I had some fresh basil and fennel on hand and was out of cilantro, I added those flavors plus the chopped red pepper as suggested below. A pinch of ancho chili powder as well. Am looking forward to a lovely crab salad sandwich with sliced avocado on multi-grain bread.

Rating: 3
this is one of those recipes where you need to vary the quantity of each ingredient to taste-- much less mayo and more lime and cilantro for me. needs very finely chopped red bell pepper or chiles, otherwise it looks pretty plain.

Rating: 3
Very yummy and different. I found the lime to be very strong, the crab mixture would be too-much on it's own. But the avacado's neutral flavour was an excellent balance. My company loved it!

Rating: 4
Very easy, very yummy. I bought fresh, pre-shelled crab. Since it came in 6 ounce tubs, my version had 4 extra ounces of crab. Since my hubby and I are avocado fiends, I used 2 avocados. Along with fresh bread, this made a really easy week night supper.

I bought a fresh 2-lb whole, cooked crab and used all the meat. ($10.99) This is a bit more work (10 minutes) but definately worth it. Not fair to downgrade the rating because the cook uses poor crabmeat. It made enough for 3-4 good-sized servings. My husband and I loved it, and being from Seattle, we get lots of crab. Also, I didn't have an avocado, so I chopped a bed of fresh spinach, and surrounded it with slices of hard boiled egg to make it a meal. Wonderful - would prepare it for guests.

This is a very good dish. I substituted Surimi for the crab, as crab is very expensive around here, and it turned out excellent.

This was so incredibly yummy!!! I am tempted to make this once a week as summer approaches. I have to admit, I used imitation crabmeat which was all I had, but it was still SOOOO good!!! I chopped up the avocado and tossed them in to make it portable. I'm eating this right now for lunch and.....YUM.

This was excellent and I took the advice of the others, and used both shrimp and fresh crabmeat picked from a king crab-leg. I wouldn't use anything less or you will take away from this recipe - not to mention that the cartilage pieces unseen but often found in your mouth from canned crabmeat are so unpleasant. I would give this 3 and a half. Will keep it for a staple lunch salad.

I've made this salad twice for company, both times it was a hit. It is a perfect main dish for a light lunch. I used Philips canned crab in the black can from Costco which made it so easy. This is the only canned crab worth eating.

Just delicious, and I liked the fact that the ingredients were ones I usually have in the kitchen (except maybe the crab!).

I followed this recipe to the letter with one important exception. Crab at my local store was 16.59 a lb so I substituted bay shrimp. It turned out great. This recipe offers a lot of bang in return for the prep time required. Make it tonight!

This is an EXCELLENT use of crab. I would also use a variety of seafood with this recipe. It was refreshing and vibrant. I cannot wait to make this again. Next time, I think I may put the salad in a leaf of radicchio.

I liked this one, but next time I'll cut down on the onions. It would also be nice served on a bed of crisp greens.
