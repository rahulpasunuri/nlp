The sorbet is wonderful and so easy! I had all three varities of grapes so made each flavor of sorbet. Each was wonderful -- hard to pick a favorite. Next time will double the recipe.

I also made the green grape version and it's phenomenal. The sweetness mellows after it has time to freeze, and it's got a flavor that is what grapes WOULD be if they could. I'll make this over and over again.

Very easy and quick. If you have kids, that love grapes, they should really love this.

I only made the green, but I am thrilled with the results. This took next to no time to prepare, and has a very unique flavor, compared to so many other frozen treats. I took the lazy way, and just let the fruit process longer in the blender, and kept whatever solids remained (who minds a little extra fiber?), but found the end result was still very smooth and delicate in texture. Also, I had no superfine sugar, so used half granulated and half powdered to no negative effect. Before putting the blend into the ice cream maker, I tasted it and thought it would be too sweet, but discovered that as it chilled, the flavor of the fruit seemed to come through more, and while I might still reduce the amount of sugar next time, I am still entirely dazzled with the way this came out. Fabulous!

I only made the green grape sorbet, and I was pleasantly surprised. For so few ingredients, the results were really nice. I'd definitely make again, and I'd think that combining the different color sorbets in a dish would be very pretty.

I have made this recipe several times as a palate cleanser between the main course and dessert. It is both beautiful in appearance and delightful to taste.

I don't know..I made this and thought it was one of the best sorbet recipes on here. It had great taste and looked pretty

Although these sorbets are lovely in color, the flavor was rather disappointing. Perhaps grapes don't have a strong enough flavor to make a good sorbet.
