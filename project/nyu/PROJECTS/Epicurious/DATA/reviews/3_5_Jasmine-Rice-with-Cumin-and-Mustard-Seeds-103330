I made this as a side dish with pork medallions in chili-maple sauce from this site. It was easy to make and delicious. For not much more effort than cooking plain rice, it has a lot of flavor.

I made this as a side dish to a pork tenderloin with fennel entree' I was making. Everyone enjoyed it and several people asked for the recipe. I will definately make it again.

Easy to make and delicious. Unique flavors that accompany fish and chicken well. But it cooks faster than indicated, so watch the pot.

My husband made this recipe with the spiced chicken and it was so fantastic that I had to tell everyone here! I'm drooling just thinking about it!

This rice smells so fantastic that you expect great things, but the flavor is really weak. Next time I'll increase the cumin significantly and maybe add some chili.

I used basmati rice and cut the mustard seeds in half. I kept the heat quite low when toasting the mustard seeds. It seemed to help the popping out of the pan! The basmati rice was very flavorful. It made an excellent accompaniment to the "Spiced Roast Chicken Breast". My family (kids 5,7,9) and friends love this meal! The spices in the chicken are very distinct but not overwhelming to the taste buds.

We loved this rice! I used basmati instead of jasmine but it worked very well. Watch out with those mustard seeds-don't have your fire too high or they'll pop all over your kitchen! :o) Great accompaniment to the spiced chicken. Thumbs up!

I made this for dinner last night as an accompaniment to Spicy Lacquered Duck (BA 9/01)and found it to be quite bland in spite of adding additional garlic and onions. Not worth a repeat.

Quick and easy. And great flavors. I thought it was great with the spicy chicken they recommend. I will make this often!

The rice was used as a side dish with a roast spiced chicken. The flavor was just o.k. Some of my guests found the crunch of the seeds a little disconcerting (they first thought that some of the rice was uncooked). I would try another recipe before using this again.

I tried this last night and it was a huge success. I used basmanti rice. Goes well with Dijon chicken

This is a wonderful rice dish. I served it with the Spiced Chicken Breasts as suggested by Gourmet and it was a really nice combination. However, I also served it with lightly sauteed salmon filets and thought it went much better with that. The yield is greater than the recipe indicates and I ended up with a lot of left over rice. This reheats well, the flavor does not become any more or less intense. This recipe provides a really nice alternative to plain steamed rice or rice pilaf.
