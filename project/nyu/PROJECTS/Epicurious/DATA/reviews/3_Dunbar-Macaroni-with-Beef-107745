The beef and noodles make it more like a main dish than a side dish. Best M&C I've ever eaten.

Heeding the advice of previous reviews, I kicked up the seasonings a notch from the get-go. This version is far from bland and still quite the comfort food. * Preheat to 350° - 400° IS too hot an oven for the whole bake time. 1. Use boneless chuck or beef stew meat -it's worth it for this. Salt and pepper the meat & brown on all sides in a deep skillet in 1 Tbs. of oil. (simmering chunks of meat without caramelizing it first? Yechh!) Deglaze the pan with a couple splashes of wine - red or white, whatever is handy. Add a good pinch of hot chili powder, a bay leaf, 1 tsp. soy sauce, 1 tsp. fish sauce, 1 Tbs. Worcestershire, 1/2 cup tomato sauce and about 1 1/2 cups H2O. Simmer for a good hour or longer till the meat is very tender. Don't let the liquid boil away - cover it and add more water if need be - you want at least a cup of savory liquid when it's done. When the meat cools a bit, cut it into smaller "shreds" or pieces - it looks better, I think. But that's your call. 2. I made a quick tomato sauce as indicated with the ingredients listed, but I added fresh garlic, a sprinkle of hot chili flakes and basil. 3. While the sauce was cooking I sautéd a cup of sliced mushrooms in 1 Tbs. of butter til just browned and still plump, adding those to the other ingredients when I mixed it all together. Put it in the pan, but... I saved the topping for the last 10 to 15 min. of baking. Bake for about 25 min. before adding... 4. The bread crumb/cheddar topping. I added 2-3 Tbs. chopped shallots and a med. crushed garlic clove along with the butter. * Take the casserole out of the oven after about 25 min. Crank the oven to 450° and add the new and improved bread crumb topping. Bake an additional 10 to 15 min. till just starting to brown - watch it!

I made this recipe when it came out in Feb. 2003. My family loved it simply because it was good comfort food. I have made quick substitutions & changes, but everyone agrees that when I go through the effort of producing the original it is the best & you can taste the difference!

Agree with the comments about this recipe making too much food, and that it's not exotic. But it's great comfort food. Sauce was a little bland so I doctored it up with 1/2 can tomato paste, 1 extra tbsp Worcestershire, and liberal pinches of cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, oregano and basil. Also used ground sirloin instead of the chuck.

I have made this dish many times using ground beef-about a pound-to combat the dryness that the other cooks complained about, I pour a can of beef broth around the edges of the dish and keep checking it while it's baking to make sure it's nice and bubbly. Also, I freeze this dish before it is fully cooked adding the broth before I pop it in the oven.

Didn't like it. Tossed the leftovers. Bland flavor. Dry consistency. Meat to pasta ratio too low.

Made this on the first snowy day of the year. Easy to assemble. Popped it into the oven, then went out and shoveled the driveway. When I came back inside the house was filled with a wonderful aroma. This is comfort food at its best. Leftovers reheat well.

I actually made quite a few modifications to this recipe, not because I had complaints with it as written, but due to what I had on hand. Like a previous reviewer, I used ground beef, so I simply browned the beef, added the onion, beef broth, tomatoes, etc all in one step. I used panko bread crumbs in the topping for the extra crispiness, and in addition to the cheddar, threw in some good gruyere cheese that I had on hand. I "dressed it up" a bit with tri-color creste di gallo pasta. The finished product was a huge hit - terrific comfort food that was well received by everyone right down to my toddler son. I'll definitely be making it again and again!

Terrific, flavorful, easy to make and the family loved it. My family won't eat tomato chunks at all, so I just used tomato puree. It was great. Loved the bread crumb topping too.

I loved this meal although it does make a lot of food for just two people. I just froze it in smaller amounts (and ate it later- it was fine!). I think it held up remarkably well and highly reccommend it. I believe using the best ingredients prevents it from being bland. Tillamook cheese is the way to go, if you can find it and just add a bit more salt and pepper. In fact, I am going to make it again this afternoon and will add some crushed red eppper flakes.

A good basic recipe. However, I would prefer regular instead of sharp cheddar. I will definately make this again!!

I am a major Pat Conroy fan, so I felt compelled to try the recipe. I used ground beef, and left it "chunky." I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes+puree. It turned out to be a homey mac/cheese/beef bake, which is exactly what I expected. I agree that 25 minutes baking is a bit too long, but I did not have the quantity issues that others expressed. I would make it again as a comfort food dish. My husband loved it. I might add some chopped jalopenos next time....

Just wanted to try something different. My husband loved it. Made the whole batch but it was an awful lot so I froze it into two more batches and found it was almost as good as the fresh batch.

I have made this dish twice now. The first time I followed the recipe as written. Tasted great but I don't eat much beef. Last week I tried it with ground turkey instead. Used beef broth still to keep it moist. Tasted great. My 2 year old loved it this time. He will eat anything with ground meat!

I thought this was a great dish. It was a bit time-consuming but overall it was a "keeper". It was just as good the next day and because my husband and I enjoy spicy foods we added alot of red pepper flakes.We will definitely make it again.

Not sure that this is worth making a second time - too dry, didn't really fit in pan and flavors weren't appealing (for all of the cheese called for, strangely absent of cheese flavor in the finished product). Made a lot of food, though...

Made this for dinner and then read the reviews and feel compelled to disagree with the other reviewers. My family of five loved this dish - we ate while I read Pat Conroy's story and thoroughly enjoyed both. I used chuck underblade steak and Cabot cheddar and followed the recipe. It's not gourmet but tasted great and satisfied us on a cold Sunday evening. I'm sure I'll be asked to make it again.

Definitely a disappointment. I have made several dishes from the website and the magazine and loved them. I took the advice of browning the meat 1st and then decided to up (double) the amount of beef broth to simmer it in afterward to prevent it from being a dry dish. Although the dish wasn't dry it was somewhat bland, overabundant on size and my feelings were "TOO much work for an overzealous mac-n-cheese dish". P.S. - Not much better the second day either....

I make this dish frequently, but differently,and it's hard to put the fork down. The people at Gourmet missed the boat this time. Boiling the beef, even if it is in beef broth doesn't do much for the ultimate flavor. May I suggest rolling the beef pieces in flour lightly, and browning in a few tablespoons of oil. (I also use ground chuck, no flour). Season meat with seasoned salt (the cheap red one), garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper ((almost Essence of Emeril); then add can of beef broth and simmer. Saute onion separately and add to tomatoes,etc., then add to cooked macaroni along with beef mixture. Stir together, simmer 15 min. It is great eating at this point, sprinkled with parmesan cheese. According to the printed recipe, add cheddar cheese at this point and bake etc. But 400o for 25 min. seems much too hot for too long. No wonder it was dry. You just need to melt the cheese at this point.

I have not reviewed any recipes on this site before, but find it incredibly helpful when I am looking for recipes. Thank you! I have to say that this recipe was very disappointing. After reading a poignant article by Pat Conroy, describing his experience with the dish, I decided to make it the other night. The dish was enormous, and a complete waste. It was too large for the size pan they described, and was entirely too dry. With so many other great recipes, I can't imagine why you would want to try to doctor it up.
