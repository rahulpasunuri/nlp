This is very good ice cream. I reduced the amount of raisins in the mincemeat and added dried cranberries and dried apricots. I will be serving the ice cream over pumpkin bread pudding for Thanksgiving.

everyone loved this - very rich though so if intended to go on top of a pie a little goes a long way. I didn't make the mincemeat though, used a jar from fortnum and mason and it was amazing.

My husband loved this. I did not make the vanilla ice cream though. I bought a good quality vanilla ice cream, left it in the fridge to soften, then when the "mincemeat" was cold, I mixed them together. I plan to serve this on Thanksgiving with pumpkin pie.

If you like ice cream with unique textures and flavors, you will LOVE this ice cream. I was intrigued (although never had mincemeat before) and was not disappointed! Thanks to previous reviews, I cut the sugar in half for both the ice cream and the mincemeat; it was still very sweet, but not too much so. Also used granny smith apples, which may have helped create a tart/sweet combination. This ice cream was comforting and exciting, full of cinnamon/apple goodness. I highly recommend this ice cream as a treat that tastes like it emerged from a gourmet ice cream shoppe.

Ok, never utter the phrase "mincemeat icecream" and things will go much better for you! People who knew what traditional mincemeat is (which includes suet) could not get past the name to even try it. The people who tried it, liked it but several people balked at the name. Also, this totally overflowed my Cuisinart ice cream maker so think about halving the recipe if you want to avoid a mess.

My 8 year-old grandson made the mincemeat by himself, but accidently didn't switch from cup measures to teaspoons for the spices. (The clue was, "Grammy, we used all your cloves."!) Meanwhile his younger sister was making patterns with the ingredients in the bowl so the spices got well mixed in, so I dumped everything into the colander, washed it off, and re-added the liquid ingredients. Despite the educational adventure, the result was superb!

I loved this ice cream - especially the subtle brandy flavor (didn't have apple brandy so I just used plain). My guests were leary of all the add-ins but I enjoyed them.

Wonderful! Everyone exclaimed over this one. I used golden raisins, which worked very well. I agree that the sugar could be reduced slightly, although people were licking their plates just as it was.

Very good and impressive... great combination of flavors, but the sweetness is overpowering, specially if accompanied with pecan pie. I would cut back 1/2 cup sugar, but I will definitely make it again.

Superb! I changed the name to Apple Brandy Raisin Ice Cream because my adult son would shudder at the mention of Mincemeat. He loved it! His first words upon tasting it were "This tastes just like Thanksgiving; Fruit, nuts, and ice cream combined. It really is very good - but for me, I would cut back on the amount of raisins a bit, simply because I am not a fan of them. This will definitely become a holiday tradition - just with a new name.
