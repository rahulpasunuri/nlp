I made this recipe with boneless beef short ribs, using 4-5 pounds of meat--to serve 10-12. I kept the other ingredients as stated, but cut the salt by 1/2. I also used warm water and warm coffee to help dissolve the other ingredients and then added the ice cubes. I baked the beef ribs about 3 hours, or more.

This was a fabulous recipe! I used Bison as there is a local supplier at our farmer's market every weekend and it has far less fat than regular beef short ribs. I did cut the salt in half and I marinated the ribs over night, browned them and then threw everything into the slow cooker before going to work. The smell in the house was incredible when I got home! I took most of the sauce out and reduced it in a small saucepan. Absolutley fantastic!

1 jalepeno does not a spicy dish make. Sorry but the writer of this is a chilli pansy. Na na na na [ansy! Retry this recipe with my all time favourite - a couple of habeneros. Now that'll give her the kick to high heaven she needs. Couldn't taste a jalepeno in this dish, it's way too strong. As it was, I put 1/4tsp of my homemade dried habeneros and I barely tasted that. And girl don't have a mild chilli bush! I omitted the bacon, as I am Jewish and that seemed obvious. I added a touch of Maldon salt to replace what I assumed was the salty flavouring to the dish. Still... 4. 4. 4. I did everything to recipe other than the chilli and bacon recplacements. Deeeelicious. People were picking bones and stealing off each other's plates. There was stabbing. ACTUAL stabbing! Not of the food, of the people. Knives barely missed naughty hands as naughty hands tried to steal bones. I had to separate people, man. Over ribs. OVER RIBS. There was a time-out involved. Clearly this recipe has too much caffeine. Oh, and I screwed up my schedule so it marinated for two days. That only made it more awesome. And deadly. This recipe is deadly. Watch your children!!

This is a great way to prepare short ribs with a few adjustments. Per other reviews, I cut the salt in half and I also deglazed the pan after browning the ribs with a little bourbon before proceeding with the vegetables. I braised the ribs the day before serving. Removing the congealed fat from the cooled sauce is much easier than trying to spoon it off the hot sauce. I warmed the ribs on the grill with a glaze made by reducing coffee, brown sugar and chili sauce. This brought out some of the coffee flavor some of the other reviewers found was missing. It also gave the ribs a bit of a smoky flavor. Served the ribs with gorgonzola mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. The guests raved. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent! Made with chicken so adjusted the cooking time for the chicken -- great combination of flavors!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe and I was not disappointed. I added some dry sherry to deglaze (I was cooking French onion soup at the same time and got a little flustered) and, well, booze makes any braise better. I did not have a jalapeno on hand, so I used a chipotle. Definitely added some cozy heat to the mouth, but nothing overwhelming. Would highly recommend cooling and skimming off the fat - lots of fat in this one.

Fantastic, easy to make, and very time consuming. Used some bourbon to de-glaze the pot before adding the stock and coffee and it added great flavour to the dish. Will certainly make this again!

Excellent. Great taste. The meat fell right off the bone. Family loved it! Didn't use the full half cup of salt. Added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce. Will make again.

the best short rib recipe ever. Absalutly amazing......

Very, very good. Yes, it took some time but well worth it. Only alteration I made to the recipe was the sauce (I turned it into gravy by adding corn starch), and the salt content. I reduced it to half the amount. 1/2 cup seemed too much for my taste. Less salt was perfect. Will definitely make this again and again.

This was good enough but certainly not exceptional. The sauce was average and there was no distinct flavour because of the coffee - quite surprising really with the amount that was used. Definitely wouldn't make again.

This was very good. My only comment is that it took alot of time. Not sure if I would make it again

I liked, but didn't love, this recipe. On the plus side, the bison was moist and delicious and I would certainly use this technique again. However I wasn't in love with the sauce. I agree with previous reviewers that you didn't taste the coffee or rosemary flavors as much as the sweet onion/soy flavor. Also, I made the mistake of not using low-sodium chicken stock and as a result the sauce was a little too salty for my taste.

Easy to make. Great flavor. A hit with guests.

My hubby made this for our Oscar Night dinner with friends. The ribs rocked!!! However, the coffee flavor, surprisingly, didn't come through. Is it in there more for the acid to soften the meat? The dominant flavor was the sweet oniony goodness. We, too, used beef ribs. It made a ton of sauce (maybe he didn't cook it down as another reviewers husband didn't), but I saved the bones and plan to use the extra sauce as soup base. Am planning on serving them again this week for another dinner party, but will cook the day before and let the fat harden and come off - there was a lot of grease from the rib. But make this recipe - major yum!!!

Excellent and quite easy to make. I used beef short ribs, marinated overnight and cooked for the suggested time. I then let them cool and sit in the fridge a second night. I removed a lot of the fat and reheated them for an hour or so on the third day. My guests raved about the flavors and how incredibly moist the meat was. This will be in my top five meals to impress guests with.

These were super and easy to make. They were awfully rich. Remember to cook all the way down or you will have too much sauce. My husband didn't cook the sauce down quite enough(men-always impatient) and I believe that it contributed to the richness. All in all a good recipe!

Exceptional! Layers of flavor. I used beef short ribs as my butcher didn't have Bison. Definitely being added to my staple recipe rotation.

Excellent all the way! A few corrections: I used pork ribs (back) since my grocery store didn't have bison. I boiled them for 30 minutes before putting them in the marinade. Instead of 3 cups CHILLED coffee, I used warm coffee and I didn't use ice cubes, the marinade was liquid enough. I forgot to add Dijon mustard, apple cider and soy sauce (the recipe doesn't specify when to add them, so I forgot!) and it was very tasty! My husband and my friends I invited that evening were REALLY impressed, it was fabulous! A must for rib lovers!

This recipe is a winner. I've made buffalo in the past, but this is my first time making buffalo short ribs. MY only advice it to be careful about the amount of salt you use. I didn't have a low-sodium broth on hand and forgot to adjust the salt in other components of the recipe. I will definitely make this again. Delicious!
