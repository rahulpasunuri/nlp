Easy easy easy! Everything can be made in advance and then just assembled at the last minute. I baked the meringues on a parchment lined cookie sheet.

Beautiful presentation. Remember to cook on low heat (double boiler would be best). Custard will curdle if cooked too quickly! Will make this one again...and again...

This is a super easy recipe and makes a nice presentation. I serve them in fancy martini glasses. I've made the meringues at least 6 hours ahead and keep their shape.

So easy and so delicious! I loved this because you could make it all ahead of time and then do a quick assemble before serving. My meringues sat at room temperature for about 7-8 hours and were just fine.

A beautiful easy dessert - I made it exactly as stated and served it to 4 people. Generous servings but all was eaten! I made the sauce the day before and the meringues about 8 hours ahead - they held up well.

this is wonderful. the "sea" lemon scented custard is great and the "islands" turn out perfectly. the key is to take the meringues out and just forget them while they collapse. i just emptied each into my clean hand and then turned it right side up on the "sea". beautiful and got raves. it's added to my desert staples now.
