The mere two fork rating is probably due to my own mistake, but the consistency was way off. Perhaps I used too much pectin, because it was like a chunky jello after it cooled, but no one else seemed to have this problem. The preserves did taste good though.

Well, it tasted good, but following the exact directions yielded only 1/2 the amount the recipe claims: it made 4 1/2 half pint jars. It seemed like an awful lot of work for what is basically, a low sugar cherry jam. Don't think I would use this recipe again, or at least not without tweaking it a lot.

This is a great recipe. Living in NW Michigan, the Cherry Capital of the World, as the locals say, tarts are abundant this time of year. For those (like me) who have had problems with the preserves setting up be certain to use the correct pectin. I re-cooked and corrected 2 batches before realizing the the ingredients call for "low sugar pectin". After correcting the oversight (and using the SurGell in the pink box, for lower sugar recipes) the stuff came out wonderfully. Nice and tart with great color. Enjoy Michigan Cherries!!

Like everyone else, I altered this recipe a bit. First, I had 3 lbs of cherries and 2 pints of bluesberries on hand and combined them to make Cherry Blueberry Preserves. What I especially liked about this recipe was macerating the fruit mixture overnight. I thoght this softened the fruit and added more depth to the flavor. Also, I used Pomona's Universal Pectin and only 1 c. of sugar and followed their cooking instructions. Easy and delicious.

I don't know what that person who gave this one fork did wrong, but it was obviously something. The recipe worked fine for me and the preserves are damn good. Has the right balance of tart and sweet and it set well.

I decided to try this recipe despite reading a negative review, and I'm so glad I did. The preserves are a beautiful red (even without food coloring), and absolutely delicious. They're a bit runny, but that's how I've always known cherry preserves to be. I'm making them again, this time without the extra work of the pits, as I don't think it added anything.

We made these preserves when the recipe first appeared in Gourmet, and it turned out to be our favorite jam of all time. The seond time, we tried to streamline the recipe by skipping the overnight soak and not separating the cherries from the juice-- that didn't work out well. This recipe makes me look forward to cherry season all year.

Even with the one negative review I decided to make the preserves anyway. I am glad I did. I used two packages of pectin and did not skimp on the cherries per jar. Next time I will leave out crushing the kernals. Don't think it added much. Family enjoyed it on pancakes. I loved it! Used lots of cherries more then what the recipe called for. They did float to the top, but because I packed them in, there was only about an inch of no cherries on the bottom. Also added red food coloring to make it a nice rich red.

I would not give it even one fork. It would not set with the recommended amount of pectin. When parcelled out as recommended, the little fruit that is in each jar floats to the top and just sits there. I made 2 batches, both turned out a mess. Forget it.
