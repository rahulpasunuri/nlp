I'm giving this three because I think the recipe is lacking just a bit. After hating succotash as a kid I decided to give the Trader Joe's version a try. That's when I discovered it was the lima beans I hated. BTW, the reviewer who mentioned Trader Joe's "Soycotash" was not quite right about the ingredients. It is made with edamame, corn & red bell pepper, NOT lima beans. I began to make my own so I could control the ratio. I've been making this all summer long and it's been a popular side dish with barbecued meats with or without the bacon. I alway parcook the edamame and corn in boiling salted water and then drain well. Meanwhile I saute whatever else I'm using (sometimes just red pepper other times adding bacon and/or shallots) with a good sprinkling of high quality kosher salt. I then add in the drained ingredients with another good pinch of salt and some butter. It's wonderful and not bland at all. Not everything has to be spicy to be good, after all this is a side dish and not the star of the show, but it does need to be seasoned. It's strange the recipe doesn't even mention salt and pepper, but I add it to taste regardless of any recipe.

I make this every Thanksgiving and everyone loves it..However I did change the recipe slightly by eliminating the water, doubling up on the bacon and shallots and adding a substantial amount of butter before serving. Edamame is definitely the way to go. This dish is also better left over so now I make it at least one day ahead.

This dish was truly awful, in my view. I served it with a holiday dinner, and none of my guests commented on it at all. Fortunately, the rest of the dinner was delicious. This dish was tasteless, even though I increased the bacon and shallot portions. I have deleted it from my recipe book and will never serve it again.

I agree that edamame is the way to go here. The presentation was nice and it was very simple to make. I wish I used the previous reviewers advice and added more bacon and shallots; it seemed a little on the blander side. The bacon does get soft but I think it was fine and blended in nicely.

Trader Joe's sells a ready mix of corn, soybeans and lima beans in their frozen section. They call it "Soycotash".

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving. The key is using EDAMAME not lima beans and add extra bacon and shallots!

For some reason, I didn't like this that well. I made it exactly as written, and I think it lacked some flavor. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper. I think a bit of cayenne would have spiced it up a little. I also considered adding some cream (yum!). My family really loved it, however. We had it with a roasted pork loin and the sweet potato puree with smoked paprika from this site. I would make it again because my family liked it so much. But as for myself, I was ready to turn into majorly doctored up soup.

I saw this in the Thanksgiving issue and thought it looked like a good side dish any time. It is a delicious way to add soy to one's diet and makes a fair lunch in and of itself. I don't like lima beans and only use edamame.

Do not understand the 4 fork rating. Made the recipe using lima beans and corn and it was absolutely tasteless. The bacon and shallot were soggy after adding the water.It would be better to stir in the sauted bacon and shallot after cooking the limas and corn.

This was fabulous! I didn't have any lima beans so I substituted thawed frozen peas. It was fabulous with Roasted Chicken and Biscuits.

WONDERFUL! Fast, Easy and extremely flavorful. Very healthy too if you substitute smoked turkey bacon from Whole Food.

Doubled this recipe for a large dinner party. It was a huge hit! Several people asked for the recipe. A great way to use edamame.

This is delicious, and was a huge hit with my guests. I tried it with edamame first and then lima beans, and think I like the lima beans better. I used a "smokey" flavored bacon and doubled the amount on the second batch.

Tasty, simple and "fresh." I used edamame instead of limas. This would be a great side-dish with pork chops.
