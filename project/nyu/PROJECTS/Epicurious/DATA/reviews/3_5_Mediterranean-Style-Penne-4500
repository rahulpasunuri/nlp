I doubled the eggplant and tomato, sauteed the onion separately, used thick-cut fancy bacon, did the rest as-given, and it was fabulous. I did drain off some of the bacon fat and added olive oil instead. Trying to be healthy, ha-ha.

One thing I did differently is to salt and drain the eggplant prior to sauteing. I think it made a difference - the sauce turned out great. A great summer pasta.

Great recipe--with some tweaks. I've never used bacon--I moved from pancetta to prosciutto very quickly. Saute the prosciutto (sliced thick bacon style and diced) in plenty of olive oil. Romove and follow the rest of the directions. I leave out the capers (bleah!), skip the Italian parsley, add diced roasted red peppers, and double the thyme. Serve with a lot of water-- not a low- sodium meal.

This recipe (with the inevitable changes) has been a staple for 15 years (an counting). Changes: substitute prosciutto (pancetta if you're a purist) for the bacon. Fresh tomatoes are best, but canned work in a pinch. Double the thyme, add half with the cheese, and the italian parley is redundant. I also add a half cup of chopped roasted red peppers. (I've never been a fan of capers, but a third of a cup sounds like a lot for this recipe) And you don't need to add oil to pasta before mixing with sauce!

This was not as tasty as I expected it to be. All I tasted was salt from the feta and kalamata olives. It was ok and my friends thought it was good but I probably won't make it again.

Very easy to make and presents well for a casual dinner with friends. I have always used bacon for this, but will take other reviewers' advice and try pancetta.

In the 12 years since this recipe was published, it has become a staple for casual entertaining. Some friends even request it when invited for dinner. My take on the recipe is to substitute thickly sliced prosciutto (chopped) for the bacon. Fry it in some olive oil and reserve. Double the amount of eggplant, and add as much roasted red pepper as Kalmata olives. I skip the capers, because of an irrational prejudice on the part of my spouse. Serve with a crunchy green salad, a bottle of spicy red wine, and lots of water.

Super-de-duper!De-iddily-ightful! Used marinated artichoke hearts versus eggplant, sun dried versus regular tomatoes & Chianti vinegar. Great hot or cold.

This recipe was the most wonderful dish. I am not a pasta eater but I make this dish almost every week. I even made it for a special occasion for my family and they all loved it. Wonderful! I did substitued artichoke hearts in the place of the eggplant.

This was really tasty. I drained most of the bacon fat and substituted zucchini for eggplant. (and yes, I agree, everything IS better with bacon!:)

This was O.K. but that was about it. I think the bacon overpowered everything.

I agree with many other reviewers. My young children also liked it after removing the olives and cheese. Good idea about the zucchini, it would taste better in the dish than the eggplant. Other than that, it's perfect just as it is. A good company or picnic salad.

I tried this recipe for the first time when it was published in 1992. Since then it has been a staple in my home - I make it about once per month. It is one of my all time favorite recipes, I've had it memorized all these years and was happy to see an old "friend" again today!

Great recipe-I omitted the kalamata olives because I didn't have them on hand but I added chopped artichoke hearts.

This is delicious! It was very easy to prepare, did the chopping ahead of time, just dumped everything in when called for. My 3 & 5 year olds ate it, I just didn't add feta and olives to their dish. I think this would be "fancy" enough for company. As mentioned before..you MUST do the bacon, but then again, isn't everything better with bacon??

makes at least 6 servings and very good, spouse says to keep recipe for company I followed it exactly!

The olives were a bit unnecessary in this very salty dish, but the bacon is an absolute must.

I used zucchini instead of egg plant. Much better.

Delicious - the capers are a must, the eggplant is not necessary. This is an easy pretty quick dish and is great if you are having company.

I usually use less tomato and substitute turkey bacon when I make this recipe. It is one of my favorites and usually gets a lot of compliments.

Not one of my favorites.

I made this recipe again and again it was a hit. My kids, 3 and 5 years, love it. Don't be afraid of using the bacon and drippings, it adds a special flavor and makes the dish perfect.

I WOULD LEAVE OUT THE BACON WHEN I MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN.
