This dish garnered rave reviews at a recent dinner party. The coriander chutney was the most interesting and delicious accompaniement to the lamb. People were mopping it up with the rolls. Totally fresh flavor.

This is an excellent way to prepare a lower calorie, more tender alternative to chops or roast. You can trim most of the fat, but the oil keeps it moist. Plus, the flavor is excellent. Good for spring and summer when you can cook outdoors. I cut down a bit on the lemon juice.
