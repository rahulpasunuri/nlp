I made this Beef Meatball Bourguignon for my boyfriend and a house guest when I had some meatballs languishing in the freezer. I didn't want to make them with the usual tomato sauce and pasta and luckily found this recipe. We all loved this dish. Now when my friends talk about my cooking they always talk about this meal being one of "restaurant quality". I kid you not! I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination. Enjoy!

Urp! Rich and heavy. A artery killer but I will go to my grave with a smile knowing that I made this dish. Served with egg noodles.

A very fun recipe. Easy to make and very tasty. Seemed like maybe one or two steps too many, but well worth the effort. Of course it tastes even better the next day.
