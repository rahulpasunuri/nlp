I used cilantro and tasted better. You can make fried rice with the leftovers.

Chinese take-out night (sometimes 3 nights a week) always ends up with boxes of leftover rice. Parsley is another ingredient usually left til it rots. I searched the two and viola, it's like magic! It worked great; kids and adults loved it. I LOVE epicurious

A tasty, easy accompaniment to pork chops. Parlsey added a nice splash of color.

Very good side dish. I used half the butter and it was still creamy and delicious.
