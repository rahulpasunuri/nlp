Light, refreshing, great salad. Made the salad exactly as described for a spring dinner party and everyone liked it. For short cuts, used a bag of butter lettuce and ready-to-go pomegranate seeds from Trader Joe's. The toasted hazelnuts were perfect...next time I will add even more.

I REALLY wanted to love this salad. The combination of flavors seemed to be interesting and unique. Almost too unique, as I didn't think the flavors meshed well and I thought the dressing was way too tangy. It overwhelmed the salad. If I decide to make it again (though it was quite time consuming for a salad prep) maybe the use of gorgonzola (as another cook suggested) would balance things out a bit.

I made a Moroccan dinner for friends tonight and needed something fresh and green -- at the store I imagined a salad of bitter greens with a pomegranate dressing. Bought the greens and pomegranate seeds and then learned that none of my cookbooks had a recipe for pomegranate dressing. Epicurious to the rescue! This recipe makes a great salad. I skipped the apple (enough fruit flavor in the dressing IMO) and used romaine and radicchio for the lettuces. (I had wanted escarole but the store didn't have any.) Simple, festive and tasty!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. The only modifications I made were: added a TBSP of dijon mustard to the dressing; made the candied walnuts from this website rather than the hazlenuts; and added crumbled gorgonzola cheese. Very fresh tasting and a beautiful salad too.

Loved this. Made exactly as indicted. Used grapeseed oil for the first time and the lighter flavor and texture were outstanding. A real winner.

Made this with organic ingredients and white wine vinegar and everything in this salad goes so well together. Tangy fruity dressing is perfect.

This salad is beautiful and delicious. We made it exactly as written. My daughter told me to open the pomegranate in a bowl of lukewarm water and to separate the seeds under the water so that I wouldn't stain my clothes. The seeds sink and pieces of membrane float. That technique worked very well. It is fun to separate out those little jewel- like seeds! Thank you for a great recipe. I like the preparation, and did it on a day when I could relax and have fun with the smells and anticipate a great dinner. I will make this again!

Here's an addendum to my first review. I just found roasted hazelnuts in a nut display in the produce section of my Super Target. If you're making this salad for Christmas, check the produce section of your local upscale grocery. They might have packaged pomegranate seeds. Byerly's in Minneapolis had them just before the holidays.

WONDERFUL! Served this with Swiss Fondue for a holiday dinner. The citrus provided a perfect balance to the heavy cheese. The other diners raved and raved. I've already been asked to bring this to our fondue dinner again next year. However, this salad is very labor intensive. There's roasting and cleaning the husks off the nuts, grating the three citrus zests, juicing the fruit, and seeding the pomegranate. If you can find pomegranate seeds in your produce section and "naked" hazelnuts, it would save a lot of time. Next time, I plan to try it with toasted slivered almonds and dried pomegranate seeds to save time.

Beautiful for the holidays with the pomegranante seeds. And they add a nice "cruch". Very tasty.

Beautiful, fresh, light salad. The dressing is very citrusy, as you'd expect based on the ingredients, so make sure you like that. The sweetness of the hazelnuts does a nice job of balancing that acidity.

This is a fabulous fall salad. I was wary of putting the pomegranate seeds in the salad, because I don't like the inside seed part, but I didn't mind because the hazelnuts also had crunch. The dressing was wonderful, and would be great on other salads. I did not have fresh lemon, so I didn't use lemon zest, but added a little bit more of the orange and the lime zest. I also used a random green apple from the farmers market, which I know wasn't a Granny Smith. I served this salad with roast chicken and stuffing, and am planning on making it again soon.
