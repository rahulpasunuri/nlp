This was VERY easy to make, it just too a lot of time. It was well worth it. My fiance really enjoyed it. The leftovers didn't last long!

Decent dish, but not my favourite flavour combination. Followed recipe, except that I chopped up the heart of a fresh steamed artichoke instead of frozen hearts.

Excellent recipe. I added my own touch by using barley instead of the rice, then adding some canned, sliced mushrooms.

I only gave this 3 forks b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used it as a jumping off point for a first attempt at making my own risotto. I didn't use artichokes b/c, although I love them, my husband does not. I used bacon b/c I had it on hand. I fried it up a bit before I sauted peppers and carrots in the bacon fat (there wasn't a lot). It was delicious, though, and I plan on trying it again with other variations. It was a lot of work! Stir, stir, stir!

I have been experimenting with risotto lately, the new comfort food! I really liked this recipe. It has really nice flavors, nothing bold but very savory. The only change I made was to use canned artichoke hearts and I used a whole can. It was probably about triple the amount, I didn't measure. I thought it was great (love artichoke hearts). I also ran out of liquid before my rice was just right, so I used a little of the juices from the artichoke hearts. I'll defiantly make it again.

I used bacon instead of the proscuito in a pinch. I julienned it and fried it prior to stirring in with the artichokes. Used double the artichokes and also added 2 cloves of garlic. At the end of it all, 5 cups of the chicken broth/water was needed to make it creamy.

An awesome dish!!! Definitely restaurant quality. I made it as a side dish with chicken but is good enough to stand alone as a main dish. I was surprised at how quick it was, too. You won't be disappointed.

My friend doesn't eat pork so we substituted black olives fr the prosciutto. It was wonderful.

This risotto was wonderful. However, next time I would add more artichoke hearts.

Not outstanding--but very good. If you like to make risotto, try it, but you know how making risotto goes(get ready to stir).
