I found this recipe last minute....not impressed. I am of French background and this one was way overpowered by a mustard taste - and nothing more.

Perfect! I've been searching for a dressing like this-- my husband and I spent a few months working in Paris a couple years ago, and every bistro seemed to serve sides of greens tossed in this amazing dressing. I've searched everywhere for it, and this seems to taste just like what I was looking for. Toss it LIGHTLY on greens beside an omelet, or for a chèvre chaud salad... just perfect. I used all the mustard (even a little extra), canola oil instead of sunflower, and everything else just as the recipe indicates. Love it, this will be my go to everyday dressing from now on.

I used 1/2 the mustard and found it still good and mustardy... and I liked it with a pinch of sugar. Tasted nice mixed with bitter salad greens.

I have made this vinaigrette many times and with many variations. It is consistantly excellent. I just returned from Paris and I think that the vineagers in France are a little weaker than what I generally have here. I would try diluting the vinegar with a little water.

Great vinaigrette! Added only 1 tbs. of the dijon mustard based on other reviews. Also added 1/2 of a shallot, finely chopped, and 2 finely chopped garlic cloves. So tastey.

We liked this so much that I've posted a handwritten copy inside of my cupboard door where I keep many favorite "staple" recipes. As per most of the other reviewers, the addition of sugar really rounds out the flavor and yes, in the future I think I'll cut back on the Dijon just a little. It goes without saying (but I never am short on words) that minced, fresh herbs work well with this viaigrette.

I also added a small amount of white sugar and about a teaspoon of Shulas Steak Sauce. This was a very good vinaigrette.

I really enjoy this vinaigrette. I read other reviewers comments regarding the strong mustard taste so I used only half the amount of mustard. I used whole grain dijon mustard and added a small amount of white sugar, substituted the red wine vinegar w/ balsamic vinegar and added a small clove of garlic. Excellent - very tasty!!! It was thick in texture, so I added a little water - still great! I will try this also as a marinade...either way, I will most certainly use this recipe often.

I've used variations of this vinaigrette for a very long time. I came across the first version in "The Vegetarian Epicure" in the seventies -- and Nora Ephron included the one that most resembles this in her novel "Heartburn." I believe I picked that one up around 1983 or so. Over all these years, this is type of vinaigrette is still my favorite (and my husband's, and most of our friends who've dined with us). A light touch is needed, though. I think we Americans tend to overdress our salads, and therein may lie the problem with those who hated this recipe. My sister-in-law, who loved my vinaigrette when she had it at our house, hated it when she made it herself. "All I could taste was mustard," she said. "I followed your recipe exactly, what did I do wrong?"

I added 1tbsp white sugar, and some lemon juice...it got rave reviews at a dinner party!

This was delicious! I used all olive oil because I didn't have any sunflower oil on hand, and it came out fine. It was also thick enough to work well on sandwiches the next day in place of regular mustard!

Way too much mustard in this recipe! I will not be making this recipe again - I'm removing it from my recipe box.

I think of this more as a mustard vinaigrette than as a classic vinaigrette. I don't care for it when I use sunflower oil, I assume that it's the brand of oil I have (Hain). I use all olive oil and 3 teaspoons of red wine vinegar. As a reviewer suggested, I serve it with baby spinach and arugula, this is a good choice.

Best basic vinaigrette I've made. Family loves it, 14 and 16 year old sons demand this for their "house" dressing. A keeper.

Love this mustardy vinaigrette...it could easily be used as a crudite dipping sauce. Maille Dijon mustard is a great choice to use with this recipe. I like the sunflower oil and the EV olive oil combination. Another Bon Appetit keeper!

This dressing certainly is delicious. However, I'm a little puzzled by the claims that it differs substantially from other vinaigrettes in the proportion of oil to vinegar. Most recipes for vinaigrettes that I've seen call for 1 tablespoon of vinegar to anything from 3 to 6 tablespoons of oil. The Cook's Illustrated magazine determined that 1 tablespoon of vinegar to 4 1/2 tbsps of oil was best. Two to three teaspoons of vinegar (as stated in this recipe) is about equal to one tablespoon ! I think the small amount of olive oil & the larger quantity of a blander oil are more relevant here. The HUGE amount of dijon mustard clearly makes the biggest impact. The previous reviewer who compared it to a mustard aioli was right. Whatever....it tastes great. We tossed a plain arugula salad with it last night (to accompany the grilled chicken breasts with ancho chili/lime sauce from the Constant Comment site) & it was superb.

Very good, very easy. I used regular vinegar and lemon juice.

This has to be the best dressing I have made from scratch yet. I used 4 tbsp olive oil as I had no other oil around. Also added some fresh lemon juice- delectable!

This is a delicious dressing, but I would call it a mustard dressing, almost a mustard aioli. It was delicious tossed with baby spinach and arugula. At last, someone who likes vinegar in their vinaigrette. Much better than the mostly oil Craig Claibourne variety. Whoever said "be a miser with the vinegar" was crazy.
