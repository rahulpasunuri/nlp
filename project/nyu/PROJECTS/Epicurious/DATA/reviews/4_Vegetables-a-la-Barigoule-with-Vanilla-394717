About the worst recipe I've made from Epicurious. We never finished it and we very frugal and will eat stuff so as not to waste it. At least no animals died to make this. I know he is a world renown chef, so I made it as written. We thought this was bad. Little flavor and that was kind of odd the was not pleasing. I see others have given a good rating so maybe it's me.

Very unusual, this is a great way to present broccoli, even to those guests who think they hate it. Plus, it is fun to make. Next time I will try it with artichoke hearts.

This was a great, mild tasting medley of veggies and the cooking times were perfect. I have never had such an assortment of vegetables together in one dish and each one perfectly cooked. I will try artichokes next time. And parsnips like the other reviewer did.

This was a fantastic weeknight meal! In keeping with the original French recipe this one is based from, I substituted trimmed artichoke hearts (with stem) for the broccoli. I also added parsnips to the vegetable medley. Finally, I roasted the asparagus and onion on the grill for about 5 minutes in lieu of boiling them for that particular step. I think that gives it more depth of flavor.
