I thought the shrimp were too sweet - I think I would use unsweetened coconut next time, and I like the idea of putting the coconut into a food processor and making it a bit finer too.

My Husband and I loved this! yummy! i prepped everything in the afternoon and then fried when he was home from work. i had a little problem with some of the coconut coming off.. but there was still plenty on the shrimp and they had amazing flavor. perhaps next time i will throw coconut in a food processer for a couple pulses to cut it down smaller. the salsa was delicious! the shrimp were good alone too though! we ate the salsa with tortilla chips! both winning recipes!

Have been wanting to try out a recipe like this. Had all the ingredients in the cupboard, had defrosted the shrimp for something else. Decided to look this up and try it. Am I glad I did! They are fabullous and we have not tasted anything like them since our last visit to Florida. I used a marmalade sauce with them.This will be a firm favourite in our house now. Thankyou.

Wow these were delicious. My husband always orders coconut shrimp when we go out and it is hit and miss. No need to order them anymore, I will make them! Very easy and they came out perfectly, not bready and heavy but light and crunchy. I also made the salsa which was very good but frankly they were so good without it too.

I made the coconut-crusted fried shrip for mothers day and it was a huge hit. I have alwasy had a problem getting the coconut to stick to the shrip, but the egg whites did the trick which also works for any other kind of fish,pork or chicken. There is a good reason why over 120 people have written a review. This is simple, easy and tast great!

Grrreat with Pineapple/apricot salsa. I used frozen shrimp and did not butterfly. I'm sure it would even be better with fresh shrimp butterflyed. Apricot/pineapple jam hard to find. Found mine at walmart. I'm sure you could mix apricot and pineapple jams which are easier to find. These are killer hors deouveres

Made this recipe as directed (with sweetened coconut flakes) and it did not burn and came out incredible! Used canola oil and fresh shrimp.. I have made these twice now and will definitely be making again!

I have tried at least 3 of the coconut shrimp recipes here, and this one is the easiest and produced the best results. I used finely shredded unsweetened coconut as the sweetened tended to burn (in the other recipes that I tried). I refrigerated the coated shrimp for an hour before frying. I made the salsa also. It was good, but I thought the shrimp was great all by itself. This is a keeper.

I have been making these for years and everyone of my many winter houseguests requests them. We set up an assembly line in the kitchen and everyone pitches in with drink in hand. I prefer to use unsweetened coconut and for the sauce a combination of mango chutney mixed with a little horseradish sauce. These are divine and everybody wants the recipe!!!

If I could give this more forks I would. These were seriously phenomenal served w/ the pineapple-apricot salsa. Everyone loved them. Followed others advice and chilled coated shrimp in refrigerator for 2 hours before frying. Used a wok and fried in batches for about 1 minute and they turned out beautifully. Served arranged around edges of margarita glasses w/ salsa in the middle. Looked gorgeous and tasted even better.

This was fantastic and gluten free as written. To make it more healthy, I simply grilled the shrimp on my George Foreman grill at 350 degrees for 3 minutes. If served immediately, it's a little crispy. The sweetness of the coconut and the spice of the pepper marry beautifully! I served this over coconut rice (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/14936) and it was delightful. As many of the commenters on the coconut rice have pointed out, it can be spiced up, but with this shrimp, it need not be. Half the salt though. The recipe makes the rice way too salty.

Rating: 4
Just to echo all the other reviewers this was a great recipe. The shrimps came out perfectly. I do not fry a lot but this one was so easy to get right. I do not have a thermometer so I just kind of guessed and it was exactly right. I made it with the recommended sauce as well as a peanut sauce for dipping. We had Thai rice noodles and veggies in curry as a side. Everyone loved it; we went through 2 kilos of shrimp for 5 people! I will make this again soon.

Rating: 3
Would actually give it 3.5 forks. Very delicious. I made the sauce suggested along with several other concoctions (orange marmalade alone, orange marmalade plus soy sauce, sweet chile dipping sauce). I served the sauces in martini glasses and ringed with the shrimp. The orange marmalade plus soy and chile dipping sauces looked the best (bright colors), but I have to say that the pineapple sauce suggested was the best match, followed by marmalade plus soy. I'll stick with the suggested dipping sauce, even though it took a little more time. I set the temp for 350, but my candy thermometer (didn't have one for frying) didn't read higher than around 200. Still the shrimp cooked beautifully, the coconut stayed on just fine. I did chill the batter-dipped shrimp in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Maybe that helped? Next time i'd try to find more finely shredded coconut, though that's a minor point.

There's no need to overcomplicate coconut shrimp with unnecessary flavorings. This recipe serves up coconut and shrimp as perfect complements. A little sweet chili sauce on the side completes the melding of flavors. I froze the shrimp before frying to ensure crispness and to keep the batter from falling off. And while this dish was pretty labor intensive (cleaning/peeling the shrimp took forever), my guests gobbled up the double batch in 30 minutes, so I guess this is going to be standard party fare for me.

I was a little unsure of the use of cornstarch but forged ahead anyway. This turned out great. I made a little assembly line and pulled out my deep fryer and they were great. No surprises, just great coconut shrimp and not too greasy either! These were great with a Pinot Gris from Chateau st. Michelle. Delicious. I paired it with japanesee buckwheat noodles with Asian vegetables. I will make this a gain soon.

This is an excellent and easy to prepare appetizer. To be truly decadent we double dip the shrimp in coconut - after completing the corn startch, egg, coconut process we then re-dip them in egg & coconut. We also serve them with Mae Ploy brand sweet chili dipping sauce - not as sweet as the recommended salsa and a little spicy too, perfect!

Rating: 4
Loved it and so did the others that tried the dish. I used Extra Colossal shrimp (14 - 19 shrimp per pound) based on the recipe's suggestion to use 1 1/2 shrimp = 24 shrimp. The upside to using the larger shrimp was that it was less work (to coat and cook fewer shrimp) - the downside was that the shrimp didn't go as far and meant fewer servings. I might tried slightly smaller sized shrimp next time so that there are more servings. My oil must not have gotten as hot as the other reviewers. It definitely took longer than 1 minute to cook each shrimp, and they didn't come close to burning.

Rating: 4
I found that if the oil is too hot the coconut burns before the shrimp is cooked. I fried mine in a wok. The first few shrimp had the effect of cooling down the oil a little and then the rest cooked perfectly as long as I didn't let the oil sit by itself and get real hot again. I had to eat those first burned ones before anyone saw them. A terrible sacrifice!

Rating: 3
This dish was definitely yummy; however, I bypassed the double-dipping method by whisking the egg white until it formed a nice thick froth on top (but not meringue thick), poured ONLY the froth into the cornstarch mixture enough to make it wet enough to mix in all the shrimp. I then took the shrimp and dipped it into the coconut. So, with that, I saved a step and resulted in a consistent flavor throughout all the shrimp.

Rating: 4
These were great! I may add a little more cayenne pepper next time, but the recipe is delicious as-is. They were super crunchy and coconutty-- what more could you ask from a coconut fried shrimp recipe?P.S. All of Anne from Sewell's suggestions are right on the money. They make the preparation and cleanup much easier!

Rating: 4
Delicioso!! One word of caution: If you use large shrimp, you should butterfly them, contrary to what a previous reviewer wrote. If you don't butterfly large shrimp, the frying time will be longer (so that the center of the shrimp cooks), resulting in a very brown coconut coating.

These were great! I didn't have time to make the salsa, so I served it with Mango Salsa from Trader Joe's. It was delicious and a great, quick alternative!

Rating: 4
One word - WONDERFUL! This is very easy to make, but here's a few tips: You can't "shake" the cornstarch off the shrimp, so use a bowl deep enough to smack 'em on the side of it. You know deep frying can get real messy, so coat them all at once and set on a waxed paper-lined cookie sheet. Clean away all that mess, then cook in batches - don't crowed them in the cooker. They stay hot for quite a while, but are even good when they've cooled off. Use tongs - the coating stays on well, so you don't need a slotted spoon. Keep the oil clean by scooping out the too-brown coconut pieces that fall off. And most importantly, check the temp of the oil before you start frying. I set mine at 350 and it was well over 400! (Had to throw out the first shrimp - it wasn't done inside.)

This was a big hit with my dinner guests. I thought it was a bit on the sweet side, but everyone else devoured them. I contemplated skipping the salsa, but thanks to the persuasiveness of other reviewers I ended up making it. It really is the perfect accompaniment to the shrimp. I will definitely make these again, but perhaps I'll cut the sweetness by mixing in some unsweetened coconut with the sweetened coconut.

I made this recipe and served it with the Pineapple-Salsa. It stands on its own, really does not need the dip. It was such a hit, friends want me to make it everytime I go to their house.

Made this for a party on the weekend. Everyone raved and the tray was quickly emptied! I used regular shrimp rather than jumbo, and skipped the butterflying.

I made this as an appetizer for a valentine dinner. My husband ate 10 of the 12 shrimp (the recipe was halved) and he stated he cannot eat more than 4 or 5 at a restaurant, so I was very excited, until the shrimp were gone!!! :) Another reason I halved the recipe is because I also tried "coconut shrimp with tamarind ginger sauce" from this site. I wanted to see which recipe I like better, and I would have to say this one. It was easier and I felt it tasted lighter than the other. After coating the shrimp, I put them in the freezer while I prepped the main course, and had little coating come off once I fried them. I too almost did not make the salsa, but am sooo glad I did. It was the perfect finishing touch.

I am not a cook but wanted a fun dish to take to party that wasn't the usual salad or yucky dish no one eats. Once you do it once it is easy but takes time. Don't bother butterflying the shrimp, it makes your hands stink and doesn't add much. I made it twice and used regular eggs I had at home the second time. It worked pretty well. It takes a lot more oil than I thought. I am picky and I really like the way they taste. It is my new party dish!

Served this at a party and people loved it! I used 50 medium sized shrimp (I prefer appetizers that don't require 2 bites---too messy), so I doubled the cornstarch mixture. I fried them about 2 hours before the party, kept them at room temp, and then heated in a 400 degree oven for about 5-10 minutes before serving. They cooked fast in the oil, so hubby and I did it as a team, which worked out great. I did not make the dipping sauce as I felt they were sweet enough as is.

This was terrific! I used 21/25 count shrimp; I also substituted natural coconut (finely chopped in Cuisinart) & added 1 tsp. powdered sugar to the cornstarch. Don't bother butterflying the shrimp. These could absolutely be prepared in advance and kept on a baking sheet until ready to fry. Made a sauce of orange marmalade & horseradish to taste, warmed in the micro. Will make them again (after bathing suit season).

We made this ahead of time and refrigerated the shrimp in layers on trays. Then we tossed them in the deep fryer and served them with a dipping sauce made from pinapple marmalade and horseradish as an appetizer. We couldn't keep up with our guests!

This recipe is very good even when adjusted for a low-carb diet. Use a low-carb thickener (such as ThickenThin Not/Starch) instead of cornstarch. Use unsweetened coconut with Splenda added to taste. I agree with the cooks who recommended processing the coconut into finer shreds; it looks much better and wastes less coconut. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to cook, and since it's so spendy, I used only about 1/4 inch in a deep skillet. You'll have to turn the shrimp over once. Delicious and very attractive - not as much work as it would appear. Especially if you don't butterfly the shrimp (why bother?).

Rating: 4

This is wonderful! I added pineapple juice and horseradish to the eggs; lemon zest and 1 Tbspn flour to the coconut in the processor. The coconut stuck to the shrimp much easier after processing to cut. I used Surgical examination gloves (unpowdered) to work with the shrimp. They are readily available any any medical supply store and they're great for your nails, cheap (less than $7 for 100 pair), and can be pulled off for clean hands in an instant. I used a deep pot to fry in, to cut down on the splattering. I also used small, deep storage containers for the coconut,cornstarch and egg mixtures for the same reason; and I worked on wax paper. Cleanup was no problem. Also, you can use an old phone book to drain fried foods. All you need is a single sheet of paper towel to cover the pages. Drain the fried food, tear the pages off, and you're ready to go!

This recipe needed no tweaking other than picking the length/grind of coconut. I tried all three, fine, medium and course and would use fine ground coconut (almost like powder), it covered more shrimp area, easier to work with (less fell off in deep fryer) and had more flavour and certainly looked nicer once cooked. It was fabulous. I made 60 shrimp or so ahead of time (2 days) before my husbands 29th birthday party and during the party put them into a 400 degree oven right from frozen for about 8-10minutes and they were amazing. I can't make all that shrimp the day before so I had to try freezing them and it worked! Everyone wanted the recipe, including my friend B.A. who has had them many times at catered parties, no one could believe I froze them! I also served this with a horseradish, mayo, lime, and dijon mustard dipping sauce which was yummy and had a nice bite to it!! I will make these once a month forever just as a treat! Everyone loved them - the plate was empty in minutes!!

This is similar to another easier, but just as good recipe. To cut time and mess with excellent results, mix the cornstarch and coconut together. Dip in egg white, then in the coconut mixture. Bake in a 400 degree oven on an oil covered cookie sheet for about 10 minutes or so, depending on the size of your shrimp. Microwave some raspberry preserves until melted and use as the dipping sauce. EASY, EASY EASY and just as good!

I have made this several times now. The first time I bought the jumbo shrimp...too expensive. The next time I bought large shrimp, shelled and deveined; it cost about 1/4 of the jumbo price.

The shrimp were REALLY DELICIOUS and easy to prepare. It was the smokey, messy frying that might keep me from revisiting this recipe. Having a home fry device might have helped. I used mangos instead of apricot/pineapple as the fruit in the salsa, also pureeing a banana to swirl into the salsa as a little touch of the tropics. I cooked them before guests came and kept them in a warm oven, they handled this well. In the end, I couldn't argue with the results, my guests devoured these crusty shrimp like they hadn't eaten in weeks

I made this dish as an appetizer for Christmas dinner. Although the dish itself was better than I've had in restaurants, the preparation can be cumbersome and frought with mishaps if you are not experienced. Because I had many courses, I found that preparing ahead of time was much easier for this recipe. I peeled and deveined the shrimp the day before and placed them on ice in the refrigerator. I made the dipping sauce ahead of time as well. **CAUTION** make sure the the oil is not too hot!! The shrimp cook in seconds so standing guard is a necessary thing. For the dipping sauce, I embellished a bit and used a pineapple/appricot blend with ginger and lemon zest. I have since tried this recipe using a marmalade dipping sauce which seems to compliment it better. The strong tangy sweetness of orange marmalade mixed with ginger seemed to work better with this delectable dish. All in all, makes a wonderful presentation and leaves them begging for more!

We had it for a new Years celebration and it was outstanding!! My husband couldnt get enough and has begged me to make it next weekend/ It is very rich but sooo good... even our 14 year old golden retriever jumped up and grabbed the last piece (sans salsa)....

This was excellent!!! Had it as an apetizer with raspberry sauce & a raspberry ale @ a fine restaurant in our area. When I found your recipe for the shrimp I made it for my husband & myself & we both agree this recipe far outweighed the one @ the restaurant. Am looking in recipe file for raspberry sauce that I feel will complement dish. Also found the same raspberry ale. We will be surprising our friends with this dish around the holidays.

Great recipe. Very easy. I tried adding some brown sugar and pineapple juice to the eggs to give it some sweetness. Excellent.

While at the beauty shop reading Bon Appetit I came across this receipt for coconut shrimp. I only had a used envelope in my purse and used it to write down the receipt. My husband and I love coconut shrimp but I had never made it. We have had coconut shrimp in many restaurants, but have found this receipt to be the best. The first time I made it my husband looked leary because we found it to be messy and time consuming. I have made it on four different occasions since then and find it worth the work, as have our guests. My only complaint was they wished I had made more. The last time I made this receipt I used 45 shrimp and prepared and refrigerated them ahead of time. I find the smaller shrimp sweeter and more tender then the prawns. I use the apricot dip receipt but add more jalapeno chili's to make it a bit spicier. Thank you, now we don't have to go out to eat to have one of our favorites.

Very Good! Served it with remoulade sauc. My friends loved it and asked me to make it again. I used the largest prawns I could buy and they were pretty to look at and delicious.

Delicious! Prepare to get messy, though. First time I made this, I had cornstarch and coconut on the counters, under my fingernails, in my hair and probably on the ceiling. Looked like a flour bomb had exploded. But it's well worth the mess (particularly if you can get somebody else to clean it up). During shrimp season we catch our own shrimp so we're always looking for ways to prepare them. This is definitely one of the best. Try serving with a hot Chinese mustard--spectacular blend of flavors!

My guests said It was the best shrimp they ever tasted. It was not hard to make and it was great looking..I served it with a rasberry salsa and I also add some pineapple on the dish along with the shrimp and salsa. Looked good and tasted better than good!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Easy and delicious. I make the salsa with canned pineapple, no apricots, it goes perfectly with the shrimp. Can't wait to make them for company!

Made this for my parents during a visit after seeing it in my mother's magazine. Excellent! I left out the jalapeno in the salsa -- still fantastic! Have been searching for a coconut shrimp recipe like this since trying them in California. This is a great appetizer and well worth the effort and the calories.

Excellent appetizer! The accompanying salsa was wonderful and I have since used it with pork and fish dishes. Everyone loved this dish when I served it and it was fairly simple to make. I will definately make this dish again!

This recipe is so easy and incredibly delicious. I put a tiny bit of horseradish in the salsa to give it a litte kick.

A good friend of mine made this delicious shrimp for our Carribean International Cooking Dinner. It was fabulous, and the salsa added a nice touch. It was well worth the effort!
