Has anyone tried making this recipe with Splenda instead of sugar?

After reading the reviews, I was worried about making this. I don't know why people had so many problems. I followed it and it was AMAZING. I've never had Pavlova before, but will definitely have it again! It was light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth, creamy, sweet, and simply perfect. The presentation is gorgeous. It DID take much longer for my meringue to form stiff peaks, since I used granulated (not superfine) sugar. My eggs were cold, too. Honestly, this was one of the most impressive and delicious things I've ever made (and I'm a TOTAL foodie).

I made this recipe and unfortunately used someone's suggestion to bake it in a cake pan. DON'T do that! It stuck to the sides and broke up. This was even in a springform pan. Also stuck to the top oven shelf, so make sure your pav has plenty of room above to grow. Next time, I'll make individual ones to make easier and prettier to serve for a nice dinner.

I have made other pavlovas and I thought this was a great simple recipe. I made it for Father's day and it was loved by all. Light and wonderful.

I've made this about a dozen times. People fight over it! I think the variable in other people's efforts might relate to Altitude and humidity issues. Todd's suggestions might help.

Made this for an afternoon tea and it was a big hit. I used the advice from the previous reviewers and made 24 smaller ones and they only cooked for a total of 30 minutes. Big wow factor and easy way to use up egg whites!

I followed the recipe exactly (with Todd's suggestions) making 12 individual meringues instead of one. They looked gorgeous before they went into the oven but when I just took them out they are cracked and look bumpy and unattractive. Any suggestions??????

Easy to make, delicious and impressive. Fresh light choice for dessert after a heavy meal. Followed Todd's tips from earlier review. I served at Christmas--was beautiful to present topped with blueberries, strawberries, & kiwi. Many compliments & requests for seconds.

Magnificent! I followed the recipe exactly (with all of Todd's suggestions, which were really helpful), but made 36 mini pavlovas instead of one large one. They were perfect--crisp on the outside, soft inside--and wonderful with macerated strawberries and whipped cream. Everybody loved them! I'll be making these again.

I love pavlova and was looking for a good recipe this one fit the bill. Thank you to everyone who gave tips. I made mine on a day it was raining cats and dogs so it didn't rise as high as normal but still it was crisp on the outside (even the bottom) and marshmallowy in the middle. Topped with whipped cream and rhubarb compote it was delicious. Everyone went back for seconds.

You can't go wrong with Todd's tips down there. I obtained the world's most perfect pavlova recipe from an Australian friend but sadly lost it- this recipe, finessed with Todd's suggestions, is a near perfect substitute for that lost recipe. My only issue is that the cooking time is not sufficient, but I believe that may be an oven dependent variable. Key points- add the sugar slowly after soft peaks are formed with the egg whites and other ingredients, add the boiling water a little at a time to avoid using more than needed, always beat to the proper consistency before proceeding to the next stage, and know your oven.

My guests loved it! I topped it with whipped cream and mixed berries. I added the boiling water gradually and left it in the turned off oven for two hours per Todd's instructions below. Next time I will leave it in the oven for only one hour per the instructions as the Pavlova did crack in a few places.

My guests loved it! I topped it with whipped cream and thawed frozen berries (from Trader Joe's.) I followed Todd's detailed instructions below--adding the hot water slowly and leaving it in the oven for two hours. Next time I will leave it in the oven only one hour as the Pavlova cracked in a few places.

I have been making Pavlova for years. The secret to avoid any weeping or a guey bottom is to add the sugar slowly NOT all at once. I have never had a problem using parchment paper.

Delicious! Very fun and easy to make, my mother raved about it (and she's tough to please). It took much longer than 3-5 minutes to whip the eggs and what-not - I just followed the physical description of what it should look like and tried to be patient. Beautiful!

To cook from Santa Rosa: So sorry that your pavlova was sticky/gooey on the bottom. Suspect that it was likely because you used parchment rather than foil as the recipe directs. I always use foil, shiny side up, as per the advice of my Aussie friend. Think it has something to do with even heat distribution and reflection. Don't despair, give it another try and you will be rewarded with a truly gorgeous pavlova. Good luck and cheers!

Well, I studied all your excellent tips carefully, even used an oven thermometer to assure proper temps, and my meringue came out very, *very* gooey on the bottom. Couldn't even slide it off the parchment so used an exacto knife to trim the parchment around the meringue to avoid breaking it to pieces! Would there have been any way for me to check for doneness or otherwise assure it? Thanks.

This is a gorgeous dessert that always receives oohs, aahs and contented moans of pleasure! I learned a few tips from an Australian friend (pavola originated in Australia and is almost a national dish) that make it fool-proof. 1) For best volume, egg whites must be room temperature. 2) Bowl/beaters must be scrupulously clean. 3) Beat egg whites and other ingredients (minus sugar) until soft peaks form. Then add sugar gradually and continue beating to stiff peak stage. 4) Add the boiling water by tablespoon rather than all at once as it may not be necessary to use all the water. Beat after each addition until egg whites become glossy and very stiff. 5) Bake as directed but leave in oven to cool/dry for at least 2 hours. 6) If kitchen is very humid, egg whites may not beat to desired volume/consistency or the finished pavlova may soften and become a little sticky. A good pav should be pale golden in colour, delicately crisp on the outside, dry but tender on the inside. It should not be hard/crunchy nor soft and marshmallow-like inside. Hope you find these comments helpful as you make a beautiful pavlova.

I followed this recipe exactly, but unfortunately the crispy delicious crust was very very thin. It may be because of the humidity. However I will try again with some adjustments because I really think this has the potental to be amazing. I served with unsweetened whipped cream mixed berries on top.

Sorry, I did not follow this recipe exactly; however, pavlova is delicious. I used egg whites with a little cream of tartar, followed the baking instructions. I used instant pudding with 1 1/2 cups milk instead of the 2 cups the package calls for, mixed with 1/2 of a small container of whipped topping for the filling. I topped it with 1/2 can of cherry pie filling. It was super easy, and all my guests were highly impressed!

To the cook in Arizona - I find my pavlovas usually crack on cooling, but as they are covered with cream, etc., no one need know, and they still taste delicious!

I have not tried this particular recipe, but would like to add that pavlova is delicious covered with whipping cream and a combination of sliced strawberries, kiwi fruit, banana and passion fruit (if you can get it). I also add a crumbled Cadbury's Flake chocolate bar. My husband pours a little pure maple syrup over his - but then he is the Canadian and I am the Aussie!

A lovely pavlova. I made it with fruit and fruit sauce for a dairy allergic guest. I'm sure it's even better with whipped cream added. I'll make this again.

I made this today - everything went together well and when I looked through the glass door of my oven, all was going great. However, when I came to the stage where I turned off my oven to leave it for 1 hour, after about thirty minutes it had all cracked and fallen apart!!! Any ideas from the great cooks out there, what went wrong. !!!

I have made this desert for several dinner parties, and had people fighting over seconds. The best topping combination so far was kiwi, pomegranate, oranges, and bananas. My only complaint is that the eggs take a very long time to stiffen up, usually I have to beat them for 10 minutes or longer. I will be making this again for my next party.

I love this recipe. It is easy and almost foolproof if you follow the instructions exactly. It has never let me down. My family loves it and it is now a "Spring Time" favourite. The only suggestion I have for those with problems is perhaps a stand mixer is needed. I don't find it much work at all and goes together in minutes. Connie

This is the fourth Easter in a row that I'm making this, due to popular demand. The outside is delicately crisp, while the inside is reminiscent of meringue, oh my heaven on a fork. I always pass extra fruit.

I tried to make this recipe twice. The eggs would not stiffen no matter how long I beat them. I was very annoyed. In the end I fell back on an old meringue recipe I have had for years. It was less work and worked beautifully. I will probably try this again, only to see what I did wrong, and if I can perfect it. Look forward to another review

I have made this recipe 4 times and have had varied results - there are a couple of tricks First, it helps to have a standing mixer - it is difficult to get the egg whites as stiff as they should be without one. The other tip is to follow what another reviewer wrote, beat the egg whites until fluffy and then begin adding the other ingredients. It is also helpful to know your oven, the temperature and the cooking time are critical to getting the slightly crunchy outside and marshmallow like inside. This recipe is a little difficult, but can turn out excellent.

Somethings terribly off with this recipe. Maybe it's ths water. I tried doubling it, and ended up throwing out a dozen watery eggs. I then went back to my mother's recipe (no water, just cornstarch, lemon juice and powdered sugar). E-mail me for the recipe.

A WOW! This Pavlova differs in an important way from the dry and crisp version of meringue. Here there is a crisp (but not hard) pale golden jacket filled with the unexpected delight of glossy marshmallow! It holds its shape perfectly, and is easy to slice and serve. I piled blackberries and raspberries atop the whipped cream center

This wasn't at all like the Pavlova I had at Balthzar in NYC. It wasn't creamy in the middle, just taked like cooked egg whites. I was quite dissapointed.

This is a wonderful recipe and has turned out beautifully for me each time that I have made it. Crisp on the outside and velvety smooth on the inside - this dessert is sure to please even the non-fruit lover in your life. I use a mixture of kiwi, strawberry and banana...magnificant!

This recipe was a complete disaster! I followed the instructions word by word. The inside of the pavlova turned out soft and soggy. I was making it for a pot luck lunch. I threw out the pavlova and found another recipe which turned out beautifully! If you don't like your pavlova soft and mushy inside I would not recommend this recipe!

Excellent pavlova! I grew up in New Zealand and pavlova was always my favourite dessert. I've tried several pavlova recipes here, but have not found one that turns out as well as this one.

This turned out wonderfully, however I held off adding the sugar until after the egg whites were 3/4 stiff (this is how most recipes tell you to make meringue). I also decreased the amount of sugar to 1 cup. I first tried making this recipe using store-bought egg whites in a carton, but they didn't beat up stiff enough. I suspect there was some yolk left in the white. When I tried it again using eggs that I seperated myself, it was perfect.

Wonderful! My Australian boyfriend and I made this dessert together during one of our first dates, and it was perfect! It reminds him of home, and it reminds us of falling in love, and now it's going to become a tradition in our household for special occassions. And this recipe is much better than Pavlova's that I've had in a couple of restaurants that are crunchy all the way through. We followed the timing exactly, and it came out with a beautifully soft centre and crispy shell. Very sweet.

I am from Australia ....where pavlova originated from and now live in Canada. I was missing a bit of home and this did the trick it was absolutley fabulous. So easy and very delicious.

It is my first attempt at making this lovely dessert. I made this for a party, not knowing whether it will turn out well. The result was fabulous! It did not sink at all (I've heard a lot of horror stories about how they sink right before your eyes)! It was nice and crispy outside, and full of marshmellow inside. However, I think I'l cut down the sugar next time as it is too sweet for my liking.

Pavlova was my favourite dessert as a little girl growing up in Australia. So I was delighted to find this great recipe. The only thing that was missing was Passionfruit. I have never been able to find this fruit here.

This a wonderful summer dessert. It is great with sliced bananas and probablybest of all (as far as my children were concerned) mix the whipped cream with smashed up Heath bars, place another Pavlva on the top and add more whipped cream mixture.!!!
