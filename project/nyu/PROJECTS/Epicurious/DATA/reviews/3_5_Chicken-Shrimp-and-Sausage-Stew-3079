I gave this 3 forks, not 4, because it's definitely delicious, but not exceptional. I did use 1/2 hot Italian sausage and 1/2 sweet Italian sausage. For everything else I followed the recipe. It was super yummy and was enjoyed by all, but there was not anything particularly exceptional about it. I felt like it could have used a little more flavor, believe it or not. Maybe next time I'll use more herbs and also try the olive juice as others have suggested.

Great recipe! Make sure you use a good quality andouille sausage--it makes all the difference. Followed the recipe but cut up the chicken into bite size pieces before adding it back to the stew. With a good high-powered range, you can cut the cooking times by about 20%

A really great recipe. I invested a bit extra in some high quality smoked paprika from Spain (Hungarian is also great) and am so glad that I did. Cheaper paprika leaves a slight after taste. I found that the only thing missing was a bit of acidity. I used capers instead of olives (just felt like it would be a nice touch) and then added some of the caper juice to the stew as well. I really feel like it balanced things out nicely. Served with soft polenta once, and pearled couscous the second time. I also added some nutmeg to the chicken before searing it and monitored the salt / pepper closely to make sure I brought the dish to its full potential. Delish!

To motzof4: Many supermarkets carry packets of fresh herbs, and with thyme, in particular, the difference between fresh and dried is a real one (dried thyme, to quote the late and much lamented Laurie Colwin, is primarily useful if you need "a weird stage prop"). That said, a decent rule of thumb when substituting dried herbs for fresh in a recipe is to use half the amount called for.

This was easy and delicious. I couldn't find the sausage but I had some smoked sausage which worked out great. I just wish that people who list fresh herb as ingredients would give the equivalent in dried herbs. I mean how many people have a herb garden at home??

I'd say 3.5 forks is spot on. It is a simple dish that really works. I made it as a "clean out the protein in my freezer" meal and even in that mode it worked out. I did get fresh hot pork sausage. Am sure fresh shrimp and an organic chicken would have sent it to 4 stars. Only thing I added was some fresh flat leaf parsley when serving and that did seem to help brighten the flavors a lot.

This is probably the most outstanding stew I have made. I loved the combination of tastes. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used the oil brine from the olives. I used chicken breasts instead of the thighs-and sauteed them briefly-delicious!

Made this last night and it was a big hit! it is so rich and delicious. I couldn't find Andouille sausage so substituted some chorizo and I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which I shredded after the first 25 minutes of simmering. Very very good. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight.

Very nice winter meal. Everyone loved it. I substituted capers instead of olives for a great contrast, but no one else in the house was so brave!

I first made this recipe doing a search on ingredients that I had in the house and we were just TOO tired to shop or even go out. I have now made it 3 times and it just keeps getting better with every revision. The main thing is since this is inspired by Portugal cooking, I do use linguica sausage instead of andouille. Also, I don't like green bell peppers, only the red ones, so that is all I use. In addition, I only cook for two, so I eyeball the ingredients to about 1/3, but this is not the space shuttle(little bit of FL humor), so it does not have to exact and it works. Each batch has been a delight to dine on and this dish will be added to our 10- 14 day menu rotation. just keep saving those left over white wines and green olives!

Rating: 4
I've made this dish every winter for several years now. We prefer chorizo to andouille (too hot) and eliminated the shrimp (didn't like the texture). It's just great on a cold night with a loaf of good crusty bread! So worth the mess in the kitchen!

This was delicious. I did add a pinch of saffron to the chicken broth (warmed)and used cooked shrimp with the tails removed added just at the end. I also used hot links in place of andouille.

Delicious and surprisingly simple. Green olives set this dish apart from a more standard stew. Added some cayenne for additional heat. Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and shredded meat before adding back. Used chicken sausage--one link hot, one link sweet. Served over brown Basmati rice, accompanied by foccacia garlic bread and endive salad with apples and gorgonzola. Bitter/sour flavors of salad seemed to compliment the stew.

Rating: 3
Served over cous cous with a side of the crunchy green bean salad. No one found it to be too heavy a meal, as some other reviewers did. I cheated & used precooked shrimp which I had let defrost & added at last minute when stew was piping hot to keep it from overcooking & reaching rubberdom. Added chickpeas & smoked chipotle pepper (about 1-1/2 TBL). Used chicken sausage. Will try again & make ahead next time.

Rating: 4
Hearty is an understatement! Just delicious, but not a great choice for spring. I just happened to have all the ingredients and have been wanting to try this dish. I agree with the reviewer about the shrimp not tasting that great as leftovers. Next time will I hold some out and add fresh shrimp when reheating leftovers. I used kielbasa, but will try turkey italian sausage next time to cut some calories. I didn't like dealing with the chicken bones either, so will use boneless skinless thighs next time. This is a meat lover's dish--very filling. I think I'll like it even better on a cold winter night.

Rating: 4
Made this last night, and we loved it. I added a little cayenne, cumin, chili powder, and juice from one lime as I thought that the paprika alone was not enough...just my opinion. I also used skin/boneless chk breast and smoked turkey sausage to make it a low fat meal.....one of the best I have made. Will make this again, and again. It reminds me more cajun, than spanish/portugese.

Rating: 3
quite good, but a couple things I'll change next time. I love shrimp, and it was good the first night, but lousy in the leftovers. The chicken thighs were annoying to break up, I'll chop them into bite sized pieces next time. My hubby doesn't like olives so I used artichoke hearts per someone else's suggestion, and that worked great. I also added white beans (a first for me), carrots, celery and only red bells. I used dried herbs and wasn't shy with my seasonings. I also ran out of white wine, so I added quite a bit of red, and I loved the added depth that gave it. This made A LOT of food, luckily it was tasty, cuz we ate it for 3+ days.

Rating: 3
Skinless chicken thighs would work well now that I've prepared this once. And I used venison sausage, which worked also. This is best served in a big bowl, as the chicken thighs will break apart and it's like a soup, although you still need to cut up the chicken. After it was served, what was left over was essentially a great vegetable stock, as we had eaten most of the meat and shrimp, so I froze it for use whenever I need stock.

I used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs from Bell & Evans, omitted the oregano, used more garlic. As are all stews, this is even better the next day.

FABULOUS! Heeding comments about this being better the next day, I made it the day before, then added the shrimp just before serving. I doubled garlic because I didn't add oregano or thyme, and it was perfect.

Made as directed, except for being more generous with the amounts of oregano and garlic (would have done the same with thyme, but what a pain!) and added about a quarter teaspoon cayenne for heat. Will add more than that next time. Don't skip the shrimp! Cooked the chicken thighs seasoned with Paul Prudhomme Poultry Seasoning, then removed (most of) skin and bones after letting it sit overnight. Delish!

Rating: 3
Loved this -- made a few variations -- added celery, some shallots and used chicken sausage,and the beans suggested by others. Served it for dinner, my only comment was that it was a little thin, needed some more body. Perhaps if I had made it a day ahead it would have been thicker.

This is a delicious and very flavorful recipe that is perfect for a fall/winter meal even though I made it during the summer using my fresh herbs. Afterall, I was in the A/C! I followed the ingredients in the recipe making the following changes. I used turkey kielbasa, added about a tablespoon more of both fresh oregano & thyme and added more garlic. These changes were just a matter of personal preference. I did take the advice of a previous reviewer and added a couple of cans of small white beans. Excellent suggestion! This should have been part of the original recipe. I did not use the white wine but added additional chicken broth in its place. Perfect. I loved the olives and shrimp in the recipe. It only adds another layer of flavor. Prior to serving I cut up the boneless chicken thighs into small bitesize chunk. BE FORWARNED!!! If using fresh herbs, which I believe is the only way to go, stripping tiny leaves off the stems of thyme can be tedious. Use your thumb and forefinger and, beginning at the top of the stem, gently scrape the leaves off in a downward motion trying to avoid any of the thicker stems. Also, depending on your knife skills, be prepared for some chopping. This is a great recipe served with some crusty bread to mop up the delicious broth. Happy cooking!

If hussey2 from Ft. Walton Beach, FL ever visits Las Vegas, I'd like her (or him) to come and make this dish for me because I found it uninspired. All the chopping was made bearable by the wine And yes, I had a glass or two while making this dish- that was the highlight of dinner.

Rating: 4
Incredible!! Made a few substitutions because of what I had on hand, but I don't think they changed the flavors of the dish. I happened to have a pound of cooked shrimp and a package of Johnsonville Brats in the fridge, so I weant searching on Epicurious. Turned out I had some bone-in, skin on chicken breasts in the freezer, that'll work for the chicken. Subbed a 28-oz can of crushed otmatoes in puree- maybe this had something to do with the woderful texture I got. Used one green and one orange pepper, and dried herbs. Couldn't imagine a more wonderful result. It must be killer with the fresh herbs. Do try this - sometimes it seems weird to combine three different meats, but this totally works! Incredible!!!

outstanding! i can't believe the reviews that said to skip the shrimp. the shrimp make the dish and i doubled what was called for. it was screaming for white beans so i added some from the can and it was oh so good. next time i'll take the chicken off the bones before serving just to reduce the hassle factor. and yes, it is even better the next day. we are having it again tonight and maybe tomorrow if there is any left. delicious!

Rating: 4
I have made this dish more times than I can count. Instead of the andouille sausage I use a pound of Johnsonville hot sausage with casings removed and then add a half pound sliced (at an angle) turkey kielbasa. I drain the cooked sausages on paper towels to get rid of the excess grease. I also use skinless/boneless chicken thighs. The Italian style diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic and basil are much more flavorful. This recipe is perfect for large crowds and can be left to simmer on the stove with occasional stirring so you're not chained to the kitchen. I've made it many times before hand and then warmed it up in the crock pot. It smells up the house nicely and the frozen leftovers are very good.

I love this recipe. My brother, Rupert, told me about it. I made it exactly as written and used Wadniski's Kielbasa. Living in this part of the country, it is the best for cold weather. And it is better the next day!I give the recipe only to close friends.

Wow is this spicy. I followed the directions exactly but cut down on the onions a little bit. I also used dried herbs and removed the skin off the chicken thighs.

I have had left overs 2 nights and it tastes better the second night.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe very closely, except I used Amy's Chicken Andouille Sausage to reduce the fat a little and skinlesss chicken thighs. I think the shrimp are definitely worth it and fresh herbs are a given unless really dire straits. Very tasty and lots of great leftovers.

I made this for company - and everyone loved it. I prefer red and yellow peppers to green, so I reversed the amounts. Also made it two days in advance and boiled the sauce down awhile to thicken it. After reading the other reviews, made sure to make enough for leftovers!

This has become a staple in my house. If fresh herbs aren't available, dried at half the amount will do. Why not add the shrimp? I don't understand the previous reviewers comment. Everything adds to this dish. I usually add more chicken as the sauce is plentiful. The olives are a fantastic addition. I've tried it without and I've tried it with less. Neither is as good as the original. Polska Kielbasa is fine if andouille isn't available. Hearty, satisfying, good enough for company.

This was delicious and hearty. I omitted the olives. I cooked the stew covered for about 45 minutes, then took the chicken off the bone, tearing it apart and putting it back in the stew. I then cooked it for about 20 minutes uncovered. There was sausage, chicken and shrimp in every bite. This reminded me of my gumbo and I think next time I'll add a crab. I shared this with some friends and one of them made it the following weekend for her family. This is a definite keeper!!!

this soup is a favorite in my house and it is relativly low carb for those on south beach diet (as long as you don't eat bread with it as recipie suggests). when using dried herbs instead of fresh, its always a good idea to cut the amount down by a third (1 tbsp fresh= 1/3 tbsp dry), as dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor. delicious and simple and great for leftovers!

Lots to prep and cook but wonderful! I made this for my family, as well as for my Culinary Arts class. All loved it. I don't think the shrimp adds anything extra to the dish though, so I omitted it the second time.

I will not rate this recipe--I have some questions. People have replaced fresh herbs with dry without complaint, however I did the same and it tastes too strong (herby?). Why did the recipe ask for season with salt/pepper until the very end? I will try this recipe again...it is very simple but I will go with fresh (always best!) the next time around! Will rate the next go-around!

Unfornuantely, I had to make this without the olives, as my husband won't touch anything that even has the word olive anywhere. However, it is very good, and I'll bet even better tomorrow. I will make it again WITH the olives, and he will just have to deal with it!!! Fresh herbs are always better, and if you don't use them all, simply wash them, pat them very dry, and place in a paper bag for a few days, and viola, you have fresh dried herbs.

This is a delicious recipe and it always get raves. I've made it a number of times and, from time-to-time, made some additions. A can of artichoke hearts, drained, is great with all the other flavors. Mushrooms can be added, and I've added celery root once. Combining black and green olives is fun too. While the recipe is wonderful the way it is, if you want to 'play' with it, these ingredients work well. As other reviewers have said, Italian sausage is a good alternative if you don't have andouille. Enjoy a great eat!

OK, make that 3 1/2 forks. This really is a straightforward recipe that bears a lot of resemblance to creole jambalayas, only not as much seasoning, and the rice is not cooked in the stew. Like all "stews," there is a lot of latitude with the proportions, but I made this by the book. Maybe a little tomato-ey, but gosh, how can you not like it? It has a very good general appeal, and reheats extremely well. A definite candidate for the do-ahead occasion. Go for it.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. I made half the recipe for my wife and myself. Used dried herbs since the amount of fresh required didn't justify the expense. Used one red and one green pepper, cutting them in 1/2in. pieces to give more mouth feel when eating. I didn't have chicken broth so I used beef broth and substituted hot Italian sausage for the Anduille. I really think that any broth [chicken, beef of fish stock] would work since all three meats/fish are in the dish. It was even better the second day.

Rating: 4
Even though it was New Year's Day and what, like Day 1000 of the grocery workers' strike? I was still able to get all the ingredients and make a delicious stew reminiscent of Jambalaya. I think this stew works for people who generally don't like to eat heavy Italian or spicy food; that would be my boyfriend.

I used a milder smoked sausage and diced tomatoes that come with the jalapeno peppers. I am amused by the fractions for the chopped peppers. Just use one large red pepper and two large green. Also one of those very large Spanish onions made three cups. Throw them into the processor and that will help streamline the job. A great stew!

My husband and I both enjoyed this stew and I will definitely make this one again. Made just as in the recipe except we can't get the right sausage so I used another (bratwurst I think it was). Makes quite a lot of stew - I think it would certainly serve more than 6.

This recipe provides the "bones" of a fool proof dish that allows for a lot of variation in case you don't have all the ingredients on hand, without comprosing the outcome. For instance, I substituted a can of stewed tomatoes for diced, instead of chicken broth I used the leftover liquid/broth from the mussels I happened to have eaten the night before, instead of shrimp I used mussels, instead of a dry white wine I used a merlot, instead of chicken thighs I used a combination of boneless skinless breasts and drumsticks. Also, I didn't have any bell peppers, so to the onions I added carrots and celery and let them saute until carmelized. With as many liberties as I took with this recipe, it almost doesn't deserve to be called the same dish, but it was delicious! It seems pretty fool proof and very flexible. I enjoyed it more than any jumbalaya I've ever had and more than any paella I've ever had. The flavors seemed cleaner and less muttled if that makes any sense and I liked that it could stand up on its own and didn't need to be served over rice. Make sure whatever pan you use is large enough - once you add all the ingredients and the liquid it adds up to a lot - more than I expected anyway! On the whole, very easy to prepare once you've prepped your ingredients. Do NOT skimp on dried herbs unless you absolutely have to, and once ready to serve I sprinkled some more finely chopped thyme and oregano on top of the dish.

I made this with black olives because I was out of green and it was very delicious. Probably missed something with the olives but even without was excellent. I used andouille shipped from Jacob's in La Place, LA. It is by far the best andouille we have ever had (and we are from New Orleans). They have a website and you can have andouille shipped. Their tasso is great too as is everything (I am not related to anyone at Jacob's, just love the stuff). I eat it in my green beans, smothered cabbage, jumbalaya, you name it. Anyway, this was very good and my husband thoroughly enjoyed it. Better the next day too.

This is excellent; a great mix of flavors. We have made this twice now and it has become our favorite of dishes like this. I used chicken breasts cut up and dried herbs the 1st time and fresh the second. I also had a sharp paprika so it was quite zippy. Served over white rice, it was lovely with crusty bread. With the rice it is reminiscent of a jambalaya or even a paella. The full recipe certainly makes more than 6 servings; I would guess closer to 10.

My family adored this dish although I did have to modify it due to some ingredients I didn't have or didn't care to buy. For example, I used plain old smoked sausage, I used one whole onion, two chopped green peppers, 6 heaping T. granulated garlic, 4-5 heaping T. Italian seasoning (dry and containing marjoram, rosemary, basil, and sage in additional to oregano and thyme), 1 T. thyme (dry), and I also substituted extra chicken broth for wine; I also didn't need any additional salt or pepper. [Well, okay, technically it's almost a whole new recipe, but...] Also, I cooked it and then put it in the fridge and served it the next day (after both my oldest son and myself had helped ourselves to a bowl). It was perfectly spiced to our palates when rewarmed, especially when asiago pepper toast was served alongside. Mmmm, mmmmm, mmmm!

Rating: 2
i was a little disappointed by this recipe. but that may be because i used dried herbs rather than fresh, which gave the stew a little bit of a grittiness. i also had the impression that it would be more flavorful and spicy rather than mellow and slightly bland. i would also have stopped cooking the onions before they carmelized to gain a little texture in the stew, as it seemed more like soupy sauce with giant lumps of meat floating around. although it wasn't to my taste, i do think this could make a wonderfully hearty meal. also, if you cook the sausage before cutting it into rounds, it will save you a great deal of mess.

Rating: 4
I prepared this a day ahead of my party to let the falvors blend. I used only 12 oz of sausage. I used approximate amounts of the vegetables and increased the wine by half. I cut down on the paprika and did not use the olives....all because I was afraid it would be too spicy for my guests. They loved it!!!! I also used 3lbs of chicken and threw in more shrimp. My guests eyed each other as they helped themselves to seconds. I had only broth left and used it as shrimp soup base the next day.

This was a great dish. We were entertaining a couple who don't like spicy food so we used Kielbasa - it was still great.

This dish is very tasty and easy to serve to a group. Serving with rice or polenta is a great idea. Crusty bread to soak up all the juices is a must!

This recipe has replaced the usual chili during our Super Bowl party since 1998. I also made this dish for a baby shower this past April, and the guests all loved it. I didn't have any thyme on hand once, and substituted cumin (1 TBS) and usually add a shake or two of red pepper flakes, with wonderful results. It's great over rice and grilled polenta. A definate keeper.

This dish was fabulous! Excellent flavor - an extremely hearty and tasty dish to make for an Autumn or winter dinner. Absolutely no need for shrimp - the spice of the sausage combined with the garlic and other spices permeate the dish. Definitely not for those wary of spicy food. Use of true andouille sausage a MUST. DEFINITELY tastes fantastic the next day, too (one could even say almost BETTER!!) I got many "atta-girls" for this one! :)

This was even better the second day. The flavors really had time to meld and blend when it sat in the refrigerator overnight. I made it for visiting relatives, and they loved it. I tend to agree with the reviewer who thought the shrimp could be omitted. The chicken and andouille provide loads of meat, and the shrimp kind of gets lost. For a more economical version, a little extra chicken would do just fine. Very yummy, savory, and satisfying.

This is a very rich, hearty, and flavorful stew. The only trick to making it great is to use the best andouielle (or other spicy) sausage you can find, as this is the flavor that permiates the stew.

This is a great recipe for entertaining. Can be made the day before, and all you need is a salad and bread and you have a great meal!! All my guests have really loved it.

I'm allergic to shrimp so I substituted clams with great results. This dish freezes well so make an extra batch.

This was bland. Broth needs some oomph, like curry, cumin, etc. Shrimp is a waste in this. We thought garbanzo beans would be an excellent substitute for the shrimp. . .less costly, more nutritious, and a different texture. Sausage did not provide enuf of a kick for us.

It was easy and it had something for everyone in one pot.

This is a terrific recipe. It gets even better after a couple of days. I've used Italian sausage in place of the andouille and it worked fine. Brought it to a potluck and had tons of requests for the recipe.

Although this was an easier recipe to make, I felt that it was too salty. There are much better recipes for those craving a hearty stew during the colder months.

What an indulgence...this robust dish blends such wonderfully complex flavors! I can't imagine this without the andouille, but I guess there are other ways to kick up the heat. I, too, used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the fattier thighs--the sausage provided plenty of that. Spanish yellow (saffron) rice was perfect with this!

A great recipe that got raves at dinner. I made a double batch using kielbasa and boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of andouille sausages and the chicken thighs, and served it over rice. Mmmm!

This is absolutely one of my favorite recipes and wonderful for entertaining (it is easy and tastes great reheated). I use low fat kielbasa rather than andouille sausage, and cut up pieces of boned and skinned chicken breast rather than thighs, but otherwise follow the recipe as written. Try it!!!

Wonderful, but wasn't spicey enough for us, so we served it with tabasco sauce on the side.

This is my favorite dish! I add creole spice to it, such as Emeril's Bayou Blast. A bottle of wine and some crusty bread and I'm in heaven.

This was a great meal!! Leftovers? No way. I served it with a good crusty french bread and salad. Using the fresh herbs is a must. I will make it over and over again.

I rarely try a recipe before I serve it to guests and this one was no exception. My guests thought it was fabulous with crusty bread and a dry white wine. It is superb the next day (if there is any leftover). I can't wait to make it again come fall/winter.

I prepared it last night. When I unwrapped the shrimp they smelled funky. So I didn't use them. And it was STILL a yummy dish. The sauce is especially deeelish!

Very meaty. I cut down the calories with turkey sausage and added some potatoes also.

Great Tasting. Use boneless Chicken instead. Even the kids love it.

a wonderful, EASY, hearty cold weather dish. I made it for company and it was a hit. My only complaint is that it can be very greasy. You should skim off the oil before serving. Tastes even better on the second day!

Super one dish meal. I served it over rice and substituted chorizio sausage. My husband, who hates leftovers, asked if there was any left the next day....a sure sign that I'll add it to my personal recipe file.

This has become one of my favorite recipes for entertaining. The flavors of the meats, vegetables, and herbs meld beautifully. It's even better the second day, if you're lucky enough to have left-overs! For ease of eating, I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks and reduce the cooking time accordingly.
