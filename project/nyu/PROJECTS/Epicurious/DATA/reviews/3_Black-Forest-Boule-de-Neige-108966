This is an unusual cake, and definitely for adult taste buds in my opinion (because of the bittersweet and heavy texture). It took about 20 minutes more to cook than the recipe stated. We had to be careful to check it for doneness w/out letting it burn. It came out like bittersweet fudge, with wonderful surprising cherries (I added a little more than stated in the recipe). The adults at our New Year's party loved it, and most of the kids (who are exposed to gourmet flavors regularly) did NOT. It was my first experience working with bittersweet, and I loved it!

This cake is like FUDGE, and it is a show-stopper every time. What's best: it's simple and easy to make.

I used the Bittersweet chocolate, didn't see the option for semi-sweet until just now. Being from the South, my palate is adjusted to the sweeter cakes. With Bittersweet, this cake did not do it for me. Will make this again with Semi-Sweet and give you a more informed review.

No forks were given because I haven't tasted this cake yet. I made it a few days ago for a Christmas party that was canceled due to the recent snow storm. I bought one of the Betty Crocker dome pan kits (designed to make cakes filled with ice cream and such). The dome piece is exactly the right size (10C) for this recipe and the cake comes out in the perfect shape. I used the foil as suggested and nothing looks burnt. I used the tip someone posted here and used a thin layer of whipped cream first, then piped on the stars. I never did find candied violets so I used some gold sugar dust (from King Arthur Flour) and ended up with a beautiful cake. It's in the freezer until I can find another occasion worthy of such a great looking dessert.

I used amaretto instead of the cherry kirsch, since I had some on hand. Everyone loved the cake.

Oh, also, I was in a hurry late at night when picking up the ingredients from the local grocery. Had to use non-clear cherry brandy and semisweet chocolate chips instead of the higher-end stuff - I can imagine it being better if I had, but it's at the limit of my imagination!

Let me tell you EXACTLY how amazing this recipe is. I was exhausted the night I baked the cake, and somehow completely forgot to put any butter in it. Yep, left out *both sticks of butter*. I kind of wondered why it was hard to get the melted chocolate mixture bubbly without burning it (with so little liquid and no grease - duh!) but just went on with the recipe. Taking heed of the high-burn-risk in the oven, I put the bowl in a 9x13 of hot water, lowered the temp 15-20 degrees, and baked about 5 minutes longer than recommended. (Note - also lined the bowl with greased parchment strips b/c was out of foil - it was a pain to set up, but worked really well on the releasing end of things.) Realized the next day I had left the butter out, didn't have time to get a backup for the party, made the whipped cream and served it anyway - to RAVE reviews. So rich that even high-energy college students could only handle a small slice. I'm eating the last leftover piece 6 days later and it's even better than when I put it in the fridge. This is a keeper...and I don't think I'll ever put the butter in.

This cake is amazing, but it is easy to burn the outside. I found that cooking it in a silicone bowl reduces the risk of burning the outside of the cake.

Really bad recipe. A friend made this and it was as heavy as a brick and tasted burned. She almost needed an air drill to cut into it. I made it and baked it for 15 minutes less and the sides were still burned; the middle was perfect - fudgy texture. Couldn't taste the cherries because the chocolate was so overwhelming. Have made much better fudgy, decreased flour cakes and brownies.

There is no denying that this 'cake' is delicious. But I think in order to think it a success you have to know what to expect. This is VERY RICH, just like a gourmet truffle, and dense like one too. I think the cake would be better made in a smaller pan, and cut the ingredients in half. You only need a small slice to be satisfied. On that note, it was far tastier than I expected. The cherries and chocolate were a great mix!

Absolutely decadent! Very rich and very wonderful. I too made it in a bundt pan, worked just fine. However I may may use a different type of icing next time, the color of the cake bled through the icing. Or I may not use icing at all. I will definately make it again!

Oh Myyyyyyy........ this is ALMOST better than Sex!! Rich, decadent and ever so delicious... Thought about having a piece for breakfast but decided to wait 'til after noon, the 2nd day it was even better than the first.

Big hit at the work Christmas party. I added a little more brandy to the topping based on my own taste. It was very rich a perfect for the kind of party where everyone takes a little bit of every one else's dish. The co-workers agreed with me -- a very pleasant cake.

We had this for an elegant Christmas Eve Dinner and it was a HUGE hit with everyone! Ridiculously easy to make and rich in every way! Perfect for Winter feasting.

Rating: 2
Tasty, FUN and relatively easy to make, but really it is just too rich to eat! The amount I could eat at one sitting is probably the equivalent of slicing the cake into 30 pieces, so maybe for a large group who loves coffee and candy-like rich sweet accompaniments it would be a possibility. It is very striking on the platter, though!

The picture of this cake caught my eye in Bon Apetite magazine - and I couldn't resist trying something so unique. I'm glad I didn't, it's fantastic! Dense beyond description and incredibly rich, a little slice goes a long way ensuring everyone will get a taste. This was my first try baking a cake in a bowl - it went well, and the bake time was right on with what the recipe calls for. Between the Kirsch, dried cherries and preserves, I thought the cherry flavor might be overwhelming...but it all mellowed and combined beautifully with the chocolate. Some of the cake did stick to the foil, but because of the density of the cake it left only small pocks that disappeared under the whipped cream. If you're considering making for a special occasion you might want to give it a dry run first (depending on your skill level). My co-workers were appreciative guinea pigs. This is a very special, very impressive cake that will be a wonderful addition to a winter holiday table. I will be making it again and decorating with twigs of holly.

After making this and having a serving I am surprised at the negative reviews. The active time is less than 1/2 hour. Hint: Melt chocolate in a 225 degree oven which is not hot enough to change the chocolate chemically so you don't have to watch it closely, about 20 minutes. Then wisk in the eggs and stir in the incredients pour into the pan and bake. Results are a rich dessert that any chocolate lover should appreciate.

I loved it. Use good quality chocolate and be careful not ton overcook this. It is moist and rich.

I made this recipe as-is for a party & it was a hit. If you make it a day ahead and chill it well the middle sets up just fine. Yes it is dense & fudgy so only small pieces should be served. Extra whipped cream on the side cuts through the chocolate & makes it sooooooo good! Excellent & I would make again.

This cake is very tempremental. I did it in a bunt pan and it still had a hard time cooking through. The whipped cream topping was great but the cake was just too rich and too much of a hastle.

I had to make it twice - the first time I over cooked it and the flavor was good, but, it was very dense and dry. The second time, it was perfect.. (and I don't even like cherries) Not only does it look pretty on a table... it is a crowd pleaser...

I made this cake for Christmas and was very disappointed. By the time the cake tester came out of the center with anything other than very uncooked batter, the outer edges were overcooked and dry. If I were to try this again I would use a bundt pan like the first reviewer.

Yes. It is chocolately. That seems obvious from the recipe. I thought it was moist and delicious and that the kirsch cream really cut the richness in a delightful way. It was easy to make and everyone loved it.

I made this cake for my father's birthday - he's always loved the traditional black forest cake - and it was a tremendous hit. It was really moist and delicious - the combination of the cherries and chocolate was great. I would definitely make it again.

The recipe was perfect - - came out looking just like the picture. But after a large holiday meal, it was just too rich to be enjoyed. It just sat there, largely untouched. As one guest put it, "It's like a GIANT chocolate cherry truffle." Definitely fun to make once, but not a keeper.

I don't know what the other reviewers were expecting from a recipe with a pound of chocolate and a 1/3 cup flour, but I got exactly what I wanted: a dense, rich, fudgy, delicious chocolate torte. I made a ahlf recipe in a 5-cup bowl, and it was beautiful, made many servings (over 8), and kept exceptionally well, still moist days later. It shouldn't matter how long it takes to cool, as you are supposed to let it sit out in the pan overnight - if you don't the cake will not fully set up.

I also made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone liked it a lot, concurring with my daughter's rating: "9 out of 10." It was spectacularly beautiful. I didn't get candied violets, but served on a copper platter with a little holly around it. But...it was a close second to the lemon cheesecake with pistachio praline I often make for special occasions. The cake was awfully dense. But I thought the cherries and whipped cream were a good foil for the pound of dark chocolate. I baked according to the time in recipe and used a large metal bowl, probably larger than called for--perhaps that helped? I decided on this recipe after having read just the first review, so I'm surprised that so many others were so disappointed with it. I'd say it was a hit, well worth making once, though I doubt I'll repeat it.

I made this for Christmas dessert and thought it would be a hit. No one liked it! I didn't like the cherries in it. Way too much chocolate for a cake this size. It took much longer bake than the recipe called for. I should have made the Eggnog Trifle instead.

I made this as Christmas dessert and it came out horrible. The cake definitely needed to be cooked longer than specified because the center was really gooey (even though when tested the cake tester came out as described in recipe). Hope others have better luck than I did.

This cake was very rich and chocolatey, and very, very dense. It took over an hour longer to cook then specified. The cake took over 6 hours to cool. Overall it was delicious, I would defintley make it again for a chocolate loving croud.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic. I made it in a bundt pan instead of bowl and was a little worried when I went to cut it because I was incredibly dense. I really had to push to get the knife through, but nevertheless it was very moist and the cherries (though I don't usually like dried fruit in cakes) were a perfect addition. It's easier to pipe stars if you first put a thin layer of whipped cream over the cake. My mom (who rarely eats sweets) even had a piece for breakfast!
