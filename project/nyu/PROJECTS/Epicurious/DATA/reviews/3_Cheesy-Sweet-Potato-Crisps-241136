Really good-super easy and a great way to use up sweet potatoes if your CSA happens to dump a ton on you and your family.

Eh. Way too cheesy, not enough potato flavor, and didn't get crispy. If you try this, I'd say go thinner than the recipe recommends. If there's a next time I'll go 50/50 on parmesean and flour as well.

Really not bad. I didn't find this as taxing as some reviews, but I would definitely suggest finely grating the sweet potatoes. Mine came out looking a bit like snickerdoodle stacks. They weren't terribly hard to make, and the flavor was nice though I would have preferred a fluffier texture (thus my suggestion about grating). I followed the recipe exactly, and without a good parmesan cheese or with substitutions I could see where this could go terribly wrong.

Tried using tin foil... not a great idea! Use parchment/silicone for sure. Tasty appetizer.

We loved these! I used fresh rosemary and good cheese as well - key. I also added one yolk from the eggs since I was making these for a family with kids and was not concerned about fat or cholesterol. You could also pan fry them. I had no trouble getting them off the paper. Allow extra time, though, because grating sweet potatoes by hand does take a while.

I've made these twice and have really enjoyed them both times. I think the FRESH rosemary is key as well as good cheese. I like them fresh out of the oven with the balsamic cream sauce and cooled by themselves.

Very different! The fresh herbs make a difference. Formed into fingerlings and we used roasted garlic dip, great combination for an appetizer.

These came out terribel. They had no taste and stuck to the paper. I didn't even bother putting the second batch in the oven. What a waste of food. The rosemary cream was no winner either.

I tried these and I am not sorry I did but I am not sure if I will make them again. The flavor was good but nothing exceptional. I used dried rosemary because I couldn't find any fresh, and even though I halved the recipe, it needed two egg whites to have any sticking power. For the cook that had trouble with the crisps sticking to the paper, I let mine cool a bit before trying to remove them, it worked much better. NOTE: if you don't want to lose your marbles completely, use a machine to grate the sweet potatoes. Accompaning sauce was good, I have a lot leftover, will try it on some chicken or beef.

This might not have been such a stinging disaster if the prep handn't taken so much time. What a horrid mess- goopey, tasteless, and I had to practically burn them to get them to stick together. Do not make this recipe- save your time, sweet potatoes, and sanity.

Somewhere between bland and disaster. What a waste of a sweet potato. I wish I'd just baked it.

These were bland and also looked nothing like the picture.

What a disaster. I never follow recipes and the one time I do everything goes wrong. These burned on the bottom way before they were cooked, stuck to the parchment paper like none other, and looked nothing like the picture. Terrible experience and I'll just stick to winging it and whipping things together because this recipe was awful.

I made these as appetizers for a dinner party and they were great - super easy. I actually liked the fact that they weren't fried. I used 2 whole eggs instead of the eggs whites to give these a little more staying power - one egg alone didnt seem much of an adhesvie. The accompanying sauce is wonderful. I will definitley make these again, they were a hit.

obviously written by a Gentile but c'mon folks, the Gentiles have been eating potato pancakes for years. Latkes do not have the corner on the market. These are tasty, a healthy tasty but not quite as good as the ones fried in the oil but then again, nothing ever is! Try them, you'll like them.

Wouldn't potato panckes with cheese be non-kosher?? (You could not serve with meat)

why would this recipe in you Chanukah selection? The reason potato pancakes are served is to remember the miracle of oil you eat foods that are fried in oil. This recipe has no oil!
