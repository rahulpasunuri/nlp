A delicious cake. The batter is tasty and tender and the plums work like a charm - the plums I had were very sour but after being baked on top of the cake they turned out great. I used a 20cm (8in) round cake pan with a removable bottom and lined the base of the pan with a circle of baking paper. It worked really well.

Simple and tasty way to profile the best of the harvest. Made with fresh Ontario blue plums and served with locally made "creme fraiche" icecream.

This cake is the perfect way to use and enjoy summer stone fruits. I used a combination of plums, pluots, and peaches from my CSA. It was simple to make and looked stunning. The taste was a nice balance of sweet and tart. I'm already planning to make it again!

OK, but not something I would make again. Cake was dense and dry -- saved by the plums. I made the recipe as written.

Very easy and quick to make (first timer). Was surprised at how little batter there was in the pan initially, but it rose nicely once baked, to envelope the plums. Would cardamon sugar sprinkled on top do nicely too?

Wonderful cake, simple and delicious! Only thing I would recommend is to use a light colored springform pan. I used the dark non-stick variety and the edge and bottom were a bit too dark. Otherwise perfect recipe.

I made this recipe with pears, and it was yummy--a good standby for breakfast or tea.

I made this recipe with pluots (cross between a plum and apricot - new fruit I had never had before!) for a New Year's Day brunch. It was super simple and looked elegant with a dusting of confectionery sugar. Fit in perfectly with savory dishes because it is not too sweet. Even my nine year old niece gobbled it up. Only change I would make next time is to combine turbinado sugar with the cinnamon to give it a little crunch.

Very good but mine only needed about 35-40 minutes. 50 minutes was WAY too long....

I made it with cherries and it was delicious. I actually forgot to add the cinnamon sugar on top of the cherries (I just sprinkled a bit on top after it came out of the oven); however, I think my mistake worked out for the best as it was not overly sweet.

I used to always make a plum cake from the old Joy of Cooking book which was delicious. I now have the new version, and it's missing that recipe. I tried this one and it's good - but mostly because the plums are just delicious cooked with cinnamon and sugar. The cake itself I found to be way too dry and the balance between cake and topping was off. I will definitely continue making this cake, but will be looking for a more moist cake component.

I made this according this according to the instructions, with high altitude modification and served it with fresh whipped cream. It was simple, attractive and was well received. I will certainly make it again.

When I read the recipe I thought it looked a little plain. The reviews were all good so I gave it a try. It was okay but nothing spectacular. The plums make it the cake is just plain white cake. It certainly turned out okay and was easy but I will not make it again. To me the cake needs more substance.

I've made this quite a few times with several types of fruit. As it has evolved for me, I've taken to topping the cake with the sliced plums, dispensing with the cinnamon-sugar and adding 1 or 2 chopped plums to the batter. The plums on top almost have a jam-like consistency and it looks almost pretty enough to display permanently, if, of course I could stop eating it. This variation came out of buying some very ripe Satsuma plums that were very terribly difficult to pit, so in case anyone runs into that issue this small variant may be worth a go.

A great recipe--made it using pears I picked from my front yard. (If you use pears in this recipe, just made sure you use a firm type so they don't turn to mush in the oven.) A delicious dessert, and it would make a great breakfast cake because it's not too sweet.

This is really easy to make and looks so pretty. It comes out really moist and flavorful. I have tried it with plums and nectarines and both are good. I like to add a couple of pinches of cardomon to the cake batter. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

A wonderful quick and light dessert. I usually double the recipe and make two different cakes, using plums, apples, or pears. After the cakes has cooled I then give the cakes a light dusting of icing sugar. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Brought this to a dinner party and everyone "Ooohed and aaahed", one friend said it was "food-magazine pretty"--tasted great too and easy to make. Can't wait to try it with other fruits (but the plums are so pretty).

This cake is delicious as a desert or enjoyed the next morning with coffee. Everyone who tired it absolutely loved it. I will definitely make this again and again!

This is a great cake! The sweetness of cake and the tangy plum flavor make good balance. In stead of lemon zest and lemon juice, I added orange juice, orange zest, and orange liquer and made it wonderful.

YUM! I've made this twice already and I love it! I made it with apples once and they were so good baked into the top. The second time, I made it with plums and served it with fruit in a wine syrup - the syrup soaked into the cake and it was heaven. (Recipe for that is "fruit in ginger wine syrup", I think.) MAKE THIS CAKE!

A very delicious and easy dessert. Served it after dinner, but would be excellent for breakfast as well. Can be made up to 2 days ahead, and stored covered at room temperature. Everyone loved it! Enjoy!
