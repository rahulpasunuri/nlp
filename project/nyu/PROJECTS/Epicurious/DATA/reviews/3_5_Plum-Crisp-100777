Excellent crisp topping! You can save yourself a step and skip pre-cooking the plums. Just let them sit with the sugar and cornstarch while you prep the crisp top and the sugars will start to release from the fruit all on its own.

I may have used especially ripe plums, because this turned out rather juicy. The flavor was nice though.

This is excellent with an added teaspoon of grated lemon rind in the plum mixture.

This is also nice with walnuts instead of almonds. A mixture of plums works as well.

The topping is excelent even without the almonds (didn't have any)

I love plums and this was an excellent crisp. Next time I would reduce the sugar with th plums as I love the tartness. Great topping for any fruit crisp.

I forgot to say that I omitted the almonds when I made it and cut my Italian Prunes into quarters instead of halves. We sure didn't miss the nuts in this, though I am sure they would be good in it, and I will definitely cut the prunes the same way next time. I think halves would seem a bit large for a bite (quarters are easier to manage w/ utensils and a little more "mannerly", if you will). Enjoy!

This crisp is great! My husband, who told me while I was making it that if it was made of plums he would not be partaking, tried it (upon compulsion) and ended up saying that he will gladly eat more- LOTS more! He said it reminded him of peach crisp, it reminds me of cherry crisp. I will definitely be making this again- next time for company. YUM!

One must really enjoy the rich and unique flavor the plum has to offer before getting a second helping. The Italian prune plum taste was really overwhelming. I'll stick to berries.

I have a red plum tree and used those. I didn't cook the filling, but rather just omitted the water, quartered the plums and stirred them into the sugar + cornstarch mix. I followed the directions for the topping and oven baking time. I agree that the slight tartness makes this a yummy crisp. My family enjoyed it with whipped cream or ice-cream.

I doubled this recipe and took it to a July 4th pot-luck where it was the most popular dish at the party. Everyone raved about the taste, in particular the tart taste of the plums. Most cobblers and crisps are so sweet that you can't discern the fruit flavors. This recipe is NOT too sweet and is really good with the ice cream topping!! I will definitely make this again for a party, but not for just my husband and myself as we would eat the whole thing in one sitting!!

This is a delicious recipe, the best way I know of to enjoy luscious, Italian prune plums. My family has made this for the past three summers and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe! An easy, simple and wholesome dessert!

Can't do nuts,so I omitted the almonds. This crisp is crisp but lush, and it's fascinating to see the different colors of the plums during creation!
