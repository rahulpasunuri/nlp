The second time I made this, I doubled the amount of oysters, which made a really good winter soup. I agree with another reviewer than half-and-half is probably too rich, and would substitute at least some whole milk.

Although I am not a fan of cream soups, I decided to try this recipe, using a combination of 1 cup milk, 1 cup chicken stock, and 1/2 cup water. This was in addition to the oyster liquor. I know the use of chicken stock in other than chicken soups is probably sacreligious in the gourmet world, but I like the tanginess that chicken stock adds to beef and seafood dishes. I read the previous review and used 3/4 cup shallots for more flavor. Worked great. It was a delicious soup that only needed some crusty bread as accompaniment.

This needs a lot of "tweaking." Next time I'll use whole milk, the half & half was too rich, and make a light roux to thicken. It seems to need more onion flavor, I may try shallots or even a Vidalia.
