This was good, but I added cheddar cheese on top to make it even better.

This recipe is missing a few key ingredients. Add 1 Cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and 4 chopped green onions. Other delicious veggies are chopped and seeded tomatos and cauliflower. The

I tried refrigerated crescent dough for pizza once. Take my advice. Don't do it. Use ready made or make your own. The mayo and salad dressing, in my humble opinion belong in sandwiches or salads. Not for pizza. Skip this one.

The refridgerated canned crescent dough doesn't cut it in a pizza. The toppings are good, minus the mayo. Doesn't need it. Try using real pizza dough, it's much better.

This is a really great dish to make for parties, etc. What I do, though, is instead of dressing, mayo, and cream cheese, I use just cream cheese, but I add dill weed, garlic, even minced, dried onions if I have them. You can do whatever you like to this dish and it'll still taste pretty good, even with lowfat cream cheese. The only reason I didn't give it four forks is because it's probably not appropriate for a formal dinner or party.

I add extra veggies, based on what I have on hand. Looks great and easy to make. Great for a "pot-luck".

YUK! Tasted like an elementary school cooking experiment.

I add quite a bit more to the toppings. I use grated radish, black and green olives, sometimes scallions and califlower. I do not use celery. I end with grated cheddar cheese. It always gets rave reviews!!!

This is a great recipe. I also added sliced black olives and few chopped sweet onions.

This is great! Another variation in preparing the pizza crust. Is to slice the rolled dough (leave it the way it is when it comes out of the tube) into circles and arrange them in the pan so they can be easily pulled apart. You can get about 11-13 circles out of an 8 oz. tube!
