I got to break out my new steamer for the first time, which was fun, and I made this recipe. I thought it was pretty delicious, though my roommate said it was too vinegar-y for her tastes. I used stone ground mustard instead of dijon, because that's all I had, and it worked out fine.

This made a lot of dressing! I omitted the mushrooms (didn't have any in the fridge). Served at a BBQ buffet, nobody went back for seconds & had a lot leftover. I would not bother with this recipe again. The dressing didn't pair well with the zucchini, overpowered the dish.

Did not steam the zucchini or squash and it was crisp and delicious with the dressing. Makes it very easy to prepare last minute and holds up very well that way. Definitely will make again!

I wasn't crazy about the dressing, or the looks of this salad. I think the mushrooms were distracting, and the dressing was too mustardy.

Hey Virginia - maybe YOU don't like veggies but they are our faves! This is a keeper. Wonderful for a picnic.

If I had to make a veggie type salad dish I MIGHT make this again. It was okay. I did like how I could make this the night before a cookout and I think that was really the best thing about this dish. However, veggies are really never anyone's favorite and I think that taking the veggie factor into account along with the recipe--- it was just okay.

Great dressing for salad. I actually have never used it on the vegetables, but by itself, it can go on just about any type of salad, or stand alone as a dip.

We loved this recipe and it was even tastier the next day. We grilled some chicken breasts and the two together are a fantastic summer dinner.

This is a great summer salad and so easy! I added chopped green onion and garlic salt and used grape tomatoes instead of reular cherry and it was great. Next time I may add some Feta. I did double the recipe which was so easy but I think if you double it you don't need double the dressing. Also, I reduced the steam time to 3-4 minutes. I made this ahead for a beach weekend and the salad traveled well on ice in a ziplock bag. I will definitely make it again and have already shared the recipe!

I have tryed to get my family to eat more squash since we live in the south and it is a long growing season. They not only enjoyed it they asked me to make it again!
