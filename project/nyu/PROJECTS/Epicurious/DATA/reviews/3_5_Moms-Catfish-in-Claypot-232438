Sweet and no other flavor. I normally love this dish in restaurants, but this did not replicate the taste.

I had to throw it away. I cook a lot and normally well reviewed recipes on epicurious never fail. I love clay pot dishes in restaurants and was so excited when i found this recipe. However, this was so bland, slightly sweet, and no other taste.

Really delicious and low fat to boot. Husband isn't a big fish fan, but he loved this. Had seconds and then split the last piece with me (I was feeling generous). I don't understand the woman from Georgia who didn't know how much fish sauce to use. It's right there in the recipe.

Made this dish twice in one week after finding this recipe and everyone loved it. Didn't have caramel sauce in cupboard so melted sugar the first time and used maple syrup the next. Flavors were delicious both times so might experiment with honey next chance - though would love to pick up caramel sauce to try when grocery shop again.

I managed to get the caramel sauce just right with the help of some photos online. You do have to wait for the crystals to remelt. I used the method of plunging the pot into cold water. I made the mistake, though, of using frozen snapper since that's what Trader Joe's had--and it was disappointingly fishy, though pretty in the caramel sauce. I'm thinking that this has to be done with fresh fish or it just isn't worth the time and effort. Anyone have a good recipe for the caramel sauce with tofu or chicken?

Exceptional. This will totally make you feel like an amazing chef. I used fresh catfish cross-sections with skin on instead of filet, but othewise I followed this recipe to the T and the result is better than the catfish claypot at the Slanted Door. Seriously. Unless you've made caramel sauce (vietnamese) before, watch the epicurious video on this website first. Good luck and have fun! This recipe is indeed amazing.

Just made this dish and it was definitely a hit with my family. I did add both red pepper flakes and some green chile, which tempered the sweetness of the caramel sauce. Already on the list for my next dinner party -- so easy!

The idea of this reminded me of a favorite dish in a restuarant that went out of business. I just had to make it, but only had Tilapia in the house. I had everything else, but used a covered fry skillet and followed the directions exactly and it was great. My kids loved it and I agree that seasoning the fish first was a good idea. If I see catfish around, I'll try that but I thought the Talapia worked very well

Absolutely fantastic and so so very easy. The toughest part is making the caramel sauce. Two tips... after the water boils out of the sugar syrup, keep stirring, the sugar quickly melts and the caramel begins to make. At the end, make sure you add enough water to the caramel while it is still very very hot so that it stays in a sauce form.. and does not make rock candy!.

I can't tell how much fish sauce is called for.

This is a good dish with a great contrast of flavors. I would note though that the catfish should probably be seasoned before you cook it - salt and pepper is fine - and also, be careful of the caramel sauce - it reduces nicely, but can get quite hot as the stock cooks out of it.
