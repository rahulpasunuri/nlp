This is the best prime rib ever. For the sauce, I buy a demi glace packet at my grocer (New Seasons) and make the 1/2 cup or so that it makes--that works just fine. Can't believe that people have a hard time finding dried mushrooms...Make sure you start the sauce when the roast goes in so it has plenty of time to reduce.

We were extremely disappointed with this recipe last year when we tried it. The Porcini mushroom was expensive and tricky to find - and it was not detectable on the roast at all. The sauce was underwhelming and the overall meat was bland and tastless. Sorry. I usually love the recipes I get from Epicurious, but saddly, this is one that was a bust. I'm trying a new sauce recipe for this year....

The sauce was very good and had a complex flavor, but it did not blow me away like I thought it would based on previous reviews. Everyone enjoyed it and it paired very well with beef. I would make it again, but would not consider it my go to sauce.

Not sure if I did something wrong here and I have to say I do know how to cook. The sauce is just so so, there are definitely others that are much tastier, like the shallot/wine sauce with the blue cheese crusted filets.

I am getting ready to make the sauce in advance for Easter Sunday and have just purchased Williams and Sonoma Veal Demi-Glace but am a bit miffed about the measurements. The recipe calls for 2/3 cup, but that seems like an awful lot of this concentrated product. And there are no instructions/ratios on reconstituting it. Help!

Without a doubt the best prime rib recipe I have ever tried. We always have prime rib for Christmas but I have bounced around from recipe to recipe because, while it always tastes very good, how can you really go wrong with such a piece of meat, it never was special. This was very special and fairly easy which is nice when you have a house full of guests. I made the full amount of sauce even though my roast was only 6 lbs and needed every drop. My store was sold out of veal demi-glace so I instead reduced 2 cups of beef stock down to 2/3 cup which worked just fine.

A few notes... The roast is extremely easy to prepare. It takes less than 10 minutes. We went to 4 stores before finding the dried mushrooms though. Also, the Demi Glace is very expensive and hard to find. We found that William Sonoma carried it for 29$ per 10 oz. I ended up following recipe but using Knorr beef bouillon cubes instead. Everyone went crazy and loved the sauce. But it was missing that key ingredient. Good luck, this is a winner for sure!

I have prepared this recipe numerous times and it never fails to be divine! It is simply exquisite and leaves the palette knowing it has had something special.

Roast received rave reviews by my guests but I personally thought it was just OK. Could have cooked it more med rare for my taste. Used the McCormick's steak seasoning as suggested. I think next time I will rub with olive oil before I season.

I prepared this dish for my girlfriend's birthday...I cooked a 5lb.boneless ribeye roast that turned out just meltingly tender.. generously sprinkled the twined roast with Montreal's steak seasoning and pulled the roast from the oven at 120 degrees and left covered for 30 mins..cooking time after the 20 mins at 450 was about 1 1/2 hrs...I used packaged demi glace from the sauce aisle of the supermarket and that was surprisingly flavorful...for accompaniments I served up deliciously sweetened oven-roasted carrots and yukon gold mashed potatoes stirred with half-and-half and butter...definitely a keeper recipe.

Great recipe - my first prime rib roast and I was nervous, but according to my dinner guests, I nailed it! Whew. I cut the kosher salt amount in the dry rub in half and added some Montreal Seasoning. Served with a Turley Zin and Donati Family Vineyard Merlot.

Very happy with results. Would def make recipe again. Sauce stands on its own and I would use it with other cuts of meat. I added cremini mushrooms (sauteed first) to the sauce as one of my guests really likes mushrooms. I also used the Montreal Steak Spice on the roast rather than the porcini mushrooms mixture. I omitted the salt in the recipe because the spice on the roast is salty.

We just finished Christmas Dinner. Only used the timing on this recipe because the last two attempts at Prime Rib were woefully overcooked. Did the 20 mins @ 450; then dropped temp to 350 & checked temp after 30 mins; then every 15 mins thereafter. Pulled it @ 110 & let it sit 20 mins. AWESOME!!!!!!! Finally. Just don't overcook. It's easy to cook more, impossible to "uncook." Oh, add drippings to whatever au jus you're brewing. Merry Christmas, Everyone!!

As for the reviewer who complained about taking the meat off at 125 and had guests waiting in line for the microwave: Next year simply make pot roast in the slow cooker, they will be completely satisfied. And forego the demi glace as any gravy will do. DW

I served this at a dinner party & everyone just LOVED it! The only changes I made was for the Prime Rib. I rubbed it with chopped garlic & coated it with McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning before roasting. Absolutely tasted Gorgeous!

Made this side sauce for prime-rib for Christmas Day. It was amazin! Got rave reviews, we're still talking about it! Will definitely make again!

Excellent sauce. I made Horseradish Garlic Prime Rib (Tyler Florence), and served it with this sauce. There were no pan juices and I forgot to add the additional butter to the sauce and it was excellent! I used veal stock for the demi glace but I reduced 2 cups to the 2/3 cup called for in this recipe. Making it ahead is a real bonus.

As others have noted, this receipe is all about the sauce -- the porcini dusting on the meat probably does very little. As for the sauce, it is really great. Very rich. I'm not sure about the measurements on the wine (750mL = 3 cups; how do you get 2 cups + 1.75 cups from a 750mL bottle?). I also was unable to find veal demiglace and suffered (ha!) with mere beef demiglace, which you can find in the packaged sauce section of your supermarket (near hollendaise sauce, gravy mixes, etc.) It isn't particularly difficult to make and it's definitely worth it. Yum!

Made this for Christmas dinner last year as stated. Contrary to many reviewers, I actually found this recipe easy compared to many other Christmas meals I've made -- which is why I'm making it again this year. Just use good wine (I used the same Bordeaux I served with the meal) and always salt only to taste. Everyone thought it was amazing. Don't be put off and just try it!

Made this recipe twice exactly as written except for the added salt. My guests rave about the sauce. I am making it again this year for our Christmas party. Just a note: the quality of the wine does matter!

I made this despite some of the reviews about the sauce not being worth the trouble. I actually really liked the sauce - it is a lot of work, but it results in many different layers of flavor.

This is a terrific special occasion recipe. The sauce is phenomenal. The meal is great for entertaining because you can and should prepare the sauce in advance. The recipe is good as is and does not need much tinkering. I have made three times and will make again and again.

The roast was just fine, but I had lots of trouble with the sauce. After doing it to-the-letter, the sauce never thickened and was too acid-tasting. I've had wine sauces that were a lot smoother.

As tradition has it in our home, we serve prime rib for Christmas. This was a particularly great recipe as the sauce is incredible! The veal demiglace was a challenge to locate but end in the end, after many phone calls and much frustration, I located it at a small market here in St. Louis that seems to cater to the more upscale zip codes in our area. I will also agree with other reviewers that additonal salt is not needed in the sauce as the demiglace has plenty to offer. I was very thankful that I had lots of pan drippings as my sauce was on the very salty side prior to adding the drippings. In any case, I served this along with the epicurious.com's recipes for Mascarpone Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cararmelized Leaks and Haricot Vert with Caramelized Shallots. What a wonderful meal -- will definitely be making this again next year!

I cooked the roast exactly as specified, having it come to room temp and using a digital thermometer, and the internal temperature did not rise to 130 after removing from the oven at 115. The final temp was more like 120. The result? My guests were standing at the microwave cooking their plates of raw prime rib! Not so nice. My advice is to cook to 125, unless you like it still mooing, that is. Guests raved about the complex sauce, though!

Christmas dinner for 12 - fabulous. Made exactly as written EXCEPT cooked the rib on the outdoor rotisserie to internal temp of 110. The sauce had a deep, rich, elegant flavor. My veal demi-glace was purchased from william sonoma. I have already given the recipe to dinner guests and will make it again myself.

Excellent! I did not have enough porcini mushrooms, so I didn't grind them and put them on the roast edge. But, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Oh...I took the peel and the root off the onion. I thought that was weird, as the root and peel are not really clean. But, just take it off, no big deal. I used dried thyme--just a pinch.

Great dish. However, there is no need to add salt. The demiglace adds enough saltiness. More Than Gourmet produces demiglace that can be purchased on-line. Lately we have been using Arom Max brand veal demiglace available on the shelves at Wholefoods. Next time I go to Wholefoods, I will see if the local shop has the demiglace, mentioned earlier, in the frozen section.

Wow! I prepared only the red-wine sauce for a leg of lamb roast. What fantastic flavors, definitely worth the effort and 3 & 1/2 forks.

i made this recipe with a WONDERFUL veal demi glace that i found recently at Whole Foods Bellingham. I found it in the freezer...the name is "Stock Options" and they also make veal, chicken, beef and vegie stocks & beef demi glace. All natural too! I have used both demi glace and couldn't be happier. It's nice to use a shortcut that I don't have to feel guilty about!

Joel, try central market over in mill creek. (Probably give them a call first) but i am fairly certain you can purchase the demi glace from them. Otherwise there is always whole foods or Williams Sonoma. . i think there is even a williams sonoma at Alderwood mall, but i haven't been there is ages. Hope that helps!

For all the work and all the ingedients that went into this, the results were not all that spectacular. For my taste it was a tad salty and the overall flavor reminded me of an Oxo cube! There are way better gravies and sauces on Epicurious.
