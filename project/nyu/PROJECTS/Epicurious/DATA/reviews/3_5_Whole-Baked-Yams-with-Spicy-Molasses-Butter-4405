Where has this recipe BEEN all my life? :-) I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It's straight forward, very flavorful, and I am eager to make it again soon.

Made this as a side during Passover and it came out very well. I used blackstrap molasses and, while the color was offputting, the flavor was rich and good. http://noshesthoughtsreves.blogspot.com/2011/04/easy-passover-recipe-whole-baked-yams.html

Loved this recipe! It received RAVE reviews at Thanksgiving this year and it is super easy. Next time I will decrease the molasses by half - a little too strong as is. I am not a fan of "sweet" sweet potatoes so I really enjoyed the kick from the chili powder (did not add the cayenne pepper).

Very easy, and very good. One of my guests exclaimed that he thought he was eating pumpkin pie. Loved it.

I make this recipe every year for Thankgiving. The molasses butter is superb and can be made ahead. I also bake the whole yams wrapped in foil on the grill to save oven space.

I made this side dish for thanksgiving this year and it was a wonderful accompaniment. Instead of baking the yams whole, I sliced them about a 1/4 of an inch thick and slathered them with the molasses butter before putting in the oven to bake. Needless to say it was a wonderful spicy take on the usual candied sweet potatoes schtick.

My favorite new thing to put on sweet potatoes! I didn't have oranges so left out the orange peel, and used dark molasses and reduced the amount. I also doubled the recipe. Makes plain baked sweet potatoes something special! My guests raved, and my husband did too, which doesn't happen often. A definite repeat performer in my house!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving, and I thought it was very good. I also cut up the yams and put the butter on top. Next time I make it, I think I'll increase the amounts of the spices.

This is a fantastic and slightly offbeat way to have sweet potatoes. The spice and sweet mixture is one I'm very fond of (try the Chili-Macadamia Nut Brittle, also on Epicurious!) and this is a terrific example of that. I've made this several times, and it was delicious and compatible every time -- with salmon, with chicken, with seafood. Don't skip this one!

I'm not crazy about yams, but this recipe was terrific and so easy. Everyone loved it! I used dark molasses and cut the yams up before baking. The smaller portions worked better for us.

My daughter made this yam dish for Thanksgiving. It's different, but very very delicious. I will be making it often especially during the winter months.

I've made this dish just because I was bored with the same old traditonal yam dish. It's extremely easy and fast, but I didn't think that it was all that flavorful.

This is a great substitute for the standard thanksgiving sweet potato casserole with all the sugary gunk. The flavors of the spices are a superb mix. The amount of cayenne does not make it a spicy dish so everyone should be able to enjoy it. Presentation looks great if you scoop the butter on top of each potato with a melon ball scooper. It was such a great hit that I will probably make it every thanksiving!
