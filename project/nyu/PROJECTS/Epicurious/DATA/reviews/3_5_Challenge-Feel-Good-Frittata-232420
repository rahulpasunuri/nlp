This recipe is, in my opinion, just OK. I know it's a light recipe and perhaps that's the standard upon which it should be judged. Butter in the pan and the use of the whole egg would definitely improve the flavor. Not bad... but not crave-worthy. I'd only make it again with full fat modifications.

Yummy and easy. Great for a family "breakfast dinner" night!

Delicious! I didn't have any spinach so I just used sauteed onions. Just make sure you don't burn the egss while the "set" for the first portion of the recipe. Also, I think the calories for the recipe include the bread and orange that they sugggest.

Is it just me or does the nutritional information not make any sense? Where are the carbohydrates and calories coming from?
