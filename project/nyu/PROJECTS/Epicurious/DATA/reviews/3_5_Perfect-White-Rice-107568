this is the first time in my life I have ever cooked rice and liked it! I used long grain jasmine.Did not rinse the rice and I used butter not oil. It was perfect!

Great recipe, same way I've always cooked it, except I recommend NOT rinsing it with water before cooking, as that makes the rice very sticky when cooked. Great for when making sushi, horrible when cooking in a traditional Hispanic way.

I have been trying to find the perfect way to make rice for my Dominican boyfriend. My rice just can't match up to his mom's, grandmother's, sister's (even!)--you get the idea. I agree with those who said that this rice was too sticky. It didn't make the grade with him. I thought it was good, but I don't mind my rice a bit on the sticky side. Next time, I will use a little less water.

We make perfect rice everyday here in Brazil and I would suggest some slight changes. Add a little garlic to the recipe, and sauté all the ingredients for a couple of minutes before stirring in the water (preferably hot). Now that's perfect!

Use Jasmine Rice and cook it in a steamer this is the best way I ever fixed rice it has less starch and carbs.

This is a great rice recipe. I use a hint of garlic and place a green onion on top of the water as it boils to give it a boost--or I add white kernels from a corn cob in with it to give it that "colombian" touch.

Where, in America, can I find REAL, long-grain, white rice? Could someone, please, give me a brand name? Tried Uncle Ben's & it's dreadful stuff as the grains are SO TINY! Tx very much.

This made pretty good rice, but I wouldn't call it perfect. It was a bit sticky, as the other reviewer said.

This recipe makes perfect and delicious rice. However, if you cut the recipe in half, I recommend that you reduce the salt by more than half. I use 3/4 tsp. as I find that when cutting the recipe in half, that 1 tsp. is too much.

This recipe yielded for me a somewhat flaky but definitely soggy clump of rice. While not truly sticky (the way Asian rice is), it was certainly a bit more moist than I'm accustomed to Latin rice tasting. Also, the bottom layer of rice burned, but I've never found a recipe that didn't do this.

This really is perfect...I've been searching for a way to make basic rice without undercooking it or burning the pan and I adore how easy this was.

As a Miami hispanic by osmosis (and marriage) this is the way I was taught to make white rice by my Puerto Rican mother-in-law, and it's a no-fail recipe that everyone loves. It's so basic that it'a actually not a recipe at all!
