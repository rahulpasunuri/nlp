This recipe is so easy and delicious, and as a bonus the presentation looks fancy so it's a great addition to a dinner party. It is also nice with feta instead of chevre.

What a disappointment...I'd been wanting to try this for a while and finally did. A waste of good goat cheese! I like delicate flavors, but this was bland, dry and pretty uninteresting. I'm sure there is a way to fix it up, but I'm not one to keep trying to make a silk purse from a sow's ear when there are so many other good recipes.
