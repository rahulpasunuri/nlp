With RAW corn, cut fresh off the cob, red onion instead of green, and some adjustments to the dressing, this is not only an explosion of colors, but the most unbelievably delicious recipe I've tried. I'm a vegetarian, and love to eat raw as much as possible - this will become my new staple...

There's a mexican salad with honey dressing in this website that is similar but far better. Try it.

I love this. Moderately healthy, fast, and delcious. I have made it twice already. Used thawed frozen corn and typically I add a bti more cilantro and cumin than called for. Loved by all who have tried it.

i have made this dish several times several different ways and the key really IS good, freshly shucked white sweet corn. it is an unbelievable difference! you can, not only in the taste, but in the cruch and texture, as well. like one reviewer suggested, thawing instead of cooking frozen corn will create a better result.

Yummy! Got rave reviews from a picky eater.

I used canned sweet corn - save time and effort. I added one finely chopped Jalapeno just to add some jazz to it. Found that the salad didn't need as much oil as the recipe called for (I used only 1 TBS and it was plenty). To pick up on the lime flavour, add 1/2 TSP of grated lime zest. Let the salad marinade overnight so the flavours can develop better. BTW, I skipped the lettuce presentation and just served it as a side dish.

I made this dish last night for a lobster boil for 30 people, and it turned out very well. The key is that it is extremely easy, very pretty presentation, and got mutliple positive comments from the crowd. I multiplied everything by 6 with no problems (but make sure you have a big enough bowl!) In order to improve crispness, next time I will not cook the corn, but rather just thaw it under running warm water. I also may reduce the oil to taste or eliminate all together.

Simple, tasty and can be prepared in advance. Canned corn works just as well - maintain crispness, do not overcook. I use 1 whole red pepper and skip the green pepper. I also skip the lettuce and serve as a side dish. Excellent side dish for the Grilled Spiced Double-Thick Pork Chops (a must try recipe - Gourmet, Sept98).
