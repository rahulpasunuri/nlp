Easy and delicous. Always a crowd pleaser and u can make so much of it ahead of time and assemble at the last minute. Make extra toppings ---Great on grilled chicken the next day too. I've been making this for over 10 years.

Great pizza recipe. I used a large whole wheat tortilla for the crust. Very easy and quick. I sprinkled a thin layer of mozzarell on the crust after the olivada and before the other ingredients.

Besides being quick and easy (thank you pre-prepared pizza crusts and manageable ingredients), this pizza was really tasty! I used a generic kalamata olive tapenade and kept close to the recipe. Made for an impressive dinner party pizza, and the leftovers were great as a sandwich!

My husband and I had a "pizza party" with friends recently. We gave each person a small crust (bought at an Italian deli) and we laid out different prep stations with the ingredients for several kinds pizzas (including instructions) for each to make their own. This was one of the options available and it received great reviews! This was not a difficult recipe at all. I wasn't able to find the olivada, but making the paste was not difficult at all. Generally, this was an easy dish to make. This pizza was unexpectedly sweet and very good. I will definitely make this again.

This is quick, delicious, easy, and impressive in appearance and taste. I have always used it as an appatizer - never (yet) as an entre. It is great before just about any grilled dish. I oftem prepare most of the ingredients the night before and then bring the ingredients to room temp. and assemble.

This is wonderful! Sophisticated without being difficult... and very, very tasty! I've made it several times (without the pine nuts though) and it quickly has a become a favorite in our household! For the olivada, I use kalamata olives and purée them roughly in the food processor.
