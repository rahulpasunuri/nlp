This was an awesome dish! I loved the sauce with it. I'm thankful we have extras so I can have leftovers tonite!

I read the other reviews and was really suprised after I prepared this dish. It was absolutely the best tasting dish I have prepared using recipes from this website. The fish was succulent! The blended spices (I added onion powder to the flour, as well) from the fish and pecan butter sauce came together in a delectable way with a little kick from the tabasco. (I actually used Cholula hot sauce - just a little). My husband and I now consider this a real treat.

I dredged the fish in cajun deep fry batter mix and cooked in olive oil, which was fabulous. My daughter, not a fish eater, and her friend were fighting over it. The sauce, however, was underwhelming and too oily. I will stick to my favorite concoction for catfish: 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, some lemon juice and Louizianne Cajun Seasoning to taste.

This recipe didn't quite cut it. It was ok, but lacking something. I put a lot of hot sauce in it, but still had very little zing.

very tasty dish especially for a southerner who likes tobasco sauce.
