Outstanding! I was already a big fan of salad that combines fruit, nuts and cheese (my favorite being the Strawberry and Arugula Salad with Hazelnut Dressing on this site), but this recipe surpasses them all. Since some of my guests were not Roquefort lovers, I served the salad on a large oval platter and used Roquefort on half and goat cheese on the other half. Everyone raved!

Excellent salad. I frequently make this as a meal - always looking for a salad like this. Easy to cut it in half for 2 or 4. Will make over and over.

I've been using epicurious for years, but had never created a profile. This recipe inspired me to create a profile so I could review it. I want to review other recipes just so I can say "You need to try the Grilled Pear Salad with Port Vinaigrette!" Like other reviewers, I let the port reduce for about 40 minutes. Also, I'm vegetarian, so I didn't do the bacon. I did microwave some veggie bacon (Morningstar Farms) just to see how it would do in the salad. It was actually really good--as long as it's cooked to complete crunchiness and you put it on after the dressing. Finally, I say make the effort--drive out of your way if you have to--to get Roquefort. So good! As another reviewer mentioned, I think this salad would have been better after the main course, maybe because this salad is so hard to top!

Love this recipe! I add grilled chicken to the salad and it is amazing. As others have indicated, it takes much longer to reduce the port. Also very important to get ripe pears for this recipe.

I have made this 4 times. It is amazing! I use tawny port. I reduce the dressing by half. I find that is plenty and then you do not use as much port. I use a good quality port which is expensive so I do not want any waste.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I had to use pecans instead of walnuts due to non availability, and used tawny port for the same reason. Both made excellent substitutes. It takes way more than 10 minutes to reduce the port. Give yourself 30-40 instead. I broiled the pears until they were just starting to change color and they stayed very firm.

Great salad but it fell short of being outstanding. I garnished with a few small hearts cut from beet slices. Heartbeets -imagine that.

This is an outstanding recipe and was the highlight of our Easter dinner this year. The dressing is delicious but does make a bit too much, especially if you use baby greens. Back down on the amount you use on the salad, but do make the whole recipe as it is great on any salad. A keeper, for sure!

Fantastic! Dressing does go a long way, but is great next day--I made the second night with raspberries/pecans (keeping rest of recipe same). I'm not suggesting changing the recipe, though, we loved it as written.

YUM! I loved everything about this salad! The only changes I made were substituting pancetta for the bacon and I didn't strain the dressing. The grilled pears were amazing, I plan on grilling them more often!

A delicious and interesting combination of flavours and textures. I've made it twice so far, and the only thing I changed second time around was that I made about 1/2 the suggested amount of dressing and cut the pear slices into smaller pieces.

Wonderful, full body salad. I chopped the pear into pieces and sauteed in a VERY small amount of bacon fat. Can prepare everything ahead of time and mix at the last moment. Be careful with the amount of dressing you add to the salad.

A truly decadent salad. The grilled pears are fabulous. Ours weren't soggy in the least. So many wonderful flavors that each bite is like a wonderful adventure. A new favorite for special occasions.

I tried this recipe the other night and really enjoyed it, as did my dinner companion. I didn't have any problems with the pears, although I used butter rather than vegetable spray and opted to broil the pears. I think the key is to keep an eye on them and not cook them too long. I tried this salad with bacon wrapped scallops in a maple mustard sauce as a starter, and followed the salad with a mushroom risotto. A wonderful meal!

Dressing is not subtle, comes on too strong. Cook pears make for limp, weak presentation. Not the salad to make to impress dinner party guests. I'm not sure why so many rated this a 4. This salad is definitely good but not spectacular.

Rating: 3
Great salad! I recommend doing everything in the morning and then assemblying at the last minute. This gives the ingredients enough time to chill after cooking and keeps the salad crisp and fresh.

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!! I would definitely make this again. The next time I think I would use less olive oil. Also, I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the pears were a bit mushy. Any ideas on how to keep them crisper?

What a hit! Every guest asked for the recipe. I first made it for Easter and forgot to add the Roquefort (2 kids under the age of 18 months- what can I say). Made it again last night with the cheese and enjoyed it just as much. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious.

I've made this recipe many, many times - it is our all time favorite. Unfortunately, now that we live in England, it is very expensive to make - the cheapest, and you don't want to use the cheapest, bottle of port costs over $20. So now it is a special occasion salad. I also get requests for the recipe.

Rating: 4
The dressing was fantastic, as say the other reviewers! I halved it for a dinner for 6 and we still had lots left over (but it certainly didn't go to waste!) I changed it slightly - I used Belgian Endive instead of the greens, arranged the spears on one side of the plate and the (raw) pears on another, and drizzled the walnuts, cheese and dressing overtop. Looked very nice and tasted great! I omitted the bacon, as it was a 5-course meal with bacon elsewhere in another course, plus I wanted to lighten it up. Served it between a squash soup and beef tenderloin and it was perfect! Both my father and husband who don't like endive or blue cheese loved it and are still raving weeks later! I'll make it again exactly the way I did.

THIS SALAD IS EXCELLENT! I SOMETIMES "PLAY" WITH RECIPES BUT I DON'T CHANGE A THING WITH THIS ONE. I AGREE THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN 10 MINUTES TO REDUCE BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE TIME. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.

Rating: 4
Top notch - very "gourmet style". I prefer to serve this on individual plates. The dressing was the right amount but found it needed more more vinegar. Added an Emeril drizzle of the Trader's Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar (which is yummy all on its own!). The grilled pears add just the right touch of sweetness.

Rating: 4
I know, We're not supposed to "change" the recipe and then comment, But here are just a couple of small changes. First, I didn't grill the pears, just broil them for a few minutes until the edges begin to turn brownish. Secondly, I actually reduced the port as another person did (for about 30 minutes) and then tossed JUST the port in with the rest of the ingredients. The end result was rich and tasted decadent preceding an herb-encrusted beef tenderloin.

Much to my surprise, I was not wowed by this recipe. I thought I would love it, given the ingredients. The dressing was fabulous and that I will make again. The salad itself, however, was only so-so. I did not like the grilled pears - too mushy. Next time, if there is one, I will try this with raw pears.

Delicious, colorful salad.

Rating: 3
Very nice salad - the pears really complement the vinaigrette. I cooked the pears in a cast iron grill pan under the broiler and they came out perfectly. They tasted sweet and buttery. Substituted chevre for bleu cheese and it tasted fine. When reducing the port, it took mine about an hour to reduce, not 10 minutes. Recipe does make large amount of vinaigrette, so put extra in a jar to keep on hand. Do not recommend using any bitter greens in this salad.

Rating: 4
Excellent taste. Be careful, a little dressing goes a long way, so add to salad slowly and taste.

Wow! This is a decadent, delicious salad. I took it as my contribution to a dinner party, so I prepared everything ahead of time and packaged the parts separately. It came together wonderfully and was a big hit. The dressing alone is worth the extra fuss.

No matter when I make this recipe it always receives rave reviews. It is the Port Vinaigrette that put it over the top. I sometimes just broil the pears in the oven.

I was mildly disappointed in this salad. I need to preface my comments by saying that I recently made the Turkey Salad with Worcestershire Chutney Vinaigrette I found on this site. That salad is what this one aspires to be. They both aim for the same flavor and texture contrasts, but where the turkey salad was robust while possessing a light touch, I found this salad to be muddy--both visually and on the palate. What would I do differently? Tawny port versus ruby--it tastes better, and the vinaigrette wouldn't look as murky and unappetizing. Still a decent dressing though. Grilling the pears didn't dramatically change their appeal--and may have even made their consistency worse. It's not like you can see the grill marks with all that red vinaigrette. I'd go raw next time. The bacon made it more pedestrian--pancetta would be a bit more elegant. It's still a good salad, but I urge anyone to try the turkey salad instead. Similar but way better.

An unbelievably delicious salad, made so by the port vinaigrette. I've made this two times now and I just changed a couple of things. I thought 1 cup of walnut halves were too much, so I used about half that amount the second time I made this. I also used Maytag bleu cheese instead of the Roquefort, only because I love Maytag bleu cheese so much! The 2 cups of Port makes a HUGE amount of salad dressing - sorry, vinaigrette - but I use it for a few nights in a row. As a matter of fact, I made this salad for about 15 people and still had lots of dressing left over. Anyway, this is a killer recipe and one I'm sure I'll be making over and over again.

Rating: 4
This is a great salad. I think that it is different without being off the map. I have started keeping the port reduction on hand for a base for homemade vinagrettes. Last time, I didn't have time to grill the pears, but simply sliced, they were exceptional.

I've made this now two times (both times, I've halfed the recipe).... I didn't use pears this time when I made it. The dressing is wonderful on a bed of mixed spring greens. I will make this again & again! You can serve it with any entree (beef, chicken, etc.) & goes very well. Try it!

A wonderful salad, especially the dressing. The substitutions I made (because of what I had on hand) were candied pecans instead of toasted walnutes; pancetta instead of bacon and Anjou instead of Bosc pears. My guests loved it. Next time I'll try adding additional pears without broiling them. I used Porto Ramos Port (around $9) and it was great.

Absolutely DIVINE!!!! I am a salad nut, and this is the best ever. I'm so proud to have made it in my own home, rather than to have had it in a 4-star restaurant. I can't wait to make this for friends. What a wonderful melding of classic flavors. I used pecans instead of walnuts because I had them on hand, and subsituted a hearty blue cheese from our local farmer's market for the roquefort. Simply an amazing salad. If you love blue cheese and pears, you will think you've gone to heaven. Make the port dressing - it's perfect with this salad. Yum!

Rating: 4
I agree: it is fantastic, and the roquefort makes it special....as does a somewhat "decent" port. I have made it several times: note that the pears can be done in the morning and are fine....I have also simply cut the pears and ot bothered sauteing them, and it loses a tiny bit of excitement, but is still one of the best salads I have ever served!

Rating: 4
One of the most flavorful and amazing salads I've ever made or eaten. The combination of ingredients is wonderful but the port vinaigrette is what makes this salad pure perfection! Do yourself a favor and splurge on a decent, but not necessarily vintage, port, not the big jug kind.

This is absolutely terrific. My husband frequently requests it! If I'm unable to get the Roquefort from the supermarket (they don't always carry it), I substitute Stilton or Gorgonzola - I find that these work nicely also, even though Roquefort is my favorite.

I altered the recipe to make it suitable for a large, elegant dinner. I took out the bacon, since I found the salad salty enough, and I took out the blue cheese. In a bowl I mixed the blue cheese with a quarter as much each of butter and cream cheese, so the blue cheese wouldn't be as strong. I sliced baguette, toasted it, and spread the cheese mixture. I served several of these alongside the salad as croutons.

We thought this was excellent. The flavors compliment each other very well, and the port vinaigrette was sweet, but played well off the pungent taste of the cheese (we used gorgonzola). I will stash this recipe in my "light summer lunch" file as well.

Yummy!! I have served this to dinner guests twice and everyone agrees that it is wonderful. I disagree with the cook from Bethesda - I love the port dresing and think it well worth the price of a cheap port. Use un-ripe pears for best results.

This is a very delicious salad. Next time, I might not take the time to grill (broil) the pears. The dressing & bacon themselves pull it together and make it a very nice variation of the more usual l salad w/pears-apples, blue cheese and nuts. You should try it!

Rating: 3
Great recipe. Why? Because I've been making this salad for years, but always encounter the same two problems. How do you buy pears that will be perfectly ripe on the day of your dinner party? And how can you cut the pears ahead of time without discoloration so you're not carving fruit in the kitchen while guests are waiting at the table? This solves both! Grill less than ripe pears earlier in the day, as ripe pears will fall apart. And second, the cooking process keeps the fruit from turning color. Also, this salad works best with frisee and arugula in the greens mixture. I skipped the bacon, but think pancetta would work fine. Also, forget using two cups of good port just to make the dressing. The salad does even better with a walnut oil vinegrette started with a couple of tablespoons of orange juice and a touch of dijon mustard. Finally, it's best appreciated if served as its own course AFTER the main course.

What a great salad! It's hard to even call it a "salad" - it's a meal in itself. I originally had this at Max's Oyster Bar in West Hartford, CT, where it's called the "20th Century Salad" and I've been looking for the recipe ever since. Thank God I've found it.

This was the best salad I've ever had. I've always liked the paring of pears, walnuts & blue cheese (I used gargonzola), but it was the wonderful port wine dressing that made this so outstanding. I have Jewish friends that I will make this salad for - substituting beef bacon for regular bacon. No one should miss out.

This was delicious! I substituted proscutto for the bacon, which was a touch lighter and crisper. This salad is very rich and flavorsome - a beautiful start to dinner or would make a perfect lunch with some crusty bread. Will probably make this when friends drop by to watch the Olympics in just three weeks time!

The bacon and grilling the pears is a twist to this typical trendy salad. The port vinaigrette was very mild which allowed the other flavors to come through. Definetly worth a try.
