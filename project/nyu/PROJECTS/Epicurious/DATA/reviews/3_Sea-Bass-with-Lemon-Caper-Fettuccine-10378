I was looking for a light pasta dish to go with pan fried walleye. I took other reviewers suggestion to double the recipe, but used basil instead of parsley. Served with peppers and onions. The lemon sauce was light enough to let the taste of the fish shine through. I will make the sauce again. Fresh and simple.

Last night, I followed the recipe except for the sea bass preparation. We grilled the sea bass on our Big Green Egg. It was fabulous. We're making more lemon caper fettuccine tonight to serve with the left over sea bass. I can't wait!

Made this with Black Cod, but otherwise, exactly as the recipe stated. Served with steamed asparagus. Very easy and quick, and quite tasty! A great weekday meal.

Incredible!!! I of course changed it to work for what I needed. I used the dressing to marinade the sea bass. Then bbq'd it. Wow!

Took the advice of previous folks and doubled the sauce - also sauteed some shallots in the pan before cooking the fish.

Pretty bland, even with extra lemon and capers.

Please note that Chilean sea bass is considered endangered (along with orange roughy and swordfish). Many top chefs and restaurants refuse to serve it. Salmon is a wonderful alternative.

This was easy, but I thought that the cayenne clashed with the lemon-caper flavor. Next time I would omit the cayenne, double the capers, and use a more delicate pasta. Fettucine is too dense for the vinaigrette.

This is a great, quick recipe for a weeknight. Most of the ingredients besides the fish are things that are usually already in the fridge or pantry, so it takes very little preparation or forethought, and for being so simple, it turns out delicious! This will definitely become a staple at my house.

I have made this recipe several times and each time it is fabulous. I double the sauce and use very delicate pasta, fresh if I can find it. Sometimes I squeeze more lemon on the fish depending on how flavorful the lemons are. This recipe is a winner!

I thought this was outstanding for how ridiculously easy it was. I bumped up the amount of sauce a bit and also added a wee bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the pasta. Excellent.

This needs some additions but the idea is superb! Every Thursday in my family life is "Hot-dog Night" which simply means that they do not have to eat what I make and I get to make whatever I want to eat. It has been hot here in NH so I wanted something that did not heat up the oven, did a bit of research and found this, as our local grocery always seems to have sea bass, it didn't today but to my delight had my very favorite: gray sole. I used the recipe as a base (while the hot-dogs cooked) and added crushed garlic, fresh basil, lemon zest, a bit of honey, and red pepper flakes as well as Asaigio cheese to my pasta sauce. It was yummy. A real delight, no wonder this site achieves awards, it is wonderful.

We thought this was great.Next time it'll be 4 forks because I'll add way more lemon-caperosity. More cayenne too. Epicurious is great but never spicy enough!

The cayenne was overwhelming. I doubled the recipe to feed four, and perhaps I shouldn't have doubled the cayenne. Regardless, there wasn't enough oil and lemon juice to coat the pasta. I continue to be on the lookout for a good lemon fish and pasta recipe, but this isn't it!

Delicious. Much richer than it sounds. We made this while in Miami so the fish was super fresh. I will be making this again very soon.

I served this to 3 people and we all loved it! If you are hungry, I would double the recipe with the exception of the fish so that everyone has more pasta.

I made this with salmon and added two small chopped tomatoes to the sauce. It was beautiful, healthy and delicious. And SO easy!
