Unfortunately to me these tasted like really big meatballs without any sauce. I did not care for them. My husband liked the kick of flavor the Jalapeno's added but other than that it was not that impressive.

My husband & I are not meatloaf eaters, but my visiting dad wanted it for dinner. I didn't want to make the plain meatloaf that we all grew up with, so found this recipe. Sounded great. It did turn out gray & unappetizing. Luckily for me, my dad eats anything. I would suggest to others to use the skilet instead of the loaf pan, as the recipe offers to use as well. Thought this was a waste of money & time.

My husband and I loved this dish. I used habenaros, instead of jalapenos, which I could not find and I also substituted hickory smoked bacon. It was excellent and simple to make. I will definitely make it again. Although I will use a bigger loaf pan, as the sauce did spill over the sides. Luckily, I had lined the bottom of the stove with foil!

Smoked Cheddar-Jalapeno Ranch Meat Loaf is a great alternative to the standard meat loaf. The texture is good, and it has great flavor.

After reading reviews we didn't add salt, but salted it on our plates to taste (which wasn't much with the Worcestershire.) We also used turkey sausage and turkey bacon, which cut down the grease. We still needed to mop up some remaining grease from the top with a paper towel. Next time, we'll make it with ground turkey as well. Overall though, we really really liked it. I'm not usually big on meatloaf, but this was so different! Yum!

This dish was extremely easy to make, very tasty and a different twist on standard meatloaf. We really enjoyed it.

I used chorizo in place of the pork sausage last time I made this and WOW, it's great! Love this recipe.

I didn't think that this recipe was greasy at all. I went to the butcher and they ground stew meat and pork together. I guess I used a better quality of meat with less fat. The smoked cheddar gave it a wonder flavor. I also used double smoked bacon...can't wait to make this again!

We enjoyed this very much. The aroma in the kitchen was incredible while preparing. It tastes a lot like sausage and is very rich, so portions should be kept small. I could easily see this served as a breakfast meat. It had just the right amount of spice/heat to it. Yummy!

After the reviews I was a bit leery of trying this, but decided to go for it anyway. It was fine, not over-greasy nor grey. It wasn't the most exciting meal I've ever made but there was certainly nothing wrong with it, and it was at least a bit different than "plane-jane" meatloaf. The next day I heated slices of the loaf in a pan with salsa and noone complained about the left-overs at all.

I blanched the bacon in a frying pan with about two cups of water for five minutes or so. This cooked out much of the extra fat, then followed the recipe from there. My family loved it! Tasty,juicey,wonderful! No big globs of grease,just moist enough

This was quite possible the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted IN MY LIFE. The grease overflowed the pan and flooded into my oven, and an hour is not even CLOSE to the correct amount of time to cook this AWFUL DISH. Bread crumbs would be a good addition to this recipe to soak up some of the fat.

This meatloaf was disgusting. My meatloaf pan was clogged with grease. I usually like all of the individual ingrediants but mixed together just made my stomach hurt.

Great meatloaf! I added extra jalapenos and smoked cheese to make it deadly! Should go well with the new aspargus and yellow pepper fritata.

Good flavors...Food safety? gound Beef should be cooked to 155 or more

I reviewed the comments and looked at the reciept and thought with the bacon and worstershire sauce,salt should be to taste! What I'm going to try is extra-hot rotel tomatoes & chile peppers drained and use pregresso bread crumbs to bound,and make a pocket in the middle of the meat loaf to put the cheese and inclose, then top off with kepchup and garnish with jalapinos & shreaded cheese

Loved it! I also added some other ingredients... added 1/2 cup of salsa to sauted the onions and mixed with Kitchen Boquet browning sauce all in one sauce-pan and added to the mix. Cooked as specified and Wham!!! It was a hit! Yum-Yum!

My husband and I both loved this meatloaf. It had a great texture, and wonderful flavor. We thought the spiciness was just right. I used the "meatloaf mixture" available at the supermarket - ground beef, pork and veal - and it turned out great. After reading other reviews, I reduced the salf to 1 tsp, which seemed perfect.

I was reluctant to make this recipe after reading the reviews. I tried it anyway. The mixture of flavors in this meat loaf go together so nicely. I sauteed the onions with the jalapenos, this gave it more flavor without all that heat from the peppers. I also had to substitute the beef with sausage and this made the loaf less dry and more flavorful. I would definately make this dish again.

Well, it certainly sounds good, doesn't it? Chopped sirloin, pork, spicy peppers and a nice smoked cheddar - how in the world could this go wrong? I'm not sure myself. I prepared this dish exactly as described by the recipe, using the highest quality ingreients from the local gourmet grocer, but it was a bit of a disaster. The meatloaf (absolutely huge, by the way) had a tremendous amount of thick grey fat collected around the edges of the pan. Incredibly unappetizing! Once that was scrapped away, the meatloaf itself still seemed slick with fat and oils. And it was too salty. 2 tsp of salt is way too much. Stay away.

I really thought this was a unique recipe. Tasted GREAT. Couple thoughts: 1) Make sure you get some ground pork, as all beef is too dry. 2) You could skip the bacon, but I wouldn't. 3) If you saute the bacon, might as well saute the onion in the bacon fat while you're at it. 4) I too, would cut down on the jalapenos. 5) Despite all the flavor, it still needs a nice pinch of salt and pepper. 6) I then cooked mine on a dish inside my gas Weber grill with some soaked wood chips wrapped in foil to provide some smoke. Keep temperature about 375-400F for little over 1 hour, then run under broiler for 5 minutes, then let sit 15 minutes, tented, to firm up before slicing. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes. Wow. Wife raved.

We were treated to quite the different taste for a meatloaf. The flavor was wonderful and there weren't any leftovers. I didn't find it time comsuming or difficult, so I will make this again and again. A little spicy for my children so I'll cut back on the jalepeno.
