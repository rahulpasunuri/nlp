There is a lot of chopping involved but like Bear_Dino from CA I felt it was well worth it. I served it at a small dinner party and got rave reviews. HOWEVER, I very much appreciated A Cook from Annapolis, MD's dissatisfied comments because it made me look at the recipe more carefully and I made some changes to accommodate them (which I agreed with--why labor over an unexciting sauce which a risotto does not really need anyway and if it's a creole sauce how can it be unexciting??). This is what I did--I made the creole sauce more authentic, starting with fresh tomatoes and not blending it so that there were lovely chunks of tomatoes and vegetables. I also got superb seasoning assistance from my husband--like Bear_Dino he added lots of black pepper, but in creole fashion also white pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika (and likely other stuff too--he's good!!). It had the appropriate kick! Then rather than serving the creole sauce separately, I stirred it directly into the risotto as part of the liquid and reduced the chicken stock accordingly. The result was a very flavorful creole dish (that was also beautiful with the vegetable and tomato chunks). I hope the Cook from Annapolis sees this and tries it again. BTW, we used to live in Annapolis and just spent the holidays there with our family. Small world!

There's a lot of chopping involved, but this recipe is worth it. I made it for my birthday with crab cakes. I added a bit more black pepper than was necessary to the sauce but it gave it a nice bite. Best risotto I've ever made.

Way too much work for very little in return. The sauce was not very exciting and the risotto does not really need a sauce to begin with. I was way under impressed. No "creole" flavoring at all.
