I tried this recipe because I wanted to try a different version of baba ghanouj, rather than the same old classic version (which I do love)... I followed the recipe exactly, weighed the eggplant and grilled it over charcoal. I pulsed it in the food processor so that the eggplant texture was still intact. I thought it was delicious, especially after the flavors melded at room temperature for awhile. I would make it again, alternating with a more traditional version.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly (or at all). I only had one eggplant and I peeled it, cut it longways, salted and let the eggplant sit for an hour on paper towels to get rid of the moisture. Then I brushed the slices with olive oil mixed with crushed garlic and pepper and broiled it until cooked and charred in places on both sides. I immediately transferred the charred eggplant to the food processor and added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and a tablespoon of lemon juice, & the zest of the whole lemon for flavor. I also added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic, two tablespoons of tahini and I added the sour cream in tablespoons until it reached the desired consistency (2). The use of sour cream is actually not so unconventional in Baba Ganouj. I tried this dish in just about every Greek restaurant in the Plaka in Athens and many restaurants substituted mayo or sour cream for the yogurt. I prefer sour cream to plain yogurt.

I tried this both ways using most everyone's advice. Reducing the amount vinegar, tahini, and garlic; grilling instead of roasting in the oven (even roasted the garlic on the grill too), and scraping instead of peeling. The way with vinegar and sour cream was okay--just don't try to pass it off as ghanouj--call it something else. The other way without vinegar and yogurt instead I liked better anyway because after spending so much time with the eggplants I sure wanted to taste them. I would make this again (just to try with the pomegranites!) with the alterations: add a little more lemon juice, omit the vinegar and sour cream, at least 4 roasted garlic cloves, and 3/4c. tahini.

We have made this a few times for parties, and it's always a hit! The recipe makes a lot, and keeps well. Last time I made it and threw it in the fridge for a few days before serving. I used 4 medium sized eggplants and it turned out great. I plan to use plain yogurt next time but will reduce the vinegar.

I love baba ganouj, but I would not make this particular recipe again. Perhaps my eggplants were a bit small, but the vinegar completely overwhelmed the dish. I often freely substitute plain yoghurt for sour cream, which probably put the dish over the edge in terms of tartness, also. Anyway, since the vinegar is one of the first ingredients in, I was stuck with very sour baba ganouj if by adding it all at once, like the recipe calls for. I was bummed.

I ordered Baba Ghanouj from a local restaurant and loved it. I wanted to make it for my book club party and, while everyone ate it and commented on it, this Baba was not the same as I had previously had. I would not use as much Tahini, perhaps, and I would not put the eggplant in the food processor - I prefer it chunky. A few tomatoes added would probably be good too.

I love the way the vinegar and sour cream made this taste. The traditional version is sometimes a little bland to me, but this was full of flavor.

I thought that this recipe was great. So did the 15 or so people that I had as company the night I served it. For those who question the vinegar and sour cream, I say, who cares! The Baba was great and worth making again.

Despite this recipe's unconventional use of sour cream and other ingredients, I have received nothing but rave reviews for this dish. I have made it many times. It is simple and delicious.

While I appreciate other posters' points that vinegar and sour cream are not present in "authentic" baba ghanouj, I wonder how many of them actually MADE this recipe. I made it as written and everyone liked it. The vinegar and sour cream aren't patently obvious (of course, that may mean they're not necessary), but the tahini certainly comes through.

good grief, why would anyone use vinegar and sour cream? a note about the eggplants: don't "peel" them, scrape the flesh off the skin with a spoon. this way, you get the smokiest bits of eggplant, flecks of charred skin, and the best flavor.

Red wine vinegar and sour cream? What for? This is not even close to authentic baba. And it certainly needs some salt to bring out the flavors.

For the sake of authenticity: 1- This is a mutated version (even though it may be very tasty) of a dish popular in a number of Middle-Eastern cuisines especially those of the Eastern Mediterranean called "Mtabbal". Even though the authentic recipes differ slightly from one cuisine to another, none of them ever include vinegar and especially no sour cream. 2- The mentioned accompaniments (with the exception of pita bread) are strictly somebody's personal invention. It is customary however to garnish the plate with about a Tbsp. of fresh pomegranate seeds when in season. 3- This plate is often confused in Lebanese and Jordanian cuisines with "Baba Ghannouj" as it is known in Turkish and Syrian cuisines, that does not include Tahini but finely chopped bell pepper and sumac instead. 4- A personal remark: the quantity of garlic is extremely unrealistic (except for garlic addicts) as the norm is usually one big clove per a medium-sized eggplant.

My advise would be,do not put any vinegar,tahini or sourcream, but leave the lemon and add two cups of plain yougurt and parsley to garnish. Drizzle some olive oil and decorate with olives. It will be light tasty.

Don't use the sour cream or vinegar at all.

Vinegar and sour cream are alien to this type of Mid East food and should not be used at all.

As a first generation American, I was raised on the foods from my parent's homeland in the Middle East. This is an interesting recipe, but the additions of sour cream and vinegar add unnecessary fat and unfamiliar flavor to what was already a fantastic recipe. Baba ghanoush, in both it's simplicity as well as flavor is an old favorite. It is also very good when the eggplant is smoked on a grill rather than roasted in the oven. This simple difference adds a subtle but tasty smoky flavor.
