Excellent. I only used frisee - no greens or parsley. Poured out half of the bacon grease and added an additional tablespoon of vinegar.

Similarly to other reviewers, I had trouble finding fresh, nice-looking frisee, so I opted to go in a slightly different direction and use baby spinich. Thus I also omitted the parsley leaves and dandelion greens. The salad was delicious and very simple to make. The only thing that didn't seem right, was that I think i needed a bit more of the vinegar mixture. Will make and use a few tablespoons more next time, but will definitely make again, either with frisee or again with spinich.

Rave reviews everytime I make this, always asked for the recipe.

Also! Used "baby yellow potatoes" from Trader Joe's (they're so cute!) instead of fingerlings, and cut them in half as suggested in another review.

This salad is AWESOME. Warm salad is always interesting, but with bacon and potatoes! The second time I used this recipe, I made tons of changes and the results were absolutely delicious: firstly, we used steak instead of bacon (!!). We also used bagged "southern style greens" instead of frisee/dandelion, which you'd think would be too strong but wilted w/ the warm steak and potatoes. Lastly, I made a vinaigrette of spicy honey mustard and gorgonzola. Everyone loved it and it's so hearty. Absolutely a keeper.

...oh yeah, few more things... found both frisee and dandeloin greens but not fingerlings; substituted quartered yukon gold potatoes. Also poured out some of the bacon grease.

Excellent! Also goes extremely well with the panko-crusted chicken with mustard maple sauce on this site for a superb fall meal. Might add a touch more sherry vinegar next time for a little more tang.

Very simple recipe to make and great results. I substituted just picked spinach for the greens, worked beautifully with the bacon & shallots. The second time I made it I cut the potatoes in half to get a little more crispiness. A definite crowd pleaser.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it. There's quite a bit of bacon fat so I poured off most of it before adding the shallots and potatoes. My guests don't like raw parsley so I wilted it for a few seconds after adding the oil & vinegar.

If I can't find the greens, I substitute Curly Endive for the frisee & spring mix for the dandelion greens. I can get 8 servings out of this. I serve it with Beef & Guinness Pie. Great addition to our St. Paddy's day menu.

slice the potatoes in half lengthwise, brush with oil, and roast cut site down for a crispy brown finish.

Funny I was just browsing through this year-old issue of B.A. (looking for something to make tonight). Spotted this recipe and remember making it last year. Was absolutely fantastic ~ a really nice change-of-pace side dish and superb alongside the mustard-roasted chicken. We are having our gourmet group over next month and I may just have to make it again. Surprised there aren't more reviews, because this was one of the best B.A. recipes of last year!

I've made this a few times and everyone loves it. Depending on what looked best at the market, I've used many types of greens as frisee is hard to get on its own. As long as you have something with a good texture and something with a good strong flavor, I've found there are several types that work well.

Awesome! My husband, not a salad fan, absolutely loved this. Excellent.

Out of this world delicious!!!!! Although I had to use Endive & Escarole because it very difficult to find Frisee or Danaelion here. I actually ate 3/4 of the salad myself.
