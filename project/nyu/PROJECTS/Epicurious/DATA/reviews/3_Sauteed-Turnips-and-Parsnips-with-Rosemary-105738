I liked the flavors though the shallots and rosemary are the heart of the dish. I didn't get the outside crunchy. I think that would make the dish 3 forks so I guess it's user error.

I make this over and over again, using whatever root vegetables I can find. My husband loves it, and that's quite something to say if you knew my husband!

This is similar to one of the ways I was taught to cook parsnip. Unfortunately I, personally, don't enjoy the mix of the turnip with the sweet parsnip. I cut about 3 inch lengths of both parsnip and carrots, which are both naturally sweet, and then half or quarter those lengths, depending on how thick they are, so they are about the size of your baby finger (not a hard fast rule!). Place them in a frying pan (no-stick works best for me) so that there is enough room to have them all in contact with the bottom of the pan, and add just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. Add 1 or two Tbls. of butter, depending on how large a pan you are using, and over med.-high heat, cover them with a lid to steam them until just tender. When the water has all evaporated, the butter allows the veggies to saute, but watch them to avoid scorching,reduce heat to med.-low and just keep turning them as they brown on all sides and I promise you, they will get this sweet crisp crust on them that is devine! When they are browned on all sides, they are done. You can do this slowly over 30 mins. or increase your heat and do them in half the time but you really have to watch them closely. The slower, the sweeter, I find. I hope you enjoy this way of cooking parsnips!

I've made this several times, and each time it's been delicious. In a pinch, I have used regular onion in place of shallots. The turnips and parsnips complement each other well, and the rosemary and garlic really make the dish. An easy side dish with excellent flavour.

This dish is delicious! I added extra garlic,rosemary and some thyme and kept the heat high to get a nice carmelization.

This recipe is a delicious autumn side dish. A few comments for previous reviewers: this is not a dish that would mask the flavors of the vegetables, so if you don't like turnips and parsnips, don't try this. Also, I used a 1/3 inch dice, which worked perfectly. Look again at the photo--it's enlarged, but if you compare the dice to the size of the rosemary or shallots, you'll realize 1/3 inch is correct.

I had never tried parnips before but after preparing this recipe it's my new favorite vegetable. I also served this to guests on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!

You have to be a lover of turnips and parsnips to rate this recipe higher. I added more garlic, rosemary, salt, butter, olive oil to boost the flavor but in the end you might as well take the T and P's - boil'em,mash'em and add butter. Your time would be better spent.

I'm with ljohnson@grey.com -- the photo showed larger dice. The first time I do a recipe, I follow instructions. Next time, it'll be a larger dice. It is a nice dish.

This dish turned out well but I found that 1/3 inch dice is much too tiny (just look at the picture, those are not 1/3 inch cubes). So, the sauteing time was much longer since I used larger pieces of parsnips and turnips. Make sure to cook long enough so that the vegetables becme carmelized, that's what makes the presentation attractive and the taste delicious.

While this is a very easy and hearty dish, it was a little bland. Next time I'll add more olive oil, herbs and spices--and more parsnips.
