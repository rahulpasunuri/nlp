Not easy, not tasty, not a do-over. The dough is too sticky to work with and the process takes too much supervision. The result was a overly salty, misshapen, crusty stick (and i didn't even add salt at the end). During cooking, both the rosemary sprig and the cornmeal burnt. I was expecting more rosemary punch, of which there is almost none.

Ab fab! EASY! I added fresh chopped garlic and chopped oil packed sun dried tomato's to the rosemary. Next time I may add some chopped Nicoise olives, too. I also didn't spray the oven, just put a pan of hot water on the bottom rack. Took less time to bake, watch carefully! I'm giving as a gift with some homemade roasted garlic mustard.

I make these often as a side to dip in marinara sauce. I don't bother with the spraying, I just put a pan with water in the oven for moisture as another viewer recommended.

These were easy to make and very tasty! I skipped the sprigs and did use the coarse salt. Also, the cooking time was shorter than stated.

These are good. I actually forgot the olive oil and milk completely. Next time I will remember them for flavor. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour. It made for a more rustic breadstick, but tasty. These are fun to make with kids.

These were simple and delicious. I used plenty of dried rosemary and skipped the sprigs. They didn't rise much so I was worried, but they puffed up beautifully in the oven. Instead of all the spritzing, I used The Cook's Bible method, preheating a roasting pan in the oven and then adding boiling water to it when I put the breadsticks in. Then the steam is constant and you don't let the oven heat out. They baked in just 15 minutes that way.

I had a problem getting the breadsticks to rise. I also think the next time I try to bake these I am going to leave out the extra rosemary sprigs and maybe brush the tops with olive oil prior to brushing on the egg mixture.

For someone who can cook anything except a recipe with the word YEAST in the ingredient list, I found this recipe to be very easy an delicious. I have added thyme and freshly grated hard cheeses also, and they were delicious. I have some in the oven even as I type. They are easy to make. In the past when attempting to make bread, I have ended up with "door stops", but these breadsticks are a delight. Try them. Leave out the rosemary springs, not necessary.

Add extra rosemary. It takes much less baking time than listed - about 20 minutes. Everyone loves them.

I had a tough time getting the dough to rise. The rosemary really didn't come out in the final product.

These were delicious and easy. I skipped the rosemary sprig froufrou and only lightly salted them. They were excellent.
