Delightful! Had to double the recipe to fill a 9-inch spring form pan. Ended up with a thicker crust than expected but the flavour was terrific. A light shortbread with a tart lemon curd. I added raspberries and some mint to finish. Rave reviews from all who tasted it

I don't have a food processor so I bought almond flour and made a paleo crust out of that, olive oil, and an egg. Baked it blind and forgot to prick it so it puffed up. I haven't eaten the pie yet and wouldn't review it as a pie anyway. But I was pleased to have too much filling for my crust. THE FILLING IS SO DELICIOUS!!!

The lemon curd in this recipe is PERFECT! I added a tablespoon of dried lavender to the tart recipe to create a Lemon Lavender Tart. See it here : http://eatingininstead.com/2013/03/25/lemon-lavender-tart/

I made this dessert for Easter Sunday and it was a big hit. I read all of the reviews first. To help make working with the crust easier (it is sticky), here is what worked for me. After mixing the crust in my food processor, I roughly spread the mixture over the tart pan bottom with a heavier concentration around the pan sides. Place the pan in your freezer for four minutes. When you take it out to pat the dough into place, it will be very easy to work with and the cold prevents the butter from melting out. Also, although I patted the dough all the way up the tart pan sides, I discovered the filling does not go up that far. The next time, I will only take it 2/3 to 3/4 of the way up the sides. This will also allow a little more dough for spreading across the bottom. I did do blind baking using pie weights for about 10 minutes, then another three or four minutes with the foil removed. The crust was delicious.

I had great luck with the crust the first time using the following handling tips. I put the tart pan in the freezer before starting to mix the dough. I lowere the oven temp to 400F because I used a dark (nonstick) pan and used foil and beans for weight for the first 10 mins. Then I removed the foil/beans and returned the crust to the oven to finish browning. I had better luck patting the crust into the pan with my fingers rather than the offset spatula.

We loved the finished product but I did have some difficulty with the crust: one false start (did not read the part about chilling before baking!) and just some overall challenges. I did not have quite enough dough to go up the sides of the pan and found that it browned very quickly - under 10 minutes. Used both regular and Meyer lemon in curd.

As recommended by others, I weighted the shell before baking by placing a sheet of aluminum foil and dried beans. I baked the crust for 13 minutes (would cut back to maybe 10 minutes next time), removed the beans and foil, covered the edges and baked another few minutes to brown the bottom. Making the shell the day before makes completion the next day a breeze. I am more a cook than a baker, but this recipe worked well for me. Very intense lemon flavor - delicious! And beautiful when garnished with a few raspberries. I will definitely be making this again.

Great tart and the curd was effortless; key lime could easily be substituted for the lemon. As a professional caterer, I agree with others that pastry requires patience to work with but the lightness of it was sublime. I molded the dough onto the tart pan after laying a tray of ice under the pan; this helped to harden the dough while I was molding it to the pan. Blind baked with weights beforehand. If you prefer a less fussy dough, any sweet tart pastry would do, as would any lemon bar type of crust. My guests loved this served with homemade whipped cream.

Last week I was in Nice for work and had a lovely slice of lemon tart (although it had a meringue topping). I also happened to bring home some french olive oil as a gift for my husband. I was so excited to see this recipe and have a chance to recreate that tart for my family for Easter dessert. This recipe did not disappoint. The lemon flavor is strong but wonderful. And pretty fool-proof too! My husband will be requesting this again I'm sure!

I was disappointed with this recipe. It does taste good, but the crust was very unpleasant to work with. It is the consistency of a wet paste, not a dough, and I had to tap it slowly by finger into the tart pan, leaving it only 1/8" thick. Then the edges began to brown within 2 minutes of being in the oven (even covered with foil). 425 is too high for a crust this thin. If you use aluminum foil, just cover the tart pan and don't use pie weights. I tried that and it stuck to the foil. After baking it was very crumbly and fell apart at the edges - no surprise, it had to be spread so thin! So, I have to agree with others, the recipe proportions for the crust will create a super thin layer that may not hold together reliably. The tart did not look very presentable as a result of these issues during baking. I had to remake it, reducing oven temperature and increasing crust proportion. Not a 4 star recipe as a result.

my first time making lemon tart but by far not the first I've ever tasted. This has exactly the right tangy tartness I always look for in a lemon tart and rarely find quite to my liking, even in a French patisserie. I made this to go with the moroccan slow-cooked lamb (also on this site and also exceptional) and it was the perfect ending to the delicious and richly flavoured main course. some notes though: in my European convection oven the crust was burned by 10 minutes in (unfortunately I'd set a timer and left the room so was too late to save it). The second crust attempt was browned in 4 minutes. I also found that with my large lemons I only needed two for more than enough juice. Despite the crust mishap, this was an incredibly delicious and very simple recipe to make. I also didn't have a food processor, just a small processor that could only hold the almonds, so I just ground them up fine and did the rest of the crust with a pastry blender and a spatula. Everything turned out deliciously, and I will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night and I had enough dough for the crust (though the temp was too high and it got very brown) but when I poured in the curd it got all soggy and the whole thing just fell apart. Did anyone else have this issue? Should I blind bake the crust first would that help?

This is a perfect spring dessert. So pretty and zesty. Yes, the crust is a little fussy but as long as you're careful, it comes out beautiful. I burned the first crust and broke the second but with the filling inside, it didn't make a difference. Spring for the fruity olive oil. It's worth it.

Killer dessert. We've begun calling it 'the lemon cloud'... not sure if it's always this light or my boyfriend's over-zealous whisking but either way it is divine. Awesome crust also. I followed the recipe exactly, no need for extra crust.

Love this recipe. I has to substitute pecans for almonds and took the advice of others and blind-baked the crust. It was tender and delicious. This is now my go-to lemon tart recipe.

This is my favorite dessert (and my husband's). It is the fastest, easiest lemon curd I've ever made and the olive oil in both the curd and shell is spectacular. What truly makes this tart extraordinary, though, is the toasted almonds. I go all-out and triple the amount -- better and better.

I made this today, but had to substitute hazelnuts for almonds. I baked the crust a bit too much but otherwise, this came out lovely! It was easy, but a bit time consuming: make the crust. Shape the crust. Chill the crust. Bake the crust. Cool the crust. Make the filling. Chill the tart. Clean up.

This is a FANTASTIC dessert!!! Easy to make, not many ingredients, most of which you are likely to have on hand. Husband is a "lemonphile" and his favorite has always been lemon meringue pie which I don't especially care for and detest making. This tart satisfies HIS lemon craving and MY laziness, plus it makes just enough for two people to finish off before the dessert is past its prime - the tart keeps really well in the fridge for a few days. Crust didn't even get soggy. I encourage you to try this tart for any occasion... could be dressed up with whipped cream or berries or some sliced toasted almonds or any number of things,I'm sure. Enjoy!!

I only had an 11" tart pan so I doubled the crust recipe and used a single recipe of the curd. I used all suggestions including blind crust baking with pie weights (dried pinto beans) and wisking corn starch with other ingredients before adding the eggs. It came out beautifully and I got rave reviews.

P.S. I could not find a fruity olive oil, so I used regular (organic) extra virgin olive oil and it came out great. Non-organic would probably be fine too.

Wow, that's tart!!! As a lemon dish should be. Very good and easy to make. Will do it again and again. A suggestion for the reviewer whose corn starch clumped: whisk it the first time with all the ingredients suggested EXCEPT the egg. Once you've whisked out the corn starch lumps, add your egg and whisk it again. I was sure this was going to be a flop because I thought the crust was going to be thick and the filling thin. Not the case. It was perfect. (And I used another reviewer's comments and used aluminum foil and pie weights when I saw my crust start to bubble and brown too soon: crisis averted.)

Part 3: The lemon curd: my only complaint here is that the cornstarch didn't fully break down when cooking. Why? Is there a trick I'm unfamiliar with? I thought with boiling hot temperatures I wouldn't have any problems. I even used a rubber spatula after taking the pot off the heat to try and push it down and break it up, but much of the cornstarch still wouldn't declump. (FYI, it is brand new; I just bought it a day before making this recipe.) So what I had to do was put it through a strainer to separate the usable curd from the unusable portion. This was a pain but it worked. Overall, I want to repeat that this recipe has fantastic flavor, but it will probably take you longer than expected and might be frustrating, regardless if you're a beginner or a novice. Overall, I want to repeat that this recipe has fantastic flavor, but it will probably take you longer than expected and might be frustrating, regardless if you're a beginner or a novice. I'd make this again if I had a different olive oil dough recipe (one that produced less delicate crusts) and if I figured out how to get the cornstarch to declump while cooking.

Part 2: The first time I made the crusts, they got too dark so I went to the trouble to make additional crusts. The second time I intensely watched the oven instead of going by their suggested time minus a few minutes. My advice is to be careful. Maybe the crust tends to get dark more quickly because of the olive oil? I also wanted to note that the crust tends to puff up on its own, leaving little room for filling. To help counteract this, on my second batch of crusts, I covered them with rectangles of aluminum foil and then put baking beans on top. I made sure the aluminum foil covered the edges of the tarts since I knew they had a tendency to darken quickly. I cooked them like this for about 7 minutes then I uncovered them and let them cook for another 3 before I took them out. My biggest complaint with the crusts is how delicate they are. So I said I made 2 batches of crusts. The second batch turned out beautifully, but I broke 2 of the crusts when I was trying to detach the mold. With all that olive oil and butter, you'd think that the mold would practically fall right off. That wasn't exactly the case. They weren't hard to detach, but the crust are SO fragile that you have to be super super super careful with them. I can't emphasize this enough. Just because of this, I might hunt for another olive oil tart dough recipe. The flavor goes just beautifully with the curd, but I can't even guarantee that I'll have any crusts after cooking so that's pretty risky.

Part 1: Since I last posted a review, I have made the whole recipe and wanted to comment. Overall the tart is fantastic. I used an expensive and wonderful-tasting lemon olive oil by O & Co. (from France) to make the olive oil dough and the filling. The taste of the crust is incredible. The lemon curd filling is also just fantastic. I normally don't make lemon desserts (I don't really like them) but this is a five-star recipe all the way and the results are phenomenal. In addition to the glowing review, I also have several cautions. First the dough: it's difficult at best. At the point where you press it into the tart pan(s), it's sticky so this makes it difficult to mold. I tried using flour, but this really didn't help the situation. I did find that molding them the best I could, chilling them for a little while in the refrigerator or freezer, and then bringing them back out and trying to smooth out the dough was an okay work-around. But they were still hard to deal with. I made mini tarts instead of one big tart and found that I only had enough dough for 3 mini tarts, not 4 (which is what I should have been able to make.) So I would agree with the people who said the recipe didn't yield enough dough.

Rating: 4
Wonderful depth of flavor!. Addressing the problems other reviewers had: 1) I did not increase the crust recipe and it turned out just right. The crust is supposed to be rather thin and delicate, which adds to the tart as a composition. It may seem that you do not have enough when you are spreading the pastry dough in the pan, but remember it is supposed to be thinner than what you would do for a pie or many other tarts. 2) To the people who said their crust bubbled or that it ws better when they froze it first: you are probably letting your butter get too warm. It is important to work quickly when making crusts to keep the butter as cold as possible, which ensures a flaky crust. 3) For the person who said that the over was too hot - keep the oven at the temp the recipe suggested and keep and eye on your crust. If you notice the sides browning too quickly, remove from oven and cover sides with foil. Or you can blind bake, in which you would cover the entire crust with foil and weigh down with pie weights. This should resolve your issues with over browning. I recommend following the suggestion in the recipe about using French olive oil, it will contribute to the delicate flavor.

This is the third time I've made this tart. The past two times my tart shell has gotten very bubbly during baking. Does anyone else have this trouble? I bake mine after 30 minuntes in fridge in a tart pan on a cookie sheet in the middle of the oven. Also, anyone every try this with limes?

I have only made the crust so far (delicious) but I am surprised that no one mentioned how difficult it is to mold the newly-formed dough into the tart pan. I went ahead and did my best with forming it, and then I put my tart pan in the freezer for about 10 minutes. That was enough time to stiffen the dough and allow me to make the shell a little more attractive by smoothing out the area that would be seen after assembling.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. I'm a pastry chef, but always appreciate easy recipes that yield incredible results. I've made this many times, and it turned out great each time. Please don't make any bizarre substitutions to the recipe (my Epicurious pet peeve) without following the recipe exactly the first time, and be sure to use a light fruity olive oil.

This was super yummy. I didn't have almonds so I substituted with walnuts. The only issue was baking the tart in 425 degree heat. Its too high and burned the dough. Definitely reduce the heat.

This tart is so easy to make (I say this as a person who fears crust- making), but it is absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as written with one exception: I drizzled chocolate over the top. It was a wonderful embellishment. Next time, I may spread a layer of chocolate over the crust itself instead since I like the idea of the chocolate as a hidden surprise. I found the amount of lemon curd to be adequate. By the way, I've had a difficult time with lemon curd in the past, but this version is very simple. I'll definately be making this recipe again and again!

this is the first review i am wirintg after using this site for more than 6 years, which should suggest how good this was!! i double the crust recipe (didn't have to use it all, but used more than 1 potion for sure) but otherwise made it just as directed and it turned out wonderfully. my boyfriend asked where i bought it, then when he found out i made he said that if he were having it in a restaurant he wouold send kudos to the pastry chef!! a keeper for sure.

great tart but I'm wondering if anyone else had the problem I did.When I made it the 1st time the crust was so soft that it looked like a tart with no sides-I just pored the curd on top & it still tasted great. The second time I made it I froze the crust for 10 min first before baking & it turned out a lot better at least it looked like a tart.I also found it hard to spread the filling up the sides of the tart pan evenly-Any suggestions?

This tart was AMAZING! I will be making many of these this summer. I followed the directions from the first reviewer and increased the tart shell recipe by 50%. I also added three tablespoons extra lemon concentrate to the lemon curd because I like my sweets more sour =) Besides that I stuck to the recipe and it was wonderful! At first I thought the tart shell was too rich, but now I find it to be complimentary to the tartness of the lemon curd. My mother, stepfather, and bestfriend LOVED it... and when I went to the fridge to have another slice it was gone. So my best advice would be to make two tarts instead of one =)

Rating: 4
Following the previous reviewer's suggestion I increased the quantities by 50% for the crust and that seemed about the right amount. A couple of suggestions: give the almonds a few pulses in the food processor before adding the flour etc - my almonds weren't being chopped, buried in all that flour, so I ended up tipping everything out, picking out the almonds and putting them back in the processor on their own. Also my crust overcooked slightly in the time specified (very unusual for my oven) so next time I will check sooner. The tart was delicious though, and looked really impressive.

I'm so excited that I get to be the first to review a recipe! Having said that, however, if there had been another review, I would have known that you need AT LEAST 50% more crust. I was in a hurry when I was making this, so I wasn't too thrilled when I had to go back and make more crust. I would probably suggest just doubling it so you can have an nice, thick crust around the edges (like in the picture). My tart didn't look like the picture, by the way. The filling in the picture is much more opaque than mine was. Mine was still really pretty, just in a different way. I'm not sure if maybe mine looked different because I did something wrong, though. Anyway, my aunt and I thought that this was fabulous, and that the olive oil gives it a little depth and an added something that you can't quite put your finger on. My Dad and my boyfriend knew that there was something unusual about the tart, but they would have preferred something more traditional and straightforward. My uncle had to go to bed early, so when he ate it the next night, he called to tell me that he was calling me from beyond the grave because he had died and gone to heaven. To say that he was raving would be an understatement. So overall, I think that this is a very impressive dessert, but don't serve it to people with simple tastes or unsophisticated palates. I gave it 4 forks, and I rarely give anything 4 forks. Another bonus is that this tart was VERY quick and easy as far as desserts go. I would really recommend trying it.
