Why does it say chestnuts are cooked in salt pork, but there is no salt pork in the recipe? Are we missing some steps? It's an intriguing recipe, but I'm afraid to try it when it's not complete.

Perhaps the relative complexity and expense of this dish could be explained by the supplying chef, Alain Ducasse, assuming this same Michelin-starred Frenchman of Loius 15th repute.

How the hell would anyone know about this recipe? After glancing through the extremely daunting ingredients and preparation, it says "4 servings" !!!!!! Yeah, right. A cook in Maryland with less than 7 hours available to make a vegetable dish for 4!!!!!
