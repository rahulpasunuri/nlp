This was great! Because some reviews said the dish could be a bit bland, I opted to marinate the fish in salt, sherry, and garlic (+/- 1 hr). The steaming method was perfect - seven minutes was perfect. I used tilapia as Red Snapper isn't available here for a few more months yet, and it was beautiful.

I had never steamed fish before, but this recipe was easy to prepare. The blends of ginger, chilies and scallion was truly wonderful (not to mention the sesame oil, which is GOOD for you!). I used cod for the fish because I don't enjoy the red snapper we get here in CT (unlike what you can get in the south or the Caribbean!) The white fish worked very nicely in my opinion. I am not a big fish eater, but this recipe has changed my mind!

We found it rather bland. It took longer to steam than indicated (about twice as long)and the fish was just barely done.

I was expecting more from this, due to the great reviews. My husband liked it, though, so I'll make it again and see what I can do to make it better for me. I liked the cooking method--the fish was done perfectly. The flavors were just too subtle. I like the idea of adding ingredients to the cooking water.

As others noted, this was indeed very easy to prepare, and very good, too. It was much tastier than we'd anticipated. The skin of the fish seemed to melt right away, and didn't need to be discarded. I used a double bamboo steamer, set in a 12-inch skiller. In each compartment I put one fillet in a china dish. I added some sliced ginger and sherry to the skillet water. The fish was done in about 8 minutes. I'll definitely use this method for other mild white fish, such as tilapia and basa, as well as for red snapper. Note: my package of snapper weighed just 12 ounces (cooking for two), but I believe I used nearly the full amount of the other ingredients.

Red Snapper is not one of our favorites. This was great though! I used frozen snapper plus i used a bowl instead of a plate in the steamer. water condensed on the lid and fell into the bowl effectively boiling the snapper. woops. so, the fish got slightly overcooked. nonetheless, the flavors married most excellently with the fish. will definitely retry this one with fresh fish and plate in the steamer.

This is a quicky and tasty dish. I was particularily short on time so I used thawed fillets, ground (refrigerated) ginger and pepper flackes. . .it was still great with theses moderations. Black sesame seeds added to the top created a nice presentation, and tasted good too.

AMAZING. i added a soy-ginger sauce and served over buckwheat noodles--my boyfriend was highly impressed and deemed me best cook ever. I also marinated a little longer and topped with toasted sesame seeds

This was fantastic. I used the rack from my toaster oven and it worked perfectly. I substituted talapia, snapper is overfished, and it worked great. I served with sticky rice and dry stifried green beans. Seseme seeds sprinkled over everything for garnish.

This was such an easy and delicious dish! No proper steamer really necessary (see chopstick idea below). The flavors really compliment the fish so it is much tastier than your average steamed fish, but not at all overpowering. My only alteration was because I had no sherry -- I used bourbon instead, which gave a lovely sweet, smokey essence. Crushed red pepper flakes worked fine instead of the fresh serrano chiles. Yep, this recipe is a keeper for sure, one of my top 2 for snapper (see recipe on this site for snapper with thyme, tomatoes and olives for the other). I served it with steamed jasmine rice and steamed sugar snap peas with sesame oil. Yummy Steam Theme!

I don't have a cake rack or steamer basket that would fit in my skillet, but a few chopsticks thrown into the water will keep the plate off of the skillet bottom. Another nice addition was broccoli spears which I steamed for about 15 minutes before putting the fish in, then I draped them across the fish for the last few minutes to finish cooking (and to absorb some of the flavor). I absolutely loved this recipe, though I used skinless haddock instead of snapper, added a splash of soy sauce to the sherry, and finished with some toasted sesame seeds and served the whole thing over rice. Perfect.

This recipe is easy and is very similiar to the way that my mother would steam fish when I was growing up. I used a Chinese white cooking wine instead of the sherry and marinaded the fish for about 30 minutes in 1/4 c. wine, 1/4 soy and crushed slivers of ginger. I transfered the fish to the dish and put the remaining marinade in the water to steam the fish. Rather than adding the warmed soy and oil mixture to the fish before steaming, I added it right before serving. Delicious!

One of the simplest, most delicious preparations for fish. Delicious! Will add to my file. You should too.
