Made this for the grandkids and it came out wonerful...very tasty. Used my box grater so getting the peel off was easy. No bloods available so I used navel and added a tablespoon of Cointreau to lowere freezing point

add a little vodka ( I know it sounds crazy but,) an ounce or 2 it will lower the freezing point just a tad so it will stay soft in the freezer. You wont even taste or feel the vodka

I did not use blood oranges but that did not affect the great flavor of this recipe. I enjoyed the texture that the orange zest provided. However, after spending a day in the freezer the mixture became very hard. In the end I felt like I was eating shaved ice. I am not sure what I did to make that happen.

I loved the the flavors of this sorbet, rich, deep, bright. I added grand marnier (about a 1/4 cup) which helped with it not freezing too hard. It's a bit of work but well worth it, especially because you can make it a couple days ahead.

I'm lazy, so I only peeled and puréed a couple of oranges. I ran them through a chinois for good measure, and then juiced the rest. Threw in a lemon to help balance out the acid/sugar ratio. Fabulous, and what lovely color!

Excellent flavor, but this freezes so hard that it's better served as granita than sorbet.

I made this yesterday and omg was it good! It tasted way more complex than the three ingredients. Intense orange flavor with hints of berry. Will definitely make this again while blood oranges are in season.

I cheated! Couldn't find blood oranges. Used navel oranges and red food coloring. Worked just fine.

Made this sorbet lastnight for dinner with our parents. It was so easy to prepare the night before. I did not have a icecream maker, I made the recipe as directed and put the mixture into a stainless steel bowl with a lid and froze it over night removed it two hours before the dinner to thaw slightly and let it mix in the food processor for 10 minutes returned it to the stainless steel bowl and the freezer to be scooped out beautifully and just in time for dessert. Will definately be making this again.

Great sorbet, with a beautiful color. Had no problem with the zest, but would advise the previous reviewer to run the syrup through a sieve if her zest is too coarse. Very refreshing and easy to make -very nice for guests.

My guests really raved about this sorbet. They loved the consistancy/texture...something different from the usual. I substituted a couple tangelos, and one lime...to give it some zip! Will use this often...a big winner

I really liked the colour of this, and the flavour was very fresh tasting. The only thing I didn't care for was the little bits of zest, which messed up the texture and were yucky to chew. I'd still probably make it again, though, because blood oranges are only around for a little while, and this is a simple way to use them.

Whato a gorgeous color! This was a lovely dessert that got rave reviews from my guests - everyone asked for more AND the recipe. Plus it's easy to make and makes a simple but elegant statement. A definite thumbs' up.
