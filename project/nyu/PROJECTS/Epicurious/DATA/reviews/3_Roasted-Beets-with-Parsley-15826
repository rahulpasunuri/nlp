Beets are so beautiful to work with and fresh beets will change anyones mind about them. I liked this recipe because it was so simple and a gorgeous side dish!

i am not a beet fan, but my wife is an she thought these were the best beets she's munched. maybe cilantro instead of the parsley; and i thought the amount of butter kinda greasy. but it simple and good and i'll never ever boila beet again.
