This a great, healthy, easy meal. I used a little more oil, doubled the garlic and oregano, left out the tomatoes, and put in just a little bit of parmesan cheese.

Quick and good. Of course, I had to use what I had on hand: broccoli, shrimp, carrots, roasted peppers, onion, garlic, s/d tomato, canned diced tomato, herbs. I think I got 'em all. I'm eating it right now and enjoying it!

Good for what it is--a super healthy dish. Nothing for guests, but it's simple and pretty quick. (I used whole wheat pasta and asparagus, instead of broccoli, since that's what I had.)

I skipped the sundried tomatos for a few and threw in carrots instead. Loved It

I am not a picky eater - but I threw this entire meal away! The flavor was just plain bad. I was mad I wasted all the ingredients and would NEVER make this recipe again. My sun dried tomatoes had a raisin-like texture and taste, so maybe I used the wrong ones. Aside from that I followed it exactly.

Very tasty!!! This pasta has lots of flavor and is easy to make. I only cooked the penne for about ten minutes instead of twenty and sauteed everything while it was cooking. Will definately make it again.
