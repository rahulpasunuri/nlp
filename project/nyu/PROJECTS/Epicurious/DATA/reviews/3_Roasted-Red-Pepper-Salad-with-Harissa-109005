I made this for a dinner party, and the flavor was very good. Some guests were a little surprised by the spiciness. But, my harissa (I make it and keep it in a jar in the fridge.)is on the spicier side. I liked the contrasting texture of the walnuts and the peppers. The sweetness of the raisins offset the dressing nicely.
