Loved it, even as a cold salad in the middle of winter! Rich and savory, it counterbalances sharp pickled veggies against smoky charred beef. We used a strip, insanely thick and medium rare. Added more Worcestershire and passed chipotle Tabasco and A1 at the table. Grind some black pepper over the salad before serving and pass a small grinder so diners can season to taste. We didn't have a jar of gardiniere so we substituted pickled veggies we had on hand - carrots, beans, artichoke hearts, peppers and green tomatoes. Can't wait to do it again with hot steak right off the grill next summer! We're thinking of a variation with a cumin-rubbed ribeye and adding some corn relish, cilantro and pureed chipotle.
