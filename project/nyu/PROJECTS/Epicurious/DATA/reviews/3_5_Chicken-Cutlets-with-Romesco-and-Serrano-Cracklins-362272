I wanted to love it, but it was just ok. The sauce is delicious, but the chicken was quite bland.

A delicious, fresh chicken dish. The romesco is more like a spread than a sauce, thanks to the almonds that "hold" everything together. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I absolutely love romesco sauce, so I'm always happy to find a recipe that utilizes it. The chicken was okay, but not ideal. I should have listened to my intuition and baked the crumbs (with more than parsley - a shallot, Parmesan, perhaps); they were too soft and even with an egg wash they didn't stick evenly to the chicken. If I make this again I think I'll just bake the chicken on a rack (which helps to keep the breading crunchy). I also skipped the lettuce side, as I already had a veggie side, and the lettuce looked kinda blah. I roasted fresh peppers for the sauce and used pimenton.

Nice meal. You must eat the sauce with the chicken and Prosciutto (easier to find.) Otherwise nothing special. The chicken cutlet or paillard with the breadcrumbs and parsley lends itself to a host of ideas though.

This one is definitely going into the rotation. The sauce is terrific (I never heard of it before - saw it on an episode of 'Worst Cooks' and went looking and found this). I used prosciutto (easier to find). OK the chicken cutlets themselves are nothing special, but the combo of the chicken / sauteed ham (aka the bacon course) and romesco sauce is just fantastic. I think once I get it down will take about 30 min which is fine for a weeknight.

Rave reviews from family of 7. Used spinach instead of butter lettuce and tasted great!

The sauce is amazing! I made the chicken for 2 but made the entire sauce. It was great the next day on a baguette, on steamed broccoli and just by the spoonful. Tasty, healthy and quick - the perfect weekday recipe.

Yum. I used veal rather then chicken because that is what I had. It was delicious. My "straving" 16 year old had three helpings.

I can't find my way around the kitchen to save my life, but I managed to put this one together and my wife thought it was gourmet. She was about floored. Wonderfully delicious and healthy little meal.
