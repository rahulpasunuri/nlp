My husband said this was the best french toast he's ever had! I used a dash of vanilla for flavoring and it was awesome!

Easy and the very best!!! I served these at a 90th birthday brunch to an approving family!! Making ahead and keeping them warm worked well. Finding the buttermilk and challah bread ended up being the hardest part but they still came out fine. I used vinegar in regular milk and substituted another dense bread. A real treat!

This recipe is delicious. Next time I may try adding a tiny bit of vanilla to give it a bit more sweetness. I served it with powdered sugar and honey. http://www.naheedence.com

Very tasty recipe. Loved the taste and texture from the custard mixture soak. Was a bit worried about cutting the challah so thin (I'm used to thicker french toast), but it turned out perfect. Next time I may try adding a little cinnamon and vanilla to the custard to deepen the flavors a bit.

We didn't have any Challah, so I made this with our terribly healthy bread... amazing! Another one for the family recipe book!

Amazing! My husband always orders French toast when we are out, and he said that this is the best he has ever had. Couldn't find challah bread so I had to use French loaf, but the tangy sweet taste was just perfect. Made a mascarpone topping to go with that was lovely. 4oz mascarpone, 3 Tbsp honey, squeeze of lemon, definitely recommend.

This may very well be the best french toast I've ever made. Buttermilk is definitely the key to this perfectly rich and tangy recipe. I dusted mine with a little powdered sugar and served them with bacon and berries. Perfection!

This was an excellent french toast recipe and a great use up for some leftover buttermilk I had from making biscuits and gravy. Read all about my brunch experiences on my blog: http://winemeariver.wordpress.com/
