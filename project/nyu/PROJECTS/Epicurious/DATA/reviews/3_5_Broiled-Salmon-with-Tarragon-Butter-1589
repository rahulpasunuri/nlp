So good, so easy, and so fast. What's not to like? Maybe because I was aware of how much butter I'd prepared, it seemed a little rich...but I'd make it again, maybe go a little easier on the butter. The salmon tasted fantastic!

I love this recipe! After reading the reviews, I preheated the oven, then turned on the broiler and placed the salmon mid-height in the oven. Left it in for 12 minutes and it was perfect!

My all-time favorite salmon recipe. I make it at least once a month. Sometimes I stick it in a 375 degree oven instead of broiling it. When I do so, I sprinkle the tarragon on first, then dot with butter, and roast it.

Made this for company last night and had clean plates all around. I served the salmon over mashed potatoes, very easy and delicious!

This was so easy to make, I will definitely be making this regularly. Will make more of sauce with tarragon for drizzling over couscous.

Simple, fast and oh-so delicious. The butter lends a beautiful color to the salmon under the broiler making this dish a feast for the eyes. While the flavor of the salmon comes across rich and flaky smooth. A definite winner in my book.

OK. So this recipe was good. Not great, but good. I do plan on making it again, but not often. I'm still on the hunt for a better salmon recipe.

After basting with the lemon-butter and pepper, I baked 1 lb of salmon fillet at 375 for 20 min and it was perfect.

Found a great line-caught salmon that was perfect in this recipe. The sauce complemented the great flavor of the fish, but didn't hide it. Reminded me of eating salmon as a kid, before the prevalence of bland tasting, farm raised fish.

Very tasty, quick, and it looked pretty served with asparagus. Unfortunately, it caused a quite a bit of smoking even though the salmon did not burn. It must have been the butter under the high heat of the broiler. Next time, I might try baking at a medium-high heat rather than broiling. (Or else just live with yanking open a window..?)

I don't know if the problem is with my broiler, but I almost burned my salmon - had to transfer to the oven and finish baking at 375. It was very tasty, though. Next time, I'll double the sauce and bake in the oven the entire time.

Am I crazy, or does the ingredient list leave out tarragon?

Made this dish for my boyfriend, and we both loved it. Simple and delicious. I used half the butter and it still came out wonderful.

Great...i went a little light on the butter and added a little more lemon juice. Serve with asparagus and rice! Also, I used Artic Char instead of Salmon.

Delicious and simple for a family dinner or casual company affair. Broiled fish makes for a nice presentation, too.

This is excellent! The lemon gives is a nice yin & yang. I did sprinkle on some Mrs. Dash extra-spicy and it give it a little more pizazz!
