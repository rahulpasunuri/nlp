OK... I made this and Duck Liver Pate for new years this year. I did not have the terrine pan that you spend a fortune on at Sur la Table or WS, so I use three small (mini) loaf pans... I use the dried porcini but there was very little available so I also used fresh Chantarelle with the Shitake and oyster 'shrooms. I used almond slivers that were blanched for the top and the substance of the terrine. WOW! This was a HUGE hit. I made so much and I had three loaves, so I served one New Years Eve, one New Years Day, and as an experiment I froze the third and used it for a cocktail party last night... FANTASTIC! When I froze it, I wrapped it in parchment and then plastic wrap... no freezer burn and the flavor was restored and almost enhanced as I let it thaw in the fridge over 1.5 days. I remade the topping for the third round. My 9 and 12 year-old cant get enough of it, and one the guests wanted to know where I bought it. This is a keeper.

I would probably give it one more fork. I made this for my wine dinner for m favorite 5 wine divas. It got raves from the male supporters and requests from everyone for the recipe. One is even going to make this for Xmas dinner - to show off her cordon bleu cook sister. the only thing different I did wasfor the topping blanch the almonds, slice them and then saute them with parsley and thinly sliced crimini instead of the shitake and oyster for the topping. Gave it a meatier feel

The best pate ever. I have been making it for years and everyone loves it.

Sensational! A smash hit last Christmas, and will be featured again this year. I substituted Chantrelles for Siitakes because the Chantrelles were great last year, but I'm sure it would be fine with either. Parsley in topping is a must to avoid the brown on brown look. I disagree with the wine pairings at bottom of page. This dish cries out for Pinot Noir / red French Burgundy.

I didn't find this as time consuming or as expensive as everyone said. I made the stock a vegetable stock & added 2 cloves and some coriander seed to the broth. It added a very meaty taste especially when reduced this much. I served it with Watercress and arugula salad with a light lemon-soy dressing, cornichons & garlic crostini for a special Valentines day appetizer-it was spectacular!!

This is an absolutely incredible mushroom pate for a special occasion. It will take you seemingly forever to make it and your kitchen will be a mess (oh, and your wallet may be a little lighter) but it's entirely worth it. Gets better in the fridge so make it a day or two ahead of time.

Definitely a dish beyond compare, a testament to the wonderful chefs at Gourmet and a reminder of what we will miss with the demise of Gourmet. The dish has it all--superb technique and excellent flavor. This dish is complicated and time consuming as others have stated, but it presents beautifully and is wonderful for a party. I also halved the recipe and it turned out just fine. I didn't change the cooking time, but next time, I think I'll cut off 10 minutes--I think it may come out a bit silkier if I did.

Used canned mushrooms and regular button mushrooms and still wonderful

This recipe was simply gorgeous! It is somewhat labor intensive, time consuming and not for the faint of heart. BUT when looking to stun or impress at a dinner party this will get you many a golf claps.

This dish is unbelievably good. All my guests have raved about it. It does take time, and is expensive, but it makes a lot. The topping definitely adds to the looks of the dish, and adds an additional texture. The topping does not take much time to prepare, so I would really recommend not skipping that part.

We really loved this. Expensive but WORTH IT. It was maybe a little on the salty side--we used table salt as instructed. Next time I would cut to 1.5 tsp or maybe even 1 tsp.

This is a great recipe, we loved it! We made it for Christmas dinner in which each guest brought a special dish. The pate garnered raves from a number of guests. In fact, my brother, who is a professional chef, kept the leftover portion secret so he wouldn't have to share! The recipe does produce a prodigious amount, half would be plenty for a party of 15 or 20 people. But keep in mind that it is time consuming to prepare, and does freeze well. We couldn't get the oyster mushrooms on short notice so we added more shiitakes, baby porcini (aka crimini) and some dried morels. The result was fabulous.

I bejeweled it all with lots of pomegranate seeds. It was very pretty for a party last Christmas! Vegetarians friends and those watching their diets loved it... everyone did! So glad to have found it again!!

This is a great appetizer -- a little complicated to make but well worth the effort. I halved the recipe and we still had half of it left after a party for ten people. If you print out the recipe on three by five cards, be sure not to confuse page 3 and page 5, which have very similar first steps (saute shallots and mushrooms) -- sounds silly but I did exactly that. The pate was sumptuous nonetheless!

I couldn't find dried porcini, so substituted a wild mushroom blend. Also substituted black trumpet for the oyster mushrooms. The pâté turned out great and was worth the considerable effort.

It was very time consuming. I did like it and made it according to the original amount and its a lot of pate! The taste was a bit bland.

I halved the recipe and it made enough for 7 adults to enjoy as an appetizer with leftovers. I didn't have oyster mushrooms so I doubled the porcini amount. I didn't make the mushroom topping either, but it was still truly delicious. Very complex flavors and perfect with little toasts. I will definitely keep this recipe as a festive appetizer.

I tried this recipe last weekend, cut in half as advised by previous reviewers. They raved! This was awsome. I have been testing recipies for a small artists reception that I am arranging. This one will definitely be on it!

Brought this to a wine dinner where many high-end wines were served. And coincidently many of the dishes that evening contained exotic mushrooms. The dish was a great success! It wasn't too difficult to make just a bit time consuming. update: I normally only make half a recipe, and sometimes that's too much. But wrap well in plastic and foil -- it freezes beautifully!

I have made this recipe on a number of occasions for formal events. It is always a hit. I have chosen to increase the amount of salt in pate by another teaspoon. My favorite way to serve this pate is with toasted garlic and chive sourdough baguettes. It does make a large quantity.

This is a great recipe! Little expensive to make and time consuming to prepare, but worth it. It does make a large quantity, so I agree about cutting it in half. Didn't make the topping, but will next time.

I thought that this was wonderful! It does make a lot of pate, but I plan on eating the leftovers in the days to come! It was time consuming to make, but the end result was divine! I did not make the topping, and just served it without it. Also..the dried porcinis are key to this dish, as the broth used to hydrate them is the base of the entire dish.

I was really looking forward to adding this dish to my holiday buffet this year to complement liver pate. The recipe looked wonderful with a great ingredient list, but the end product was tremendously disappointing. I'll stick to the same ole veggie terrine for now...(BTW, if you decide to make this, I agree with the cook who advised halving it -- it makes a whole lot, and is very rich.)

A very nice and light pate. I ran short on the oyster and shiitake mushrooms and added crimini. I also served this sliced on a bed of baby greens with a balsamic dressing and everyone loved it.

Truly a wonderful dish, however it was too much pate for the small crowd that I prepared it for. The texture is lighter than meat pates yet very refreshing. I am always looking for great vegetarian recipes ( I used vegtable broth in lieu of the chx stock). The sauteed mushroom base was so good, I could not resist nibbling! I will serve it as a vegetarian alternative to my congnac/current chicken pate at christmas this year!

Ho-hum. Certainly not worth the time or expense it took to make this dish, I was so disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly, and I know that some people really like this - to each their own, I guess! I won't make it again.

Got rave reviews at a recent burgundy tasting. Substituted baby portabellos for the oyster mushrooms. I chopped the mushrooms rather than slicing to make spreading the pate a little easier. Also, since I was transporting the dish, I eliminated the topping. Not as lovely to behold, but again, may have made spreading a little easier and neater.

I still have the ripped-out pages from Gourmet where I found this recipe the first time... they're covered in fingerprints and little bits of parsley, etc. because I've made this so often. It is truly a slice of heaven. Very rich, very satisfying, and your friends will be deeply impressed. I make this every year for the holidays and have given out the recipe many times.

This was a hit at a dinner party we had. I used walnuts instead of the almonds and served it alongside a basket with slices of fresh bread.

we really LIKED this recipe alot! i only had 1/2 ounce of dried porcini and supplemented the other mshrooms in the recipe with about 1# of button mushrooms. there is a slight typo in this--when you put the pate into the oven to bake, there is supposed to be water in the baking dish to reach about half-way up the sides of the terrine. my husband LOVED it! next time i will double the amount of porcini to increase that woodsy flavor.

This recipe was truely awful! I spent so much time making the darn thing, it looked impressive enough for all my party guests to try it, but myself and everyone else hated it. I am a pate lover, but this was bad!

I was unable to use porcini mushrooms. I know the flavor of porcini is distinct and would have made it taste different. I substituted Portobello. But is was a great recipe and perfect for a party. The extra parsley, almonds, and mushroom topping makes for a beautiful presentation. Experiment with all types of mushrooms!!! This one is a keeper.
