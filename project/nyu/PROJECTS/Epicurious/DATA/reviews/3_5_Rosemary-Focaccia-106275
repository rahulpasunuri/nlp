I don't know what BKeller did to botch his/her's up, but I followed this recipe to the T and it came out very nice. The only addition I made to it was I crushed up some sichuan peppercorns and dashed it over the top.

Other reviewers, please stop rating recipes highly if you had to significantly change it to make it work. This recipe SUCKS as written.

If the very nice woman I met at Woodman's in Kenosha ever reads this, I just want to say thank you again for the conversation, and for the focaccia reference and the epicurious reference. Today's batch of baguettes are just out of the oven, now off to taste. Tomorrow's batch will use King Arthur bread flour instead of Dakota Maid. Bon appetite!

I think this recipe is bland as is. So two stars for the recipe as it is given. I followed previous reviewers' recommended flour adjustments, which I think was a good idea, and baked at 475 F. The second time I tried it, I added about a 1.5 tablespoons of chopped fresh rosemary to the dough itself. I used a little less salt. When it was time to spread the rosemary oil on the surface of the dough, I sprinkled generous quantities of chopped rosemary and several cloves worth of sliced garlic. On top of that I added about 5 tablespoons grated romano and parmigiano reggiano and adjusted the salt on top to accommodate for the saltiness of the cheese. I think I would add more cheese next time, but otherwise, it was infinitely better with the garlic on top and the robust cheese flavor. I will make it again only according to my adjustments.

Awesome focaccia!!! Made the modifications noted by others: Used 4 cups flour (instead of 5); baked at 500 for first 6 minutes, then at 475; heated the 3 Tblsp olive oil, added chopped rosemary, and allowed it to cool. I actually cheated and used the dough cycle in my bread machine to do the kneading and it turned out fantastic!

Great recipe! Light, airy, so easy and delicious. I'm an experienced home bread baker and this is a perfect recipe.

This is great! I replaced the 5 cups of all-purpose flour with 4 cups of bread flour. Also, instead of big loaves I rounded out 6 mini-loaves and put them in sandwich bags and in the freezer. They may great sandwich bread and perfect individual loaves for a family dinner.

This recipe is excellent, I have made it several times with perfect results! I use Rapid Rise yeast and combine all ingredients (no need to proof this yeast. I begin w/4 cups flour and add the 1.5 tsp salt to dough) and stir, then knead. I do first rise, punch it down, do second rise in fridge overnight. I handle the dough as little as possible and cook this on my pizza stone. I make the oil the night before, too--heat oil with crushed garlic and fresh rosemary springs, allow it to cool and sit overnight. THIS IS REALLY GOOD BREAD!!!

I followed the advice of other users and added rosemary to my EVOO before adding it to the dough. I also started with 4 cups of flour, and ended up using about 4 3/4 cups. I also put a shallow pan of water in the bottom of my oven before adding the bread. I also heated my oven to 500 and baked the bread for 6 minutes before turning the oven down to 475 for the rest of the baking time. And to the other users who said the recipe lacked salt, if you read the directions carefully, the recipe DOES call for salt.

This was delicious, and I followed the tips of others below. I started with 4 cups of flour (used bread flour because that's what I had), and ended up using 4 1/2 cups. I mixed the flour, water, and yeast first and let sit as a pre-ferment for about 15 minutes, then added rest of ingredients and started kneading with dough scraper, finishing by hand. Make sure you don't miss the salt added to dough that is missing from recipe list. Also added some dried rosemary to the dough, plus fresh on top. Baked at a higher temperature and it was done in 20-25 minutes. It was slightly firm on outside but tore easily, and inside was a light texture with some chewiness!

excellent! per other readers' advice, i made the following changes with much success: added 4 cups of flour, then added the last cup a quarter at a time-- ended up using only 4 1/4 cup; baked the bread at 500F for 5-10 min, then at 475F until golden brown and beautiful. this bread was WONDERFUL with oven roasted tomatoes, and a goat/sheep/cow's milk cheese. i will make this many times over the winter.

I was disappointed by this recipe. The bread came out very dry. The center was much too dense and crummy as some others mentioned. I should have been tipped off when the dough was too dry coming out of the blender.

This was excellent. I used a baking stone and it made the focaccia crispy on the outside. I will definitely make this again.

Over the summer I went to Italy and to the place where Focaccia was first made. ALL the locals there recommended one bakery for the best, most authentic focaccia. So, my family and I visited that shop. We were so surprised that the focaccia at that bakery tasted like and had the exact same texture as this recipe makes. Now, this focaccia always remindes me of Italy. This focaccia tastes like heaven!!!

My first review is below. I talked to my friend who is an instructor at NECI and she said the heat this recipe calls for is to low. She told me to bake at 500 for about 5 minutes, then lower heat to 475. The result was a lighter, less dense, less crummy focaccia!

My first time making yeasted bread with my new kitchen aid. Was disappointed in the texture of the bread - it was dry and "crummy" (for lack of a better word), but you couldn't beat the ease of making it! I will try the recipe again just to compare and tweak but at this point, only 2 forks.

This was easy and delicious! I made it with my 14 year old son for a school project, and it was hard to resist eating it all before he had to bring it to school! I used both sage and rosemary and mixed it into the dough. Also, in response to the reviews that said the dough was too dry, I used 1 3/4 cups of water and the result was perfect! Will definitely make this again, maybe adding some cheese and/or garlic to the dough.

I'm with the cook from Winston-Salem. Very disappointing; dry, didn't rise much, denser than expected. My ususal focaccia (made many times with great success) is from The Bread Bible (I tried this one because it was quicker), and the difference is that this dough was not very wet, as I understand a focaccia dough should be. Lacked the airy, soft, chewy, texture I love in a focaccia.

Rating: 3
I was hoping for a focaccia that was a bit thicker and softer; the crust was good, but has a crunch to it. The interior was nice and soft, without much chewiness, though. I used 4 C King Arthur unbleached bread flour, and added another 1/2 C, but probably shouldn't have; the dough was not sticky at all. I added slivered garlic to the EVOO baste, also some thinly sliced tomatoes and coarsely shredded Parmigiano Reggiano, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. It was excellent with some leftover pesto as well. I'll try it again, but any suggestions for softer crusts? Maybe after a night in a plastic bag it will soften up.

Made this receipe for friends at Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I doubled the receipe and let the rosemary sit in the olive oil while the bread was rising to give it a good flavor. Very easy to make and will definately make again.

I must've done something wrong. My husband and I agreed that it was a little boring (I did add the salt to the dough). The outside was tough/hard, the inside dense vs. chewy. I'll try another recipe and see if I can do better.

I have experimented with this recipe several times. I like it best with only four cups of BREAD flour, using the dough hook to knead because it is way too moist. It makes incredibly chewy, irresistable focaccia. I bake in a humid climate (90%) so perhaps my results are different.

This was my first time making focaccia, so I don't have anything to compare it against, but I think it turned out great and is delicious. It goes great with wine and cheese. It took about 40 minutes to cook on my pizza stone rather than the 20 to 25 minutes stated in the recipe. I would definately make this again, and I agree with other reviewers below that it would make a great pizza crust.

Rating: 4
To those who said this is bland and needs salt, for some reason salt isn't listed in the ingredients, but there are 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt in the dough. You need to read the directions carefully. This the excellet focaccia. It is the easiest and quickest I have ever made. It is wonderful for sandwiches.

Rating: 2
I thought this recipe lacked the texture of real focaccia bread. It was more dense than your typical foccacia. Also, I agree with another reviewer who said it needed more salt in the recipe, in addition to more rosemary. My boyfriend, who is the clueless wonder about food, stated it tasted like "the best pizza dough I've ever had." Great except, well, it's not pizza!

i have trouble getting active dry yeast to work so i used 1 7/8 tsp of rapid rise yeast instead. i mixed the yeast in with the flour first and then mixed in the wet ingredients (water at 70-90 degrees) and continued as directed. It came out wonderfully. I couldn't get my family to stop eating it.

i have now made this recipe for over a year and i have added chopped rosemary and garlic to the dough. whenever i et invited for dinner i am always asked to bring this along. it is delish! and easy =- also the dough keeps in the fridge aftr the initial rise which i always do overnight in the fridge.

Delicious and pretty easy. Watch the ingredients, however. The initial list leaves out extra salt, etc.

I make this for all my BBQ's, and people just can't get enough. I like to thinly slice red onion, and sometimes use fresh herbs to make this. I strongly recomend this recipe!

This was an "okay" recipe; definitely not the best. I really liked the method of kneeding the dough in a standing mixer (this was the very first time I used my dough hook and it won't be the last!) However, I found the bread to be bland - it REALLY needs some salt IN the dough and I think extra rosemary is called for on top. Also the bread's rise was just so-so. I'll move on to other recipes, but again I did like the kneeding method of this recipe.

I actually used this dough recipe to make panini loaves and it was great. A classic olive-y dough that rose beautifully.

This was easy to make, and turned out very well. It received many compliments at a potluck. I did not use a mixer, but simply stirred the ingredients with a heavy spoon until combined, then kneaded the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, as indicated in traditional bread recipes. This worked well. I did not have fresh rosemary, so I crushed some dried rosemary into near-powder consistency, and mixed it in with the oil before brushing on. This gave the bread a light rosemary flavour, though I'm sure fresh rosemary is best. Also added parmesan cheese five minutes before the end of the baking cycle, which tasted great, but much of it fell off when I cut the bread. A great recipe, foolproof even for first-time yeast bread makers.

This bread was very good. i put it in a dough cycle in my bread machine and it came out crisp yet soft on the inside. it just needs a little more rosemary flavor (i am a big rosemary lover). defintely one to try

Easy and tasty! I tried stirring 1/2 Tablespoon of black pepper into the dough instead of putting rosemary on top, and that worked, too.

This was great!! I've never even liked focaccia until this! As others have said, the texture is wonderful. The rosemary wasn't too much and I am not a rosemary lover. I loved the salt too! This was my first attempt and I will look no farther for a great recipe!!!

Delicious and fast recipe! I have made a few focaccia recipes but this was by far the best. Can't wait to experiment with other toppings.

This focaccia was awsome, I've made it serval times and its always gone the same day. Try adding two cloves of pressed garlic to the dough and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top during the last 5 minutes of baking and it think it adds a lot.

This was so good! The texture was perfect. Next time I will use less sea salt on top though, we were brushing it off but it still tasted incrediable! I'm going to use this recipe as a base and try it with different toppings. I can't wait to serve it to company.

Made this bread for guests & everyone loved it. Reduced the salt in the dough to 1 1/2 tsp., & with the added salt in the topping, it was plenty. Tried to use my baking stone, & found that after final rising, the dough was getting awfully close to the edges, & oil was starting to drip. Transferred to a ridged baking sheet & all was well! Next time will double the rosemary.

This recipe was quite easy with amazing results. I added sun dried tomatoes as well but they burned so next time I'll add them towards the end of the baking time.

This recipe is exquisite. I made it with some of the 15 year-old kids on a swim team that I coach, and even they could handle it. The final product was delicious, though I would reccomend a little less than the suggested amount of salt. A new staple in my recipe box.

So easy and absolutely delicious. This is a wonderful bread to start with if you're not used to working with yeast doughs.

This is an excellent recipe. Every time I make it, it is really good. The stand mixer with dough hook makes it much easier. I also use this dough (minus the rosemary, sea salt, and additional oil) for pizzas and it is also wonderful.

I have always wanted to try to make focaccia, and after reading all the other focaccia recipe reviews on this site, I am glad I chose this one. My husband called it "the best focaccia ever". I substituted walnut oil for the olive oil and used less. I also doubled the rosemary.

Well, I haven't made the recipe yet, but it sounds good and will soon. I agree that this is a valuable site to have and always enjoy "free" features. I do however, highlight the recipe before I print and choose to print only the selection (highlighted part) and the ads don't print out. Enjoy!!! and thanks for the reviews!

When I make foccacia I usually make it free-form on a baking stone - nice and rustic looking. I would suggest two things: 1) cover lightly w/waxed paper instead of a towel, which sometimes tends to stick, and 2) add rosemary, chopped garlic and salt (or whatever else you like) for just the last 5 minutes so it doesn't get too crunchy and dried out. Leftovers (if there are any) are great for sandwiches. I do the mixing and initial rise in my bread machine.

I actually contacted TUMS via email 2 weeks ago and got a response back. I recommend contacting them as well, as they have an interest in knowing whether their ads infuriate potential customers.

This is very easy to make and very good. I soaked some sundried tomatoes and garlic slices in the olive oil with the rosemary, then sprinkled the garlic and tomatoes over the bread after basting it with the rosemary/garlic-infused olive oil. This is definitely a "keeper".

The second time I made it I used bread machine flour and had much better results. I added sliced tomatoes and onions as toppings and every one loved it.

This is the third recipe I've tried recently for Focaccia and most certainly the best. The first two were a grave disappointment, but not this one. It gave me exactly what I was looking for, a nice thick, slightly chewy slice of bread, perfect for dipping in the cioppino or just olive oil. I will make this again and again, with many different topping.

Rating: 4
An excellent side with pasta or the cioppino it was featured with (in the March 2002 issue). Very easy. A suggestion for next time: I think the crust would be better if it were baked directly on a pizza stone rather than in a pan.
