The making of the recipe wasn't hard at all. It was simple to pull together. It was the taste and texture that my husband and I were disappointed about, this being our first recipe from here. Maybe the potatoes weren't mashed long enough, but the potatoes weren't as smooth as I believe they are supposed to be. Usually with potatoes it's no problem, but this time it was. My husband also remarked that the orange taste was a bit overwhelming, which I agree with. For what I ended up with, I'd give no stars, but might possibly try it at a later date, just modified a bit.
