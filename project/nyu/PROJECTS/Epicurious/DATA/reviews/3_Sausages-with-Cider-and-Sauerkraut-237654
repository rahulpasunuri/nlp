Quick and easy. I, too, used apple juice (1 cup), plus 3/4 cup cider vinegar. We enjoyed the sweetness, but I imagine that using stock for a more savory version would work well, too.

I actually used hot dogs with this recipe (not a sausage fan), and it came out perfectly. I also didn't rinse the sauerkraut. A little sweet, but I like the flavor from the caraway seeds. Definitely a keeper!

I thought that this was really tasty and very quick and easy to prepare. DO NOT RINSE the sauerkraut, just drain it well. I also substituted plain apple juice instead of cider. Next fall, when it's readily available, I'll probably try it with apple cider. Served it with pierogis for "Polish Night"!

Get good sauerkraut and don't rinse it (Bubbie's brand from Whole Foods is excellent). The recipe doesn't mention salting, but mine definitely needed some salt to finish it out.

We thought this was very good. I didn't have apple cider, so used apple juice. Also, I only had 1 cup of apple juice, so used chicken stock for the remainder. This was a good move, because dish was just a bit sweet. Not too much, but I'm afraid using 1 3/4 cups apple juice would have been too much. Dish was extremely easy to prepare.

I probably should not rate this recipe because I did not prepare it. That said, I do make a similar recipe, handed down by my German Oma (grandmother), for our Christmas Eve dinner. However, I do not rinse the sauerkraut, simply drain it. Instead of cider I use a combination of hearty chicken stock and white wine. Also, I slice the brats into bite size pieces before adding it back into the sauerkraut. Dump it all into a baking dish, top with shredded swiss cheese and chopped parsley..pop it into a 350 oven just long enough to melt the cheese. This has become a tradition my children (young adults) have come to look forward to; try this version and maybe you will too.

Surprisingly poor recipe for such a normally reliable site. If you drain and rinse sauerkraut and replace the liquid with apple cider and sugar, what you get is bland, unappetising, and tasteless.
