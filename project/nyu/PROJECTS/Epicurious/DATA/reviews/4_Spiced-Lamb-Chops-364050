Really simple and really good. The spice mixture has a nice kick to it. definitely company worthy. I did not do the mint or onions.

This recipe was outstanding. It was my first time preparing lamb, and it was PERFECT. I used greek yogurt. My broiler didn't really brown the lamb as much as I'd prefered, but aside from that, the temperature was perfect, and the flavor was incredible!
