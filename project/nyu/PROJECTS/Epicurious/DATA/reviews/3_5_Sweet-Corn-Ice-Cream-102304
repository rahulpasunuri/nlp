delicious! i only used 4 yolks instead of 9 (most other recipes on the web only use 4-5 yolks). i loved this recipe's method of pureeing the corn and letting it steep for an hour. pure corn flavor! served it with a quick fresh bluberry sauce, yum!

Ick! This was way too eggy. I loved the flavor of the corn/milk/cream after it had steeped, but when I added the eggs and froze it, it just tasted heavy and too sweet. I'm going to try it again using the corn/milk/cream liquid but use ratios of egg:liquid from ice cream recipes I like.

This ice cream came out great - fluffy and delicious. I infused 4 cups of half-and-half with 3 corn cobs cut into pieces after using the kernels for something else. The corn flavor is still very intense. I also used only 4 egg yolks as that's all I had on hand. The ice cream is rich and smooth and lighter in calories with less than half the egg yolks. I am very happy with the results.

This was great! I served it with the blueberry pie with cornmeal crust recipe from this site. I will make this again.

The recipe worked perfectly...and turned out just what I expected. It's more of a thinking man's dessert...you aren't exactly tempted to gobble up the whole bowl. I also made dulce de leche to top it with, which helped a lot. Very corn-y. A novelty dessert.

This ice cream is fabulous and quite a surprise for dinner guests--ask them to guess the main ingredient! I used about 1/2 cup more sugar than the recipe calls for, and also added 2 tsp of vanilla. We've made it twice and it was a hit both times. It's very rich, so a small scoop per guest goes great with some light biscotti.
