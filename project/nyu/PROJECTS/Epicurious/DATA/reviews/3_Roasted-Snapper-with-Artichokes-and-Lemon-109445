I made this along with the Spring Vegetable Ragout (Gourmet April 2000), only I substituted fish broth for the chicken broth in that recipe. I then served the fish and artichokes on top of tjhe ragout all in a bowl. The flavors combined wonderfully and it was extremely satisfying--not to mention very spring- like. I'd like to serve this for a dinner party with various chopped herbs on the side so that people can choose their own (not everyone's a fan of tarragon). If I had ordered this in a restaurant I would return and order it again!

LOVE this recipe. I used one bag of frozen artichoke hearts (worked great) and served over basmati rice. Once also had to use dried tarragon and it was okay, though fresh is ideal.

I simplified this dish even more by using canned artichoke hearts and substituted lime for lemmon as I prefer lime with snapper. Turned out great.

Very easy -- especially roasting the fish -- nothing for it to stick to! I used lots of small artichokes (not baby ones), which meant not having to scrape out the choke -- much easier. I'll certainly use this method of preparing artichokes again.
