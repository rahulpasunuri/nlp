I am dutch, and I've never had a meal like this. Now, the better known Uitsmijter, that I understand and love. That is at least a great sandwich put together, not a couple of eggs cheese, and ham on a plate!! I ran charterboats with my husband for a few years in the CAribbean and renamed the Uitsmijter - Eggs Amsterdam - basically: use any sliced bread of your choice, top with mayo or marg/butter, leaf of lettuce, 2 slices of tomato, a few slices of cucumber, top with a slice or two of ham, and a fried or poaced egg or two. One of my grandmothers used to put a gerkin on the side. Dig in, its delicious. Like the English have their Bacon Boetie!!

I haven't tried but am wondering why a 'dutch' recipe is included under Scandinavian recipes on this site. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark and Americans are forever confusing Holland and all things Dutch with Denmark and or Scandinavia. Map, please. -American expat

This takes me back to the winter I stayed in Holland when I was 18. The breakfast was exactly like this at least 5 days a week. We loved it.
