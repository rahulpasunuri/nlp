I made this recipe as written and really liked it. Yes, the filling is a little bland, but that's what the sauce is for. I made two sauces -- this one plus another more basic soy dipping sauce -- and this one was the favorite.

Did not like dipping sauce; thought Dijon was too strong/out of place. Did not care for sesame seed texture in dumplings. Did spice dumpling mix up a lot per comments; still just ok. Won't make again.

I made these with chopped shrimp instead of crab, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. They were absolutely delicious and easy to make. I was quite proud of them! My only complaint is that the dipping sauce was a little too heavy on the mustard for my taste. Next time I make them, I'll halve it. Other than that, a total winner!

I made these last year for a holiday cocktail party and plan to make them again. They went like hotcakes, though I agree they can be somewhat bland. Instead of the cilantro suggestion, I think I may add fresh lemongrass (for flavor) and perhaps diced water chestnuts (for crunch). While the cilantro would definitely seem to add flavor based on prior reviews, I want to try keep with Asian flavors. Also, they really do freeze exceptionally well.

I started making this recipe a few years ago and have been requested to make it repeatedly ever since. It works well with all kinds of substitutions, but high-quality lump crab is the best, and the sauce is a must-have!

We thought this was very good. And, we liked the sauce. The pot stickers were tasty enough to stand on their own, but the sauce adds a nice something extra. There are many alternative sauces you could make to go with this, so don't skip this recipe on account of the sauce! These types of recipes are always a bit labor-intensive (I got tired), but the results are worth it. I found this recipe surprisingly rich, incidentally.

I thought this dish was just so-so. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the filling was bland and the sauce overpowering. If I make this again, I will try some of the other reviewer suggestions.

I made this on Friday night with the crab and again on Saturday night for a party with prawns! I can't wait to try it with wild mushrooms. sooooo good and sooooo easy and a big hit.

I made a few changes that really turned out well. I used dungenous crab meat, added the bottoms of 3 baby bok choy chopped finely (for crunch), three baby leeks chopped finely. I doubled the ginger, added soy sauce 1 tsp and sugar 1/4 tsp to the basic recipie. I left the rest as published. These turned out fantastic. We would definately do this again.

This was fabulous. I added chopped celery for crunch but kept the rest the same.

This recipe was so easy, I am making another big batch today to freeze. I am a college student, so insted of splurging on real crab I sub-ed some fake crab meat. Next time I may try shrimp as some have suggested. I am a vegetarian myself, but my husband made these dissappear! I did try the sauce, and it was great. They also froze well. I would reccommend this to anyone. For someone with limited time and money, it can be a real handy dish with a little tweaking.

Opps! I was going to add the cilantro as the reviewer below from Ohio suggested and forgot. Definitely needs this!

Waste of crabmeat. My husband loved it, but he eats anything. It only got two forks because the sauce is great but way too powerful for the crab. Maybe if you could marinate the crab in something for 24 hours.......? Or it needs another spice. I wasn't going to make it because of the other reviews about the blandness. Should have listened this time.

Loved this! One addition I made was adding Cilantro to the filling and it gave it more flavor that was a great contrast with the delicious sauce.

I've made this dish twice, used cooked shrimp the second time, equally good. I really loved it and so did my guests. It was great as is but I might add some sambal next time if I'm not feeding wimps :) A definite keeper.

Just made this dish as an appetizer for an Asian dinner.I found the filling bland and allthough the dipping sauce was very good, it overpowered the taste of the crab. Looking for a better recipe.

The dipping sauce is great. Without it, the potstickers lack a bit of flavor. Very easy to make. Rave reviews at my party.

I cooked up some halibut to use instead of crab (easier on the wallet), and these were super tasty! I like a tangier sauce, so I added mirin and rice vinegar, and used the sauce as a dressing for the salad on the side.

This is the BEST potsticker recipe! My boyfriend gets absolutely excited when I make it. We double the sauce and can't get enough of it!

This was a waste of good crabmeat. The sauce was okay, but also disappointing. After tasting the first batch, I tried to "save" the potstickers by adding cream cheese to the filling (to make them like a rangoon)...these still - for lack of a better word, sucked. If you want a FANTASTIC recipe for dumplings/potstickers - check out the one on Epicurious under 'Shrimp Dumplings' - Gourmet 1999.

More rave reviews from an appetizer club party we attended. I substituted shrimp for the crab and quadrupled the recipe (could have gotten away with doubling the recipe for the sauce -- it went a long way). They were the most popular item -- delicious, pretty and easy to make.

I subbed shrimp for the crab, following the instructions for the ingredients exactly, and they were sensational. I did however, cook the dumplings longer and used chicken broth instead of water. For those who might not be familiar with cooking potstckers, I start at quite high heat with a bit of unprocessed peanut oil (Chinese style) checking that they are browned on the bottom, and then add between 1/4 and 1/2 cup preheated broth and steam them covered. It's important to let the liquid cook off at the end. That's what give it the nice finish. To the person who burned them. It is important to keep an eye on them and to turn the heat to med/low for the steaming portion. Also good to use the preheated broth.

We substituted shrimp for the crab and these were a major hit. Worth the effort!

These were very easy to make. The filling didn't have much flavor though. I followed the cooking times exactly, however the pot stickers burned very badly on the bottom...so be careful. The sauce was great and definitely makes the recipe. I would make these again but change the seasoning of the crab.

This dish was not that hard and definitely a keeper. I left out the sesame seeds. Due to the many powerful flavors I used cheaper but true crab meat and the dish worked well. No question about this being four fork.

I made these last night for my cooking club. They were great! And so easy! The fresh crab meat was expensive so I am going to experiment with shrimp.

I really liked this recipe although I added much more ginger than was called for (read the ginger measurement as tablespoon instead of teaspoon... oops! That'll teach me to cook without my glasses). The extra ginger did not prove to be overpowering, however, and next time I think that I'll add more spice to the dish... perhaps some garlic and some form of hot peppers. Also, having an abundance of black sesame seeds, I used 2/3 black and 1/3 white (so I could toast them accurately); this has a neat effect after cooking since the dark seeds show through the dumpling skins.... very cool! Definitely will make this recipe again.

These were awesome!The potstickers were great, the sauce was superb! I tool these to a 4th of July potluck and received raves all night long! I will be sure to make then agian and again...I also love the ease of using the ready-made wrappers. It's a little bit of a cheat, but I would never have the time otherwise! I added more of all the spices. Worked great.

This is an unbelievable recipe!!! The dipping sauce is out of this world!!! I was amazed at how the egg white keeps the filling together and these don't fall apart!!! I have made them several times, and they are a huge hit each time. YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!!!

Big hit, just as previous reviewers found. We loved the fresh ginger in the crab mixture. Fyi, I had some filling leftover, refrigerated it, and made more potstickers the next day. Just as good if not better. But, watch out for excess liquid.

I brought these appetizers to a potluck dinner over the weekend. Everyone loved them! The dipping sauce was good, but because I like spice I'm thinking of adding some cayenne pepper to the filling next time. Also, I was worried about the potstickers becoming mushy during transport so I cooled them on ceramic plates before putting them in wax paper-lined Tupperware. They were fine. Very delicious.

I went to a New Years party where the host served these, I did not make them. They were one of the most delicious appys I have eaten! They disappeared as quickly as he put them out. My friend made them with shrimp instead of crab meat. He told me he did not "review" it so lets just say I'm reviewing it for him. He said it took awhile to prepare but this was his 2nd attempt and it was quicker than his first. The dipping sauce was equally delicious. I am looking forward to making them myself!

I brought 60 of these to a potluck cocktail party and they dissappeared first and fast! I modified the stuffing as one of the other reviewers suggested - using red bell pepper, a seeded jalapeno finely chopped, cilantro, green onion as I would for crab cakes. They were outstanding! i brought 2 dipping sauces - I doubled the sauce recipe and split it in half-then to one half the sauce I added dried habenaros, dried hot red peppers and some shriracha (rooster sauce) for a big kick! the hot sauce was unsurpassed! (I did label to make sure the 0 star crowd would not be jepordized). Both sauces got rave reviews- this is a keeper in my book! I was glad I beta tested the recipe with fresh Oregon shrimp meat the week before as I let the stuffed wontons sit in the refrigerator for the day before cooking and they got gooey. The were great tasting but not very pretty. Costco is a great source for the one pound cans of lump crab-its really a good value and yummy!

I made these for a pan-asian meal I was preparing for my boyfriend. SO GOOD. I would add some sort of vinegar to the dipping sauce, though, and maybe red hot pepper flakes for some spice.

I took a bunch of elements from many recipes... a crab ravioli, pork pot stickers and added them all together and it was wonderful. The dipping sauce here though IS key! Sauteed chopped up celery with the shallots. Added some sake, some soy, some crumbled cooked pancetta, GARLIC.. very amazing. Made them as an appetizer for a large party and people are still talking about them.

simple and pleasing. Everyone loves them. I have made them several times now, varying the ingredients slightly. I have to agree with others that it is really the dipping sauce that makes the dish as good as it is, but it is the ease of preparation and cooking that really tops it off.

This recipe is wonderful! Only took about 30 minutes to prepare, then a few extra minutes to cook. Don't add much salt to the crab mixture or the sesame seeds; the dipping sauce is plenty salty. We loved the tender won-ton wrappers and enjoyed them as a main course with salad and fresh summer farm corn.
