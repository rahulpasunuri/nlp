The relish made the dish for me! I would use it for chicken, marinated tofu. The Turkish inspired flavors are great on a hot summer's night.

Not the kind of salsa I want for my swordfish. I made a mango chutney for the dish and it was fab.

This was excellent and super easy. We will definitely use the cucumber-mint salsa with other dishes. The only change I made was to use white balsamic vinegar, because it's what I had on hand. Served it with the Braised Fingerling Potato Coins from this site that I tossed with a little arugula before serving. The whole combination was great.

Dice up an avocado and throw it in the salsa for a mix of textures and flavor.

The salsa is worth making for any other type of fish, and maybe chicken or meat as well.

This dish was excellent! The large swordfish steak I bought took a good deal longer to cook than the recipe called for - about 12-15 minutes total instead of 8. I used seasoned rice vinegar on the advice of other reviewers, and found it a little sweet. Next time, I'll leave out the sugar. Other than that, this dish was delicious!

Not as enthusiastic as the others. OK for a quick midweek supper. Maybe we are just not swordfish lovers.

What a great recipe! Quick, easy and my daughter LOVED it! That's quite a statement for a little girl whose favorite food is bologna. Will make this one again and again.

Great flavor. Used rice vinegar. Absolutely loved the salsa with the fish. Pickey eaters also loved it. Made it with your recipe for the grilled green beans, red onion and mint. Very good together.

Substituting seasoned rice vinegar for the white wine vinegar gave the salsa and extra "kick". This is a great summer entree.

This is a fabulous summer recipe. It takes moments to prepare, and the mint and cucumber goes so well with swordfish. A must try!!!
