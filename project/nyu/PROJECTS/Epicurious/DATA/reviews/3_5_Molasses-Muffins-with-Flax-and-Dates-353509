These muffins smell delicious, but they taste like sweetened cardboard. At least they are healthy? I would definitely recommend adding at least twice as much cinnamon and the other optional flavorings. I don't like dates, so I substituted some currants and toasted flax seeds, which worked well.

I made these as written and they are UGLY. But they are really tasty. I've been eating them with at little lemon curd on them. Great for breakfast on the go.

Many thanks to all the previous reviewers! I made several of the suggested changes/additions: added about 3/4 c pumpkin, doubled the orange zest & cinnamon, added 1/4 t cloves and 1/4 t allspice, and also added about 1 T grated fresh ginger. I also used two whole eggs instead of one, and substituted plain low-fat yogurt for the buttermilk. The muffins came out moist and delicious, and are still low-fat and high-fiber. Not rating the recipe since I didn't follow it as written, but will definitely be making the modified one again!

These are delicious for what they are. If you're looking for a muffin that's more like a cupcake, look elsewhere. I added all of the suggested additions (vanilla, orange zest, and cinnamon - 1 tsp. of that) plus a bit of chopped apple because I had some leftover, and my dates were Medjool dates, which I'm sure helped add to the sweetness (so soft! so sweet! so chewy and delicious!). I used half honey and half molasses because I didn't want to flavor to be overpowering. I used only one egg, but it was a duck egg and was quite large. I used the buttermilk substitute because I didn't have buttermilk (and in fact, I used 1/2 c. skim milk, 1/4 cup whole milk, and 1/4 cup heavy cream - again, it was what I had!). I used half whole wheat flour, as suggested. These were delicious and flavorful muffins, and while they are a tiny bit dry the second day, I still managed to eat up two of them for breakfast and eyed a third. They make great use of flax, and you could easily add other things to alter the recipe. Mmmm!

Healthy muffins that taste pretty healthy.. I added an extra egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger, and a heaping 1/4 cup oats. I also added some mini chocolate chips in a few of them so I could try to get my boyfriend to eat them. We'll see how that goes! I also sprinkled some sugar on top. I couldn't help myself; they kind of need it. Maybe next time I could add a few tablespoons of honey, some toasted chopped walnuts, and I like the idea of some pumpkin puree (when it's in season). Maybe prune puree instead? I think if this recipe is spiced up/ bulked up a little, it really isn't too bad.

I, predictably, didn't follow the recipe much. I added a 1/2 can of pumpkin puree for moisture, used the orange zest and vanilla as recommended, then used about a tablespoon of cinnamon, a tsp of allspice, 2 tsp of ground ginger, and a 1/2 tsp ancho chili powder for a little kick and interest. The muffins are delicious, but with all the revisions, I don't feel right giving it a fork rating.

These are not nice. I made these for a brunch we hosted, and I was ashamed of these little bricks. They are "very healthy tasting," according to one of my guests.

Changes: used all whole wheat flour, vanilla, cinnamon, added about 3/4 of a chopped apple and some almonds. Very good for not having any fat or sugar, and good texture with the extra ingredients. (Admittedly I found the dough a little more delicious more than the muffin)

Just made my second batch of these. LOVE this recipe. I used 100% whole spelt flour and added an extra egg. Used cinnamon & vanilla. So good, and no sugar. A good way to get the health benefits of molasses without that metal molasses taste. Awesome with a little bit of Nancy's cultured cream cheese!

Changes: Buttermilk - Soy milk Molasses - honey Added: cinnamon, orange zest, mashed old banana Procedure: Combined all wet ingredients. Combined all dry ingredients Combined all ingredients Overall - A nice healthy cupcake that can be easily adjusted to your tastes. Amazing for no sugar or butter!!! My Sugestion - Add some texture. Chopped apples, walnuts, oats sprinkled on top ... something, anything, it really needs it. Otherwise, it would have scored higher for me.

I made these this week. It was all I could do just to eat one. I'm not fond of molasses but my husband is so I used half honey and half molasses. I didn't have enough cinnamon so added some cloves. They were moist and very,very, good. I will make them again real soon.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with these muffins. I added 1 full tsp cinnamon, along with the suggested orange rind and vanilla and I think they need it. Without any sweeteners or added fat I didn't think the result would be edible but I wanted to try them and I'm glad I did; however, my 3 children were not so thrilled with them. If you don't like the taste of molasses these muffins are not for you, as that is the most prominent flavor in them.

We love these muffins. I have made them a few times now, playing with additions and trying to give them more moisture. The addition of a frozen banana works and I also use medjool dates which are really sweet, moist and yummy. A swipe of any jam or fruit spread works, too. With a vegan in the house these are a BIG hit.

I am looking for alternatives to cereal every morning and I came across this recipe. The muffins are quite good, especially for having no sugar and not butter. Just want I was looking for. I did add the vanilla and cinammon, although they could use more. Ginger sounds yummy! My only complaint is that mine turned out a bit dry. I've been cutting them in half and spreading a thin layer of preserves to add a bit of moisture. I love the figs, but I think I'll add some golden raisins as well next time. Also, I am thinking that dark cholocalate chips would be wonderful in these.

I tried this recipe to use up some buttermilk and was truly impressed. I was a little hesitant about how these would turn out when I realized there was no sugar in the recipe, but they were really good! We used quality dates from the farmer's market and I added the cinnamon and vanilla options. The neighbors all enjoyed them.

Instead of muffins I made this in a 9-inch pan, and OH MY GOSH -- SO GOOD! Added the orange, cinnamon and vanilla... yum. :D

These muffins are delicious! I also prefer things that are not too sweet. As an added bonus, they are a perfect snack during pregnancy, with all the molasses and flax seed. I also made them according to the directions.

Made it as specified. Added some dried figs which gave it a little crunchy texture. Not too sweet at all - just the way I like it.

Meh. I made these as directed, with vanilla, cinnamon, orange peel, 1/3 whole wheat flour and 2/3 unbleached white. The results were edible, nothing more, and almost comically unattractive to boot. So glad I didn't try out this recipe for company--these would be the wallflowers of any brunch buffet.

I was looking for a healthy breakfast idea for my two year old and these were a hit (he ate 2 of them!). I love that it is only sweetened with dates and molasses, yet it is still sweet enough to appeal to my toddler. I also love that it has flax seed and whole wheat. I made it with half whole wheat pastry flour and half white and the texture turned out great. I also added the optional cinnamon, orange peel and vanilla - all were a delicious addition.

These are great and so easy and healthy! I added about 1 cup of muesli to the recipe, but will add more next time as well as some ginger. Good idea. Also put the vanilla and cinnamon in. A must.

I am always looking for recipes like this one - healthy, low-fat recipes that use REAL ingredients and have good flavor and texture. I used egg whites, dry buttermilk, a whole teaspoon of cinnamon (an accident caused by trying this recipe before my first cup of coffee), as well as all the other flavorings. This recipe could stand up to even MORE spices I think, a little ginger and more orange zest would be delicious. The muffins have a similar texture to a bran muffin, but are less dense and the dates make them moist and lovely.
