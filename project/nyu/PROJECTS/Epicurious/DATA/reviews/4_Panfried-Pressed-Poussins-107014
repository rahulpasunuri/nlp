What's the recipe for the pancakes the bird is sitting on?

This was good and different-- with a little more practice and experimenting I think it could be great. I was expecting the skin to be crispier. Next time I will dry the hens more, cook only one in a pan, and flatten them with a meat tenderizer. The pan deglazing was divine-- I sauteed a little garlic and sage in the butter before adding the chicken broth.

This may be my default method of cooking cornish hens. Delicious.

Super. Do make the stock reduction as deglazing the pan from poussins that cooked for 30 minutes in butter imparts a heavenly flavor. On menus in Georgian restaurants, chicken tabak is always there. We are living in Moscow for 11 years now and adore Georgian cuisine. This is a very authentic Georgian dish.

I used cornish game hens that were about 1 3/4 lbs. each. They fit in a 12" skillet. I didn't do the deglazing sauce, but will next time as a little more moisture would be good. The chutney is excellent and enjoyable with the hens. Simple and really good.

Although you might be tempted to dress up this recipe, don't . . . if you are using real poussins. They have such a delicate and delicious flavor. On the other hand, if you are using a small chicken (butterflied) or Cornish game hens, you might want to add some seasonings or herbs. In any case, I use two bricks covered in heavy-duty foil, and then a second cast-iron skillet (in addition to the cooking skillet) to rest on top of the bricks. Really delicious!!

This was a very simple recipe that turned out delicious. I served with wild rice pancakes and baked pancetta brussel sprouts. What a fabulous meal!
