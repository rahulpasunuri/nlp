I am making these again...delicious! I used baby carrots from the farmer's market, dried orange peel and the balance of the ingredients as is.

Good but not exceptional. I had the same problem with the honey and orange juice burning on the pan. You need to put foil on the pan so you don't ruin it. The cooking times were too short. I took the carrots out after 10 minutes because of the burning and they were not tender enough.

The flavors were good, but the cooking time is definitely off. Next time I will allow 30-40 mins in the oven. The rest of my meal was done, so I had to stop at 25 mins. They were crunchy and barely cooked at all (I use an oven thermometer so I know my temp is accurate). But the flavors were really good.

I made it "as is". Delicious. But, the orange juice and then honey were burning onto the baking sheet. So next time I think I use a different baking pan. Because of the burning, I ended the baking time pre- maturely, so my husband thought they were too crunchy. But I am definitely going to make them again with baking pan changes.

Made just as written, except I actually split up the cooking time to make room for the main course in the oven. I did the foil- covered 10 minutes in advance and the final 10 minutes at higher heat later after my meatloaf came out of the oven and served immediately - this worked. Great comfort food side dish.

Quick & Easy. Took about 10 min. longer for glaze and cooked to our liking.

Fabulous! Used orange infused olive oil in place of the olive oil in the recipe. Either way, this is a great roasted carrot recipe.
