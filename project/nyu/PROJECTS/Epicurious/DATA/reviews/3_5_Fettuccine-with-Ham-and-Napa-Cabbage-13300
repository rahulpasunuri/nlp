I agree it needs either half he pasta or double everything else. No need to add the pasta water as there is plenty if liquid from the onion and cream. Don't forget the salt and pepper!

I have made this twice now and my family loves it. This time I had some yellow bell pepper that I needed to use up so I added it to the cabbage and onion mixture. Since I doubled all the veggies I used a pint of cream and it is perfect. I actually think it is better the next day. Oh I also did not use caraway seeds but added garlic and onion powder.

Good quick weeknight supper! As other reviewers mention, we did not see the need to thin the sauce. Also good with the addition of mushrooms!

this is amazing with trader joe's papardelle pasta. i skipped the caraway seed, but added about a cup of cooked frozen peas just before the cream. i've made it twice, and think it's best made with deli style shaved honey ham, chopped into one inch pieces. i don't know why it would need thinning with pasta water... the napa cabbage and onions break down and release a ton of liquid during cooking, so even with the cream, it is very light. affordable and very delicious!

There is nothing wrong with this recipe but there's nothing particularly right about it, either. I wouldn't make this again unless I found myself stuck with these ingredients. I didn't have a strong reaction one way or the other. And this is way, way more than two servings.

Very good and different! The only thing I changed was adding a garlic clove. Almost doubled as suggested the cabbage mixture.

Interesting combination -- I thought it might be too bland, and almost added parmesan. I'm glad I didn't -- it was perfect. I thought the pasta-mixture ratio was just fine, but it did need plenty of salt and pepper. Next time, I might increase cream to 1/2 cup, as another reviewer suggests.

I think this recipe would have been very good as written, but here are my changes. I added 1 tablespoon of butter to the oil; I added 1 tablespoon of white vermouth to the onion-cabbage mixture; a pinch of dill and paprika along with the caraway seeds; and I used bow tie pasta rather than fettuccine. The ham was leftover baked Smithfield ham. Also, I increased the cream to 1/2 cup. It was rich, but delicious. Next time, my dining partner wants me to try using chicken broth instead of cream! Plenty of salt and pepper are necessary, and the pasta cooking water will be needed to thin the sauce somewhat.

Very good. I'd double all ingredients other than pasta as the amount of stuff to pasta ratio was a bit low. Peas would be a good addition too. We did not have caraway seeds so we used some celery seed and dill. Very good.
