I made this for foodie friends and it was a hit. It's beautiful to serve and very delicious. Will make it again.

This was really good. All of the flavors melded together well. I also added prosciutto - which was yummy. The citrus flavor was nice and summery.

This is great! Didn't change a thing. Some of my guests did not like the olives so I may do two trays next time - one with and one without.

This was absolutely AMAZING!!! I was out of propane in my bbq, so I did the onions in the toaster oven, and they turned out just fine. Super easy to make, but it has an elegant taste. Your guests will be VERY impressed!

Was absolutely delicious, but I would go easier on the arugula next time.

I have been making this for summer grilling parties for years, and everyone always loves it. I have never omitted or changed anything from the original recipe. The picture of this dish on the website does not do it justice! It is a beautiful presentation with the grilled bread on a platter, arugula piled beside it, and goat cheese and olives in pretty containers on the side. Provide a spreader and tongs, and guests can assesmble as they wish! FABULOUS!

this was excellent and went over amazingly well at the dinner party i had. like others, i did not add orange peel to the cheese - there were enough other flavors going on. also, instead of grilling the onions, i carmelized them on the stove top, which provided a delicious sweetness in contrast the the olives and cheese. my dinner guests left with the recipe in hand.

Wonderful! I made this for my Book Club and everyone couldn't stop eating it. I omitted the olives and it was still great. My boyfriend loved it too. We ate the leftovers for two days and the flavors were still great.

I also marinated the onion for several hours before grilling. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

As what passes for a grocery store in my hometown did not have arugula, and as I wasn't feeling too creative, I was forced to make these without arugula. I'm glad I did. Although I love its flavor, the salty olives and onions were delicious with the goat's cheese and I didn't feel the arugula would have added too much. I marinated the onions for about an hour in the dressing and served the dressing as an additional dip. The only complaint I received was from the boyfriend, who said he could have done without the orange peel in the cheese. I thought it added a wonderful light touch to what might otherwise have been too rich. I definitely recommend making this dish. Served it with the Chicken Costa del Sol and the Rosemary/Lemon orzo recipes also on this site.

This dish is amazing. I forgot the grated orange peel but I don't think it mattered. Also, I turned this into a salad served with the grilled bread/cheese. I will make this again.

Wonderful. Next time I'll make them ahead, rewarm and add lettuce just before serving -- these are even more inhalable the day after.

We were treated to this scrumptious appetizer at the home of friends who never cease to amaze and delight us with their Bon Appetit recipes. We thoroughly enjoyed every single ingredient of this one--even the olives, which I usually dislike. I think I've made a new friend, named "Kalamata"! E' molto delizioso!

Wonderful variety of flavors. The only problem with this recipe....(1) people fought for the last one, (2) ate so many and were to full for dinner.

This was fabulous! I omitted the olives, and brushed the bread with olive oil and orange juice mixture. My guests raved about it. It was very simple to prepare, and visually stunning.

delicious for summer evenings - easy to make and assemble. grilled onions in orange juice were great.
