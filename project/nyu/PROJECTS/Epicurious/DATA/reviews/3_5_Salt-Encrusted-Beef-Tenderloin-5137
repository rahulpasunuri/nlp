Thought this was way too much effort for a medicore result. I cut the salt and increased the herbs are someone suggested but it was still very salty around the edges. My niece who can devour beef like no 9 year old you have seen barely touched it, and when I tasted her piece, it was inedible. Also, if anyone you are serving likes rare meat, be careful of your cooking time.

I have had this several times, my mother and 2 sisters have made it on different occasions. Absolutely melts in your mouth. Very important to let the beef rest to give it the flavor and tenderness.

This is a great special occasion recipe. I've made it for Christmas dinner now four or five times, and I've made it for my wife's birthday. And if you want an easy way to appear to be a Top Chef, this is the way to go. This recipe turns out perfectly cooked beef tenderloin roast EVERY time. I agree with some of the reviewers -- the recipe as written can make the beef a bit too salty. So tonight, I cut the amount of course salt to one cup, and used three cups of flour. I also doubled the minced assorted herbs both in the flour mixture and on the beef, and the roast was absolutely wonderful. Remember to make the dough a day ahead. And have fun!

Made this for Thanksgiving '04. Guests absolutely loved it! I would cut the salt by 1/4 cup or so when I make it again.

Fantastic dish! Use organic beef if you can, it makes all the difference in the world.

I made this for both Christmas and New Years. It got rave reviews both times. It comes out tender and flavorful. The only difficulty I have with the recipe is keeping the crust from falling off while waiting to cook. Make sure you line the cooking dish with foil - the "crust" is a PAIN to clean up!

The beef was delicious done this way except that it was a little too salty around the edges of the meat, so the next time I make it I will cut down on the amount of salt in the 'dough'

The dough was a little tricky, but the results were well worth the effort!

Wonderful!!! Read the recipe several times and didn't believe the meat would cook properly this way. Not only did the meat cook to perfection, but this method allowed plenty of time to visit with friends. It was wonderful!

The technique was new to me, but easy enough to execute. The meat was done to perfection, and the fresh herbs added a wonderful flavor. Cook this when you want to impress...

Absolutely fabulous! This has been a staple dinner party meal that garners rave reviews for the flavor of the meat!! My only suggestion is to make sure you make enough crust for the size of tenderloin you will be using. It pays to have extra!

My 2 sisters have prepared this and it is a big hit during the holiday and special occasions. It is one of the most delicious meat dishes I have ever had!

I made this roast for Easter one year and everyone enjoyed tremendously. However, I did add additional amounts of the herbs to the roast.

I really liked this as a base recipe. I added many more herbs to the crust, but what really was nice was cutting the tenderloin so that I could roll it up with a filling of wild mushrooms, sautéed onions, and roasted garlic. I then tied the rolled tenderloin and covered with the crust. I also made this with Pork tenderloin, rolling walnuts, dried cranberries, sautéed onions, and spices (garlic, rosemary, thyme, etc.) then tying it up and baking in the crust. Both methods were a huge hit and the presentation was stunning with the meat and filling swirled together.

What a disappointment. Alot of work with little real flavor.

My husband and I both enjoyed the tenderloin prepared this way. It would be great to serve at a dinner party because you can do all of the work before guests arrive. Just slice before serving.

I made this for my sons 20th birthday.It was a hit with the whole family.

I made this when it first came out in 1998 as a special Valentine's day dinner for my husband and now it has become a tradition. I have also fixed it for several very special occasions and it is excellent. Everyone raves about it. It is very easy but I watch the temperature as it does not take long to cook. I use all of the herbs in the recipe and they provide a great flavor.

I made this recipe with coarse, sea salt (kosher salt isn't available in Tokyo where I live, and besides, I don't know what it is anyway.) The meat was so incredibly salty, it almost ruined the dish. It was very tender and maybe I might make it again using about 1/4 the salt, or less. Be careful or you'll waste a nice piece of meat.

This was fabulous. Great flavor and very tender. I was concerned about taking it out of the oven too soon but it continued to cook another 30 degrees in the half hour it rested. Also, I used a 2 1/2lb. roast and there was plenty of dough to cover it. I will definitly make this again.
