Always gets raves from the guests. Also used a small smear of goat cheese on the bottom to help 'glue' the topping to the bread. I used a smoked salmon loin and diced all of the salmon and avocado pieces the same size (on the smaller side) so they wouldn't fall off. As another reviewer mentions, it goes wonderfully well with a lightly oaked Chardonnay. We used the Catena from Argentina. Try this!

This was awesome. The goat cheese is a must. I took it to a 5oth Birthday party and it was the first thing gone. I cheated just a little because of time by purchasing fresh mild salsa from the grocery store and adding the lime, jalapeno, basil and avocado. I used Panera Breads Asiago cheese demi bread. Yummmmm!

Great summer appetizer as others had commented. I skipped the jalapeno, but felt something was missing so would add it next time. As recommended, I spread goat cheese on the toast, and (more than) doubled the avocado. Quite tasty!

This is one of our absolute summer staples. We always pair it with a white burgundy or Cakebread's chardonnay (crisper and lower oak than most California chardonnays). We add a thin layer of goat cheese and omit the yellow bell pepper; we add in a bit of very finely chopped habanero instead.

Everyone loved these at the NFL playoff party. Since I didn't have time to toast the bread, I simply sliced a whole wheat baguette and spread each slice with soft goat cheese (Chavre'). The goat cheese took away some of the strong taste of the smoked salmon which worked well since most of the guests had never eaten smoked salmon before; excellent salsa; my Scottish husband says not to use too much as it will take away the taste of the salmon.

Perfect summer appetizer...so fresh and light. Took other reviewers advice and spread a mixture of goat cheese/cream cheese, topped with the salmon then salsa...outstanding!! Also used the whole avacado....used toasted party rye for the bread...Highly recommend....salsa EXCELLANT and could be used in so many ways...can't wait to do again!

i added a whole avacado as well and it was delicious. The only thing i thought was frustrating with this recipe was that the salmon and salsa fell off of the toast and was difficult to eat. But the taste is incredible.

I agree with a previous reviewer, a whole avocado is better than a half. After I plated the appetizer, it was GONE in a flash. No complaints - only compliments.

I agree - this recipe is a very nice summer appetizer. I doubled the avocado and added just a little more lime juice. I really like the look of the salsa for the variety of bright colors.

I made this a few times and my family really enjoys it. I like the salty smoked salmon with the fresh salsa on the crisp bread. Yummy!

Very tasty. I also spread goat cheese on the bruschetta before topping with the smoked salmon, and think that the goat cheese added a lot to the taste and texture.

This recipe is a definate keeper! Can't wait to use fresh tomatoes! Made it for an oyster lovin' group (our 15th annual "oysters anyway dinner. Everyone loved it. Quick and easy.

The salsa is outstanding, appearance degrades and flavor improves with age. Find a high gluten, rustic bread to pack a powerful crunch when toasted, while staying chewy. Used more avacado than recipe called for (double) and felt it was a good decision. Up the lime juice as well (double). The bruschettes stayed crisp into the next day, the smoked salmon acted as a barrier for the juices. This salsa would rock on Sea Bass, seared Salmon, Snapper , Shrimp.... you get the picture.

Wow. I loved this as an appetizer--it's light yet savory, leaving ample room for dinner. Didn't use the tomatoes, and it was still great.

Am I missing something? I just didn't think this was that great and certainly not worth the cost of smoked salmon...skip it.
