This dish was good, but not great. What would make it vastly improved? Garlic. Lots of garlic. I would put several cloves in the dressing before blending/processing, as well as another one or two in with the calamari while it's cooking. We added pasta in (my other half can't be satiated with veggies alone) and put a little feta on top, which I would highly recommend for just the salad version as well. All in all, a fun alternative to fish or chicken. Will try again!

Nice textures. Yummy for a "healthy" dish, but bland overall even though I used lemon basil and fresh tomatoes from my garden.The calamari do not absorb the sauce very well since you are not cooking them in it. Oh, and the beans in this combo gave us a tummy ache. Not fun! If I make this again I'd definitely use canned chickpeas instead.
