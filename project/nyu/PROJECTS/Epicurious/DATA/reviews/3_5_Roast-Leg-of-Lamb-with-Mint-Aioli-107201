The lamb on its own turned out incredibly, but I agree that the aioli was initially the wrong accompaniment. I made a few tweaks that made it work far better. First, I doubled the amount of mint. The garlic is very powerful and it took a lot of mint to cut through it. But even with double the mint it still wasn't enough. I remedied this by doing an experiment that really paid off. After I browned the lamb in my skillet, I threw the lamb in the oven and used the skillet to sautee and reduce all of the marinade remnants that were left to be discarded. I cooked this mixture in the canola oil on low for a while, until it was nice and caramelized, and then added it to the aioli. It completely did the trick! Instead of garlicky mayonaise with a hint of lime, it turned into a tangy, minty dipping sauce with a hint of garlic. Much better!

The aioli was a great complement to the lamb.

I really like this recipe - very easy and brings out the natural flavors of simple but delicious ingredients. Make sure to really distribute the garlic, thyme and rosemary throughout the meat. I also decided to forego the thin potato slices and opted for a bigger cut, which soaked up the juices and oil without getting soggy. I added a couple cut up carrots and celery stalks to roast - a nice balance of veggies. And finally, I upped the garlic on the greens and threw in a few chopped up mint leaves and feta cheese to steam...a little more of a mediterranean flair, and absolutely divine!

I may not be a great cook and I may not be very sophisticated, but I really liked this dish. Even the Aioli turned out great. The only thing I left out was the 2 tablespoons of warm water at the end (forgot). I really don't know what some people thought this dish was supposed to do, but I could taste the lamb and aioli. I thought that is what I was supposed to taste...

i only made the aioli to go with my own lamb recipe, and i should have heeded the warnings. it was lame. aioli is just the wrong thing to have with lamb, i guess. for a great leg of lamb, rub the roast with tons of roasted garlic, rosemary and kosher salt. roast at 450 until 130 degrees. this is so simple but its out of this world. all my friends and clients agree.

Hi I used a tied boneless leg of lamb and wished I had marinated it as many other recipes call for. The aioli, even with more lemon and mint was okay and I could see that it would be good on sandwiches and such, or as a dipping sauce with crudite, but with the roast it just didn't wow me. I did make it early in the day to let the flavors mellow. This is what went better with the roast: in the roasting pan with the meat I scattered some cut up peeled carrots and an onion. When I removed the meat from the pan, I also removed the veg. and poured off the fat (I have a fat separator pitcher). Then with the remaining meat juices, I reheated them and also deglazed the pan with some madeira wine, a tsp of dijon mustard, more s/p. THAT was good!

Over barbequed the lamb - still ok. The mint aoili was ok with hot lamb but killed Bordeau wine - maybe a South France or rustic red would be good. HOWEVER, the aioli only gets better overnight and is FANTASTIC with left over lamb sandwiches. Probably won't make the lamb again, or serve the aioli with it - but will serve the aioli with steamed asparagus, chicken salad, other veggies...

overall- a terrific recipe that i am sure a novice could handle.

We had this for our Gourmet Dinner club and it was FANTASTIC!! The hostess of the meal prepared it and said it was labor intensive but we all agreed the end product was well worth it!!! I have saved this to my recipe box and will definitely make it again and again.

Lamb was excellent. Aioli needed more lemon. Served it with a little red wine jus which balanced everything nicely.
