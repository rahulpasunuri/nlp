WOW! I made this for Easter and it was soooo good! I too made the dough into 6 biscuits instead of 4 and they were still a good sized dessert. This was so delicious and pretty easy...I will be making these again and again!

This recipe is a keeper. I made six biscuits instead of four as the recipes stated. Also, used a combo of blueberries and strawberries. It was delicious. I highly recommend this for your spring/summer entertaining!

The strawberries were very good with the fruit preserves - there was a perfect amount of "juice" after I let them sit. I cheated and put them on top of homestyle buttermilk biscuits from the freezer section at the grocery!

This recipe is so simple and it tastes great! My husband and family request this dish whenever strawberries come into season. Take the other reviewers advice and portion the biscuits smaller. Once they're loaded up you'll be hard pressed to finish one on your own. However, the leftovers are great toasted the next day with jam.

These are great! Based on other reviews, I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup in the strawberries and 1 Tb in the whipped cream -- turned out just sweet enough without overpowering the berries.

I debated giving this four forks -- it was really good! It was also very, very simple, and I liked the fact that it could be largely prepared in advance. I whipped the cream several hours in advance, and it was still great. Based on the reviews, I made six biscuits. When I took them out of the oven I thought they looked kind of small and, at first, I wished I'd followed the recipe and only made four. But, after they were loaded up with strawberries and whipped cream, I don't think I could have eaten a larger biscuit. I agree with others to maybe tone down the sugar in the berries a little bit. I skipped dusting the tops with powdered sugar and didn't miss it a bit. Overall, this was scrumptious!

Save plenty of room after dinner - these are HUGE and quite rich (but yummy enough that you'll polish off the last bite anyway). Handle the biscuit dough very, very gently. Best served fresh from the oven - they get a little chewy after sitting for several hours. I found both the strawberry mixture and the whipped cream a little sweet, so I would err on the side of less sugar and taste as you add.

This is a simple, very tasty recipe. The raspberry jam/preserves add a nice depth to the flavor of the strawberries.

The strawberries and whip cream came out wonderful. I had problems with the biscuits -- although the tester came out clean, once the biscuits were cooled and split, it was still gooey inside. I'm not sure what I did wrong. In the future, I'll stick with pound cake as the accompaniment.

I almost decided against making this recipe because it didn't sound fancy enough for my special occasion - but it is the taste that will be remembered and few things can top this!

Great! I made these for the 4th of July. I would recommend making 6 or 8 out of the dough (instead of 4) because they were HUGE!

I brought this dessert for a Canada Day dinner at my friends' house. We had three 1 1/2 year olds there to look after, so I had to gulp the shortcake down more quickly than I would have liked, but it was great! I made the recipe into 6 nice-sized biscuits and loaded them up with fresh berries (mixed with sugar and lemon juice) and whipped cream. Everyone loved it and one guest even jokingly asked if it would be rude to lick her plate!

I made this for a small dinner party Saturday evening - the best strawberry shortcake we've ever had!! Everyone just loved it. The biscuits were delicious (I made six vs four). Several reviewers said the biscuits were doughy, I didn't have any problem with them being doughy at all - just so good! Will definitely make this again & again.

Too easy of a recipe to pass up....we loved it and will make it again and again and again this summer.

I made this last night for my husband's 40th birthday. He had requested strawberry shortcake. I can't believe I almost made a poundcake instead of these biscuits. This recipe is very easy and turns out delicious! Everyone was full from dinner but there wasn't a crumb left on anyones dessert plate. I won't use another recipe. Also, the biscuits are so good they can be used for many other dishes. I am glad I doubled the biscuit portion of the recipe.

Made this last night and it was great. Made the dough for the biscuits before our company came over and kept it in the fridge, then baked them while clearing the table and making coffee. That way we got to enjoy them right from the oven. Very tender and soooo tasty! This will be my standard recipe from now on.

It's hard to go wrong with strawberry shortcake. This recipe comes out pretty sweet. Go light with the sugar at first and add to taste.

Biscuits are the best!
