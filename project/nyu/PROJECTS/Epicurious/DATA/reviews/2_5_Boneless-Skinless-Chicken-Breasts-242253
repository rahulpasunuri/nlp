First time I have actually cooked a Chicken Breast.. It was great.

I have to agree with the other reviewer. This doesn't really qualify as a recipe. This is just how to grill a chichken breast. The only thing it could do is help someone who's never grilled chicken, by giving them a clue on the timing. This is just add salt and pepper to taste. Salt & Pepper don't really even count as ingredients of a recipe, since you would put salt on anything you cook anyway. Doesn't even come out as a perfectly juciy and tasty grilled chicken. This has nothing to do with being a food snob, if I can make this wihtout any instructions, why would I need to go to a recipe site? As far as I'm concered this is not a recipe. There are no ingredients and no measurements for the ones listed as ingredients.

Despite the previous "review", this is an excellent recipe. A recipe is simple a guide for preparing food and that is what this is so try not to be too elitist and self centered. Many grill recipes are simple and basic, yet produce fantastic results, this one for example, grilled asparagus for another.

Are you kidding? This isn't a recipe - it's how to overcook very bland chicken on a grill. A monkey could do this, if very bored.
