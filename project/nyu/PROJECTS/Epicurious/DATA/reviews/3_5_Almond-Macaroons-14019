I cut the sugar in half as other reviewers suggested and skipped with the powdered sugar. Really process the mixture well and the dough is super easy to roll into balls.

Fantastic and easy recipe. I use whole almonds and follow the recipe. They are well received every time I serve them.

Along with many other reviewers, I recommend using half as much sugar (they still come out quite sweet!). As another reviewer wrote, it's faster if you use almond meal (available from stores like Trader Joe's). I also recommend adding about a tablespoon of ground flaxseed to up the health benefits (i.e. omega 3's and fiber), adding some orange zest, cooking them for 2 extra minutes, and using parchment paper (to make extra sure the bottoms don't stick to the paper, you might add a tiny bit of oil/cooking spray). These are fast and delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

Awesome! I used 1/2 the sugar as well, and my husband said they were too sweet. So, I'll cut back even more next time. I also used the lemon zest. Great idea! And, I took them out thinking they weren't done after 11 minutes, but they were brown on the bottom...just couldn't see it. :-)

These are quite good and very easy to make! Yum. We have made them both with blanched almonds and unblanched and both are good. We don't bother with the almond on top or the sugar on top. We also found that they were good with 1/2 the sugar. (they're good with the full amount too, we were just curious to see how healthy we could make them and still have them delicious :-) One last thing is that we liked them with almond extract but tend to use a bit of almond with a bit of vanilla - depends on how strong you want the almond taste I guess. Thanks for this delicious (easy) recipe!

I loved these when I lived in Boston and could get to the North End! I have looked for the perfect almond macaroon recipe. Now that I found it, I realize I am glad I did so late in life, otherwise I would have become addicted. I left the hulls on the nuts (more healthy) and added 1-2 drops of red food coloring, so they came out a pleasing color.

great cookies. very simple to make and great texture. I followed the recepie and the only thing I would change next time is the amount of sugar. My boyfriend felt that they were too sweet (and he loves desert).

really Yummy!! But very sweet. Next time, less sugar!

These were amazing! I didn't have blanched almonds and just used regular ones. I upped the baking time a bit to 12 minutes because they didn't seem to be turning color (never really did), and I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, though next time I'll probably only use 1/3 (very very sweet!). All in all, wonderful cookies with a wonderful texture, kind of a crispness to the outside and chewiness to the inside. Yum!

Make this one. I didn't blanch the almonds and didn't finish with the confectioners' sugar. No need to reduce the sugar like previous reviewers. My intention was to follow their lead but I accidentally put it all in. It was perfect. Of course it's sweet, it's a cookie! It makes sense to double the batch because it's so good and gets eaten quickly. I cooked mine a little longer because it wasn't getting golden. I don't think it needs to get golden to be "done" so follow the written cooking time. Otherwise your cookies will be a little firmer from overcooking.

Best. Cookies. Ever. Make this cookie! If you can get blanched or slivered almonds, this is falling-off-a-log easy, and so quick. Sadly, I couldn't get blanched almonds so I had to blanch my own, which were rather uncooperative. Three hours to do a cup of almonds, and about 10 minutes to do the rest of the prep work! But it was worth it, and I got rave reviews in spite of the stress.

I've been looking for a gluten-free cookie that's easy and tasty and this one was fabulous! It doesn't have any flour anyway, so it's naturally g-f. And the cookies are so sweet and tasty we ate the whole batch in about 15 minutes.

These were fantastic... I cooked them on greased parchment paper which made removing them from the cookie sheet incredibly easy. Also, just using almond meal is a good shortcut. Make them!

I followed the recipe exactly, and had some flat, tasty macaroons. The second time, I made these in mini-muffin cups and baked them for 15 minutes. AWESOME! So easy and so good. These are going to be a menu staple at my new tea room :)

These were great - nice and chewy. I followed the advice of one reviewer and turned the oven off after 7 mins and let them cool in the oven for another 6 mins. Also, I added the zest of 1/2 a lemon - that is key, I think. So Yummy!

these were easy, good for Passover and were yummy. I added 1/3 cup mini- chocolate chips.

These are great! 15 minutes from start to finish. I used 1/2 cup sugar as has been suggested (I used raw sugar) and I think you could still cut down more on the sugar. I also used raw almonds (not blanched) and did not grind them fine, so that there would be more texture. These go really well with green tea!

Excellent gluten-free, diary-free cookies. I used half the sugar (I used brown sugar) and omitted the almond extract from the recipe.

Turn the oven off after 7 minutes and let the cookies cool in there if you want a slightly chewier variety. That timing worked for us. Deelish!

A similar recipe, for those who might be interested: Make a basic meringue cookie recipe, add 1/2 tsp almond extract, and pipe the meringue onto toasted, sliced almonds so that the almonds bake into the bottom of the cookies. Drizzle chocolate on the top. SO good! These cookies were great, too. :)

These are such delicious and easy cookies. Like another reviewer said, they're perfect with sorbet or fruit. I use a Silpat when baking, which works well.

What a waste of ingredients! Yuck.

These are so delicious and simple to make. I like the fact that there are no butter or oil used. I only used 1/2 cup of suger and it's just right. I had some the next day and they are still moist and chewy! Yum!

So delicious. The perfect little cookie to accompany fruit or sorbet.

This is a truly simple and quick cookie. I think the next time I make these I'll use a bit less sugar as they were VERY sweet - without the extra powdered sugar! I tried dunking some of them in melted dark chocolate to cut the sweetness a bit. It didn't help the sweetness too much but was delicious! Just as a note: I used toasted almonds, because that's what I had at hand, but I do not think this improved the recipe and won't use them next time if I have a choice.

Very tasty and nice chewy texture, but I doubled the almond extract for full almond flavor. I thought they were quite sweet without added confectioners sugar, and the second time I made them I ground the almonds extra finely. The texture of the cookies turned out a little less grainy.

i used regular unblanched almonds & these were good. i would suggest putting them on parchment paper instead of a buttered pan, they come off much easier.

This recipe was wonderful. I followed the Cuisinart version and truly...I was done in 15 minutes. I think the problem others have had with the cookies spreading too much was that you need to make VERY COMPACT balls, pressing the dough together as you form the cookies. This holds them together when baking. Also, I doubled the recipe without any problem!

I have made these cookies many, many times and always get rave reviews! I use my Cuisinart and it takes me about 15 minutes total time to prepare AND bake. Careful not to overbake! Note: I find it helpful to have a glass of water to dip the spoon into, (not too wet!) to prevent spoon sticking to cookies when gently pressing them prior to adding the whole almond on top. (I have never had a problem with cookies running together. Are you using just the egg white?)

Great flavor, but the cookies were too thin and spread together, making them impossible to eat as cookies. We put the batches into a baggie and ate it like sweet granola. It also would work well as a crust or crumb topping,not not the right consistency for cookies
