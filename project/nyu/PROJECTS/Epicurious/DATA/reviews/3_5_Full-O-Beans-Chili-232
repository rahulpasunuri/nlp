LOVE this recipe! I make it all the time! Why does the recipe not show the protein in the nutritional info? Anyone know?

I have been making this since the 90s when I got it out of the magazine. I think it is really simple and kind of unique. I love the way the garbanzos and limas and other beans make this chili look. I don't understand what everyone has against lima beans either. I occasionally add a chopped jalepeno and I usually add some tomato paste to make it thick like I do all chili recipes. This is very healthy and a perfect dish to eat if you are dieting....or not.

This recipe was ideal for my detox diet. But to lower the sodium I used dried chick peas, kidney beans, red lentils(instead of black beans) and 3 fresh large tomatoes instead of canned. I skipped the lima beans. It was great! For the dried chickpeas and kidney beans, I soaked and cooked them halfway. The lentils I threw in dry and added a cup of water to help them cook.

This dish rocks. However, don't do as I did by adding soya beans; they just look like a load of M&Ms in your chili. Apart from that: cook it, eat it, wash the pan and repeat!!

I had this recipe a long time and finally tried it--it was outstanding and oh so easy. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of substituting canned limas for frozen ones. To extend it the next day I added a 6 oz. can of V-8 juice and then to extend it a day further, I added the cup of left over chili to a can of Campbell's Bean with Bacon Soup. Oh, it was good. All 3 ways were outstanding and very satisfying.

I added corn, chopped tomatoes instead of stewed, and another 4-5 garlic cloves. I skipped the lima beans altogether. I've received rave reviews.

Fantastic! Even my non-veggie fiance loved it. I substituted a can of pinto beans for the lima beans and added corn as well. It was great the first day and even better as leftovers! It is now my go-to chili recipe.

The only food left in our cupboard just so happened to be the ingredients in this recipe (minus the lima beans). Thanks for saving us from a "cereal for dinner" night. Now I'm off to the grocery store...

I have made this several times and it never fails to please. It's the perfect healthy week night dinner. I never add the lima beans (or corn), increase all of the spices and serve with non-fat greek yogurt, low fat cheese and fresh pico de gallo. Delicious!

This was good, but not great. After all the rave reviews, I had expected something much better. I followed the recipe, with the only substitution being the one recommended by practically everyone, switching the lima beans with corn. A lot of cans with a few spices. Good but not great.

This was fantastic. I also made some adjustments - added some sauteed onions, pinto beans, and a little beer. I simmered it for quite a bit longer than indicated. Next time, I will chop the tomatoes or used diced because they were a little too large in the end. Served with cornbread, it was delicious, and SOOO easy!

Simple, easy, good! This is a great recipe for those days where you run out of groceries, and dig up what you have in the pantry. We didn't add the lima beans for lack of having any, and forgot to add the vinegar at the end (it was still really good). We did add some carrots and ground beef...quite happy with the results.

Well, this is certainly one of the easiest recipes I have ever gotten off of epicurious.com! Also, a reasonably good chili recipe if you need a vegan version -- which I did.

This was such a fantastic weekday dish! Easy and delicious. I didn't have red kidney beans, so used white instead. I was skeptical during cooking, since there was so little liquid from the tomatoes, but it turned out perfectly in the end.

Was looking for a chili recipe that the boyfriend could be entrusted with to throw into the crockpot on short notice. This one turned out great! Added a diced onion, carrot, and a handful of frozen corn, and cut down the garlic a bit. I had him cut down a little on the chili, but it turned out that it wasn't at all spicy, so we ended up adding some chili sauce at the end. It was great! In the crockpot it didn't need any more liquid at all. As others have said, this recipe makes a great, reliable base.

I used this recipe merely as a backbone for the soup/chili, but it turned out beautifully and was so quick and easy to make! I sautéed 4 cloves of garlic (it was New Year's Eve and no one wants garlic breath when the clock strikes midnight!) in a saucepan and approx. a cup of chopped carrot, cup of chopped celery, and half a yellow onion diced. After about 3 min, I added the tomatoes and 3 cans of beans- black, garbanzo, and kidney (drained), 2 teaspoons of cumin, several shakes of 6-pepper blend, and about 8 jalapeno slivers and let that simmer on low for 30-45 min. Delicious, easy, cheap, filling, healthy, and complete with a spicy kick. Everything I could want in a dish on a winter night. You can't mess this up.

Made this for the first time and it is very good. This is definitely a keeper. Substituted canned butter beans for the frozen limas and diced tomatoes with green chilis for the stewed tomatoes.

This chili was quick and easy to make. It's also inexpensive and healthy. I already had all the ingredients in my pantry and didn't have to shop. It's also easily adaptable. Using different kinds of beans each time and substituting corn or other veggies for the lima beans makes it interesting. Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent chili! We use many different kinds of beans- kidney, garbanzo, chili, black, white, etc. Also lightly saute in olive oil 1 green bell pepper, 1 red bell pepper, and 1 onion with jalepenos before adding canned items. Very filling and easy!

For a fundraising lunch at work, we needed a vegetarian dish. So I made this for the first time. Well, the reviews were great. In fact, I won a bottle of wine for the best dish of the potluck lunch. And many people asked for the recipe. It's really worth a try. I substituted the lima beans for corn, since I don't like lima beans! But everything else was exactly the same.

I can't even remember how many times we have had this dish already. Lost track but enjoy it every times as if it was love at first sight. It is so easy to make and it won't break your budget. Whether you are a vegetarian or not, this dish deserves a permanent place in your recipe box. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

Love this recipe. It's become a mainstay in our house. It's cheap and flexible. I didn't have any lima beans and added a bag of extra sweet frozen corn instead. Delicious! My husband is a dedicated carnivore and but this is the chili he asks for. Not hot enough for us though. I usually add extra chili powder and dried hot peppers.

My father is unable to eat seeds. Can anyone tell me whether I can just used seeded fresh tomatoes and get the same affect?....or any other suggestions? Thank you.

Such a great, fast, cheap dish. Very delicious, if you follow the instructions. (Have no idea why a review below this had no liquid--that's what the stewed tomatoes provide, but whatever works for each person.) It's spicy, but not extremely hot, so I'm not sure what kind of chili the people who are complaining it is "too hot" are used to. I suspect canned chili! By the way, this recipe is extremely cheap and filling.

This was way too spicy, and I love spicy foods. It was practially inedible. Cut the chili powder by half, at least.

I added chopped carrots, freshly ground jalepeno pepper, excessive amounts of extra cumin and chili powder and extra vinegar, and this meal was still lacking. It was definitely eddible, but nothing that I'd be interested in spending any money or time making again.

I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it turned out to be. My guests loved it and were hassling me for the recipe for the whole party! I served it with brown rice. Delish! One change: to a double recipe I added one bottle of (good Canadian) beer and two chopped chipotle peppers (canned in a tomatoey sauce). And I cut back a bit on the cayenne as we had kids at the party. Also I didn't use Mexican tomatoes, just regular canned stewed tomatoes.

Rating: 3
This was awesome chili, but we made a lot of additions. We added a can of corn and some finely chopped serrano chilis along with the beans. There was almost no liquid, so we dumped in a bottle of beer. Finally, we chopped up a roasted chicken and added it right at the end. Served with sour cream and grated cheddar, it was delicious!

This was my first time ever to make chili! I was looking for a tangy, hearty vegetarian chili and this is it. Extremely easy to make. Per other reviewers, I added extra vinegar and I substituted black beans for the lima beans.

I found this to be an easy to make and great tasting recipe. I used diced canned tomatoes (couldn't find the Mexican ones). I added basil and dried ground chili. I substitued a can of mixed beans for the garbanzo beans. Took this to a barbecue this weekend and everyone wants the recipe!

1/5/02--This is a great recipe! I to could not find "Mexican-style stewed tomatoes". I added some chili powder and some dried cilantro. Other than that, I cooked this for way longer than indicated. In addition, I made this early in the day. I believe a stew or chili such as this needs time for all the flavors to blend. All together, I probably cooked this for 2 1/2 hours. It was excellent. My only problem was that the stewed tomatoes that I used did not break down. They had an annoying tendency to remain just about like they came out of the can. Next time I will puree some and chop some before adding to the chili. Also, I did not have enough liquid after draining and rinsing the canned beans. Added several cans of water. I will definitely make this again!

We love this recipe. Have used it to feed the masses at pumpkin carving parties the last 2 years. Since it's a hearty chili, it accommodates both the vegans and meat-lovers in the crowd. Yummm. When the crowds ranneth over, we presented the chili with Chicken Enchiladas and found both to be a hit.

I don't like cooking, but when I saw this recipe I just had to try it. It turned out to be really easy--and delicious!!! I substituted butter beans for lima beans (cos they were out of it at the store), 3 tsp. minced garlic from a jar I bought (cos I'm lazy), and added 1 lb. soy "burger crumbles". I added 2c more water, since I think I put too many butter beans in there and also because of the burger crumbles. I also added 1T more chili powder and probably 1 or 2t more cayenne, cos I love it hot! I definitely will try putting some corn in next time...and I need to remember to buy CHEDDAR CHEESE next time I'm at the grocery!!!

A good chilli, and very versatile for those of us who insist on adulterating recipes. I'm not overly keen on lima beans butI had a tin of hominy on hand, which worked very well. To Michael, why be so peevish simply because you're allergic to garlic? Just make your substitions and stop whining (by the by, I have food allergies too, but I don't feel the need to vent when I come across a recipe emplying them, I just proceed).

I made this recipe as it was and tasted it and WOW! It was wonderful! I am a big fan of beans anyway, but this is just fantastic. After tasting the chili, I did add some things, though, since I can't help myself from doing that! I added some beer (the chili needed a bit more liquid); a half a barbecued chicken, shredded (mmmm!); some more spice (since I like spicy foods); some leftover sliced black olives; some corn (in addition to -- not instead of -- the lima beans, which I substituted with very tiny baby limas); a half a large onion, diced; and a large pinch of each: dried marjoram, dried basil and dried oregano. This chili is just plain great, though, with or without the additions. I'll keep it in my files forever!

Take out the garlic. I am allergic to garlic. Substitutes do exist.

Wow- this was so easy! I was able to make it without having to go out to the store. I substituted tomato sauce for one can of stewed tomatoes, and the beans I used were black beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, and pink beans. It was extremely easy, and very tasty. And it tasted even better the next day!

I sauted an onion with the garlic, substituted a can of butter beans instead of the lima beans (because that's what I found in the closet), put one of the cans of tomatoes in the blender before adding it to the sauce (because one family member doesn't like tomatoes), and added a chopped up leftover roasted chicken thigh. I made it in the afternoon and let it sit until dinner time. The chicken was tender and shredded, and the flavors blended together well in that few hours. Excellent skiing recipe.

I doubled the first two ingredients, true-to-recipe on beans and tomatoes, no lima beans, 1 T cayenne pepper i/o chili powder, 1 T cumin, forgot the red wine vinegar, and served with cheddar cheese. Omnivores and vegetarians alike loved it, and all went back for seconds.

Will definitely make this one again. It's quick and easy and tastes great. I also substituted corn for the lima beans and served it with grated cheddar, low-fat sour cream, and chopped tomatoes. Instead of red wine vinegar I put out lime wedges. I served it with corn bread.

This was a wonderful recipe. I did make some substitutions, however, adding a large onion, sauteed at the beginning and subbing out the lima beans for pinto. In the future I might even add some chilies and peppers to the mix. What a great starting point for chili!

This is a super-tasting chili. I used an additional 8-oz. can of tomato sauce and simmered it a bit longer than half an hour. It was fantastic the next day, after the flavors really blended. I served it with a crunchy cole slaw and some corn bread, both of which complemented it nicely!

It's about time chefs used their talent to make vegetarian versions of favorite "regular" foods! I salute you. My vegetarian teenager just asked why chili couldn't be made without the meat. About the same time as she said that, I was overjoyed to fing Hormel has begun distributing a meatless version of their chili. Now I can make my own version and my daughter can learn to make this version of one of her former (pre-vegetarian)favorites. Thank you SO much!!!

I used a 16oz. bag of Lima beans as that's what I had on hand and I added one more can of tomatoes and an extra tablespoon of good chili powder. I also threw in 3 or 4 more garlic cloves My whole family loved it. It was easy and very flavorful. Great quick dinner!

This is a great midweek recipe. Real easy and healthy, almost everything out of a can. One comment: unless you really like HOT lay low on the cayenne pepper. My inexperience in the kitchen led me to add a little too much. An 1/4 tsp and I thought it was a bit too hot (wife loved it however).
