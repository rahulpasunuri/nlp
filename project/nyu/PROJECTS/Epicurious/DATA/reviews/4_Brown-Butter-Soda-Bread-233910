Really easy and delicious. Used spelt flour and dried rosemary and halfed the recipe. Fed four with leftovers.

I loved the flavor of this, but the measurements seemed off for me. The dough was way too sticky as written to be able to knead, so I kept adding flour a little at a time until I could handle it better. I think maybe I ended up working it too much, because it turned out a little dense and crumbly after cooling. The overall flavor was really good, though. I think I would try making this again, because it would be even better if the texture was not as dense. My hubby claims not to like rosemary, but he liked this. I loved the background flavor of herb and pepper. Definitely worth a try!

If I could rate this a 3.5, I would. I followed this recipe exactly. It was very easy, and the results were delicious. I agree with other reviewers that you should work the bread as little as possible.

This is my first bread baking experience and the first soda bread I've ever had and I must say it turned out pretty good. Like other reviews have said, it does have a biscuit-y texture to it so it's not really sandwich-type bread. I had to use dried rosemary since I didn't have any fresh on hand. I'm not sure if it makes a difference since this is my first time making this recipe, but the rosemary did make the bread mighty fragrant. Next time I'll probably lower the cooking time by about 5 minutes because the bottom of the loaves were a little tough. All in all a great recipe, nice and soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside. Great for corned beef and cabbage.

Out of many soda breads, this one flavored with brown butter, rosemary, and black pepper is exceptional. I did substitute 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour for color and fiber. Served it with marmalade and fig butter for a special breakfast.

Yum!!! Delicious! Tip: If you try substituting Greek yogurt for the buttermilk, you will have to mix the yogurt with milk to make it the proper liquidity and volume before adding to the recipe. I brushed with olive oil and ground black pepper prior to baking. Will definitely be making again.

I thought this bread was delicious and the amount of rosemary and black pepper was just right. It does have a biscuity texture as others have mentioned. Not sure I would try to make sandwiches with it but it would be great with soups and stews. Of course we have eaten a whole loaf by itself 30 minutes out of the oven. Defintely will make again.

To the cook from Finger Lakes Region, the recipe is not called "Irish Soda Bread", it's "Brown Butter Soda Bread", so it's rather obvious that it isn't going to be a traditional Irish soda bread since it contains butter. No deception afterall.

Great recipe, delicious bread but... The name is deceiving. It is not a traditional Irish soda bread. True soda bread only has 4 ingredients, flour, baking soda, buttermilk & salt.

Great recipe. Added juice and rind of 1 lemon to kick it up a notch. Perfect flavor combo.

Wow! After 20 years this is the first time I've tried a different soda bread recipe and it is a keeper. My cousin said it's better than any soda bread she's had in Ireland. (I do think that making your own buttermilk from whole milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar is best)

I made this last night using 1/2 recipe for 1 loaf and it was so delicious! I followed the recommendation to fold/knead it in the bowl and dump out onto baking sheet and was that easy! I was practicing for St. Patrick's Day dinner party. It'll be a hit for sure.

made this bread twice so far and the family loves it! I doubled the rosemary and the pepper{we love it spicy}. Going to modify this recipe and use Jalapeno, cheddar, oregano and celantro next time. The recipe makes one large loaf I two loaves are too small, just bake the loaf about 10 minutes longer. Also thinking of sundried tomato, basil and sauted pancetta

This was delicious! I'm not a fan of rosemary, so I used fresh sage instead. Works well with whole wheat, too. Yum!

Loved this bread! I left out the rosemary as I didn't have any and still loved it. I also made my own buttermilk using non-fat milk and lemon juice. Luckily it makes 2 loaves, otherwise I wouldn't get any because everyone eats it up so quickly.

Halved the recipe to get one loaf.. wish i hadn't. The bread was delicious and was gobbled up quickly. Made exactly as written - it makes a really nice tasty loaf of soda bread. I think it's better than the original kind, but I think that's cause I was forced to eat that every morning as a child while the other kids got nice white wonder bread. This bread, I don't think I would have complained about.

Really wonderful and simple bread to make. The black pepper and rosemary adds wonderful flavor - served this with a pork roast last nite, have made it previously with Irish stew. This most recent time I followed another reviewer's suggestion and didn't turn the dough out to knead, I just pressed it until formed in the bowl with a spatula, divided into two parts and plopped down on my baking sheet, then formed with the spatula to make two nicely rounded loafs. When I tried to knead the bread by hand the time before, I found the dough far too moist to work with, even with extra flour. Don't know how anyone would find this recipe dry, it's very tender and moist when baked, though I do agree that it has more of a biscuit texture than a standard yeast bread recipe.

This was so easy to make and very, very good. I followed the recipe exactly. I made it with an irish beef stew for St. Paddy's day, but think it would be great with a lot of different meals. It wasn't quite as good the next morning, so eat it all while it's warm.

Bake this bread! It is outstanding. I bake a number of different yeast breads, but this is so easy and quick. I put it together in no time at all. Have to admit I chose the recipe because the photo was so inviting. Well, the bread tastes as good as the photo looks. Cut the recipe in half for one loaf. Turned it out briefly on a floured surface, just enough to form a ball. Essentially followed the recipe exactly. Found it pretty light for a soda bread.

Fantastic! I halved the recipe for one loaf. By far the best soda bread I have had. I used lowfat buttermilk & I was generous with the rosemary & pepper. I did not knead it at all, just mixed with a fork, pulled into a ball in the bowl & dropped it on the pan. I used olive oil on the top, instead of egg. Next time I may add some whole wheat or oat bran for a more grainy loaf, or some grated cheese? This was so perfect & soft I'm not sure I can change a thing!

Like the previous reviewer, I made this bread to go with our St. Pat's day feast. We were not disappointed! I made some substitutions: margarine (yes, I know) instead of butter and didn't wait for it to brown-if it even does, 2% milk with 1 and 3/4 tsp. white vinegar added, didn't bother with the egg wash because the dough was quite wet and gloppy, sort of plopped the two lumps onto the baking sheet and ground black pepper and sea salt on top. I baked exactly as directed and they smelled great! You can really taste the rosemary and the pepper, it is wonderful. I bet the extra loaf will be good with a nice smoked red meat for sandwiches. This was easy to make and I will make it again next year for sure. Oh, also, I used dried rosemary.

This bread is awesome! It is easy to make, and tastes delicious. Everyone at our St. Patrick's Day dinner loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out beautifully. I wonder if people who thought it was too dry didn't measure the flour properly? We love it!

Rating: 3
i agree with ekcarr777 -- i think the trick for getting a loaf that is not dry or too dense is to not knead it much at all. i never knead more than 7 turns, if that. i will try your method of bringing it together in the bowl without kneading and see how it turns out!

i have made this bread on several occasions, and it has always been excellent.

I make this all the time. I can't get buttermilk and instead of making a substitute, I just use plain yogurt. Also, I don't knead it. I just bring the dough together in the bowl and gently form the loaves. It always comes out perfect and all my guests rave about it. Maybe not kneading helps keep it tender and moist?

Bread came out dry and dense, I think I should have added more butter milk or something. I think it was more human error, but it just seemed to dry from the moment I started needing it, and it wasn't sticky like some other reviews have said. I will give it another try at some point.

This is an exceptional recipe! I made this for a St. Patty Day dinner party and invited some Irish friends. They raved about the Brown Butter Soda Bread and we discussed the recipe for quite some time as we ate dinner. It took about 13 minutes to brown the butter. When I removed it from the heat, there was alot of crusty sediment. I used all the brown butter but not the sediment. The dough is very sticky when you go to knead. Be careful not to add too much flour. The flavor of this bread is fabulous and it has a rustic presentation. I toasted two pieces this morning and had it with butter and jelly. Deee-lish! This recipe is absolutely a keeper!

Followed exactly except did not throw out yolk- but tossed it into buttermilk and mixed in. Very tasty- and it IS great w/ butter & jam- but I found that leaving that off gave opportunity to appreciate the wonderful flavors of the bread itself...

Very simple to make and great flavor. I also kneaded the dough right in the bowl because it was so sticky - throw a little flour on top and roll it in the flour and then knead it a few times. It is best warm from the oven, but can be reheated in the microwave the next day. The two loaves are small, so you get about 4 good sized wedges out of each one.

Loved the crisp crust and tender crumb. In addition to cracked black pepper on top, I also added coarse salt, which made it extra good. I made it to go with the Corn Beef and Cabbage from the site, But we gobbled it up before dinner with butter and Apricot Pepper jelly. Wow! What a wonderful savory/sweet combination! Will be making again very soon. My 8yr. old son did most of the work and we had a great time making it together!

This was my first attempt at soda bread and I chose the recipe because it did not have the traditional raisins and/or caraway seeds (don't prefer). Though the dough was incredibly sticky which made it rather difficult to form into a ball, the end result turned out to be very moist with really delicious flavor. I did use regular buttermilk, rather than lowfat, and that may have made the difference. Will definitely make this again.

I wish I could give this recipe 3.5 forks. It was incredibly easy and it turned out perfect, delicious, great texture, perfect crispy crust with nice tender bread inside. This was my first batch of soda bread and I can't wait to make it again and tweak the herbs and flavorings. This bread vanished quickly.

I loved the flavor, but unfortunatly it was too dry. I had to add about another Tbsp of butter & 1/4 cup of buttermilk to dough. Also instead of egg wash, used olive oil instead ... complimented the rosemary and pepper.

I will make almost anything myself but I just can't be bothered to do yeasted breads. This bread was perfect for my purposes.

Delicious!

I made a huge error the first time I made this but didn't realize it until it was already in the oven. I was amazed that it still turned out and we all loved it! I accidentally doubled the amount of butter called for. I was in the middle of making 2 other dishes at the time and glanced at the recipe and read 1/4 lb butter. So the dough ended up being sticky and I had to really flour my hands and the board. It really turned out delicious though and am tempted to make it again this same way.

because of lactose issues I made this with margarine and soymilk (w/lemon juice) and it came out very good. I also added extra rosemary just because i like it so much. Also sprinkled kosher salt on top which was a good suggestion. We had this for dinner the first night, then then 2nd night I sliced it and used it for bruschetta - toasted, rubbed with garlic, and drizzled with EVOO and kosher salt toped with roasted tomatoes and mozzz - it was delicious!

Really nice bread, but it IS soda bread, so you can't expect it to be chewy and elastic at all. I made it once as the recipe is written and have been playing with it since. Most recent incarnation involves omiting the rosemary and instead sauteeing a bunch (like, a whole head) of garlic in the butter. Divine.

As previous reviewer, I used fake lemon-juice buttermilk (you can also use white vinegar in place of the lemon juice). Leave the mixture for 10 minutes and then stir, and you've got a buttermilk substitute. The bread itself is lighter than the other soda bread I've made. Very quick way to get a tasty loaf on the table. Forget about letting it cool for 30 minutes - maybe 5 or 10. Soda bread is best warm. Used about 1 tsp dried rosemary (no fresh around), skipped the glaze so it would go nicer with sweet toppings, and added a handful or so of saffron petals. You can avoid the floured surface; just knead the whole thing in the bowl, adding flour as needed, and then seperate into two rounds & flatten slightly right on the trays.

Excellent bread to make within an hour of dinner. Rave reviews each time I have made it. Had to use an old conversion of 1 TBSP lemon Juice in each cup of sweet milk in place of Buttermilk and still turned out great. Easy, plentiful bread without yeast! I also added kosher salt to the top of the bread.
