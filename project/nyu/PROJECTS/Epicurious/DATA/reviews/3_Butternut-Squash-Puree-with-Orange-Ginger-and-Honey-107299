For 15 people I doubled the recipe and had way too much squash. Next time I'll make just one batch. Also, I think I used too much ginger -- next time I'll go easy on the ginger and add a little bit less of the sauce flavoring into the squahs because it was a bit strong (but other people really liked it)

I thought the end product was fine (taste, texture, balance, etc.) but it was nothing special. There are better, similar recipes on Epicurious.

Yikes, this was not what I had hoped for. I can see why another reviewer said that someone who didn't like squash enjoyed this dish -- the orange flavor really overpowered the squash. I made this to bring to someone's house for Thanksgiving, and I was so disappointed with the result that at the last minute I went out and bought another squash, boiled it and added butter and brown sugar. The butternut squash comes out absolutely gorgeous when roasted as instructed at the beginning of this recipe -- don't ruin a nice squash by following the rest of it. If you are going to go out on a limb with this recipe, add the orange zest a tiny bit at a time to avoid ending up with an orange disaster.

My new favorite vegetable is butternut squash.I had no trouble scooping the pulp out of the skin.I used orange juice (because that is what I had) instead of concentrate.The spices were excellent,the texture was good.The bowl was emptied.

I am 18 and have made this squash for the past 3 Thanksgivings and definately will make again this year. For someone who doesn't like squash, this is awesome. Although I always have to get a brother or father to cut the squash for me, other than that it's really easy. I use real orange juice (no pulp) instead of concentrate living in Florida. Good compliment is SPICED CRANBERRY SAUCE WITH ZINFANDEL.

I didn't enjoy making this but guest raved about it, I agree with other review, the acorn puree is much better.

Made this thinking it might be soup-like after reading other reviews, but it was--funnily enough--a puree, and not a soup. Added apple cider and some cream to make it more liquidy. Quite nice.

For those of you who wanted something simpler, try the "Acorn Squash Puree" recipe on this site--it is out of this world (and unbelievably easy to make!). Happy eats!

Excellent side dish! Very easy to make & great flavor.

This was very easy and lighter than most winter soups. I cut back on the orange juice and zest a bit

I made this recipe mainly for my father and other adult guests, since I myself am not a large fan of squash. I decided to try it, since I put so much effort into making it (cutting and peeling's not easy) and I fell in love with the citrus flavor (being a Florida girl). This will be the third year I'm making it and my family is eager for an excellent squash dish!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit. For Christmas, I wasn't asked to make it, I WAS TOLD TO MAKE IT!

I made this for THanksgiving and everyone loved it! I saved time by buying pre-cut and peeled squash, and made it the day before. The kids had seconds. I'll definitely use this again.

I made this dish twice, the second time with a teenage niece and her friends. They loved it! My niece especially liked the orange and lemon peels. For the first time I made it, my friend who is not a butternut squash fan actually got a second helping. She said that this was "really big" for her. I thought the balance of the flavors were quite good, I didn't have any problems tasting the squash.

Well, everyone was surprised when the kids at the Thanksgiving table asked for more, until I told them that the kids' bowl was plain roasted and mashed squash with butter. Wish that's how I'd left it for the adults. The allspice was totally overpowering and the combination of all the other flavours just didn't do it for me.

I tried this recipe at Thanksgiving and it wasn't a success at all. The consistency was too mushy and you couldn't taste the squash flavor. I would have been better just cutting up the squash and serving that with a little butter and salt.

This recipe took a lot of time to prepare and just didn't go over well at Thanksgiving. It seemed dry and not worth the time to make. We won't be serving this one again.

Good, but I found the orange too strong. Next time I will cut back a bit.

I served this for thankgiving. I used a few mandarin oranges, that I had from a previous salad in place of the orange peel and 1 1/2 TBL of orange juice concentrate and honey. Excellent side dish for the holidays.

Way too much spice. You couldn't taste the squash at all.

An excellent side dish - used it for the first time for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Thing the orange is just right - may reduce the honey a bit- but otherwise excellent and easy!!

This is a delightful recipe with a smooth sweet taste. My only complaint is that the orange was a bit strong. Next time I make this I will be sure to taste as I go.
