You there, unsuspecting culinary adventurer, turn back before it's too late! Do not be fooled by this recipe's seemingly awesome conglomeration of ingredients! I spent two hours and almost 30 dollars on this and it wasn't even edible. I spent an inordinate amount of time cutting up that celery root into stupid matchsticks. I used those four pans and dirtied every single inch of my kitchen. I got olive oil in my ear. And in the end, my husband ate one bite and refused to eat another. And for some context: this man eats *ANYTHING* I make and tells me it's good. So what was the matter with it? The flavors were bland and the combo didn't go well. And whatever was I supposed to do with the lemons and onions and carrots that went into the pot to cook with the artichokes? Just throw them away? It's an expensive, wasteful mystery. Moreover, the artichokes smelled delicious when cooking (actually, everything by itself smelled kind of good). The whole was less than the sum of the parts. This recipe actually deserves negative forks, but apparently that's not an option. Sigh. I'm going to go down the rest of the bottle of wine I opened for this and try to forget this disaster.

This really was delicious, especially the dressing, in which the additon of toasted walnuts added an intriguing rich & smokey undertaste--I'd make just this again, for salads (hint--it needs a bit of salt). We only had 2 artichokes, so had to improvise. They needed more cooking time (confusing as to what a "large" one is--we had globe sized ones). We added leftover roasted chicken, which we wanted to use up. Beyond this the salad takes well to improvisation--it's a dull beige, so we added grape tomatoes & green olives for more color. Also subtituted scallions for onion, which seemed too strong. Even tastier on the next day.
