I found this easier than expected to make using the eggs, oil, etc. The consistency was good. Only problem was, I used anchovy paste & obviously used too much--even a small amount. The end result was inedible. I do question the need for the anchovy. Anyhow, a word to anyone with similar ideas.

Only made the aioli to try out my new whisk. This is very simple and very yummy. I added an extra teaspoon of lemon juice, a teaspoon of finely minced capers, and a pinch of salt to make up for the anchovies (didn't have any handy), doubled the garlic, and used sriracha. Good base to play with - you can interchange the basil with other herbs (dill, parsley, cilantro, saffron even). Good fresh eggs and a good olive oil are key. Also tried it with rice vinegar, canola oil with a touch of sesame, and sriracha, and got a whole new delicious twist.

LOVE, love, love this! The aioli is fabulous made with Vegannaise. I upped all the remaining aioli ingredients to make it more pungent and we all loved it very much.

Very good recipe -- I followed it mostly as written. I used a lot more garlic and basil, and I briefly (2 mins) sauteed the non-mayo ingredients before making the aioli. One more change from the recipe: I brushed some aioli on the fish when it was halfway done, which I thought added to the flavor.

I only made the aioli sauce, which turned out great. After reading other comments I decided to use mayo instead of the egg yolks, and I used 2/3 cup of olive oil. My aioli came out very thick and had a nice consistency. Also, I wanted to serve it hot so I found that microwaving small amounts in the microwave for about 20 seconds on high worked nicely (but don't forget to stir afterwards as the heat sort of deconstructs it) I will make this again, and again....

Surprisingly thin, oddly bitter aftertaste (possibly my fault for using food processor on garlic), lacking in much basil flavor at all, and exceedingly oily. I like the flavor ideas, but I'd never try this particular recipe again.

Aioli only- Used dill instead of basil and left out the water. Other reviewers were right, it was not very thick but still delicious.

For some reason I couldn't get the aioli to get to mayo-like consistency. Next time I'll probably take the easy route and just use organic mayonnaise instead. The flavor was really good and worked really well with the salmon and the zucchini. I might add a little less anchovy next time because it was a little salty for my taste.

forgot to check I'd make it again.

Excellent and easy when you make it with store-bought mayonnaise. Make sure you use fresh basil. It's become my go to salmon recipe.

I am always looking for new salmon recipes, and was very pleased with the results of this dish. The aioli was very good, I added several more garlic cloves, anchovies and an additional tablespoon of basil. It kept well and I used it on sandwiches and on chicken later that week.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe for basil aioli and didn't end up serving it with the salmon.

I feel bad giving it such a low rating when the real issue was that we just don't know how to grill fish. It took A LOT longer to cook than the recipe said (I guess the grill wasn't hot enough). Flipping a fish that size was also really difficult. As for the aioli, it had a good flavor that the guests liked, but they complained it wasn't really aioli. They're of Greek descent and are accustomed to it being a lot thicker than it turned out. I might try this again, but with a smaller piece of fish and with the grill MUCH hotter. I think I might also use a different sauce to the aioli.

This is one of my new staples. This aioli goes on pretty much everything. I like to take some cous cous, top it with a grilled chicken breast, and slather it with the aioli. Good, fast weekday stuff.

This is fantastic. My husband got some salmon from an Alaskan trip and I have been doing many salmon recipes and this was great. I roasted the salmon rather than grilled. Plus, I made the aioli in the food processor, a little easier. We have chickens so we have lots of eggs and make lots of aioli but this was considered VERY good. We grow basil and garlic and so it made it very good and we loved it. There was a lot of aioli left over and I am looking forward to using it on some sauteed zucchini.

Great aioli, served with some pasta salad, very colorful, fresh, lots of flavor.

Tasty, but our group felt that the mayo lacked spunk (or citrus) which was a bummer because we made it from scratch, followed the recipe, and used home grown basil. I recommend the lime butter salmon.

This could get more stars, but the simplicity of the grilling the lightly oil food meant that the only seasoning was the to die for mayonnaise. We did follow the recipe and made the aioli from scratch, which was not difficult. Our friends loved the meal, too.
