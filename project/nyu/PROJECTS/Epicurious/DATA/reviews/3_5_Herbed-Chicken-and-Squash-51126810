This was delicious. I did soften the butternut squash before I cooked it with the chicken as I was afraid it would not have time to soften in the oven. Next time, I would definitely double the sauce recipe!

This was delicious. Following others' suggestions, I roasted the veggies separately--mostly because I didn't think they would all fit on the baking sheet with the chicken. I tossed the squash and onions together in a bowl with the olive oil and vinegar, and doubled the sauce for the chicken. Husband loved it, and my 3.5 year old daughter deigned to eat some as well.

Hate to say it, but I don't get it. I'm kind of a newbie to cooking so I followed the recipe to the letter and served it over a bed of rice. I thought that the chicken was ok but everything else was kind of bland. There was no real sauce to speak of and the veggies were just kind of...there. The chicken was moist and we liked the apricot/ginger flavor but for the amount of time, I can think of dozens of things I'd rather make...

good and easy

Very easy to make and agree that the only thing that takes time is the prep. Just pour a drink and play some music. The apricot-mustard sauce is a treat. Anytime I can eat this well for only 362 calories I feel like I just cheated the system.

This dish is not quick and easy, but it is tasty. It may not be as healthy as you think either when you consider the size of the portions--over 3/4 lb of food per person! (without any sides or salad). In stead of cippolini, i cut a sweet onion into wedges. We liked the squash and onions better than the chicken!

This was good. I would recommend using less ginger; it's just too intense for my taste. I also bought the squash pre-cubed to save time.

Absolutely delicious - love what the sweet mustard and ginger do for this dish. This is not the quickest meal due to the peeling and cutting of the squash, which could be done ahead. I tossed the squash and onions with balsamic in one bowl. Might use a bit more rosemary next time. Other than that, this is a keeper!

We loved this recipe, however I did make a few modifications... 1. I followed previous reviews and roasted the vegetables separately. 2. in addition I sprinkled balsamic vinegar on the chicken too. 3. I didn't have apricot preserves for the sauce so I put orange preserve, dijon mustard, 2 garlic cloves, powder ginger seasoning, and 6 dried apricots into a magic bullet and processed until smooth, then I added quinoa to the mixture, flipped the chicken over, and spread evenly on each breast of chicken. IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!! The entire family devoured it!

Simple and delicious. The kids loved it, too. Perfect for a cold autumn/winter evening.

This was very good, but next time I will make some changes. I will add more balsamic vinegar to the onions. I will also roast the veggies by themselves first for about 10 minutes. They weren't quite roast-y enough for my liking. Other than that, it was great. Pretty quick, although it took some time to peel and chop the squash.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. The vegetables can be cooked separately, with the sauce used for the chicken doubled or tripled and put over the squash and onions. The cooking time was 55 minutes. It definitely needs a rice/couscous to go with the sauce.

I would not use the words quick or easy to describe this recipe. Prep took at least 20 mins and peeling chippolini onions is not easy. That being said, it was absolutley delicious! My picky husband and daughters liked it. The only subsistution I made was thighs for breasts. I will definitly make this again, when I have lots of time.

Delicious and easy to make! I used boneless skinless chicken breast halves instead (6 halves came out to about 2.5 pounds) and yellow onions cut into quarters instead of cipollini or sweet onions. I also cut way back on the salt because my husband is on a low-sodium diet for health reasons, and we didn't miss the salt at all. My baking time was at least 10 minutes longer than recommended to reach 165 degrees, but the chicken was not dry at all. I served it over couscous with a side of green beans, and it was great!
