This is an easy recipe to follow, my soon-to-be 12 year-old daughter just prepared it. It tastes delicious, and it is still hot. Should be better tomorrow. Bon Appetit

Very nice salad. The shredded carrot and chopped dill gave it great flavour and colour. Used sour cream in place of yogurt. Tastes better the next day.

Great salad! I only added some chopped gherkins and sliced radishes to it and it was perfect.

Excellent -- a great potato salad to serve on a hot day.... It needed just a touch of salt.

Used a different kind of potato and cooking method, but really liked them with this dressing. Will keep the recipe as one of the many good options for potato salad.

I think the key to this recipe is pairing it well. I think it goes well with fish or grilled chicken dishes of complimentary flavors. On it's own it's OK but nothing special.

I really liked this salad but I didn't get any rave reviews from my guests...in fact I had one comment, "It's interesting," that I would take as a negative review. It was fairly easy to make...a bit time-consuming cutting up and cooking 3 pounds of small red potatoes...and since it wasn't a hit, I'll not be making it again.

I selected this dish because of all the rave reviews. It was wonderful! Easy to prepare and quite tasty. The combinations work really well together.

This is a fabulous recipe! I loved the addition of the shredded carrots!!

I would give this two-and-a half forks, if that was an option. It's a good low-cal version, and I agree the carrot makes an interesting addition, but I think I'll look at other recipes before I make this again. I wanted it a little creamier, so just kept adding yogurt, to keep the cals/fat down, and that was fine. To state the obvious, if you only like, and not love horseradish, watch out how much you put in - no surprise that it can easily overpower the other ingredients.

I thought this salad was very good, but my husband prefers a potato salad with more mayonnaise in it With a few modifications, it could end up pleasing him too! This salad could feed 4 people easily, as a side dish

This was easy and came out really well. It's a colorful and tasty version, and a welcome change for anyone who's tired of the same old side dish.

A lively and welcome variation from the usual potato salad recipes. Horseradish lovers will want to double that ingredient. I was initially skeptical about the grated carrots, but they add sweetness, crunch, and color. My husband loved it.
