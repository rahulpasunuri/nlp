Wow- that was surprisingly fresh and tasty. I used plain greek yogurt, extra tarragon and salt, and some lima beans i had in the freezer since I didn't have enough fresh peas. YUM!!!

I used fresh peas, fresh spinach, whole milk yogurt following the recipe exactly. The combination was certainly not what I expected. It's hard to believe that you can combine these ingredients and come up with a taste like this.

In searching for this recipe, I was trying to recreate a soup my husband and I had at the Fearrington House, a five star inn and restaurant in Pittsboro, NC. I modified it by simply simmering the frozen peas in the stock with sugar and salt and pepper, but then cooled the mixture by adding the cup of ice and letting it set before pouring it over the fresh spinach and 3 tbspn fresh tarragon I had packed into my blender. I pureed it and added 1 cup of whole milk plain yogurt. It was amazing. Like the Fearrington house, I added some finely chopped, steamed shrimp that I had steamed with old bay seasoning in a mixture of half water and half apple cider vinegar. I plan to make this as a starter course for a formal luncheon I'm throwing for my cousin's baby shower.
