This makes much more that the Pork Chile Verde recipe requires, so consider making half unless you have another need for this type of salsa. Plan to use my leftover along with some Salsa Verde for Huevos something! Use your nose and not your eyes to judge when to stop frying the chiles and the garlic, they can both burn quickly and ruin the salsa (likely the problem for many of the other reviewers!
