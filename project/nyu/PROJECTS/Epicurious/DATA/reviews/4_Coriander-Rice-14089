Simply delicious ... exactly what a coriander rice should be!

Thanks to the cook from Chapel Hill! I followed his/her variations, adding shallot, minced garlic, rede bell pepper, and substituting chicken broth for the water. Delicious!

This is good, and I will make it again - but not for everything. I made it to go with a curry and the flavors here are too subtle, they were overwhelmed by the curry sauce. I think it would be great with a lighter fish or chicken dish.

Wonderful basic recipe. I also used chicken stock and added shallot and garlic as well as some fresh lemon zest. It was great and even the kids were gobbling it up!

I totally agree with using chicken broth instead of water. It adds a ton of flavor. I used a rice medley of three different kinds of rice instead if just long grain, which made it more colorful. I would definitely make this again.

This is an simple way to increase the flavor and looks of plain rice. The measurements and timing are perfect. I did use chicken broth the last time I made this, instead of water and it was even better! My boyfriend usually puts some sort of sauce on all of his rice dishes for flavor and he ate this without needing to add anything. It smelled and looked great and was extremely simple.

This is now our favorite rice dish with a few variations. Following the advice of others, I added a shallot, minced garlic and pine nuts and substituted chicken broth for the water. Another addition I tried is sauted red bell pepper which adds a nice color to the dish. Definitely do not leave out the cilantro at the end because it truly does make the dish.

This rice looks beautiful, has a fragrant smell, and the cilantro gives it a wonderful fresh taste. It's a surprisingly easy way to dress up plain white rice and a great use for any extra cilantro hanging around.

Great flavor. I added 1/4 cup of toasted pine nuts which added texture and interest to the flavor. The cilantro/coriander really makes it.
