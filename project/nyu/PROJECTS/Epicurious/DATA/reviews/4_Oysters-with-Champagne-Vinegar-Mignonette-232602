Wonderful! And easy, as long as your oysters are shucked! The best preparation of oysters I have had. I have made this several times.

Everyone who dared to try these loved them. For some reason my oysters had baby crabs in them, lol. I guess just be aware that this can happen and check for them!

Unbelievably easy. Even my oyster-shy husband really enjoyed the flavor combination and broiling anything with butter makes it taste amazing - topping it off with some acid and sweetness can only make it better.

Outstanding! Light. Brings out the flavor of the opysters. We've made this 4 -5 times and each time it's wonderful. Enjoy.

This is a fabulous recipe! I made it two nights in a row with fresh oysters I ordered from the Internet (I live in the wilds of Alabama.) I followed it exactly, except I didn't bother with no stinkin' grapes. My friend who is a world traveler said they were the best oysters she'd ever eaten. I have to agree.

The flavor from the mignonette is fantastic! Although I usually like fresh oysters plain, this recipe really added a special something. I served it in a tiny bowl, so my guests could spoon it on if they desired. . . they became addicted to it like I did!
