I like thyme as much as the next person but dried thyme and liver? Followed the recipe EXACTLY as instructed...that thyme was a major villian in this recipe IMHO. It turned the liver all sorts of bitter nasty, stayed in the pan to taint those lovely onions and by the time the port was added, we were deglazing all sorts of burnt and bitter thyme bits. That poor piece of liver didn't stand a chance. The sauce was good but wouldn't make this again (sorry Christine)

Uggg! I don't know what happend but this was terrible. It could have been due to two factors. Our port wine wasn't too good. The Port wine I used was a gift from someone which is quite undrinkable and sickly sweet {and they gave us two bottles of it-oh! no!}. I didn't want to waste the wine and throw it out, so I used this recipe that called for 'port'. The bad taste of the wine made the sauce taste terrible. The flour from the liver stuck to the bottom of the pan and gradually got darker and darker despite the bacon fat and lowish cooking temperature, the resulting burnt taste was also unpleasant. A nonstick pan might have helped this problem. Another thing we didn't like is how the calf's liver had chewy elastic gristly stuff in it.All in all we didn't care for this, you might have better luck with some better wine and not burning the flour. Not a keeper for us.

I like liver but not hard cooked liver and this was perfect and tender and tasty and my brotherinlaw who dosn't like liver says he liked it- will definitely make again but will dbl the sauce (not the onion as that was plenty) because the sauce is great with the liver and mashed potatoes!

My family loved this, even the 3 year old! However, I found the liver to be a bit bland, so next time may skip the thyme and use a bit of cayenne in the flour. Otherwise, great recipe and really easy.

Quick, easy, and delicious recipe. I made it with chicken livers instad of calf's liver, but was otherwise true to the ingredients as written. Might go easier on the bacon next time, but I think that's a matter of personal preference.

Looked up what to do with Calf's Liver and we were eating this delicious dish about 30 min later but it does not even take that long to prepare. Rave reviews from my husband.This recipe is a keeper!

Two thumbs up! A wonderful recipe. Instead of chopping the onions, I thinly sliced them for a more traditional presentation. Also used more onions than stated in recipe.

I'm always looking for a new way to prepare liver and this was the best recipe ever. I have served it several times with raves.
