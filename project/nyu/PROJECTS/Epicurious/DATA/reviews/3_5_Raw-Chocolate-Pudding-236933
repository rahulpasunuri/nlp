This recipe is delicious! The texture is superior to pudding in my opinion as it denser and richer. I used 6 figs and 4 prunes based on other reviews. I also added only 5 dates and included the nut butter. Finally, I used half unsweetened almond milk and half water only adding 1 cup final volume. This is superior to traditional chocolate pudding to me. I can taste, the cocoa, nuts, and the fruits yet they come together quite nicely.

I had a hard time getting this really smooth. I used prunes in place of the figs based on other reviews. I also used 3 T of almond butter to make it less sweet. It came out good but there's room for improvement.Next time I'll soak the fruit in the water ahead of time to try and soften the fruit up hopefully making it smoother. Also next time I'll make my own nut butter with hazelnuts for a chocolate hazelnut pudding, throw it into a graham cracker crust and call it chocolate cream pie! I feel like it needed a crunchy contrast! This recipe will not fool anybody into thinking it's actually chocolate pudding but it's a great healthy option if you have a sweet tooth!

Excellent sweet tooth satisfier! We ate it with fresh bananas and shredded coconut! I'm going to make it again with a Vita Mix this time to get it even smoother.

This is a great recipe. If you're looking for traditional chocolate pudding this is not for you. However, if you want an amazing and healthy option to cure your sweet tooth, this is definitely awesome. I used 15 figs, 15 pitted dates, a scant 1 T peanut butter and 1/2 T. vanilla and just added water until it was smooth. I've made this 3 times since I found the recipe and my wife and I love it. I can't think of anything wrong with this.

I made this per the exact recipe, and results were in line with other reviews. When I first tasted it, I really wasn't sure, but after a couple spoonfuls, it grew on me. The fig seeds make it a bit grainy, but the taste is close to pudding. Overall, a good, healthy dessert alternative.

Exceptional flavor and texture. Did the recipe exactly as written with the nut butter and was fabulous. We took apart the blade to get every drop before cleaning the blender. No one could believe these healthy ingredients produced the best chocolate treat we've tasted ! Also tried carob powder which was good but can't beat the chocolate.

I agree it's more like chocolate-flavored figs. I wasn't able to get the texture smooth enough for this to really remind me of pudding... it was still pretty chunky after blending for quite a while. I didn't add the nut butter cause I didn't have it. This may help the texture. I also agree with the other reviews that it is super-sweet.

I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting from a vegan chocolate pudding recipe, but ultimately I have a hard time calling this "chocolate" pudding. It's really more of a fig pudding with chocolate flavoring. The figs are overpowering and slightly grainy and the dates are very, very sweet. For what it is, it's good. Not delicious, but good. I'd recommend reducing the number of figs and dates and increasing the nut butter.

amazing!! I have made a few times now and tried a few variations, adding cinnamon, cardamon, orange zest. It's fabulous as is or put your own spin!

Wow! Tasty but a bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll omit a few dates, maybe add more nut butter to compensate. I added about a 1/2 tsp of orange zest (the zest of one clementine) which gave it a lovely twist. Great recipe!

REALLY good! I used my finger to clean out the blender ... Would make it again but delete one or 2 figs and 1 date so it's more bittersweet chocolatey.

Yummy! I was doubtful but it was great. My two year old even liked it. Followed the recipe exactly as written.

I really wasn't sure about this recipe, but since I had dried figs to get rid of, I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, the results were pretty good, even though I omitted the dates (didn't have any) and the nut butter. The "pudding" tasted chocolate-y, and the texture was perfect. I'd definitely recommend using nut butter, to give the pudding more depth. (Cocoa powder on its own just doesn't have enough.) And be warned that there are clear figgy overtones to the pudding...

Fantastic! I was dubious that this would taste as delightful as real chocolate pudding, but it truly does and with so little effort.
