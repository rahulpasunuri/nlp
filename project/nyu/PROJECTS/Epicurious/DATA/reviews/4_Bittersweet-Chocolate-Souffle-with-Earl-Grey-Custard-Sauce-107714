I made these in individual heart ramekins for a valentine dessert, baked 16-18 minutes. Very nice chocolate flavor and the sauce was excellent. I steeped the tea in the warm milk/cream 15 min. then strained it and reheated before adding to the egg yolks which seems easier to me than trying to strain a thick custard. Ended up with some leftover custard that I threw in the freezer to see how earl grey ice cream is.

I was optimistic to try this recipe and followed it exactly. This was not my first attempt at making souffles, I have made them many a times, for upto 12 people at a time, without any difficulty. I was disappointed in this recipe and will not be trying it again. it started with the sauce. My instinct told me that 6 egg yolks would be too many, and I was right. The sauce came out very thick almost like a pudding. This is not how I believe sauces should be. The taste was nice, a bit too sweet, but overall a nice flavour. Then, I used the recipe to make 4 souffles instead of the 6 which the recipe claims it makes. I filled the cups, running a knife slightly (1/8 inch) around the top to help the souffle rise. They did rise, but only slightly, and not above the edge of ramekin. I still cooked the souffles the same amount of time as the recipe called for 30 min. They were heavy and too dry, so I believe they may have been overcooked. That was strange as there was more souffle batter per dish then called for. I did check them earlier, but was hoping/expecting that they would rise so I left them in the oven longer. So, I was not impressed with the recipe and will look for another chocolate one instead, or just stick with my vamilla one that I can do in my sleep.

DESSERT AWESOMENESS! I made this recipe exactly as written - it's perfect, and my seven guests raved about it. TASTE: A great souffle with great texture. It was light and airy with a very well-balanced chocolate flavor. It was nice that the chocolate didn't overwhelm, so that the sauce was the perfect undertone. My diners agreed that the sauce very well may have stolen the show - it's awesome. NOTE: This recipe is for the brave and bold, incorporating two of the toughest elements of dessert making: custards and souffles. But never fear! Cook your custard nice and slow, and make sure to remove from heat when the right temp hits. For me this was about four minutes into cooking...eight would have made scrambled eggs. On the souffle, fold the egg whites in carefully, and don't stir. Mine had a bit of a marbled appearance, but that's what a souffle looks like...the texture was perfect. AMAZE AND ASTONISH all your friends with this great recipe!

This is amazing. I'm in dessert heaven. (eating it as I speak :) the custard is very thin - I added some therm-flo to thicken it. It is also very sweet - next time I will use less sugar. I topped it with unsweetened whipped cream - evened it out nicely. simply fantastic. I will make it again and again!!

Amazing! Everyone loved both the soufflé and the custard. I made it just as the recipe said and it turned out beautifully. I had so many comments about how great it looked and tasted. I will definitely be making this one again.

We use this sauce recipe with the other Bittersweet Chocolate Souffle recipe since that one can be refrigerated after preparation and before baking. (Makes orchestrating the dinner easier.) I make the sauce using an herbal peppermint blend rather than the Earl Grey. I am a tea drinker, but Earl Grey is not my favorite. The refreshing and subtle peppermint adds to the nice contrasts: cold sauce with hot souffle; light colored sauce with the dark souffle; cool peppermint with the light but intense chocolate. We put the sauce down on the plate and swirl to get nice coverage, and then serve the scoops of souffle on top of the sauce. We make this dessert for special occasions, like New Year's Eve.

This was so great! I made it for my sister and brother in law who had just had a baby. He's a total chocolate fiend, and loved it, and she loved the earl grey sauce. It was all really delicious.

I loved the sauce, but my souffle came out a bit dense. I'll definitely be making this delicious sauce again, but will most likely use a different souffle (but one equally bitter, since it complemented the custard nicely, it just didn't have the right texture.

The sauce alone is the star of this recipe! We've made it separately to eat as a custard. Our tea bags (Twinings) did not have whole leaves but were rather powdery, so we didn't strain it, and the little dark flecks added to the appearance, sort of like vanilla bean flecks. It separated very easily, though, so you have to beat the heck out of it while it's thickening.

Wow, the custard was fantastic! I agreed with other reviewers that it could do with less sugar -- but the flavor was unbeatable! We served it with a Lady Grey tea which went very nicely and allowed the dish to show off its flavor.

This is in response to the cook from Milwaukee. You may have over beaten your whites. You can tell if you did that not only bcz your souffle came out dense, but if it was a bit dry as well. You also may have over folded your whites into the base mix. I have found, through trial and error, that you really need to use a good quality chocolate as well. Might me pricey, but worth it!

the sauce was stellar! didn't know what to expect and i am an earl grey tea drinker. so great. this was my first souffle and i think it came out a little denser than it should have. perhaps someone could tell me some thoughts as to why? i remember good souffles being VERY light. this was excellent tasting but i think too heavy. did i beat the egg whites to much? i used 85% cocao bittersweet chocalate is that wy? any tips would be very welcome! will definitely make again.

The sauce is the star in this recipe! As another reviewer wrote, friends were trying to figure out the ingredient, and, when I told them, they were surprised (very pleasantly). The souffle itself is basic, but good. Will try the sauce with another flavor of souffle.

Made this for Valentine's Day dinner--my first attempt at a souffle--and it was truly wonderful! The custard had such an interesting (and I mean that in a good way) flavor and the souffle wasn't too sweet. Outstanding!

One of the easiest...and most delicious souffle recipes I have ever used. The sauce is great although is a bit intense. adds a great herbal background where everyone is left guessing what that excellent flavor is. a quick and easy keeper.

I couldn't find Earl Grey tea in Caracas, so I used Peppermint tea instead. The custard thickened quite fast (in fact, I'm afraid it thickened too much) but the flavour was amazing. I would definetively make it again, probably using rose tea next time...

Truly extraordinary. I've made it twice now, to rave reviews both times. First time I was trying to do too many things at one time and ended up curdling the custard. It was servable after the straining. Second time custard was perfect; I put the souffle mixture in six 1-cup souffle dishes. Next time I'll use 3/4 cup souffle dishes to get a bit more of the puffed up effect.

The souffle is light and wonderful and the sauce rich. Although a bit time intense, this is a keeper as guests really loved it and were looking for seconds. It was the perfect desert for a light supper of fresh lemon sole and asparagus.

Never making a souffle before and knowing that it had to put together at the last minute, was a bit daunting. But it was all worth it. Served this at a Valentines Tea. The Earl geay sauce was excellent. The souffle was a little dry, but was the result of us talking and not hearing the timer. will try again.

I made this for my husband last night and he said it was the best dessert I had ever made him. It was very light and not too sweet. I bought very good chocolate for the souffle. The sauce was great. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very easy to make.
