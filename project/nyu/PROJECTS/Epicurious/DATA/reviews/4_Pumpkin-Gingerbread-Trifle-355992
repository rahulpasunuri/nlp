This recipe was absolutely delicious!! I followed a few pieces of advice from previous reviewers: -I added 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice to the gingerbread. It was delicious. Soft, and not super intense for those who are on the fence about the flavor. Had about 1/6 of the recipe left over after putting the dish together, and it didn't last long!! -I doubled the mousse recipe. You could probably get away with 1.5, but doubling is easier and who doesn't want leftovers?! -Fold in the whipped cream gently! Start with a third of it, then the next, and then the final third. -I wouldn't have minded adding some kind of crunch, but I had a guest who was allergic to nuts so I tried heath bar. It totally melted overnight and disappeared into the trifle. Next time I would try a layer or two of candied pecans. -I skipped the whipped cream in the middle and did gingerbread - mousse - gingerbread - mousse - gingerbread - mousse. Then I made whipped cream right before I served it (with maple syrup instead of sugar) and did a thin layer on top. Perfect! This recipe is even better the next day, and better then next - it ages so well!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious; everyone really liked it. I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the mousse, but would not do that next time. I felt that the gingerbread, which was very good, got lost with all the mousse. Also took the suggestion of another reviewer and topped with candied pecans instead of candied ginger, but I would try the ginger next time. I think the ginger would give a little needed kick that the pecans, though yummy, didn't.

This was a perfect light end to Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone from 2 to 72 liked it. I did increase the cinnamon and nutmeg and added cloves, then used a little more than half the gingerbread in the trifle; this served 8 perfectly. I may use my own darker gingerbread next time. The mousse (and it was definitely mousse) was very good, pumpkin-y but not too spicy to contrast nicely with the gingerbread.

Just made this for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday - huge success! I read all the reviews and made a couple of changes - I sprinkled each gingerbread layer with about 3 tablespoons of Cointreau (orange liqueur) and finished with about 1/4 cup of chopped crystallized ginger on the final whipped cream garnish. Made it on Saturday for Sunday and today (Monday) the tiny leftover bit is still great.

I was looking for a creative pumpkin dessert recipe when I stumbled along this one. I was hesitant because I was in charge of desserts for my in-laws' thanksgiving and they are brutally honest if something does not suite their taste buds. I am happy to say, with a few adjustments, they loved it! I replaced the gingerbread cake with a pumpkin spice cake recipe, and added 2oz of rum to the pumpkin mousse, it was a huge success!!

Wow! This recipe is amazing. I took the advise of others and doubled the pumpkin mousse. Was glad I did. The dessert is beautiful and delicious.

The gingerbread recipe was great, but I think I would let it sit out overnight w/o foil on top to dry out a bit before proceeding the next day. As others recommended, I doubled the mousse recipe; if I make it again, I think 1.5 times the original recipe would suffice. Not sure who can make this with only 45 min. "active time"; it's not hard to make, but it took me more time than 45 min.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was a success. I read all of the reviews before making it which helped a lot. I loved the gingerbread and will keep it as my favorite gingerbread recipe. Many people said it wasn't flavorful enough. I used Brer Rabbit FULL flavor molasses, as that was all I could find at the store. Perhaps others used a milder molasses as suggested in the recipe and that is why it needed additional spices. Instead of increasing the pumpkin mousse recipe, I only used 2/3 of the gingerbread in the trifle. I put mousse in the bottom of the bowl as suggested and skipped the top layer of whipped cream. The remaining 1/3 of the gingerbread I cut into 28 small squares and put a dollop of cream cheese frosting on each using a large star tip decorator. I saved them in the fridge to use later. (I actually tested the gingerbread recipe a week earlier and used it to make the "cake bites" to take to an event. The leftovers stayed fresh 6 days in the fridge.) I used the extra frosting to decorate the top of the trifle and topped all frosting with a small piece of candied ginger. I agree with a couple of comments about the mousse "not being sweet enough" and "needing something." In the trifle it is fine, but not on its own!

Fantastic!! I added a lot more spices to the gingerbread and added a couple of layers of candied cranberries for color. Definately make double the pumpkin mousse. Even if you don't use it in the trifle it won't go to waste!

DELICIOUS! I wish I'd read the reviews first and seen the suggestion to double the mousse - that would have made it perfect. This was a HUGE hit at our Pumpkin Party and I'll definitely make it again (and again and again and again!)

If I could rate this less than one fork I would. Perhaps I did something wrong but this was not a hit at the family Xmas dessert buffet!

My husband liked this but I did not. My gingerbread did not turn out well. It was too moist. The flavors did not move me very much. If I did make it again, I would perhaps buy a gingerbread cake mix.

As suggested, I doubled the pumpkin mousse and am glad I did. I skipped the middle whipped cream layer to give more room for the mousse. I thought the spices were right on. Everyone ranted and raved about this. I assembled the day before which allowed the mousse to really set nicely. This will be a regular Thanksgiving/Christmas dessert!!

the HIT of a holiday party.. I added a 1/2 amount to the pumpkin mousse and the amount was perfect. Also added butterscotch sauce, drizzled over the gingerbread layers and then over the final whipped cream layer. Threw in some toffee bits for good measure and was very happy with that decision :)

I just took this to a neighborhood party and people loved it. I added more ginger, cinnamon and some ground cloves to the gingerbread but otherwise followed the recipe. I"m always looking to improve recipes and asked what could be different. We decided the gingerbread part needed an alcoholic addition - perhaps calvados or another apple-flavored brandy. I think the gingerbread should be in smaller cubes or smaller slices - perhaps make 11/2 recipes of the mouse and put some mouse on the bottom, and more layers of mouse and gingerbread, Also - what about adding maple syrup instead of sugar/vanilla to the whipped cream? This recipe has a lot of potential, and each component is really delicious Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Pumpkin-Gingerbread-Trifle-355992#ixzz17x7MtLkC

This was an amazing dessert, and I will make it again and again. The gingerbread was wonderful - I'm keeping it as a gingerbread recipe to use by itself with a lemon sauce or whipped cream topping. The only change I might make is to double the pumpkin mousse. It was absolutely delicious, and I wanted more! This recipe will be a go-to for my holidays from now on.

If there were 5 forks, I'd give it a 5! This recipe is to die for! The dark, rich gingerbread was fantastic, though I did add some ground cloves to add a bit more depth to the flavor. I can't wait to make this again!

Very good and easy to do. I used 2 boxes of gingerbread cake mix; added extra allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and 2 TB. molasses to the mix, since reviewers complained that the cake was too bland. For health and time management reasons, I used a 16 oz container of light Cool Whip added to the pumpkin mousse and in the layers. My guests really loved it.

This recipe is amazing , I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it including my husband who ate it with his eyes closed . The cake is dark , soft and rich and perfectly spiced. The colours together are very attractive . I love it and would love to curl up with it today and a good book. I wouldn't add anything .Bravo !

This dish was a bit hit at Christmas dinner. Not too sweet or rich, but an incredible combination of flavors that captures the holiday traditions of trifle, gingerbread and pumpkin. This instant classic will be on our dessert board every year.

Made this for Christmas dinner -- it was a hit, though with adults more than with kids. If I make again I will add a layer of carmelized pecans to give the topping a little crunch.

This was a big hit at xmas dinner! followed recipe exactly except for garnish (used crumbled molasses cookies that i had on hand, rather than getting candied ginger). I thought the pumpkin mousse could have used a little more sweetness, but I was the only one of that opinion. Also, my mom said it was too spicy, but I think she was just jealous bcs it was such a success! ;) Everyone else loved the spice... it is gingerbread, after all! Easy to make, tasty, beautiful presentation = recommended!

I, nor any of my guests, were very impressed with this recipe. It was really rich, but not all that flavorful. I usually make eggnog trifle which is amazing, and the guest were very upset that I decided to try something new this year. I promised to go back to the eggnog recipe next year.

Like another reviewer, I cheated and bought a gingerbread mix for the cake layer. It worked great and the dessert was a huge hit at my party - serves a crowd!

Delicious. Definitely fold the pumpkin mousse into your whipped cream gently to preserve that light texture. I liked the spices as they were because the gingerbread had such a deep flavor and a spicy mousse might have been too much. My family was glad for the change-up from pie for Thanksgiving. I prepared it all in advance the day before except the top layer of whipped cream, which I was able to easily throw together while everyone's Thanksgiving meal was settling.

Absolutely wonderful! I will definately be making it again. My husband loved it make according to the direction. I would have loved more mousse. I would try it with 1 1/2 the recipe next time.

I forgot to include the gelatin for the pumpkin mousse, and the texture was great. I would add a little more spice to the mousse in the future.

A huge hit at our Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I think my family was suprised at how much they liked it because none of them understood what a trifle is. Now it will be one of our annual traditions. Definitely a keeper.

Fabulous both in taste and presentation! At our huge family Thanksgiving celebration there was much grousing when we realized none of the people who were assigned to make desserts had chosen to make Pumpkin Pie this year. Then we dug into the trifle and they declared it the "New Official Pumpkin Pie" of our family. I agree with the reviewer who said it wasnt a very spicy Gingerbread. It is more mellow, but very moist and delicious. Made the cake 2 days in advance, and then assembled in the morning. Since whipping the topping right before serving was not possible due to location and travel, I topped it at home and then inverted a domed plastic bowl over the top of the trifle for travel in the cooler. Whipped cream traveled well and it was devoured. Will make again and again.

A lot of work for not that tasty of a treat. The gingerbread portion was tasty but the pumpkin mousse was definitely lacking something.

Rating: 4
everyone loved it! it made twice as much gingerbread than was needed (or half as much pumpkin & cream as needed), but my family is enjoying the leftover gingerbread on its own. if you add a spoonful of the melted gelatin to the whipped cream, you can assemble the whole thing the night before.

Just great. More gingery than I expected, gave it a darker flavor than expected. It was loved by all who tasted it. None of it was difficult, but it was time consuming and a little tedious. But then, I like that sort of thing.

I thought this was good--the rest of my family flipped over it! They now request this as a new tradition. My signature pumpkin and pecan pies were almost untouched and my kids are still going back for more as the weekend progresses. It makes a LOT--I think the recipe could be cut in 1/2 for our family of 8 (at least the gingerbread). Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I must confess to gingerbread from a mix--it was still scrumptious in the trifle, using the pumpkin mousse and cream made as per the recipe.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out very well. Great presentation and travelled well. Made gingerbread 2 days beforehand, made the custard and assembled the day beforehand and put the final layer of cream on just before serving. Paired excellent with port.

I'm not that crazy about pumpkin pie but this will be on all my Thanksgiving menus from now. Everyone raved about it at a group I use to try new recipes on. And a trifle is always very showy. I'll be taking this for Thanksgiving dinner.

EXCELLENT seasonal recipe! To assure that the pumpkin mousse is light and fluffy, be sure to whip the cream, then take a big spoonful of it and stir it into the pumpkin mixture to "lighten" it up. Then dump the whipped cream into the pumpkin mixture and gently fold it in. The result will be light and airy, not at all heavy like pumpkin pie filling.

Excellent! Nice mix of flavors. I really liked the combination of gingerbread and pumpkin. This was make a great substitution for pumpkin pie on the Thanksgiving table. The pumpkin mousse was nothing like a mouse (not light and airy) it was more like pie filling consistency.
