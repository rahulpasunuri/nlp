Fabulous vegetable dish. I made it for our Monday Potluck. Everyone raved about it. I added the juice of half a lemon which enhanced the freshness of this dish.

Just made this for my Easter dinner, and everyone really enjoyed it. Made just as the recipe was written, and will make again. I found fava beans at Trader Joe's already steamed and used those. It makes a ton, well more than 6 servings in my mind.

My sister and I made this, but just with asparagus, and it was quite tasty and simple to make. We definitely recommend it.

I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. It makes a ton of food, so you could definitely halve it. It's a very subtle combination of flavors, so not for those who prefer the bolder tastes. Benefitted from additional lemon juice and a little more salt. Also, make sure to cut up the lemon rind into fine pieces--they're great in a bite of it, but don't appear frequently enough at the size requested.

I love vegetables but this recipe did not do it for me. I did not like this mixture of vegetables. When served most people thought it was only OK, nothing special. I would not make this again.

This is a great side dish to complement any spring menu. I served it with a lemon-thyme roasted chicken, and it got rave reviews. The fava beans were great, but not necessarily worth the effort. I used half edamame and half fava, and I have to say that I liked the edamame more. They're less work (especially if you buy them pre-shelled), and taste less bitter. The lemon flavor is very light--perfect!

We made this when we found fava beans at the farmer's market. My husband and I both absolutely loved it and went down to the farmer's market to buy more fava beans the next week so we could have it again. This dish was just the essence of spring and I can't wait until springtime to make it again!

I had to try this since everyone has praised it. Searched far and wide for favas, but had to substitute limas the first time--peeling them was quite easy. If you can find fresh or frozen favas, which I eventually did, by all means use them. They add a truly fresh flavor that the limas just can't give to the dish. My husband found the dish "especially good." I've also made this as a fine addition to pasta, tossed with some cream, as a primavera-type dish--very satisfying.

Made this for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it. What a great dish and so easy. I substituted fresh green beans for the fava beans but kept everything else the same. The shallots are a must do not skimp. Great flavor and not to heavy. A keeper.

FABULOUS!!!!! THE SHALLOTS REALLY ADD FLAVOR TO THE DISH, SO DON'T SKIMP ON THEM. THIS RECIPE IS A TRUE FIND--PERFECT FOR DINNER GUESTS, BUT EASY ENOUGH TO ADD TO THE NORMAL REPETOIRE. KUDOS TO GOURMET FOR PUBLISHING IT!

Very rich taste. I left out the sugar snap peas as I don't like them. I also blanched the asparagus for about 3 minutes first because I felt that they would be too tough otherwise. I'm a real lemon lover and I thought its flavour went together perfect with the vegetables. A keeper.

I used this recipe for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it! I made 2x the recipe and there were no leftovers. The only substitution I made was fresh green beans for the fava/lima beans - they didn't have any at our grocer. HIghly recommended!!

Wonderful spring vegetable dish. Loved it with the fava beans but hated preparing them so I have sustituted edamame with great success.

A really delicious blend of flavors. Everyone enjoyed it even with the lima beans which are usually a universally hated vegetable! Very springlike and pretty. It's become an Easter dinner standard.

I thought that this recipe was a good blend of flavors and textures. It was very refreshing for the summer and I particularly enjoyed the tanginess of the lemons with the sweetness of the carmelized shallots. I'd definitely make this again.
