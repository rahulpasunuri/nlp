I make this every year for Thanksgiving dinner. It's not only requested every year, but it's the hit of the entire feast! I dream about making this even when it's not Thanksgiving. Highly recommended!

This is always a hit at Thanksgiving and never fails to convert even the most die-hard marshmallow topping lovers. I don't change a thing & just use any generic brand of cripy oatmeal cookies.

following the recipe direction to first cook the potatoes at 450 had my oven smoking like a house a-fire. I cut it down to 350 for the same recommended 1 1/2 hours and the potatoes came out perfect. Got the job done and saved energy. Good luck!!

This recipe was good, but not exceptional. I used the Mother's brand non-iced oatmeal cookies for ease. Tasty topping, not overly sweet, the ginger added a nice touch. I used Marmalade, not 'sweet' marmalade. I cut this in half and made a different recipe as well, which we all preferred in the end.

This is the quintessential sweet potato recipe! It has been a Thanksgiving staple in my house for years. I made it for a hospital Thanksgiving potluck a few years ago, and still get recipe requests. For the reviewer who wondered what kind of cookies to use -- I find very inexpensive crunchy oatmeal cookies work the best. You can find them on the bottom shelf in the cookie aisle in most super markets. I do not try to adjust any of the ingredients in this recipe as it is perfection! I do however, add 1/4 cup Grand Marnier to the sweet potato mixture and it takes this recipe over the top.

I really enjoyed this recipe, as did everyone else at the Thanksgiving table. Some folks thought the orange flavor was a bit much, though. Next time I'll omit the marmalade and just add some orange zest. I cut the sugar to 2 Tb of brown sugar plus 1 Tb of maple syrup.

This recipe brings out the flavor of the sweet potatoes without the addition of a lot of sugar. I used gingersnap cookies instead of oatmeal and next time, I will cook put potatoes in baking dish and then crumble topping on before refrigerating. Definitely will make again.

A HUGE hit! Everyone loved this so much, I'll definitely make it again. I increased the proportions because I had a dozen guests, but had plenty left over. The serving sizes must be very generous.

HELP! Mother's made the best oatmeal cookies for this recipe. They are now out of business - can't find good, crunchy oatmeal cookies at the market. Anyone know of a good substitute?

Make the day before! This is the most spectacular sweet potato recipe! I made it for Christmas to nothing but rave reviews from those at the table. I ground up a whole orange instead of adding OJ. Delicious! Also, having no oatmeal cookies, I ground up some oatmeal granola bars - no butter, and it was amazing! The oatmeal is the key ingredient. I also added the brown sugar sparingly - sweet potatoes are sweet already! This is the most amazing dish! Give it a try, you will not be sorry, especially if you make the day before to allow the flavors to present. AMAZING!!!

Guests thought this was great, I personally would try a different recipe next time just for something more interesting. It was very easy to make, and a great introduction of sweet potatoes for people who have never had them before.

Excellent - very sweet! If I were to change anything, I might take out a tablespoon or so of the sugar. As it was, they were a millimeter away from the "dessert" category. Still delicious, though!

I forgot to say that I used canned sweet potatoes to save time and they were still delicious. Also, instead of the orange marm. (which I think is bitter), I used honey and finely grated orange zest instead.

The reviews don't lie. This one is awesome. The ginger adds such a great flavor. I loved sweet potatoes, but this recipe makes them phenominal. Even people who have eaten the same old sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top each year loved this dish.

WOW!!this has got to be the best sweet potato dish i ever had & everyone at our thanksgiving table agrees...this is a keeper...the flavor of the fresh ginger ( i added a little more) & the orange marmalade add a terific taste...the cookie topping is so good i can't describe how we all loved this dish..

This is a recipe that will be an on going dish for thanksgiving.. as with all recipes... I make it my own... I did not use the orange juice and I used an entire 8oz jar of marmalade.. and splashed in jack daniels... THIS WAS HEAVENLY... the best we have ever had... I highly suggest this dish!

Rating: 4
Amazing! I was reluctant about the orange flavor - thought it might be too strong and almost cut it in half (the juice and marmalade) - same with the ginger, as I was making it for a picky crowd. Decided to stick to it (even added slightly more ginger) and am so glad I did! Rave reviews from everyone including my husband who "hates sweet potatoes". This will be a staple at Thanksgiving from now on.

This was delicious. I am not completely sold on the cookie topping, but it was very good. The sweet potatoes were the best I ever had. I added 2T of cognac and some Meyer lemon juice to perk the flavors up a bit. Thank you to the reviewer who stated that the ginger flavor was a bit agressive before baking. Mine was perfect before baking, so I added more ginger and OOOO mama this was perfect. By the way, I generally don't like sweet potatoes.

Perfect and the fact that my daughter loves to sprinkle the cookie crumbles on top helps make her feel like she's cooking, too. It really isn't hard to make at all and since this was my first Thanksgiving for the family, I was really happy with the results. My mother and husband (two of the most honest people when it comes to telling you what they think about food) couldn't stop telling everyone how good it was. Will absolutely have this around for a Thanksgiving tradition.

I'm not sure what the one desenting vote did wrong but I found that this had a great orange sweet potatoe flavor. And I made the recipe by mistake - wanting something chunker to contrast the mashed potatoes rather than a puree. Even in light of this I found it good enough to make again.

Very good addition to Thanksgiving dinner! Everyone could tell there was something "different " there. The orange and ginger hints were sooo good! The cookie topping was awesome! Will surely do again!

These sweet potatoes were so good, almost a dessert! I halved oranges, cut out the fruit (for later use, thought it could be added to the potatoes, but wanted to stick to the recipe), and filled with sweet potatoes, then topped with the cookie crumble. Baked until warm, and then I let the kids decorate them with 1/2 a cherry and a sprig of mint (parsley or any green would do). They were so delighted with "their" contribution. This recipe will be a Holiday tradition for us.

This is a wonderful, easy dish that I prepare year-round. I found the cookie topping a bit too sweet for my taste, so I now make it with a "streusel" mixture of nuts, butter & a little brown sugar. Delicious!

WOW!! This was awesome! A huge hit with my diner party and husband who normally hates heavily sweetened potatoes. The balance of marmalade and ginger was perfect. I added 1/4 cup of bourbon to this recipe to give it a kick and it was the best sweet potatoe recipe yet. I'll make it from now on. Here's a tip: if you taste the mixture before baking, don't be surprised if you can't taste the orange and you taste too much ginger, after you bake it the flavors EXPLODE and balance each other out perfectly.

A new Thanksgiving/Xmas tradition in our household! This dish was awesome. Not dry, not sticky and just the right amount of sweetness to go well with all the other trimmings. The topping didn't crumble as well as expected, but that didn't hurt the taste at all!

This dish was excellent. The orange flavor went very well with the sweet potatoes and the cookie crumb topping was a nice change. I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.

I am a fan of savory sweet potato dishes, and this leans more in that direction than many others. I would make it again in a minute as it is so unique, but would personally use less orange juice, perhaps a bit less brown sugar and a dash of pepper. As it is, the orange flavor nearly overpowers the potatoes. A word about the fourteen cookies: I bought what I though were 3inch cookies and ended up with enough oatmeal topping for 5 dishes, literally. A great, easy dish nonetheless!

I made these with Thanksgiving dinner, only with a different topping - I wasn't too fond of the oatmeal cookie idea. But, I must say this is a wonderful addition to a holiday meal or any meal. I used dried ginger rather than fresh without any problem.
