I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a lot of work with not great results. The taste of the bread overwhelmed the other ingredients. While they were pretty, no one came back for seconds and they didnt stay well. To much was tossed in the trash

I made this for Christmas Eve. dinner and followed the directions exactly and did not cheat by just using the pumpernickel squares. It looked great and the red was very Christmasy. Everyone oohed and aahed over how pretty they looked, ate one but no one came back for seconds! Very underwhelming as far as taste goes. The lemon zest seemed out of place and did not mesh well with the Boursin in my opinion.

I made this a second time for New Year's Eve. This year got a lot of raves from my guests. I used the square cocktail breads cut in half and it made the recipe easier to make, made them look better and in the end got better reviews than the year before.

I really liked this recipe but it is not something that you can let sit for an extended period

This was just kind of dull.

Yummy! Kind of a pain to cut everything into pretty little circles, but even if they don't look perfect, they taste great and are pretty quick to make.

Because I was in a huury, I modified the recipe slightly and I was glad. I roasted my own peppers and cut them in bite-sized pieces. I toasted the pumpernickel (using the small party bread)and did not cut off the crusts. I forgot to put the lemon zest and black pepper in the Boursin cheese and so I sprinkled it on top. It is a mild dish that has more taste a room temp. Very pleasing.

Different, delicious and a very eye appealing canape. I simplified just a little: used cocktail pumpernickel and did not remove the crusts or toast them (cream cheese was not moist enough to make them soggy); cut both red and yellow peppers (drained and dried well) into triangles and used both on each bread slice (very colourful); piped a rosette of the cream cheese mixture on top; added a slice or two of garlic (from the pepper jar) along with the almonds for garnish; otherwise followed the recipe. They disappeared quickly and were enjoyed by all. Definitely a make again recipe!

I've made this a couple of times and it's very good. The biggest "problem" is that it tends to be too tall to eat graciously if you're doing a fancy gathering. I've also used pumpernickel cocktail bread and just trimed the crusts and cut the peppers in squares and that saved some time but if you are planning to make it ahead you really do need to toast the bread or else it will sog. Happy New Year!
