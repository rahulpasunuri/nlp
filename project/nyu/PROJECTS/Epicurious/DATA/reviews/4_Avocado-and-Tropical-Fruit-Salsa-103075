be very careful when chopping jalapeno pepper - wear gloves or else your hands will burn for hours from the oil! other than that, this recipe was great. I used 1 mango, two kiwis for fruit and skipped the avocado.

This was extremely easy and delicious! I used all of the recommended fruits including kiwi, pineapple, mango, and papaya. I served this in place of regular guacamole for Fish Taco Tuesday! It was very popular with the whole dinner crew.

Delicious! Used pineapple and mango, cilantro, red onion, jalapeno and lime juice. Simple & delicious. Paired very well with a mexican themed menu to offset spicy offerings. Would definitely make again. Would work great as a fish topping too.

I used kiwi only and did not add a chili because I served the salsa as an accompaniment to very spicy jerk chicken. It was great! It was especially excellent with the jerk chicken. would love to make it again with the chili.

We cut out the avocado and used kiwi. Loved it!

I do this with mango, and I use red bell pepper instead of onion. The color combo is amazing, and the taste is refreshing on a hot evening!

Absolutely delicious. I made it the other night with the snapper. And while I can't handle the smell of the fish another night, I'm making the salsa again just 2 days later. I love this!

This salsa is so refreshing. Perfect with fish tacos. I used mango and pineapples. Fantastic!

I use all of the fruits listed, though one time I left out Pineapple and it still tasted wonderful. I use only 1 avocado, as 2 has seemed a little much. I also don't pay attention to measurements, just throw in one of each fruit with a handful of pineapple and 2 kiwi and it always turns out yummy! Great for summer BBQs.

definitely make it with avocado! Excellent with seafood and pretty good over pork

Delicious! I served this great salsa with the Macadamia nut crusted fish also on this site. I used Mango & Pineapple, lemon juice instead of the lime juice, left out the chile and used only one avacado. My guests had triple portions of this with their fish!

I used pineapple and mango with the avocado. Small dice and lovely colors made for a beautiful presentation. It was a lovely side dish that I paired with shrimp and cashew stir-fry with teriyaki sauce from this site. I also make a similar salsa with mango and cucumber which is refreshing. All ingredients are same but I substitute cuke for the avocado. Have also used nectarines instead of mangoes.

Yum Yum Yum. Have made this numerous times for fish tacos and just to savor with chips. It always gets rave reviews!! I have two sets of friends that when invited over always request the fish tacos! I make it with mango and papaya (ripe) and skip the avocado and other fruits. I think it is equally good the next day. Sometimes I forget to buy the serrano pepper, so I put in a little tobasco for the same effect. The touch of green is nicer though.

wonderful and unusual; used less lime juice and more fresh cilanto; great with black bean tortilla chips

I made this last night as an appetizer salsa and it was a flop so I came back to this site to see what I did wrong and I followed the recipe exactly. I used papaya, pineapple, kiwi, avocado, and the rest of the ingredients, and it just glued together in a glob. I did drain the papaya first so??? The other pineapple avocado salsa recipe on this sight is more of what I feel a salsa recipe should have the consistency of, and tastes better to me as well.

This recipe is capital BANG. I omitted pineapple, as I was also making a pineapple salsa separate from this. Made about a gallon for a 'hawaiian' wedding, went heavy on kiwi and avocado. Was sure to let mango hang out in a strainer first to reduce moisture(I only like ripe mango). Next time will add more papaya, it was so very pretty, also will add more chiles, as they get lost easily with increased avocado. Was eaten with gusto! The little bit left was good the next day, but far from stellar. These flavors want to be served immediately with minimal marriage/committment ceremony. Don't worry about the avocado browning, as the high acid kept it nice and green for me. Ooooh, you will like this. It even tastes good with other things (as opposed to right out of the bowl).

I was looking for a salsa recipe to accompany tortilla chips - I've never heard of or had a fish taco. This salsa is good for dipping - next time I'll try it for supper with a white fish fillet. I added finely diced red bell pepper for colour. Good flavour and great presentation. I made it a few hours ahead of time wondering if the avocado would discolour, but it didn't. It's a hit!

made this recipe with mangoes to accompany fish tacos. It was a huge hit, I'd definitely make it again!

I made this yesterday with Fish Tacos. Made it only with mango and avocado but it was delicious, had to add more lime juice and jalapeno pepper. Our tacos were great, the grilled fish, this awesome salad, a little bit of torn watercress, and a little bit of chipotle sour cream! Yum!

I made this salsa tonight, along with the crispy snapper tacos. It was incredible! What a perfect salsa for the extra warm evening we had tonight here on the Central Coast of California. I can't wait to make it again!

I made this salsa with the fish taco recipe that it accompanies and it was awesome! So good I have made it numerous times by itself or with other dishes. It is by far the best salsa I have ever had. Everyone left with the recipe. I always seem to need more lime but I like the flavor better with more of it! I have used combinations of the following in the salsa: mango, kiwi, tangerine, pineapple, nectarine, always use firm avacados, red onion and fresh jalenos. Wonderful recipe especially for spring/summer! Try it! You'll agree...

Love it, Love it, Love it! Excellent salsa... I served this over a caribbean jerk seasoned pork loin for a dinner party! People couldn't get enough of this salsa! I omitted the avocado only because the one I bought was too soft and didn't look as pretty as it should, but I will use it next time. I will make this salsa over and over again!

Refreshing salsa! I served it with chips and everyone loved it. The salsa looked very festive served in a pineapple boat. The only modification I would make next time is to add more chile.

This was great with jumbo prawns. I left out the papaya and added more pineapple, as well as half the avacado (I'm not a fan). I really enjoyed this very tasty condiment.

This was a HUGE hit at a tropical party we hosted. In fact, it was the first thing to disappear! It really has a surprisingly refreshing and zippy taste. We served it in 2 pineapple boats, which worked well. Make this and you'll look like a genuis :o)

This is a fabulous dish! I used a combination of all the fruits listed, added more fresh cilantro and a colorful combination of hot chile peppers. I served the salsa around a large wheel of brie with crackers and got rave reviews from my guests. You can not go wrong with this recipe!

This was delicious! I made it for a get together and served it as just regular, dipping salsa with chips. Everyone couldn't stop raving about how good it was and how fresh it tasted. It was so good, in fact, I'm making it again tonight to put over chicken. I made it with mango. I made it with all ingredients but avocado the night before (so it would be extra tasty), then added the avocado about a half hour before serving (so it wouldn't be brown). YUMMY!!!

Have made this many times always to copious compliments. Wonderful fresh flavours and lovely colours. Have on occasion omitted the pepper and added 1 clove of grated garlic. Have also added shredded crab - delicious. It is even good as a topping on fresh crusty French bread.

This was a really big hit. I served it with fish and had so much left over, I started designing other dishes around it so it wouldn't go to waste!

I rarely give a 4 rating, but this deserved it. I grilled halibut fillets using glaze on "Glazed Grilled Salmon" recipe. I served the halibut with this salsa using pineapple, kiwi and mango. It was out of this world good!

This is definitely a HIT!! Used Pineapple, Kiwi, Mango. Took as added dish to a Fajita Dinner. It was gone before we had the Fajita's! The guys especially loved it. Made it again with avocado. Didn't make much difference except texture. Flavor was the same. Will make again!!

I used mango, papaya and pineapple. It was delicioius served with grilled chicken breast basted with yoshida sweet and sour sauce. Even great the next day in chicken salad. Will try it with Halibut next.

I made this recipe with peaches, mangos and pineapple, no avocados and served on grilled halibut tacos. The salsa was even better the next day (the little bit that was left!).

I thought that this salsa ws fabulous and so did my guests. I used pineapple and mango. The flavors seemed to compliment each other very well.The avocado added just te right tang to the sweetness of the fruits. Loved it!!

We made this recipe twice; once with mango and once with pineapple. The mango flavor came through and was enhanced by the other ingredients. The pineapple flavor was greatly diminished but the total experience was still delicious. We'll make them both again.
