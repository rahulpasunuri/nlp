I always crave these as soon as the weather turns cooler, they're my favorite Fall cookie and I love the way they make the house smell! I do add a whole t of cloves and a bit more cinnamon to the mix. I made tablespoon sized balls using a tablespoon measure (instead of eyeballing) and cooked at 375 for 8.5 mins, cooled on the sheet for 5 mins, then removed to a wire rack. They were perfectly soft!

This recipe works well for a tasty ginger snap. I was looking for a sugar cookie recipe with the same texture and this works well if you replace the regular shortening with butter flavored Crisco; use 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar; replace the molasses with white caro; replace the cinnamon, gloves and ginger with 1 teaspoon vanilla.

I'm not a fan of ginger bread, cookies or snaps. I found these cookies easy to make, though, with no substitutions, and quite tasty. They were not overwhelming in spices-which is why I shy away from most cookies with ginger and molasses in them. These were good, though, and done in 10 minutes. I like the way they baked-into a nice cracked cookie from a ball. This may well become my new go-to recipe when my husband craves a ginger/molasses cookie because I'll eat them too.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I substituted one stick of butter for the shortening since I was out and they turned out amazingly! The cookies are 2 days old and still have a wonderful chewy texture (baked for 8.5 minutes). I would describe the taste to be between a sugar cookie and a gingerbread cookie. So wonderful. I plan to make many batches of these over the holiday season to bring to family and friends' events.

Everyone in my family loves these cookies. I like a chewier cookie, so I removed them from the oven right at 10 minutes. They cooled on the cookie sheet (set on a cooling rack) for 5 minutes before transfering them to a cooling rack alone. They were perfect!

I forgot to mention that I used Turbinado Sugar (Sugar in the Raw) for dipping the balls of dough in. We tried granulated sugar also and liked the Turbinado much better.

These were great made just as the recipe stated. I will make these again and again. They were in the refrigerator more than an hour. Don't know if that matters. Enjoy!

I was running very low on brown sugar so I substituted about half with white. The cookies came out a little on the sweet side, but had very good flavor and were great overall. I'm confident that with all brown sugar, they would be even better. Would definitely make again.

I have made this recipe for years now every fall. I use my leaf cookie cutters and they are always a big hit. I definitely watch the cooking time to keep them a bit chewy.

They were good spice cookies but I suppose now I wanted more of just a sugar cookie. However there are also better spice cookie recipes on this website. I would suggest cutting the baking soda in half and using baking powder to make up the difference to avoid that gross baking soda taste

I tried these because I am a cookie monster who was recently forced onto a dairy-free diet. (No butter pretty much means no cookies!) Even though I'm craving cookies like crazy, these did not do the trick for me. They were technically fine (no problems with the way the recipe was written), but the flavor was average or below. They are crunchier than your average cookie because of the veg shortening - so when I bake the next few, I'll cook them for less than 10 minutes; maybe that will help. But it won't make up for the unspectacular flavor. I'll finish up baking the rest of the batch, but sadly I doubt I will make them again.

Thees are my new favorite cookies! We did bake them for 9 minutes and served them with milk. If you like a very tasty cookie, this is the best one you will have!

These cookies are AMAZING! I've been looking for a good chewy gingerbread cookie recipe and this one is fabulous. The flavors are great and and the ginger is not too overpowering like some other recipes I've tried.

This is an excellent recipe. I'm not a huge fan of molasses, so I used half honey and half molasses. I also didn't have cloves, so I used allspice. I was too impatient to refrigerate the dough for an hour, so I froze the dough while I washed dishes. I baked the cookies for about 9 minutes, and the results were delicious, chewy, spicy goodness.

I loved this recipe. It was very easy and my guests thought they were delicious. I would make this one again for sure.

I made these for a group study tonight. The recipe made 36 small to med. size cookies. I added honey instead of molasses and omitted the cloves. They had perfect consistency and taste.

Just o.k. If you like ginger and more spice, the ginger cookies on this site are delicious. (The recipe has a picture attached w/ apples, cookies, and cheddar)

these are delicious! i made them for an office party and everyone raved. be sure not to overbake them. my first batch was about twelve cookies and they were too crisp. since they're already brown, they're deceiving. i just took the chewy ones to the party and everyone asked for the recipe. they thought this was an old family secret and were shocked that i found it on epicurious and that this was my first time making them!

Rating: 4
The recipie was good as it, but a little too gingerbready for me. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and none of the other spices and I thought those were great. I also cooked them just under 10 minutes and did not chill them and they were wonderfully chewy. This is a good recipie to adjust to your personal tastes.

Really, really good. Easy, too. Ten minutes was right in my oven -- twelve minutes was too long. Yum yum!

I didn't have time to refrigerate the dough and, since I wanted a chewy cookie, I set the oven at 350 and left the cookies in for 7 minutes. They came out very soft and chewy. A perfect molasses cookie, not too heavy, good balance of spices and molasses taste.

Rating: 4
replaced ginger and cloves with more cinnamon since I deal with really picky eaters. they turned out fantastic. not too gingerbread-like (as stated by a couple of other reviewers) even with the molasses.

Rating: 3
These were incredible cookies! I thought that I had molasses, but realized too late that I didn't, so I used corn syrup instead. They still turned out amazing. I think that the molasses would make these crispy gingersnaps, which I'm happy about because I've been searching for a good recipe. I like my cookies crispy, so I kept them in the oven a minute or two longer. Oh, and these cookies turn out picture perfect!

It was delicious. The only thing i did different is lower the temperature to 350, and bake for about 9 minutes for chewy cookies. I will definetly make it again.

Rating: 3
The recipe is easy to follow and the result is delicious!!! Instead of setting the oven to 375, i set it to 350. Lower temperature allow me time and opportunity to get the result that i want from the cookies since it was my first time. Overall, it was great. I will definely make it again.

I have a cranky oven so I set the temperature at 350 degrees and baked the cookies for 9 minutes. They turned out fine. I will use less salt and more spices the next time, and I may add some almonds for texture. Otherwise...yummy. It smelled like Christmas in my house last night.

Made 3 batches over the Thanksgiving holiday. Wonderful cookies, especially with some of the minor changes other cooks suggested - increase ginger and cinnamon to 1 1/2+ teaspoons, cloves to a heaping half teaspoon and decrease salt to 1/8 teaspoon. Made the cookies twice using all molasses and once using half molasses-half honey. Both are wonderful, gingerbread taste is more subtle with the honey substitute. Baked for 9-10 minutes for a cookie that stayed soft after cooling. These will definitely be on my Christmas platters. Everyone loved them!

Yum! I doubled the ginger and cinnamon, and added a little extra ground cloves. I baked my cookies 8-1/2 minutes, which was plenty in my oven. These are so good. You might want to consider doubling the dough, maybe freeze or fridge some for later baking, OR just bake a double batch to begin with! I liked a couple of the suggestions to use orange or fall-colored sugar for rolling the cookie dough in before baking. I'll try that next time.

I'm only 11 years old and I made these with the help of my Aunt. They were the most delicious cookies I have ever had. I agree with the other cooks - use honey instead of molasses and change the spice amounts, otherwise they are too spicy tasting. They were so good!

This recipe was awesome!! My family loved it!! I followed the suggestions and doubled the cinnamon and ginger, added only a pinch of salt, and added some honey with my molasses. It worked great!! Chilling the dough before cooking kept the cookies round and puffy. I think that the perfect baking time is 10 minutes for chewy cookies. I will definately make these again in the future and freeze them. One batch is not enough!!

I brought these camping with us over Memorial Day weekend with a bunch of friends. They were the hit of the weekend and now our friend Larry calls weekly to see if I'll make more of the "Li'l Brown Cookies" for him. If he's been a good boy, he gets 'em.... ;) I increased the cinnamon and ginger to a 1/2 TBSP each, cloves to a tsp. and it turned out stupendous! FABOO recipe!

Well, I'll just join in the fray here and give these cookies more high praise. I'm one of those "don't like ginger snaps" types, but these cookies are great. They're not exactly up my aisle in terms of favorite type of cookie, but for spice cookies, they're fabulous.

these eere lovely to look at and tasted amazing. this might be the best cookie recipe i've found on this site, along with aunt sis's strawberry tart cookies. but i'd note that these are not sugar cookies by any standard - just phenomenal molasses cookies. i made mine into rounded tablespoons and baked for exactly 10 min. - perfect.

I made these cookies several times in high school, lost the recipe and looked for it for almost a decade! Incredibly, it is just as good as I remember. I agree about cutting the baking time back a bit, and don't omit the granulated sugar step, it is well worth it. Be careful, as people will demand that you make these again!Oh, and thanks very much to Paula from Brazil, below--I tried it w/ honey instead of molasses, and many people liked it even better!

Wonderful and so easy! First time I tried the recipe, I doubled up, and they were gone in 2days-since then, I have made another 2 bathces to keep up with demand. These cookies are fabulous compared to the preparation time. I agree with other cooks; undercook the cookies (perfect is 7-8min), and cut the salt in half, and double the ginger and cinnamon. Perfect for the holidays!

Fabulous. I dipped mine in orange and brown Autumn colored sprinkles for a Fall look. I agree with the other reviewer about cutting down on the cooking time as well.

My dough came out like that "rough, shaggy mass" you need for a pie or graham cracker crust, so I added a second egg. The dough is chilling, and I am not sure what the egg will do to the finished product. Has this happened to anyone else?

These are really easy to make and delicious. Whenever I make them they're gone in a few hours. Since I like spicy cookies, I double the amount of ginger and cinnamon. Another tip : where I live it's a little hard to find molasses, so sometimes I use honey instead and it works just as well.

I started making this recipe in 1991. Now that I have children, it is their favorite!

This is a great winter holiday cookie. I also agree that you should cut down or omit the salt since it tends to maske the spice flavor. I would under bake them a minute or two, otherwise you end up with cookie briquettes.

I have made these wonderful cookies at the holidays for years and years. Mine come out on the chewy side and even the folks who say "I hate gingersnaps" come back for more. I've kept the dough well-wrapped in the refrigerator for a couple of days when baking time ran out and they're still just as delicious.

I would definitely make this again. The dough was really simple to make, the dough works really well if its kept chilled. I cut the amount of cloves in have, using only a 1/4 teaspon instead of 1/2 teaspoon. I think next time I will omit the salt. I usually dont put salt in cookies cause I can taste the salt more than the spice. Its quick and easy to make these cookies.

I made these on a blustery afternoon and was thrilled by the results. Underbaked just a tad so that they were chewy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it was hard to stop at two (okay, maybe three). Perfect flavor, not too spicy, and I rolled the entire dough ball in sugar with great results.

This recipe has been in my family for over 30 years. Instead of dipping each cookie in granulated sugar before baking, my recipe instructions say to sift powdered sugar over cookies as soon as they are placed on cooling racks. The powdered sugar makes them very festive as a Christmas cookie.
