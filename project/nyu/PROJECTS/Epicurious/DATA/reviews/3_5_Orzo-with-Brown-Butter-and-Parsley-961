I was surprised at how good this dish was. I added salt at the end and only used half the amount of butter. I finished it with a few tablespoons of white truffle oil which really put it over the top with the nuttiness from the butter and the earthy truffle flavor. Not overpowering, just yummy. I am making it for a dinner I am making again Saturday night for a dinner party.

I like using beef broth better, less butter & more garlic. Always a favorite with my husband.

I haven't tried this recipe, but I make something very similar wherein I first brown the orzo in the butter which gives it a toasted flavor and then I add the stock. I do not add nutmeg to mine.
