I doubled for a party using 2 cans small white beans, 1 can small red kidney beans and two cans black beans. i used 1/3 cup brown sugar and substitutedred wine vinegar. I also added 1 T dijon mustard, 1 T worcestershire sauce and 1 t smoked paprika. Simmered in crock pot a few hours. Brought them to a party and they were devoured. I also doubled the amount of bacon Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Sweet-and-Smoky-Barbecue-Beans-5494#ixzz25SJM5re4

Really good, easy and fast to make. I do agree to leave it cook for a while so the sauce thickens up. Made it for a summer party and everyone wanted to take the leftovers. A keeper!

Best bean sauce I have found & hubs liked too. Very similar to Bush's Baked Beans, but better. I cooked longer, thanks to comments, & got a nice thick sauce & well flavored beans.

the sauce is good - make sure to make this dish way ahead so that the beans absorb the flavor - otherwise you end up with bean tasting beans sitting in a sweet sauce.

Good recipe, but is lacking some heat. I'm positive it could use a teaspoon or two of chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I used canned beans and admit it's super easy to just throw the canned beans in, but I'd bet cooked dried beans would be better. I find canned beans a bit mushy.

fast, easy...delicious. one of those goof-proof recipes that tastes like a lot of effort went into it. plus, you can make it early in the day, or a day ahead, preparing it up to the final uncover/simmer/thickening stage, and then finish it right before serving. big hit. i followed the recipe exactly, but i can see how you can pull it off with only two cans of beans. all you need to do is let the sauce thicken (reduce) a little more and serve it with a slotted spoon. the sauce is thick enough to coat the beans. i'll definitely make it again.

These were so easy but very good. In fact they were just as good hot or cold and better the 2nd day.

My family loves this recipe and it is so easy. I generally follow the recipe as written. When doubling, I will substitute one can of Butter Beans for one of the Canellini. I will leave out the bacon when serving vegetarians, but it is yummier with the bacon and one slice for the whole recipe is not too bad for us. Enjoy.

So easy. And the reduced sugar as suggested works fine.

Rating: 3
Great! Followed the 'reduced sugar, reduced beans' advice.

Rating: 3
This recipe was great! I cut down the sugar to 2 - 3 tablespoons of sugar and omitted a can of beans like other reviewers suggested. I also used two strips of bacon (center cut) and two teaspoons of sweet spicy mustard. The consistency was perfect, not too runny and not too thick.

I turned this into a diabetic/veggie friendly dish by omitting the bacon and useing brown sugar flavored Splenda and cuting the molasses in half. I also made the additions suggested by others regarding the onions and hot sauce and increased the time in the crock pot. I tasted it now and then till I liked what I had. Even the non-daibetic folk liked this, they couldn't tell that it was altered.

My husband and I thought this was excellent. Following a combination of suggestions from other reviewers, I left out one can of beans and halved the brown sugar, and the end result was very tasty and not too sweet. Wow! Finally, a dish in which blackstrap molasses are truly delicious!

I have made this recipe many times since it came out in 98 I think it was. I made it again this summer and again, everyone loves it. It's really simple to make and for "beans" it's a great dish and a crowd pleaser!

For almost a 4 fork rating, I expected much more from this recipe. I added the extra onion and bacon to spice it up as others suggested and was still disappointed. I would say this wasn't much better that what I would get from just opening a can. Don't think I'll be making this one again.

As the other reviewers have tweaked this recipe, it's gone from very good to an outstanding sweet and savory side, or would be a great lunch served with cornbread. As suggested, I doubled the onion (I used red onion) and garlic; reduced the mustard to one-half teaspoon; and added 1 tsp. chili powder and 1/4 tsp. Tabasco. The sweetness needs that subtle heat to allow all the flavors through. For my own further tweakage, I used chicken broth instead of water, and when I seasoned at the end I started with hickory smoked salt, adding until just smoky enough, and then finished with regular salt and fresh ground pepper. Absolutely do season to taste before serving - needs the S & P. This dish would accompany any barbecue very well. I served it with grilled smoked turkey breast pizza.

Everyone loved the beans, but I followed suggestions (twice the onion, garlic, more vinegar, salt...) so the recipe itself isn't perfect. I also added ancho powder, chili powder and chipolte tobasco sauce. Left the beans in the crock pot all day so that the beans really absorbed the flavor. I don't think that cooking them as long as the recipe suggested would give you a really flavorful bean, just flavorful sauce. I will make my version of the beans again, as everyone liked them, and are definelty a nice change from the canned beans usually served at a barbeque.

I love these beans and the mix of the different varieties makes for a pretty color not your basic brown beans. I always put 3 or 4 slices of bacon in it but I love bacon. Next time, I might just put 1/2 t. of mustard as it was overpowering the rest of the flavors a little...and I might try some finely chopped red bell pepper.

These are the best beans ever! We like spicy foods so I added a dash of tabasco and lots of pepper. Also, while more bacon and onion enhanced the dish, I wouldn't recommend adding too much more brown sugar or molasses as the beans already have a sweet taste to them.

I loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again. Very tasty - I added more bacon, which I cooked till very crisp. I really liked the crunch of the bacon with the beans.

Rating: 4
Loved them. Like other reviewers I added 1c. onions and more bacon. But I used bac-o bits...blasphamy for the meat eater but as a veggie I've discovered that they have a great flavor if used in recipes. They help to impart a bit of smoky bacon flavor. This will go in my permanent file!

After making these several times I agree with all the other reviewers, they are terrific. I do increase the bacon to 4 slices, the onion to 1 cup, and the vinegar to 3 tbsp because we prefer more pronounced flavors.

I would never again go through the process of soaking beans overnight and cooking them all day. I did add 3 strips of bacon and a little more vinegar.

Followed the advice of earlier rate givers...extra onion, worcestershire sauce...Cooked for an hour. Needed extra liquid on the reheat of the beans. An excellent flavor all around. Will definitely make again. Served them with Spareribs with Pineapple-Mustard barbecue Sauce, from the July 1992 issue. Salad and cornbread as well.

This is VERY good. I usually cook it for a total of an hour so it thickens considerably, but haven't deviated in any other fashion. We love it.

I found these beans a little bland, so I added a bit more vinegar, brown sugar and some worcestershire. I made them a day ahead for a family BBQ to go with ribs. Everyone liked them, but next time, I think I'll add more bacon, more onion and just a smidge of hot sauce to punch up the flavor. Still, I will try them again.

We served this at a 75th birthday and everyone loved them! I will definitely serve them again.

This is a wonderful bean recipe. I also added some red pepper for a little kick, but I think the flavor is excellent without it too.

Rating: 2
These weren't special at all. They also needed to simmer much longer than the time indicated for the beans to absorb the flavor of the sauce.

I omitted the bacon to make a vegetarian version. This is a great weeknight recipe because you can put it together so quickly. My husband and I enjoyed it very much. I'll definitely make this one again!!

Rating: 4
to make this vegetarian, i didn't use bacon. I used hot pepper oil for flavor and added cajun spice mix (red pepper, salt, etc.) for some kick. I also used garbanzo beans and served the entire stew over rice. It was a great blend of sweet and spicy.

Rating: 3
At first, the sauce didn't seem too great but once the beans were added, it all came together. The sauce definitely needs salt. I thought this was extremely delicious. I added 2 chipotle peppers and about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. I don't agree w/ the person who said it serves more than 4 however. This will become a permanent part of my repetoire.

Rating: 3
This recipe definitely serves more than four. It was really good but better if made in advance. A great addition to any buffet.

This dish is wonderful for a cookout. They taste much like my grandmother's traditional baked beans, but they're a LOT easier and much faster. And I just love the combination of the different types of beans.

We used this recipe at a neigborhood deck party with a barbecue theme. Everyone loved it. We liked the sauce so much that Bob, the creative one, created a recipe using it - sort of a Tex-Mex Lasagne.

This recipe is a hit every time I prepare it! I've tried different combinations of beans, and adding a bit more bacon. The sauce is great.

Very good. I made them ahead of time for a family gathering. They were a little "soupy" so they benefitted from being warmed a second time. Great side dish for a cookout -- and very easy.

This recipe is quick and easy, yets tastes like the beans baked all day. Delicious with corn bread made in a skillet. Be sure that your canned beans are of the best quality.
