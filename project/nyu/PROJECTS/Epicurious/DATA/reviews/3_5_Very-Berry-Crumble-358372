Certainly not bad, but far from great. Made for a party and all enjoyed, but I was disappointed...

This recipe is perfect for those times when you need a great homemade dessert at a moments notice. With no oats or almonds on hand I substituted with the granola cereal from my cupboard. No ramekins? Use a frozen pie crust or a glass dish. From freezer to table in a couple of hours with no more than 30 minutes needed for prep and bake time - combined. Thawing the fruit on my counter was the most difficult step. This was the simplest dessert I have ever made and it received the most compliments! It has become my Go-To dessert.

This. Is. Epic. I rarely give 4 forks but this was so easy to make and taste delicious! I had to go back for more. I can't believe it's in the "healthy" section.

This is really good; I made it as one big dish, and will make extra topping next time (I know, I know, that makes it not as healthy...). It's not too sweet in the best way and it's a great way to make a fruit dessert off-season. It got raves from my guests.

This is great! Very tasty and extremely healthy. A wonderful use of late summer berries. And if there are leftoves, although not likely cause they're yummy, each individual ramkin reheats great. I made these for a BBQ and they were a hit.
