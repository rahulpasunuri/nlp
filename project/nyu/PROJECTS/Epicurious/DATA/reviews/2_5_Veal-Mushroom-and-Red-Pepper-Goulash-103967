Wow! That was rich! Full flavor galore. I am nearly 50 and grew up on goolash. My grandparents migrated on boats back in 1920 from Austria-Hungary. Now, they loved to cook, but I must say, "This recipe produced flavor that was creme de la creme". The aromatics are identical to my grandmothers, the flavor was a level above. Yummylicious!!

I am Hungarian and have eaten and cooked goulash all my life. I just read this recipe and based on the ingredients already I would not bother with it. It just simply does not have much in common with goulash. I agree with Katizka's Dad, there is no tomato and definitely no roasted peppers or mushrooms in thr real stuff. The meat on the picture looked very anemic. It needs a lot of paprika, the quality of which is the key for any Hungarian dish. Just to note also that there are two kinds of goulash. One is a stew and this dish only contains meat, onion, paprika and salt. The other one is goulash soup, which has meat, carrots, parsnip, onions, potatoes, paprika, salt and little dumplings (called nokedli).

Just a couple thoughts for those who found it bland: whenever my family makes 'goulash' we always add caraway seed, use a less expensive cut of beef rather than veal, and I think the comments about adding additional paprika sound right. And, according to my Hungarian born father, tomato of any kind would not be a traditional addition to this stew... but, not having ever stepped foot in that part of the world, I'm no expert :)

I didn't have dried mushrooms, so I stewed the other ingredients in chicken broth. Per others' suggestions, I doubled the paprika. After stirring in the egg noodles, sour cream, and fresh dill suggested in the recipe header, we had a delicious, hearty, one dish meal. I served with a simple green salad. My only complaint is that it dirtied an awful lot of dishes (pot for stew, another for noodles, another for sauteeing mushrooms) for a peasant food type of dish.

Using only 1 TBS of paprika would never rate this dish as "Hungarian" as a minimum of 2 plus 1/2 to 1 of hot paprika would be needed

I love this dish, however, I did make some changes. First, I used white mushrooms, and sauteed them with the onions. I increased the onions by 1/2, as well as the paprika. I also add dash of cayenne, which perks it up quite a bit.

Great comfort food. I used beef instead of veal but will try veal next time. The cremini mushrooms are awesome in this. As many said, it's not knock-your-socks-off, but definitely a tasty, hearty dish that'll stick to your ribs. I made mine with 'Knodel' - German dumplings (you can get them at Cost Plus). Mmmmm.

I made this for dinner/bridge and got great comments. Served it with the minature French lasagne pasta. I will make this again and freeze to have on short notice for company

I served it over plain polenta with green beans and a dollop of sour cream. It was devine! I made a couple of changes. I didn't have any dried mushrooms, so I soaked a mushroom bullion cube in 2 cups of boiling water. I used only one cup of the broth along with a cup of beef broth and a helf cup of red wine. I also added about half a cup of finely chopped shitake caps and portobello stems at the point where you add the broth and mushrooms. I was a little heavy handed with the paprika and tomato paste. My husband and I both agree that this is a keeper!

My family found the dish too spicey - which seems funny when reading the other comments. I used less paprika than called for - but maybe I used a hot rather than sweet paprika. The meat was very tender - but it seemed like a lot of work - also the mushrooms make it an expensive dish.

Definitely a winter dish. Serve with mashed potatoes and maybe applesauce. Don't know about the mushrooms though.

delightful and tastey

Given the previous comment about this dish being bland, I added extra garlic and used a "heavy hand" when adding pepper. This turned out to be a nice dish for a cold winter's evening, but I'm not sure it was special enough to bother with again.

I made this recipe for the second time last night, and once again the whole family loved it. Hard to find a dish that the kids like also. The roasted peppers take this dish above and beyond delicious

This sounded good but it was very bland. It really needs some spice. Too bad with all the great ingredients. I served it with the Savory Cabbage, Carrot, & Apple Salad which I wouldn't recommend either.
