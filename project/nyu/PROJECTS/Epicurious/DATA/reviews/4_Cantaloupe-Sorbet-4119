As written, this recipe doesn't work and lacks flavor. If you leave the mixture in the freezer overnight, you end up with a rock-hard block that you can only dig into after you let it thaw naturally or in the microwave. The recipe is little more than a mildly flavored snow cone. I started out with a very large, fairly flavorful and very juicy cantaloupe that yielded 5 1/2 cups of puree. I figured the puree needed help from the get go, so based on other reviewers' suggestions, I added 9 T lime juice, the zest of 1 1/2 large limes, and only 1/2 cup 1:1 sugar syrup. Then I added 4 large basil leaves minced with a jalapeno pepper. (I give credit for the flavoring ideas to some mango sorbet I had in NYC.) Oh, and instead of following the directions, I cooled the sugar syrup quickly in an ice water bath. I took half of my flavored puree and ran it for 15 minutes in a Salton ice cream maker, which gave me a cold, thick mash in 15 minutes. After one day in the freezer, though, the slushy was rock solid and lacked flavor. Based on those results, I added to the remaining puree a little more sugar syrup, juice of another small lime, another minced jalapeno pepper, and a shot of white rum. Now the flavor was kicked up to a more interesting notch and the sorbet ended up not so rock hard. Much better this way, but hardly the same recipe.

I make this again and again. There is no cooler dessert for summer. Many compliments and requests for the recipe.

Wonderful! I'm making it for the second time. It helps to have a very ripe, flavorful cantaloupe. I added a few mint leaves to the sugar-water as it boiled. It added a lovely touch!

I simplified this recipe by adding the fresh cantaloupe into the cooling sugar/water. I did not freeze the sugar water separately as the recipe asked for. And, it was still delicious. I simply let the canaloupe/sugar/water mix cool completely and then transferred it into my little old Donvier ice cream maker and gave it a crank every few minutes until 20 minutes was up. I left it in the maker until after dinner and it was exactly the right consistency. Also, I used only 1/2 cup sugar because it is july and we have super sweet melons right now here, and it was still plenty sweet enough. I will make this again every summer! And, it only takes a few minutes to make this way.

If you love cantaloupe, you HAVE to make this! I used it as a palate brightener between my fish course and my lamb course. It was perfect!

Absolutely delicious. I used an overripe cantaloupe that was too far gone to eat fresh but was perfect for this recipe. Forgot to take the sorbet out of the freezer when only partially frozen. The next day I chopped it up and blended it in food processor until creamy - it needed to melt a bit. Added a squeeze of lime. I have had trouble with sorbets being "icy" but this was more like ice cream!

Awesome! I used a whole melon but only half the sugar. Perfect. I kept the melon rind "bowls" and froze the sorbet into the cantaloupe shells. Served with mint whipped cream. My guests were very impressed!

Sorbet is sooo easy to make and this recipe is no exception. I fudged on the times all over the place and it still came out just fine. I really liked the light, delicate flavor the cantaloupe gives the sorbet. I would definately make this again and not just when I have a too soft melon on my hands.

I used a large overripe melon which yielded about 4 cups. I froze both the syrup and puree in freezer for about 30 minutes and then combined. I added the juice of one lime at that time which really enhanced the flavor. I froze this for 3-4 hours only stirring once. (next time if I am able I would mix more often) After three hours this was partially frozen with a number of big icy chunks that needed to be pureed with the mixeer (note to the readeer who felt the sorbet was icy chunks...you must mix this frozen mixture until it is like a frozen puree) I think overnight would be too much and you would have to partially defrost to get the right mixing consistancy. I then froze until dessert time (3 hours) and it was terrific. Next time I will try with 1/4 cup sugar to reduce calories....especially since the cantalope was ripe. I figured a 1/2 serving was only 35 calories!

I used a large too ripe melon that yielded about 4 cups puree I used 1/2 cup sugar and added the juice of 1 lime to the puree. I put the puree and syrup in freezer for 30 min and then combined. I stirred only once in 3 hours. Took out of freezer and it seemed mostly frozen and had to break apart some of the big chunks. Mix until it seems like a frozen puree.....(Note to the reader who said their sorbet was ice chunks..must get rid of all frozen chunks in the mixing stage) I put in freezer for another 3 hours. Terrific. It was pretty sweet so next time I will only use 1/4 cup of sugar to try to reduce calories...especially with an overripe melon. I will try with other fruits since it is so simple to prepare....and what a hostess with a homemade sorbet!

a WONDERFUL sorbet and dessert! i added a splash of lime to the mixture as someone else suggested and it added a lot of pep to the flavor (though it would have been fine on its own). also, if you freeze the puree overnight, it will become a solid block by morning, so you will want to set it out to soften before you do the final puree! the one significant change i made was to add LESS simple syrup to teh cantaloupe mixture, about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. so healthy and delicious! i will definitely be making this again.

Used a spearmint syrup I already had made up in the fridge for this-- I think the mint complements the melon nicely. I used my ice cream maker to freeze it. Very tasty. I think the lemon or lime juice others suggested would be a nice addition, too-- something to cut the sweetness a little. Didn't have any lemons on hand today, though.

It's so simple to make, and tastes great! I also used a little lime juice as suggested by another reviewer came out very yummy. The second time I used this recipe, instead of cantaloupe I used raspberries and a little bit of orange juice.

I've used and loved Epicurious for a long time and made some wonderful meals from this website, however I never felt moved to review a recipe until this one. This is an amazing, low tech, DELICIOUS sorbet. I've always been under the impression a homemade sorbet is time consuming and tricky -- this was my first (but not last!) foray into homemade sorbets! Lime is essential (I used the juice of 1.5 limes). I don't have a big mixer, so used a hand mixer instead with excellent results--great texture. You must try this one!

A delish(!) recipe - used 1/2 TBsp. less sugar & added 1-1/2 TBsp. lime juice (TX to previous reviewers). I, definitely, give it 3-1/2 forks as can never jusify giving any dish the 4 forks "beyond compare" .. isn't that why we cooks expend so much time and energy searching for, but not yet finding, The Ultimate Dish??

This was very good. The cantaloupe I used was super ripe, so the sorbet was a little too sweet for my taste--next time I'll use less sugar. I added the juice of one lime to the mix, but couldn't taste it very well--next time I'll use two. I left it in the freezer overnight for the last freeze and it came out a little too hard. Next time I will put it in the processor or fluff it up with the beater before serving. Still, the cantaloupe flavor is wonderful and intense and it was a lovely dessert for a summer evening.

Absolutely luscious.....what a refreshing sorbet and a great way to use cantaloupe. I did add extra lime. This is also easy.

Round one, made it just as is with ripe cantaloupe and the flavor couldn't be more intense. Fast and wonderful. Round two, I'll try the reviewers suggestions to add a touch of lemon or lime.

Heaven! Used a almost-ready-to-throw-out cantaloupe, sugar syrup and juice of 1 lime. (My cantaloupe yielded exactly 3 cups.) Chilled the sugar syrup and pureed cantaloupe separately for 30 minutes then combined it and poured it in a Cuisinart ice cream maker. 20 minutes later -- the most delicious sorbet I've ever had! Recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great way to use a disappointing melon. I bought one that smelled, looked, and felt great but had very litle flavor. Not wanting to waste it, I tried it in this recipe with great results. The degree of sweetness was fine and the melon flavor came through beautifully. I added the lime as suggested and am glad I did. Tis is definitely a "keeper!"

I highly recommend the addition of fresh lime juice; if you find cantaloupe a little bland, it gives a nice pick-me-up to the flavor. It was plenty sweet, so I plan to use less sugar next time. I agree with the reviewer who said it's easier than it sounds... it's really no trouble. To the cook who didn't like the texture, maybe you could hit it with the mixer an additional time or two while it's freezing?

This is really excellent. I used 3 small cantaloupes that had started to soften and the juice of 3 small limes added to the pureed fruit. I did not increase the sugar or water. This is a good way to use fruit that may be past its prime.

The flavor is out-of-this-world, but the texture was less than perfect. I tried fluffing this with a mixer as directed, and there were still chunks of ice/cantaloupe. It turned out to have a consistency of a snowcone. Is that how it's supposed to be? Maybe I didn't mix it well enough? I also thought it was a little on the sweet side, but then again, I used a small cantaloupe.

I made this with a few modifications that turned it into something even more delicious than the original: add the juice of two limes and a teaspoon of orange flower water to the pureed fruit, then freeze as directed. The result is slightly perfumy with the tart lime juice offsetting the cantaloup's fragrant sweetness just perfectly. An ambrosian dessert!

This outrageously delicious recipe has become a family favorite. Although it does little justice to the elegance of this desert, here is a case in point: my younger brother once ate half a recipe's worth in one sitting and then asked for more notwithstanding the 'brain freeze.'

A great summer dessert. I have made it many times, but always lose the magazine. I'm putting it into my new recipe box.

Extremely easy to prepare and impressive! The portion of sugar syrup is sufficient for an entire cantaloupe. The syrup cooling stage does not take 2 hours - 10 or 15 minutes will suffice. After beating the frozen mixture, I placed it into the empty cantaloupe shell halves which I had frozen, and hollowed out the center just befor serving to give it an authentic melon appearance, then sliced it as I would a melon. I plan to try this with honeydew and other melons when they come into season.
