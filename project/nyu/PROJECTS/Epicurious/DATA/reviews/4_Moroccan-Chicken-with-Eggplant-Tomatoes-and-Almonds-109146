Yummy and quick! We used smoked paprika and it gave it a fresh-from-the-hearth taste. We're definitely going to put this one in the monthly rotation until we perfect it!

Ehh. Far less flavorful than I'd anticipated, and I increased the spice count to begin with. Not bad, but certainly not something I'll rush out and make again. The Moroccan beef stew is a much better bet.

This is delicious and pretty easy to make. I used chicken breasts because that's all I had. I didn't use the water and didn't drain the tomatoes.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I had a split breast and 4 legs, on the bone, skin on. Browned them first, then continued with the vegetables. The flavor combination was excellent, although I forgot to add cinnamon, as per other reviews, and I think it would have taken the flavor over the top. I'll definitely add it next time. It made a huge amount of food, I can't wait for the leftovers! Served it with plain quinoa....perfect!

Love, love, love this dish. I did make a few changes. I use boneless skinless chicken thighs so I don't have to deal w/ picking up the chicken to eat it and get tumeric all over my fingers. I increase the spices by about 1/2 and when it's done cooking, reduce the liquid to concentrate the flavors. Also add more eggplant, it's great!

I made it as is, and it was delicious. Particularly for such a simple dish. I served it with polenta and this combination is a really good one. Next time I will add another eggplant, but that's because I am an eggplant nut :). Yumm.

Tasty but not super-exceptional, at least the first day. I'm a big believer in next-day foods, so tomorrow may be amazing. I prepared it with chicken breasts (all I had on hand) halved and sauteed in olive oil and a sprinkling of flour to brown before immersing in the pan of veggies, tomatoes, and spices. I supplemented the ground ginger with fresh, and roasted a fennel bulb that needed a home to finish off the eggplant. This is a hearty dish that, for those who like intense flavors, can handle more of the spices. Don't drain the tomatoes -- it's silly to add water instead of the tomato juices. Good stuff, good veggies.

Yet another enthusiastic review. Made it pretty much as written, but with some slight changes (of course). Although we usually only like breasts, did thighs to see how it would work out--they were great. Cut the chicken back (there's only 3 of us), but cut sauce only by 1/3, added a pinch of Cinnamon as others suggested, and used the full amount of eggplant. It was great! Didn't add the almonds--didn't see the need as it was great as it was--and the cilantro was nice, but not worth buying a whole bunch for just a few sprigs, I'll skip it next time. Used chicken stock not water. Served over whole wheat couscous. Will totally make again.

This is excellent. I used boneless/skinless thighs (only organic product) as well as boneless breast. I did not brown the breast before but will definitely try that next time. The thighs were so much more tender. Very very easy. Very very flavorful.

So delicious that I can't believe I made it! I used chickpeas instead of chicken because that's what I had. I'll try this recipe with chicken, but it hard to imagine that it can be better.

Made this for the family and it was a big hit! Used a combo of boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs because thats what I had in the house. Also instead of the Whole milk yogurt I used fat free plain greek yogurt, which made it nice and creamy. A super easy weeknight dinner!

Not really sure what the fuss about this recipe is. It's decent but there are much better recipes on Epicurious (am of Indian descent so am familiar with very condimented cuisines as well). Probably wouldn't make again.

Easily my best go-to recipe that family loves and company raves over; I've made it at least two dozen times over the years. I use skinless/boneless thighs as that's what's readily available organic at my market. Somewhere along the line I stopped adding the almonds and don't miss them. I've also made it substituting chickpeas instead of chicken for vege friends, to high praise.

Rating: 4
Meets my criteria for four stars: great taste and easy prep. Add the fact that the chicken is skinless and it's a real winner. I made this for a buffet party, and it was a big hit. Nothing was left to bring home.

Have made this dish many many times. I triple the eggplant and have either baked it ro grilled it before adding to the stew. I prefer it grilled. It is also important to use chicken legs with bones in it as it makes it more flavorful. Instead of water, add chicken broth for more effect. Everything else was as the recipe stated a d it is delicious.

I can't really add more than what other reviewers have said This is a truly delicious dish. I took the suggestions about doubling up on the spices. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. I had a package of boneless chicken breasts on hand, so I diced those up and browned them first. Then added them to simmer in the sauce later. It made for a tasty stew spooned over couscous. My family ate it up!

Rating: 3
Very delicious! Used only 6 chicken thighs, but only cut back the onions. Also added a bag of frozen artichoke hearts (because I wanted more veggies) and about 1/4 cup golden raisins. I think either slivered almonds, or pinenuts would be a good substitute for the sliced almonds. Next time I will add more eggplant. I will definitely make it again! I made it in the morning then just reheated it and it was really good. I think mint would also be a nice addition. And maybe some feta. I served it with couscous.

This is fabulous! I would suggest using more eggplant, however. I just made it with 6 thighs and 1 whole eggplant and wished I had even more eggplant. Everything else was the original recipe to the letter. Served with cous-cous. Even better the second day.

Based on the ingredients I had on hand, I probably should not have attempted this dish but we would have missed a great meal. The taste was terrific even though I used boneless breast of chicken which only needs 15 minutes in the sauce. I added fresh chopped shallots to the garlic and onion mixture and substituted chopped fresh mint instead of marjarom. Served with crusty baguette. Leaving the skin on the eggplant was important for taste as well as presentation. It tasted very authentic. My boyfriend raved!

Made this dish with pearl couscous w/ apricots and almonds. Left out the marjoram (grocery store didn't have) and cilantro (don't like) and didn't add almonds to the main dish b/c it was with our side. this dish was very good, but next time i will dbl up on spices and add some cinnamon as others suggest. i also took another reviewers suggestion and browned the chicken first. it was pretty yum!

This was exceptional. I halved the recipe; added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp hot paprika (in addition to what was already called for), also used the juice from the tomatoes as the liquid... served it over couscous made with lemon and honey. Perfect.

I made this for a small dinner party, along with the EPI recipe for Israeli couscous with butternut squash and raisins. It's a great combination, attractive and everyone loved it. I made everything (except cooking the couscous) several hours ahead and it all reheated beautifully. It was nice not to be stuck in the kitchen with a lot of last-minute finishing. I increased the spices by 50% because I had added some extra chicken pieces. I think doubling the spices---as some people suggested--could be overwhelming. I think moroccan food is suppose to be more subtle-exotic and not hot-spicy.

For those who thought this was bland, take the hints from AZ, OH and Philly.Double the spices, added a little extra salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cayenne. Brown the chicken - your choice on skin off or on. Skin on added flavor and I added a drained can of garbanzo beans to add more protein since I halved the chicken. Used a 28 oz can of tomatoes including the juice. Add water as needed. I love eggplant so I added extra. Don't forget the lemon juice, herbs and nuts. This is spicy, healthy (remove the skin after cooking) and great tasting!

I have been making this dish since Feb. 2004 when it was on the cover of Bon Appetite. I give it the full 4 stars allowed as written but give it 10+ stars with my modifications throughout the years. Here are my notes. These are some slight changes I've adapted into the recipe after making this for 6 years. I double the spices, I don't use 8 thighs and 8 legs unless i have a huge crowd. 4 of each is fine or what ever amount you want. Brown the chicken FIRST with bone and skin in some olive oil, THEN remove chicken from pan and most of the fat (reserve fat) and add the onions (and bell peppers if you use them). Sauté the onions (and bells if you use them) just slightly then add the dry spices and some reserved fat if needed. Toss around to warm the spices and open their oils and aroma, Then continue with the recipe. I don't drain the canned tomatoes and I use one whole 28oz can. I also use chicken broth instead of water but water is fine. Simmer chicken with skin on for the flavors then remove skin before serving. I roast 2 med. eggplants and add right before serving. Would be good with red,yellow or orange bell pepper strips slightly sautéed with the onions and maybe a can of chick peas (garbanzo) rinsed. Don't forget the fresh Marjoram and the toasted/salted almond slices, cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end...it finishes the dish off nicely. I serve this over Jasmine or Basmati rice (Cooked with chicken broth instead of water but water is fine)! DELISH!

This was a delicious meal that was easy to prepare. I made a half recipe with just 4 large thighs, half of the other ingredients except I used the whole amount of eggplant and spices. I used one 15 oz can of petite diced plain tomatoes and juice instead of draining and adding water. The meal was served with date and almond couscous and a simple green side salad. The guests loved the meal and fragrant aromas.

I have made this multiple times - with and without eggplant. I don't think it adds much but it is good fiber! Lately we are on a low-meat kick and I like to make it with canned garbanzo beans instead of chicken and it is delicious over couscous. I keep a small spice jar in the cupboard with all of the spices measured out for this recipe in it. That way, when I feel like making this, I just dump in the contents of the spice jar instead of measuring everything. Quick and delicious.

This dish was good, but somehow the flavors didn't come together as well as I thought they would. It even ended up a bit..I hate to say it..bland. Not sure what it needs, but if you're looking for a killer tagine, pick another one. If you're looking for an easy one, that isn't bad, pick this one.

I served this dish last night when I had several of my good friends over for dinner. Everyone thanked me many times after dinner was over for making such a wonderful and "absolutely tasty" meal. One of my friends has had tagine many times and said this version was her favourite. :) In making the recipe, I did however, add a tablespoon or so of raw sugar to give it a sweet and savory flavour. In my experience, tagine is always a sweet and savory dish, but the ingredients listed do not call for anything sweet at all! Usually I put dried fruits (generally apricots) into my tagines, but all I had this time was raw sugar. Fortunately it turned out perfect! Also, I took the suggestions of other cooks and doubled, possibly even tripled, the spices. I feel this dish would have been bland without having taken that step. Overall, it was a great dish and I look forward to making it again!!

I loved this. I too doubled the spices. I had no paprika, so substituted 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and some smoked chili powder, oh and I added a tiny bit of cinnamon. I had a few dried figs too, so I cut them in half and threw them in. I used cut up bnls skinless chicken breast and served the whole dish over cous cous. I skipped the almonds since I added raisons and pistachios to the cous cous. It was the perfect balance of sweet/savory and spicy.

I thought the flavor lacked depth, even after doubling the spices, so I added about 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, and another tablespoon of salt. Thus revised, this was one of the most delicious chicken stews I've ever tasted.

I recommended this recipe to my boyfriend, who despite his relative inexperience in the kitchen had committed himself to cook Shabbat dinner for 8 while I was out of town. He was thrilled with his success - guests loved it and he was able to prepare it in multiple short stages on the nights leading up to the dinner. He made the sauce the first night, cooked the chicken in the sauce and roasted the eggplant the second night, and reheated all together just before serving. This let him create a fabulous dish even though he had limited time after work for cooking. He used kosher chicken (i.e., pre-brined) quarters, doubled up on spices and lemon juice, put in the the tomatoes undrained, and subbed stock for water. The sauce was a bit runny at first, but he cooked it down a bit and it ended up the perfect consistency. He served it over couscous. Several guests returned the next night to help him with the leftovers!

This was definitely pretty decent, and the toasted almonds were a nice touch. Nonetheless, it's not a show-stopper and thus deserves three forks instead of four...

I have made this several times for company (for Shabbat dinner, or a romantic dinner for two). Definitely double the spices. It's a lovely recipe and usually tastes even better the next day. I like to serve it with either Persian rice or couscous, with chopped dates and slivered/roasted almonds sprinkled in. It's a really lovely meal, looks impressive, and is not a beast to make. Good luck, and don't forget to double those spices! You won't be disappointed.

Made this tonight with only two substitutions - used boneless skinless chicken breast cut in large chunks, and dried marjoram for the finish. It is WONDERFUL! I could have done without the slivered almonds, as I didn't feel they added anything to the finished dish, although I know they're a Moroccan staple. Easy enough for a weeknight, fancy enough for a dinner party, definitely a keeper.

My sister recommended this recipe last year and I have made it a half dozen times at least. I always make a double batch and freeze half, it even tastes wonderful thawed and microwaved. I have made it with just chickpeas for a veggie dish and I often throw chick peas into the chicken dish. We're not big eggplant fans so I only made it with eggplant once....not a big difference as far as I could tell although the extra veggies are good for you. (Once you freeze and thaw it, the eggplant pretty much is mush anyway) I also double the spices (except the marjoram). Wonderful and actually takes very little time to make, even less if you just used 2 cans of chickpeas (garbanzo beans) instead of chicken - then I have everything for the recipe in the cupboard at any time; I let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes uncovered to reduce it a bit and then throw in the chick peas and simmer for 5 more minutes.

Made this recipe for a dinner party last night and it was EXCEPTIONAL! Made some recommended changes- -chicken stock instead of water, extra eggplant, double the spices (well worth it!). I also added an extra can of diced tomatoes (we love the sauce). Recommendation: salt and marinate the chicken overnight in lemon & orange juice--made the chicken super tender. Used 8 really big chicken breasts (instead of thighs and drumsticks) and cooked it all in the biggest oval le creuset pot they make. Using dried marjoram was fine. Served with couscous (mixed with pine nuts, green onions, cilantro), roasted feta, green beans, and a cherry cobbler. As far as the wine pairing-- we did a washinton merlot and a california pinot and it worked well with the meatiness/velvet of the eggplant. Everybody raved and asked for recipe. Will now be standard fair in our family--can't wait to make again.

I thought that this was terrific and will definitely make this again. I used the drained liquid from the can of diced tomatoes instead of the water, doubled the spices, used the fennel seeds whole and substituted boneless chicken breasts for the dark pieces (since that is what I had on hand) and the recipe was still wonderful. I made it for dinner to serve to a friend and it was still delicious 2 days later, reheated. I'm still enjoying the leftovers!

I make this almost once a week and we never get tired of it! I use the tomato juices or sometimes chicken broth instead of water, double the spices, and sometimes use boneless thighs cut into slices for ease. This is an easy winner. Anyone ever tried to it vegetarian with chickpeas instead of chicken. That will be my next endeavor.

This was a big hit at our dinner party. We had 7 guests and I doubled the recipe. We had plenty left over. I roasted the eggplant well ahead of time and let it cool. I browned the chicken, then made the onion/tomato sauce and layered the sauce with the chicken in a deep 10x13 stoneware baking pan. The chicken was not in a single layer but it seemed to bake just fine. I cooked it for about 45 minutes, stirred in the eggplant and marjoram, and let it sit in the oven at about 170 degrees until I was ready to serve. I planned to serve it with the golden couscous, but wondered if the spices in the couscous would compete with the spices in the main dish. So I eliminated those spices and it seemed to go over very well. I would definitely serve this again.

Rating: 3
A great recipe for a cold night. I doubled the spices as suggested and still felt it needed a little more, however tripling the spices made it a little gritty. Next time I may try somewhere in between. I also used boneless chicken thighs and browned them as suggested and they were really tender. Served over toasted pine nut couscous and there were no leftovers.

So funny to read SO MANY reviews where so many made adjustments. I did too! Some out of convenience, some for taste. Used boneless skinnless chicken thighs, one box of Parmalat strained tomato puree, one cup of broth (instead of water). I accidentally added the roasted eggplant witht he chickentand tomatoes, etc. This made my stew really thick and I liked it, which was nice, but sort of negated the roasting step. I was reluctant to adjust the seasonings, but did in the end. I added about 1 tsp. more ground coriander, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cayenne, zest of one medium lemon. You need to add a LOT more salt than is called for in this recipe for it to taste good. I didn't have fresh marjoram, and added about 2 tsp dried with the spices. Also, didn't have cilantro or almonds, but used chopped flat leaf parsley and pistachios to good effect. Tasty!

I incorporated some of the previous reviews. I wish that I'd doubled the spices and browned the chicken though. I made mine all in a dutch oven on the stove (including the eggplant - which I added when I added the chicken). I also used chicken broth instead of water. I served the stew over brown rice and I have a ton leftover.

Rating: 4
Fan-frickin-tabulous! I sent some of the leftovers over to a fellow foodie and he was blown away. I was too. I solved the chicken-blandness problem by brining the chicken overnight. For greater flavor and fast clean-up, I used a dutch oven for all the steps except roasting the eggplant, and I probably could have skipped that step. I browned the chicken, then layered it between the onion/tomato mixture and the eggplant, then threw the entire thing into a 350-375 oven. Monitored it with a probe thermometer until done. I made it a bit spicier than the recipe and contrasted it with a sweeter currant, toasted almond, lemon-zest and allspice couscous. To die for.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious recipe. Following other reviewers' advice I doubled the amount of spices, though. Next time I think it would be a good idea to marinate pieces of chicken in some lemon juice and garlic (maybe some rosemary, too) because the meat inside was a bit dull. I also added 1 red sweet pepper to give it more character. I will surely do it again.

I recently made this recipe and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I used half as much chicken as recommended, substituted the juice from the canned tomatoes for the water, and substituted zuchini for the eggplant but kept everything else (spices) the same.

DELICIOUS!!! When I want to WOW my dinner guests I make this dish! I've made this about 10 times now. Each time it gets better and better! The first time it was too bland so I doubled the spices (makes it richer)and doubled the eggplant (adds a creamy texture and great flavor!) . I also browned the legs and thighs to add a depth of flavor and removed the skin after it simmered in the juices awhile. Don't forget the FRESH Marjoram,sliced toasted almonds and the FRESH Cilantro!!! These add a flavor explosion and crunchy texture that is a MUST in this dish. I've had the Bon Appetit magazine (Feb. 2004) with this recipe on the cover in my cookbook rack since the day it came out and I will pass it on as a family recipe.

This is turning into one of our favorite recipes. My BF wants to make it a weekly staple. I have made it lots of different ways-- with white and dark meat on the bone (add the white meat later than the dark); with all skinless thighs on the bone; with all skinless boneless thighs. They were all great. I personally would not use all white meat. This really needs dark meat to be like a stew. Always double the spices. Use broth instead of water, and a whole can of diced (or whole) tomatoes. I also doubled eggplant or used eggplant and zucchini. The best (but most time-consuming) method is to use thighs on the bone, brown them in the skillet first. When you remove the chicken, discard the skin, but the nice fat and juices are already in the skillet. Then proceed. If you have the patience, you can remove the chicken from the bone and tear it into pieces, which makes it a bit easier to eat. THe marjoram adds a very distinctive taste-- do not double that. I add currants with the cilantro and almonds and serve with couscous.

To avoid a bland chicken flavor I put the salt on the chicken pieces and let them sit for 30 min. After adding rest of spices to the sauteed onion and garlic I added salted chicken with small amount of water(to avoid burning) and at medium to high heat I cooked it in its own juices with spices for 10 min. Then I added the water, garden fresh tomatoes, and lemon juice. Brought it to boil and cooked low for 15 min longer than recipe calls for. Substituted mint for marjoram. Flavor was delicious. Served it with couscous.

Rating: 3
Definately needs more spices than stated on recipe. Chicken doesn't soak all the sauce during cooking so I ended up shredding the cooked chicken and cooked it again and turned out much more flavorful. Next time, I am going to try marinading the chicken before to see if that adds more flavor. I was surprised how bland it tasted when I cooked it following the recipe exactly since it had so many different kinds of spices in it.

even though the eggplant was roasted, it was mushy after cooking in the broth. the soup was delicious, i should have cut the eggplant into smaller pieces so it wouldn't seem so mushy.

I love this recipe! I make it about once a month. I do agree that you need to double up on the spices because it needs more flavor. My family loves it over the polenta. I use boneless, skinless chicken because my kids don't like dark meat. The meat comes out very tender.

Made this last night - really really good, though as is my way, I did make a few minor changes. Doubled up spices, browned skin on chicken, fried spices with onions and garlic, used tom juice from tin and a glug of red wine. Didn't have fresh lemon juice so used a little preserved lemon and brine. Did roast eggplant seperately but then layered everything and baked in slow oven for 1 1/2 hours. Will make over and over again.

This has become a staple at my house. I am not the most competent cook in the world, but this turns out right everytime. Leftovers taste even better the next day and make a great lunch.

Just made this dish again for a dinner party - probably the 5th time I've made it - and I'm always pleased with the results. I'm flattered that people are still following my suggestion of doubling the dried spices (except the paprika). I'll admit that I don't replace my spices as often as I should, and if your dried spices are always fresh you probably don't need to increase the amount like I do. Served it with large grain cous cous this time and really liked the contrast of texture. Terrific with the 2004 dry roses that just arrived in our market. Yum!

Only changes I made were to cook the chicken for an extra 10 minutes after turning it and to substitute fresh oregano for the marjoram which was unavailable. Leftovers are in the freezer, we'll see how they are another day. There is an awful lot of comment about doubling the spices, not sure why.

I truly enjoyed this dish and love trying different ethnic dishes. However, some of my family that I made this for aren't used to differnt ethnic taste were a little unsure of the flavor combinations. I loved the combination of the herbs and spices and the dry toasted slivered almonds and fresh cilantro gave a wonderful extra taste variation. I used two eggplants and served with jasmine rice a mixed green salad and a merlot. So though I may make the family lasagna next time, this will definately be on my table again!

What a fantastic dish! In true tajine style I baked the whole dish which gave much deeper flavours. In a large oval Creuset casserole dish I first fried the onions, garlic and spices. In a seperate pan I browned the chicken with whole unskinned garlic piece which I deglazed with white wine. Added the chicken to the onions mix and followed the rest of the recipe but baked it at 325 for 2 hours. For serving I sprinkled the dish with almonds and chopped fresh baby dill, mint and cilantro.

Made this for a dinner party last night and received rave reviews. Like most reviewers, I doubled the spices - perfect. I can't imagine just half the spices as called for in the recipe - would have been pretty flavorless. Used all thighs and added some pitted green Moroccan olives -- this is a beautiful, yummy & fun dinner party dish. Served it with cous cous and a salad.

Rating: 3
Yummm! This may not be as good as what I ate recently in Morocco, but it is, nonetheless, very good. I agree that adding more spices is a good idea; I was cautious on my first try. But next time I will add more - I am convinced that will add not heat, but flavor.

I kid you not, I actually have dreams about this fabulous moroccan chicken. I have made it three or four times and cannot wait to make it again. I would suggest doubling the spices and throwing in some extra tomatos. Other than that though follow the recipe and enjoy!

Didn't have the tumeric or marjoram on hand, but was great regardless. Doubled spices as recommended, next time will also double eggplant since it really adds a lot. Don't leave out the almonds- they are great for texture.

Like everybody else, I doubled the spices and used the juice of the tomatoes instead of water. It was easy and delicious. I used 13 pieces of chicken tenders (cut up) and approximately 2 pounds of chinese eggplant--perfect amount.

YUM! Made this for a dinner party with two couples we'd never had dinner with and got accused of ordering in and faking it...To me at least, that's a compliment. OK, since most everyone has, here are my "what I did differents". 1. Used all dried herbs, fresh ones weren't worth the time to get. 2. Added some leftover Cab from the night before instead of the water. 3. Like most everyone else doubled the spices BUT also toasted them in 400 degree oven before adding. Take the extra few minutes to do it, it's worth it. Also added a little cinnamon. Made it up to the last step at about 2 in the PM, put everything together and popped into a 325 oven at 6:00, drinking wine when guests arrived and eating at 6:30, it's that easy. Serve over couscous and you're done.

Wow, look at how many people reviewed this recipe. And it's no wonder, having made it three times myself and waiting eagerly for the fourth. I love the results and you will too. Just follow the recipe as it is, or take some of the suggestions if you want to. Just make this for your guests, sit back with a glass of wine, and watch their faces light up. You don't have to be a gourmet cook to look like one. Go for this one. Write to me and let me know how it comes out.

This dish incredible. I made it for a dinner party and everyone who attended loved it and asked for the recipe. I skipped baking the eggplant and just sauteed it with the onion and what-not and cut up the chicken instead of serving it with the bones. I will definitely make this dish again.

Great flavours in this dish. The eggplant turned out perfectly. I only gave it three stars because the chicken turned out a bit tough so next time I might marinate it first. I also used toasted pine nuts as I didn't have any almonds and those were also delicious.

Excellent and I will definitely make it again. I made it the first time for company and everyone wanted the recipe. I did double all the spices as well as the eggplant, tomatoes and chicken broth. I added some olives and about 1 1/2 tsp. sugar. I baked it in a baking dish by layering the sauce, chicken thighs, eggplant and some fresh marjoram. I topped it with the sauce and baked it the day before I served it for 1 hour at 325, then the day I served it I put it in the oven for 1/2 hour at 325. Absolutely a winner!

Excellent flavor - a sophisticated blend of tastes. The slivered almonds add some 'mouth feel' to the dish, don't leave them out. Tastes even better the second day as the flavors become more pronounced, like many stews.

this is a nice and relatively light dish that's easy to make. i'd agree to doubling the herbs as well. i would have made couscous to go with it; but i turned to wild rice as a healthier alternative; which was nice cos it soaked up the juices. i also added some grilled eggplant to the dish before finishing up, which was nice.

Rating: 3
I made this for dinner tonight, and it's an instant classic. In fact, I would make it for company. As suggested, I doubled the spices (it would be rather bland if you didn't, I suspect), and used a whole 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, including the liquid, and omitted the water. Turned out great. Next time I'll use 2 eggplants. I served this dish with just plain couscous - the sauce is so flavourful, plain couscous is just right. Also, the fresh cilantro is a must - it adds brightness.

Rating: 3
Nice recipe, i added half a red (bell) pepper (because it was in the fridge!) at the beginning with the onion and also a tin of chick peas at the same time as the aubergine which added to the, um, tagineiness of it i thought.

I was out of sweet paprika so I used hot instead, and it was terrific. (I went easy on the black pepper, though.) One nice thing about this recipe is that it doesn't require browing of the chicken, saving a time-consuming and messy step. I used chicken broth instead of water and served the dish accompanied by rice to soak up the flavorful sauce.

Rating: 4
We love this recipe! Like many other reviewers, when I make this recipe, I double the spices. The other thing that I do is to double the amount of eggplant. Also, when I bake the eggplant, I do not toss the it with all the oil suggested, I use my Misto and lightly coat the eggplant with olive oil, just enough to allow it to brown nicely, thus cutting way down on the amount of oil in the recipe.

This has become a family favorite--declared birthday quality by my 14 year old daughter. It's easy to make and delicious.

When I first made this dish, it was shortly after the recipe was featured on the cover--and our teenage daughter thought it looked delicious. I didn't tell her it contained eggplant, which she swore she would never put in her mouth. To her great surprise and my great pleasure, she is truly a convert, in large part to the baking technique. We like to make it with boned skinless thighs, and at several other rater's suggestion, now make it with about double the spices. I wrote a Word doc, noting some of the best suggestions, so when I retrieve it each time I don't have to re-read all the reviews to remember how I did it the last time. Definitely a new favorite at our house!!

This was really yummy. I was going to make couscous to go underneath this, but at the end of the cooking time I didn't see the point of dirtying another dish. I added some chicken broth and a box of couscous to the mixture and let it cook in the pot with everything else. It came out great.

I also doubled the spices to great results. Used zucchini instead of eggplant and was yummy, although I'll definitely try it with eggplant next time. Also great with potatoes. The leftovers tasted even better since the flavors soaked in more.

Yummy and very quick. If tomatoes are canned in juice vs. puree, don't bother draining them; just omit the water. Quite good without almonds (though I bought Marcona Spanish Almonds from Whole Foods to add to leftovers) and cilantro and excellent with young white eggplants if available. Made quick couscous to absorb the thin, delicious sauce, adding juice and zest of one lemon in soaking process in addition to salt and sliver of butter.

Very good and pretty simple and cheap to boot. Followed the advice of adding more spices. Next time I think I will add more veggies (squash, mushrooms, etc) and make more of a "Moroccan cacciatore."

Loved this recipe. The second time I made this dish, I replaced the eggplants with potatoes and it came out terrific! Now I always make it with potatoes. Like oher reviewers, I added a bit more of the spices than called for. Served with basmati rice - an absolute hit everytime I make it.

This is really good, but I think I still prefer the earlier Moroccan chicken recipe also on epicurious (the one where you need to add harissa). Definitely agree that you should heavily bump up the spices on this, and it could easily take more eggplant. I'll likely incorporate the eggplant and almonds into the other recipe - they're a wonderful addition.

Terrific flavors...works well in the crock pot also!! My kids ate eggplant and did not even realize it....yeah!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I salted the eggplant and let it drain, then gave it a good sqeeze before tossing it with the olive oil & roasting. I added more spices - a good spoonful of Ras El Hanout (a Moroccan couscous spice). I added a can of drained, rinsed chickpeas to appeal to my kids (1 1/2 and 4 1/2 - they loved it!), and in the future I might add golden raisins as well, and since I'm not wild about thighs, I might do breasts instead. I served with couscous. My husband gave it rave reviews.

This is really really good, I did put in more spices and 2 eggplants (and it can even hold 3). I was a bit stingy on the chicken, so before heating I added some chickpeas and served it with couscous, awesome.

I made this with just thighs (a whole big tray of them, maybe 20?) and cut the meat off the bones into bite-size chunks. I also used 2 large eggplants instead of just one, to make it a bit healthier. You could probably get away with using 3, yes 3 whole eggplants--just soak the chunks in salty water first to get rid of the bitterness. This recipe is better with petit diced tomatoes, no need to drain the can. Like other people have said, double the spices and brown the chicken. It's great reheated, which is important since you will have lots of leftovers.

This is my second post on this recipe! I forgot to mention that, like another reviewer, I also used fresh ginger, too. A lot. I always find it so much different,and better, than dried. And to the cook from Orlando: Even if it's not typically used in true Moroccan cooking, you should try making it with the fennel seeds at least once! I used extra, and it really added a nice element to the dish. And when using the whole can of tomatoes, which I did, because I like a lot of sauce: definitely increase the eggplant!

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC. I've made this dish several times and it always turns out fantastic. My family prefers a little extra spice so I added a tsp of Cayenne Pepper. I also thought the onions made the dish a little too sweet so used 2 cups (vs. 3 cups). This is a keeper.

My husband is Moroccan, I lived there for several years, and we cook a lot of Moroccan food. Both of us love this recipe and have made it several times already. We skip the fennel seeds, not finding them to be used in his regional cuisine, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. This has become a favorite, with its subtle and aromatic sauce, smoky roasted eggplant flavors, and sweet/sour/salty flavors.

Loved this dish the first time I made it and made it again yesterday to be served today, Thought the spicing was sensational yet will double the spices as suggested by others when next I prepare it for friends who insist I make for them after hearing my raves.

This was easy and delicious. I doubled the spices; used fresh ginger and toasted hazelnuts (didn't have almonds on hand. Made ahead of time and reheated by simmering on stovetop for about an hour. I browned the chicken (skin on) but wouldn't bother next time--don't think it added anything. What I would do differantly next time is thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstarch--personal preferance only. Boyfriend would like even more spice but I thought doubling was just right. The fresh cilantro contributed to dish both looks and taste wise. Served with cous cous from a package.

Made as written except I used a chicken cut into 8 pieces and a 1 pound eggplant. Thought it was quite good and would make it again with more eggplant.

A QUESTION: I love a good tagine recipe and am planning on making this recipe very soon. My question is why would you use skinless chicken? So much of the flavor from thighs and drumsticks comes from the skin. I would brown the chicken pieces in the olive oil and set them aside before I started cooking the onions and garlic. It just seems that your missing a whole layer of flavor by using skinless. Could the recipe call for skinless simply to lower the fat? If so, BAH! Fat = Flavor Any thoughts?

Rating: 4
Delicious! Glad I made enough for 2 meals. But: after draining the diced tomatoes I had 2½ cups, and in this sort of recipe what difference does another 1/2 cup make? Measured the juice, and there was exactly 1 cup which subs for the water. Next time I'll simply add the whole can. Doubled spices as recommended, and could hardly force myself to stay away from the leftovers. A keeper indeed!

Rating: 4
Great-will definitely be making this one again. My family hadn't had much expoure to eggplant and they loved it in this dish. I was a little worried about not peeling or salting out the bitter compounds-but followed the recipe and it was not bitter at all. The only thing I will do next time is to add a little harissa to take the flavor and heat level up a bit and serve some additional on the side for the true heat lovers in my family. Served it with couscous for perfect winter dinner. Leftovers were as good if not better than the dish on day one.

I ended up having to add more chicken broth because it was a little dry, but it was wonderful. My husband said it was the best chicken he ever had. I served it like a stew in bowls over mashed potatoes. Mmmmm! We had it last night and I sure wish there were leftovers........

I made this recipe as soon as I saw it on the magazine cover. Excellent! We peeled the eggplant first and used only boneless, skinless thighs because it cooks faster and is easier to eat it at the dinner table that way.

I made half a recipe, taking some previous reviews to heart I increased the spices and added a teaspoon or so of Korean red pepper. I used a whole tiny fryer, skinned and cut into 8 pieces. I also sliced a whole Meyer lemon into the mix. I added no water or broth, using the juice from the tomatoes and a pinch of tamarind to cut the tartness of the tomatoes. Instead of cooking on top of the stove, after everything had been saute'ed and added and stirred, I put the lid on the pan and baked for about an hour at 325 F and it was totally awesome! It's inexpensive and yet very impressive looking and tasting. I'll do it again and often!

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and substituted chicken broth for the water. The dish is very good, but I would not make it with white meat only.

This was a great recipe. And as any good cook will suggest, with any recipe, you follow it as a guideline, and taste and add things to suit your palate as you cook. If you follow recipes to a T, you'll most likely be disappointed because not all palates are the same. I doubled the spices this time, but I think I'll triple them the next. It goes great with naan or pita bread. I would definitely make this again.

Fabulous. Made a half batch last evening with four thighs and four drumsticks. My market didn't have these skinned so I had to do it; and that turned out to be the hardest part of the recipe.

I used a minimum amount of olive oil when roasting the eggplants (I know the eggplants will shrivel after the moisture evaporates so I tried not to use too much oil), used a mixture of chicken thighs and breast, and tossed in another handful of toasted almonds. I debated whether to brown and season the chicken first, but decided not to. I also did not drain the diced canned tomatoes, but put in only a half cup of water. Finally, I tossed in the cilantro (more than called for) just before serving, so the dish looked more attractive with the fresh greens. A really lovely dish! Can't wait to make it again.

Made the recipe "as is" and was very disappionted. The sauce was watery and bland-nothing special at all. Am I the only one that feels this way? (At the risk of sounding cocky, I am known for my cooking in my sophisticated social circle- yes, Texans can be urbane too-so the fault cannot be placed on me!!)

This recipe is finger-licken' good. We made it twice, omitting the marjoram and almonds (we just didn't have them in the house) and it was delicious. I wouldn't mind if there would be even more sauce. I look forward to making the recipe again and again.

Made this for dinner last night and my husband loved it. The kids liked it well enough to make it again. The sauce was delicious -- spicy and different. An easy midweek dinner that's more exciting than grilled chicken breasts.

Made this twice now - both times used 3 chicken breasts on the bone. I added a small handful of frozen peas near the end. Very good dish!

I was disappointed in how this recipe came out, given the great reviews it had received. The dish was underseasoned and the eggplant came out tasting very oily. I think the dish would be improved if the chicken were seasoned first with salt and pepper, then browned briefly, and then braised in the sauce for a short while. The eggplant also needs to be seasoned before roasting. The basic idea is good, though.

Chicken & eggplant paired well together. Our guests loved it - the chicken fell off the bone. Skipped the almonds.

Was very flavorful, even without the eggplant.

One of the best chicken dishes I've ever made, and amazingly easy to prepare! It is very vesatile, and can be served for an everyday meal or for company. I served it over couscous, which soaked in the sauce very nicely. Can't wait to make it again!

My husband told people at work that this was possibly the best chicken dish he's ever eaten. Leftovers were event better as the flavors were able to soak in. I used chicken breast meat and omitted the eggplant. Be generous with the spices - this is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe twice in the last month. The first time was so good and easy I made it for company the next time. What wonderful spice combos. I served it with couscous, fresh french bread and a bottle of our favorite RED ZINFANDEL WINE. Wow.. A real keeper. I did add more spices than called for. I just kept tasting. Lots of cumin and ginger.

Ny husband and I are not chicken lovers, but this is incredible. The flavor is sensational. Next time I prepare this, I would use two eggplants. I used the 3 Tablespoons of lemon juice called for and found that it was perfect.

Excellent recipe and delicious. I didn't have turmeric or fennel seeds and the end result was still wonderful.
