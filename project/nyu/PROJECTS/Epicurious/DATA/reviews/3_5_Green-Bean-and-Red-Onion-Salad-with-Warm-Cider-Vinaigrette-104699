Yum! I think the cider vinaigrette is what makes it. I'll try it with thin apple slices, more green beens and less greens next time.

This is a solid, good enough salad, but not an extraordinary one. I found the dressing tasty, but a little too sweet. I left out the radishes in the salad but did add the bread and butter pickles, which were surprisingly nice with the red onions. I can see making this again, but I'd likely add more mustard to the dressing, maybe use hot chinese mustard instead of the Dijon for more zip.

I was not at all wowed by this recipe, and I followed it exactly, with the exception of omitting the pickles (like everyone else who was baffled by this ingredient). The dressing just was not tasty enough....I agree with another reviewer that it could benefit from bacon drippings (the high fat fix for this recipe) or garlic (the low fat one). Whatever the case,this recipe just needed something extra.

It's a shame that more people haven't discovered this recipe, because this is a surprisingly delicious salad. I just happened to have some fresh Michigan green beans and radishes, and was curious about what recipes might pop up when I entered that combination in the search engine. My husband loved this salad so much, he asked me to make it again the next night; and he usually leaves half his salad in the bowl. I didn't have frozen apple juice, so reduced 3/4 cup cider to 1/4 (making half the recipe amount). I didn't add the pickles either--don't like bread and butter and can't imagine pickles with the rest of the ingredients. This is a salad to savor--spicy and sweet, and crunchy. Wish there were some way I could red flag this recipe for others. I will be making it many times in the future. Served it with baked parmesan lake perch and an herbed red potato salad. Perfect combination of flavors.

Made this for a dinner party, it was liked by all. I left out the radishes and pickles. Next time I will add the radishes. The dressing is wonderful.

This is a great salad. I used some leftover ice cider instead of apple juice in the dressing. I think the temperature of the salad is not terribly important- although I prepared it warm it was room temperature when eaten and still delicious.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written and it was easy and very good. I definitely liked the pickles in it!

This dish was great. I obmitted the pickles but other than that I didn't change a thing. A wonderful and impressive dish.

I too, didn't add the pickles and I just realized that I forgot the onions! I'm sure it would have been even better but this was still delicious. Living overseas, I wasn't able to get apple juice concentrate so I used regular apple juice and reduced it down. The dressing came out beautiful. Dead easy to make and great for a large group.

I love pickles, but they just seemed too unnecessary here to use them...so I didn't. I didn't use the radishes because my husband is anti-radish. That said, this dish was amazing! So incredibly easy...the work to wow ratio was in the cook's favor. I plan on taking this to the next potluck I attend. One more modification I made -- I threw the thinly sliced onion in the beans' boiling pot for the last minute because I do not care for the lasting impression raw red onions tend to make. Caramelizing them would have worked, too, but this was less work and cleanup. If you are a fan of the sweet/sour/piquant flavor combo and you like things that are easy and easy to clean up then by all means try this!

I'm surprised more people haven't reviewed this one! I served this salad along with honey-gingered pork tenderloin (also on this site) for my family and my brother asked for the recipe -- he is not a big vegetable eater! Not sure the pickles added much to the flavors. The dressing is really nice!

I just served this for a holiday dinner and it met with rave reviews. My personal preference was to omit the pickles and oil. Instead, I sauteed bacon pieces (cut into 1/3 inch pieces) until they were crisp. I discarded the bacon fat, but then deglazed the bacon skillet with a touch of brandy. After that I added the apple juice concentrate and reduced and then mixed in the remaining goodies (vinegar, mustard, seed). You could no doubt skip the brandy by using the vinegar to deglaze the pan. I can't say that using bacon fat and bacon instead of vegetable oil and pickles is a healthy substitute, but it suited my tastes. The two couples that joined us asked for the recipe, so I presume they enjoyed it as well!

This recipe is wonderful. I omitted the mustard seeds and radishes from the salad because my family does not care for them. I also serve the dressing chilled and it is just as good. I WILL make this recipe again.

This salad is amazing, especially when paired with the Three-Cheese and Champagne fondue in this database(it's also spectacular with the rest of the Bon Appetit V-day 2001 menu). My husband usually hates salad, but he enjoys this one. One caution: you will have excess dressing. Buy enough ingredients to make this salad twice (or more) in one week. I skipped the pickles.
