This was delicious; I skipped the corn and peas and used sauteed baby bella mushrooms instead- then drizzled it all with olive oil and sprinkled it with coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper. I also cracked the egg right on top of the flatbread and baked it. For one of the flatbreads, I used buffalo mozzarella, torn in small pieces and that was even better.

I thought this was great. A lot of muted but delicious flavors, so as long as you make sure to season generously it's definitely worth the time and effort.

This had potential to be good, but I found it to be quite bland. I added some chopped prosciutto, which helped, but the egg was completely unnecessary and made the pizza slimy.

I must respectfully disagree with Marin Mama and declare this pizza to be delicious! I sauteed the asparagus with a little olive oil and sea salt before putting it on the pizza which i think helped enhance the flavor. Overall, I think this recipe is really yummy. The arugula pesto is so sharp and flavorful! When it's combined with the smooth and buttery texture of the egg yolk it's to die for!

Had high hopes for this as there are great flavors and ingredients, but it was just ok. I put roasted tomatoes on it and it gave it some flavor, which helped, but otherwise it was surprisingly bland.
