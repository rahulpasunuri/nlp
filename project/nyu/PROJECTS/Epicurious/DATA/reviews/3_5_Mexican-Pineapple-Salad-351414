We added cilantro, used a very small onion (rinsed), and used lime juice instead of white vinegar. Make sure you use a ripe, fresh pineapple. The recipe is really good, and can double as an excellent salsa if you chop everything very small. It's best eaten the day you make it, but can be kept up to a day if you absolutely have to. It goes really well with the cilantro-chipotle tilapia and some corn tortillas.

Switch out the jicama for watermelon!

I love pineapple and avocado... but i've never tried jicama... I cut everything up extra fine and made more of a salsa for my Cilantro-Chipotle Tilapia. I put everything over a small soft taco shell with some sour cream. YUM!!!

the overall dish seemed to be lacking a few ingredients, so i added a chili pepper for some heat, chopped cilantro, and lime juice instead of white vinegar also i chopped enough onion to add some flavour, but a whole onion is far too much and would overpower the avocado and pineapple with the ingredients i added, it takes the "mexican salad" a little more south east asian.

So easy and so good.

I will definitely make this again. I love avocado so I would add more and even though I really liked the red onion I did reduce it by a little. It really pairs well with a spicy dish or on its own. I did not find it too sweet or sour.

Made this to go with the cilantro-chipotle tilapia - it made for a really nice contrast but I think it would be too sweet on its own. Be sure to add cilantro to the salad as well. Next time, I will half the recipe because I found it did not keep well.

I was sceptical about this recipe but followed it to the "T." It came out great and our guests loved it! I will be making this again soon!

This is a wonderful recipe. I added cilantro and lime the first time out. I'm making it for a pig roast birthday party this weekend and will ad very finely sliced Jalapeno and homemade bacon bits. Last time my roommate made it, he used shallots instead of red onion. It tasted great at the table, but the next day was too garlicky.

We loved this salad. It was a great companion to the Cilantro-Chipotle Tilapia. A nice alternate side dish with some of our favorite ingredients.

I loved the sweetness of the pineapple in this recipe. Because I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I had too many red onions. I had to pull them out the next day, they overwhelmed everything. Also, I made this fabulous ranch dressing by pioneer woman (on her blog). So I poured some over this on the third day (I needed a change) and it was wonderful. It reminded me of a waldorf salad. I wouldn't have tried that with bottled dressing, but this was great. There are so many directions you can go with this, I really liked it.

Definitely add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, juice and zest of 1 lime. This is an amazing salad where the sum of the ingredients is far better than the individual ingredients. Yum!

Had this at party this weekend. Delicious, but a hint of lime would make it livelier.

I have made this 3 times. SOO good. I did add the cilantro and a few strawberries. The berries added some nice color and a little more sweetness

The salad doesn't say it has cilantro. It says it goes with the cilantro - chipotle tilapia

A little bland, even though I added lime zest and juice per other reviewers. Maybe the flavors will perk up overnight.

I have not made this yet, but I did double check the printed recipe in Gourmet. The printed recipe includes 1/4 cup of cilantro.

The different flavors just didn't stand out for me. The pineapple overpowered everything.

I agree with goodlookinandcookin--I too added lime juice, zest plus cilantro. I also enjoyed the sauce more the second day than when freshly made.

Haven't made this yet, but note that the sidebar says a main ingredient is cilantro, but cilantro is not in the ingredient list. Remember to buy some, and I suppose you guess how much to put in?

I made this for a party last night and everyone loved it. It was served with chicken and cheese enchiladas and was a good pairing since it added a sweet, refreshing, crisp note to the meal. I added the juice of 1/2 a lime and some lime zest. I think it tasted better after a few hours of refrigeration.

Great! And so easy. The only thing I changed was to use cider vinegar instead of white because it was all I had. This side could go with almost anything but definitely try it with the recommended cilantro-chipotle tilapia.
