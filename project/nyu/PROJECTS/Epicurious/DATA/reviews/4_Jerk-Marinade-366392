We loved this! I made the marinade in the morning, marinated drumsticks in a plastic bag all day, then baked them. I made some changes for convenience that didn't negatively impact the flavour, in my opinion: lemon juice instead of lime juice no chiles ground allspice instead of berries ground thyme instead of fresh onion instead of scallion

This is absolutely amazing!!! I followed the recipe exactly, other than using ground allspice instead of whole. I serve it with red beans and rice and fried plantains. Delicious!!!

This is a fantastic marinade. I had to substitute jalapenos for habaneros (and so left the seeds in), but other than that I followed the recipe as written. The sauce adds a real brightness to the finished meat. I wouldn't skip it.

This made *delicious* chicken! Marinated drumsticks and skinless/boneless thighs overnight and grilled them on the barbecue. When the chicken was cooked, turned off the grill and brushed them with the sauce for extra flavor. These have a nice bite but aren't overwhelming. Only had 1 tbsp of fresh thyme so subbed 1 tsp dried for the second tbsp. Also didn't have whole allspice berries so I substituted 1 tsp dried allspice. Served with zucchini cornbread from this issue, coleslaw and a salad. Great dinner! TIP: WEAR GLOVES when you seed and chop the habaneros. You've been warned.

This is totally delicious. Served on pork. Had to use jalapenos instead of habaneros, so added a bit of Jamaican Pepper Sauce at the end to up the spice a tad (once you seed jalapenos they don't have a lot of kick) but I like having a little control over the spice anyway, so that was good. Also subbed 1 tsp of ground allspice for the 2 tsp of berries, but otherwise, followed to spec. Just delicious.

First! A very easy recipe and super tasty. Used three instead of four habanero and the heat was just right. Substituted dried thyme for the fresh, ground allspice for the berries and rice wine vinegar for white vinegar. Made the mistake of using my raw chicken utensil to mix sauce; as a result, I just added the sauce to the marinade. Just as well in hindsight, as the sauce may have been overpowering (raw habenaro, ginger and allspice?). Chicken took what marinade (overnight) it can to the grill, discard the rest. Trust me, there's enough flavor without the finishing sauce. Grilled over medium-high charcoal, searing all surfaces, then moved over to secondary zone (no charcoal), close lid to slow finish (10-15 minutes). Done when juices run (mostly) clear. Highly recommended to flavor seekers.
