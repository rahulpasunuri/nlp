I made this with Cushman's honeybell marmalade, tweaked it to our tastes according to ingredients. It was very good. Would make again.

I made this twice - the first time I used Orange Marmalade because that's what I had - the second time the Apricot - going back to the OM, which we all preferred.

Nice and simple sauce. I added a touch more soy and a sprinkle or two of pepper flakes to liven it up. It was a great hit, going head to head with salsa on tostitos! My only issue was that it congeals quickly when left out, I will try to add some water next time.

I found the sauce to be a bit bland as well as sweet. With a bit of ginger, sake, garlic juice and water it really developed into a nice tangy dip. Definitely let it simmer for a few more minutes as well.

Fabulous. Did not use the lard - not necessary. Great for cocktail parties. Serving it this weekend for our wine tasting party along with chicken sate!

Very good. Have made this twice - first, exactly as written (good) - and second, with a little grated fresh ginger (generous teaspoon from a good knob of ginger) and some chinese mustard (simmered for about 5 minutes). I didn't add Tabasco the second time. Either way - fresh and good (little more raves the second time around).

This excellent dipping sauce is so fruity, zingy and easy to make you will never again accept commercially prepared "duck" sauce. So simple to vary with the addition of more tabasco, or some crushed fresh ginger. My family loves it with the addition of some nice freshly grated hot horseradish. I keep a supply of this delicious sauce on hand as it enhances any meat, fish or fowl.
