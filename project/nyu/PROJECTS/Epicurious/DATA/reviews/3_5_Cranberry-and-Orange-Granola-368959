How can this be considered Vegan when butter is used? I know to use a Vegan alternative for butter. Just wonder if anyone has done this?

Delicious and very easy to make.

I made this for my uncle for Christmas using my own homemade candied orange peel. It was pretty spectacular! Nice fruity flavour. The only thing I changed was the baking time - I reduced it by about 7 minutes because the oats tasted toasty enough for me! I'm making it for the second time right now. I can definitely recommend it!

Could only give this 3 forks because I did not have the candied orange peel. I added walnuts and unsalted, roasted peanuts. I love the toasting of the oats beforehand. It seems a bit crunchy, perhaps I need to cut back on the baking time, or it could have been the brand of oats I used. Will make it again.
