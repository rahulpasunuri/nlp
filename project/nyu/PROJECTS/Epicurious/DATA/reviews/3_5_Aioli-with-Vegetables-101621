This aioli recipe is wonderful. I served it for a party with steamed asparagus, green beans, fennel, new potatoes, and zucchini. The fennel was the best match to the aioli, but it was all wonderful. Tip - when they say pour slowly, they really mean slowly. It curdled my first time and I had to make it again. Will definitely make for future parties!

This was easy to make and delicious. I made a few modifications to suit my guests. A teaspoon of basil pesto and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar was more to my liking, and I know many chefs may not approve but adding 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch really takes away the worry of curdling. Great for beginners.
