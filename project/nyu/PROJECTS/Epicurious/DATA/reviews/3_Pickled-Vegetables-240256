Absolutely horrible. The spices were overpowering (I can't believe the reviewer who doubled them) and the beets were tough and inedible - not a surprise, in retrospect, since every other pickled beet recipe I've tried requires the beets to be cooked first. I think I'll stick to my mother-in-law's recipe - she may be a meddling lunatic, but she sure knows how to pickle a vegetable.

These were very popular at several different parties. I used this recipe only as a base. I seriously increased the seasonings - triple for most and fresh rough ground the spices in a mortar and pestle. I have also increased the vinegar to water ratio to be more vinegary and changed out the vinegar to apple cider - I also made the original ration. All varieties are tasty - I personally prefer the more tangy bite of the more vinegary versions myself. I originally increased the spices and heated/boiled the spices briefly in the individual brines so that the pickles would be ready in a day - not a week, but after keeping them for a week - they are just as tasty. Can't imagine making a low spice version. For the cauliflower I added hot pepper, orange peel and a ginger knob to the brine. Also - try radishes in the cauliflower brine. These were all loved by all!
