My husband and I like these very much. This is the second time I've made them. I add cilantro, and we're thinking of chopping some of the shrimp and pureeing about 1/3 of it for a more solid shrimp texture. Haven't changed dipping sauces for this recipe - the sauce is fine - but I love the dipping sauce that goes with Five Spice Chicken on this site. I will try that one next time I make this.

My husband raved about these and the kids gobbled them up. I did change up the dipping sauce b/c I wasn't crazy about it as-written -- added a lot more soy sauce, some water, some sugar, the juice of a lime, some seseame oil and some sriracha -- much better. But for the main ingredients, I followed the recipe 99% (didn't have the mushroom) and it was fantastic. Tip: I stretched the round dumpling wrappers a little before filling each and it allowed me to fit more filling.

I switched out a few ingredients. Instead of spinach, I used bokchoy. Instead of scallions I used chives because I had them growing in my garden. They were a big hit at a dumpling wrapping party I attended.

I just made these for an Asian-themed dinner party, and they were fantastic. I thought they might be labor-intensive, but the assembly went pretty quickly once I got the hang of it, and my guests loved them.

These are so wonderful, and easy to make! They were the first to go at our last party!! Add a few chopped green onions to the sauce-yum!

Delicious! Everyone in my family really enjoyed these. Even my 3 yr old! We will definitely be having these again soon.

We made these for a New Year's Eve appetizer batch. I doubled the recipe, used square wonton wrappers, and cooked everything in a pasta pot. Perfect. People raved. The sauce was fantastic, the dish was actually easy to make.

so good! the instructions can be a little bit unclear, but once you figure it out, they're actually really easy to make. we added some toasted sesame oil to the dipping sauce. we're going to use this recipe as a jump-off for other dumpling recipes: maybe substitute chicken for the shrimp and add extra ginger.

This was fabulous! I did end up making a number of substitions: - husband hates water chestnuts, so I used bok choy instead - forgot to buy spinach....added more bok choy - didn't make the sauce and used bottled light peanut sauce These were so tasty! Looked impressive and were very easy (I used wonton wrappers and didn't bother cutting them at all). Made the filling the day before, so it just took about 15 minutes to make them.

Although this recipe does take a while to make, I've made it several times because it's so good. I've also substituted shelled crab meat for the shrimp, which made it a little quicker.

GREAT appetizer for a gathering! I made this for the first time recently, and it was much easier than I expected. everyone loved them. will definitely make again. will use low-salt soy sauce next time, though, as the sauce was a bit too salty with regular soy sauce.

Why cut square wrappers into rounds? Why not just buy round wrappers?

I am generally pleased with all the 4 Fork recipes, but not this one:( The filling seemed great, the sauce was good, but it just didn't rate. Maybe it was the brand of wonton I used, but it seemed TOO thick for the delicate flavored filling. New: I have since figured out the problem - my wontons were slightly stale and stuck together so each was doubled. I am definitely going to make this again

I didn't make this recipe, but it sounds so good that I may try it over the holidays. To the tester who was disappointed in wonton wrappers as they are too thick, I would suggest using "gyoza" wrappers...thin, silky, and easy to work with. I use them when I make shao-mai. One important thing to remember when using them: if a recipe says you can make the appetizers ahead and freeze them, thaw them in the refrigerator (not at room temperature) because the gyoza are so transparent that they will stick and possibly tear. Do try them, though.

This is one of my favorite dishes to prepare and it always gets rave reviews from my guests. These dumplings have so much terrific flavor - definitely worth the extra time to assemble them rather than ordering out! Oh, and I pan fry them in a non-stick pan with a little oil for some crunch. Mmmm!

My husband says that the only problem with these is that oil gets all over the stove and then he has to clean it up. This is true, but they are very tasty and always well received at parties. I fry them (obviously), and I buy regualar square wrappers and fold in half to form a triangle, and then tuck the ends in front. Works fine.

We had these for supper last Sunday night; they were delicious. I'm making them again tonight for an appetizer. I just used square wonton wrappers. They were fine.

I haven't made it yet, but it looks very interesting.(I'm a caterer)I agree- just buy the wonton skins round-forget cutting. For that guy who didn't find enough flavor- just add something & zip it up a little. For dusting- instead of corn starch- try rice flour sometime!

Rather than buying wonton wrappers and then cutting them in circles, you can buy "gyoza" or "potsticker" wrappers that are the pretty much round wonton wrappers.

Yummy -- lots of chopping (I also made the pork dumplings at the same time), but good results. I agree -- don't cut the wontons into circles. Just buy the round wonton wrappers or leave them in triangles.

I really enjoyed these, they are low fat, delicious and suprisingly easy to make,dipping sauce was perfect.

I made these for a party and everyone raved about them. I didn't bother to cut the wontons into circles and filled them with more than 1 tsp of filling, which I think was better than the tiny ones the recipe called for.

I was so excited to make this dish for company. I made a couple of appetizers and saved this for last-thinking it would be the best. It was just ok though-took WAY to much time to prepare for just a so-so dish. Not to much flavor here.

After steming I pan fried in oil, much better texture. Yummy dipping sauce

I made these for a group of friends and they LOVED them. The lettuce leaves worked really well for keeping the dumplings from sticking to my metal steamer basket. The dipping sauce was great, too.

Excellent. Substituted baby bok choy for the water chesnuts and it still came out great.

Wouldn't change a thing. They were wonderful! What a great appetizer, served atop wilted spinach sauteed in a little butter, shallots, garlic and ginger. Looked pretty and tasted even better. Don't have a steamer, so put a tablespoon of cooking oil in a pan over medium heat, put in dumplings and cooked about 1 minute ot until bottoms browned, then add a 1/2 cup of water and cover tightly. Steam for about 3 more minutes or until cooked through. Also, I followed the measures and only got about 18 dumplings. Probably overstuffed mine. But that was FINE with me!

This was one of the most original, yet most elegant appetizers I have prepared. I served it as a first course to a gourmet halibut meal, but in an informal atmosphere where my guests were standing around watching the children eat. It was a smash and all guests requested the recipe. Try it!!!

I prepared these dumplings for 150 people ( I am an off premise caterer) and let me say that they were extremely well received.
