By far the easiest and best sugar cookie recipe I have tried thus far. The dough is very straightforward to make and rolls out beautifully every time. The cookies are not too sweet, but are the perfect buttery cookie for decorating.

I have been searching for a good cookie cutter recipe, and finally I found it! Years ago, we had one that used butter and Crisco, that was very easy to handle, yet wasn't all that tasty. This recipe has dough that is a dream to handle and the cookies are very tasty! Use the best flour, butter and eggs you can get, and follow the recipe to the letter, and you won't be disappointed.
