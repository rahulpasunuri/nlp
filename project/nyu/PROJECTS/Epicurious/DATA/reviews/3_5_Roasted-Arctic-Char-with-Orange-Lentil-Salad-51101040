As other reviewers noted, I increased OJ, zest, and onions which gave the lentils a great orange savor. I also heated them for 10 minutes in a sauce pan because I wanted to serve the fish over warmed lentils. I served steamed spinach with the dish. Since I live in CA, char isn't readily available, so I made this with Alaskan halibut. While still great, I would make it next time with wild salmon. I think halibut was too dry and salmon would have been a better and moister choice. Also, I think the great orange flavor would have been a great compliment to the heartier salmon flavor. That's my reason for the three star rating. I think with the right fish, this is definitely a four star recipe that's easy and very healthy!

We made ours with Flounder and it was really tasty. I did warm my lentils a bit since we were having the dish on a snowy night and look forward to having it again in the warmth of spring!

This was excellent! And such a snap to make. I highly recommend it!

This is a great solid recipe that is quick and easy to make. The flavors in the lentils are subtle, and thus you may want to add a bit more orange zest and use fresh squeezed orange juice. I made it with salmon (only fish I had in the house) and it was wonderful. Put in lots of fresh mint from the garden--yummy!

Trader Joe's lentils are great & saved time. Increased the quantity of fish per person. Added more mustard, vinegar, and red onions. I baked it as called on the recipe. Was wonderful.

Used Trader Joe's steamed lentils and increased the vinaigrette by half, based on other reviewers' advice. Terrific! Leftover lentils even better the next day with dijon-mustard-and-caper-slathered broiled bluefish fillets.

I was looking for a lentil salad recipe and found this. Ok, so it came with fish. I ignored that. Couldn't find any atlantic char here anyway. So I just made the salad and it is delicious! I upped the juice and the salt (I used coarse sea salt). I had my own mint so I felt very connected to what I made and ate. I cooked my own lentils with bay leaf and salt & pepper.

The fish was wonderful, but the lentils were bland. I had to add additional dressing.

Do I assume this is one portion of fish each for 4 people or is this to serve 2 large appetites?

I grilled the char at 450º on a cedar plank and it was great!. Thanks for the tip about Trader Joe's lentils.

This was great, healthy and VERY easy, especially when using Trader Joe's packaged/steamed lentils. I make lentils with salmon or arctic char frequently, and this is a nice variation on flavors and extremely fast. I will absolutely make this again.

Very good and so easy with ready-to-eat steamed lentils. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but increased the volume of the vinaigrette. I also added more purple onions than called for.
