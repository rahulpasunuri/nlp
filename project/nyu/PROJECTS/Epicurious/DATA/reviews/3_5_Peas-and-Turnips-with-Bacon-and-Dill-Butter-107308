This was really, really good and a nice change from mashed turnips. As a vegan, I didn't use the bacon but instead sauteed the turnips in a couple tablespoons of Earth Balance margarine and also added about 2 cups of chopped collards about 5-7 minutes after the turnips had started cooking. However, the turnips did take much longer than the stated time in the recipe. I read that turnips can take up to 30 minutes to cook depending on their age, and mine took about 12-14 minutes. They were not crunchy but had a nice al dente texture. The dill was subtle and added a nice hint of freshness to the dish. I completely forgot to add the Baco's at the end, but the recipe still got rave reviews from our guest and my 15 month old!

This was pretty exceptional. I have a share in a community supported agriculture farm; today we got turnips, turnip greens, dill, and snap peas. So this recipe was a great fit. I modified a fair bit. 4 slices bacon, 2T butter, 1 green garlic (also from CSA, could use green onion instead), 1/2 bag peas, used turnip greens (about 2c worth), and just a couple sprigs of really fresh dill. I used some of the bacon fat and added the butter to that, then sauteed the turnips in that combo. Added green garlic, then greens, then peas, then added bacon back in with dill. Spectacular results! I'll be making this again.

If you like the bacon, this dish is for you. I loved it, but my husband did not care for it. I did have to cook turnip longer than 9 min, as I don't like it on the crunchy side.

Decided to make this for Thanksgiving since everyone rated it so highly. It hardly got touched. It was very bland. I assumed that the bacon would add good flavor (I even put extra bacon in it) but it did nothing for the dish... couldn't even taste it. I ended up throwing it all away.

The flavor was good-next time I'll use 1 bag of peas. I made this dish a few hours ahead and peas lost color-needs to be served right away.

We never had turnips before and this recipe was great! It was better than the t-bone steak lol

My husband and I were extremely impressed with this delicious dish. To save time, I substituted a bottled lemon dill butter sauce, and because of availability, I added extra turnips, but fewer peas. It was still scrumptious. This is a winner!

My mom hates dill so I substituted parsley. I have never really liked turnips, but this dish was really good. Much better than mom's mushy boiled turnips.

All the flavors in this spectacular side dish melded so well. Everyone at my Christmas dinner loved it! Not only was it delicious, but it looked beautiful on the table. Four forks for ease of preparation, taste, versatility, and presentation.

Everyone really liked this recipe. It's amazing how many people have never eaten a turnip! They (the non turnip eaters in our group) all had these ideas about turnips and when they tasted them, they all were surprised they liked them! I would cook the turnips a little longer before adding the peas next time (maybe 12-15 min total) and cut the butter down. This is an unusual side dish that can go with anything.

This was excellent! It was easy to put together, as I made the bacon and dill butter (using 1/3 as much dried dill) the day before. Having 2 little kids and all the cooking to do for thanksgiving, I even succumbed to using frozen diced turnips! I was hesitant, but it worked out fine (sauteed a little longer), and made this one of the easiest dishes, as well as tasty, even for those who don't normally like turnips. It was well beyond the usual turnip dish. ... good combo of flavors, a colorful addition to the holiday plate! (can't even imagine how the previous reviewer could make this dish and omit the turnips! -not the same dish!)

I omitted the turnips. It was wonderful! I made the bacon and dill butter ahead of time and it made putting this dish together so much easier.
