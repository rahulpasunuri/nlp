delicious and easy, but used half the amount of sugar and about 25% less chocolate chips for 2nd batch.. Much tastier without the extreme sweetness.

Easy, delicious, not time-consuming. Perfect little treats that satisfy without feeling heavy.

This is so easy. First I made them with almonds & mini chocolate chips. Now I'm trying hazelnuts and minis. If I ever have time, high quality dark chocolate would be the way to go.

When you have a Kitchnaid mixer you can do everything in a flash. These are great. I had 8 egg whites from Key Lime pies so I did a marathon meringue bake. I used the listed items and then did some with cocoa powder. Yum!!!! This is a keeper recipe!!!!

These were tasty however they were WAY TOO SWEET! I'll cut the sugar in half next time! I subsituted slivered toasted almonds and the flavour was deelish!

I have a very sweet tooth but this recipe was unbearably sweet, I'll make it again but I'll cut the sugar in half. I substituted slivered toasted almonds and the flavour was great!

These turned out beautifully. My co-workers said they turned out perfectly. Some readers mentioned that they had to bake them longer, but this may be due to making them in summer, when it's humid.

These are a nice variation on a cookie I've made for years. When I was little my mom and I made them with M&M's. You can make them for any holiday with the seasonal M&M colors. Put one MM on top before baking for an accent. My Bull Terriers love them too!

These were easy and fast. I shaped them roughly into hearts on the parchment (for Valentine's Day) and they turned out fine. Followed previous reviewer's suggestions and cut the sugar to a very scant 1/2 c., and added 1T of cocoa powder. Left them in the oven 45 minutes, then turned the oven off and left them in another hour. Great both warm and after they cooled.

Wow! Great! I finally found something I could do with all the leftover eggwhites from the Basic Butter Cookie Dough on this site. (that's a great one, too! Makes a quadruple batch, easy, and absolutely delicious for your cookie press, if you reduce the flour amount slightly.)

The recipe needs two modifications - if you make them, the meringues are delicious. First, add 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder (as some of the other reviewers suggest). It takes some of the edge off the sugar and adds nice color. Two, bake for at least 35 minutes, if not more (I baked for 60 minutes), and then turn the oven off, and leave in for another hour. If you bake for only 25 minutes, the meringues are very fragile and uncooked in the center. Mine (at 60 mins.) are hard throughout, with a slightly softer center. When I do this again, I'll probably bake for 45 mins. (I would also again keep them in the oven with the temperature off for an hour after baking, so they harden before trying to cool outside).

These meringues are delicious. The walnuts and chocolate add a nice substance and texture. They are as good as my favorite choc chip cookies but lighter. I use my favorite quality dark chocolate bar chopped up. Warm out of the oven they melt in your mouth.

This is not a bad recipe per se - the recipe was really easy, the meringue was easy to make - but WAY too sweet. I mean I cut the sugar, added cocoa and extra nuts, but there is no way to make meringue without adding sugar to stabilize it.

I am so happy to have found this recipe. I made these years ago and lost the recipe; not being an instinctive cook my own concoctions never worked. This is a exquisite cookie, very elegant and delicious. They are always the first to disappear when you have a party.

Delicious!!! I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and added cocoa powder (1TBS) to the whites before I added the chocolate chips. Will make this my standard recipe for leftover egg whites.

Rating: 3
it only made about 20-24 and I added cocoa powder (1TBS) to the whites before I added the chocolate chips. They also need to cook for a longer time. (about 10 mins) and let them cool before you transfer to a plate. They disappeared really fast!!

My grandmother called these "Forgotten Cookies" Having a large family, she could preheat the oven to 400 degrees, prepare several batches, place cookie sheets into the oven, and turn off the oven. Hence, she could go about her busy day and when she remembered (cookies in the oven!), no problem

these are good, but 45 cookies???? If you actually do generously rounded tsps as directed, you get about 25 or so.

These are great little cookies. They were a bit too sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup....could be cut even more. Lovely, and easy.

This recipe was excellent. Everything turned out perfectly and the cookies looked beautiful. I also put decorations on top before I baked them in the spirit of Christmas.

Easy as can be, and delicious. The first time I made them I used pecans instead of walnuts and they were great. Second batch I sprinkled with red and green sprinkles for some of that "holiday" feel. Recipe makes less than it says- unless I made the cookies too big. Either way- they are good.
