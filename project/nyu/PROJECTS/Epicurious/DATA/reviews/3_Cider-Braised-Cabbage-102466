This dish offered interesting possibilities. I am not a meat eater but my husband is so I cooked up bacon to crumble and serve on the side. I also intensified the apple flavor by cooking peeled, cored and sliced apples (2 macouns since that's what I had on hand) into the cider. I mashed the apples after they were cooked and returned to the cider to reduce to a semi-thick liquid. I then added 1 large carmelized yellow onion that had been processed with some of the cider mixture. That's the liquid I used to braise the cabbage. I will most certainly make this dish again and "fiddle" with it some more!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I couldn't taste the apple (even after adding more cider) and it was very bland. I had to add some bacon to salvage it in time for Christmas dinner, but I was still displeased with the results. Still trying to figure out what to do with the leftovers.

very nice flavor. as others did, I started with bacon & sauteed the cabbage and onion in the rendered fat first. cabbage does burn easily, so cook on medium. I also added thinly sliced red apple at the braising stage, which worked out well. I would just caution that you either use a bit less braising liquid than called for, or leave more time on the back end to cook it down -- otherwise it may be a bit watery.

This is quite tasty! I love cabbage but was looking for a healther version than southern style sauted in mass quantities of butter. This fits the bill.

This was pretty good, but only after I seasoned it with a lot of salt at the end. It might also be good with some celery salt or toasted caraway seeds to help the flavor out a bit. I'll probably make this again because my husband liked it and it was a quick and easy way to prepare a cabbage side dish. But it definitely wasn't one of my favorite recipes.

this is one of the best ways to eat cabbage, in my opinion. i usually cook chopped bacon in the pot until crispy, remove it, and instead of butter use the bacon grease for the onions/cabbage, and then added back the bacon at the end. one time i didn't have apple cider in the house, and used orange juice. you couldn't really even tell the difference.

This is an amazing dish - great with ham or brats. You can't go wrong with this recipe because the cook times are extremely flexible. As long as you don't singe the cabbage, I don't think there's any way to ruin this dish. For a super low-cal side, cut butter in half and use light apple juice and allspice rather than sugary cider, spray with spray butter and then sprinkle with a tiny bit of Splenda before serving. Almost no calories!

Best cabbage I've ever had; definitely a recipe for the non-cabbage eater. The apple cider really mellows out the flavor, nice complement to traditional corned beef.

We loved this dish. I rated it three forks because it is hard to call cabbage "a dish beyond compare", but we will be making this a lot. I used apple juice because that is what I had, and it came out fine. I am looking forward to making it with cider. I also added some crisp bacon. We served it with sausage.

This is such an easy way to prepare cabbage and it didn't produce the usual lingering cabbagy odor in the kitchen. The hint of apple flavor is delightful. I added a little freshly ground white pepper and substituted two shallots for the onion because that is what I had on hand. It was an excellent accompaniment for bourbon glazed salmon. It would also go well with pork. My husband definitely wants this again.

Using Bacon and red pepper flakes are a must!! The first time I made this it was bland, yet the best way to cook cabbage I have seen. Adding the Bacon and Red pepper flakes enhanced the color and the flavor.

Loved it! I'm a huge cabbage fan anyway, but this was the best. I added 3 slices of bacon to the recipe just cause I like to watch my arteries harden, hehe. Seriously, the bacon added a nice smokey touch. I cooked it first and eliminated half the butter. I also added a pinch of fresh thyme.

Great way to make cabbage - and it doesn't smell up the house either. We'll do this again for sure.

Easy and surprisingly good. I've made this several times with pork chops and German dishes, and everyone liked it and requested it again. A little tangy but not at all overpowering. It's now my favorite way to make cabbage.

I've made this many times; we use olive oil, season with lots of salt and pepper, and serve it with pan-grilled chicken-apple sausages. A great cold-weather meal.

"This is cabbage?" was the question received from my doubtful, non-cabbage loving husband. The aroma during cooking indicated it would be a surprise, and this no-leftovers recipe did not disappoint. It was amazing how sweet, but mild, this dish was. It would go with just about anything; we served it with chicken. Make it again? Since I made only a quarter of the cabbage head (and recipe), we'll have it three more times very soon.
