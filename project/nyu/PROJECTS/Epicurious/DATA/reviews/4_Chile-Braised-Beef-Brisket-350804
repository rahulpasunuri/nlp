I couldn't find pasilla chiles and substituted one jalepeno -- worked to perfection. The brisket had a nice little kick to it! The family loved it for Rosh Hashanah dinner and I was quite pleased at the moistness and flavor. I would add a touch of flour to the stock to thicken at the end to get a little richer gravy.

Question please. I'm making this tomorrow. The dried Pasilla chiles I found are large, each about 6" long. I don't want to overdo the chiles--did others use similarly large chiles or were yours smaller. I'm worried that 12 large chiles will be too many. Thanks

I made this last night and thought it was delicious. The flavors blended beautifully. The only problem I had was the peppers and fennel seed rub burned a bit and I did not get a good browning on the meat. But the end result was terrific.

For Passover last year I made this along with Nate Waxmans (sp?) onion, garlic, traditional brisket, which is a staple at our home and wonderful. To my surprise, at the end of the evening, this left field brisket was polished off and the traditional one still had a few servings. Different and delicious. I did make some changes though. I used fresh roasted poblano peppers as a substitute for the dried pasilla chiles. Also didn't have a star anise so just added a little extra fennel. Definitely a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly and found it fairly good but not great. All those dried pasilla chiles leave an "oilyness" to the sauce which I didn't care for (it wasn't fat from the beef.) I was hoping for more spice taste.

I approached this with some trepidation but it came out wonderfully. Also didn't have some of the ingredients. Used fresh poblanos instead of dried and a chili powder/garam masala mix. Fresh and exotic. Was a hit with my family.

Very good recipe. I was fortunate to have an organic, grass fed brisket from Bill the Butcher in Woodinville, WA. I followed the directions except I had guajillo peppers and used those. I was rushing and dind't realize I was supposed to rub the outside with ground peppers in addition to the anise and fennel, but it still turned out very flavorful. My son said "this is the best kind of shredded meet I've ever eaten!" With that compliment I will definitely be making this again!

I served this at a party using a full brisket and upped the ingredients to compensate. I thought I would have plenty of left overs. It was a major hit. Nothing was left and several people left asking for the recipe. I did add garlic and used broth instead of chicken stock and used canned chopped tomatoes. I would not recommend doubling the sauce portions since I had plenty left over to discard. I did put the veggies and liquid through the blender after cooking making a great thick sauce for the meat.

This recipe deserves 10 forks!! Absolutely wonderful, followed the recipe as is except I didn't have sherry vinegar, so used regular sherry and added a little vinegar. The sauce is a little tangy from the tomatoes and only subtly spicy. I made this for our Christmas dinner and all raved about it. I only wish I could take credit for the recipe. A must try.
