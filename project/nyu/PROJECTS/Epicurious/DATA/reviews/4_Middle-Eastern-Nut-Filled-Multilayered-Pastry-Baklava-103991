Made this today and to my greatest surprise (never ever made Baklava before) it came out very well. Few modifications: 2 cups of sugar for syrup is plenty enough; had only 1 cup of walnuts and 1.5 cup of sunflower seeds; did not use any of the optional ingredients. And was very conservative on butter also (0.5 max).. I cannot wait to do it with pistachios next time!

Great recipe, I don't use the corn syrup and always use butter - no oil! I often take it on the trail, which means packing it up the side of a mountain for 3 or 4 hours on horseback, so I build it like a jelly role and slice into spirals and bake as you would cinnamon buns. That way I can put the finished rounds back together and roll up in foil to pack behind my saddle. Way more convenient and less messy than a tray. I also think the syrup soaks in better with this construction. I never pack any DOWN the mountain!

I used half the butter called for, and half the syrup recipe using honey and sugar. It came out perfect!

This is my first time making baklava and my first time working with philo dough and I must say I am impressed and motivated by this recipie. It took a fairly difficult pastry dish and made it relativley easy to make, so much so that next time i think i'll have my daughters help! The only suggestion I would have is to make it with almonds over the walnuts. Although walnuts are the nut normally found in baklava in most stores Almonds have a less dense and oily texture making it somewhat more pleasent in baklava. Also, corn syrup is not necessary in the syrup. I made it both ways and prefered the very basic honey, sugar, water and cardmom option. And in order to make the syrup thicker you have to cook it for longer than the recipie states and make sure it is a large pot so it doesn't boil over when you do put it on med heat.

I did a mixed version using pistachios and walnuts but with the Persian flavored syrup. I replaced the corn syrup with golden syrup also as I don't like the flavor of the other, and used 2 full teaspoons of cinnamon in the filling. It was delicious!

This is an excellent baklava recipe! I hadn't made it in years and could not find our family recipe. I needed to refresh my memory, so I tried this one. I add 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice to the syrup, which makes it perfect! Give this a try, the extra lemon adds a "bite" to the very sugary sweetness!

This is a really wonderful baklava. I agree, however, with previous reviewers that the recipe makes too much syrup. I used it all and mine is soggy and sitting in syrup. There is so much syrup that we have the pan titled and are trying to drain some of it off. The issue is not too much sweetness. Instead there is too much liquid. I thought I boiled down the syrup per previous reviewers but I guess not enough. I also found that the recipe calls for too much phyllo per weight. Using 3 layers of phyllo w/ 8 sheets per layer I only used 8 oz of dough (one sleeve of Athens brand). I recommend using the sugar + honey for the syrup. I added 2 tsp. organge blosson water to the syrup (in addition to using the lemon juice). This gave it a nice aromatic quality. Be careful not to use too much, though, or your baklava will taste like soap.

RUN don't walk to your nearest frozen food grocery isle, pick up the phyllo and make this divine dessert. I broke the process up across two evenings: made the syrup and the nut mixture one night and assembled everything the next day. Very easy. I also sprayed each layer with Pam vs. lathering it with 2 sticks of butter. I know the butter is a gift from the gods, but this took the caloric count down quite a bit. The pan came out of the oven and the first piece went into my mouth immediately after applying the syrup. It's still not cooled completely and I'm jonesing for another hunk of baklava love. Mmmmmmmmmm.

The baklava is NOT supposed to be crunchy. The version that you buy in supermarkets is dried out old baklava, that's why it's crunchy. I grew up around people making baklava from scratch, and women boasted about the baklava being soft (not mushy though). For this, the syrup should not be too thin (turning the baklava to mush) or too thick (and not absorbed, making the baklava crunchy). Agree, more cloves needed. Also, no need to add filling in separate layers - one layer of filling (or 2 at most) does it for me and is easiest.

Rating: 2
Needs more clove and cinnamon. Also, try with just honey. Syrup sucks. Too wet. Baklava lost it's crunch. This recipe makes 2 layers of nuts. Try using 24 oz instead for 3 layers. Baked at 350 for a longer time. Took a while to brown. I would not make this recipe again without the above modifications.

Made 4 pans today for X'mas treats. I added double the cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. extra of cardamom to both the filling and syrup. I added all the syrup in one pan and it was a bit soggy for my taste. The next pans I added 1/2 the syrup and preferred that amount. I didn't lower the temperature just baked for about 40 minutes at 350. Mmmm good.

This was delicious!! I've never made baklava before and I was a little concerned about how difficult it would be, but it wasn't at all! Although, it was much, much more time consuming than I thought it would be. Even so, I would still take the time to butter each individual layer. I used blanched, slivered almonds in my recipe more because of what the introduction said they meant than anything. None of my friends that tried it had ever had it with almonds, but we all agreed it was really delicious! My Armenian friend also strongly approved, despite being used to the Paklava version! :)

I love baklava and I love this recipe. Tastes as good as or better than the many I've had in middle eastern restaurants. I made it with the honey, 3 cloves and the recommended amt. of cardamom and otherwise basically stuck to the recipe (used a few more phyllo sheets). I also used the corn syrup - not sure if that was necessary or not. Will definitely make it again - but only when there's enough people to share b/c it's SO addictive.

Wonderful recipe! It was quite easy to make, and it got rave reviews from everyone who had it. I ended up with too much syrup, but I drained it a little, and it was fine. (Next time I'll boil it down more). Definitely use cardamom in the syrup and nut filling for an authentic Middle Eastern taste.

I made this yesterday and brought it to my Supper Club tonight. I've never worked with phyllo before and was a bit nervous to make it, but with over 70 positive reviews, I figured that this recipe would be worth it. I used walnuts and pecans, and butter between the layers. My 13x9 pyrex pan fit the phyllo sheets perfectly. I had plenty of syrup left over. It came out light, flaky, butter and delicious. Everyone enjoyed it. I had a lot of fun making it as well.

I made this yesterday and brought it to my supper club this evening. Big hit! I've never worked with phyllo before and felt a bit nervous to make this, but with over 70 reviews, I figured it was worth it. I made the recipe as printed, but used a little less sugar with the nuts. I used pecans and walnuts, and butter between the layers. My pan was a pyrex 13x9 which fit the phyllo sheets perfectly. I had syrup left over because I drizzled, like the recipe says. The baklava was light, flaky, buttery and delicious. I had fun making it, and everyone at Supper Club enjoyed it, too.

Made this for a New Year's Eve party.Used a mix of pistachios, walnuts and almonds Got rave reviews-a woman who had lived in Turkey told me it tasted just like they make it there. Apparently the way it's normally made in the states involves way too much honey so an overwhelming honey flavor. The only problem I had was getting the pieces to stay together. I'll try cutting through all the layers before baking next time as some of the previous reviewers suggested.

I had never eaten Baklava before, let alone tried to make it! It took a little longer to make than I expected, but I would chalk that up to my inexperience with phyllo dough. I used cardamom instead of cloves, and I got RAVE reviews. My father-in- law said it was the best he had ever had - it really was DELICIOUS!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe. For ingredients, I used the honey, freshly ground cardamom and unblanched, toasted almonds. Based on some of the comments, I was tempted to cut back on the syrup, but decided to stick to the recipe. It was the perfect amount. I used an 8x12 glass pan and cut it (right through) into 24 squares before pouring on the syrup. For serving, I cut each square in two triangles. These smaller portions were a good size for a party and the end result was not overly sweet and not too gooey to eat with fingers. Once I had my ingredients prepped, assembly only took 20 minutes  how much time would you save by pouring oil over the top? Yuk. Even though I brushed each phyllo layer generously with butter, I ended up using much less than a cup  not sure why, but the end result was perfect and got many compliments.

Rating: 4
WOW. There are a few things that are lacking in the recipe (the basic one) DO NOT ADD BUTTER TO THE NUTS AND SPICES. I did the first time. Once I made it again, it was just wonderful. The first try was still quite tasty, but butter was dripping all over. Not good if you are watching your fat intake haha.

I made this recipe twice. Once to practice, and again as dessert for a Middle Eastern theme dinner party for 15 guest. The two guests I was worried about DEVOURED it stating "I normally don't like Baklava, but I really like this!". Mom liked it, too. 'nuff said. To digigirl's point, the syrup was more than required, but I found that a little extra boiling/reducing got the right consistency the 2nd time I tried it and I wasted less than a cup. Also, I used orange blossom honey in the syrup and a touch of cardamom with the cloves.

This was the BEST baklava I have ever eaten, if I do say so myself!!! I made it for dessert at a dinner party, and I saw one of our guests sneak a bit off her boyfriend's plate when he wasn't looking, AFTER having finished her own. It really was that good! I made it three days in advance and kept it covered at room temperature. I didn't find it dry at all, and I'm a fan of the gooey baklava. The only thing I would change for next time is to do four layers of pastry and three layers of nuts, but I think that's mostly because I used a different-sized baking dish.

Rating: 4
Not as difficult as it sounds to make. I did reduce the lemon juice, left out the cloves. Use butter only, no vegatable oil and you don't need parchment paper. Mixed blanched almonds and pistachios. Baked at 350 for 45 mins and then 300 for 30 mins and it came out perfect. I cut the pieces bigger than stated so that they maintained their shape. It is very rich. Use all the syrup!

I made this for mother's day, everyone loved it. The only modifications I made were that I left the sugar out of the nut mixture, I cut through all the layers before baking (I heard it was easier in the long run to do it this way), and I used about 40 sheets of phyllo dough (still one pound) and made 3 layers of nuts and 4 layers of dough.

UGH- I hate to be one of the people who asks a question and hasn't made the recipe yet, but here I go. I've been reading other baklava recipes, and they say to cut through ALL the layers before baking, I was wondering why this one says to just cut through the first before baking and how that changes the recipe. Any info would be appreciated. Baklava is one of my mother's favorites and I want to make it for her for Mother's Day. Thanks!!

A new tradition has started. I made the baklava for Easter last year and everyone loved it. I plan on making it every year. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 cup honey - plenty sweet. I made the syrup the day before assembly and reheated it before use. Due to our dry climate, I made sure all components were ready before assembly so I could work quickly and not dry out the phyllo dough. Delicious!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. This time I ramped up the spices in the sugar syrup, more cinnamon, a good slice of lemon rind, honey, clove and cardamom. I wanted a thicker syrup, so I cooked it several minutes longer and it was perfect. These minor alterations produced the Baklava I was searching for. YUMMY! PS: Make sure you use fresh spices...it is necessary in a recipe with delicate flavors such as this.

This was superb baklava. I used freshly ground cardamom in the syrup and the cinnamon in the nut mixture for spices, melted butter between the phyllo sheets, and a mixture of walnuts and pistachios (both raw) for the filling. I was worried about the syrup- I'm inexperienced when it comes to cooking sugar, and I didn't have a candy thermometer to check the temperature. So, I consulted a few cookbooks, and concluded that I should simply bring the syrup to a boil and let it boil for about 5 minutes, which resulted in perfect syrup. I also put parchment paper in the pan with the edges hanging out, so that I could just lift the whole thing out of the pan at the end and cut on a cutting board. It all worked perfectly.

Excellent baklava. I made one for a family gathering and everybody loved it. I followed the suggestion of one cook and baked it for 30 minutes at 375. I did not use additional sugar or spices in the filling. I used 5 tbs of lemon juice and added some grated orange peel. Skipped on the cardamom (too expensive) and used ground cinnamon instead. It came out wonderfully tasty and everything I hoped for.

This recipe is identical to the one I got from my mother-in-law, who is Greek. Here are some time-saving tips: there is no need to toast any nuts unless you just don't care for raw nuts. I would leave out the corn syrup and the sugar in the nuts (unnecessary). Also she bakes hers at 375 for 30 minutes. It turns out a nice golden brown, so I was surprised to see that this recipe called for longer baking times at lower temperatures. Making baklava is not hard, but a lot of people make it harder than it needs to be! Do yourself a favor and do it the easy way, because the stuff will still come out FABULOUS!

This was deceptively simple to make and much cheaper than buying it from a store. I used black walnuts and pecans the first go around the walnuts overpowered the taste. I made it with pistachios and it was perfect. I used a bitter Seville orange juice and zest, plus orange blossom and rose water which gave it a aromatic quality. Do let them sit for a few days, yes, it is *torture* but they are so much better.

I am a fairly experienced baker and yet have always been scared off by baklava. This recipe made it pretty easy and very delicious. I definitely used all the syrup and it was very gooey, but shouldn't it be? The top was still wonderfully crisp and the nuts still had some cruch. I used all walnuts, soaked them in a bowl of water for about 30 mins and them toasted them in a 350 degree oven for about 30 mins. I did used the food processor to chop, but was careful to do in gently. Delicious!

To the cook from Wakefield, MA: unsalted pistachios are available in Indian groceries. Salted pistachios will work well too. Rinse them liberally with water and recrisp by roasting the nuts in an oven or on the stovetop.

this is awesome! and not as time consuming as some have said. i agree: DO NOT USE OIL! or you're wasting time and calories. it was overall a bit thinner than i've had in resteraunts. next time i may make it twice as thick? i used all the syrup and needed more, because as people have said, the top layers did dry out. i added about 12 cardamom pods, stick cinnamon and at least a teaspoon of nutmeg to the syrup while it heated, and it gave a nice warm spiciness to the finished product.

This dish is absolutely incredible. I baked it for a Christmas party and felt awful because mine was the only dessert anybody touched---people were taking plates of it home! I followed the recipe to a T with ground cardamom and 1 cup of honey in the syrup and a half-walnut/half-almond mixture for the filling and had no trouble with it browning at the given time and temperature. However, I only used about 2/3 of the syrup and the bottom was still very soggy, but nobody complained! Next time I will probably only use half the syrup, though I did save some to spoon over the top layers as they do become a little dry and flaky while being stored. And remember to be patient and take your time cutting the layers or you'll make a mess of it...but altogether, a winning recipe that I will make again and again!

I have made this recipe a number of times, and it is the most fantastic and crowd pleasing thing I've ever brought to a dinner party. I never knew baklava could be as easy as the "variations" suggestions in this recipe. I don't brush my dough but instead cut it and pour in the vegetable oil. It still comes out brown and flaky and perfect. I like to pour in 2/3 of the syrup and let it sit overnight, and then serve it the next day with the rest of the (warmed) syrup poured over. A food processor speeds up the nut chopping. I use a variation of nuts - I toast some of them but don't bother blanching the almonds.

I discovered that I love Baklava this summer while on vacation in Greece, and I couldn't wait to try this recipe. It is excellent. And believe me, the real stuff is REALLY sticky and dripping with syrup, so my suggestion is don't bother making this if you're squeamish about messes or calories. Use all the syrup! It is just plain delicious. I made individual triangular mini-baklavas, wrapping a tablespoonful of nuts in a neat little package of phyllo. Either way, it's worth the effort and also makes for a very presentable, impressive dessert.

Well. This was a great dish, but first a caveat: Blanching almonds takes time. But unsalted pistachios are hard to find. Secondly, I found that the syrup mixture turns out to be much more than you actually need. Next time I will only use half of it, because I thought it made the baklava a little too sticky, especially at the bottom of the pan where it all sunk. Still, I will make this again. It was a special treat for a special occasion and got many compliments.

DELICIOUS! This has to be the most tasty pastry I've ever made. It's time-consuming, but extremely easy.

This was much easier than I expected and it turned out better than most store bought baklava I've had.

amazed how authentic this recipe is. i grew up watching my mom and grandma making baklava from scratch (and rolling the phyllo). a few tips however: (1) do not use oil! butter is so much better(2) bake at 300 for 2 hours not very close to the bottom of the oven. an indication that it's done is if you shake the pan gently the baklava moves (3) do not worry about the phyllo drying, it is actually better that way because it doesn't get soggy and the sheets don't stick together. (4) use much less lemon that what the recipe says, 1-2 tsp would do it. the lemon is used to prevent the sugar in the syrup from crystallizing not for the taste (5) do not eat it right away. in my family baklava was made a week before we planned to eat it. one reason is that it gets even better with time. a second reason is that a day or two before eating we would make another pot of syrup (a bit thicker this time, maybe 4c sugar and 1 1/2 c water) and pour it on the slightly warmed baklava. (this is in addition to the first syrup which is poured right after the baklava is baked). it may sound like too much (and it is, don't even try to count calories) but it's well worth it.

Rating: 4
I tried the "oil" variation ... fabulous! I was afraid that using oil would negatively impact flavor of the finished pastry. Not so! The finished product was lighter that I expected and the flavor of the syrup really came out even more. Several guests commented that while they don't usually like baklava, this was excellent ... baklava lovers raved that it was the best they'd ever eaten! A minor comment on the recipe ... the syrup takes longer to cook at this altitude (Denver, Colorado) than reported (also I made the recipe x 4) ... I cooked the syrup for about 25 minutes and it never reached the stated temperature although it did reduce sufficiently to provide an appropriate thickening. Otherwise, great recipe!!!

My first foray into phyllo -- with this recipe it was HUGE success. These were absolutely exactly what baklava should be. But what no one tells you is that it is so darn much FUN to make! To make it authentic, I used a lot more honey and lots of it, much less sugar, NO corn syrup, and walnuts. I decided to add a generous amount of ground cardamom seeds to the honey sauce, and I thought that was quite delightful. I'll keep making this for a long time.

This was my first time making baklava, so maybe it was just me. I was unsure of how much of the syrup to pour over the hot baklava. There is A LOT of syrup if you follow the recipe. I ended up using too much, and it was a mushy mess. I would try this recipe again if I could figure out how much syrup to use. It was very vague in the instructions. Can anyone help? To others that will try this recipe....be careful with the amount of syrup and bake longer than directed.

This was ridiculously easy, other than the fact that working with phyllo can be tricky (hint: it needs to be defrosted for a day beforehand if you buy it frozen at the grocery store!) I didn't add sugar to the nuts, and it came out excellently. I'd also highly recommend using some honey as I think you can definitely taste it in the finished product.

I agree with previous reviewers that the recipe needs to cook longer. I would do 30 minutes at 350, and then 30 minutes at 300. I also feel that you don't need sugar in the nuts - the syrup is sweet enough. Otherwise, as good as my old recipe.

In the syrup I used part honey and part sugar, the lemon juice, some whole cardamon seeds, 5 whole cloves and the cinnamon sticks. I used the ground cloves and the cinnamon in the filling, for which I used part pistachios, part walnuts and part whole blanched almonds. I used 10 tablespoons butter, melted, and the rest oil for pouring over top the UNBAKED baklava, then let it all sit for 10 minutes before I baked it. I did have to bake the baklava a few minutes longer than the recipe called for. This is perfect and absolutely breathtaking!

I was unable to make due to no instructions in the recipe...just ingredients....
