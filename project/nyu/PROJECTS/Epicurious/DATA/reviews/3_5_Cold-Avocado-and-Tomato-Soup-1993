This is a good recipe but definitely needs work. As others have noted, you need to add MUCH more chicken stock to the avocado soup; it is more like a dip as written. The tomato soup is also good but I don't think they work side-by-side so well. The tomato soup gets very water-y right away and seeps into the other side. Not sure how to fix this. But both soups were delicious.

I had some left over and found out why you can't make this more than 4 hours in advance: the avocado oxidizes and becomes a dark brownygreen. Not very attractive, but it tastes the same. The tomato part improved overnight. I made this with cilantro, not being a fan of tarragon. It pushed the dish toward gazpacho, but not in a bad way.

This is a GREAT recipe. I made it for company and they wanted the recipe. I added a little cream to the tomato soup to reduce the acidity a little.

This is an outstanding summer soup. I didn't make any changes but did fiddle a bit with the liquid quantities.I kept them fairly thick. the juxtaposition of flavours works so well. I've served it several times already and response is universally enthusiastic. And it looks beautiful in a soup plate.

The avocado part of the soup was wonderful with the addition of a pinch of cayenne pepper, however, the tomato part was overpowered by the tarragon. I would recommend using basil or cilantro instead. My guests were not impressed with the soup!

I'd like to make the soup the a day in advance; anyone see any problem with that? I wonder why the creator was so specific as to say "4 hours."

I also added more broth to the avocado soup along with white pepper to both. EXCELLENT!

This was really easy to make and tasted great. My only problem was with the presentation as I could not figure out how to swirl the two soups together.

This was a delicious and beautiful soup. Perfect for a "ladies lunch".

My family loves this soup, and it's easy to make. It's a great way to use the bounty of tomatoes in our garden at this time of year. The avocado part is invariably too thick, so be sure to add more broth.
