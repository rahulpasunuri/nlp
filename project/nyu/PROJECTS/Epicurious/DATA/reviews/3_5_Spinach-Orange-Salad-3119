This is an absolutely delicious salad. The dressing is wonderful, the flavors fresh and flavorful. I heartily recommend this recipe.

Fabulous. Made it exactly as specified and brought it to Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone loved it, even my spinach-hating brother.

I just used the dressing from this recipe and thought it was wonderful. For my salad I used spinach, (canned) mandarin oranges, and pecans. It was delicious with the "Grilled Citrus Salmon" and "Sweet Potato Salad with Orange-Maple Dressing" both from this site.

This looks very pretty, especially when served in my black bowls, but sadly, wasn't worth the effort. Very mediocre, will not make again.

I made this for Mothers Day and got several requests for the recipe. I added a little bit of soy sauce to the dressing to contrast the sweetness. I'm making it again (today actually!) for our Memorial Day Celebration. Delicious!

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was a big hit! Delicious dressing. I used canned mandarin oranges and substituted red wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar.

This salad was nothing to write home about. There are too many good salad recipes out there to bother with this one again.

The dressing in this salad is particularly exceptional!

ridiculously tasty, suspicously easy...

This is a fantastic salad! I have made it several times. Since my grocery store did not carry jicama, I substituted water chestnuts, which worked well since they are similar in texture. Baby spinach is so much yummier than older spinach; it's all I use in salads now. When adding the dressing, you probably won't need to use all of it which the recipe makes. Note that the recipe states "coat lightly" with the dressing. And with any tossed salad, don't add the dressing until right before serving, or else the spinach will wilt.

At first glance I thought this recipe contained a strange combination of ingredients. It is time consuming, but not at all difficult and the result is exceptional. This is a really delious prelude to any meal.
