I'll give this 3 forks because it's easy to make and tastes good, but this is a seriously strange recipe. Why add the rice right in to the stir-fry? Why not make the stir fry (possibly making it a bit "saucier" by adding a little bit of broth and cornstarch) and then serve it over the rice? Then you don't have to go through the extra step of cooking, then cooling the rice beforehand. This would keep better as leftovers, too (no waterlogged rice). Also, I'd decrease the ginger to 1/2T and add 1/4 tsp crushed Szechuan peppercorns.

Very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except I used tofu instead of scallops (boyfriend is allergic to shellfish). It was hearty and filling, but felt very healthy. The broccolini was crisp and delicious. The more heat, the better!

Excellent dish. Really good bay scallops are easily overpowered. There is more than enough seasoning in the recipe as written. Adding more would make the scallops insignificant. We used twice as many scallops - 1 1/2 lbs for three people with the same amount of rice and veggies. It was perfect. Do not add the extra salt at the end. The soy adds more than enough salt.

This is definitely a keeper. Easy to make and delicious. I added one chopped jalapeno to the vegetable mixture to "spice it up" and doubled the ginger and garlic. Also threw in a half cup of chopped cilantro. Very good!

this was awesome! I was going to save some for lunch the next day but I ended up eating it all! I used broccolli, and I didn't have the oriental sauce, so I omited that but it needed extra soy sauce in place of that. I used a jalepeno instead of crushed red pepper... and olive oil instead of veg. deeeeelicious!

I was a great, easy, and tasty. Don't need the scallops for a quick side dish. Just enough of spicy. I agree this is easy for company because it make ahead, quick cook, and colorful.

We thought this rice was very good. I made it without the scallops, just as a side dish with pork chops. I cut the broccolini in thirds. Very easy to make for company as you can do so much of the prep in advance.

I like to serve this recipe for dinner parties because it's unique yet easy to make...the actual cooking time is very fast, so I can fry it up while my guests are there and serve it hot. I have always substituted true broccoli for broccolini however.

I, too used jasmine rice, since that's what I had, a little extra garlic and ginger and double the red pepper flakes. When I saw FRESH bay scallops at the store today I couldn't pass up this recipe. A real keeper!

Great for leftover rice. Spicy and delicious. I used baby broccoli and frozen seafood medley from Trader Joe's (shrimp, scallops, and calamari)and it was just delicious. I would imagine this is a great way to transform leftovers and stuff in the freezer into microwavable lunches for the week.

Super easy, common ingredients, very adaptable. Nothing special(basic "asian flavors") even with extra garlic, ginger and pepper flakes. Used bulghur since that's what I had on hand and broccoli because that's all I could today. Healthful, satisfying but I won't be making this recipe again.

This was easy to prepare and good. Used broccoli and more scallops

Have made this with broccolini and scallops, and again with shrimp and just broccoli (husband didn't like the broccolini). With the shrimp version I used white jasmine rice cooked in canned chicken broth, and added some sliced mushrooms with the rest of the veggies. We love both versions. I would also like to try using asparagus in place of the broccolini. YUM!

This is a great fast dish with fantastic flavours. I used rappini for extra spice and used Tamari soy (just because I like the flavour it imparts better). Used Nova Scotia dry scallops which were exceptional.

I loved the flavors. Broccolini isn't in season here, so used broccoli instead. Worked great. Next time I'll sear diver scallops and use the rice and broccolini or broccoli as a side dish. Bay scallops are hit or miss here.

A quick and yummy recipe. A good way to use left over rice. I would use a little less soy sauce next time.

Very simple and satisfying. I might add more ginger next time. Would be good with chicken or tofu too.

This was really good and really easy. I added more garlic and ginger, otherwise it was exactly as written. This would be good with chicken or tofu, perhaps even better. One note, my husband and I managed to finish this amount between the two of us. I'd double it if I was going to serve this as the main course for four.

Nice, but probably would not pricey, wonderful scallops for such a casual meal.

I doubled the garlic and ginger, and used jasmine rice which gave a wonderful scent. Apologies to the Chefs who did this originally! Definitely a keeper!!
