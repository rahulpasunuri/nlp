Very bland & disappointing. You could try to improve the flavor by adding more garlic, more sun dried tomato, more red pepper, salt & pepper but why? Just find a different recipe!

I substituted fresh kale and asparagus for spinach. Based on what other cooks said I used: 2 cubes (about 1/4 Cup) of homemade pesto. 1 whole dried red pepper. 2 LARGE garlic cloves. 1/2 Cup of sun dried tomatoes. 1/2 Cup walnuts. It was great! Not much like the original recipe, but very tasty.

This recipe is based on a classic Italian combination of ricotta, spinach, Parmesan, garlic and nuts. I made this with great success substituting the walnuts with pignoli and using the water tossed off from the spinach to loosen the pasta instead of the pasta water. Nothing bland here. We found it very comforting and tasty. i don't know where the crushed red pepper came from -- not needed here.

Enjoyed this dish thoroughly although as I do with many pasta dishes found the proportion of spinach to noodles too low. Needed less noodles or more spinach... I did make a few alterations based on reviews... Instead of the noodle water I mixed fresh lemon juice into the ricotta. Also I didn't have parmesan but did have pecorno romano so used that. Also as I have toddlers to feed too I didn't put the red pepper in the dish at all although had it at the table to pass - ended up not needing that. I would certainly make this again - quick, easy, and tasty.

This was absolutely the worst Pasta recipe ever! In spite of using 5 cloves of garlic, this was awful and soooooo bland. If I could have given it no forks, I would have.

The other reviews were right, this is extremely bland. I also thought that the spiciness of the red pepper flakes was completely wrong in this recipe, it would have been better without (though flavorless). I added salt and some olive tapenade to try and give it more flavor but it didn't work. Don't waste your time with this.

I took a few suggestions from reviews and used 4 med cloves of garlic (next time I'll use 5-6), 1/2 cup drained sun-dried tomatoes, and split the olive oil (half olive oil & half butter) to saute the walnuts. I always use a good quality whole milk ricotta (Polly-O or Biazzo) and salt it well. We all enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

Used 5 (small) cloves of garlic, about 1/3 cup of sun dried tomatoes & a heaping teapoon of red pepper flakes. Toasted the walnuts in butter, rather than olive oil. With those changes and a good shake of salt & some freshly group pepper, this was delicious.

I doubled the garlic and significantly increased the red pepper, but other than that, made it as is and it was easy and tasty. I do think it would have been bland without the extra heat, but with it,it was good.

Bland. I think the idea of a simple sauce made from the ricotta and pasta water is a great idea, but this recipe really lacks personality. I tried adding prosciutto, red onion, red bell peppers, mushrooms, you name it, its still bland. I think what's missing is acidity, not salt. The heavy walnut-infused oil permeates the recipe and there's nothing "zingy" to counterbalance it.

OK, not great. I used toasted pine nuts, since hubby is allergic to walnuts. He suggested adding kalamata olives next time. All in all, an easy, but not spectacular, weeknight dinner....

This recipe was OK but I think with some additions it could be very good. I used asparagus instead of spinach but that didn't seem to be the problem. Perhaps substituting goat cheese for ricotta might work or as the other reviewers mentioned proscuitto for that needed saltiness.

I used 1 bag frozen spinach, which cut down on time and worked great. The ricotta added just the right amount of creaminess without being too heavy like an alfredo sauce. I did add: some diced ham (2 quarter-inch steaks, cubed), about 1 cup grated Parmesan, and a bunch of chopped fresh basil to this recipe -- without these, the recipe would have been too bland. I agree with cook below who said toasting the walnuts is key -- toss them in at the last minute to keep crunchy. (This is why I found the dish better right away, rather than for leftovers when the walnuts aren't as toasty.)

Well, after reading the other reviews, i was hesitant to make this recipe, but my wifey was in the mood for all of this texture, so I gave it a whirl. My version came out great. I used Rotini, so the little bits of walnuts could get caught in the tube. I also added 1/4 pound of prociutto, slightly cooked in the spinach mixture until it was a little crispy. I think the prociutto added the needed saltiness and kick to make this dish work out....by the way, it was great the second day!!!!

Revising my review: I made this dish with whole wheat farfalle. Freshly made, it was bland with only the sundried tomatoes giving it any spark of flavor. I had hoped that giving it time for the flavors to blend would help. It didn't. The leftovers tasted like paste and no amount of salt, pepper, parmesan, garlic, etc. could help. I ended up dumping almost half of it in the trash (which made the trash smell like paste, too!). Too bad, since I really like each of the individual ingredients. Try the Farfalle with Broccoli and Gorgonzola instead. Very yummy!

I increased the garlic and pepper flakes and decreased the pasta. I used a 20-ounce package of frozen spinach, cooking the spinach until it was dry. I served it with stewed tomatoes and my husband loved it. I would serve it to guests. I thought the walnuts were the key ingredient.

The first day that I made this, i found it watery and badly in need of salt. after adding the salt, it was better, but the flavors were watered down. The next day, however, after storing it overnight in the fridge, i rewarmed it in the mircrowave and it was delicious!

My sister-in-law says she made this with feta and it was outstanding. My husband has fetaphobia so I don't think I'll try that. But, it might be worth a shot for others. I thought it was okay for a family party as is.

I have to say that this recipe was the first from Bon Appetit that I was not wild about. It was easy and quick to prepare, but blah, as others have commented. I found myself wishing for some prociutto. I did like how creamy it was. Next time I will beef up the garlic and add chicken, I think.

The pasta is not as white as the pictures in the magazine. Good flavor, but my husband added a lot of pepper. Don't know if this is the answer.

Very simple and tasty pasta to make. I used sun-dried tomato that was not packed in oil - I first softened in boiling water, then added the oil and let sit for 15 mins which worked well. I like the previous reader suggestion of serving with grilled chicken.

I always have to add my own flare to the recipes and I highly recommend trying pecans in stead of walnuts and I didn't have spinach or ricotta cheese in the house so I substituted 3 tablespoons of pesto and 1 cup of cottage cheese. It ended up making quite a lovely dish.

This recipe is lacking in flavor as written. I tried quadrupling the amount of crushed red pepper (as my husband likes spicy dishes) but still could hardly taste it. We had to add quite a bit of parmesan cheese at the table (as suggested) to make it taste right. I would personally suggest adding parmesan cheese to the ricotta before mixing and then allow eaters to add more themselves at the table for additional flavor.

I liked this dish a lot. Not too complicated, a good light spring pasta dish. I used low-fat ricotta in mine, didn't seem to take anything away from it. I think some grilled chicken would be a great addition if you like.
