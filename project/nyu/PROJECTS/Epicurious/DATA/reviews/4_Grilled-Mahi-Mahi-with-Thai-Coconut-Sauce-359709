Yum! I added red curry paste, extra garlic, 1/2 tsp sugar, and chlii garlic sauce, and plated over spinach artichoke mashed Yukon potatoes. With the additional spice, it made it fantastic. I intended to use the clam sauce, but it'd been in the fridge too long, so had to forego it. Husband devoured his plate.

Really good. I did cut back on the clam juice, added shrimp, extra garlic, red curry paste 3 T. Served with jasmine rice. Got rave reviews from our guests.

Used a jalapeño (1 tsp), the whole can of coconut milk (about 13 oz). It boiled down in about 9 minutes on my Dacor range. Kids and husband enjoyed it...I would have enjoyed more spice.

The clam juice totally ruined this for me.. and I only used half. Seems worth trying again omitting that ingredient, since there's no reason for the other ingredients not to work together.

This wow'd my company, and I had requests for the recipe. Great light summer meal. Made as directed with the exception of using yellow fin tuna (store did not have mahi-mahi). The only thing I will do different next time is make additional sauce.

Rating: 4
Wow, this is definitely a keeper. Simple to prepare but outstanding flavor. No changes to recipe except used sea bass. Reducing sauce does take longer than 9 minutes, more like 20 minutes. This is definitely a recipe that will wow company but easy enough for family week day meal. Served with basmati rice and roasted green beans & accompanied with a bottle of pinot noir.

Easy to make and delicious. I made the recipe as written except I added prepared lemon grass - in the refrigerated part of your produce section.

This was so easy and so good. The sauce was exceptional with the addition of a pinch of sugar. I did sub sriracha for the serrano since I had none on hand and really love the beautiful color it provided. Served with broccolini and jasmine rice and will definitely make it again.

This dish was incredible, although I made a few modifications. It worked beautifully with thickly sliced sea bass over a puck of steamed rice, drizzled with the sauce. Also, my husband is allergic to clams, so I omitted the clam juice and substituted more of the unsweetened coconut juice...I agree, you should double the sauce. Finally, I added 3 tablespoons of curry powder to the recipe, which tempered the lime flavor. A HUGE success!

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe, especially with the coconut milk. My only suggestion is to use half the recommended lime juice, as I felt that it dominated the sauce. I also added lemongrass and sprinkled in some curry powder to taste. Overall, I felt that this sauce is a great starting point from which you can add or subtract ingredients as you prefer.

This was fan.tab.u.lous! Roomie brought back mahi mahi from a fishing trip to Mexico! I doubled it, and based off the rec of another cook, didn't use double the clam juice, but just added an extra 8 oz of water. Also a dollop of sugar upon tasting part way through -- not sure if that was necessary. Anyway, people sopped up the sauce! Not an experienced mahi griller, but this KILLED. I got hugs, it was that good.

I made this sauce as written and it didn't taste quite right. I added about a teaspoon or so of sugar and it made a huge difference. In addition, cooking the fish 5-7 minutes per side is much too long. Perhaps our grill was hotter, but 3 minutes skin side down, and 2 minutes on flesh side was perfect-very moist and flavorful. Served it with jasmine rice with sauteed finely chopped red pepper and a bit of the sauce - very nice!

Just made this for dinner and it was fabulous! I took previous suggestions and served over mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus spears. I would agree that the Coconut Thai sauce should be doubled. I will make this again now that I have found fish sauce and unsweetened coconut milk. This was a nice addition to my attempt to eat a Paleo diet.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I prepared exactly as written and would do so again. I used one Serrano chile with seeds and white part removed and it provided a mild heat. Great blend of sweet/sour/spicy. I served this with jasmine rice cooked in the remaining coconut milk and chicken broth with slivered almonds, onion, and coconut flake added. I stirred in fresh chopped parsley at the end. This was a great meal and one that will definitely be added to our regular rotation.

excellent! sauce took alot longer to reduce so next time would make ahead and reheat before serving. Served over mashed sweet potatoes w/roasted asparagus (thanks to review who suggested that), and everyone Loved it. didn't have chilies so omitted and couldn't tell it was missing anything.

Have made twice. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Will make again, and again. The clam juice and the fish sauce were hard to find in the store (they had it, just not easy to find on the shelf), but were worth it. Used jalapeño the second time around because we had it in the house and we thought it needed more heat but the flavor was still good. Tonight we had the fish with jasmine rice and fresh grown green beans from our garden with a sesame oil and soy sauce glaze. Total heaven.

I make this often and can't imagine doing without the clam juice and fish sauce! But, the brand of clam juice makes a HUGE difference. Some are just nasty. I use Bar Harbor brand. Instead of the chile, I usually add Sirachi sauce (sp?). It gives the sauce a pretty color and tastes great. I'm out of cilantro. So, tonight I'm trying a bit of Thai basil. Should work, I think. We are blessed to live near the Gulf and get really fresh Mahi Mahi. I've made this with previously frozen fish and it's just not the same.

This is in my "regular rotation" for a week night meal. I cannot imagine this without the clam juice or fish sauce! I do substitute the serrano chilis with mild pepper rings (in the jar), small chop. Tried it with jalapenos, which I loved, but my husband found too spicy. We serve this over basmati brown rice, but have also served over jasmine rice with great results. The sauce definitely takes much longer than indicated in the recipe. I usually juice all of one lime for the sauce. Also, typically use tilapia that is very lightly dusted w/ flour and sauteed over high heat in olive oil. Like to serve w/ sugar snap peas. The kid literally scrapped up the remaining sauce from the pan!

Just finished eating this and it was UH-MAY-ZING! I doubled the sauce and made it exactly as written WITH the clam sauce but instead of 2 bottles, I used one + one cup water instead. I also DID use the fish sauce. Came out on the thin side, more like a broth. Served it with coconut basmati rice and a glass of Pinot Grigio. I thought it was great and will make it again and again and again! It reminded me of my favorite Thai soup Tom Kha Ga.

I loved this recipe! Yes, I changed some things. I did not add the clam juice. I added more fish sauce and lime juice. I also used hotter peppers. I would probably not do that next time since for most people they couldn't handle this kind of heat. I made it with jasmine lime mint rice (add in the lime while steaming; add fresh mint before serving) and I also served it with a mango salsa (see recipe on here for guava salsa and substitute mango. I would leave out the red onion since it would be too over powering with the other flavors. This gave it a very fresh and cooling effect to balance the heat of my sauce. I served it with asparagus and with a bottle of Anakena's Chardonnay from Chile 2010. Excellent compliment! I would definitely make this again but just cut down on the heat of the peppers I used.

The cook who recommended serving this over mashed sweet potatoes is a genius!

Rating: 3
YUM!! As other reviewers said, the sauce as written was very acidic. I used 1 whole can of coconut milk, added 1 tsp sugar to counter acidity and 1 tsp green Thai curry to deepen flavor. Used smaller amount of serrano chiles since the Thai curry is spicy. Made just enough sauce for 4 servings with no extra; next time, I would double sauce, because everyone wanted more. Served with mahi mahi and stir-fried shrimp. BTW, this might taste fine made without fish sauce, but it won't be Thai!

Made this recipe exactly as described but as recommended ditched the fish sauce and clam juice. It was AWESOME and so simple to make. We made it with quinoa with tomato, cucumber, chives and lots on lemon - the bites with fish and quinoa were perfect.

I thought this recipe was great! I made it for the wife and kiddos, (none are to fond of fish) all gave rave reviews. I omitted the fish sauce, added a bit too much lime juice (didn't ruin the dish) and think I might add curry to the dish next time around.

a lovely sauce! I added more ginger, garlic, the whole can of coconut milk like others and a little chili-garlic sauce; it took much longer than 8-9 minutes to reduce, which was no big deal.

The richness this sauce adds to the mahi mahi was out of this world. Left out the clam juice and fish sauce, and it had bright, savory flavor. I liked it so much I made it again a week later. I added some chopped asparagus I had lying around in the fridge the first time I made it, and thought the flavors went together very well.

I have made this dish twice now and it is delicious, everyone loves it. You can interchange any kind of fish. I always use the full can of coconut milk and never find it to be too clammy. I serve the fish and sauce over mashed sweet potatoes and top with asparagus tips. To die for!

A great, versatile recipe. We used chicken, but I can see how fish and shrimp would also be good. I was a little nervous about all that clam juice, but the dish didn't taste "clammy" at all.

absolutely wonderful! i made this for my husband and a friend last night, and we all really enjoyed the flavors. i followed the recipe for the most part making a few changes...broiled the fish instead of grilling, sauteed green peppers (sliced thinly) and added them to the sauce along with chunks of fish instead of serving single filets. delicious! took another reviewers advice for the honeydew melon with coconut milk as a desert companion, and it was perfect.

Made this with the chicken and it was really delicious. Cooked it in a deep wide skillet and it definately took more than the 9 minutes to reduce- but so easy and delicious. added a 1/2 tsp of the curry paste as suggested, and the sauce came out really good. Loved it with the jasmine rice.

So good! My husband actually requested it again the following night! I didn't make it the following night but I have made it more than once, so easy and so good.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I loved the way it smelled and it tasted delicious. That being said, i felt like it could use something else. I am not a thai cooking expert so I don't know what that would be but everyone i made it for loved it and one of the people doesn't even like cilantro.

The sauce was tasty but took forever to reduce. The colour was unappealing, thus you need the cilantro and green onion or it's pretty grey/white looking.

easy recipe! The sauce is delicious. I made it with sea bass since the store didn't have any mahi mahi and it was great. I agree that you probably have to reduce more than 9 minutes.

This was so delicious! I used light coconut milk and, though it looked curdled and hugely unappealing for most of the time it took to reduce, it came together in a beautiful, healthy-ish sauce. It took me about 20 min to reduce, and I'd suggest going easy on the salt as fish sauce is already very salty. This would also be great on chicken.

Rating: 4
I've never cooked with coconut milk before, didn't think the family would like it -but this was a great sauce for the rice, the corn, the fish, everything on the plate. Kept it mild until the kids had been served, then stirred in some thai curry paste to add some heat.

Made this last night, was fabulous! Loved the flavor combinations, and was very easy & fast as well, only regret was not making a double batch of the sauce, guests gobbled it up, was great over basamati rice as well as the Mahi! Adding this one to my favorites :-)

We had chicken on hand so we used it instead of fish, and the recipe still worked great. We added curry paste to the sauce, and if I'd had lemongrass I would have used it, too. We didn't use the chilies, not because I didn't want to, but this was a family meal and I have a three-year-old. Adults and kids alike devoured it.

This was very tasteful. I grilled the Mahi Mahi fillets but next time would wrap them in foil on the grill for even more flavor. I bought fillets that were are already skinned and cut and previously frozen.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this. I just quickly cooked barramundi filets in a saute pan with a little olive oil. I agree that the sauce takes longer than 8-9 to minutes to reduce. I served it over wild rice. Maybe I would cut the lime juice to 1 1/2T next time. I'll definitely make this again

Rating: 4
Very tasty and easy to prepare. TIP: don't light the grill til you prepare the sauce. It takes longer than the 8-9 minutes indicated to reduce to 3/4 cup. I removed the skin from the fish, which I would recommend, but be sure to oil the grill so it doesn't stick. For visual appeal, add something red for garnish.
