This was my first time trying to make curd and I wasn't successfull. It came out soupy. I just cooked it for 12 minutes since I didn't have the correct candy thermometer. Afterwards, I read other curd recipes and found that I should have cooked longer - until its thick enough to hold the wisk marks - this recipe didn't say that. I was also using a new measuring spoon and I used teaspoons of zest instead of tablespoons - so I had an eggy aftertaste.

After looking at proportions in several lemon and/or lime curds, I made this recipe with some quantity changes. It turned out delicious and tangy. The changes - 6 whole eggs, 3/4 cup of butter, about the same amount of each fruit's zest and I strained the curd. The amount of juice and sugar I left the same and followed the cooking instructions. This is a great use of my lemons and limes - and my trees can be generous. Thank-yous go to the previous reviewers because their comments gave me the confidence to make the alterations.

This was easy and delicious. I only had seven eggs so I used four whole and three yolks without a problem. I used a zester and strained the curd before putting it in jars. It still tasted wonderful and there were no flecks! Fabulous and full of flavor. Makes me want to have tea!!

I halved this recipe to be used as filling for rugelach. It was easy to make and came out very good, but ever so slightly eggy tasting. Next time I would seriously consider eliminating some or all of the whole eggs; the quantity of egg yolks seems sufficient to me. The lime taste was wonderful, but the green flecks of the lime zest just didn't look right. For the sake of presentation, I would use only lemon zest next time.

This is lovely. I used concentrated lime juice. Worked great. I put the curd in a baked meringue basket. Couldnt stop eating it!!!!!!
