my first attempt at homemade baked beans, easy and delicious

Too sweet. Also, should have pre-cooked the onions and bacon. Was not a crowd pleaser.

Very good flavor, although it's almost a dessert bean - quite sweet. I wish I'd followed my natural instincts and pre-cooked the onion, garlic, and bacon. I'll try it again, with that change in procedure.

I've made this one a couple of times and it's a hit with the kids. Instead of adding water throughout the afternoon as it cooks I keep a beer beside the stove and top up the pot with beer as it cooks. This gives the final result a fuller flavour.

Added 2 extra cloves of minced garlic and 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and did the final slow cooking in a crock pot. This is a dish that goes fast! Doubled it the second time...much better the next day, but still not enough!

This is the closest recipe that I have found to the world famous BEANCROCK

This was a great alternative to tomato based bean recipes. I did add more maple syrup as the beans cooked and it seemed to give the final product more flavor. This recipe was given along with a maple based chicken recipe on the Epicurious TV show, but that is too much maple anything for one person to digest.

I would make this recipe again because I love my baked beans. My mother makes this every Christmas. Every recipe I have rated I have been given these recipes to my mother.
