This dish was dry, flavorless and truly disgusting. Save yourself the time and energy and open a can of anything...it would be better than this.

Be careful not to overcook veggies when blanching. Probably better to cook separately -- cauliflower takes longer. A lot of work for a "simple" side dish but tasty.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was great, my family called it a definite " keeper "

This was a good recipe; I steamed the vegetables and used twice as much horseradish as was called for. If I were to make it again, I'd probably try adding some additional spices. It was a bit bland.

I would make this recipe again if I added more salt to the cooking process. I made the broccoli and cauliflower the day before. The cooked the vegetables separately, cooking the clauliflower first, a little longer than called for in the recipe. I also cooked the broccoli a little longer than called for in the recipe. The final result was the dish lacked a little flavor and the vegetables were al dente -- I was too afraid to overcook them and then they would be mush.

i just love this receipe - i don't know why some others had problems with it - you do have to make sure that the broccoli is not cooked too long cause it will get soft - the classic cauliflower and broccoli mix are a big hit - i much prefer the horseradish breadcrumbs to butter for the holidays - also, i love the presentation - everytime i serve it and there are non cooks at the dinner they always love the "mold" - this is a recurring staple during every holiday season -

Not impressed with this recipe at all. I've made buttered bread crumbs and tossed them over vegies many times without all of the hulabaloo this recipe called for. None of us could even taste the horseradish in this dish.

I was really disappointed in this recipe - it certainly did not turn out "Creamy" like one cook described it. I will not make this again.

Very good recipe and easy. I would steam the vegetables rather than boil them and add more horseradish for a fuller taste.

This dish was part of our 1999 Xmas dinner and it was a hit. Be careful not too boil the broccoli too long ( as I did) as it disintegrated and was very mushy. The horseradish tang adds a great taste to these vegies.

the dish was very easy to make and stayed creamy overnight. The breadcrumbs were tasty and added to the dish. next time I'll also try it with broccoli for colour,
