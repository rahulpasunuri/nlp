This was a good burger. Not a great burger, but a good one that I would make again.

Absolutely delicious. Only tips I would offer- try to seal the edges as best you can, otherwise a lot of the cheese runs out the side. Also, we had to add an extra few minutes on the grill, after 3 min. on each side they were still almost raw. However, once they were finished, OMG they were good!

We love Black and Blue burgers! For extra kick I like to use a little blackening seasoning on the patties and then a nice drizzle of Chipotle Tabasco after topping with the cheese. Mmm... For me, that takes it to the 4 level. I also top the burger after flipping instead of stuffing the meat.

just made this today but used goat cheese instead (don't like blue), topped with carmelized onions, and used very soft wheat bread so the juices could soak in...my husband is worshipping the ground i walk on right now...'nuff said

Really good. I love the surprise gorg oozing out. I now add grilled onions on top and forget the bread altogether. Mmmm.

Reading the reviews of others, I didn't think it was a good idea to grill the burgers with the cheese inside and risking an explosion of hot cheese when I took the first bite. I took the advice of others and reserved the cheese for after grilling. I seasoned the meat, grilled and then topped each patty with bleu cheese. They were good! My boyfriend really liked them.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. We made it for a BBQ, and now can't stop making it for ourselves. Blue cheese is the best, but sharp cheddar is yummy too.

Added some seasonings to the meat: rosemary, garlic, worchester sauce and kosher salt to ensure that the burgers had more than just the cheese flavoring them. Grilled the onions slices and added strips of bacon.

I have played with this recipe a lot. Make your patties thin! Place the round in between two stacked cake/pie pans and Squeeze. When the patties are thin and you add even more cheese, it does not melt into the meat. Even double the cheese. I also have added chipotle sauce to the beef and sprinked chipotle on top. That was best!

This has become a summer favourite that we call "Exploding Bleu Cheese Burgers". You've got to be careful, but they're great, especially with a nice potato salad and a bottle of red wine. Yum.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added other flavorings to the meat. I actually didn't mix the cheese in but made the patties very thin so the cooking time really is only 3 min per side! My family didn't like the bread instead of burger buns and the kids didn't finish the burgers cause of the blue cheese. No surprises there as kids don't seem to like blue cheese whereas I love it. I liked the recipe and would make it again but only for adults.

Best burger I've had in a long time! Like another reviewer, I mixed the Gorgonzola in with the meat rather than putting a solid chunk in the center of each patty. I guesstimated the amount of cheese, and I think I used more than the specified 2 oz. - but that definitely didn't hurt the flavor. I was a little concerned that the meat would be bland, so I added a little Worcestershire, onion powder and garlic powder. Perfecto.

I was worried about the cheese leak, so I used a little less cheese and sealed the burgers TIGHT. Well, we burned ourselves when the cheese exploded out as we bit into them. Be careful! It went all over the place. I cooked the burgers medium well (10 min per side in 450deg broiler), and used blackened seasoning before cooking. Except for the accident, they were very good.

We got marscapone gorgonzola, which has a creamy rather than crumbly texture, and mixed it more thoroughly with the meat rather than just embedding it in the middle. Worked like a charm.

Very tasty and simple. I didn't have any trouble with "cheese leakage", but the other reviewer was right to suggest thin patties. My burger was almost too big to eat...but worth it!

My family has been making burgers this way for many years now and there is nothing wrong with the assembly in the recipe. We have often made ours with cheddar, onions and BBQ sauce; pepper-jack cheese and mushrooms and many other combinations. Just make sure the beef patties are very thin unless you like a meaty burger and be very gentle sealing and cooking the burgers. If they are done right they are wonderful.

The assembly before cooking will almost guarantee something goes wrong. I changed the recipe so that the cheese disk is place on top of the almost cooked burger to melt naturally. This also allows you to season the meat for your own taste. And finally by doing the burgers my way, the cheese won't leak out and be wasted. Exchange the kaiser rolls for pizza dough rolls (make a pizza crust the size of a normal burger bun after baking, split and drizzle with olive oil).
