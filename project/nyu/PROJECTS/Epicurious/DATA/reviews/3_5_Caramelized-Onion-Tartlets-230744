This was really delicious. Like the cooks before, I made the everything the day before and assembled it just before my guests arrived. I used sour cream and think it made it too cold. I may try the creme fraiche another time, but I think chevre will be my next choice. Definitely should be room temp, or even warmer. On low on a warming tray would be perfect. In a pinch,puff pastry could easily be substituted and just as good. Perhaps not as elegant.

I shouldn't have used store bought pie dough- it's awful,leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. I think I will try puff pastry for the next batch. The onions are fabulous but I had the heat up to medium-high before they actually started to caramelize. I think the creme fraiche needs a little something- maybe a teeny bit of lemon juice? Will try that with the next batch too.

A hit every time! I will be making it again this weekend for a fourth time. Doubles/Triples nicely and works well for large groups.

Made these for NYE for BF. He loved them! Used puff pastry as I didn't have time to make from recipe but will next time. Also used Cheese and Chive cream cheese topped with carmelized onion. So tasty!

I used frozen pie crust dough, cut rounds and baked in mini tins 2 days in advance. I also carmelized the onions in advance. To serve, I warmed the onions in the microwave, loaded the tarts with the onion and topped with a dollop of sour cream and chopped chive. Very pretty, simple and delicious!

sorry, vancouver, I didn't use creme fraiche either! bastardized the recipe completely by using store-bought phyllo cups -- put a dollop of boursin in the bottom, onions on top, then reheated in a 350 oven for five minutes. guests devoured them so fast the plate barely made it to the table. I'm sure creme fraiche is wonderful as well and maybe I'll try that next time, but if you're looking for a great foolproof way to caramelize onions this is the place.

My family loved these and I will make them again because they are so easy. To A Cook from Vancouver, no need to get snotty with all of the people who added helpful comments. Yes, I did make it with Creme Fraiche and it was delicious. The last time I made them however, I was unable to get the Creme Fraiche so I used Greek style Plain Yogurt - worked great. My picky, non-health food eating husband, did not notice the difference and still gobbled them up.

Ok. Did anyone actually follow the recipe and use creme fraiche? The point of these reviews is to find out how the recipe worked not to show off one's culinary artistry.

These were great! I used gouda instead of creme fraiche. These were a big hit.

These were a really simple and delicious appetizer. I used whipped Philadelphia Cream Cheese instead of the Creme Fraiche and it worked great. I baked the tarts the night before, cooled and stored in a ziplock bag. Carmelized the onions the night before and just heated for 30 seconds in the micro before topping the tarts. I'm glad I did because it took much longer than 25 minutes to carmelize two large vidalia onions. Simple to assemble once guests arrived.

These were wonderfully easy to make. I made the shells one day ahead and baked, keeping a close eye on them. I think 9- 10 minutes was sufficient. Stored in the mini tin in the freezer overnight. I also made the onions the day before. Right before the guests arrived, I added the onions, sprinkled with a little goat cheese and baked until warmed through. They disappeared almost immediately. The shells are simple, and very versatile!

I didn't even bother with the tartlets. I used the onions as a topping for a killer steak: right atop a small blob of Boursin! The caramelized onions are super-versitile and easy!

As is rates three forks, but with a few changes becomes a four. Used phyllo tartlet shells and herbed goat cheese. Followed the rest of the directions as is. Turned out great.

I used pre-made philo dough cups which had a nice texture and light flavor that went well with the other ingredients. For the filling I used fat free greek yogurt (which was surprisingly tangy in comparison to the full fat yogurt) mixed with chopped green onions. Overall they were delicious and really easy to make.

Excellent! I would make more than the 12 in this recipe and consider serving it as a side dish. They are very, very good!

Embarrassingly easy to make. I made half topped with grated Gruyere and half topped with chives blended into sour cream with a dash of orange Hawaiian sea salt.

Believe it or not, leaving off the creme fraiche and just doing the onions and pastry is amazing! A tiny bit of swiss cheese melted on top maybe, but the onions can stand on their own.

This recipe turned out great for me. It was a big hit at a party and it was really nice that I could make the onions the night before and just put everything together the next day. Since I don't have a tin for tartlets, I used phyllo pastry cups and it worked well.

I sprinkled parm on my tartlet crust as other reviewers thought the crust bland. Then used veggie cream cheese as I ran out of cream fraiche. Great combo, but the cream cheese was a bit to strong - hard to taste those awesome onions. Great treat!

I have a silly question: Are these served warm? If you make the onions and shells ahead, do you warm them and add the cold creme fraiche? They sound good...

simple and very tasty. i substituted gruyere and they were like mini-bites of french onion soup (without the soup!)

I really didn't like the pie crust as a base for this. Yes, caramelized onions are wonderful but I hated how rich the pastry crust made this...

Mmm, can't go wrong with caramelized onions. I made some of them with feta instead of creme fraiche.

Easy to make ahead. I made the tartlets and onions a few weeks before and froze them. Then let me defrost and put them together. They were a hit.

Fabulous recipe. Made tartlets from scratch. Topped half with the caramelized onions and half with osetra. They were both a big hit. No changes necessary!

I have used the caramelized onion part of the recipe several times since I made the tartlets to put on other items. As for this appetizer, this is very good. You should definitely buy the chive flavored goat cheese so you don't have to combine the two. Very good. Will definitely make again.

very easy and very good. everyone loved them and i was able to make it in advance of my party and assemble them at the last minute -- essential for a party!

I think this is a good, basic recipe that could use enhancement. I would add some garlic to the caramelized onions and a fresh herb--probably rosemary--and leave the chives out. It just needed "something."

I took the tartlets to a cocktail party I was attending, I was the toast of the party!!!!! Ab Fab.

Really nice easy recipe. They went over very well. I would definitely make this again

This recipe has great potential and the onions were devine, but I had trouble with the pie crust, it was still undone at the bottom when the sides started to brown. I will try this again with my own pie crust. Also used more creme fraiche.

Made this using those mini phyllo cups instead of rolling out the pie dough (talk about lazy, huh?). Since creme fraiche is practically impossible to find around here, I substituted sour cream w/ a splash of 1/2 & 1/2 (both Fat Free, BTW). Also used some Penzey's Sunny Paris seasoning instead of chives. Yum - absolutely delicious! The phyllo cups gave them a nice crunch, too.
