I substituted fresh corn, cooked and cut from the cob, scallion for the red onion, and added grape tomatoes cut in half. The tomatoes are the missing ingredient in this recipe I think. Really brightened it up. Will probably make it again.

I made this recipe for an office picnic today. Because of the ingredients (mustard, vinegar, pepper sauce), I expected a spicey dish. However, I felt it was very bland. After making the dish, I let it sit overnight in the frig. This morning, it still tasted like it lacked something, so I mixed up another bowl of the vinaigrette and added it to the dish. I am not sure what else to do to this recipe, but it needs something. I did take it to the picnic. However, no one asked for the recipe which is a true test of how good a dish is!

In my opinion I would use less oil than the recipe calls for. Honestly i liked it better without the vinagrette, but overall it has a nice southern style cooking flavor. A little Frank's red hot on top did it for me. I paired it up with some blackened red snapper and rice with kale.

This recipe was more of a bean salad than a succotash. It would go nicely with hamburgers, fish or something casual, but not as a side for a more formal dinner. I thought it was ok, not great.

A nice combination of flavors & textures -- a good unique take on succotash. My mother loved it! It keeps well & goes with other main dishes, too.

hmmmm. kept trying to rate this recipe last night and none of them would post. I guess the site was just behind. Sorry for the multiples!

My husband absolutely loves this. I'd make it again for him.

My usband swears this is excellent. I won't try it due to my deep abhorrence of bell peppers, but my husband, his mom, and his sister all love it.

I made this as written. I hate bell peppers, so I didn't eat any, but my husband swears it's the best salad he's ever eaten.
