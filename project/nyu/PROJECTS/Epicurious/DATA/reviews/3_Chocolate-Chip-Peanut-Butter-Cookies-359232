Chalky is right! I found these almost inedible. And chocolate and peanut butter are two of my favorite things...what a disappointment.

I made this times two, added an extra egg and they came out perfect!! One of the best recipes I've made.

Though easy to make, there wasn't enough peanut butter flavor for my taste. They tasted rather bland; but on the plus side, I had a great time making them with my grandaughter, Kaylee.

Was looking for a quick easy recipe with what was already in my kitchen (minus the butterfinger). Love the peanut butter flavor of these cookies, but they came out a little chalky instead of chewy like I was looking for.

I made this recipe on a whim, and even though I don't love the famed peanut butter/chocolate combo, they were DELICIOUS. They were super easy to make, and everyone loved them. The butterfinger adds a wonderful textural element. Here's my attempt: http://bringinghomethebakin.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/on-a-whim/
