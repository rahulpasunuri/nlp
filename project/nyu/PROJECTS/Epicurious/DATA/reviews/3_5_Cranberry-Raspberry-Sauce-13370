I liked this recipe but I modified it in view of what I had in the house. I used a 1-lb bag of whole frozen unsweetened raspberries in place of raspberries in light syrup. I also used a little more than half a bag of cranberries (the rest of the bag wasn't usable), and I substituted half a cup of apple juice for the cranberry juice. I added about 2/3 cup of brown sugar. I also threw in part of a lemon (unsqueezed) after I took it off the flame and let the mixture cool down with the lemon in it. Everyone in my family liked the change from the usual canned cranberry sauce.

Like another reviewer, I thought it was a little tart and might add more sugar. I'd also like to put it through a sieve to get the raspberry seeds out. I thought it was an improvement over the traditional cranberry sauce, which I could take or leave. However, the traditionalists in the family were horrified that I ruined the cranberries.

My favorite cranberry sauce. This year for a little added color and texture I added 4 1/2 oz of kumquats, trimmed and quartered lengthwise (idea from the the kumquat and cranberry compote on this site that I thought of trying, but this one is just too good for the once a year cranberry sauce dish)

Wonderful complement to ANY turkey dish! I made this for a combination of 12 teenagers, and adults at Xmas, and they devoured it! FYI--I added cornstarch to make it thicker.

I wasn't that awed by this one. And, I like cranberry sauce. I usually use one bag of cranberries, a cup of OJ and a cup of white sugar. Simple. I guess maybe my raspberries in light syrup were not very sweet b/c my sauce was quite tart. Tarter than normal. I had to add sweetener to make it palatable. However, after that, I think it's decent. I've enjoyed eating the leftovers over the leftover cheesecake. My husband did not care for it, he likes my usual. However, my mom did like it. I'd probably try it again by adding one thing of raspberries to my normal recipe.

This is very sweet. Everyone loved it. Easy to make. Tastes better after a day or two, so make it ahead of time.

I made this for Thanksgiving because I couldn't fine the Oceanspray version that I usually buy. My family loved it. It was so easy to prepare and is much sweeter than ordinary cranberry sauce. Very good.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year, and everyone (except myself) liked it. Everyone raved about the flavor but I found it very strange myself. I'll make it next year per everyone's request, but I won't be eating it with them.

I had one guest say it was the best cranberry sauce he ever had. It was a nice sweet/sour combination. I also cut back on the liquid. I'll make this again

I cannot stand cranberry sauce, so I thought I'd try this recipe and it was AMAZING!!! I cut the amount of cranberry juice by half, and added Tawny Port to make up the difference. YUM!!! I will definately be making this every Thanksgiving! Really easy too.

This recipe is great because it can be used so many different ways. We had it at Thanksgiving as cranberry sauce, dished it over ice cream (it is addicting that way) and also served it generously over angel food cake. I have gotten raves everytime I have served it.

Incredible!! The best cranberry recipe I've had. However, I couldn't find rasperries at the store so I substituted blackberries. What an incredible recipe. Even those who didn't like cranberry sauce thought this was great!

This is a great recipe. The raspberries offset the cranberries beautifully, and the consistency after cooling was just right. Even my diehard meat-and-potato guys loved it!

I made this for a potluck, because it was needed. I've never made cranberry sauce basically because I don't like it, but even I loved this recipe. Everyone asked what I'd put in it...they loved it, too!

The raspberries worked great to tame the tartness of the cranberries. I will make this again for Christmas.

Delicious! I did find that after cooking, there was alot of liquid so I mixed gelatin with the liquid and then stirred into the berries. It was wonderful and got great reviews.
