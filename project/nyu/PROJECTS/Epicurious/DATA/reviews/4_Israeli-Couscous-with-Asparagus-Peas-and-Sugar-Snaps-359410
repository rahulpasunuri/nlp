Do yourself a favor and add slivered almonds--just toss a couple of handfuls in at the end. Takes this recipe from good to AMAZING. HUGE family favorite! (Even my 2 year old loves this meal, and she is not a big veggie eater!)

I made this recipe with some changes: - I didn't use fresh lemon juice as I cbf to buy a whole lemon when I knew I had Realemon at home! - I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2 - I didn't use any lemon peel - I used rainbow Israeli couscous - I didn't use chives, I used green onion instead - I didn't want to buy parmesan cheese and I love spicy things so I added 1 raw Serrano chili instead! - I followed the prep instructions as written

Super delicious and healthy. I made it exactly as written with one exception. I used 2 tablespoons of Blood Orange infused Olive Oil for the dressing for a bit more citrus flavor. Definitely a "keeper" recipe!

I made this almost exactly as written, and it is excellent. I added a little more lemon juice and reduced the oil in the dressing just a bit. I don't know that the cheese is necessary, but toasting the couscous and adding chives definitely is! I will make this again, and maybe try it with quinoa next time.

I have made this recipe 5 or 6 times, always with the intention of this time adding the cheese, but when I taste it, I a Just can't bring myself to add cheese to this very fresh and light spring dish. Always a hit!

This was amazing. And I even forgot to add the cheese. I will make this all summer long!!! Perfect for picnics, too! Oh, and I used quinoa instead of couscous and added some spring onions. Delicious.

The dressing is so simple and so delicious! I roasted my asparagus first to get more flavor and did not add cheese because my husband is lactose intolerant. The leftovers right out of the fridge were just as good.

i was looking for an interesting way to use up some sugar snap peas and this was perfect. couldn't find the couscous so used orzo as recommended by others and cooked it exactly the same way. i added a bit more garlic to both the dressing and in cooking the veggies and some generous salt and pepper. omitted the cheese as i don't know why you would add it. served it room temp as a side with grilled salmon and it was a big hit. i thought it would be lousy cold but just took a bite which turned into about 6 bites and its good right out of the fridge. perfect make ahead healty dish which makes it great for entertaining!

This side dish was fabulous! I blanched the veggies instead of cooking them in oil, and grated just a small amount of fresh parmesan on top of the dish once everything was combined. A little healthier and still wonderful. I'll be making this one a lot.

This is a definate keeper - an awesome addition to any summer meal! Everyone loved it, including the kids. I made it in advance and put it in the 'fridge and then warmed it in the microwave. It is best served warm in my opinion.I had to search for the israeli couscous but well worth it.

What a great spring/summer recipe. It goes great with salmon or grilled chicken. Next time I would decrease the oil by a little and add more grated cheese. Definitely a keeper!

Very good. I strayed from the recipe a bit so I won't rate it but added cooked sweet potato and baby bella mushrooms and frozen roast corn. I think you could add anything, probably greens would go better than my combos but it's working for me!

I served this salad with some grilled salmon room temperature for a spring lunch and it was a hit. I added more vegetables than the recipe called for and more chives because I had tons in my spring herb garden. It's refreshing, light and a great complement to the salmon.

I've made this twice, and it's very tasty! I couldn't find Israeli couscous, so I just used orzo. I also took the suggestions of ommitting the parmesan, and I agree that it would have been an unnecessary addition. As leftovers I zap it in the microwave at half power just to take the chill off. It's best when it's warm/room temp.

I saw this recipe in the magazine and thought it looked good, but it wasn't until I saw it in the Buzz Box that I actually made it. I didn't have vegetable broth; so, I used chicken broth. This is a perfect picnic dish - eat it warm, room temperature or cold; which ever way, it is soooo good!

Big hit, even my two year old loved it. I couldn't find the cous cous so used acini de pepe instead. Great flavors, a refreshing simple side dish.

Fabulous and easy. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I omitted the peas and used chicken broth instead of veg. I would NOT service this chilled, however; this dish was perfect warm and at room temperature, but after sticking it in the fridge the couscous got clumpy and the lemon juice oxidized the vegetables and turned them from vibrant green to sort of a grayish color. The parmesan isn't necessary, the dish tastes great without it.

Rating: 2
Overall I thought this was a tasty recipe. Also it was easy and straight forward to make. I made the dish as written. I just omitted the cheese at the end because I love the bright flavor that the lemon added. The one thing I would change next time is the peas. And I am some who LOVES them. I remember someone mentioning edamame in their review and I think youre really onto something. Next time edamame!

Yummy! I would definitely make this again! I used whole wheat pearl couscous.

Israeli couscous is not actually available yet in the States, but there may be some businesses "re-labeling" other product, not sure. I'm wondering if this is anything like the 60 minutes report on all of the $10 a bottle extra virgin olive oils that are coming out of New jersey?

Just finished making this and wanted to say that this is a fantastic recipe! The lemon juice and zest in the dressing make it special. I left out the cheese and it's light and very flavorful. I'll definitely make this again!

Lovely summer recipe, light and delicious.

This was easy, light, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. The lemon peel and parmesan play really well off each other alongside the fresh summer veggies. I substituted quinoa for the couscous, doubled the amount of asparagus, and added a package of chopped extra-firm organic tofu (added the tofu to the sautee pan first so it would have time to pick up more garlic flavor). It's fabulous.

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe. Will make it again and again. I made a couple substitutions that worked well. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth since that's what I had on hand. Ended up with a rich taste. I was more conservative with the salt as a result. I also put in less than the suggested amount of olive oil. I didn't want the couscous to take on an oily texture (as I've had it do in the past), so I was extra cautious with the olive oil. I suggest starting out light and adding if you find it necessary. Definitely try this recipe. It worked well with salmon, and this would be a great pot-luck recipe.

This recipe was really easy and delicious. I ended up not using fresh peas, but just the cut up sugar snap peas and asparagus. The parmesan adds a nice bit of extra flavor to the dish. Also, I ended up forgetting to put the dressing on and it was really delicious that way. I would recommend trying it both ways. Will save the dressing for another salad...

Where has this salad been all my summers past? It's flavorful and nutritious, and makes a great stand-alone pasta salad (that isn't too carb-heavy) or a versatile side for chicken, seafood, and so much more. Israeli couscous as opposed to regular adds a great deal texture-wise, and the directions for sauteing the vegetables were spot-on for retaining their crispness. The market was out of chives so I substituted dill, which complemented the lemon flavor very well. This will be making future appearances at many BBQ's and potlucks to come!

This is delicious and such a nice, fresh way to eat cous cous. Next time, I think I will amp up the flavour a bit.

I made this as written but omitted the parmesan cheese and lemon zest. Was very good. I recommend steaming the vegetables a little bit, the thicker ends of asparagus in particular, to alsost cook them through before sauteeing.

Followed the recipe exactly, and the results were fabulous! (Well, I did add about 1/4 cup extra veg broth, because it was needed.) I cooked the couscous earlier in the day, and right before my guests arrived I sauteed the veggies and added the already cooked couscous. Saved a little time and a pan in the sink! : )

This was also my first time making Israeli couscous. It is so delicious. I think I will seek out recipes for it. I live in a foodie area but I had trouble finding it. Trader Joe's carries it and it is also called Pearl couscous and maftoul-that might have helped me find it in more local stores. I made this recipe exactly as written except for the snow peas. I substituted red bell pepper since I just don't like snow peas. It was wonderful.I was surprised that the couscous didn't plump up as much as I expected. The recipe is definitely more veggies than couscous. Delicious but add more couscous if you want it to be more coucous than veggies.

I made this recipe for my lunches for the week, and it was awesome! Delicious at room temp or cold and very filling. I used low sodium broth, which I didn't think detracted from the flavor at all. Also, I added half a package of firm tofu for some extra protein, which was, imho, a great call.

This was exceptional! My husband is allergic to wheat, so I was going to substitute rye berries for th couscous, but they were out at the store, so we tried kasha for the first time instead. It worked well, though I think I would have liked it better if I could have found kasha that was not hulled. I kept mostly everything else the same, but per other's suggestions and my own preference, I left out the peas and added a yellow bell pepper instead. I did not have chives, so I added two chopped green onions and 1/3 c Italian parsley. So, so, so delicious!

I made a special trip to my neighborhood Middle Eastern grocery store for the Israeli couscous and Im sure glad I did. I had thought about substituting regular couscous not realizing the texture would be so different. It reminded me of tiny croutons on a salad crusty little bits that soak up some of the dressing. In any event this side dish has at all. In addition to the wonderful texture, it has beautiful color, a zesty dressing, and seasonal ingredients. I paired it with Sauteed Chicken Paillards With Artichoke Hearts. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/israeli-couscous-with-asparagus-peas-and-sugar-snaps/

I just finished eating a big bowl of this and wow! I was surprised at how incredibly delicious it was! I'd never had Israeli couscous before and I'm usually not a fan of lemon zest, but I made the recipe exactly as written (I left out the green peas, only because there was enough of the other veggies), and I wouldn't change a thing. Easy and quick to put together. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow! I will definitely make this again. YUM!

Used homemade chicken broth because I had it but found it too salty. I added added extra lemon juice. Because I could not find any fresh peas, I left them out. I thought this was a winner. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will start with less liquid as it was not quite dry enough at the end of the cooking period.

Used low-sodium chix broth rather than veg, since I had it in the pantry. Used frozen peas for the shelled peas. Used zest of one whole lemon, since we love lemon zest. Great recipe - risotto-like, but great veggie taste and crunch. Watch the broth - I needed probably 1/3 cup more than called for to keep pan from drying out.

Oh boy -- this is really a delicious dish! So light and spring-like and lemony. In fact, I think a bit more lemon juice in the dressing would make it even better. Also, after reading some of the reviewers' comments that the vegetable broth wasn't the greatest addition to the cooking of the couscous, I used 1/2 and 1/2 water and chicken broth instead. Really yummy outcome.

Here's a way to cut down on the calories without sacrificing much taste. Just steam the veggies instead of sauteeing them in the extra tbsp of olive oil. Was delish nonetheless. I also added diced fresh red pepper for colour.

Made this today and everyone enjoyed it. Simple and easy to customize. I followed the recipe as written. I cook with middle eastern (Israeli) couscous all the time, and I believe the vegetarian stock in this recipe added an odd flavor and unnecessary salt. Next time I'll use water instead.

I made this last night for a neighborhood cookout (everyone grilled their own main dish and a side to share). This was a huge hit because it was so light and fresh tasting.
