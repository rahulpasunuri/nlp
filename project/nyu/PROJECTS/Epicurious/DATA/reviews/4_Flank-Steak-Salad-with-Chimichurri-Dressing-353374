I have made this several times for guests and it is always a hit. Very easy to make and leaves room for dessert. Only suggestion is to add grape tomatoes for more color.

Very good! I added grilled asparagus and tomatoes to the greens. Also, I cut the sauce with a few tsp of red wine vinegar when I tossed it with the greens. I think this improved the consistency and added a nice kick to the dish. Can't wait to make again!

Loved it. Next time I will double the sauce and use half as a marinade and half for the sauce. Yep, the quality of the flank steak matters.

Loved this! We made on a hot hot night, grilled the flank steak outside. I would use better quality cut of meat next time. Really enjoyed the leftovers with the chimichurri sauce for lunch!

We just made this for dinner tonight - perfect for a hot night. Chimichurri sauce was made primarily with ingrediants from my garden, and the salad was with fresh baby greens from the farmers market. Loved the slight heat in the salad, would serve for company with an alternative for those who don't like heat. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch

This Chimichurri recipe has revolutionized the way I eat vegetables. It is so interesting and delicious and so incredibly easy to make! In terms of the whole recipe, I would substitute a better cut of meat to go on top of the salad. But other than that, this is DELICIOUS!

For being such a simple, quick recipe, this is packed with flavor. We thought it was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to eat it this summer out on our patio with a glass of wine.

This was easy and delicious and much lighter than you would think. I used steak tips-I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted 1/2 white vinegar with 1/2 red wine. I couldn't find the chipotle hot pepper sauce-used chipotle salsa. I added golden raisins and next time will add other veges as well. Great flavor.

One of the most delicious and satisfying meals I've had in a long time, and the chimichurri sauce was just, exactly right. Leftovers are amazing the next day on focaccia with chimichurri mayo. Success of this dish depends on getting the best meat you can. It's worth going to the butcher for a tender piece.

Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! So light and flavorful. Only I used a smoked blue cheese.

I made this for dinner and it was lovely. I scaled down the recipe and used thinly sliced tenderloin instead. I also substituted romaine and added gem tomatos as well. I was looking for a steak salad recipe and came across this and was very pleased to see how easy it was. I've made chimichurri before and this recipe was fairly similar and well balanced with acidity. Will make again.

Ok I am an extremely novice cook so perhaps this recipe is just out of my league, but this meal was a total bust for me. First problem  how much is a bunch of Parsley? After researching on the internet I came up with about a cup and ¼ (although there are many conflicting accounts) and then quickly realized that my food processor was too small for all that parsley. After I managed to shove it all in, the Chimichurri sauce still looked nothing like the picture. Mine was too runny and I could taste the vinegar even though I only used ¼ of a cup. The steak was a bit too tough and didnt work with the salad, and all in all it didnt seem like a complete meal. Very disappointing for both me and my fiancé. I am now investigating other Cimichurri recipes to find out what went wrong. If anybody can help please let me know J

Exceptionally fresh tasting. Its a great recipe to have on hand in the dead of winter when you can't wait for summer any longer.

Who needs flank steak? I used an "underdog" cut of meat. I have a tenderizer tool (best purchase I've made in a long time). Each push shoves 45 evil little knives into the meat. My teenage son enjoyed being a kitchen ninja and thoroughly pulverized the steaks. Then I grilled them as normal, pulled them off, sliced them at an angle and finished their cooking with some of the dressing. I also used romaine. It seemed to stand up to the weight of the meat better.

Easy, great with flank steak, Moz, although nice, is optional. Sauce is designed to work primarily with the steak.

Just made this salad and it was delicious! It all comes together so nicely. I used a baby spinach, baby arugula, and radicchio mix and also added some homemade croutons. We couldn't stop eating it, and I think the mozzarella definitely works in the salad.

Lovely flavor. Couldn't find the mozarella, so served it without and still delicious. I served with an orange and it was a nice complement. The sauce is where its at! Hubby was still hungry when dinner was done, so I'm not certain it was enough, then again we are dieting. We'll definately make it again.

Was an excellent quick recipe. Omitted the moz like many other users stated and it was perfect. Could use some corn as another suggested for some sweetness, but overall was a perfect light dinner

My husband and I have this at least once a week for dinner. We sometimes substitute skirt steak and I use a homemade habanero hot sauce in place of the chipoltle hot sauce. Just enough to give it a little kick. Plus I love that I can have this dinner on the table in about 15 minutes!

Dressing was very flavorful and worked wonderful with the greens and Beef. Not sure what the mozz was doing in the recipe I would omit it next time. I added some freshly cooked corn to the top of the salad to add some sweetness. I would highly recommend it for both presentation purposes and taste. This recipe yielded a large amount (~12tbs) of dressing! I pre-tossed the salad any only used ~4tbs for the entire amount of greens. I then added one more on top after the meat was plated. That as almost too much dressing ... just keep an eye when adding it.

Great recipe!! Went without the cheese, but instead added grilled onions--highly recommend it!! Next time I'll add a poblano chili to the mix

Excellent "dressing" - felt more like sauce for the steak. Didn't really need the moz in the salad.

Really good! We used NY strip steak.

I really enjoyed this. I increased the garlic and may have added and extra drop or two of hot sauce. It was really really good! I might add some veg to the salad next time. maybe cucumber.
