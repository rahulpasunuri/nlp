Wonderful vinaigrette. I used it as salad dressing, have not made the fish however. I subsituted apple/carrot juice for the passion fruit juice because that is what I had in my fridge. I also nixed the peppers and capers to make it more salad friendly and it is amazing!!!

This is an old recipe, I know, but worthwhile and tasty. Just beware, that "calabaza" is more like Acorn Squash in taste than like Butternut, so if you use Butternut you have a much more assertive flavor note than otherwise. And Passion fruit puree is usually really TART, so if you are using the real deal, watch the vinegar (and I cut back on the lime juice). We dip the fish filets in flour, then egg, then flour, and then fry in an olive oil/butter mix, aka "francaise" style. Yummy!

This recipe was a last minute decision so I had to substitute pineapple juice for passion and omitted the capers. My husband and two small children (ages 2 & 4) LOVED it! Next time I'll try to follow the original recipe.

I added mango chunks and it was fabulous and easy.

I wanted to comment on Toronto's take on this recipe. The passion fruit juice DOES make a difference. If you don't change a thing about this dish.. it is really delicious.

This is better with yellow tail snapper, and less citrus would make it a little better. You should try Yelloe tail snapper in passion fruit sauce in Key West Fl at a place called mangos! Wow, it'll make you a believer in passion fruit!

Although this dish was pleasant, it didn't have anything special about it. It is the least exciting fish dish I have made from this web site. Most have been outstanding! I must admit that I did not have the passion fruit juice and used peach juice instead. I don't think that should make that much difference.
