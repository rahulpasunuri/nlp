HELP! What did I do wrong? This did not "stick together" at all. Just loose on the cookie sheet. It is out of the oven and cooling now. Hope it tastes good, but sure doesn't look the way I would have expected. Never made granola before.

Delicious! Based on reviews used only 1/2 tsp. allspice. Used slivered almonds had on hand. Used 1/2 dates and 1/2 raisins...yummy stuff!

I've made this a few times now, with one major modification: I use unsweetened large coconut flakes rather than the sweetened. I've used different combinations of dried fruit, it's a very adaptable recipe.

This is so good. It may be the best granola I've had in my life. The only changes I made were to use olive oil, unsweetened coconut, plus a pinch of salt.

LOVE this granola. Adjust quantities of nuts and fruit as you like. I've never had it come out anything but great. Even family members who don't generally go for this kind of thing love it. The main problem is that I want to just snack on it all the time! Great recipe.

Excellent granola. Didn't follow the recipe exactly . . . but it was super simple and delicious.

This is THE best granola I've ever had! I'm an avid athlete so this recipe is especially great because it provides the protein, sugars, and carbs that I need while tasting delicious at the same time! It's a wonderful alternative to pre-packaged snack bars (I mean, they taste good, but they get a little boring after a while). I've made this granola several times now and the only change I've made is to cut the dates up a little smaller than the recipe suggests. Definitely a keeper!

I make this a little less fancy and expensive by replacing the cashews with pecans and not using the dates. I pack it for camping and fishing trips and it disappears, whether people just eat it plain or add it to yogurt or fruit. It's a GREAT recipe!!

I recently bought dates for the first time. I have only used them in salads - and was craving them in a snack, so I did a "date" search and this came up. I had to use what I had around house - and WOW!!! I used Starbucks granola with fruit and nuts (wehich has several kinds nuts as well as dried fruit)and omitted the coconut. I served with lemon yogurt, as it is breakfast time. I can not wait to try as written! Great snack!

This is my all time favorite granola! I use the base and then throw in whatever I have on hand: walnuts, dried cherrys, cranberries, and golden raisins. SO MARVELOUS. I can never make enough and have gotten some addicted who claimed to not like granola.

I will never buy store bought granola again! I followed the lead of the other reviewers, doubled the recipe, added half a cup of pepitas and omitted the allspice. I also substituted half of the dates for half tart cherries and half dried blueberries, which I added after it baked. I didn't have enough almonds so I used half a cup of coarsely chopped pecans instead. I also added a little sea salt to the butter and honey while it was melting.

This is an excellent granola recipe. Because of the butter and the baking temp/time, it's browner, crisper, and toastier than the average granola, which can be chewy and not so tasty. I changed around all the add-ins when I made this (didn't use any dates or coconut, used a mix of almonds, walnuts, and pistachios) but I kept the base process the same. Very good.

I love this recipe. I always triple it and the changes I make are 2 tsp each of cinnamon and allspice for the tripled recipe. I also add about 1/3 cup raw pumpkin seeds and add only 2 cups of dates. When it's cooked and cooled, I add some dried cranberries. YUM!

Fabulous! I used sunflower seeds in place of almonds and walnuts in place of cashews. Also skipped the dates and added 3/4 cup of golden flax seed.

This is the BEST granola I have ever made. I love it! I tripled the batch because I had leftover dates from the holidays and I am so glad I did. I didn't have cashews but added more almonds. Anybody know how long this can keep?? I have it in a big jar taunting me on the kitchen counter... I would hate for it to go bad. I guess I'll eat more everyday... :)

I had doubts about 1 cup of dates that were cut into thirds...I thought that was too much date, but it isn't! Great granola...lots of flavor and not too sweet. I used 1/2 tsp of whole allspice and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon bark ground together in a electric spice grinder...I found the spices perfect that way. I think the fresh gound spices distribute more evenly. I had to sub chopped macadamia nuts for cashews...delicious just the same.

Very good recipe, but thought the Allspice was a bit dominant. I used unsweetened coconut as well as added about 1/4 cup each Brown Flax Seed Meal and Wheat Germ. I mistakingly added the dates prior to baking, so the dates are a bit on the hard side. Overall a good chunky recipe.

This is a great granola. I usually play with the added ingredients but the base is good. For those who think the butter is better than oils; try walnut oil sometime. I tend to skip the butter (not for health reasons; just prefer the walnut oil). Flax seed, wheat germ, unsweetened coconut, molassses, etc are all great subs.

If they renamed this recipe "Best Granola Ever" there would be over 200 reviews!! Thanks to the other reviewers I gave this a try. I doubled the recipe to use the whole package of dates and I'm so glad I did. "Hubby" who doesn't like granola or anything to do with it has been wolfing it down ever since. I was worried about doubling the allspice and the large pieces of dates but it all works in the end. I put the granola in a clear glass canister with a scooper in it and it is so beautiful I wish you could see a picture. The flavor gets better every day (how is that even possible)? This is the yummiest granola I've ever tasted.

Delicious granola and the butter really makes it special since most are made with oils. Very tasty and quite versatile, my first batch is almost gone already!

Very good! I leave out the brown sugar and add whatever nuts I have on hand. I also add wheatgerm and flax seed. Makes a wonderful breakfast with yogurt and fruit! I eat it everyday!

So far about 4 people asked me for the recipie. Although I substitute quite a bit. I use almond and walnuts instead of the cashews and raisins instead of the dates. Also I take unsweetened coconut. Ok, by now it's almost a different recipie but thank you for the base anyway.

This granola is great! It goes so well with plain yogurt and fruit. I modified the recipe because of my dislike for dried fruit. Instead of the coconut and dates I added 3/4 c. lightly salted dry roasted peanuts, and two tablespoons ground flax seed. Delicious!

The best. Very adaptable. I also add sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, flax powder/seeds, wheat germ, cranberries, or whatever I have on hand. Big hit with family and friends!

This granola is wonderful as the recipe is written or with many variations. I do, however, add salt, which I highly recommend. For me the dates are a must, but I've used all different types of nuts and sunflower seeds with great results.

I can't stop eating this stuff. Made according to recipe--it's sweet w/o being overpowering, and very nutty. Next time I'lll make a double batch

I made this yesterday. My hubby said he wouldn't eat it because he doesn't like dates or coconut. WELL!! He has probably eaten 3 bowls of it, just munching. It is fabulous. I think I will make it and send it out for Christmas presents, it's that good. I put the dates in at the beginning, but they are a little too chewy, so next time I will put them in as recipe specifies. I also only used 1 Tbsp. of honey instead of 2, and it was plenty sweet. I had flaked almonds so I used those, but no other changes. Try this, you will love it.

I made this for the first time and will make it again and again. I added all of my left over nuts from my Christmas cookies in addition to the almonds and cashews the recipe called for. I also used Mother's brand whole oats and a Doughmakers jelly roll pan and it didn't need the extra 15 minutes at the end, they were brown enough after the first 20 minutes of baking. So make sure you check before you do that last 15 minutes of baking. You may not need it. I also found it just a tad too sweet for my taste, so I will only use half the brown sugar next time.

I am completely addicted to this granola recipe. My kids love it, my friends love it, you won't buy granola again.

Makes a nice toasted granola because it is cooked at a slightly higher temp than most recipes. The raw cashews really toasted up nicely! I love dates, so that's a bonus. Made several times already, varying grains (adding Chex type cereals) and spices!
