Nice vegan recipe. Made a few subs: mashed sweet potato instead of applesauce, coconut oil instead of veggie, and fresh ginger instead of ground. Tasty little cakey-textured cookies! Took others' advice and only baked for 12 minutes.

i won't be making these cookies again. If i did, i'd be sure to leave out the whole wheat flour (substitute more white) and leave the flax for your morning smoothie or oatmeal. I love wholesome food, but these were very disappointing.

I thought these cookies were fantastic! I added another tablespoon of flaxseed and used a pumpkin spice blend instead of plain ground ginger. I also didn't roll them in sugar or flour to shape them at the end, I just wetted my hands a little. I also added more candied ginger. They are soft and delicious! In the future I am going to try with less sugar as the candied ginger adds a lot of sweetness. As well I only cooked them for 12 minutes or so and they came out perfect.

Well... It's a sugar cookie without the proper amount of fat so they burn instantly at 12 min. at 15mins and Heaven only KNOWS what they would have looked like at 18mins! They turned hard the next day, too much like a gingersnap and not enough like shortbread - even after being stored correctly. The flavor is good, I will concede that. Does anyone know how to substitute BACK the milk and butter into the recipe? I am sorry for the nice law student that this recipe comes from. I am so tired of trying healthy-ish recipes that turn out badly.

I made these for a party and everyone loved them. I did not have any problem with them burning but I always check early because I use convection. One step NOT to miss is the chilling. I think that makes all the difference and mine looked just like the picture.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The flavor was nice, but either the oven temperature or the time is completely off. I took the advice of the other reviewer and cut the baking time down to 12 minutes, but the cookies were still burned! The second batch I cut down to 9 minutes, and they burned again. Scrapping off the bottoms of cookies does not make for a satisfying cookie.

I actually liked these cookies. I was worried all the ginger would be too much but it was a good balance. I cut the recipe down to 3/4 of a cup of sugar and added a little more flaxseed than the recipe called for, but other than that I kept the recipe as is. My only recommendation is to watch the cooking time. I took my cookies out at 12 min. and they were perfect. 18 min. seems too long and mine would of burned had I left them in this long.
