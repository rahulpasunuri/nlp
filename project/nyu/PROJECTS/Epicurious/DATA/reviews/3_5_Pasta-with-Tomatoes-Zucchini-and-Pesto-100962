We halved the recipe, used homemade pesto and gluten free pasta from TruRoots. We had oven-roasted chicken breasts on the side, seasoned with Penzey's Italian Mix. A wonderful weeknight dinner for 2.

Thanks bethnchris for the recommendations. I used fresh tomatoes, crushed red pepper and a bit of anchovy paste, making sure not to overcook the vegetables, especially after adding the fresh tomatoes. It was delicious and easy for a weeknight meal.

This is a very unremarkable sauce. If you make it, do add some amount of red pepper flakes or it will be very uninspired.

Excellent with four changes: Fresh tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon chili pepper flakes (as others have recommended), a small amount of anchovy paste to give it some meaty flavor, and lastly, under-cook the pasta and then finish cooking it in the pan so that the liquid from the veggies infuses into the pasta.

I made this recipe for dinner this evening. As another cook suggested, I substituted gnocchi. I also added the red pepper flakes. It was really a delicious meal that got raves from both my husband and teenaged daughter. I'll definitely make this again and incorporate it into my standard rotation of recipes.

I had never used mint in italian cooking before. Usually I use basil or oregano. I didn't know what to expect, but I was quite pleased with the flavor.

Delicious! Made just as written except for the addition of the recommended pepper flakes (1/2 tsp.) Served over whole wheat spaghetti. Very easy -- definitely would make again!

Made this the other night for a party and it was delicious. I nixed the zucchini just because, used my homemade pesto and substituted 2 packages of gnocchi for the spaghetti. Took the advice of other reviewers and added crushed red pepper into the sauce, then sprinkled the chopped basil on top with the parmesan. It was a hit - I will definitely make this dish again.

Nothing magnificent, but it was easy to prepare. Next time I'll try adding some red pepper flakes and maybe another vegetable to liven it up a bit.

Really nice and simple. I made it with Penne and added some sliced turkey pepperoni I had in the fridge for some kick.

Excellent! We added bite-sized pieces of grilled chicken breast right at the end. This makes 13 bowl-sized servings; tasty leftovers.

Delicious! I added toasted pine nuts and skipped the pesto (since all the ingredients for a fresh pesto were already in the sauce). A wonderful and easy summer meal.

This is basically a capri sauce and its a wonderful way to use up zucchini from the garden. It's important to cook the zucchini down before adding the tomatoes and the red pepper flakes are a must. Fresh basil is the best instead of the purchased pesto. Of course having fresh basil is helpful. ;)

Yummy! This is a great recipe - especially for those who have gardens with zucchini and basil. Very easy to make, tasty. Strongly recommend this for a weekday meal or when entertaining non-meat loving friends.

Very good and simple. The colors are beautiful together. I did add a couple of big tablespoons of the pesto to the vegetables and also a generous amount of salt and black pepper. The leftover vegetable sauce was delicious. My husband loved it.

Excellent weeknight meal. Filling and easy. Adapts well to tweaking. I used basil pesto and fresh tomatoes.

Could this be any easier? I did make some adjustments, though, for what I had on hand. I added 1/2 cup sundried tomatoes, soaked in warm water - because I only had one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. I also added some pine nuts and red pepper flakes, following the suggestion of a previous reviewer... and about 1/4 cup fresh parsley, and 1 Tbs capers because I had them and figured 'why not?' But, knowing how easy this recipe is (and how easy to modify), I will definitely make this again.

Will definitely make this again. So easy and delicious,dinner guests all loved it and wanted the recipe. Added pine nuts and red chile peppers too....mmmm.

This is a wonderful basic recipe to make the most of those excess summer vegetables. I used a mixture of zucchini and summer squash, along with some baby portabellos. A good glug of red wine, and a pinch of red pepper flakes certainly didn't hurt, either. I had mine on wilted spinach; hubby accompanied his portion with hot Italian sausage; cats snuck off with bits of stolen spaghetti, and all were happy.

Totally agree with the reviewer who said this is more of an idea of what to do with extra zucchini and canned tomatoes than an innovative recipe. That said, it's terribly easy and pretty quick - and it tastes good enough that I'd make it again.

Rating: 3
A recipe that I will certainly make again and will not hesitate to make for company. I poured the diced tomatoes in a skillet and stirring constantly reduced the liquid and added about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to the tomatoes to give the recipe a "zing". The end result was not too spicey. I sauteed the onions and garlic a little before adding the zucchini to the pan. Making sure that the zucchini was tender crisp and then added the tomato and red pepper to the vegetable mixture. Just heat it all a few minutes before continuing with the recipe.

Excellent recipe! Light and tasty! I add the pesto to the veggies and serve the veggies over the pasta, not mixed.

I made my own pesto, which was wasted in this dish. It's a simplistic idea, quick to make, and I guess the appeal is in the fact that you can throw it together and it tastes OK. I thought it was just OK, not very creative... hardly even a recipe as much as an idea of what to do with the spare zucchini and canned tomatoes in your kitchen.

Thought it was wonderful and not too heavy for dinner. But substituted green pesto for black olive pesto which turned out delicious!

Nice, simple, fast, and satisfying. I usually like to add a bit of meat, either chicken breast or kielbasa sausage. When zuchinni is not in season, I substitute a variety of mushrooms and it comes out great every time! A little patience is needed while simmering off the tomato liquid, but the concentrated sauce at the end is worth it.

Fast and easy. Added red and green peppers. I strained out the liquid that the tomato sauce made since it didn't evaporate as per the recipe. Would definitely make this one again!

I made this recipe for company and everyone really liked it. I liked it too, but I will say that I sort it was a bit bland. I bought only one pkg of Knorr pesto, and it needed two so that may be one reason. The other thing was that the recipe said to simmer the zucchini and tomatoes until all liquid evaporates, but just the opposite happened for me. The longer it simmered, the more liquid was created - I ended up having to spoon a lot of it out myself because the zucchini was getting too done. It was good though, and I will be making it again.

Excellent recipe! I added some mushrooms and italian sausage. Very easy to make.

Nice & simple. Like one of the other reviewers, I also thought adding fresh basil (in addition to the pesto) was a little redundant...but rather than omitting it or substituting, I like to finely chop a little and sprinkle it on top as asort of edible garnish.

I really thought this was a good recipe. I recommend making the tomato sauce one day in advance. I used my own pesto from the freezer.

Used home-made fettuccini and drew a "Stupendous!" from my not-easy-to impress wife!

This was a wonderfully easy recipe. I cut the entire recipe in half and used egg noodles instead of spaghetti. I highly recommend using fresh mozzerella. My family asked for seconds. It was even better the second day.

This was a great meal made with ingredients already in the house. I used some homemade pest I had in the freezer and some fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned. I also added some sliced mushrooms to the saute mixture. The only thing I didn't have was the fresh basil, but I don't think it mattered. I'll definitely make this again.

Well, the first time I made this is was good, but the next time it was even better, with the addition of the hat.

Fits my usual criteria of simple and delicious. Wouldn't change a thing really, although I might try a fresh herb other than basil since pesto is one of the ingredients. Perhaps oregano or italian parsley could be substituted.

What a WONDERFUL dish. I used mt own pesto and added fresh romas from the garden. Beautiful over angel hair pasta. Chop up chicken, fry tofu or sprinkel cooked lentils and toss on top for the perfect meal.

This dish was excellent. I made my own pesto from receipe smoked chicken and sun-dried tomato sandwiches using a basil-olive pesto. I also colorful variety pasta that made the dish look great!

No, not fancy, but undeniably good. Easy to make and delicious (we reduced the amount of pesto). This is a keeper. I suppose if you need it to be fancy, you could always put a little hat on it.
