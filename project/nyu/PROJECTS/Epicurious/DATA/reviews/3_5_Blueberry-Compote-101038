A very nice simple addition to dessert or pancakes/waffles. In the future, I would add a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and/or all spice to really add pop.

made the compote to top whole wheat blueberry pancakes. Cut the sugar a bit and also added Grand Marnier at the end per a previous suggestion. A delicious addition to our Sunday pancakes. Will make again.

These are the best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life. Really. The batter appeared too thick the 1st time I made them but they came out moist and perfectly. I am too lazy to make compote so I put fresh blueberries in the batter or have them with just syrup.

I tried this recipe the other morning on top of pancakes. It didn't come out as thick as I'd hoped, but it was so sweet and good! Though, after awhile, the skin on the blueberries got tough and a little hard to chew.

Add 1 1/2 T. Grand Marnier at the end after you take it off the heat. Delicious!

Great recipe. Easy to put together, tastes great, makes the kitchen smell wonderful. I think you could substitute just about any frozen berry here, but if you make it with blueberries squeeze half a lemon into it.

Excellent using either fresh or frozen berries. You may not need to cook them as long as stated in recipe. Also, you may need to add a bit more sugar to taste.

I served this compote as a bed for slices of lemon almond cake. Wonderful! This will be great over vanilla ice cream, too!

Simple and excellent. We chilled the compote then served it over pound cake with ice cream for dessert. Fantastic!

Really great and easy. I often use frozen mixed berries and it's delicious.

This recipe was SO GOOD! I had it on the whole-wheat oatmeal pancakes and it was absolutely exceptional...I don't think I ever want to use the corn syrup labeled as syrup ever again! This was very well received by the other tasters, as well! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

This is a staple in our house. I make it with Splenda replacing the sugar to keep the calories down. Great on pancakes or over ricotta creme...just like cheesecake only without the guilt!!

This compote is very good. I made it to go with dessert crepes and it was a hit! It's easy to make and the ingredients can be found year-round.

I liked this, but I felt like it didn't have enough liquid to put over pancakes in place of syrup. I decided to add some maple syrup to the mixture at the end, and made a maple blueberry compote - it was delicious!

Great, fluffy pancake recipe. ---PEOPLE---UNTHAWED---Is Not the same as DEFREEZE---OR THAW ! ! ! --- the blueberries should be THAWED, not UNTHAWED! ;)

Made as instructed and served over waffles. Pretty simple, but good. Made a second time but substituted raspberries for blueberries and turned out well.

My daughter and husband LOVED this! I added peaches because I didn't have enough blueberries and it was wonderful. This might have to replace maple syrup as the best pancake topping....

Super easy, delicious berry compote. I had only half the amount of frozen blueberries and substituted frozen mixed berries for the other half w/ no problems at all. We had this on french toast instead of pancakes, and it was fantastic. I only wish there were leftovers to put on vanilla ice cream later on.

Simple but good. What more could you want. A note to a Cook from Birmingham; it says unthawed and it means unthawed. In other words, start with frozen berries and do not thaw them before using.

delish... just have to be a grammar snob and point out that "unthawed" means frozen! Sheesh.

How perfect is this compote?! It needs to be cooked in a non-reactive pot, and is just so great with any pancake recipe (even ones with other berries). I make a fresh batch at the beginning of the week, and now nobody in the house wants syrup or any other topping except for this. A++++!

So easy and delicious. The perfect topping and it looks elegant!

I reduce the sugar and water to 1/4 cup, and add a little fresh lemon juice (1-2 tsp.) which really brightens the flavor. Fantastic on the pancakes!

it's the perfect topping for pancakes - period!

Made the blueberry compote with fresh blueberries and it got rave reviews from all who tasted it!!! Definitely am making it again.....tomorrow!

Delicious compote. I've made it for pancakes, Belgian waffles, French toast, and ice cream. Works just as great with fresh blueberries as with frozen.

Quick and easy. You can make it ahead, or as you start mixing the pancakes. My seven year old who doesn't like regular pancake syrup, loved the blueberry compote.

The pancakes are nice and light, with the blueberries lending a refreshing hint of summer. What an excellent way to start the day!
