This is so easy and delicious! I used heirloom cherry tomatoes and put kosher salt on the crust before baking! Yum!

The key to this is to truly carmelize the onions to where they are sweet; extra sugar (about double the recipe) and a tin of anchovies really helps). I did a provalone topping for extra goodness and it was a hit with even the staunchest anchovie haters.

A big hit with my guests, and pretty simple to make. I'm probably blind, but I couldn't find frozen or fresh pizza dough in my "specialty" grocer's freezer, so I just caved and made my own, which is very straightforward. Like any good pizza, the fresh crust makes a difference, and I'd do it again this way in the future.

Though it looks nice, the taste was awful! The onion flavor was way too overpowering. I would perhaps use artichoke hearts instead - something with a milder flavor. We tasted onions the entire evening. I definitely won't make this again.

Made this for a New Years' party, but was not overly impressed with the outcome. I didn't like this enough to make it again.

I made this for a holiday gathering, and it was delicious and easy. I cooked the toppings and prepped the pizzas in the afternoon so that all I had to do was heat them up shortly before my guests arrived. This was an easy appetizer, and quite the crowd pleaser. I'm going to make this recipe again for my New Year's Eve party.

This is a wonderful hors d'oeurve! My guests loved this and it quickly disappeared. I used fresh pizza dough which is offered in some specialty grocery stores.
