I felt the lemon overpowered the dish, and the dish as a whole lacked the creaminess normally found in other recipes. I'll keep searching.

Wonderful! The second time I made this, I stirred the spinach into the sauce and it was much easier to serve.

Yummy! I use more cream... let's face it, this ain't a waiste-trimmer.

Very good flavor contrasts. 3-10 oz bags of spinach is a bit much for 4 servings, however. And the amount of water can be reduced so that you end up with about 1/2 cup of liquid and don't lose a lot of vitamins.
