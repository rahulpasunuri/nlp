This was very good. I used fresh Rosemary from our garden and added some white pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. The cheese was an integral part of this soup's goodness.

While I might comment on a recipe without making it, I would never RATE one just based on what I had read. I am giving this one four forks, however, just to balance out "kevinkooks" giving in one based on his preconceptions.

A very pretty soup, great for when the weather gets cold. Not sure why a few others say it is bland. Just be sure to use fresh thyme and rosemary and only add a amall dash of sea salt just before serving. I made it with farfalle pasta. If people still want more flavor, I suggest adding fresh corn kernels.

I made the following changes and thought this soup was delicious! Omitted the pasta (not necessary) and blended/mashed half of the beans to create a creamier soup. Also used half chicken broth/half water. Very tasty!

We make this soup almost every Thanksgiving weekend and we use the turkey carcass to make the stock. It is a delicious tradition!

Anytime I see a soup recipe that only uses water as its base, I quickly move on. You don't have to try many soup recipes to eventually learn that soups must use at least half stock to be flavorful. I don't know how much your local water company flavors its water, but mine does not.

Perhaps I should comment on the presumed blandness of this recipe by suggesting a few changes in preparation: diminuish the cooking liquid: it should cover the beans by 1 inch or so. You can always add more. Change once or twice at beginning of cooking, when white foam appears. The dish will then be easier to digest. Add the minced rosemary to the cooking liquid of the beans. Add some sea salt in the last 15 minutes of cooking time. Add first sage leaves, then diced chili, then cubed celery stick to onions when frying them, before adding the canned tomatoes. You may omit the celery salt in favor of more sea salt. These slight variations in preparation will make quite a difference in taste.

My family loves this recipe. We make it the day after Thanksgiving. We use the turkey carcass to make stock and make the soup with that stock. It is delicious!

This comes from a fabulous restaurant; in fact, my husband proposed to me there. (the food was that good!) I can't imagine them serving this soup according to the recipe- it IS bland. But, if you add some beef broth, extra herbs, lemon and salt, it is quite delicious and worthy of a buca mario dish.

I read the recipe three times to make sure I did not miss a main ingredient! It is completely bland, completely lacking in spices. I am perplexed, however, because so many people loved it! What am I missing?

It seems to me that many of the reviewers' taste buds have been severely raped by the constant ingestion of fast food and other crap that we call cuisine. Having eaten in Florence and many other Italian cities, I can safely say that the regional fare is often lost on the masses in this country. Perhaps it is the lack of an over-abundance of salt? Hot peppers? etc.

Yummy. Cheap. Easy. Healthful. My husband loved it, too. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have fresh sage - substituted dried, rubbed sage. I wished there was more broth, though. Next time I will add chicken broth as someone else suggested.

The next time I'm in Florence I will go out of my way to avoid that restaurant. Bland and boring. An inaccurate recipe if there ever was one. I would rate this one bent fork.

I was confused about the celery stalk and unpeeled garlic, as well. I just coarsely chopped the garlic and sliced the celery and went from there. I also used mostly chicken broth (13 cups broth, 3 water) which probably added tons of flavor. This is a really great soup! I didn't try it but I would think that a little chopped basil might be good it it, too.

What do you do with the celery and the unpeeled garlic after cooking? Since nothing was listed I removed the celery but left the garlic in (too much trouble to try to find them). I saved a lot of time by using 2 cans of Progresso cannelini beans and when the soup was done, I added the uncooked pasta to the soup to save time and trouble. Overall it came out quite well. By adding the pasta to the soup to cook, made it very hearty. I'll make it again and add hot turkey sausage.

Does anyone from Florence eat at this restaurant? I ask because I wonder if there was an error in reducing the recipe from restaurant quantity to family quantity. If anyone has details, please add them here!

Tip for soaking all types of beans: add 2-3 tsp bicarb of soda to the water to avoid intestinal "side effects" of bean consumption. Be sure to rinse the beans well prior to cooking!

This was a hit with my family. My brother-in-law, whose mother was a terrfic Italian cook, raved about it. I used 2 cans beef stock, 2 cans vegetable stock and 8 cups of water. It reduced well in 2 hours and was the perfect consistency. I added 1 # Smithfield smoked ham steak, diced, 1 T. fresh rosemary and 1/2 T. fresh sage, Tabasco, and plenty of salt and pepper. I think this would be delicious served with Italian sausage. Thanks Epicurious! Happy Thanksgiving to all.

Made the recipe BEFORE reading the reviews - my BAD! Agree with the "too much liquid" folks - next time I'll halve the stock. Also, added more onions (for flavor) - but it ended up quite delicious and hearty. I used chicken bouillion, too - which heightened the flavor.

Took the advice about chicken stock, pureeing some of soup (actually used an extra can of Great Northern beans) and added an extra can of tomatoes. Also added some Italian seasoning. While I would make this again, I'd only use the recipe as the most general of guidelines.

Gail . . .did you read the recipe first? Doesn't seem like a reipe that can be whipped together in 30 minutes to me. Also, not every soup is supposed to be "hearty." Some soups, like this one, are intended to be subtle, as a first course.

This is the worst recipe that I have EVER made. I should have realized that 16 cups of water and 1/2 tsp. of celery salt would not cut it. What was supposed to be an easy dinner (because I soaked the beans the day before) turned out to be a 2 hour ordeal. After I cooked the beans for the first hour, I realized what a mess I had and so I had to boil it on high for another hour just to boil off all that water. Then the seasoning began: more fresh sage and rosemary, more salt, the rinds off my parmesan cheese, cayenne pepper, and more salt, fresh ground pepper, then I had to fish out the celery stalk and the husks from the five cloves of unpeeled garlic. What were you thinking? I'll stick with Emeril, thank you very much!

I made this soup with some variation from the recipe. Use chicken broth instead of water and make sure you discard the celery stalk and garlic,(I also put some onion in at the beginning that I left in). When I sauteed the onion and tomatoes, I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and some chopped celery and a good amount of black pepper. I also added about 1 1/2 cups of tubettini instead of 3/4. I omitted the rosemary, sage and celery salt but topped the soup with some grated Romano cheese when served.

If this was a "stand-out" part of meals in Italy, I would hate to think what the rest were like! I suppose this was my fault...should have known by the ingredients that this would be a bland soup.. Don't think the Soup Nazi has to fear this soup. Wish I had read the reviews first...Ah well

I wish I had read the reviews before making this soup. My family found this recipe very bland. Next time, I'll incorporate others' suggestions.

This recipe is very bland as is, so I made some changes -- I added peppercorns, roasted garlic, some white wine, and bay leaves when I cooked the beans. I only used vegetable stock and used less than recommended, and added chopped celery. Since it was very watery, I cooked the pasta in the soup for 8 minutes and that thickened it up nicely. Next time I'll add a ham hock to the beans, too for added flavor. Thanks to the other reviewers -- you gave me good ideas to incorporate into it!

I thought it was very good, but I also used about 1/2 beef stock instead of all that water. I thought it was delicious, and so did my husband.

A cook from Westchester, NY The flavours in the soup were really good. I would also add more celery - I chopped mine up and added it to the soup. However, I found it far too thin - I would cook the beans in the amount of water (16 cups) suggested, but then would probably use only half and then add more as needed. I also added some vegetable stock.

This soup was great as a winter meal-- but did make some changes as well. Used canned white beans [2 cups], substituted 4 cups chicken stock for all that water, left out celery and celery salt [don't like it]. Using the canned beans made it much faster as well. Also added the pasta 15 min. before the end of the cooking, so I didn't have to use another pot. It worked out well and got rave reviews from my husband.

Growing up in the midwest, my little brother and I called this soup "pastavajollie" imitating our Grandma Theresa's Italian. Whenever we had ham and bean soup, a couple days later this soup would be transformed to pastavajollie by adding water and macaroni. Thanks for the memories.

You're pretty funny, Mark H. I must say there is a difference between canned & dried, in that you can control the mushiness of the beans better when you make them from dried. Sometimes canned is mushy. If you like mushy, it's not a problem, obviously. If the soup is too runny, mash some canned beans & add to the soup to thicken.

I grew up eating tons of "pasta fazool" and I think dried beans have a much better flavor and texture than canned. Yes, they take longer, but they are cheaper and really just as easy to prepare. You just have to plan a day ahead is all. So when you have the time, do use dried!

In Italy, most of their classic dishes came from the struggling peasant class. People were just too poor to be able to use meat and other, more expensive products. Beans, herbs and vegetables could be grown with little expense, so that is why garlic, pungent herbs and spices and vegetables were mostly used. This dish is more commonly called "Pasta e Fagioli" or in Southern Italy it may even be called "Pasta Fazool." There is absolutely no difference in using canned beans: using dried beans exclusively is great for the egos of "Yuppies" or cooks who love the extra work!

I would also make this soup again, with some modifications. The recipe does not call for removing the halved celery stalk and unpeeled garlic. Has to be an oversight- which I discovered when the soup was done. I would use less water next time instead of 16 cups that is called for, or use chicken broth instead. It needs extra seasoning. It was bland until I doctored it up with red pepper flakes and a little extra salt.

Rating: 2
I would remake this dish again with the following modifications: Add 3 stalks of celery and dice all; add one more chopped onion; eliminate the Sage,it overpowers the dish;add pepper to taste;puree 1/4 of the soup and if you leave out the pasta, puree 1/2 of the soup and add back; cook the soup at least one day in advance and refrigerate until you are ready to serve it, the reboil it. Be careful to not over salt, you can always add salt, it is nearly impossible to remove it.

I eagerly await the mail pouch to bring my monthly Bon Appetites as I live in Bangkok..I made this immediately, and we all loved it! I washed the beans a few times before starting the soaking process and used only chicken broth when making the soup instead of just water the recipe called for. I did not have fresh sage and rosemary, but I did have two new unopened bottles of the same dried spices. I used a fusili pasta and think any small pasta will do the trick. The soup freezes well also. I have already e-mailed this to friends and family. What a delicious and easy recipe! perfect with a green salad and a crusty loaf of bread. Next time I will make sure to have fresh herbs..

I always soak my beans overnight at room temperature, then dump out the water and replace with fresh for cooking. Always comes out great. Kombu in the cooking water is good too.

Beans and Macaroni. My Italian American family made this regularly for our Friday "meatless" dinners. Sprinkle with hot pepper flakes and grated cheese. This is a homey meal. Sometimes made soupy - sometimes the pasta absorbing most of the liquid. It's warm and cozy

A special reminder to all, if soaking beans overnight, make sure that they are kept in the refrigerator, and not on a counter at room temperature. Food safety is important. Keep cooking :)
