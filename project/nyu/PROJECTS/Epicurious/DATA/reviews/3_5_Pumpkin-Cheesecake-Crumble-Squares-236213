I loved this recipe. I followed the reviewers' comments and doubled the filling. I wish I'd doubled the topping as well as it was "enough" topping, but could have been more. I will absolutely make this again and two friends have requested the recipe.

Made a great gluten free version by substituting the flour cup for cup w/ Jules GF flour & GF oats. I made in the square pan as directed and baked the crust for only 20 mins before pouring filling over. I baked the crumbs for the full 12 mins, but stored till before serving - sometimes GF flours can get soft and these were nice & crunchy. The crust has held up well though - will definitely make again.

AWESOME vegan version: Substitute vegan sugars, earth balance "butter" (freeze the stick first before cutting), tofutti "cream cheese," 1/4c applesauce instead of the egg, and tofutti "sour cream." Used a whole can of pumpkin. Increased cinnamon to 2t and added 1/4t nutmeg. I did it in a 13"x9" pan, and it worked great. Cooked the topping for 10min (made sure it just started to brown), the crust for 20min, and the topping for ~25min until it wasn't jiggly in the center. I didn't have time to chill it for 2 hours, so I put it in the freezer for ~20min to cool down and took it to the potluck. It was a huge hit and was super yummy warm/room temp!

Have made this twice in the last two weeks to rave reviews. This was the star dessert at our family's Halloween dinner and Trick or Treat night and my husband liked it so much that he requested it for a potluck at work this week. Have had many requests for the recipe so I'm passing it along. The crust was delicious but a little hard the first time around, the second time I used a little less in the baking dish and left it a little more crumbly instead of packing it down hard. Cooked for the full 30 minutes and it was perfect! I can think of many applications for the extra streusel crumble...

From reading several reviews I adjusted the recipe, and wanted to share for ease of others in the future. (I haven't made it yet, but plan to before the day is over!) 9x13 Pan Preheated oven 350 degree Ferenheit. Crust (bake time 10 min) 1 c AP Flour, 3/4 c Sugar- Brown, 1/2 t Salt, 1/2 c Butter- Unsalted, 1 c Pecans, 3/4 c Oats- Old Fashioned. Filling (bake 20 min until set) 16 oz Cream Cheese, 1 1/2 c Pumpking Puree, 1 c Sugar- Granulated, 1 Egg- Large, 2 tsp Vanilla Extract, 1 Tbsp + 2 tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice. Topping (bake 5 min) 1 1/2 c Sour Cream, 3 Tbsp Sugar- Granulated, 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract.

I love this recipe! If you do what many other reviewers suggest and use a 9x13 it makes a lot of dessert for a party or big gathering. I followed other's advice and only baked the crust 10 minutes and doubled the filling (but only 1 egg) and topping and I loved the result. I used reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream and it still turned out delicious. The only thing I will change next time will be baking the crust/filling step a little longer for a firmer consistency and maybe subbing in pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and ginger. I will definitely make again.

I used walnuts instead of pecans and it still tasted great. I cooked the crust for 30 minutes as directed, but it ended up rather crunchy - almost like a Nature Valley granola bar with pumpkin cheesecake on it. Next time I'd shorten that initial baking time since it's going back in the oven for another 25 minutes in steps 2 and 3. Overall great flavor - just would have preferred a softer crust. My oven usually runs true to temperature, so I think I'll adjust the baking time when I make this again.

I''m quite an inexperience baker and this was my first time baking anything from scratch other than some simple chocolate chip cookies.... It was not overcomplicated and it came out not tasting too sweet with the perfect amount of pumpkin. The crust came out to be so delicious when I thought that it was going to be the hardest part! If I make this again I will probably make more filling and less of the topping because for some reason the topping overpowered the filling part of the bars. I also used too small of a pan and even after deducting from the recipe my crust was a bit too thick compared to the rest of it. Good thing the crust was so good so it came out tasting marvelous with a bit more of a crunch!

After reading many, many reviews and using much of the feedback, I made this for Thanksgiving. It was outstanding and to die for!!! I also made the Epicurious dark chocolate cheesecake with Scharffen Barger dark chocolate and $40 worth of ingredients (it was really boring and one-dimensional) and these pumpkin cheesecake squares were far superior. First, I used an 8.5" by 14" glass dish and mixed the crust by hand and the filling and topping with an electric mixer as I don't have a food processor. For the crust I did what other reviewers suggested and only baked it 10 minutes. It was still difficult to cut as it was pretty hard. I also added 1 t. pumpkin pie spice to the crust. I baked the crumbles 7 minutes and that was almost too much. Twelve would have definitely burned them. For the filling I did what another reviewer suggested and doubled it with the exception of the egg. I used only one egg and it was perfect. I also added 2 t. of vanilla and used 2 t. of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and ginger. The topping I also doubled but added extra vanilla, about 1.5 t. I couldn't believe how these flavors burst in my mouth!!! They were the best thing we ate that day and there were rave reviews from the other guests. Thanks to everyone for their feedback! It contributed to a great dessert for everyone!

I made these on Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED them. I changed two things though, because my mother doesnt tolerate nuts well, I made a graham craker crust, which I think made it better. I also added just a touch of vanilla extract to the filling, on accident, but turned out very well. Soooooo yummy.

Rating: 4
I made this following the directions, with the only exceptions that I baked the crust for 15 minutes, and that I added a bit more pumpkin (1 cup). I would agree with previous reviewers that the proportions might be a bit off for a 9x9 pan. I made it in a 9x9, but did not use all of the crust mixture (used about 3/4ths of it and tossed the rest, otherwise the crust would have been very thick). Otherwise, I think this is an excellent recipe and I'll be making it again!

I loved this dessert! The yummy crust and topping make it interesting in both texture and flavor...not just boring cheesecake. I took the advice to not bake the crust as long and 15 minutes was perfect. Other than that I made it according to the recipe and it was a hit! This recipe will become a regular seasonal favorite for me!!

Yum! I doubled this recipe and made it in a 11x15" pan, and then brought the squares to a small party. Everyone loved these! A word of caution - baking the crumbs until golden results in a VERY crunchy product... For the second time making these I baked them for the 12 minutes as directed, although not golden they were perfect!

I make this every Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie. It's a family favorite.

I clipped this recipe from the magazine and, unfortunately, didn't check the reviews before making it. After following recipe exactly, the crust was thick and tough as a brick. My husband suggested that we just scrape off the filling (which was just OK, but nothing special) and we pretty much ended up doing just that. Shame on Bon Appetit for printing this recipe obviously without any testing. It might be better with the adjustments suggested by other reviewers, but then what's the point in having the recipe at all? Will never make this again.

Rating: 3
These were completely delicious, but I totally agree with changing the amounts of things. It is perfect in a 9X13 pan, with double the filling, reduced cook time on the crust, and 1.5 times the topping. Also, I used butternut squash instead of the pumpkin and it turned out great.

Rating: 0
I love this recipe. The combination of flavors is great and it is very popular. It is easy and, as long as the squares are firm, they make great finger food and they present well. Increasing everything 1.5 times is perfect for a 9 x 13 pan. A glass pan works fine. To answer another reviewer question, stay with one egg. Two eggs change the consistency in not a good way. I use pumpkin pie spices, increased by 2 x and add extra cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg and a little more ginger. I bake this (10-15 minutes longer than the recipe) until the pumpkin is firm all over (NOT jelly like in the middle as you would for a pumpkin pie), cool it down on a rack and refrigerate over night so the squares are not too soft. Decreasing the initial baking time for the crust by 10 minutes is a must. I also pack the crust tight in the bottom (not loose as someone suggested). The "crumble" with pecans or walnuts is the best part!!!

Rating: 3
I agree that the crust will be over cooked if you don't reduce the first cook time to 15-20 minutes. I used a 9"x 13" pan and the only thing I chose to increase was the pumpkin; I used a whole small can. It wasn't my favorite holiday dessert, but everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Rating: 3
I didn't find these to be time consuming at all. They took about an hour start to finish, with just enough time to clean the kitchen while the filling was baking. While I prefer a traditional style cheesecake, for a potluck these were perfect. I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup for more pumpkin flavor (with a dash of cloves and a sprinkle of nutmeg) and reduced the cooking time to 12 minutes on the crust. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and I thought it was perfect. The crust had a nice caramel-nut flavor and the pumpkin filling was delicious. Thought the proportions as written were just right!

Rating: 3
This is a good solid recipe, so I gave it 3 stars. I did not increase the amount of filling and thought that it was a perfectly acceptable amount. However I agree, decrease the cooking time on the crust to 15 minutes and do not firmly pack the crust into the bottom of the pan. With these minor changes the recipe was just about perfect. I read several reviews that said it was really time consuming to make, and I felt that this was a non- issue.

Rating: 0
I would strongly advise that you put the crust alone only for about 10 minutes (no longer!). 30 minutes is far too long and by the end of the next baking session, the crust becomes so hard, it is extremely difficult to cut and remove from pan!

I've made this several times and it is excellent. You do need the nuts though, otherwise the taste would be pretty boring.

Would these work if I made them nut free? Or are the pecans integral to the taste? Would I need to adjust the crust ingredients, or just leave out the pecans? Any help would be appreciated.

A question: how do you increase the filling by 1.5, as many reviewers have done, when the recipe calls for one egg?

I'm not a pumpkin pie fan, but liked these bars. I do think it needs more cinnamon - maybe even added to the topping as well. I agree with other reviews - 30mins to bake the crust alone is way too long - it becomes dark brown and it still has another 20mins of baking once you add the filling. Take it out at golden brown. I used a standard 9x13" pan and did 1.5 times for everything -the crust, filling and topping - and that seemed right to me.

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and it was very well received. I did use the neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese and I think that might have contributed to a looser consistency filling. Instead of a firm texture, it was a bit more custardy. They still loved it!

Rating: 4
Ditto to the 9"x13" pan! The amount of crust the recipe made was just the right thickness for the larger pan. I did double the topping which was perfect. However, I used the filling portions as called for and would definately make 1 1/2 times the filling next time. Crust was pretty firm but easily cut through with a serrated knife and held it's shape beautifully. Will try baking crust for less time in the future.

It is very easy, fast and, oh, so good tasting dessert! Just right fo the season! In order to avoid hard crust, bake it just fo 15 minutes, it is absolutely enough. Sometimes I use yogurt instead of sour cream for topping! The photo of my creation http://www.flickr.com/photos/belochkavita/1559931965/ I baked it in small spring forms

I needed a fall dessert for 12. After reading "rhapsody's" review I made this recipe with the indicated portions for the crust, baked in a 9"x13" pan. I used 1 1/2 times the filling recipe and twice the topping recipe and it turned out wonderfully. It is light, not overly rich- tasting, and the pumpkin flavor is just right. This is not a complicated recipe, since so much is done in the food processor. A real find!

Huge success with this recipe! I love pumpkin and cheesecake! Yummy! Everyone whose tried the dessert fell in love with it and all traces of the dessert were gone in seconds. I've made the dessert twice now and I would definitely not cook the bottom crust as long. I ran out of rolled oatmeal so I substituted it for steel- cut oatmeal and it turned out great a little nuttier taste to the crust! Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this recipe, particularly the crust and topping, which I will use in fruit crumbles, etc. I reduced the amount of crust/topping by a third, baked them a shorter time to avoid the "hardness" others spoke of, and made the rest of the recipe as written. Next time, I think I will up the cheesecake filling as well. As written, this would be a very crust-dominant recipe. But as it is a wonderful crust, I'd eat them all that way, too!

This is an excellent recipe. I have read some reviews about the crust being hard and unappetizing. I wish to address that. First, I bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of 9x9. The crust is then spread out more and becomes the perfect thickness. The crust doesn't need to bake as long that way and is not as hard. I increase the cheesecake filling because it can be lost otherwise. I also double the sour cream topping because of the larger pan. Other than the 12 mins for the crust it will take longer to bake in these larger quantities, but it will be well worth it. I am a caterer and recently made several pans of these for a fundraiser. I had people coming back to the kitchen to ask for the recipe. They all said it was better than their beloved pie.

These were delicious! I did the 1/2 cup butter version from Bon Appetit magazine and would definitely step up the butter to 3/4 cup (like the online recipe)next time. The dough was too dry and the extra butter would definitely help. These would be great for dessert on Thanksgiving or any fall event.

Oh my yumminess! The only drawback to this recipe is the number of times you have to get in and out of the oven. Each component comes together quickly. I thought the pumpkin mix had great flavor - I did use top notch cinnamon, so that could have something to do with it. I also needed to bake the sourcream topping a few minutes longer. It gives a great tang to the recipe. I did not have a 9x9 square pan so used a 9-inch springform and had no problems. I would make this again and not change a thing about the recipe.

I was hesitant to try this recipe after reading some of the reviews, however the picture in the October 2006 BonApetit magazine looked divine, so I tried the recipe with a few suggestions from other reviewers. These were wonderful and a fun twist on a favorite. The Oct. issue of BonApetit magazine called for 1/2 cup butter for the crust so I assume the website has a misprint...the crust worked just beautifully. Also, I was careful not to press the crust heavily into the pan and I baked the crust for only 15 minutes and it turned out perfectly. I added a little more spice to the filling. I have made this recipe twice now and the second time I left off the sour cream layer and just added the crumble. It made a simple dessert bar that we liked even better.

Despite my excitement about this recipe, the results were just ok. The crust was too hard, but I loved the crumble topping. Most disappointing was the flavor of the pumpkin cheesecake; it just seemed to be missing something. Maybe a little orange liqueur and doubling the spices would have jazzed it up a bit - it's only mildly pumpkin-y and quite heavy as written.

For the last reviewer, the recipe should use 3/4 C of butter or else the crust is too hard. This recipe was OK, but the crust was bland tasting and given the amount of work, I would rather make a normal cheesecake.

This is a great recipe, simple and yummy. The good thing is that even though you have to bake it 3 different times, it is pretty low maintenence. Just mix everything together and toss it in the pan and you are set. I did have to bake the top sour cream layer a little bit longer than recommended, probably about 10-12 minutes.

This was surprisingly good for how easy it was! The balance of crust to filling was just right, it kept well in the fridge for days and days, it had all of the wonderful creaminess of a good cheesecake, but because it's served in squares, you don't feel like a glutton. A definite keeper!!
