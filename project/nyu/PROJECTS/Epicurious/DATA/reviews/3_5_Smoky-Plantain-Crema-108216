Avoid this recipe - if you want to try this sauce, go to starchefs.com and search for the one posted there. The Epicurious recipe results in a sauce that's not so much smoky as flamingly hot with not enough plantain flavor. I LOVE hot, spicy foods, but the heat index on this sauce is way too high for the average diner. More importantly, it totally blows away anything you want to serve with it (like the lovely grilled duck it's supposed to accompany) as well as even the most spice-friendly wines. It really irritates me that the recipe for what is purportedly the "same" sauce on starchefs.com is totally different - the proportions are completely changed and it has fewer ingredients. As a result, I'm sure the other recipe would produce a sauce where the plantain flavor is the star that's supported by a nice burn. Instead, here it plays a minor role competing against too many other big flavors and accompanied by an overpowering punch in the face. The other sauce, for example, calls for ONE-QUARTER the amount of scotch bonnet pepper per cup of cream plus no poblanos, also twice as much plantain per cup of cream. I'll be wary of trying more of Van Aken's recipes because of these huge inconsistencies in what he allows to be published.

I made this sauce as part of Norman's "Cumin Rubbed & Roasted Pork Havana w/Smoky Plantain Crema, a Blistered Bell Pepper & Sweet Corn Salsa" which is available on starchefs.com. Go to his recipes on that site to see it. It is superb! The Crema can easily be frozen & reheated, which makes it doubly worth the time it takes to make it!

Outstanding! I will make this again and again. Great on boneless, skinless chicken breasts. In an impulsive moment I added the strained spices and pulp to chicken bones to make a delicious chicken broth, which then became the base for fresh chicken & corn chowder -- which I will also repeat.

I'm in culinary school, and we made this in my "Current Cuisine" class! It is fantastic, and everyone loved it!

this sauce is *amazing*. somehow all the ingredients don't overpower the plantain flavor, but enhance it. it's really worth the effort to make this.
