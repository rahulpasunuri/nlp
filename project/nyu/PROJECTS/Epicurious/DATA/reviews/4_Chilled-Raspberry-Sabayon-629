Wow - super simple and gorgeous! I used Absolut Raspberri and the taste was fabulous. I can imagine it would also be great with Cointreau over peaches or other stone fruit. I used a Kitchen Aid standing mixer to whip the cream into the custrad mixture and the results were still light and fluffy. Definitely making this one again!

Grab your chair when you start to taste this.. it is out of this world and will give you a heartfelt.. lift off! Oh, my.. oh my! Outstanding recipe. I've made it at least 20 times in the last few years and every time.. it is awesome! I agree with the previous reviewer, it is easy to make and it is stellar for taste! I have added some lady fingers to martini glasses and served it that way.. you will need a few extra berries to fill the glasses correctly.

This dessert was to die for!!! I was a bit hesitant to try it, since it sounded too easy (to good to be true!), but it was a snap if you follow the directions exactly (which I did - I was having a large dinner party and was short on time - so I figured now was not the time to experiment!!!). I used the rasberry liquor because the framboise eau-de-vie was impossible to find (even my French friends didn't have any!). I also was very careful to fold in the whip cream. I made it early in the afternoon, the day of the party and it was perfect when I was ready to serve it six hours later. The look on my guests' faces when they took their first spoonful let you know that they thought they had died and gone to food heaven. This is defintely going to be my signature dessert from now on!

Very elegant. Will make it next time with Grand Marnier instead of raspberry liquer. Nice alternative to cakes, etc.

I've made this numerous times and was delighted to find it on the web site since my recipes are all in storage. I have increased the champagne to 1/4 cup plus 2 Tablespoons and decreased the clear brandy to 2 Tablespoons because the alcohol taste was a little too strong for my family. Still wonderful!
