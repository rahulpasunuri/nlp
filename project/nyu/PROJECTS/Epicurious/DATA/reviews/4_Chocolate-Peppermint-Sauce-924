Easy, delicious, and just as good reheated later. Couldn't be better.

Really good! I deleted the water and increased the chocolate to 8 ounces. I will definitely make this again. (the souffle it was paired with was not something I would make again, however).

This sauce is DIVINE! I've made it a few times, and in a crunch you can substitute peppermint extract for the candies, although it's not as good. I'd keep this sauce on hand all the time if chocolate was fat-free!
