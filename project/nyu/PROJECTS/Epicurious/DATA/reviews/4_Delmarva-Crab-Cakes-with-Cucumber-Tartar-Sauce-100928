I had a leftovers after a crabfest dinner party and this was my first pass at making crab cakes. These were really good and surprisingly easy. Like other cooks suggested, I put them in a 400-degree oven for 30 minutes and broiled them for a couple of minutes at the end to get the crust really crisp, which cut out the time and effort of having to fry them. I only had half a pound of crab meat, so I cut the recipe in half and it still worked. I also didn't have time to prepare the tartar sauce as instructed (salting the cucumbers for half an hour, letting it sit for at least an hour, etc.), so I just tossed everything together, and it was still really good. We each got one cake and it was enough -- they're pretty rich. Pair it with a butter lettuce salad and it makes a great dinner. I'm going to make this again when I have more time and a full pound of crab meat. Enjoy!

Added red pepper flakes, otherwise followed the recipe ... Very good.

This was very good and quite easy to make. For personal choices I baked at 400 for 20+ minutes until lightly browned. Added a 1/4 tsp of red pepper to both the mix and the sauce. The sauce was a bit salty for my taste, so I added a couple of heaping spoon fulls of Greek yogurt to smooth it out. There was lots of praise for this tasty dish.

3 1/2 forks for this one. The only complaint is the consistency of the sauce. It was a little runny for my taste. Next time I will add 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo. The only change was to use panko to coat the cakes. Simple to make, just make sure you let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before frying.

I made this for our Valentine's Dinner tonight. I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers. Made them the day before and I refrigerated them; they did not fall apart. Used regular breadcrumbs to make the crab cakes, but used Panko crumbs to coat them. Baked them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes instead of frying; they were perfect--light, crisp, and lightly browned. They were perfect. These are very lightly seasoned letting the sweet flavor of the crab shine through. The tartar sauce is good too, though I'd use a little less salt next time.

These crab cakes lend themselves well to the credo that "less really is more". The crab shines through so well, with just the right kick from the seasoning (I used Old Bay with great success). Rather than deep fry them, I pan-seared them in far less oil with results that left us wanting nothing else. Next time I may (not necessarily, though) add a pinch of cayenne for something a little extra, but otherwise, this recipe is fantastic as is. Served these with arugula, toasted hazelnuts, and shaved pecorino in a champagne vinaigrette (dressing from another epicurious recipe).Can't wait to make them again for an easy week-night supper...

This is one of my favorite recipes and my stepmother just begged me to make them for her upcoming visit. As to the baking question, here in Delmarva land crab cakes are typically either fried or broiled. I have made these both ways - to broil just lightly spray a baking sheet with oil, place the cakes on the sheet and lightly spray the tops of the cakes with oil. Broil until brown, about 3-4 minutes, on high with the cakes about 4 inches from the flame with the oven door open. I personally don't flip them for fear of breaking them or burning myself or both, but that's just me. They are probably healthier broiled but I think god really intended crab cakes to be fried.

Outstanding. Prepared at least a dozen times with crab, canned tuna, leftover poached salmon. It all works. The tartar sauce is killer. I double the recipe every time now, because the cakes are great at room temp and even cold. My hubby's favorite lunch is a "poboy" made from leftovers from this recipe, just split a roll and pile the sauce on top of the cold crab cake and some romaine!

I am a crab lover - and a crab cake lover. I have been looking for a recipe to cook for my husband so that he could experience how crab cakes should taste - crab with a few other ingredients, but mostly crab. We loved this recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure the meat was dry. I also mixed the crab meat in as the last step so that it would stay in tact. I used fresh bread crumbs and two eggs in the mixture and added one stalk of celery diced for just a tad of crunch. After I made the cakes I coated them with panko bread crumbs and placed them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. After I refrigerated them for about two hours I fried them in very hot oil (high) for about 3 minutes on each side. - Heaven. I can't wait to make them for my stepson.

How to save yourself lots of tears: Completely drain the crabmeat before adding to other infredients. Also, chill the formed cakes on wax paper in your refrigerator for at least a half hour before fryng. They will stay together much better this way.

These really are great crabcakes. Make the Delmarva mix if you can, from good seasonings. I think it is much better than the Old Bay. I accidentally "lost" a set in my freezer and when I found them a couple of months later and made them, they were still superb. Squeeze them very dry and be sparing on the mayo. Otherwise it is perfect as is.

The crab cakes were very simple and delicious. I did not make the tartar sauce listed here but instead used the Creamy Horseradish Sauce elsewhere on this site. The only things I changed to the crab cakes were to make them smaller than suggested. This was because I wasn't sure how well my guests would embrace seafood. I think I got 12 smaller cakes out of this recipe. I also used Old Bay seasoning. None were left at the end of Christmas Dinner.

Rating: 4
On the advice of other users, I made sure to squeeze out the liquid from the crab meat. I also used two eggs instead of one and I used more than 1/3 C of crumbs to coat the outside of the cakes. I didn't have Old Bay so I just used a different seafood seasoning mix and it still came out great. The tartar sauce came out extremely salty, so I'd definitely recommend using 1/2 or even a 1/4 tsp of anchovy paste. Overall, everyone loved the cakes. Even my East Coast friend said they were the best she's ever had!

Rating: 3
Delicious and read the review about liquid in the can so made sure the crabmeat was as dry as possible. I also put the crab cakes in the refrigerator for a few hours before cooking and I think that helps keep them together. I did not have the Delmarva or Old Bay seasoning and used 1/2 tsp Beau Monde. I will make the Delmarva next time and also not a huge mayonnaise fan so I split the mayo with plain yogurt in the tartar sauce. Great combo - capers and cucumber.

Rating: 4
I have made these on several occasions and recently suffered a falling-apart-cake problem . I later realized that I did not carefully drain the liquid out of the crab meat container. Most containers don't have much liquid, I guess, but this one did and it was a cake killer. Learn from my mistake: watch how wet your meat is to get the consistency right! Otherwise, this recipe is terrific. We have friends who beg to come to our house to eat these.

This is a great crab cake recipe. I didn't have bread crumbs and used crushed Ritz crackers instead (a cup instead of the 1/2 cup bread crumbs) and it still came out well. The tartar sauce is fabulous as well although I think that the amounts could be halved. We had a ton left over!

Rating: 3
The crab cake recipe is very good, and is similar to but not better than one I have been using (add minced jalapeno, seasoned cracker crumbs and more egg, and dredge in panko). However, the DelMarVa Seasoning is excellent, and I will use it instead of Old Bay in my other crab cake recipe. I also liked the Tartar Sauce, but not with the crab cakes, which didn't really need it, but I will use it for other fried fish and oyster dishes. It's a refreshing alternative to standard tartar sauce.

I grew up in the VA part of Delmarva. I first downloaded this recipe maybe 10 years ago and have been making these crab cakes ever since. They are superb! Beyond that, the Cucumber Tartar Sauce is the best imaginable. When I serve it, guests rave. It is now the only tartar sauce I ever use. So cool to see that it's still here!

Rating: 4
I currently live in the "Del" part of Delmarva and I find these to be very much like the best local crab cakes or possibly better. They have just enough binder to keep the cake together, but not enough to overpower. I also appreciate the amount of Old Bay (I'm too lazy to mix the Delmarva spice) used. Old Bay is ubiquitous here and often overused in recipes. I don't love the spice like those who grew up here, but have learned it has its place. This recipe has the perfect amount. Fabulous. Made my own breadcrumbs from a stale Italian loaf. Everyone raved.

I had problems with this recipe. First I thought it was too salty (may have been the panko bread crumbs, as the Progresso version of panko includes salt. I also had trouble frying them on high--mine burned a little after 1 minute per side; never made it to 3 minutes. I will try again but either in the oven or fry at medium high instead of high.

These are great crab cakes. Lots of crab, not too much breading and very nice seasoning. I cooked them in a little olive oil and butter. They don't need a 1/2 inch of oil to cook properly. I wasn't as happy with the tartar sauce. I found it a little one-note. It didn't really add anything to the cakes. I will look for a sauce that is a little sweeter or spicier.

I thought there were really easy, fast and delicious. I used canned crab meat as well and it worked perfectly. I did not fry these in that much oil. I just put a Tbs or so in and cooked for maybe 4 or 5 minutes. They still got golden brown and crispy but less oil and fat. I also put these in the fridge/freezer to ensure they stayed together. I don't think you could find a better recipe.

Awesome crab cakes! I have made these several times to rave reviews. I use 3 cans of lump crab meat in place of fresh and they always turn out great. What sets this recipe apart from other crab cakes I've tried is that you mostly taste the crab, not the bread crumbs! Really delicious... everyone loves them and always asks for the recipe. The only thing I do differently is to add a couple tbsp. of finely diced red bell pepper. Other than that, I follow it exactly. Also, the cucumber tartar sauce is a wonderful compliment to these crabby little delights! Thanks for a FANTASTIC recipe!

These have become a beloved standard at our house. They tend to fall apart and so I add an extra egg, bread them with panko, then freeze them. Once forzen I put them in hot oil and they cook beautifully. Stored in the freezer they become an impromptu dinner that everyone likes. The canned crab from Costco makes them affordable, and wonderful. I don't like the cucumber tartar but suggest the sundried tomato Louis dressing on this website.

Rating: 3
Oh So Good! Did not have panko so made and dried my bread crumbs. I added much more Old Bay - probably 1.5 teaspoons and a giant tablespoon of Dijon mustard. They fry quickly so pay attention. I made the cucumber tartar sauce and added chopped fresh dill which I think greatly improved the taste. Add the dill right before you serve the sauce. These are so easy to make plus they do better if they are chilled before frying or baking making them a great do ahead for company. These are the authentic crab cakes you find on the Eastern Shore. Do give them a try!!

I adore these crabcakes! I only use Panko breadcrumbs, and I bake the cakes instead of frying them. They are delicious, satisfying, (relatively) healthy if you bake them, and easy to prepare ahead of time. I think the tartar sauce is worth the effort, as is making the true DelMarVa spice blend--it's much more subtle and complex than Old Bay.

I made this for my daughter's birthday dinner. Crab cakes are her favorite so she has tasted them at many restaurants. She claims this recipe creates crab cakes as they are supposed to be. I served them with chipotle aioli. I used panko, (as suggested by other reviewers), a bit more mustard, a little lemon juice, a bit more old bay, and a few tablespoons of very finely diced red onion (since I forgot to buy scallions). I was a little worried about the outcome since I never make fried food, but the recipe directions were clear and this took very little time. It is a homey, but expensive dish.

I have made this recipe three times now, accompanied by various sauces, and always to glowing reviews. I, too, used Panko bread crumbs, both for the mixture and the coating before frying, and I highly recommend it. The Delmarva seasoning looks really good, although I saved a step and used Old Bay instead. Can't imagine this made a big difference in the final result. VERY IMPORTANT: The recommended three minute frying time on each side produced perfect brown and crisp crab cakes. I've used both fresh crab meat while visiting in Maryland, as well as the one pound size lump crab meat available at Sams Club, and could not tell any difference in flavor or texture at all. This recipe certainly makes for a great appetizer, although next time I'll make more and use as the main course. Awesome!

the consensus in our house was that these are among the best crab cakes we ever ate--and I'm from Maryland so my standards are REALLY high. They're certainly the best i ever cooked myself. The Panko bread crumbs are a revelation. I made the creamy chili sauce from another recipe and it was great.

We've been making these crab cakes for years and it is, without doubt, the most requested recipe ever. Using Panko makes them PERFECT. The Delmarva (Delaware, Maryland and Virginia)seasoning is perfect too. Don't skip the cucumber tartar sauce - it's a little extra work, but the ideal compliment to these FABULOUS (better than any restaurant) crab cakes. Served with a chardonnay from the carneros region of California and you've got heavan on earth!!

I was raised on Chesapeake Bay crab cakes and was delighted to find this wonderful recipe. I particularly like the Delmarva seasoning and find it much more flavorful than the Old Bay that I had been using for years. I serve the crab cakes on a bed of lightly dressed mesclun or spring greens and have used the cucumber tarter sauce as well as a basil aioli and both work well. This is definitely a "company dinner" and a keeper in our home.

Great unadulterated, well-seasoned crab flavor! This is my second year of making these for a big party. I use the 1-lb. cans of Phillips crab from Costco and form the mixture into small (1-1/2") cakes using a small scoop (it helps to pack it rather tightly into the scoop), flatten slightly and refrigerate for a few hours. Then I roll in Panko bread crumbs just before frying. After frying, I place them onto paper towel-lined pans and freeze them individually. Once frozen, they can be placed into Ziploc bags until party time. Place the frozen cakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment and heat in a 375° or 400° oven until hot. We serve it with a chipotle aioli (use a squeeze bottle for fast application). I made a 4X recipe which yielded almost 120 cakes, so a single recipe should yield 25-30 small cakes. Delicious and one of most popular items served at our party!

We love this dish - so good in the summer. I serve on a bed of mixed greens with some vine ripe tomatoes and radishes. I use canola oil rather then vege oil because it's heathier to fry with - be careful to get all the cartilage out of the lump crab - many fish markets will sell it that way - saves you some time and hassle. Highly recommeded...

Outstanding crab cakes and the perfect recipe: easy, flavorful, and aesthetically pleasing! They truly showcase the crab meat, and the additional ingredients emphasize the taste and texture of the crab, rather than serving as filler.

I am a professional chef who for many years lived in Delmarva, now 30 years removed. The recipe is outstanding, especially if you refrigerate the cakes before frying. ' I did make two changes the second time these were made. I added finely diced red bell pepper, and for accomodation to New Mexican taste and added depth of flavor, I used 1/2 tsp finely diced NM red chile for each two servings. Thx for the refresher on crab cakes. The sauce is very good when you add a bit of green chile to the mixture.

This is a great quick-and-easy recipe for crab cakes, although I cheat by using a small amt of Old Bay instead of the Delmarva spice. I serve these with the spicy aioli sauce found on this web site (cruncy fried shimp w/aioli)-- but will make the cucumber sauce next time based on the rave reviews. For a light but very elegant crab cake that expoits the pure taste of lump crabmeat from our local blue crabs, try the crab cake with bell pepper recipe that's on this web site. I've been making that one for years, and I sprinkle the cakes with a pinch of sweet paprika and then bake them in a 325 oven for about 15 min instead of frying them. People really rave about them.

Have made this three times now, the most recent for a large catering job. People raved, and inhaled them before the other hors d'oeuvres were 1/4 gone! The Delmarva is a must - if you use Old Bay you might as well be making any old crab cake. We've always used canned crab - the 1-lb cans at Costco are a great buy,and yield a crab cake virtually indistinguishable from the twice-as-expensive (at least!) crabmeat from the fish market. People do tend to pass on the sauce unless you tell them it's "not just tartar sauce" - I guess tartar sauce has a bad rep as the gunk on Fishwiches. Use scant 1/4 cupfuls for hors d'oeuvres, coated in panko, they fry up beautifully. Try these - you won't be sorry!

Great recipe. I "lightened" it a bit using reduced-fat mayo and reducing the oil substantially (about 3 tbls.) in a non-stick pan over hight heat which browned the cakes nicely. I made the delmarva seasoning (unable to find "Old Bay") which was wonderful. In a pinch you can use 3 cans canned lump crabmeat and use regular tartar sauce to accompany with lemon wedges. This one is a definite keeper.

I made this dish for a friend's birthday, and it turned out wonderfully. And it was remarkably easy to make. I served it on a bed of mesclun greens with a miso-ginger dressing, which gave it a lovely flavor and a bit of bite. The cucumber tartar sauce did not sound very appealing to me, but we tried it anyway and it turned out to be the best part of the dish! I am already planning on making it again -- definitely try it yourself! P.S. I just tried this recipe again, with a slight difference -- I used fresh salmon in place of crab! It was a big money saver ($12 less), and the flavor was amazing. Just cut the salmon in very small pieces. Another variation: replace the mayonnaise (in the crab/salmon mixture) with softened cream cheese.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! The cakes were moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside, with no taste of breadcrumb filler.

As a Virginian with a connection to the Eastern Shore, I know a good crab recipe. This is one of the two best crab cake recipes that I have had IF you use the Delmarva seasoning. Patties form well and fry great unlike so many recipes that have a looser, wetter composition -- yet these cakes are moist when cooked. The cucumber sauce makes it even more unique. Would make great crab balls for hors d' oeuvre. This is a keeper recipe for me.

I used Alaska King Crab and flaked the pieces. When I make it again the King Crab Meat should be chopped. The stringy crab becomes brittle on the exterior of the cake, and I feel that choped crab meat will eliminate this problem.
