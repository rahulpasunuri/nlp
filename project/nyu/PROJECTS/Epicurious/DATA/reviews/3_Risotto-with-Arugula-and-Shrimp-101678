Also good with chopped scallops.

Very pretty, delicious and fresh tasting. I agree you can't really taste the arugula per se, (even adding it at the end), but it must "work behind the scene" and add some depth of flavor. But it is still worth making - the flavor was wonderful.

Arugula is amazing raw. Cooking it only dilutes the nuttinees, the zing that makes it so delicious. Don't waste risotto or arugula on this.

This dish was excellent! My husband and I loved the flavor of the arugula, parsley, lemon and garlic. I agree w/one reviewer who suggested to wait until the last few minutes to add the arugula pesto. I think that way no flavors were lost. We also topped it with a little freshly grated parmiggiano- reggiano and freshly cracked black pepper. Definitely worth the try! And, if you have a Trader Joe's near you, I believe they sell bags of arugula that aren't too pricey.

A nice spring dish, very fresh. Would make a nice appetizer. Don't be shy with the flavorings, esp. the lemon, garlic, and parsley.

Excellent risotto and beautiful too. I think this recipe serves more than 6 adults for a main course. More like 8. No complaints however as I am looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

We enjoyed this dish. Though arugula is a very spicy green, cooking it makes it much milder. I will probably add more arugula next time. Nevertheless, the first, according to the recipe preparation, pleased both my husband and me.

Oregonmaan back with a follow up. I ended up just tossing in chopped arugula and cheese at the last second off the heat. You really do have to have quite a bit of arugula to taste it. Not sure what amount I put in since I made it for about 25 people. Arugula has such a great flavor, don't be afraid of it!

I have not made this YET, but going to this weekend for about 25 people. I was going to do a shrimp and ??? risotto and thought this sounded good but after reading all 14 reviews maybe the way to get the true arugula flavor is put the arugula puree in at the very end and off the heat. Usually will end up with a more aromatic result. I will post back with feedback. Hope this helps.

I have made this dish numerous times and it is always wonderful. On a funny note, I made it once in Italy (Trieste) and as I attempted to locate clam juice (without the clams), was told, "it doesn't exist."

I always follow a recipe carefully the first time, as I did with this one. It was really quite wonderful, however VERY green! You might consider re-naming it the HULK Risotto! I will cook it again with only the addition of red pepper flakes. I did not add salt, I think the clam juice was enough. I did use the shrimp shells and made a fish broth, so the liquid was broken up into thirds. Next time I will not pair it with a salad as the whole meal was GREEN. I would suggest a tomato salad....with basil and mozzerella. A crusty bread and you have a devine meal!

I thought this recipe was fabulous. It does require some skill in the kitchen--namely a familiarity with risotto preparations--in order for it to turn out well. I substituted leeks for onions (always great) and upped the amount of lemon peel, which added a tangy flavor. Get the highest quality shrimp you can. Top with a bit of fresh romano or parmesean shavings. Lovely and with a very unusual flavor, reminded me of my travels through Italy. Everyone I served it to loved it and wanted the recipe. Worth the effort. I might attempt it again with the addition of asparagus (always welcome in risotto).

I thought this was really tasty, although the arugula taste isn't as strong as you'd expect for the quantity used. I also used a combo of shrimp and scallops, and cooked them separately and briefly in a saute pan, then added them before serving, to prevent overcooking.

Although it was pretty good, I agree with the last person that it seemed to be a waste of great arugula (which isn't easy to come by) I followed the recipe, except that I made my own stock by simmering the shrimp shells that I have been hoarding in the freezer, the stock was great. Also I made the mistake of putting the used shrimp castings down the garbage disposal and clogged the disposal really serious. Much to my husbands chagrin, since it is his job to fix it. Since this is the second time I have done this with shrimp castings he wasn't too happy about it. I think that I prefer arugula uncooked, and I have some great risotto recipes that I would rather serve. But try it you might like it.

Disappointing and a waste of good arugula. If you want shrimp risotto, make shrimp risotto and leave the arugula for a better purpose. It was pretty bland and none of the quirky "bite" of arugula came through.

What a huge disappointment! After reading the reviews, I expected this dish to be great. Both my husband and I found it extremely bland. I shouldn't complain though, this is the first time I have been disappointed with a highly rated recipe from epicurious.

This turned out far better (and greener) than I had expected. Substitutions/additions that worked for me: arugula and spinach... scallops and shrimp... less clam juice, but regretted it... leeks instead of onions.

Really, really good. Recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious. I like to add a few fresh cherry tomatoes at the very end to really enhance the green color. My family enjoys this every time I make it. Even those who don't think they like arugula enjoy this meal, and Peter(reference below), why do the Brit's call a truck a lorry or cookies biscuits? It's OK. Think how much more interesting our meals have become because we have communicated with other cultures. We don't have to all call it the same thing to understand one another.

We loved the arugula taste in this risotto recipe. I ended up adding some esparagus (steamed and cut in small pieces, a little bit of cream, I halved the shrimp, and added some lobster meat, and also added a couple of roma tomatoes, and I also had a little bit of shaved parmessan at the table for sprinkling on top. I realize that I ventured off the recipe quite a bit, but it was fun adding all of this good stuff. And it turned out delicious, my fiance raved about it!
