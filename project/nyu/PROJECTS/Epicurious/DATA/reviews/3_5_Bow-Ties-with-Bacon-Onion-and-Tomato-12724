I'm surprised to hear that some cooks regard this as taking a bit of time as to me this is simplicity itself. I usually have some bacon, a tomato and an onion around so this is my go-to recipe when I don't have any other ideas, and it never fails to please. A great comfort food dish that I find totally addictive.

Love this recipe. I've also found that it works well with Canadian bacon and whole wheat pasta, for those looking to healthify it.

I'm not sure what got the other reviewers so excited. This is nothing special. My husband commented that he thought it might be better with fresh pasta, but I don't think I would waste the effort. It did make three servings for us.

My wife and I really enjoyed this. It was very fresh and enjoyable for a great "weeknight meal", as an earlier commenter had called it. Prep was very was easy and took us about 20 minutes. We actually substituted the bacon for honey garlic rosemary sausage which worked very well.

I admit I was skeptical about this recipe, but the ingredients really came together nicely at the end. I doubled the recipe, and used a mixture of halved grape tomatoes and canned diced tomatoes. Really easy and tasty!

This is great with fresh red, green and yellow peppers sauteed in it. Excellent!!!!

This was an easy, very tasty weeknight dish. The recipe says that it serves 2 - my husband and I ate, were satisfied, and had leftovers (enough for one of us to have for lunch). Next time, I will add more parsley and red pepper flakes.

After reading some of the reviews and looking in my fridge, I altered this recipe quite a bit. I cooked the bacon whole because I think it tastes better chopped afterwards, used green instead of cooking onion and a little red wine instead of water. Also I don't care for farfalle so I used fusilli and didn't have parsley so from a bumper crop of fresh basil in my garden and a big grind of black pepper... It was dead easy, very quick and delicious. I recommend this for a Friday night when all you want to do is shut the door, pour a glass of wine and turn off the world. I bet it would also be good the next day with a little olive oil and balsamic.

Add a little basil and it's pretty much pasta arrabiata. This is a great recipe, I agree with the cook who added more bacon!!

I added extra bacon, a bit of garlic, some white wine, and about a cup of cherry tomatoes, and even kicked it up a few notches, and still found it pretty boring. For the amount of time it took to make this...with cooking the bacon and all, I wanted a greater taste. Compared to other pasta dishes I have found on this site, this one wasn't great.

This recipe was very good. I used some extra bacon and onion. It is a light and satisfying dish and easy to make. I agree with the other cook~the leftovers are yummy too.

The flavors in this recipe are excellent - especially for something so quick and easy. I make this all the time and it is just as good leftover.

I have to agree with all the other reviewers - this dish is very good. Such a surprise since the ingredients are so basic but the flavors really melted together nicely. I doubled the recipe and added a little more bacon but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely be repeating this one.

I used an all natural smoked bacon in this and I think it made all the difference. My family loved it, although I think I'll reduce the amount of wine and add a few drops of honey to balance the sauce out a bit more next time. It was even better the next day.

Very simple and really good. Increased the amount of red pepper flakes to kick it up a bit, and added black olives and mushrooms, and ended up cutting the parmesan in half b/c I didn't have enough, but was really good anyway.

This recipe was so simple and so good! It was very easy to make, which is perfect for someone with as busy a schedule as myself. I am definitely making this one again.

What a success!!! So simple and flavorful!!! I added yellow & green peppers for color, along with some other veggies in the fridge that needed using up - and it was a delight! I took the advice to add less red pepper flakes - a few pinches gave it just the right kick!

Have made this recipe several times in a variety of ways and it has been excellent every time. Try adding garlic before you add the tomatoes. Also great without the cheese.

This was such a simple and wonderful recipe!!!!! Very easy meal for a weeknight. Added more bacon and halved the onion and it was perfect!!!! Great dish for a relaxing evening at home!!!!

This was delicious and very easy to make. I used turkey bacon though so maybe it would have been 4 forks with the real thing.

I made this for the second time tonight, and definitely got it right this time! The first time I was a little too free with the red pepper flakes. I liked it, but it was way too hot for my wife, and in truth, the pepper overwhelmed the dish. This time I used the barest pinch, and it was perfect. Remarkably subtle flavors for such a simple dish. I HAD to add some garlic, though, cooked with the onions. It just seemed to cry out for it!

I made this for dinner when I had'nt gone to the market and had a limited amount of ingredients in the house to make anything else. I used orrechiette tris instead of farfalle and it came out just as wonderful. My roomate and I loved it.

What a surprise! I made it because it looked easy and we had a box of bow-tie pasta that we wanted to get rid of. When I read the recipe and saw the simple ingredients I didn't realize that it would have such a complex flavor. It's a wonderful dish and will become a regular at our house.

Soooooo incredibly delicious! I will definetly be making this again! Before serving pour a little olive oil over the farfalle...then sit back and enjoy.

This dish is incredibly easy and has been a hit every time I've made it. The second time I made it I cut back to just 1/2 an onion, because I felt a whole onion overpowered the other flavors in the dish.

This recipe is so easy and very flavorable. I added a bagged salad and a viniagrette dressing, some garlic bread. My family loved it!

Yummy! I cannot wait to eat the leftovers today. Substituted about 3/4 cup of chopped pancetta for the bacon, chopped four plum tomatoes (could have done more), and used a sweet red cooking wine instead of the water. Next time, I'll quickly add some spinach with the parmesan and see how that goes. This recipe is a winner. I agree that it's a great weeknight meal. My husband loved it, and so did I!

This is an easy pasta recipe that provides a nice break from your typical tomato or cream based sauces. While not very "health conscious," I use most if not all of the bacon grease, and cut back on the oil. Works well as a side dish, too.

Delicious! I added more red pepper flakes to make the dish a little more spicy and took the suggestion to add more bacon. My husband and I loved it! This makes a great weekend night dinner because it is so easy.

My finacee is a big eater (he must have meat for dinner) and he LOVED this one. I liked it quite a bit too! My only complanit is that it was abit messy (I hate using more than one pan to cook) but I guess if you made the bacon ahead of time and saved it in the fridge this recipe would be no-sweat to prepare. P.S. I also used quite a bit more bacon than just 4 slices........

Even after reading most of the reviews, this dish was a huge surprise! We loved it. My husband is still raving three days later. I made it with pancetta and used the long fusilli instead of bow ties.

Usually when I make pasta, I just cook up a simple red sauce. I tried this for a change of pace (and to use up some leftover bacon), and my boyfriend and I loved it. I added a little more bacon than the recipe called for, but otherwise didn't change anything.

I added the Vermouth to this recipe as someone suggested, but will probably omit it next time. When the dish was first done, I wasn't sure about the combination of flavors, but everything tasted very different after it had a few hours to cool and meld together. I definitely recommend making this one in advance!

We love this recipe, and I've made it many times since the recipe first appeared in my September 1993 issue. On occasion I've substituted corkscrew pasta for the farfalle, but otherwise change nothing.

My family loves this one. It's simple to make...I make it just as the recipe reads. We've even served it to casual last-minute guests with crusty bread and white wine and it was a hit.

This dish was fast and easy to make. I normally don't cook, and often don't cook well so I was really surprised at how user friendly this recipe turned out to be. It didn't taste extreemly good, but it was still yummy nonetheless.

I used white wine instead of the vermouth or water and it was great. Next time I'd add more of the three main ingredients though - I like just a bit more sauce than this gave me.

Sorry... made it with the vermouth AND the garlic and it was just okay. Doubled it for serving for four and my family found it just "okay".

I liked this one. The bacon makes it more interesting of a dish. As with almost everything I cook, I added a clove or two of garlic.
