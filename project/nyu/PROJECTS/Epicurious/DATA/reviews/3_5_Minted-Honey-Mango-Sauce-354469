Wow! This is by far my favorite new dessert! I poured this over vanilla ice cream and it was amazing! I added twice as much mint as it called for and it was delicious. Note: I live in Costa Rica where the mangos are ridiculously juicy...very ripe mangos may be the trick here.

I was looking forward to a mango SAUCE to put on icecream. This is more like a fruit topping,and it was pretty un-inspired. I would have just chopped up mangos, and put some mint on my icecream to get the exact same flavor.

This goes amazing with vanilla ice cream! It's has an interesting flavor, and is very unique, but still delicious! I'll definitely be making this again!
