Easy and yummy in the tummy. I skipped the ketchup/added onions and they turned out great!

This is not for wimps! The men at our tailgate loved these.

I thought these were pretty fantastic albeit not exactly health food. :) I found that one piece of bacon per sausage wasn't enough but two was enough to ensure adequate coverage of the split part of the sausage. Also, would be good for the recipe to suggest starting grilling on the split side, then going each side of the split and finishing on the bottom underneath the split. That way you are minimizing the amount of cheesy loss from the split. Also making extra of the sauerkraut mix is a good idea for the table.

Loved this recipe!! I left out the cheese but the kraut and the bacon were amazing. Next time I'm thinking of using chili, onions and cheese.
