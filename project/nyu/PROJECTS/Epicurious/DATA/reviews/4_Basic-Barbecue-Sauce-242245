surprisingly easy...and surprisingly I had all of the ingredients except for molasses so I subbed with honey, and no bell pepper so used a fresh jalapeño instead. really nice layers of flavor.

A good basic recipe with the added benefit of fresh veggies (every little bit helps!). It doesn't make much so I might double it next time to have leftovers. I accidentally added a ton of hot sauce but it still wasn't too spicy for me. With a bit more vinegar it would be perfect for ribs.

Good recipe. Used for pulled pork. Not very thick. Substituted some ingredients but mostly kept the same. I doubled the recipe

This is the so yummy! I made it twice within a couple of days. I will probably make it all summer. Super easy!

Delicious. I made this sauce for a BBQ seitan recipe and used a bit more onion than called for (vidalia). Once I mixed it all, I added a bit more liquid smoke and sugar to add additional flavor to the seitan. More fun than buying a bottle of Kraft, for certain.

Tasted excellent. Had to reduce it for about 30 minutes to get the consistency I wanted (thick, to put it on pizza) ... would decrease the water next time if that's what I'm using it for. Otherwise perfect!

Love it. So easy to adapt with other ingredients or just perfect as it is. Thanks epicurious.

A very tangy, basic sauce that is quick to make and easily adaptable. I used a yellow pepper, Heinz chili sauce in place of the tomato sauce, and used a smidge of leftover bacon fat. It's simmering now and I will likely puree it a bit as suggested by a previous reviewer. This will be a great sauce for our pulled chicken sandwiches tonight.

Excellent recipe tht lends itself to adaptation I didn't have tomato sauce - used cocktail sauce with lots of horseradish and some tomato paste - nice zing Didn't have garlic - used shallot Didn't have brown sugar - used turbinado sucar and a little more molassas Will definitely make this again but still feel free to adapt

This was great, especially for a first attempt at making BBQ sauce :) I was pleasantly surprised by the results. I actually ran the sauce through the blender just before the simmering stage to remove all chunks of onions (I like a smooth sauce). I used quite a bit of smoky chipotle sauce and used real bacon grease. The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars is that I prefer a sweeter, thicker sauce, like KC Masterpiece. I think it needs more brown sugar ;)
