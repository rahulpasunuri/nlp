Great recipe; my fiance loved it. Crisped perfectly and so much better than spending an hour over a frying pan, both from a time and health perspective. I modified the recipe slightly, after reading the reviews, by adding some minced garlic to the butter mixture, dashing in a bit more cayenne, and adding some herbs to the bread crumb mixture.

Tasty, but kinda too greasy and messy. I made this for a herd of doods to eat during their fantasy football draft... cheesy, buttery crumbs got EVERYwhere. This would be better for an outdoor meal IMO. That said, everyone liked them. It was good on drums, too.

I use boneless tenderloins instead of wings and it works really well. It's my boyfriend's favorite meal.

My 5 year old son loved these wings, but my husband and I thought they needed something - had some garlicky marinara style dipping sauce which I made frozen. Thawed it out quickly and it did the trick. Mext time I'll make a dipping sauce to serve these with right away. Highly recommend the sweet chili glazed wings - also on this site. I've been making those since the recipe first appeared in 1997

I made this recipe for a Christmas appetizer and thought the mustard/parmesan combination to a little off. Also, the did not come out crispy.

We added our favorite BBQ sauce and put them in the over again then served them with blue cheese dressing. My husband said they arent wings without BBQ sauce. We were told they were the BEST wings some had ever had. so i guess the mustard and parm went well with the BBQ and blue cheese. Either way .. they were a huge hit and i will definatley make them again.

These are great!!! I put in about half the mustard bc I am not a huge mustard fan. They were crispy and delicious and an enormous hit with my Super Bowl guests. I'm going to try this coating on chicken pieces. Note that I cooked my wings in a convection oven at 400 and they were fully done after 20 minutes. This was so even though my wings were on the larger side (I purchased the Whole Foods "drumettes" -- the best part of the wing with no effort!).

I made two "flavors" of wings for my last football bash: these and the Sweet Chili-Glazed Chicken Wings. Half my guests loved these best, while the other half raved about the glazed wings. I think both are winners. I didn't change a thing in this recipe, and they came out crunchy and delicious. Do turn them during baking, though; it helps them crisp evenly.

Made these again last night and they are still great! I like to use a combination of olive oil with a bit of butter for flavor without so much bad fat. I like to add any number of different dry spices to the bread crumbs. I might add that I put them in the oven on a broiler pan so excess fat can drain away. I find this makes for a crisp wing that drier on the outside but is still juicy inside. Take care in turning them at the 20 minute mark so you don't lose the coating.

Really good! My Husband especially loved these. we did turn them while cooking and thought a little longer cooking yielded a much tastier, saltier wing. The mustard flavor was very subtle.

Fantabulous! Try it with bonless chicken breasts, cut into strips.... perfect every time.

Been making this since recipe first appeared in magazine. For 20 whole chx wings, I use 1.5 T the butter mix and nearly 3T the crumbs. They are FABULOUS every time -- rich but crisp and delightful. A Super-Bowl Day Standard for more than a decade.

I thought that this recipe had a great premise, but it was way to greasy for my taste. I made it exactly as it was stated and my daughter liked it, she is two, my husband did not care one way or the other. But, my neighbor and I both thought that it was way to greasy for our liking.

I make this dish constantly. The coating is too rich for wings, so I use legs, thighs and breasts. In the summer we often eat it at room temperature. I've served it at many large gatherings. Everyone seems to love it and I get many requests for the recipe (which I ALWAYS share).

Substituted Pecorino for the Parmesean - AWESOME FLAVOR!

I went the chicken-tender route, and wound up substituting Gruyere cheese instead of Parmesan - wow! The Gruyere really added a really nice tang. Tasty and easy!

SOOOO GOOOOOD! Has been for 10 years now. Company won't be disappointed. Consider using chicken breasts, cook in 9x13 baking dish and serve with rice (scoop the drippings over the rice) line the pan w/ thin sliced potatoes before adding the coated chicken

Made this yesterday for a SuperBowl party. It was the second time I had made it. All my guests, young and old, loved them...and couldn't get enough. My only complaint is that they are very greasy (a bit too much for my taste).

My young kids loved this recipe but the floor was incredibly messy when it was over. Next time I think we will try chicken breasts or tenders. It was indded good.

These were excellent. Changes due to what I had on hand were: 5 Spice Chinese seasoning instead of cumin and 1/2 cup corn meal with 1/2 cup bread crumbs in lieu of all bread crumbs. It was excellent. I baked 20 mins and then turned them for another 20. Will make these again the same way!!!

I dont make it with chicken wings...I use Chicken Breasts cut into strips and bake them.......its also very lovely with an apricot jelly/dijon dipping sauce.

simple and delicious, easy to make, I do several batches at a time then freeze the wings in the marinade, and thaw them overnight, cook as usual.

some more verve is required.

Not very interesting, the broiling negates the dijon flavor . Ends up like a whimpy buffalo wing.
