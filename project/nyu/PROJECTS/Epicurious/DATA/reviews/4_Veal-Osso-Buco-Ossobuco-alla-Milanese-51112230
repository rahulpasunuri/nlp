Perfect for a winters eve. I used a Dutch oven which reduced cooking time by 20 minutes. Also prepared the Gremolata with a clove of garlic and minced the lemon, parsley, and garlic into a fine Italian pixy dust. When the Gremolata hits the warm Osso Bucco at serving time it creates a wonderful complex amroma. I used Vermouth for the dry white wine. Side was rustic mashed potatoes to absorb the tomato sauce. Rich and filling meal, a little goes a long way. Leftover sauce will be used in a pasta dish. As my niece says "Veal is proof God loves us".
