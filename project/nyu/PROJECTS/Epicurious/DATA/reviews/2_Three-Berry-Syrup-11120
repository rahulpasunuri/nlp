Really no work at all (sorry previous reviewer) but really not worth it. Didn't thicken up and nothing special at all. Will not make again.

There's some work here....but worth it. I also use a syrup like Ms. Butterworth's, heat and add cranberries and orange zest. When the cranberries burst, pour over pancakes. You can strain it as well, but I like the fruit.
