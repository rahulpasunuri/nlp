With inspiration from other reviewers... I added one minced garlic clove and diced tomatoes to the shallots and butter. Used a little less butter and added a little white wine. Added basil at the end and turned off the heat. Also seasoned the fish with s/p and a tiny bit of cumin before grilling. Served with sauteed spinach and lentils. Really tasty and my husband loved it.

I only added half a cube of butter (seemed like enough) So I could have totally messed up the recipe....but this was just way too strong of a flavor for fresh halibut. I'm SO a basil lover but I will only use this recipe on stinky old fish that a person doesn't want to taste.

Okay, after reading all the reviews I thought I would change it up a bit. I made the butter the way it asked but added more shallots (2 large) blended those with the basil and butter but added olive oil to the blender. I rubbed the halibut with olive oil first then seasoned with salt, pepper and some of my Victorian Epicure Selection Herb and Garlic Dip mix, just dusting it lightly. Also added some fresh parsley and bit of brown sugar. I let this sit for 2 hours in the fridge. Cooked on the grill accordingly to size then topped with the basil butter......OMG, thought I was eating at a 5 Star restaurant. The fish was bursting with flavor, really tasting the grated lemon but with a hint of sweet garlic. Will serve again for sure!

Overall taste was a bit bland, but it was easy to prepare and went over fairly well with picky children given the "green butter".

Eeeeh. This was OK. Barely. I read the other reviews and took into consideration the lack of direction to season your fish. Did that. Still did not make a big difference. The butter was flavorful but not enough to entice me to make this again. Halibut is an expensive fish to buy so don't waste your moola on this recipe.. :(

After using this butter for a family get together and having everyone rave including kids who don't like green stuff or fish - I couldn't wait to see what reviewers used it on, etc. When reading the reviews I realized I had made it once before and felt the same one fork way as others. With the kids help making it I realized that I had used a gigantic double shallot and they loved pulling the basil leaves from our garden off so much that I ended up with a tightly packed 1 1/2 cups. They also generously seasoned with salt which I may have forgotten to use the last time. We had a good dessert and grilled corn on the cob and they all voted the fish as their favorite. I'm so glad I'd forgotten the greasy mess on the first go around.

I wish I could choose negative 1 fork for awful...The fish was very bland and the butter was overwhelming. I couldn't eat more than two or three bites, and I was trying to scrape off as much butter as possible. So, I essentially chose a lightly seasoned piece of fish over the awful butter! I can honestly say that this is the worst recipe I have ever tried from this site.

I did not like this at all. I followed the recipe exactly. It was not what I was expecting at all. It tasted better on the pasta, but overall I couldn't finish my meal.

The butter is really good. Make a bunch and freeze it. I baked the fish instead, it was a good meal.

I baked this without the oil but with the basil butter. I also added diced tomatoes on top and it tasted very yummy!

I've made this twice now for guests and it received raves and recipe requests both times. Great flavor and very easy! I didn't find it too greasy at all, but I didn't use ALL the basil shallot butter.

We have been using the basil butter on corn on the cob. It's delicious used that way.

This recipe was not very flavorful to me. The basil-shallot butter was too bland, and the method of preparing the fish was too bland, too. I would not make this again.

I really though that the butter was too much for this fish. No one in my family asked for seconds, so I know they didn't like it either.

I really did not like the heavy butter on this fish. It was too oily and no one in my family asked for seconds, which is a clear sign that they didn't like it either.

This was divine! I used grilled Mahi fillets. So delicious. The butter would be good on so many things. I had a lot of it leftover and we put it on top of grilled chicken the next night and that was good. It would probably be amazing on top of mashed potatoes. Yum! I could go on and on. Definitley a keeper.

This recipe was amazing!! So delicious and easy. I rarely make thing twice but this will become a regular. I got a fillet with the skin on and pan fried it because I didn't feel like turning on the grill. Turned out perfect. Delicious!
