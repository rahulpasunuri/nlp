This was great. My husband and a friend shot 6 quail last weekend and this recipe really worked well. Since these were hunted desert quail and not fat farmed quail, I got just the breasts without any skin. The bacon wrapping kept the meat moist and the flavors were great. I left out the goat cheese but thought they were still excellent.

Made this last night. Kept them in a bit longer, broiled with the oven door open just a bit at the end. Juicy, tender, salty, savory, creamy, and wonderful. Served it with rosemary roasted red potatoes and sauteed garlicky broccolini. Nice bottle of 2006 Flowers Frances Thompson Vineyard Pinot Noir. It really went perfectly.

This was surprisingly easy and filling. I used rosemary in place of the thyme and extra garlic. I roasted the quail for 25 minutes at 400, then briefly crisped it under the broiler. I got that plan from the package the quail came in and it worked well. I like my poultry well done. Served on a bed a baby greens with couscous. It was a beautiful and impressive meal.

I forgot the rosemary but excellent overall. Served with brown rice with toasted pecans, and steamed asparagus and snow peas. Note: 15 min @ 500 F leaves quail very medium-rare. I did 20 minutes, plus 5 min under broiler to crisp bacon; would actually probably do 25 min + 5 broil next time- I dislike underdone poultry.

NIce marinade for quail, but cooking bacon-topped skin-on quail at 500 degrees produces too much splatter and heat...and an active fire alarm. I'm cleaning my oven today and airing out my h ouse (still) from all the smoke. Not worth the effort!

I used regular bacon (not thick-cut) and marinated for 24 hours. I fit six quail on a sheet and roasted them for 22 minutes. They were beautiful and delicious! One was enough for most people (served w/ rice and sautéed napa cabbage). Very easy to prepare and a very elegant presentation.

The quail was awesome. I used just deboned breast and wrapped the small legs together with the cheese and rosemary with the bacon. Unbelievable flavor. We will definitely do this recipe again.

Absolute perfection. I bbq'ed the quails and they were moist and flavourful. Left the quails for 24 hours and all the flavours blended. Followed the suggestion of putting the bacon in the cavity however the last 5 minutes wrapped it around the birds to crisp. YUM
