I like to add garam masala to my tandoori chicken marinade. I also use for a variation tandoori spice blend from www.indianfoodsco.com. It looks like their blend has some herbs in it - that make my tandoori chicken come out excellent and aromatic.

Marinating in yogurt makes the chicken so tender and so tasty. A keeper - and I cooked it in the oven -no probloem

I made this for Christmas this year, using game hens. Even the kids liked it. My husband has already asked me to make it for our New Years party as well.

Did this on the grill after marinating for only 3 hours. It was absolutely fabulous! I used a combination of breasts and thighs. Folks had 2nds and 3rds!

Just for fun, I threw about a cup of shredded coconut into the marinade and grilled the chicken on the barbeque. It was great!!!

I would have to agree with the disappointed comments about this recipe when done in the oven. I kept closely to the recipe (no meat tenderiser: don't need it with Australian free range chicken)and marinated overnight. I suspect that this recipe (like all Tandoori chicken)is best either in a Tandoori or on a hotplate of some type. Home ovens (at least ours) don't give satisfactory results. However, my parents do a good version in their Weber BBQ, a reasonable alternative. I would recommend against others using this recipe in an oven.

anyone who thinks they can replicate the effects of a tandoor oven at home is a fool. it's like trying to broil a steak at home while a steakhouse's broilers get 10x as hot as your oven's... to the cook from bedford: madhur in general, and especially her restaurant dawat here in manhattan, is quite overrated. sahni's book is superior for a knowledgeable reader who realizes mangos and fish here in the us are not quite the same as those in asia...

To the cook in MA -- did you actually try it? I made a few adaptations, but thought it was pretty close to the real thing. I used paprika and broiled it indoors. Delicious!

It's not that I don't like Tandoori Chicken, I do. Ms. Sahni's recipe is too large, and I have her book. Many of the recipes are made as though the ingredients are Indian ingredients, not American ingredients. As Madhur Jaffrey pointed out in one of her books, our meats and poultry is quite different from that of India -- much less tough, requiring differing amounts of time to cook, different amounts to approximate the same dish.
