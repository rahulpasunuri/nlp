I used raw unsalted pistachios and almonds as well as the full amount of salt listed in the recipe and didn't find it salty at all. I love the idea of using dried blueberries and will try that next time. Also will be adding more cinnamon as I found mine a little bland.

Simple & delicious! I omitted the salt due to the comments of other reviewers, and also substituted raw organic honey for the agave syrup and flax seeds for the sesame seeds. I also opted to use dried blueberries, and it tastes great. Note: I left out the brown sugar (to avoid using a refined sweetener), and it's still very sweet w/ the honey. I recommend leaving it out! I might add a little more cinnamon next time, though.

Please pay no mind to A Cook in Princeton (review from 2/17/2013). The debate about coconut oil was settled long ago- it is one of the healthiest fats you can use. However, there is a debate about agave nectar. After researching this a bit I threw my brand new bottle in the trash. I substituted maple syrup, and used a little less, just because I always try to reduce sugar amounts. I added about 1/4 cup flax seed meal, and completely forgot the salt. It was still very tasty, but I may add a little next time. I will be making this a lot. It's so easy and healthier than most any granola you can buy. Cheaper too. And I recommend Bob's Red Mill unsweetened organic flaked coconut. A steal on Amazon.

I cut out the coconut as the oil is being debated as a possible cholesterol trigger. Used 3/4 of the brown sugar, added some flax seed, steel cut oats instead of oatmeal (ran out...) and cooked it a bit longer as a result. No agave in response to recent health reports on that ingredient used honey. Did not add any salt, as with other reviews this is way too salty...Came out better than the original recipe in my humble opinion!

Great recipe. I love being able to adjust the granola to fit my taste and be a bit healthier! Like other reviewers, I found the original way too salty - even though I love salt! I adjusted to 1/4 tsp and it was much better.

My kids love this granola. I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, double the cinnamon and use flax seed instead of sesame.

I made this and agree that, as written, it was too salty. I ate it anyway with my yogurt. I made another batch today and cut the salt in half and doubled the cinnamon. Much better. This is definitely a keeper.

I agree with other reviewers - too salty! I should have trusted my own judgement when measuring and halved the amount. Otherwise this is a pretty solid recipe. The egg white does add a nice crunch.

This was outstanding! I skipped the coconut shavings and sesame seeds, but did use the coconut oil. I used pistachios and sliced almonds for the nuts. I don't understand the reviews that say it's too salty - they must have used salted nuts.

Way too salty. I can get it down as a snack, but with milk or yogurt it's gag-worthy. Make it with only 1 tsp. kosher salt, or maybe 3/4.

I found this granola just okay, a little too much salt. The Everyday Granola recipe is much better.

Very tasty and so easy! My only complaint is that the finished product is rather salty. Next time I would reduce the salt to 1tsp or maybe even 1/2 tsp. I also made without coconut and added another 1/2 cup of nuts. Also, the mixture was still a little soft when I removed it from the oven, but it was beautifully browned so I took it out and let it rest in the pan. It crisped up nicely while it cooled!

I LOVE this granola. I crave it.... I didn't use the coconut shavings, I added more that 1 1/2 cups of chopped nuts and didn't use as much brown sugar as suggested. I put it in my yogurt for a snack during the day, I put it with some fruit for a dessert at night. It it tasty!!! One thing I would recommend is to use parchment paper. It shows it in the picture but doesn't list it in the preparation ~ other than that have fun with this :) It makes a lot but if you are like me.... it wont last long!!!
