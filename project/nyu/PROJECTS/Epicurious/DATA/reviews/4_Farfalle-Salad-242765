I made this for a party. I made as listed but used one 3.8 ounce can of sliced black olives. This definitely needs more pesto but would probably be best added just before serving. I forgot to take the salad out of the refrigerator to room temp so it was kind of stuck together.

This is the best pesto/pasta salad I have ever made - the olives made it (I used kalmata) - used a little extra pesto and threw in some toasted pine nuts - yummy!

This was pasta salad heaven! I normally don't eat olives or peas, but made this recipe excactly as specified, and it turned out so well - I ate every olive and pea on the plate! Simple to make too, took me only about 10 minutes, including chopping the veggies. I used pre-shredded parmesean cheese, and sliced black olives. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is surprisingly good, especially with feta cheese. We made a few substitutions -- green beans for the peas, 2 green peppers, and Kalamata olives. Our end result had a lot more vegetables than a traditional pasta salad, and was fresh and delicious!

I LOVE this salad, as does everyone to whom I've served it. It's quick, easy, and even kids will eat it. The only modification I made the first time was leaving out the olives. After that, I cut down on the red onion which was a bit overpowering and I sometimes use chopped fresh mozzarella instead of parmesan. Other than that, it's great as is. All in all, a smart choice for any type of celebration.

Simply a great pasta salad. Made as directed and let it rest for 24 hours. My guest all loved it.

This was very good as a base recipe. I used calamata olives, broccoli, grape tomatoes & scallions. Took the advice from a previous review and added goat cheese. To die for.

The salad was enjoyed by all at a pool party. The pesto is a flavorful alternative to mayonnaise bases, and less prone to spoilage outdoors. The amount of pesto you need will probably depend on the brand. I used a 10-ounce jar of a rich, garlicky supermarket brand that provided a big punch of flavor. Two cups, as suggested by other reviewers, would have been far too much. First timers -- I suggest using 1 cup and having extra on hand to adjust to taste. Instead of adding salt, extra grated parmesan did the trick. I love black olives and roughly chopped them as directed, then noticed some folks picking them out. Next time, will leave them whole so non-lovers can push them aside.

This was excellent and I think very versatile. Like others, I would double the pesto next time and I am sure it would be delicious with chicken or shrimp added in. I forgot to add the olives and it was still wonderful.

This pasta salad is such a people-pleaser. I've made double batches and taken to parties; there is never any left. It is also very versatile. I've added chicken to make it a dinner, and once I threw in leftover Champagne and it was amazing.

This is a great template dish. You can add all kinds of veggies to it. I prefer it without the scallions. And I use homemade spinach-basil pesto, to make it a bit healthier. My husband loves this recipe!

Excellent. I really liked it at the warm stage, though it was still good cold/room temperature. I'm not a big bell-pepper fan, so I used just one red pepper and sautéd it for a few minutes first. I substituted a sautéd zucchini for the second pepper. I also left out the black olives. I used the Classic Pesto recipe from Bon Appétit, sautéing the garlic first.

I used this as more of a guide than a recipe. I substituted in some summer squash and carrots for the peppers. Tasty and easy

Made this for guests last night and everyone raved. Did not use peas or scallions or red onion. Substituted feta cheese for parmesan and it was good! I will make this again...

Delicious and easy: I lightly browned about 1 1/2 cups (3/4#) diced ham in bacon fat and added it to make it more hearty. I forgot to buy scallions so I sweated some diced shallots with the ham and added them instead. I'll make it the same way again.
