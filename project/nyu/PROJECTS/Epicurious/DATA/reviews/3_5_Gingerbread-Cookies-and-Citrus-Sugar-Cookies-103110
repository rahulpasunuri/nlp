The sugar cookies were excellent! Great flavor and texture. The dough was very easy to work with, and did not lose its easy texture even when re-worked and re-rolled. I did not make the gingerbread.

I have been making these gingerbread cookies every year since about 2000 and love them. They are one of our Xmas staples, and my girls -now teens- do all the decorating. The powdered sugar icing is wonderful too. I use another sugar cookie recipe but it's basically the same except without the citrus, so I'm sure this citrus cookie recipe is great too. Happy 2013!!

Great sugar cookie recipe and potentially great Gingerbread cookie IF you double the dry spices and add a bit more milk to make rolling easier. If you do this, both cookies are excellent. I also made the frosting, but thinned it out with milk in order to apply a very very thin coat on both cookies. If you do this, you can cut the frosting recipe drastically..I probably only used 10% of it. I also affixed sliced almonds to the gingerbread. Rave reviews from my adult guests that the cookies weren't too sweet.

The sugar cookies were delicious but not really sturdy enough for the big cookie decorating party we had. Many of them broke in the process. The gingerbread ones held up much better, but they weren't spicy enough for me. I would double the ginger (or do 1 and a half times) next time.

This is my go to sugar cookie for the last 17 years! I made them from the first printing in 1995 and they have never let me down. I get so many requests for them because they are so delicous I think it is the zest. For decorating I put an eggwhite wash over them and sprinkle with coarse colored sugars and bake. When they come out they are already decorated!! Time saver.

I have made the gingerbread cookies a couple of times. They are good, but not our of this world or unusual. The dough is easy to work with which is a real plus. I just finished reading over the reviews. Both recipes have good and bad comments, but they did give me a reason to give the citrus sugar cookies a try. I guess it depends if your looking for an everyday cookie or something that is exceptional.

One more note for anyone needing to make gluten-free cookies. I just did the sugar cookies using 2 cups King Arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (no other changes), and they are DELICIOUS. I would not know that they were gluten-free.

I made the gingerbread dough two days ahead, and now we've made and iced them. They are crisp and delicious, with a lovely ginger flavor. (I added some fresh grated ginger to the batter, too.) These will be an annual tradition for sure. Recipe worked exactly as printed, and the dough was very easy to work with.

This review is for the Sugar Cookies. I have made this recipe several times, and it has always come out delicious. Just don't roll the dough out too thin (keep it just thicker than 1/8 in), and you shouldn't have a problem with breaking. The texture is perfect, and the citrus flavoring is really lovely. Haven't tried the gingerbread, yet...

This is an average sugar cookie. I yielded 20 3" heart cookies from 1 batch. The cookies were about 1/4" thick. The dough is slightly difficult to roll out because of cracking, but can be managed. I did make sure I refrigerated the cut out cookies on the pan before I baked them. Cookies bake for 14 minutes in my oven with perfect results in color and shape for icing.

Doubled both recipes for a Holiday party. I ended up with a little more than 100 - since it doesn't say what the recipe makes. My cutters were Worked out well. I cut the ginger bread thicker than the sugar cookies and was glad I did. I like my gingerbread more "bready" than cookie. Would add a little lemon zest next time to the ginger bread and maybe some cardamom to the sugar cookies. Over all a solid cookie recipe. Haven't iced them yet, but think I'll recruit help.

I only tried the sugar cookies. Many years ago my grandmother used to make a recipe very similar to these to put in our Easter baskets. I never had much luck with anything that needed to be rolled out so I never made them, but remembered them fondly. I don't really like the cut out cookies that they sell in bakeries, I think them bland. These are perfect! The dough is very easy to work with if you work quickly and produces a tender, crisp cookie.

I make these every year. Perfect. They do the trick - kids love them, neighbors expect them...tried and true. The gingerbread men are perfect - nice dough to work with. The citrus ones are actually delicious - -you'll enjoy eating them.

Both cookies are great but I always get the most complements on the gingerbread. Just don't overdo it on the lemon juice in the icing.

I made these with my 5 year old for his "bakerman" day at school. He wanted gingerbread men, but most kids aren't wild about the spices, so I made the sugar cookies instead. The dough is very fragile and I lost lots of heads and legs! The non-stick tray was not up to the task and I highly recommend baking paper. Eventually I had 24 intact men - we decorated them with gaudy glaze, sprinkles and smarties. They were apparently a huge hit with the kids at school, and I enjoyed eating the broken unglazed ones.

Sugar Cookie is fantastic! I will increase the zest the next time I make them. Texture was spot on. I'll use this as the base for all my decorated cookies from now on.

This review is for the gingerbread cookies. I made the dough for the sugar cookies, but I haven't baked them yet. The gingerbread cookies turned out excellently. I made a few modifications: I used unsulfured blackstrap molasses since that is what I had on hand, I also used extra ginger because I like it extra zesty. Because it's humid here in Austin, I had to add a little extra flour to get them to roll out properly. The texture was perfect, soft and a bit fluffy. I tried these with pumpkin ice cream and it was unbelievable!

I didn't make the gingerbread cookies due to their poor reviews, but the citrus cookies were wonderful. They're buttery and have a light citrus flavor that's enhanced by the glaze (cut recipe in half but still only used 1/4 of what I made). I chilled the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes rather than refrigerate for 4 hours, and it worked just fine. These were easy and delicious, and I'll definitely be making them again.

Rating: 3
I made both recipes on two different occasions. The gingerbread was ordinary and prone to toughness, but the citrus sugar cookies are amazing - fabulous flavour, melt in your mouth texture, crsip, buttery - yum. The only issue I had was getting the dough the right temperature to work with. Too warm and it's a sticky mess. Too cold and it fractures.

These were the worst gingerbread cookies I've ever made! I tried two separate batches assuming I had messed it up the first time, but they tasted like cardboard both times. The icing is also terrible - the lemon juice is completely overpowering

I made the gingerbread as directed but the dough was too dry and would not roll out properly. So I took a previous entry advice and added a bit of milk. Viola! The dough rolled out great, the cookies were a hit with no added spices. I baked them for 10 mins: not too crisp, not too soft. I will make again.

The recipe needs more spices, as noted by other reviewers, but definitely about 1 t. of ground black pepper as well.

The citrus sugar cookies are the nicest I have ever made. Handled beautifully. Tasted great. Lots of rave reviews from recipients! I use a frozen glass cutting board to roll them, which produces a more tender cookie since little extra board flour is needed!

I only made the gingerbread cookies, but they were really nice and authentic after I doubled all of the spices and added some extra spices as well. Despite overcooking, they had great flavor and were nice and crispy. Made the icing with a touch of lemon juice and vanilla. Would make these again, only cooking for ~10 minutes!

Very delicious, but I took some of the advice from the comments: 1) I doubled all the spices 2)in addition to doubling the ground ginger, I added some fresh ginger too just because I found it 3) added a little allspice as well 4) used a little milk to add in the flour towards the end 5) used a whole grain/white flour mix 6) cooked for only 8 minutes. delicious.

I have never made the gingerbread but I make the sugar cookies several times a year for baby showers, Halloween, Christmas, etc (iced cut outs). This is the most reliable cookie recipe you will ever find, and people truly love it. More than once, I've been asked in consequent years: "Are you gonna make those cookies again??"

I'm 21 and new to the "baking world", but I truly enjoyed the gingerbread cookies. They have a nice subtle flavor and didn't last very long in my house, but if you like your gingerbread strong, it's not for you. I made them for thanksgiving and made them again for christmas. The lemon royal icing really enhances the flavor. **note: bake cookies for 8 mins, the full time will make them rock-hard! Also the dough will be very hard to work with- adding a bit of milk and extra flour at the end while mixing it in the mixer GREATLY improved its workability.

The gingerbread cookies were bland and boring. Even doubling the amount of ginger did not help. The cooking time stated burned the first batch - reducing to ~8 mins did the trick. However, I would not make these again.

Rating: 1
The gingerbread cookie recipe is OK on taste, but terribly dry and almost impossible to roll. I keep coffee syrups in the house, so I added some of a pumpkin pie flavored one just to get it moist enough to roll. But, then that took away from a true gingerbread taste. If anyone else made the gingerbread recipe and it came out well, please help me figure out what I did wrong! I am an experienced baker of cakes, pies, cookies and bread, so I was pretty frustrated.

I made the citrus sugar cookies. These were very easy to make and the dough rolls out easily. My one comment is regarding the baking time. The recipe calls for a temperature of 350 and a baking time of 12 minutes. Knowing that cookies rolled out to 1/8" or 1/4" inch will cook much quicker than that, I only put them in for 8 minutes which was very adequate & some of the tips got a bit brown. I would suggest only putting them in for 7-8 minutes and then leaving them in longer if needed. They will burn for sure at 12 minutes.

Everyone else said the gingerbread cookies were boring. I have a gingerbread-mad husband, and I felt compelled to make him some delicious gingerbread cookies for Xmas -- so I took this recipe, doubled all the powdered spices, added 1 tbsp of fresh grated ginger, 2 tbsps of grated orange peel, and (the kicker) about 10 twists of fresh-ground black pepper. The result? Not the best gingerbread cookie imaginable, but certainly good enough. They improve if you let them sit around for a couple days. The sugar cookies are superlative. Just be careful not to overbake them.

I did only the citrus cookies.. they were nice, y used powdered sugar and oranje juice to make the "icing" and it wasn't bad they were great the only thing that I would be carefull with is only dong it on cold weather when your house is not so hot, I did it over the summer and I had to work really fast...

I actually made the gingerbread cookies and found the recipe worked nicely. I had previously tried another gingerbread recipe that failed, so I was quite relieved to find how easy this recipe was. Another reviewer mentioned the cookies as needing more spices.. perhaps you might want to play with the quantities a little bit.. but a good basic recipe to keep.

I've been looking high and low for a good sugar cookie recipe -- one that isn't bland and has a nice texture. And I'm happy to report that I've FINALLY FOUND A GREAT KEEPER! The citrus ones were excellent -- a wonderful tender texture and fresh tasting with the lemon and orange peel. The powder sugar in the recipe must make a difference, b/c they were so light and buttery at the same time. My 3 year old devoured them! The gingerbread men were okay -- not extraordinary like the citrus ones, but tasty.

I made both cookies & thought the sugar cookies were great, while the ginger cookies were good. I used the icing on both cookies, and the sugar cookies lost their cripsness after 24 hours. Did I thin the icing too much or is that just what happens to an iced cookie?

I made a batch of each of these as Halloween cookies, following the recipe very closely (all I changed was that I doubled the spices and used blackstrap molasses in the gingerbread one, which is excellent if you think of it not as gingerbread but as a spiced sugar cookie, which is what it is). They are delicious! Probably 20+ people got samples, and I got rave reviews from all. The icing recipe is an excellent one as it dries into a smooth glaze. I will make this over and over.

The main advantage to these cookies is that they were easy to roll out. I did not have to add too much additional flour to the pastry board or the pin. I only made the sugar cookies and the flavor was fine - nothing special. But then again, I was just looking for plain sugar cookies to decorate.

Yes, can't add much to the raves below, but had to say the citrus cookie recipe is the best-tasting, easiest roll-out cookie I've ever made! It makes making cookies fun again. And best of all, they taste good, too. Looking forward to Valentine's day next . . . then Easter . . . then 4th of July . . . . .

Made both of these this year, and they are both great. Gingerbread is not popular in my house, but it's a good recipe. The sugar cookies I cannot say enough good things about...they are buttery, citrusy and DELICIOUS! I used the icing as a glaze for the cookies and let my boys (2 and 4) add sprinkles. They dried perfectly for stacking, and the lemon in the icing complements the cookies (both kinds) perfectly. I will make these again! I had no problems working with the dough. Everything was perfect.

These two recipes are hands-down the best I've ever worked with. Of course they taste great, but they are also perfect to work with. Every other rolled dough is never as perfect as on a cooking show, but these two definitely are. It's so perfect! I make these again and again!

This is the second year that I've made both cookies and they get great reviews. I chill the dough overnight. The frosting for the gingerbread cookies is not terribly flavorful but is easy to use for piping if decorating is more important than flavor.

The citrus flavor was an interesting variation, but I think I prefer the traditional sugar cookie ... I also was wondering if anyone else noticed that the citrus smell is awfully sharp, almost like burning orange peels, while the cookies are baking? They turned out fine, but that smell was sort of startling (I ran to the oven to make sure the cookies weren't burning).

Did not make the gingerbread cookies, but the SUGAR cookies are fantastic -- perfect for cutting out with cookie cutters. I made them for Christmas and Easter and had great results each time. They're really halfway between a sugar cookie and a butter cookie -- not too sweet and not too crumbly. They have a great texture and the glaze firms up without becoming brittle. The only cookie-cutter recipe I need! Note: The frosting was best spread on with my finger, otherwise it didn't quite smooth out and the pressure of the knife threatened to break the cookie.

OK I only made the sugar cookies but it is a shame they are linked with the other recipie that has been so unfavorably reviewed. The sugar cookies are the only ones I will make from now on. They have a slight citrus flavor and a perfectly buttery, crisp texture. I've made them twice and will use them again and again. The icing is good too. I've colored it for spring cookies and let preschoolers decorate the cookies.

The citrus sugar cookies were no big deal; just OK and not impressive. Plus the consistency of the dough was too soft for good rolling, even with proper refrigeration.

I made the cookies years ago, and ever since I make the Citrus Sugar Cookies at Christmas and Valentine's. The Citrus cookies are the best, and everyone raves about them. They are light and crispy, but wonderfully flavored (unlike most sugar cookies). I found the cooking time varies quite a bit, from oven to oven and depending on how thin you roll them, so keep and eye on them! I didn't personally like the Gingerbread cookies, although some people who had some said they enjoyed them. They tasted somewhat bland.

On reading the reviews of the Gingerbread cookie I tried adding more spices and using regular molasses instead of light molasses - unfortunately it is still a terminally boring cookie.

I made the citrus sugar cookies, but I altered the recipe because I found out that my lemon was a little old after I started.
