I was very disappointed with this marinade. The five spice is not a good flavor for a chicken dinner. It has a flavor that seems more appropriate on french toast than chicken. We threw the chicken we had marinated away after grilling it and cooked new chicken breasts with a different seasoning.

Thank goodness I didn't put the second tsp of five-spice powder in this, or I'd probably have to throw the flank steak out. No other flavor except five-spice powder comes through. I'll still serve it, but what a waste of meat that would have been so much better with a different marinade.

I substituted orange juice for the sherry. It helped mellow out some of the intense heat of this marinade.

Very tasty. I used this for seafood kabobs and the flavor bonds well to shrimp & veggies.

Great marinade! I used beef and marinated it over night and turned out extremely flavorful. This makes a nice base "asian" marinade.

Marinated very thick boneless pork chops and grilled them. The flavor was very good with the pork and would make this marinade again.

I brushed this on a salmon fillet and BBQ'd it. Even people who don't like fish loved it! You might want to halve the recipe if using seafood, though. I ended up with a whole bunch left over.

Excellent on pork but you have to like five spice. Adding honey should enhance the flavor.

Tried this using the suggestion of another reviewer to add a little sugar - occurred to me that molasses would compliment the 5 spice really well and added about a 1/4 cup instead of sugar - it thickened the marinade and the chicken breasts really glazed up nicely on the grill. The little bit of sweetness I think enhanced the overall flavour - it was a hit.

I made this recipe for a short notice BBQ. Marinated chicken breasts in it for 2-3 hours. Very flavorful, but not over the top. I must admit that I was somewhat apprehensive that it might be too strong when doling out 2 tsp of five spice powder, with the ginger and other spices! I don't think I used as much ginger as it called for either. And I'm pretty sure I put some beer in the marinade as I am wont to do. Made some good warm sandwiches the next day!

I have never cooked Asian before... This marinade has changed all that. Just the aroma filling the house made my guests mouth water. Superb!!!

Delicious. I've made it several times and it always comes out well. However, one note of caution. I marinated chicken breasts in it overnight... and the marinade over-powered the chicken. So, tread lightly with chicken.

I used this on top sirloin, shrimp, scallop and vegetable kebabs and it was a huge hit. My only adjustment was that I added a tablespoon of sugar to really bring out the barbeque flavor! A definite keeper in my recipe file!

Very easy to whip up. The five spice powder is sold in most grocery stores in the Asia section.Also, if you forget the green onions, just substitute dehydrated white onions, or green if you have 'chives'.I made this with chicken that I cooked indirectly on my Weber. Heat the coals on one side of the grill only, then when ready, put the meat on the opposite side, with the vent over the meat. I also used mesquite wood soaked in plain water, and it was excellent. Will try this with beef next.

If you like the flavor of five spice powder then you will like this marinade. I thought that the flavor was over powering, I could not taste the ginger in this recipe. I was a little disappointed, although everyone else seemed to really like it.

I am always looking for a good marinade that is just a little different and this one fit the bill. Using chili oil gives this recipe a bit of a kick. Will use again.
