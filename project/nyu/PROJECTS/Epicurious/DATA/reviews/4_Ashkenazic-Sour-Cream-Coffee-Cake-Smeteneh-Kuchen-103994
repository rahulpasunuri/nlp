Really great basic recipe. People devoured it! Added in some apricot preserves for a little change. Looking forward to trying varieties others have mentioned.

Not sure why this rates so high... it was just a garden-variety coffee cake. Its versatility is worthy of some points, though. Usually my oven takes longer to bake things than the recipes call for, but in this case, I at the prescribed time my cake was a tad overdone, so keep a close watch. Anyway, in the future I will look for a more creative coffeecake with a lighter texture.

Sorry naysayers.... for a scratch cake, this is easy. I had no baking soda, so used 4 tspn of baking powder. The cake was wonderful and moist. Added lemon zest to batter and about 1 tbspn of lemon juice to glaze.... yum!

I think this is a keeper. Super easy, I made it in a 9X13 as a single layer and swirled a knife through before baking. Definitely going to try the cheese version with raspberry or blueberry preserves next time!

I made this for a catering.. It went over very well. I only did a single layer in a 9X12. I put the streusel topping on the top only using the nuts. I replaced some of the flour with 1/2c oats and 1/4c freshly ground flax (just for the health of it). It gave it more texture. I made it a 2nd time and put a swirl of cream cheese then 3 berry jam through it... Now that was very good too! This is a good one to experiment with...

My goodness, a lot of fuss for a german coffee cake; my mother whipped up something similar in half the time that tasted much better. Here is the recipe: Mix 2 cups flour with 1 cup sugar and ¾ cup butter into crumbs. Set aside 1 cup crumbs and add to remainder: 1 cup milk 1 egg 1 tsp. soda, cinnamon and cloves 2 cups raisins Stir, put into greased cake pan and top with the crumbs that were set aside. Bake in 350 oven for 30 minutes. Enjoy!

Right as I was taking this out of the oven, my mother showed up. I offered her some. The house smelled great, she couldn't resist. It was so good, she asked for a copy of the recipe. This is definitely something I plan on making about once a month.

I live at 7000 feet, so I am a little trepidatious about cakes. This one turned out beautifully! For altitude, I added a couple of extra tablespoons of flour, a little less baking powder, 1 extra egg yolk and cooked on bottom rack. I used mini chocolate chips for my "optional ingredien", and it was delicious. Will definitely try the other variations (cream cheese/ fruit)!

This is a good, classic coffee cake recipe. I recommend making the cake a day prior to serving it. The cake seems to retain more moisture if allowed to sit overnight. The glaze is delicious -- using almond instead of vanilla flavoring in the glaze really takes it over the top.

This was easy and delicious. I used plain yogurt and brown sugar, and it turned out very nice and moist. If you're looking for just a good, traditional coffee cake (no exotic flavors that might scare off the in-laws), this is it.

Since I can't eat yeast or eggs, I was looking for a new replacement for Christmas morning breakfast. Used egg replacer and this was excellent! Everyone loved it.

This recipe was wonderful, but what evolved because of a careless mistake turned out to be quite interesting... and delicious. I thought the batter was too thick as I was spreading half into the prepared tube pan, but I forged ahead, adding half the topping mixture, the other half batter, finishing with the rest of the topping mixture. As I was putting it in the oven, it hit me... I had totally forgotten the sour cream!! I wasn't about to throw it all out, so I immediately put all back into the large mixing bowl and dumped as much of the loose topping (w/nuts) as I could into a small bowl. The rest had to be mixed into the batter along with the sour cream. I put the reserved topping on top and put it in the oven. My daughter & I crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. The end result was amazing! The cake rose beautifully, topping was perfect and the color a golden brown. We turned it out immediately, and enjoyed a delicious, warm Christmas morning coffee cake tradition!

I cook this every Christmas for breakfast, and everyone raves (so I'm now stuck doing it forever). Very easy recipe, glaze is optional. I typically use pecans.

This turned out delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (didn't use the optional nuts/fruit/choc chips in the streusel) and it was wonderful! I made it in a 9x13 for the single layer version, perfect size and only took 35 minutes to bake. The glaze was delicious also. It got rave reviews from everyone at the ladies brunch I took it to. I will definitely keep this recipe around and make it again!

Such an easy recipe with wonderful results! I was looking for a way to use up some sour cream and found a new family favorite! The nuts in the streusel and the icing made this exceptional. An easy way for even an inexperienced baker to make a great impression

This recipe is a keeper. I used coconut and raisins and increase the amount of both. The cake was incredibly moist. I have a feeling this is going to be a requirement for me to bake every year.

Kind of disappointed. I had higher hopes for this cake. It was just OK. We added the lemon zest, pecans, walnuts, nutmeg and even some blueberries, but it was just so underwhelming. It had a nice crumb. It was moist. The cake just lacked a great flavour. We made the glaze (almond extract version) and that did improve the taste, but a cake shouldn't rely on frosting or glaze for its oomph. We aren't going to finish eating this cake. Not worth the calories. We won't be making this again.

I am new to baking, but this came out wonderful! The ratings were: 'the best coffee cake', 'the traditional coffee cake'! This is a keeper, and i will try to perfect it! Baked it in a bundt pan, and although the batter does come out very thick, the result is a success!

Used a Bundt pan for this recipe and it turned out very well. I filled the Bundt pan with approximately 1/2 the batter, then added the filling (I used walnuts and cranraisins) and topped with the remaining batter. Baked for approximately 50 min.s @350 degrees. I used two tbls. each of butter, sugar, brandy heated in the microwave for the glaze. Apply with pastry brush while cake is warm. Gives the cake a nice sheen and extra good taste.

Fantastic recipe, I ran out of sour cream and used plain yogurt instead. The crumb in the cake is delicate and very moist. I added a bit of lemon zest in the batter, nice hint without overpowering the cake. I did a single layer of steusel (I forgot to layer it). I added a cinnamon/cayenne chocolate chips to streusal which made the cake unusual yet delicious. I would make this again...it is a wonderful recipe to get creative with. Next time I may add apples.

I love this recipe--it comes out flawless no matter what options you take. This time, I did half white half brown sugar, some walnuts, and skipped the zest, and baked it in a greased and floured nonstick bundt pan (no parchment or extra steps). Very impressive!

Rating: 3
I made this in a tube pan which came out looking really professional. I added a splash (11/2 Tablespoons) of orange juice to the batter since some reviews mentioned the batter was too thick and dry. I also used the lemon zest and vanilla. I used walnuts and golden raisins in the streusel along with nutmeg and increased the cinnamon. Everyone loved the cake and the flavor. Next time I would definitely double the streusel topping. I am giving it 3 stars be/c without doubling the streusel it just seems off to me.

Hey I have made this recipe multiple times and found it to be moist, easy, and extremely reliable. You can add fruit pretty easily and a fresh dark cherry version I put together was pretty memorable.

Exactly what a sour cream coffee cake should be. I was worried it was too hard when I felt the outside but when I cut into it the inside was perfectly moist. I made it in a bundt pan and baked at 325 for 55 minutes. The glaze was the perfect final touch. I made the streusel with all brown sugar, added the nutmeg (a nice extra flavor), and used walnuts.

Rather dry and not a 4 fork recipe. I think I'll stick to my Polish gramma's coffeecake recipes. The struesel was mediocre compared to what I usually make. Guess I'll have to take the time to post it for all of you coffeecake lovers out there.

A couple more notes, If omitting the mix ins for the topping, I would double the other ingredients to bulk it up a bit. Also, dusted it with confectioner's sugar which gave it a pretty presentation.

Rating: 4
This was very good. I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 glass pan which was a little too small. I also omitted the chopped nuts and other mix ins, making very simple for a group gathering. It was good, but I am sure it would be even better with them and will make it that way next time. The batter was thick, but I didn't really have a problem with it. Just dropped it by the large spoonful over the topping and spread it gently with a butter knife. Tasted even better the next day.

I made this for a baby shower recently and WOW was it good. I was really concerned because the batter is so thick it was hard to spread in my bundt pan, but I was delighted when it baked well. It was tough getting it out of the pan, but we did it. It was so moist and so delicious! I did just the basic coffee cake recipe, but next time will certainly try adding the blueberries. You must try this!

Came out perfectly. The batter was thick, as other reviewers have commented - I spooned the second layer carefully over the middle streusel layer in dollops and gently smoothed over the gaps so as not to blend streusel into batter. also freezes well. I did 1 cup mixed walnuts/chopped dark chocolate in the streusel and skipped the glaze.

This was really tasty! I was concerned at how thick the batter was when I put it into the pan - it was difficult to spread two layers with crumb in between as instructed. However, it came out tasting delicious with a nice soft texture.

I forgot to add that I used 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour in the batter - just another layer of flavor. Yum!

I made this for a bridesmaid party and it was a big hit! I followed the recipe, including the nutmeg and the lemon zest. I used full-fat plain greek yogurt and increased the amount by about 1/3 cup. For the streusel I used chopped pecans and chopped candied ginger which I thought complimented the lemon zest. I baked my cake in a bundt pan at 325 for 60 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer. It turned out fantastic! Very moist and flavorful. I'll definetly make this again.

This was a great coffee cake. The first time I made it, I used a 9 inch springform pan but there was way too much batter. It overflowed during baking and took over 90 minutes to be done. The next time I made it, I used a 10 inch springform and it worked out much better. I made double amount of streusel and I used an equal mix of granulated and brown sugar in both the streusel and batter and it was delicious. I also added ½ cup of buttermilk which I think contributed to how moist it was. I added the cream cheese mixture and the blueberry jam before adding the remaining streusel topping. Everyone raved!

I started to make this and realized I didn't have sour cream or plain yogurt. So I used 6oz coffee yogurt, 6oz lemon yogurt. I was anxious about the results, but it was absolutely delicious!! Didn't really notice the yogurt flavors, it was super moist. I used the cream cheese topping, which didn't spread well, so I just mooshed it all together on top. Also doubled the topping, used coconut and chopped mixed nuts. Baked 1 hr 10 minutes. Boyfriend said it was the best coffee cake ever (but he's biased). I will definitley make this again, maybe with sour cream next time.

This is really good but did anyone else find the batter alarmingly thick and difficult to spread in a Bundt pan? I used soured cream (smetana) instead of regular sour cream due to availability and egg substitute due to an egg allergy among the invitees.

This is delicious! I have made it twice and brought it to work- everyone always loves it. I use low fat plain yogurt, and I add cinnamon to the batter along with lime and orange zest. For the topping, I add lots more cinnamon than called for, and I use both chocolate chips and nuts. Yumm!

This cake turned out perfectly. I used a bundt pan, which worried me, as usually I have trouble with sticking, but greased with crisco and floured the cake released without a tear. I used the 3 egg option and chose all brown sugar and the cake is a very light tan color with a dark vein of the streusel throughout and absolutely moist and tender. My oven is usually pretty right on in terms of temperature (a yellow cake always cooks in exactly the time given, I don't need to test it hardly) but this cake needed an extra 5 minutes. I tested it with a skewer when there were three minutes left and it was still wet, but after 8 more minutes (the 3 remaining plus 5 additional) it was perfect. I didn't notice that it really pulled away from the sides all that much, perhaps it would be different in a regular round pan. My only 'variation' is that I used slightly more sourcream, 1 1/4 instead of just a cup, as I had that much left in the tub and saw no reason to keep such a tiny bit of sourcream in the fridge. I highly suggest making it, I made it last night and there is less than half left now, at 2:30 the following afternoon. Our houseguests each ate 2 large pieces for breakfast and my husband took a huge chunk to work after having a piece with his coffee this morning. I am trying to keep away from it.

Great cake. I made double the recipe and served one cake at a brunch, everyone loved it. The second cake I kept for my family, we ate it in the mornings over a week. It stayed moist and edible for the 5 days it lasted. I made the cake ahead, doubled the strudel, and layered it. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and sugar in the raw. It came out perfectly. This is the kind of recipe that can be played with and still turn out beautifully.

I do a lot of cooking and baking and I have to say this is the best cake I have ever made. It is moist, tasty, succulent and absolutely gorgeous when taken out of springform pan. I followed all the directions including greasing on both sides of the parchment, and it paid off. I used grated orange peel instead of zest. Do make this coffee cake!

Rating: 3
Very good but I thought it was a little dry for coffee cake. Next time I will double the struesel topping and add it to the middle portion, would have liked more brown sugar delights throughout the cake. I will add more lemon next time as well. Otherwise very good, especially with my morning coffee!!!

Rating: 4
This is by far the best coffee cake I've ever made - rich, dense, moist, and not cloyingly sweet. I made twice the amount of streusel, omitted any extra ingredients such as nuts or raisins and the lemon zest. I used whole milk sour cream, and 3 whole eggs. I baked it for about 45 minutes in a parchment lined 9-inch springform pan. As far as cakes go, it doesn't have an excessive number of steps - unless you're used to working with a box of cake mix.

I used 1 cup pecans for the topping (prepared in the food processor) and half whole wheat flour in the cake, and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan. It turned out great and was quite easy done in a single layer. I can't wait to try more variations.

Made this with double amount of crumb topping, added blueberries, and the cream cheese layer on top, with melted blueberry jam. Used half (dark) brown sugar where indicated, and that was a good choice. The cake took much longer to bake than indicated in the 9 inch springform panm more like 70 minutes, and then it still fell in the middle. It was especially delicious the next day, when flavors had mellowed. Very moist, and the bown sugar crumb was delicious.

Holy Heck does this recipe have a lot of steps, or what? But, I would make it again, if given the time. I expected it to be a little more moist than it was, but maybe it came out a little dry because I used low fat sour cream...which shouldn't matter with all the butter used. Anyhow, it's a good cake...just set aside a chunk of time (at least an hour) and use the real sour cream.

The first time I made the recipe it was a nice coffee cake, but I thought it needed some modification to make it a supreme coffee cake. I doubled the crumble topping and increased the granulated sugar by 1/3 cup in this blend. Additionally, when blending the wet ingredients I increased the sour cream by 1/3 cup. I thought this increased the moisture content of the finished result nicely. When the final result was presented to my very critical panel of taste testers (my adored family members), they were truly impressed with the quality of this coffee cake. I love the presentation factor this cake has when made in a springform and cut into slices. Being able to see the middle level of crumble topping is very nice. Give it a try!

Great recipe. I have made this many times with great results, the cream cheese topping is delicious, lime is an alternative to lemon, any berry esp blueberry or rasperry is divine.

My husband said to me the other day, "You know, I would like a sour cream streusel cake!" Wouldn't you know it, Epicurious would have one. I made it for him this morning and he just loved it! I didn't have quite enough (light) sour cream so added buttermilk to make almost a cup. I made it in one layer in a 13 x 9 inch pan, added the cream cheese layer and topped the streusel layer (which I zipped up in the food processor) with the optional glaze. It was delicious!!

I love this recipe. For low fat I substituted the butter in the batter for an equivalent amount of yogurt and it turned out moist and fluffy and fantastic. I also changed the butter in the streudel for oil and it worked great. To avoid the cooking problems of a bundt pan, I cooked it in the upper 3rd of the oven and reduced the temperature to 325 and baked for 60 minutes. I am putting this recipe in my permanent collection.

I made this in a bundt pan for a bridal shower and it got rave reviews. I omitted the glaze to keep it less sweet, and used 3 eggs instead of 4 egg yolks. Dusted with powdered sugar and surrounded with fresh strawberries. Very light, we wished there had been more of it to go around.

Just tested a warm sliver fresh from the oven - couldn't resist. The verdict? Absolutely awesome! I used walnuts in the streusel as well as the cream cheese and raspberry jam topping.

This dish was really moist and easy and looked professionally baked (looks lovely baked in a bundt pan). It wasn't too sweet to eat for breakfast, and the apples made a great, moist, lower fat addition! Bob, my next door neighbor didn't like it, but that's only because he's horribly allergic to currants and blew up and turned sort of this purplish grey color and had to go to the hospital and get his stomach pumped. Anyway, it was delish!

I just baked this cake, and think it's totally awesome. I actually ate my first slice as my pre-dinner dessert, I couldn't wait another second! There was some extra work involved, and I also added the cream cheese topping as well as the preserves, but I thought it was worth the effort. I would recommend about 10 extra minutes of baking time if the cheese and preserves are added, or maybe I was just being overly cautious.

I wouldn't exactly call this a favorite. There is a fair amount of effort involved (compared to other coffee cake recipes I've made in the past), and I can't say that it was worth it. My husband thought it was "a funny color" and the glaze was so runny that it soaked the cake. If you do attempt this recipe, I'd recommend baking it for longer than 50 minutes. My cake was still runny in parts after nearly an hour. Good luck!
