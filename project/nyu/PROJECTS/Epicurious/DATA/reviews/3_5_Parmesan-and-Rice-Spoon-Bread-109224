I just made this recipe and it's so good! Very rich, you wouldn't need to eat a lot of it. The recipe is accurate, except for the cooking times. It took longer than 20 minutes to thicken on the stovetop and mine took about 40 to 45 minutes to bake in a deep dish pie plate. (cover loosely with foil after about 20 minutes to prevent burning)

Just made this and it's wonderful. Don't skip folding in the egg whites, it changes the whole appeal of the dish. Next time I would make it in individual ramkins and flip and serve right on the plate with some asparagus and lamb chops.

This is soo good and soo easy. Perfect with a big salad for a cozy supper!

I made it as is and we liked it quite a bit. I did bake it for 7 minutes longer as it was just a bit too runny at 25 minutes. 32 minutes was perfect.
