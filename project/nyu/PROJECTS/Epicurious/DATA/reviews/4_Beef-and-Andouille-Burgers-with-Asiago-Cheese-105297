Delicious! the andouille adds great flavor and the sauce and peppers make for a moist burger we will make again and again... http://ladyberds-kitchen.blogspot.com/2012/06/beef-and-andouille-burgers-with-asiago.html

My family (three adults) agree with so many others that this is a keeper. Made exactly as written but all inside on the Foreman grill...no lost onions and perfectly done. These are specialty burgers for summer guests...now to invite some so we can have another excuse to make them again.

this might be the most flavorful, delicious burger i've ever eaten! i made it as written, but omitted the roasted red pepper and red onion. i plan to make this again and again!

One of the most flavorful burgers I've ever made. It was a big hit and the spice is just enough heat to bring a sweat to the back of your neck! I took the extra (and possibly unnecessary) step of removing the casings from the andouille first to make sure it crumbled well in the processor. I think the results made it worth it. Dense yet juicy patties that made my and my guests mouth water. Will put this excellent recipe on my regular rotation.

This is 1 Awesome Burger! added a dash of cajon spice to give a zip...would make again and again!

Great recipe. We used chicken andouille sausage (closest we could find), which turned out well, and otherwise followed the directions. I would agree with other reviewers that half (or less) the salt in the burgers would be fine - with the cheese and the sausage, it's not lacking for salt.

Delicious, juicy burgers. Easy to make and all the toppings make them unique.

Went on a charity police vs firemen grill-off on a local news channel. This was the hit of the show, really nice presentation and great taste. I scrambled the sausage before adding it to the beef and it cooked up great with a great flavor. Categories were ribs, chicken, burger, steak and this was the overall favorite.

I made these for Halloween for friends and they loved them too! Did the whole thing indoors cuz I didnt feel like standing outside. From what Ive read in other reviews, its the way to go when you're dealing with the onions. Alot of people have complained that they fall thru the grill . I used a grill pan for both the burgers and the onions and it was great. I didnt change a thing but omitted the red peppers cuz i didnt have any. Used avocado instead. Fennel really makes a statement in this so dont leave it out if you can. All in all, really a unique burger.

Delicious! I've made this recipe four times so far for different people, and even my generally not-too-burger-friendly family appreciated it. The grillmaster wasn't happy about dealing with onion rings falling through the grill, but at dinnertime he graciously admitted that it was worth it. I would suggest making less of the sauce: it tastes fantastic, but the flavors are very strong and we never use more than half of it.

Not so much... I followed recipe but the family wasn't impressed. Dissapointing given the reviews. Tip: insert skewers into peeled onion horizontally before slicing to keep the rings intact on th grill - kind of onion lolly-pop like, it saves the rings from falling through the grates.

My fiance has requested these burgers countless times. I've made them by the recipe and also substituting kielbasa for andouille and monterey jack for the asiago in a pinch - excellent burger either way. I was roped into preparing 30 of these for a tailgating BBQ last season (whoo hoo, Chargers!) and was instantly crowned the Burger Queen. This recipe comes highly recommended by all of my Burger Subjects.

I have been making these for several years and this is one of my favorite burgers. I alternate this with the Napa Valley Cabernet Burgers also on this website when my family wants a "specialty" burger. If you can find it, use the Andouille--it makes the burger!

Rating: 4
A memorable burger. By the time you purchase all the out-of-the-ordinary ingredients, they cost about $12 a pop. Careful with the patty size. If you do a 1 inch patty as recommended, you'll have to unhinge your jaw like one of those African snakes. However, the best bugrer I've ever had.

You will not have good results if you dont use asiago or a good substitute. Parmesan is not a good substitute for asiago.

A really nice burger, no doubt about it.. Tastes match well, and it's surprisingly quick and easy to make - no hassle! It didn't taste quite as much as I thought it would - my boyfriend, on the other hand, could've done with half the toppings. I didn't have Asiago cheese, so I used Parmesan; other than that I stuck to the recipe. Will make this again, but much spicier!

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I could not find Andouille sausages so i substitued spicy italian sausage and it was still terrific. I can only amagine what it is like with andouille sausage

Followed the recipe exactly. The andouille masked the flavor of the beef. I wouldn't make this again.

I have been making these burgers every summer since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit in 2001. They have become a family favorite and frequent cookout request. They have made it hard to eat "plain" old hamburger anymore. The surprise hit for most guests are all of the toppings that make this hamburger so unique.

Made this for my dad and husband for Father's Day. What a hit! Left out the fennel, but left everything else the same. Will use the make the mayo spread again and use on other types of sandwiches. Very easy recipe.

Fabulous! I only substituted the beef with buffalo and parmesan for asiago (what I had on hand). It was the best burger I've ever had!

The two recipes in the database of burgers with andouille sausage and onions intrigued me and seemed to get raves reviews, so I started with this one and will try the other another time. Overall I thought it was very good and only cut down on the salt. 2 tsps seemed excessive (and would definitely have been) even for this quantity of ground beef because of the sausage addition. After making them, I'd cut it down even more, maybe to only 1/2 tsp. Otherwise, I made no changes. Loved the mayo spread, grilled onions and asiago toppings that go with this mixed beef and sausage burger and I'd advise doubling the mayo so it can be spread thickly.

Rating: 3
Not much to change on this recipe. The burgers were almost too thick, though. Be generous with the mayo and don't leave out the crushed fennel seeds.

I didn't make the asiago cheese sauce but instead melted gorgonzola cheese on the burgers and they tasted fantastic. The sausage addition was amazing. They were the best burgers I've ever made.

I was actually thinking while eating this burger that I would probably rate it a "three forks". But when my husband turned to me and said that it was the best burger he had had in a very long time and his mother agreed, I decided it deserved a "four forks" rating. It is very delicious and I have been asked to make it again!

Hands down the best burger I've had! The sausage added great flavor and spice, and the asiago cheese complimented the tastes very well. Will make again quite often.

This is absolutely the BEST BURGER that I have ever made or tasted. The only variation was that I used ground sirloin (10% fat) instead of recommended ground beef and the result was still a very juicy, delicious burger. I thought of adding some chipotles to the mayonaise (as previously suggested) but after trying the exact recipe, there is no need for any other adjustments! This was perfect!

Always a big hit! We've been making this recipie since it first appeared in Bon Appetit! Don't skip the "extras" - the grilled onions, asiago, mayo and peppers really make the burger!

How can you cook this burger to only medium-rare when there's sausage involved? Is andouille sausage fully cooked when you buy it?

This was DELICIOUS; the sausage, spices, and everything else really perked up what used to be a regular old hamburger. I did take some liberties, though. I chopped the tomatoes and sausage fine enough that I did not need a food processor. Also, I CANNOT buy ground beef that is 15% fat. I used 1-1/2 lbs. of extra-lean ground beef and 4.8 oz. of sausage to make 6 patties, each of which was 1/2-inch thick. (The original recipe calls for 8 oz. of sausage and 40 oz. of ground beef--this is a 1:5 ratio.) 4.8 oz. sausage to 24 oz. ground beef is the same ratio, 1:5.) Used the seasonings as written and refrigerated the seasoned meat mixture for 24 hrs. before forming the patties. DO use the Asiago cheese if you can find it. If not, I would suggest a mixture of 1/2 Feta and 1/2 Monterey Jack cheeses. These burgers were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, and (hopefully) a little less artery clogging when made this lower-fat way!!!

Very good recipe for those who like smoky sausage flavor. We added the cheese into the meat mixture (+ an egg), and it turned out very nice. Made it with buffalo meat instead of beef, and missed the beef flavor.

Yesterday I did these for a bbq at the house. These burgers were great! The andouille gives the burgers a great tangy flavor and the mayo was also wonderful. My guests loved them.

Rating: 3
Love the smokiness that the andouille gave the burgers. We thought the burgers were really good, but does need some heat. Next time I will add some minced chipotles to either the mayo or burgers. Or even roast a poblano pepper to add w/the roasted red bells. Didn't add the fennel seeds. Served these w/roasted cajun spiced potato wedges. Definatley a keeper.

Excellent! Like so many others, I couldn't find andouille, so I used spicy Italien sausage. Was too chilly for the grill, but it made little difference. The flavors are just fantastic!!

I couldn't find any Andouille sausage at the grocery store but I found Cajun sausage. I was afraid this recipe would be much too hot, especially since I only used 1# of hamburger, and three Cajun sausages. I used one shallot, no black pepper and just a little salt. Anyway, it was awesome, and even the kids loved it! Surprise! I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used chili sauce (about 3 or 4 T). That mayo is great! And I too hate red peppers, so didn't use those. Could have used a lot more red onion! Well, this was made indoors on my range since it's end of November. So I sauteed the red onion (one small homegrown one) in olive oil, and it's enough for maybe two burgers! The fennel seed wouldn't get crushed in my mortar and pestle, so I threw them in anyway. This made 4 large hamburgers. I kind of wonder what Asiago cheese has to do with Cajun, but it was good!

These are fantastic! I didn't put the peppers on my burger since I hate them, but my husband did, and he was kissing my feet all day long for treating him to these things. I was unable to find andouille, so I used spicy italian sausage. I was disappointed that I couldn't find any, but they were really top notch with the stuff I ended up using, so no complaints here.

The joke in my family is that barbecue is a four beer job, and I can't get it right because I don't drink beer. Well ... the joke ended here. These are excellent, and if it rains, they are just as good done inside. Have subed monterey jack for goat cheese when we were out, with equal success. These are simply awesome!

These burgers are "da bomb" according to my husband and I.. We do not care for mayo, cut out the roasted peppers, and prefer Pepper-jack to Asiago, and these still turned out unbelievable.. Last night,I added about a tablespoon of roasted garlic and 3 ounces of pancetta as well as cutting the salt due to the pancetta... added more to the savoriness and juiciness of these burgers!! I will never go back to marinating burgers in L&P!

These were the best burgers we had ever tasted (even beat In-N-Out)! Worth the extra effort, we can't go back to eating normal burgers. We couldn't find andouille sausages, so we used Hillshire Farms sausages with red chili peppers, and they still turned out great. My b/f loves to put sauces on everything he eats, but these burgers were so flavorful he didn't add sauce. That's quite an endorsement!!

Try it you won't regret it.

My girlfriend and I (both new moms) decided to start meeting one day a week to make dinner for our families. We pick a recipe from Epicurious, buy the ingredients and cook together. On our first "gourmet day", it was 100 degrees, so we decided an easy, no oven dish was appropriate. We made these burgers and got rave reviews. I couldn't find asiago cheese, so I used fontana and it was still very good.
