Followed the recipe except served the chile paste on the side instead of cooking with it because the chorizo I had was pretty spicy and I didn't want to make my kids cry. All four of us really liked this dish. Enough leftovers for lunch - a plus. Will definitely make again and will add steamed veggies to it next time.

Had to improvise on the recipe, replacing chorizo with Lopchong (Chinese Sausage),didn't have jicama so I used carrotts, celery & onion. My family and I loved it, and I'll definately make this again!

This dish was delicious following this morning's workout! Quick and easy. I used refrigerated Korean Rice Noodles that took one minute to cook. I left out the chorizo, but everything else made it taste great! I have leftovers too. Thank you Epi!

Very good and relatively easy. A little chili paste goes a long way. I, too, will try to add some addtional ingredients, may be red bell pepper strips and maybe some peanuts or other type of nut

tastes authentic to me. Is there a good substitute for jicama? Yucca doesn't do it.

I feel like a Malaysian food stand opened up in my kitchen. This was delicious, EASY, and versatile. Seriously, I read the recipe at work, my boyfriend picked me up, we went to the local store, and I had it ready in about 30 minutes (he helped with chopping, the major bottleneck was defrosting the shrimp). Substitutions: I don't like jicama so we put in bell peppers, I couldn't find chorizo so I used those turkey kielbasas which gave it this little hint of an American childhood and that made it even more lovely. I also added in the black bean paste as another reviewer suggested.

Good, but could use more complexity of flavor. Next time I will add some seasoned rice vinegar and spicy bean paste to the soy sauce mix.

I followed the recipe, made no modifications. It was good, I will make it again. Next time I would veg it up a little more, add some red bell peppers, etc.

Very good. Easy to make and filled with lots of colorful, flavorful ingredients. Don't bother pre-soaking the rice noodles, just boil them like normal and save a step.

Super easy to make and is delicious. My kids loved this one. Only downside is no leftovers!
