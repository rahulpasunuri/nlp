I have made this several times in past years. It is always delightful, easy, healthy, and so summery. Fresh corn, there is nothing like it. This time I made it healthier using more radishes and only 1 T of olive oil. I'm sure frozen corn is great and this is the perfect picnic food to make ahead for a crowd.

This was great. I mixed everything except the corn and radishes like it was a dressing and made extra. I then mixed it with the corn and radishes and served it over leaf lettuce.

Great recipe. I used frozen corn, thawed, and found it it to work out just fine. A nice addition would be blacks beans, rinsed and drained but you'd need to make a little more dressing to cover it. Bugs me that the title of the recipe has jalapeno misspelled.

I made this salad a few hours before I served it and it was delicious! I love fresh raw corn (I used sweet white). I don't think it would be very good with canned. I served it with enchiladas and black beans, but it would also be good as a salsa. In response to other reviews, I did not find it at all oily.

Not a bad dish. My aunt had made this for me once, so I tried using this recipe. Two things I took issue with was how oily it was, so next time I'll be sure to use less olive oil, and also to use FRESH ears of corn, not the canned stuff (which was all I had on hand). Other than that, not bad.

We really enjoyed this, I would slice the radishes a little less thin next time to get more of the radish bite, but it is a great side dish! The next day it was good, but not so pretty as the radishes started to bleed so everything was a little pink.

Great side dish. The fresh corn makes all of the difference. I used a combination of yellow and white corn for added interest. I made it the night before a party and it held up very well. Great summer recipe.

This is terrific! Very nice with the green chile quesadillas. I've made it for several southwestern dinner parties!

A great alternative to the usual ears of corn cooked and buttered!! The full flavor of the corn is enjoyed raw. This dish is great for a cool side dish on a hot day and would be perfect on a picnic!

What a great little recipe! I love things like this that you can make ahead and not have to worry about at the last minute when the entree is taking all your attention. This has tons of flavor, and is really healthy (use less oil - you won't notice the difference). I also used frozen corn. Basil would probably be really nice in this too, if you don't like cilantro, or want to change it a bit.

Very easy, very excellent. Sometimes the simplest things are the tastiest. Super healthy. Used sweet frozen corn, made a day ahead and tasted great the next day for company. My guests also used as a dip for chips. I will make again for sure.

Simple to make and delicious. Served with sauteed scallops with roasted red peppers.

I used 3 cans of corn and added a can of rinsed black beans and a tomato. Everyone ended up eating it as a dip with nacho chips, not a salad - it's very addicting! It was a really nice change from acidy canned salsa. It made a lot (with my substitutions) but that's OK because it tastes even better today (I'm eating it right now).

I think it's perfect with meat of any kind, and a good summer salad, and it's easy.

Very tasty salad. Fresh corn was not available so I used frozen. Not ideal but not bad. I increased the amount of radishes but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Served this with quedadillas - everyone raved.

Grilled the ears of corn, then cut it off cob. Froze cobs for later use in soup stocks. Added lime zest as well as lime juice. Also added salt to taste. Added 1 can black beans to make it a more substantial salad. Didn't use the jalapeno seeds but then added a few drops of green habanero sauce. Terrific salad! Would definitely make it again.

Very light and tasty. We par-cooked the corn, since corn was out of season when we made it. Note that it takes 8 to 10 ears of white corn to make 4 cups of kernals, not 4 ears.

This was very good. I used garlic olive oil and 3 peppers. I also added roasted red pepper for color. Everyone loved it.

Every time I make this I get asked for the recipe - delicious!

I don't like the over bearing pungency of cilantro, so I cut it back. Too weak - should have left it alone. Iadded 1/4 cup minced roasted peppers AND used dark olive oil. Great!!

This was very good! I roasted the Corn first this added to the sweetness I also finely chopped some Vidalia onion in it. My wife who said she wouldn't eat cold corn tasted it and has asked me to make it again. Enjoy!!

This salad isn't a bad way to use up corn, but it wasn't too special. I didn't have jalepeno, but I doubt it would have made that much of a difference. It's worth a try anyway.
