Great and very easy, didn't have chives but added fresh chopped cilantro to taste. Wonderful.

This was a refreshing change from mashed potatoes at our slightly non-traditional Thanksgiving table. It could definitely do without the lime juice, but was made more interesting because of it. Add salt to taste, otherwise it can be bland. The potato ricer was a great tool to have for this - it made the texture delightfully smooth.

I wasn't sure about the lime juice at first, but it actually complements the sweetness of the yams very well. It makes this taste like a side dish instead of a dessert. People who liked sweet potatoes really enjoyed this dish.
