Very flavorful and easy. I used kale instead of mustard greens and didn't have any chives--it turned out great!

I love this soup and have made many variations of it with the lima bean puree as the base. Do not leave out the butter, add more if you dare.

very bland, I even added more garlic and thought it was boring.

I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe. Although I added extra veggies (corn and red pepper), I found the soup pretty bland. The summery (frozen) vegetables were a nice break from winter standards, but overall it just wasn't that exciting. Maybe vegetable stock instead of water would have added some depth of flavor. In the end I served it over rice (like a stew) and stirred in some storebought pesto, which made it a lot better in terms of flavor and texture.

Looks very pretty with all different shades of green! Very tasty. I felt even baby limas needed a bit more cooking to be "done" so I simmered about 15 minutes more...and I added a bit of chicken stock to water. Really very good and different and easy. I will make again.

Another surprisingly good dish. I add some baby corn with the peas and some red pepper. This recipe has gotten me to like mustard greens, after resisting them for 20 years after moving to the South....

Very good recipe! Nice peppery taste and great texture. Now as difficult to make as it sounds.

I made this recipe for a dinner party recently, and added it to the menu at the last minute because two guests turned out to be vegetarian. Well, the soup turned out to be the best part of the entire meal, which included a squash risotto, pork loin, and fennel salad. Several guests asked to see the recipe. One thing I'd offer is to salt this soup to taste -- and let the soup sit for a little while to blend the flavors.

Wasn't wild about this one, except for the fact that it's so full of good things. If I make it again, I'll try substituting little olive oil for the butter, a good stock for the water and, as another reviewer suggested, will puree more of the lima beans. What I really like, though, is the idea of using pureed limas for a very quick bean soup base; I envision endless possibilities.

I added 1/3 c of rice and let it cook a little longer. Definately a keeper.

Neat! Very easy to make. No the limas are not too hard, providing you thaw them first. Mustard greens were not available to me so I used rabe. I also doubled the garlic and threw in a diced carrot for contrast(next time I'll dice up a red pepper as well).

To add to the previous question regarding cooking time... Unless the writers believe that I will spend 12 minutes chopping onion, there is a substantial amount of the prep time omitted in the recipe. The time alloted states 25 minutes, but only 13 minutes are given in the directions. Can anyone comment???

-Just curious, before I prepare this: aren't the baby limas (the other 2 cups) which have been cooked only ~6 minutes rather HARD? Please don't mistake this question as a preference for vegetables cooked old-style SOFT. But I've not prepared baby limas without cooking them a good bit more (15-20 mins. total). As I said, -just curious.

Even though it is usually a challenge to like mustard greens, this was delicious! I wouldn't change anything except perhaps using fresh lima beans if I had them, but most everything was in my pantry/freezer as listed. Simple to make, nutritious, fast and just as good left-over. I served with sauteed mushrooms & onions, fresh tomatoes and grated Swiss cheese rolled in a tortilla. Great & tasty supper.

my husband doesn't like peas in anything. i wonder what else i could use instead of the peas???

To Traci C. from Lincoln: Fava beans are a great substitute for limas, but they're not easy to find frozen and can be a real pain to prepare fresh. But if you don't mind the fuss, try them -- I find the flavor to be smoother and the texture not as pasty. I ejoyed this recipe but omitted the mustart greens the 2nd time I made it and instead added a bit of chopped fresh mint and a couple tablespoons of cream. Really nice. :-) MCW

I really liked this soup. It was great with ham added and I used collard greens instead of the mustard greens.

to the reader looking for a substitute for lima beans - try frozen blackeye peas - excellent!

I thought this was a yummy, "quick fix" dinner (I served the soup with crusty bread & a tomato/cucumber/dill salad). I do have a question though - what could I use INSTEAD of or as part of the lima beans?? My husband & I aren't huge fans of lima beans (although this recipe does a good job of masking their waxy flavor) - and I'd like to try the recipe again with something else. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :0)

this soup is totally easy to make and seriously delish! it's vegetarian, full of vitamins (mustard greens), and is basically fat free! with a description like that it sounds like it should be pretty bland, but it's really tasty! the only thing i altered was the amount of lima beans i pureed- approx. 1 1/2 cups, instead of 1. be sure to use a blender. i didn't get the creamy texture i wanted with the food processor. i love cooking healthy but won't sacrifice flavor, so this recipe is a def. a keeper!
