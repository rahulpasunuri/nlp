Was a little on the salty side, but delicious. We decided next time we made it, we'd double the garlic, as there was little discernible garlic flavor. Vegetarians: We had this with a roasted beet, avocado, and arugula salad, and it was an awesome meal.

Wonderful. Used a little more egg mixture as Lebanon recommended, and also used sourdough instead of rye (have some picky eaters to please). We loved this dish, though it had, in the version I ended up making, more of a breakfast feeling.

Followed the directions and found it too dry to the taste. Modifications would be to double the egg mixture and use much less of the rye bread, covering most of the bread with the egg mixture as well as baking for only 25 minutes. With those changes plus adding more garlic/chives this will be wonderful!

I've been looking for this recipe for years, since frequent moves finally compelled me to abandon my old magazine. My mistake was to search under "stuffing," instead of "bread." I made these puddings and a other variations on the theme for Thanksgiving the year after they appeared in print. Really, you could always add some of your favorite stuffing ingredients. I was thinking of using chestnuts, carmelized onions, and rosemary this year. The simple rye-and-garlic formula is fool proof.
