I followed the recipe to a T, with only one minor tweak: 1/4 c chopped crystallized ginger added along with the raisins and nuts. These hermit bars were delightful! With the added crystallized ginger, they were sweet enough and needed no glaze. If I made them without adding the crystallized ginger, I could see how some folks might like a simple glaze on top, too.

Not bad, but not what I was hoping for. I, too, wanted that denser, chewier hermit cookie of childhood, but, alas, this was NOT it. I used orange flavored dried cranberries, currants and the orange icing (MORE than sweet enough) and was generous with the fruit and walnuts. If I make them again, I'll cut back on the nutmeg and add a bit more cinnamon. Wish I knew how to make them chewier!

OMG these are incredible! Use a good quality cinnamon and increase, substitute groung ginger for the cloves and increase a bit, add about 3-5 TBS crystallized ginger minced and bake 18 minutes. I cut in 12 squares and they are melt in your mouth perfect!

@hobbywizard Do you mean the Cheese and Stuff in Simsbury, outside of Htfd? maybe theyre similar, if different spots... These work better with large crystals of baking sugar, they really need the texture and the sweetness. Sprinkle moderately on top of the batter before baking.

This is a great recipe. The resulting hermit is just like the ones I used to get at Cheese n Stuff (think Whole Foods without the weird CEO) in Hartford back in the 90s - dense, chewy, strongly spiced. I substituted ground ginger for the cloves cos I was out of cloves, and I left out the nuts cos CnS didn't have nuts in theirs. Otherwise, I kept to the recipe and loved the result. 3.5 stars

Made these hermits exactly as written and received raves from my husband. They freeze well and can actually be eaten right from the freezer. Yum!

These are the Hermit bars from my childhood - chewy, spicy, and rich! I added 1/4t ginger. The first time, I probably overbeat a little and cooked in a 9X9 pan for 25 minutes but they were deliciously thick and chewy. The second time I barely beat in the flour and used a 9X13 for 20 minutes. Again, rich and chewy. Everyone keeps asking me to make them again. (Better if you let them cool.)

I added a handful of chopped dates - probably about a half a cup - and a teaspoon of instant coffee. Then, instead of baking them in a pan, I made individual cookies out of the dough and baked for only ten minutes. I also tripled the entire recipe and got about 6 dozen cookies out of it. They came out WONDERFUL. The dates basically dissolved and made the cookies moist and chewy.

I thought this came out yummy. I did however tweek the recipe a bit. I added some vanilla and baked it in a 9x9 pan for 17 min. A little thicker and chewy.

My grandmother made these all of the time and I loved them. Everyone is talking about them missing something like a glaze. Try a cream cheese icing, that is how we always finish them and it is great.

I wasn't wild about them. They definately needed something. I would start by adding more raisins and nuts but I think it would need something for moisture. I can see why people thought it needed a glaze.

I thought this recipe was great! I've never eaten Hermits before, but based on the way they smelled (and my whole house too, as they cooked) I had to try them. They were so soft and tasted like an awesome gingerbread cake! I left out the nuts and didn't have cloves. I actually ended up putting in 2/3C raisins because I accidentally used the wrong measuring cup for my second batch - the result: they came out thicker and even better! I would certainly make them again - co-workers raved about them today! I would suggest trying the craisins and some kind of glaze (although mine didnt need a glaze, but maybe it would make them even better?). I cooked for exactly 15 min. (my oven runs pretty hot!) and they were just perfect. They cut well, look great, smell to die for and made me a Hermit lover!! Simple to make, try them!

I made this after reading all the reviews, and did double the nuts and raisens, added some left over chopped dates from another recipe, and added 1 C diced cyrstalized ginger. When cool compleletly I then made a simple brown sugar glaze and generously covered the top with more chopped cystalized ginger. Don't over bake..These were really very satisfying and yummy !

I thought these were chewy. I used a slightly larger pan to cook them in, only for about 12-13 minutes. They were very thin, and difficult to get spread out in the pan. I substituted crasins for the nuts. Plenty sweet without frosting. Noone raved over these, however.

These cookies, although simple to make, lacked the childhood memories of what hermit bars meant to me. My suggestion would be to add more nuts and raisens and bake less for a more chewy affect rather than cake like.

Wonderful aroma. Flavor improves after a day or so. Very good texture.

Good, spicy bar. I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. I also frosted the bars after they were cooled with a butter icing flavored with grated orange grind. The bars are not very sweet and the orange icing perks them up a bit.
