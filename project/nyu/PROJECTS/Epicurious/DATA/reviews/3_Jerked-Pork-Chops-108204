This was OK, but not even close to the Jerked Ribs I made last week with essentially the same combination of spices. I'll set this one aside for now.

I made this dish for a friends bday dinner and it was a huge hit. Some of us are not into the hot spice so I subed the scotch bonnet for half of a hot pepper and diced up extras for those who like alot of spice. Served it with the chutney which was exotic and a beautiful compliment to the pork. We will definatley make this again. Bon apetit!

Great recipe--I've made it many times with pork tenderloin on the grill

This was close, but not a repeater. There are too many things to correct here. I certainly was not a fan of this recipe.

Feel free to omit peppers from the recipe without changing the integrity. Needs a little more salt. Overall delicious.

I used the marinade on spareribs and then put them on the BBQ. It was actually fairly quick since I had all the ingredients. I just tossed them into the food processor.
