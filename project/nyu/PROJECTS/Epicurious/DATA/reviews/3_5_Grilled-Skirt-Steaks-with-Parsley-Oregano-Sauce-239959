This sauce is so good I wanted to put it on everything. I don't prefer the skirt steak, so I used the leftover sauce on a strip steak. So good

amazing it came out a bit lime-y for me at 1st, so I added in about a tbsp of honey to cute the tartness flavor explosion

The sauce is pretty good, but I wasn't 'wowed' by it. At times I felt the lime overpowered, but overall, pretty tasty.

Perfect. Just perfect.

This was very delicious steak. However, I would reduce the amount of olive oil in the sauce next time so that the other flavors will pop out more. Overall, yummy!

This was ok, but there was something lacking. Maybe if it was just the beer, or just the herbs, together they just weren't a hit for us.

Excellent, flavorful, and simple summer dish. What took Americans so long to discover the thrill of skirt steak?

This was super easy and really good. The sauce tastes very Argentinian and is really fabulous.

Another simple marinade for skirt steak: equal parts red wine, soy sauce, light olive oil, with a couple crushed cloves of garlic and some sliced onion. YUM.

Delicious, easy recipe. I used ribeyes instead of skirt steak and it turned out excellent. I doubled the garlic, as did another user- much more flavor.

Great sauce! Very quick and easy to make. Of course my market was out of Skirt Steak so I used the old stand-by Filet.

My family really liked this recipe. I doubled the garlic. it was a nice quick meal with rice and corn.

I served this over the weekend and there wasn't a bite left on any one's plate. My only comment on this recipe is the serving size. I would recommend at least 1 1/2 lbs of skirt steak for 4 servings.

The sauce is INSANE. I drizzled it on everything for a few days afterward. Really tasty.

Sauce is fantastic. It is the star here. Steak is an aside. Use it on many things, not just the steak. And yes, it is 1 1/2 pounds of steak. I almost made that mistake too!

I thought it was delicious. Didn't have a lime so I used lemon juice. It was a nice summer day so my husband grilled the steak on the bbq.

Here's a great marinade for skirt steak: 1/4 cup soy sauce, 3T steak sauce, 2T lime juice, 2T packed brown sugar, 1T grated ginger root, 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tsp sesame oil, 1/4 tsp black pepper. Throw it all in a ziploc bag with the meat, let it sit 1-2 hours (or longer - can even go overnight) then grill. It makes great leftovers tossed with a salad, too.

Way too much lime juice. What ingredient can you add to counteract too much tartness from lime juice?

Very quick and easy to make with very few ingredients. I used 1/2 cup parsley and 1/2 cup cilantro, although parsley is more traditional.

I was just thinking the same thing...What would be a good marinate for the skirt steak?

To cook from Nevada; I've only ever used skirt steak in a casserole so I like the idea of marinating first as I'm sure it would be too tough to grill otherwise. Do I marinate in sauce ingredients?

Punctuation error. Should be one and a half pound skirt steak, 1 1/2 lbs. NOT 1 half pound skirt steak for 4 people.

As good as this is, you would be wise and quite happy if you should choose to marinate skirt steak for about 2 hours, regardless of recipe; skirt steak blows away flank after marinating and is just about half the price!
