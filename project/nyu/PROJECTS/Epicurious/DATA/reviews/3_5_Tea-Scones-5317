I grew up with European-type scones like these, but they were much heavier. These are light and cakey on the inside and golden and crunchy on the outside. Delicate and subtle in flavour. Perfect with Earl Grey tea. Ridiculously easy to make.

These are delicious--but take note, as BRITISH scones, they are quite different from the American variety: less sweet (normally eaten with jam and cream), much lighter and fluffier, and it feels less oily. I definitely prefer these to the American scones, but in any case, you'd want to be aware of what you're getting. I normally add zest from two lemons, and substitute honey (added w/ liquid ingredients) for the sugar. I also make 24 mini scones, rather than one big round.

This was ok but a bit plain. I changed the recipe (quite a bit) and liked it much better: 1)used regular all purpose flour 2)added 1 tsp of vanilla extract 3)added 1 cup dried fruit (apricots) 4)added 1/2 cup of chestnuts 5)added 1 tsp cinnamon

I've made this in the food processor, with good results. I've also used these to make Strawberry Shortcake instead of the traditional biscuit. Brushed tops with cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar - the kids loved these.

I've had this recipe since it first appeared in the magazine. It duplicates the recipe for the scones that the Dorchester Hotel in London serves for afternoon tea. These are not dry, crumbly scones but more delicate and cake-like as the recipe states. I make this in an 8" round cake pan rather than patting it into a round on a baking sheet.

I changed this a bit and used buttermilk instead of milk. They were really yummy with peach jam. My friends think I am a gourmet cook thanks to epicurious.com!

These are delicious! I did need to add more flour as the dough was very sticky. I doubled the recipe and cut them out with a 2" cookie cutter (for a baby shower) and ended up with 32 total. For a special treat top with Devonshire cream and a strawberry half, wonderful!

I've never made scones before and found this to be very easy and tasty. I've made them several times. I found it needed more milk than flour. I didn't go to all the cutting trouble; just separated them into eight balls and folded blackberries into them. They probably weren't traditional looking but were very good and I've made them several times.

Really easy to make but dough very sticky and i needed to add lots more flour in the rolloing out stage. fairly light and yummy though once done.

I had never made scones before, and found this recipe to be very simple, but had to add extra flour as I found the dough to be very sticky. I split the dough into two sections, and added chunks of chocolate to one, and fresh dried strawberries to the other...they were fantastic!

It was my first time making scones and these were easy. They came out nice not to dry. Very good!

I had to use this recipe for a school project, so obviously I'm no master chef, but this was SO easy! I made enough for a class of about 45 people, and every batch was perfect. Try spreading a thin layer of honey over the top if you want something a little sweeter, but these are great with or without it!

Easy to make and delicious, I was surprised by how simple it was to make. I had to cook it a little longer than 20 minutes and have added slivered almonds or lemon glaze as toppings and it tasted even better.

These scones could be better if orange or lemon zest were to be added.
