I have to agree with Colleen. This is the 1st time I have panned a recipe. I was going to try this for a dinner and I am happy I tested it first. Unexceptional at best.

A winter storm and cancelled dinner party left me with a lot of pork tenderloin, so I'm trying a few new recipes. This one is so easy, but, on this rare occasion, I disagree with my fellow epicureans. I thought the sauce was unexceptional. Didn't do the compote based on the ratings. My stone cold from the refrigerator pork was done in 4 minutes a side--just very slightly pink in the middle. I wouldn't do this one again.

This was fantastic! Thanks for the suggestion of buying pre-chopped fruit. It saved a lot of time and was very tasty. Our friends raved over it, they thought I had slaved away all day for it! :)

Can anyone please let me know if I can substitute the pork with beef medallions as my family doesn't eat pork. Thank you.

Wonderful and easy. Remember to not crowd tenderloin slices in the pan or they won't brown well. The sauce is fabulous and the fruit compote a tasty accompaniment.

De-lish! Followed recipe exactly, with dried fruit compote (mixed bag of fruit-don't think the fruit mix matters all that much, as long as you have a colorful mix), and it was a big hit. The compote is sweet, but a nice compliment to the pork. served with homemade applesauce, bliss potatoes with olive oil and rosemary, and asparagus. very colorful. could not get the sauce to thicken in 5 minutes, may try it longer next time, but it was yummy anyway. One note- I cooked Pork for 5 minutes each side, and tented under foil. It was well done. May undercook a bit, and let it sit next time, I was just worried about undercooking, but I think 4 minutes a side would do the trick. Enjoy!

The pork preparation is intoxicatingly delicious and shamefully easy. I allow the sauce to reduce for closer to 15 minutes, and do not add any flour. The fruit compote is neither here nor there; it does nothing to complement the shallot calvados sauce and is not in itself a very interesting or tasty preparation.

This is a wonderful, and easy dish to prepare. I also served it with pecan wild rice - yum! The sauce didn't thicken up (and I used heavy cream), so be sure to add flour. We loved the dried fruit compote as well. Thanks for the suggestion of serving it with ice cream and shortbread.

A very tasty, elegant dish!! Very easy to prepare! Next time I will add 3 T flour after sauteing the shallots to make a roux--the sauce did not thicken-up, as previously noted. Both my husband and I thought that the the compote did not go at all with this dish, albeit delicious. I will use the compote for a fall dinner, serving it with vanilla ice cream and homemade shortbread.

Have made this twice so far. It is one of the best pork dishes I've ever made. Takes less than an hour. First time I followed the recipe to a "t" except I subbed dried apples for the pears in the compote. The Calvados and cream are super in the pork sauce- it reduced down to a thick, richly-textured treat with the full fat in there! The second time I didn't have a whole cup of cream so I subbed half with lowfat buttermilk. It gave the sauce an interesting, tangy twist that paired well with the shallots. Quite good, either way. Will make this again and again.

An excellent recipe for entertaining. To save time spent in the kitchen, I lightly browned the medallions, then placed them covered, in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350. Result was great, and meat remained tender. Did have trouble getting the Calvados sauce to thicken, however, once accompanied by the dried fruit compote, you didn't notice. Served with pecan wild rice, roasted acorn squash with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and steamed peas. Colors and flavors were great together. Delicious!

Very tasty and easy to make.

The combination of the pork with the fruit was fantastic. Easy to make. The shallots are essential. Made way too much sauce. I used regular cream instead of whipping cream - sauce was a bit thin. Served with crisp snap peas and rice - a perfect meal.

Great flavors. We made this for a family gathering and received rave reviews. We paired it with wild rice pilaf w/mushrooms and steamed asparagus. Delicious. We will definitely make this again, perhaps with more apple brandy the second time around.

This was a big hit with everybody. They all enjoyed seconds. The dried fruit compote was fantastic. I used brandy rather than calvados and dried apples instead of the prunes. I also substitued white wine over the brandy called for in the shallot sauce. The dish was fantastic and received rave reviews from everybody. Will make it again for certain!

I tried to reduce the fat by using evaporated skim milk instead of whipping cream, and I think the sauce suffered because of it (too thin). Also, I'm not sure there was enough Calvados in the sauce -- it didn't seem "apple-y" enough. However, we really liked the way the fruit compote blended with the sauce (I didn't use pears or prunes in the compote -- substituted apples and peaches, and increased the apricots). We will try it again

This was good. It was pretty easy to make. However, I couldn't find Calvados anywhere so I used Brandy instead. I think it would've been much better with the Calvados. Still would make again though.
