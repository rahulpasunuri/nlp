Fast, easy and delicious! My modifications: 1/2 c. olive oil, 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. 10 minutes cooking time was plenty. We will definitely do again. This recipe would make a good party dish as well.

Total crowd-pleaser! So easy to prepare and delicious!

This was probably the best prawn recipe ever. I usually overdo my prawns, and they come out dry. Even when I soak them with garlic, they just don't have that restaurant flavor. But this recipe, with lots of garlic and lime, and placed in the oven, is the answer. It is now the only prawn recipe for guests.

I added red pepper flakes as suggested. Used kosher salt. Cut prep time even more by using chopped garlic from a jar (10 tsp). Reduced olive oil to 1/2 cup. Garnished with chopped parsley. Served with brown rice that was cooked in chicken and wine broth with a side of steamed peas.

I found that this recipe really improved when I added a teaspoon of lime zest and a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes!

Awesome, easy and fast way to cook shrimp! I tried the authors recipe for Brazilian Seafoof Stew and that has become a staple in our home as will this recipe!

This is a terrific easy to prepare crowd pleaser. I have been preparing this dish for at least two years now. Fool proof and delicious!

I marinated the shrimp in the fresh squeezed lime juice, garlic, and olive oil for about 20 minutes, then grilled the shrimps ona skewer for about 6 - 7 minutes per side. It was a nice and light accompaniment to garlic grilled halibut and summer greens. I'll make it again when I'm in a hurry, grilling, and have the ingredients at hand. I probably won't plan for it, though.

All of the sudden I had a LOT of limes! The hubby brought some home. I brought some home... I used the juice of an entire lime, about 3-4 tablespoons of good olive oil and whatever garlic cloves I had, maybe 8-10? I tried using scallops and was dissapointed. Scallops really need to be broiled or pan seared... they turned out poached and kind of spongey. The sauce was good and not too oily! I WILL try this again, but with shrimp.

I don't know about this one...certainly not a bad tasting dish, but not very interesting. Needs more lime and less oil and probably a bit less garlic...

This is so easy and it't great with angel hair pasta and topped with feta cheese

I can think of better things to do with $16 worth of shrimp. Even in a hurry. Cut back on the olive oil.

Absolutely delicious! The shrimp were so flavorful & perfectly done (I checked them after 10 min and they needed the extra 5). I can't wait to make this again.

We loved this one. My boyfriend is trying the low-carb diet so I used it as a side dish. Next time I will double the sauce, it was the best part.

Although simple and easy, this makes for a delicious dinner. It's one of my wife's favorite shrimp dishes. However, I really see no point in leaving the shells on before cooking - the sauce is delicious over rice anyway.

Not a special recipe. The best part of the meal with the sourdough bread served with the shrimp.

I thought this was a great light and low fat recipe. I also put it over angel hair pasta and I had clean plates all around. I would cut back a bit on the soy sauce, and I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic. Also, the prawns cook fast so be careful about over cooking them or they will get a bit too chewy. (Tip: It takes 4 limes to get half a cup of lime juice.) I might double the sauce next time just to have more to put over the pasta.

Too greasy and really nothing special, sort of bland.

It is messy to eat, but this is a great recipe. I have made it numerous times and everyone loves it. Use a good olive oil and some crusty bread for dipping.

Loved it. Make sure to leave the shells on. Reduce the greasiness by reducing the olive oil to half a cup and add a half a cup of white wine, chopped tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Crusty bread is the for dipping.

I wasn't that impressed with it, I agree with the previous reviewer about the greasiness. On the plus side, it was very simple and quick. I probably won't make this again.

What's the big deal? It tasted like a pile of greasy shrimp with garlic? If you want a real thrill then try the garlic shrimp at Giovanni's Shrimp Truck on the North Shore of Oahu or Killer Shrimp in the L.A. area. Now that's good eating!

Very tasty recipe. Delicious as a main course tossed with Cappellini or Rotini pasta, and broiled asparagus as the side dish.

A definite keeper! We used peeled shrimp w/tails, as did some previous reviewers, and served over couscous. Delicious! Next time, however, we'll try unpeeled and in bowls as per the recipe; the sauce -- much more delicate than you'd imagine -- is made for dipping with a good, crusty bread.

Quick, easy and delicious all in one little recipe...what more could you want?! My suggestion would be to leave the shells on as the recipe suggests. When cooked in the shells you get a lot of extra flavor plus the cooking time is perfect. (peeling them yourself as you eat and sucking all that delicious lime/garlic from the shells as you go along is wonderful! Reminds me a bit of the way we cook and eat our barbecued shrimp down south here) A little french bread for dipping and you will be in heaven!!

I made this for my boyfriend and his family (no pressure!) and it was fantastic. I peeled the shrimp (except for the tails) and they came out perfectly. We had a tough time with side dishes, and ended up with broccoli, which was nice-- but this was a stand alone meal!

Super, and a big hit with my family! I had lots of limes in the house so used quite a bit more lime juice and a little less olive oil. I also used shrimp without shells (that's all they had in the market.) I served it with pasta with pesto but would love to see more side dish suggestions. It did take the full 15 minutes in my oven and it came out quite yummy! The shrimp were tender and full of flavor, especially when topped with an extra squeeze of lime juice. I'll be making this one again, especially if I can think of some more creative accompaniments!

Yum! Yum! I have not the slightest idea how to cook shrimp, but this turned out grrrreeeaaat! I think that the cook time is a bit long because my shrimp could have been a bit more tender - 10 minutes would probablly due. Great with the asperagus with a lemon / scallion sauce!

This was FANTASTIC!! I followed the recipe except I took the shells off of the shrimp. I was worried it would be really greasy because of all the olive oil, but it wasn't. The shrimp was so full of flavor!! I served it over steamed rice with green beans. I can't wait to make it again!!!

Baked sauce was great drizzled over steamed rice, and with crusty french bread. A great, messy, family meal.

This is just wonderful. I served it over pasta and in my oven it took the full 15 minutes. It should be stirred while baking. I'll make it again and again.

Really good and really easy. I peeled the shrimp first, and served mine over plain pasta. My husband likes richer food, so served his over pasta alfredo. Both of us loved it!

Easy to make and very tasty. Luckily I only baked the shrimp ten minutes and then I checked them - 10 minutes would have been too long!?!?
