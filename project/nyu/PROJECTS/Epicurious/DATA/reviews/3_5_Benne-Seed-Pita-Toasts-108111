I thought these were great, and went very well with the crab and artichoke dip, with which they originally appeared. It's a little tricky to get the seeds to adhere to the bread, but it will work eventually. Since pita tends to have one thin side and one thick side, they do brown unevenly--10 minutes was just right. This will give you a little variety in the chips, but I thought that made it interesting.

I found that all the seeds fell off if the pita was too crisp

I thought this was delicous. I used celery seeds instead of benne and it turned out perfect. Defiantly a keeper.

Easy to make and a big hit! Can be served with many kinds of dip. I served with a hot crab dip and they were delicious. Definitely will make again.

I'm sorry but I just couldnt get these to crisp up consistantly. Some were crispy throughout, some with soft and crispy and some were just soft! I think the application of the cornstarch-butter is critical. A bit time consuming for the mediocre payoff

I made it for a holiday cocktail party, I served it with hummos, everyone loved it. I used less salt (1/2tsp.), watch the cooking time, the first batch it was overdone, the second batch took less than 4 minutes in the oven, I guess it depends on the thickness of the pita bread. I am making it again this week.

These are really awesome!! I had to make two batches because I kept snacking on the first one!

I made these toasts for Mother's Day to accompany the crab dip, and they were very good. As another poster warned, watch for the cook time, as they get VERY browned if not watched accurately.

Just an FYI for the previous reviewer: benne is an alternative name for sesame seeds. It's sometimes used in the South.

I had my doubts about this recipe because of the cornstarch and sesame seed mixture, but it turned out pretty tasty. Just watch out for the cooking time...they brown very quickly. Still not sure what "benne" means but they were perfect with my spinach and artichoke dip!
