I agree with other reviewers that this was just okay. There's another rice wine vinegar based slaw on this site that is tons better- wish I'd saved it to my recipe box. I felt the chile pepper was overkill and blasted the ginger, vinegar and sesame oil flavors. I will not make this again.

I did a combination of bok choy and savoy cabbage. Used Mirrin and not the sugar. Couldn't find snap peas at local market used carrots, red peppers, and green onions instead. Also added an extra half tablespoon of sesame oil and added sesame seeds and chopped ramen noodles. Delish.

This salad is easy and has great flavor. I reduced the recipe for 2 and made the mistake of adding too much cabbage. The result was too dry but the flavor was still there.

I added green onions and cilantro. It was a tasty compliment to blackened ahi tuna.

This was just OK... nothing particularly wrong with it... just a little boring.

Fabulous! Much better than expected! Goes perfectly with the sweeter taste of BBQ'd meats. Everyone gobbled this up!

For a quick, low caloric salad to complement an Asian meal, this slaw will suffice. However, it does not stack up well against several others in my rotation, namely Corky's slaw or bacon slaw.

I love this recipe I add carrots, cucumbers or whatever and I have used regular cabbage in place of savoy and it was delish!

I've made this about a gajillion times for BBQs. It's fast and easy to make and it looks nice and tastes good. What more could you want? I usually include an entire bell pepper, just to add a bit more contrast with the peas and cabbage.

This slaw is in the rotation. If you are lazy like me you can forget the snow peas and pepper and just use cabbage.

I think you can add the vinaigrette up to an hour before serving.

this was ok... i wish it had been more flavorful. if you like spice, i recommend tripling the chili and ginger

This was so delicious - way better than any "slaw" I've tasted before. I made the recipe exactly as written, only I used Thai chilis as that is what I had on hand. The slight spiciness made a wonderful contrast with the cabbage and other ingredients. I would be careful about dressing the slaw too far ahead, however, as it definitely wilted (as it was supposed to). It could get rather soggy if left too long. This recipe is a great accompaniment to any stir fry dish.

Excellent salad. Good asian flavor. I added carrots, snow peas, red peppers and green onions and it tasted great.

This slaw was an instant hit with my friends on a dinner hike last summer, I have made it several times since as it is an easy and colorful salad to whip up; plus it is so good!

We like spicy so I added more chile and ginger. This was very good. Used extra red bell pepper also. My son's girlfriend doesn't even like slaws or cabbage and she ate two helpings and asked for the recipe. I served this with salmon baked with a honey glaze - great combo

Spicy & crunchy! Very refreshing flavor. I also added baby carrots (matchstick cut) which added a nice color and sprinkled on some toasted sesame seeds. I served with a shrimp stir-fry and egg rolls for an easy dinner. Next time I'll try adding a little green onion and serve it with a teriyaki-marinated BBQ chicken/steak.

use half napa and half saoy cabbage and add hot chinese mustard. this is a good solid oriental slaw, use your imagination, this is a great foundation!
