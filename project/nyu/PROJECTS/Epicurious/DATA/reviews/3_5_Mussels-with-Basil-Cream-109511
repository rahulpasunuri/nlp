Delicious dish! To simplify, I pureed the basil and cream together and then poured over the mussels and served it out of my 6 qt red Dutch oven. Everything stayed nice and hot. It was a fun communal way to serve mussels at a dinner party.

This recipe is divine. One suggestion for improvement: before pouring the basil cream over the mussels, reheat it. It's a bit too cold as-is. Delicious with bread to sop up the cream, it would be even better over angel hair pasta.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's easy to make, and very tasty. I didn't put the cream and basil mixture in the blender, but instead mixed it in a bowl with the butter sauce from the mussels, and then put it all back in the pot and let simmer. It was awesome!

This dish was amazing and soooo easy. I followed the previous suggestions to use shallots instead of the onion and thought it helped add a lot of flavor. I used plain old white cooking wine, and it worked fine. I will be making this again and again!

This was a great dish. Everyine loved it and wanted more. The second time I made it, I used shallots instead of onions and it was even better.

Serious bang for your buck. This came together beautifully with just a few simple ingredients and was a fitting hurrah to the end of my summer basil. Have lots of bread on hand for dipping.

This is delicious if made exactly to the recipe. Yesterday I doubled the recipe for four main courses and it really serves six. I served it with a crusty french bread to soak up the basil cream. My guests were duly impressed and said it was excellent.

This recipe has the great attribute of being highly adaptable. I've tried it Western style as written and Southeast Asian style. For the steaming liquid I used 2 shallots, the garlic, the inner meaty parts of 2 stalks of lemongrass and dry white vermouth to up the herbal flavor. I stir-fried these savories in cocount cream, the stuff that floats on top of a can of coconut milk. I steamed this for 8 minutes. I removed the mussels from the pot and added the remainder of the can of cocount milk and then substituted Thai basil for Italian basil and 1 T. of fish sauce. I returned the liquid to simmer and buzzed it in the blender. It came out a beautiful light green. I then put this over re-heated pre-cooked udon. You can buy these at a well-stocked Korean or Japanese grocer. Leyered on the mussels and poured sauce over all. You can use other noodles like rice vermicelli and so on. This recipe is great as is and easily changeable.

I added more white wine and used a lighter cream. I didnt blend at the end so I put the basil in while the mussels were steaming to help get the flavor. Also, at the beginning I added about a half cup of cubed pancetta and cooked it in with the onions as I love the combination with the mussels. Changed the recipe but I think it adds a bit of meaty/smokiness

This recipe was surprisingly disappointing. It was very, very bland. I was hoping that either the buttery flavor or the wine would come through, but it didn't. I'll definately never use this recipe again.

We love this recipe! We live in Belgium, the land of mussels, and though I have plenty of Belgian recipes, I keep coming back to this one!

This was tasty, but there are mussel recipes out there I'd make before this one. Try the one with tomatoes and sherry. It is outstanding.

YUM! This was perfect! I used shallots since I had no onion. And I just used Half and Half as its all I had - and I added the wine, mussels, cream, and basil all at same time - and it came out great! I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This does not sound like a Weight Watcher's recipe. As much as I love cream, I substituted non-fat half and half! It was very tasty. We had two very generous servings at 11 points per serving. I had to be careful with my points the rest of the day--but it was worth it!

Wonderful. Next time I will double the sauce and serve the mussels over linguini. A crusty bread is a must. I also didn't blend, but might try it next time so that it coats the pasta. My husband loved it, and our guest asked for the recipe!

Made these as an appetizer for my mom's birthday (she loves mussels)and it was a HIT! I, too, chopped the basil and added it at the end (no blending)with the cream and pepper. So yummy! Don't forget the french bread to sop up the sauce.

I didn't bother with the blending and it was excellent. You have to be keen on basil obviously and it's quite rich. I would definitely make again, in smaller servings!

I bought mussels and then found this recipe. I had all of the ingredients and I loved them!! So did my guests. Definately need to soak up the sauce with some great bread. Also, this is so easy!!!!

This one is a keeper! I more than doubled the recipe for my husband and father-in-law (both are huge mussel fans) and there is just enough leftovers of the 6 lbs. for a small afternoon snack. Crusty bread a must.

It is very rich, make a big salad and serve it with crusty french bread.We loved this, just follow the recipe. I used clams not mussels because they weren't available.

i thought this was fantastic! i chopped the basil rather than do the blender deal and i threw in shallots and a few shrimp for good measure. i did not have white wine on hand so i used sherry, about half a cup. for a little more nutrition i added a cube of spinach pesto. the sauce was excellent, my only regret was not having a loaf of crusty bread.

This was FABULOUS. We expected company, that didn't arrive - and then made ourselves ill trying to eat every last wonderful bite. I minced the basil before making the sauce so no need to process it at the end. An instant favorite.

Used this simply to use up some left over mussels and I'm so glad that I stumbled upon the recipe. I doubled the sauce (adding one more garlic clove in for good measure) and served on top of linguine. Was definitely a hit and no one guessed that it was really just "left overs."

A singularly unattractive sauce - it looked like something the dog threw up after eating grass. Tasted OK, but not spectacular by any means. It was almost too easy to make and it made a lot.

Excellent and very quick. There was a lot of sauce, so I served this over linguine. My husband loved it, and has asked me to repeat.

Used shallots and did not blend the mixture, just finely chopped the basil. Turned out great.

Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, can't help it. You gotta soak up that sauce with some French bread. Yummy...so easy and so good.

Just a variation on the French Classic. Yum!!

Délicieux! J'adore le moules et le basilic. J'ai donc retrouvé dans ce met le goût que je recherchais. Bravo!
