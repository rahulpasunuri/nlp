I have a prune plum tree, and got tired of making crisps. I made this recipe with boneless chicken thighs, and it was fantastic and easy. Everybody was sad that the plums are almost gone. It was a tiny bit too sweet-- I think the plums were very sweet, next time I'll check while adding sugar.

Just finished eating my version of this. I used diced prunes as plums are out of season here. They worked great, but I was afraid of overdosing us with prune "roughage" so I strained the sauce out of the pan. I also used Chinese 5 spice and that worked well. We both liked it a lot, but the flavor was a bit mild. I am going to try more garlic. I already used twice as much as called for. I also want to find a hot spice to make it more dynamic. All in all, I will be working on this recipe a bit more.

I was inundated with plums this year so I tried this out. OMG! I will buy plums to make this again. Everyone who tried it loved it. I used it on chicken too. Definitely a keeper.

REALLY good! I cooked the chops for as long as the recipe stated. No problems, resulted in moist chops. I used purple plums and the chinese 5 spice powder as another reviewer suggested. No Anise. These were so good (and easy), I'm making them for dinner tomorrow night for 8 guests. I'll serve them with potato anna, and brussel sprouts. YUMMY.

Delicious! Exactly followed the recipe ingredients, using the anise seeds. Cooked bone-in thick pork chops for only 30 minutes, & came out moist & juicy. Longer cooking would have dried & toughened them in my experience.

This dish impressed my "not really a pork chop kinda person" guest, so I'd definitely make it again. I cooked two pork chops, each in a different pot, and thus was able to experiment with the recipe to get the best possible results. The result? A "good" pork chop and a GREAT one. (Of course I gave my guest the great one!) 2 things I learned: cook this in a small sauce pan with a well fitted lid. Cook for 35, not 50 minutes on medium-low heat. Other non-intentional changes I made were substituting plum tomatoes for the plums, adding 2 tbsp of orange juice to the sauce, substituing chopped dill for the anise, and adding 1 tbsp of vinegar instead of 2, and another tbsp of cooking wine. Finally, it is good to flip the chops half way through.

sauce was overwhelmingly strong. i brined the pork and after the initial searing, i cooked it in the sauce for only 5-10 minutes. it was incredibly tender. i will make the recipe again and cut down on the soy and star anise, also maybe add some wine to dilute.

I found the soy and ginger a little bit harsh in flavor, with the end-effect being something a bit like hoisin sauce.

I've made this several times replacing the pork chops with thick veal chops...HUGE hit! I agree with using black plums, but try to get them not overly-ripe...

I loved this sauce! I also used black plums in place of Italian prune plums. The rest I followed to the letter. I was hoping braising the chops on very low heat for such a long time would yield a tender product. Alas I was mistaken, they were very tough. The next time I will follow the suggestions of others here and watch them carefully to prevent over cooking. Never the less definatly worth a second try.

I really enjoyed this dish! I love anything that tastes great and is so simple to make. I used boneless pork chops that didn't take as long to cook, but it didn't seem to hurt the flavor at all. I jacked up the ginger and the garlic a little bit, also didn't have anise seeds, so I used a teaspoon of Chinese five-spice powder. I also couldn't find Italian plums, so I used black ones. If I change anything for next time, it would be to dice up the plums instead of quartering them, since my chops didn't need to go the whole 50 minutes.

This was very nice....but be CAREFUL not to overcook the pork. I cooked it 30 min and it was very tough, so check it with a thermometer. I also used fennel seeds instead of anise, and black plums instead of the italian prunes, and the flavor was great. I'm making it again for folks tonight.

I made this for the first time last evening. It came out great. I could not find Italian Prune Plums, but I did manage to buy a jar a plain prune plums. Very tasty, and the dish was moist as well. I served it over brown rice..........

Yum yum. My family, including an opinionated 21-year-old, loved this dish. I made it with fresh Italian plums from the trees in our yard. They supplied plenty of moisture. We particularly liked the taste of the garlic and ginger with the plums. When plums are in season, I'll make this for a dinner party.

This dish deserves its good reviews. I didn't have pork chops so I used a small piece (1/2 lb.) of pork tenderloin - I was cooking for two people. I was very careful not to overcook the pork. I did make the full amount of sauce and was glad I did - most of it went. I plan to make this every year when prune plums are in season.

A gorgeous combination of flavors and aromas. Goes really very well with couscous. The only problem I found was that there wasn't enough sauce after the reduction and this dish would probably taste even better if it had more moisture to it. But it's a hit!

Gorgeous aroma, easy, delicious. Used canned prune plums as suggested. Worked beautifully. Important to turn the chops over as suggested. Forgot to get fresh ginger so used powdered. OK but will definitely try fresh next time. Served with the Tomato and sugar snap pea stir fry.

I made this during a power outage over a gas stove by candlelight, and it still turned out well! I substituted regular pitted prunes for plums and honey for brown sugar. I also added roasted minced walnuts, which added a wonderful nutty flavor and texture.

I've served this a half dozen times since 1997 for dinner parties up to 15 people, it always comes out perfect and people always rave. When plums are out of season you may substitute those large Chilean grapes - the taste is very similar. A great side dish is steamed kale with kalamata olives and feta. The sharp and bitter taste complements the pork dish quite well. I just prepared this dish last weekend for a very nice man from Dallas and it's true, the way to a man's heart is definitely through his stomach! He can't wait to come back and visit me.

I've made this recipe several times and just love it. I used to have a yard with several plum trees and this was a savory way to use them.

Easier/faster than it appears- prune plums not available so I used a can, well-drained. Chops cooked in 35 min, not 50, and I'd suggest turning them halfway thru so the sauce equally soaks both sides. Terrific taste, and served over rice no sauce is wasted!
