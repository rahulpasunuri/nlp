Blah? I don't think so. I used a good spicy salami from the Italian market and the second time I used speck (smoked prosciutto). I used the Comte cheese (pricey, you can sub in a Gruyere) and I added a bit more fresh ricotta (3/4 cup). No sogginess and amazing taste! Our favorite spring asparagus tart so far! I could eat the entire tart! YUM!

I've made this a number of times and never had a problem with sogginess. Maybe this is because instead of steaming the asparagus I quickly saute over fairly high heat so that it gets slightly charred in places but remains al dente. I also do not soak in ice water (just don't overcook it and it's fine). Then I also just skip the step of tossing the asparagus tips with olive oil. It's delicious and disappears quickly every time!

Very easy and looks nice. I would probably make for a party. As a main course, we almost finished it between 2 people. I used Reg Parm b/c I had it.

Perfect for special occasions - bridal, baby shower, etc. Absolutely fantastic.

Made this for friends and it is fabulous. I used gruyere because I had it on hand. It does have a lot of filling but the result couldn't have been better. I cut off 2-inch asparagus tips and had too many to use all of them on the top. I was worried about the middle being soggy but it was not. I think you need to bake this in the middle of the oven or the bottom third. I acutally served this as a side dish but it would be a good for a brunch or first course.

I liked this recipe, but I probably would not make it again. I thought that the flavor combinations were delicious separately, but all together it just didn't work for me. It was almost too much asparagus. Maybe I wouldn't add the asparagus into the ricotta mixture. I also had a problem with the middle of the puff pastry being too soft.

This was easy to make and came out great. I didn't have problems with mushiness in the center like other reviewers have mentioned. I added onions and used proscuitto instead of salami. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written.

Yummy flavors (I added onions). But puff pastry way to gooey in the middle. Next time I'll pre-bake the crust.

The flavors of this tart were yummy. But my pastry ended up very soggy in the middle. Next time I'll tinfoil the edges and pre-bake to make sure its crisp throughout.

Simple ingredients make this delicious tart a winner. It's perfect for those who feel like a quiche is too heavy. I made a few changes to the original recipe. I sauteed 1/4 cup grilled sliced onions and 2 sliced garlic cloves. When transparent, I added fresh baby spinach and let it wilt, adding a small amount of sea salt and freshly ground pepper (I like layering salt and pepper at every step so I use very little at a time until my dish is complete). Let this cool and then add to mixture when recipe calls for the salami. oh ... I also omitted the salami and added 3 slices of cooked chopped bacon. Great breakfast, snack, lunch or dinner!

I love the flavors in this tart. I made it a couple of times as written with gruyere. I decided to try it as an appetizer for my son's first birthday party. I used mini phyllo cups and filled them with the same ingredients. They were awesome and disappeared quickly with great compliments.

I love this recipe. I've made it three times since it came out and loved it both times. I have served it as a dinner and as an appetizer for a dinner party. It is equally good without the soppressata if you have any vegetarians that need to be accommodated ... but if not, the salami is a killer touch.

Very good and easier than I thought! I couldn't find Comte so I used some swiss and cheddar I had at home - turned out great!

Very good. Easy weeknight meal. Could use swiss or gruyere in the place of comte. Ham could also be subbed for the salami if you were in a pinch.

The flavors in this tart were amazing, but the bottom of my tart did turn out a little soggy. Next time I'll try par- baking the pastry, or maybe bake it on a pizza stone?

Easier than it sounds. Substituted swiss once - just fine. Made once without meat for a great vegetarian treat

This was exceptional and very easy. I used a blue-ribbon Wisconsin gruyere, as Whole Foods was out of comte. The main issue is that the amount of asparagus in the puree has a lot of variation depending on how much top you trim off. I found I made WAY too much filling and it's probably because I just cut off two- inch pieces rather than three-inch pieces and my asparagus didn't lose much when I snapped off the bottoms. I would also use a bit more gruyere/Comte next time, but that's just because I love gruyere. I am completely in love with puff pastry now - I used Trader Joe's new store brand and it was absolutely delicious.

My kids just loved this dish. I used phyllo dough instead of puffed pastry (in error) but it worked great. It' made it light and airy. so eash. I will make it again and again and again.

Really liked this. Frozen puff pastry is so forgiving! Next time I'm going to add some morels. I left out the salami and it was still delish. I might not pile all the filling in next time -- it could have stood being just a titch lighter.

Costco carries a wonderful brand of Comte cheese from France- EntreMont.

I made this for dinner this evening with a pizza crust with basil -- it received raves reviews. My Italian husband couldn't it was so good as he doesn't think of pizza with asparagus. Would definitely make it again.

Made this tart for an Easter Brunch and it was a HUGE hit. everyone loved it. I happened to have prosciutto on hand, so used that instead of the salami, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and pretty easy to make. Will definitely be making this again.

Made this as an appetizer for dinner guests last night. It was a huge hit! Couldn't find Comte cheese so I used Gruyere. I also had a coupon for my supermarket's high end ricotta which only comes low-fat and flavored. I chose the garlic and herb. I think that added another layer of flavor to put this recipe over the top! Will try it again soon as an entree with a nice salad.

Really enjoyed this and easy to make. I wanted to do asparagus tart after seeing one on Martha Stewart's web site. Her version was "prettier", but seemed boring, only had asparagus with cheese sprinkled on top. I combined her idea of laddering asparagus stalks the entire length of the tart, but used this filling. I also seared the salami in a hot pan, to give it some texture. Salami takes seconds and crisps up like bacon if it's thin. Thanks for garden burger idea, will try for my vegetarian sister. this is a keeper. I'd like to try it with sun dried tomatoes instead of asparagus.

This dish elicited rave response from my dinner guests. I also made one with crumbled GardenBurger instead of salami--a surprisingly good veg alternative.

The taste was very good; presentation wonderful. A little too much filling for the tart but this is a minor observation.

I got so many compliments on this recipe from my last dinner guests. Not sure how you could miss the asparagus taste in this tart. Not only is it in whole pieces on top, but the pureed asparagus mixed with the ricotta flavors the whole tart. The recipe came out perfectly. I was expecting the bottom of the crust to be soggy, but it came out light and crisp. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

The tart browned up nicely;looked good. But I did not get the asparagus taste I hoped for. As a matter of fact, I would characterize the taste as "bland".

I made this by the recipe with one exception. I couldn't find Comte cheese so used fontina instead. I served it with a salad for a light dinner and it was delicious. Also wonderful reheated the next day.

I made this tart for a casual dinner with other appetizers. I did not puree asparagus, just used it on the top. I did not have Comte cheese, so used a parmesan, asiago, fontina blend and added garlic and fresh rosemary to the cheese mixture. The cheese filling was light and had a nice balance of flavors. The asparagus needed to be pressed into the cheese as they did not stay on the tart.
