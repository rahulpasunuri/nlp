Apparently I downloaded this recipe 5 years ago, it fell out of a cookbook, as I was pondering what to make for a special Christmas Eve dinner for my college age kids...They loved it!! It was fun and delicious! Light and surprisingly sophisticated, perfect after our roast duck. I used Lillet, because thats what I had on hand, you could probably use a reisling too-My daughter and I had made candied grapefruit (from Maida Heatter) to give as gifts, and now I am emailing this recipe too!!

This was the dessert for my French Christmas Eve dinner this year. I can't think of a better way to show off the abundant fresh citrus this time of year. All of my guests gobbled up their portions, and the "heel" left on the serving plate was snapped up when I turned my back to clear the table. The only thing I will do differently next time is to lay in and chill a layer of the gelatin mixture at the bottom of the pan to ensure a nicer set on the top of the terrine.

I love this recipe! I have made it many times. Sometimes I follow the recipe exactly but most often i use the bounty of the day. Two fun additions have been grated carrots and maraschino cherries.
