These cupcakes are great. I am a professional baker and I will definitely use this recipe again. Just a few notes, I think it's really important to whip the butter for a long time. It should be light, fluffy and the color will lighten. I added the orange zest to my butter/sugar mixture instead of the egg mixture. I only did a 1/3 times recipe and it yielded 18 regular cupcakes. I baked at 325 for 18 minutes and they were perfect. I ended up using one of Julia Child's vanilla buttercream frosting recipes and it paired well.

These came out very dense on the dry side, but I explained it like "an Italian holiday bread" like the description, and it definitely works if you have the pannetone molds. I used paper/aluminum cupcake molds, and they worked fine too. The cardamom flavor is over the moon delicious!!! The only down side is I decided to go with a random vanilla frosting recipe that was terrible. Need a better suggestion there!

I loved the idea of the orange/cardamom flavor profile, but as a busy Mom was reluctant to bake this from scratch. I instead used a cake mix (Duncan Hines Deluxe Moist Yellow Cake). To the mix I added the vanilla, orange-flavor water, orange peel along with cardamom spice which I reduced to only 2 tsp. Following the directions on the cake mix box for 24 muffins, this made it simple and yielded great results. I don't doubt the original recipe is better, but as a faster and easier alternative this is a good compromise.

I haven't made these yet, but I was wondering if anyone has tried using the orange water, orange peel and cardamom to doctor up a vanilla cake mix? If so, I would be interested in hearing how it turned out.

for doconnor from Orange, California -- I myself would use 5 eggs, but that's just me. :) I think if you go with 4 the batter may not rise sufficiently. Again, that's my opinion. Not sure if anyone else will chime in. :)

I'm an old hand at making these cupcakes. I've never had any problems at all when pulling it all together. I find that it is a bit labor intensive and it fails a little at being a cake. These were meant to be cupcakes and they are a delight when they are. I've also made them with regular flour, which is a huge NO NO. Cake flour is absolutely essential to get the light airy cake that this produces. I've also never deviated from the recipe - doing so changes it. Normally I make the recipe as suggested, then make notes to change something each time. Not with this one. It's perfect the way it is. By far, one of the best recipes epicurious has done in terms of desserts. I lost the original magazine with this, but so happy I found the recipe here online

everyone loves these cupcakes. I have made them several times. For those of you who halved the recipe, did you use 4 or 5 eggs? thank you

I too, am discouraged by this recipe...the frosting is ridiculously thick and had to be thinned with extra cream to allow it to be spreadable. Still, it tastes like a bag of confectioners sugar. The cake is tasty, however it is very dense, more like a pound cake consistency. Overall taste experience, not worth the calories or the cost...should have saved myself the hassle on my boyfriend's birthday and picked up something instead of picking this recipe.

This is in response to the review by Amyscookin...I have made these cupcakes a few times with success each time. Collecting some of the ingredients for the first time can be a task, but definitely worth it. I found the panettone molds at Sur la Table, the orange flower extract at a middle eastern store and cardamom is readily available. You can buy the whole pods and grind them yourself, they will keep fresh for a long time in the refrigerator.

I will never make these blasted cupcakes again! First, you should know that I am an experienced cook and not easily discouraged in the kitchen. A few important things: the cupcakes did not rise properly. They rose only to the top of the panettone paper & any extra ran over the sides. While the flavor & moisture of the cake is very good, the appearance is poor. The only saving grace for my Easter dessert will be the pretty panettone wrappers & the decorations on the tops. I will serve them as "individual cakes" rather than cupcakes since they look nothing like a cupcake! In addition, between the panettone wrappers, orange flower water & ground cardamon, whipping cream, & buttermilk these were a ridiculously expensive dessert. Be warned... I paid $11.50 at my local supermarket for 1.75 oz. of ground cardamon. Unless you have all the ingredients in your cupboard, I say forget it. The icing is too thick & too sweet. I used 1/2 the recipe so only used 4 C of powdered sugar. I added approximately 5 extra T of cream to thin & reduce sweetness of the icing & it is still VERY sweet. After 2 1/2 hours of preparation, I regret not having found a cupcake at a local bakery that I like & decorating them myself. This is the first time in 20+ years of using Bon Appetit recipes with total confidence that I have been so disappointed. PS: I could not find the 1.5 height panettone papers anywhere! The closest I could find was 2". I don't think you'll be trimming the papers to size either, as I considered... it will ruin them. Contrary to the many ++ reviews, I say run away from this one, fast.

Beautiful and delicious. I made them for 2 baby showers and they were big hits. I used regular muffin papers and decorated with gum drops. Orange flower water a little challenging to find, but worth it.

Lovely cake with a tender crumb. Delicately flavorful and exceptionally easy.

This is the 2nd time I've tried this recipe. The first time I did not have the orange flower water. This time I did, and it made all the difference in the world. I cut the recipe in half cause I didn't need that many cupcakes. I use the giant muffin tins with paper liners. It made 12 perfect cupcakes. The flavor was awesome! This one is a keeper.

I made a 2/3 recipe in a normal cupcake pan, and got exactly two dozen decent-sized cupcakes. I think it would be better to bake in the large pannetone molds as suggested because by baking in a regular cupcake pan, the cupcakes came out with muffin-tops which were awkward to smooth frosting over. The flavor was lovely. In case you are wondering whether you can substitute "orange essence" or artificial orange flavor for the orange flower water... don't. The two products are really different and the former would be just awful.The texture of the cake is dense, as another reviewer mentioned, but moist and enjoyable. Our one complaint was that the buttery sweetness of the frosting seemed to overwhelm the cupcake's flavor. Overall, we liked these cupcakes, but will experiment with a few other recipes for our wedding. The orange blossom water makes me wonder whether a rose-water cupcake might work well for a wedding?

I made only 1/3 of the recipe and it was delicious! The orange-flower water adds a wonderful aroma. I omitted the cardamom (don't like it that much). The frosting was very easy to make, but I cut down the sugar, tasting it till it was right. Very easy to use as well and piped beautifully.

I thought these were very good. I didn't have any orange flower water and substituted w/ amaretto, and enjoyed the results.

I made these as both mini-cupcakes, and jumbo cupcakes, but none in the panettone papers. Both sizes baked up perfectly for me, with no problems. These cupcakes came out with excellent flavor and texture and were a huge hit! With the vanilla frosting, they were perfect. I got raves from everyone. Will definitely make these again and again!

I made these cupcakes along with the Devil's Food ones for my wedding in September, but due to a glitch, ended up serving them at other wedding events (rehearsal and BBQ). They disappeared so quickly, and even my mother, who tried to talk me out of baking the cake for my own wedding, is requesting them! The cake is so moist and flavourful, and stood up very well to being frozen for 2 weeks. The icing was a tad on the sweet side, so I'll cut down the icing sugar. I already have requests to make this for Christmas!

I made these as one of four flavors for a wedding for 150 people. I changed it a little using my own buttercream recipe and normal silver cupcakes. I get frequent requests, including from my 4 y/o son for his birthday!

I used a larger pantonne mold, 2.75" x 2". I ended up with only 17 scant cupcakes. Like the other reviewers indicated, it's really tricky to get the portion just right so you get the nice dome top. The cake itself is too dense, more poundcake consistency than your ususal cake. I liked the orange and cardamom flavoring. I didn't used the accompanied frosting recipe rather a Swiss buttercream recipe that I found elsewhere. If I made this again, I'd seperate the eggs and beat the whites seperatly to get more lift and lighten the cake more.

I made these cupcakes for a wedding shower and they were a huge hit. Not only were they beautiful, covered in spray roses, but very delicious. Using the flowers was a great way to create show-stopping cakes without being a skilled decorator. The cupcakes had a delicate, perfumed flavor, perfect for a shower or special occasion. Since the party was small, I successfully cut the recipe in half. It resulted in exactly two dozen regular-sized cupcakes (plus three extra for the chef and her two helpers!). I added a touch (1/2 teaspoon of orange extract) to the buttercream (I halved that recipe as well) just to give it a hint of citrus.

I am making this recipe again today. The flavor is great! I made the cupcake tier for a clients graduation party and they were a hit. Some hints; make sure to spray the liners with nonstick spray that has flour in it. We did practice filling the cups. Your best bet is to fill one to about 3/4 full and weigh it! Then try to get the rest of them about the same weight. I use an ice cream scoop with the squeeze release. Spray with nonstick spray first for easy release. We served the cupcakes with forks and most people didn't bother to even fuss with the paper. They just ate right out of the paper.

Both recipes [orange cardamom and chocolate cinnamon] have wonderful flavor but getting the height just right was trying. Both were either a little too low or overflowed. Did anyone else encounter this. Also, the orange cardamom recipe was almost too dense.

Baked this in two 10" pans & covered with buttercream frosting. It was wonderful and received a lot of compliments.

I ordered the special cupcake wrappers and filled them with three different flavored cupcakes, then tiered them like the inside picture for a wedding celebration. The orange-cardmom flavor was delicious but everyone had great difficulty getting the wrappers off. Did anyone else have this problem?

These were delicious. Light, yet with a rich flavor. The cardamom and orange combination makes them special and impressive. I halved the recipe and cooked them in plain ol' cupcake papers and they were great.

I couldn' t wait to try this one! Although they taste great, they dont LOOK like the picture. I got bored halfway into it and just ate the batter. I'll make a photo of them and post them on my yahoo website.

This recipe for both types of cupcakes (orange and chocolate cinnamon, Bon Appetit June 2004) was a huge hit at my daughter's baptism. One thing to look out for, the pannetone cups that I purchased were slightly larger in height (about 1 inch) than noted on the recipe so I had to fill up the cup more than 1/3.
