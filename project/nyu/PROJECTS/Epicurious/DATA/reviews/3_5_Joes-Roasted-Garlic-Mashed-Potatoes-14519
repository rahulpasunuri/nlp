Overall very bland considering the amount of ingredients. Potatoes were very dry so additional butter, sour cream & buttermilk were added. I would not make these again.

I have made this many times, and have incorporated the following changes (suggested by other reviewers): 2 heads of garlic, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup buttermilk. Beat in an extra 3/4 cup softened butter at the end. An electric hand mixer is adequate for the mixing. I make these the day before or early the same day, refrigerate in a microwave safe serving dish. After I transport them to a party, when serving time comes, I microwave them until hot (check with an instant read thermometer), about 10 minutes.

I found this recipe to be very bland. Ingredients sound good but lack any zing when put together. Also, 16 potatoes cannot be correct. I added more buttermilk and sour cream because they were so dry. I'll pass next time.

Super creamy and delicious mashed potatoes with a subtle cheese flavor. equally good with or without the garlic. I served them with braised short ribs & simple buttered fresh green beans for a wonderful "comfort" meal.

These mashed potatoes were wonderful. What started as a list of humble ingredients, turned out to play a staring role on our dinner plates. These mashed potatoes have the wow factor as well as comfort food appeal. One can't go wrong with that combination. Absolutely a keeper.

These are really delicious. I used about a pound and a half of red potatoes and reduced the rest of the ingredients accordingly. The flavor is not too strong, and it is just a good go-to mashed potatoes recipe. Great with steak and green bean bundles!

Easy to make recipe that tasted better than we expected. Even with modifying the recipe (we used garlic flakes and 1% milk instead of the garlic cloves and buttermilk) it was really, really good.

These were good as stated in the recipe. But they were even better with another half head of Garlic and double the butter. Left the rest of the ingredients as listed. GOod stuff!

I used a regular masher instead of an electric mixer and two heads of garlic instead of one. The potatoes were definitely good, but I don't know that I could say they were worth the extra effort. I couldn't taste the garlic or parmesan at all, and although I liked the occasional burst of sour cream flavor, my boyfriend said he just would have preferred more butter! I will admit that even though I used an extra head of garlic, I'm not sure how much of it actually made it into the pan. I had a hard time separating the roasted garlic cloves...they were so soft that they mixed in with the peel when I squeezed. I think I may have thrown some of the garlic away along with the peel.

Served at Thanksgiving this year, everyone loved them. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and a little more garlic and sour cream and they were truly perfect!

Made this recipe with skim milk (and no buttermilk) and they tasted great. I don't think anything was lost because of it.

I've used this recipe twice. Once as written - to rave reviews - as a side dish for grilled chicken and steaks. Just recently, I borrowed the method from the recipe for much plainer mashed potatoes to serve with rich braised short ribs. This is a fail-safe basic method. If you don't like potato peels, they are very easy to remove after boiling. Both times I used at least twice the butter, a bit more sour cream than it called for and left out the buttermilk (never have it on hand). I'm thinking next time I might add either grated cheddar and chives or lemon zest and dill, depending on what I'm serving them with. Also,I had always been under the impression that you should NEVER use an electric beater on mashed potatoes or they would turn gluey. Plus, I was also raised believing that they should be made no more than an hour or two before serving. Lies, lies, lies! Both times I used a mixer (as directed) and added a beaten egg (tip from another belevolent poster) into the potatoes so that I could make them a day ahead. This is now my standard method for excellent spuds.

I thought this was terrific! Generally, I do favor the lumpy textured style but the flavors in this one make it a must for my recipe box. I made this to go along with slow braised pork with black grapes and balsamic found on this site. A very good match!

Sublime - the best smooth garlic mashed potatoes on this site. If you're into the textural experience with skins and lumps, try another recipe. Served with ham, spinach, swiss stuffed chicken breats. Delicious!

These are fantastic! I served these with a traditional autumn feast of pork chops in beer-teriyaki marinade and homemade cinnamon applesauce. Everything went well together, and the mashed potatoes were my favorite part! Based on recommendations, I added sliiiightly more butter, chives, and garlic...but barely. The recipe is wonderful as written!

I doubled the garlic heads to two (three probably wouldn't hurt for big garlic lovers) The recipe was incorrect in terms of numbers of potatoes which should have been (6) instead of (16) - otherwise it was great!

Rating: 4
Tried this recipe for a large group of people and everyone loved it. I doubled the amount of garlic and forgot to add parmesan. The sweetness roasted garlic with the sourness of the buttermilk and the creaminess of the sour cream is a nice combination. The flavors are suttle and did not overpower the rest of the meal. It was an excellent accompaniment to the marinated flank steak I served.

We thought the sour cream/buttermilk addition was too tart and totally covered the delicate flavor of the roasted garlic.

I was making Buttermilk mashed potatoes - http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=106054 when I realized I was out of buttermilk. I took a look around and threw in some fresh parmesian and sour cream along with reserved water and butter. Absolutely incredible!!! The carmelized shallots (from other recipe make) this amazing!

Rating: 1
I doubled the amount of roasted garlic after reading the reviews. I used Parmesano Regiano freshly grated and followed all other aspects of the recipe to the letter. The results were dissappointing in that there was very little difference in flavor from plain mashed potatoes. Roasted garlic is so mild and sweet that it stands no chance against all that buttermilk and sour cream. This was a waste of a lot of expensive ingredients.

Rating: 3
Great mashed potatoes - very flavorful. I prefer to use peeled russet potatoes and drizzle a little olive oil over the garlic before roasting. However, the real key to success is to use freshly grated fine quality parmesan and definitely not that horrid powdered parmesan available in shakers - YUCH!

Rating: 2
2.5 would be a perfect score for these potatoes. The ingredients seemed so perfect but it lacked zip. I also used peeled Yukon gold potatos and put them through a ricer so the potatoes were nice & light. It was just missing something. The best garlic roasted mashed potatoes are made at a Canadian restaurant called The Keg. I have to get my hands on that recipe! It makes mincemeat out of this one!

Very light and creamy potatoes without a lot of butter, would definitely make again. Used regular russets, peeled before boiling.

I've made this recipe twice, both for dinner parties and it has been a huge success. Both times several people have asked me for the recipe, of which I'm more than happy to pass on. People have told me these are the best mashed potatoes they have every tasted. I personally have made this recipe with Yukon Gold potatoes and have peeled them (the recipe uses unpeeled red potatoes) because I don't like mashed potatoes with the peels in them. Also, when I roast garlic I like to drizzle the garlic bulbs with a little olive oil. To make sure this recipe is extra yummy don't use just any parmesan cheese, use Parmagiano Reggiano. Enjoy!

mashed potatoes with the skin on is disgusting in itself and red potatoes are TERRIBLE for use as mashed potatoes.

This recipe is okay, however, it needs more garlic and chives. I saw no benefit to adding the olive oil. If you plan on adding gravy to you might as well omit the parmesan, too.

In one word ~ YUM! I served this with our Thanksgiving turkey this year and my family loved it... I doubled the recipe and used regular table potatoes ~ they came out great! I also added extra roasted garlic and omitted the olive oil, then garnished with dried Cilantro. Hubby and I were actually GLAD to have leftovers!

As garlic mashed potatoes go, this was one of the better recipes I've tried. I've made the recipe a few times, and liked Yukon Golds the best if I could find them. If you like these, you'll probably like Horseradish Mashed Potatoes with Caramelized Onions and Mashed Potatoes with Prosciutto and Parmesan cheese even better.

Not the greatest. I agree that the garlic taste was lacking.

Rating: 2
These were okay, but not the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. I could barely taste the roasted garlic, even after halving the amount of potatoes, but using the full amount of all the other ingredients. The best thing I can say about this dish is that it was pretty (the red potatoes and green chives would make an attractive holiday dish), but I think this dish was too much effort, and yielded only so-so results.

The only thing good about this recipe were the colors and the good olive oil I used. We threw it out after a couple of bites. This was not worth the time or effort. OR my olive oil!

These mashed potatoes are so amazing that the next time my husband and I travel to the Vancouver area we are going to put Joe Fortes restaurant on our itinerary so we can try the original version. I have made these for several years to wide acclaim and I recommend making them right before serving for optimum texture (creamy & rich!). I also suggest doubling the garlic and butter for an all out decadent showstopping recipe!

Rating: 3
Very rich and flavorful. I didn't have any buttermilk or sour cream, so I used half and half instead. Before warming the roasted garlic with the liquid (as recommended by another reviewer), I put it in my mini food processor with a little olive oil, some parmesan and rosemary from my garden. This was an excellent dish - we'll make it again!

Although the family raved about the taste - it came out extremely 'heavy'! Used elephant garlic and the mild taste was exceptional. Will have to try it again for Christmas and see if it lightens up.

To the cook from Ontario--if I had to guess, it was the dried parmesan that caused the recipe to fail. I don't even consider that cheese. Definitely try it again with real parmesan. I've made this twice and both times my guests (and I) have loved it.

Sorry people...maybe I goofed in my cooking, but we didn't like this at all. I Cut the recipe in half, but the garlic was way too over powering. I ended up throughing it out. I had to put it in the micro to heat it up before serving. Is that what made it so strong? I also used dry parmesaen instead of fresh, I'm sure that was no help in flavor!

Rating: 1
Just by looking at the recipe i can tell that the maker is unskilled in the way of roasted garlic mashed potatoes! Roasting the garlic, pureeing in a food processor to a paste, and cooking with milk before you add the MASHED(not chunked) potatoes produces optimum flavour. If joe would like pointers on any other flavour of mashed potato, come to the Toby Creek Restaurant in Panorama. They know what mashed potatoes are all about!

Rating: 3
Great, but the garlic flavor was not strong enough. I took reviewer's advice, and the next time I made these, I doubled the garlic, and it was just right-- the day it was served. I came to eat the leftovers two days later, and they tasted awful! TOO TOO MUCH GARLIC!! Eat this the day you make them-- they're wonderful.

These were soooo good the first day, but the next day, they tasted awful! The buttermilk permiated the entire dish, giving it a sour taste. (Just incase you are wondering, the buttermilk was fresh). I would make them again because they were incredible at first, only I would substitute milk for the buttermilk.

I had 12 for dinner and this was a HIT.I served it with beef tenderloin and grilled vegetables. I doubled the recipe and used 3 heads of garlic. I did add milk before I baked it because I thought it was too dry. Also made the night before without adding an egg.

This dish was good but not 'to die for '. With that line-up of ingredients, we were somehow expecting more. Just seemed to lack sparkle. However, I would make it again because it is easy (no peeling potatoes) & fast & quite tasty. My thanks too to the cook who suggested making it the day before, whipping in an egg & refrigerating overnight. This worked really well & you have a nice side dish all ready to go next day.

I served these potatoes with a barbequed turkey-- a perfect combination. Everyone loved them!! But roasting the garlic was a bit of trouble; when I tried to get the cloves into the potatoes, they were not easy to squeeze out. Other than that, no complaints. My mixer stopped working just as I started to use it, so I used a traditional potato masher. Some of the cloves were not as mixed in as they should have been, but it was still tasty. One thing to note: I came to eat the leftovers two days later, and found the garlic flavor to be much too strong and overwhelming. My suggestion is to eat them all the day they're made. Not too difficult a task!

Extra garlic is the way to go. Try making this dish the day before. Beat in one egg and place it in a casserole dish with a lid and refrigerate over night. Top with a dollop of butter and place it in the oven at 350 for about forty minutes to an hour. They come out nice and fluffy and it's a real time saver.

This was another huge hit at my dinner table. I added another half-cup of buttermilk and another 2 T. butter, as it seemed a little dry, and I wouldn't bother with the roasted garlic - I couldn't taste it, so I recommend 3-4 cloves of fresh, pressed garlic instead. The guests stuffed themselves so much with the potatoes, they had no room for dessert! I thought they were delicious and very easy to make. P.S. I made these to accompany Lemon-Pepper Chicken with Thyme Gremolata, and a salad with the Stilton dressing...the whole menu was a home run.
