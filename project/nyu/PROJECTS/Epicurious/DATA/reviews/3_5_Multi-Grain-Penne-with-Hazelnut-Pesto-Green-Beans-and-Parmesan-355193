Excellent recipe. My two variations were unintentional - a mild overtoasting of the hazelnuts and a little more Parmesan than the recipe called for, but overall a very accurate cooking and a delicious result. I definitely recommend it.

Fabulous. Used the beans and onions from our CSA. What fresh clean flavors. Was a hit with our 3-year old.

I adore this recipe! The only change I made was to use parmesan cheese because the kasseri was too expensive. I also didn't need the reserved pasta water, but good to have on hand just in case. This ia a favorite in my house!

I loved this! It tasted very fresh. I read the other reviewa and then used a 1/2 cup of parmesan and a touch more lemon zest to make up for the lack of saltiness that some people mentioned. That seemed to do the trick!

I made this with a bit less parsley and green onions, as I had less on hand. I also cut the olive oil almost in half and used cooking spray instead of olive oil to cook the onions. I thought the pesto was delicious. If I make it again I will use more parsley and at least one more garlic clove. I agree with the others who have said that it needs a good amount of salt. I will definitely be making this again, and I wonder if I could add a meat to it since we aren't vegetarians.

very nice. the only sub i made was using walnuts in place of hazelnuts (cause they're a staple in my household). everything else I did exactly as the recipe called. I think the comments about the parsley being too strong are silly -- this is a recipe for pesto, so if you don't like parsley don't make it. that's like complaining that tapenade is too olive-y.

I used more beans and less pasta (about 10 ounces of each) and it came out great! The parsely flavor is a little strong but I like it. The lemon and the hazelnuts were just right. I only had a few green onions and did not taste them at all, will use more next time.

I absolutely loved this recipe once I modified it. I used walnuts instead of hazelnuts, and I added ground turkey and more parmesan to it. The results were magnificant. I definitely will be making this again.

This recipe was horrible. I have yet to make a recipe on epicurious that I did not like, and then I made this. The parsley is overpowering and extremely bland. I attempted to doctor it up with salt, pepper, parmesan... then when all else failed, I even tried a little white wine and some fresh italian herbs. NOTHING helped. Move on to something else and save your money and stomach on this one.

I made this last night. It was pretty good, and tasty. My girlfriend was allergic to one of the ingredients, don't know which, so I probably wouldn't make it again. If I were to make it again, though, I would add more acid, and second the need for lots of salt 'n peppa.

This vegetarian dish turned out delicious. I mixed whole wheat with plain pene. I don't recommend leaving out any ingredients as all the flavors really compliment each other.

Very green! Refreshing and light. Needs plenty of salt and pepper though, parmesan too. I didn't make it with multi-grain pasta, just regular. Sure makes a lot. It didn't taste strongly of hazelnuts is probably my only negative reaction. But otherwise really good, and a good way to use the huge bunch of parsley and pile of green beans in my CSA box.
