This was my first ever granita recipe (my first ever frozen dessert recipe, actually!) and I thought it turned out wonderfully. It tasted like strawberry lemonade. The only caution I have is that you should really start with less sugar, taste, and go from there, especially since the strawberries themselves vary in sweetness. The ones I used were actually quite tart, and I still only needed about 2/3 cup of sugar.

Delicious! My wife had granita at Bouley in New York at loved it. This was the first time I made a granita and the results were great. Very easy to make.

This is unbelieveably easy and delicious. It tastes like a virgin strawberry margarita and the cream makes is decadent tatsing. I don't use the strainer as I love the sorbet consistency including the seeds and pulp and it turns out lovely.

This is a perfect dessert for company. Everyone loved it. The one thing that I found a little difficult was removing the strawberry seeds through the strainer but I think that it is a vital step in the recipe. This is an elegant and refreshing dessert. I'll be making it again.

This is one of the most delicious and easiest desserts I have made! But, you should not add all that sugar if your adding ice cream or something else that is sweet! =]

Added 1 tablespoon of good quality balsamic vinegar, which I believe makes this a 4 forks recipe! Yes, I was skeptical too until trying the "Balsamic Strawberries" recipe on this site and now know how the balsamic REALLY brings out the strawberry flavor!

What a delicious and easy recipe for the summer. We served this over vanilla ice cream - yum! Can't wait to try with other fruit. I cut back to 1/2 c sugar on in season strawberries. Could have used even less, for my taste.

This is a refreshing and simple summer recipe. For those of you who don't have a huge sweet tooth, you may want to cut the sugar back a bit to something like 2/3 cup of sugar (especially if you plan to serve with cream).

I am very happy with how easy and delicious this recipe is. I made it for a dinner and it was a huge hit. I wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent! Cheated on the freezing by pouring mixture into ice cube trays, freezing until firm, and then pulsing a servings worth of cubes in the food processor 10x or so. Made more as soon as we finished what we had.
