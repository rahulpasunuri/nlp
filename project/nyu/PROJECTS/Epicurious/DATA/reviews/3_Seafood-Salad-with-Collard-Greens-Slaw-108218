I too wondered about the "collard greens" and where the recipe was for same. Anyhow, I made the salad and served it on a bed of various types of lettuces that I had shredded, including raddichio (important for colour). I thought the recipe was wonderful and will be making it yet again this weekend for company that I MUST impress.

To the reviewer from Cape Cod - after the last ingredient in the list is the link for the Collard Green Slaw recipe. It should show up in blue on your computer screen. Click it to get the recipe for the slaw. You're welcome!

The recipe for "Seafood Salad with Collard Greens Slaw" doesn't mention collard greens except in the title -- rather odd. Can't be rated because it doesn't direct the preparation of the greens!

This was a wonderful salad and made a beautiful presentation! I made it with some red& green cabbage as well as some collard greens & nappa cabbage. I thought the seafood dressing was very tasty! All in all very good!
