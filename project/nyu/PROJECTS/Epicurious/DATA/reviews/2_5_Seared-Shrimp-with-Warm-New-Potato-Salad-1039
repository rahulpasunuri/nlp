This is an easy, fast, and tasty recipe. I made it for 2 serves, so changed the amount of ingredients according to my own taste: half pound of jumbo shrimp and two regular red- skineed potatoes cut into 1-inch cubes. I used double of the required dried thyme, lemon peel, and garlic. As recommended by others, also added some cayenne pepper to the shrimp. I was out of white wine and used 3/4 cup of a California Madera wine. Had 1/2 cup of cherry tomatoes halves instead.

The pieces of the dish just didn't compliment each other. The new potatoes and the shrimp just didn't go together - at least - not according to my taste buds. The sauce was thin even though I followed all directions. Thank goodness I had very tasty shrimp.

This was a wonderfully easy dish to make. I agree that it needs a little more salt & pepper and a fewer potatoes.

The presentation is really nice, but it definately needed more dressing. Too much potatoes for such a little dressing. What I did is pour the dressing over the individual salad for both of us instead of using all the dressing on all the potatoes in one shot. I'd make it again and triple the dressing cause I like flavor on my pototoes! :)

This was a little bland at first, but I added some salt and a dash of cayenne powder and it was fantastic! Great idea and simple to make.
