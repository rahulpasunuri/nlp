Did ANYONE make this recipe as directed???? What I mean is: without omitting or substituting?? I'd like to get an idea of the actual recipe, as originally conceived and intended!

My daughter is allergic to eggs so I make this cake for every occasion. I don't even add the mint chips and it is the best. Everyone comments on how moist it is. Also, I just use my own buttercream frosting recipe. This is the best, fastest and easiest egg free cake recipe!

i made this cake for cooking school, did not have mints to add into each batter layer as i made it, but otherwise did this word for word...the batter is VERY liquid, even my instructor was a bit worried about how it would turn out...the cake was very moist and dense, almost fudge/brownie like...even without the mint in the layers i found that all the combined bits made for a bit too much mint, (and i LOVE mint) so if i were to make this again i would cut the mint in half for each stage...one thing that i liked was how the icing in the layers was left very creamy, while the outside got nice and crusty, a very texture diverse combination.

This recipe is wonderful for people on special diets. My 5-yo daughter cannot have eggs, gluten, or dairy and we were able to adapt this to make one of the best cakes we have ever had--restricted diet or not. I did not make the frosting, only the cake part and used canola oil and a gluten-free flour mixture with the addition of xanthan gum. I used regular chocolate chips and skipped the mint. I baked the batter in a novelty cake pan from Wilton and it released beautifully with a good coating of canola oil spray. I made it a day ahead and let it sit at room temperature. A wonderful find!!!

Great flavor, yummy rich chocolate mint frosting. I used Andes candies baking chips instead of mint chips, and put them on top of the cake instead of crushed peppermints. It was fabulous and went over well at the birthday bash I made it for.

Easy cake, with great results. Did stick a little, but wax paper or parchment rounds in the pan did the trick. I couldn't find mint chocolate chips either, but 1 tsp extract in the cake was perfect. I sprinkled the chips on top of the cake in a ring about 1 inch in from the edge, filled the middle of the ring with crushed peppermints, and put individual starlight mints (on per piece of cake) around the outside the chip ring. Looked fab, tasted better, everyone loved it.

I to didn't have mint chocolate chips, so I substituted with a tablespoon of peppermint extract in the batter instead of vanilla; I used milk chocolate chips to sprinkle on the cakes, and left out the chips between the layers all together. Everyone loved the cake that had a piece; it was very rich and chocolatey. I would make it again, but I had some trouble with the cakes sticking and some actually fell apart when it came out of the pan, so I just made some more frosting to 'glue' it together and it was fine. The frosting was delicious.

This was a great cake! I didn't have mint chocolate chips so I used mint extract in both the cake and the frosting and it worked wonderfully. The cakes did stick a little in the pans, so it may be helpful to line the pans with parchment, but overall I received many compliments!

The birthday crew thought this was the BEST cake they have ever tasted. At the moment, I have the oven preheating and am making it for the second time. This time I will chop the mint chips smaller (they are as wide as Hersheys kisses), and I will take the cakes out a few minutes early.

This is a great eggless cake! It's very hard to find cake recipes for my vegan relatives and for people allergic to eggs, and this is one of the best I've had. Great texture, very chocolately. I also used chopped Andes mints and used the full amount. I ran out of frosting (this was a birthday cake) and had to make 50% more. The only reservation I have about this cake is that I detected a slight baking soda taste, especially the second day after I made it. Absolutely fabulous for a vegan cake; very good for a cake of any category.

Excellent! If you can't find mint chocolate chips, just put extra peppermint extract in the batter. It's heavenly!!!

It was good but not outrageously. Since I too couldn't find mint chips, I opted for the chopped up Andies Candies. I only used about half of what the recipe called for. The cake seemed to improve with time...the next day it was better and a bit more dense. Enjoy.

I was using this recipe for build a volcano cake for my son's birthday party, which required handling the cake while still warm. My hands were so oily (yuck). Even though I love mint chocolate I wish that I had used about half of the mint chips, it was a little too minty.

This recipe is an absolute winner! It's really easy and delicious. The frosting is a bit too much - I had about a third left over every time. I'll make less next time. I used 200gram crushed mint chocolate slabs instead of chocolate chips and sunflower oil as I couldn't find corn oil and it worked wonderfully. Just insure that your oven bakes well from the bottom too otherwise the cake falls apart.

I made this cake for my daughter's 10th birthday, and her opinion is that this is a very good recipe. She would make it again any time. (The adults loved it too).

Very good! I am only 13 and could make it without much trouble. I too could not find mint chips, so I used Hershey's Mint Bites and they worked very well. I would definatly make this cake again!

This cake got rave reviews! Instead of mint chips I used a chopped up mint chocolate bar, and I garnished with chocolate shavings.

I personally could not get my hands on mint chocolate chips, so I used Andes mint dinner candies. The cake was really good, so evidently it doesn't matter what kind of mint chocolate is used!
