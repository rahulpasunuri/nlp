This is easy to make but is an impressive company dish. I have also made it as a single casserole on a party buffet.

this was very good. i think the tomato part was unnecessary and didn't go well with the souffle. a nice side dish for a southern brunch

Very nice starter. Used fresh chevre that was on hand. Would salt more aggresively next time. Easy and impressive.
