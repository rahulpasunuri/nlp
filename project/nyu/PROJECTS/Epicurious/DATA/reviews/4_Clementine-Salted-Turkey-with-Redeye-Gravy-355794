Despite being an I-can't-follow-a-recipe reviewer for this recipe, I want to say how well this unusual basic flavor combination can work for turkey leftovers as well: about 3/4 cup leftover turkey, 1/4 cup diced country ham, 2 cups chopped caramelized onions, 1 cup quartered onion, 1/2 cup espresso, zest from 1 1/2 oranges, a couple T honey/maple syrup to counteract the coffee bitterness, black pepper, some spices of your choice (garlic, fennel, marjoram, coriander seed, clove, cinnamon), 1/4 cup citrusy white wine for a touch more zing, 1/2 cup white sauce to smooth it all out, a few vegetables: 1 slivered carrot, 1 cup chopped fresh kale. Even my mother declared she liked this and ate every bite, which is saying something.

Turkey was wonderful and easy. A keeper. My 12 pound bird cooked in an hr less time than dictated. The gravy was not a keeper... salty and coffee-on-the-burner-all-day taste.

Absolutely unreal - made it for Thanksgiving this year and my guests were flipping out! I've only been making Thanksgiving turkey for 3 years now, but this is by FAR my favorite & might just be my new go-to recipe. The gravy is also spectacular.

This was an amazing recipe...the family devoured it! Turkey was super moist, the gravy seemed odd by reading the ingredients, but was really tasty. My Father In Law asked me to keep the recipe (and share it with my MIL) b/c it was so moist and tender!

I made this with a chicken and it was excellent! Used 3 large tangerines for the salts, 1.5 went into the cavity with a small onion (added also pistachios). Cooked 15 minutes at 200 oC then another hour at 180 oC. It came out tender and juicy and very tasty. Made the gravy as instructed and it was very good too, but as we are not used to using gravy, I'll ommit it next time - I feel it is not necessary and takes too much time to preapre.

I made this turkey yesterday for our family thanksgiving - WOW. Followed the recipe as written except I added some fresh chopped sage to the rub; included a couple of lemons (did not have many oranges on hand as recipe called for) and some sprigs of fresh herbs (sage,rosemary, thyme) to the other ingredients when I filled the cavity before cooking. Made regular gravy with the pan drippings and it was a tad salty for me so I am glad I rinsed the turkey. The turkey was excellent - very moist and flavorful. The skin was perfectly crisp and made a beautiful presentation. I think the turkey was one the best I ever made.

Ever had the "poor mans" red eye? My grandma did not cook well...she cooked in surplus. Red eye at her house was a homemade biscuit, a dollop of bacon grease, sugar and hot coffee...boiling water to thin it out when needed. Normal folks couldn't drink the coffee at Grandmas until at least the middle of the afternoon.I have many family members that still love it.

we had this for canadian thanksgiving. i did my own gravy, not this one, but the tangerine salting was delish. i don't rinse the salt off after putting on the night before... just a little brush so it isn't over the top.
