I thought these were just OK. I think I would play around with the spice mixture a bit. Definitely add more salt! I didn't add cayenne because I am serving these to children as well as adults. I totally liked the method of coating the nuts with the egg white, that worked really well, but the spice mixture was just kind of blah to me.

This is four forks with cayenne pepper added (I use at least a teaspoon)! I have made it with all kinds of nuts, without removing skins and it's great.

Yummy! I just made 16 cups of these nuts to give as Christmas gifts, and they are heavenly! The only problem is that as they are cooling, my family keeps munching. I think I will end up having to make more for my friends. I used a mixture of almonds and pecans, since I'm not fond of Hazelnuts. Also, I used Penzey's Vietnamese Cinnamon, which I adore. Good snack recipe. I know I'll be making this again.

I love this recipe. I use it with walnuts all the time. It's also really good with a bit of Chinese Five Spice or cayenne pepper thrown in.

I've made them twice, once for a salad, once for noshing - SO EASY and so good! I used pecans, and they were perfect. I'm going to give as gifts for Christmas.

I used walnuts & almonds and added just a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sugar mixture -- it was delicious.

Loved it. Had a little problem with the hazelnut skins. Everyone loved them, though next I'll take better care keeping them dry afterward.

I've made these nuts three times already. My guests have always been mad about them. Fantastic!
