My original recipe for this sandwich is still better. Brie and plain mayo,may as well have a grease sandwich! Originally I made this with sundried tomatoes,drained,it was the early 80's after all and they were the rage,roasted would be just as good also. Onion roll instead of a plain roll. Today maybe carmelized onion instead especially if using a plain roll and a good mustard on either side of the bread. The bries' taste is better and texture when melted close enough no mayo necessary,no lettuce because this whole sandwich is wrapped in foil and warmed in the oven till all is warm and the brie has glued the sandwich together. Also good if left at room temp until brie softens then maybe add some buttercrunch or red leaf lettuce. Yum Yum!

Well that sure was a sandwich. Yep. Added some shiitake sauteed with garlic over olive oil which helped. Probably should use normal mayo instead of low-fat next time.
