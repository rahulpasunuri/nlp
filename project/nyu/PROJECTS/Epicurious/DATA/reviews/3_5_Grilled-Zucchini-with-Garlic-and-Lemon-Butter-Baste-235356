My tongue is truly blessed for having tasted this recipe! And with just coming into zucchini season, I have a feeling I will be making this ALOT! I made it just as directed, and I wouldn't change a thing. Delicious!!

This was even better than I expected. I'm 50/50 on zucchini--like it sometimes, not others, depending how it's cooked. I skipped the curry and oregano and added ground rosemary instead, keeping everything else the same (no Parm, I forgot to add it). Was delicious with grilled salmon & couscous prepared with mushrooms, red onion & tomatoes and a salad.

This was quite good. Next time I will double the spices and add a little lemon zest I think.

It was terrific! I omitted the curry and parmesan and used fresh garlic. Broiled in toaster oven and it was delicious!!

This was a great last minute side dish when I bought a few too many vegetables for my lasagna. I left out the garlic, lemon pepper and cheese because I just didn't have them and added fresh ground pepper. My family absolutely loved it because it let the flavor of the zucchini take center stage. And it went great with the lasagna.

VERY GOOD! I THINK THANNEXT TIME I WOULD USE A LITTLE MORE CURRY POWDER. BUT THE BASTE IS VERY AROMATIC. I LOVE IT

I made this just as the recipe specified, and it was terrific. Even the leftovers are good if heated up the next day.

I made this for dinner last night. I sliced the zucchini instead of halving it. I thought with a little extra salt, the flavors really came out. I will make this again!

Great and easy recipe! I used good quality sweet butter and also added fresh thyme. They have to be well cooked for all the flavors to come through. I am using this recipe again today!

Admittedly, I undercooked it. Nonetheless the flavors didn't come through. Tasted like naked grilled zucchini.

Delicious!! We are growing zucchini and have so many we dont know what to do with them all. Everyone who has tasted this recipe loves them. I added a little extra cheese for more flavor.

Fantastic recipe! My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty. I think that the salt may have come from the lemon- pepper...next time I would use unsalted butter and maybe a little less lemon pepper.

This is my favorite zucchini recipe ever. The zucchini tastes like a whole different vegetable between the charring from the grill and the lemony cheese flavor. When it's too cold to grill I broil the zucchini instead and that is just as delicious. I have yet to feed this to a single person who didn't love it (zucchini haters included).

Will definately make this recipe again! Not only did it taste wonderful but it looked beautiful with the grill lines showing across the zucchini

Everyone raved about this dish at our dinner party. People that didn't like zucchini now have a new vegetable to add to their list!

This side dish is ridiculously easy to make and tastes wonderful! I am not a huge zucchini fan but I loved this recipe. It was a hit at my dinner party and a definite do-over.

This is an easy and impressive looking way to serve zucchini. Great w/ steaks and twice baked blue cheese or cheddar potatoes.

I omitted the cheese but thought this was quite good. My husband hates zucchini and wouldn't eat it. Next time I'll use the cheese and maybe change his mind.

Easy, attractive, tangy - a hit

Very easy to make. The taste was good -- I think that next time I'll use fresh garlic as I would have liked a stronger garlic flavor. The only problem was that I think my zucchini were a little old and the skin was a little bitter. I didn't use cheese and subbed a little extra lemon for the lemon-pepper seasoning.
