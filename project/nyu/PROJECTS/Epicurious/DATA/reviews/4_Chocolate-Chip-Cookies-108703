Yummy!!! Such a good recipe. I read the 10 most recent reviews and followed some of the advice. I also made a few changes and they turned out perfect. My new go-to recipe! Changes: omit the white sugar- only the brown is needed. Also, I just added all three eggs, none of the partial egg mess. Finally, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil! Yes! So good. You can replace coconut oil with butter one-for-one, so I just used one stick butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. Awesome!

These are good. Although, I agree, they're a bit on the sweet side. I used dark chocolate chips. It cut into the sweetness and made for a good balance. Nuts would work well, too.

I use epicurious alot and generally love the "4 fork" recipes posted. But these cookies were way, way, way too sweet. Sugar is my friend but these cookies had way too much of it in them. Feel like I wasted the batch. The toll house recipe with more brown sugar than white, melted butter & an extra egg yolk = so much better.

Rating: 2
Way too salty. When I was adding the 1 1/2 teaspoons I thought it sounded like a lot, but wanted to go by the recipe the first time around. I did make one alteration, I used cold butter instead of melted to make cookies a little crisper and flakier. I will try this again with less salt. I think it could be so yummy without it.

This is not anything special at all. I'm wondering why several people called this their go-to cc cookie recipe. I'm bummed that I wasted my time baking these.

These are my go-to chocolate chip cookies. I think I've been making them since the recipe first appeared in Gourmet, made them once and never looked back! I have to say that using quality dark chocolate chips (I usually go with Ghirardelli, or in a pinch Hershey's Special Dark) is an absolute must. The dough is perfectly salty, crisp on the outside and chewy in the center without being mushy-soft. I do make two key adjustments: do NOT melt the butter, and skip all of that business about measuring out 1 1/2 T of the third egg. I did that a few times at first, but there is no discernable difference if you put the whole darn egg in. Promise. Saves you a bit of time and yields a less greasy cookie. Be sure to flatten the lumps of dough with a wet palm or glass or else they will not bake evenly.

I am forever searching for the perfect chocolate chip recipe so thought I'd give this one a whirl. While the cookies did turn out nice and flat, they flavor was just so-so. Also I reduced the cooking time by a minute after the first sheet was a tad over done. Generally speaking a decent recipe but I think I'll keep searching for the perfect one.

I was a little unsure about how the cookies were going to turn out because it was the first time that I have used this recipe, but they came out pretty delicious. The preparation was very quick and easy, and the whole project only took an hour or so. The cookies came out larger than I expected, but still very tasty. They were a crispy golden brown on the edges, and the middle was moist and chewy. This cookie is very chocolaty, and also very sweet. I would definitely make these again, as my brother thought that they were the best chocolate chip cookies he has ever had.

I was a bit leery of the amount of sugar called for in the recipe, but thought I would try to stick to the recipe as much as possible the first time. I'm glad I did as they were great; flat and chewy (although smaller than suggested in recipe). I did use white whole wheat/grain flour and loved the end result.

I put the dough in a rectangular pan and baked it until it was golden brown and a little crispy and a toothpick came out almost all the way clean. I brought it to a party and multiple people told me how much they LOVED IT! I even had 2 guys (one French) say it was the BEST dessert they'd ever eaten in their LIVES. I will never make any other chocolate chip cookies!!

Really great cookie recipe - have been looking for one that makes flat, chewy cookies for a long time, and this worked brilliantly. Two small things that I'll change next time - I'll cook them for less time - even at 13 minutes, they were overdone and harder and crisper than I wanted, even though they're a chewy cookie. Secondly, I'll add a touch less baking soda next time - the baked cookie tasted a little much for my liking (could be the over-cooking though). Very easy to make too, which was a plus when doing these as a treat with my 3 year old :)

To die for. I added orange zest, was out of this world. Don't worry about the third egg, just use 2 extra large eggs, it made no difference. And room temp butter was fine. I love using kosher salt because you get a burst of salt against the sweet. These are amazing, sort of cakey in the center. Whole family agrees, best CC cookies EVER!!!!!

Yum! I love Trader Joe's Highbrow chocolate chip cookies, a wonderful flat, crispy, buttery chocolate cookie. So I set out to find a recipe to duplicate them. This recipe is even better! I made exactly as is, only I added some chopped pecans. Divine! The cookies are large, flat, crispy, and buttery. They do not have too many chocolate chips, they are perfect. I found that by using a 1/4 cup measuring cup to measure the dough, I was able to make approximately 30 cookies. I baked mine at 375 for 13 minutes, and they were perfect!

They're still coming out coming out of the oven right now! These simple, classic cookies are delicious. They make a sizeable amount, whether you make large or small cookies. Lots of mixing! I find that using only two cups of sugar altogether was plenty, and I could've used even less. I would definitely make these again!

I have tried this recipe three times now, each time thinking that of the several I've culled from Epicurious over time, that this is the best one since it's from Gourmet. Wrong: I am consistently disappointed in these cookies. They are come out too sweet (you can taste the grains of sugar) and too flat, and are prone to burning if you reduce the size of the cookies to a more standard cookie size, even with also reducing the time. I would not recommend these, and I finally have discarded the recipe so I don't forget, again, in the future that these cookies don't meet my standard for a great chocolate chip cookie. I would stick with the TollHouse recipe several times over instead of this recipe.

this is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Don't over bake and the cookies will be a perfect crunchy/chewy texture even after they cool off. I don't refrigerate the dough and often sub white chocolate chips.

So delicious!! I substituted Arrowhead Mills whole grain pastry flour and it could just be the recipe, but they have so much more depth than average chocolate chip cookies. For next time I would use a little less salt and sugar and beware that they are huge as other reviewers have mentioned. I used half the amount of batter for the last batch I put in the oven (also did not flatten the batter) and I much preferred this size to the recommended 1/4 C.

Rating: 4
These cookies were excellent. One change I made was to refrigerate the dough for 36 hours before baking; I've found that by doing so I end up with a cookie that is crisp on the edges and chewy at the center. Used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, they aren't quite as sweet as Nestle semi-sweet chips

Rating: 0
Just as a point of interest, this recipe is almost identical to the Tollhouse recipe but with more sugar and less flour and butter. I imagine it's a question of personal preference, so if you like this recipe but prefer your chocolate chip cookies more buttery and less sweet, you might want to look into the Tollhouse recipe.

Excellent cookie - husband loved them and he's a cookie lover but finicky. I did reduce the cooking time to 11 minutes at 375 - our oven is true to that temperature and anything over that time burned. Also refrigerated the dough but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Almost 4 forks, but am still on the quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie, but this is close. MUCH better than the standard Toll House - although those are always a good standbye

I'm 7 months pregnant, it's 1:00 in the morning, and these cookies hit the spot. I used all organic ingredients and substituted 50% of the flour for whole wheat pastry flour. Nice chewy texture, buttery flavor. It was a bit heavy on the chocolate chips but I was fine with that. I thought it might be too sweet, but maybe because I used organic sugars (which tend to be less sweet) the sweetness level was fine for me.

I'm always on the look out for recipes that are easy to adapt to a wheat free, dairy free option without skimping on taste, this is one of the better ones. I used a blend of almond, walnut & cashew flours, coconut oil instead of butter and less than half the total sugar (coconut oil is sweet!). And added 1/2c rough chopped almonds, they were a huge hit!

Chocolate lovers, you've met your match. I love chocolate as much as the next guy, but these were falling apart at how many chips were in them. Not that I'm complaining TOO much, but it does make them a bit harder to eat. Gonna cut back a little on those next time. Still the perfect picture of a good chocolate chip cookie, though.

like everyone says, these are pretty big. they came out about the size of my saucers. i thought the thing about putting "1 3/4 tbsp of the lightly beaten egg" in addition to the 2 whole eggs would be overkill, but i did it anyway and they baked nicely. i might just try to do it with the 2 eggs next time and compare the results.they were nice and crisp on the bottom and soft through the middle.

Great cookies, my favorite chocolate chip recipe so far. Made it twice. For flour both times used Bob's Red Mill whole wheat pastry flour. For chocolate: 1st time substituted chopped Lindt chocolate for chips; 2nd time used 1/2 chips, 1/2 chopped chocolate. Both were very good, boyfriend liked it better with the chips. Will make it again

AMAZING!!! I made these cookies with whole wheat flour. I added coco powder to hide the bran in it and make it more indulgent. They turned out crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle with loads of chocolate chips. I doubled the batch to freeze the dough in measured balls. The dough is great for eating raw too. Yum!!

This is a great recipe. I personally like my chocolate chip cookies to be less overwhelmed by the chocolate, so I'd cut the chips in half - 16 oz is a LOT. Mine didn't come out flat at all. They're the perfect balance between cakey and chewy. I did have to use baking powder in place of the baking soda (2 tsp powder to 1/2 tsp soda), so maybe that made a differece.

Rating: 4
I make these cookies ALL the time. My family and friends absolutely love them, although sometimes they do complain that they're a little on the big side. I highly recommend scooping some of the dough by 1/4 c., rolling them into balls, and then freezing them wrapped in wax paper and in a plastic baggie. When you want to use them, pop 'em on the cookie sheet, and by the time the oven has preheated, they're ready to flatten! Something about the freezing brings out the flavors--you get these great toffee notes! Perfect!

Rating: 2
I just didn't think these cookies were that good. There's nothing "bad" about them; they're just not the kind of cookie I like. They are flat, very sweet, and kinda greasy (especially if you underbake them, which is how I usually like my cookies -- more baked they are less greasy but crisp).

Rating: 4
For mpax, the butter quality & flour make all the difference whether this cookie bakes chewy vs. crispy. I made my first batch with Challenge butter & Pilsbury flour, and they came out perfectly high & chewy. Then I used Trader Joe's butter & King Arthur flour. The TJ butter had too much moisture, and the King Arthur flour was pre-sifted too much at the factory. This 2nd batch baked up thin & crisp, spreading too much. A 3rd batch again using Challenge butter and this time Gold Medal flour again turned out chewy with good height.

I used to live about 2 miles from the original Toll House restaurant. And years ago, one could buy little brown bags of Toll House cookies in some local grocery stores. They were so much better than any batch of cookies made with the Nestle Toll House choc chip bag recipe. This recipe is the closest I've found to those delectable treats in the brown bag! I add an extra bit of vanilla to any recipe, but other than that I followed this exactly. Don't forget to press down a bit to flatten them out. Make and enjoy.

Saw all the rave reviews and had to try them. After looking at quite a few comments, I did decide to use softened, not melted butter, and added 1/8 tsp more baking soda. Baked for the least amount of time, and they came out quite a bit darker than I like, and got crunchy when cool. Flavor is great! After the first batch I reduced the temp to 350, and baked for the 13 min. Still looked the same. Reduced the time to 11 min with the next pan (still dark). The last pan went in at 350 for 10 min. The centers did not look completely done when I took them out, but they were a bit lighter and now were chewy in the center. Maybe my oven is running hotter than I thought. I don't like cakey cookies, but these are VERY FLAT, so if you want something with even a little puff, these will be disappointing. I may try a half batch and add more flour and baking powder to see if I can get a little puff to the cookie. The crunchy ones will make wonderful ice cream sandwiches!

I love a really crisp chocolate chip cookie and these really hit the mark! I used coarsely chopped dark Valrhona chocolate instead of standard chips and added walnuts for extra taste and texture.

This is the only recipe I'll ever use again for chocolate chip cookies. They are PERFECT!

These taste so good, but I think I really screwed up when I accidentally used baking powder instead of soda. What a dork! I'm hoping that's why every batch flattened out soooooo thin that they were like the pizelles I made the other day instead of chewy cookies. I'll try again.

I was very skeptical when I saw that this was a "best of epicurious" receipe. I proclaim my self a connoisseur of chocolate chip cookies- having made around 45 different recipes and eaten countless chocolate chip cookies in myself. I am not going to say this was "the best," but I will say these are really darn good, and are a current favorite. I used 1 1/4 t fine sea salt, and 1 3/4 t. vanilla. They were huge cookies, but carmel-y and delicious.

I modified the recipe based on the earlier comments about reducing the salt and adding the baking powder. I also didn't melt the butter I just softened it. I also used the teaspoon size scoop as I didn't want ginormous cookies. In addition I added an extra 1/2 c. of chocolate chips (can't have too much chocolate!) and 1 c. of pecans. I cooked them at 375 for 10-11 minutes. They turned out really great. I made them to share with my brother who I was going to visit and he thought they were great too. I realize that I made several modifications but I mostly relied on earlier comments and they worked out really well. This recipe will become my new standard.

Didn't have vanilla...and didn't melt the butter. Just softened it. And these were still fantastic. Only recipe my husband and son will let me make again. And I'm not such a fan of chocolate chip cookies...but even I had to admit they were some of the best homemade chocolate chip cookies I've had!

This is my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe. Been making it since 2003 and it is consistently the most asked for baked item I make. Definitely melt the butter, but be sure to use a beater until it becomes pale and fluffy, it will happen just have patience. Sometime I will add 1/2-1 cup of cocoa powder to make an extra chocolaty cookie. I highly recommend a mix of semisweet and bittersweet chocolate chips, about 1 package of semi and 1/4-1/2 package of bittersweet. My true secret? Roll the cookie dough into balls and place on a cookie sheet wrapped in plastic wrap, once you get the whole batch made into balls freeze them. You can stick them right in the oven from the freezer for 16 minutes at 375. You will get a gooey/soft center and crispy outside. Plus you don't have to bake them all at once and you get fresh baked cookies when company comes over or you have a chocolate craving.

I made these cookies to RAVE reviews from all who tried them! I liked them better than the Tollhouse recipe and perhaps it was the kind of salt I used (organic New Zealand sea salt) or that it has a higher amount of salt that other recipes but all who liked them enjoyed the fact that they could taste the salt here and there mixed in with the sweet :) I don't know what the other poster was talking about with the melted butter - I melted it and my god once you started adding the 3 cups of flour it was thick and hard like any good cookie dough - perhaps they used too much butter? I didn't use a mixer like it called for and it was fine. I added in a LOT of walnuts too and it was great. Highly recommend!

Great recipe! As others had recommended, I softened but didn't melt the butter completely. My cookies made of 1/4-cup of batter grew into 4 1/2- to 5-inch monsters, crisp on the outside and deliciously chewy on the inside--but enormous monsters just the same! I ended up decreasing the size substantially after the first batch. Unless I were making cookies for a cafe and selling each for $2.50 a piece, I prefer more manageable spoon-dropped, 3-inch cookies instead. I feel less guilty eating smaller ones (even if I end up devouring more than one!)--and the presentation is a bit nicer for giving away. Regardless of size preference, this recipe is a keeper!

Rating: 3
I followed the ingredients exactly. I then chilled the dough for about 6 hours before baking and cooked it in 1 tbsp balls instead of 1/4c patties (still made huge cookies). I did the first tray at 375 and the bottoms burned within about 11 minutes. I lowered the oven temp to 350 and cooked the rest there for about 12 minutes. Despite the chilled dough and leaving it in a ball, they are very flat cookies and are a little darker than I'd like. But, they are delicious. I wish they were a little more full-looking, but the taste is hard to beat! Next time I might even try baking at 325 to see what happens.

I use 3 different kinds of Ghiredelli chips, 1cp semi, 1cp milk choc, 1/2cp extra dark and a bit of almond extract, use all the eggs, use cold dough on parchment paper for 14 min, do not press down, pull whole sheet of cookies off pan immediately to cool on counter.

Wonderful cookies! I would put a little less chocolate chips, but the batter is just what I was looking for. A ratio of more brown sugar to white sugar! My new cookie recipe!

It is hard to satisfy both my husband and I when it comes to the basic chocolate chip cookie. I like them chewy; he likes them crispy. I followed the recipe but only baked them for 11 minutes. The result is a thin cookie with a crisp edge and a chewy center. I have adopted this recipe as our home standard. It is a winner in our household.

I modified this recipe because my son can't have wheat or brown sugar because of allergies. I used Pamela's Gluten Free Flour mix and 2.5 cups of Turbinado sugar. The cookies turned out sooo good, my son who can eat wheat said they tasted better than "normal" cookies, but I did need to modify the baking time, they baked best at 350 for 11 minutes, it must be the different flour but the first batch burned at 13 minutes.

ATTENTION PUFFY COOKIE LOVERS!!!! 3-4 more tablespoons of flour and 1/4 teaspoon of Baking Powder and use a teaspoon size scoop - not to worry, cookies are still big. This recipe a real keeper. The instructions are lucid and useful. The guests couldn't get enough and this batch and it certainly did make enough for a crowd.

I usually don't bake because the steps are too tedious. For the first time I actually followed a baking recipe as directed because the steps were easy enough. I followed this recipe without any alterations and the cookies were perfectly baked at 13 minutes! Slightly golden on the outside, and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. My husband thought they were from a local bakery.

Yum! I made a few changes to the recipe: I used only 2 eggs to simplify, and I made these is silicone muffin cups instead of on a cookie sheet. They were delicious. Next time I would increase the salt just a bit -- I like my sweets a little salty.

I used Orgran gluten free all purpose flour in place of the regular flour to feed my cousins who can't eat gluten. I also added about a tablespoon of powdered milk. The cookies were more crispy and delicate then how they usually turn out, but were still really excellent.

These are the BEST chocolate chip cookies you could make. I am a baker, and these bring rave review every single time. I break up the chocolate chip quantity into 1/3 choc chips, 1/3 butterscotch chips, 1/3 chopped walnuts or pecans. Otherwise, don't bother altering this recipe--it is perfecto!!

We made these today and they were very good. A good basic chocolate chip recipe to go to. They are HUGE though, so I would have done them smaller. They were crispy on outside and chewy in middle perfect texture. I did have to watch the baking time carefully... only 13 min Max. I did use salted butter and only 1t of salt to compensate and that was good. My daughter and I loved making these and the family gave them a thumbs up.

Rating: 4
this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe i have ever used, i would highly recommend this. The cookies were chewy, and soft, as well as easy to make. i made a few adjustments, and only used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 2.5 , and used salted butter, instead of unsalted.

The flavor of this cookie is great. I did not flatten them and they were a little more cakey than I normally go for, but for a cakey cookie they were yummy. I will flatten them next time.

These were so delicious and came out perfectly. I only used 1 1/4 tsp of salt and did not melt the butter. I tried something new and added broken pieces of Pennysticks Brand pretzel sticks (as suggested by my 5 yr old daughter) to the batter, I baked them at around 360 for 10-11 minutes. The pretzels were a wonderful addition! I'll be making these again, but I might cut the recipe in half next time as they make an enormous amount of cookies.

Rating: 4
Wow, this cookie was so close to perfection for me! My only issue was I think it was a tiny bit too much salt for me, and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet, since that's what I had in the house. I'd love to try this again and use a combination of dark and white chocolate chips, has anyone tried this before?

Rating: 3
I halved this recipe, but only used 1/4c of butter and two whole eggs to replace the wetness in the dough. They were yummy, but a bit cakey for my taste. I suppose if I had used the proper amount of butter, or even a bit more, they would've come out more crisp. Overall, a delicious cookie. I'd make them again.

Rating: 4
I forgot to mention that I baked the cookies for 10-12 minutes. I recommend watching the cookies and baking only until they are just brown and just starting to crack on the top. I over- baked my first batch (14 mins) which made them less-chewy (but still yummy).

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe to the last detail (including the partial egg). I gave these cookies out to people at work and they all thought that I had bought them, because they were so good and because they were huge. My only complaint is that the cookie was a little salty. I'm not sure if this was because I used kosher salt. I would probably cut the salt down to half. Unlike the one review that said that the cookies don't keep, the cookies kept for up to the three days just like the recipe said. I can't tell past three days since they are all gone. YUM!

Rating: 2
I made these a couple of days ago. they were really good, although I put only about half a teaspoon of salt, 1.5 seemed way too much. I made them huge, pretty much, cause I like big cookies, but I think they're better when made small.

Rating: 2
The amount of baking soda and salt made me nervous, but I proceeded anyway. The temperature was too high, I'm guessing due to the amount of sugar (and I added 2 tbsp of nutella) and melted butter, because they were turning a burnt color and there was some serious smoke coming out of the oven. I only cooked them for around 7 minutes at 375 degrees. They ended up being flat, but chewy and tasty, but I do detect a bit of a baking soda after-taste. I will continue to experiment.

I loved this recipe, some of the best choc chip cookies I've ever made. I used a combo of semi sweet and dark chocolate chips. They tasted great out of the oven and even a few days later, still soft!

I made these cookies this weekend and they turned out great. I used less salt as some people recommended and used Guittard Semi-Sweet chocolate chips. You can get them at Safeway, they're 100 times better than Nestle or any other chocolate I've used. In love with these cookies :)

Rating: 3
The only way to eat these is fresh out of the oven. If you wait even until they cool they lose, how can you say, a little bit of vim. Forget about them the next day. Even if you put them in Ziploc, covered in Saran and in the shade on your counter they're still going to taste not so good.

amazing cookies but do not cook at 375 cook at 350

Great cookies! 3.5 forks! Mine were not greasy at all. Golden & crisp on the outside with nice chewiness in the middle. They are not cakey, if that is your preference. I halved the recipe (only used 1 egg), melted & cooled the butter to room temperature (never let it get hot though), used 1.5c of chocolate chips & a heaping 1/4 t salt. I made 1/4 cup cookies without pressing down dough at all & cooked for 13 minutes. They were beautiful to look at & to eat! One thing to note though, I may have had my oven temp. a bit lower, somewhere between 350-375. I'm not sure. This will be my standard chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on.

I have been searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe for years. I have never found one that I completely love until now! I am so thrilled.

I made this with some bare ingredients that I found locally in the market in Austria- different kind of brown sugar, no extract, no chocolate chips anywhere... So I improvised with a condensed bourbon vanilla sugar substitute (?!) and smashed up a really dark chocolate bar... I also added in about 2 tsp.s of cinnamon.... AND OH MY GOD! Given that this is almost not this recipe (!!), these cookies are freaking DIVINE! Will keep the recipe and make however improvised or perfect wherever I go. :)

I liked the texture of this cookie. I didn't find them flat at all... The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I used 3 eggs, and didn't beat one and measure as it's written.

Easy. Easy. I used an ice cream scoop to put them onto the cookie sheet and didn't pat them down with my hand, as the recipe says. They were perfect! Not too big, not too little, semi- crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Yum.

GREAT recipe!! Used dark brown sugar instead of light, also, added in all of the 3 eggs, and only cooked 12 minutes and they came out perfectly soft in the middle and chewy around the edges! Turned the oven down about 5-10 degrees as well. All in all, this is always a big hit and makes very "professional" looking and tasting cookies! :)

I've made these cookies about 20 times now and have recieved many compliments on how delicious they are (many people say they're the perfect cookies and I'll have to agree). Don't melt the butter, as many others have said, it makes them greasy and easily burned. I've added both 1/2 -1 cup more chocolate chips with good results, though I have to say using high quality chips and adding about 1/2 cup more comes out perfect.

The baking time is too long for this recipe even if you like your cookies crispy. With a convection oven, use 10 minutes. I like a lot of chips so I thought you could definitely add at least 1/2 cup more

These are fantastic but here's the magic key: Whatever you do - DO NOT MELT the butter. I tried it that way the first time and they turn out flat as many people have mentioned. The melted butter totally ruins them! Use slightly room-temp butter and I promise you will find these to be 'Bakery Shop' worthy. I also bake them for exactly 13 minutes.

These are your basic chocolate chip cookies. They're kind of puffy and they're not very chewy. I wasn't amazed by these, and I'm actually kind of disappointed considering that the recipe is from Gourmet.

My family loved these cookies! I have trouble with cookies - I'm not much of a baker. But this was easy and delicious. I love the size and density - crispy edges and chewy in the middle.

Pretty good cookies, although nothing special. Went ahead and used 3 whole eggs. They're a little bit sweet, and they retained their shape decently (didn't get completely flat like most cookie recipes). I might make them again, but I have other cookie recipes I prefer.

Rating: 3
These were great. I followed the recipe exactly, even the weird thing with the egg, although melting the butter goes against everything I believe in! I microwaved the room temp butter 1 min so it was partially solid/liquid. If anything this recipe was like Cookies 101 for me, I never realized that you cream the butter/sugar for so long. I did the 1/4C scoops on parchment paper but didn't flatten. They spread nicely but not too much. I did a batch for 13 min and the other 15 min. I can't decide which was better, the 15 min batch was definitely crispier on the edges and had more lift, the 13 min had the chewy factor but not enough crunch. So I think 14 min will be perfect. One cookie is enough! Even my stepson couldn't eat a second. I would make these again, but my picky husband is looking for the perfect recipe that produces a super thick cookie so the search will go on...

Recipe purists-skip this review. I've made these 2xs with some adjustments. Both times only 2 cups sugar-all brown. 1 time used 2c flour 1c oats - VERY chewy, flat cookies:) 2nd time 3c flour and 3/4c oats - slightly chewy still good. Next time I'll try 2 1/2 c flour. I melted 1 stick of butter, removed, from heat, put in 2nd stick, put sugar in mixer and added butter. Only baked for 8min. I love the amount of salt - salty/sweet.

Easy money. - I used an ice cream scoop and didn't bother flattening and they baked wonderfully. - Overmix the butter and sugar, and just fold in the eggs and chips until adequately mixed. This provides the best texture with most cookies. I gave it four forks becuase the flavor, texture, and ease of prep/bake was a good combo.

The recipe was very easy to follow, and the cookies turned out pretty well. Just a hair too salty and sweet, though. Next time, I'm going to try cutting the salt and sugar. Also, I like chewy cookies so these should probably stay in the oven for 13 minutes or less.

I am not kidding - this cookie recipe changed my life. I love chocolate chip cookies -- that is, when they are made by somebody who knows how to do it right. Mine have never had a good texture. Last year I buckled down to try to solve my inferior cookie problem. I spent months researching and trying recipes (unfortunately forgetting about epicurious for some reason), testing different baking sheets and mixers, and regulating the oven temp. -- striving to achieve the right combination of chewey and crispy. I tried cold butter, room temp, melted butter, room temp eggs, more soda, less soda, powder and soda, cream, cold batter, lots of mixing, narely mixing, hot oven, slow oven, etc.! Despite great efforts, my cookies were always doomed to be cakey or fluffy. Or occasionally puddles of grease or little rocks. After reading the reviews of this cookie, I decided to give it one more try. Guess what, this cookie is perfect! My husband and teenage kids said these were the best cookies they ever had. And they taste-tested every cookie I made. There is something amazingly perfect about this recipe. BTW, even though I am a pretty competent cook, I did not change a single detail (I guess I have no confidence when it comes to c.c. cookies) I followed the recipe exactly. Usually I cut back a little on the sugar because I don't have a sweet tooth, but I did not even do that this time. This recipe is perfect exactly as it is (even the quirky egg amount!) Thanks Gourmet -- my only regret is that I did not see/try this recipe a few years ago!

I wasn't crazy about these. I think the key is in the melted butter, it should just be room temperature. Check out cooks illustrated holiday version, they tested the effects of how different ways of blending butter and sugar effect the final outcome of the cookie. Mixing room temp butter and sugar for 4 minutes turns out the best consistency and texture. Everyone raved about these so I thought I'd try them, but I also found them a little too salty, even though I LOVE salt. I won't be making these again. Martha!? Martha? I need you...

Very good (I'm still searching for my perfect recipe, but these are about the closest I've found so far). My 5 year old and 47 year old both ate more than their fair share, and the neighborhood kids and moms joined in the fun. Although I'm a chocoholic, I couldn't eat too many because they are so rich, but that's not a bad thing. Milk is a necessary and delicious accompaniment. Following other reviewers, we increased the brown sugar by .25C and decreased white sugar by same amount. We also decreased the salt to 1t and increased the vanilla to 2t. Used a coffee measuring spoon as the scoop, and baked for about 11 minutes after pressing down a bit. As another reviewer said, if you use a non- stick pan, you don't need the waxed paper (we did half with and half without -- no difference). Chock-full of ooey-gooey chips -- that's a good thing. Can't wait to try tomorrow for the day after effect I've read about.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made! If you like the sweet/salty combo, I suggest using coarse granulated sugar and a teeny bit more salt than is called for. Guittard or Ghiradelli chocolate chips are your best bet. And, yes, less cooking time ensures a chewy cookie!

Followed the directions as closely as I could. The taste was amazing and both my sister and mother said it was one of the best homemade cookies to ever come out of our oven.

I made half a recipe and my brown sugar substitute was 2 Tbls. organic molasses mixed into 3/4 cups sugar. I used 2 eggs and had to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. I wanted small cookies since that's part of my choc. chip cookie "ideal" (don't we all have one?:). I made little balls on my parchment lined cookie sheet and baked for 10 minutes on 350 (my oven runs hot), turning the sheet halfway through baking. They were soft with a bit of crisp around the edges when first baked...but the kicker was the next morning! They were soft (not cakey) with glorious chew and made my cup of coffee a party! I wanted a cookie that kept well so my husband could take them to work and I think these are the trick. The melted butter makes the recipe really easy as I always hate waiting for it to soften.

The classic and best chocolate chip cookie I've ever eaten and made. They do taste better after being refridgerated for an hour before baking. Someone mentioned way back that you can freeze the dough after shaping the cookies and they still taste fantastic. I made a huge batch for our family of three, ate a plateful, froze the rest and we were able to gorge on fresh cookies for weeks. I recommend also cutting 1/4 c sugar and increasing 1/4 c brown sugar and baking for about 11 minutes as mentioned by others.

These are some AMAZING cookies!! I made them for a group of friends last weekend and ended up having to make 3 batches b/c they just kept devouring them! Among this group were an architect and a lawyer who have very...shall we say descerning tastes! I made a couple changes...I used butter flavored Crisco and I didn't melt it...that way the cookies stay moist and chewy!!! Once again...AWESOME recipe!

There is something about melting the butter before blending it with the sugars, that makes these cookies my number one.

The texture of these cookies is amazing -- crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. The only thing I would say is that the taste could have been a little richer -- maybe a touch of more salt or vanilla?

Really tasty cookies...I cooked them for 12-13 minutes and they were still a wee bit undercooked which makes the best cookie, but these turned out with a bit of crunch as well. I thought they were very good.

Cookies tasted good, but as one reviewer said, hard as rocks the next day. I made the recipe exactly as per the instructions, however, refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking. They did not really turn out flat, but they are definitely 'crunchy'! In terms of crunch, they are more like a gingersnap than a traditional CCC in my opinion.

This recipe was great. Rich, delicious, chewy cookies that are sizeable like premium cookies you get at a cafe or deli. Watch the oven with this one - 13 mins @ 375 (I used an oven thermometer) was a little too long in my oven. This recipe is great on its own, but you can get creative with scrumptious results - I like cutting the chocolate chips down to 12 ounces, then adding 1/2-3/4 cup of shredded coconut, and 1/2-3/4 cup chopped walnuts. Chunky and delicious!

Rating: 4
Everyone seems to prefer their own "type" of chocolate chip cookie. I prefer mine to be flat, buttery, not too heavy on the chips and crispy/chewy. That is precisely how these turned out. If you like a cakey, fluffy cookie, you probably won't be happy with these. My only suggestion is to modify the size of the cookies to your preference. 1/4 cup of dough makes a big cookie...

Really good cookies! I'd say bake at 375F for about 11-13 minutes, depending on the accuracy of your oven. I split the dough in half and used choc. chips in half and butterscotch chips in the other half. Very satisfying!!

Yum! I love the way these came out. They were really buttery and chewy! Just the way i like them. The only thing i didn't like was the separating of the egg. Who uses 1 3/4 tablespoon of an egg??? so i think i will just increase the recipie next time. But otherwise my whole family loved them!

I made these cookies according to the recipe and they turned out very flat, a bit hard, and very chewy. I prefer a thicker, less chewy cookie, so I'm not happy with them. Also, they're a bit too sweet for me. For the first batch, I tried the original size the recipe suggested, and found them to be WAY too big. For later batches, I just used a heaping teaspoonful of dough and cut the cooking time down to about 9 or 10 minutes. Also, I agree with an earlier reviewer--it is not necessary to flatten the dough, since it spreads out regardless. Lastly, I didn't get the purpose of using wax paper. I forgot to use it for the first batch, but then used it for subsequent batches, and it didn't seem to matter. Overall, I'm not impressed.

I just wanted to thank the cook from Santa Monica for the wonderful tips on using Plugra butter, Callebaut chocolate, and bourbon vanilla. I made these for a function at work and peoples' eyes rolled back in their heads as they bit into them. (in a good way!) Please post more tips!

I LOVE these cookies. My friends and co-workers LOVE these cookies. In fact a high profile event during LA's Awards Season always request I bake these cookies for celebs, writers, & directors to munch on. The key to making this recipe work is the ingredients. I use Plugra butter, Callebaut semi-sweet chips, unbleached Pastry Flour, and Nielsen Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. These ingredients are a little bit more expensive, but so worth the cost. Also, I use Silpat mats to bake the cookies on. Again, a little pricey, but you'll have these mats forever. This recipe has never let me down. :0)

Liked the texture of these. The only changes I made, based on others' recommendations, were to add a touch more vanilla and to use 3/4 butter and 1/4 shortening (I used the new Crisco trans-fat-free kind), because I think they flatten less with the shortening. I used a 1/8 cup measure, flattened the dough slightly, refrigerated the shaped cookies for a few minutes, and baked 11 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet. Ate three at one sitting . . .

I'm not sure what went wrong here. These cookies look absolutely PERFECT but they were hard as rocks. I used salted butter by accident, but could barely bite into them. I increased the brown sugar and decreased the white as suggested, and I wonder if that was the problem. Any thoughts?

I agree with jilliberry. These were no better than any others, and a little sweet. If I made them again, I would chill the dough and make a little smaller. Not necessary to flatten. They do that themselves.

Per other suggestions, changed sugar ratios. Only softened butter, did not melt it. Refrigerated dough overnight after running short of time. Spread cookie dough a bit with finger tips to slightly flatten it. Cookies were superb without spreading too much. Crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside. A winner.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. I did what previous reviewers suggested, I increased the brown sugar and decreased the granulated sugar by a 1/4 cup. The 1st batch I made was of the suggested huge size, after that I decreased the size of the cookies and the baking time. My Sunday school class of boys loved them, they were especially impressed by the size. One boy told his younger brother they ate cookies the size of his head.

This recipe rescued my almost-too-ripe Michigan Cherries! These cookies are terrific. Soft, sweet little pillows of goodness.

Very Good, Read my earlier review for ways to add a different flair. Another way to try the receipe is with less chocolate chips, more light brown sugar, and more vanilla. however, for a different flair, try cutting back on some of the sugar, and using cinamon instead. For those who have the kitchen aid stand mixers, you can use only the one bowl by mixing the dry ingredients in the bowl and just adding the wet ingredients to the bowl and they come out just fine!

I followed the 1/6 cake flour suggestion, used Nestle chocolate chips, used 3 whole eggs as opposed to the partial egg directions, chilled the dough in the fridge for at least half an hour, and spooned them onto the cookie sheet by the tablespoon. The presentation was good, the smell heavenly, and the dough was great. Cookies tasted great out of the oven, but honestly, there really wasn't that much of a difference from the Toll house recipe. I think overall, the Toll house cookies are a better presentation as these do come out rather flat, but both are equally delicious. Try freezing the dough before you bake these?

Great recipe! Exactly what I was looking for - crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy in the middle, and a great buttery, toffee taste. Definitely chill the dough before baking and try using a gelato scooper (smaller than a regular ice cream scoop)to get perfectly uniform cookies that are a bit smaller than the recipe suggests.

I really liked these cookies. After trying a bunch of cakey, blah recipes, I was very pleased. I changed the recipe a bit so I would use no refined sugar.

I doubled this recipe and made about 80 smaller, 2" cookies. A few notes: I used 5/6th all-purpose and 1/6th cake flour. I also used 3/4 butter and 1/4 shortening. The combination of these two changes produced what I was looking for: a chewier, slightly puffier cookie from what the other reviewers have described. This is my preference and I was very happy with the outcome. Another note, this recipe made extremely consistent cookies. I have a crappy over than often bakes unevenly but all 80 of my cookies were perfect!

This recipe is also great when you omit the chips and instead make the cookies in a mini muffin tin (filling them about halfway with the dough). After you pull them out of the oven, press in a mini reese's peanut butter cup or a mini snickers while still in the tin and then remove. Cool and hide, they go fast!

Ohhhh, these were amazing! And still are, straight from the freezer a week and a half later. I made them because I had a craving for cookie dough (really, cookies lose some of their appeal for me after they've been baked) and I have to say that I was mildly disappointed in the dough. But not to fear, the baked cookies MORE than made up for that! I cut the recipe in half, used one egg, dark brown sugar, melted the butter, kept the vanilla the same quantity as the original recipe, and probably used at least as much as the original quantity of salt. (The combination of caramelly dark brown sugar, chocolate, and salt is INSANELY delicious and addictive!) Refrigerated the dough for an entire afternoon while I was in class, and shaped into about 1.5" balls, flattened slightly, baked for 9-10 minutes and let cool slightly on the sheet. They are AMAZING, per others' descriptions!

These cookies are amazing! I used an ice-cream scooper to portion out the dough (which turned out to be perfect). I flattened the cookies with the back of the scoop.

these cookies are awesome. Like some of the other reviwers, i too threw all the eggs in at once and increased the vanilla. These cookies had a great taxture (slightly crunchy on the outside, and soft but not underbaked or raw in the middle). Not at all cakey but not too dense either. They were also not too sweet. This cookie recipe definitely falls into a cookie camp - if you like relatively flat, non gooey, not cakey, and not overlysweet cookies you will be happy with this recipe.

I'm a novice baker and this recipe comes out great for me. The cookies are thin, chewy and (most important) chocolatey. No problem with storage at this house - they get eaten too fast.

If you refrigerate the dough till chilled and then bake them cold the cookies remain thicker and keep a soft gooey center that you expect out of a fresh baked cookie.

I thought these were delicious - but if you make them as big as the recipe calls for, one cookie should definitely be enough to fill you up!

Delicious!! To those who have an overly crunchy cookie, I recommend heating them up in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds (depending on the power of your microwave) right before serving - they taste very moiste and like they just came out of the oven.

I've made these cookies a few times and they're excellent -- haven't had one flat batch. In fact, I was hoping to get a flat batch just so I could troubleshoot.

After reading the cook from Seattle, I feel I have to come to the defense of this cookie! I'm made them four times now, and they are always a favorite. Most recently, I've made them to bring into my office, and they've gotten rave reviews from upwards of 20 people(and numerous requests for the recipe). They look impressively beautiful, taste buttery but not too sweet, and are really easy to make. One thing I did note - the cookie pan makes a difference. The standard no-sided cookie pan is a must. A pan with low sides (jellyroll pan) makes them a bit soggy, and concave in the middle.

This recipe was a major disappointment! I keep wondering if I did something wrong. Maybe I didn't cool the butter long enough, or maybe I didn't flatten the cookies down well enough (be SURE to do these things if you try this recipe). The result was a beautiful looking batch of cookies that were so incredibly buttery we were afraid to serve them to our guests! I was wooed by another cook's comment that these are not toll-house/cakey cookies but, as you can tell, I wasn't impressed.

I didn't like this one too much. My son and I both love chocolate chip cookies and we often utilize the recipe on the back of the Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chip bag. I add M&M's mini baking bits to it to make them more appealing. The thing I did not like was that the cookies become very hard (I guess because of the increase in the flour). These cookies were good if you put them in the microwave for about 8 seconds prior to eating them though. Not bad - but I think I will stick to my old recipe which is really very nice - it keeps the chips moist too. I forgot to mention that I also made the cookies quite smaller (yielded about 35-40 cookies overall), and perhaps this is what attributed to their being so dry.
