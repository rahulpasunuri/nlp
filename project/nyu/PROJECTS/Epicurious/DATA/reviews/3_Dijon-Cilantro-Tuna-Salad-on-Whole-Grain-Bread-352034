This is a delicious twist on tuna. Light, tangy and full of LOTS of flavor. I halved it and it went a long way! I ate it over spinach with sliced tomato on the side.

I haven't made tuna salad regularly, ever. I had tuna on hand and have been trying to bring sandwiches for lunch (to work) lately so I thought I'd try this. I halved the recipe; made 3 great sandwiches. I did skip the onion and increased the celery to replace - do let it sit overnight for flavors to meld. Refreshing w/ yogurt and no mayo. Excellent!

On first making this, I was somewhat disappointed. It had lots of nice flavors, but they didn't blend well. However, the next day the leftovers tasted great! I've made this several times since, giving it a day or so to sit in the fridge before serving. It lets the flavors mellow and combine. Overall, a great twist on tuna salad.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but ite was awful. If you perfer your tuna more on the dry side, this is not the tuna salad for you. My family also hated the cilantro added in.

I made this recipe exactly as written and found it to be too gloppy, and so I added a third can of tuna. Even still it was nothing great despite my hopes for an inspiring yogurt-based tuna salad. I probably won't make it again.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The strong dijon flavor overwhelmed other flavors and clashed with the sweet relish. While I loved the addition of yogurt (you won't miss the mayo a bit) and the onion and celery are great, overall nothing special.

I loved this tuna salad! I love mayonnaise and was wary of replacing it with yogurt, but I agree that it added a lightness to the taste that I enjoyed. The cilantro is unexpected but delicious.

This recipe is very similar to a basic tuna salad recipe I've been making for years. The addition of cilanto and the substititution of yougurt for mayo made the sandwich taste fresh and lighter that it usually did. This is my new basic tuna salad recipe.

I will never eat regular tuna salad again! I found the endive took over and masked all the other great flavors. I suggest leaving it off. I have been waiting for a tuna recipe that made me want tuna. I found it!
