This is my last minute, go to recipe. I've made it for a quick weeknight dessert, as well as for company and always with rave reviews. Have also made with fresh and frozen blueberries ... Excellent!

I agree with the previous review. I also had cut down to 3/4 cup sugar for the berries. Still WAY TOO SWEET. It was inedible. Also I cooked mine for 45 minutes and it was gooey. I would not make this again.

Followed the recipe as listed (except that I cut back to 3/4c sugar for the blueberries). What came out of the oven was sweet and tasted like blueberries, but it was also incredibly runny/gooey and the "cobbler" portion of it--while not what I would call a good representation of one in the first place--was far too meager to balance and complement the 4c of blueberries swimming beneath it. Unfortunate waste of good, fresh, Michigan blueberries.

I changed this up a bit, use Meyer lemons and added the zest to both the fruit and topping mix. Added cinnamon to the fruit and cut the sugar by 1/4C each. Served with whipped cream to rave reviews every time.

Too much sugar....the topping was like eating caramel, the way it sticks to your teeth. Maybe if you cut WAY down on sugar in the topping it would work out.

Just made with fresh blackberries and made the following changes: Used brown sugar with the berries, also added a dash of cinnamon and 3 tlbsps of minute tapioca to the berries to thicken. Did not have self rising flour so added 1&1/2 tlbsp of baking powder to the flour. Came out great, served with vanilla ice cream and guest loved it.

Excellent, and so simple to make! My friends loved it and asked for the recipe. (I used Tay berries - a raspberry / blackberry cross - in mine.)

Really easy. I doubled the recipe, but used half nectarines. WAY too sweet. I'd make it again, but with half the sugar, or less, with the fruit. Everything else seemed fine. The boyfriend liked it, but then he eats nutella straight from the jar.

I just made this because I had extra blueberries. Very disappointed in this recipe. It is bland. Maybe if I had vanilla ice cream it would taste better. It needs some spices. It was very easy to make. If you are looking for a simple crust free recipe like this one, I recommend the very bery cobbler recipe from the Stealth Health Cookbook. I wish I had used it like I usually do.

So easy, so fast and so yummy! Agree with the other reviewers that the sugar can be decreased...3/4 cup in the filling would be more than sufficient

I made this twice, and I halved the butter and sugar in the blueberry mixture the second time. I like how easy it was, and basic ingredients. The crust was nice and crisp out of the oven, but soggy the next day.

Oh, yummy yummy- this is GOOD!! I made it with my daughters for a casual dinner party and this WILL become a signature dish. I halved the sugar as suggested, and also dotted with brown sugar before baking, and YUM!! Everyone asked for seconds and the recipe. So easy, so delicious and it made me look like SuperWife/Mom... who could ask for more?

Oh my goodness, people - this thing is awesome! I made it with my 5 year old twins and it was simple, simple, simple, and easy. FYI, this technique is also apparently known as "Butter Batter Pie." Would I make it again? Duh.

I have been using this recipe for the past five years and I was really surprised to read that anyone could be unhappy with the results. I must have made this, using either blueberries or peaches, about 30 times and have never had it not turn out delicious. I have taken it to numerous gatherings; each time when the cobbler is served I hear the buzz, asking who made the cobbler and I have have never not been inundated with requests for the recipe. It is absolutely foolproof and incredibly easy to make. Yesterday I made three batches and baked it all together in a large roasting pan and it turned out beautifully. Everyone raved and wanted the recipe. One man said it reminded him of his Mom's cobbler. Don't be afraid to make this cobbler...it has become one of my signature dishes.

I took the advice of others and used less sugar. I also threw in a handful of flour and some cinnamon to the blueberries, which made it not watery. I did add a bit more milk to the topping so that the consistency seemed right. It was very easy and tasty.

Rating: 3
This was really watery when it came out of the oven, but it set up when it was chilled. Try to make sure you get the crust batter on evenly because you cant really spread it once it is on. And next time I make this I will cut the sugar in the berries to 1/2 or 3/4 cup. Overall pretty good though.

Topping turned out sticky and without appreciable flavor. Berries were OK, but will use another cobbler recipe from the website for my next batch.

I liked this recipe, as I had all the ingredients on hand (and usually do)- that's a big plus! No runs to the store for this one. I used blackberries, which were fairly tart on their own, so the sugar was just right. I used plain soymilk, which worked fine. The only complaint is I would like it with just a little bit more crust- but we ate it up just fine. It was even good a few days later re-heated in the microwave.

I used blackberries in this recipe. Iused 1/2 cup of sugar in filing it worked well.

Rating: 3
Less sugar in the berries and 50% more topping helped elevate this dish to four forks. Also, I crumbled a little brown sugar over the top mixed with a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and dotted it with butter before baking. Consistency was great. I cooked it longer to adjust for more topping.

this recipe was very good, i would try again, its so easy. i used 1 1/2 cups of milk.

Following other's advise, I halved the sugar and achieved great results with the blueberries. The dough however was real disaapointment, very heavy, sticky and no flavor. You can doctor it up quite a bit with success but this recipe needs alot of help.

Rating: 1
This was disappointing ... consistency was soupy & it was way too sweet (so much for a cobbler never being too sweet). Consider reducing sugar amount.

Rating: 1
Yuk! After reading the reviews and the recommended revisions, I made this with 1/2 the sugar (which was the part that worked) and used blackberries. It was soupy and the "topping" was chewy lumps of dough! I have made cobbler several times before and this was the worst!

This was wonderful! Very moist and juicy (and simple!). Really enjoyed it. A keeper.

I was searching for a blackberry cobbler recipe, since I don't have my Mother's. We were having a memorial "dinner on the grounds" for my church in Texas which is 150 years old. 150 years of excellent cooks is a major challenge. This modern version tastes like the cobblers I remember, as a child, and it's easy and foolproof. It was a big hit.

Yummy desert which is improved by reducing the sugar. Another revision, which was a big hit, is to add crushed walnuts with the melted butter.

Rating: 3
We REALLY liked this. Although I will reduce the sugar in the filling by half next time, we especially enjoyed the juiciness of this recipe. I know some others didn't care for it, but we thought it was great! This version has become our new favorite of the 4 blueberry cobbler recipes from Epicurious that we have made so far.

I tried the recipe again with 2 Tbsp butter and 1/2 c sugar in the filling + 1/2 c sugar in the batter - cooked it a bit longer and the blueberries were much less runny - what a fantastic result -- my 7 year old daughter (who hates blueberries and eats very little of anything) said "I really love this cobbler, especially the crust."

I made this for an impromptu barbeque yesterday. I don't like things syrupy sweet, so I followed the other cooks' suggestions and lowered the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also decreased the butter to 5 Tbsp and added 2 Tbsp cornstarch to the blueberry mixture. Delicious! My guests raved and there wasn't a clean bowl in the bunch. I will definitely make it again. I don't have an 8x8 square baking dish, so I used a 9 1/2 inch round one; this apparantly had no effect on the outcome despite the warning in the recipe.

Like another reviewer, I had a sugar issue with this recipe. Two cups of sugar is a bit much! My first batch came out almost unpleasantly sweet, but I tried it again a second time, this time with a total of about 1 1/4C sugar. I also added a pinch of salt to the batter to offset all the sweetness, and it came out much more palatable. Otherwise, it was super easy to do, so I'll definitely make it again with the modified sugar ratio.

Very easy and delicious.

This was quite easy to make, as well as tasty, BUT I would definitely add some much needed corn starch to the blueberry mixture to absorb some of the natural juices. It came out too "soupy" and as a result, the topping was a little soggy.

We enjoyed this with fresh blueberries we picked in the Georgia mountains! Very good and will make it again.

After reading rave reviews for this recipe I couldn't wait to try it out on the 16-dollars worth of blueberries I bought. I was very disappointed. I didn't bat an eye at the two cups of sugar called for in the recipe, but after watching my boyfriend's mouth pucker up and grimace uncomfortably, I knew there was something wrong. In fact, after the cobbler cooled a little bit, I went back to taste it. The sugar actually reconstituted and became granular again. You North Carolinans sure do have a sweet tooth!

This dish is so delicious and easy. This time I made it with half blueberries and half rasberries. I also reduced the butter by 3 tbs and served it with non-fat whip cream. We still loved it.

been making this recipe with peaches for years, only difference peaches went on top. EVERYONE loves IT.

We moved into our first home, a 1920's California bungalow, six years ago this August. There was an established garden and we found we had a bountiful apple tree that gave us amazingly delicious fruit. I discovered this exact recipe then and made it continuously for everyone because it is so easy and delicious and failure proof. What I didn't know then, that I'm thrilled to know now, is that it's an old North Carolina recipe. Because that's where I was born and grew up. No wonder it's so good!

It's also excellent with canned peaches!! Omit other ingredients for the filling, drain most of the juice from 2 15oz cans of peaches and follow previous instructions. You won't believe how quick and easy this is. You can put it in the oven just before sitting down to eat, and it will be ready when you finish eating! I assure you that everyone will love it!
