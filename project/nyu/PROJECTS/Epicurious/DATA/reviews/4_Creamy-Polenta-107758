I'm extremely disappointed with this recipe. Within seconds of removing it from the stove top, the polenta turned into a rubbery substance that was inedible. Definitely not a fan!

Well...it might work as a base recipe, but this polenta is definitely not my favorite. In fact, I found that it became rubbery about 30 seconds after removing it from the heat. Maybe it would have benefitted from more frequent stirring episodes or less cooking time, or maybe it just needed the help of cream...

The polenta was very easy to make and came out perfectly! This was my first experience with polenta but I will definitely be making it again soon! It was a big success at our dinner party.

Great standard polenta recipe. It can easily be halved or quartered. I always try to use half chicken stock and half water. It makes the polenta so much more flavorful and tastier! I love this recipe.

Perfect and easy side dish. Kids loved it too..I saved some to pan fry the next day with breakfast.

This was so simple and delicious. I used yellow cornmeal. At first I was skeptical how something with so few ingredients could taste so good! I added some shredded aged gouda cheese the last 10 minutes of cooking for added flavor. I halved recipe and it still made tons. I saved the leftovers in small ramekins and it solidified for a more 'solid- type' polenta.

Excellent! This is a fantastically easy and delicious side dish recipe. I use 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken stock for extra flavour. Usually finish with a handful of quality parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.

I love this method, especially because it allows you time to do other things (like prepare a ragu) while cooking. I usually quarter the proportions (to cook for two) and finish it off with a little black pepper and parmesean.

This was WONDERFUL!! I used fresh good quality yellow corn meal. Took other cooks' advise used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock. Finished the polenta with 4 T. Butter and some good quality smoked gouda cheese. This was light, fluffy and full of flavor. Served with the Pot Roast with Red Wine and Porcini Mushroom recipie found on this site. Lots of layers of flavor...heavenly. An elegant addition to my recipie collection.

Made this to accompany braised lamb shanks. It was very easy (much better than standing over a hot stove stirring for 40 minutes!) I added butter and parmesan at the end. As creamy polenta would only give the recipe 3 forks, but cooled, cut into wedges and fried in butter it was fabulous! Maybe just becase it sat overnight and the flavors blended a bit more. Tasted much cheesier the second day and the corn taste was less pronounced. Maybe I should have just added more cheese? Very good creamy and excellent fried!

This is one of my favorite receipt. Reminds me of my grandmother. I like to put it into a loaf pan, let set overnight and slice in thin pieces. Fry in oil until golden brown. Great for breakfast.

Very easy. Used roasted vegetable stock instead of water. Added butter and parm and sauted mushrooms the last 10 minutes. Outstanding

Yum Yum, I added 3/4 cup of Locatelli cheese at the end and it was wonderful, this is the easiest polenta recipe that I have found. M

Great basic recipe. I usually make this with chicken or vegetable stock and almost always add cheese of some kind and roasted garlic, sometimes a chopped sweet onion as well, sauteed in a little olive oil and butter.

I have made this type of recipe for a couple of years. It is a very homey and comforting side dish. I use half water, half chicken broth, or all broth. It adds flavor instead of just water. I also stir in some grated smoked Gouda cheese, which tastes excellent.
