This was tasty and my guests really liked it. I like the addition of the sugar to the vinaigrette; it tempers the lemon, which can sometimes be a bit much. I made the dressing and let it sit a while, which ended up softening and sweetening the shallots, which I really liked.

We really enjoyed the Lemon Dressing. I even substituted a packet of Sweet'N'Low for the required sugar, and it still tasted great. We liked the Boston lettuce with the Lemon Dressing, but we weren't as fond of the radishes.
