This is my standard brownie for folks who really like chocolate. I've made them countless times and always get requests for more. The coffee and cinnamon make for a unique flavor.

I have been making these brownies for almost 7 years now. These are the best brownies I've ever made. Moist and gooey, rich and intense with flavor. I never use powdered instant espresso either, just throw in the grounds! These never fail me for rave reviews!! Best if you bake them the night before, they're gooey coming out of the oven, but once they've cooled completely, they're perfect.

Mediocre. For 3 sticks of butter and 6 eggs, I expect something densey and fudgy and rich. These were cakey and dull. The cinnamon does give a nice edge, but there are better brownie recipes out there.

I don't understand why this recipe doesn't have more reviews. Maybe people overlook it when searching for brownie recipes because the name doesn't have "brownies" in it? They were terrific! Thick, moist, full of chocolate flavor with just a hint of cinnamon. Do bake them the full 45 minutes, though, or they may be too gooey.

Just because my Super ultimate chocolate fudge brownie is the best.

Every time I make these, they get better. You'll never make brownies from a box again!

I have made these brownies dozens of times and they always turn out great! It is important for them to sit out over night to get the full moistness.
