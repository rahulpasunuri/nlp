I was looking for a quick and easy use for left over ham. The recipe was easy and quick, but so are pork and beans. It was kind of a cross between bad jambalaya and mediocre fried rice. I think I'll try something else next time.

Woderful, quick, and easy. We've made this several times. Added more peas and sometimes diced carrots. Our company loved it.

Easy week day dinner. I used red bell pepper and some chopped onion. My husband liked it also. I served it as suggested with asparagus and it was a complete meal.
