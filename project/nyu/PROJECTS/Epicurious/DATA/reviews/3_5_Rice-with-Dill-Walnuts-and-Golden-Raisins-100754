Not good. Even with nearly twice the dill and raisins, this dish just didn't do it as a side dish and certainly wouldn't hold up on its own.

I made this recipe twice for family and friends and they all raved about it. I added more walnuts, dill, and raisins (both times) and it came out perfect. I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious! Next time, I will reduce the amount of rice slightly in order to have more "stuff" and more flavor. Also, I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and it came out too wet, so I will reduce the proportion of water to rice as well.

This is a wonderful dish. My hubby (who normally doesn't like rice at all) has requested I make this on a regular basis. We all loved it.

Served this with the Lemon Chicken, and it was perfect. Thought it might be too much tang, but it was a huge hit. Made extra and had the rice alone as a meal/snack next day. Perfect combination of sweet, tangy and nutty.
