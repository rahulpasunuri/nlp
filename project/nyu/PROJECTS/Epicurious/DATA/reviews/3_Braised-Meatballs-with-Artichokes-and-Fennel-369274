I get goat meat at a nearby Middle Eastern market and grind it myself. I have also seen goat meat in Mexican and some Asian markets. This recipe is delicious with several nuanced flavors -- certainly company worthy. Sorry so many of the reviewers were non-reviewers (not adventuresome enough to try it).

I made this using frozen meatballs (sorry all you foodies but I didn't have time to make my own, no matter the meat) and extra frozen artichokes. The sauce was awesome, and whole dish was easy this way. Great comfort food after shoveling snow. It was even better two days later as leftovers!

prepared this 1-21-2012 using ground elk meat and adding beef broth and more tomatoes via good quality canned with broth. Upped the cinnamon too. Will let you know

To all those who express dismay, disinterest or ignorance about goat please know that goat is the meat most often eaten in the world. Most often. In the world. Not in the USA, which is it's own world. As for sources give this a try http://www.heritagefoodsusa.com/

Don't knock it until you have tried it. I went to a dinner party some months ago and commented on how good the main dish was (my friend is a chef) and was surprised to learn dinner was goat!! I would have been hesitant to try it had I known in advance, but so glad I tasted it, YUMM!! Looking forward to making this recipe tonight. tx.

I subbed ground lamb, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The sauce and the meatball seasonings are really tasty.

only a new yorker could be so condescending! of course "non-NY cooks" know about other "world culture cuisines." how can you be so narrow-minded? this recipe had a shock value--that is, it sounded delicious by its title "Braised Meatballs with Artichokes and Fennel." but when you go to the recipe and read the first ingredient, its appeal is lost in "1 pound goat"! i don't care if goat is a main protein in some cultures-- that has nothing to do with me liking this recipe. but to say that i have limited knowledge of other cultures is so pompous, even for a NYer.

I haven't tried this recipe, but it sounds interesting. Lamb, venison or pork could be good substitutes for goat. Obviously, the "cooks" who commented about using goat are limited in their knowledge of world culture cuisine. Many cultures raise and consume goat as their main animal protein. Try it, you might like it!!!

Can you substitute ground veal, or a mixture of ground meats for this recipe ? It sounds delicious !

Can you recommend a source for ground goat? I don't think the local Whole Foods or Safeway keep that handy.

Really?.. 1 lb Ground goat and 20 other ingredients, for meatballs? I can't imagine the rewards out-weighing the effort. I'm going to pass on the one.
