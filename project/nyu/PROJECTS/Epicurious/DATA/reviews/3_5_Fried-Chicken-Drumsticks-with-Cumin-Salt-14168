Has anybody tried oven baking this recipe instead of frying it?

I used garlic and onion salt instead of salt and cumin. I would recommend constantly turning it when it's frying so you dont burn one side. Also with drumstick, the meat is tends to be thicker. Consider placing the lid on top to help cook it internally.

Made this exactly to the recipe and it turned out well. Made it a second time and accidentally added another 1/2 tablespoon cumin to the flour mixture. Even better! Make sure you allow 10- 15 minutes for drumsticks to rest before eating. Goes great with buttermilk dressing salads to help use up leftover buttermilk and the fresh tang of the buttermilk compliments the chicken. NOTE: Found it to be too much salt/cumin seasoning for finishing but of course you can adjust to taste.

Very easy. Really good. Added some panko to the flour mixture and let the drumsticks set after dredging while the oil heated. Will definitely make again - esp. since I want to try it with the lime wedges as someone else suggested.

YUMMY! This is our new favorite fried chicken recipe. We love cumin so this is right up our alley. I took a reviewer suggestion and added a dash of cayenne to the marinade and served w/wedges of lime.

Quick and easy fried chicken. The best part is that you can change the seasoning, and it changes the flavor of the chicken. Season with garlic powder or chili powder instead of cumin, and you've got a whole new dish. It's also really tasty as is, served with Indian-style jasmine or curry rice. I make it 2 or 3 times a month.

Loved this recipe! Added a bit of panko bread crumbs for an extra bit of crisp to the chicken and a touch of cayenne to the cumin salt for a little spice. Took it to a football tailgate party and everyone raved. Definitely recommend this recipe.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. My own fried chicken tastes better.

This recipe was so easy that it belied just how tasty it really is. I recommend buying the cumin seed and then grinding it in pepper mill. Both the aroma in your kitchen as well as the flavour the next day will make it all worth the effort. The only trick to this recipe is constantly turning the chicken so it does not burn the coating. I served it with mashed and baked yukon gold potatoes and blanched baby carrots and a few very cold corona beers and it was a major hit!

This chicken was so EASY to make & so very tasty!!My whole family enjoyed it, especially myself who doesn't normally eat drumsticks!! I did add a variety of seasonings with the flour besides cumin,and let it cook a little longer, but it all came out so wonderful!! Thanks!!

I ALSO ADD ABOUT 1/2 TEASPOON OF MILD CHILI POWDER TO SEASONING MIXTURE. SERVE WITH SQUEEZES OF FRESH LIMES. FABULOUS.
