Wow! Made this for guests and they are still talking about it days later. REALLY easy and over delivers in taste and presentation. I doubled the recipe, used a combination of glazed and cinnamon doughnuts, used freshly grated nutmeg and extra lemon and rum. Amazing! Will make this again and again.

I put the donuts under the broiler for about 1 minute each side. I used glazed donuts.

Only 4 forks?! Needs more. This dessert was EASY and killer good. Its like bread pudding/bananas foster/banana sundae all in one. 10 on the Yum meter!

This was fabulous. Super easy. Don't change a thing! We had cinnamon donuts and thought they were a perfect choice. :)

It doesn't say at what temperature to preheat the oven or to bake while making it! Does anyone know?

This was excellent. I think glazed is the best. We did not use nuts and did not think they were necessary.

This recipe is so simple to make and yet it tastes like a dessert at a fine restaurant. The warm sauce and slightly crisp exterior of the doughnut combine well with with the ice cream. Elegant & delicious!

This recipe sounded bizarre to me, but after reading the reviews, I think I'm going to give it a try.

I used big glazed donuts from the bakery & they got all carmelized & crispy in the toaster oven. The sauce was wonderful & the cinnamon & lemon juice gave it an extra dimension. We were all licking our plates.

I had everything on hand except the doughnuts when I found this recipe and made it anyway, a little less guilty feeling at that! Delicious!

This was a wonderfully easy dessert with a lot of visual appeal. It "wowed" my dinner guests. I didn't have dark rum on hand and substituted brandy with no noticeable difference in taste. I would definitely make this again.
