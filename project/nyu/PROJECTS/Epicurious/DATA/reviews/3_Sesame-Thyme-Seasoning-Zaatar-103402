I have read that sumac has an astringent fruity lemony flavor with some tang to it. I also have read that Za'atar has a grassy flavor. So perhaps lemon grass (which can be ground in a coffee maker), which has a wonderful fruity, lemony flavor OR zest from a meyer lemon could be substituted. I am going to try it sometime.

I haven't made this recipe, but I was reading the comments - You can order ground sumac from ethnicgrocer.com

for the Israel expatriates, I can offer this: a restaurant in Glendale, California called THE BLUE PYRAMID sells both Zatar (thyme and sesame seeds) and sumac, each in 1 lb bags. I have bought both and they are wonderful, separate and/or mixed, as table condiments (especially as a "dip" with good olive oil). Maybe if you contacted them you could mail order them? good luck!

I make za'atar frequently and have substituted summer savory for the sumac, plus I add 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper for some heat.

After looking for sumac in the dictionary and in three specialty stores and still not finding out what it is, I gave up and subsituted cumin. It tasted ok but not authentic. My husband loved Za'atar when he lived in Israel, so we had relatives send us some from there to serve with tomoato and cucumber sald with pita bread for next time.
