I've been making this recipe on New Year's for several years, serving it with hot sauce on the side for guests who like things with moore oomph. This year I added a few ideas from other reviewers and it was outstanding. Modifying it to use a pound of black eyed peas, all other ingredients scaled accordingly: I started by lightly browning a chopped fresh andouille sausage before adding the vegetables, then added a bunch of chopped Swiss chard with the kielbasa. Added great depth and didn't need the hot sauce! By the way, the quick soak method works fine, but you should cover the beans before letting them sit, which the recipe does not say.

Tweaked it a bit and it was outstanding. In addition to everything in the recipe as shown, I added swiss chard to the sauteing veggies and kielbasa. Used an entire 1-lb. bag of BEPs which caused me to increase quantities of all other ingredients. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Took a lot longer than stated to soften the BEPs (over 1 hour covered and simmering) even though I soaked overnight. It is so flavorful and yummy! I have made this recipe on New Year's for a few years now and it's a favorite.

Needs more...oomph. I was uneasy about quick-soak, so I used 2 cans of seasoned BEP. I used 5 cloves of garlic, 2 jalapenos, about twice the kielbasa. I added chile powder, cayenne, cumin (a palmful), and a couple dozen drops of habenero sauce..even added more hot sauce after cooking, still found it lacking. I also think the kielbasa should have been browned before adding the vegetables. I had hoped it would be as good as Mama's BEP casserole from another site.

We just moved to SC and I made Hoppin John for the first time ever with this recipe. It was delicious and I wish I'd doubled the recipe!! I did use ham instead of the kielbasa and added some red and green bell pepper, and probably could have used the whole jalapeno. I also added a dash of ground coriander in place of the coriander leaves.

Immediately prior to viewing this recipe, I was viewing another one for Greek black-eyed peas. Someone reviewed it saying it wasn't a true Greek recipe. I thought they were overreacting.....but this goes too far, Epicurious!! How dare you degrade the fine Southern lore of Hoppin' John by stupefying it with kielbasa in lieu of fatty pork (ham, jowl, knuckles, whatever.)? The food gods cannot be happy about this! ;-)

I made some small changes, out of prefernce as well as necessity: I about doubled or tripled the garlic and used andouille instead of kielbasa. Also, because I couldn't get my hands on any coriander/cilantro, I planned on using sage, but forgot to add it in the end (shucks!). Like a previous commenter, I have a bottle of liquid smoke I never know what to do with, so I added a dash to the dish. The end result was very satisfying, although I wonder whether the herb might have really taken it to the next level. Were I to make this again, I'd definitely add the herb to finish. I'd also consider adding the entire jalapeño.

I perused all recipes on Epicurious & glad I picked this one. Reviewer suggestions were very helpful so here are mine. I started w/ dried peas, overnite soaking, and found the recipe quantity of broth inadequate. One reviewer suggested chopped tomato on top as a garnish. Instead, I used 1 14-oz can of diced tomatoes. It was a delicious addition & solved my liquid problem. Otherwise, I would have added another 14-oz can of broth. Other changes, I used about 6 garlic cloves, 2 jalapenos, 1 chopped red bell pepper, plus a couple shakes of crushed red pepper - and, no, it wasn't too spicy. It took a good 2 hrs to cook peas. Served it w/ wild rice blend. My husband scarfed it and can't wait for the leftovers!

My husband & I were originally served this dish about ten years ago at a friend's home. I've been making it every New Year's Day since and my family loves it! I substitute a can of chopped green chilis for the jalapeno as we are not jalapeno fans. Mine tastes better when I soak the peas overnight instead of the quick soak method. Cornbread is a MUST with this dish! Great recipe!

Oh, forgot one another adjustment - a dash of liquid smoke.

I'm not a big fan of black-eyed peas, but always make them for New Years - I'll take my good luck anywhere I can get it! There's a different recipe I usually make, but needed something halal for my Muslim brother, and think turkey bacon is terrible for cooking. But turkey kielbasa is a reasonable substitute. This came out much better than I remember from the last time I made it  thanks to all for your suggestions! A few variations, of course: used the whole jalapeno, without the seeds, more garlic and added a little habanero sauce and a dash of vinegar. Left it too late to find dried black-eyed peas, so substituted 2 cans. Probably doubled the kielbasa, and added ½ each of a red and green pepper. I also did it in the slow cooker (after cooking meat, garlic & onion) with only 1 c of liquid (beef broth) for several hours, even though the beans were pre-cooked, and I think this really improved the flavor.

This is a good base recipe, but I felt it was a bit bland. I ended up adding some Old Bay seasoning and quite a bit of Tabasco. I also added yellow and orange bell pepper for color. I would make it again with those additions.

I made this today after reading the good reviews. I did soak my BEP's overnight. I added green and red bell peppers to the list of ingredients and would always do that. I have to say as I was putting it together I was a little worried. It seemed thin and the beans were still a little too aldente. I was worried no one would like it so I left it on simmer and went to the store for something else to make. The extra time on the stove improved this to wonderful. Served it over brown rice with hot sauce on the side. Everyone loved it. P.S. I doubled the whole recipe and it only fed 5

I love this recipe and it is a New Year's tradition. My notes are: * I double up on the beans and broth. Also, I soak the beans overnight. * We like lots of garlic - I use 6 -8 cloves. * We like things spicy; hence I use 2 jalapenos. * I use two stalks celery and one small-medium sized fennel bulb. It adds a nice depth to things. * I usually use turkey kielbasa, but I also like to add a smoked ham shank.

I make this recipe every New Year and it's quite good. I usually use fresh black eye peas that are available in our area seasonally. When I opened the package this year, they had a distinct mouldy smell so I substituted 2 cans of beans, rinsed. Saved a lot of time and I really couldn't tell the difference. Secondly, this dish tastes better than it looks - dull and gray. I've been adding one chopped red bell pepper and one chopped green pepper. It not only looks prettier, it tastes better.

I used turkey kielbasa to be healthier, but I would not recommend it. The sausage I used didn't have any flavor once the dish was done cooking.

Loved it! I didn't read the introduction of this recipe before going to the grocery store. Every store we went to was out of black- eyed peas, so we decided on pigeon peas (canned) we found in the ethnic aisle, what luck! We used hot chorizo and didn't use the amount of broth since the peas were cooked. Also, used dried coriander since I didn't have fresh. This is a hearty winter meal, and we'll definately make it throughout the year.

Definitely a hit. I used turkey kielbasa, and it was great. My son was very suspicious of it, but went back for seconds. Will make again.

Hoppin' John is part of the menu every New Year's Day. This year I tried this recipe instead of my usual, and this will definitely replace the old one! I accidentally bought fresh kielbasa, so we grilled it first. We also added a little chorizo. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I seeded and removed the membrane of the jalapeno, so it wasn't very hot at all. So yummy!

Made this for New Year's and it was great! I made it pretty much according to directions, but used regular (not quick-soaked) peas and substituted leftover honey-baked ham for the kielbasa. Mine turned out very spicy with just the 1/2 jalapeno. I must have had an extra hot pepper. I love spicy foods and still thought it was hot, but good. It was too spicy for my kids to eat, though, so you might want to set some aside without the jalepeno if you have young children. Before eating this, my husband said not to give him very much because he wasn't hungry ... then he went back for thirds!

Followed the recipe fairly close, except, sliced my keilbasa and broiled prior to adding, and, used canned (couldn't get fresh or frozen and ran out of time to soak dried) black-eyed peas that were drained and washed. One other thing a little bit different was to cook the onion, celery, garlic, japlapeno mixture for 30 minutes before adding the broth, peas, and broiled keilbasa. The jalapeno gave it a nice kick. Though I'm not a big pork eater, I would definitely make again for a New Year's Day good-luck dish!

I took the suggestions of the other commenters when making this for New Year's Eve. It was a hit! I used fresh (frozen) black eyed peas (plunged them in boiling water, and brought back to boiling again, then boiled for 3 minutes and drained) while sauteeing the other ingredients. I used smoked turkey kielbasa--delicious ( I used Hillshire Farms brand--I'm sure any brand would be great. I combined everything in a slow cooker and added a can of tomato paste and cooked on High for 5 hours.

This was really good, even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used andouille sausage and a whole jalapeno. Also, since this dish always calls for greens, I used broth from the ham hock in place of the chicken broth called for in the recipe. Delicious!

I have made this recipe several times, as it is a favorite winter comfort-food in our house. However, I've discovered it works out great in a slow cooker as well. Saute the onions, garlic, kielbasa, etc. as normal, then dump everything into a pre-heated slow cooker. Just reduce the amount of stock by half and leave it on five or six hours. I started it out on high until it really got bubbling, then set it on low the rest of the time.

Wow, this was really good! I've had a bag of black-eyed peas in my cabinet for about a year, not knowing what to do with them, and this was a great choice. I quick-boiled them by boiling them for 20 minutes, and they turned out fine. P.S. This website rules! I always get great recipes and the reviews are exremely helpful. Keep up the good work Epicurious!

to the cook in Mount Airy MD. Just think how bad it could have been if you hadn't made Hoppin John! Used fresh peas because they were available. Used Choritzo because no one around here has good Kielbasa. Added lots more Jalapeno and several slpashes of Crystal Hot Sauce just because and finally reduced broth a little so not too soupy. Heary and warming on New Year's Day

Like others, we make this recipe annually; it has become a tradition. The first year I couldn't find dried peas and used a 12-oz package of fresh peas instead -- delicious that way too.

Rating: 4
This is an easy, comfort-food dish--the only thing it needs is more jalapenos or hot sauce. Two caveats about making it for NYD: (as per previous reviewer) buy your beans early; the shelves empty quickly, AND, speaking only from my experience, the dish didn't do, ahem, beans, for prosperity or luck in 2003--to the contrary, in fact. I will make it again plenty, just not for New Years!

Although I grew up in the South, I wasn't familiar with the New's Year day tradition of making Hoppin' John for luck. I read about it this New Year's Day in the New York Times, of all places. I happened to have most of the ingredients, as well as some greens, and I figured we can all use some good luck! Of the several recipes available at Epicurious, this one sounded the best. And indeed, it turned out so good that I have made it a half dozen times since! I made one substitution, not having any kielbasa that first time, I used spicy chorizo sausage (removed from the casing and crumbled up). Yum!! I like to serve the beans over rice, rather than mixing them. It's perfect with some sauteed greens and either a pork or chicken main dish.

Actually, my brother -- a wonderful cook -- made this recipe, at my request, for a New Year's Day brunch at my house. People loved it, even those who fessed up that they normally dislike black-eyed peas. He made delicious collard greens to go with the Hoppin' John (we skipped the rice accompaniment) and folks ate it up. This is a delicious recipe.

This will become a New Years Day tradition in our kitchen. It was very easy and very good. I followed the recipe except I added some chopped, browned chicken thighs. Word to the wise...buy your black eyed peas a few days before as my store was cleaned out!! I used a package of seasoned Black Eyed Peas made by "Grandma Maud" and it worked fine. Try it...Yum!

I doubled the entire recipe, but followed it exactly. I will add more meat next time as another reviewer suggested and perhaps some diced tomatoes or tomato paste. I found it a bit too brothy. We served over rice with Trappy's hot sauce...yum. We served the cabbage soup with apples and thyme from this site as the first course to complete our New Year's Day tradition of the cabbage, pork and black eyed peas.

I decided to make this dish for my new husband who has never experienced the Southern tradition of eating Hoppin' John for New Year's luck. We both loved the dish; however, we also felt it needed to be spiced up a bit. Crystal hot sauce did the trick--it added the right amount heat with some vinegar to make things zippy. Yum! Yum!

I made this today, but with some changes in order to use some leftovers in the fridge. I added some minced red & green peppers along with the whole jalapeno and some red pepper flakes for kick. I deglazed the pan with wine before adding extra broth, a dash of tomato, thyme and cooked the rice in the pot along with canned beans rather than dried. Served alongside collards it was a delicious dinner. I hope it brings me LUCK!

Black-eyed peas, collards greens and cornbread; a New Year's tradition in the south which reportedly brings "good luck" for the year. I add the suggested ingredients to canned black-eyed peas which cuts down on preparation time so I can kick back and watch football with my family.

I made this for New Year's, and had no idea black-eyed peas could be so delicious! I substituted about 6 ounces of Smithfield salt pork for the kielbasa. Talk about incredible flavor! I am impressed that such a simple recipe is so good. I also soaked the beans 6 hours rather than the quick soak method, doubling the recipe, but not the meat.

Loved this! I think it would be just as good with leftover ham. I didn't put in as much coriander as the recipe called for, and was sorry I didn't. Also, soaking the beans overnight is less work (I think) than the quick soak method. You just have to remember to do it before you go to bed!

This was the first time I made black eyed peas that weren't open from a can! This is an awesome recipe and also very easy. Instead of the sausage, I added smoked turkey wings(purchased from grocery store). I pulled off the meat, diced it up and threw in the bones along with it. I let it simmer for about 2- 2 1/2 hours. The flavour cannot be described by words,just ummmmm......YUM!

Just great! Being a city girl from the north, this was a new adventure for me. I used six tablespoons of fresh cilantro instead of the three tablespoons of coriander recommended.
