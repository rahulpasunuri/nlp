I added a tiny bit of brown sugar to the crust after finishing it and realizing it was bland and salty, but it was too late to make a real difference. Although my guests raved about it and asked for the recipe, I found it disappointing--not enough apple filling, and too much bland crust.

The crust needed more than twice the ice water, and I took several reviewers' advice & added more lemon & a layer of almond paste on the crust. I then glazed it with hot apricot jam. It was PERFECT. Swoon-worthy perfect.

Really simple and delicious. I had a Mimosa jam on hand and it substituted well for the apricot. I also added a bit of lemon juice to the apples for more tartness, and switched to coarse Demerara sugar for the last 2 tablespoons for sprinkling. I made this for a dinner party and used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust instead of making the dough (gasp!) and loved the result. One last thing... My ttart was smaller than the pan I cooked it in, and by happy accident the juices ran over as it was cooking and caramelized under the crust. Wow was that delicious. I hope I can replicate that the next time!

This is very similar to the Apple-Frangipane Galette recipe by David Lebovitz, who was also a chef at Chez Panisse . The frangipane really makes a difference.

I'm not sure I should review this, because I used the crust from the Almond-Pear Galette and used fig preserves instead of apricot, but it turned out well. I made it for a party with the Almond Pear Galette and a plum galette.

Following this recipe to the letter results in a beautiful desert that sets up salivating expectations that are not met. First, the apricot preserves bring little to the party except to diminish the pleasurable taste of baked apple. Second, the crust is not as flakey or as tasty as my usual pie dough, due to the all-butter content of this recipe. The next time I make it, I will make the crust in my usual way, eliminate the apricot and perhaps find a different taste-surprise instead. It's a good basic recipe, and baking on parchment paper really is advisable.

This turned out so pretty and delicious! My desserts tend to be on the "tastes better then it looks" side, but I really took the time to layer the apples and I'm glad that I did.

I am known for this tart. Rarely am I allowed to make any other dessert. I can make some other, fabulous dessert, and all I hear is "why didn't you make the apple tart". When requested out of season, my cries that it is not apple season are met with "who cares". It's that good. My modifications: a very scant teaspoon of granulated sugar in the dough, and a pretty good drizzle of a coarse sugar, such as demerara, on the crust. Serve with marscapone whipped by hand with a little sugar and either vanilla, port, or sherry, to taste. Should there be any left over, the tart makes a wonderful breakfast pastry.

I made this with Empire and Honeycrisp apples and it turned out well. Next time I will build up the crust edges a bit because some of the juice overflowed the galette but otherwise this was simple and the results were much better than I had hoped.

I made this with Gala apples, so I added the juice of half a Meyer lemon for tartness, and I used a low-sugar apricot spread rather than the sweeter preserves. I used a lightly sweetened crust that has cornmeal in it (happened to have the dough on hand in the fridge), and I piled the apple slices onto the crust and pulled the irregular edges farther over the fruit than the recipe instructs -- for an attractively rustic look. To keep the apples from drying out, since they were not arranged flat, I brushed them with some maple syrup mixed with melted butter at the point when the oven temperature was turned down. Delicious!

Easy and quick to make. Tasted great. Turbinado sugar sprinkled on the crust looks nice. Definitely make the crust from scratch since it will taste better than store bought crusts.

I used peach preserves instead of apricot, which tasted fine. Everyone loved the crust but next time I think I'll try adding a tiny bit of powdered sugar to add to the flavor. It was a delicious European-style apple pie.

Rating: 4
Loved this. Took it to a potluck, and everyone there loved it too. I still curled the edges over, but made mine in a springform pan so that I could transport it that way. The crust is really good, worth making. The apricot jam with the apples was really nice, will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe last night for a dinner party. My husband wanted me to make apple pie but I thought this would be an elegant addition for our guests. I didn't make the crust, I used pillsbury refrigerated crust and no one could tell I didn't make it. I rolled it to the required 1/8" but it didn't make it to 14" round. Not a problem. I got carried away with the lemon zest. I zested the whole lemon and it was a bit too much. Gave it a slightly "floral" note I didn't care for. I also only had apricot/raspberry jam so I used that. I would definitely make this again with the same crust and the right amount of lemon zest. It was a hit and it looked like I bought it from a high end bakery with VERY little effort. Might try to add almond paste next time if I can figure out how to incorporate it. Yum!

For the level of effort (low), this is very rewarding: tasty, simple, and extremely pretty.

Delicious also with a layer of marzipan or almond paste at the bottom of the crust. Yum.

This was my first go at a pie-type crust and I don't think I got it quite moist enough even with 3T water. But it still turned out tasty. Just crumbly. I also sliced the apples too thin on my mandolin and they got mushy in cooking. Will hand slice next time. Definitely good despite my inexperience.

Easy, beautiful, delicious! The only change I made was to add cinnamon to the sugar, and increased the lemon some.

I loved this. I made it as directed except I followed a previous review and used raw sugar on top and it looked and tasted great. The crust is so easy, I wouldn't skip it.

I have made this galette numerous times - except - I use Pillsbury Refrigerated Pie Dough rolled out to the required 14" on a Silpat (much sturdier than parchment.) I refrigerate the crust for 15 minutes, place the apples etc on it and then use my hands to form the crust. It always comes out perfectly. I have used Sugar in the Raw (Hawaiian turbinado sugar) on the crust for extra sparkle.

Absolutely scrumptious, especially the crust! I used vanilla sugar to sprinkle over the crust and the apples before baking. Elegant and delicious!

Rating: 4
Fabulous and looks so impressive. I mixed 1/4 cup ground almonds and 1/4 sugar adn sprinkled them on the crust (leavign a 1 1/2 inch border) before I added the apples. Then I added some slivered almonds 15 minutes before the end of the baking time. Superb! Also excellent with fresh peaches (leave the skin on).

Absolutely delicious! The whole family loved it.

PERFECT. This recipe is the cooking I love - simple yet sophisticated. The crust is divine - light, crispy, and buttery. DON"T SKIP THE CRUST - it's much less time consuming than slicing the apples (even with a mandoline).

Brought this to an Italian-themed dinner party and got so many compliments. I infused it with rosemary by putting the preserves into a saucepan over low heat, and crushing fresh rosemary sprigs into it. I let it simmer about five minutes, then picked the rosemary bits out. It was a subtle, savory twist that people pleasantly noticed.

Terrific. Followed the recipe except added cinnamon. Easy to make a wow dessert.

This is such and easy dessert to make and the taste is wonderful. Add a small dollop of whipped cream, or vanilla ice-cream for a nice not too sweet after dinner dessert. The crust is very good on this too!!

My family loved this... dessert in the evening and it was gone by breakfast the next morning. Simple and devine pastry! The Granny Smith apples with the touch of sugar & lemon were really tasty. Next time I might try a touch of bourbon and walnuts mixed in with the apples, I make a pie like this and it's wonderful.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I used the apples I had on hand, which were not Granny Smith, but I can only imagine the recipe would be even better with the more tart fruit.

What an easy crust... Add more lemon peel!!

So easy and incredibly delicious. Don't skimp on quality for the ingredients get the very best to really make this tart shine. I used a mix of Winesap and Honeycrisp apples straight from the farmer's market, and Bonne Maman Apricot jam. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was so easy! I did cheat a little with an already made crust. I will make this next time with a fresh crust. The apricot was out of this world. I used Staymen, Granny and Fuji - 3 big apples... and the taste was out of this world! The sugar with milk was devine!!! I did pre cook my apples, I like them soft and cooked well. I added freshly grated nutmeg and apple pie spice with a dash more cinnamon. The lemon zest was wonderful! I used the zest of one lemon!! WOW - this was one of the best apple pie's I've ever had. I love the tart and sweet. Makes me want another piece! Thank you!!

Wonderful and easy recipe. The flaky crust in combination with sweet apple topping tastes scrumptious. Highly recommend.

I've made this twice...first with homemade crust, which was excellent. Like a cross between apple pie and pizza. The second time I used puff pastry, which is ok in a pinch, but you have to adjust cooking time (shorter) so make sure the apple slices are super thin.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous and could not be easier - especially if you cheat like I did and use frozen pie dough! I was initially worried because the apples began to look too dark after only 15 minutes, but once it was cool, it looked beautiful and was not burned at all. The apricot preserves are the secret, I think, as they really add a level of complexity to what is an otherwise very simple dessert. This got rave reviews from my French friends,so it must be good!

SO EASY and SO TASTY. i will make this again and again.

This turned out wonderful. I ended up using peach jam on the bottom, and sprinkled finely chopped walnuts on top. I added a bit extra lemon peel as well because it smelled so good. I could eat the apple/lemon combo by itself. Also, I can't do dairy, so I used margarine instead of butter, and margarine instead of milk on the crust - still turned out great!!!

Rating: 4
Turned out great and easy to do. Want to speed it up? Use store pie crust. Didn't have lemon so I used orange. Had some apricot preserves but wanted a bit more so I added some orange marmalade to the apricot preserves. Piled some reconsituted dried cranberries in the middle. Got rave reviews.

This is very easy and you can use short cuts. All the chilling of dough is not necessary and neither is rolling out the dough. Just push it out to a regular thickness on cookie sheet. If edges get too cooked cover with foil. I've made it several times, it's awesome.

I have made this several times. It's easier than the recipe lets on. No need to chill the dough and no need to roll it out. Just press it out onto a pizza pan or similar to a relatively even thickness. Don't bother chilling after this either. Watch the temperature in the oven to make sure it doesn't burn. Can always place foil over edges if they get too brown. Super easy & super delicious.

I'm a terrible baker, but this came out great even for me! (I will say that I used prepared pie crust, shame on me.) I used gala apples instead and it was still great. We had it at Thanksgiving dinner with ice cream and it was a hit.

this was very tasty and looked lovely, although next time i think i will add a bit of sugar to the crust, which, although very flaky, did not have much taste.

I thought it was absolutely delicious and beautiful - my food processor broke so I had to do the crust by hand and it still turned out great. I too added the cinnamon to the topping and baked it a little longer than recommended ( I tend to like my apples a little softer) I would make it the same exact way the next time!

Rating: 3
Good Recipe, I would definitely add cinnamon powder or mixed spices and 1/4 stick less butter.Vanilla Icecream is an excellent accompaniment. Be careful with the temperature and the baking time, my apples started to burn. If you live in a warm climate, I suggest you drop the temperature to 350, and cut about 15 minutes off the baking time.

I decided to make this because of the limited number of ingredients, and because I thought it would be better than the average apple pie. Was good of course, but not extremely wow. Also thought amount of apples was excessive (had to pile them on because they didn't fit in a single layer).

Rating: 4
This was divine! The crust was so flaky and delicious. I modified the filling a little--mine had raisins and rum added. I think this would work with a variety of fillings. My dinner guests raved about it and had seconds (!), which is very unusual for a dessert after a big dinner.

This was really good! I made a half recipe, didn't have a baking pan large enough for the full recipe. It made 6 good sized slices. Crust was easy and good, the apricot preserves gave it a nice tang. Mine didn't come out exactly round, looked very rustic but still lovely. I used cinnamon sugar for the top and would do that again. The apples came out a bit dry, might have been the variety. Next time I'll cut them a bit thicker, maybe 1/4" thick. I could see doing this recipe with other preserves and fruit, like blackberry jam with peaches. Definitely a keeper!
