Just finished a batch of these! I doubled the recipe for Christmas Eve. I added some parsley to the herb mix. These are delicious and GORGEOUS! Top notch!

This recipe was good as a healthy ish option. It of course did not go as quick at my party compared to the deep fried options but one of the better veggie apis I have tried.

These were easy to prepare and made an elegant presentation. The recipe is highly adaptable; I might play with the herb combination next time to get a flavor that is more suited to my preferences.

very good and fresh tasting. use a cookie press to make a shape out of the cheese mix to make a more festive look.

Dumb it down or soup it up....simple, easy and yummy. Did both the cream cheese and chevre... both were wonderful!

It's the end of the summer and my garden is overflowing with cucumbers, mint and chives, so this is the perfect recipe to start from. I cut one bunch each of mint and chives to 8 oz of cream cheese, leave the lemon the same, and the cayenne the same. I call them "Wind Sandwiches", after Raggedy Ann, and they are hugely popular with my family. Thank you!

These were just OK - They are healthy & light (why I made them), and although I like all the ingredients, it just wasn't a home run for me. My husband (who eats everything) - had 1 and politely refused any more.

These are always a hit, both on warm summer days or at Christmas when the colors are appropriate.

These were a great hit at my last wine & cheese party. They were very pretty and light. Will definitely make these again.

These little edible pieces of art were delicious, refreshingly light and so easy to prepare! I will use a chevre next time as suggested by previous reviewers. Definitely a keeper.

These were delicious little appetizers perfect for a day after Christmas party! Light and delicious a much needed reprieve from heavy holiday fare. The tangy cream cheese mixture, spicy radish and refreshing cucumber and mint were absolutely perfect together. I will definitely make these again especially in the summer. I may sub chevre for the cream cheese next time.

Served these at a party on the 26th of December. They were light and delicious expecially after 3 days of heavy holiday eating. The flavorful cream cheese mixture, spicy radish and fresh cucumber were perfect together. May use chevre in place of cream cheese next time I make these.

This was just ok. I might try it again in the summertime when herbs were plentiful and the occasion called for something light and simple. It was pretty, but it wasn't a WOW by any means.

I thought this dish was fine but my guests absolutely loved it - it disappeared really quickly - eaten by women with fairly discriminating tastes (or so they like to think). I halved the mint for the cream cheese mixture and put on a very tiny little piece for garnish.

Simple, Very pretty, Very tasty, Very easy to prepare. And I don't particularly like radishes. So this was a surprise.

Absolutely gorgeous, and delicious. My vegetarian friends had to shove the carnivores aside to get at them.

Beautiful presentation, delicious recipe. And, it was so easy! I used a regular cucumber instead of a seedless one. I will surely make this recipe over and over again.

These looked GORGEOUS!!! They were tasty too, but I just can't believe how beautiful they looked. I had them arranged on a silver plater that reflected the colors intensifying the look. I only got to taste one because they were all gone by the time I got back to them.

Mmmm... the cream cheese is so good. A perfect refreshing summer snack. Such a gorgeous presentation too. Everybody absolutely LOVED these.

This was a wonderful appetizer that tasted like summer - cool and fresh. For the most part, it's a very simple finger food, but it does take a few minutes to put together - slicing the cucumber and radish, layering them and then dropping small dollops of the cream cheese. I added extra lemon and I wouldn't recommend leaving out any mint.

I also left out the mint. This was a wonderful recipe and one that I will add to my bag of tricks. It was fun to prepare and even better to eat. I served it as an appetizer and my guests loved it.

We have made this twice and have been asked for the recipe every time. It has been the hit. For a summer recipe it is wonderful!

Easy and great - ingredients you usually have on hand. Used this recipe for a cooking demonstration at Career Week for kids school. Had to find something that was no-bake so in a rush, came across this and thought it would be great because of all the different tools I could show them (mandoline, jester, knife, etc.) - didn't think they would find it very appetizing though. They gobbled it up and asked for seconds. Used regular cucumbers, and omitted mint because I didn't have any on hand. It was tasty and a great light, refreshing snack for the hot summer ahead. Actually liked the falvor so much, would make again and leave out mint.
