Made exactly as listed, except that I used 9 ramekins rather than 6. This was delicious but for non-coffee-drinkers, too overwhelmingly coffee-flavored. I love coffee-bean-based ice cream so thought this would be great, but it was just too coffee-flavored for me. I'm sure those who drink coffee would love this though as every other aspect was excellent -- nice crust on top, wonderful texture, so rich and flavorful. I will make again but cut down the coffee crystals to 1.5tsp at most.

Fabulous, easy recipe. Making this for years. I halve the recipe and use 3/4 cup ramekins. Baking time remains same; fabulous rich, moist texture. Wouldn't change a thing with this one!

Wonderful! Have made several times and always a hit. Freezes well -- just wrap in foil, thaw in refrig overnight and warm slightly in microwave. Out of rum once and just omitted it -- still fantastic!!

Easy and fast to make. Rich but worth the calories, a hit. I have made this again but used 6 oz ramekins, which was a better serving size.

Very good, very rich. We loved the consistancy. I used dark chocolate insead of semisweet, and I also used Kahlua instead of rum. I halfed the recipe and put the mix in custard cups, it was still so rich we could not eat it all. Rich is good in small quantities--next time ill try mini cakes in the pans with the removable bottoms ( like for cheesecakes) I think that would work great.

This very rich dessert is pretty good - I halved the quantity and baked it in ramekins and that made 5 servings so this recipe makes a lot. I baked it for about the same length of time - they rose like souffle. I also cut back on the butter to a half cup (on a halved recipe).

Quick and easy for a choc fix... only thing I'd change is to cut down the sugar as this is immensely sweet.

This was an incredible recipe. It was so easy. I left out the rum and used French Vanilla instant coffee. This is a definite for my next dinner party.

I made this last night and everyone loved it. However, I was a little disapointed with the texture. I thought it was too gooey/egg-tasting for my taste. I was looking more for something that was a little harder on the outside and soft on the inside. Served it with mango coulis.

I didn't like this recipe at all; I followed the directions exactly. It tasted ok but took twice as long to cook at directed. I expected a cake-like texture with a soft center but it was all a hard-pudding texture.

This is my favorite dessert. Wonderful flavor and interesting textures with the gooey centers. To cut the carbs I substitute Splenda for the sugar and it is still awesome. I've served it to non-dieting guests many times and they can't tell the difference.

My husband raved; I didn't mean to eat the whole thing, but I did; and my seven year-old daughter, who hates EVERYTHING, proclaimed for the first time ever, "This is GOOD!" Also, it was so simple to prepare and really added up to more than a sum of its simple ingredients. I can't wait to make it again!

YUMMY! very sweet, so you cant eat alot of it, I used whip cream on them right out of oven, didnt have dark rum so I used regular rum, was very easy to make too,

Made this for 18 people at a wine tasting. Almost everyone raved. We tasted it with ruby port and sweet sherry. I made it in foil cupcake tins to keep the portions small. I think it could be made in regular muffin tins and then inverted on a platter. (I can hardly wait to present it with raspberries.)

Wow, this was realy rich, could only finish less than half of the portion. I didn't know if this came out correctly b/c mine fell in the middle after I took them out ofthe oven. I baked them according to directions and took them out when they were still glossy in the middle. It didn't resent as well b/c they looked as if they had been prepared incorrectly. Did anyone else have this problem? Other than that, very good!

This was so easy to make and absoulutely delicious! One of my guests said it was one of the best desserts she ever had. I served it with a raspberry sauce & creme anglais,which were both tougher and took longer than this!

This was utterly divine. I cut the recipe in half (which was very easy to do), left out the rum as I didn't have any, and it made enough for 6 due to the richness. I didn't have any ramekins or time to get them, so I used mini loaf pans which worked fine.

This is a wonderful chocolate experience. Next time I would make each serving about 1/2 the recommended size and unmold the custard cups onto a larger serving plate. It also begs for some raspberry sauce alongside. My guests were enthralled.
