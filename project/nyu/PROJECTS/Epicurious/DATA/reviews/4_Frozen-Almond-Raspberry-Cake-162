it was easy to make and was a hit at a dinner party i went to and since it is summer it hit the spot for a light delicious dessert in the cool of the evening by a pool . i sprinkled some berries on top and crumbled almonds too.

This was really easy and a great finish to a rich meal. I garnished it with toasted almonds and powdered sugar in addition to the berries.
