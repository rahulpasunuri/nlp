Yes it really is this easy. I've made it with duck fat, goose fat, olive oil, and mixed duck fat/olive oil-whatever is handy. You can freeze the fat and re- use as long as it still smells/tastes fresh (it gets really tasty, actually). Season per the recipe instructions, or do your own thing--it's all good!

I made 7 legs (they were marked down, so I only paid about $1 each!) I took other reviewers' advice and rinsed off the salt and dried the legs. Also, it took closer to 4 hours for the cooking. They were delicious! Made 2 meals with them - the first one I sauteed the legs to crisp up the skin and served with Tuscan white beans (with pancetta, tomatoes & thyme) and the second was the pasta with confit duck and savoy cabbage from this website.

Made a batch of 6 legs. really wonderful. I rinsed rather than just brush off the salt.

How many servings does this make? I assume 4... one leg and one wing per person... is that right? It looks fabulous, and I can't wait to try it out!

what do you do once it has been stored in refrigerator and your ready to serve it? how long to you re-cook for etc.

a GREAT place to buy the duck fat is "Central Market" (I live in Dallas, they are all over Texas) $4 per pound! I got that yesterday, awesome deal...

To a cook from NYC you could cook it your slow cooker but don't cover it. You want the moisture to escape the dish so as to leave your fat clear and pure for your next run. Also the oven might be a more controlled heat unless your slow cooker has more options than high, medium, and low. The slower the better.

I didn't rate the recipe since I have not made it yet. Question: Since this cooks at such a low temperature and for a few hours, does anyone know if you can make it in a slow cooker? I would imagine so, but am wondering if it needs to not be covered as it woudl be with the lid of the slow-cooker. Thanks!

I want to make this but I can't find duck fat. Can anybody tell me where you found it? Has anyone substituted canola oil for the duck fat? HELP!

Ummm Rooftop Gardener you missed the following part of the recipe: "Brush the salt and seasonings off the duck." Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Duck-Confit-102313#ixzz18CVh8xmx

Fabulous recipe, but CRAZY SALTY. Made it the 2nd time with 1/2 the salt: still way too much. I'm using French Grey sea salt, perhaps it's my salt? Will try the netx time with even less & see how that goes. Otherwise, a great recipe.

Yes to this recipe and purchasing the ducks ( i did 2 at the same time which meant no need to buy the fat) at your local Asian market though it might not be for the squeamish...my ducks were "anatomically correct";).Oh and the head and webbed feet add lots o extra taste to the stock. That being said the price difference and freshness of birds made it all worthwhile. I haven't confitted a chicken yet but am saving up my fat. Just a heads up...tomato confit (in olive oil) is yummy as well.

I signed up just to rate this. This confit is out of this world, and so simple to make.

Sometimes one has to be different. Am I the only one who has ever had chicken confit? Actually not bad. Follow the recipe and crisp it up. No, it's not Duck but not the everyday chicken taste.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the cracklins for rendering the fat was out of this world. Not for everyday dining but for a treat they are wonderful

Well this worked and the confit was good. I now know why this is so expensive. It took $60 worth of duck (3 whole) to get about a pound of confit. (the breasts were saved and the rest made a pretty good duck stock)

This was very tasty- I let it sit for 2 days and after baking it in the fat in the oven, I pan seared the drumsticks and wings so that the skin would be crispy. I would wholeheartedly recommend this recipe to anyone- it is quite easy.

My first duck confit! I made it with only two legs, and let them sit for the full 2 days. It was delicious!

Rating: 4
Doesn't get better than this. I always rinse off the salt and pat dry before adding fat as I reuse the fat for future confit and do not want it overly salted. I also 'confit' the entire bird, cut-up of course. Don't forget to make cracklings - a great once in awhile treat!

Great recipe, and simple. I was hesitant at first to make it, as I didn't have 1-2 days to season the duck, but a few hours in the salt and herbs (I also added thyme, and thyme in the cooking process) were just fine. The legs came out perfectly tender and delicious. We served this with a celery root soup, and topped the soup with cracklings from rendering the duck fat. NOTE: to render duck fat, roughly chop the skin and all pieces of fat, and put into a saucepan over low flame. As the fat liquifies, pour it off through a sieve into a heat-safe container.

I did not rate this recipe because I didn't really follow it, but a note: This recipe says to "brush" off the salt. This is fine if you use the lesser amount of salt called for here, however if you use a more typical recipe where you submerge the duck pieces in salt and flavorings, be sure to *rinse* off the salt and then dry before cooking, otherwise you will end up with delicious but extremely salty meat (as I did).

This recipe for confit is vastly superior to a few others I've tried, which invariably have involved way too much salt--making the duck too tough and salty to eat in anything besides stews and cassoulet! This one is perfect and allows for use in salads and other dishes where the confit isn't being "recooked".

Rating: 3
Good recipe for a salad involving the confit: Mesclun (preferably on the bitter side--add some arugula), (cold) blanched green beans, (cold) cooked French lentils (cook in salted chicken stock, perhaps with some onion bay leaf, and thyme, until just tender then cool), dried cherries in a sherry-shallot vinaigrette topped with warm shredded duck confit (about 1/2 leg per salad).

I love duck confit and had always purchased it from my butcher at $8.00 (Canadian) per leg. Delicious, but pricey. I recommend going to Chinatown and getting the duck (or legs) from a Chinese butcher--they always seem fresher and the price is dramatically less than the butcher--I pay $3.79 (Canadian) a pound at the New 168 Market here in Ottawa; that comes to about $2.00 per leg. Sweet!

This was the easiest thing to do!! I was scared to try it, who knows why, but I did--and how EASY. I used a whole duck and put it in the crock pot for 14 hrs. And can I say YUMMY!!!

Fabulous. Next time I'll confit the whole duck. Meat is so tender and easy to use warm or cold anytime.

I just bought a duck, cut off the breasts and legs, and made a big pile out of the raw fat. Anyone know how to render it?

I have prepared duck confit in French restaurants, and I have to say this recipe is bang-on, culinary academy perfect. My suggestions to add to this recipe are to use kosher or other coarse salt (it's easier to brush off the excess), and you can play with the spices. Try adding rosemary or allspice for something quite different!

This recipe is so practical--the duck is waiting for you when you need a couple legs for a duck confit salad, or just crisped for an instant main course. So delicious. I cut-up a whole duck and used legs and breasts. I rendered the fat from the carcass and did NOT add any other duck fat. This was fine. I also saved the fat and have used it for braised potatoes, and for caramelizing onions for any recipe. People are always a little surprised, like "wow--why is this so good?" when you use the fat.

Flying in the face of my cardinal rule of not commenting on a recipe until I have tried it, I just have to give kudos to the cooks who have inspired me to try my hand at duck confit in my own kitchen. I've only ever had this in restaurants and had always wondered about how it is made. Having read the various uses home chefs have for every last morsel of the ducks and the inspired ideas (IMHO) for extra duck fat, I am preparing to give it my own stab. Just as soon as we are back from vacation, my kitchen will be turned over to the temple of duck! Any thoughts or suggestions in the meantime are always appreciated.

Wow - so easy and so delicious. This is the best duck I've ever had. I only had one duck, so I cut the recipe in half and was able to get about 1.5 cups of fat from the breast and scraps. I didn't have enough to completely cover the legs, but it still turned out wonderful. As for the breast, I followed Julia Child's recipe for the breast in duck sauce from the cookbook Cooking with Jacques and Julia. To make the sauce you make duck stock and reduce the stock to 1 1/2 cups, add some port, season with salt and pepper and thicken. When making the stock brown the bones and neck, add onions and carrots and brown, deglaze the pan with 2 cups of water, transfer to a stock pot and add 4 cups of water or so, a garlic clove and boquet garni. After the stock is done, press some of the remaining vegetables through a sieve to get the juices and some puree.

This recipe, with one or two minor alterations, has become my standard for duck confit. First off, I switch the thyme out in favour of herbes de provence. Secondly, I occasionally omit the pepper depending on my mood. Like most other people I roast the carcass and trimmings for the fat and save the breasts for oven roasting or whatever else my devious little mind can dream up. When all is said and done, I add the strained fat to my ever-growing collection, which I keep in the freezer. My new favorite thing to use the fat for is popcorn. If you like to make popcorn the old way in a big heavy pot (or even if you usually get nuke-corn), try popping the corn in duck fat seasoned with kosher salt instead of oil. The taste is subtle, but OH SO devine, especially for an extra special intimate evening.

I buy two whole ducks, and get three (plus) delicious meals out them. The first day I butcher the ducks and roast the carcasses of the ducks to get the fat for the confit while I salt the legs for confit. I make pate out of the liver and we have a light meal of pate and cheese. The next day I make stock with the roasted carcasses (to store in freezer)and I make Breast of Duck with Port Wine Sauce (recipe on this site) and fianlly I make the confit. There are countless ways to use the confit: pasta, risotto, grilled pizza, rillette and let me tell ya - that duck fat is a prize! It keeps in the freezer for 6 months and makes the best potatoes you'll ever have. Enjoy!

Delicious! We confit the entire duck, breasts too, and substitute herbs de Provence for the thyme. Two days in the fridge before cooking produced a salty dish; one day made for a robust confit with leftover duck fat that can be used in place of pork fat in other recipes if one is so inclined. We served with sliced potatoes fried in duck fat and sauteed onions (brasserie style) and plenty of full bodied red wine. Guests loved it.

Very easy to prepare. One question, why not include the duck breasts in the confit? It comes out deliciously tender. P.S. For the non-purists, lard can be used instead of duck fat. It is readily available especially at Hispanic stores.

Rating: 3
This was not as hard as I expected. I used two largeish ducks from an asian grocery store and used the breasts in a separate recipe. For the record, even without the legs, breasts and wings, the skin from the body and neck of the two ducks still rendered almost all the fat needed for the recipe. I also collected the scraps of meat left on the ducks after removing the rest, and cooked it in the juices that accumulated from the first part of this recipe. Those scraps were as good as the confit and duck breast recipes that used. I'm still working on a garlic/shallot/thyme roasted duck recipe that will work on larger pieces.

Days of work and many ducks roasted for their fat - well worth the effort if you don;t have a fancy french restaurant in your area.
