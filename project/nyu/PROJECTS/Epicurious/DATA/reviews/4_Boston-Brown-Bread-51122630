I've been trying to find an authentic-tasting brownbread recipe for a long time, and this is it. This tasted just like the real thing--the fresh brown bread that my mother used to get at the Hampton, NH Depot bakery on Saturdays for the traditional New England Saturday supper of hot dogs, baked beans and freshly steamed brown bread. I used buttermilk instead of milk. I also used my crock pot on high and put the Bread & Cake pan for the crockpot into it with 3" of water in the bottom of the crock pot. It worked great. I think coffee cans could be used in a crock pot too, but I just didn't have any. The crock pot worked great. Yummy recipe!

This recipe was so much fun to make! The preparation was easy except for the coffee can preparation. I used baker's joy instead of butter to grease the cans which simplified the process. Just be careful of what kind of can you choose. One of the cans had a lip on it so I had to use pliers to make it a smooth surface. I was so curious about this bread and it was delicious. You could taste the many different grains and the raisins added the best yummy taste. This is a great bread for the Thanksgiving season to remind us of our roots!
