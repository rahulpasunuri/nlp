Just made this for dinner today. Watch out for the lid on the blender! I found this soup tasted like chicken soup with crab. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the fennel and was disappointed. On the positive side, my kids loved it (probably the chicken soup similarity). Maybe with a vegetable broth it would have been better?

I made the soup without the shrimp shells or the celery root. It was still delicious. I'm sure that the the addition of these two items would be wonderful, but it it good to know that it is still a tasty soup without them.

Great technique, in using the shrimp shells early, then grinding them. Not sure why the recipe didn't call for fish stock. I used homemade chicken stock, as specified. Tastes were complex and satisfying. But texture was far too thin. Second day I blended the potato/celery root cubes to thicken texture and it was improved.

This is labor intensive but worth it! I followed the fundamental directions to the letter (I think thats a good practice, at least the first time making a new recipe) and the result was a VERY complex, sophisticated, delicious and beautiful soup. I am fortunate enough to have some saffron from the Navelli plain near LAquila located in the Abruzzi region of Italy and was able to use that. I am told that this is one of the best saffrons in the world. So, I do not know how this might taste with another kind of saffron, but I imagine it would still be delicious. I do know that the entire profile of flavors changed dramatically once I introduced this rare and wonderful saffron to the broth. This is not an inexpensive recipe by any means, but I think using the shrimp meat instead of the crab or cutting way back on the crab meat would be more than acceptable and not detract in any way from the complex flavors or presentation. Actually, I ended up not using all the crab meat. I served this as a first course to 5 guests at a four course luncheon as and felt that using ALL the crab meat would have taken away from the visual Impact of the presentation as well as the complexity of flavors. I will definitely make this again. This is really impressive company fare!

This is a very nice soup. It's rather rich- served this in a multiple course meal. Everyone was raving about how much they enjoyed this soup and all went home with the recipe. I was a rather skeptical about cooking with shrimp shells. I know this isn't that uncommon but it just isn't my thing, so I used the actual shrimp meat in its place and it turned out wonderfully. I also couldn't find the saffron ANYWHERE so I couldn't use it; however the soup still turned out great. I will certainly add this to the usual dinner party menu!

This was unique and tasty. Would have been nice in small portions with other courses. Rich.

We had Italian guests last night and this soup was well worth the time. Each guest raved about the complexity and elegance of the Venetian crab soup. Next time I will grate the potato and celery root to quickly finish the soup.This is a keeper!
