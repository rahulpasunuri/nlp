Love this rice with skewered chicken and peanut sauce. It was a hit with everyone. I used the blender instead of a garlic press or microplane to extract the ginger juice and pulp. Much easier.

Light and tasty. Even my husband, who's somewhat "meh" on ginger, liked it. That being said, I thought there was a hair too much salt.

The most heavenly rice!! Light, clean fragrant taste. It's going to be hard to ever make a different rice recipe.

Tasted this as soon as it was finished cooking and I, like another reviewer, found myself eating it straight out of the pot! So simple but SO GOOD.

Delicious and so easy! I have made this several times and it is my go-to rice recipe. Adding a half cup of coconut milk = heaven.

Made this according to the recipe and served it with curried lamb. The aroma and flavours were wonderful. Will definitely make it again.

Made this last night for a party and it was the standout dish. I didn't have butter on hand. Substituted coconut oil and it was divine. Will try it with butter next time just to see if it is better that way, but hard to imagine that it will be. Yum!

Any dish that gets a double thumbs up from everyone in the family - including my picky 7 y.o. - is definitely a keeper. The ginger adds a really interesting dimension and smells great too. I took the advice of another poster and used a microplane to save time and it came out beautifully. I usually use a rice cooker but this method came out nice and fluffy. Definitely give this a try.

I made this for my family of four the other night. I had to use basmati rice because I was out of Jasmine. It turned out great. There was barely enough for everyone however. I'll 1 1/2 the recipe next time.

You really can't tell it's ginger giving it the flavor. I used 1/2 brown sweet rice, and 1/2 brown basmati rice. It turned out like a risotto. Great texture and flavor!

Tried this last night. Simple and easy. Really very good, nice to have a different twist for rice.

The best rice i have ever made.... I would eat this breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I cut the butter down to 1/2 a tablespoon and its perfect.

So easy and so yummy! It takes rice to an entirely new level. Make it along w/ the 5 spice chicken recipe (from this site) and stir-fried snow peas. Be sure to make extra -- you'll appreciate the leftovers!

This was really unusual. The whole house smelled absolutely intoxicating while the ginger and rice were cooking. Even before tasting it, I was content to just go around sniffing the air... The funny thing, though, is that you can't really pick out the ginger as being the elusive flavor -- your tastebuds just know that there's something unusually and unexpectedly nice going on, and that they want more of it...Although it's naughty according to the food pyramid, I could eat this by itself for a dinner curled up on the couch while watching bad movies...

I added a little lemon zest, otherwise made as written. It was so good! Served with the snow peas and 5 spice chicken from the same menu. Will definitely be making the entire menu again soon.

I've never rinsed rice before. My, what a difference it makes! This was perfectly cooked with a nice ginger flavor. (The technique for mincing the ginger seemed more trouble than it was worth; I just grated mine on a microplane.)

Outstanding and worked with basmati- and reheated nicely the next day. Served with Allegra McEvedy's recipe for Flash-fried sesame cabbage with chilli-pickled carrots (see http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/28/g2-weekly-recipe-allegra-mcevedy). Not a bit stuck to the pan and since I normally only use my rice cooker so I don't risk burning or sticking rice on the stove top method, this was a bonus to have a perfect pan of rice on top of the stove. I probably doubled the ginger ;-)

Very fragrant and not over flavored. Added just a few dried currants and served this with a curry-and-lime chicken, the recipe for which I also found at this website. Tasty and easy and the water to rice ratio makes this rice come out nice and fluffy.

I don't usually have much luck with rice, texture or flavor wise, but this rice was exceptional! I made it exactly as written. I ate half the rice before it even hit the table. The smell was wonderful and the grains of rice were cooked perfectly.
