I should also mention that veggie broth can easily be substituted for chicken broth, for any other pescatarians out there. :-)

This was SO GOOD! Like another reviewer, I used Trader Joe's smoked trout (four cans) and redskin potatoes instead of russetts. Because I don't eat bacon, I cooked the onions in a little bit of butter plus the smoky-flavored oil from two of the trout cans. I upped the amounts of parsley, Worcestershire sauce and celery a bit, to suit our own personal tastes. I did not add Lima beans, because I did not have any on hand, but will do so next time (this was a last minute dinner). Topped with shredded Parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. I used 1% milk and it was still plenty rich (I am sure that the butter I added earlier helped!).

My husband loves this recipe. He often requests it when I am going to do a grocery shop. We get smoked trout from Trader Joes. I will often use more chicken broth less water and red potatoes.

I recently worked at a trout processing facility. As a result, I was able to get some of the best smoked trout from work. Out of curiosity, I went looking for recipes that called for smoked trout. I came across this chowder and knew it was a keeper!!

This has become standard in our house. I freeze the leftover Limas from our summer farmer's market to make this every winter(It is way to hot for summer soups here.). And Lima bean haters --try fresh limas before you write the Vegetable off! It is a whole different experience.

Very good. I used whole milk, so the soup came out watery vs creamy. Since I'm trying to skimp on the cream, I'll use all chkn broth next time to increase flavor. Also, I substituted Old Bay Seasoning for Worcheshire and fresh carrots for lima beans.

I've made this several times adding and subtracting ingredients and it was always delicious

I made this, but substituted carrots for lima beans, and it was just wonderful! Full of flavor.

Sounds quite nice, but I would not use the lima beans and would use haddock for the fish and maybe carrots.
