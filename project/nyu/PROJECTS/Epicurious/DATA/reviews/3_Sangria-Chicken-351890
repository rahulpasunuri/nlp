This dish is phenomenal. Even our 5 year-old ate two leg/thigh pieces. The glaze does need to be simmered longer and works best if made beforehand, not while the chicken is cooking. Read my full review at: http://www.takingonmagazines.com/2011/03/sangria-chicken-from-gourmet-magazine.html

Maybe I'm not a good cook but I was expecting more of a glaze. The sauce reduced but it didn't really glaze the chicken so it didn't look all that appetizing. Just ok.

Horrible! Don't waste your time on this recipe. 40 minutes is too long to bake this recipe at 450 degrees. No flavor to the chicken at all. Worse of all, it was a waste of 2 cups of good wine!

Very tasty indeed, but even though the glaze was properly reduced, it didn't coat the chicken very well.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and reduced heat to 400 and decreased time by ~10 minutes; I served it with orzo tossed with olive oil and capers.....everyone like it
