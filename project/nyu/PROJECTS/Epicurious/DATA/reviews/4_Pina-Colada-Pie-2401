This was the most delicious pie ever!

This pie was good and easy. Definitely tasted pina colada-y. However, I think I personally prefer a dessert with more punch.

I made this last weekend - It was wonderful and refreshing, everyone loved it - it wasn't too rich like other frozen pies I have made. I made it with pareve vanilla ice cream so I was able to serve it with a meat meal.(Kosher)

Fabulous and different! Comes out perfect everytime. I've been making it since 1992. You can substitute mango or tropical sorbet if you can't find pineapple sorbet. I cut down the coconut milk mixture into the vanilla yogurt just a bit so it's not too overwhelming. Everyone loves this recipe and it's so refreshing! Making it ahead and freezing is great for busy people. Love the way it comes out of the foil for a pretty presentation on a dessert plate.

I made this 10 years ago when the recipe was first published. I had searched several times through my old issues of B.A. looking for it but couldn't find it. Glad it's here online. I couldn't find pineapple sorbet so I used pineapple sherbet and added about 1/4 cup fresh minced pineapple to it. The guests loved it!

This was heavenly. I made this for 6 people. It should feed 10 but they ate it all! I couldn't find pineapple sorbet so I used tropical sherbet instead. I also increased the rum from 4 teaspoons to 4 tablespoons (decreasing the cocoa lopez by the same amt.) Best of all - you can make it up to 2 weeks ahead!
