I've already done this. :( The orange flower water is something new to try, though! Some things this is good on: strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, all other berries that exist on the face of the earth, apples, on a spoon, on granola, chili, Indian cuisine, and anything else you can think of! Enjoy!

I couldn't find any "Greek yogurt" or any special orange flower water anywhere. Instead, I substituted the Greek yogurt with Yoplait vanilla yogurt and swirled in honey. All things considered, it tasted pretty good. I think the next time I try this recipe, I'm going to try some Yoplait orange creamsicle and swirl in the honey. Although, I prefer to just eat yogurt sans honey, It should be delicious!
