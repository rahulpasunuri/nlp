With a few adjustments, this has become a staple in my kitchen. We use it on smoked salmon and as a sandwich spread - great with ham too. The brand of honey mustard makes a big difference - use Maille for the best result. I adjust as follows: 3 T corn (or canola oil), 1/4 c Maille honey mustard, 1 T Dijon mustard, 1 T white wine vinegar, 1 T chopped fresh dill or 1/2 scant t dried dill (omit the sugar). This keeps very well in the refrigerator for weeks. We serve smoked salmon from Costco with this and wasabi cream cheese (also on this site) - both on th side.

Hi, Going back to smoked salmon with fresh dill, capers, and a wedge of lemon.

I don't know if my smoked salmon was too bland or this mustard-dill sauce was too overwhelming, but the balane was way off, in my opinion. I couldn't taste the salmon at all.

Delicious! Made this for neighborhood New Year's Day brunch (using 2 TBS oil and a few shakes of salt). Heard another another neighborhood urging his buddy to try the "terrific" Dill-Mustard Sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe! The sauce is very easy to make and tastes great with the smoked salmon and pumpernickel. Definitely reduce the amount of oil - it doesn't affect the taste but makes the consistency much better.

This is fantastic and so easy! I agree, a little oily, but otherwise its perfect!

I was apprehensive after my first taste, but my guests absolutely RAVED about this sauce. Definitely serve with the pumpernickel bread as suggested. My only change - it was a little oily, so I would cut back on the oil.

When I first made this recipe I mis-read it and added honey rather than honey mustard. The next time I did it correctly, but we liked my error better. I made it a third time to make sure and we were. It is much sweeter, but with the smokey flavor the blend is better.
