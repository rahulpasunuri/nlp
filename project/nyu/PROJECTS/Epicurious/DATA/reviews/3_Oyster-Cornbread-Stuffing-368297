This was the HIT of our Thanksgiving. I made it w/out sausage (only because I didn't have any) and it was fantastic. Sausage or bacon would have been a great addition though. I used fresh local Hope Ranch Oysters (which are ginormous) and I added some heat with red pepper flakes and Tabasco. I also added smoked salt, smoked paprika, and scallions. This is my new go-to for a dish that makes an impression.
