The cream puff recipe is a great basic recipe for any cream puff preparation. It does have a little bit of a meringue taste which I don't love but they puff well and look very pretty. I think the strawberry sauce is better if strained before adding the whole pieces. Otherwise, it's very seedy.

This was the first time I made cream puffs and they turned out excellent. The puffs baked very nicely and the overall presentation was very pretty. They also tasted very light and fresh. My mother, who doesn't eat sweets too often, really loved these and I occasionally get hints about making them again. =) The only thing to note would be to make sure you do not add too much of the liquid from the crushed strawberries into the cream, as it might turn out a little runny.

This is easily the most reliable cream puff recipe I've ever used. It puffs perfectly and the insides cook well enough that I don't have to mess with pulling out raw dough or drying it out in the oven. I've stuffed it with savory and sweet, and it's a snap to make--and looks "fancy"... :)

Excellent and easy recipe for the puffs. Cream and sauce are also terrific. We drizzled the tops with chocolate syrup.

I'm using this recipe just for the puffs. They were very easy to make. I was a bit concerned that the dough would be lumpy, but it smoothed out, fine after mixing it well. I made 12 larger puffs, not 18. This didn't effected the cooking time. They puffed up nicely and were a glossy golden color. Will fill with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Yum!

I haven't tasted it yet. But I have to write and say that the cream puffs didn't "puff". I am not sure what I did wrong. Does anyone have any ideas?

These were a lot easier to make than I ever thought! I used raspberries for the filling which was very good. I made the mistake of drizzling them with chocolate when finished and it overpowered the filling. Next time I'll stick to powdered sugar.

I've never actually used the strawberry filling with these puffs for a variety of reasons (no strawberries on hand, etc.) but LOVE the puffs, simple and easy. This last time I put the dough into a pastry bag and made inch wide, 1/2 high dolops that were the perfect bite sized dessert for a very chi chi event.

Made these puffs- quick, easy and yummy! For the filling, I used the cream with some frozen raspberries and a sprinkling of powdered sugar over the top. They were a very popular, beautiful and light addition to my party buffet! I will use again and try different fillings. A pudding-like filling would be great also. My mother makes a puff like this and fills with chicken salad. They are awesome!

I only made the cream puffs and filled them with fresh berries and fresh whipped cream. They were so easy and light I will definately make these again possibly to fill and decorate.

Made this for a dinner party since I have always loved to make cream puffs. The filling was nothing that special and I think I would have preferred it with ice cream rather than whipping cream. Sauce was just OK.

The cream puffs were great! I made a ton using different kinds of filling and every one of them disappeared within an hour of my bringing them out! I made them for a non-alcohol crowd so I left out the kirsch. The strawberry filling is much too sour, but adding a few more spoonfuls of powdered or even regular sugar will solve the problem just fine.

I have made better tasting "puffs", but I liked the "cream" in this recipe. I used raspberries instead of strawberries, and spread Nutella on the top. Thanks to everyone for the Nutella suggestion; that stuff is awesome!!! My family really liked these little cream puffs.

THANK YOU EPICURIOUS! I first learned to make cream puffs 2 years ago at a fancy local cooking school. Their approach was time-consuming, fussy, and required several pieces of special equipment. This recipe is essentially the same but EQUALLY DELICIOUS AND VASTLY SIMPLER!! I cranked these out in NO TIME FLAT the morning of a dinner party. They lasted all day, looked fancy, tasted fresh and had a nice light fluffy texture at serving time (my version: the berry sauce, vanilla ice cream and a bit of drizzled nutella) and even now, a day later, the few leftovers hold allure :)

These cream puffs were excellent. I did not use the strawberries as I made them ahead of time and froze them for a few days. What I did do was fill them with the cream, sprinkled conf. sugar over the cream, put the top on and sprinkled conf. sugar again. DELICIOUS!!!

Wonderful recipe! My family and friends loved it and are requesting for more! I skipped on the cherry syrup and the strawberry. Sprinkled powdered sugar and drizzled nutella on the tops of the cream puffs. Delicious!

I used non-dairy whip (Rich's) less fat and did not put strawberry in the cream puff. I think chocolate sauce would go better with the cream puff, but it was still very good.

Every one at work gobbled them up for afternoon tea. I omitted the strawberry sauce and the result was better finger food.

They came out heavenly. I did not put strawberries in the cream filling, simply because they tend to get watery, and make the whipped cream runny. I added extra sugar instead. I put the pasteries in the freezer 1/2 before I served them, this made them crispy and the filling like ice cream. They were the first dessert to go!!!
