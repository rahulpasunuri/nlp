This was a huge hit. As recommended by a reviewer, I added cardamom. Also added cloves and allspice. Substituted apricot jam for the marmalade; put it through the food processor for a nice consistency. Added lemon zest to the dried fruits and lemon juice to the apples and pears. I marinated the dried fruits for two days in a few T. of brandy. Yum! To make the gallette crust a bit more elegant, I used a fork to make impressions all around the outside.

This was delicious. I added 1/4 t. cardamom and 1/2 t. cinnamon because the ginger-only fruit mix seemed a little flat. Mine also began to brown early, with the tips of fruit on the top beginning to burn at 30 minutes. I covered with foil and dropped temp to 350 for another 40 minutes. My gallete leaked, and I wish I had used a shallow-rimmed sheet instead. Definitely fits well with Christmas-themed menus.

Wonderful flavor. Easy preparation. Began to brown early so may need to cover with foil well before recipe indicates.

Everyone loved this! I rolled the dough a bit imperfectly so that a very thin spot at the folded up area "leaked" alot of the fruit juices...which may or may not have caused this to bake in half the recommended time. Some of the fruit started to darken/burn within 30-40 minutes, so I covered the exposed center with a foil disk. I make several tarts/crostada/galletes that my friends love, but my dinner group of 8 declared this the best. I wouldn't change a thing except my dough rolling!!

The description gets it right. The dried fruit and spices give it some of the characteristic flavor of a mince pie or fruitcake, but the apples and pears lighten the flavor. The orange marmalade was a bit more intrusive than I would have liked, and I might cut this back the next time I make it, perhaps by omitting the glaze in the last step.
