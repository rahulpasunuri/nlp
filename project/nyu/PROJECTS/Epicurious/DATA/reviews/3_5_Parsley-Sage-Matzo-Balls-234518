I thought these were delicious. I did couple them with the Lemon-Scented Soup, but I thought that the soup itself wasn't great. These Matzo Balls were a lovely addition to my Passover dinner.

Just perfect! I added some dill with the other herbs and served it in the lemon scented chicken broth. These are fluffy and light and so easy. I used butter instead (gasp! I know..) but had great results. I will definitely make again!

A great recipe; but I use 4 tablespoons of schmaltz instead of margarine.

Very good. Cook matzo balls in chicken broth for more flavor.

Very yummy and we enjoyed the sage flavor immensely. Many compliments from our Passover guests and a nice and easy change from the usual out-of-the box variety.

I agree with the previos reviewer that this is a great variation of a classic. I might use dried sage the next time because the flavor was a little over-bearing ans masked some of the fresh flavor of the parsley.

The Matzo balls turned out exceptionally well. So much nicer than the "ready mix" versions that I usually make and only a little more effort required. I will certainly make again.
