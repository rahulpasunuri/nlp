My kids ate the veggies no problem this way. Would like to try the marinade with raw vegetables. And cut back on the amount of oil next time.

Was a hit with guests. Made it with white cauli, yellow cauli, purple cauli, baby cauli, and broccoli for a vibrant presentation.

We really enjoy this simple salad and have used this recipe and dressing as a base for many variations. Following the recipe as-is, the addition of crumbled feta really complements the vegetables.

This is the best marinade recipe I've found so far. My variation is to grill the veggies (squash, eggplant, green beans, etc), then marinade. This is the closest to what we've experiences in our Italy travels. Regarding the comment on too much oil, I'd advise to either upgrade your olive oil, or cut back.

This was very, very oily. Maybe with less oil it would taste better, but we ended up throwing it out.

By a lucky coincidence we had some leftover vegetables from a series of dinners, and wanted to clean out the fridge. This sounded good, so we tried it. We were out of the hot peppper sauce, so we used crushed red pepper flakes instead, but we were pleased with the result. We're going to try it with guests intentionally rather than as a use of leftovers! I thought olives might make a nice addition as well.
