I've made this recipe many times over the years, though after the first time I made it I started using wilted lettuce leaves instead of cabbage. Either green leaf or butter lettuce. It's the best of the "lettuce wrap" recipes I've tried.

I made this recipe to take to a cocktail party. It never made it; it tasted awful and my husband confirmed it. I dumped it down the kitchen sink. I had doubled the recipe, which I hear sometimes alters the taste; not sure whether that was a contributing factor or not.

I am not one to hang around the kitchen but I had an "Appetizer Party" to go to. I found this recipe and decided to try it. It was very easy except for wilting the cabbage- very time consuming. I also wrapped chives around the bundles for a nice effect. It turns out that not only was this appetizer the hit of the party but it won first prize! Everyone loved it and were begging for the recipe- pretty good for someone who doesn't like to cook! PS My husband who is a fabulous cook even enjoyed it!

This is a wonderful, light appetizer. Instead of wilting the cabbage and wrapping (which I just couldn't seem to do right) I served the filling in a bowl surrounded by butter lettuce leaves and let guests fill their own. It was a great hit!

This was very good. Except I didn't wilt the cabbage, but ate them raw. Liked it very much, except I think it needs a little extra sauce. I also served this with miso soup and rice with soy-glazed bonito flakes and sesame seeds.

Trying to beat the summer heat, I was looking for a light dish that still had some flare. I found what I was looking for. The spicey red jalepenos were offset by the acidity of the lime juice and cooled by the sweet hoisin. The fresh vegetables gave crunch, color and complemented the chicken. I also blanched green onions to tie the bundles for presentation. This recipe was easy, fast and incredibly delicious! For a light meal, I served coconut rice and a small bowl of white miso soup. A wonderful combination!
