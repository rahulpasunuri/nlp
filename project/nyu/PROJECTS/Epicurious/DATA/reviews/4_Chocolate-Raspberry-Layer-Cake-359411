I made this last year for my husband's birthday, & will be making it again this year. I made some modifications to lighten the calorie load, & thought the result was phenomenal. For the cake: 3 oz light olive oil & 3 oz applesauce instead of 3/4cup oil. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the cake batter. I used 1 cup of brewed coffee for the water. I used 1/4 tsp salt, & turbinado sugar. I omitted the raspberry jam & powdered sugar dusting. I used skim milk which sat with lemon juice (1/4 lemon, juiced) for 2 min instead of buttermilk For the ganache & raspberry topping: I used 8 oz unsweetened 100% cacao, 1 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp turbinado sugar, 1 cup heavy whipping cream, & I added 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 6oz container of raspberries, stuffed with bittersweet chocolate chips. I sprinkled chocolate chips on the top of the cake. As prepared above, the cake was amazing. It was moist, not too sweet, & possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Of course, the calorie is count is HUGE for this cake. I cut out some (668 cal) by using applesauce for half of the oil & reducing the frosting from 18oz chocolate to 8oz. I think that 8oz was still too much; maybe 6oz with 6oz cream would be perfect. You could cut more calories by using only egg whites, & using all applesauce for oil (that would reduce the calories count by another 833). Total calories as prepared: 6,783 cal 22 slices: 308 cal per slice Tip: If this isn't consumed quickly, keep an eye on the raspberries. Unless you treat them with a diluted vinegar rinse first (which I didn't), they may mold & ruin your cake!

This cake was exceptional. I served it for Thanksgiving along with several other desserts and every person at the table absolutely raved. If I may say so, it was perfect. I made a couple of changes, which I based on others' reviews. I used only coffee instead of water. I used strong coffee water made with two tablespoons of instant coffee to help bring out the chocolate flavor. I also cut down on the amount of ganache to 14 oz of bittersweet chocolate (Ghirardelli) and 1 3/4 cup of cream. It was still more ganache than needed!. I also used 9 oz of raspberry jam (6 oz was not even close to enough!) I didn't want the seeds and only Smuckers seedless raspberry was available, but it had a delicious sourness that was a perfect foil to the bitter chocolate. Do make the cake at least a day ahead to let the flavor expand. Have fun with this one!

This is one of the best tasting cakes I've ever made. I followed the recipe and instructions for frosting 100% and could not have been happier with the end result. This is going to be one of my go-to cakes for special occasions. The cake is very rich, but definitely worth it.

I decided to make this cake for my dad's 81st birthday. The cake looked yummy and simple to make. The cake looked very pretty but the cake was very dry! I baked it 29 minutes and should have checked at 25 minutes. I wish there had been more raspberry filling. There are much better chocolate cakes out there. The ganache icing is very rich. If the cake had been moist, it would have been much better but alas, no. Don't sprinkle powder sugar too early or it will just evaporate into the cake.

I've made this cake twice: once with raspberries, and once with strawberries. Both times the cake was absolutely perfect, and my neighbor, a very accomplished baker, told me it was the best cake she's ever had. You have to make this - you can't go wrong!!

I made this a couple of times and tweaked the recipe just a bit the second time w/ great results. I swapped melted unsalted butter for the vegetable oil and coffee for the water, which i thought brought out the chocolate flavor much better. I also didn't realize I didn't have enough bittersweet chocolate on hand so I used half semisweet in the ganache and thought it was still very good. The seedless jam is a must, because the raspberry seeds take away from the rest of the cake.

Although I didn't make the cake part (I used my standby Silver Palate Decadent Chocolate Cake), I am reviewing this b/c I followed the ganache and raspberry jam, freezing technique - - it's easier than it reads, assembles wonderfully and tastes divine. I made the ganache the night before, covered it (directly on the surface) with saran and cooled it at room temperature overnight. By the next morning, it was a perfect dollop-able and spreadable consistency. For the assembly, I did use more jam (also Bonne Maman, also couldn't tell the seeds were there). The raspberry flavor was subtle but delicious. I also mixed semisweet and bittersweet chocolate (chips) for the ganache, and added a bit of butter and corn syrup to guarantee shine. The individual parts of this recipe are very adaptable/flexible, which makes it extra-star worthy in my book, and the total package makes it standout!

Great recipe! If you're adding coffee make sure it's the BEST quality you can find, it does make a difference. I would also cut down on baking soda and vegetable oil. Ganache was very easy to make, but the second time I used whipping cream that only had 5g of fat and it took a while for it to thicken. So my advice would be to use the "fattest" whipping cream you can find.

This cake was a huge hit with my family, even my niece who normally only eats the frosting ate the entire piece. I did make a few changes, one unintentional, but it still worked out. At the recommendation of other reviewers I did the following- I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter and to the frosting. I used coffee instead of water (as I normally do for any baked chocolate good). You cant taste the coffee but it DOES bring out the chocolate flavor nicely. Instead of vegetable oil I used ½ melted butter and half canola (cause thats what I had). I also accidentally added 1 cup of buttermilk instead of ¾. Whoops, but it didnt seem to make difference. Upped the salt to ½ a teaspoon. My cake pans were 8 and the cake did take about 15 minutes longer to bake using these, but it worked fine. Also I had never heard you could gently press down the top of the cake if it puffed up but low and behold it worked! I used good quality chocolate chips for the frosting and added as suggested, a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon or so of corn syrup. Frosting the middle was a bit tricky. The jam on top, even though a thin layer, makes it kind of hard to spread the ganache. It slips around a bit but perhaps my ganache was too firm. I managed, but I think next time I will put smaller dollops over the layer and then lay saran wrap on top and smush it down. The texture was nice and dense, but not too dense, small tender crumb. It was super easy to put together besides the tricky frosting procedure, which was worth it. It was good the day I baked it, but I think next time Ill aim to do it the day before because the flavor really did develop after sitting for 24 hours. I will make it again!

Fabulous recipe! I would add more salt next time--not that it should taste salty, but it had that "unsalted" taste and was a little bland. Also, I didn't have the jam so I cooked some raspberries and sugar and strained the seeds out, which probably tasted better than store-bough jam. Finally, I need to practice more to give the ganache that beautiful smooth finish. It was yummy, but a little gloppy looking (even after doing a crumb coat and chilling for awhile).

Made this cake for my birthday. It's really, really delicious and moist, especially after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. I would recommend making it a day or two in advance. Some minor adjustments: I used 1/2 c water, 1/2 c coffee. Next time I'm using only coffee, it really brings out the chocolate flavor. I only used 1package of raspberries, more than enough. I used 6 tbsp of jam, but it could really use 8, possibly 9. I used Bonne Maman, which is my favorite raspberry jam (didn't notice the seeds at all). You can just barely taste it at 6 tbsp, so use more. I used only about 16 oz chocolate/2 c cream for the ganache, and it still yielded too much. You can cut the ganache recipe down a bit and still make enough to coat the cake. Bottom line: Great cake. I will make this again for sure!

I dont know what happened. i followed the recipe to a T. The cake came out dry and flavourless. And the ganache never thickened, it just remained runny. Given the high ratings, I would have to say that perhaps this is a fluke and I am at fault somehow. I will have to try again but for now I am disappointed.

Rating: 3
Very chocolately and not too sweet, but everyone loved it. Made 3 layers in regular 8" pans, bakes for 24 minutes. Cake is dense. Added 1tsp vanilla to batter and added 1tbs of corn syrup and 1 tsp of vanilla to ganache. Used about 9oz raspberry because it was 3 layers. Beautiful presentation. Would increase raspberry between layers to cut the chocolate flavor a bit.

I have made this cake twice now because it is so easy to make, and sooo chocolaty and moist. I opted to frost with lightly sweetened whipped cream, layered with fresh strawberries. I used two 8" cake pans and sliced each cake in half, making a total of 4 layers.

Rating: 2
The cake layers were great and I used strawberries and strawberry jam instead. I made 3 short 9"layers instead of two 2" high ones baking for 24 minutes. It came together beautifully, and everyone was impressed. But the ganache frosting was just too heavy and chocolaty. Crazy! As if anything could be too chocolaty, but it was.

I made this tonight for Mother's Day, and it was fabulous! Very moist and not too sweet. I used 70% cacao,and added a tsp of instant coffee to the water in the recipe. I also added a tsp vanilla, based on other reviews. I halved the ganache recipe and the amount was just right. I wish I had of added a TBSP of orange zest to the batter, as there is nothing better than the taste of chocolate orange! Do not skip the crumb coating step, as it is necessary to get a good finish on the cake for presentation. The dusting of icing sugar is a nice touch, adding a little sweetness to the bittersweet chocolate. I container of raspberries is plenty, no need to buy two. I doubled the raspberry jam, as did others, to enhance the flavour of the cake.

Made this recipe with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All purpose flour. It was delicious! Changes I made to the recipe, decrease the sugar to 1 cup, replace AP flour with Gluten Free flour, replace vegetable oil with light olive oil and added a tube of Starbuck's Via Italian Roast instant coffee. For the ganache frosting, I added a tbsp of corn syrup to the heavy cream to add sheen to the ganache. Would definitely make this one again.

Rating: 2
The ease of this drew me to it. Made it exactly as written. Has way too much bi-carb/baking soda. Probably needs half a teaspoon less. WAY too much ganache. Like 4x too much. Unless you want a cake to absolutely covered in ganache, by all means. But I am not one of those people that likes a 1" thick smear of chocolate on my cakes. Waste of good chocolate. Crumb was decent. Moist. Rich. Wouldn't make again.

I find that most chocolate cakes are pretty simple to put together...no creaming, alternating wet and dry or whipping egg whites etc., the water (standard when using cocoa in cakes) really Allows the ingredients to blend and the cakes texture is lovely. That said, I really wish that i had added coffee instead, or at least a little expresso powder to the water. Next time I will also use the magic strips around the pans to insure a nice even rise and a flat top.if you leave the cakes in the pans overnight, they are easier to pop out and not prone to falling apart ....things are more consolidated. I'd be afraid NOT to spray the sides, I think with the heat strips on the pans you'll get a nice solid rise, and chocolate cakes are extremely prone to sticking if they can. Very tender. Use the best chocolate you can for this, all of your senses will appreciate the quality. Raspberry was the perfect foil...just enough to taste and play with the chocolate.6 people told me it was they perfect cake, and the best they ever had. I bake a lot, and it's in my top 10.

so easy and so great! i would just add some vanilla to the ganache next time...and there will be a next time as this is hands down one of the easiest chocolate cake recipes ever (after doing a blackout cake last weekend and this one this weekend, i would say blackout is not worth all the effort- this one tastes just as good, if not better!)

Cake was rather easy to make and was good and chocolatey. Some bones to pick with the writer, though. 1. If you put the racks in the upper AND lower third of the oven, on which one doe you put the cake pans?? I put one rack in the middle and it worked out great. 2. If you spray the entire cake pan, the cake does not fully CLIMB the sides the way it should. I should have followed my instinct and NOT greased the sides. I did cut the layers in half and coated with jam except between the main layers and then used the ganache as well. No jam on top, just the lovely ganache. I did try to reach too far when I attempted to glaze the raspberries with sugar syrup. While they did shine beautifully - people thought at first the cake was fake it was too perfect!- the berries leaked and made a bit of a mess. Ah well.Very tasty nonetheless.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever had! I didn't have real cocoa powder and used the cheap kid's chocolate milk powder, and it was still to die for! It makes a beautiful presentation and everyone will want the recipe. I made whipped cream and a raspberry coulis on the side, delicious! Bon Appétit!

Rating: 4
I made this for a party and received rave reviews. I did add a TBS of raspberry liqueur to my jam before spreading on the layers, and I prefer to let my ganache set up and 'frost' the cake vs pouring. The only change I might make is to exchange out 1/4 to 1/2 of the water for coffee - just to add a little depth to the cake.

I made this for an event I was catering. it was by far the BEST chocolate cake I ever made. It disappeared from the buffet table very quickly! Two important changes: I needed a recipe with NO Dairy. I used a coconut based buttermilk substitute and a cashew/almond based heavy cream substitute. No one knew - Also, I made the cake and the ganache both 2 days in advance and refridgerated. I assembled 2 hours before serving - using the cake right out of fridge and warming the ganache GENTLY on top of a hot oven (not in it). I also followed the tip on crumb layer.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday. As many others have commented, it's fantastic. I baked the cake, made the ganache and assembled it all (without the raspberries) the day before serving. (Kept it overnight in the fridge with glass dome on top as suggested in the recipe.) Was lucky enough to find fresh raspberries on sale but you don't really need 2 x 6oz packs to decorate it: one would be sufficient, though it was nice to have the extras on the side. Only change I made to the recipe was to use 4 tbsps of jam on each layer - enough to get a thin but even coating.

I made this cake over the weekend for my father-in-laws 70th b.day. And I quote, "If I have ever tasted a better cake than this, I don't know when it was". It was so great to have exactly the cake he wanted for his special day. I orginally wrote this on a different choc.rasp.cake review- this is the correct cake!!

Rating: 4
This was very good! Everyone really liked it and, even better, it was not hard to make! The cake was excellent and not at all dry, although mine also was done in a little less than 30 minutes. I baked both pans on the middle oven rack. I made the cakes the day before and the ganache the day I served it. While mine was not absolutely picture perfect, the crumb coat did help a lot in allowing the final ganache layer to go on more smoothly. I used the jam but left the raspberries off the top due to cost/lack of seasonality but would put them on in the future and it would probably be even better! Will definitely make again!

cont... I would also say that it made a lot of ganache. And I would halve it next time too.

I used this recipe as a sheet cake and doubled the recipe for each layer to serve for a birthday party. I didn't use anything raspberry and it was still completely delicious!!!

Great recipe! The raspberry jam and the fresh raspberries really make this cake yummy :) I did not buy any special pans - actually, I just used regular 9-inch baking pans and everything seemed to fit... Also, instead of chopping up the chocolate, I just bought bittersweet baking chocolate CHIPS.

OMG! I need the fifth star to rate this one! This is the only and ultimate chocolate birthday cake recipe you will ever need. Despite total absence of butter and strange ingredients like buttermilk, oil and water, the resulting cake is moist, fluffy and melting in a mouth. The ganache is the easiest in the world and the best kept secret of French home bakers - just cream and the best chocolate you can buy. I must have eaten a quarter of it myself and I do not even like layer cake or any sort of birthday cake, period. A flourless hazelnut chocolate cake or a fruit tart is my idea of a desert, but this one combines the decadence of a pure chocolate with a chewiness of a heavenly cake. Serve with a raspberry coolis and they will think Julia Child came back to life.

Excellent recipe and I will make this one over and over again. After reading some of the reviews about the lack of raspberry flavor I decided to try a little bit more jam on each layer. I used 9oz total between the two layers and it was just right for everyone. Everyone loved this cake! Thanks Epicurious!

A masterpiece!! Baked this for my husband's birthday. Baked another single layer and an additional half recipe of the ganache so it was very high at three layers. The cake was an outstanding hit. Delicious and gorgeous. I don't believe that I have ever had such raves and I cook and bake alot. This will become a standard in my file!

This is the best cake I've ever made. My husband couldn't stop eating it. Instead of buying expensive chocolate for the ganache, I took a risk and use a 1-lb dark chocolate bar at Trader Joe's. It was incredible.

I'm going to be the lone dessenter and say it was good, but not great. Maybe it was the jam I used, but I didn't get enough raspberry flavor, and the chocolate cake was missing something. It needed vanilla and maybe some strong coffee to replace some of the water. (I made three layers in 8" cake pans btw-my only deviation). On the upside, the cake itself was super easy, and the timing for cooling the ganache is spot-on. And it LOOKED beautiful.

I doubled the recipe and made 2 10"round cakes, and ended up with 4 extra muffins. Chocolate cake lovers said this was the best cake they had ever tasted. Cake was super moist. I almost always brush my cakes with simple syrup or liquor. I also mixed the raspberry topping and ganache and spread between layers instead of doing separately. Dipping the bottom of the raspberry in ganache will help them stay solid on the cake.

I made this cake yesterday as a special request for a friend birthday. I choose this recipe based on the reviews claiming not to be too sweet. One friend attending the b day claimed was too full and didn't care for raspberries wasn't going to have a piece (she ate a piece and loved it in spite of raspberries) I choose semi sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet chocolate. I added 1 tsp of vanilla when I make this again I will try 2 tsp. Absolutely beautiful presentation several friends attending party took pictures of the cake with their cell phones. This cake is rich with a lot of chocolate flavor love the raspberries however would shake on more powdered sugar the raspberries drank up the powdered sugar. A little piece of this goes a long way.

This was one of the easiest and quickest cakes I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, and did not reduce any of the sugar or oil (I'm always tempted to do that) and it turned out perfectly.

I don't review many recipes, but I felt this one was worthy of one. I've made this cake twice in the last month for special occasions. The cake is super moist and not very sweet, which is just the way my family likes it. The top layer of ganache can be slightly difficult to work with, but if you tell yourself that this is a "rustic" cake, you won't be disappointed when you taste it. Each time I've made it, my husband has eaten 2 slices a day until it's gone!
