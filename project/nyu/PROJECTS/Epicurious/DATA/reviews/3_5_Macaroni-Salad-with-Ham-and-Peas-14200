This is delicious. I replaced half the mayo with Nayonaise. A soy based mayo. So the salad was not only very tasty but healthy too.. I used the parsley and it was very good and added color to the salad. Don't cut it up tiny but leave it in little floretts...

This was just OK. It needed some zing.

Sorry about all the typos, let me try again... This is pretty close to the macaroni salad I make, except (of course!) I add a grated carrot ( for color and one more veggie) and a can of sliced olives....and because we have no refrigeration at our country home, I don't use mayo, I use Ranch Dressing. It adds a little different flavor. And if you use the lite dressing, it makes it a low fat salad.

I haven't made this lighter sounding version, but grew up eating a similar salad in Wisconsin. It didn't have lemon, currents or milk, but it did have cubed cheese, a small amount of chopped onion and some yellow mustard added to the mayo.

I did as one other reviewer and used dill instead of parsley (also because it was all I had on hand). I also added chopped scallions I had left over for salads the night before. This was certainly quick and easy to make, which is a big plus in my book.

We made this after driving back to Connecticut from Cape Breton Island, NS. Although the food was good in Nova Scotia, we were in the mood for a lighter and more flavorful dinner. This did the trick. We loved it as did our daugter and son-in-law who were on the trip with us.

We loved this very easy to make recipe. I wasn't sure about the currents, but put them in and it gave the dish colour and a nice taste.

I substituted dill for the parsley and crumbled bacon for the ham. (It was what I had on hand...) It was quite good, and even my kids liked it!
