Very simply and very tasty recipe. Kind of like a peach dreamsicle. The kids (and adults) loved them.

Disappointing. I think this would be better using a more strongly flavored fruit, like raspberries.

These were good. I wanted them to be completely non-alcoholic, so I substituted Amaretto flavored syrup for the actual liquor. They turned out very well!

Delicious! I used peach schnapps instead of amaretto for a purely peachy flavor. Perfect use for those peaches that are a little bit overripe.

This recipe is also an excellent foundation for other yogurt/fruit pops. I just made strawberry ones using this recipe as a guideline.

Wow! This surpassed all my expectations. It was incredibly peachy and delicious. It does need the full day to freeze due to the amaretto, but it is well worth it. Followed recipe exactly, using tiny dixie cups, as I have no molds. Creamy and flavor-packed. Even better than my homemade sorbet, and far easier.
