Best Polenta recipe I have made. I use whatever fresh herbs I have on hand. I also like to add sauces on it to shake it up a little. A wonderfull cold night dinner, anyone can make

This was wonderful! My young son has declared this his new favorite food. I used fresh herbs, but only had cornmeal and regular cheddar. It was a bit too mushy to fry after cooling in a pan. Next time I'll add less broth or cook it longer. Even in the mushy state, we loved it!

Very good. Didn't use the marjoram, and it was still very good.

Don't know if I'm actually qualified to rate this recipe, as I discovered after beginning it that my fresh herbs were not really so fresh any more and my DH had eaten all of my cheddar. I used 2tsp Bell's poultry seasoning in lieu of the fresh herbs and used half fontina and half sharp provolone for the cheese. It was still delicious. I added no salt and it was still a bit salty, which must have come from the chicken stock I used. I look forward to trying this again with the correct ingredients!

I made this recipe two nights ago and was very pleased with the results. I have tried to make polenta several times in the past and never really liked my finished product. This was very flavorful and had a great texture. Halved the recipe and still had leftovers. Poured leftovers into a small loaf pan and refrigerated overnight. Last night I sliced my polenta loaf into 1/2" slices, dusted with flour and sauteed in olive oil. Almost better than the first night.

I'm not sure the recipe is to blame for the two fork rating! I'm glad I made this, if only to discover WHY I love polenta so much. I like it's simplicity, it's ability to marry with sauces. I found this recipe too salty and complicated, even though I minimized the cheese and herbs. However I did use the leftover polenta, sliced and pan fried crisp with a simple poached egg on top and that seemed to please my guests more. The simple egg softened the excess salt. You might like this more than I did. It's worth a try. Just watch the salt.

I give it 4 forks b/c it is so easy and tastes so good. This is a perfect comfort food, and the herbs give it the nicest fresh flavor while the cheese makes it creamy. YUM

I love this recipe served with a red pepper puree or tomato concasse. It's good made with different broths, herbs and cheeses and then grilled - making it a great basic versatile recipe.

A very good polenta recipe. I let it sit overnight and then sliced and grilled it. The flavors were excellent.

Didn't have white cheddar the first time I made this, so I used some Asiago. Worked just fine. I have since used several different cheeses, and they all work. The fresh herbs are what give this wonderful flavor and aroma.

Even the leftovers were delicious. I would definitely make this again.

This was so good that my husband who thought he didn't like polenta asked for seconds, I cut the recipe in half, now I wish I hadn't. But I will make it again very soon.

This dish is great. The white cheddar cheese really makes it. Try making fried polenta cakes with the leftovers.
