I made this in a bundt pan with no issues -- just make sure you butter and flower it really well. I think leaving the nuts out would be a major error -- the crunch made the cake amazingly delicious.

Easy, delicious, and even better the next day.

fantastic. It's almost like a pie or strudel. Added some cardamom and substituted 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour for 1 cup white which made it even more hearty. Gooey and crunchy all at the same time.

Apples from my CSA were accumulating faster than I could eat them, so was glad to find this recipe to use up my non-Granny Smiths. Substituted dried cherries for the raisins and candied pecans for the walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Here's the kicker - had some leftover Solo brand almond pastry filling (about 3/4 cup) and folded that into the batter. Baked in a bundt pan for 1 hour 15 min., but a cake tester came out a little moist, so I baked it an additional 8 min. Perfect. Took it to work the next morning and got raves; one fellow came by to specifically thank me for the best apple cake ever. I think this recipe is adaptable with all kinds of variations; just check for doneness with a cake tester.

My brother-in-law rated this as the best apple cake ever known to man.

This is a tasty recipe that I will make again with a few modifications. As per another suggestion on here, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins - and I'm glad I did. I found the cake a bit sweet, so I enjoyed the tartness of the cranberries. Might reduce the sugar slightly next time too. My one complaint is that I was underwhelmed by the amount of apple in this apple cake, so I'll definitely add more next time. (Maybe an extra cup??) I ended up making this in buttered muffin tins instead of a cake pan so my husband and I wouldn't eat it all at once (fortunately, they freeze well) and in some muffins there is only apple in one or two bites which is disappointing. All in all, a tasty, easy dessert though - and especially great that I have a bunch of individual portions in the freezer for future enjoyment or to pull out for last minute guests!

Great recipe, very easy to make and the cake turned out delicious. Since I was just short of the listed amount of vegetable oil, I added about 3 table spoons of rapeseed oil to make up the right quantity. Maybe this is why my cake turned out quite dark, I'm not sure. I may reduce the amount of oil slightly next time, I think it would still turn out lovely with a bit less oil. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will become a staple in my kitchen, I'm sure.

This recipe was very good and easy to make. I made the recipe exactly as written, except that I did not peel the apples. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful Apple Cake. I made a few modifications that I think really deepened the flavor: I added about 3/4 of a cup apple butter which gave it more spice and added moisture, and I also basically tripled the amount of apple. Before baking, it looked like a bowl of apples thinly covered in dough. The apples cook down a lot though, and I can't imagine what adding too many would look like, if it's even possible. I also added sunflower seeds in place of walnuts, and left out the raisins. I've given the recipe to other people who haven't made these changes and it hasn't come out nearly as well.

Baked for 1 hr 20 minutes. Appeared ready. An hour later went to check cake out - had a crunchy exterior with inside cake sunken by at least an inch. Very doughy. what happened???

I made this and also cut down about 1/4 cup of the oil - added a splash of milk at the end and about a cup of fresh chopped cranberries and a handful of currants. (no raisins, and no nuts) I also cut down the sugar a little bit. Finally I baked it in a smaller sheet cake pan which took about 40 minutes. It came out delicious and moist but does taste more like a breakfast cake than dessert.

I was looking for a spur-of-the moment easy dessert to make and came upon this recipe. What a find! I made this in a heart shaped bundt pan and it was beautiful and delicious. I found that it was done in about 50 minutes, though and had a wonderful crunchiness on the outside while maintaining a very moist interior. It's perfect for dessert or as a breakfast pastry. I plan on making this often.

This is a delicious cake! I literally just finished a piece and decided to take the time to write a review...which I rarely do. I only changed a couple things, but I'm sure if made to recipe it would still be delicious. Here is what I changed: instead of a cup and a half of oil, I did 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick), 1/2 cup oil and an extra egg. I used toasted slivered almonds instead of walnuts because its what I had and I omitted the raisins. I am seriously considering going for a second piece right now...so yummy!!

A followup to my review, which is the previous one. I made the cake a 2nd time (two nights in a row!), this time with raisins, and liked the dried cranberries better. Also, I used a bit less than 1 full cup of cranberries since that was what I had.

Fantastic cake! The outside got crispy near the pan and it was heavenly. My only substitution was dried cranberries for raisins since it turned out I was out of raisins. I sprinkled with confectioners sugar but am making another tonight to serve with vanilla ice cream. Delish!

Exceptional flavor. However, next time I make it , I will try to cut the oil by a quarter cup. I found it to be a bit too oily.

This is the second apple cake I have made this week and this one is far superior...moist, dense and rustic. It would be equally good for dessert or breakfast. Delicious!

Super recipe--quick & easy to make--looks impressive--I dusted the top with powdered sugar--it doesn't need any icing. Good with ice cream. Took it to a party & everyone wanted the recipe. Have made it twice--both times without raisins, once with pecans, once with walnuts--the walnuts are better.

Delicious! I brought this along to friends and it was a big hit as an autumn seasonal treat. Made it exactly as per the recipe, except the pan. I don't have a plain 9" tube pan, so I used a Bundt pan, and baked exactly the 1 hour 15 minutes and it was perfect. Slight crispness to the crust, nice moist soft crumb inside.

Easy to make and everybody loved it. I've made it twice now. I used 3 apples and one pear (I cut the pear smaller than the apple).
