This recipe turned out exactly as I had expected, and it was delicious. Reducing the stock with the mirepoix gave a much better flavor than just plain stock, and the final sauce was a perfect consistency, much like a veloute. I'd also recommend medium-high heat on the potatoes to get a nice crispy edge on them, it's a better texture contrast to the sauce and scallops. Admittedly, the sauce recipe could be better written. For my results I halved everything except the corn (I used two ears), and I had a little more than a simmer going most of the time. I ended up reducing 3c of stock by about half before straining and adding the corn. That ratio of starch to liquid worked out beautifully. In the end, really good but it still lets the scallops shine. Definitely making again.

I thought this was aweswome -- used chicken, with sauce cut corn kernals off and juiced them and then just cooked them and added a little ginger and lemongrass...holy delicious!

Overly complicated instructions to make, what is essentially vegetable stock. And the volume of sauce/stock is grossly out of proportion with the rest. Scallops are done, but I've got at least three more nights worth of "sauce" to go through (and I even made less than the recipe called for!) Flavor-wise it's ok. But I wouldn't make it again.

We loved this dish, my husband and me and the cat. I'll definitely make it again. The trick with this recipe and satisfaction, I suppose, is to use a bit of common sense because it IS overly-complicated as is. For example, I thought do I really need to boil the corn cobs for 45 minutes in this particular recipe, when none of the other steps require such a time investment? I really don't think it could possibly make enough difference to make it worthwhile! I simmered the corn as I was cooking the potatoes and only added about half the broth, probably a bit less. Did add a splash of white wine and think cream would have been good too but it did not need it at all. Also, I strained my corn for the smooth texture but don't think this was absolutely necessary. And unless your corn is really fresh, I can't imagine that frozen corn wouldn't work equally as well. There is a lot of the corn sauce and I do think making extra potatoes, while not as healthy, does make the dish more substantial, particularly if they have been fried in a iron skillet. The coriander crust on the scallops was a perfect foil to the sweetness of the meat and the corn.

Made a mistake and cooked the corn from 3 cobs with the veggies in 4 C stock so had to blend all together. The resulting sauce was thick and full of flavor. I did not strain the sauce. I will use this sauce next summer on garden fresh veggies with scallops. A tasty sauce with no cream.

I made this for Christmas dinner 2008. For heartier servings, I increased the scallops, and halved the corn sauce, and doubled (or more) the potato hash. After simmering the sauce the first time, I added thawed, frozen corn. After a second simmer, I pureed the sauce in the blender, but skipped the straining, both to ease the workload and to give a heartier base. It was really quite delicious.

Be certain when you prepare this dish that your diners like fish, corn and potatoes... I made this for my wife and she loved it... The potato hash was easy, scallps easy as long as you dont overcook, but the sauce is time consuming but delicious. Add some uncooked corn to the blend and some heavvy cream and reduce and you have a wonderful cream corn...Hash in large donut shape on dish, fill with scallops, corn sauce on outer ring...deliciouso

I agree with Wayland, the hash and the corn "sauce" recipe were such a waste. But the scallops were amazing! All that time lost...

Mixed review - liked the scallops; liked the hash; but what a waste of time making that sauce!! It's reduced vegetable stock and then pureed with corn - not a sauce! Thin and weak tasting. A real big waste of time.

We made this for "Girl's Night" along with the Mango Salad and Figs in balsamic vinegar and red wine reduction (both found on this site). This was great. The coriander was milder than expected and accented the scallops. The hash and corn sauce were tasty, as well. The only thing I would change would be to make half as much of the corn sauce and twice as much of the hash.

this went terribly wrong. Lacking in any significant taste, and the coriander ruined the scallops, it took a very long time to prepare for such a depressing concuision. On the upside, it looked pretty when the chevril oil was drizzled over the corn sauce.
