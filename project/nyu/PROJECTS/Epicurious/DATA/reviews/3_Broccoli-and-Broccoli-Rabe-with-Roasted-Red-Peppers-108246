I used butter instead of oil and in definitely gave the dish a lot of flavor.

I thought this was delicious, couldn't find broccoli rabe, so used broccolini instead.

Thought this was pretty boring. Could have had the same effect by sprinkling cooked broccoli with red pepper flakes and garlic.

Loved the recipe. But you have to like broccoli rabe. Great with almost any fish or meat dish.

I thought it was a great recipe - you need to like broccoli rabe though which is a bitter veggie.

Great recipe and easy. Minced the garlic instead of slicing it for more garlic taste. Used the broccoli mixture as a topping for fried chicken breast sandwiches with sharp provolone cheese and great Italian bread. Was a big hit.

Sorry! Thought this recipe was not very tasty. I found the broccoli rabe to be quite bitter. Did not taste right with the roasted red pepper. Will not make this again!
