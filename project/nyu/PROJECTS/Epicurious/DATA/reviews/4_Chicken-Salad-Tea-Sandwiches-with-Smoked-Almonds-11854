I get requests for this every time I make it! The smoked almonds really turn this up a notch, don't omit them. Also, to save time, I sometimes just buy a roasted chicken from the grocery store and shred the meat (rather than the fuss of poaching), and it works great!

This is the only chicken salad recipe I need. I agree with all comments to cut the shallots down. Didn't have smoked almonds, so toasted some with a schmeer of evoo and a sprinkle of royal curry. No grapes, so subbed in quartered grape tomatoes. It was deelish, and proved that this is the perfect base to do pretty much anything you want with. YUM

Love it! Enjoyed the salad in tea cake form, but also often make a 'light' version with low fat mayonnaise, and eat it atop a bed of spinach for lunch. Really simple, really tasty!

i made this last night for a church function and it was a hit. the crowd was older and i thought the smoked almonds would not be a welcomed taste but to my surprise the crowd was begging for more. this was already requested for the Christmas party. i did make half with the blue diamond smokehouse almonds and the other half w/out. 4/4 thx for recipe :D

I've been making this recipe for years and years. The tarragon and shredding the chicken are what make this chicken salad special. I make it just as a salad and also make the sandwiches. Do not skip the smoked almonds. They make the sandwich truly wonderful. Always a huge hit!

Rating: 4
The tarragon and smoked almonds took these sandwiches to another level. Highly recommended! To get the thin slices of bread I cut out shapes w/ a cookie cutter and then, carefully using a serrated bread knife, I cut each shape into 2 thin slices. Time consuming yes, but worth the extra effort. Made croutons with the bread trimmings.

This recipe would get 3-4 stars if it called for half the amount of shallots- I used a 1/4 c. instead of 1/3 c. and their flavor was still way too strong.

I was looking for a new recipe outside the traditional southern style chicken salad sandwich and came across this one. I am so glad I did! This was the best recipe and so easy to make! It was such a hit at our Ladies Tea at our church last night. I used celery flakes instead of shallots and it was so yummy! Not only do the smoked almonds make for a beautiful presentation, it adds such a great flavor! Can't wait to make this again! FYI, I cut the sandwiches before adding the filling so we could use the scraps for bread crumbs. Just thought I would share since some of the reviews mentioned something about wasting the bread. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

So easy and delicious! I brought to a work potluck and now it's requested every time! I did change the recipe a bit, I doubled the tarragon, minced some dried cranberries for sweetness, and mixed in the smoked almonds. I also cut down the shallot to barley a 1/4 cup and was still slightly overpowered. I also just cut off the crusts and made triangles so less was wasted.

Absolutely the best chicken salad on the planet. Simple to make, elegant presentation with the smoked almond trim, and I have never served this without requests for the recipe, and never a morsel is left behind!

This is a winner! I added some chopped chutney and a jar of pimentos for color. In our small town, the proper bread is often a problem. Founds Walmarts bakery sandwich bread suitable.

I don't know that I'm normally inclined to give something 4 forks when it's not something extra special, but this is such a solid staple I can't see any reason not to. The recipe as-written is great (I love shallots!); the filling on its own stands pretty well with or without the almonds. Add dried cherries or cranberries, add grape halves, or chives, or celery...lots of places to go with this and they're all very tasty.

Rating: 4
Absolutely smashing! I always get rave reviews and recipe requests when I make this. I am a shallot fan, so I don't reduce it like some reviewers have. I also add black pepper, a dash of sea salt, and double the tarragon. I've made this with both mayonnaise, and Miracle Whip, and both are delicious. Be sure to use smoked almonds!!! They make this dish really sing. Don't bother cutting out the circles too much effort, and they create waste of this great salad.

Rating: 4
I don't give 4 stars often - these are great tea sandwiches. I made three kinds for an event and this was the best, hands down. Definitely go easy on the shallots. I only added about half, and they still made their point. Also, I cut the sandwiches (no crusts) into quarters (triangles) instead of rounds. I put the almonds on the two short sides. Fresh tarragon is a must!

I made this recipe for a bridal shower and tried it ahead of time as written with the chopped almonds on the edge of the sandwich and also as a filling in mini croissants with the almonds mixed in. The recipe as written with the almonds on the edge is the best for getting the smoked flavor; but for a crowd, it is faster to mix them in and still delicious. If you mix the almonds into the chicken, it is better to leave them in chunks. To do this I put them in a zip-lock bag and rolled them with a rolling pin. The food processor tended to make them too fine. I also experimented with adding seedless grape halves to the mix. That was good too if making larger sandwiches or to serve on lettuce as a salad.

I made these sandwiches for a baby shower, with a 'trial run' a couple of weeks earlier. Everyone loved them, and several people asked for the recipe. The second time I made them I cut the crusts off the bread and then just cut the sandwiches in half before adding the nuts. The round sandwiches made a very nice presentation, but I hated the waste, and cutting out the circles adds extra time, of which I was short. The taste of the chicken salad itself is wonderful.

This recipe is amazing. I have made it mulitple times. The first was for my first "Afternoon Tea" I hosted for my English Mother- in-law and my mother. The guys said anything involving tiny sandwiches meant get out of the house fast. After forcing my husband to just try it he changed his mind. Now he requests it often. However, I do make them full size when it is just for him :)

Exceptional, especially with Kosher or organic chicken breast. "The best chicken salad I have ever had", said one guest. Like other reviewers, I subbed plain yogurt for some of the mayo, and served the salad in individual endive leaves for an afternoon tea.

I've made this for several showers and parties and it is always a hit. I use way less mayo than called for since I don't really like mayo and sometimes I've even subbed reduced fat miracle whip. It still turns out great. While fresh tarragon is better I've used dried with good results too.

I prepared this recipe twice, the first time I thought it was bland and boring, so the second time I really played with the seasoning. I served it in phillo cups instead of sandwiches, with a sprinkle of chopped smoked almonds on top. Very pretty presentation, and goes a long way.

This recipe has been a staple for picnics, beach days, and light lunches in my family for years. It's always a hit. However, I always put the almonds in the mix with the chicken so it isn't really good the next day. The almonds lose their crunch.

Have been making this for years. My minor tweaks include - 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream (approx - I HATE Mayo) but this works. When I don't have smoked almonds on hand I toast slivered or sliced almonds, almost as good. Fresh tarragon is the best, I even planted a bush so I can have this all summer long at Art Festivals. It travels well and then I have something healthy to eat when I can catch a quick break.

It seems like I have something sort of shower to throw every year and this is no doubt the go to recipe that everyone loves.

I make this exact recipe EXCEPT with the addition of freshly squeezed lemon juice (to taste)added to the mayo mix. It elevates the taste of all the ingredients (esp. the tarragon). For a change from round cuts, you can also cut triangles (just in case it had not already occured to you). I got the recipe (with the juice) from the Gourmet Cookbook. - Oh yeah - this is also really good with smoked chicken and/or mango chutney instead of tarragon. OK, now I have gone too far off topic ;)

I recently sent the link for this recipe to a girlfriend who was throwing a high tea and wanted to emulate Southern California's Huntington Tea Room chicken salad. She and her mom made the filling; I did the sandwich prep (we used orange bread, and the bits of orange peel set off the delicate filling). The almond edging (we used candied nuts) elicited oohs and ahhs, and I admit I felt like a kindergartener discovering the joys of glue and glitter for the first time during prep, except with mayo and chopped nuts -- I don't know who thought it was cooler, the guests or the family in the kitchen as the sandwiches took shape. The just-enough hints of shallot and terragon with tender chicken was more than elegant. I'll definitely be making these for my Christmas Eve morning high tea.

While I wasn't the one who made this recipe, one of the guests at a baby shower I attended this past weekend brought this as her "dish" and it was fabulous--everyone raved about it and requested the recipe from her, which I just received.

I am eager to try this recipe out myself the next time I have to bring a dish to a party!

Great tasting salad when you let it stand for about 30 minutes so everthing can combine. We added the almonds right into the salad mixture and used swiss cheese to add a twist. We also tried grilled chicken breast but it did nothing for the flavor. Three green onions chopped up made a great addition also....

I liked this recipe, but also recommend the addition of chives and try doubling the amount of tarragon OR to taste. Another addition is sliced almonds incide and instead of MAYO try using 1/3-1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1 T. dijon mustard... you could also add fennel.

I have to admit that after reading all the rave reviews, I was underwhelmed. It's a decent chicken salad, but it didn't have enough flavor to be outstanding. I used fresh tarragon and shallots and added some celery. I mixed in some smoked almonds and coated the edges in almonds as well. I also coated some edges in chopped chives, which I liked better than the almonds (and I love almonds). I'll give these one more try for an upcoming party, but will definitely do both white and wheat breads for appearance, use half sour cream and half mayo, and perhaps add some grapes as suggested by others. Maybe it needs a lot more tarragon and/or salt - it was just too bland for my taste.

I made this for a tea party, and I had far too much chicken salad for the sandwiches. (This is not a complaint.) I mixed the almonds into the chicken salad, and it was great. I served the leftover chicken salad atop raw spinach, and it was just as good the second time around.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Did what others have suggested and ground the almonds in with the rest. Used canned chicken breast which made it even more simple to prepare--probably the only time I would ever consider using canned chicken. If you add the almonds in with the chicken salad, decide if you want a coarser texture or more smooth. I wish I'd chopped them up outside the processor and folded them in for more texture. For easy but impressive presentation, I used phyllo cups premade, and placed a smoked almond on top of each. Very tasty, and they looked terrific.

Just took this recipe to a gardening group function in New Canaan, CT. It was a hit. Made cirles cutting the bread with a wine glass and dipped just a portion of the ends in the nuts. There were 12 ladies there all asked for the recipe. Pepperidge Farm thin bread is what I bought - put wheat on the bottom and white on top all placed on a three tiered platter. A hit for sure. Glad there a couple left over for dinner.

This is a great chicken salad recipe; even my husband who is ambivalent about chicken loves it. If you don't have easy access to fresh shallots or tarragon, you can use Penzey's "Shallot Pepper" blend to taste. Since this spice blend consists of coarse salt, pepper, shallots, tarragon and bay leaves, you need to reduce the amount of almonds because salt it part of the mixture. Also, the addition of some sliced seedless grapes (red or green), lend it some nice sweetness.

These are the best ever. I have made them 4 times. I've loved cooking my whole life and we all try to find that one receipe that everyone will rave about... this is it!! Make some triangles and some rounds...when making the rounds, I put two round mounds of the chicken salad in the two corners that will be cut. After cutting the two circles, open the scraps of bread and scrape the left-over chicken salad back into the bowl..no waste except for the bread and my chickens will argue with that point. The Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are the most important part of the presentation.. Don't leave them out.

This is simply wonderful. Tweakable too - I used basil instead of tarragon (just wanted a change!) and it was great. Tried walnuts instead of almonds - yes! Make it exactly and you won't be disappointed but don't be afraid to use it as a springboard to other great sandwiches.

Whether or not you make "tea sandwiches," this recipe gives you the blueprint for the BEST chicken salad. Absolutely declicious. This recipe drew raves at a recent afternoon tea and all the sandwiches were gobbled up quickly. We're already planning to make up a big batch of the chicken salad to have ready for lunches. Some notes: You will need more almonds to coat all 24 sandwich round edges. However, although the almonds are lovely for presentation, the sandwich does just fine without them. Also, I didn't used smoked almonds, which worked out fine as well.

Used rotisserie chicken breast from the supermarket and substituted dry for fresh tarragon.

This is possibly the best chicken salad I've ever had. I almost left off the smoked almonds because it seemed too fussy, but they really put it over the top.

I used a lot more tarragon than this recipe calls for (in fact, you could skip it entirely if you only plan on using the amount given) and a smidge more mayo in the salad itself.

I always WANTED to like chicken salad, but I never really loved it until I found this recipe. It is the best.

I agree with a previous reviewer - if you don't have tarragon, go ahead and use thyme or basil (I used dried). I did and it turned out great. Also, the almonds on the edge of the sandwich are so easy to do and it really makes a great visual impression. Take the extra five minutes - your guests will be impressed! I made three other finger sandwiches as well and this was the overall favorite.

I think the moral of this recipe is that if you use fresh herbs (one time I only had only a small amount of tarragon in my herb garden so I also threw in margarom and thyme), something from the onion family (most of the time I don't have shallots on hand so I use a _little_ bit of yellow onion), and almonds (toasted if you can't find smoked) You will turn out one great chicken salad.

This was a big hit at a luncheon for me as well. I did change it just a bit..I used a baked chicken, added more mayo and threw in halved grapes.

I love chicken salad and this is now one of my favorite versions. I too left the almonds chunky and mixed them in, and therefore didn't need the extra mayonnaisse. Used Pepperidge Farm "Very Thin" sliced white bread, cut in trangles, left crusts on - it was great.

This is a versatile recipe- i've used it on store bought whole wheat, homemade, and even pita bread, and it has been delicious every time (i love the tarrgon and smoked alomond flavor). i never bother to roll the sandwiches, i just add a layer of the almonds on top of the chicken, but i might go the trounle if presentation were an issue- certainly not at a family picnic. great recipe!

Fab! The reviews do not lie: this is the quintessential chicken salad recipe. I've made this a few times and I prefer to use the breast from a store bought rotisserie chicken and a bread that's a little more interesting than white. The nuts on the edge is preferable -- the mayo overwhelms the smokey taste of the almonds if they're mixed in.

This really was the BEST chicken salad I have ever made!

I made this receipe but changed it a little and it was absolutely the very best chicken salad I've ever had. Here are my changes, I baked a whole chicken then used about half of it, shredded it up, used 1/2 cup mayonaise, 1tsp of minced tarragon leaves, fresh, l/3 cup of minced green onion, and one stalk of fresh celery chopped very fine. I added the almonds (regular) just before serving by sprinkling in. Spread on white bread. Fantastic everyone was begging for more.

Destroy all the other chicken salad recipe's you have ~ THIS IS THE ONE!!! I used leeks in place of the shallot since that's what I had.

When I make this at home for my family, I will probably do as some of the other reviewers and simply mix the toasted almonds in with the chicken. For a special occasion though, I highly recommend spreading the almonds on the edges of the bread. The presentation is wonderful, and well worth the effort.

Easy but great. I mixed in the almonds as suggested by other reviewers. Took as filling for sandwiches on a picnic. Will definitely make this again.

Sounds delicious, but where did all of you find the smoked almonds, can you make them at home?

I followed an earlier cook's review and mixed the crushed smokehouse almonds in with the chicken and it was superb -- I doubled the recipe and made this for a Panhellenic meeting which about 30 sorority women attended -- they all just raved about how delicous the sandwiches were! I had some chicken salad left over from the tea sandwiches I made for the meeting, so my husband made a huge sandwich with it and he pronounced it the BEST chicken salad he has ever eaten! This recipe is fantastic!!

I made these on croissants for a bridal shower and they were such a hit she asked if I would make them for her wedding. We mixxed in the almonds with the dressing. Delicious!

We catered an art gallery opening and featured these sandwiches. They were delicious and we were fighting over the leftovers. One of two or three of my top rated chicken salads. As mentioned by another reviewer, we also made 4 triangular sandwiches, which was a lot less waste than the rounds.

We made these for afternoon tea on NY Eve (so we wouldn't be ravenous before our late-night supper) and they were lovely!

I needed MAN sandwiches for a weekend get-away, so I didn't cut off the crusts, left the sandwich whole, and added the cusinarted almonds to the inside of the sandwich. Terrific, and will always use this recipe!

I made these for a bridal shower. They were excellent! I also cut them into triangles and coated the edges. I also poached a whole chicken a day prior to the party and had it deboned & chopped, ready to go.

This is a top pick for a tea party sandwich. My guests loved the combination of flavors provided by the tarragon and shallots. What simplified the recipe was buying a roasted chicken and shredding the meat -- quite a time saver! Another adaptation was substituting the almonds for green onion flavored macadamia nuts..yum!!

Made this for a baby shower. It was the hit of the party. I used flat leaf parsley instead of tarragon (worried about picky eaters), and bought whole roasted chickens. I also quartered the sandwiches diagonally -- less waste. I did use twice the smoked almonds, but I coated all the cut sides of the sandwiches. A little tedious, but the results were well worth it! My husband says it's the best chicken salad he's ever tasted.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had! The tarragon adds a wonderful dimension to a traditionally plain salad. I do admit however, that I cheated by using precooked chicken pieces to cut the prep time down. I ground the almonds in my mini processor, so overall, I found the recipe easy to prepare.

Recipe was absolutely great- assembly was a little more time consuming than advertised. One, note, I served this at a Baby Shower and most of the guests (at first) thought it was a sweet and avoided it- once they knew what it was it was gone! Maybe we're not too sophisticated in NH!

I was short on time & cut the crustless sandwiches into quarters. I then put the almonds on the long side of the triangle. The chicken needed longer to cook than what the recipe said.

I made this recipe for a women's tea that I attended. As soon as people started eating them I was getting requests for the recipe! They were easy to make except for chopping the almonds, which took almost 45 minutes alone because I found I needed more than the recipe called for to coat the sandwiches properly. The combination of flavors was completely divine - I wouldn't substitute anything!

I made these sandwiches for a special luncheon meeting where the members take turns supplying the light lunch. We are a mix of professional men & women. This meeting happened to fall on Valentine's Day so I cut the bread into heart shapes before spreading on the chicken mixture. I agree it took time to coat each one with the almonds but it was well worth it. I think I used more mayo on the outside than was called for & also more chopped nuts. I just used what was needed to coat each sandwich edge. They got absolute rave reviews! They looked so great & then tasted SO good that I will make them again just so I can enjoy them at home. I had to make them the night before because of the time involved but wrapped them with wax paper, damp paper towels, & finally plastic wrap & they stayed as fresh as could be.

This was an absolute hit! If you want to add the smoked almonds on the edges, just factor in a little more time than alloted because I wasn't able to do all the sandwiches with the almonds. They were also delicious without the almonds, but I think the almonds add that extra zest.

The grocery store didn't have any shallots (not unusual for New Mexico), so I added a few scallions plus some snipped dried apricots. Very moist and delicious. I made them for a meeting and served them with cream of potato soup with green chiles and corn and brownies for dessert. Everyone thought the menu was satisfying, but not too heavy.

I made this recipe for my sister's August bridal shower, along with 3 other tea sandwiches, and this one was the big hit of the afternoon! I made one small change to the recipe: I substituted chopped Granny Smith apple for the scallions. The apple added extra texture and offset the almond nicely. I'll definately make this again.

These were delightful. I made sixty little sandwiches for a baby shower of 15-20 people and they all went! I did half mayonnaise and half sour cream. So good!

These were fabulous and so easy to make. They were slightly time consuming but well worth the effort. I used Light and Dark Rye breads for a color assortment. The presentation is great and perfect for Teas, Luncheons, Showers and Coffees. I will definitely be using this one again.
