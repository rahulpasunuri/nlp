I had been looking forward to making this cake all year for my Father's birthday - he loves Maple. I was really disapponted. The candy was good, but the cake was kind of dry and the frosting was just butter. I think a few modifications could make this better, but as is I would not make this cake again.

I was really disappointed with this cake. It was not moist and the butter icing just tasted like butter, no maple flavour at all. I might make it again if I changed it a bit, but overall I found it really bland.

This cake was a big hit with my family! Having never experimented with candy-making before, I'm not sure that the candy turned out the way it was supposed to, but it still tasted fine. The temperature never reached 300 degrees, but it started burning on the bottom so I decided to take it off the stove and continue anyway. The flavor of the cake was great. For those of you who may not be familiar with making buttercream icing (like me!), don't worry if it gets soupy or even curdled-looking as you add the butter. By the time you add the final stick, it will be smooth and the perfect consistency for spreading. I added just a splash of maple flavoring at the end because it tasted a bit buttery for my liking. The end result was very satisfying and I will definitely make this again.

I found the cake a bit thick, but other than that it was great! Everyone loved the candy and the buttercream. I will make this many times again!

Full of rich maple flavor!! I could have eaten the entire thing myself.
