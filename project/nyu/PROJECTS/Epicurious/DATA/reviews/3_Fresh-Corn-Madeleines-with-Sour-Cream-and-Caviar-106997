This was excellent and so easy. Used shelf stable caviar that was $8.00 instead of the $65 for sevruga and it was fine. Everyone loved it!

These are fabulous, and relatively easy to make. I have successfully used frozen corn. My husband always asks me to make these if we are having caviar. I only have a large madeleine pan, so I use about 1 1/2 tbsp per madeleine. We each get 6 each for dinner, with caviar and sour cream. With champagne and a salad, it's perfect.

Most of our guests enjoyed these apps. I didn't have mini-madeleine molds and used a mini mini muffin mold. It was still too big, taking a tablespoon, not a teaspoon of batter. Next time, I'll definitely make smaller madeleines to properly balance the sour cream and caviar.

This was very presentable and such a sophisticated dish! I happened to have some caviar in the fridge and brand new mini-madeleine molds and voila, a dish that none of my friends could make. The madeleines were good by themselves, and the caviar was definitely a nice touch.

Found this to be a bit of a bland support for caviar but would definitley make them for a bbq or picnic.

The corn madeleines were very easy to make. They definitely were better served with the sour cream and caviar; lacked salt on their own. topping them neatly was challenging- but they were very popular at our party.

To the Cook from Philadelphia: a "braai" is pretty similar to a barbeque. Because we have such great weather here in SA, a braai is a traditional and popular way to entertain.

To the cook from South Africa,I am curious to know what a braai is. I don't think I've ever heard of it. It does sound interesting, though.

I served this with a braai and everyone loved it - very different for a change. Left out the caviar with the braai(barbecue) but will include it with a fish braai.

Thought these were delicious! Make a great appetizer! You don't have to use caviar. Could use tapenade, bruschetta topping etc. Best to eat them within a few hours or freeze as soon as they are cool and re-heat.

There must be alternatives to the sevruga caviar. Recently, Newsweek listed palatable substitutes, including American caviar, Salmon and Trout Roe. Otherwise, this dish is insanely expensive.

Perfect look & taste. Very tempting on a platter
