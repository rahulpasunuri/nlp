Excellent - followed the recipe to the letter and made plenty for a medium head of cabbabge. Dressed the cabbage, refrigerated and served about two hours later with great results, Guests remarked how good it was, too. Will make again - went great with bbq ribs,

Oh, an addition. I don't love celery seed and so only put in a strong pinch.

I don't usually prefer creamy slaw, but I have to say the balance of flavors of this recipe are the best. Absolutely love this recipe, as is. I halved it and didn't find it too salty or too sweet or too vinegary. I guess it's all up to each person's taste. This works for mine.

About to make this for the second time. My kids devoured it and my friends said it was the best slaw they'd ever had :) Loved the pickles...

This is a good recipe, but I would caution you to taste it before adding the salt. I ended up deciding it was too salty and had to double the cabbage and add more mayo to compensate.

This is a KEEPER!! I will never make another. I followed directions but adjusted the horseradish because of strength. I was out of celery seeds so I used 1tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning for the seeds and salt.

I don't think I would make this again - the flavour was a bit one-note. It reminded me of Big Mac sauce. If that sounds good to you, give it a try!

Great classic coleslaw dressing that was super easy and quick to put together. Threw in a little fresh jalapeno for spice. Wonderful!

Really nice - very very creamy. Had to make it without the horseradish (last minute), and it was fine. Found the amount of mayo a little overwhelming - would cut back on that next time.

I have made a lot of different coleslaw dressings, but this is the best. Served it with pulled pork and a cucumber salad. Fantastic meal.

I'd never made coleslaw before but needed a quick side for pulled pork sandwiches. I used my mini-Cuisinart to chop everything then added in the mayo to combine, which worked perfectly. I halved the recipe since I only had a 4 1/2 cup pckg of Trader Joe's cabbage. Took 4 minutes from beginning to end. Loved it!

Very good and extremely quick. I cut back just a tad on the sugar and mayo. I let it marry in the refridgerator 5 hours before serving. Well balanced.

Wow. This dressing kicks ass. It is that good I took another readers suggestion and didn't use as much horseradish. Would love to see if the kids will eat it.

First time I've ever deviated from my standard cole slaw recipe. I made this to dress broccoli slaw tonight for dinner. This is probably the best slaw dressing I've ever eaten. This will be my new standard. nb, I cut back a bit on the horseradish for the kids.

I love coleslaw but find decent coleslaw recipes hard to come by - this one is outstanding. One correction - I put in half the mayo - it's much better that way.

Good luck waiting a day until you devour this creamy, well-balanced slaw! It's perfect right out of the bowl. No changes required; creamy, tangy, and spot-on for "classic" coleslaw.

This was just OK, certainly not what I wanted in a classic coleslaw. Way too much vinegar taste, even after I added extra sugar. I did let it sit overnight, and still the vinegar was overwhelming, I added sour cream, and I'm going to have to figure out some way to salvage the rest of this slaw because it makes a lot, and I hate wasting ingredients. Funny, because I love vinegar, but this...this was too much. If you are looking for a vinegar slaw, OK, but if you are looking for that classic creamy-sweet-vinegar slaw, this is not it.

I rushed and made this 30 min before dinner. I could tell the flavor combination was delish- but I should have made it 1 day in advance to let them really soak in.

Awesome, but my tweak was to halve the mayo and make it up by using non-fat greek yogurt, just as creamy with half the fat (from 50g for the recipe to 25g). My husband didn't notice the difference at all.

This is a great cole slaw. I use rice vinegar rather than white vinegar. It must be made a day ahead in order for the flavors to marry.This is the only slaw that I am allowed to make in my house.

Okay, I thought that this was amazing and I even forgot to put in the vinegar! (just realized that as I was writing this)

The best ever!!!

OK, at first I tasted the dressing and thought "Holy Hell! This is incredibly salty." I added a ton of sugar to balance, but it actually came out tasting great once I added the cabbage and it had some time to wilt/marry. Maybe cabbage is like potato and can take a lot of salt? Anyway, it came out great, even without the celery seeds.

I made this without the celery seeds and everyone asked for the recipe. It is a very easy and tasty dressing.

Best creamy slaw dressing ever. I prefer vinegar/oil slaw dressing but my family insisted I make a creamy version for a grad party. I might like this even better!
