In honor of Julia Child's 100th birthday, I decided to make this on a workday, even though I knew it would take quite a few steps. It was worth it... I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the rosemary and creme fraiche (I forgot to buy at store) I have a Blendtec blender so after blending, I didn't have any chunks. We ate everything. That made it very hearty and thick. I added the cooked corn, bacon and onion and it was amazing. Served it with a light salad of greens and veggies from my garden. It was lovely.

I won't rate this because I made changes. I was trying to find a recipe that most resembled the amazing cold corn soup I had at PB Boulangerie Bistro on Cape Cod. This recipe was my starting point and it turned out great! I added less water, a bit of cream, and no thyme or rosemary to interfere with that pure corn taste. I didn't try the garnish. Delicious!

I would give the recipe 3 1/2 stars if I could. I was looking for a recipe that would really showcase the fresh local corn I bought. The soup ended up really good, but I think for what I was looking for, it's a bit too much. If you have fresh corn, you don't need all of these ingredients. I left out the rosemary entirely and lightened up on the thyme and still felt the thyme was quite strong. Also left out the celery and carrot because I forgot them. Next time I will use the milk/cob method but forget the rest. It does also make a very thin soup if you strain it (and I used an extra cob of corn) so I may not strain it next time. Overall, my dinner guests really enjoyed it and requested more garnish (subbed chives for green onion in that).

Very Good. I made pretty close to the recipe but like all cooks we swing with what's in the fridge. I don't buy whole milk so made with 2% and 1/2 and 1/2 as I generally like a thicker soup. I normally would not strain as I like soup to be full bodied. But with the addition of the 1/2 and 1/2, I did strain and eeven thinned a bit with chicken stock. Very excellent. I am fortunate to live in Brwentwood CA where we grow white sweet corn and our local grocery stores carry it all summer.\ Enjoy!

I don't think I can rate this due to my number of changes but if I could I'd give it 3 forks. My changes: I skipped the garnish completely, used only a half of one spring of rosemary (thanks to other reviewers' suggestions!), used 1% milk instead of whole, subbed chicken stock for 1.5 cups of the milk, pureed only half of the vegetables, and did not do any straining. Despite all my changes, I think it still resembles the original in some respects! The many vegetable flavors were quite nice. Next time I'm going to throw in some small cubes of tofu, but otherwise I'm sticking with my alterations!

I love this soup, I made it last year and seeing corn at the farmers market today reminded me of this recipe. I'm making it tonight for dinner!

I made the soup without the bacon (veggie) and it was amazing. I just got some new corn and am going to make it again for guests. For the garnish and to add some color and flavor, I soaked some dried lobster mushrooms, used the stock in the soup, and then diced the mushrooms and served them on top along with an orange edible nasturtium blossom. It looked great.

After reading other reviews of this recipe, I doubled everything but the water and left out the rosemary... Delicious! I served it alongside a Fried Green Tomato BLT. My guests loved it.

I also thought this soup was better the next day. I would leave out one of the roesmary sprigs next time. Mine seemed a little thin and I was expecting a thicker version.

altered the recipe and made it into more of a chowder. used 1% milk and added about 2 cups of diced red potatoes. pureed half the soup and didn't bother straining. wonderful!

This soup was so much better the second day I decided to make it again. This time I used 2/3-2% milk, 1/3 half and half. I left out the rosemary and kept about 1/3 of the solids out of the puree process, then added them back in with the bacon. It made the soup more hearty and filling but had that beautiful corn flavor. The end result was another fork!

This soup was smooth (not velvety) and nice, just not the best corn soup I've had. The rosemary was too much for an otherwise delicate soup. Next time I'll leave it out and add dungeness crab to the garnish.

Smoothly elegant and full of flavor. Extracts every last bit of sweetness from the corn. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used chives in the garnish instead of green onions. In my opinion, the creme fraiche was unnecessary, as it was already velvety smooth and rich. This soup must be strained. While I love a great corn chowder and was worried about the lack of solids, the result was lovely. As a variation for the garnish, this soup might work very well with some Mexican accents. Next time!

Tasty, but a little bit too much work for the end result.

YUM!!! I love this soup. It has really great flavor and it's creamy...can't believe it's only milk - tastes like cream. For the reviewer that didn't think it had enough flavor in the end -- it's called "season to taste". You have to add salt & pepper after you puree to bring the flavors to life. I loved having a big bowl of this for lunch with a nice salad. Definitely a keeper - I will make every summer with corn from the farmstand.

Ooh lovely! A classic summer dish that focuses on a few key ingredients. Felt earthy and wholesome although it was a bit watery. I skipped the garnish at the end b/c I ran out of time - I bet it would have been even better with bacon and creme fraiche!

This recipe lacks the real, deep corn flavor that it needs to live up to its name. I used reduced-fat milk, which perhaps was a mistake. I'll find a way to salvage it, but I won't make it again.

I made this recipe exactly per the directions - except one extra ear of corn. I would not make it again. One person had 2 spoons and the others said it was not "make it again."

Pretty easy to put together and with farmers market corn, it was delish. I used 50% whole milk and 50% fat free milk and it was pleasantly creamy without being too rich. I also drizzled a drop of white truffle oil on top for an indulgent added depth of flavor. Next time, I'd make a bouquet garni with some cheesecloth to facilitate getting the herbs out.

This was just okay for me. With all of the wonderful herbs and fresh corn, I expected it to have a lot more flavor than what it actually did. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written but think it definitely needs some salt to pull the flavors from the herbs--I did salt the onions as the reciped recommends. I doubt I will make it again.

Great flavor - many steps but worth it in the end. Will make one change - fry bacon first, then saute veggies in same pan. I got wonderful flavor depth with that addition. Even my mother-in- law liked it!

Pretty good. Very easy to make.

I made this for my elderly parents, and they really enjoyed it. Lovely flavor, though there are a lot of steps to this. I pretty much followed the recipe except: I used a teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme; I did not strain the soup, choosing to keep the puree; I used a dollop of reduced-fat sour cream instead of creme fraiche, I couldn't find it. I think the soup would have been fine had I strained it, but it seems to have more body using the puree. Definitely top off with bacon and green onions and some fresh corn.

it was a bit too rich and sweet for my taste. If I make it next time, I'll try the yellow corn variety instead of the white as it's less sweet and maybe low fat milk as opposed to full fat.

Absolutely delicious! Very elegant and rich tasting. Next time, I'll remove half of the carrots before I puree the soup for a better presentation (the color was a little too orangey for my taste).

So good -- the flavors are amazing! This is a great light first course. Will definitely make again.

This is a recipe that I have earmarked to try as soon as our local corn is available. Would love to make it and freeze for winter - would appreciate any feedback as to how you all think it would hold up after freezing for a period of time. Thanks!

I made this for the first time last weekend. The smell of the fresh corn and milk simmering together is almost as good as this sweet tasting dream soup. Family raved. Sorry for getting a tad corny there, folks (pun intended).
