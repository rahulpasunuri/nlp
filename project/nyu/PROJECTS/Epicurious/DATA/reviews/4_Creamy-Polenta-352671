I made this on Christmas paired with Brasato Barolo and roasted cauliflower. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again, it was so easy! I found the polenta cooked faster than the recommended 18 minutes. I also added a little bit more milk, 1 tablespoon butter, 1/3 cup parmesan, and a little bit of white truffle oil. I then topped with sauteed mushrooms. It was delicious.

Delicious and so easy. Cooks in less time than sn stated. I cubed up some provolone and tossed in at the last moment. Wonderful

This was so easy. It does cook up faster than it says, about 5-10 mins. I added a tsp of black truffle oil, 1 tbsp butter, and some sauteed shitake mushrooms. It was divine. Will definitely make again!

Remember those old "Stove Top Stuffing instead of potatoes" ads? Well, my new mantra is the same, only I am replacing the potatoes with creamy polenta. This is so incredibly delicious that I will make this recipe again and again. One thing that the recipe does not say that I think is important is, "Serve at once." It will harden up if you let it sit.

Holy cow -- that's delicious! It tasted all buttery and creamy -- without butter! -- and I don't even like polenta that much. My partner said the same thing.

So tasty! At the end we added butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano and roasted garlic. It was like heaven.

Very simple and tasty. I added a bit more kosher salt to mine. It cooked faster than expected.

Good, fast, easy. Not sure why 'polenta' is characterized as 'American' though!

I've made polenta lots and this was a great recipe. I wasn't sure it would be all that interesting or flavorful with so few ingredients but it was fantastic! Served it with the beef braised in red wine which you can find on epicurious.

I'm very curious about Polenta. Not sure what to pair it with. Could you use it as if you would use mashed potato. Also, do you think you could make it with soy milk?

Yum! And easy! I made it with almond milk (not low fat). Hardly took any time at all, and was SO good served with the Beef Braised in Red Wine recipe here on epicurious. Enjoy!

Simple to prepare. I used FF milk and it worked just fine. I served it as an accompaniment to Braised Quail with Poblano Chiles, Saffron, and Chorizo.

My father's side of the family is Northern Italian, and my mother would often make this simple polenta. My father would go pheasant hunting and she's make a ragoût to pour over the polenta. She'd stand over the stove and stir for what seemed like forever. After she took the polenta out of the pot, she'd stir in 1-inch cubes of provolone and press it into a buttered loaf pan until it firmed up, then removed it to a cutting board and slice it with string. Then a couple hours after, we'd chip off the dried cornmeal of out the pot she used, munching on the pieces. This is truly comfort food for me.

This is the first-ever polenta I have made. I made it with yellow corn meal. I'm amazed how easy it was. I cooked it for half the time, stirring continuously with a whisk. The only thing I would do differently is to add more salt, probably right before serving. I think that you can also season this dish with different herbs/spices to add flavor dimensions to a dish, e.g. garlic or rosemary. Haven't tried, but I think it would work

Call it Poloenta if you want, but I grew up eating this as did my boys and they were always called Grits.
