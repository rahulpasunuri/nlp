Looking for a way to use quince this morning and discovered this recipe in my copy of Deborah Madison's cookbook, my favorite cook book! We grow apples, a friend gave me some quince and I'm always looking for ways to use fresh fruits to share with our CSA members. This is quick and easy, I used no sugar, added pears because we had some over ripe ones that needed to be used. And I used a foley food mill I've used for 40 years.

I made apple-quince sauce yesterday, before I found this recipe. I used about 2/3 quinces and 1/3 apples. It turned out really good! Quinces are tart and have a more complex flavor than apples, sort of honey-spice. I didn't add sugar, but I like tart things. Also, I cooked the fruit in apple juice, rather than in water. To the previous reviewers: A quince looks a bit like an apple but with a bump on the top, rather than round. It is covered with fur, and is hard and inedible raw. A food mill is shaped like a saucepan, but the bottom has holes, like a sieve, and there is a part that you turn which smooshes the food through the holes. I have one, but haven't tried it yet. I decided the peels in the sauce were tender enough to eat. Yes, the idea is that it will get out the peels and seeds.

What is a quince?

What is a food mill? Does it eliminate the peel and pips?
