Everything was fine and good with this. I'm just not excited enough about it to make it again.

The taste on these burgers was great. didn't give them four stars because of the problem with holding together. I will be adding some egg and oats,next time,for binder as suggested. i love the Asian flavors so I did up the amounts on ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil. I am just trying out tofu on my husband who was a bit resistant to the idea, and he thought this recipe was a keeper.

loved the recipe, but added quite a few things that made it more zesty! try adding sauteed onions, carrots, garlic, and chopped chick peas, and mashing the tofu with 1 sweet potato. Adding the egg whites and bread crumbs is a must, and add some grey poupon to the soy sauce mix.

Tried it and liked it but it was somewhat bland. My partner has a gluten and dairy allery so we used rice flower and two egg whites as a binder. We broiled the burgers which worked well and they held together beautifully. We decided to top them with roasted peppers, carmilized onions and a roasted potobello drizzled in blasamic. Tasty but the toppings should maybe have more of an asian flair. Next time we plan to add a slaw and some 5 spice to the burger mix. Stay tuned for the results.

Very good tofu recipe, but I will say like others... Add a bit of bread crumbs or oats and an extra egg white!!!

I would never cook this recipe with non-stick spray. Just use oil. It helps the burgers to stay together and it tastes better. I used canola oil. Also I coated the prepared burgers in cormeal before I fried them. They did not fall apart and it also added an extra flavor. Defnitely use 2 egg whites.

Great ingredients, but the recipe does need tweaking. I made this for 2 and still used the ingredients as given, for 4 servings, after reading comments. I used an extra egg white and bread crumbs to binde and left it in the fridge, even then it was delicate. Great with a Peanut Sauce dressing... or Wasabi Sauce/Mayo maybe?

These were okay. I followed the recipe to the letter until I reached the point of placing them in the skillet. As other reviewers stated, they were very crumbly. It took quite a bit of dry breadcrumbs to get them to hold their shape, but even that didn't work so well. The taste was good, but not so fantastic that I'd make them again.

My husband liked these, but I found that they required too much doctoring to result in any flavor at all. Also added an egg and bread crumbs, worchestershire sauce (my standby cure-all for blandness). The ginger flavor, which I was really looking forward to, was completely lost--and not due to the worchestershire! At least it was "healthy".

Made a few modifications added an extra tsp of seasame seeds, an extra clove of garlic, an extra egg white, some oatbran to bind it together better, and a dash of nutmeg. These burgers were fabulous. Can't wait to make them again.

Nice taste, but draining any excess liquid is a must. I enjoyed it, but you really have to be careful when making this!

After readng other reviews I used two whole eggs and a scant 1/2 cup finely ground oats; the burgers held together beautifully when sauteed. I did think that they were a little bland so then served them with hot chinese mustard and a generous squeeze of fresh lime. Much better, served warm over salad dressed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Based on prior comments, I added an extra egg (with yolk) and some bread crumbs. The burgers held together quite easily. While this lowered the healthiness a bit, the dish was absolutely delicious. I should doubled the recipe quanity for my two teenagers.

We loved this! Just make sure to use a food processor to really grind the almonds and also to really smooth out the tofu. I added bread crumbs and an extra egg. Served on a bed of brown rice, a side of iceberg Lettuce and tomato and then everything topped with Carrot Ginger Dressing (recipe also found on 'Epicurious'), it was an absolutely great meal!

This is a good recipe, but it needs a bit of tweaking in terms of getting the mixture to hold together. Bread crumbs or oats are essential. Add small amounts gradually until the mixture balls easily and seems relatively firm. Another method which usually guarantees whole burgers is to bake them. Lightly coat the burgers in olive oil (pure, not virgin) and place on a cookie sheet in a 350-375* oven. Turn the burgers when toasty/golden, and cook further. About ten minutes per side should be okay, but, since ovens and personal tastes vary, it is a good idea to keep an eye on them, checking often.

I think I will continue to buy my tofu burgers. These just didn't hold together. I added another egg white which didn't work. It was more like scrambled tofu, which was nice tasting but not the point!

I agree with most of the previous reviewers who had problems getting their burgers to hold together. Mine fell apart completely even though I cooked them in a skillet. But despite that, I did enjoy the flavor (I left out the ginger due to personal preference and doubled the sesame seeds). Next time I make these (and there will be a next time!) I'll try adding some bread crumbs to give it more binding power. Other than that, a great recipe!

i haven't made this yet but plan to tonight! to keep burgers together I usually use oatmeal that I have ground in a mini processor.

Crumbly, but tasty. Good even off the bun!

For the cook in San Diego...I saw the cook that suggested bread crumbs and an extra white. That sounded good to me too. If you don't have a problem with eggs, try a whole one and then my thought, and to add flavor, is to finely crush some sesame stix and add them. I often use them in my Baba Ganouche as well.

The flavor of these burgers is wonderful, and they're not difficult to make whatsoever. To make the burgers stick together, I also added an extra egg white, as well as a tablespoon of cornstarch. The carrots I used were really juicy, so I pressed them dry and used about a 1/4 cup extra. And definitely do not try grilling. They don't even work on a George Foreman grill.

I love tofu so naturally I had to try this recipe. Heeding the advice of other reviewers about the crumbly nature of the burgers, I added 2 tablespoons of unseasoned cry bread crumbs and an extra egg white. I made up the mixture in the morning, covered it, and shaped the paties in the evening. I think the "wait" helped the burgers hold together. Used whole wheat bread from a local Berkeley Bakery instead of the bun. Very good!

Everyone else is absolutely right.these are sooo good!! Just one question - does anyone have a suggestion to keep them from crumbling apart??

Rating: 4
I must admit we didn't follow this to the letter. Instead of green onions, a med. onion(about 3/4c.).A little extra ginger. Two cloves of garlic. 3/4c. of almonds. 2 eggs. and a bit of hot sauce. My meat lover loved it, but he likes tofu too.

It might have made a good tofu scramble, but did not hold together at all for burgers.

i have never had, much less made, tofu burgers. i served them to people who swear they dont like tofu, and it was a hit! they were not difficult, either. this is one of the tastiest recipes i have made yet! take all the tips offered by other reviewers!

Great recipe, but opted to pan fry than to grill. They were a tad crumbly and didn't want them to fall apart on the grill.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added an additional egg white as well as a touch of oats. It definitely helped to keep the burger together. I also added an extra garlic clove and other seasonings for more flavor. I would make these again.

I have just started eating tofu, and this recipe is amazing. I thought the patties were very crumbly so I added 1-2 eggs. I think it would also taste nice with a slice of sharp cheese.

Rating: 3
Very nice, but ingredients don't stick together very well. More egg? Some flour?

Rating: 3
Everyone loved the burgers. One tip I strongly recomend is to make them with a cuisinart. It makes mashing the tofu a lot easier. You MUST also add some ground up oats. It really helps to keep then from falling apart. If you don't they fall apart like scrambled eggs.

CAUTION: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GRILL It's like grilling scrambled eggs. Fortunately, I anticipated the disaster and only attempted to grill one sacrificial burger. (Don't know if it was me or the recipe.) The overall flavor was very good. The ginger really comes through. I served it with an Asian spinach salad.
