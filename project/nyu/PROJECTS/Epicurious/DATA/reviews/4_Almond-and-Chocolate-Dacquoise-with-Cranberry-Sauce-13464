Have made this several times since it first was published. The dacquoise is beautiful, festive and unique, delicious, and a light finish for a heavy holiday meal. Wonderfully complementary flavors and textures.

I love this dessert! I have made it many times over the years always to rave reviews. Most guests are usually wowed by the chocolate leaves. The sugared cranberries look beautiful. I follow directions to the T and am never dissapointed. It even tastes fabulous the next day. This will remain a staple in my entertaining category! Now I'm really craving this...

I made this cake for the first time for a group of 12. I increased the ingredients by about 50% of the original recipe. As noted by a previous reviewer noted the baking time is long. I decreased it to 30 min. I added candied orange peel in between the layers that added some additional flavour. I didn't use the chocolate leaves instead I made with semisweet cocoa powder a lattice garnished with rasberries and I skipped the sauce. I got great compliments including from a chef who is trustee at the Culinary Institute of America. This recipe definitely is winner and I'll make it again.

I've made this dessert several times-it's always a crowd pleaser. It looks fantastic, and tastes great too. You need to start in advance, but there isn't that much time spent preparing the dessert, compared to all the rave reviews it has received. In response to the other cook, if you chill the dessert for at least 8 hours, it shouldn't crumble when you cut it. Also, I didn't need as much chocolate as recommended for the leaves, but I didn't have any trouble with breakage. I used lemon leaves and they came off very easily.

Really delicious, and not difficult, except for the @#*& chocolate leaves. And very rich -- it should easily serve 10. Everyone raved, though I thought the meringues were overcooked, as the whole thing crumbled in the cutting. I would next time cook the meringues for less time or at lower temp. I checked other sources -- one had baking time of 30 mins, the other had 1 hr but temp of 275. And on the leaves, you can do 20 leaves (necessary to accommodate breakage) with half the chocolate.
