The recipe is good though the nectarines had little flavor. I grated a little fresh ginger into them to give them a little extra zip. Didn't see the photo when I made it but did anyone notice they rolled out their biscuits and did not peel the nectarines? Hmmmm...

One of my favorite late summer desserts. I've even used nectarines that are a little past prime with great success. The shortcakes are excellent with an excellent rise and just enough ginger. I have never included the sour cream topping, but generally just use whipped cream sweetened with a bit more crystallized ginger.

The nectarines were wonderful. The biscuits are more work than my usual shortcake recipe and not significantly better or more interesting.

Followed the recipe to the letter and my guests really enjoyed this! Note: best to buy the nectarines a few days in advance since most markets sell nectarines when they're not-quite-ripe.
