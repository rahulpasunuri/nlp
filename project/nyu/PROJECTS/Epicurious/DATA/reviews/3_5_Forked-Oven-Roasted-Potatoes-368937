Wow, these are amazing!! Mine cooked in under an hour, with three turns. Yum! I can't wait to make these for company!

i boiled with skins on, which made them easier to peel. after i peeled each one, i ran the fork over them. instead of oil, i used duck fat. delicious, but of course everything is delicious with duck fat.

Foe sure it takes time to peel all those little potatoes,but is well worth the effort. Maybe next time I will look for potatoes that are just slightly larger.

Question: Is there a simple way to peel all those teeny weeny potatoes? Don't know why someone would call this recipe Quick!

Tried them the other night. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Will be making them for Christmas wih the stuffed rib eye roast.

This is a basic recipe. Try adding whole garlic cloves (not boiled!), wedges of red onion and 200 g of crumbled, and add pre-fried, crumbled pancetta at the end. A masterpiece!
