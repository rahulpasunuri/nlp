I made this for a cooking kitchen competition. I picked this recipe because we had to incorporate the key ingredient of apricots. Not really being a fan of apricots, this recipe was perfect in the fact that the main flavor is rosemary, which I love! Turns out, we won the competition with this recipe. Recipe is easy to make, but you may need an extra set of hands to stuff the hens. I didn't have watercress, so I used arugula....perfection. The sauce is a must and don't forget to add the pan drippings to it. The sauce, hens, and arugula was beautiful when assembled all together.

I thought this was good, no 'wow' factor. I did use butter and didn't make any changes to the recipe for the game hens. I did change the mayo 'sauce' recipe and used homemade kumquat chutney in place of apricot jam. I added more than 1/4 C pan drippings to the mayo mixture to get a thinner consistency. Served with Ginger Rice and Beet & Carrot slaw, both recipes from this site.

I took the advise of one the reviewers and cut the Cornish game hems in half, removing the backbone, prior to cooking which made serving fast and easy. This recipe is fantastic! I was a little apprehensive of the mayonnaise with apricot preserves but it was delicious. I used finely chopped raw bacon removing most of the fat for the butter mixture and cooked the remaining chopped bacon for the sauce in place of the prosciutto. The meat was so tender and flavorful and my husband and guests loved it. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for my inlaws when it first came out and have been making it ever since. Butter and fresh rosemary are essential.

I loved this recipe! The flavors were fantastic. It is a little heavier (butter, mayo etc.) than I normally like to use, but it was worth it!

Tasty and the accompanying sauce perfect. Husband served with wild rice & sauted fresh spinach and a nice riesling. I agree that real butter is necessary to obtaining the good flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes and the flavors go together nicely. Yummy and the rosemary is fantastic. My husband always begs me to make it.I did not know that it was from Bon Appetit until today. I originally just found it from some other internet source.

This is a recipe I made a lot when it first came out. My in-laws and other company really enjoyed it. Real butter must be used and good quality mustard. The tastes blend well together. I split each hen in half, then put the stuffing under the skin. This cut the cooking time quite a bit and made serving easier. I am planning to make it this Sunday again, now that I have found it on this site.

It was good, but not great. It may be that I used margarine and not as much as recomended.

We decided to make this dish for a New Year's Eve dinner. It was absolutely fabulous. Great layers of flavor using the dijon mustard, apricot fruit preserves and rosemary. Very nice texture in foods as well. I highly recommend this recipe.
