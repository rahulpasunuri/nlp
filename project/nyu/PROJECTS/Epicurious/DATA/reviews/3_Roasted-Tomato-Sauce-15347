A very good basic recipe. I used yellow tomatoes from my garden, shallots instead of onions and doubled the garlic. Didn't use the broth as it was a good consistency already.

Sorry to also disagree with the other reviewers. This is a wonderful sauce and compliments the chile rellenos perfectly. I used home grown tomatoes and sweet onions. I did add extra garlic and also drizzeled some olive oil over all before roasting. I slid the peels off the tomato before pureeing. I loved the FRESH flavors of this sauce. I will be finding other ways of using this. We dipped toasted french bread in the leftovers. YUM!

BLAH! I ended up using another sauce for my chile rellenos because this would have ruined it. No flavor other than tomato. Needed WAY more garlic and onion, and would have benefitted from charring the tomatoes and adding some cumin.

This is NOT the way Mexicans make roasted tomato sauce for chiles rellenos! Either in the broiler or directly on a gas burner, char the tomatoes until blackened. Peel, allowing some of the charred skin to remain. I've also had good results with Muir Glen's Fire Roasted Tomatoes when my fresh tomatoes aren't ripe enough. If you like, toast the onion, garlic (at least 2 cloves) and green chile (I don't put chile in my tomato sauce, since I'm serving it OVER chiles), on a griddle or ungreased saute pan until browned. Liquefy the tomatoes and other vegetables (I also use a pinch of cumin, couple sprigs of cilantro, fresh thyme and bay leaf) in a blender. Heat a little oil or butter in a frying pan and FRY the sauce for about 5 minutes (a splatter screen is helpful for this or resolve to clean the stovetop, cause if you don't fry it, it's NOT the same!). Thin the sauce to taste with chicken broth, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. (Variation: Omit the bay leaf and add a 1 inch piece of Ceylonese cinnamon and 2 cloves when liquefying, very traditionally Mexican as well.)

This was not at all what I was expecting. It tasted awful - sorry to disagree with the other reviewers. I would not say these were roasted vegetables, more like boiled in the oven. The predominant flavour was raw onion with a hint of jalapeno. Never again.

This was amazing ... both for the great taste and the insanely easy method. Thanks to Justin from Little Rhody for the tip to add more garlic. I used 4 big cloves and about 5 tomatoes. I did not peel the garlic or cut it up. After it was cooked, I just squeezed it out of the skin and put it into the food processor. The tomato flavor was so intense and delish, that I didn't even miss the dried oregano that I forgot to put in. We used this sauce to top chili rellenos. After you try this, you will want to put it on everything. I think it would go great with grilled shrimp on pasta.

I used a slight modification. MORE GARLIC and a little more onion
