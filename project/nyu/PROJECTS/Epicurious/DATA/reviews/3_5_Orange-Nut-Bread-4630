I used only 3/4 cup of sugar, and as liquid only fresh juice (instead of O.J. and water). It is very good.

I thought this wasn't too sweet and had a nice orangey flavor. I also used fresh O.J.rather than concentrate and I actually added a couple tablespoons of triple sec. Why not? It's a nice sweet bread that goes well with coffee.

It turned out very well and was even better the next day. I decided it was a bit heavy so I made a slit in the middle and added some bourbon to it and then the flavor was much better. I also just used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of concentrate. Great for tea time or breakfast or dessert. All purpose!

ew I ruined the recipe. I used a bit too much zest so I think that is why the cake turned out so nasty. Use the zest sparingly , or not at all. Perhaps it was a good recipe before I altered it.

Delicious! I used 3/4 c. squeezed juice instead of concentrate and water (you need 1 1/2 Oranges to do so). Also I used zest from 1/2 orange (more than the recipe calls for) and it turned out with a strong orange taste and it is fab! Did not include the nuts. The house will be filled with a sweet smell after making this recipe as the recipe is very sweet tasting. Perfect for a breakfast bread or an after dinner treat! I will be sharing this with friends and adding to my permanent recipe box.

nice cake-like bread, and buttering the pan gives the crust a little bit of a caramel-ly flavor

this doubles very well. Iserved it with an orange zested butter.

Very good, with a light taste. I substituted regular OJ for the concentrate and water, so it was probably a little less orange-y. Served it toasted and spread with cream cheese. Yum!

The bread tasted excellent and is very easy to make. I added bits and pieces of 1 orange too and this made it tastier and very fresh. Also made muffins with the same recipe.
