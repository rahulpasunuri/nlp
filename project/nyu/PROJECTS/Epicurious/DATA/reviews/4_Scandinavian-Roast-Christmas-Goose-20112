This was my first attempt at a Swedish recipe Christmas Day Goose. From a preparation standpoint, it was reasonably successful. Only one of our nine guests had ever before dined on goose, but all expressed their enjoyment. The meat is similar to turkey dark meat, but with a more subtle flavor and a firmer texture. Think "delicacy" --definitely not "gamey" and not at all greasy if you use a rack that keeps it off the bottom of the roaster. Traditional American turkey dinner preparation skills will transfer to this experience, but goose is really a "different animal" and makes places different demands on the chef, such as fat siphoning. One very noticeable difference between turkey and goose is the size of the body cavity. With a goose, it is more like a cavern. Our dinner donor weighed in fully dressed at 9.77 pounds (small by turkey standards)--nonetheless, our guy accepted almost FIVE cups of traditional Swedish stuffing comprised of green apple, bosc pear, and plumped prune. Unlike the relatively airy bread stuffing (which also affects cooking time), the fruit dressing is quite dense and very moist. As with turkey, one key variable affecting cooking time is, of course, whether or not the bird is stuffed, with a stuffed bird taking longer to cook. Bottom line: the 2 to 2.5 hour cooking time for this guy extended to a little over four hours. The recommendation? If you are adventurous enough to do a first-time new dish when you are also entertaining, consider preparing the dressing outside the bird. Your inner time manager will thank you.

Great recipe. Worked out very well for our Christmas dinner this year. Simple and VERY tasty! It was my first goose and will definitely be making it again in the future!

I oooked this goose for my Danish friends despite the fact that I hadn't cooked a goose in about 20 years. Much to my delight and surprise, it was a hit! The goose was anything but greasy. I did add basting sauce at the very end but, as I discovered I really didn't need to. And since these particular Danes love to use the goose fat as a spread, the only thing left were the bones!

Looking forward to trying this one (I've been thinking about goose for Christmas dinner). I've always done duck for smaller family celebrations, and never had to boil it, but also never basted. I'm intrigued by the addition of basting. To the cook who feels that duck/goose must be boiled first, please try roasting with a very high start temp, rather than boiling. It's fantastic! Also, please keep the tone pleasant and constructive. This site is intended for all us cooks to help each other, not become rude.

Cook in SF...did you even make this wonderful scandinavian treat or did you just add your opinion without trying it? This was just the way my Sweedish granny used to make goose. Not greasy at all. fantastic.

This sounds like a terrific recipe! I have cooked many a duck, and in my experience, this recipe would be delicious. The addition of water with the basting, would give a nicely crisped texture to the bird. Sounds wonderful. Thanks epicurious, once again!
