Absolutely delicious. Made this with red snapper fillets, and unfortunately my hubby forgot to put the white wine in but it was still fabulous!! The Mojo Verde was wonderful- super easy to make and added so much flavor!

2.5 forks. I significantly altered this, based on what I had on hand, but the base recipe is still quite good, hence my review. I used two flounder filets instead of a whole fish and about half a pint of halved assorted cherry tomatoes instead of the salsa verde (which I didn't have on hand). After caramelizing the onions on the stovetop, I added in thin-sliced potatoes to begin to brown and soften, before adding the whole thing to the foil pack. I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes. The flavors were delightful, but despite the precooking of the potatoes and their thin slicing, they were still underdone; next time i'll boil them 'til soft first. A great mixing of flavors, and next time I have salsa verde on hand I'll try this again.

Made this with a pompano and yucca instead of potatoes (boiled the yucca ahead of time to make sure it was cooked through), and it was really good... but not quite great. The fish and yucca were good, but the rest of the veggies were bland. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps adding some lemon slices, raw onions, and garlic in the foil with the fish would help. Or anyhow, that's probably what I'll try next time. As per the previous reviewer's comment about the gills: I'm not sure what they mean by "pectoral gills," but I'm assuming they mean plain old gills. I think it probably has something to do with the presentation, as gills are blood-filled and would probably turn brown while cooking. It might also add a fishy flavor to the potatoes, but I'm just speculating. When I serve "whole" fish, I cut off the head and gut the fish. You still get the flavor from the bones without the fish staring at you when you're eating it.

Excellent with any kind of fish!!!

With a very fresh just over five pound American red snapper in hand we had our fishmonger scale and prepare this fish for our family to take home and find a recipe for that evenings dinner. This recipe more than filled the bill, as we all agreed this was one of the best fish dinners we have ever had and to have prepared it ourselves with fresh ingredients from the area made this meal and the memories all the more special. The Mojo Verde Sauce was superb. Having only one poblano pepper we added two large jalapeno peppers which worked fine. The serving dish at the end of the meal was testimony by itself of how the four of us felt about this meal. The earlier review by a chef from California was not even close to our experience with this wonderful recipe.

Delicious! My son (11) and I made this together and it is very easy. I used fillets and added a little zucchini with the potatoes, which I stuck in the oven while I roasted the peppers for the Mojo Verde, to be sure they would get cooked through, since the fillets don't take as long. As a working mom I am always looking for easy, quick recipes. The fillets made this more possible with my busy evening. I have to say, the onions definitely make the meal!

I was utterly disappointed with this recipe. Everything tasted great before it went into the foil and the oven. Once cooked, the onions had lost all their sweetness, the Mojo Verde all its lemony tang. The fish and the entire dish had a singular blandness. Luckily the fresh Mojo Verde added something, but you may as well just eat that with a spoon and skip the rest.

I made this with a whole 4 1/2 pound red snapper. It fed six adults who raved over it. The whole fish makes quite a presentation. I cooked it on a gas grill over medium heat for an hour. The only variation I made from the recipe was that I microwaved the potatoes for a few minutes to make sure they'd get done, since I had more than one layer of them. Does anyone know why the recipe says to have the pectoral gills removed? I had them removed, but it made it more difficult to fillet the fish.Still, I highly recommend using a whole fish. The bones impart flavor that you won't get with fillet and your guests will ooh and aah.

I have done this twice.......both times with canned chopped tomatoes instead of fresh, and filets instead of whole fish. Still haven't made the Mojo Verde sauce (didn't have the time) but will next time. This is a fabulous, delicious and easy recipe! My guests loved it and had seconds, and the leftovers microwaved nicely for dinner the next evening! Go for it!

Outstanding! I didn't use a whole fish or potatoes, though. I've made this twice now, and I think my variation is just right. For each serving I stack in a baking dish: a tablespoon of white wine, a half-pound firm white fish fillet, s&p, 2-3 tablespoons of his mojo verde, two slices tomato, sauteed red onion from 1/2 red onion. Bake 15 - 20 minutes at 400 degrees. The stacked portions are then are individual servings and you don't have to deal with the whole fish. Cheap tilapia fillets are great, so is expensive halibut. There's enough flavor from the preparation that you could use cheap, flavorless fish.

Great dish- loved by all, including my 12 & 16yr olds. Could only get snapper fillets & wanted to bbq. I pre-cooked pototoes in microwave & left foil open on fish while grilling. I cooked till taters were browned, approx 30 min.

I have made this dish twice for company and everyone loved it. I used red snapper filets instead of the whole fish, but did make my own Mojo Verde. It was a bit of work, but worth it. The flavors are so interesting, and work so well with the onions, tomatoes and potatoes.

This was very yummy. Other than the mojo verde, this was a simple recipe. So I cheated. I used canned salsa verde. I live in Mexico, so its easy to find salsa verde. I don't know how easy it is to find in the US

This went together very easily and the whole fish made a dramatic presentation. The flavors were wonderful, and we particularly liked the mojo verde that accompanied. BUT, serving whole fish is a tad trickier than we like so while we would make this again, we'll take the lazy way out and use filets the next time.
