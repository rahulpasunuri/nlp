This was a big hit in our family! Made two pizzas and added chicken (left-over chicken breast) to one. Both pizzas (with and without chicken) were delicious with perfect crusts. Used two garlic cloves on both pizzas instead of one. Will definitely make again :)

I tried this recipe using a purchased pesto and we grilled instead of baked. It was very tasty, but it was way too oily. The purchased pesto is pretty oily compared to the smaller amount of oil called for in this pesto recipe. I will try it again though, maybe use a smaller amount of the purchased stuff and blot off more oil off of the sundried tomatoes. Or, I guess I could quit being so lazy and make my own pesto!!!!!

not a bad pesto, I added pine nuts and it tasted more original...plus the recipe needs more garlic.
