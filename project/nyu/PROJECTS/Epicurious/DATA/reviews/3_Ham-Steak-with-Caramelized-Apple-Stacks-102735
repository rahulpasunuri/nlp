I didn't make the sauce, but the ham slices with the apple slices sauteed in butter was delicious. I'm looking forward to trying it with the sauce, but in the meantime, it's a quick tasty dinner.

This is the most delicious dish I've had a long time. I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted applesauce, 1/4 onion, and spicy brown mustard then servced it over brown basmati rice. It was fabulous! I'm anxious to try the recipe as written. I'll bet it's even better.

I made it for a qick dinner. It was easy and taste good. It was a good change from ham and eggs when we are in a hurry or don't know what else to do with ham steak.

I didn't care for the sauce at all. The ham-apple combo was delicious on it's own, though. I'll make just that without the sauce next time.

Carole from Rhode Island- The apple slices on top of each ham was delicious. I did not slice ham in quarters but in half. After reducing juice, etc.by half, I found it to be a little too thick. Sauce was sweet. I would make this again but just with the apples slices between ham. The apples gave the ham a good flavor after being in the oven @250 for about l0 min.
