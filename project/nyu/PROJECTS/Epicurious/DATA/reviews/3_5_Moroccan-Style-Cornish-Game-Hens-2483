I thought this recipe had a lot of flavor but must admit I substituted parsley for the cilantro and did not make the sauce at the end. I felt for our family there was plenty of sauce from cooking and the hens were moist. But if I make it for company, I would definitely finish it off with the sauce. I also felt this recipe was very similar to ones found for chicken.

This dish had great flavor. The olives and dates provided nice contrast. I served it with curry cous cous and a Greek salad.

Made this with roasted curried cauliflower and loved it. Living in the country, one has to improvise: Raisins instead of dates; red wine not port; mixed olives, but all pickled; no cilantro, didn't miss it; marinated for 8 hours, still great. Next time I'll probably use more readily available chicken breasts.

A very tasty sweet and savory dish. I followed this recipe exactly and loved it! Served it over basmati rice. If you're having a dinner party this is perfect. Prepare a day before and then pop it in the oven gives you time to enjoy more of your guests

I put split hens and marinade in zip lock bag and let "work" overnight in the frig. Served over safron rice. Everyone asked for seconds. Interesting and delicious.

Excellant blend of unique flavors make this dish very complex and delicious. Make sure to let the dish marinate plenty-to let the flavors set up. I serve it with Basimati rice.
