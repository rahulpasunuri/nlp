I made this dish for a Sunday meal and it was wonderful. We enjoyed the tenderness and the juices that the meat excelled. The favor was very good and it wasn't that much work. The browning didn't take long and I allowed it to cook until it was medium rare. It was very, very good. It's a dish I remember my grandmother making when I was growing up. Thank you for refreshing my taste buds.

As in the other reviews, the cooking time was not long enough. We compensated by slicing desired thickness for each guest and finishing off on the grill. It was incredibly tender and delicious. My guests were still talking about it the next day!

Absolutely fabulous! there were not even table scraps. The meat turned out so tender, and the combination with the browned garlic is sensational. Garlic lovers: brown more garlic! We, too, left it on low heat for the last step, but I think the trick is a heavier pan. We used calphalon, but we're getting a le Creuset or Emil Henri. We think it will build and hold the heat better.

MMMM. We loved the recipe. We had to cook it a little longer but it was worth the wait. I finally cooked a juicy roast.

The cooking/resting time is nowhere near adequate. After the 20-minute rest, the internal temp was barely 100F. Had to finish off in the oven for 20 minutes. Very tasty, but not worth the labor-intensive preparation.

It was wonderful. I've prepared it twice now, using very ordinary cuts of beef. Since I don't own a heavy pan, I kept the pan on low heat for step three. I tip my hat to Aunt Enza!
