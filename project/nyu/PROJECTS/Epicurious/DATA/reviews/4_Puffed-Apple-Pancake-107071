This is a little bland for our taste. I probably won't try it again, but if I did, I'd put some cinnamon sugar in with the apples to amp up their flavor a little.

This is an awesome recipe. I made a few changes, though. I used Granny Smith instead of Golden Delicious apples; I prefer their tart-sweet taste. Also, the Granny Smith apples balance out the sugar in the batter and the brown sugar on top of the dish. And, I used a double-handled 12-inch nonstick pan instead of a 13 x 9 baking dish. The dish turned out perfectly!

Way, way too "eggy." "Apple omelet" is more like it, not an apple pancake. It did puff up but once served the texture was heavy and unappealing. I don't like apples in my frittata, hence I will not be making this one again.

Rating: 4
Was afraid it would be too "eggy" but it was not--great texture. Used combo of gala and granny smith apples (2 each) , skim milk and 3 tbsp of butter. Forgot the brown sugar (accidentally) and served with maple syrup and roasted walnuts. Did not miss the brown sugar (though I will try it next time) and no problems with using fat free milk and reducing the butter. Fed three people generously, but too good for 4. Will go into regular Sunday morning rotation.

This was delicious and easy to make with basic ingredients. It was quite impressive when it came out of the oven but, as previous reviewers said, it sunk right in immediately. I think like others said, perhaps more apple would be nicer because only 2 get lost in such a big dish. I'll make it again.

Rating: 3
I liked the apples. Mine floated on the top as soon as I poured the batter on so they came out slightly burned and caramelised smelling of butter. I'm not very keen on that type of texture so that's the minus point there. It was very easy and quick to make. Maybe I'll give it a try one day, I've got vanilla ice-cream, too... Just, maybe...

I made this for my sweetheart and I for breakfast this morning. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added an extra apple, extra egg, pinch of cardamom and nutmeg, and 1/8th tsp. of baking powder. I also used Sugar in the Raw, since it's the only type of sugar we keep. The "pancake" puffed beautifully - and fell almost immediately after out of the oven. It was a delightful change from our regular pancakes. I think next time I'll add toasted pecans or sprinkle pecans across the top of the batter.

Yummy & easy & fast to make! This is going into our weekend breakfast rotation. Got two thumbs up from my husband & my 5-year-old.

I have made this recipe about 4-5 times now. I have just made it for two brunches that I had to attend. I wrapped it in foil and a blanket and off we went. It tasted just as good as straight out of the oven. I eat it plain without any additional sweeteners...VERY YUMMY! I ate the left over pieces cold the next day. It was very delicious.

I just made this recipe for the second time and accidentally forgot to add the whole milk, it had already been in the oven for a few minutes but I took it out and added the milk and stirred with the fork as an experiment. And it turned out really good! It did not puff like the original recipe, but it was a nice crispy texture. I made a second batch the correct way just to compare and my guests preferred the crispy "experiment"

AMAZING!!! Looks and tastes great. A very easy dish too, great for having people over for brunch because you can just pop it in the oven, easier than making regular pancakes. I didn't have milk and used soy milk and it turned out fine. Also I only had one apple and it was just fine, but I bet 2 apples would be even better.

Delicous! Great for apple season in WI! The recipe in magazine called for a glass pie dish. I used a deep dish pie plate. I cooked my apples a little longer than 5 min. We made for breakfast but would also make a great dessert. Tastes like crepes!

I made this adding an additional egg and substituted Granny Smith apples. I sprinkled a tiny bit of brown sugar on the apples before slipping them into the oven to prebake with the butter. I loved the tartness the apples added and I didn't find the recipe too sweet, at all. (Did not add syrup.) Someone told me the secret in getting a proper puff is to have the baking dish hot before adding the egg mixture. Just a suggestion for those who complained about it not puffing enough. And yes, it does deflate after being taken out of the oven for a bit, but didn't affect the flavor at all. LOVED this recipe!

Rating: 4
This is a nice company breakfast because you don't have to fuss over it while it's baking in the oven. It was so good that the recipe served only 3 (not 4 as indicated). As suggested by others, it was good to serve this with fresh lemon juice squeezed over top. Also serve with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla yogurt, and maple syrup (optional). Yum!

Rating: 4
This is the BEST breakfast I have ever eaten in my whole life. I added an extra egg as recommended by reviewers, and used ambrosia apples. I also used up the rest of our 1/2 and 1/2. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. It says it serves 4, but could technically serve a lot more. My husband and I ate the whole thing between the two of us!

I have been making this fabulous "pancake" since the receipe came out in 2004. It is a staple for my twin daughters (17 now) whenever their father goes out of town.

This was really simple to make, looked so gorgeous coming out of the oven, and tasted amazing. I cut down the butter to 2 T. and used 2% milk to reduce the fat content, and it was still super tasty.

I liked this, but didn't love the texture. I sauted my apples with cinammon and nutmeg, and then sprinkled with half the brown sugar and some chopped pecans before adding the batter right to the frying pan. It did puff up like a souffle, but the texture was too heavy for my taste. Maybe that's the way baked pancakes are supposed to be, so I should probably stick to making a lighter version on the stovetop.

This was very nice and got rave reviews. From the other reviews which said it was too sweet, I cut back the sugar, but the next time I will not.

I was concerned because several reviews suggested the pancake was eggy. I had to make the recipe for 5 people, so i increased most things by 50% and the flour by one-third. I baked the pancakes in two round ceramic cake pans. They turned out beautifully and not eggy at all. I agree, a bit less butter. I also used less sugar in the pancakes and then sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over them when they came out of the oven. Served them with moscarpone cheese. Delicious!

A quick recipe. To speed things up, I dealt with the butter and apples first, then prepared the batter while the apples were in the oven. It could do with more cinnamon and less butter -- it was a tad too rich.

This dish is very similar to what is served at the Original Pancake House chain (of which the Walker Bros operations in the Chicago area are the best). Rather than use a baking pan, I used a 10 inch skillet (similar to what they use at Walker Bros). I sprinkled the apples with 1 tsp of additional cinnamon while they were cooking in the butter before adding the batter (again in the spirit of what is made at Walker Bros). After initially making the recipe as directed (it was excellent but overly rich for my tastes), I substituted skim milk for the whole milk and cut the butter in 1/2. An 1/8 tsp of baking powder helped lighten the batter.

Wonderful! Light and tasty. I used a bit less salt than called for and a bit more cinnamon, and 1/3 C brown sugar before baking. Sprinkled a little powdered sugar on before serving (though it was sweet enough without that -- more for the look). The results were fantastic -- people practically inhaled this. Like others, the centre was not as puffed as the outside -- I might try baking it a few minutes longer next time, but these sorts of pancakes are always more puffed on the outside edges than in the middle, so it didn't seem that weird to me... Will definitely make again.

Now I can make this anytime a craving sets in. It's such an impressive dish that your family will adore it!! It's amazing what you can create through Bon Appetit!!!!!

I used clam juice instead of milk, peaches instead of eggs, and white wine instead of vanilla. Just kidding. I always feel strange reviewing a recipe when I didn't actually do the recipe as written. So... I did a healthy version with skim milk, wheat flour, about half of the butter and a mix of one Gala and one Golden Delicious apples as that was what was on hand. The result was still wonderful. I'm not sure how puffed the pancakes normally get. These were about an inch high, but absolutely delicious and very well received. Will definitely make again.

I found this recipe here over a year ago and have made it a minimum of a dozen times since then...always goes over great! It's not the prettiest as the outer edge always puffs more than the rest of it.. but powder sugar it and walla!

Served with the cinnamon butter from another recipe and that really made it. Like other raters, mine came out puffed on the edges, doughy in the middle. But I will definitely give it another try.

I made this twice, to the letter. But not again! Each time it came out with the edges puffed up, the layer remained pretty flat - because of the apples I guess - and the dough remained pretty soggy, though baked through on the bottom.

Great puffed pancakes! It tastes like a cross between a pancake and a light bread pudding. I halved the recipe for two with no problems (using an 8x8 pyrex). Also, I cut down on amount of both brown and white sugar (after halving it for the recipe), and it was just the perfect amount of sweet served with syrup on the side. My husband loved it.

I made this a few days ago and it was one of the best puffed pancakes I've eaten. I halved the butter, used two Fuji apples, doubled the cinnamon, and used 2 Tbsps. of sugar. I didn't add the powdered or brown sugar but served with a little maple syrup and chicken apple sausage. It was rich and delicious--and smelled divine. The leftovers weren't bad, either.

I make this recipe almost every weekend. It is even better when I make it with 4 apples, I usually use 1 fuji apple, and 3 granny smiths. It is good even without the powdered sugar, but I like to use maple syrup. This is a pancake that just is warm, and lights up your morning. We usually finish the whole thing when we eat it for breakfast, the four of us. I make it for my family and everyone loves it. Rave reviews by all!

This is a fantastic recipe - very simple and quick, and an excellent alternative to standard breakfast pancakes. I have made this twice, and both times I followed the recipe as written and actually didn't find it too sweet at all - though I agree it doesn't need the maple syrup. I think you could even use this is as a simple dessert if you dressed it up with a caramel sauce or a rum sauce (the spiced rum sauce that goes with the bread pudding recipe on this site would be amazing with this).

This was easy and delicious. I cut the recipe in half (to serve two) and I cut the amount of sugar as advised by other reviewers (one tablespoon of white and one tablespoon of the brown).

Very yummy! The apples floated to the top when I added the batter, but it was still very good! I might try a lower temp next time as the edges got very brown, almost burned, and the middle could have been a bit more done. I think it's just my oven, though. Very good. Family loved it.

Have made this dish a few times- the first time was in a dish that was too small (11 x 7 1/2 glass dish) and the pancake had a more bread pudding like texture. The next time it was cooked in a bit larger metal roasting pan, and this gave the pancake a more yorkshire pudding like texture (almost an outer crust with a light chewy inside). Both were just like cat food, delicious. I have also tried sprinkling some sharp cheddar on the top at the time it comes to sprinkle on the brown sugar. It was tasty, but would have been tasty without the cheese anyway!

What an excellent dish, as simple as it is delicious. I halved the recipe, making it in an 8 inch skillet, and following a previous reviewers suggestion, caramelized MacIntosh apples with the butter, sugar and cinnamon on top of the stove till tender, then dumped the batter over top and finished it off in the oven. Fabulous! I might reduce the sugar next time I make it, or forgo the drizzle of maple syrup I used in lieu of the powdered sugar - the combined sweetness was a little overpowering. Apart from that, it was perfect.

I made this dish in advance, and it came out looking fantastic. HOWEVER...when I went to serve it an hour later it was totally flat. It still tasted AMAZING and my family all raved about it. I think it is better served almost directly after being taken out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I halved the sugar requirement and used Macintoshes instead of goldens. It still tasted amazing. I was alarmed by the liquid texture of the batter- it was no thicker than the milk i poured into it! However it didn't make too much of a difference in the end- it still turned out awesome. Flour was very hard to get to smoothen in the liquid mixture- had to use an electric mixer. But the flour was really old too...so maybe that was it. This recipe was sooo easy, I couldn't believe how amazing it turned out

OH SO GOOD! I couldnt have used a more incorrect baking dish... I was using the 9x13 for something else, but I really wanted to make this anyway. I used a 2.5 quart baking dish, and didnt make any alterations to the recipe. (except i baked it for about 30 minutes.) Once its baked, it looks quite impressive, as it puffed up to almost 5 inches in this dish. Once it was almost done baking, I drizzled some maple syrup over the entire thing. That was a nice touch. MMMM! This recipe will be made again.

I made this for some friends visiting for the weekend last summer. Caught up in a conversation while preparing other dishes, I overcooked the apple pancake and blackened the bottom.

I made this for Christmas Brunch, along with a fruit salad and Chunky Two-Cheese Potatoes with Garlic and Pesto. I had to average the cooking temperature between the two and doubled the recipe for the apple pancake. Plus, I poured the batter in without pre-cooking the apples (oops!). Between the metal pan, the thicker pancake, and the lower temperature it took quite a bit longer to cook, but I didn't measure the time. I would make this recipe again, but wouldn't use golden delicious apples - pippins or another tart apple would be better. I left out both the brown sugar and the optional powdered sugar, and the dish was still too sweet. (We ate it all, anyway)

I've made this twice so far, and the flavor and presentation is delicious, but the texture is seems mushy (I even cooked the last one longer than the recipe specified). Am I doing something wrong? I'm expecting a lighter, pancake type texture, and I'm getting a pumpkim pie, bread pudding type texture. Next time I'll lower the heat and cook longer - any suggestions?

I used a large cast iron skillet to complete the entire recipe and it was a huge hit. I melted the butter on the stove and than sauted the apples and some brown sugar before pouring the batter over. I gave it a minute or two to brown and then finished it off in the oven

This recipe was just plain awesome. My husband, who doesn't like plain german pancakes, loved this recipe! I'll definitely keep making this.
