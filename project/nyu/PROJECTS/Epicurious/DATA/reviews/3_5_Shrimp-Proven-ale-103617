This dish is perfect for summer! I used ingredients from the farmers' market--it's a great way to use your basil. I added a few potatoes (boiled them separately). I say double it and invite some friends over.

This was one of the best dishes I have made from this website! Absolutely superb! The fennel seeds give it complexity, and the olives are a MUST. The only variation I used was adding about a cup of chopped zucchini that we had on hand and served over angel hair. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait to make again in the summer with fresh garden tomatoes and fresh thyme instead of dried.

Flavor packed! I used fresh plum tomatoes because I was making it for two and didn't want to open a whole can. A nice light dish.

Great stuff - the only change I made was to kick it up a notch with some cayenne & crushed chile pepper. The seafood hater had seconds! Very yummy. Absolutely will make this again... and again....!

My husband just happened to buy 2 pounds of fresh shrimp yesterday, so I looked for a quick and healthy recipe to use them in. I omitted the white wine and olives (just didn't have them on hand) and instead of regular diced tomatoes used stewed tomatoes with basil. And it was still delicious. Quick and amazing. My husband was very impressed, and so was I (and I don't usually like shrimp).

Not only was it delicious, but it's easy to make as well and healthy, since it's made with olive oil and not butter. It was extremely flavorful; I happen to love the flavor the kalamata olives and red peppers add to the sauce. I served it with a salad lightly dressed in a balsamic-dijon vinagrette. The meal was colorful and tasty. I will make this over and over again.

This was an easy and very good dinner. I agree with a previous reviewer that decreasing the amount of olives would help make the overall dish a bit better. Served over rice, with a salad. I don't really think it makes a full 6 servings (especially if this is all you are eating).

Great dish for family or company. Only change I make is heating it up a bit with red pepper flakes or hot oil.

Very good...however, the olives really dominate this dish and seem to drown out the flavor of the basil. Fortunately, I like olives. I added some extra wine to make more of a sauce, since I served it over rice. Also, I used precooked shrimp, added them at the end right before the basil and just let them warm through. Very tasty and quick weekday dinner.

I thought this was tasty, attractive and easy to make - although it had many ingredients. I think it is easily adapted for entertaining because the shrimp can be made ahead and just warmed with vegetables later. I added some canned anchovy and capers. It iw a keeper.

After reading the reviews I expected this to be something special. We kept salting the finished product, trying to bring up some flavor. It was just plain dull and a waste of innocent shrimp.

This recipe is so good, I fed four with the recipe for six and there were no leftovers. I tried it on toasted french bread -- really delicious.

Shrimp Provecale is my favorite meal to order if we are dining in a nice restaurant. I never thought that I could create it in my own kitchen...and with such ease! We omitted the olives and it was still just as tasty, if not better than what I've had at some restaurant's. The only suggestion I would make would be to prepare your shrimp either the night before or earlier in the day...it would have saved alot of time.

For a relatively easy recipe, the flavors were incredible. Will definitely add this to our repertoire of meals.

This is an excellent and very easy recipe. The blend of flavors is simply delicious. We have tried it with both shrimp and bay scallops and it is good either way. It is even quick enough for a weeknight meal.

I love this receipe and have made it several times. Its easy yet very delicious. Since I make it so often I use frozen cleaned shrimp instead of expensive time consuming fresh. When I have guests over I use fresh shrimp. Delicious !

I thought this dish was delicious! My picky family loved it as well, so I'll definitely make it again. I served it over plain white rice. The leftovers were yummy, too.

I almost didn't make this because the reviews weren't very great and I was looking for something a little special. Well, I'm glad I did make it - it was fantastic. I'd give it a 5 if the rating system allowed. I left out the olives and put fresh parmesan on it and the dish was perfect. Will definately make again.

I've made this twice now and it has been quite good both times. We seem to like the olives in Provencale style cooking. I followed the recipe except that I used both red and green peppers. It would be good with any shell fish.

I can't agree with the other 2 reviews. Not that it was all that much work but the results just weren't worth the effort. I also used fresh herbs from our my garden but it would need more than that to save this recipe. It's a real "Don't Bother".

Excellant- with a fresh garden salad and used fresh herbs from my garden. Served over basamati rice. Received rave reviews from my dinner guests.

This was excellent. My husband is allergic to shrimp so I used scallops instead of shrimp and I served it over angel hair pasta. Very, very good.
