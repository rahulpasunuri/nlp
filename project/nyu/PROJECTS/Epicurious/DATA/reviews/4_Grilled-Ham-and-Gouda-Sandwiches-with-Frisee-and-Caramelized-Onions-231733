Tried today and enjoyed it a lot. Used baby lettuces and smoked turkey but very similar.

I used gruyere instead of gouda, but this was excellent. Good, simple comfort food.

I used baby arugula and havarti. The wilted greens are what I think made these special. One large onion was barely enough. I would use 2 and be more generous next time. What's the fuss about 2 pans? I just carmelized the onions in a pan, and meanwhile heated the griddle. When they were ready I cooked them on the griddle (brushed the bread with melted butter and also brushed the griddle with it). I was able to cook 6 at once that way. It certainly wasn't low fat but probably didn't use quite so much butter that way. With tomato soup it made a great Christmas eve no-fuss meal.

Excellent! I used Taleggio instead of Gouda; I think is more flavorful. Used arugula instead of frisee and only added it after having grilled the sandwiches (so that the leaves would not become wilted). Caramelized onions are a must. I find it easier to roast them in the oven. I toss onion slices with some olive oil, salt and pepper (sometimes a little balsamic) and roast for about 25 minutes, stirring once or twice.

The best grilled cheese I've ever had. Used watercress instead of frisee and it was terrific.

My boyfriend made this for me and I feel in love, not with just the sandwich. Every bite was heaven, perfect balance between salty ham and sweet gouda.

I like to caramelize a few onions at a time to have in the fridge ready to use on what ever. This sandwich is a snap to put together that way. I feel like I've had a nice meal then instead of "just" a grilled cheese.

Simple yet delicous!

Very good. You can put caramelized onions on just about anything and it will be fabulous, as far as I'm concerned. My only changes were drizzling a little maple syrup into the caramelizing onions when they were nearly done, and leaving the greens on the side as a salad rather than incorporating them in the sandwich. Grilled sandwiches with lettuce in them always end up a bit slimy and stringy, and I much prefer having the greens separate and crisp.

Delicious, and so rich.Used honey mustard like another reviewer suggested. Did not use frisee. A keeper.

Very nice sandwich. I made with watercress instead of frisee lettuce. You could use arugula.

yummy - quick and easy meal.

Delicious; served to fussy eaters and they left not a crumb. I added honey mustard to the bread before cooking and I think it enhanced the taste.

It is a little messy but it was worth it. I also serve a picky eater who enjoyed it. I used French bread and served mini sandwiches with tomato soup. Very tasty.

Messy, but oh, so yummy. I used a vegetable peeler to slice the gouda thin and it melted nicely. My husband is a picky eater and LOVED this recipe. Thanks.

What a great dish. I follow the recipe to a "T" and it was fabulous! The caramelized onions really bring the sandwhich together nicely. Very easy dish to make. Don't leave out the onions!

Just like a grownup grilled cheese. The saltiness of the ham goes very nicely with the sweetness of the onions. Couldn't find frisee letuce (unusual for whole foods) but the sandwiches were tasty without.

This was such a simple, tasty recipe (although slicing smoked gouda is a bit of a pain). My husband asked for tomato instead of the onion, but I had both the tomato AND caramelized onion. YUM! The gouda didn't melt as much as I hoped, but I didn't want to take the chance of over-grilling the bread. Even so, the flavor was simple, despite so few ingredients.

I used leftover ham from Easter. I did not have the Frisee, but felt it was just as good without it. I think I will add perhaps a little mustard next time. I also used French Toast bread from Safeway. Wow, was it ever good!!

Nice change from the regular grilled cheese sandwiches. Easy to make.

This is not just a grilled cheese sandwich. This is a gourmet sandwich for the discriminating palate. I guess thats why we have Denny's and Morton's Steak House. Different taste for different people. Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!!! Definitely not for the Denny's customer.

These were amazing. I don't care how many pans it takes (I think I only used one). True the ingredients aren't cheap, but it's worth it. I'll make again soon!

It is great on a sandwich press! Forget the two pans.

Quite a taste change over a grilled cheese sandwich. The carmelized onions were a great addition. I even made one with regular sliced onions and it was tasty.

I really enjoyed this sandwich. I did sub the ham with turkey. The onions and the frisee give it a very nice flavor. I made these 2 nights in a row so the extra pan is not a big deal.

Two pans and 30 minutes to make a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches?! Sorry, but that's ridiculous.

These really were delicious. If the pocketbook and the waistline are not at issue these sandwiches were delicious. Can use almost any combination of good bread, ham, and cheese your prefer.
