This sauce was not delicious and the fact that it was going into everything- no good.

Excellent!! I made considerably more than the recipe was designed for - 20 ounces of fish - and scaled up accordingly. Instead of mahi mahi I just used tilapia. Mixed the sandwich bread crumbs with some panko and (perhaps critical) added a half of a red pepper, finely diced. Turned out AMAZING, so, so, so delicious. The sauce was fantastic on top, the cakes held together perfectly and with a little hot sauce it made for a restaurant-tasting meal in a really short period of time. DELISH!

Fishcakes are a New England old time favorite. Basically leftover fish and mashed potatos mixed together, made into cakes and fried on a griddle or cast iron skillet. Very good served with baked beans ... home made, not canned ... Having said that, I would not even think of trying this yuppie version of a staple that was able to stretch an old Yankee's budget.

Made this the other night and loved it, just logged on to add to recipe box. I normally am not a big mahi-mahi fan but these were delicious - heartier than a crab cake but not "fishy." Even with all that horseradish, the sauce it wasn't overpowering and the slaw was a perfect complement to the fish cakes. I used broccoli slaw as another reviewer suggested.

Well I made the fish cakes and used the salmon, as I couldn't get the fish in the recipe in Australia. it was the best. And will add it to my restaurant menu. easily fed for people.Our meals in Australia maybe smaller. Will use it as an entree at my restaurant. And serve with a med. salad, mixed lettuce, olives, feta, sundried tomatoes, red onions, cucumber, and caperberries. This one is winner.

Although I haven't made this recipe, as yet, I've read all feedback and wonder why people change the recipe before they have tasted it? I'm making it tomorrow and will use a different fish as I'm unfamiliar with the one listed, coming form Australia, I've never heard of it. I'll try salmon, which is my personal favourite.The dressing sounds amazing. I can't wait to give it a go. Cheers from Oz.

I will probably cook in butter instead of olive oil the next time around. Also a little less dill.

Well,not to brag,but I was the designated 'Chef' when invited to a friends cabin at Vallecito,Colorado(reservoir).I was 'given' Northern-Pike,and Salmon to "prepare".Why I remembered this recipe on a whim,could not tell ya'll, but all in all,the munchkins scarfed up the patties,adults loved my grilled filets-oh another recipe to come to you.Anyway,I Did make a Lot of the fish cakes,since there were tens of pounds of the salmon and Pike .Oh yeah,fresh lettuce was provided,and yes,a large kettle of Colorado Pinto beans,with a lot of bacon and spices too ! Rocky Mountain cooking ,well R O C K S !

This ended up to be a terrific meal. I only needed one lemon and used 18 ounces of canned wild alaskan salmon ($1.99 a can) instead of the fresh mahi-mahi. I did not process the salmon in the food processor (I have a lead foot on this), but added the flakes to the bread crumb mixture. Because I added more fish, I added 1 more slice of bread and 3 tablespoons of the sauce In addition, I used fresh grated horshradish and added a little of the left over rind to the fish cakes as well. Everyone raved about this, even my meat and potatoes 17-year old son. My 7 year old did eat the cakes without comment, but added ketchup which means they passed the test. I had two cakes left over, and there was a small skirmish in the kitchen between my husband and my teenage daughter on who was going to take them on a roll with the left over sauce for lunch. They will now be added on to my regular dinner list and I'm dreaming about what else I can add to the cakes for a different feel. I almost added a little jalapeno to the mixture and a dash of hot sauce along with the horshradish and mayo. Maybe even a little garganzola and/or a gently touch of raisins. Oh, the possibilities!

We really liked this, though apparently my brain was turned off when I was making it. I didn't have as many green onions as the recipe called for, so they all went into the sauce. I used a little more fish than called for after reading reviews. Otherwise, I also added S&P and coated in panko (though still used soft bread crumbs in the cakes). For the slaw I used a bag of broccoli slaw and added all the sauce (oops), instead of part sauce, part lemon juice. It was great that way, but the horseradish was a tiny overpowering. My husband loved it though. I think the coleslaw (minus a bit of horseradish) would be good enough to serve on its own.

WOW!!!! used tilapia instead of mahi mahi and it was AMAZING. I think I overdid the lemon somewhere, but other than that, this will become a regular in my house!

Loved it! Doubled the recipe to feed 4 and it was great. Rather than use sauce on the slaw, I used another slaw dressing and saved all the sauce to use on the fish cakes. Quite tasty - will make it again and again.

I used red snapper and dried dill, and chopped the fish by hand. I would use less lemon juice in the tartar sauce next time, as I thought it was too runny. I liked the horseradish. My husband ate two cakes, so I think it's a stretch to feed four. But it's definitely a keeper.

So I don't know if this is a fair review because I made some changes based on personal preference and lack of ingredients but my husband LOVED them after turning his nose to the idea of them. I didn't have lemon so I used fresh squeezed orange juice and left out the dill and horseradish because they aren't my families favorite ingredients. I also substituted cod for mahi mahi to save a little $. They are going to become a staple in our household... easy to prepare and delicious. We also served them with the sauce and coleslaw on a whole wheat bun.

I thought this dish was fair and slightly bland. The horseradish was the best part of the sauce. How can 8oz of fish feed 4 people? I used 1 lb and made one and a half times the sauce. Not sure what all the hoopla is about for this recipe.

Fantastic! I used salmon because I could not find fresh Mahi. Other than that I followed exactly as written. I will make this over and over again.

Really bland. Nothing too special. My husband and I were surprised by the blandness given all the good reviews. There are too many other great recipes out there to waist effort on this one.

This one is a winner! Couldn't find Mahi, used 12oz. of Barramundi and otherwise followed the recipe as written with great results. Enough for 4 people as a light meal, maybe add another side dish for heartier eaters. Would make a terrific sandwich!

I used pollock and subbed in cilantro for dill as another reviewer suggested. They came out nicely and were reviewed favorably by my family. I did not have pre-chopped slaw available to me, which required an extra step and made it a bit less week night friendly. I ended up with extra cakes as I doubled the recipe based on comments from readers. They made excellent fish cake sandwiches the following day, with the slaw on top. Fun concept - I'm glad I tried them.

I have never taken the time to review anything I have made from this website--probably because everything is always at least good, and generally fantastic. These fish cakes were dry and tasteless. I even added more sauce and mahi-mahi than the recipe called for and still found them tasteless. After one bite, my son who eats anything went to the fridge, searching for anything else to eat. There has to be better fish cake recipes out there!!!! totally disappointing

These were really tasty, but this amount would only feed two people. I made double the amount and two adults and one seven year old ate it all. The amount of sauce and coleslaw was plenty for our whole family. I subbed cilantro for the dill because I don't care for it. I will absolutely make this again.

Good Fish Cake, although it was not enough to feed 8 hungry poker guys. I made 3 batches and each one was was handily consumed! Cudos on this one. Jim and Poker Guys

Excellent, but a little bit of Old Bay seasoning helped. We are four in our family, and with the slaw and grated carrots, this was more than enough for us.

Very easy and tasty. There was no mahi-mahi at the store, so I used red snapper. I also substituted dried dill, and shredded a mix of savoy and red cabbage instead of using bagged coleslaw. I agree with other reviewers that this doesn't serve 4--my husband and I finished all the fish. Claiming that this serves 4 seems like sort of cheating in the context of the "affordable meals" article. The sauce was really great, and I like using the same sauce for the fish and the coleslaw.

Very tasty and easy. However, I agree with others that this is not enough for four. I used 12 oz of mahi-mahi, but kept same amount of other ingredients. The proportions seemed about right, and this was enough for two adults. I shredded half a head of savoy cabbage and some carrot rather than bagged mix - still very simple, but cheaper and probably tastier. Also, I used Hellman's Light Mayonnaise to cut calories. I found I needed extra olive oil to brown the cakes, but it was still much healthier than using regular mayo.

This was so good I made it twice already. Tried both mahi-mahi and salmon. I think mahi-mahi works best. There is plenty of sauce, so I doubled the amount used in the coleslaw. My slices of bread must be wimpy, because I didn't get nearly enough crumbs the first time. 160 grams of bread worked well for me the second time. This recipe may serve 4 as an appetizer but not as an entree. I paired it with a German Potato Salad and it made a terrific meal for two.

I made this dish with halibut filets and they were terrific. Also, I replaced the fresh dill with dried dill and it worked fine. The recipe makes four good sized cakes but my husband ate two. Consider doubling the recipe for four people. The sauce amount is plenty for a double recipe of cakes.

Made this last night on a whim. My friends and family were blown away. They loved it and had no idea it was both really inexpensive and really easy. I think it's also a great base recipe for fish cakes -- might make a mango salsa with it next time. Hmmm, the possibilities are endless...

Would definietly make this again. My husband and I love fish, but get a little bit tired of the standard filet with sauce preparation. This recipe was a great new way to get our seafood fix, and it was easier and tastier than I expected. I definietly agree with the reviewer that said getting four servings out of this is a stretch. The recipe figures 1 cake per person, which definietly was not enough for my husband, and I was left a bit hungry. Either double it for four people or serve with a heartier side than cole slaw.

I made this with tilapia because my grocery store didn't carry the mahi mahi. I also used wheat bread instead of white, and I didn't use any dill. It was tasty, but I was surprised that there was no salt and pepper in the fish cakes themselves, so next time I might add some. I don't think this recipe would serve four hungry adults...my husband and I finished it off.

This recipe is easy, inexpensive and awesome. Substituted talapia as the fish. Have used the dressing several times since as a dip.

My husband and I really enjoyed the fish cakes and sauce, not as good as crab cakes, but easier on the budget. Will make those again. However we both thought that the horseradish did not work with the coleslaw. Consequently I will just halve the sauce recipe.
