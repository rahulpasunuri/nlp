This was my first time using Jerusalem artichokes, and it was... nice. I added some dried sage (about 1/8 tsp.) to give it more flavor. A simple soup that was fine but not exciting. If I got sunchokes from the CSA again, I might use this recipe.

With so few ingredients, I did not expect this soup to have much flavor. I was completely wrong! It was incredible - and so easy and fast to make. I added ground sage to the bread cubes as they cooked. That added a nice contrasting flavor. Very good soup. I'll definitely make it again! A little advice: Select as smooth/non-knobby sunchokes as you can find. Peeling took the most amount of time for this recipe because I had rather bumpy and funky 'chokes.

Oh my goodness, this was so tasty! I substituted rice milk for skim, and thinned it with chicken broth at the end.

Superb flavours - a meal to die for. Unfortunately, the after effects nearly lost me my partner!

this soup was too sweet for my taste. the only parts that even made it palatable were the croutons and parsley

Made this for Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful. I used chicken stock instead of water, and strained the puree through a tamis before adjusting the consistency. Also added about a half teaspoon of white truffle oil, which was wonderful. Didn't notice the same after-effects that other people mentioned

Agree that it was delicious, but have been rather socially unacceptable ever since!

delicous soup but it created terrible flatulence. Far worse than any beans
