2 forks to the as-is recipe because it was a bit bland, as others have mentioned. However, I made a few tweaks the next time around and it was great: Sauteed onion and minced garlic first, then added the rest of the listed ingredients (except for the ginger and saffron). Used only 5 cups of broth. Added cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, tumeric, and fresh lemon juice. Lastly, used 1 can of pumpkin puree instead of whole pumpkin. Great soup in a pinch!

I had some coconut milk in the fridge, so I added a can and it was really good. Used vegetable broth instead of chicken.

Made it once as suggested and it was OK but really bland and a little time consuming. Made it again with some modification. Made a French Onion soup base, added lentils, rosemary, tyme and sage, cooked for 1/2 hour till lentils tender. Added some dried mushrooms to the onion soup base. Then put in a can of puree pumpkin, served with croutons on top. Got rave reviews from everyone that tried it. Also, al whole lot cheaper without the saffron that I couldn't taste in the soup anyway.

Wow. I cannot believe the high rating for this soup. I could tell it would be bland before I started making it, but no amount of doctoring could turn it into something edible. Roasted the pumpkin, sauteed onion, added I have used this website for years, but I registered for the first time today because this recipe was so bad I had to comment. Complete waste of time and ingredients.

A Cook from Pittsburgh: the source of your confusion is a result of the fact that no one who raved about this recipe actually made this recipe. For the millionth time, people, PLEASE review the recipe, not something that you made up that vaguely resembles the recipe. Having said that, I do think that some of the suggested modifications sound good, and I agree that something is lacking in the soup as the recipe is written. I added hot sauce to mine and it helped, but red pepper flakes or cayenne might have also worked. I'm also confused as to how the authors of this recipe thought that it was 'spicy.' I think that part of the problem is typical Self silliness. For example, why would you add onion to the liquid, as opposed to sauteing it a little bit to get some more flavor. If the recipe calls for adding oil to the recipe, anyway, why not add it there? I roasted my squash before adding it in an attempt to get more flavor, and I think that it probably helped. I'll most likely end up eating most of this soup, but next time that I want a squash soup, I'll use another recipe.

Even though I doubled the spices, this "spicy" soup was so boring I almost fell asleep tasting it! I should have known better - it's from SELF magazine, rather than one of the legitimate food magazines on this site, and though I LOVE ginger, cinnamon and saffron (what a waste of an expensive ingredient!), none of them exactly qualify as "spicy". There are so many better savory pumpkin soups and even traditional split pea soups on this site that you can make healthful without sacrificing taste. I'm just stunned that so many Epicurious users, whose tastes I normally trust, raved about this lumpy, bland pile of glop. If it weren't so ugly, I'd be tempted to bathe in it - it's warm, there's so much, and it's certainly soporific!

Have made this soup twice now, with slight variations and love it - has a rich and surprisingly creamy taste. First time, used a whole pumpkin - cut it in half, baked it and then scooped out the flesh rather than chopping up - easier in my opinion. Second time used a mix of canned pumpkin and frozen butternut squash - even easier, but tastier with fresh pumpkin. Other variations - Sauted onion and 2 chopped carrots in olive oil. Added broth (~8cups) and lentils (rather than split peas). Omitted saffron, but added 1/2 tsp curry powder and a dash of chile powder.

What a great way to use butternut squash. I used Moong dahl lentils and cooked in a crockpot overnight instead of a pressure cooker. I added an entire piece of fresh ginger, sliced, (about 4") and that made all the difference. I added 1 can of coconut milk with lots of chicken broth. I also added a whole cinnamon stick, indian spices like cumin, tumeric, paprika, and thai chilies (which really balanced out the sweet squash.) The key aromatic ingredient I used was several kaffir lime leaves. When I took it out of the crock and stirred, some of the pumkin mixed with the lentils, but I still had some chunky pieces. It was so aromatic, sweet, and spicy. Wow!

To Seawitch: You're right, you shouldn't review a recipe you didn't make!!!!

I don't know if I should write a review or make a new recipe. I actually took this recipe & saw another for pumpkin & took off from there. College Inn makes a broth with coconut, curry, Thai seasoning and vegetable broth - I used that & chicken broth and lentils instead of split peas. I used one person's suggestion of mashing the pumpkin, then I added the lentils & cooked till done. I don't keep dried ginger but used about a tsp of fresh ginger. I also played around with other spices - I added allspice instead of cinnamon. Wow!! This is great stuff!!

It's funny, the recipe that didn't quite do it for me caused me to write my first review... The cinnamon intrigued me, but ended up tasting weird. Good texture, but strange flavors.

Beautiful color and very tasty. I used canned pumpkin which worked fine and homemade chicken stock for deeper flavor. I only made half the recipe since I am the only one in my family who eats soup,

Nice, but didn't like the saffron.

I loved this. When just done, it was not that sweet, but after a time the sweetness of the pumpkin came out. I loved it as written, but my family does not really like winter squash recipes, and later my daughter did something with the leftovers that was inspired. She added lime juice and tandoori spice. Now THAT was spicy, and delicious. I loved it both ways!

Essentially a good soup, but I don't see why it is called "spicy". "Sweet" would be more appropriate. I'm not a big fan of sweet food, so I had to fix it with tons of salt, pepper and some hot sesame oil. Eventually it turned out great. Good thing I put half the cinnamon.

Fantastic! I added some leftover ham and used minced fresh ginger since I did not have powder on hand. Would definitely make again.

This dish was a very interesting and unexpected blend of flavors! I brought this to a potluck gathering, and it was very well-received. although I think it may have taken people by surprise initially, the pot was empty in no time. Make sure you use a sugar-pumpkin or butternut squash, not a halloween-type pumpkin. It took a lot longer for the lentils to cook than indicated by the recipe.

I used green split peas instead of yellow. The pumpkin flavor is subtle but nice. Also mashed the pumpkin cubes at the end of the cooking time. I used fresh sage instead of parsley b/c it seemed to go better with the pumpkin and spices. This is better the second day. Make it several hours ahead of time to let the flavors blend.
