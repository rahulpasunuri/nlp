Incredible! Made this for a dinner club tapas party. Looked all over Cleveland for the Serrano ham - finally found it at Gallucci's Italian Market - downtown on Euclid Ave. Great place! I served it over arugula - because I do not like escarole - and I presented it on a large platter layering the slices of serrano with the asparagus. A lovely dish - and delicious!

I made this as the second course for a Spanish tapas wine pairing dinner. However, I wrapped the Seranno ham around the asparagus and roasted it before plating atop the salad. The crumb topping is different, and most guests liked it.

The crumb-almond-cumin topping makes this simple salad exceptional. No serrano ham to be found in these parts, and not even prosciutto on the day I went to town, so pancetta stood in, fried crispy. I added Spanish artichoke hearts to the plate as well. A gorgeous, simple, unfussy salad that was beautiful on the plate as well as on the palate.

Delicious and elegant. It does make 6 large servings though.

This is really good and easy to put together. I've made it as a starter and as a main. I've also put it all on one big platter as another reviewer described, which is really attractive. This recipe is particularly nice because it combines the toasted cumin with the sherry vinegar--a really outstanding flavor combination.

I did this as a starter for a Spanish dinner party & it went down really well. Most of us agreed that it would be even better without the lettuce & with more serrano ham (yes, pricey - but worth it).

I tried this salad for a dinner for my husband's parents and it was a hit. Instead of preparing individual plates, I used one large platter which looked lovely on the center of the table.

This dish was great. I just have a couple notes to add. Each serving is very large. You could make a light dinner out of the salad alone. Also, I think the salad would be almost as good without the ham, or with a fraction of what they called for, if you are looking to save some money.

Absolutely terrific!

Really liked the combination of flavors this salad provided. The escarole and dressing are very bitter, but the asparagus and proscuitto do their part to offset that nicely. The almond/breadcrumb topping finished it with some crunch.

This is light, easy and one of the best salads I've had recently. We made it with prosciutto and drizzled it with lemon-infused olive oil. So good.

A delightful, quick, tasty meal. Combined with some good french bread and a nice saugivnon blanc it was a wonderful less than 30 minute meal. Used arugula instead of escorel and would put a bit more cumin in for taste. Defintely would do it again.
