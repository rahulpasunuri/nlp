A favorite for a weeknight meal! Like other reviewers, I also had burned juices when I used a baking sheet. I switched to a Pyrex baking dish, and finally was able to serve with the elusive crusty bread.

I hadn't really used fresh marjoram before this recipe. Now I grow it all over my yard because this recipe turned me onto it. I adore this recipe. I've used sundried tomatoes when I didn't have cherry tomatoes on hand.

this recipe is a hit with my 31 yr old son and my dinner guests. Very tasty. I season my chicken overnight (to infuse flavors) with chopped celery leaves, parsley, chives, thyme, minced garlic, a little blasamic vinegar or white wine vinegar, black pepper, and olive oil. To roast, I add thyme and basil to the marjoram - great flavor! I serve the dish with pasta, rice or asiago flavored baguette, and balsamic/flavored green beans with red bell pepers. Very simple and a huge hit with all!

Fast, easy & great flavor from all the garlic in the tomatoes. Didn't have marjoram so used combination of fresh rosemary, thyme, organeo, chives. Did sprinkle and rubbed in some of the herb mixture on the chicken to keep it from being bland. Will definitely make the 'tomato mixture' and use over pasta.

i was surprised how good this was, since chicken breast tends to be pretty dry, and it was basically just baked in the oven for half an hour. but it was really juicy and flavorful, and super duper easy to make! this will definitely become one of my new staples.

An all time favorite at my house. I wait for summer and make it with a mix of fresh garden tomatoes, which makes it all the more special. I slice heirlooms into wedges and mix with multi-colored cherry & grape tomatoes for a colorful presentation. I put a rub of coriander, cumin, salt and pepper on well trimmed chicken thighs since that is a family fav.

A no fuss crowd pleaser. I used quartered roma tomatoes, and next time I'd probably add multiple herbs, oregano, basil and marjoram. I had some ricotta which I tossed into the pasta at the last minute, for a creamy version. This recipe is a base for a multitude of variations!

Fantastic! Quick and easy to make since I have an abundance of marjoram. I added feta at the end and it was wonderful. I will make this a lot.

This was so easy, the chicken juicy, and the tomatoes so flavorful. Anyone know why my tomatoes didn't turn out more 'saucy?' I read all the reviews about sopping up the sauce with bread- but it seems all my juices just burned. Anyone out there have any thoughts?

Rating: 4
Loved this! Minor changes I made: Used fresh OREGANO b/c I couldn't find fresh marjoram -- oregano works great. Also, after removing chicken from the sauce @ the end, I PUREED all of the sauce/drippings in the food processor. My family doesn't like the texture of roasted tomato skin, and if this dish is served with just the tomatoes you miss out on all of the other flavors (garlic, pepper, etc). Yummy! Also, did not sprinkle the fresh herb on at the end - nice touch but can be left out if in a hurry.

this is such a wonderfully easy and absolutely delicious recipe. I make it all the time now that I know it. I recommend though that you keep it in the oven for 50 minutes to an hour. through. It nneeds that long for th echicken to be cooked. one of my favorite chicken dishes

Rating: 3
The chicken roasted at high temperature is very moist; the flavor was good, not outstanding (fairly plain flavor in spite of spreading a little bit of the oil/garlic/marjoram/pepper mixture on it for a couple hours before cooking). I used grape tomatoes which were a little on the harsh side; perhaps because it is winter and they are not in season? I have made another (similar) recipe from this website with tomatoes, chickpeas (garbanzo beans) with a cumin/garlic/cilantro seasoning which resulted in a similar very moist chicken with an outstanding flavor. My kids preferred this one (though they don't touch the tomatoes). I will try this again but will play around with seasonings and different tomatoes. I think the main highlight of this recipe is the high temperature roasting which keeps the breasts very moist and tender.

Another happy cook and husband. I used bone in thights with skin and an abundance of yellow and red cherry tomatoes from the back yard. Outstanding dish with sides of basamati and a loaf of bread. One of those dishes where you think, why didn't I think of this, it is so easy!

Rating: 3
I just LOVE this recipe because of it's simplicity. This time I used chicken thighs & prefer it to the breast meat. Also, because my garden is producing an abundance of the slender eggplants I cut those about 1/2-3/4" thickness & added them. I had to cook about 45+ min for thighs to be done. It is excellent served over brown rice. I'm printing it out now to send to my sister.

love this recipe. so simple, and quite tasty. sometimes use thighs and drumsticks and it works just as well. also, can add a can of italian stewed tomatoes and it makes a slightly more flavorful and tender chicken.

Rating: 4
This is unbelievably good for a recipe that could hardly be simpler. I used ingredients that I had on hand: boneless skinless chicken breasts, and Roma tomatoes. I cut the Roma's into large chunks to match the size of the cherry tomatoes called for. I had marjoram, which is how I found this recipe. I had bought it fresh for the first time ever for another recipe and had a lot of it left over so I searched the Web for other recipes to use it in. This is one of the two I decided to try. I'm certain other herbs would work fine, but the dish would be changed in character. The marjoram is just right for a subtle yet very delicious taste, and for what it's worth, will give the cook the satisfaction of a "secret ingredient" that I don't think many diners would be able to identify. I will absolutely make this dish again. I may change the chicken to bone in, or even to Cornish hens. I may change the Romas to cherry tomatoes, but I will not change the marjoram.

This is incredibly easy to make and delicious, too. I didn't have fresh marjoram, so used dried which worked fine. Chicken was moist with crispy skin and the tomatoes created a zingy sauce with a slight hint of sweetness. Accompanying Italian bread slices toasted with butter and grated parmesan were great for scooping up the last bits of tomato.

I LOVED this recipe. I've made it twice in two days. I used suggestions from others: oregano, shredded basil, halved pearl onions were scrumptious in this, too. We are shifting away from meat, so the first night I marinated some extra firm tofu slices in soy mixed with sesame oil and then baked them on the same baking sheet with the tomatoes. Served it all over couscous. Such a great way to flavor the tofu. Second night I sliced rounds of premade polenta and baked them in with the tomatoes--even better!

I really liked this recipe as well. I overcooked the chicken a little but I have to say the tomatoes with the marjoram and spice were SOOO good!

Made this with fresh yellow and red cherry tomatoes from the garden- it was delicious and made for a colorful presentation. The best part was sopping up the juices with bread- we had olive bread. Yum! I'll make this again.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I read through all the reviews and followed one reviewer's advice to use extra tomatoes ("they're the best part," the person wrote, and s/he was right) and to not overcrowd the pan. Someone else recommended cutting the tomatoes in half--which I did, though I left a couple handfuls whole. I used a whole chicken and butterflied it, so it lay flat in the pan. I used 1/3 cup olive oil, because I was concerned there wouldn't be enough pan juices. There was plenty, so I needn't have worried on that score. Next time, I'll use less oil, even 1/8 cup would do, without compromising the recipe. I used lots of oregano and thyme from my garden. I also used 3 pints of cherry tomatoes; 1 1/2 heaping crushed red pepper; and lots of coarsley ground black pepper and sea salt. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to encourage my tomatoes to carmelize. The tomatoes blistered beautifully. I forgot the garlic completely! Not only did this dish came together quickly, but it was really scrumptious. My partner thought it was good, but later changed her mind to "really delicious." We had it with steamed zuccini and green beans. I can't wait to make this chicken again, and next time I'll add lots of garlic.

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe, although I add more garlic and red pepper and double the oil to make more "juices" for the end. The last time I made it I threw in 3 fronds of rosemary as well and the flavors really complimented each other. I wind up with extra tomatoes left over, and extra juice, so I toss this with ziti or small pasta for leftover night. Wonderful! Will make it often. Be sure to use fresh herbs and have some good crusty bread on hand for the juice!

I loved this recipe! I used dried marjoram (only about 1T) since I couldn't find fresh, but it was still delicious. My husband loved it, and our friend who doesn't like tomatoes set them aside and loved it too. And the best part is that it's so easy!

Rating: 3
Simple dish with a nice spicy kick. The roasted tomatoes and bits of garlic are delightful. I took the advice of liberal salt, but went minimum on pepper since the crushed red pepper seemed enough. I served it with steamed haricot verte and a cucumber salad to cool the heat from the crushed red peppers. Summery dish, and the leftovers will be terrific diced into a salad.

This is such a perfect quick dish! I throw on 1 cup of feta during the last five minutes because my husband loves to eat anything with cheese on it :)

Delicious recipe which is quick and easy to prepare for company as well as any other time. The dish can be assembled ahead and put in the oven when the guests arrive. I substituted boneless breasts with the skin on. Our local market has a wonderful chicken called Smart Chicken which has been moist and juicy each time I've prepared it. I reduced the amount of red chili and garlic and cooked at 450 degrees for 20 minutes. If you can't find marjoram, oregano can be substituted. A real keeper!

I made this using roma tomatoes quarted, turned out very well. I did add a small red pepper slice thinly, both came out sweet and flavorful. I however did not think it was spicy. I served it with pasta and my husbands only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce for the pasta. Do not expect a sauce, just a great side vegetable. Will make again for company.

Rating: 4
One of my all-time favorite recipes. Ridiculously easy and incredibly delicious! Everyone I've made this for raves about it. Important notes from my experiences with it: use lots of extra tomatoes (double or triple, and increase the seasonings correspondingly)--they're the best part; use a pan big enough that it's not crowded, or the tomatoes won't caramelize, which is what makes them so scrumptious; don't use boneless/skinless chicken, or it'll be bland (and place chicken skin-side-up); using cut-up regular tomatoes makes it watery and bland (again, the caramelizing doesn't happen); be sure to spread garlic/marjoram/oil mixture over the surfaces of the chicken pieces before roasting. I usually toss the tomatoes and seasonings right in the roasting pan--less to clean up and no bits lost to the mixing bowl.

I loved this recipe. The balance of the floral taste of marjoram, the spicy heat of the chili peppers & the taste of garlic blend so well. I loved the combination.

We love this recipe!! As for "mega salt", it does state in the directions to "sprinkle generously with salt & pepper". I guess I pretty much know how much salt & pepper to use to satisfy me & my family & I season accordingly. No matter what the recipe says. Same with the red pepper flakes. This has been one of our favorites since it came out. A good crusty bread is wonderful to sop up all the juices! I often just use dried Italian seasoning.

As easy and flavorful as promised. I used home-grown roma tomatoes, quartered, and not quite as much red pepper as specified. Since the chicken is cooked at a high heat, it is very moist. I cooked five large boneless chicken breast halves and used two cookie sheets side by side in the oven. Use lots of tomatoes: you won't have leftovers.

I've made this dish twice and both times it was fantastic!! Very easy to make and the rewards are many. Because this is such a simple dish, it is necessary to use the best ingredients. If your tomatoes are only so-so, then the dish will be a flop. Flavorful fresh herbs are also a requirement. The flavors of dried herbs will not have time to develop because of the short cooking time at high heat. Use whatever fresh herbs you can find. I used a blend of marjoram, basil, tarragon, and thyme. Oregano is a good substiute for marjoram. I also used boneless chicken and cooked it for 30 minutes. So moist and the skin is a crispy, decadent bonus!! Crusty rolls or bread is a must to sop up the yummy sauce. I agree with the other cooks that this dish needs a lot of salt to bring all the flavors together. The second time I made this, I added more garlic, just lightly smashed. It gave more flavor, but was easy to remove since the pieces were big enough to find. Easy week night dinner.

Rating: 2
Like others, I wouldn't say this is the greatest dish in the world, but it is easy and very tasty. I used basil, since I couldn't get any fresh marjoram, and it was great. I found that it was best to cut the meat off the bones and then spoon the tomatoes and juices over the meat so the chicken could soak up the juices. My kids liked it, as well as my husband. That in itself is a reason to rejoice for me, and I will definitely be making this again.

My kids love this chicken! I used fresh basil instead of marjoram, which I couldn't find. My kids didn't like the tomatoes with the chicken, so I pureed the tomatoes and the juices with some more chicken broth, canned diced tomatoes and a little cream. The resulting tomato soup was a hit!

Talk about looking for trouble where none exists! This kind of lunatic attitude gives feminism a bad name. We both work outside the home and my husband does just as much of the cooking as I do. When he comes up with a great new dish, I often say "This is great! You can make this again any time" This is praise, not permission. That being said...neither of us was blown away by this recipe. It was incredibly quick and easy to make and tasted fine - I would definitely mke it again for those reasons. I guess I was just expecting something better after all the enthusiastic reviews. It just seemed to be lacking a certain something that I can't pinpoint.

Because I was feeding seven (three children and four adults), I stretched the tomato mixture a bit and added a few thighs for the kids.

Update: I made the tomatoes alone, used grape tomatoes and fresh basil (it's what I had) added vidalia onion, balsamic vinegar and cut the red pepper down to about 3/4 tsp (one family member's preference). Cooked for 25 minutes. Excellent. (PREVIOUS REVIEW:If it were possible I would give the chicken itself two forks, it was nothing special; however the tomatoes were really good (I added chopped onion and a dash of balsamic vinegar). In the future I will roast the tomatoes mixture itself in the oven and serve as side dish with my favorite marinated grilled chicken recipe.)

To the cook from Denver, I presume you used the crushed red pepper the recipe calls for, and not cayenne! Did you try cutting back on the amount of pepper when making it for your kids? That would be the simplest. Otherwise, check with your local spice purveyor (or if you don't have one in Denver, try Penzeys.com) to see if there is a milder crushed red pepper option that would maintain the flavor while diminishing the heat. Finally, I hope that your kids (and I realize I don't know their ages) were the ones who said it was too spicy, and not your own judgement. My kids (9 and 11) eat spicier foods than I do, with great relish. A big part of it is what they are exposed to and allowed to experience.

Used breasts and thighs and both came out juicy and the skin browned up nicely. I seasoned the meat with salt, peppa and chopped oregano before pouring the mixture over (which I also salted more than ordinary) and the sauce was yummy. I think salt is key here. I mashed the tomatoes a bit before serving and it made a great sauce, would go well on most any starch. Updated: In fact, the sauce was so damn yummy that I have adapted the recipe. I nixed the chicken and just roasted the tomatoes and added 1 cup of chicken broth and mashed a bit in a large soup bowl. Then, I added rosemary roasted potatoes and it's a really nice sort-of stew.

WOW! I almost didn't try this recipe because I don't like whole chix breast, only boneless. Well, I sure am glad I did because it was outstanding! The second time I made it I used a little more extra-virgin olive and and more garlic (chopped) so that there would be extra juices to soak up with bread. The tomatoes were awesome too, although I might try adding them in later in the cooking time too to see if they might be even better. I will absolutely make this often. Very easy and makes the kitchen smell like a fine restaurant. Now I have a reason to buy whole chicken breast!

I couldn't find fresh marjoram in any of the local markets, so I had to go with dried. I'm sure the fresh is better.

I made this using boneless, skinless breasts and thought it was good, but not wonderful. I plan to try it again but will use breast on the bone next time with skin to get the juicy and crispy effects that other reviewers raved about. I would also chop some plum tomatoes to add, rather than the cherry tomatoes as written. My husband wasn't crazy about their texture after being raosted. The marjoram really does provide great flavor and a change for our taste buds, as I tend to use rosemary or basil more often.

Made this last night and liked it a lot. The pan juices are incredible. I used skinless breasts on the bone and even without the skins it came out moist and tender. Will definitely make it again. A very appealing looking dish. If you're not that into spicy flavors I would reduce the amount of pepper flakes or substitute another spice such as cayenne pepper or perhaps a pepper sauce such as tobasco to taste to provide a more evenly distributed "warmth" to the finished product.

The only comment I have is that I thought the crushed peppers made it was a little too hot. Maybe I used too much. Does anyone know if you can sub just a pinch of cayenne instead? I like the fine texture of cayenne (for blending ingredients)--I just don't know if it will impart the same flavor.

A great recipe. I made it as directed and it was terrific and also easy to vary keeping the basic technique. If you think the marjoram version is good - wait til you try it with fresh rosemary.

I had to try this b/c of all the good reviews - but I must admit that I, too, was expecting just good roasted chicken....it was WAY better than good!!! My fresh majoram is looking a little sad this year, so I substituted with fresh basil and oregano. Excellent.

Wow, even after all the glowing reviews I was expecting "just another roasted chicken" recipe, but this was phenomenal. I followed the recipe for the most part, although I only used 2 chicken breasts and about 16oz of tomatoes, and added ~12oz of mushrooms. I also shoved some chopped marjoram under the skin. My only other variation was to deglaze the roasting pan with a bit of chicken stock (would've been white wine, damn Sunday blue laws) and reduced the sauce to about 2T before mounting it with a little pat of butter (not very healthy but damn tasty). Served over wilted baby spinich which had just enough bitterness to stand up to the sweetness of the tomatoes, with some roasted new potatoes and a loaf of crusty Italian bread. The chicken (Bell & Evans Farms) was crispy on the outside and incredibly moist inside. All in under an hour including prep time and for about $15. This is going into my regular dinner rotation. I'm stuffed and I'm still already thinking about how good my chicken+tomato+spinich+goat cheese sandwich is going to be tomorrow.

I couldn't find fresh marjoram, so I had to use dried. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as directed. It was very unremarkable and I would not make it again.

This was very tasty for a quick, come home after work throw together recipe. I added the mushrooms as another reviewer suggested and they were very good. And you are right about having that crusty bread to soak up the juices. Yummy!

Agree with all those who were pleased by the ease and tastiness of the recipe. I cooked the tomatoes as called for in the recipe and liked the more charred and sundried flavor. Sliced up the leftovers and used them plus left over tomatoes in a sandwich the next day. Still delicious!

It is very good, very easy and quick to cook it. I added a pinch of Mixed Italian Seasoning and Marjoran. Also I added a few drops of Soy Sauce. It is perfect whe you want to eat good and not spend to many time in kitchen

This checken turned out so marvellously tender and moist that it fell off the bones- a real plus fo me, as I get a bit squeamish with gristle. It produced a delicious gravy and went wonderfully with th tarragon-glazed carrot recipe also to be found on this website. As recommended by some other reviewers, Adding the tomatoes fifteen minutes before the end of cooking time resulted in an ideal texture and well as introducing some lovely charred smokiness to the garlicky, shmaltzy jus. I had to use fresh oregano rather than marjoram, as the market was out, but felt that the two were close enough in aroma and flavor not to detract from a fair review. These proportions can really be used with a variety of different flavors for a quick, delicious no-fuss meal. And my boyfriend, well, I think he liked it. Maybe. Just a little. ;)

I used chicken thighs as we prefer dark meat - it is more moist and more flavourful - great meal!

As has been noted, surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe. The chicken turned out very moist--a result of the cooking method? or of leaving the ribs in? In any case, our family loved it.

Fantastic recipe! So simple and so delicious. My market was also out of fresh marjoram, so I used about a 1 1/4 tsps of dried and this still tasted great. (I did skip the sprinkle of marjoram at the end). I took the advice below and used a glass baking dish, which came in really handy for scooping out all the juices at the end. 30 minutes and it was perfect. My hubby raved and ate up all the leftovers!

We really liked the suggestions from the cook in Chicago on 6/25/03. We did cut back on the amount of marjoram we sprinkled on the chicken at the end. I believe the boned chicken adds more flavor to the juice rather than using boneless chicken. Great dish with crusty bread and a nice glass of wine.

I really like this recipe. Simple and delicious! Local grocery didn't have fresh marjoram, so I had to bite the bullet and use dried. It was still wonderful. Also, as I was cooking, I noticed I had a 1/2 lb. of mushrooms that I needed to use, so I threw those in with the tomatoes. (So kill me, all you Epicurious recipe purists!) Hubby said I should've added more mushrooms. You've just got to love an easy, delicious chicken recipe, especially with the price of beef these days!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend this weekend and he couldn't stop raving about it! I substituted plenty of basil for the marjoram (only because I have never used it and didn't want to experiment on him!)and the result was tender, juicy, tasty and very easy on the eyes. A perfect summer recipe. I served it with a simple angel hair past with portabella, garlic, olive oil and parmesan....yummmmm!

I prepared this for dinner last night. It is a very easy and very good recipe. After reading all of the posted reviews, I made the following changes- Total cooking time was ~32min (chicken was cooked through and very juicy). I added ~1/2c white wine to the baking pan (I used a heavy stainless baking pan instead of a sheet). I decreased the red pepper to 1/2ts and I served it over a small grain pasta. Right before serving, I drizzled a bit of olive oil over the top of the dish. The pasta was "Pastanini" which was about 1gauge larger than couscous. WHEN I prepare this again, I will try it with onion and mushrooms. My wife suggested that I serve it over baby spinich- we both like tomatoes and spinich together- The resulting sauce is very good, while the garlic-marjaram crust over the chicken is flavorfull and surprisingly robust. Overall this one is a good addition to the recipe repetoire !

This is one of those dishes you love to make for company--zero prep. time except for the baking. And it turned out perfect--glorious red sauce, chicken crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. As for the tomatoes controversy (below), if you want them intact but warmed up, warm, whole tomatoes, bake them at the end, like the one cook below suggested. If you want a spicy, exotic red sauce with bits of tomato that are inconsistently leathery (not unlike sun-dried tomatoes, keep them in the pan the whole time. My guest assumed they were sun-dried tomatoes. I will make this again and again.

This is a very easy, very attractive, delicious recipe. The marjoram is fragrant and woody tasting, a nice complement to the chicken and tomatoes. The first time I made this recipe, it was quite good, but the tomatoes had turned to mush by the time the chicken was finished cooking. They tasted good, but they were more saucy than I wanted. The second time I made this recipe, I mixed the olive oil, marjoram, garlic, and red pepper flakes without the tomatoes. I brushed this mixture over the chicken and shoved some of the herbs under the skin. I cooked for 20 minutes, then I added the tomatoes, brushed them with the olive oil mixture, and cooked them for the last 15 minutes. Next time, I might cook them for even less time. A couple more notes: I used free-range, Amish chicken, which is very flavorful. Also, I used a glass baking dish instead of a metal baking sheet the second time I made this. I prefered this method, as it allowed the tomatoes to cook in the chicken drippings a bit. I roasted some red potatoes while the chicken was cooking, and they made a lovely accompaniment.

This dish was as easy and delicious as promised. I tossed in some thinly sliced leeks, which added a subtle complexity to the flavor. Perfect for a summer dinner on the patio.

I made this dish for two. It was easy to halve the recipe. I used skinless, on the bone, breasts and my only substitution was grape tomatoes because cherry tomatoes were not available that day. I made rice to go with this dish and a lovely green salad and crusty rolls. My husband thought it was really good but I am indifferent and could take it or leave it. I found the marjoram was just not to my taste. I do have to admit though that this dish is very attractive to look at and the tomatoes were delicious and not mushy. They retain a certain measure of firmness while the skin blisters and wrinkles. I cooked the chicken at 450 degrees in the centre of the oven for 40 minutes and it was perfectly cooked through and was juicy.

Rating: 3
Excellent- the tomatoes and marjoram are perfect together. I cut the recipe down to 1 serving and approximated ingredients- I might have put a bit too much oil in, but other than that, it behaved beautifully. On the suggestion of another reviewer, I left the skin on the chicken breast, and the result was incredibly tender & moist. Fast, easy, and very good!

I cooked this dish for 2 reasons - mainly because it looked REALLY delicious (and sounded so from the reviews) but also because I wanted to qualify as someone "worthy" enuff to have the sacred honour of putting such important words to the site. FIRST: this WAS superbly delicious, I too have not cooked with Marjoram alone before and was pleasantly surprised with the flavour. Everything put together complemented one another perfectly. I also roasted red potatoes, green & red pepper and carrots in a garlic/olive oil mix seasoned with Herbes de Provence and Seasoned Salt. YUM!! I might try thighs and legs next time. NOW: as for any and everyone posting opinions...SO WHAT! I read reviews for "opinions" and will form my own based on theirs and experience! I appreciated ALL reviews and chose to try this recipe because everyone either thought it good or confirmed it was...I think everyone should just RELAX and either cook or get off this site! Thanks to all who posted whether you cooked it or not...your input was spot on! Try this recipe! As for the one who started this argument...I did not see a review for this recipe in your snooty posting....looks like you fell victim to your own accusation!

THIS IS TO THE COOK FROM CALIFORNIA. I THINK ANY GOOD CHEF WOULD KNOW THAT 35 MINUTES FOR A WHOLE ROASTED CHICKEN IS WAY UNDER THE LIMIT OF COOKING TIME. IF YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE RECIPE HERE IT CALLS FOR CHICKEN BREAST NOT WHOLE CHICKEN. I WILL BE TRYING THIS CHICKEN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS CHICKEN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MEATS.

the marjoram/garlic/crashed red pepper olive oil was amazingly tasty and aromatic. this is my first time using marjoram. i agree with the other reviewers, its deep aroma is the key to this dish's success. i heaped fresh marjoram on the finished chicken - it was splendid. i am not a big fan of white meat, but it came out really juicy and the flavor penetrated into the chicken. i may still try chicken thighs next time though. i'd also make sure that there is skin on whichever part of the chicken you use - i think it'd help to preserve the moisture. 35 minutes was good baking time - but i think 30 minutes might have been even better. make sure you have some good country bread to wipe the sauce off your plate. very good.

To the Cook from Chicago - if you read my post correctly you will notice that my point was the same as yours.

When I look at a recipe, I put a lot of faith in the comments from people who have tried it. Lately, there seems to be more and more comments from people who say the recipe sounds good but who have not yet tried it. This defeats the whole purpose. I respectfully ask that people please not make a comment until they have tried the recipe. We can all determine for ourselves what sounds good after reading the ingredients - but I would much rather read a review from someone who has actually made the recipe, especially if I am considering it fo guests!! I am sure a lot of other subscribers feel the same way. Thanks for your consideration.

I was surprised by the bold flavor given the few ingredients and simple preparation. I think the few ingredients just complimented one another perfectly. I used grape tomatoes rather than cherry, because that is all the store had. I only used 3 cups, and chopped up some onion to make up the difference. I added a healthy splash of white wine to the mix, and topped it all off with a sprinkle of shredded romano cheese. The chicken turned out beautifully, with a crisp brown romano crust, and a juicy, mildly spicy sauce. I served the chicken atop a bed of pinenut couscous, spooned the tomatos and sauce on top and went to work. Lots of fun!

I used vine ripened cherry tomatoes and halved them. It was amazing, especially when I put it all over penne pasta! I cooked the chicken in a roasting bag, which I will still do next time because it came out so juicy, but I'll reduce the cooking time by 5-7 minutes.

Outstanding! Marjoram is a unique flavor and found it overpowering the first time I cooked it although everyone else was licking their plates. The second time I used half (fresh) and it was perfect for me! Easy and clean-up a breeze! To the cook for CA; you might be having a problem with your oven calibration? At 450 degrees 35 minutes is just right, I think. Just be sure to use the chicken breast halves and not a whole chicken.

I'm not a big fan of chicken but this recipe really hooked me. to cook from california, 35 minutes is quite enough for roasting CHICKEN BREAST HALVES, not a whole chicken.

Glorious! the fresh marjoram was a bit pungent so if you aren't too adventurous you could use a smaller amount of dried marjoram, a smaller amount of fresh marjoram or substitute fresh basil. My 16 yr old son was licking his plate. It was also supremely easy to make... very little prep and presto it was done...... and you look like a genius in the kitchen!

For a dish that was so simple to make, the flavor and presentation were outstanding. I used Empire Kosher chicken and kosher salt and the results were fabulous. This will be a staple for us - quick, delicious and elegant.
