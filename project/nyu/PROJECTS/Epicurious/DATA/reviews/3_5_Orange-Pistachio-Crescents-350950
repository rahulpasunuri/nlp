These are one of my favorites for the holidays. They are a bit labor intensive, but worth the effort. I add a pinch of ground cardamom to the filling. I also make at least a double batch of the candied peel and use it to make florentines

These are unbelievable. I can't believe anyone would hate these if they followed the recipe correctly. Huge effort but you can taste every minute I spent on them! Why do people rate recipes they haven't actually tasted and/or followed the recipe wrong? I hate that people's bad ratings from botched attempts will prevent more people from enjoying these cookies - one of my favorite cookies ever. Only change I made was to add a little salt to the filling.

The best! I don't think those who gave this bad reviews made the dough correctly. You cannot take shortcuts. These are a HUGE hit every year and we will continue to make them. The dough (when made correctly) is buttery and flaky. The filling is so unique and delicious!

These are some of the best cookies I've ever tasted. Not only are they simply beautiful, but they are so delicious, and pack a nice, unexpected flavor. They are really a pain to make, though! My suggestion is that you do extra candied orange peel while you're at it, so that you have some of that for your holiday candy/cookie display!

I disagree with the other reviews. I thought these were phenomenally good, as did my husband and our two Swedish friends we made them for. They were so good, I nicknamed them "Heaven Cookies." They reminded me of Russian Teacakes/Mexican Wedding Cookies w/ a fun surprise in the middle - a nice crunch from the pistachios and a light orange essence which perfumed the perfectly flaky and light powdered-sugar coated dough. This recipe is a keeper!

I have been so disappointed in a cookie recipe before. The dough was dry and flavourless and the filling was even worse. It had no redeeming qualities at all After tasting the first two batches I threw out the filling and make blackcurrent jam thumbprints instead with the rest of the dough. I was planning on giving these out tomorrow as Christmas gift tomorrow. Now I have nothing. Bummer!

These came together rather easily (as easily as any stuffed dough comes together for me), but I was disappointed by the pastry dough; it seemed like it was going to be flaky and tender, but seemed rather dry... the amount of stuffing I was able to fit into the crescents was not enough to redeem the dough for my family and me. I would not make these again.

I just saw the previous review. I understood that the dough should be divided into portions, manipulated slightly to better incorporate the butter into the dough, and then all the portions recombined. I used a slightly smaller cutter than the 3-inch recommended and I obtained about 40 cookies, with just a little bit of dough left over for unfilled cookies. I'll try brushing the leftover dough with some egg wash and sprinkling with ground nuts or sanding sugar.

These cookies were good, but mine seemed to be missing some oomph. I used unsalted roasted pistachios so perhaps my filling was missing salt. The orange rind was easy to candy and the extra syrup that drained out was good to flavor tea with. The dough rolled out well with a minimum of cracking, but I couldn't get mine to look like crescents, so they look like miniature pierogies. I tried dipping them in a mixture of gold luster dust (edible glitter) and powdered sugar after baking but they didn't shine very much- perhaps granulated sugar or sanding sugar with the luster dust before baking would have been a better idea.

Can't say anything about the taste yet as I'm in the middle of making this. However, there's something screwy with the recipe since it says to divide the dough into 8 portions, then divide each portion in half, and then chill the portions (16 total). It then says to roll out each portion into a 12x15 section and make 16-20 cookies from each. If that were even possible, you'd get 16 portions x 16-20 cookies or about 300 cookies, when the recipe is in fact for 3 dozen.
