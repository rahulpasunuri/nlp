Made this for the first time and leveryone loved it!! Didn't find it to be runny at all. I did drain the spinach very well and i salted the cut cucumbers and put in a sieve to drain for about a half hour. Also, used greek yogurt which was extra creamy. This will probably become my go-to dip!

Not impressed. As the others said, RUNNY. Flavors together did not mesh and the end product was extremely bland.

Haven't tried this yet, but I expect that to avoid the wateriness that the cucumber be left out and the spinach briefly "steeped" in boiling water and then drained in a fine strainer as you would with the herbs for a sauce vert. I'd also leave out the wine vinegar and look to something else to give the dip a sharp note -- well drained horseradish or maybe some wasabe powder.

This recipe is like a Martha Stewart version of the plain old Knorr soup mix version. While all the fresh veg tastes great, the wine mixed with yogurt tends to sour the flavor a bit and makes it really "wet" (runny). If your guests are happy with the easier Knorr soup mix version, go for that. Easier to make and more flavorful, in my opinion. Save your culinary efforts for the main course.

it gets runny if you don't squeeze the heck out of the spinach. smash the spinach against a strainer to get it really dry. Also - the first time I made this I didn't chop the spinach finely enough. So, now I squeeze it and chop it and go away and do something else and come back in half an hour and squeeze some more and chop some more! i love the taste of both the cukes and radishes. It makes this taste *very* fresh and totally outclasses anything made with soup mix. especially in the winter when fresh vegetables with flavor are not that easty to find - this dip is splendid. I serve it with plain Sun Chips.

The dip turned out too runny and wasn't what my guests wanted they wanted the Knorr spinach dip, sorry.

I really loved this dip served with carrot sticks and cherry tomatoes. It had a nice texture with the chopped up cucumber. I omitted the radishes because there was no need for them. I substituted the tarragon for basil. Make sure you use fresh spinach and fresh herbs.

A little bland for my taste.

This was very good. I would serve it again for guests. I found that for my taste, it needed some added salt.

I have made this recipe twice and both times to rave reviews. I serve it with carrot sticks and blanched broccoli crowns. I love that this recipe uses fresh spinach and I much prefer it over the other recipe which uses the dried soup mix. I use whole milk yogurt which I drain for 10 minutes in a coffee filter to remove excess water and I use white grape "verjus" instead of white wine vinegar (it's not as tart). I omit the scallions and if you don't have any fresh or dried tarragon, it does not hurt the recipe.
