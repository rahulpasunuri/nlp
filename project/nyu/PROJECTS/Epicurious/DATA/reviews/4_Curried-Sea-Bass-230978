Only a couple modifications. Used 2 tsp Madras curry powder (hot), evaporated milk instead of cream, olive oil and Promise instead of butter, tilapia instead of Sea bass, added frozen peas half way through the oven baking. Ok, a few more than a couple modifications, but all simple and turned out quite good. Served over rice. A bit spicey but that's how my wife and I like it.

I made this last night and it was wonderful! I used red curry spiked with 1/8 tsp cayenne since I was out of Madras. I used a type of sea bass - corvina. The filet was 1.5-2 inches thick, so I roasted it for 18 minutes @ 450. (it wasn't cooked through after 16 minutes) It was perfectly cooked and the curry sauce didn't overpower - it enhanced the fish. Truly delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

This was a great recipe. our family is dairy free and gluten. so I used grapeseed oil instead of butter and light coconut milk instead of heavy cream I omited the flour and used 2 tsp of curry powder it was amazing. I also had no shallots but onion worked just fine and I suggest adding some sweet potato or yams to it very good I served it over a Quinoa and rainbow chard it was so good. I will definitely make this again

This totally blew me away and for very little work, too. Made it exactly as written and didn't think it needed extra curry.

I added Greek Yoghurt to finish the sauce and this added a nice tang. Next time, I will double the curry powder too. Great recipe.

The beauty of this recipe lies in the sauce. So simple to make yet so tasty! I've made it several times with various fish such as cod, tilapia, haddock. Everytime I make it for a guest, they really enjoy and rave about it! I use the Hot Madra curry spice they recommend and I do see a difference as compared to my other curry powder. I usually keep it light and serve only with a nice side of gree veggies. 4 thumbs up!

This recipe was tasty, but very mild. I doubled the curry and still found it a bit too mild. I served mine over frozen (cooked) cut okra and a brown rice pilaf.. the flavors worked well together. Next time I would spice it up a little more, maybe a chopped jalapeno in the shallot phase.

I used grouper and this came out really delicious. Also I didn't have a shallot so I used onion & garlic instead. Had to cook it about 15 minutes.

I sauteed diced ginger in butter until fragrant(about 1 minute on high) Then added sliced mushrooms until brown on the edges, and added 1/2 a diced large onion before adding the cream and curry.(doubled the curry) Put 1/2 lb of raw, peeled shrimp on top of the filets. Sweet

I was very impressed by this recipe. It was incredibly easy to make and it tasted delicious! Like other reviewers said, the curry taste is very mild. I even added an extra teaspoon or so and it was still mild. I added peas to the roasting pan with the fish and sauce and it all went together excellently. My husband loved it, so I'll definitely be making it again. The only problem I had was that the fish stuck to the pan a bit. Next time I'll use a squirt of cooking spray.

This was very good, very mild for a curry. I served it over rice. The entire family loved it, including my five year old. Next time I'll double the sauce recipe and add peas.

This is a superb recipe. Curry haters would probably not even notice that there is curry in it, the flavor is very mild. My sea bass was 2 inch fillets, no skin, and it took a little longer to cook than the recipe calls for..maybe 15-18 minutes; I used my Brookstone Grill Alert, which told me exactly when it was ready. I suggest sprinkling some capers on the fish just before serving, and if you can get Mexican limes, also known as Key limes, I would recommend them. (they are yellow at peak flavor, but sold green normally in the US, available at Winn Dixie and Publix here). This recipe is a winner!

This was very good! I could not get sea bass *sigh*, but worked it with good flounder.Lowered the temp to 350 as flounder is more delicate. The curry buried the fish, but the texture was perfect. My fish guy promised me sea bass next week, and I'll do this again. The recipe screams for a stronger fish flavor to counter the Madras curry powder. Must admit it would also work with chicken, just a longer cooking time.

Sea Bass has a wonderful texture, if a somewhat strong flavor, so pairing it with this creamy curry sauce is really nice. The dish is very easy to make. It's more of a mildl French cream sauce than an Indian curry. I served mine with some cooked carrots, but any mild vegetable would work well I think.
