Very tasty. I ended up adding about a cup of chicken broth right at the end, as I wanted something with a little more liquid to top some brown rice.

Super fast and easy but a little bland. I used bacon but not the grease. Maybe that is why? I added cherry tomatoes but maybe it would have been better if I had used chana masala like another reviewer suggested.

Please do yourself a favor, do not skip the bacon step. It added such a wonderful crunch to this dish. I used 4 slices of bacon, could have used more spinach. Otherwise, follow this recipe verbatum and you will not be disappointed. Your mouth is in for a real treat. I see this is Spanish in origin. I wonder if this is considered a Tapa dish. Anybody knwo? Just make it, you'll be happy you did.

This was great! I had to use what was on hand due to lack of transportation, but it was still great. I used frozen spinach, no cumin, served it over rice with a warm yogurt/curry sauce. So easy and fast. I have already had a request!

This is good and satisfying just the way it is. The second time I made it I used sweet italian sausage rather than bacon, you could also use hot italian, removed the skin and broke it up to saute, a couple of pinches of cumin, and a handful of parm-regg, fresh portugese bread. Wonderful and easy.

This was very good, but don't boil the bacon. I beg you. The smell was so foul that I kind of lost my appetite for the whole dish. It was similar to the smell of a pork slaughterhouse. Ick. Never boiling bacon again.

Great, quick, savory dish. Boiling the bacon beforehand helps to cut down the fat. I included chicken thighs - sauteed and browned then added remaining ingredients and it turned out excellent. Also topped with some fresh lemon juice and cilantro. Bon Apetito!

I liked this recipe,,I'm always looking for a way to use greens and legumes together. I made it the way it was printed, next time I'll add more spinach. For those chick pea fans out there, this site has a ton of recipes under "chickpea" (one word) also. Also if you like this recipe, check out the Cannellini and Kale Ragout recipe on this site. Awesome.

I left off the bacon but other than that I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 tomatoes, 12 cups of spinach, a little less than 1/2 tsp pepper flakes and was pretty liberal with the cumin. This turned out excellent, perfect on its own as a meal for 2. My husband (who is not usually a fan of chickpeas) topped it with pita chips and really enjoyed it as well. I can't believe how good it tasted, and it only took about 10 min to make.

wonderful. I substituted swiss chard for the spinach and ran away with it. a wonderful dish. needs more oil to keep the peas from drying out during the saute.

I found this dish very dry and unpleasant in a way that could not be altered by the addition of cumin, onion or tomatoes. It is one of the only beans-and-greens recipes I have ever disliked and am a little surprised at the good reviews. I ate a spinach and chick pea dish at a bar in Barcelona about 10 years ago and have been trying to find a similar recipe ever since; this was a big disappointment.

I added a chopped onion, cumin to the pan and then a little 12 yr old balsamic at the end. I also had kale so I threw that in too and used a nice pancetta instead of the bacon. It definitely needed the kick of extra cumin and extra hot pepper for flavor

A nice change from the usual side dishes. Just made it for a 10 person dinner party to go with the "six-hour roast pork" - everyone liked it. Agree with the previous suggestions to add cumin for a little more flavor and complexity. The hot pepper flakes are important to the flavor as well - don't skimp!

Great!! Definitely increas spinach ratio, add cumin I added two skinned, diced fresh tomatoes-yummy

Just back from Barcelona and wanted to recreate a dish I'd had a couple of times there. Hooray for Epicurious -- this was it. Made it without bacon for some vegetarians, and it was still good. Doubled garlic and added the cumin other reviewers suggested. Next tiem I might increase the spinach-to-chickpea ratio. With bagged baby spinach, this took about 5 minutes and was gorgeous. Also good at room temp.

This is one of our favorite recipes. I rarely use the bacon; I just use a good-quality olive oil. I've made it with all different kinds of canned beans, and it's always a hit. Every time I've made this for company, people request the recipe. Easy, healthy (well, without the bacon), and delicious! Don't leave out the red pepper flakes!

Fabulous...and fabulously simple. Added about 1.5 tsp. of cumin...suggested in an earlier review...great suggestion and made a massive difference. Used regular cut bacon, as I was serving with salt-encrusted red snapper and didn't want the "extra thick" cut of bacon to overpower the fish. Worked perfectly Would use more than the suggested amount of baby spinach next time, though, as ratio of chick peas to spinach was a bit high. Loved the dish and will try it again as a "main" with thr addition of some fresh, peeled and seeded cooked Italian plum tomatoes and a baguette...something almost "Chana Masala" -ish for lovers of Indian food.

what a great easy recipe. very tasty. forgot to boil the bacon, but turned out delicious anyways. also, just used the bacon fat and skipped the olive oil. mm mm good.

A nice recipe, but somewhat bland. I'd suggest adding some spices like cumin and cinnamon, and using fresh chilies instead of red pepper flakes. Nevertheless, it's a very interesting side dish.

Delicious and supereasy. Being from the South, and not afraid to cook with Bacon grease, I skipped the olive oil and just used the bacon drippings. Try the excellent bacon from Fatherscountryhams.com.

I'm not a big fan of cooked spinach on its own, but I made this recipe and have forever changed my mind on the subject. (Of course, adding bacon makes anything taste good.) I will definitely make it again for anyone who says they don't like spinach.

Really excellent and very quick (30 min max.)! I used 12 c. of spinach and cooked chickpeas a little longer (5 min.) and then served on pasta with a squeeze of lemon juice, olive oil, fresh ground pepper and a healthy amount of parmesan. Chickpeas and pasta are great texture and flavor combo.

Very quick and easy. A nice change for a side dish, and great way to use spinach. I did not boil the bacon first. Just browned it, then drained most of the grease away, and still very flavorful.

Delicious and so easy! I was searching for something to use up my baby spinach and came across this recipe. I love chick peas so gave it a try. I boiled the bacon since mine was frozen but I don't think I would have bothered otherwise.Followed the recipe.Great results.

Good. The bacon is a good addition and adds flavour to the dish. You need to add another tbl spoon of during the cooking. I boiled the bacon and it helped with the fatty oil

This was really tasty! I added the third TB of oil to the mixture while it was cooking (the spinach) to keep the chick peas from drying out. Used Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper to season. I didn't boil the bacon first - just used 3 slices of regular bacon, fried in a pan.
