Love, love, love this dish! Made it as a part of a tapas dinner and it was a smashing success. WholeFoods didn't carry Bresaola, so I used another imported Prosciutto. So yummy! I also made it the following evening without the Bresaola/Prosciutto as a simple, yet delicious salad along side some salmon cakes! New favorite in the house...with or without Prosciutto!

similar to my go to lunch in Italy. Make it often now (the gribiche is fantastic). I make per recipe.

Amazing! Perfect for dinner parties! Everything can be premade and just put the dressed arugula over the meat and dollop the egg mixture in the middle! Beautiful!!

I have made this recipe a number of times with great success. I love the flavors and textures and it looks divine. It's an easy crowd pleaser or an easy appetizer to share from a large plate.

Where have you found Bresaola? We were in Italy last year and love it. Thanks.

Hey can't wait to try this recipe. To Sperga from Chicago, you can find organic Bresaola at Whole Foods! We have it all the time.

This was time consuming but SPECTACULR!! I've made it three times with rave reviews. I wouldn't change a thing and HIGHLY recommend it as an appetizer recipe to impress.

I served this at a small dinner gathering and all the guests loved it. The Bresaola was fantastic (if you can find it) and the radishes paired with the other ingredients provided a complex appetizer to start the meal. I'll definitely make this again

not all that impressed - probably wouldn't make again.
