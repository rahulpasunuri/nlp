I loved it! However, after cooking in the chocolate, I then added various fruits such as strawberries and rasberries to give it that burst of flavor it really needed. If you need the crust recipe, it is linked into the word.

This was fabulous!! I did make a few changes though - nothing that affected the integrity of the recipe! I used pre-made pizza dough, didn't have Nutella, so substituted cashew butter mixed with Hershey's chocolate syrup, used Ghiradelli chocolate and white chocolate chips, and, once pizza was done, sprinkled top with mini marshmallows and broiled it for about a minute - until the marshmallows were lightly browned. Think I'll make this with my niece and nephew - great idea for kids!!

The crust is fantastic! I think it might be wasted on Nutella, but as a dessert item for a party it is really well received. The guests loved it!

Am I missing something? Where is the dough recipe?

Not only was this dessert delcicious but it was such a conversation piece when I told guests we were having a chocolate pizza. I did not make the homemade dough but bought a fresh dough from the grocery store. This made the recipe so simple and easy to make in 30 minutes or less. It came out great and my guests said it would even be great for breakfast like a chocolate croissant. I melted the 2tbl of butter but only used less than half- it would be too greasy if you used all. This is a keeper recipe, fun, easy and oh so chocolatey- especially good if you are a dark chocolate lover. I made several hours in advance and let it sit at room temperature until dessert time.

This dough is fantastic, the chocolate pizza is good, but try the dough for other pizza recipes too.

Really Lambdk - don't sweat the small stuff. Would you REALLY use 2 tbs of butter just to glaze the dough?? Personally, I didn't find the butter neccessary. This recipe was a hit with the kids - esp coz they made it themeslves :)

I didn't follow this exact recipe, but I am a HUGE Nutella fan & have made quite similar before. Soooooo delicious! Oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it! You absolutely can't go wrong; it really does pair exceptionally nicely with pizza crust dough.

Great hit with the kids - best homemade pizza dough made yet!

The butter equivalent is wrong. It is either 2 TABLESPOONS/ 1/4 stick, or it is 2 teaspoons..

Not only is the pizza crust wonderful and versatile, but paired with the delicious chocolate-hazelnut combo, it's fabulous. I made a double-batch of the pizza dough and used half for pizza and have for this dessert pizza. I didn't measure any of the chocolate ingredients or hazelnuts, I simply slathered on the chocolate hazelnut spread (I used Trader Joe's version) and sprinkled on some chips (I used Callebaut) and toasted hazelnuts. Even though my husband and I were full from having pizza for dinner, my husband managed to finish two slices of this great dessert pizza. This was a perfectly simple dessert to have on a casual pizza night.
