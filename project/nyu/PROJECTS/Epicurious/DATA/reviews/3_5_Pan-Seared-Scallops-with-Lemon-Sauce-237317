I don't understand the reviewers who said this recipe didn't have enough flavor. The sauce is an accompaniment, not the main dish. A sauce should be somewhat subtle, complimenting the flavor of whatever you put it on. I found this sauce to be just that and my husband and I loved it. We had so much left over that I saved it and a couple of nights later, I plated herb-crusted halibut filets with a dollop of this sauce and we liked that even better than with the scallops. This sauce is a keeper and we'll be enjoying it again. I may even try reducing the lemon juice and stirring in a teaspoon of dijon.

Normally I would not make a 3 star recipe, particularly when only 70% would make again! So what surprise when my wife prepared this tremendous lemon sauce to serve on salmon. The 3 stars come from large numbers of reviewers who substitute lemon juice for lemon PEEL and numerous other modifications. Make the recipe as written and it produces a wonderfully subtle (not bland) lemon sauce with a hint of curry. It is perfect for the mild flavor of scallops or halibut while strong enough to stand up to the flavor of salmon. So don't be scared away by the rating and make the recipe just as it is written!

Tried this with some beautiful U-10 scallops; wanted a light citrusy sauce and I am always a sucker for cream based sauces. 4 forks would be too many, because the recipe does need tweaking, but I would propose that this can be a wonderful sauce and very versatile. Haricot Vert, Lobster, Broccolini, Halibut, the list goes on that I want to try it with. Next time, I will: add more lemon juice, the sauce was not quite lemony enough. Reduce a bit longer, I like a little thicker sauce than this yielded. I subbed the turmeric with mustard seed and that added a bit of interesting flavor. Will definitely do that again. Finally, dinner was accompanied by a caprese salad, so I took some of my reduced aged balsamic vinegar and "pulled" it through the sauce with fork tines to create a little pattern. It looked beautiful and added just the tiniest zing to the sauce. Will do that again as well. Overall, great sauce base, it will be a mainstay in my kitchen.

Turmeric seems like a bit of an odd choice if you're going for flavor. The sauce was beautifully colored, of course, but the taste really didn't blow me away.

I too used this recipe only for the sauce to accompany another fish. While not terrible and quite easy to make, there was nothing exciting about it at all.

I read the reviews before I tried this recipe and because of the mixed reviews I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I'm happy to report that it was delicious!! I understand what some of the other reviewers were saying about it being bland. I think that happens for two reasons: lemon juice from concentrate or not reducing enough. I usually buy the real lemon juice (you know, in a glass bottle) from the organic market, but this time went to Target and came out with the little plastic lemon squeezy. Tasting the lemon jucie I from the squeezy it was a lot weaker than what I usually buy. I doubled the amount of lemon juice which seemed to work nicely. Also, I tasted the sauce after the recommended cooking time and it wasn't thick enough or bold enough so I just let it reduce for another 10min or so. It turned out perfect!!! I poured the sauce over linguine and it was the perfect amount for two servings. I'll mos def make this again.

The best sauce ever!!!! At a local restaurant I enjoyed some lobster fritters served with a delicious lemon sauce that I have never been able to duplicate. THIS IS IT!!! I purchased some gynormous scallops and took them home to pan sear. I first rolled them in Panko crumbs, nothing else. Then seared them in butter and olive oil (a favorite). Meanwhile I made this lemon sauce recipe. I strained the recipe on the plates and placed the pan seared scallops atop the lemon sauce. This is a winner!

I only made the sauce - it was terrible.

I did toss the scallops lightly in a mixture of flour, salt and pepper before cooking. I also used only a small portion of the lemon juice and clam juice and about 1/2 the herbs. It was delicious. My husband doesn't like scallops and he loved it! I will definitely make this one for guests-an elegant and delicious dish.

the sauce actually goes well with the scallops i think although it is quite a light flavour. i didn't bake the scallops either.

OK, but I don't think I will bother with it again. Very time consuming especially to have the sauce be sooooooo bland. I added more lemon juice and salt and that helped a bit. I have so much sauce left over I may try adding dill or something to pick it up. All that heavy cream is a real artery clogger. By far one of the best scallop recpe is Seared Peppered Scallops with Orange-Soy Glaze here on the Epicurious site. Easy! Delicious! Divine!

I am really surprised at some of the negative reviews of this recipe. I found the sauce to be tasty and a perfect companion to the subtle flavor of scallops. I had leftover scallops from yesterday's clam bake (actually my husband forgot them in the fridge) and needed a quick and easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was lightly dust the scallops with creole and blackening seasoning as I was searing them. Since the scallops were rather large, I baked them for five minutes instead of three. I served them on a bed of baby spinach sauteed in butter and fresh pan roasted garlic. I also served this dish with leftover red potatoes fried crispy golden brown. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe a few times and have found that it makes a big difference what kind of wine you use. I find it is best with a somewhat oaky chardonnay. Louis Latour 'Adreche' chardonnay is cheap enough to cook with and works well for this. If you do a thorough job of pressing the sauce solids through the strainer, it is lemony enough to skip the lemon juice. If you do use lemon juice, add it gradually to taste to avoid overpowering. Also - beware, once you have added the lemon juice you cannot reheat without curdling - so make sure to add it right before serving. If the sauce tastes a bit bitter, add 1/8 tsp of sugar to mellow it out. Once you master the details - this is really delicious, elegant, and easy!

Served this as a first course for a dinner party. This was the favorite dish. Did not cook in the oven, just pan seared and served.

I have made this recipe countless time since it came out in March. I didn't change it one bit. Last time I visited my daughter-in-law, she had the scallops all ready to go for me as she wanted it for the first course of the evening. I don't bake the scallops, just pan sear.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't find the sauce bland at all. It had just the right balance of flavor without overpowering the scallops.

I think the sauce could have been halved. I had a lot left over. It was tasty, though mild. I just cooked the scallops in a pan on the stove top. No need to also bake.

Despite all the negative reviews I made this for a dinner party. All guests raved with one stating, "as good if not better than any restaurant." Delicious!

I almost didn't make this due to such negative reviews. On the advice of my sister, who tired it, I made this for a small dinner party. All guests raved and one stated "As good, if not better than any restaurant."

What a disappointment! I made this for a special meal and ended up ditching the sauce entirely. Fortunately I salvaged the lovely scallops for a completely different preparation. Something seems very off with this recipe--bland and dull--a waste of good ingredients.

I'm very surprised by the negative reviews...made this for my husband this weekend and we both enjoyed it. The sauce was mild but delicious. Easy to prepare and versatile...could see serving it with other fish like Tilapia or even with chicken. I served it with both sauteed scallops and shrimp. We are already talking about when we should make it again.

Scallops were fine (but I cook them fairly often anyway) but the sauce was a huge disappointment---not good flavor and a very strong yellow color which was simply unattractive. I actually also made the potatoes and chanterelles with this menu and was also disappointed in those. Oh well!!!

while the scallops were good, we did not care for the sauce at all--just ate the scallops without it --I was glad I didn't put it over the scallops without tasting it first

The sauce was not to our tastes- very mild, with not enough flavor.
