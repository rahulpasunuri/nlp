These were good and easy to make -- but I thought the peanut filling left a bit to be desired. Could be because I used dark chocolate but the chocolate seemed to overwhelm the peanut butter. I used a small paint brush to coat the sides--was small but with fairly firm bristles. I used individual silicon cup molds and popped them into a mini muffin pan. I have some heart shaped chocolate cups made and plan to fill those with dulce de leche instead of peanut butter. I liked them and will make them again. (Oh and I followed the recipe as written.)

I give this 4 forks, with a few comments. Definitely use crunchy peanut butter. I used smooth, and there wasn't enough texture. I only added 1 tbsp cream. The directions seemed way too complicated, so I made it much easier. I microwaved a mix of ghiradelli 60% with Trader Joe's 72% and a little milk for short amounts of time with lots of stirring worked very well and was easy. I didn't have mini muffin cups, so I just used regular muffin cups + muffin papers to make jumbo pucks. I heated all the chocolate and assembled the cups all at the same time. Put in the fridge - 18 pucks ready to eat in 1/2 hr. Yum!

These were great and so easy to make. I used salted peanuts on top, which was nice with the sweetness of the chocolate and filling. I've found them a little difficult to get out of the foil muffin cup, but that is my only complaint.

I've made these many times in the past as a gift for my friends son, who LOVES peanut butter cups. This is a very tasty and easy recipe.

I've used this technique and filled the cups with caramel topped with caramelized hazelnuts. I use a small paint brus to coat the muffin cups.

Great recipe! Try using tin-foil muffin cups; they're stronger and that makes it easier to spread the melted chocolate around. The back of a small spoon works well as a scoop/spatula. For serious chocolate lovers, I recommend using a high-quality bittersweet chocolate (Ghirardelli has given good results) and adding about 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder per pound of chocolate. Dutch-process cocoa powder is best. Also, honey-coated peanuts are a great addition. Add them after the peanut butter mix has been loaded into the cups. Finally: To add a bit of class, you can make "black-and-white" peanut butter cups by using dark chocolate for the base and white for the top. It is VERY important to use good quality white chocolate: Hersheys totally failed, while Ghirardelli works quite well. Something about the wax content, I think.

I thought these were a huge pain to make. I am very patient and pretty experienced with candies, so I thought these would be quick and easy. Spreading the chocolate in the cups was messy, frustrating, and time consuming. My chocolate was never going to be able to spread just by swirling with a knife. The filling is amazing, and they tasted great, but because spreading choc. was tricky, the presentation was lacking. I might try again with some alterations.

this was easier than expected. only because i used a mini-muffin pan when spreading chocolate to keep the shape of the cups during th whole process. i put the cups in the pan and spread the chocolate in the cup with the back of a plastic spoon. i also used paper cups and the chocolate didn't stick. they were ready in a little over an hour. jsut in time for Valentines day before he got home from work! :)

Very easy to make with good results. Used the 2" size called for as well as 1" miniature size; both came out well, although the bite- size cups were just the right size for me.

very rich , but taste good almost to rich to finish one cup

These were really excellent--one taster liked them so much that she said I should make them en masse and sell them commercially. I couldn't find miniature muffin cups so I just put the chocolate directly into miniature muffin tins and then froze them and knocked them out onto the counter. My only complaint is that next time I'd temper the chocolate so that they could sit out and not have to live in the fridge.

I grew up on homemade peanut butter cups so I had high expectations. I didn't mind the work involved but the 'filling' just didn't seem right. They got great reviews from my husband but I'm going to search for another recipe.

There is only one word that can describe these PB cups...that (slang) word is SLAMMING!

Oh my god, these are sooo fabulous! I made them last weekend and am making them again tomorrow. They freeze really well, so you can keep them to have on hand....yummy!

Found this recipe by accident, and decided to try this instead of my usual peanut butter balls. Oh!my! I thought that these would be more labor-intensive; however, they were fairly quick and very easy. My 6- and 8-year-old helped and did great! Highly recommended.

I made this a few years back for my mother to dazzle her coworkers with, and needless to say, they were!!! I was definitely more of a novice cook at the time, so now, I think the presentation would be nicer if I made them again. Once you get to the chocolate drizzling stage, things can get messy and a little frustrating if you're slow and the chocolate starts to harden, so work fast! But overall, an attractive dessert that draws raves. Next time, I will use creamy PB and regular, salted peanuts (the unsalted ones look a little dry and dull to grace the tops of these cups!)

I made these in 1990 when the recipe first came out and have been searching for it ever since! They were a huge hit, as well as absolutely beautiful in gold cups!

GREAT Recipe! Made it for a work function and everyone RAVED about the Peanut Butter Cups. Several thought I had "purchased" them. So Easy to make and very straightforward, even for me, a novice cook.

These were incredible! TIP: Get the plastic molds that look like peanut butter cups, then place in miniature muffin papers after solid - this is much easier! I used the larger ones (2") but will probably try the smaller ones next time as these are very rich . . . Also, I tried a few with milk chocolate bottoms and bittersweet chocolate tops - nice contrast and got many compliments - you can also reverse them. I also recommend using a good quality chocolate (i.e. Ghiradelli), found in most supermarkets in both bar and chip form. Enjoy!!

I thought it very easy. I used creamy peanut butter which worked well and milk chocolate. I may use dark chocolate next time because my husband likes it. Don't know if it would be the same. Good recipe.

I love this recipe and have used it since the year it came out! I use a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate, but as a culinary school student, I always tell people, use what you like--you're the one eating it!! Enjoy!

Two thumbs up! We all thought these were great. I used milk chocolate & liked it.Will make these many more times.

Is it just me or would these be better with milk chocolate?? I used semisweet chocolate and felt that the chocolate sort of overwhelmed the delicious peanut butter mixture. However, still fantastic, great to put in a nice tin and give away. The people I gave them to loved them and I will definitely make them again and often-- next time using milk chocolate.
