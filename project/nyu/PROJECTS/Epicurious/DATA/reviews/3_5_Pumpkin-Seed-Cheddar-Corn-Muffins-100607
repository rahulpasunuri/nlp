Whoa! These were awesome! I cut back to 5 Tbs of butter and added another 1/2 cup of cheese and they were not greasy at all. I also skipped chopping the pumpkin seeds--I liked the texture of the bigger pieces.

This is our favorite corn muffin recipe. Because we like little muffins and there are only two of us, I cut the recipe in half and cook in mini muffin tins. The pumpkin seeds I usually have on hand are little so I don't chop them (good crunch) and most often just use a fresh chili-type pepper instead of pickled jalapenos. I wake up in the middle of the night on purpose to sneak into the kitchen for any of these muffs that happen to be left over.

these were not bad, but i found them to be really oily. next time i will reduce the butter and see how we go. nice accompaniment to tortilla soup (minus the pumpkin seeds).

Really delicious, my new favorite cornbread recipe. I added a chopped scallion too.

I made mini muffins and added an extra 1/2 cup of cheddar - didn't have pumpkin seeds or jalapenos - they were REALLY yummy! Just a little crispy on the outside - soft inside with a wonderful cheesy flavor.

Very quick, easy and tasty. Served with chili (Ding Dong Eight Alarm Chili - divine). These hold together well, which is a problem for some corn meal baked goods. Add a little extra cheese! Would also be great without the jalapeno.

Loved it! I served these at my daughter's birthday party for the adult guests and they were a hit. Some of the kids (3 year olds) even liked them too. I will definitely make these for as many occasions as possible. I used Bob's Red Mill Corn Meal which is a courser grind and added extra seeds and cheese on top.

A great recipe to go along with hearty chili. I make a huge pot of chili and a double batch of muffins, freeze everything and have ready made lunches.

I don't know what the cook from NY was expecting? Raisins? I have made this recipe numerous times over the last three years, using fresh and pickled jalapenos and even my 5 yr old loves it.

I've been looking for a snack like this for midmorning. I paired it with a nut crusted fish and broccoli for a really great dinner. I followed the directions exactly.

I thought that these muffins were both savory (not supposed to be sweet)and tasty. They are great with a big bowl of hearty chili!

I made these for work and everyone loved them. The amount of jalapeno is relatively small so it's just spicy, not hot.

Perhaps some raisons or something to sweeten the muffin would have helped but I wound up throwing some out.
