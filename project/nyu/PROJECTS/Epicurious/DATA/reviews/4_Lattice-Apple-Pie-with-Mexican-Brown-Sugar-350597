I made this recipe with store bought pie crust- b/c the reviews I read were not favorable to the one listed. The filling and the taste of the apple and the syrup gave for a pleasant surprise- as I found that the flavor wasn't as rich as I anticipated- MUCH TO MY LIKING! the response from those who tried the pie was favorable. I will make this pie again. it was tasty :)

Yum, yum, yum! I've made this a couple times with the brown sugar/molasses combo and it's always been a great success ALTHOUGH I am NOT a huge fan of the pie crust attached --- Tomorrow I'm making it with the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" and dark muscovado sugar since i couldn't find piloncillo (sigh, such is life). --- Alterations: As other have suggested, I generally double the cinnamon.I feel it gives it a slightly richer flavor. I use slightly less sugar than called for since even the brown sugar/molasses combination can easily be overpowering I melt a tbsp of butter over the pie before I do the lattice top which also adds a touch of richness without (in my experience) making it 'too liquid-y'. Enjoy :)

LOVED it! It was flavorful & different, without being TOO different. I accidentally bought only half the amount of piloncillo that I needed, so I substituted half the brown sugar/molasses. The syrup smelled incredible! I made the pie the day before (even though it said it was best the day-of), and added a few pats of butter when I warmed it up in the oven. It was moist & delicious without being soggy. I also used the combo of apples suggested, and it was perfect. I cut the softer apples in slightly bigger wedges than the firmer apples to keep the consistency right. The only thing I would change would be covering the pie with foil for part of the bake time as the top of the crust browned a touch too much. Loved the pie & will make it again! p.s. I used Melissa D'Arabian's pie crust from her potato bacon torte-- it's the best! ;)

The use of canela/piloncillo puts this recipe at the top! Of course, making your own crust is the best. This wasn't too sweet, and had great spice.

This is the best pie I have ever made, and it is always a huge hit. Use a deep dish pie pan if you have one. Great great great recipe.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The filling was easy to make and I found the piloncillo both at my local supermarket in the ethnic aisle and at a Mexican supermarket. I used a crust recipe from Epicurious and it was excellent. It was my first time making a homemade crust, so I enjoyed the challenge. I would not change a thing!

Our Family loves this recipe. I picked up the sugar at the grocery store in the Latin food section, shaped like cones, hanging with the dried chilies. We use Jona Gold Apples.

This review begins with a confession..never baked a pie before in my life and I am 61. I womaned up and made it thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. YIPPY! Substituted piloncillo with light brown sugar and even though the recipe specifically says not to use Blackstrap Molasses it was what I had so I used it.I read the reviews and many advised making sure the sauce mixture cooked down to 3/4 cup so I let it cook slowly for a bit more than 30 mins stiring to check the consistantcy. It got thicker and thicker almost to candy but never got down to 3/4 cup. I took it off the heat becausing it was beginning to look like pull taffy. When I poured it over my flour coated apples it got a little scarry because it was too stiff to coat them. I poured the apples and the big lump of dark stuff into the pie crust, latticed the top crust, brushed it with milk, sprinkled the sugar on top and popped it in the oven and baked as directed. It was'nt until I smelled that great apple pie smell after baking 45mins did I feel like it might just turn out okay. Also even though the sauce did not mix with the apples (but kind of stood off to the side like a stuborn teenager with their arms crossed determined not to be a part of things)in the end it melted and blended completely. It by far was the darkest and best apple pie we ever ate before. ARK

I made the dough a few days in advanced and froze it, and mixed the filling a day ahead so when I arrived at my parents house on Thanksgiving I was ready to asseble the pie with just enough work left to impress the family with my baking skills. It was delicious, I will be saving this recipe for sure.

This was good, but not as exceptional as I had expected. I found the piloncillo at the supermarket in the spanish foods section (Goya makes it). I was not crazy about the flavor. I did, however, think that it was an excellent mix of tart and sweet apples.

Rating: 1
This pie was a disappointment, the flavor of the piloncillo was too overwhelming for the apples, and it was too sweet with an unbalanced flavor, it seemed a bit gritty although we fully dissolved the piloncillo and reduced it as directed. We did not use the same crust recipe based on other reviews so I can't comment on that, but otherwise we followed the recipe exactly. We made this and a caramel apple pie for thanksgiving and a group of 10 ate less than 3 pieces of this pie, while most of the caramel apple pie was eaten. I guess this is one to try if you are feeling like something different, but be sure to have a backup plan in mind.

I was a bit dissapointed. The pie had a HUGE missing ingredient in the apple filling.....butter or margarine. I checked the recipe again and again and I should've stuck some on top of the filling before I put it in the oven. It was dry and not the huge hit that I thought it would be. Although, I would use the piloncillo syrup again...that was the highlight of the recipe.

This pie was AMAZING! My only tip to first time users of this recipe is that the sugar "syrup" that you will make with the Piloncillo will harden guickly. My recomendation is to roll the apples in the flour and then fill up the pie, and then pour the "syrup" over the apples. The sugar really does make ALL the difference. I will be making this pie for many occasions in the future.

Very disappointing. We are pie bakers and were excited to try something a little different. The reviews were so wonderful that we jumped at it. We had the Mexican sugar and were looking for a use. This pie is way too sweet and other wise tasteless. The attached crust recipe, which we also tried, was way too salty. The final test was that we took it to a pot luck (it looked beautiful) of experienced cooks and over half of it was left- the other pie there was gone in 20 minutes.

with a lot of flavor, the syrup was too liquid :(. I would try it again.

I used this recipe to make pie filling with about 8 lbs of apples I got at a roadside stand in October (they were Gala). I had no trouble finding the piloncillo and made enough filling to freeze for two deep dish pies. (In two separate bags) After freezing it, I had an opportunity to make one pie just before Halloween because my husband had a potluck he needed it for. I defrosted the filling in the fridge and reheated it on the stove top and baked it in my usual crust recipe. My husband, who does NOT like pies, got such rave reviews that he tried it asked me to make ANOTHER a few days later. The finished pie had a wonderful sweetness and spice to it. I will be making this again next year! (and maybe buying more apples...)

Wow. What words to describe this recipe. My family said that it was better than any they could have bought and requested that it be in the holiday pies from now on. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was affordable, easy for this inexperienced cook, and best of all, the best tasting apple pie ever. I used red and green apples and the tartness and sweetness complimented each other perfectly.

Delicious and beautiful pie! It was my first time making a lattice pie (I used the linked pastry dough recipe), and it turned out great. It was more flaky than tender, but very appropriate for the application. I couldn't find piloncillo, so I used the dark brown sugar and molasses substitute. Just make sure to reduce the syrup all the way down to 3/4 cup. I stopped with a little more because it was already thick, but it thinned out when I mixed it with the apples and flour. In fact, my filling ended up bubbling over a lot in the oven. Also, be patient and make sure to wait until it's room temp to cut it, otherwise the warm syrup runs out into the pie pan. When it cooled down, however, it sliced perfectly. I served it with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was a hit!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I had no problem finding the piloncillo at my local grocery store (Fred Meyer/Kroger), in the ethnic foods section. I did not make the crust, but bought one that I rolled out. It was so good! I will definitely make this again.

Even though I live in a city with lots of specialty stores, I was not able to find piloncillo or anything like it; so I used the brown sugar and molasses. Was very good. I'd make again.

This is, hands down, THE best apple pie I've ever eaten or made. The depth and spices were perfect, as was the crust and the just-right tenderness of the apples at their 1/2 inch thickness. The only thing I did differently than the recipe was to use muscovado brown sugar rather than piloncillo. I can always find piloncillo EXCEPT when I'm looking for it, so I opted for the muscovado and I'm not sorry I did. I'll be using that from now on, even if I DO happen across the proper ingredient.

I liked this recipe, but I think that I prefer the Cinnamon Apple Crumble pie from this site: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cinnamon-Crumble-Apple-Pie-108650 It always gets rave reviews, and it's very easy. I agreed that I didn't like the look of this crust recipe, so I used the perfect pie crust recipe also from this site. Overall, this is nice if you want a change from the normal apple pie, because it does have more richness and depth of flavor. I don't normally refrigerate aple pies, but I would suggest doing so with this one, because it got soggy from all of the syrup. I might also reduce the syrup a little bit more next time.

This pie is excellent! I followed the recipe very closely. The only thing I altered was I added a bit more cinnamon as per the reviews. Just a pinch more, probably about an eighth of a tsp. I did not use the Mexican brown sugar, instead I used the dark brown sugar/molasses mixture. Some people wrote that the pie was bland and that there was too much liquid. I think the important thing if you are using the brown sugar and molasses is that you fully reduce the syrup. The recipe says that it will take longer to reduce - and it did take significantly longer - about 3x as long. Make sure you measure out your reduction and don;t stop reducing until you have reached exactly 3/4 cup. I did not see any need for adding oats to the apples. The syrup will be more liquidy before you bake it. The pie came out absolutely perfect. Just the right amount of apples and syrup. I used the recommended blend of granny smith, gala and mcintosh apples. Make sure you have the right poundage of apples. FOr the crust, I only used one tablespoon of ice water, but I would probably add a bit more next time. I used sifted (before measuring) flour. My kitchen was very hot, so my first attempt at the base of the crust fell apart so I re-chilled it and started over. The quicker you can get it rolled out and in the dish the better, before it warms up too much. The recipe doesn't tell you how to weave the lattice so I recommend looking up a how-to if you've never done this. I sprinkled the lattice with demarera sugar (a large-crystal natural sugar with a light molasses flavor) and it was perfect. I baked it for 20 mins at 425, then 50 mins at 375.

This is the tastiest apple pie I have ever made! Its the only one I make now and there are NEVER any leftovers. The only change I made was cutting back on the piloncillo a little bit. I cut about 1-2 inches off the tip of one of the cones. This is a FANTASTIC pie!

This was a good pie. Here I was in Mexico, with lots of piloncillo left over after making calabaza en tacha for the Day of the Dead when I stumbled on this apple pie recipe calling for piloncillo. Brilliant! Why it never occurred to me before I'll never know,although honestly if your usual apple pie recipe calls for brown sugar and cinnamon,there won't be all that much difference, but with this recipe you won't have to worry about the pie coming out dry. You do have to make sure that there are absolutely no tears in the pie crust. I added more cinnamon, but adding oatmeal to an apple pie wasn't appetizing to me, so I just added a bit more flour and the consistency of the liquid in the pie was perfect. I used more apples, cut them thin, heaped them into the crust and put a whole crust--not lattice--on top and baked for an hour at 375 degrees. The pie crust wasn't anything special at all, if you have a favorite pie crust recipe, use that one.

Emphatically, try this recipe. I made 2 of these for a party a few weeks ago, and my friends are already demanding I add it to the menu for my annual Christmas party. Definitely underline the other user's suggestion of adding 1/2 c of oats to the apples to give the sauce something to stick to. My sauce didn't cook down as much as the recipe instructed, but it still came out amazingly. I found a sugar called Zulka (azucar moreno), and added just a bit of molasses. Yum, yum, yum... Yum.

Made a few adjustments: 3/4t cinnamon, used 1c turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) instead of piloncillo, had only granny smith apples-used 6; added 1T brown sugar to the sugar/spice mixture. Cooked it in a 8in 2in deep square pan for 20+50min. After cooling, the middle did sink, but I wasn't surprised and it still looked great. My husband, who is quite picky and requested the pie, offered only one suggestion: more apples. :o)

I have made this twice now and it is great! The piloncillo really gives it a different flavor. My syrup was quite thick, probably too thick, but it mixed with the juices of the apple and it looked fine when I put it in the oven. I also doubled the cinnamon but otherwise made it as directed. The dough is easy to make and roll, although my kitchen was a little too hot, it still rolled and was tender and flaky. The top brownd very quickly and when I turned the over down, I put a sheet of foil over the top, worked perfectly.

This is one fantastic apple pie! I have made this pie three times. It is easy to make and a success each time. The only "personal touch" I add is a small handful of rum-soaked raisins and double the amount of cinnamon. Once I used vanilla essence for a different crust flavor. This recipe is my favorite among all the apple pies.

This recipie was amazing.. I had intended to replace the mexican brown sugar with demerera brown sugar.. but ended up only using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup really old instant apple cider mix which I mistook for demerera brown sugar ( I think it was pushing 3 years) anyway, the result was amazing. I'll definately try that again!

The crust had a terrific texture, but I thought it needed more flavor. Loved the lattice top and LOVED the syrup mixture, which I cut in half. I didn't have mexican sugar so I used light brown sugar and molasses and cooked a little longer than prescribed. I think next time I make this I will add more cinnamon, and some vanilla after cooling. I have a great pie crust recipe which I use regularly, which I will try with this filling next time.

I've made this pie twice now and differently each time. The first time I followed the recipe to the T including using 2 granny smiths, 2 golden delicious, and 2 cortland. I was unable to find piloncillo, but substituted the dark brown sugar and molasses which I believe came out to be very similar. The pie was excellent. The second time however, I used all pink lady apples and added 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the mixture to give the sugar mixture a little more to grab on to. That pie was absolutely phenomenal.

What a delicious pie! This is actually the first time I've made homemade crust, which I usually avoid because it appears daunting and I don't have a food processor. But I followed the instructions for Pastry Dough recipe and made it by hand, and it was so easy. I had some trouble weaving the lattice top but other than that, this was a perfect apple pie. I took it to Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it. I love cinnamon so I added a dash extra, and I also baked it for about ten mins. less than the recipe calls for, but if you just keep an eye on it you'll be fine. Per the instructions, I used 3-4 different kinds of apples and I really thought that added nice dimension, esp. with the Granny Smiths. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Perfect! I used this recipe to make pies w/my 3 children. They had a blast and really enjoyed eating the pie they made. We used Gala, Granny Smith & McIntosh - what a great blend of flavor. We used brown sugar w/ molasses. For moisture, We added a little extra water and butter slices in the filling. We also reduced oven temp to 350. !
