I don't consider myself a cook, but I was able to follow this recipe with great results! Everyone in my family enjoyed this and will certainly make again. The only thing I did differently was cook the eggs by themselves and then introduced it to the fried rice.

This was simple and good. Easy to make, everyone enjoyed it and plenty of leftovers for lunch. Will make again.

Made it for the family. Everyone loved it. Even my 16 month old loved it and she is a picky eater.

Surprisingly tasty, and I'm not someone who normally likes fried rice. I made this to use up some cold rice and I think I'll deliberately make extra rice from now on. It took about 5 minutes to make it. I added a few shakes of soy sauce to my bowl before I ate it.

I used this as a starting point for a stir-fry with tofu and General Tso's sauce. I used all of the same ingredients except for the ham, and it was quite tasty.

Adapted this a bit to personal taste, and what was on hand. Used diced ginger-teriyaki chicken sausage in place of ham, and seasoned with about a tsp. of reduced sodium soy sauce towards the end of cooking. Also, pre-fried the egg, as is usual with fried rice.
