This recipe has made it into my annual "must make" file - a favorite with everyone for looks and taste. I use a small christmas tree cutter and a tiny circle cutter so that the jam shows through as ornaments. Time consuming, but worth the effort.

I wasn't happy with these. I found the dough got way too soft too fast for cutouts. I gave up and made thumbprint cookies, which turned out great.

DELICIOUS! LOVE IT WITH LEMON CURD.

I have a love hate relationship with this cookie. It takes a good deal of time and the result is only a few cookies, but the flavor is wonderful. I use rasberry in place of the appricot and it is a beautiful addition to our holiday cookie bake.

I have tried all of the cookies from the basic butter dough and this one bothers me the most, not for the taste, but merely the quantity. All of the others tend to make their yield or close to it, I always have trouble with this one. At this time of year when you're trying to turn out as many cookies as you can, it's hard to justify to myself the labor I spend on these when I don't even get enough to put two in each of my gift boxes! Am I totally doing something wrong?! They do taste great and will be fun for my 3 year old to help with for family cookies, after I've finished my gift cookies!
