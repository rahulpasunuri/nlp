After reading thru reviews I made a few changes and it turned out a beautiful vibrant green arugula pesto. I did add garlic, salt, used an equal mixture of pine nuts and walnuts plus I stemmed the arugula which may help cut the "grassy" taste someone mentioned. I froze it in ice cube pans which means each cube is about 2 Tablespoons.

Followed the example of others and added 2 cloves of garlic, a generous amount of salt, and a good squeeze of lemon juice, which greatly helped to neutralize the grassy taste noted by another review. Will definitely make again.

Baby arugula is de best for pesto, it taste mild plus fresh garlic and you can also used pecorino cheese.

We had lots and lots of baby arugula and arugula flowers. This recipe certainly helped use it up! I'm not a big fan of arugula but this was very good. Like others, I added a clove of garlic and a little salt. It's good but it's different. I probably would not serve it to some one if I wasn't sure that they really love arugula.

I like pesto and I like arugula but I did not like the arugula pesto.

this recipe is a great way to use up some arugula. I used walnuts because I didn't have any pine nuts. I also added a couple cloves of garlic, a little basil from the garden, a bit of lemon juice, and was more liberal with the olive oil to make food processing easier. It was DELICIOUS with some fresh bread!

Would have gotten 4 forks, but i forgot that I don't like arugula. I also added a clove of garlic and when i tossed it into pasta I added some squeeze of lemon and shredded mozzarella. Was pretty good. I'd use this easy recipe with basil next time. Or cilantro. Or maybe a mix of spinach and basil.

As others did, I added garlic & absolutely loved this. You have to like arugula, of course, but I could eat this plain by the spoonful.

Agree that adding a clove or two of garlic and some salt improves this pesto. I tossed this with bucatini and add roasted tomatoes for a nice dish. Next time I will add grilled shrimp or scallops, which would go well with this type of pesto.

Maybe this is better with baby arugula? I made it with adult arugula, and it tasted like oily grass clippings. (Please note that I like arugula enough to grow several kinds of it myself). I recommend adding the garlic and extra oil, and using basil instead of arugula.

I added 2 cloves of garlic and some salt as other reviewers suggest, and it was quite tasty. I'm not a huge arugula fan, but this is a good way to sneak it into a meal.

I was trying to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover arugula when I happened upon this recipe. This is a fantastic way to get your dose of greens. I made it with garlic (about 2 cloves) as other reviewers suggested. I served it with whole wheat pasta and peas. It was delicious. I did feel that it was a lot less oily than other pestos, something which I consider a positive attribute. Next time I may add a bit of the pasta water to thin it out. No need to add pepper since arugula is already peppery, but I did add a healthy dose of salt.

I made this with walnuts instead of pine nuts, and I toasted them first. I also added liberal amounts of garlic, and it made a *fabulous* pesto. I served it on crusty french bread with sliced tomatoes and vidalia onions for a quick dinner for a vegetarian friend, and it was great. I used pre-washed organic arugula so it took me barely ten minutes to make this (and most of that time was waiting for the walnuts to toast). I'll be making this all the time this summer.

I made this to deal with an excess of arugula; I added garlic as some of the other reviewers suggest and the result was delicious on bowtie pasta. Very peppery.

Delicious! We added some garlic to ours and it was perfect! Will definitely be making again.

this is good, very peppery as arugula is. I served in on poached salmon which I think wasn't the best match. I froze the rest and will use it on pasta

Very nice and simple. I add garlic and pasta cooking water to thin the mixture.

Hey - where's the garlic? I also used spinach instead of arugula and added more pine nuts than called for, upping the olive oil a little to accomodate. It was very good with spaghetti and pita crisps (also from this website).

This is delicious and a refreshing change from my usual basil pesto. I love arugula and this is a great way to use up a surplus.

This pesto is excellent - the only change I make is to add some garlic. It is great with so many dishes - pasta, chicken, fish. I prefer to use it on dishes that don't require the pesto to be heated at all, this way you don't lose the fresh flavor.

This recipe is fantastic! I had just picked loads of spinach and so made spinach pesto. I toasted and used walnuts and added garlic as previous reviewer suggested and a touch of hot pepper. So simple and so very good. When I served it I added a ladle of the pasta cooking water and whisked that in to 'loosen' it up again.

Easy to prepare. Advance prep: toast pine nuts for 8-10 minutes at 300 degrees and then let cool. Beyond that, the only thing that took any time was rinsing and drying the arugula leaves. I added 4 large garlic cloves and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper. Really good. A little goes a long way.
