The more of these I eat, the more I like them. I first tasted I was a little disappointed with the taste. They look very pretty. The sprinkled sugar on the top gives them a great crunch. The have great cinnamon flavor. I really wanted to love them, but they just taste too much like a chunk of pie dough for me to love. Please don't let my review discourage you from making these cookies. I think they would make a great addition to a cookie tray, but I wouldn't want to sit down and eat a plate of them.

I thought these were great! I'm normally not crazy about shortbread, but the cinnamon and pecan really added to the traditional recipe. I topped it with an espresso-coated pecan - delish!

Thank you for the correction!!

Am I stupid, or does this recipe not tell you how long to bake them for! My recipe is all made and in the oven!

Loved it! Dough wasn't hard to work with at all. Didn't even refrigerate. Used a scoop on the dough and rolled into balls. Had no problem flattening with the plastic wrap on a glass. I do recommend loosening the cookies before they cool. Don't move them until they are completely cooled.

High investment, low return. I really had high hopes for these, but they are quite dry. Perhaps the baking time should be decreased? But I probably won't find out because it's unlikely I'll try again. : (

These cookies are delicious but spread an incredible amount during baking and then crumbled to pieces as I removed from the cookie sheet. Not sure whether I rolled them out too thin, but in the end lost nearly 1/2 the cookies into small crumbs (which I am saving to put on top of ice cream)!

Wonderful cookies...and they are really beautiful. I have had many compliments. One trick...when cutting with the scalloped cookie cutter, brush away "scraps" before lifting cutter. This ensures a clean edge.

I loved these cookies. I did all of the mixing in the food processor and then worked dough with my hands until it came together. Chilled and then worked into balls. It was a little hard to flatten with the glass and I finally took a fork to them, as you do with peanut butter cookies. Great taste and texture. I already gave some away as a gift and have made a second batch. These will be a favorite!

While these cookies were not bad, they were also not the irresistable cookie I was hoping for. The dough was very dry initially but did come together after working it for a bit. I rolled out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick and cut pretty circles. This worked well.
