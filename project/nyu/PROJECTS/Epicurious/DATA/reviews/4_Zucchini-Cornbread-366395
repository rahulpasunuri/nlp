This is absolutely Delish! I have made it several times and bake it in an iron skillet instead. It doesn't take as long to bake. I don't bother with the zucchini on top. I also don't brown the butter. I just melt it and throw it in with the rest of the liquids. Turns out Yummy every time. Very easy!!!

very good. i followed other suggestions and reduced the sugar to 2 tbsp (from 1/2 cup) and i think i it needed a little more (maybe 1/4 cup total) also added 3/4 tsp salt and i think it needs a little more. mine was a little pale so i turned on the broiler and browned the top. everyone raved about it!

Have made this recipe many times and love it. It is a great way to use up the bounty of summer squashes. The first time I made the bread was to accompany a pot of gumbo and it was perfect. Unexpected company came by and there wasn't a crumb left. Agree with other reviewers to reduce the sugar a bit.

Definitely a bread I will make again. Very easy to do. It's so moist and has a crunch to it that makes it so yummy.

After reading other reviews, I did cut the sugar back. I used half a cup, less 3 Tbsp. I thought it had the perfect amount of sweetness! I would definitely call it more sweet than savory, but that was just fine by me. I made a small loaf to give to a neighbor and a larger loaf for us, but after trying the bread, we'll be keeping them both :) I'll share the next batch, as I'll definitely be making this again. I'd suggest checking on the loafs after 30 min. Even the larger loaf didn't need more than 40.

Super easy and delicious. I used corn meal and coconut flour in place of the wheat based flours. I cooked it in an 8 inch iron skillet, 350 for 35 minutes. Came out perfectly. Cant wait to make it again.

This didn't work for me. Maybe because I just melted the butter in the microwave rather than browning it? I baked the loaf for almost two hours and, while it came out with a good flavor, the middle was still raw.

Love this recipe. However, this time I also cut the sugar back to 2 T. and will probably cut back to 1 T. next time. Wanted it to be more traditional, so I baked it in a 12 inch iron skillet. Too big... Came out about 1/2 in. thick. But still a big hit at the barbeque!

This got rave reviews all around. But UGH...I cut the sugar way, way, WAY down. What is it with drowning cornbread in sugar? It's like eating a slice of chocolate cake with your entree. A tablespoon was sufficient to play off the other flavors, and cut about 500 totally unnecessary calories from the dish. I also added a tablespoon of Provençal herbs, which worked great.

It's very hard to find a good cornbread recipe, but this is the best I've ever tried (or maybe even eaten)!

I first made this recipe for Thanksgiving. I cut the amount of sugar by half and still thought it was a bit on the sweet side. (My niece took some slices home to have with cups of tea.) I just made the recipe again and cut the sugar down to 3T. I am more than happy with the results. This was my first experience browning butter. On our stove it took considerably more than approximately 3 minutes.

My hugely picky son who will not eat any vegetables LOVED this recipe. I used 1/2 the sugar and he was asking me to make more! Will definitely make again

Yummy and perfect just as written, no changes required.Though I did not have wheat flour and used all white flour with the cornmeal.

I measured out 10 oz. of shredded zucchini - it came to about 2 cups - loosely packed, and from my garden that was about 1/2 of a medium zuc. So gardeners don't grab that zuc as big as a bat for this recipe. I also baked it in a more traditional cornbread pan - 9 x 12, but a skillet would have been good and that took 25 mins. No way in a loaf pan would it have been done.

Rating: 3
Agree more cooking time required. But lots of compliments and a great alternative to traditional cornbread.

I made exactly as written but did not bake it enough (my oven isn't trustworthy). So, I thought it was very good but seemed a bit underdone. So I tried to toast a slice but it just crumbled in the toaster. Then I tried grilling a couple of pieces in a nonstick pan with about 1/2 teaspoon of butter. Amazingly good! Highly recommend it. Was like the best French toast ever. I think adding Jalapenos is a good idea.

I made this cornbread because I had all the ingredients available. I was a bit skeptical that the results would be great because of the whole wheat flour and the sugar. Maybe it would be dry and too sweet? Not so. It baked in 55 minutes to a perfect, golden loaf. Everyone loved it with the grilled rib-eye steak dinner. The next day for breakfast, warmed, with a bit of butter, delicious!

made this gluten free with a sorgum flour blend and it looked and tasted great. Substituted gluten free flour one to one for wheat flour and added 1 teaspoon of xantham gum. No other changes needed for a delicious bread.

This is a fabulous cornbread; moist, substantive and delicious. I didn't bother with the zucchini slices on the top. I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on the top and it made the top a little crispier and sweeter. A real winner. I've made it numerous times with always excellent results.

This recipe was great. I used 1 1/4 c ww flour and 1 c cornmeal. Reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and baked as muffins. The whole family liked them. Next time I will omit the sugar all together so I can put a little honey on them! A great way to use up the zucchini in the garden.

Awesome. I made exactly as written and have found a new go-to corn brean recipe.

Yummy! Had to use up a very large zucchini from my garden and found this recipe. I baked mine in a #8 cast iron skillet, reduced baking time to 40 minutes. Also added half a roasted Hatch chile to the batter for incredible flavor without it being too hot. No, you probably don't have to brown the butter but it adds even more flavor. This was a huge hit with my Mexican friends, made me look like a great cook! Might take other's advice and reduce sugar a bit. This recipe goes in the 'Permanent File!'

Recipe is wonderful as written. I have also made it with equal parts whole wheat pastry flour, AP white flour, and cornmeal with great success. Suggest throwing in a little black pepper. If batter is too stiff, add a touch more grated zucchini. I followed the earlier reviewer's suggestion and baked this in muffin tins, with one zucchini slice per muffin. Makes a very cute presentation!

Loved this! Served it a dinner party and my guests loved it. I'm only giving it 3 forks because I did need to make the following changeds. #1. mandolined (thin) zucchini slices for garnish #2. 1 1/2 cups all-purpose white flour instead of part white and part whole wheat #3. 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup sugar #4. 2 shallow pans to shorten baking time and prevent soggy bread (in 2 8" round pans mine baked for about 35-40 minutes)

I made this last night for dinner to wonderful reviews from my mom and hubby. Based on other reviews comments I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and added jalapenos and corn, and made muffins rather than a loaf. The bread tasted delicious and I'll definitely make it again. I'm excited to try out other variations of veggies as well.

This was a fabulous cornbread! I was really worried it was going to be too sweet based on the reviews (my bf hates "sweet stuff"), but it was pretty much exactly what I wanted. The zucchini adds a nice touch and the cornbread has amazing crunch on the outside. I had never browned butter before and didn't know what too expect, but I followed the directions exactly and it was a piece of cake. Only thing I did differently (besides skipping the slices of zucchini on top) was to make 12 muffins instead of a loaf (the 3 hours 40 min total time was a real turnoff). They took about 20-25 minutes. The first one I had was still a little warm, and was a little drier and crumbly. The second (and third.... ) one I had was cooled completely, and I thought it was nice and moist. Served with Jerk Chicken from the same issue.

I baked this on the cool side of my grill in a covered cast iron skillet. Wonderful! It is not necessary to clarify the butter.

This is the third time I've made this recipe. It is fabulous for Sunday supper with a cold soup and salad. Twice I have used small loaf pans -- eight of my pans equal one loaf -- and the cooking time can be reduced to less than 30 minutes. However, while I love the lok of the zucchini slices on the bread, even after one day at room temp in a vacuum-sealed pouch, I found filaments of mold infiltrating the loaves -- starting right under the zucchini slices. If you are not going to eat all the bread at one sitting -- fresh from the oven, I would recommend leaving the zucchini slices off the top.

I agree with the others, less sugar, maybe by half. Jalapeño and cheddar might be nice, but the recipe as is was pretty tasty, and cooked well in a 9" x 9" for 35 minutes. I used a cast iron skillet, and browned the butter in there before filling with the batter. Next time I might try switching the amounts for the white flour and cornmeal3/4 c flour, 1 c corn meal. I like my cornbread a little drier and grittier, and that might be enough to do the trick.

This recipe looked so interesting I had to make it. My husband came home about an hour after it came out of the oven. We ate almost the entire thing and only saved a smidgen for the kids to taste. The crunch of the cornmeal gave this such amazing texture!

Rating: 3
Just the sound of the knife breaking the crust was enough to give this bread three stars. As is, it's definitely a sweet bread, not even close to being savory, and very good. Next time I will add a lot more zucchini to trick whoever is watching me scarf it down into believing it is good for me and try some of the other baker's suggestions for savory options.

This cornbread was OK, but I found it to be alittle dry and crumbly, but was good served with butter.

Rating: 4
The grated zucchini and browning of the butter really give a depth of flavor and moistness to this cornbread. I prefer to make mine in either a cast iron skillet or tarte tatin pan - and considering the 100-degree heat yesterday, opted for the latter, in my Breville countertop convection oven. It took just about 35 minutes with that type of pan on convect. Well worth repeating.

Rating: 4
Very light and good. I used stoneground cornmeal so the texture was great. Great starting point to make either sweet or savory if you want to change it up. Baking time is iffy, depends on your zucchini I think. I made square muffins & didn't take long at all.

Rating: 3
I'm giving it 3 forks because if you like sweet cornbread this is a great one as written. I did follow the advise of others and baked in a 9x9 square pan without the garnish and it was done in 35 minutes. I'll be making again with much less sugar and addition of more savory ingredients like corn,jalapeno's, cheese, chives, parsley etc. Love the brown butter flavor and easy way to use up some of my excess zucchini/yellow squash!

Nice alternative to the usually too sweet zucchini breads I've made in the past. I used canola oil instead of butter but it still tasted buttery.

We grow alot of zucchini and I am always looking for new ways to use it. This recipe is fantastic! I only had white whole wheat flour so I used that instead of the regular whole wheat. I also grated the zucchini on the small side of the grater and next time I will chop it further to cut out the strings. I was pressed for time so I made mini muffins instead of a loaf (no garnish on top) and baked them for 20 minutes. Great breakfast or brunch accompaniment and they got rave reviews from my guests!

I really enjoyed this! I didn't have wheat flour, so I just used all purpose flour and I used a 9x9 pan and baked for 35 minutes. Turned out great!

Delicious and moist. Opted for a sweet version and added 1c sugar.I liked the taste of the brown butter and tang of buttermilk.All I had in the pantry was AP flour and coarse cornmeal, so it was smooth texture w/ crunch!No slices on top. Baking time 50 min.I want to try it savory next time w/ browned sausage and jalapeno,like another reviewer did, adding some grated cheddar on top.So many zucchini breads, so little time!

Wow! I love cornbread, and my husband & I agreed this was the best cornbread we've ever had. The zucchini kept it incredibly moist, and the crust had a nice crunch to it. This will be my go-to cornbread in the summer when my zucchini plants are going crazy.

I made this cornbread yesterday with the first fresh picked zucchini's from our garden and was disappointed with the outcome. I followed the recipe and found it to be very bland and lacking any flavor of corn. Next time I plan to add fresh corn, jalapeno's and grated cheese or I will decide to look for a different recipe altogether.

Had ingredients on hand so baked it this afternoon. Used a 9 x 9 inch pan with no garnish - only added chopped parsley to the ingredients - delicious ! Definitely a keeper plus it's very easy to put together.

RIDICULOUSLY YUMMY! Used all white flour, didn't bother sifting everything, just mixed all the dry before adding the wet. Didn't use the zucchini slices on top b/c other reviews...and used a drop less butter. So easy and so delicious.

Yummy cornbread!! Note that this is a very sweet cornbread - you can easily cut the amount of sugar. Also, to solve the not-cooking in the middle problem: bake in a 9x9 pan instead of a loaf pan. Worked great and actually cut the cooking time nearly in half. If you wanted to make this more savory, adding herbs like chives or parlsey would have been great. I'm doing that next time.

This cornbread was fantastic! I used all white flour and skim milk with lemon juice in place of the buttermilk, and it turned out perfect. It was so good, my family forced me to make it a second night in a row.

The cornbread had great flavor--I imagined it would be more savory, but it actually tasted like a sweet cornbread to me. I had trouble as some others had mentioned with it cooking all the way through the center--particularly under the garnish, but it could have been that I had too much zucchini. Next time, I will try with a smaller zucchini and see if my results come out better. It isn't going to waste though; we put a slice in the toaster oven and it is perfect with dinner!

Rating: 4
This was very moist and delicious. I substituted a gluten-free flour blend for the all-purpose and whole wheat flours and I added some chopped rosemary. I found it took 1 hr. 10 minutes in the oven before it was cooked all the way through. Next time I'll skip the zucchini slice garnish, as I found the slices a little stringy and unappealing.

Rating: 0
This bread is absolutely amazing. It was devoured by all with many compliments. My only problem was that the zucchini slices on top caused the bit just beneath to be a little under-cooked. My slices must have been too thick. If you go with the decoration, I would recommend paper-thin slices!

Rating: 4
We really enjoyed this recipe. I made it with no variations and was delighted with the results. It really is a great balance between sweet and savory. While not as sweet as the classic zucchini bread, it lends just the right amount to seem decadent. And the butter makes it all the better. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This is a decadent cornbread, one you could easily eat as dessert! The browned butter lends a wonderful caramel, nutty taste, while the zucchini (squash in my case) provides extra moisture for a very tender cornbread. I made the recipe as written, with the exception of the squash substitution. I agree that the sugar could be reduced though. I baked mine for 55 minutes but it was still a little soggy in the middle, despite the tester coming out clean. I will definitely be making this again with the summer abundance of zucchini and squash.

Rating: 4
Very good and easy to make. I actually made it a bit more savory so it could serve as a meal with salad. I took 2 years of corn and 2 spicy sausage and sauteed them. I added in some grated carrot and a jalapeno pepper and reduced the amount of sugar to 1/3 C but I think it could have been reduced even more to 1/4 C. I also reduced the amount of butter called for by 1/3 and it was still nice and moist. I served it with a green salad and it made a great summer meal.
