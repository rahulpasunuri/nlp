Very boring sauce. Typical of a bad chain restaurant. Husband says he would give it 2 forks.

My family loved this recipe! I can't eat fish so I made it with chicken which I marinaded in the soy sauce and sherry before cooking. And I used zucchini, squash, mushrooms and green onions for my vegetables. I added more sugar then it called for but other then that I LOVED the sauce.

Positively delicious and very easy to make. I served it with white rice and steamed green beans and everyone loved it. Do try this recipe.

The fish itself was just OK. I had to substitute tilapia for the fish because my market didn't sell sea bass right now and this is what was suggsted. I usually find tilapia too bland, so maybe this was the problem. The vegetable topping and sauce was delicious. I will make the sauce again and use with something else, or make a lot of it and serve over jasmine rice for a light dinner.

Very good. I used a striped bass I caught off the coast of Maine and was very pleased with the results. I did find that I did not use all of the sauce in the stirfry though - there seemed to be too much.

this was fast and delicious. so nice not to have to fry the fish. flavours of the marinade were great. i made this for 2 but still went with lots of veg. added asparagus and broccoli and used veg stock instead of chick soup.a winner!

This was a great dish, definitely for the ginger lover. My husband loves Chinese food and it was like what a good Chinese restaurant would serve. However, I could not find Sake at my local grocery, so I used a good Chardonnay, next time, I will try the Sake. I will make this again!

Delicious fish! I used rockfish, since sea bass is currently overfished. It was even better the second day. I didn't make the vegetables but will try them next time.

loved it, double the ginger for extra zip. used tuna (looked better than the sea bass), any fatty fish would work well.

Delicious if you like ginger. I substituted brocolli for the mushrooms also. Next time I'll use less carrots and brocolli and add a third vegetable to the stir fry.

The fish is good. The jasmine rice was a good idea, however, it took more water than the package suggested and I nearly burned it. The veggie stir-fry needs half that much wine and a couple of teaspoons of sugar. Other than that, very interesting.

Made this last nite - it was wonderful however made some substitutions - red onion and broccoli for the stir fry vegetables....also, added some more balsamic vinegar and sugar - can't wait to serve this again - presentation was beautiful over garlic mashed potatoes.

Marvelous fish!! I would replace the mushrooms with brocolli, green beans and/or asparagus. Keep the carrots for color.

Fantastic flavor, went together quickly and easily, and didn't wreck the diet. I used halibut since sea bass wasn't available and substituted sherry for sake, which I didn't have. This recipe would probably work well with any mild white fish. Steamed jasmine rice was perfect to catch the extra sauce and veggies.

This recipe is a winner. Since I'm not crazy about mushrooms I add zuccini instead and serve the fish over garlic mashed potatoes which soak up the sauce. It's a FABULOUS dish for entertaining.

I replaced it with a whole fish and it turned out great. There may be too much carrots being asked for. My family loved it.

This is my 1st 4-fork review. This dish was superb, truly the best sea bass I've ever eaten. Sea bass is $$$, I paid $15/lb., but it was worth every penny.

I have made this numerous times and each time have been begged for the recipe. I barbecue the sea bass making a slightly crisp exterior and also it's wonderfully moist inside. Wonderful for a small dinner party.

I HAVE MADE THIS DISH SEVERAL TIMES. I HAVE ALSO USED ORANGE ROUGHY WHEN SEA BASS WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THE PRESENTATION IS GREAT AND THE AROMA IS INTOXICATING. PLAIN STEAMED RICE IS ALL THAT IS NEED TO COMPLETE THE MAIN COURSE. EVERY TIME I HAVE SERVED IT THE COMPLEMENTS NEVER STOP.
