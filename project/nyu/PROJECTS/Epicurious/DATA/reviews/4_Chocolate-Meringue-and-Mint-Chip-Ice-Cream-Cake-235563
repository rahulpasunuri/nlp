Like others suggested I froze the softened icecream on parchment squares, and used twice as much whipped cream. Except for the whipped cream I halved the recipe for just me and my husband. Very good, very sweet! When it came to making the meringues the "folding" the cocoa powder part was really difficult, so I just continued whipping it all together. As far as I know, the meringues turned out fine that way. Used a little cocoa powder to sprinkle on top because I didn't have chocolate shavings or sprinkles. That worked out good for me, because like I said, the cake is very, very sweet and decadent. All in all great recipe, will make again!

Made as 2nd Thanksgiving dessert. BIG hit! I made a couple of modifications based upon preview reviews here. (1) Used 1-1/2 Qts. of ice cream rather than only 2 pints; (2) Slightly softened ice cream, then drew two 4-1/2" x 12" rectangles on parchment paper and placed it on a baking sheet. Spread the ice cream on the 2 rectangles and froze. Assembly was VERY easy using this method. (3) Cut with electric knife and it was a snap to do. Will definitely make again, perhaps with vanilla/fudge swirl ice cream as a few guests aren't fond of mint flavor.

This recipe is very simple and very tasty! Have made it a few times with different ice cream flavors. Peppermint ice cream is so good!

Impressive & easy dessert! The chocolate meringue was easy to make and a great complement to the mint ice cream. Baking the meringues takes some time, but assembly is a snap! To save time, I drew 4 1/2 x 12" meringue rectangles and softened the ice cream and refroze in a 9x12 baking pan with plastic wrap. I cut the block of ice cream in half lengthwise and created a perfect stack in minutes. I doubled whipped cream and used sprinkles I had on hand, but agree chocolate shavings would be better. All my guests loved it... I will try again, maybe with a different ice cream flavor.

Worked out perfect. One additional suggestion is to buy ice cream in a box and slice into rectangles to lay on top of meringue. Time saver. I also softened the remaining ice cream and 'iced' the entire slab. This helped later to adhere the whip cream. Also I put it back in the freezer after I put the whip cream on for 10 mins so it melted slower when presented. Very tasty and quite a success. It cut better with a serrated knife as well.

This is a fantastic dessert for entertaining! It looks beautiful assembled. My only complaint is that it fell apart when I was cutting it - not sure if I was doing something wrong. I spread the ice cream on parchment paper and froze it like one reviewer recommended. That was a great recommendation! I agree that you need alot more chocolate if you want it to look like the picture. I made it according to the recipe and my meringue was a light brown color. I also used chocolate shavings rather than sprinkles. I doubled the whip cream for the top and it seemed like the right amount. I used Trader Joes mint chip ice cream, which is white. It gave it a different look than the picture...but in a good way. Everyone raved about this dessert. two of my kids asked if I would make it for their birthdays. Defintely a winner!

This is a showy dessert. I served it for a holiday dinner. My guests were incredibly excited by it. It's delicious and gorgeous. Also very light, so it's perfect at the end of a rich meal. I softened the ice cream slightly. I didn't let it get runny. Then I scooped it onto the meringue and let it soften further there until it was soft enough to spread easily and smooth into a flat-top layer. Be sure to put the top layer on upside down, so you have a flat surface to spread with the whipped cream. I put the whipped cream and sprinkles on just before serving, so they were soft and light.

This is really good! My son wanted this for his birthday dessert -- my wife liked it so much that she wants it, too. It is a little sweet, maybe, but not too difficult -- a real keeper.

This was an excellent dessert! The reviewer who suggested spreading out the softened ice cream on the cookie sheet and freezing was brilliant. It worked like a charm for assembly. I did not have time to leave the meringues in the the oven over night but started it first thing in the morning to serve in the evening and it was fine. After baking, I left in the oven on off for about 1 hour and just opened the door slight for another hour or so before assembly. I then had the whole thing in the freezer for 2+ hours. It did not seem to impact them at all.

Preparing this dish does indeed require some foresight, but it is absolutely delicious and well worth the work. This is one of my "show-stopper" desserts. I find it useful to stir the ice cream regularly while it's softening - this ensures that it doesn't get too runny and forces you to keep a close eye on it.

This dessert has a beautiful presentation. Parchment paper is a must, my meringue stuck a little bit and cracked; nothing the icecream couldn't heal. I topped the whip- cream with raspberries for color and used dark chocolate shavings instead of sprinkles for a more elegant presentation. When I discovered I was out of vanilla, I used the berries in the topping as well. It tasted great and all the flavors were complementry. Dessert is lovely with an Orange Muscat. Even my boyfriend who doesn't care for dessert loved it. It is very sweet and we ended up sharing our piece, but he loved it! This speaks very highly of the recipe!

I can't give this a fork rating yet, as it's still not complete, just wanted to propose another way to assemble the cake. I found that by the time the ice cream was soft enough to spread without destroying the meringues, it was running down the sides of the cake. I think if I made this again I would create the ice cream layers in the same fashion as the meringues. Using a similar sized pattern, I plan on creating the ice cream layers while the ice cream is rather hard, so I can create clean, solid layers. I'll place them in the freezer to make sure they're good and frozen for handling, then I'll simply lay them on top of the meringues. In addition to solving my runny ice cream problem, I think this would cut down on the overall time necessary to prepare this, as the ice cream layers could be prepared during the 4 hours that the meringues are cooking.

This is wonderful. Not being a fan of mint ice cream- we used "Cherires Garcia" instead and sprinkled shavings of dark chocolate over top instead of the chocolate sprinkles. PS- we made the meringue 2 days before becasue we had to travel- they were fine.

Although this recipe was a little time consuming, it was well worth it! My family loved it and the presentation was beautiful. May need to add more cocoa than the recipe calls for if you want desired dark chocolate color for the meringue.

The meringue is time-consuming, but this dessert goes together in a snap after that and it looks beautiful and tastes wonderful1

Does take four hours to bake meringue but well worth it. Very tasty. Am considering other ice cream flavors.
