We thought this was really yummy - but not filling enough to be a main course. As suggested by others, I added extra garlic. Next time, I would add chunks of chicken to make it more filling as a main dish.

So simply, suprisingly flavorful. Superb in a pinch; one normally has all of the ingredients on hand.

This was a great meal. Delicious and flavorful. And so simple. I added a bit more hot pepper flakes and used 4 cloves of garlic as a previous person suggested. The lemon is the secret ingredient but in the exact proportions of the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I think I didn't have the temperature hot enough to cook the garlic -- I'll fix that next time.

We loved this dish & its simple to make. Next time I would steam the broccoli, we didn't like the blanched taste. I used 4 cloves of garlic, a bit more cheese, and added some shredded basil. Yum.

Very good. Light in weight and flavor. Great for a summer dish.

Quick and easy to toss together for an impromptu yet elegant dinner. This is a trusted stand-by for our kitchen.

Quick and easy. I added a little more lemon juice at the end. You could even give it more flavor by adding a mix of greek spices.

This is good, but don't expect too much out of it. It's light, but almost too light. I added another handful of parmesean mixed in with the pasta. Next time I will definitely add more garlic, and maybe some more lemon juice and some fresh basil or some tomatoes.
