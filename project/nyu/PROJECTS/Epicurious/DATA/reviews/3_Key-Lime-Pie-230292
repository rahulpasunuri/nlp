I made per recipe but did increase amount of juice to almost 1 cup. Maybe a touch more zest as well. Guests loved it but I was not keen on the texture. Rather dry and I even undercooked it by at least 15 minutes. I will look for a smoother version.

This was delicious, and pleasantly surprising -- more like chiffon than the custard texture of typical key lime pie. It's a very light and refreshing dessert for summer. I used chocolate graham crackers and added 2 T. sweetened ground chocolate to the crust mixture. The combination of flavors was pleasing.

This pie has an intense lime flavor that goes great with coffee or espresso. I used regular condensed milk and it came out with a cheese cake-like taste and consistency.

This wasn't worth the limes we sqeezed to make it, next time I will just make a real lime pie and have smaller slices- atleast it'll be edible.

This was very good. Surprisingly good. I served this to 6 close friends who all wanted the recipe. Except for the fewer eggs and the coolwhip, this recipe is very similar to the other key lime pie recipe on this site. It's tangy and delicious but just healthy enough that I can serve it to my husband who's on a low-cholesterol diet. I'll be making this again, certainly.

This is pretty good and tastes like a light cheesecake. It is good served warm.
