I didn't end up frying these--I had the broiler going (didn't want to make another pan dirty), placed them on a baking sheet and drizzled olive oil over them, broiling them for about 10 minutes until they were golden brown on top--great! Next time I will add a pinch more salt to them, but otherwise, yum!

I made this as a side dish and it was wonderful. One thing that helped with the moisture was laying out the shredded zucchini on several layers of paper towels, sprinkling them with salt and letting them sit for 30 minutes or so. The salt helped draw out the moisture and made it easy to squeeze away any excess water. Make sure you do this after adding the lemon juice so the zucchini does not brown.

I'm a real estate agent, so not too much time to cook! Made this for family and clients on Christmas Eve, everyone LOVED them. I even forgot the parmesan cheese and they were terrific !

maybe I didn't do it right, I dunno. I drained and drained til I could drain no more. The zuchini was still really watery. It came out tasting VERY fried-like. Don't think I would make again

wow, were these ever good. i underestimated the importance of draining the zucchini and potato, though, so the latkes weren't of the texture that i wanted. my bad. next time i'll drain them better. i ate them with yogurt mixed with some lemon juice and dill, and apple sauce instead of sour cream and mmmm! very good.

I will try this recipe because I grew up eating latkes. But please tell Ms. Nathan that she "wrung" out the potatoes!!

These were really very tasty! My hubby loooved them! They're a nice departure from regular potato latkes. They were light and had a great texture. I brought them to a Chanukah celebration last night and they got rave reviews. I think you will enjoy them!

Even though I did not follow this recipe exactly these were by far the best latkas I have ever tasted. All agreed by the family as well. I used two potatoes, two zucchinis,1 egg, no salt, no sugar, no lemon juice or parsley. I pressed the garlic and grated the onion into the grated potato and zucchini mixture before I pressed the liquid from it. I added a bit of flour , the cheese and black pepper and fried it in olive oil. The latkas were light, flavorful and healthy. We topped them with sour cream.Easy as that!!

These latkes were the hands down winner at our Hanukkah celebration this year. Lighter than potato latkes and colorful too! We plan to make them part of our Hanukkah tradition. Our trick for getting the moisture out of latkes (in general) is to scoop up a handful of "batter" at a time. Compress the mixture between both hands, as if forming a small softball. The excess moisture has nowhere to go but out.

The parm. cheese make these creamy and delicious--they were a much bigger hit than either the potato or apple latkes I served that evening. As the first reviewer said, just make sure you squeeze all the excess moisture out to ensure proper cooking.

These latkes were absolutely delicious, but it was difficult to get all the excess moisture out of the batter prior to frying, and they therefore cooked poorly and fell apart. I will make more of an effort to squeeze out the zucchini next time.

Second time I made it,I decreased the pepper slightly.
