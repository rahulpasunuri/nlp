This tastes just as good the next day, if you're lucky enough to have leftovers. I added some halved grape tomatoes on top for a little extra color. Definitely a favorite that I will return to.

Love this dish, it is also great for camping- put it in the marinade then in foil- put it over your camp fire in a grill basket- and yum- I add extra parmesan cheese, garlic & crushed red pepper flakes to mine.

This is a very yummy asparagus dish and is nice for presentation. Super easy to make too - just be sure not to boil the asparagus too long.

Made this to accompany tenderloin for company, and everyone raved! Can't wait to make and serve again.

This is the best. We served this tonight along with BBQ chicken burgers, carmelized onions and crispy roasted red potatoes. Everybody absolutely loved the asparagus so now I am back to e-mail the recipe to those who enjoyed it tonight! We had a very happy Mother's Day and four forks up for this wonderful dish!

Wow, what a strong dressing - but it's quite good. It also looks pretty when lightly drizzled across the asparagus spears. I agree that the croutons don't seem necessary. I personally prefer a greater proportion of lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, which conveniently happens to make the dressing less viscous at the same time.

this was very good over green beans as well. I found that I needed to add quite a bit more oil than stated to get it to a pouring/drizzling consistency. As such, I adjusted the other ingrediants as well. Very good taste-used the extra as a delicious salad dressing!

Disappointed. The dressing was too strong for the mild flavor of the asparagus. I agree with another reader that the croutons should be eliminated as the textures were not compatible.

This was an easy recipe and the flavors go well together. We served it with a beef tenderloin.

Simple and delicious. No need for the croutons.

Simple, quick and easy to prepare, this dish would win over even the most avowed "asparagus hater"! The first time I made it, I didn't have dijon mustard; I substituted "Dijonnaise", dijon mustard mellowed with mayonnaise and it was great!

My guests raved and Epicurious gained another cook. But I stirred the dressing into the asparagus, and I thought it was too strong that way. I'll try drizzle and go a little lighter on the very tasy dressing.

Even people not fond of asparugus thought this was delicious, the sauce really complemented the spears. Very good.

This is the perfect dish for company because it is easy, fresh, and can be entirely prepared ahead of time. It's so good, people asked for the recipe. I left out the croutons. The dressing can even be made a day or two ahead of time.
