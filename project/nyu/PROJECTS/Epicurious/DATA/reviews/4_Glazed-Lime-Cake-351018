i made this with a friend for a at home bake night, and for that it was perfect. it does have some wait time for cooling, etc., but it was not so overly long that we couldn't have fun making it together. it was also a good size for two to have a good sized piece and then split the leftovers for another piece later. we agreed to double the syrup, which made it extra limey and moist, but i would only recommend doing that if you are really into VERY moist cake, as it was almost wet at that point with syrup and icing. also, we added lime zest to the cake batter itself. i don't know why it isn't in there already, but i can't imagine this being that great without it. it wouldn't taste nearly as limey and amazing, i don't think. so those of you who weren't wowed by the lime flavor, try adding zest to the cake and doubling the syrup. :-)

i had never made a cake before that only used powdered sugar... it turned out almost like a sponge cake which was a nice surprise! it was quite delicious and i would definitely make it again. modifications: i didn't make the icing because i didn't feel like cooling the cake twice so i just spooned all of the "lime syrup" onto the cake itself. also, as a person who usually reduces the sugar content in baked goods somewhat, i would say that the cake itself really does need 1.5 cups powdered sugar, especially if you're not making the icing. however, if you are making the icing, you could reduce the amount of sugar in the cake.

I made this cake for a mid-May BBQ and I loved it... so did many of the other guests. The fresh lime flavor is really refreshing. Served along with strawberries... it's a nice way to kick off summer. I made it in a bundt pan and it came out beautifully.

Will definitely make again because it was fairly simple and full of flavour. My lessons from this are not to overcook the cake. Mine looked uncooked: too pale in colour and not browned, so I gave it a few more minutes before I tested it. It was too much. Still, it turned out well. Also, my lime peels (using a zester) were too large and dark against the cake since the cake itself has a delicate appearance so I will make sure my lime peel is much smallernext time. Finally, although this recipe is classified as quick and easy, the additional steps of cooling, icing, then cooling were more than I had hoped for, even though the instructions acturately reflected how long it would take.

I had a bowl of limes I needed to use up and came across this recipe. Being in Australia I wasn't sure what powdered sugar was... but a google search soon had me using icing sugar. I did not have a square tin but used a circular ring tin. I worked a treat and everyone loved it. Can't wait to make it again!

Mine fell in the middle as well. It was almost as if there was too much air in the middle because as soon as I poked the holes it sagged.

Why did my cake sink in the middle? I did have the butter and eggs room temperature and I did use self rising flour. It tastes very good, the appearance is very unattractive with the hole in the middle.

I was very pleased with the result. I used lemon instead of lime, and modified my AP flour with baking powder and salt as previous reviewers suggested. My cake was moist and tasty, but a bit crumbly. The syrup/glaze was delicious.

Quick. Easy. Great results. Zest in the glaze makes a nice presentation. I thought it would look nice in a round cake pan, but the center was gooey. I'll follow the recipe next time. Great lime flavor.

I have saved this recipe for a year, waiting for the key limes in my garden to mature, thinking this would be the perfect use for them. I was very disappointed...it was fine, but we did not find it anything special.

Delicious. It is like a lemon cake (as a previous reviewer mentioned) that I have had, but I really like the lime.

my family liked this recipe since it really refreshing with the lime. i just used the half the amount of butter and it came out moist and delicious. will make this again!

Also, I used just plain flour and it was still fab! No other mods.

Loved it - added some zest and a bit of lime juice to the batter. Served with sweetened strawberries & the plates were clean! Very refreshing cake that makes you happy Spring is here at last...

love this little cake. it actually gets better the more it sits, tastes like a donut! i did add some extra zest but i like lime!

Loved the simplicity of this recipe and it would be equally as tasty if frosted.

This was a great little cake! I substituted navel orange for the lime (it took about 1 orange to get enough juice). It took minutes to put together and the end result was quite nice. Moist and fluffy with a cap of sweet orange icing. Will make again although perhaps with the syrup only (not the icing).

I would have used half the zest that was recommended (too tart in some places) but besides that this recipe was delicious.

This is similar to a lemon cake my mom used to make from a box of yellow pudding cake, only much better. My husband adored it and it was gone in 15 minutes. I used 2 limes and one lemon (from my own trees) and used zest in the cake mix to give it even more flavor. Terrific! My only complaint was the call for self-rising flour, which I have never seen before. Thankfully I was able to access the reviews here to see how to make this flour with baking powder and salt. Seems silly to call out a special flour in a recipe that was supposedly cost-conscious!

i thought the cake tasted excellent. i made mine in a bundt pan instead of a square pan because i like pretty designs on my cakes. i also added lime to the batter to give the cake more of a lime taste and used cake flour instead of the self rising flour. it made the cake extremely moist so i had to be careful taking it out of the pan. it was gone in a matter of seconds. i would definitely make this cake again.

My family and I love this cake! We have made it three different ways (lime, lemon, and peppermint). Lemon is our favorite, though they have all been moist and light and delicious. After the first time around, I made these alterations to the recipe: did not use zest (though I like the idea of adding it to the cake batter that another reviewer mentioned), and did not skewer it because it made it a little too wet over time.

This recipe is great! I made it for a morning birthday coffee late the night before after a disaster with a double batch of Chocolate Molten cakes. I took the recipe through the poke and pour stage and then glazed it in the morning. People loved it and it was not dry at all. I did use more syrup than 3 Tablespoons and I used a combination of fresh lime and lemon juice as I did not have enough lime. I made self rising flour out of All Purpose by adding baking soda and salt. I think those two choices kept the cake from being dry. Hail to the Lime!

This cake was great! The recipe is incredibly simple and fast. And mine actually came out very moist. I prepared the batter exactly as instructed and was worried it would be bland with so few ingredients, but nope! Good simple cake, and the lime syrup and glaze give it enough of a punch. You could try this with any citrus fruit - grapefruit would be interesting! yumm

This was not anything special. The fact that it was a lime cake and not a lemon cake was the only thing that made the cake interesting and the recipe worth keeping. The cake was dry, and the green zest in the icing made it not very attractive.

This cake is fabulous. However, I would double the lime syrup before you add the powdered sugar. It was delicious.

I will disclose that I followed the instructions to a tee and I used a light metal 8X8 square pan. For those who experienced crumbling or a scone type texture, I would recommend not using a glass pan, if that is what you did. I would also recommend a wonderful book called Pure Dessert by Alice Medrich. Its a great resource for the novice baker. She gets into a lot of details about the type of bake ware to use for specific types of baking. Though I didnt experience a scone like texture, the interior of my cake, though ok, wasnt as moist as I would have like. I love the lime taste though. My topping turned out perfect! I couldnt eat it without drinking some sort of liquid with it though. For the chefs out there, should I have used more butter or more egg to achieve a moist interior? Again, I followed the directions. My cake actually looks just like the picture, so my presentation was great!

I loved this cake. I did not have self-rising flour but you can make your own - for one cup of all purpose flour add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My cake was not scone-like at all but a perfect texture. I wonder if some of the other problems people had were due to not using the flour the recipe called for. It does matter, baking requires preciseness when measuring and using ingredients. My icing did not look like the picture; it was clear instead of white. The taste was wonderful, especialy if you like citrus desert. I like the fact that it was made with limes - you get a lot of lemon cake recipes but very few that use limes. This cake was easy to make, you just need to allow enough time for it to cool before icing. I will be making this one again!

I used all the zest in the cake batter, adding it to the flour so it wouldn't clump up. I double the lime glaze. I also used a round pan, and removed it to a cake plate before glazing. A nice fast cake for company.

I actually made this on a whim while dinner was cooking, didn't have limes so used meyer lemons instead. I thought it was incredibly quick and easy to make, so a great easy way to a have a little cake on hand. I like that we can substitute whatever citrus is on hand also. The cake was pretty light (not at all scone-like as other reviewers have said), could maybe use a little citrus juice in the batter though- I did add zest in the batter at the last minute. Also I prefer to heat up the juice-sugar-zest mixture to make it a little more like marmalade before pouring it over.

Very limey and a little bit eggy but still great! I would use less egg next time.

Good Golly Miss Molly! This cake is fantastic! I didn't have limes so I used oranges, but my 15 year old son has eaten most of the cake already. I can see that this will be a frequently made dessert!

This was simple, but it was not great. I will not make it again. It did not look like the picture and there was nothing remarkable about the flavor. It was fine, and definitely better than having no cake at all, but not a keeper.

Very simple and tasty cake! My icing turned out to be mostly absorbed into the cake (doesn't quite look like the picture), but I think it made it moist and tasty. It also takes more than 30 minutes to prepare if you grate the zest and juice the limes yourself. Enjoy!

if texture was like a scone and not a cake -- you probably used all purpose flour; recipe calls for self-rising flour. For each cup of all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and you'll have self-rising flour.

This was a good cake recipe. No problem with the cake holding its shape at all.

This was terrible. I thought I followed the recipe to the letter but maybe I did something wrong. It turned out so crumbly that we can only eat it with something liquid. The crumbs themselves won't even stick together.

The cake is fairly dense and resembles an American style scone. My husband suggested that it would make a great breakfast/brunch cake served along with coffee.

I decided to make this because it looked simple and I had most of the ingredients on hand. It turned out to be as simple and delicious as the recipe promised. Cake is moist and not overly sweet. The lime sugar juice and frosting provides a subtle tangy sweetness to the cake. Fans of lemon bundt cake will enjoy. I used a loaf pan instead of the 8 inch cake pan so I had to bake it for about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe called for. I think the cake tastes better a day later after it has had time to absorb the lime sugar juice.

This turned out great. Its a very simple tasting cake - the cake was light and the glaze was really tangy. A nice combo. I served it with whipped cream. I think I used more lime juice than was called for, so the glaze was much more transparent than in the picture above. Its not the prettiest looking because the green bits sort of make the cake look like it has bits of broccoli all over it. Definitely looked better cut into pieces served with a bit of whip cream on the side. I'll for sure make this again - maybe try a version with a lemon raspberry type of sauce/glaze.
