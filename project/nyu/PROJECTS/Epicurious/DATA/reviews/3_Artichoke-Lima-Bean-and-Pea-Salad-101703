This is a great combination. I used Greek yogurt instead of cream and added extra vinegar and a speck of onion powder and garlic powder to the vinaigrette. Excellent.

I was anxiously searching for a recipe for the Persian Lima Beans I had soaking one rainy Saturday afternoon, and found this one. It seemed like a very unlikely combination of ingredients, but I gave it a shot, and would have to say this is a winner. The only substitution I made was to use garlic in place of the scallions. It was much better the next day, and I definitely prefer it served warm. YUM!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I also subsitute dijon mustard for the cream and a good Italina salad dressing for the plain olive oil. It had an excellant flavor and my family loved it. I will make this again.

I substituted dijon mustard for the whipping cream, and added a little lemon juice and some dill to the vinaigrette. I needed only one can of chicken broth and didn't heat the artichoke hearts. These changes made for a more flavorful and firmer textured dish, which was pretty popular. Some people even asked for the recipe. I will definitely make it again!

I made this as one of several sides for a large party. Very successful and very flavorful. I did have to make one change - my father loathes green peas - and so I substituted chick peas (garbonzo beans) in place.

I must have missed something on this recipe!! Followed recipe to a tee. Took longer than said...flavor very bland. Pretty presentation but neede a punch. Added more shallots, dash of sugar and more mint. Still, blah!!! Won't make again.

I was surprised at how beautifully the flavors worked with each other. My guests went back for seconds and thirds and had to have the recipe, which I e-mailed to them from your web site. Not only was this delicious, it was quick and simple enough for any busy person to make at the last minute.
