Tried this on a whim because I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand. It was much more flavorful than I expected and the hubby LOVED it.

um, hard to figure out what the praise is about. I feel like this is the recipe for diet cabbage soup, plus some sausage. Good diet food, and whole cuisines are based on making use of what you have so you don't completely starve, but nothing to plan a recipe around.

Mmm! Turned out delicious, even with some substitutions. I didn't have any kind of broth on hand, so I used water and added an extra half teaspoon of salt, 1/4 cup chopped onion, a bay leaf, and a few shakes of granulated garlic to boost the flavor. No marjoram in the house either, so I used its cousin, oregano. I used red potatoes instead of the recommended varieties. For the sausage, I used a variety of Trader Joe's chicken sausages, including a very tasty smoked andouille. I also cut down the peas to 1 cup. Topped with a dollop of greek yogurt, it was SO wonderful and flavorful, even without the broth. A keeper!

Only ingredient I didn't have on hand was caraway seeds and I must say I don't think it hurt the dish at all. VERY good & simple as can be. A perfect fall/winter weeknight supper.

This is a very nice fall or winter meal. I substituted turnips for the green beans and strongly recommend not leaving out the caraway seeds if you want an authentic Bavarian dish. I think this would make six very meager servings; I think four servings would be more generous.

Really good, really simple - love it in the fall.

I did not have the caraway seeds but this was exceptional. I used a non-brined kielbasa that was only smoked. My husband ate this three meals in a row and is asking for more. Very easy to prepare on a week night after work.

I haven't made this recipe, yet, but am a great judge of ingredients, and cooking strategy. I recently spent some time visiting Germany, and this certainly looks like a dish that would be considered comfort food over there. However, using a variety of sausages, in this dish, would make this a more interesting meal, so find a good sausage maker and explore the possibilities.

This was great for my little Oktoberfest party, and though it's really hot here still it was great with a nice pils. As for the review below, I imagine that if you use all the correct ingredients and make sure you LIKE all the ingredients it will always come out at least 2-3 forks. In fact, it's so easy to prepare for the outcome that I may add it to my winter repertoire. ....Or maybe it's simply a reflection of the English palate. Blahhhh, worst cuisine of any country I've visited.

I really didn't see what the excitement was all about with this recipe. Was it because I used a different type of sausage or because I left out the peas and marjoram? OK and I forgot the parsley but it wasn't anything exciting and it reminded me that I don't like cabbage very much. I'd use these ingredients better somewhere else.

Very good, easy winter soup. Used Polish kielbasa and left out potatoes. For an extra decadent treat, put a tsp of sour cream in your serving before eating. Recipe seems to assume that homemade beef broth will have no salt, also. Flavors and texture similar to pot au feu.

Can't believe this hasn't been reviewed yet! It was really good -- there's an entire garden of vegetables, and so it's oh-so-healthy, and then there's some sausage to make it just a little naughty. It's great the first night. Even better the next day for leftovers.
