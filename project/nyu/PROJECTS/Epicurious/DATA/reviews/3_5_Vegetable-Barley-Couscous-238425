I first made this for vegan company and was completely blown away. Since then, I've probably made it at least a dozen times. I can't be happy until I find an easier way to do everything, so I usually used canned diced tomatoes and canned chickpeas (then adjust salt just before eating!), couscous from a box, and more ras el hanout. I also roast the almonds rather than frying them. Found what I think is a good ras el hanout blend and harissa by ordering online at The Spice House. These really make the dish! Next time I'll try wine and potatoes, as some reviewers have suggested. Made it once with bok choy instead of cabbage and it was lovely.

Totally delicious, but made 18000 servings.

so flavorful and well-balanced. not nearly as complicated as i thought. i used barley couscous out of the box, cooked separately, and did the stew in a 4-quart saucepan. next time i'll just do it in my 5-quart cocotte because it was a little tight in there. i cooked it partially covered, per the recipe, and only used half the water, substituting 1 of the cups with white wine. perfect. this dish is officially added to my repertoire.

Not as complicated as it sounds if you just make the broth and vegetables, and then use couscous out of a box, which only takes 5 minutes to cook.

Followed the recipe exactly and the result was nothing short of AMAZING. Exactly like the couscous you get at a true moroccan restaurant in Paris, maybe even better? Absolutely delicious!

Fantastic soup. I recently ate this soup at a Moroccan restaurant in Paris and wanted to recreate it. This recipe nearly blew me away. I followed it exactly. The only change I made was to use potatoes instead of the turnips.

Fantastic vegetarian food! Don't let the complex sounding nature of it scare you away--I do not cook the couscous their way, but instead use whole wheat and cook it like the box suggests. This is a favorite and I have made this numerous times--my family as well as guests. Version of Ras Al Hout that I use: 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp cardamon, 3/4 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp White pepper, 1/2 tsp coriander, 1/2 tsp nutmeg

i did the best i could with this recipe - i couldn't find the ras-el-hanout or the harissa, so i found recipes online (see my other post) and tried to create them. i have no idea how close to the true thing they are. likewise, i couldn't find barley couscous anywhere, so i used whole wheat couscous and cooked them the normal way. the verdict: a wonderfully different flavor. my partner absolutely loved it and said it was one of the best recipes she's had in a long time. i thought it was good, but maybe because of all the work i put into it, i'm not as in love with it as she is. next time it will be easier to make and i will rate it higher.

I made this recipe with my former roommate who grew up in Algeria - he referred to this recipe as "Moroccan Cous Cous". Simply speaking, this is my #1 favourite vegan recipe ever! I have been vegan for almost 1 1/2 years and I love to cook, :)

What a unique recipe. I'm not really sure I cooked it correctly and I had to make adjustments as I didn't have the correct pan. I didn't think that the stew portion was adequately seasoned, however; when you put everything in a bowl, added the harissa, almonds and onions a fasinating event happen in relationship to flavour and texture. I found the dish very creative and enjoyed learning about so many new uses of spices. I will definitely be investigating the ethnic origins of this recipe and doing a little further experimenting.
