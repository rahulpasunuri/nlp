Two great recipes that are very easy. The bacon was fantastic and cooking in oven is so easy! The grits were a big hit as well. I used 6 minute grits and I used the amount of liquid called for on the box but instead of using all water, I made them with half water and half milk and cream mixed together. I added the cheese in at the end as called for by the recipe. They were very creamy and tasty.

No self-respecting Southerner uses instant grits. Whisk the grits for the first two minutes of cooking, constantly. If you brush the bacon with maple syrup and roast at a lower temp, you probably won't need grits or eggs.

This is my new favorite method of cooking bacon, the grits were... good... I don't really like grits, but the rest of the family thought it was all wonderful.

I have been making bacon in the oven for a long time. The bacon stays FLAT too. Use parchment underneath it makes easy cleanup too. I Like the idea of Rosemary consider other herbs too. As far as the grits use all milk or 1/2 milk and 1/2 & 1/2. If you have cream all the better. However doing it on a stove top can scorch the milk products. Consider using the microwave, Time depends on Qty made. Still add the cheese at the end. Use any that you have. If too thick add more milk. Have Fun!

Polenta and Eggs have been a favorite of mine for quite some time and the addition of Bacon would be yummy...But the Plate with the picture/painting of that insect on it would bother me. lol

Y'all use instant grits? Well, bless your hearts.... The rosemary was a very nice addition!

I loved this idea for a Sunday breakfast. The only thing I would change is to use regular grits instead of instant because I just don't like instant grits. It takes a little longer, but I don't mind. Other than that the flavors were great and I loved the idea of cooking bacon in the over. The scent of rosemary while cooking this meal made the whole house smell nice but was not overpowering with the bacon at all. In fact I thought maybe I should chop up the rosemary but it was fine.
