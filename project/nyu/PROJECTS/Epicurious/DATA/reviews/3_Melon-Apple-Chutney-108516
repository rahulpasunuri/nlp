This recipe is good & very adaptable. It tastes just like a good mincemeat filling. After taking it off the heat, to my horror,I realized that I had forgotten to add the fresh ginger but nobody seemed to miss it but me. Didn't have cheesecloth on hand so I used teabags of mulling spices, which worked out really well. Also, I used chopped dried figs instead of currants. I'm going to make a bigger batch tonight with ginger just so I can keep this tasty chutney on hand.

This was terrific with the ham and cornbread rounds. It kept for several days. I didn't have whole allspices so I used ground it worked fine.
