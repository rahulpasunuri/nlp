Oops, this is hardly rasmalai; in fact, it is anything but.... (Can I rate it as zero forks then?)

I attempted this recipe three times. Following the directions exactly left me with a pan of warm cheese with a a slightly-thicker-than-oatmeal consistency. The second attempt, using cupcake tins to hold each malai "dumpling" left me with 12 globs of cheese- same consistency as prior. Finally- I added two eggs to the recipe, and 1 brick cream cheese, blended very well and placed in individual cupcake tins with paper liners. It worked! The ras syrup was great. The malai inspired cheesecake-dumplings were heavenly. The book club loved them. I would make them again. But, as for the original, something to bind them seemed needed.

Yes, this recipe is a bit of a shortcut, but I've made similar recipes and they come out tasting quite close. Are you going to make the paneer from fresh milk, continuously mash it by hand until smooth, silky and lump free, make balls, cook them in sugar syrup, squeeze them out, reduce milk until the correct consistency, add spices, and then soak the balls? Traditional rasmalai is time consuming and tricky.

absolutely terrible recipe. rasmalai is made from fresh curds--they look like small ping pong balls to begin with.the milk and sugar mixture has to be slowly reduced --it becomes thick creamy and takes on a light mocha color fragrant and absolutely delicious. the small ping pong balls are also very creamy and soft and they absorb the wonderful milk-sugar syrup. the recipe is complete fraudulentand insults all the rasmalai makers.

I gave it three forks bacuase although it's simple and may not be truly authentic, it's easy and tasty! I have made it several times.

I agree, this is a dumbed down recipe... now i know the source for all the psuedo ras malai recipes online. Real ras malai involves shaping curds from whole milk into discs and cooking them in syrup, not baking.

Bad recipe. I cannot believe this has been entered as this not a recipe for Ras Malai. Can't believe this would be entered in a gourmet magazine!
