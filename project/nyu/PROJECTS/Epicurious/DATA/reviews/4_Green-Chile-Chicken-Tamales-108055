The flavorings in the chicken mixture is great, but as others mentioned, consider adding in a jalapeño or two to add a little more kick. I soaked 6 oz of corn husks and had enough leftover husks to make a second batch with this recipe, so take that into consideration when you are soaking the husks. I also cheated and purchased handmade "masa para tamales" from my local Mexican grocery store, so it definitely saved alot of time trying to make the masa dough. Otherwise, fantastic recipe, easy to do, and tastes great!

This was my first attempt at tamales and the results were great. I used pork in place of the chicken because I had a loin on hand that I slowed cooked. I steamed for 45 minutes, but with the leftovers I will try to steam longer as suggested by the other reviews. Otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Had plenty to freeze! I too would have liked more heat- so with the leftovers, I'll try making a spicy sauce to go with! Simple recipe with a lot of room for variations!

I think it was much better with beef or pork as they do not tend to dry out as much.I really enjoy beef the most.

I did everything the same except I used turkey broth instead of the chicken broth and shredded roasted tenderloin in place of the chicken. you can use corn oil instead of the olive oil.

This recipe was very reliable without having to make adjustments for things like proportions. The only aspect I found a bit disappointing was the low level of heat in the end product. I prefer tamales that are fairly spicy, and although my serranos were good, they were hardly felt in the end. When I make these again, I will double the amount of serranos, or perhaps include a jalapeño. The salsa verde is very good. Like others I made two batches to set one aside to use as a condiment. I divided those in two and added jalapeño to one to heat it to the level I am used to. It is a delicious salsa, but way too mild for my taste. However, I was serving a mixed crowd, some of whom rarely eat Mexican or Mexican American cuisine, so I left a batch as is.

I'd give this 10 forks if they'd let me...it was fabulous. My boyfriend and I worked on this together, and it took about 4 hours all together. It's not hard, just a lot of steps. The chile verde salsa was particularly amazing--we doubled that part of the recipe and made enchiladas a few days later. It will be our "go to" green sauce from now on. This is almost the same recipe as in Rick Bayless's "Mexico One Plate at a time". The main difference being the amount of time spent steaming. Since Rick agreed with other reviewers here, we went with 2 hours, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.

This is the absolute best tamale recipe. I always make double the amount of sauce and use the extra as a topping. I also like to top with crema or sour cream and lime and some feta cheese. Takes a bit of time, but so worth it!

I made this for guests from Mexico City and Havana and they raved about it. I also seeded the serrano chiles although the recipe did not specify. I don't think I have ever seen a recipe that uses the seeds from hot chiles. I also served the Slow-Cooked Carnitas Tacos, http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Slow-Cooked-Carnitas-Tacos-241855, which is a fabulous recipe.

Absolutely the best Chicken Tamale I have ever eaten or made! I am always in pursuit of fabulous tamales! The only problem with this recipe is that it needs to be doubled! Also, steam the tamales for about 2 hours, instead of the stated 45 minutes.

Delicious! Takes a bit of time, but well worth the effort. I'm freezing my leftover filling to use later for burritos or some such.

The sauce was fantastic. I will use this sauce for tacos and burritos. Used prepared masa purchased from the local Mexican market (Vallarta.) Took much longer than 45 minutes to steam, about 2 hours.

I made this vegetarian by omitting the chicken (threw in some bell peppers instead) and using Crisco and veggie broth instead of the other options. They got rave reviews from everyone, including some Latino friends.

This is an awesome recipe! I've made it 3 or 4 times now. The only thing that bugged me the first time was that after soaking 8 oz of dried corn husks, I only ended up using half that amount, and had nothing to do with the other half and had to pitch all the extra, wet husks. I was making pretty small tamales too. Anyhow, now I only soak about 4 oz, and for me it works out to be the right amount.

I liked this recipe a lot -- who knew so easy to make! Instead of a bird from the store, I braised and boiled a 1.5 lb. pork roast and 3 chicken leg quarters. this made really nice meat for the recipe. These are perfect to take to work or send to school for lunch.

This is truly scrumptious--a show-stopper that is not too complicate to make. I served the tamales with Mole Verde, which accompanied them well.

The chicken filling is delicious! But I find it makes twice the amount I need, so you could cut that in half or make twice the dough amount. I also found that I never end up using as much lard or chicken stock and the dough ends up very soft. That part of the recipe seems very flexible.

While slightly time consuming, I found this recipe to be easy and delicious. I added 1/2 # of monterey jack to the shredded chicken and tomatillo mix and the flavor was WONDERFUL! These will be a staple in my freezer from now on!

This was suprisingly easy to make. I was extremely intimidated because of rumors of how complicated and time consuming these are to make. I almost didn't even try. I used finely shreaded beef left over from enchiladas I made a couple of nights before. I let it soak and sop up the spicy sauce it stewed in. I used a half a cup of the juice and added it to the masa, in addition to beef broth instead of the chicken for the remaining moisture. I used vegtable shortning as called for in the recipie, and made the dough according to the recipie. The main point is the dough turned out wonderful, and my tamales look like tamales. As for how they taste...out of this world. They are the best I have ever had, which I can only attribute to the control I have over my ingredients and seasonings. I intend to try this with Chile Verde as well. My only advice, is to soak the husks over night.

I decided to make chile colorado machaca tamales with red ranchero sauce. I used 2.5 lbs. of beef chuck. Brown the meats on all sides, then put in crock pot, covered with water, and about 3 T of cumin. Left the meat in the crock pot all night on low. In the morning I strained the meat, and put it back in the pot, simmering in on low in 20 oz. of red chile sauce (available in cans). Also I added about 1/4 cup on onion. I used this as filling instead of the chicken. It was delicious topped with more sauce, diced onions and cheese.

Before going further I have to admit that I used prepared tamale dough from a small Mexican market in my home town instead of making from scratch. That said let me say this recipe is well worth the work. I now live in the midwest but am from Texas, where fabulous tamales are common place. Since they are impossible to find here I decided to make my own. These took almost all day but were totally worth the work, even my eight year old loved them. The flavors are wonderful, I might only ask if there is a good ranchero-type sauce recipe out there to complement. I will definately make again but double the recipe so there is plenty to freeze, these are WELL worth time intensive factor. Enjoy!

I just read the reviews and I want to comment on something that was said. I buy prepared masa for tamales at a local tortillaria and ALWAYS add beef broth, salt, and liquid shortening to it. Even when it is moist, it takes a lot to make it really good. I beat it in the KitchenAid for usually 45-60 minutes until it is ready. You can tell the masa is ready when a little ball of it floats in a glass of cold water. If it doesn't float, keep beating it until it does. The rest of the reciepe sounds really great though. Much like the chicken tamales my friends and I make. We usually make about 20 dozen or so at a time! Takes all day to make and then the boys and kids come over and boom! they're gone! Delicious!

Thank you to bKatzorke for your response to my question. Thank goodness I guessed correctly and did not add the additional lard! We served these tamales along side tamales purchased for Christmas Eve dinner. The purchased tamales could not even compare to these! These were wonderful.

I haven't used this recipe, but I just wanted to clear up some apparent confusion...If you are using the prepared MASA DOUGH (found in the refrigerator section of some markets)you do not need to add lard or broth-Masa, lard and broth is what makes the dough. The "prepared" Masa referred to in the recipe is the actual flour. The reason they refer to it as "prepared" is that it already has the salt and baking powder-you will still need to add lard and broth. Hope that helps!

Never made tamales before, but my son and I decided to try them over the holidays. These are yummy. Received wows from family and friends and have made them a couple of times since. The only thing I had trouble with was getting the husks softened. They definitely needed more than three hours to soak.

I am in the process of making the tamales, however I have a question . . . I purchased the prepared masa for tamales, which contains lard. Do I still need to add the additional lard/vegetable shortening, as called for in the recipe?

This was our first attempt at making tamales and they are a new hit at our house. My boys and husband loved them. I cooked the chicken ahead of time in the crock-pot in salsa. The tomatillo sauce with the cilantro was divine! I substituted butter for the lard (personal preference) and it worked great. The recipe was a little confusing (I've had no experience with these two ingredients) when it talked about fresh ground masa dough vs. using masa harina. It seemed like too much liquid but it worked great. My eight and twelve year-old sons helped me form them. What a treat it was and they're already asking when we'll make them again.

I didn't have tomatillos or chiles (MA in the winter is a drag), so I improvised a filling of the remaining ingrediants plus tomatoes (roasted w/garlic, fresh oregano, and chicken stock) and mashed fried plaintains. The result was sweet, gentle, and savory - my dinner guests were very enthusiatic. I also substuted butter for lard (personal preference) and it worked just fine.

you can expect to spend some time making real tamales- which is just what I did. these took a while in all, but was worth the effort. I made a double recipe to have lots left over to freeze. they were very light and flavorful and very well received!! will make again using smoked chicken and more spicy peppers for my personal preference!YUM!!!

Great tamales - I used a Costco chicken. Easy to make. Delicious

Time-consuming but good. I cut the shortening by about half and substituted the rotisserie chicken with 2 grilled chicken breasts which worked really well. I gave up on the ties and used kitchen twine instead - non-traditional but less of a pain. I have a bamboo steamer instead of a metal one so I ended up steaming the tamales horizantally - it cut down on the cooking time by about 15 minutes. I'd make this again but add some more chiles or even some cumin to spice it up a little.

My family loved these. The leftovers froze well and we just took right from freezer, wrapped in damp paper towel,and microwaved 2 1/2 mins to reheat.
