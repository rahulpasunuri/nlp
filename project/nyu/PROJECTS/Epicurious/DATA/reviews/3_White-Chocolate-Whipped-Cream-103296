I just finished making this for the first time and had no problems with the temperatures. I made the white chocolate mixture then put it in the fridge until just room temp, stirring occasionally. The whipped cream stayed in the fridge while I wasn't tending to it. I whipped the white chocolate in with a mixer until just incorporated. I thought the white chocolate flavor was very nice (I used Ghirardelli). Used this as a topping for a berry cheesecake.

What the successful makers of this recipe don't tell you is how they cool the chocolate. If you do it at warm kitchen temperature, 10 minutes will not be enough. If you cool it in the refrigerator, then 10 minutes might be too much. I just finished making the recipe and had mediocre results. After 10 minutes at room temperature, the chocolate was still warm. I knew that would melt the whipped cream. I put it in the frig for a little while and felt the temperature. I should have whisked it a bit (to mix in the small rim of solid chocolate that started to form on my bowl. Instead, I decided it was cool enough and came to realize that it was still too warm. The whipped cream was too soft to pipe, but it did hold it's shape. I'll do better next time. In terms of flavor, I'm inclined to agree with one reviewer who said it didn't have much flavor from the white chocolate. Maybe it needs vanilla???

First time making this recipe. I had the same problem with the nasty coagulated mess. Hmmm...followed the recipe perfectly. Am trying again; however, am thinking about just making plain whipped cream and then add a bit of the cream/white chocolate on top of plain whipped cream that both go on top my chocolate custard.

I'm surprised at the low rating for this whipped cream. I've made it many times now & have received rave reviews from my friends. I've used it for the chocolate pots de creme & for the double chocolate pudding, & it's outstanding every time. It's become a staple in my desserts!

I can only give this 2 forks as I failed in making this on my first try. Be very, very careful when adding in the white chocolate. You may want to even try folding it in. Just make sure you don't over mix it (don't use a machine, even for a second), or you'll wind up with drippy white chocolate butter. The taste was good, but I had to toss it as it's texture was that of wet, chunky butter and no one would touch it.

I'm not sure why others are having such a hard time with this recipe. If you follow the instructions as written you will end up with a lovely white chocolate flavored whipped cream with a slightly firm texture that gives it a lot of versatility. I have made this over and over again with beautiful results every time. It's wonderful instead of plain whipped cream as a topping for the Double Chocolate Torte on this site. As always use the best ingredients (E. Guittard white chocolate wafers are pricey but worth every penny) and you will be rewarded with standout results!

This was a fantastic recipe! The chocolately taste added a different dimension to plain old whipped cream. The slightly stickier texture made the cream ideal for icing a cake.

This was truly awful. It coagulated and had a terrible texture. A complete waste of time and expensive white chocolate.

The trick is not to overmelt the chocolate. This was a wonderful topping for pots de creme. I melted the chocolate in the microwave (20 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating) just until melted. The left overs were wonderful in our coffee next morning.

When we added the white chocolate, it kind of congealed and made the whipped cream lumpy. We ended up having to throw it out and just make plain old whipped cream.

The white chocolate was undetectable ~ tasted like regular whipped cream.

The white chocolate made the whipped cream too sweet. I'm not a fan of white chocolate, and detected no flavor in the whipped cream other than sweetness. I made this to use as decoration on the double chocolate layer cake. My guess is this recipe is meant to go with something specific, like the chocolate pots it is paired with. Anyway, I prefer good ol' whipped cream with a little sugar and vanilla.
