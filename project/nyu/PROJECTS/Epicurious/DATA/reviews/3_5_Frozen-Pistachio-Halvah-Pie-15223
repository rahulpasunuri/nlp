I've made this dessert since it was published in Gourmet almost 10 years ago. It is exotic and flavorful-- and very simple to make.

Had I presented this as the only dessert, it would have been more popular, I'm sure. But next to other more decadent (albeit more traditional) desserts, it was a shy wallflower. Tasty, yes. Different, yes. Very very easy, yes. (And yes, I love halvah.) One guest (of 20+) liked it better than the other desserts.

Superb flavor, lovely presentation, easy to prepare, and just different enough to elicit oohs and ahs. Just remember to room temp the pie for 15 min. to facilitate cutting. Have made this three times and it has always worked beautifully.

I had no problem with the pie freezing: in fact, I had to put it in the mirowave for 10 seconds to get a knife through it. My guests all love halvah and really enjoyed the pie. I used vanilla halvah and think the pie could have used slightly more sugar.

Wonderful recipe. I used soymilk instead of milk. I also added a handful of chocolate chips to the milk/sugar mixture because I bought vanilla halvah and then worried the pie would look bland. I gave it a nice mocha color. The only issue I had was that it never froze completely. I'm wondering if its my freezer. Did anybody else have this issue?
