This was really good considering it was so easy to make. I used a little extra cocoa powder, 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup coconut. The only thing I would change is the fact that the crust didn't seem to get cooked very well, it was still beige after the pie was set. Next time, I'll either start it at a higher heat, similar to when cooking pumpkin pie, or will par bake the crust for a few minutes before filling.

EXTREMELY EASY and friends were impressed, but i don't completely love chopped pecans and dried coconut and probably won't make it anytime soon.

This was just okay for me. I love German Choc cake, and this didn't have the same flavor that I was looking forward to. I might try this again with some tweaks (like maybe baking a little longer) as a last-minute pie, as I always have these ingredients on hand.

VERY easy to make and just a few ingredients. I like that. I made a 9" pie and felt that there could have been more filling, I will use 8" next time. Also, I baked it until set and tester was clean which took almost a full hour.

Yummy German chocolate cake flavor for a lot less work! My husband thought it was "interesting - kind of like pecan pie with strings." I explained that the "strings" were coconut. The chocolate flavor is very light, but I think that's OK in this pie. For 10 minutes of work, it's a keeper.

If you like coconut and chocolate combos, this recipe is too easy and good not to add it to a dessert collection. I had great reviews and several requests for the recipe.

Maybe it's just me, but I was disappointed with this pie. Very mild taste-nothing striking-and it didn't completely firm up.

Great for a summer dessert, but a little heavy.

Very very good, and very, very easy. My only problem was that it didn't completely firm up. Possibly I'd use less evaporated milk next time. But it is a great pie. (I've retried this recipe, and it was wonderful again. This time I only used a 5 oz. can of evap. milk with the same amounts of everything else.)

Great, simple pie! I too used 1/2 cup pecans and coconut. A quick and satisfying dessert.

This was a very easy recipe. I used the suggestion the cook from Columbia, MD made about using 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup coconut. I did not have to cook it longer. Afterwards, I felt that was an appropriate amount. It was good and better on the second day. It also made a nice presentation in a rib edged pie or quiche type dish. This was a good recipe for company dessert when you don't have much time.

Great- super easy. I increased the pecans and coconut to 1/2 c each. Had to cook longer-- but it may have been my oven. This is a must try!!

For those who say they will not serve this to guests, you are depriving them of a wonderful treat. I entered this pie in a pie bake-off and won first place! It had a delicate crisp top with smooth chocolate center. It is divine when warm too! However, I made it the second time and accidentally added too much flour and did not mix well enough and it was "curdily." Could this be a common mistake?

This was a wonderful pie! Everyone who tried it loved it! This recipe is a keeper!

Fabulous for a quick dinner, but not something I would serve to guests. Delicious, especially considering how quickly it came together. I made it with a Pillsbury refrigerator crust--I wonder how much better it might have been with a homemade crust?

This was outstanding. An easy pie to make and was delicious. Based on other reviewers comments I increased the pecans and coconut to 1/2 cup each. I didn't have self-rising flour so just added 1/4 teaspoon to my flour and the recipe worked just fine.

This was delicious and easy! It tasted like a warm brownie pie. In addition to it's wonderful taste, I had all the ingredients in my pantry. But it also satisfied my untamable hunger for chocolate. The only change I made was adding about 1/4-1/3 cup chocolate chips. Will definitely make this again when my family has a craving for chocolate or for any informal gathering of friends. This recipe is a real keeper.

I had great results, but I had to alter the recipe somewhat. I had no pecans or coconut, so I toasted cashews instead, and used coconut milk, adjusting for the thin coconut milk with 4 oz semisweet chocolate, and I cut the sugar a bit as well. It came out nicely textured, but rich in chocolate, so I'll cut the chocolate next time and just reduce more of the evaporated milk and coconut milk. Keeps well and goes nice with a light whipped cream or anglaise.

I made this pie took it to the office & it was gone in no time. As a matter of fact, I am making it again upon request. I did alter the recipe just a little by adding a dash more vanilla & "1/2" of coconut & pecans instead of the 1/3 cup called for in the recipe. I also saved time and used a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust - everyone thought it was homemade & took a great deal of effort.

My family does not like nuts, so I left them out, other that that I follwed the recipe. The pie was gone in one day! Defintely a keeper!

I hate giving this recipe just one fork after the glowing reports filed by my predecessors but it was just so-so. It took much longer to bake in my oven, noting that previous bakers indicated it would not set completely in the oven. The only deviation I made was to use a 9" rather than 8" crust. The filling seemed to lack flavor and the texture was way too soft even after an extra 10 minutes in the oven and sitting out for a couple of hours. I will try making it again with a smaller pie tin. I also made a batch of carrot cake cookies (found on Martha Stewart website) that were absolutely out of this world. I think this may have influenced my guest's attitude toward the pie. If you like or are evenly moderately found of carrot cake -- YOU MUST TRY THE CARROT CAKE COOKIES ON MARTHASTEWART.COM. Everyone from my 4 year old niece to my 80+ year old uncle raved and raved. They are some of the best cookies I've ever made...and I've made a lot of cookies. Try 'em...you won't be disappointed. :)

This is the type of recipe I like, one that takes little time and effort, but the end results look as though you have spent all afternoon in the kitchen. I did make my own pastry, which was delicious and I left out the pecans as I had none. Didn't matter, the pie was great.

This is one of those recipes that must be admired for sheer art. An easy and unusual mix of ingredients and voila! What a TREAT.

My mother was always "just mixing up a pie" that always seemed to be easy but extremely delicious. She used to make a pie like this and it always seemed to take no time for her. Unfortunately, she never used recipes or wrote it one down. I was excited to find this recipe and it is just as great as hers was and it really was quick to put together.

Let me just preface this by saying that I don't like German Chocolate anything. I made this for my fiancee, who loves it. He's very, very finicky, though, so I was a little leery of trying something like this but decided to give it a try. This was GREAT. Somehow, after the first bite or two, we just couldn't stop eating it. We were already full from supper, but over the course of the evening, I had two pieces and he had three. This is just wonderful (especially slightly warm) and is just as easy as it claims. It's not overpoweringly sweet either. Just make sure to let it rest about 30 or 45 minutes after it comes out of the oven to let the filling set. (Don't expect it to be completely set in the oven.) Just wonderful! Thank you, Nanney Spivey!
