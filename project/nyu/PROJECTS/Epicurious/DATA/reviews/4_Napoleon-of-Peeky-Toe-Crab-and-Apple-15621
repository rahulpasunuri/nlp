Let me begin by saying, I am neither a gourmet or a seafood lover, but this was delicious. My partner and I both loved it and we stand squarely on the Turf side of the Surf 'n Turf. We embarked on crab, because we were looking for a way to add 2-3 servings of Omega 3 rich foods per week. (My honey learned at a conference that it has been shown to stave off Alzheimers & demensia.) I bought a couple of packages of immitation crab meat, and when I decided I was ready to do something with one of them, we found this recipe. We did not read the whole thing, and had I read it I would have made it for lunch rather than dinner, as it is served cold. I did not make the Tuiles, nor did I include the milk, salt or pepper. This was largely due to the fact that I got caught on the phone with Dell for 2 hours, and by the time I was making this I was in a hurry. What I did was this ... Shred Crab peel & dice tomato (hot house) Peel & dice Apple Add lemon juice sour cream Mayo Chive (fresh) Curry (used less due to trepidation) Mix! As I said, I was in a hurry and tuiles seemed like a crackery type thing, so I served the mixture with Onion Crackers. The next time I would serve it with water crackers, as the onion threw off the balance of the flavors. This is a very elegant dish in flavor and asthetics.

The tuiles were a little tricky to figure out. Use parchment paper and forget about making a 5 inch arc with a pastry brush. I used the back of the teaspoon to spread the dough into a circle. They took more like 9 minutes to get brown around the edges. I thought the crab and sauce were terrific, with or without the tuiles.

Love it. I've made it twice for dinner parties and it's a big hit. Couldn't find peeky toe but other crab is also good. Skipped the tuiles since I had trouble, but served it in a leaf of raddiccio for a little color.

From a Chef in Georgia. We used snow crab. For the tuiles we used cake flour instead of rice flour. Even tho we don't care for nutmeg, it was really good. The crab mixture was unique and tangy. We will make this again!
