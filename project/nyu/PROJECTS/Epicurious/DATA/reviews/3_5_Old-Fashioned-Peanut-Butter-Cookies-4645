Very dry. Next time, I'll use 1/2 the flour and then test a few cookies, to try and get that old-fashioned chewy cookie experience. I've also heard you can just use egg yolks (2 per egg white) for a chewier texture. I did use a gourmet gluten-free flour, so the flour alone may have been the game-changer. And I used a freshly ground peanut butter (didn't read the note about that before going to the store). ;) I corrected the last 2 batches by adding a little oil and honey to moisten and they came out better ~ more peanutty than floury.

I did the same alterations as previous reviews--I cut the flour to 2 3/4 c, changed the 1 c butter to 3/4 c butter and 1/4 c vegetable shortening, and added 1/4 c molasses and 1 tbsp honey--and they came out wonderfully! Very soft in the middle.

Just made these with the tweak one reviewer provided: 1/4 cup molasses. I also added a tad more peanut butter. They are thick, yummy cookies! I may have made the balls of dough a bit bigger than suggested, because I only got about 3 dozen, but I don't mind!

Made a half batch, but otherwise followed instructions. These are a bit too firm for my tastes. Perhaps if I had flattened them even further so that they were quite thin they would be more crumbley and less hard. Not for me a second time.

I made these for my father in law because it is literally the only thing he will eat. They came out great but having read the reviews before hand I did modify the recipe. For chewiness I used 2c. white sugar and 1/4c. molasses. I also only cooked them for 10-12min. Be sure to let cool on the sheet 8min before placing on rack. Also, it really does yield about 4 dozen!

These are the best peanut butter cookies I ever ate. There is a discrepancy though, I believe. Where it says to roll dough into 1 3/4 in. balls, I believe 1 1/4 in. would be more accurate. Great for dunking in coffee.

Good, but not great. It's pretty easy and quick, and a great starter recipe for other types of cookies. I used half and made thumbprint cookies with them, rolled into a ball, made a small indent and filled with jam. Could've easily used to make peanut butter kiss cookies as well. Also, the fork did stick to the dough, so dipped in flour and sugar before pressing out.

Actually, I would give it 3 1/2 forks. They turned out really good ! My problem with peanut butter cookies is after the first two bites, I can't taste the peanut butter. I put peanut butter chips in half the batter and liked that better. Also, don't overcook. In my convection over at 325' it only took 14 minutes.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great. Nice and tender but still substantial. I wanted to report that using natural peanut butter worked fine for me. I did chill the dough overnight (I didn't have time to bake it until the morning) so that might have helped the oil not separate. But you should be okay with natural peanut butter, and then you won't be using peanut flavored crisco. Also, be careful when making the cross-hatch on top. Mine had a tendency to stick to the fork. Both cold water and oil helped with the sticking (when the fork was dipped in the liquid prior to pressing).

I absolutely love this recipe. I substitute soy peanut butter, whole wheat flour, and egg whites, and the cookies are absolutely delicious (and healthier, I tell myself, as I eat them by the dozen).

Yum. Love peanut butter cookies. The only thing I added to the recipe was chocolate chips. These are not crunchy, not 'chalky', not necessarily 'moist' just a nice texture with a little firmness at the edge. This is my new pb cookie recipe. Did I say 'yum'?

I made half this recipe last night just to try it out. The only change I made was to add a handful of roasted peanuts, because I was using creamy peanut butter and I wanted some crunch. These came out fine. Tasty, but on the crumbly side. Earlier reviews made them sound cakier, which is what I was after. Will try again.

Rating: 3
Pretty good!! I used whole wheat flour for pastries and stuck a mini reeses cup in the center. I would prefer them more peanut buttery tasting. I had to leave the dough in the fridge over night. I suggest NOT doing that, so the dough stays more manageable.

to A Cook from CO; normal or "old-fashioned" peanut butter will separate oil from peanuts especially in heat. That's why I put my PB in the fridge after mixing it. processed peanut butter contains a hydrogenated fat which keeps the fat and rest of peanut paste from separating. Unfortunately, hydrogenated oil is extremely unhealthy. It is trans fat, the stuff that clogs arteries and makes heart disease. Just something to think about

After reading many of the reviews of this recipe, I made the following changes and got rave reviews from all who ate these cookies: 1. Used unbleached all-purpose flour which I reduced to 2 1/2 cups. 2. Used Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter which I increased to 1 1/4 cups. 3. Added 1 Tablespoon lactose-free 2% milk. 4. Lined cookie sheets with parchment paper. 5. Prior to making the cross-hatch on each cookie, I dipped the fork in powdered sugar. I am thrilled with how these cookies turned out and look forward to how they will taste fresh out of the freezer tomorrow. :-)

I made these cookies, but I had to make some changes. First, I halved the recipe -- and still got 40 cookies out of it! Second, I used corn starch instead of eggs. I had to use more flour than the recipe suggested in order to make the dough come together. I also rolled the balls in powdered sugar. This gives them a nice finish and stops them from sticking -- no parchment necessary. Turned out great with those changes.

I really liked this recipe! It is so easy! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and made a few changes: - Reduced flour to 2 1/2 cups - Increased peanut butter to 1 1/5 cups - added 1 tablespoon of milk They taste and look just like how I remember peanut butter cookies to be!

I made this recipe as is. The result is a delicious cookie, which is chewy in the middle but a bit less so on the edges. I understand the remarks that some have made about chalkiness. I think you have to be careful not to over-bake them...not even a little. It is a great basic recipe, but I think that I will follow the lead of many others who reduced the amount of flour, by just a 1/2 or 1/4 cup. All said, this is a keeper!

Very good cookies! I read some of the review bellow and was afraid they would be dry and crumbly, so I followed some tips from other reviewers and they came out perfect! I just reduced the flour by 1/8 cup, added 1 tablespoon of milk and baked for 13 minutes (low altitude). They came out a little bit chewy and very peanut buttery. Perfect! I made them a second time with 16 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips for an extra treat. Yum!

Not a great peanut butter cookie. I read the negative reviews and thought maybe the people were just being negative in general. I mean, how can a peanut butter cookie recipe on this site not be good? . . but they're not good. They are okay and eatable, which is why I gave the review one fork. The cookie really needs a more peanut butter taste to it, so either follow some of the other suggestions the former reviewers gave or find another peanut butter cookie recipe.

I used a mixture of creamy and freshly ground peanut butter - and added in about an extra 1/4 cup total PB. Otherwise followed instructions to a "T".

We are a blended new family and all die hard peanut butter cookie fans!! I make this recipe all the time and do as the writer from 06/22/05 (9123me from Wyoming, MN) only I add a whole bag of Reeses peanut butter chips, put 1.5 cups of peanut butter and add ~ 1 tspn of vanilla. I also use a heavy insulated teflon cookie pan and bake for stated amount of time and make larger cookies - use ice cream scoop size. These cookies always turn out moist and chewy and never last more than a day, unless I hide some in the freezer - (yes they freeze well)!

People DO NOT review a recipe and give it a negative review if you did not follow the directions.

These were really yummy-- with a few variations. I agree with the other reviewers that they need only 12 or 13 minutes. I also cut the sugar just slightly, and a minute before they came out of the oven, I sprinkled them very lightly with flaked sea salt. A great salty-sweet treat.

a yummy peanut butter cookie. hit the spot for me. i made it exactly as the recipe goes, ingredient-wise. the only change i made is, smaller cookies so that i could have more crunchy edges (i ended up with about 7 dozen). mine were still soft/chewy in the middle. a suggestion to those whose cookies came out dry: it may be the way you're measuring out the flour. if you pack the flour in, even just a little bit, you'll end up with a lot more flour than you should. fluff the flour first, pile it into your cup measure lightly, and then level off without "tamping" it. i think that would help.

On a search for the best PB cookie and this was NOT it. They were thick, taxed my large kitchen-aid mixer by the time all ingredients were in, wouldn't stay together in the ball and really fell apart when I pressed the fork in, but most of all tasted like flour. Also, I expect PB cookies to be a bit thinner with still crunchy and chewy texture. These were extremely thick.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.

I used Jiff chunky pb and dusted the tops of the cookies with a little bit of sugar as I pressed them down with a fork. Superb!

Rating: 3
The family loved this, and I learned alot. I think I have some idea as to where the controversy as to the moistness of the recipe comes from - I had two kinds of PB in the fridge and used both, but used up the jar first that my kids least liked. It is MUCH drier than the other kind, and my first sheetful of cookies were pretty crumbly. Added more butter until the texture became pie pastry-ish (lumps beginning to stick to each other. So my lesson was - assess your dough before baking and be prepared to add more fat if it's not forming nice, sticky balls when you roll it.

This is outstanding peanut butter cookie recipe. I used 2 1/2 cups of flour, and followed TaraMc of Port Moody's suggestion to bake the entire batch pressed into a jelly roll pan.

I'm intrigued by the very different experiences that bakers have had with this recipe. Unfortunately, my cookies were dry and the batter would not hold together well enough to be rolled into balls. The batter between drier as it sat between turns in the oven--by the last sheet, I was clumping the dry batter in my hand and "willing" it to stay together. Enough other bakers had the same experience that I know I didn't do anything wrong.

I thought it was one of the best peanut butter cookies I have eaten and I have been baking for over 50 years.I used chunky peanut butter, it smelled and tasted great. The bottom was crunchy and the cookie was chewy. My Nephew's favorite cookie is peanut butter and he just loved them. I didn't see any need to add more of anything if a peanut butter cookie is what you want.

I added more peanut butter and vanilla to the recipe also. The cookies were good, but not spectacular.

I followed the directions in the original recipe as posted and I think I would have been happier to have read the reviews first and added more peanut butter & vanilla. They were a bit dry for my tasting. I don't think I will be making these again. Sorry!

OK on their own, even better if you press a Hershey's kiss into the top of each one just after they come out of the oven, before you even remove them to cooling racks. The kisses get wonderfully oozy and melty but hold their shape, and they round out the flavor of the cookies.

I followed the suggestions from other reviewers and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups and vanilla to 3t. With these increases, the cookies were fabulous. Make sure they get quite brown, which makes them so crispy. Enjoy!

My apologies to the cook below; alas, I also strayed slightly from the original recipe. I doubled the peanut butter (as suggested by other testers-thank you!) and added a cup of choc. chips. I will definitely make these again. For those who prefer a moister, less crumbly peanut butter cookie, this may IT!!DELICIOUS!Also, to the "cook" who was so aggravated by reviewers who change recipes.. cooking is an art, and being a "real cook" does not constitute following every recipe exactly. Variation is good! Chill out! If you need an "objective" opinion, make the recipe yourself!

WHY are people so surprised that recipes "don't come out good" when they didn't follow the original recipe? Please do all the REAL cooks here a favor & don't bother posting a review unless you can give an truly objective opinion!

These cookies were exactly what I wanted. My husband walked in the door during baking and promptly asked what I was baking that smelled so good! I also doubled the peanut butter and vanilla with good results. These had a flakey quality around the edges with a soft interior. Very nice.

I'm not really a baker and was just looking to use up some almond butter bought by mistake, but these were quite good -- just the right combination of chewy and crunchy. In addition to the almond butter I substituted almond extract for the vanilla with good results.

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever tried! I baked it in the kitchen of my dorm on disposable cookie sheets and it still came out beautifully. I added half a bag of peanut butter chips, half a bag of milk chocolate chips, and about a cup of dry roasted peanuts, and I sugared the tops before squishing with a fork. They don't need anywhere near 14 minutes in the oven, though!

I thought these were just O.K. I doubled the peanut butter and vanilla like other reviewers suggested and also added calbot chocolate chunks at the end. I didn't think they were that flavorful. For the second batch I sprinkled some sugar on them which made them a little better. I did realize afterwards that I used reduced fat peanut butter by mistake (I wonder if that altered the flavor?). I brought them into work and they did fly off the plate!

I doubled the peanut butter and vanilla and added a cup of chocolate chips. These were good but not great. Those big pb cookies they sell at Costco are better and a recipe really has to be better than something I can buy at Costco however good those may be, for me to be pleased. I'd make them again if I was in a pinch but will keep looking for a yummier recipe.

These cookies were delicious! If you are craving chewy peanut-butter cookies this is your recipe! I followed the recipe, but added a bit more peanut butter. I also sprinkled sugar on the tops of the cookies before baking. Also, one word of advice - dont wait until the cookies are a bit golden. I did this and ended up overbaking them. Take them out just before you think they are done and they will turn out nice and chewy.

To die for!...doubled the peanut butter and vanilla like others recommended.

I just made these cookies, and following some tips from other reviewers, I got excellent results. I used extra chunky peanut butter. And following the advice of one reviewer doubled the peanut butter and vanilla. Also added 6 oz of mini M&M's. Trust me the dough can hold the extra moisture. One review stated it gave her kitchen-aid a hernia. Mine too! If you dont have a powerful kitchen-aid, this recipe would be a wonderful way to burn the engine out of any handheld. But with some tweaks, a wonderful cookie. Will definatly make again.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made these. My oven must be off because I had to bake them 17 minutes before any 'color' at all appeared! They came out dry and heavy. Nice peanut butter flavor though. I will definitely try them again...and maybe check into having my oven re-calibrated or something too!

I modified this recipe and wound up eating a ton before they were even cooled: I made mini-cookies, about 1/2 an inch they come out the size of siler dollars. I added 2 TBSP of milk for creaminess Add 1 TBSP of espresso powder (incredible taste) Double the vanilla and the peanut butter Add chocolate chips Baked the minis for 10 minutes and they were perfect!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a classic peanut butter cookie. The flavor is mild. They would probably have more peanut flavor with chunky peanut butter (I used creamy). Timing is key so they do not get hard. I made 1 inch balls and baked them on airbake cookie sheets for 12 minutes until there was just the slightest tinge of golden brown on the edges and they were slightly chewy. I also thought they had more flavor the next day. We enjoyed them very much.

Sorry to type in a second time. I found the peanut butter cookie recipe I was craving on the back of the "Heath Bar Chocolate Chips" package. For those looking for a chewier cookie with more peanut butter taste, this fits the bill. To all those who love this recipe, to each their own.

I had a particular craving for peanutbutter cookies and came across this recipe and decided to try it out since it had a lot of good reviews. I did not have any baking powder, but my craving just had to be satisfied, so I decided to go without the baking powder. I tried the suggested 11 minute bake time and they turned out with the perfect texture--soft and chewy in the middle with the outer edges crisp. This turned out to be a textbook-perfect cookie.

Rating: 2
I made a departure from my regular peanut butter cookie recipe and tried this one. My batch came out cakey and bland, and despite adding chocolate chips and about 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts, the peanut butter taste was very faint. The cookies had a "prepackaged" taste to them - they were not crunchy or chewy, sort of the texture of damp vanilla wafers. A *much* better recipe is Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Cookies from "Chocolate on the Brain."

Rating: 4
Very good. Baked 11 min as well and came out perfect. Added in half a bag of choc. chips I had hanging around. They were not dry at all (didn't need a glass of milk to wash down). After baking, I let them rest on the cookie sheet for 2 min and this seemed to create a more chewy texture.

Thanks to all the reviews before me - Perfection! Baked 11 minutes for thick chewy disks of heaven

Finally, a recipe for peanut butter cookies worth making again and again. I think that by slightly underbaking these treats, I've found that slightly chewy, yet melt-in-your-mouth cookie that I've wanted for years. This is going straight to my recipe box.

These were a big disappointment to me. They looked really good before and after the oven, but they tasted really blah. I baked them on an insulated sheet and for about 13 minutes and they came out rock hard and very heavy. They also were not peanut buttery enough. I will keep looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe.

irresistable with choc. chips and slightly underbaked!

This is a GREAT PB cookie recipe! Most recipes I've tried are too crispy, as I like chewy cookies better. These were soft, with a little crisp around the edge, and very peanut-buttery. I baked them on air-insulated cookie sheets, so parchment paper was unneccessary.

Rating: 2
The first time I made these they were awful. I found the dough dry,not sweet enough and too peanut buttery. I made them a second time using margarine, less peanut butter and a touch more sugar and they were transformed into the perfect peanut butter cookies. As the recipe is written I would not recommend these cookies.

Rating: 4
I don't really understand the last reviewer's comments. My cookies and cookie dough were nothing like that description. They were the perfect consistency and very tasty. I actually wonder what went wrong with San Diego's coookies. I got tons of complements on these scrumptious PB cookies.

These cookies were a great hit! I brought them to my parents for the weekend, and there were none left. I'm glad I saved a few in the freezer, or I would have had nothing left. I made them with Skippy Super Chunk, and although they were a bit too sweet, it was a fantastic cookie that I'll definitely be making again soon.

I cook these a couple minutes less than suggested, as I like my cookies soft. These are incredible peanut butter cookies. By far, the very best recipe I have ever come across. (I first made them with reduced-fat creamy peanut butter and discovered that they need super chunky regular fat peanut butter.) Excellent!

Rating: 4
These cookies are delish! Don't expect a heavy peanut butter cookie. These are light and flakey, kind of like shortbread, with a mild peanut butter taste. I like to take them out of the oven, top with an unwrapped hershey kiss, let sit a few minutes and spread the kiss around to "frost" the cookie. Yum!

Rating: 3
This recipe was good and easy to follow. Sweet, but not too sweet. I used chunky peanut butter, but it was still not as peanutty as I would have liked-I don't know if you could increase the peanut butter by 1/2 cup and decrease the butter by that amount? Something I did, because I had to stop to tend to the baby, was chill the dough for about an hour, which made it easy to work with. Overall, these were really good, though-a big hit with my family.

Interesting this is exactly the recipe (with some minor tweaks) I developed after experimenting and have been using for years to make chewy pb cookies. The tweaks use only brown sugar and decrease it to about 1 3/4 cups. Use margarine instead of butter and increase the baking powder by 1 more tsp. Cook for about 8 minutes at 350 in a convection oven. Oh and forget the parchment paper but it does help them to hold their shape if you let them cool on the rack for a few minutes. You won't be able to stop eating them!

This recipe is great. I followed it as it is given(used chunky Jif peanut butter), and thought they were perfectly sweet and very peanuty. I think using chunky peanut butter makes a difference though. I liked these cookies so much I sent the recipe to my mom and suggested she toss hers. Hope you enjoy.

Rating: 2
This cookie looked good & had a great texture; crunchy on the outside, slightly chewy in the centre. I found it too sweet eventhough I only used 3/4 cup sugar instead of the 1 cup. I was concerned I wouldnt achieve the desirable texture if I used less sugar. I might add some chopped nuts and chocolate chips to the dough the next time I make these cookies.

Rating: 1
I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed by the results. I was surprised considering the high marks by others. I cookies were fairly unpeanut-buttery and hardened to the consistence of a rock the next day. I will have to continue looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe.

I never thought I'd trade in my mom's PB cookie recipe, but this one takes the cake (so to speak). I found that using old-fashioned or natural PB is fine (and even better); just be sure to increase the butter by two or three tablespoons.

This PB cookie recipe was hands down the best I have made yet. Being an inexperienced, amateur cook, I didn't have to tweak the ingredients to better suit the recipe.

Getting ready to make these cookies for the 2nd Christmas in a row. I use this recipe to make what we call "peanut butter kisses" - after the cookies come out of the oven and are still hot, press a Hershey's kiss into the top center of each one (this is probably a familiar recipe to many people). Just wanted to let other bakers know that I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and that was plenty, especially with the chocolate. YUM!

I made these cookies out of necessity. I'm moving, and I had to find a way to use up all the open containers of baking ingredients in the cupboard. These cookies were the perfect way!

Great cookies! And the dough was an absolute pleasure to work with -- so soft and pliable and not sticky. My one suggestion would be to add a bit more peanut butter to the recipe. These are delicious cookies, but if you're a real peanut butter nut, your taste buds might require just a tad more PB. I think another 1/4 cup or so wouldn't significantly change the dough or resultant cookie, although I have not tried the recipe with the added PB. Beautiful, classic PB cookies!

Tried this recipe after reading the reviews of all the peanut butter cookies recipes on the site and was not disappointed. We were not big peanut butter cookie fans before this, but now we can't stop eating them. I'm not sure why the recipe says not to use old-fashioned style peanut butter, but I have been using Trader Joes Crunchy Salted Peanut Butter from Unblanched Peanuts (no preservatives, just dry roasted peanuts and salt), and they are so good I'm afraid to try any other kind of peanut butter. (I have always used an unopened jar). I do not use parchment paper and do not let them cool on the stove for 5 minutes. I also make them smaller so there are more of them.

Best peanut butter cookie, and I'm choosy. Good crumb; tender center and good crunch outside. Using non-natural PB is a must, even if the Jiff's and Skippy's of the world do have trans-fats! Better if you chill the dough before cooking. The cookies set up better (or freeze part of a batch and have fresh cookies later). I add broken pieces of high-quality chocolate bar to the top of the cookie before baking. Ambrosia. Better than the other PB recipies on Epicurious.com. I've tried the others: this is the best.

I made these cookies with my little girl. They're simple to prepare and tasted wonderful warm and washed down with a cold cup of milk. One change I did make, in order to make them chewy, I put the required amount of light brown sugar, but put 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar. More brown sugars add the kind of moisture that I like in a peanut butter cookie. The flavor of peanut is full but not overwhelming, just right.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe provided, but didn't squish the cookies with a fork before cooking. Instead, I took the cookies out of the oven after 6-7 minutes, made a small indentation (using 1/2 teaspoon) in each cookie, and filled the cookie with home-made jelly. I then let cookies finnish baking for another 5-6 minutes. yummy! yummy! (got the idea from the pb + jelly cookie recipe, but this recipe was much better)

Rating: 3
The flavor of these cookies is wonderful. The dough is a bit soft, so I chilled it for a while before handling. 14 minutes was a bit excessive - I baked them for 5 minutes, then rotated the baking sheet and baked for an additional 4 minutes. Do not leave to cool on the sheet - it continues the baking process. Good recipe though, a few modifications!

The texture of these cookies is definitely shortbread like. I prefer a moist, soft cookie. But overall, it has a very good peanut butter flavor. My 6 year old nephew "loved" them.

Simply the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had, with a really delicate flavor and a great texture. This beats the chewy flourless recipes hands-down. Someone's comment that this was shortbread-like gave me an idea, and I made some of the cookies bigger--about 5" in diameter, pressed lightly into a nice circle (baked them 5 extra minutes on insulated trays) and then topped them, when cool, with a slightly chilled bittersweet chocolate ganache thickened with chopped pecans, and laid thin slices of fresh banana over the top--perfect, easy, excellent tartlets that both kids and adults get a kick out of. Between the tartlets, the regular cookies, and the cookie dough rolled around pieces of a caramello bar, this is a three-cookie recipe in one! I will definitely make this recipe again.
