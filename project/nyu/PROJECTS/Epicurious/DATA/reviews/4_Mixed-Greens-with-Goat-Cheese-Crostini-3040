This was delicious! I made some adjustments... I served it with spinach instead of mixed greens. I also toasted the baguettes a bit before spreading on the goat cheese and cut the pieces up smaller so they were more like croutons instead of crostini. I chopped up the sundried tomatoes and let them marinade in the dressing for a couple of hours so it was more like a homemade sundried tomato dressing. I added a pinch of salt and pepper to the dressing. But here was the real kicker... I topped the salad with caramelized onion! Served this at a brunch and it went in minutes.

Made it the first time using a smoked goat cheese and it was fantastic. I think the quality of the cheese definitely makes a difference, but as other reviews say this is a simple and delicious dish to make.

This is the quintessential "go-to" salad for company. Simple yet elegant.

This recipe is so simple, yet so delicious! The only thing I did differently was to let the garlic sit in the oil and vinegar for about 1 hour before proceeding. This allowed the garlic to infuse into the mixture for a more "garlicky" taste. I would also recommend cutting the baguettes a little thinner and once toasted, cut them into three smaller pieces.

YUM! YUM! YUM! This was so simple but so delicous. I served it as an appetizer and it was to die for. The goat cheese in combination with the vinegar, garlic and oil was just fantastic. I recommend this to anyone who wants to impress their guests with out too much effort. Really, really good!!

This was a great appetizer!! For a great variation, I added fresh basil on top of the crostini after they came out of the oven.

This was a wonderful salad! Given that field greens now come in convenient bags, it is very easy to make. I toasted the pine nuts on the stove in some butter, which added both flavor and crunch. Anyone who loves goat cheese should try this.

Excellent! I didn't have pinenuts so I used toasted almond slices. I omitted the sundried tomatoes and used 1 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar and 1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar. The crostini were a nice touch.
