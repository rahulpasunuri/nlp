my husband and i thought this recipe made pretty good corn muffins, although i did use 2/3 cup milk. otherwise, followed the recipe as written and they came out yummy and plenty moist. ate them warm, right out of the oven. will see how they do as leftovers.

I used Marie Callendar corn bread mix and also added more (soy) milk (a couple tablespoons), and two tablespoons of whole milk yogurt and more corn and cheese. I've served it to kids and parents alike and everyone liked them, especially warm. Add chopped cooked bacon for a breakfast muffin.

I feel lucky that I not only read the reviews, but have some experience in upgrading recipes...this recipe as is could not have come out well! I used 3/4c milk, double the corn kernels (super sweet yellow is the variety I chose), less basil, and more than double the cheese. The cheese was completely impossible to taste in the final product. Next time, I might try cheddar cheese to get some flavor. This recipe is something I would make again, but ONLY with MAJOR changes.

the recipe is dry, but I added some more milk and oil before baking. I had read what others wrote so that helped alot. I also added some more corn kernels and cheese. I think I would have added more cheese. It still was a little dry but I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if I had not added some more wet igredients. I think I would have still added more. It was still a little dry.

Oh boy, here is another groaner. My family did not enjoy these in the least. They were so dry that I was thankful that I have my own teeth. Do they just let anyone post recipes on here? Not wanting to waste any food, I tried soaking them in milk the next day to make them edible...didn't work. I ended up throwing them to the dogs. If anyone has any advise, please email me with it. I really liked the way it sounded, but, it tasted just awaful.

Pretty good. You definitely have to eat these right away, before they cool off. Also, I added a little can of diced jalapeno chili peppers -- thank-you very much to other cooks' comments!

Sounded better than it tasted. I don't think that the ratio of liquid to dry ingredients was correct. Muffins were "gritty" from the dry cornmeal. I lessened the baking time by 5 mins. because my oven is convection, and they still came out very dry.

Very easy and delicious! I added the jalapeno pepper to the batter and got rave reviews on this. By the way, I doubled the recipe and it came out fine.

Easy and excellent. I added chopped jalepeno peppers to one batch, and it was also good.
