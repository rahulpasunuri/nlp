We followed this recipe to the letter. BORING. Are you sure about the spice proportions here? Seemed to us even before we tasted it very conservative. Frankly, I have tasted more exciting things while visiting my grandfather at the nursing home.

Followed this recipe TO THE LETTER. One word. BORING. The saffron was indeed recognizable (barely), but the rest tasted like a can of Campbell's tomato soup thinned with water and then cooked down. Are you guys sure about the spice proportions here??? I have eaten more exciting things while visiting my grandfather in the nursing home.

This is a traditional Persian recipe called Gheimeh. Dried limes can be purchased at any Middle Eastern grocery store. I have made this many many times as my husband is Persian. However, I have never put the saffron into the recipe. I mix the saffron with a little bit of hot water and pour over the basmati rice before serving. I also cut a few potatoes into skinny fries, fry them in some oil and add them to the top of the dish before serving. I only use two onions, not 4, and I use double the oil. I dont measure the water, but pour it over the pot to just cover the meat. I dont use the crushed tomatoes at all, as it will make it too much like a spaghetti sauce. I use 4 to 5 dried limes and no lime juice. The recipe also needs salt, but I just add that to taste. Good luck!

Followed the recipe, except for the omani lemon- couldn't find one. Hated it. Tasted like beef and lemon, shocking, I know. Didn't like the beef and lemon together and eventually tossed the leftovers. Would not make again, not even worth experimenting to make better.

This is a wonderful and easy to make dish! It's perfect as a family meal or for a casual dinner party. I took the advice to add the split peas with the meat, just for convenience sake, which worked out fine. I checked the meat for tenderness to determine when the stew was done, rather than using a timer. Like most stews, it was even better the next day. I added about a tablespoon or so of currents to the stew once the meat was almost ready (about 15 minutes before it finished) and some toasted slivered almonds a few minutes before I took it off the stove. Both were great additions, which I will do again. If you have some diners who object to the almonds, you could serve them with the garnishes. Have a lot of your various garnishes available. They are fabulous additions.

whoops, I forgot to add that I added the split peas same time as meat and cooked together because of the shorter cooking time in case someone else wants to use game.

opps, I forgot to add that I cooked the split peas with the meat because of the lesser cooking time. For me it was done in about an hour.

Yummm! Ok, I did make a few changes, but not many. I used cubed elk so cook time is much less. we like a little more spice, so I increased the spices by 1/2 and added a bit of red pepper. Because I believe elk needs a little something I added 1/2 cup hard cider and 1/2 diced apple and I served it over cous cous... again, YUMMM!

In case someone can get ground dried lemon instead of the whole ones, I found that 1 dried lemon = 1.5 tsp ground. I have yet to make this recipe, so I don't know if this is correct :)

This is a delicious dish!! Quite easy and plentiful. I have to thank the other reviewers regarding the meat and split pea suggestion. It is, without a doubt, the better way to go. All the flavors come through and the topping of basil, mint and radishes was divine. I cut up the mint and basil into strips, so you could eat a little with each bite. Yum!!

This one will become a staple in our house. I agree with the comment to double the beef and add the split peas with the tomatoes and water.

For people who can't find limou amani... You can always make your own limou amani. Just leave your limes in the fridge or on the counter until they are dried and brown. That's pretty much what they are...dried limes. The dried limes are also a key ingredient in another tasty persian dish, Khoresht Ghormeh Sabzi, or herb stew.

The stew came out really tasty. I will make it again soon

Great dish. The Omani lemons will be hard to find unless you have an Arab or Persian market, however. Must be served over basmati rice to achieve the total effect of the dish. I make it often.

A really great and unique stew. I, like most humans on this planet will be, was unable to find Omani lemons. My local eccentric foodshop had semi-dried whole lemons, which I used instead. I might recommend adding a bit more beef (as the prior reviewer suggested, but whose suggesiton I unfortunately did not heed) as there is a LOT of sauce that you'll have left over. If you can find persian spices, you should definitely add. I did, and it really helped the dish.

My family and I loved this recipe. I've made this twice now - first with beef chuck and next with lamb chuck (which was wonderful with the frest mint garnish). Although I wasn't able to find Omani lemons, I added about 1/4 cup key lime juice at the end and thought the combination was delicious. Just a couple of suggestions - I doubled the amount of meat called for and I added the split peas at the same time as the water and tomatoes. I will definitely make this dish again.

Fabulous. also fortunate that I live in an area where persian/med ingrediants are available. we served over cous cous, (included barberries, toasted sliced almonds, mint) and was fabulous. the citrus element is key, please do not skip. Even if you lack omani lemons, the recipe needs the zing of citrus juice before serving.

My family really enjoyed this dish. The first reviewer found the dish bland, and I have found that Persian cuisine can best be described as "subtle". The spices used are not terribly assertive, and there's not loads of onions or garlic to beef up the taste. The addition of the Omani lemons is not a step to be skipped. I'm fortunate enough to live in an area with a Persian market and was able to not only purchase whole Omani, but powdered Omani as well (you can make your own powder by removing the seeds from the whole dried fruit and grinding in a food processor). I used the powdered Omani in the place of the lemon juice to achieve the acidity the dish definitely needs.

This was a bit too bland for my taste - but that said, I did not have the Omani lemons and I forgot to add the lemon juice at the end! The saffron taste is quite intense. I made a double batch to freeze. We will eat the leftovers, but I probably wouldn't make it again. The things I liked: economical, looks good, easy. Curious to know what other people thought.
