I like using this recipe more as a granola-making guideline than as written. I use similar ingredients in mostly the same quantities: flaxseeds instead of sesame, pumpkin pie spice instead of cardamom, cranberries and blueberries instead of apricots and pears. I also reduce the oil/honey to 5 tbsp each. Other reviews advice to reduce temperature, cooking longer, and stir more frequently has worked for me. I cook it at 300F for about 35 minutes, stirring twice during the cooking process.

Lowering temp and longer baking time as others suggested gave the granola a nice caramelization. I added a little extra honey and a drizzle of maple syrup to the mix. Also, vanilla, cinnomon, and nutmeg really made it tasty.

This recipe was a success. Even my finicky 4year old loved it. I used walnut oil instead of vegetable oil and added sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chopped walnuts, flax seed and substituted dried cranberries for the fruit. Could have used a bit more honey to bind some more. Looking forward to making this again.

I didn't love this compared to other recipes I've used. I cooked it for about 35 minutes at 325 (my usual granola plan) but it didn't brown and never crisped as it cooled - it stayed soft and sticky. The flavor was too bland, too - it needed more cardamom and probably some cinnamon too.

I am so pleased! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and about 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and it is a delight. I took the advice from previous reviews and baked at 275 degrees, turning the granola about every 10-12 minutes. In total, it baked for about 30-35 minutes. Worked perfectly. I'm really impressed with how evenly everything baked. It looks really professional and the spices are lovely. Does anyone know if this needs to be stored in the fridge?

I was a bit bummed with how this turned out. I should have read some other reviewers' suggestions, as I would have lowered the temperature and cooked longer, and added more honey. Mine came out a little burned and not very clumped. I did sub flax seeds for half of the sesame seeds, and added cinnamon and nutmeg.

Like many other reviewers, I made several changes to the original recipe, and I was very happy with the results. I thought this was a good starting point. I halved the cardamom and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. For fruit, I used dried cherries and golden raisins. I also lowered the temperature as suggested to 275, and baked it for 30 minutes. I think the recipe could use a little more honey to help it clump up better (I like my granola chunky) and the sesame seeds were overpowering at first, but mellowed into the mixture after a couple of days. Overall, a delicious recipe.

Very easy and very tasty! Used other reviewer's advice on cooking time and it worked well. Instead of using cardamom I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. The nutmeg was a little strong but still yummy. For future bakings, I will try adding vanilla. All-in-all, delicious recipe!

Just made it this morning and it's half gone already. Next time I think I would add the cinnamon and nutmeg. While the cardomom is fragrant, it doesn't add as much to the flavor as I would have liked. I used apricots and dried cherries for the fruit, but just about any tasty dried fruit would do. Quick and easy. Next time I'll make a double batch.

Delicious! I took the other users' advice and made the following modifications: - Added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg - Substituted raisins for dried pears - Baked it at 275 for 25 minutes and then at 200 for 10 minutes. I stirred it every 10-12 minutes. It turned out perfect and delicious!!

Easy to make and yummy. Added pinches of nutmeg and sea salt. Also, added golden raisins and dried unsweetened cranberries since I didn't have dried pears. Kids, husband and friends all like this granola!

Besides the fact that I slightly burned the honey and oil when heating them, it came out well even after I added honey straight out of the oven. Though it still has a somewhat bitter aftertaste, the actual mix is excellent.

Great recipe! Agree with previous reviewer that 350-F is too high. To avoid burning, which I've done to granola before, I set my oven to 275-F and gave the granola a careful stir every 12 minutes until it was golden. Total cooking time about 35 minutes-- worth the extra attention and time.

Delicious! I made it with raisins, cranberries and chopped apricots, and added a little cinnamon and vanilla at the suggestion of others. Very good. I reduced the honey slightly to just under 1/4C on the 2nd batch because I found it to be very sweet, but I didn't end up with with the nice big clusters that the first batch turned out. Still great, though.

I made some changes based on what I had in the cupboards. I used chopped whole almonds rather than sliced. I didn't have sesame seeds so I left them out. I added 1 cup chopped walnuts, and the cinnamon & vanilla suggested by the other reviewer. Also, 350 was just too high in my opinion. I lowered the heat to 275 and just baked it a bit longer. It turned a lovely golden brown without burning (as did my 1st batch.) The smell is heavenly. My husband eats this nearly every morning with Balkan yogurt and whatever fruit we have in the house. He loves it! As an afterthought, I may try a batch with less oil. We will never buy boxed granola again!

I made changes to this recipe so I'll share what I did different - but won't rate. I used walnut oil and organic maple syrup (just finished the Master Cleanse). I also used walnuts and dried cranberries - cardamom, cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. The smell from the kitchen was heavenly. This is my go-to granola recipe from now on.

Quick, easy & tasty. My 5 year old daughter loved it. The recipe is a good base on which you cam improvise. I won't buy granola mixes anymore, I'll continue making my own.

16 minutes in my oven is just about right! I made this for Easter breakfast - it did not last long! and have given it for gifts. I have used blueberry honey(nice flavor) and always add diff dried fruits like cranberries, golden raisins, dried cherries. It smells wonderful baking on a rainy day like it

This recipe is simple and fantastic. I also shortened the cooking time, substituted half butter for vegetable oil, and added banana chips to the fruit mix. It makes a delicious gift, and it's hard not to get excited when the amazing smell wafts around the kitchen and home!

fantastic base recipe for granola - i switch it up by what i have in the cupboard and what fruits and nuts are on sale. so easy, so yummy.

I also found that the cooking time was too long. I decreased it by 5 minutes, at which point the edges of the granola were still too brown. I used currants and dried cranberries, as this was what I had. Nice flavors. While the cardamom is lovely, it could use some cinnamon. The honey is a good, deep flavor, but I prefer brown sugar in granola. This is not my preferred recipe for granola. My husband quite liked it, though, so no accounting for taste!

I couldn't find dried pears, so I substituted dried mango and added shredded coconut. The only problem is that, after 20 minutes at 350, the granola was too browned. Next time, I would reduce the temperature. Tastes great, though!

What a great recipe! This was the fastest and easiest granola I've made. I followed the recipe-minus the dried pears which I didn't have in the house-added some shredded coconut, pistachios and pecans- delicious! I made this on two trays- one had a silpat mat underneath and the other had parchment paper-the one with the parchment paper made nice clusters after cooling-the other no clusters...I might add a little more salt or more salted nuts next time for balance. Loved the honey sesame combo-don't skip the sesame seeds they really make this special!
