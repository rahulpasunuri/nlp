Don't bother. I've been using this site with great success since 1991. This dish was not good. I prepared as directed and served at room tempurature against my better judgement. Cold pork tenderlion loses the attraction of a nice, warm juicy center. The taste of the mustard/caper sauce was OK, but the eggs provide an unpleasant texture. There are so many other wonderful options on this site, just skip this one and move on to better food.

This dish delivered! Fortunately I read the reviews before making it. I wouldn't have made the sauce if the only way to do so was forcing an egg through mesh. Sounds grueling! Instead I spun the eggs in a processor and whisked in the remaining ingredients. Well worth it - added brightness to the dish with the acidity. As for "to egg or not too egg" the stuffing, I have to give props to including them. They added a richness to the stuffing that makes the dish truly decadent. My only challenge was probably just due to a lack of professional training - it was very difficult to get the entire quantity of stuffing rolled tight and tied cleanly. I managed to tie it well and forced stuffing back into the pocket after the fact but it wasn't as presentable as a real charcuterie should appear. Practice would fix that though and practice I shall as this one's going into my recipe box!

I made too many changes to review the recipe, but I wanted to comment that the cooking instructions worked perfectly for me.

I made this for a dinner party and it was excellent. It was easy and had good flavor. I would definitely make again. I am thinking of using it for Christmas Eve this year. You can make ahead and it is good.

I'd agree with a 3-3.5 fork rating. This was easy and presented very professionally. However, I seem to be the only one that was puzzled by the sauce. First of all, how do you press a hard boiled egg (white) through a seive? I just gave up and omitted the sauce. Was still very tasty and nice looking.

I made this last night for my wife's bunko crowd. I served it at room temperature and omitted the eggs. I also added a lemon juice/orange juice/oregano marinade over the top while cooking. It turned out Amazingly moist and delicious. The stuffing was perfect - didn't take away from the taste of the pork. I'm not a big "sauce guy" but this mustard-caper sauce was just the ticket.

Although it took two of us to tie the stuffed tenderloin up, it was well worth the effort. And the sauce was out of sight. Served it warm as our entree.

The eggs would be good if you were to serve this as a picnic/lunch entree, which it seems nobody (including myself) has done. I also served it as a dinner entree, attracted by the fact that it could be served warm/room temp. The filling was easy to prepare, although the assembly was a little messy and took some time. However, the result was fantastic. The stuffing flavor permeated the meat, which was moist and delicious. This is both a visual and culinary winner.

Like the previous reviewer, I questioned the need, frankly, to put the hard boiled eggs in the stuffing so I omitted that step. The roast came out perfectly. And the sauce was magnificent. I served it at room temperature with some green beans that I par boiled then finished with some butter and sesame seeds. Wonderful dish.

I was very disappointed in this dish. I love hard boiled eggs but they had no place in this pork! The spinach stuffing was good, but it was unclear how to add the eggs inside the meat. I admit that I probably made a mistake for not searing the pork - I baked it for about 45 minutes. It came out very dry. As for the sauce, pushing hard boiled egg through a sieve is about as easy as finding a needle in a haystack. The sauce had lumps of egg in it - gross! I might make the spinach filling in something else in the future, but definitely with a different sauce! Fortunately, I rarely have kitchen failures, but sad to say - I deem this one a big failure!

This is excellent for a picnic, and fairly easy to make. Be sure to leave enough time so it can chill properly. The bacon, spinach, and egg in the stuffing match well with the pork, and the sauce is also a winner. It's very convenient to make ahead.
