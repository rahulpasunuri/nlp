Great use of leftover sausage stuffing. Only suggestion I have is to finely chop the stuffing before attempting to stuff mushrooms with big chunks of bread. Also used baby bellas - will use full size bellas next time and serve as a main course.

Really good! Roasted the mushrooms (absent) stem-side down for 8 minutes. Drained the accumulated liquid. Then stuffed and put in the oven for 20 minutes. I think this made them a bit more tender. Used cornbread stuffing, and parmesan instead of provolone. Skipped the basil. So many flavors going on, I felt it didn't need it. This appetizer was gobbled up first at Thanksgiving!

I substituted crab for the "favorite stuffing" part and added bread crumbs. It was a hit! (I also had to add 1 more egg)

Great quick dish for stuffing leftovers! Took 5 mins prep time, 15 mins bake time.

I forgot the egg, and added 1+ cup of cheese straight to the stuffing (which was gasp! stovetop). I also added a dash of garlic. This was very easy to make and my guests loved it, but I thought it was only average.

I've already made this twice since Thanksgiving. I substituted Swiss cheese for the provolone and it came out very well. The recipe may be a bit labor-intensive for people who feel "cooked out" after the big meal,though.

My kids and I didn't care for it, but my husband and mother devoured them.
