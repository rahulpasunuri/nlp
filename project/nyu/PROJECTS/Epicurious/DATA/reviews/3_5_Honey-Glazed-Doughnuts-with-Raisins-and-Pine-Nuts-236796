I have an egg-allergic child so substituted 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the egg. Everything worked beautifully and the flavor and texture of the doughnuts without the glaze was great. However, the honey glaze was very honey-heavy (not surprisingly) and didn't go over well with the family. Will make exactly the same way next time but perhaps use some combination of maple syrup and simple syrup for the glaze next time.

I am a huge fan of epicurious, and love most recipes. This one, however, is not so good. The doughnuts are bland and the honey glaze is...also bland. It is a mess to eat, as the glaze will not harden, so not a good party finger food. The sufganiot recipe on this site, which I made for last Hanukkah, is much, much better.

I don't even like doughnuts all that much - but these were amazing. I omitted the raisins and pine nuts and made the honey/cinnamon syrup according to directions. The doughnuts were light and fluffy, not too sweet, and the syrup absolutely makes it. Definitely serve warm. (I made mine a couple hours in advance and rewarmed them in the oven which didn't compromise the quality). I don't have much experience frying much of anything, but found these very easy to make. I think I made each doughnut about twice the size it should have been as the recipe should yield 32 but I only had 16. That being said I think I liked the bigger doughnuts because there was more of the fluffy inside to enjoy. Either way you can't go wrong. Just make this recipe - you won't be sorry. I can't imagine the pine nuts and raisins would make this any better....

We have made this a few Chanukah's in a row and love them! The syrup is really sticky and gets all over but that is half the fun ... the flavor is delicious and they are easy to make. A cook can make these anytime but they were especially nice for the holidays.

These were such fun to make, and not too difficult, but they looked amazing and impressive. I loved the texture and flavor; the donuts themselves were light and not too sweet, and the glaze added just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely be making these again!

These were lovely and quite easy to make. Next time I think I will measure the tablespoonfulls of dough ahead of time, perhaps roll them a bit to give them a shape, before deep frying them. All in all, a great treat for the holidays!

Made this last night for an annual Chanukah party. It was a big hit - everyone loved it. They said that they werent too sweet and tasted like fritters. I found it was relatively easy to make - although I've never deep fried much of anything before.
