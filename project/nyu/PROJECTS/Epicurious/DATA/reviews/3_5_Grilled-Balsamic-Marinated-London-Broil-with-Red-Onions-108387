I've made this twice, with the exception that I add just a little Lea and Perrins to the marinade so that it gets a little rounder flavor to it. My wife loves it, my friends love it, and I've repeated it about once a week for a month now. (The wife is a little easy to please with food)

No problems with this recipe at all other than we had a lot of onions. Marinated the meet for 6 hours and it was beautiful. No adjustments necessary. Not sure why others had issues.

This was very good as far as London Broil goes. The meat was not tough and had a wonderful taste. Onions were a nice addition. Made excellent sandwiches the next day and also added to salad. Served with red potatoes boiled in white vinegar, sliced in 4 slices, brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper and then grilled.

I have now made this twice, without the onions. Even my husband, who doesn't like london broil, really likes it and says it is very flavorful. I am very careful to slice it thinly on a diagonal. I also use top round london broil with some marbling. It makes great steak sandwiches and would make a nice app for a party on a crostini with a little horseradish cream.

Winderful and simple. Great marinade for this cut - so flavorful. I thought the balsamic might overwhelm the dish but it didn't.

Marinating imparts flavor to a dish. It DOES NOT tenderize it, despite what everyone here seems to think. If you let this sit in acidic balsamic vinegar for more than a few hours, all you're doing is denaturing the proteins on the outer 1/4 inch of the meat, which will result in a mushy texture. If you had a tough cut, then it's probably just the particular London Broil that you got. It's a tricky cut of meat, and unfortunately it's very difficult to tell whether you've got a good one just by looking at it. I would suggest trying the Cook's Illustrated method--cover it in Kosher salt for at least 4 hours. This actually does tenderize it by means of osmosis. Even so, if you got a tough cut, it won't be the greatest thing you've ever eaten.

This was my first time making london broil and it was delicious! Loved the cooking method with the sear action in the beginning, my meat was nice and juicy. Would definitely make this again!

I'm not usually a huge London broil fan, but this was the most tender and delicious one I've ever had. Some tips- 1) Marinade: good as is, but added a tablespoon of low sodium soy for a richer flavor. 2) cut of meat-- got Angus beef round on sale -- really made a difference 3) grilling instructions -- as recommended, seared the meat first and grilled as directed. Will definitely make this again!

To the cook from Tacoma ... marinating meat is actually cooking it in a sense ... so 36 hours of marinating is just much too long. Not a fair review of this recipe.

Although I didn't care for this as the main coure, in all fairness I had to come back and say I think the leftovers made a nice lunch when sliced paper thin with my meat cutter, drizzled with Trampetti extra virgin olive oil and placed between ciabatta slices. It's so easy and inexpensive, I'll probably make it for weekend lunches and to serve as a French dip with au jus.

Never having made london broil before, this looked like the best recipe to try. I asked the butcher for a good piece of meat with no lip. Based on everyone's comments, I pierced it, marinated it in THEE BEST aged balsamic inegar and extra virgin olive oil for 36 hrs, then brought it to room temp for even cooking, grilled to specs, cut it crosswise as directed and...it was chewy and boring -- a major disappointment. The saving grace of the meal was the grilled red onion & zucchini, sauteed mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes I made as side dishes. Bottom line: I'm thankful I tried it on my spouse and no guests. I'm keeping the grilled tri tip roast w/ tequila marinade & cherry "relish"(from this site) as my tried and true standard.

Though I've made countless recipes from this website, this is the first I've ratedbecause it was truly a standout!It was SO quick and easy, and after marinating for 2 days, the flavor was simply outstanding! Give it a long soak- you won't be dissapointed:)

I gave it a 3 because it earned an extra fork for ease! This recipe is basic, good and fast, though I did not make onions. For those who found the meat to be too tough, I offer these suggestions. As a recent convert to London Broil myself (a part of my budget driven menus) I have found that London broil is all muscle so regardless of what you marinade it in, it really should be marinated overnight and cooked medium rare for best results. Another suggestion would be to try a soy sauce based marinade if you only have a few hours the salt in the souce sauce is a great tenderizer. I like soy sauce, sesame oil, lime, fresh ginger, garlic and scallions.

I let this marinate in the fridge for 4 hours and it was very good. Maybe next time I'll marinate longer, though. The meat wasn't tough at all . . . I'm wondering if some of the other reviewers didn't cut against the grain of the meat and that would make a huge difference. Not thinking, I served this with salt-roasted baby yukon potatoes and homemade baguettes . . . relatively boring meal . . . I would definitely add a green vegetable or a salad next time.

I would make again, but not with a london broil. The meat is too tough for me. The flavor was delicious though.

Who'd thought anything so simple could be so yummy! Definitely use a flank steak rather than London Broil!

This was fantastic. I think it's a matter of personal taste about the marinade - I thought it was perfect.

While good, I was expecting much more flavor, and this marinated all day. The onions were good, all around it's fine, but I was expecting more "Wow" from it.

This recipe makes a tender piece of meat, but I felt it needed more flavor. I will make it again, but I'll add more garlic. Also, I used an inexpensive balsamic, and I felt the recipe suffered as a result. Next time, I'll use the good stuff.

Definitely make this one. Simple, and substantial, and delicious. Onions were great! Would marinate the amount of time suggested...needs time for flavors to soak in. Served with stuffed tomatoes and roasted baby potatoes with olive oil, garlic and rosemary.

Delicious! The next time I prepare it, I may stuff some garlic cloves in the meat, and coat it with black pepper before grilling.

Was a great recipe, especially with the onions. Only one suggestion, marinate the meat overnight, four hours just isn't quite enough to tenderize the meat. Worked great indoors with cast iron grill pan, but was smoky - open some windows!

Didn't make the onions, used Flat-Iron steak. Didn't use expensive Balsamic. Grilled and made sandwiches the following day. They were excellent! Can't wait to try hot off the grill.

This was going to be my last attempt at making flank steak. It has always come out dry and chewy. Not any more!!!! This was awesome. I followed the directions to a "T" and it came out perfect. Moist and flavorful...not a morsel left. Everyone raved at my cookout. My daughter even commented that we should eat this every day!!

Everyone loved it; even the kids.

I purchased aged Balsamic vinegar from Crestanellos (a Midtown cafe) and marinated London broil in it along with garlic, salt, pepper for about 15 hours. Although we do not have a grill, we have a grill-paneled cast iron skillet that worked just perfect. This is a quick recipe that is both delicious and practical.
