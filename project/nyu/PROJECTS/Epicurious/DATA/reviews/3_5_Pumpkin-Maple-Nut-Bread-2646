This bread is delicious! I didn't have prunes and took the advice of the other reviewers: Use 1/3 c. oil (instead of a 1/4 cup) and 2 whole eggs to replace the lost moisture. I also added the zest of a whole orange, a pinch of salt and several shakes of nutmeg. (Next time I will add lots of ginger instead; this recipe needs ginger.) I had only 1/3 c. pecans and added some chocolate chips for fun. I subbed 1/2 of the flour with spelt flour. Oh, and I did not need to use the muffin tins. It is very tasty!

Fantastic - I used hemp seeds instead of nuts and baked in my muffin top tin. Huge hit with the kids and a satisfying treat.

I also did not have prunes and used more oil and the whole egg as the other reviewer suggested. i used a fourth cup more of pumpkin cause thats all that was in the can and i didn't want to save such a small amount. i also used half cup coconut flour in place of the last half cup of flour to up the fiber. I'm pretty crazy about spice and didn't want the bread to be unflavorful as some other reviewers suggested, so i put in a half teaspoon of cloves and of nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. i used brown sugar instead of white. AND one last suggestion, a little orange zest! This bread is so so delicious. My family ate it up while it was still hot! highly recommended.

Delicious. We used whole-wheat flour and added fresh cranberries for a bit of zing. Next time will try with brown sugar.

Oh, and I added a half teaspoon of salt--definitely need this.

I admit that the prunes struck me as odd, but assume that their main purpose is to add moisture, since this recipe is pretty low in fat and protein. I didn't have any, so I modified the recipe, and instead used a half cup of canola oil and two whole eggs. I used pumpkin puree I made instead of canned. I also upped the fiber content by using one cup of white whole wheat to one and a half cups of white flour. I then omitted the pecans-- only to reduce overall calories, since I am sure they add nice flavor. The changes worked beautifully--great flavor and good texture. I will make again.

I was looking for a "healthy" prune bread for my little daughter -- I couldn't get her to eat the prunes -- and this was great! Moist, tasty, I ended up serving it at a dinner party and everyone liked it. I made a few changes . . . used brown sugar and only used 2/3 cups. Instead of 2 cups of pumpkin, I used 1 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup baby food prunes.

Made as written except that I used Black Jack in place of the water to puree the prunes with. I agree it needs salt. Probably about 1/2 to 5/8 tsp worth. Otherwise very good. Would make again, but with salt.

Very moist & tasty - an excellent recipe. Love the low fat and low sugar. I made a batch of 1 1/2 times the listed ingredients (but used the entire can of pumpkin) and made a large loaf and a small loaf. Also added dried cranberries in addition to the nuts. The loaves freeze well, making this an excellent recipe to make ahead for holiday entertaining.

While "low fat" makes this recipe attractive, it's rather tasteless (even though I used more spice than called for) and sort of spongy texture. The batter is thick, dry - you must over mix it to get it to bind. Nice idea, poor outcome.

This was a good pumpkin bread but nothing to rave about. It was easy to make and filled with fiber so I would make it again. I don't think the maple flavor was intense enough even though I used real maple syrup.

I think there are better tasting pumpkin bread recipes but not with the low-fat and nutrient content of this one. I love using prunes instead of the fat substitute in the jar made from prunes--so much cheaper to just use prunes. I made mine all as muffins for out-of-town guests, and they went over well. They are best warm, in my opinion.

Very nice pumpkin bread, easy to make, sweet, soft, moist. Not a big maple flavor (I did use real maple syrup), but still good. I got only 5 smallish but very tasty muffins, plus the loaf. Also, used walnuts instead of pecans which was fine. Next time would definitely add a pinch of salt as another reviewer suggested.

This was the best of all the dishes I made for Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of making the 6 extra muffins, I poured the extra batter into an 8-inch cake dish and made a shallow bread (but needed to watch the time, since it took less time to cook the shallow cake pan than it did to bake the loaf pan). I followed all of the other directions. I made it a day ahead. CAUTION: Keep an eye on the loaf as it bakes. Mine got a little extra dark on the outside, but it did take the 1 hour and 5 minutes to bake completely inside.

We tried this warm from the oven and were really unimpressed (it takes alot to unimpress my husband). It really improves with age though and the maple flavour really intensifies. I'm going to make it again but try only 3/4 cup sugar. Also, I had enough batter for two small loaves (not the bread size but the cake size). It's good to find a recipe that uses lots of pumpkin - very healthy!

What a find! I drained and pitted a can of plums and pureed them, instead of using prunes and water. Yummy. I think a dash of salt would help the flavor next time--I notice that a lot of cakes and bread recipes include no salt, and the taste just isn't complete without it. Best of all, the texture of this bread seemed even moister and denser the second day after baking.

By far the best pumpkin bread I've made. Moist and rich without the oiliness that so many quick-breads have. I used a couple more prunes than called for. Didn't have quick-cooking oats so I used regular ones, which turned out fine. Perhaps the unhappy cook didn't use real maple syrup? This recipe is a keeper.

My family loves this recipe and we have also been making this bread since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. We have given many loaves as gifts and the recipients rave about how wonderful this recipe is.

This recipe has been a fall favorite ever since it appeared in Bon appetit. I can't believe more people haven't rated it. A family favorite!
