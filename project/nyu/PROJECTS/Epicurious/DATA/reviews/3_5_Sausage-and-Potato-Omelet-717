The whole family loved this omelet! Very easy to make. I agree with the previous reviewer that less olive oil would be good. The veggies and sausage have enough oil/fat even after they are drained, that I don't think you need but a tiny amount so that the eggs won't stick in the pan. I also added zucchini that I had in the fridge. When cooking the veggies, I would also recommend putting in the potatoes first, as they take longer to cook (or whatever other veggies take longer to cook) and then add the onions etc; otherwise by the time the potatoes are done, the onions are almost burned. Another thing I did differently is that I did not remove the casings from the sausages because my sausages were half-cooked already but I cut them into slices and they were delicious.

the olive oil is not my favorite for this. i'd use much less of it in the last step--it's way too much for me, making the final omelet much too oily and really unappetizing--and added a flavor that just wasn't great for me with the other flavors (i love olive oil, but not with this dish). i'd just use as little as possible to keep the omelet from sticking, if you need any at all, if i were making it again. the olive oil overpowered my mild sausage (i substituted what i had on hand) omelet so much that i didn't even want to eat it. i won't be making this again without that modification!

Picked up the wrong sausage (salsicca)for a different recipe at the meat market so I did a quick search and found this one. Had the ingredients except for mozzarella so I subsituted parmesan regiano. The result was fabulous. We'll definitely make it again and maybe (or maybe not) try the mozarella.

This is really good and rather easy too. I used real Spanish Chorizo purchased at iGourmet.com and added mushrooms to the veggies, thrown in toward the end of the veggie cooking period. Turned out really well. Tho this is listed as a breakfast, it's close enough to a frittata or even a crustless quiche... brunch, lunch, or dinner are good ideas for this too. I agree, lower cooking time on the chorizo is a fine idea.

Easy and quick - but that medium-high heat should probably be medium-low.

Quick and nutritious dish. I found sliced chorizo with paprika, which was very nice.

I've made this twice so far, and my family loves it. It's a great rainy day meal. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozza because I didn't have any mozza on hand at the time. As for when to add the sausage...I just put it in the egg mixture after it cooled down.

When do you add the sausage? Recipe does not indicate. Can you bake this dish instead?

I really liked this recipe but my husband loved it! We had it for dinner one night and then finished it off at breakfast the next day, so it's very versatile. My husband always says that he likes what I cook, but with this recipe, he told me it was a keeper before I even asked him what he thought!

I would suggest to put chorizo back in pan after draining and then put in the potatoes,onions,and green peppers. Was very tastey with Melinda's hot sauce.
