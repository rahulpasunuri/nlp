I had this at an Italian restaurant and was hooked (no pun intended). So glad to have a simple recipe on which to build if I want. It's very rich; so, if you want to tone it down, try it with a slice of roasted eggplant or roasted red peppers (which will add some sweetness). Bottom line: Delish

A little too rich and buttery. The anchove added a great flavor but It could have used some form of vegetable (maybe spinach or mushrooms)
