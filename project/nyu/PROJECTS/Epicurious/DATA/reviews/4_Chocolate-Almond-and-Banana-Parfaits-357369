I enjoyed the components but not together. It could have been because I used store bought angel food cake with questionable quality, however, even with great cake I still don't think I would love this dessert combination. My husband and I loved the mascarpone mixture and the chocolate, but I am going to develop my own combination for these fabulous sauces.

Really good and very fast to put together. I decided to make it in a trifle dish and realized that the marscapone mixture wasn't enough, so I whipped 1 c. cream with 3 TB confectioner's sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1 TB Frangelico (would have used Amaretto or almond extract, but I didn't have it), and folded it into the marscapone mixture. Substituted my last 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 2 TB Frangelico for the Amaretto in the marscapone. Used 4 bananas, cubed the angel food cake and layered per the recipe. Angel food cake is so moist that you don't need to moisten it (as with regular trifle or tiramisu). Toasted almonds are essential to flavor and crunch (may try a Frangelico/toasted hazelnut version next time). Only complaint is that it could be more visually appealing - the cake, banana and cream layers are pale and the chocolate doesn't really show. Next time I will combine the chocolate sauce with the marscapone mixture. And perhaps something red to brighten it up- strawberries, pomegranate seeks, raspberries? Perhaps pomegranate seeds, they may detract less from the subtle banana flavor, and provide some color and crunch.

One fork for simplicity, otherwise boring, expensive, and tasteless.

Easy and tasty. This is comparable to what you would get at a fine restaurant! I made this for a dinner party and it was the perfect ending. I received rave reviews from everyone. I did use more banana than the recipe called for, glad I did, it was a wonderful balance to the chocolate. I was not able to find mascarpone cheese, so I created a substitute: 16 oz Cream cheese 1/3 c. sour cream 1/4 c. heavy whipping cream (blend all ingredients together until smooth...I used my KitchenAid mixer) Since mascarpone can be expensive and sometimes unavailable at our market, this may be my new solution for Tiramisu! Also, I cut up the angel food cake in small bite sized pieces. This recipe is easily doubled!

Easy, elegant and delicious. I used 3/4 tsp almond extract instead of the liqueur to make it kid friendly and used both bananas and strawberries. This will be my go to dessert in the summer.

This makes great leftovers too! I had leftovers of all the components, so tonight we put the custard on top of the cake, piled on some strawberries, and topped it with the chocolate sauce (thinned with more cream) and almonds. Delicious!

Very easy, very nice. I didn't have Amaretto, so I used Cointreau, and that contrasted nicely with the chocolate.

This dessert was so quick to make and it was very delicious!! Definitely less time to make than stated on the recipe and it is a nice light dessert. I combined the chocolate sauce with the mascarpone mixture and the combination was really good because there was chocolate with every bite and took out an extra step. This recipe is a keeper!

I'm usually so disinterested with dessert recipes that I don't even bother, but this was so easy and delicious! I made each parfait in small disposable clear party cups for easy transport and clean-up. I ended up having one extra, and it stayed good in the fridge for 2 days (but eating it freshly prepared was the best). The DiSaronno mascarpone cream was outstanding.

Wonderful dessert and so very easy. Can have everything prepared and then let your guests assemble their own, adding other fixins if they so desire...

Amazing! I made these exactly as written, I think. It doesn't specify granulated or powered sugar, so I used powdered (it made more sense). The angel food slices really added a great solid texture. Less is definitely more with the amaretto, you don't want it too alcohol-y tasting. I have a feeling I'll end up making these as afternoon snacks...who needs ice cream?!?

I made this for a decadent little afternoon snack (it was just one of those days!). FABULOUS. First, with the Amaretto, less is more you definitely don't want to add too much. Second, the angel food cake made a perfect light layer with the marscarpone and the almonds gave a great little crunch. It was so easy to whip up--not even ten minutes--- so it would be great for entertaining so you aren't slaving over assembly (or guests can build their own!). I think it could also be well adapted to a full-size trifle for a showstopper (at least until you spoon into it!) I made it exactly as written, except for I used powered sugar instead of granulated (you'll read it doesn't specify but powered made a little more sense to me in this case).
