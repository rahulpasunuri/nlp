A very, very easy recipe, but too bland for my taste. I agree with the other reviewer about omitting the preserves.

I like this recipe, but would omit the preserves. They obscured the flavor of the custard.

This was so wonderful. I doubled the recipe because the size of the dinner party. Made it the day before, garnished with a fresh raspverry and a sprig of mint. It was beautiful, as well as delicious.

It's offical. This is bomb proof! I used 1/2 sugar, 1/2 Splenda. I was short about 1/4 cup of the Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2 I used, and topped it up to the required liquid with skim milk! My ramekins were of varying sizes. Despite all this, it was delicious, and, pretty healthy with the substitutions. Definitely a keeper. Can't see why you couldn't use other kinds of berries and jam with this recipe.

This was delicious and so easy.

Absolutely delicious, but the thing that's best about this recipe is that it can be made a day ahead. With fresh raspberries in season, this is a keeper!

I used Spenda instead of sugar and fat free half & half. I also doubled the receiiipe and it still turned out good.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was well received. I was afraid it might be too rich, but it came out fairly light and not overly sweet. It was also my first attempt at custard, but the directions were clear and easy to follow. I only had 1/2 cup ramekins so I reduced the amount of preserves in the bottom (about 2tsps)and filled them very full with the custard. I only had about a 1/4 c too much. Also, it took mine about 45 minutes to set, but that could have been b/c I kept opening the oven :D. Note: the raspberries will float up to the top.

Simply a perfect dessert--rich and delicious, with no adornment except powdered sugar. This will become my new no-fail custard recipe as well. I love them warm.
