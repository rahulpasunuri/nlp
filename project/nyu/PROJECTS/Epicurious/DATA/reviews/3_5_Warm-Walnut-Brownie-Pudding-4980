It is similar to my other recipes except it has double the walnuts, which I wanted to try, but I now think a half cup is better. Is there such a thing as TOO many toasted waluts? Apparently. I liked using up some leftover buttermilk instead of sweet milk. For the syrup I cut the coffee powder down to a generous teaspoon so that I could cut the brown sugar down to a half cup, and I did not want the coffee flavor SO strong. Good choice for me. I like the brownie pudding cakes in Better Homes cookbook and Edna Staebler's Schmecks book better. Will not make this one again.

Hade high expectations, but in the end was disappointed. It had a cake texture and not that of a dense brownie. Wasn't very sweet either.

i like this recipe because it's extremely easy to throw together on a weeknight, with limited ingredients that i always have on hand. i tend to have to bake it longer than the recipe calls for. and the finished product is quite sweet. i place a layer of sliced bananas on the bottom and put in 1/2 nuts, 1/2 chocolate chips.

Boring... The pudding had more of a spongy, "cakey" texture than dense brownie texture. The sauce was absorbed by the brownie within one hour of it being taken out of the oven, so there was no trace of it. The whole thing looked and tasted like simple chocolate sponge cake, without any frosting.

Very rich. Very good. A crowd pleaser and reasonably easy to make.

I'm a big chocoholic and this recipe satisfied my cravings. I substituted whole milk for buttermilk and the recipe still tasted great. I would probably use less espress powder the next time and less water in the syrup (the syrup did not thicken as much as I thought it would). I'm putting this on the dinner party dessert list!

I was expecting much more from this recipe. It was only okay warm from the oven. Tasted better the next day.

Two things I love about this recipe: it is easy to make and more than satifies the choclate craving. Me and all my chocoholic girlfriends at work think this dessert is to die for. Would make this again in a minute.

I have prepared this dessert several times for company I wanted to impress. It certainly did impress them!! I serve it with a scoop of GOOD Vanilla Ice Cream.

I have a recipe from a women's magazine called (improbably) Willard Scotts Hot Fudge Cake. It is easier to make and is devine. It calls for Milk not buttermilk. The walnuts do not have to be toasted. The brownie batter is made and placed in a greased pan. The brown sugar and cocoa are sprinkled over the batter and 1 3/4 cup hot tap water is pured over everything. It looks gross, but after baking 35 to 40 minutes is delicious.

This one didn't particularly "wow" me as I read the recipe but wait until you taste it!!! I made it last minute as a children's dessert (substituting skim milk powder for the espresso powder). The kids LOVED it and the adults couldn't keep thier hands out of it (even though we already had our own decadent dessert). Everyone came back for more. I'm not a big fan of brownies myself but these were beyond brownies... the sauce really adds something. It's a real crowd pleaser.

Very quick and easy, and absolutely delicious. I e-mailed the recipe to one of my guests and she makes it all the time now.

Moist and decadent! A rich chocolate taste that will satisfy even the worst chocoholics. I think it is better just barely warm rather than hot from the oven since the sauce thickens nicely.

Easy and oh so moist and delicious. Everyone loved them.
