These are my favorite brownies. I will never make another. I have been trying to find a non-cakey very fudgy brownie. I have this recipe memorized its so easy and super fast. I use Ghirardelli Cocoa and its really good with a touch of coffee flavor or instant coffee. I think a bit of coffee adds a really rich taste to cocoa.

This is a great brownie recipe. Not too heavy (for brownies!) and outstanding dark chocolate flavor. Perfect blend of fudgy to ever-so-slightly cakey texture. I added a handful of dark chocolate chunks and upped the salt to a teaspoon. So easy, just used one bowl, quick dessert. Quick cleanup. Took more like 35-40min to cook. Will definitely make again.

Amazing. I was having a severe chocolate craving and didn't have any chocolate in the house, but I did have plenty of cocoa powder. I made them as they are, I just sprinkled chopped hazelnuts on top. It took me 40 minutes to bake- maybe it's my oven. But they are perfect, totally hit the spot. I liked the kosher salt- it gives a little unexpected salty kick every so often. I am never going to buy a brownie mix again- this is perfect, and really didn't take much longer than a box.

Simple and easy recipes for delicious brownies. Maybe add some dried cherries or cranberries to jazz them up a bit. Either way, it's a winner.

Definitely a quick and easy recipe. I made it with Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa and the result was to die for! Love it.

I'm famous for my lack of baking skills, so when I decided to make brownies needless to say friends and family were skeptical about the outcome. Not only were these easy enough for me to make, they were AMAZING. Probably some of the best brownies I've ever had. I did decide to tweak the recipe a bit by tossing in 2 handfuls of chocolate chips, but I think it would be just as good with out.

I made these brownies last night on the spur of the moment and they were fast, easy, and delicious. I used good ol' Hershey's regular cocoa and it was perfectly fine. Also added pecans. Baked them in a convection oven at 325º for 25 minutes and they were gooey when I tasted them warm last night (perfect for hot fudge brownie sundaes), but had set up by morning (still soft and fudgy, just like I prefer).
