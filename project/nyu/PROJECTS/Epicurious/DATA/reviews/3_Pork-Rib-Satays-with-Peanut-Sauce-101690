FYI-Sambal oelek, popular throughout Indonesia, Malaysia and southern India, is a multipurpose condiment (sambal). Its most basic form is a simple mixture of chiles, brown sugar and salt.

After all the rave reviews, I expected something so much better! The ribs were ok, but nothing I would make again. On the other hand, I loved the sauce, but will admit that I did not make it as described in the recipe. I just took the marinade the pork cooked in (didn't need any water because of the all juice from the ribs), put it in a pot on the stove and added approximately 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. I whisked that in the sauce while the ribs were browning, and that was it! I saved the leftover sauce - I am looking forward to trying it with chicken or pork chops, but I don't think I would make the ribs again.

I made this for the manly men at a cocktail party ... and they were gobbled up. Easy and good, a definite keeper. Don't know whta the heck 'sambal oelek' is in the peanut sauce, but it came out just dandy!

Loved it! I have made it both broiling and grilling. Grill if you can it is sooo much better!

I had pre-threaded chicken satays that I needed to use. Found this recipe provided the perfect marinade. Marinated chicken for 1 hour, then baked in the marinade on a shallow baking dish for 15-17 minutes. Made without the peanut oil or sauce, since my husband is allergic. Instead, used an orange-sesame dipping sauce and served the rice/soybean dish, both available on this site. With all the rave reviews, I'll try the pork ribs next time.

Used this marinade with de-boned pork loin cut into thin strips - then threaded onto skewers for a satay, sprinkled with sesame seeds and grilled. Also made chicken satay (recipe on this site) served with peanut sauce and tzatsiki, greek salad and garlic buttered pita bread as appetizer course at a large org's bbq I volunteered to cater. The satay is always a hit . . . didn't need a main course of bbq chicken . . . just more satay . . . (way more, as everyone wanted more than just 2 or 3). My only caution is the threading on skeweres in quite time consuming if you have to do more than a dozen leave yourself lots of time. Also cutting in strips is easier if you pound out the chicken and pork loin first (gently) to a uniform thickness.

This is an excellent fusion recipe to keep in the cookbook. I had pork chops (which I brined, because I like to keep meats juicy) and let them marinate overnight. I then cut the loin part into strips and also grilled the bones. I think that the marinade needed everything that went into it and was delicious. There was just enough spice to hint at fire without the four alarm aftertaste. This marinade is a keeper.

Made these for our Oscar party (and used the pineapple slices/ chafing dish suggestion) - I was a little disappointed, but the guests LOVED them - a double recipe disappeared, even with tons of other food.

I made this recipe for a party of 100, did all the prep work 1-2 days ahead and just grilled before delivery. They were placed in a chafing dish with a few pinapple rings to keep them moist under heat - it seemed the longer they sat the more fall-off-the-bone tasty they became. Once guest discovered them (they are definately messy) they crowded around the chafer and completely polished them off!!

Once again, these ribs were the hit of the party! I cooked them early in the day, and at about 10:30, when the party was in full swing, I remembered that I had never finished. So, I popped them under the broiler, put them out of the table and 5 minutes later they were gone. The peanut sauce was sitting right next to them and was not touched. Everyone ate them plain. YUM. Make this dish, folks. You will not regret it!

This was a wonderful addition to an appetizer party. For a speedy sauce, I strained the juices form the ribs and added peanut butter. I heated to blend the flavors. It was quite good.

I made this dish as the appetizer course for our dinner club last night. It won rave reviews. The ribs were tender and delicious. Because of earlier reviews here, I was somewhat uncertain about whether the peanut sauce would be worthwhile. However, it was better than any I've had with satay at Thai restaurants! Frying the peanuts to a deep golden brown gave the sauce flavor and texture I didn't expect. I didn't bother to serve vegetables with it as suggested, but I wish I had provided toast points so that we all could have sopped up the sauce from our plates. All the flavors--ribs and sauce--were wonderful together. P.S., I simmered the sauce until it reached the consistency I wanted; it wasn't watery at all.

I am a chef in the Caribbean and made this dish for visiting foreign ambassadors (who loved it!) I used the same marinade for shrimp satay and served a cucumber salad on the side for sunset coctail hour. Instead of the peanut sauce recipe (I was concerned about the report of it being very wtery) I used "A Taste of Thai" peanut sauce which was well received. Try the Classic Coconut and Chicken soup as the next course...

We loved the ribs and have made them several times. The peanut sauce is a flop and way too much work. A killer sauce to go with it the Spicy Peanut Cilantro Dressing from Sam Choy's Island Flavors (a great cookbook if you don't have it). The combo is addictive. We took it to a superbowl party and it was a huge it.

I used pork spare ribs, and it was very good. Loved the peanut sauce.

I think those 1 fork reviews must have mixed up their recipes. Where did 2 C. water come from? This recipe is definately a keeper, especially for parties, but double the recipe because they go fast!

Too much trouble for a so-so dish. We brushed the ribs with peanut oil before grilling because they looked so dry. We browned the peanuts in the microwave, and they were the best part of the recipe. At least we did not waste a cup of peanut oil! We are out of a ton of shallots, ginger, and garlic, and we are not pleased. Mushy & disappointing.

The flavor was nice, but the consistency was VERY WATERY - almost like a soup, not a sauce. Because of this quality it was not very usable. Maybe the amount of water called for in the recipe is incorrect (2 + cups)?

The recipe of the sauce is incomplete, there should be kecap sauce in it or kecap + sweet tamarind sauce

Made this dish twice, once as an appetizer for a cocktail party and again as a main course for a dinner party. It was a hit both ways. In fact, for the main course, I substituted pork chops for the ribs and it worked just as well. It's a nice change from typical bbq rib fare.
