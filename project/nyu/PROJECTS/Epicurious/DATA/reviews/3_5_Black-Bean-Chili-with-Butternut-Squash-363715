Delicious and hearty. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of vegetable broth. I also used quinoa instead of bulgar. I did add extra chipotle chiles and some red pepper flakes because we like the spice plus a quick pour of white wine. Really flavorful unlike what others have mentioned.

It was wonderful, but I couldn't find bulgar, so I substiuted Brown rice, and it was great, butnext time I am going to skip them both all together and lessen the water by a cup.

4 forks with my additions/substitutions: I used quinoa instead of bulgar, roasted butternut squash, chicken stock instead of water, and added in two large cinnamon sticks, honey, and a generous glug of IPA beer. The stew turned out amazing!

Agree with many reviewers this is rather bland as written. I used dried beans I had presoaked, home made chicken broth instead of water and only about 3 cups of it, and ended up doubling almost all of the spices, adding jalepenos and hot red peppers, and we still didn't think it had much heat, so added tabasco sauces at the table! I really wanted to like this, but was disappointed in lack of heat. Will freeze half for later and remember to add add'l peppers or spices to bring up the heat level.

If you live at altitude, like I do, do NOT try to cook black beans--use canned ones. They will never get soft. Ever. I have cooked them just fine when I lived at sea level, but anything above 5000 ft and you can only cook them with a pressure cooker.

I am a vegetarian in training, so, I have been experimenting with different recipes. I actually made this for my husbands employees so I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly except I put it in the oven on 250 and left it for 5 hours. Then I put in the squash and Quinoa instead of Bulgar. I have seen the other reviews and maybe more cooking improves the results. Definitely a keeper. Will get reviews from the "boys" tonight. They are all BIG meat eaters...........

Made this for our Super Bowl party. I took others advice and roasted the squash, used canned beans, and added extra peppers for some heat. I was a vegetarian for 15 years and thought it was a descent recipe; everyone else at the party (all meat eaters) left their bowls unfinished. I would definitely not serve this again to non-vegetarians.

I'd give it a 4, but made some modifications. After the reviews about blandness, I used veggie stock instead of water. I halved the recipe but didn't cut the seasonings in 1/2 (probably more like 1/4). I don't really measure, but I was semi-heavy handed with the chili powder and added some cumin. I also added in a red bell pepper with the onion. 2 hours was plenty of time for my beans (pleasantly surprised) and I really didn't need any of the toppings.Excellent winter dish. Warm, soothing and vegetarian. Yum.

I haven't tried this recipe, however I have tried one simular. I used green/red peppers, jalepeno peppers, cumin, chili powder, crushed garlic, onions and can black beans and placed all in a crock pot for 5 hours..

This was very yummy and fairly easy. A few additions I made: added a diced green pepper, cumin, and a splash of red wine vinegar (at the very end).

I thought this was a great and unexpected way to use butternut squash. I mostly followed the recipe except that I added roasted peeled poblano peppers, used chicken stock instead of water, and used canned black beans for the sake of time. It came together perfectly for a weeknight dinner in about 45 minutes.

Rating: 2
Why, oh WHY did I not use PRE-SOAKED black beans! It took 7, yes SEVEN hours for my black beans to soften...and not even as soft as I like them. Glad I didn't make them for company. Would have had to order a pizza instead. I added Seitan for extra protein. It got spongy with the extra cooking time.

This recipe was a classic case of good, but not quite there. For the first three hours I followed the recipe as written (other than using some left over stock in place of some of the water). When I tasted it at that point, it really didn't have the most exciting of flavors, so I had to start doctoring. I added another can of the fire roasted tomatoes, some roasted red bell peppers (jarred), some cilantro, a diced anaheim chile pepper and some ancho chile powder and let it cook for another 15 minutes. It was much better with the additions. I think this recipe is a good starter, but you need to feel bold enough to start adding to it.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as is and I love it, but I should have read the reviews first to make it a little less spicy. I'll definitely make it again with the suggestions from previous reviewers.

Rating: 2
The recipe took a lot of doctoring to become good. I sauteed 3 slices of bacon, 13oz of linguica, and then procced with the onions. I added buckwheat because that's what I had at hand. The recipe came out blah, so I added ketchup, worstershire, soy, salt, and sugar, in a sip and stir method until it was ok. Served with smoked shredded cheddar, gouda, and gruyere, chipotle and cilantro creama, red onions, etc. There are better chili recipes out there.

Meh. I've been excited to make this for months; pretty much disappointed. The spice is nice and sultry, but the combination of bulgur, black beans, and butternut squash would be better lent to a cold spring salad as opposed to a muddy chili. the toppings (greek yogurt, green chilis, hot sauce, avocado) were a saving grace.

Rating: 3
I thought this was good, but nothing special, if not a bit bland, when served without the condiments suggested. The fresh cilantro, sour cream ( I used Greek yogurt) and pickled jalepenos really kicked it up a notch, and I loved it with these additions.

Rating: 3
My husband and I thought this was really good, but our boys - 6 and 9 did not like it which surprised me. It may have been the chipotle with the adobo sauce. So if you're making this for elementary kids, you may not want to put the chipotle pepper in to avoid chaos at the table.

I read the recipe wrong and thought I needed canned beans. So ended up making the recipe with a can of black beans and a can of spicy chili beans. I left out the chili peppers. So good! Can't wait to make it again. It was a good use of butternut squash. I have a bunch of them from my garden which I couldn't find a good recipe to use them for. Thanks for sharing!

Hearty and tasty - especially with sour cream, sweet onions, and cilantro on top. After I read the reviews, I cut back on the water to make a thick chili. Also used tablespoons as measures of chili powder (thanks again, reviewers!). Used four chipotle peppers - was a good decision for my spice preferences.

I made half the recipe and ate it a day later over whole wheat penne. I added a little homemade Italian sausage and substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream. Next time I would add more than a cup and a half of squash. It was delicious with all the toppings minus jalapeno.

This was wonderful...full of flavor, filling, and great for a wintry evening meal. Will definitely make again!

Prepped all the veggies last night, turned on the crock pot this morning, added the bulgur when I got home from work,and we enjoyed our meal an hour later. What could be simpler? Added a bit more spice than the recipe called for and subbed canned red beans for the black, becuase that's what I had on hand. Loved the squash in this chili!

Always love a recipe where everything can be cooked in one pot. I thought it was very tasty. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for garnish.

Loved this chili. I was a mild hot- mild enough my children could enjoy it. The chipolte chili's in adobe sauce added a wonderful smokey flavor. I would also soak the beans in advance to decrease cooking time next time. Will definitely be making again.

@Gribbin - 2 1/2 Tablespoons - and even that could be increased. I'm using a tweaked version of this for a chili cook off tomorrow. I brought my trial-run, straight-from-the-recipe chili to work today and it's getting RAVE reviews.

I was very disappointed in this chili. I cooked it for over 5 hours and the beans were still not totally soft. Also did not have much flavor.

I have made this before. It is very good. Not it really is not a chili as chili is a meat dish. Also Ihad this served to me more than 30 years ago in many parts on New Mexico esp in the North West portion. It was called bean and Squash stew or soup. While I am very proud of my home state , California, I have only seen this available recently so I would hesitate to give this a home state of Cali. and would look to New Mexico of even Cuba for this dish.

I LOVE this recipe! It's so easy to make as well. I used chicken broth just because I like the added "oomph" it gives. And I roasted the squash first too, in some olive oil with s&p. Awesome flavor!

Didn't know what to expect from that recipe and I wasn't disappointed one bit! It's really good! I didn't even put the cheese on top, just cilantro and sour cream.

This was a surprisingly yummy vegetarian chili. I cooked just the onions and garlic on the stovetop and then dumped everything into the crock pot for about 9 hours on low, adding the bulgur with an hour remaining and the squash (which I had already roasted) in the last 30 minutes. My husband likes his chili spicy, so I added two jalapenos, but it still could have used even more of a kick! I used chicken broth instead of water and, since I like a thick chili, halved the liquid (which was plenty). I added green onions and avocado to the toppings and served with a cornbread casserole. Will try adding turkey next time!

Rating: 3
Roasting the squash was a great tip! I roasted the squash with garlic and olive oil and it added that nice rich nutty flavor. I deviated by adding chicken chorizo and backed off on the chipotle as some in my house can't handle the heat. And of course - added cumin. Who can make chili without cumin??

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful chili! The smokiness of the chipotles' adds a lot of flavor but not too much spiciness. I used 5 cans of beans, but since I didn't have the bean liquid from using dried beans, I used a veggie broth, and pureed 2 cans of beans to thicken it. I also added 1 lb. of ground turkey (sans bulgar) but I'd easily add ground or shredded beef:) Oh! Almost forgot, I roasted by squash tossed in olive oil, s&p and dried oregano, I think it makes a sweeter, and more pronounced squash flavor.

Rating: 1
I had high hopes for this one but was totally disappointed. Followed recipe exactly but didn't have all the toppings. Maybe that's where all the flavor was? My squash totally got lost. I did enjoy the bulgar and will probably add it to other chili recipes. This makes a TON of chili...

Rating: 1
I followed recipe closely with the exception that I used 3 dried chipotles (didn't have a can) which i simmered in the chili then removed, seeded, chopped and re-added. And in the end, no matter how many tasty garnishes we add, we find this dull-tasting and uninspiring. Might not make it through the leftovers.

Rating: 4
So yummy!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I used medium bulgur and an extra chipotle. We garnished each serving with chopped onions, cilantro and a squeeze of lime.Although sour cream and cheese would have been delicious, they were not missed at all. Definately highly recommended. We are looking foreword to enjoying the leftovers (makes a large batch).

This goes on our list of recipes we'll be making regularly. I added extra butternut squash (and skipped the condiments) to up the health quotient, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I thought this was even better after it was frozen and reheated - the squash broke down and was almost undetectable, which might be a good idea for those of you trying to sneak your family vegetables!

A great winter chili! In deference to my teenage son I added 1 lb of browned grass fed beef(low fat); cooked and served the sweet potatoes (thanks for the suggestion) separately. He said it needed something extra so he sprinkled on some cinnamon - perfect! We used 2 TB of chili-just the right amount for us; the sweet potatoes contrast nicely. Did not use bulgur but cooked the chili uncovered for the last hour so that more water would boil off-served on top of basmati rice.

Question for those who used canned black beans. What did you adjust the cook time to? Do you still need to add water, and if so, how much? Thanks :)

This is a wonderful chili. The bulgar adds texture, reminding me of ground beef (I don't eat beef anymore, so that was a nice surprise). I disagree with other reviewers about the amount of chipotle chiles--two is plenty, even for folks who like spicy food, as we do. I only substituted yams for the butternut squash--all else as listed.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I made this in the crock pot. Cooked the onions, garlic and spices on the stove and then dumped into the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients. Set it for one hour on high and then 7 hours on low. In the last hour, added quick-cooking barley (couldn't find bulgur) and the squash. The chili came out thick and hearty. (I didn't add the extra salt and used twice as many tomatoes, reducing the water appropriately).

Excellent stuff. Added more chipotle and served with all the toppings. It was devoured.

Like other cooks, I used canned black beans to save time and converted rice because I couldn't find quick-cooking bulgur at either of my local stores. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. We loved it. My daughter is still eating the leftovers and raving every time. Next time I'll make it exactly according to the recipe.

This is a bowl of straight up earth momma goodness. I also roasted the squash, seasoned with salt and pepper and leftover Mexican oregano. Don't skip the accouterments, the cheese, sour cream, onions, cilantro and jalapenos make this dish prettier to look at and even better to eat.

Due to being snowbound, I started this yesterday, finished it today, and will serve tomorrow along with standard meat chili for our Superbowl gathering. It tasted great today, so it will be even better tomorrow. (Followed recipe, but added some yellow hominy for color/texture.) Even the die-hard carnivores will love this!

This was really quite good. I enjoyed the smoky flavor of this chili from the fire-roasted tomatoes and chipotle chilis. I made it with canned beans to shorten up the cooking time, and it worked very well. I also substituted sweet potatoes for the squash (personal preference). Lastly, we served it with plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it was great!

Rating: 3
This was good but not great. I started with dried black beans and they turned the whole pot very black so it wasn't as appetizing as the picture shown in the magazine. The only change I made was to roast the butternut squash separately since I like the flavor of roasted vegetables. If one uses canned black beans, should the amount of water be reduced significantly?

I used 1/2cup millet to replace the bulgur as I am gluten intolerant. It worked fine.

Perfect. Only had canned beans on hand so cut the cutting time accordingly... it was still fabulous. Kids loved it.

We've become weeknight vegetarians at our house, and this was an incredible addition to the repertoire. We followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except for the fact that our butternut squash was a little smaller than it should have been, and we didn't really have time to cut it up enough. So, we had large chunks of squash here and there, instead of evenly distributed bits. I actually liked it that way because it felt a little more rustic and stewy. This one is a keeper! Oh, and I actually presoaked my beans in extremely hot water for about 3 hours to reduce cooking time later.

Try quinoa or rice for a substitute for bulgar

Anybody have any suggestions on a gluten free substitution for the bulgur? I want to make this, but my daughter can't have gluten & bulgur is a wheat.

This recipe is awesome! So delicious and hearty, has a "chili" look and taste to it that so many veggie chilis miss the mark on. It's a perfect weekend meal with the long-cooking time and little hands-on work. Plus, there should be plenty of leftovers that are only better the day after. My only tweak to this recipe would be to add more chilis for those people who like it SPICY.

This is so good! My family of meat and potato eaters would never have known it was meatless if I hadn't told them.
