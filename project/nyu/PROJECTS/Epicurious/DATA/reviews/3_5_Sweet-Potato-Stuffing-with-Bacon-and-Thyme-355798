I have made this recipe for two years now, to great success. It's absolutely delicious. I use homemade turkey stock in place of chicken broth, and this year I added a bit of chopped sage and rosemary along with the thyme. It was magical! This will be one of my Thanksgiving staples for many years to come!

So I plan on making this for Thanksgiving, so I admittedly haven't made it yet. I almost didn't due to the 80% rating, but upon reading the reviews, I see it's really mostly "by A Cook from Minneapolis, MN" and they apparently just didn't read the recipe, which DOES call for both eggs and broth. Please pay attention before leaving negative reviews folks. Your oversight isn't the fault of the recipe creator and lots of us rely on those ratings to help us select recipes for our families.

Excellent stuffing recipe that was the hit of Thanksgiving. Making it again for Christmas. Adding a little extra salt and pepper after the OJ helped the thyme and balance the flavor well. Made ahead on both occasions, as this seemed to marry the flavors well. Not too wet, never dry, but does make enough for a 13x9x2 and a 9x9x2. Good leftovers as well, and paired with the Maple Glazed Turkey and Gravy, simply delicious.

This was the hit of Thanksgiving! I used less bread (about half a loaf less), and I found it to be the perfect moistness. It is a bit time consuming but definitely worth it.

I wasn't so sure about this recipe when I read it, but my husband thought it sounded good, so I went for it. It was delicious. Great way to incorporate sweet potatoes, and anything with bacon in it works for me. I didn't find it to be dry, but I don't care for a super wet stuffing.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It was much too dry. I didn't have a 15x10x2 pan, but there was so much stuffing that it fit in 2 13x9x2 pans. I would never make it again, but if anyone wants to try it (it does have 2 good reviews out there), I'd make sure to have add something else (eggs, broth??) to make sure it is sufficiently moist.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It has a nice balance of savory and sweet. The bacon and chicken broth provide a rich, comforting flavor and the sweetness of the potatoes really pop. The texture was firm which is how I like my stuffing, however, I think the recipe falls short on two things. The aromatics could use a boost and the egg mixture tends to gather on the bottom of the pan during the final bake. I think that the next time I try this recipe out, I may substitute the celery for fennel and I will definitely let the egg mixture soak up a little longer. For now this recipe is being served on Thanksgiving and I plan to compliment some of my quick-made or store-bought entrees with it to add some comfort to the meal.

We really enjoyed this stuffing. It was a great was to incorporate sweet potatoes into a holiday meal without adding another side dish to the menu. I added a little extra thyme.
