Delicious! I added a 1/2 cup cooked lentils to make it a main dish. Use high quality curry powder, and you'll love this dish. The apples and apricots make it a savory, but sweet dish. Definitely a keeper!

What a pleasant mix of flavors! Light, yet aromatic...a great side for grilled chicken or fish. Will make again....and again....

Bland and boring. The flavor of the apple didn't carry through at all. The only thing which saved this was the curry powder I used (Penzey's Maharajah). The onion had no flavor, the ginger was completely inapparant.. Next time, I'll improvise.

Great rice recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. Well maybe more almonds.

I made this last night with spice rubbed leg of lamb and grilled asparagus (both from this web site) and it was wonderful - even though I cuadrupled the recipe. The sad part is the distict absence of left-overs.

Cook from NJ: your rice turned out gummy most likely because you cooked it longer than the directions said.

I doubled this recipe and served it at a potluck and it got rave reviews. I did add sauteed chicken and some dried cranberries, to make it more of a main dish. Everybody loved it and asked for the recipe - I'm making it again tonight using leftover rice!

I really liked the flavors in the dish. I left out the ginger b/c I don't care for it. However mine turned out a little gummy. I added the correct amount of water and cooked it even longer than it said, any suggestions?

We loved the rice, though we'll amend the recipe next time by adding more curry powder and garam marsala. Ours got a little dry as it sat, so next time we'll add a little more water as we reheat it. We really liked the balance of sweet and savory.

Delicious. The sweetness of the apples and dried fruit (I used raisins, but I bet apricots would have been great) balances the spicy, savory curry flavors. I was generous with the curry powder, using over 1-1/2 t instead of just 1-1/4. After the rice is done and you stir it, the apples simply disintegrate into the dish. Yummy with the Tandoor-Spiced Chicken Breasts.

In contrast to a previous reviewer, I thought this recipe had too little curry, if anything. It was very sweet. This would have been nice if I'd planned for it and complimented it with an appropriate dish, but I'd thought it would have a little more kick to it. At any rate, I'd make it again.

Very tasty, I found the curry/sweet balance was perfect. I served with apple brandied pork chops over a bed of wilted spinach with apple juice/apple cider vinegar dressing. Fabulous!

This dish smells wonderful! It was easy because you throw most of the spices into the pan first, then add the rice, apples, etc. The rest is simply a matter of letting it cook. I did not use apricots or almonds, but it was still delicious. Served with garam masala spiced/grilled duck breasts, and grilled onion/tomato salad. Yummy.

I thought the curry overpowered the other flavors a bit too much. I would use less curry. The apples and apricots lend a nice sweetness.

This was quite highly rated and looked quite simple, but tasty, so I made it today. I did, however, use brown basmati and raisins, instead of white and apricots, because I didn't have them on hand. I didn't have a cinnamon stick either, so I used ground cinnamon, and I didn't know how much to substitute, so I put in about 1/2 tsp, which I think may have been too much, as it was fairly sweet. If anyone can tell me what the correct amount should be, I'd appreciate it. Finally, I undersalted it slightly, so I think I'll try it again with a cinnamon stick and more salt, and hopefully it will turn out better.

What a delicious low fat rice dish! I really liked it alot! I served with the mustard-rosemary roast chicken and it was a pleasant surprise from the usual white rice and gravy, will definitely make again. This time I didn't toast the almonds, next time I will.

Maybe even 3.5 forks. Very good! Served it with tandoori-spice chicken breasts, and although it didn't do much to save my burning tongue, it was delicious. The addition of the fruit really makes this recipe....otherwise it would be pretty uneventful.

I've made this pilaf several times, its beautiful and very fragant. I served it with pan seared scallops in a ginger cream sauce.

I liked this rice. I served it with the Malaysian Chicken which I highly recommend. I didn't have the almonds and really didn't miss them. The dried apricot gives the rice a good flavor.

I have made this a few times now. It goes great with Tandoori chicken, or any other spicy meat. The apples cut the heat and give it a nice taste.

This was easy to make and we actually had all the ingredients (a rarity)!. Spicy but not too spicy, we'll try this one again, perhaps with chicken.

This dish was a hit at our gourmet club "applefest" dinner! Everyone devoured it and I got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

Not only was this incredibly easy, but it smelled wonderful and tasted even better... I made it to go with chicken curry and the sweetness of the fruit in the rice complimented the spice in the curry perfectly!

Went wonderfully with juicy scallops in cider sauce. I used chrystalised ginger, which was quite strong, so reduced the quantity. Don't overdo the curry powder if yuo are serving this with something delicate.

This is a delicious dish and very easy to make, the apple lends lovely tartness and the almonds a perfect crunch to the rice. Would definitly make again!
