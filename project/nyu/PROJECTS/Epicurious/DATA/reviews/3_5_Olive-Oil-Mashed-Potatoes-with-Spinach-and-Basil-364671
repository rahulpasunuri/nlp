It was my first time making mashed potatoes from fresh potatoes and I am happy that I settled for this recipe. In addition to the mentioned ingredients, I also added freshly grated Parmesan and some heavy cream, and I sauteed the spinach with onions. I also used regular fine salt. It turned out really well and everybody liked it.
