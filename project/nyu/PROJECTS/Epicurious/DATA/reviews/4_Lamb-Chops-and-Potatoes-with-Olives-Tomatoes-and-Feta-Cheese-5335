This was incredible. I had never really cooked lamb before and what's more challenging, I used thick cut lamb chops. I did what my mother told me and just cooked the lamb for a little longer (not more than 15) than the receipe stated. My partner loves lamb and olive anything he almost did a face plant into this dish. I must admit it made me look like an gourmet chef and it was really easy to make!!! The secret is the presentation. This is a stunning smelling dish as it cooks but what will "WOW" everyone is the presentation.

This was a hit for my whole family, including three children under the age of 5. I partially cooked boiling potatoes in the microwave, then peeled them and let them finish roasting in the oven, with the lamb.

Superb! I broiled the chops on high to Med. Rare. Great presentation and great raves. Can't wait to make it again!

Simple, delicious, and impressive. Make sure to grill the chops in a bit of olive oil for 60 to 90 seconds each side, and cut down the baking time to 15 minutes. This recipe makes perfect lamp chops.

This was easy and delicious. Took the advice to prepare the lamb on the grill rather than the oven. Used Baby Dutch potatoes, but I think any potato would be good. Will make this again soon.

THIS IS REALLY DELICIOUS BUT I HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS. 1) MAKE THE LAMB CHOPS SEPARATELY (GRILLED, PAN FRIED OR WHATEVER) BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO ENSURE THEY COME OUT TO YOUR DESIRED DONENESS. 2) DOUBLE THE TOMATO, FETA AND OLIVE AMOUNTS. IT'S THE STAR HERE.

Many thanks, you great reviewers! I quartered Yukon Golds & roasted 20 mins. then added browned chops & cooked 15 mins. Served with R Ray's Orange- Scented green beans; excellent as well as pretty!

This is the first recipe I've rated. I've made many off of Epicurioius, but this is the first one I felt compeled to comment on. It was a last minute meal idea and it was fast and wonderful!

Easy and delicious. Also sprinkled with chopped parsley at the end. And using unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes instead of peeled russets didn't detract from it at all. An absolute favorite.

This was very tasty and fast. It was a fast midweek dinner for us but I would use thi recipe to entertain. Lamb loin chops are the little black dress for the plate--always classy. Based on other reviews, I broiled the chops instead of baking so that they would be well browned outside, rare inside. My husband, who claimed not to like rare lamb has now changed his opinion based on this recipe. My kids (both under three) enjoyed this dish. Next time I will add a dash of parsley to the tomato because it needs a touch of green

Great recipe lots of flavor. Watch the roasting time for the potatoes and lamb they are too long. I combined the tomatoes, feta, and olives before serving. As a side dish I made Sauteed Haricots Verts, Red Bell Peppers, and Pine Nuts. Excellent dinner.

A friend made this for me and I thought it was absolutely divine. A squirt of lemon over the roasted meat is the only thing I would add next time. I rarely give four forks, but -- wow!

This is delicious, and a good prepare-ahead dish for a dinner party. Next time I will brown the lamb chops before roasting them, which would make for a more attractive presentation. Also, I tossed the tomatoes, olives and cheese with the potatoes to warm and soften the cheese a bit. I've served the potatoes with a rack of lamb, and think they would be good with just about any roast - they are full of flavor!

This is one of our favorite recipies! We cooked the chops on the 'barbie' so this was really easy to make. Yum!

This is good and easy. I added some heated artichoke hearts to the platter, alternating with the chops to complete the meal.

I did a variation of the recipe on the grill. It was fabulous. I did the potatoes in an old foil pan and add just a little more oil. Cook for about 50 minutes. Pierce them with a fork to tell if done. I also grilled the chops over medium heat on a gas grill for 20 minutes turning every four minutes. The taste combination of the feta & the olives was exquisite with lamb. A refreshing change from the good old grilled chops and mint sauce.
