The Cook's notes indicates you can substitute for the 1 1/2 cups Seville orange juice using 1/4 cup regular orange juice and 1/4 cup lime juice, however, that amount comes to 1/2 cup liquid and the recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups. Is there an error here or should you use just 1/2 cup liquid or. . . ?

I have been using this recipe with other meat dishes and we absolutely love it. I highly recommend it. My 8 year old daughter is always asking to make it again......we're trying it tonight for the first time with the Yucatecan pork recipe....Mmmmmm can't wait..:)
