I didn't like this at all - too minty.

I thought this was quite good. I didn't give it four forks because I wasn't in ecstacy with every bite, but it was yummy. I cooked it for longer (just over an hour) and used one large butternut squash. NOTE: use gloves when cutting your butternut squash as some people can have a skin reaction. I had one....it went away, but it was not fun. Anyway, the balance of flavours is quite nice. I can imagine it would also be nice with some queso fresco, goat cheese or a bit of feta sprinkled over top.

4 forks because my guests LOVED it so much. Used tiny sweet farmer's market squash. Drizzled with saba instead of balsalmic, otherwise as written. Easy, pretty, healthy, delicious.

Simple and delicious! (I served the reoasted squash seeds instead of the pepitas which were not on hand.)

Made as is... Wonderful way to make acorn squash!
