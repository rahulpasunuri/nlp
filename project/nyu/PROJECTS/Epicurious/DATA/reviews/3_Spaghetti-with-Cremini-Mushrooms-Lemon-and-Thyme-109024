Although this tasted OK, it was a bland dissappointment. It seemed like it needed something to perk it up. I think I might try it again using the other suggestions of more lemon, wine and more cheese. I needed double the cooping water to keep it moist. It took me longer than the stated 45 minutes. I could have fixed a pizza in less time and would have enjoyed it more.

this wasn't bad, but it just wasn't good enough to justify the time spent prepping.

My family loved this recipe. I found that I needed twice as much of the pasta water to keep the dish moist. This recipe is going into my permanent collection of recipes for regular rotation!

It is delicious, and i would make it anytime for my family. I made it for Christmas, and they bugged me until i made it again this year.

This dish was very tasty...1.5 lbs. seems like a ridiculous amount of mushrooms, but it gives the dish a really earthy mushroom-y flavour and is a definite must-make if you love mushrooms. I can imagine it'd be even tastier with a bit more in the way of fresh herbs, or maybe combining the creminis with some baby bellas. All in all, it was pretty good and I'd definitely have it again.

I thought this very good and easy. I used a mixture of cremini, shitake and portabello mushrooms. It was a good Sunday night dinner.

I like this recipe because it's easy. I used regular white mushrooms because I couldn't find cremini mushrooms at the store...go figure, I live 15 miles away from Kennett Square, PA (mushroom capital of the world). At the end, instead of adding pasta water to moisten pasta, I added more lemon juice, white wine, and olive oil. I thought it needed a little sprucing up. It wasn't the best thing I've ever made, but I will make it again.
