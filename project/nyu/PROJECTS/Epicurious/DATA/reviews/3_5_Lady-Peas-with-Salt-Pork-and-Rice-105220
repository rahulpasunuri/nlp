i decided to put this over noodles instead of rice, instead of rice. If you like Ramen, then this is a great recipe. Also, spiking this with hot sauce is a great idea, if you like your food a little spicy (or a lot :))

For a picture of Lady cream peas, see the June 2011 Southern Living magazine, p. 12 (photos of in season field peas). I found Lady cream peas at my farmers market this morning and this was my first experience eating these wonderful summertime field peas. Instead of using salt pork, I simply fried a couple of strips of bacon. Removed them to paper towels to drain and then followed the remaining cooking instructions. I did not add the green scallions nor did I serve with rice, but simply topped with crumbled bacon and served as a side dish. Very tender peas with a delicate/mild flavor.

I recently found Lady Cream Peas in my grocery store and bought them on a whim. Not knowing anything about them I found this article very informative: http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/extension/newsletters/vpmnews/dec01/art3dec.html

Great recipe, and very tasty. Made this after going to a local farmer's market at a church. FYI, lady pease look like solid green black-eyed peas, which can be substituted in this recipe. I gather this is more a Southern thing than anywhere else, and usually only purchased in a farmer's market type setting.

This was a straightforward, simple preparation for fresh lady peas I found at the farmer's market. I'd never had lady peas before - this dish made a tasty summer supper of them.

I'm glad this recipe came with photo. What is a "lady pea"? Does look different than regular green sweet pea. Could not find in food dictionary. Anyone--please advise...Thanks!
