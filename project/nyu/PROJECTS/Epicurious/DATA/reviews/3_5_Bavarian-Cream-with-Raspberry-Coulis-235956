I have made this Bavarian cream several times, and I have streamlined the steps so it's much simpler and reliable. I bloom 1T gelatin (one envelope) in 1/3C water. I beat together the egg yolks, sugar, milk and vanilla and add them all at once to the saucepan on low heat. The mixture must be stirred constantly until thickened. I remove the custard from heat, stir some into the gelatin to further dissolve it, then stir the gelatin into the custard mixture. Then, strain it and cool it, and add the whipped cream.

I am sorry....this recipe is so so in my book. I will NOT be repeating this one. The directions need to be more clear and I ended up with a blobby pudding type thing. All I tasted was whipped cream. Yuck! Never again.

Amazing! Must admit, I altered and used less gelatin (only about a teaspoon), so I could inject it into cupcakes. I was also so amazing on its own, my guests ate the leftover cream after the cupcakes were gone! :)

I gave this 4 forks because the taste of the end product deserved that rating. I agree with akalish NY/NY the timing of the addition of whipped cream is crucial to the appearance of the final product. The egg and gelatin mixture need to be cool to prevent melting the cream but, once the custard and gelatin begins to thicken it does so too fast to fold in the cream without it clumping. I made the coulis which could be made using other berries, but should not be omitted. I will try using a food mill next time to remove the seeds though. Too time consuming with the sieve and had to add drops of water near the end to get as much as I did. Will definitely make again, but with the noted changes.

I haven't made this recipe. I just wanted to comment that it is mistagged as 'vegetarian.' Unless there is some new kind of gelatin that doesn't come from animals, this is not veg.

Only made the Bavarian Cream. The flavor was great and it didn't turn out clumpy at all. Just know it takes awhile to cook in the double boiler. I was slow on getting the ice bath together, and it still worked out well. I wonder if any gelatin is needed for this recipe. Or perhaps cut it down to only 1/3 of the amount. Turned out too stiff.

Great recipe and with this recipe being so old I feel I'm owed an apology for not having had the chance to taste this delicious treasure before. My only tips are to make sure you have all your ingredience and tools in place before you start and TEMPER (pour the milk into the egg mixture very slowly) the egg mixture. If not your Cream will be lumpy. I substituted strawberries for seasonal reasons and my guest and I loved it!

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a smash hit. It was gone in ten minute! This recipe is a little labor and time intensive, but well worth the trouble. I was a little worried about mixing in the gelatin, after reading some of the review, but followed the recipe precisely and I had no problems with it. It really helps if you have someone to help you standing by. The final product looked a bit clumpy, but the texture was pretty smooth. I loved the flavor of the coulis with the cream. I only managed to get a few teaspoons in, but it was absolutely delicious.

I admit I had a lot of question marks appear over my head while preparing this. My stress level also was rising because I was literally trying to finish the custard before folding in the whipped cream with the clock ticking down to me getting back to play the last few notes of backstage keyboard at the opera house! I just made it back in time, though. Be sure to have your bowl of ice water prepping (in your freezer, perhaps?), as I was frantically finding bowls, filling them with water, and throwing them in the freezer, as we had no ice maker or ice cube trays at our provided housing. This is what nearly made it not come together. I paired this with the new buckwheat crepe recipe and served it as a German tri-color dessert (black, yellow, red) at a Hansel and Gretel performance to our singers. They loved it, and I would definitely make this again.

I've never had bavarian cream before and now I have to admit that I'm an addict. I halved the recipe and subbed 2 tsp vanilla extract for the beans/paste, adding the extract right before dunking the bowl in ice water. My only difficulty was that the mixture went from liquidy to nearly solid in seconds and I was a little late on folding in my whipped cream, so i suggest folding it in while the mixture has cooled but is still liquid (i.e. before it stiffens). I didn't make the coulis, but the cream is definitely 4 forks!!!

I am not a big fan of using gelatin, so to thicken the cream I whipped milk, eggs, and sugar together real well then cooked in a "double boiler" on med-high heat till a thick layer covers the back of a metal spoon when dipped in the mixture. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temp. Once cool add vanilla and mix will, gently fold in rest of recipe items. Make sure all are completely mixed. It takes a lot longer but trust me it is well worth the extra attention.

I can easily understand why the previous reviewer had a problem with the recipe. Instructions could be more thorough and it gets tricky. Be sure to fold the whipped cream into the gelatin mixture very gently but thoroughly to get a smooth consistency. This is one of those recipes where it would help to have photos to help with technique.

Wow... I'm a professional chef but this dish really embarassed me on Christmas! I remember making it with just this technique in culinary school, but I hadn't made it in 6 years, and this was a near-disaster. My family gobbled it up because we all love cream, but the gelatin collected at the bottom and was like a slime that tasted like tapioca. The top part (served in individual dishes) was totally runny. I swear I followed the directions, but something was really wrong. I haven't used a lot of gelatin in my experience, so is there some deadly mistake I didn't know about?

Tastes delicious. Mix cold and hot ingredients very, very slowly to avoid lumps. Made this for a Xmas party and used frozen berries for the topping.
