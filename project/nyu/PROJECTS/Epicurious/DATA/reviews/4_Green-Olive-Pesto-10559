Excellent!! Very addictive. Served it over gnocchi, and it was amazing.

absolutely delicious! i used sunflower seeds instead and simply minced the garlic and it turned out amazing. i will definitely be making this one again!

Made this as a spread. Guests raved. Then I took the leftovers and used it over pasta (thinning with extra olive oil). Family raved. No need to make a garlic paste. Just throw the garlic (without the salt -- this recipe does not need more salt!) into the processor and pulse. I added a lot of ground pepper also. Definitely a keeper!

Unlike many others, I *have* tried this over pasta and it comes up a little short. Then again, I usually find pesto to be disappointing since I really like my pasta saucy. But as a spread for bread, I find it to be a total home run! I have often secretly watched guests heap more and more on each piece of bread on each subsequent visit to the appetizer tray!

Great make ahead appetizer/snack. While it was slightly salty (what else would you expect from green olives?), my guests really enjoyed it. It was very easy to prepare and I would definitely make it again.

Everyone who's tried it LOVES this recipe and I always get requests to bring this spread to parties. I haven't tried it over pasta yet, but I'm sure it would be fabulous that way as well.

I love green olives and garlic, so I wasn't surprised I loved this recipe. But everyone who tried it in my office also wanted the recipe.

I have made this MANY times, but never yet served it over pasta - always as a spread. It's easy to make, and my guests and even my kids love it (unless they just don't care for olives). It is rather salty - but isn't that why we love green olives?
