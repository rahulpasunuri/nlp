Made this for a healthier thanksgiving dinner and all 17 guests loved it. we used frozen corn for the puree and fresh corn for the whole kernels. i definitely will keep it on the menu next year.

Like another reviewer, I have a partner who hates creamed vegetables. I made this and he flipped. It was actually kind of a problem as we both wanted to eat ALL of the leftovers! Incredible dish, a must-have throughout the summer.

I served this recipe to my boyfriend who hates anything creamed, and he loved it. This dish is a healthy alternative to the usual creamed corn, but you still get fresh-tasting, creamy, corny deliciousness. The prep is a little time consuming, but just tell yourself it's fun. Or make your boyfriend help you. : ) I loved this with a little bit of basil fresh from my garden instead of tarragon.

Amazing! I love corn and am always looking for new ways to eat it. The corn flavor really comes through and the tarragon adds a nice hint of freshness. I made this for a potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe and couldn't believe it was "creamless." I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious. I don't have a chinois, so I used our juicer to extract the corn milk, passing the corn through twice. This made the "milking" fairly painless.

I am a corn addict as is my sister's boyfriend and we both thought this dish was absolutely amazing. The best way to extract the corn "cream" is to use blend and use a chinois, piece of cake. also, we loved the added flavor of the taragon, which complemented but did not mask the sweet corn flavor

I'm not sure I'd make this again, but it was a wonderful tasting dish. The preparation is tedious. I'd recommend using cheese cloth instead of a sieve however. It made the filtering far easier.

This recipe was wonderful! The fresh corn flavor is sweet and simple. The creaminess is classic, without the weight of real cream. I've used the recipe for formal gatherings and will be using it for an outdoor picnic today! Try using fresh chives instead of the tarragon - delicious!

This turned out very nicely. I did a half batch with only 4 ears of corn. After processing I used a food sieve and I suggest doing that for quite a few minutes to get all the cream out of corn. My husband loved it, it reminded him of his grandmothers corn.Did not use tarragon, wanted only the corn taste!
