This is a wonderful cool weather or holiday salad. The balance of textures and flavors is lovely, it keeps well and looks pretty. I spooned the salad onto a bed of radicchio on a platter and it worked well. No one ate the lettuce but it made a nice presentation. Also left out the watercress and didn't miss it.

This is a really pretty salad just served in a crystal bowl. I used all granny smith apples the first time..thought it was too tart. Used half granny smith and half honey crisp the next time and liked it better. Good winter salad.

I have made this many times and will never make a Waldorf the "old way" again! However, when I'm in a hurry I use either regular mayo or Miracle Whip and less than half of what is suggested. Do not substitute the Granny Smith's-flavors won't be as good. The wonderful taste medley comes from the apples, radishes, red onion, pecans, and cranberries. To mess with these is bastardizing the recipe. I would not add the watercress except for color at the last minute. It gets soggy, looks nice, but is a very minor flavor value. More sophisticated palettes will love this. Those who like packaged pull apart rolls probably won't.

Asked to bring a fruit salad for a early autumn pot luck, this one caught my eye. I LOVED it! I omitted the watercress and, because this was a family style pot luck, rather then have the radicchio bowls, I shredded the radicchio and added it to the salad. I used honey crisp apples. Chop radishes and red onion finely by hand, a food processor does not yield the same results. I will definitely make this again for a fall salad dish.

Labor intensive, but absolutely delicious. To prevent apples from browning, chop celery, radishes, and onion; add dried cranberries, and stir ingredients together with a large spoonful of dressing. Chop first apple, add to mixture, and stir in a spoonful of dressing. Repeat for each apple. Refrigerate overnight for flavors to mellow. Before serving, stir in watercress leaves and toasted, chopped pecans. For a holiday buffet, omit radicchio cups and serve salad in a large bowl. Left-overs the next day taste even better (if that's possible).

This was great as a Thanksgiving dinner side dish. Since we wanted something a little sweet, we omitted the radishes and served it family-style so the radicchio was unnecessary. It was very pretty and a nice fresh accompaniment to the heavier dishes.

I love this recipe. Every time I make it everyone seems to enjoy.

This was very yummy and had a very different variety of flavors. I wouldn't recommend it for a crowd consisting of "simple palettes," but friends at a potluck thought it was fabulous. It was definitely better after the flavors had time to meld, about 6 hours.

Made this for Thanksgiving also. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The radicchio at the store was old and wilted and wanted 5.99/lb, so I substituted small red cabbage. A cheap alternative.

This is a lovely alternative for a holiday meal -- we served it on Thanksgiving after the soup course. Light, refreshing, wonderful texture. Everyone gobbled it up!

Served this at a brunch with freshly baked croissants, and a smoked salmon with cream cheese frittata. Very refreshing after the rich smokiness of the main course. Lovely combination of tastes, textures and colors.

Really, 3.5 forks. Easy, attractive, and goes over very well with the guests. I made it for 12 and it was such a timesaver. A nice update to the classic... the touches of red are good for the holidays, too.

Love this recipe, everyone at Thanksgiving loves it (and same at Easter too). I substituted minced shallots and used Golden Delicious apples and cut out the radishes as well. Used baby spinach instead of watercress and served in endives (when available). Presentation is beautiful with or without the individual cups from all the lovely colours.

This was very quick and easy and everytime I have made it there is never any leftover. The cranberries add a nice color and the pecans MUST be toasted. We will definitely make this again.

The radish adds a great surprise to this otherwise traditional dish

making the salad ahead of time certainly allow the flavors to meld. Followed the recipe for the most part. Served this as an appetizer, substituting endive for the radicchio

Yum! Brought this to a smoked turkey Thanksgiving feast, and the hostess asked for the recipe. It's wonderful with leftover turkey sandwiches! I used lite mayo, and 3 gala and 3 pink lady apples and gave 'em a healthy squirt of lemon juice. I skipped the radicchio and bought a bottle of wine instead. I'd definitely make this again.

This dish was great. I had a few substitutions though and it still came out great. I didn't have any radicchio so I put in red cabbage leaves. It did well. I didn't have any watercress and it still came out excellent. Keep adding lemon the apples after you cut them because they start turning brown. So quickly mix it in the lemon mayonnaise. Great recipe!!

This is very good but I would agree with one of the other reviewers that guys don't like this recipe. None of the men in my family will touch this!

WONDERFUL! Everyone loved it last Thanksgiving!

This is an excellent first course. I have made it several times. It seems like there are always one or two vegetarians at a dinner party, and this is a first course everyone can eat and enjoy. I served it before a beef daube. It was just right. Because I served tangerine carrots, green beans and mashed potatoes as well, the vegetarians had a very complete and satisfying meal as well.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and I loved it. Better than traditional Waldorf salad. Not a hit with the children or men at my table, though.

This has a refreshing flavor and the multiple ingredients all come together wonderfully. I halved the recipe but made full amount of dressing and used about 3/4 of it. Used dried cherries instead of cranberries and tossed the chopped apple in additional lemon juice so it wouldn't brown. Really nice Thanksgiving addition.

I just made this salad for an all girls' luncheon and it was fabulous. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! I will definitely make it again!

We just had this for a "Not-Luck" lunch. It was quite a hit, and many people said it was the best Waldorf salad they've ever had. We did not do the radicchio cups. Not really necessary as it already has wonderful color. Really, really yummy. I plan to make again, definitely.

I liked this salad so much I made it for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and emailed it to my sister for New Year's! It is tart and refreshing more than sweet. It's important to use red onions and to finely chop them. I used reduced fat mayo with no problem and will try mixing mayo with non-fat yogurt next time. The only drawback is that it requires a lot of chopping/prep time when you need to be preparing other dishes, The second time I made this, I toasted and chopped the pecans, measured the cranberries, and washed/picked the watercress leaves and put the individual ingredients into plastic bags a day ahead. This helped to cut down on "party day" prep time. Overall, a good, refreshing balance for heavy meals and the presentation is spectacular.

I made this salad for a Christmas Eve recipe and loved it. I think it's extremely important to mince the onion, chop the pecans very fine, and to dice the apple, celery, and radishes in quite small pieces of approximately the same size. I couldn't find watercress, so I substituted some mixed spring greens. Used light mayonnaise for health reasons, and thought the lemon did a nice job of brightening the taste. I cut the recipe by one-third for myself and my husband (plenty of leftovers), but used an entire recipe of dressing-- guess I like things creamy! Tart, folks, is the point of the Granny Smith apples and lemon dressing, but this should not be bitter unless you bought some strange species of hot radish or overwhelmed the salad with onion. To me, this was delicious, and I plan to make it year-round. My one caution would be that the mincing and dicing-- best done by hand-- are a bit time-consuming. But definitely worthwhile for a special-occasion salad.

This recipe is phenominal!!! The following cooks must be amateurs, because every ingredient, if used fresh, adds its own unique and delicious touch. Two suggestions to help the bitter complaints. First is to FINELY chop the red onion and raddishes. Second, I used Fuji apples and they were just sweet enough, and gave the salad a great texture.. I took this and the green beans with pecan, parsley,lemon to Thanksgiving at some friends and the hosts ended up keeping ALL the leftovers for THEMSELVES!!! Great Recipe!

Too tart. I doubt that I will make this recipe again. I would prefer it without the radishes and with less lemon. I made it for Thanksgiving for ten family members. One liked it, the rest of us left it on our plates.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was hardly dented. The taste was good but nothing special. An average salad.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. The presentation is great (i used red cabbage leaves instead of the raddichio)and everyone raved about the salad. I used Pink Lady apples which i think are the best multi-purpose apple. I wouldn't change a thing. You can just barely detect the onion with all the other flavors. It's really wonderful.

I made this for Thanksgiving and nobody ate it except me. It was beautiful and everyone complimented the presentation, but quietly played with the remainder after a few bites. I think that it was too bitter. I'd try a different salad scooped into radicchio cups in the future, but without the radishes and sweeten up the dressing.

I've made this dish for several occasions now and have received nothing but compliments. However - I served it with a few changes. Substitute the watercress for arugula. omit the onion. and I used Fuji and jonagolds. Works out great and is easy to prepare.
