Great dish, easy to prepare. We left out the tomatoes, and threw in garlic and Tuscan Kale for a more savory dish. No-knead bread to sop up the goods!

The carrot juice makes this too sweet for my taste, even though I added garlic. I prefer something more savory.

A change of pace from the more conventional mussel dishes, but not good enough to justify the extra effort and ingredients.

Ooops, I was a walking zombie at the grocery store... bought carrot coctail, after poring into the pot I realized this and saw that it listed banana juice as the second ingredient!!! - made it anyway, and my guests thought it turned out fantastic... and you know, it really was very good. Go figure?

Fabulous. Nice different twist for mussel lovers. I wouldn't change a thing.

Very quick, super easy, wonderful flavors! I added three or four cloves of garlic (minced) and doubled the ginger. Don't skimp on the lime juice or cilantro, they add a beautiful top note to the broth. Can't go wrong with this one.

Very simple and delicious. Added extra ginger and tomatoes, it added a bit mroe spice and thickness to the sauce. Carrot juice added sweetness, but not an overwhelming carrot flavor.

made this for a friend who is just learning to cook gluten-free (so we had to skip out on the crusty bread). I didn't even think about adding the sausage- and coconut milk (in very small amount) would add just the right amount of richness. we'll have to try it again!

This was a total coup. I followed the recipe but added in Thai sausage (linguica would also work well.) It felt like a coconut broth, because it was so rich, but it was lean and light unlike a coconut broth. Fantastic!

So yummy, quick, healthy and easy. Definitely follow the recipes recommendation and serve with crusty bread to sop up the sauce. I'm not a huge mussel fan, but this is fantastic. I could see serving the sauce with another form of mild seafood like halibut. I've made twice now once as written and one with green onions and extra ginger instead of cilantro (it didn't make it into my bag at the grocery store). Both ways were excellent. The more shallots and tomatoes you use, the more you have to scoop up with the bread.

This was so easy and so delicious! Used extra ginger and shallots. Will definitely be making this recipe again.
