Could not find brioche or a decent egg bread, but made this with bakery raisin bread and it was delicious. Do not omit the sauce, as it really ties the flavors together.

Well, I won a Christmas dessert bake-off at my company with this recipe. I was up against 25 other desserts, many of which were great. Everyone voted (about 100 people, many of whom are sophisticated foodies) and this won. Need I say more!

Very good w/following changes: reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, used equal amounts of 2% and half-half (could tilt toward less cream easily), touch more salt, baked 50 min (my oven runs hot). Rum sauce was tricky so need to cook slowly, it did seize up to microwaved and then added several tbsp of cream to make more of a rum caramel type sauce. Use good dark rum..added currents for interest and crushed pecans on topping.

Made this for the first time for a special occasion and everyone raved about it. Even particular realtives not know for trying new things. The fact that you can make ahead is a great time saver too.

I made this twice. The first time the sauce didn't come out right, then i did it again. I poured it over the pudding and let it stay overnight. My co-workers and family love this. I used Challa (sp) Bread though it soaks up all the Egg Mixture so well.

We loved this! It was the culmination of our Valentine's Dinner--DelMarVA Crab Cakes and a salad. To lighten it up a bit, I used 2 cups Half & Half and 1/2 cup skim milk, 4 lrg. eggs & 1/2 cup EggBeaters, 1 stick of margarine and 3/4 c. chocolate chips. And Challah bread. Since I didn't follow the exact recipe, I can't compare it, but it was still a rich and fabulous dessert. I doubt anyone would know there was substitutions. The next time I make it I'll try only 1 cup half and half and 1 1/2 cup 1% or skim milk. I also cut the sauce recipe in half. We prefer our sauces to complement, not drown out the main dish. The sauce would be fabulous over vanilla or butter pecan ice cream!

SO GOOD. Moist, delicious, and easier than other bread puddings I've made. The sauce is to die for. The recipe was just the right amount for a dinner party of 8. Everyone asked for the recipe.

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes and it's so easy. I make it in the morning or the night before, and then stick it in the oven at the beginning of dinner. As others noted, the chocolate chips do sink to the bottom, so I mix it a little right before sticking it in the oven and I sprinkle a few extra chocolate chips on top.

This is my go-to dessert recipe. It tastes great and is super easy to make. Definitely make the sauce to go with it as it's possibly the best part. I use challah and it works great.

Wonderful and yummy treat! I cut the 1/2 & 1/2 with milk half 1% milk and half the cream. I would like to find a way to cut some more calories with the butter too, but wow is this a delicious recipe. The cinnamon rum sauce is great but you can also use Brandy.

Rating: 3
Awesome results for such an easy recipe! I only had one (very minor) problem... all my chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the baking pan. Still, it was utterly delicious and I can't exactly say that finding pockets of molten chocolate chips towards the bottom of my serving wasn't pleasant. I'll definitely be making this one again when I'm entertaining.

Fantastic! I made the golden brioche recipe on this site, but rolled w frozen raspberries & macadamias. The next day I needed to make a birthday worthy desert in a hurry, took 3 minutes! Used 1/2 of both recipes, white choc chips (3 eggs, 1 yolk, 1/2 cream and milk) and served it w vanilla bean ice cream and clotted cream. Guests thought a sauce wld be too much. Good to do ahead

Wonderfully delicious! I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips. Just as good the next day at room temperature; just reheated sauce.

Like others, this is my go-to, fail-safe dessert that I serve to company and at my family's Thanksgiving dinner. It takes little time to put together, and I make it the night before and pop it in the oven before I serve dinner. Whatever you do, do NOT skip the Cinnamon-Rum sauce - it is divine and makes this dessert spectacular. I serve this with vanilla bean ice cream and it always receives rave reviews!

Gone in a very short time. Enjoyed by most without the cinnamon-rum sauce, but I feel the sauce is worth making. Cut the butter in 1/2 for the sauce & used smaller chunks of french bread for the pudding. Threw some streusel over top of pudding that I had left in the freezer from another dessert.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I used a simple french bread loaf which I think gave it a nice, firm texture. Also reduced the butter a bit for the pudding itself. My guests were raving.

Rating: 4
I increased the amount of bread (I used challah) as suggested by others, to about 1.5 pounds. It came out too bready for my taste though delicious nonetheless. I'll try it as written next time. The sugar in the rum sauce refused to dissolve even though I cooked and whisked it forever, so I added the rum and vanilla, transferred the sauce to a large glass measuring cup and zapped it in the microwave for 15 seconds or so. Problem solved. The sauce elevates the dessert from very good to outstanding.

Rating: 4
This is my go-to company dessert; it's easy, you can prepare it ahead of time, and it smells INCREDIBLE when it's cooking. I always make it as written, with one exception; I use a grocery store loaf of French bread. It's way cheaper, and I liked it better that way than with the brioche. The sauce is what makes it, though. I could eat it plain. I've probably made this dessert more than any other.

OMG, this was a huge hit w/the whole family. Would make it again & again.

I will join all others in raving about this recipe. However, I did use 1 C of whole milk, replacing 1 C of the half and half. (Just made me feel a little better) and I completely left out the 1 C. sugar (by accident!). With all of the semi sweet chocolate chips and that incredible sauce, who needs the sugar at all?! It was divine the way I served it and can't imagine how sweet it would be with sugar throughout. I was generous with the brown sugar on the top which gave it sweetness and a lovely crustiness. My women's book group raved about it! I will not change a thing next time I make it. Fabulously easy, inexpensive, rich and delicious. And by all means, keep the sauce just like it is...incredibly rich and rummy and perfect for this pudding.

Amazing! I did it a day ahead for Christmas Eve and put it in the oven before serving dinner. It came out puffed and perfectly golden. I served it with the sauce, which I made with cognac instead of rum. I also cut the butter in the sauce by half a stick, and substituted 2% for some of the cream. It didn't need to be any richer, believe me. My guests were totally delighted--every bite was divine. A new tradition for me I think.

I make this almost every time I offer to bring dessert and everyone who's ever tasted it loves it (Even my very picky 12-year old brother). The best part is that it's so easy! It's especially delicious with a bit of almond extract.

Great recipe! I've been searching a long time for a good bread pudding recipe - and, at last, I've found it. The only thing I did differently was to use three different types of bread - french bread, sweet Hawaiian bread, and little croissants. Fantastic!

Killer recipe! My mom HATES bread pudding, but likes this. And the Rum sauce really makes a difference. I usually make my puddings in smaller, individual ramikins, cut open the top and pour in the rum sauce. YUMMMMMM!

YUMMY!!!!!!! Absolutely fabulous! Served it at a dinner party and people were fighting over bringing leftovers home. made the sauce too & it was divine. Here's what I did that was different from recipe: Used 1 1/2 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 cup whole milk, used 1 1/2 cups chocolate, skipped the drizzle of 2 tbs butter and 2 tbs brown sugar (because I forgot) still came out great! Assembled pudding and made sauce before company came over and then popped it in the oven when we sat down to dinner. If I were to make it again, I might try adding more milk and less eggs. The bottom of the pan was more egg-y than the rest. 4 forks!!

I've made this dessert several times now, and it's always a huge hit. Everyone goes for seconds- no matter how full they are. I usually leave the bread soaking overnight- it absorbs all the flavors, and it's one less thing the day of. The last time I made it, I did not drizzle butter on top- the top got a little crispy, giving it great texture.

Delicious! The make-ahead factor is really handy. It lends itself well to alterations. I was making tiramisu while I was making the bread pudding, and I ended up adding some tirimisu filling (with heavy cream, eggs, mascarpone...) and it just added to the richness. The sauce, though a little too sweet, was very good. We had it for breakfast one lovely day and dessert the next.

OMG! This bread pudding was to die for. However, definitely not for those counting their calories. I will save it for a special occasion treat or for company so that there are no leftovers to tempt me. I did not have a problem with my sauce being too runny as a previous reviewer did but I did think it a bit too "rummy". Next time I will either cook it a bit after adding the rum to "burn off" some of the alcohol or I will try adding less rum.

i made this for a potluck and it was absolutely devoured! i felt sorry for the chocolate cake that was sitting next to my bread pudding that was left untouched. i made it as written, with challah bread. i forgot to drizzle the remaining butter and brown sugar on top, but no one missed it! i'll try some low (er) fat variations next time.

A great and easy recipe. Used only one egg yolk (ran out of eggs) and it came out fine. Prep is easy. Sauce is a little thin... perhaps it would be nice a bit thicker, but it is great flavor-wise.

Excellent - A little strong Rum taste for us non-drinkers though. Next time I'll just cut back on the Rum but other than that, this is a real keeper and it will be made again! The bread pudding itself is moist and just has a great subtle chocolate taste...perfect!

I meant to cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup, but I forgot! Fortunately, it really wasn't too sweet. I replaced one of the sticks of butter in the sauce with 1/2+1/2 to cut back on unnecessary fat but maintain the quantity. I split the recipe into two parts and took one half to a girl's night and sent the other half with my boyfriend to a dinner with his extended family. Everybody loved it! The girls devoured it, and boyfriend said that his relatives are dying to meet me now (When meeting family, it's always good to send a baked good in first!). I will make this next week to take to Thanksgiving dinner. An awesome, easy, delicious dessert that isn't too snooty!

Way yummy. Cut down a lot on the amount of butter (by half) and added 1/2 a cup less sugar to the bread pudding. Only used 1 stick of butter in the sauce and followed the rest of the recipe. Was fabulous--I'm not fat phobic but the recipe just didn't need the extra butter. Cutting down on the sugar in the pudding allowed the cnnamon-rum sauce to add a very distinct flavorfull addition without making it sickeningly sweet. My dinner guests were delighted with it.

Little Fountain Cafe is my FAVORITE restaurant in DC and this is my FAVORITE dessert there! Looking back at all those times I've been disappointed at the end of the meal when Lauren (the pastry chef who is also a waitress) says that they've run out of the bread pudding, I'm relieved to know that I can now make it at home! What a great, easy recipe!

This is a fabulous way to use up extra brioche! We halved both the pudding and the sauce (used an 8x8 pan for the pudding, which worked fine), but found that the sauce was really unnecessary. It's tasty, but the pudding is plenty sweet on its own, especially with the butter/sugar crust. If you want to use the sauce, I'd cut back on the sugar in the bread pudding and leave off the topping. Great otherwise, though!

A wonderful do ahead, comfort food desert ... perfect for a cold, winter night. This desert is so simple and so heartwarming. Don't skimp on the calories, the butter and the cream are what make it so good. And for heavens sake, don't skip the sauce -- it's to die for! I can't wait to try the left over sauce on ice cream!

Great Recipe! Thanks for the reviews, I substituted 16oz of French Bread w/crust for the brioche, plus dried out the bread for 1 day before assembling and chilled whole dish for one day in frig. Dinner guests begged for the leftovers! I doubled the brown sugar to sprinkle on top which made a great crunchy crust.

CUT OUT LOTS OF CHUBBYNESS & NONE OF THE FLAVOR!!! I always get tons of complements and plates so clean I can almost put them away without washing them. I replace all the 1/2 & 1/2 with fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and all the eggs with "eggbeaters" or similar product, and cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup. AWESOME! When my husband saw what I was doing the first time I did this he told me I had just ruined the recipe. Yet he couldn't believe how it still tasted the same, and begs me to make it. . . Also cut one stick of butter out of sauce recipe, and at least half the rum(so rum would not be overpowering, and you would be able to taste the cinn. and butter.) Excellent.

I prepared this recipe using cinnamon bread, rather than brioche.It complements the cinnamon in the sauce. I also tore the bread into pieces and combined all the ingredients in a large bowl) (except the butter and sugar topping) and allowed the bread to absorb the flavours for 30 minutes. This technique improves texture as well. I always cover my puddings with foil for 3/4s of the baking time and then finish them uncovered. The appearance is much better and there are no dry spots. This pudding is sweet and a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream is a must!Leftovers freeze nicely and are a good snack warmed in the microwave. Be sure to cover with plastic wrap when reheating to retain moisture.
