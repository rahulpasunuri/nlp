I started out by tossing the cauliflower in a bag with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then I baked it at 400 in a single layer on a cookie sheet for 15 mins. I turned the pieces over and baked 10 more minutes. I made the sauce, which was way too thick before adding the cheese so I thinned it with milk. I added a blend of sharp and mild cheddar and found the sauce bland so added more cheese. I put the cauliflower in a single layer in a casserole dish, poured cheese over top and sprinkled lightly with bread crumbs. The casserole browned nicely but I found the sauce pasty and not very flavorful. Probably won't make this again.

Yummy. A comfort-food treat -- we dipped our Irish Soda Bread in the cheese sauce on our plates. I think you could easily swap macaroni for the cauliflower and it would be a great macaroni & cheese dish too.

I loved this recipe. I did not steam the cauliflower. Instead I tossed it in a bit of olive oil and roasted the cauliflower for about 30 minutes and then poured the cheese sauce over the cauliflower topped it with more cheese and let it roast another 30 minutes. I also charged up the sauce with a bit of asiago and a dash of hot sauce. Will make it again and it is good enough for dinner parties.

This recipe turned out beautifully. It's easy and tastes great! I have made this as a side for dinner with my family as well as for a St. Patrick's Day party with many guests. It's a big favorite all around. Give it a try!

I freely substituted on this recipe: 1. I added mini, peeled carrots, cuz my 3-yr old daughter digs 'em 2. I used olive oil, instead of butter (same amount) 3. I used 2% milk, rather than whole. 4. I used 10.5 oz of goat cheese in the cheese sauce, rather than cheddar 5. I added rubbed sage ('bout a tsp.), turmeric ('bout .25 tsp.) and nutmeg ('bout .25 tsp) to the cheese sauce 6. I sprinkled about .5 cup pecorino Romano on top 7. I put the carrots and cauliflower in cold water to stop them cooking before separating them from the stem 8. Rather than bake for 30 minutesat 375, I baked it at 375 for 15 minutes and then broiled it for 5 minutes on high. Result: DELICIOUS! If you like goat cheese, you'll like this. It wasn't bland at all, the texture of the carrots and cauliflower were great, and the Romano turned very nicely golden under the broiler.

I made alterations as a natural chef would.... I used olive oil in replace of the butter and 2%milk instead of the whole milk, and also 1/2c of Parmesan cheese divided in two for the for the sauce and the other half for the topping .Then added frozen celery leaves and stems from my garden this year with the cauliflower. Baked as usual. It was delightful :)

Most of the negative reviews of this delicious dish are from the same person. Why do people do this?And why doesn't the website remove the repetitive reviews? I find this on many recipes, dozens of reviews by the same person.

Recipe is nothing special. I wonder where the "roasting" of the vegetable occurs? I separated the head first and then gently steamed. Next time I'd put the flowerets, UNCOOKED into the 9X12 directly and just bake w/the sauce. To sauce I added Coleman's mustard. Then topped casserole w/smoked Spanish Paprika. Used top grade xtra sharp cheddar- doubled the salt. Still bland on taste. More tweaking needed!

Loved this! Had half a head of cauliflower I wanted to cook, and found this. My sweetie and I ate it all! Only changes: I use 1% milk, and on top I sprinkled a dash of cayenne & some Spanish paprika.

Kid friendly flavor, like Mac n cheese. Next time I will try adding the dried mustard for a little more oomph.

It's faster to steam the cauliflower if you break it into florets before steaming. I often make a similar recipe that is lower in fat: oil instead of butter and 2% fresh or evaporated milk.

I discovered cauliflower cheese after we've moved to England from San Francisco. The family absolutely love this & I make it with all roast dinners. His recipe is authentic, although I also add the coleman's dry mustard to the cheese sauce as did another reviewer.

This was easy and good, but nothing special. My son who will eat almost anything didn't like it; the other 2, who are a bit pickier, thought it was OK. My husband and I liked it, but I probably won't make it again.

I added about 1/4 tsp of Coleman's dry mustard to the sauce to up the cheese flavor. No one notices the mustard flavor, but boy, is it GOOD!
