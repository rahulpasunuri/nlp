I agree with Lollygagan... About Suzies statement... I have eaten in a few.4 star steak houses and that picture of the porterhouse steak is exactly the way it is presented at all of the best steak houses !!! Anyway, as for the recipe itself...it was amazing . Will definitely make this for my next dinner party !!!

This was delicious. I made it as recipe calls for but may try adding mushrooms as suggested by another member next time.

This was a very quick and easy-to-prepare main dish that was a hit. I added thinly sliced crimini mushrooms to the jus which gave a bit more depth to the flavor and will likely keep that modification to the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic, although I made it with a Rib Eye because I have trouble finding a good Porterhouse. The steak was very tender and flavorful, and pouring the reduction over it made for a beautiful presentation. I will most definitely be making it again.

It would be nice, Suzie, if you could use the same etiquette here that you no doubt encourage around the family dinner table. This is not a Yahoo opinion board, overrun by juvenile mentalities.
