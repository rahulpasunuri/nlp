This was great! Didn't have the cilantro on hand and it was good without it. Cooked the corn before guests arrived and then finished it in skillet right before serving. Made extra; cut it off the cob and tossed it in a salad.

I really liked this. It was easy and a nice way to jazz up corn on the cob. On the one hand, I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out that butter and salt really can't be beat but when paired with barbequed chicken and some red rice, it was nice to have something with a little zing to put on the plate. I might reduce the lime juice just a touch but overall this was a winner and I will make it again. It's very pretty on a platter and would make a great company side dish.

I brought this dish to a potluck barbeque at the home of a prominent Atlanta restaurant critic. Talk about pressure! Well, he raved about it -- bringing it up in conversation several times after having it. It's fabulous! I'm excited to see recommendations to use frozen corn, so that I can enjoy it now while looking at the snow outside.

We bought some way too early corn. I cut the leftovers off the cob and added everything but the cilantro to a preheated cast iron skillet and put the whole thing on the grill. Great smokey flavor! Will make this over and over!

This is one of my wife's favorites. She has me make it over and over. The corn comes out wonderful. I will definitely make this again. In fact, now I think I will make it for dinner tonight!

I wanted a way to use left-over, already cooked corn on the cob. I cut it off the cob and heated it with the sauce, then mixed in chopped cilantro (lots!) and sprinkled with a little more Parmesan. Very nice!

Corn without butter? Huh. But believe me, this is delicious. Try serving it with mexican food .. it's a great alternative to rice and beans. Next time I'll try throwing these on the grill.

Good, but not better than the classic butter and salted corn-on-the-cob. This recipe just called for too much oil which mixed with 1/3 cup of parm just over powered the natural delicious flavor of sweet corn.

I was in a hurry and needed to make a dish for a "Pot Luck" Meal. I used canned, whole kennel corn and the same recipe. It was a big hit!!!

I found that the flavor over-powered the locally grown corn I was looking forward to enjoying.

Not bad, but for both flavor and ease of preparation, I'd rather just do boiled corn with butter, salt 'n' pepper.

I thought this recipe sounded intriguing and gave it a try. But after making it, my dining partner and I both agreed..... why bother? The corn is so good by itself that the sauce is just a distraction.

This recipe came with a wonderful surprising discovery! I took the remaining Parmesan cheese mixture (uncooked), and put it on a small plate. By adding a bit more olive oil on the plate, I sprinkled on some chopped cilantro and lightly mixed, it turned into the most awesome dip for the warm, crusty french bread I've had. Absolutely outstanding, and the guests said it was better than any they'd had at Italian Restaurants!

My daughters made this, one who does not really like corn on the cob. They loved it, and have made it twice.
