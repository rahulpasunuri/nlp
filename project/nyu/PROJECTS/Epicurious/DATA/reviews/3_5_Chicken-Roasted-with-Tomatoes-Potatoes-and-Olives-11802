I love this recipe and make it often. I find the portion size a bit large so I use the leftovers in "Chicken, Potato, and Green Bean Salad" (on this site -Gourmet Oct '95) makes another flavorful, light, meal for two. They are a perfect match!

I used halibut cheeks instead of chicken, so they just cooked nicely but did not brown (not a problem). Seemed like too much garlic, so I made the marinade/basting mixture with 3 large cloves and used it for all the ingredients. Because of using fish, I precooked the potatoes a bit, but would probably slice them next time. Very nice one-dish meal.

This came out very good. I followed the recipe closely, just used Roma tomatoes instead of plum and quartered them; cut the potatoes a little smaller than suggested. Everything had a nice hint of lemon with good flavor from the garlic and olives -- not sure if the rosemary really adds anything. Chicken skin came out well browned and crispy for me using the suggested 9 by 13 inch shallow baking dish.

Overall a good recipe, but it needs some tweaking - less lemon juice, more olive oil for potatoes & a sheet pan would be a better choice than a baking dish. Took advice on cutting potatoes smaller. Chicken was done perfectly, but needed a bit more time in the oven - a good meat thermometer does wonders!

The chicken came out dry and rather tasteless. However, the potatoes were amazing! I will make this again, but as a potato side-dish and just not bother with the chicken.

Delicious and easy to make. I didn't have a lemon so I substituted an orange, the results were pretty fabulous. After reading some reviews that said the vegetables needed to cook longer than the chicken, I thick sliced the potatoes instead of quartering them and they were done at the same time.

Not quite three forks, but close enough. This dish has lots of promise. We thought that the flavors were right and they went well together. But next time we will try roasting the potatoes, tomatoes, garlic and olives separately for about 15 minutes before putting them on the chicken and roasting it all together. The veggies seemed to need a bit more time in the oven for the flavors to really come together.

I make this often for company. Changes: Use large roasting pan, omitting the potatoes for more room for chicken, (I do sliced potatoes with kosher salt, butter and rosemary as a side instead), one chicken breast for 3-4 people. Bone-in chicken, remove skin for some of the pieces. I sometime remove rinds from lemons in order to avoid bitterness when cooking until veggies are fully carmelized; you MUST remove lemons if reheating later. Prep during the day, throw into oven before dinner party, and the whole house smells of rosemary as guests arrive. I always get rave reviews!

Well--as I was eating dinner & thinking of what I'd do better next, hubby said, "Don't need to do this one again." The components were there. Just didn't come together for us. The chicken was tough. Used bone-in. The skin never got crispy. So why have skin? The vegeies were more steamed than roasted. Next time I would use a larger pan so they could stretch out. Make again? Nah! Too many good recipies out there to try to perfect this one.

Excellent, chicken came out very moist. Very easy, too, once you cut everything up, just put it in the oven and forget it. (I didn't do the second basting and it still came out great.)

I love this recipe not only because its delicious, but its so easy. A great one for company at a vacation home, when you don't want to be stuck in the kitchen. Put everything in the pan, stick it in the oven, and an hour later you have a complete meal!

Very tasty. Of course I had to go and rewrite the recipe! I skipped the potatoes and used morel mushrooms. I also added white wine and then served over saffron rice. Yum! Will definitely repeat... Oh, I should also mention that I cut back on the lemons. Next time, I think I'll try marinating the chicken in lemon and olive oil and then exclude the lemons slices from the recipe.

I made this with skinless, boneless breasts. The meat came out very tender, but the dish was too sour -- the lemon and the olives overpowered everything.

This dish is fantastic for two! I think that the key is to roast the chicken in the veggies until the chicken is done (skin really crispy and golden which is a bit longer than cooking time recommends). Then, remove the chicken, remove all the cut lemons and roast the veggies for an extra 10 minutes on a little higher heat... It will really make the veggies delicious and cut down on the 'bitter' taste... Don't forget that the two teaspoons of lemon juice MUST be fresh - not the plastic squeezie or it will be too strong! Fabulous!!!

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe, but something it came out with a bitter taste. I used only fresh ingrediants so I don't think that was the problem, but you never know. I will try it again, because the chicken turned out very juicy and flavorful (which is a lot to ask from these poor, deboned chicken breasts.) I will be careful with my lemon purchase next time.

This recipe is lovely. It's easy to make and doesn't require too much prep time. The end result is very satisfying. I will definitely add this recipe to my regular rotation. I'm a cook who doesn't usually enjoy the fruits of my own efforts -- but I was oohing and ahhing over this dish along with my husband. It does take quite a bit more cooking time than the recipe suggests, but is well worth it.

This is such an easy recipe, and tastes great. I make it just like the recipe says (maybe more olives, though) but it makes a pretty huge dinner for two people. I either add a 3rd breast half to make 3 meals, or I split one half if they are large.

I thought this was good and easy to make. The olives are a nice touch. I did not have cloves of garlic so I used chopped garlic from a bottle and it turned out fine and I didn't have to worry about burned garlic cloves. I found that I had to cook it longer than stated in the recipe - a total of 40 minutes to ensure the chicken and potatoes were cooked thoroughly.

I have made this many times and it is always delicious. True, the garlic does burn a bit, but I think it gives the dish a nutty taste versus a bitter one. I use cherry tomatoes in the winter months and brine-cured black olives are a must (not those horrid canned ones).

Served this to friends who asked for the recipe. How nice to be able to just print a copy. My only change, was to skin the chicken breasts.

This is so easy and wonderful. My potatoes didn't cool as quickly as expected so perhaps they should be in smaller pieces. I also used cherry toms. We loved it! Also great to make ahead and reheat.

This recipe rocks! I have made it several times -- you can assemble it in advance and it looks really pretty coming straight to the table. It also marinates a bit that way. I make it with a whole chicken cut up so I can have leftovers cold the next day for a Mediterranean Chicken salad. I also skin the chicken first, the marinade keeps it plenty moist.

I made this last night and very much enjoyed it. I added more whole cloves to the potato/tomatoe mix - very good

We liked the combination of tomatoes, olives, and chicken. We didn't think it was as flavorful as other chicken dishes we've made. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, but doubt that it would have altered the flavor that much. Also, garlic burns easily and was surprised it was added early and cooked at such a high heat.

Delicious & easy to make. Used chicken thighs which are juicier.

We found this dish very easy to use substitutes. We oiled the pan with garlic flavored cooking spray, and used dried parsley instead of rosemary. We also have quite a few mouths to feed, so we used chicken legs (8 of them) instead of the breasts. We placed the dish on white steamed rice.

Have made this recipe many times and we have always loved it. Great as a easy company dish.
