i have never thrown away a dessert that i have baked but this is a first! i must say that the crust was so disappointing and cracked and the filling was horrid that being said, it took so long to cook and was tasteless.....so all the ingredients and time and effort went down the drain onwards to making a delicious dessert from my own recipes (and i love bon appetit); perhaps they should be checked more than once before being printed in the magazine

the filling is lovely, the hazelnut taste really shines through, but i agree, very sweet. However, the bake times are wrong! The crust awful. Horrible results if you follow the instructions as written....had to toss first crust and try again, still with just "ok" results...not a keeper, better options out there

This recipe was too sweet to my liking, with nothing to break it down (ie cranberries, citrus, etc). I would not make it again.

I modified this recipe somewhat to fit a 7-inch tart pan (made 2/3 recipe), and found I had enough dough, but like the other reviewer, I felt it was too much like a sugar cookie dough and not a real pate sucre. The baking times were, indeed, way off (my crust was set in about 15 minutes), and watch out roasting those nuts! 325 is a much more suitable temperature than 350, and the pine nuts roast in just a few minutes, like the pistachios. These issues aside, the filling was fantastic; the brown butter really adds a depth, and if you can find salted pistachios, I'd recommend using them as the salt adds a nice balance to the sweet filling.

The filling for this tart is amazing - complex and very elegant - but the crust recipe is wrong, wrong, WRONG. The recipe lists half the ingredients and twice the baking time you need, and what you get is a large, tart-shaped cookie recipe. I threw mine out and made a new crust (http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/the-great-unshrinkable-sweet-tart-shell/), with excellent results.
