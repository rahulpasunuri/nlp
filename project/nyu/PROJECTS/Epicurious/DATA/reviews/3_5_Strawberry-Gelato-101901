Whole moly! This recipe is dairy free, corn free, gluten free, soy free and GOOD! I was a bit worried not being well versed in using an ice cream machine and when the concoction was really sweet but I wait and as the machine did its work a fantastic creation was made. Ooh leave some strawberry pieces so good.

Very good strawberry flavor. I used frozen strawberries and the juice of one meyer lemon. It is wonderful!

Loved the flavor. Did not like the seeds. Would definitely strain the strawberry puree the next time

Beautiful Summer Refresher! Surprisingly easy, inexpensive and a perfect spring board for variations. I ammended the recipe as follows: 1 cup minus 1 tbsp of Raw granulated sugar mixed in blender. As it began to "kick off" dust, I added: 1 egg white then added in : 1-2 tbsps. key lime juice 1 pint frozen berries (organic "three berries" from Cascadian Farms: Raspberries, Blueberries, Marion berries) 1 cup bottled water frozen to a slush Blended. as the mixture finished to a uniform consistency, added 1 egg yolk and blended in. Product was slightlly thicker than shake consistency (could be eaten at this point) Placed in covered container and frozen to desired consistency, Deeply colored, richly flavored frozen desert. Berries add texture. Another frozen fruit, other than a berry, would give a smoother feel. The key is frozen fruit and cold or slushy water...to avoid an ice cream maker

This recipe was horrible. The mixture became frothy in the ice cream maker. I'm not sure if the egg white is necessary.

Made this as a dessert for a meal I cooked to welcome my parents back from a weekend away in Donegal. Delicious, although the strawberries I purchased were of poor quality, and made the gelato a little too sweet for my tastes. Took the tip of serving with whipped cream: worked perfectly, a delicious accompaniment. I didn't have an ice-cream maker, so I just whipped it till foamy and froze it: turned out perfectly! The expression of delight on my Dad's face made it all so worthwhile.

This is a nice lite refreshing dessert to have after a dinner party. I topped the strawberry gelato off with whipped cream and butter cookies which added a nice touch to this sweet/tart dessert. Very easy to make, we will enjoy it again real soon!
