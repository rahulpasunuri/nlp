Be careful adding lime to your own taste. I was overzealous and added a lime and a half of juice straight away because of the earlier reviews...and the soup ended up being way more sour than I imagined. Had to doctor it with salt, sugar, and boullion. Now it's just so-so.

yum! easy and quick soup with thai flavors i simmered it longer to let the flavors meld and added white fish and served over rice for a hearty winter meal. also used light coconut milk for a healthier option.

Excellent recipe! Adjusted the ingredients to suit my taste, but this was very good!

Sublime. I used kabocha squash and, after tasting the nearly-finished soup, followed advice of others here and added more fish sauce as well as lime juice and hot sauce. The soup sat for 90 minutes while I prepared the rest of the meal and it was superb: complex, mellow, exciting. A great, great, great soup--and so easy.

Caramelized an onion instead of the shallot, used one can each of coconut milk, pumpkin, and broth, added 1T extra fish sauce, 4T lime juice, and about a teaspoon of chile paste. It was really good, and a great concept given my relatively bare fridge when I decided to make this. 4 forks as amended. Different and a very satisfying entree soup.

This soup is sooooo bland....had to add much to make it edible. Perfect for the palate that enjoys baby food. You can salvage this with red curry, lime and brown sugar.

Delicious. Took the advice of others and added some lime juice, it was still a bit bland at the end, so I also added about a tablespoon of ground red pepper which made it just right!

Super good, and so easy to make. I used Thai basil and a stick of lemongrass instead of cilantro, doubled the fish sauce, added juice of 2 limes, and used butternut squash. I also threw in a cubed cod filet and some rice noodles. Delicious!

Tasty, but too salty, even with low sodium broth. If I made it again, I'd probably increase the coconut milk as well.

Good use of fresh ingredients, but didn't love. Very bland til added fish sauce, but then almost overpowered it. Added lime juice and a bit of chilis to zing it a bit. Tasty, but wish I had not doubled.... Son sprinkled with parmesan cheese which actually added depth of flavor!

I've been making a solid version of this soup for several years, inspired by the recipe Butternut Squash and Noodles with Coconut, Lime and Cilantro Sauce on this site. It's basically this recipe's seasonings on a spaghetti squash base. One of my staples. I was craving soup tonight and I had a turbana squash in the cupboard, so I decided to give this a try. Well, the ingredients are in the pot, not even warm, and i'm dipping out spoonfuls already. Definitely add lemon/lime juice. And sugar if you're subbing butternut sqaush for pumpkin.

Forgot to mention the dried red pepper(hot) that I added. Would have tasted a little bland without it.

Enjoyed this very much but had to make some substitutions. I only had one shallot, so I added an onion and a leek to the grilling process. The can of coconut milk was only 14 oz so I added more chicken stock. The other difference was that i had already roasted the pumpkin, but it still needed to be cooked further in the soup. Because my chunks were larger than suggested, the simmering took longer. I wanted the flavors to blend completely so I pureed the soup with an immersion blender. I garnished the finished soup with fresh green onion, cilantro and caramelized onions. Yum!

this was delicious, with the addition of extra fish sauce and lime, wish I'd had two limes. I pureed it, as I started with cooked pumpkin, and think it might also be good with the chunks of pumpkin.

This soup came out surprisingly delicious for so few ingredients. I followed the recipe almost exactly but I used 4 Tbsp of fish sauce,3 limes juiced, and pureed it. The end result was a bit too thin so I boiled some more pumpkin and added it. Served it with a side of quinoa and chopped cilantro on top. Very similar taste profile to Tom Kha soup. Will definitely make again. The addition of the lime juice is a must!

This recipe is missing one key ingredient -- lime juice. Squeeze a full lime on it and it makes a world of difference. Also I used 6 TBSP of fish sauce... 4 forks with adjustments.

Love this soup but did read through the reviews and made the following changes: --- Made this a day ahead but it sure tasted just as good the 1st day! --- Froze a batch and it tasted fine when thawed! --- It's worth the extra trouble to use fresh vs canned. --- Lite version of canned coconut milk is fine. --- Doubled the recipe to serve 10 people small 2/3 Cup servings ( below quantities are for single recipe ) --- Used 6 cups of cubed butternut & the shallots peeled tossed with 2 Tbsp oil & roasted at 350 until done, about 40 - 50 minutes --- Needed to add about 2 Cups extra chicken broth to avoid being too thick --- Added 1 large or 2 small Kefir Lime leaves ( remember to remove these before blending ) --- 1/2 tsp Garlic Chili paste --- 2 tsp sliced lemon grass ( Roland brand has this in a jar - so much easier ) --- In place of fresh cilantro used 2 tsp Coriander Chutney ( Brand is SWAD & it has some heat so bear this in mind if also adding Chili Paste) --- Chose to use blender to puree & then strained so extra silky ( the straining step I would likely omit unless it is another fancy Thanksgiving or dinner party situation ) --- For presentation I reserved a few oz. of the coconut milk, squirted a decorative spiral atop soup in each bowl & swirled pattern with a toothpick

I loved it! It was so easy, which was nice. I did add a few bird peppers because I prefer most of my food to be spicy. And I left out the salt because I like my food less salty and I figured I could always add more fish sauce if necessary. So good!

I agree this is only part of the recipe. After adding lemongrass, Thai chilis, and a tablespoon of brown sugar and soy sauce, and pureeing my soup, it was truly lush and delicious, with that lively South East Asian taste. Just like what I had at the best restaurants there. Am making again today.

This is only half the recipe for a real Southeast Asian pumpkin-coconut soup, so it is terribly bland prepared as is. After I tasted it, I pulled out my real Thai cookbook and added 2 kaffir lime leaves, some thin soy sauce (this is a type of Chinese soy), 2 chunks of rock sugar (you could also use 2 tbsp. palm sugar or brown sugar), and some hot chile flakes. The soup came alive! The Thai recipe calls for Thai basil instead of cilantro. I'll try that next time. And the Asian recipe uses kabocha squash instead of pumpkin.

OK, I blew it. This is not a review of this soup at all. But let me say if I served it as soup I would add a bit of asian red chili peppers or something like that. I started to make this but being ADD I put way too much chicken stock into it. So I sauteed some onion, added rice and added my failed soup and some hot sauce as the liquid. Really, really great. Served it with quickly sauteed rare tuna. I will make another attempt that this soup. Loved it.

I give 4 forks AFTER my slight alterations..though sacrilege to some, I used canned pumpkin, 1 can of coconut milk, green onions b/c didn't have leeks (though would have preferred them), and a touch of HONEY! The fish sauce and touch (maybe 1.5 Tbsp) add complexity of flavor. Undetectable, but delicious.

A keeper. I used kabocha (Japanese pumpkin), didn't bother peeling, and pureed the whole thing in the end. The fish sauce is key. Incredibly easy and delicious - has enter the "make again" repertoire!

I thought this recipe, was fantastic. I only did a couple things differently, based on some of the comments I read...and because I had a bit more time and wanted to play around a bit. So, like "A Cook from Far Hills" I did cut the fresh pumpkin I had into quarters and roast for about 25 min. at 200C/400F. I also pureed the soup at the end because I wanted a more smooth consistency rather than a chunky, brothy one. But I think it would taste great either way. In my opinion the keys to this recipe and therefore not to be rushed or substituted are: the fish sauce, the dry roasting of the shallots as a first step and the coriander. I served with a simple little oil and vinegar "feldsalat" with a dollop of creamy goat cheese. My husband and I both loved it and will definitely make it again...perhaps for our vegetarian friends :)

Rating: 4
Well my forks say it all! This is a great base soup. I made two batches one as the recipe called for. I had a large pumpkin that escaped carving and wanted to use it up. To save time and effort I cut it in quarters and baked it for about an hour then cooled it. I cubed it and removed the rind much like an you would avocado. I served the soup chunky over rice and got raves. Next I added a tbls. of Tom Yam paste (Thai red Curry) Mt wife loved it. I made the next batch with vegetable stock the Tom Yam past and pureed it. Our vegetarian friends demanded the recipe.

I subbed a sauteed garlic/onion mixture for shallots and used pureed pumpkin because I was trying to use up the rest of a big can. Because the pumpkin was pureed, I decided to puree the entire soup at the end. The texture worked out to be very good, nice and thick and rich and smooth. The flavors were also really great. The pumpkin was kind of mellow while the cilantro really took over (in a good way). The fish sauce really makes a difference, too; I tasted it before adding fish sauce and liked it much better afterward. Overall a really different, interesting, and hearty soup!

Rating: 4
I did not puree and loved the soup; may try puree next time! Delicious, light, and very very good. Makes a good first course before a nice Thai-inspired meal (I made it with meat in a chili-lime-fish sauce, brown sweet/sticky rice and a salad - yum!)

ONO! We love this complex soup and it's relatively easy. I added fresh ginger in the first boil and took my emulsion blender to the final product and also added lime juice. To the people who describe this as bland, you should always adjust the amounts of ingredients in the recipe to YOUR taste. Everyone's palate is different and you need to taste this at every step. Regard these recipes are a variable base; play with it from here. I'm constantly tasting and changing...

No, idiots, the writers didn't "forget" to put in the "puree pumpkin" step. Neither here nor in the original recipe (I have the book too) does it call for anyone to puree anything. This is an exceptional soup-- simple and lovely, a beautifully savory preparation. I made it with buttercup squash, and served it with Jasmine rice and a Lao tomato salad for a light and lovely meal.

We used this as a base to try to duplicate a pumpkin soup we had in Heidelberg and are very pleased with the results. We substituted 1/4 cup chopped lemon grass and 1 tablespoon grated ginger for the cilantro and voila! Butternut squash worked beautifully and of course it's pureed - that was an omission in the recipe. It will be the first course at our German-themed dinner party that's coming up. Anyway, try it!

Easy to make and delicious. I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin because I had it on hand, and I didn't have enough shallots so I roasted garlic to make up the difference. I pureed the soup with a stick blender -- the recipe didn't call for it, but the name calls it "silky" and the chunks just didn't look right to me. Regardless of whether I was supposed to, it was a great choice. At the end I stirred in a half teaspoon of thai red curry paste and served the whole thing with jasmine rice. I'll definitely make it again, and even serve it to company.

Surprised to see this recipe on Epicurious. I make this soup a lot with various sweet gourd squashes. I often sub in onion for the shallots and have not noticed any real difference. I think I like it best with the butternut squash, but I might try it with canned pumpkin so I can make it on the boat. It is just about the easiest soup to make and every single time I make it people ask for the recipe. People gorge themselves on it. So easy and so rewarding. I love this soup. ps. The book Hot Sour Salty Sweet is an excellent cookbook with amazing photography and back stories.

We all found this soup disgusting and threw it out without having more than a spoonful. The fish sauce was quite overpowering and didn't seem to go with the squash and shallots. We generally enjoy Asian dishes, but this did not go over well.

I made this for Thanskgiving and it got rave reviews. I omitted the fish sauce for vegetarians, and added thai chili paste and lime juice to brighten up the flavors. Also only put half of the cilantro in at the beginning, and sprinkled the rest on top. With these modifications it was great, although when I tasted it before I added the lime it seemed bland and one dimensional.

This was good - Used a can of pumpkin, more fish sauce and found it needed to be spiced up a bit so added some cayenne, red chili flakes, a little ground coriander and even some brown sugar because I like the sweet hot thai flavor. Thought it may have been better to add the fresh coriander leaves (cilantro) at the end to retain more of it's flavor. We added grilled shrimp on top which was really good. Will make this again.

I recently made this soup for a party. I was worried that it would be too "healthy" tasting, but it got rave reviews. In fact, many people asked me for the recipe.

We tripled this recipe for a party and served it with chicken satay and green papaya salad. The soup was the big hit!

Tasty dish. I pureed 3/4 of the pumpkin and left some chunks - also added one large jalapeno (cut) for some zaz and chopped half a red bell pepper for color. It was great the same night - easy and quick. I forgot about the lime, but will try that next time - also I used a half lite and half regular coconut milk combo, which worked great.

Delicious! Simple! Fast! This recipe was a complete and total delight - and especially great for the cooler weather. I highly recommend adding fresh lime at the end - perhaps offering slices of lime when serving It lightens up the heaviness of the coconut milk (which I may decrease the next time i prepare).

I made this soup for two friends who both declared they didn't like pumpkin soup. One said she who knew it was pumpkin soup said she would leave what she didn't like and ate it all.

This was my first course for a dinner for nine people including salmon with red curry sauce and mango yogurt mousse, also recipes from this site. I followed the recipe except for a few added touches from another more complex recipe for the same soup. After roasting the shallots I made them into a paste with a jalepeno pepper and a bit of water and lime juice. I then heated the cream from one can of coconut milk (just scooped the cream off the top of an unshaken can) and then added the shallot-jalepeno paste and sauted until fragrant. I followed the recipe, including the authentic pumpkin CUBES, except I added the juice of one lime along with the fish sauce. I let the soup sit for an hour before serving and reheated it and served, garnished with scallions, pepper and toasted pumpkin seeds. Although a few people were wary of it at first, everyone enjoyed it and finished it completely. Keeping the cubes of pumpkin is very important to the integrity of the dish and it also makes a beautiful presentation.

A "Keeper" sounds the group! Although I made big changes in the recipe which began witht the coconut milk. We bought 2 whole coconuts and drained the liquid which I thought was the milk. But I think I missed something as the liquid was watery and I quess I need to incorporate some of the coconut meat. Well the recipe didn't taste good at all with just this liquid. So I added canned coconut milk until the flavors of the nam pla were subdued with the fat of the coconut. I also pureed with my hand blender and strained for what I wanted to be "silky" and it was. The soup was then fabulous! I usually make a new recipe following the exact direction but artistic license took over here.

Delicious! I also used garlic instead of shallots and roughly mashed the butternut squash while cooking in the pot. I liked the soup better a little more smoother. I added a 2 T of sugar for just a little enhancement of the squash. It was delicious. It was a hearty meal; almost stew like.

Smooth and velvety. I used fresh pumpkin puree and decorated the soup with caramelized onion rings and fresh chopped scallion. The coconut milk was a nice alternative to the regular cream.

So rich and delicious, I kept wondering how much fat/calories I was consuming. I used a 3 pound orange pumpkin, which became about 4.5 to 5 cups when diced. How do I know how long to blacken the shallots? Peeling was hard because the shallots fell apart and very little was left inside. I wasn't able to taste any of it in the soup, either. Also, is there an easy way to cut and prepare the pumpkin?

This was lovely! I used butternut squash, cooked the soup a little longer than suggested & pureed it. The fish sauce gave it a wonderful, slightly unusual taste that should still be okay for non-adventurous eaters.
