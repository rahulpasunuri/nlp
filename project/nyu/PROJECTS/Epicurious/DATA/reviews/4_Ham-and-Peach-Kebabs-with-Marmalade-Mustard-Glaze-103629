I substituted Kielbasa (no ham) and apricot preserves (no Marmalade)and it was fantastic! Very simple and quick but still delicious.

I was looking for a grilled ham recipe for our early Easter dinner and came across this one. It was fantastic. Came together quickly, and is amazingly tasty. Will be using the glaze again in other ways, too. I added a little bit of onion to the skewers.

I saved this in my recipe box back in 2002 and have made it many, many times. Most people react with the attitude of "BBQd Peaches????" but they all are impressed with the recipe when they try it-even my picky, picky brother-in-law. We made this camping in Rocky Mountain National Park and I had him cut the peaches, listening to him the whole time saying "only put ham on mine, I want NO part of BBQd peaches" only to smile with pride when he said "Yum, BBQd peaches"!!

Very good, very easy recipe. Visually pleasing. My husband and I loved it!

We used the sauce to baste some ham steaks cooked on the grill, substituting apricot preserves for the marmalade and Balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice. Very tasty complement to the salty ham. Will certainly make again when we have a leftover ham to use up!

Such easy summer cooking!! The glaze was good with the ham and the peaches added a nice touch. But like cranberry sauce, you have to eat the peaches WITH a bite of ham, not alone, otherwise I found them too tart.
