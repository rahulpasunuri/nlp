Very easy to make. I'm starting my second one this week. It's like eating the best part of pecan pie, not too gooey and sweet...just right! I like the maple syrup instead of corn syrup too.

This has a huge return on investment: very simple effort that returns a pretty and delicious result. I made it the original way and it was a huge hit. Risking gilding the lily, when I made it a second time I added a layer of bittersweet chocolate chips before pouring in the walnut mixture. I don't think I'll ever make it w/o the chocolate again!

Very delicious! I quadrupled the filling recipe to make this into a deep dish 9" pie with very good success. (Used the Foolproof Pie Crust recipe from The Best of America's Test Kitchen 2009 book I recently got. Highly recommend it.) I partially pre-baked the pastry (blind baking it filled with pie weights). Made the filling ingredients as instructed (x4) with the minor addition of a few TBL of Kahlua. Very tasty indeed. Before pouring the fillng into the crust, (and after blind baking it - duh) I added a thick layer of high quality bittersweet coarsely chopped chocolate. Then poured the crust over and baked as directed. I had to tent the pie with foil for the last 10 minutes, as the walnuts were darkening, but it came out looking rustic and gorgeous. I took this to a potluck dinner party - got raves. One friend, who claims to hate pecan pie b/c of its cloying sweetness, loved it - eyes rolling to the back of his head and a big: "mmmmm!" Great with vanilla icea cream or whipped cream.

So simple and so delicious! We tried it with both lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream and everyone agreed - ice cream is a much better accompaniment.

A quick and attractive tart, and great to use only one container for the filling! I had no corn syrup so added an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup water and it still worked well. Next time I'll line the pastry with dark chocolate to add some depth to the flavour.

This took five minutes to make and was very well received. Keeper.

Yummy, pretty dessert. I used dark brown sugar and light corn syrup because that's what was on hand...still turned out great! Lovely served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Delicious and simple. I recommend "French Picnic" brand crust; it comes in flat rounds, easy to form into tarte pan. Serve with a tablespoon of unsweetened whipped cream to balance the sweetness of the tarte. This will become a staple in my dessert repertoire.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and it turned out great. Have made this several times and it was a hit.

Absolutely delicious! Everyone wanted the recipe. Easy to make too. I wondered what the addition of some chocolate chips would do to it?

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Very easy and delicious. Kind of like a lighter version of pecan pie. I definitely will make it again.

Very easy to make. I froze it, took it across country for Thanksgiving and baked it upon arrival. It was less substantial than I had anticipated. However, considering how rich it was that was probably a good thing.

Very easy and quick. A great recipe for entertaining and usually you have the ingredients on hand. I substituted pecans and light corn syrup and added 2 tablespoons of Capt. Morgan's spiced rum while simmering. A little melted white chocolate drizzled over the top for decoration might be nice.

Really good/easy. Imagine it would be good with ice cream or whipped cream as well.

Fantastic! We liked it served warm with vanilla ice cream.
