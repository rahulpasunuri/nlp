Actually in spite of the prior reviews, I would make this again. The flavors blended well and it was exceedingly easy to make. The vinaigrette was subtle, not overpowering and the flavors of the beans, peas and turnips melded well with it. What was especially nice is that my children both loved it.

A disappointment to be sure. Followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions or alterations. Basic green beans or peas would have been preferable.

Ugh! This was just horrible. The picture looks beautiful in the magazine and the recipe uses olive oil instead of butter, which is great for guests who are watching their cholesterol. It did look nice, but you couldn't taste anything but turnips. The vinaigrette wasn't powerful enough to flavor it, and even adding lemon juice didn't improve it. Everyone at the table was a great vegetable lover, but no one ate any but the smallest bit and left the rest on their plates. I threw the whole thing out.
