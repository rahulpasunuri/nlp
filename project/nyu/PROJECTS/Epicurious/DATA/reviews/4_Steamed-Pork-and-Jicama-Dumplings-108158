These were a hit!! Easy to make and everyone said how delicious they were. I slightly browned the pork before mixing into the recipe, thus lessening the steam time and ensuring the pork was thoroughly cooked. The water chestnuts were a great substitute for the jicama. I forgot to top with sesame seeds, but they weren't missed at all.

By far the best dumplings I have made. I have given up on finding a better recipe! The pork is better than chicken because it has more fat and flavor. The jicama gives a great crunch, if you don't have them on hand then water chestnuts are a good replacement. One of my favorite recipes! The only problem is that you spend a significant amount of time on them only to literally eat them all as they come out of the wok!

Really great, but really time consuming. Luckily I made them on Sunday for a party the following Saturday, because I never would have had the time the day of the party. Definitely a hit though.

These were superb! I used water chestnut instead of jicama because I already had a few cans. Made them for a birthday party and I'm going to make them again tonight for a Chinese-themed party. Excellent.

These were great and my husband really loved them. They are easy to make, just a bit tedious. The dipping sauce was a must.

This is THE perfect recipe for Pot Stickers. I use Water Chestnuts & leave out the green onion. Other than that it all remains the same. I am single, but make the full amount everytime and freeze the batch. They make a wonderful and fast meal. I tried the sauce the first time, but realized I prefer just good ol' soy sauce.

I used water chestnuts instead of jicama, and round won ton wrappers. The amount of pork it took to fill the round won ton wrappers was probably a bit much; each dumpling was two-bites instead of one. I would have preferred one-bite sized. But the taste and texture were excellent nonetheless.

i made this for a recent cocktail party and it was a hit with everyone. it was so simple to make. i steamed it in the bamboo steamer, but be to sure to oil the surface before or else your dumplings will stick. mine did not look like the dumplings in the photo, but you can go to http://runoutofroad3.bl ogspot.com under "drunkey monkey" post for the picture of how mine's turn out.

We really enjoyed these dumplings!!! I was unable to purchase the wonton wrappers here in Sweden. I was able to find thai spring roll wrappers. They were too thin so the bottom desintegrated when steaming it. I had to cut again an extra layer of wrapper and put them underneath. I also added a sheet of baking paper with a few holes between the metal steamer and the dumplings. This made my job much easier as the dumplings did not stick any more to the steamer. The recipe is AWESOME. I am giving it a 4 forks since I know that the problems I encountered were due to the lack of original ingredients. After my tool modification I am really glad. My husband ate at least 20 dumplings on one sitting! (He is skinny I do not know how he could eat so many!).

We have made this several times and will make it several more; fantastic as a potluck contribution- anybody who tasted them demanded the recipe.

did not use jicama..just a little more green onion and it was still fantastic..every one raved about it ...a few wanted the recipe...the sauce was perfect

These would be good for a party apetizer, since the recipe makes 60 dumplings. They were easy, although time consuming. The flavors were good and reminded us of our favorite dim sum restaurant. (Next time, I'll reduce the recipe and make only 20 dumplings.)

We really enjoyed these, but they were more work than I expected. I didn't have the requisite cookie cutter, and used an inverted measuring cup (with a knife) instead. Next time I'll buy round wrappers. Also, I didn't have a metal strainer or other recommended equipment, and substituted a plastic colander which worked fine. I made them the day before, and am looking forward to how they taste after I freeze the rest of them. FYI - they have a strong smell - I stored them (overnight) in my garage fridge, and you could smell them as soon as you walked into the garage.

FABULOUS! Even better than my local Chinese because the wrappers are more delicate and less doughy. I substituted water chestnuts for jicama. Also I left wrappers square (otherwise, just buy round wrappers) and, after filling them, closed them up by pleating and twisting, enclosing the filling entirely for a more traditional dumpling. These are terrific!!!

Awesome appetizer! Very easy to make. Takes some time to put together with a 3 year old "helping". I couldn't find the black sesame seeds but will look harder next time. Everyone thought I bought these at a Chinese restaurant.
