A version of this is standard in our kitchen. When the grandkids come to visit they always ask for Grandma's chicken "nuggets". When we are in the mood for some red sauce and mozz, it's a perfect protein. Also, I don't pan fry -I spray with olive oil and oven bake - tastes great -it's healthier and no one misses the fat!

Quite easy to make and very tasty. Have made it twice already and will make it again!

Delicious, quick, convenient! The only take out fried chicken that I will eat is Popeye's. This is so much better and must be much healthier since it is not deep fried w/ skin on. This is the only way that I will eat "fried" chicken ever again....

I've been making variations of lovely panko crumbed chicken nuggets similar to this for years, however in this recipe the addition of mustard powder is excellent. I buy ready sliced chicken breast (stir fry) and crumb up a large batch (pressing firmly into the panko), placing single layers in freezer bags, and then lay flat inside a large ziplock bag and freeze. They're a little delicate so sometimes I also put them in a container in the freezer. I take some to my elderly father who loves them. Great for someone who likes to 'cook', but isn't all that good with recipes or prep. Easy choice to pan fry or spray with oil and pop in oven. Great to have on hand, and any way you choose to do them, they make a nice quick meal with salad.

For all the comments about fat content,why not follow the recipe but instead of pan frying, spritz them with olive oil and bake on a sheet of parchment?

parmesan chicken, pan fried or baked, has always been a family favorite, it's elegant simplicity carries it from a weeknight family dinner to dinner with friends...the dry mustard was a nice, tasty twist tho...haven't used it before, but now i sure will ;0)

This is delicious and may be used with veal, chicken or pork cutlets. I used only half of oil suggested. I have also used capers because I love them.

Serendipity. I actually made this almost exact recipe last night. Only thing I did not do was the dry mustard. I pounded cutlets to 1/2 inch instead of 1/4 and added about 1/2 cup of yellow cornmeal to the breading mix for extra crunch. Great way to make cutlets!

This is a great recipe. By using cutlets the chicken cooks quickly without drying out. They weren't greasy and had a wonderful flavor. I served them over a baby spinach salad with just a simple red wine vinergarett. Will DEFINATELY make these again.

Substitute thin-cut, bone-in pork chops for the chicken. Even tastier. If you don't have mustard powder in your larder, just add some Dijon to the egg bath.

VERY TASTY and easy. My only gripe/concern is the "guilt-free" statement. This is still a lot of olive oil, even if most of it is for the frying. Ideally, and I thought things were going this way, "guilt-free" nuggets or any such treat would have a baked version, without all that oil. Also, bite-size vs full-size does not help the oil fat number; in fact, with more surface area to absorb the oil, quite the opposite. We love these recipes overall, but I would like to ask, again, that some nutrition information be provided---although I understand that is not easy (nor standardizable) for home-chef-developed recipes. Onward to good food and good health both!

Wonderful way to cook chicken - but use a real nice non-stick pan and reduce the oil used to cook them by at least half. As written the recipe calls for a whole days worth of oil for one person per serving.

I made these on a Sunday as suggested and thawed them on Wednesday. They fried up beautifully and were delicious with lemon wedges. I loved them! Next time I'll make twice as many so I'll have two meals.
