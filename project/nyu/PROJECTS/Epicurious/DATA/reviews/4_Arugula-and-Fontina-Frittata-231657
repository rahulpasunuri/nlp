Great! I made this twice, once with cubes of fontina and once with shredded mozzarella. Shredding the cheese helps it melt and brown better in the broiler. I found it is better to use 2 or 3 cloves of garlic (and discarding as the recipe states) instead of one. This gives the dish that hint of garlicky goodness without overwhelming the dish by leaving it in as one of the other reviewers suggested.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, with modifications. No salt was added, since I tasted the Fontina and it was salty. I did use 4 eggs and 2 liquid egg equivalents. The timing was right on, and the slight saltiness of the Fontina balanced the peppery bitterness of the arugula nicely.

Excellent! I added a couple cups of cooked, diced potatoes to the pan with some butter. Then arugula, then eggs, then cheese. Very filling.

I used up what I had in the fridge. I sauted 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 of a leek, 1/2 of a yellow bellpepper, and the arugula from my neighbors garden. I added the egg and plain feta cheese. mozzarella cheese on top with tomatoes and then in the broiler. It had great flavor. A easy, qucik, good dinner.

the final product was tasty but a bit plain. i served it with some bread but wished that i had included potatoes into the mix somehow.

Excellent! Some of my guests (with less sophisticated palettes I fear) didn't like it - too much punch from the arugula. But my husband, mother and I loved it. And so easy to make!

While easy and warm, flavor was lacking. I made exactly as written, except for grating the cheese rather than cube, for easier coverage. I'd pass on making it again.

delicious! i minced the garlic and left it in recipe. it wasn't under-seasoned, but it could've used more salt in my opinion... i also grated the cheese ahead of time. it sped up the process and seemed better than melting big chucks of cheese on top.

I made this recipe for Easter and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I used 5 cloves of garlic and still overall the dish had very little flavor. I will say it was quick and very easy but I think there are better egg dishes out there. I most likely will not make it again.

This was absolutely delicious and one of the easiest recipes to make. All of the flavors blended well together and I look forward to making it again in the future!

I used shallot and manchego instead of garlic and fontina. Super yum.

Easy, quick and fabulous. I used half whole eggs and half egg whites and added sliced tomatoes and chives at the end. A winner!

Excellent and so simple! We used minced garlic -- and didn't discard it, and chopped the arugula before adding the egg. The fontina cheese was delicious melted on top. My husband added more salt than the recipe called for -- we like our food on the tastier side. The whole family enjoyed it. Yummy!

A simple recipe but delicious. I decided to try this because I had a lot of fresh arugula in the garden, and the good reviews. I used granulated garlic so I did not discard the garlic after sauteeing. I substituted mozzarella for the Fontina as another reviewer suggested. I also sliced a green bellpepper and red Fresno chili and placed the rings on top of the cheese for presentation. A nice autumn dish for a weeknight dinner.

This recipe is perfect...It contains few ingredients,is easy to make as a quick breakfast or light dinner...you can even serve it at a party cut into small hors d'oeuvre size pieces. It is delicious even reheated in the microwave. I make it so often, I now just keep the recipe taped to my fridge. Note: you can also use fresh spinich or a spinich-arugula mix...whatever is available.

This was just delicious- perfect with a big green salad for a simple, satisfying dinner.

Until now, I was a frittata virgin, but this recipe *rocks*!! I was intrigued by another use for the fontina I had leftover from another recipe, and I thought the arugula (which is hard to come by where I live) could be replaced by (blanched) asparagus, rather than greens. It worked out wonderfully!! The timing was perfect, and I recommend using an 8-inch cast iron skillet, if you have one (no sticking issues, I assure you)! Fantastic, and I can't wait to make it again!!

Followed this recipe exactly and love it. I had two slices and my husband scarffed the rest. Will definitely make this again and again and again!

Simple and delicious - perfect when you don't have much time. I got worried when the eggs took some time to set and it kept bubbling up in the center but in the end it still looked good. Genuine Fontina val d'Aosta is a nice touch, mild and flavorful.

This was easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 of a red pepper, sliced in matchsticks, at the same time as the garlic. Next time I will lightly chop the arugula so that it is easier to cut the firttata. Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious and very easy. I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely in a large skillet. I added 1/2 of a red pepper, sliced matchstick size, at the same time as the garlic for color and flavor. Next time, I would lightly chop the arugula so the frittata is easier to slice. Don't be afraid to use all 5 ounces of the arugula as it does wilt significantly. This is a keeper!

This is one of those recipes that is simple, yet fabulous-depending mostly on the quality of the ingredients. I happened to have some arugula in the fridge, but not fontina. I used a leftover creamy, earthy french cheese (sorry, don't know the name yet) and its flavor was the highlight. This is a great recipe for spotlighting your cheese, so make the best of it! Everyone loved the frittata and asked about the cheese!

This is a great recipe. It is very quick and easy. I've also used the same basic recipe with spinach, good quality calamatta olives, and feta cheese. Yum, and yum.

I made this dish in a hurry! I used baby spinach instead of arugula and I realized I had no garlic, so I ommit it. I also added red and yellow bellpepper. My guests loved it! It was really delicious and it was a great hit! I like frittatas and omelets a little more moist, so I would leave it under the broiler just until it starts getting some color, to preserve the moisture!

My husband is on a business trip so I searched for something that would be light and quick. This was absolutely perfect! Since I was cooking for one I used one egg and two egg whites. (I tried just one egg white but it didn't cover the bottom of the pan, so I added another.) I used about 1 cup of greens, and about 1 ounce of goat cheese (I didn't have fontina). Also I added a small handful of chopped tomato to the top w/the cheese. One quick tip...instead of using the amount of oil called for, I always just lightly brush oil on the pan which saves a lot of calories and doesn't stick. This probably took just 10-15 minutes including making a small salad which was the pefect accompaniment! These adjustments made one large frittata, I even have some left over for breakfast!

A really simple and tasty dish. I made this for dinner and had leftovers for lunch. A great way to use arugula. I used minced garlic and didn't remove it from the dish. I also used an entire carton (small) of egg whites instead of eggs and gruyere cheese instead of fontina--basically I used what I had. I would cut back on the olive oil to saute, but thought this was great.

I got delicious results adding chopped green onions to the garlic, and substituting a combination of Swiss and American cheese for the fontina.

I made this with the following modifications. I first cooked 5 slices of pancetta, diced, in the iron skillet. I took them out, drained the fat, sauteed an onion and the garlic (chopped, instead of halved) in a bit of olive oil until soft, then wilted the arugula with the onion and garlic, and added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. I transferred the arugula and onion to a plate and added a bit more olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan. I added the beaten eggs and pepper and just a pinch of salt (since the pancetta is so salty) to the skillet and cooked them without touching for 30 seconds, to form a crust on the bottom, so the frittata won't stick. Then I returned the arugula, onion, and pancetta to the skillet and cooked the rest as directed (a few minutes on the stove then some under the broiler). It made a great easy dinner served with fresh sliced heirloom tomatoes and bread. Delish!

This was a really nice brunch dish. I followed the recipe exactly except had to add a couple of minutes to the cooking time before putting the whole thing under the broiler. I loved the arugula flavor in the dish, though the fontina is a little strong for me. I found that the fontina seemed stronger when I served this at room temperature than when I served it warm.
