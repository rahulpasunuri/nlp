I have mixed feelings about this dish. i loved the beef and snowpea stirfry. It was excellent. i have mixed feelings about the XO sauce after obtaing the ingredients. It may be an acquired taste, but I did not enjoy the dried scallop contribution. I may have prepared too many as I only used half the XO sauce on all the other ingredients as printed. I will probably try this again as written without the scallops.
