I live in Colorado at 7200 ft and tried the pastry recipe 2x with no success. The dough was never stiff enough to hold and rise like a cream puff ring which is what I imagined it would be like since there was no picture. The sauce and filling is delicious and I will use it for my regular cream puff recipe which uses more eggs. I noted that you must cook the dough for 3 minutes before removing from heat and adding the eggs. Too bad it didn't work for my gourmet wine dinner. I would not recommend this for high altitude baking.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner. Absolutely divine. Took more time than I thought.

This was a great dessert. Delicious and impressive. Many steps involved in preparation, but not really a difficult recipe. You MUST make the sauce as well -- it was amazing!

This dessert is perfect for a chilly winter evening, as the sauce is served warm. For best results, do not undercook the choux in the pot.
