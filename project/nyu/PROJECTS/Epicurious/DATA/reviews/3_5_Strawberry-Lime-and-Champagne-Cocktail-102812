Delicious with or without brandy. Also, for non-alcohol types, more club soda, garnish with a lime wheel and voila, a delicious, beautiful virgin cocktail! Perfect for 4th of July.

We served this cocktail in champagne flutes on a hot, steamy, late spring night. Perhaps it was too fancy for the simple dinner that followed --grilled burgers topped with grilled tomatoes and onions, with sides of corn & mixed greens -- but no one was complaining. This drink was a huge hit, with not a drop to spare by the end of the evening.
