Wonderful. The tarragon and tomato salad is so easy and really elevates the simple steak. A great dish for those times you want something a little special but not too out there.

GREAT! simple, flavorful, and quick recipe good enough for company. The Tomato-Tarragon Salad is THE recipe. I served this with Grilled Polenta with Corn and Parmesan from this website. Wonderful dinner.

Great! I used home-grown tomatoes - kinda soft, but with that wonderful flavor. Served with Potato Salad with Garlic Mayonnaise and Chives, also from this site. A winning combination!

This actually could serve 3-4 people with some leftover. Use Roma tomatoes instead of beefsteak, they have much more flavor and hold their own in salads.
