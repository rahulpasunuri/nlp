Ha! I meant "Harvard beets" instead of "Boston beets".

We enjoyed this dish. In retrospect, I probably should have flattened the chicken a little before dredging and frying, because it took a long time to cook through. The salsa had a really nice flavor. We used boston beets instead of pickled, and used finely chopped red onions instead of scallions. Also we used frozen corn for this recipe, which worked well. Would definitely make again. Went well with cornbread.

The chicken tastes a lot more caloric than it is-the small amount of butter adds a ton of flavor. I had to use frozen instead of fresh corn, but it still came out great.

This is really fantastic! It is SO easy and gives a very attractive presentation. It is super simple to make, but do not be tempted to leave out the pickled beets, they add great color and flavor.

I love this recipe. Does anyone happen to have nutritional information for it?

The salsa really is the star of the show here. I made it exactly as the recipe states, even though I do NOT like beets... and it was amazing! We had a hard time telling when the chicken was done, so the cornmeal scorched a little. Probably the only gotcha for us, and maybe not a problem at all for more experienced cooks. We served it with black beans and loved it.

I wasn't a fan of the chicken but I really liked the salsa. I'll probably try the salsa on a different chicken recipe.

Mmmmm... My boyfriend and I LOVED this dish. In fact, of all the meals I've made the year and a half we've been together, my boyfriend declared this his favorite. I recommend it very highly. I used roasted frozen corn from Trader Joes, but alas, they had no beets. I added some chipotle in adobo to the salsa to balance out the sweet mango, and some crushed red pepper to the chicken coating. Mmmmm. I think I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it! MAKE THIS TONIGHT!!

The chicken was very good, we are dealing with a wheat allergy and this recipe gave us the crispiness without flour. I didn't have all of the salsa ingredients on hand, so I threw together cherry tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, black beans and roasted corn. It turned out great and with very little effort.

A frequent favorite. Very easy to make. Occasionally I can't find ripe mango at a moment's notice and I just omit it. The salsa is still excellent.

I've yet to make the chicken part of this recipe, but I think I would have this salsa (in a bowl & call it a toasted corn salad) for my last meal--it's so delicious! And I haven't tried it yet with the beets... I will someday, but it just seems so perfect with the corn & mango... ahhh!

I'm not sure what happened, but this recipe was a big failure for me. I think if I'd pounded the breasts, as an earlier reviewer suggested, it would have been better. They were so large that they took too long to cook, and the cornmeal crust ended up scorched. Also, I didn't think the coating was all that interesting--I think I would salt the crust rather than the chicken. The salsa was good, but I don't think it saved the chicken.

Fabulous recipe! Made as written with the exception of using frozen corn -- toasted 5 min. instead of 4. Will definitely make this again..soon! Served with steamed broccoli, Pomegranate-Tangerine Sorbet (from epicurious.com) and Pomegranate Margaritas (from foodandwine.com). One of the best all around dinners for a warm spring/summer evening.

I had a mango, corn, and chicken in my kitchen and was faced with what to do with them for dinner.... Logged onto Epicurious and found this recipe - it was great! I think the best thing about this recipe is that you can really adjust the salsa to what you have on hand/what you like (as the other reviewers note as well). I omitted the beets because I didn't have any, but added some red pepper for color (finely diced). I also used canned corn (hey, it's January after all!), and didn't bother with toasting. The chicken was really delicious too. I would make sure it's pretty thinly filleted so that it cooks before it starts to burn.

I made this for dinner and it was delicious. I substituted fresh peach for the mango because when I opened the jar of mangos it was spoiled! Well, I prefer peaches to mangos and the peaches added to the salsa were out of this world.. I also added finely minced habanero pepper - just enough for the little sting. The spiced beets, and peaches were diced to be the same size as the corn - yummy! My boyfriend really liked it too! The salsa tastes best warm.

guess I made two mistakes, baking the chicken and using boneless thighs. Throughout the meal I had the urge to shout "it's shake and bake and I haalped" However,we LOVED the salsa (added extra garlic, scallions and used Penzeys Black and Red spice)

This recipe was good, but different. I was unable to find mangos, so I added mango chutney instead. This seemed to work okay. The salsa was interesting with the beets, but very tasty. My one big mistake was with the cayenne pepper. I added way to much and therefore the chicken was very spicy -- too spicy. I found it difficult to properly rate this recipe due to my own error. We consumed lots of fluid during this meal. Thank goodness it was just family!

This salsa was amazing--and that coming from both my husband and me, who are not fond of beets. Would definitely make again.

Very pretty! Accidentally bought plain, sliced beets.. so I drained them and replaced liquid w/ vinegar to 'pickle' for awhile. No ripe mangos for sale so did w/out and omitted cilantro, and it was great. The look and taste of the salsa made me feel like I was dining at a beach front resort. :)

This chicken is so EASY and it tastes great. It was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the flavor of the coating was simple and good. I used the corn roasted salsa from the recipe "Sliced steak with corn roasted salsa" from June 2000 and it was fantastic. This is great for an evening when you don't have a lot of time but want to have something delicious.

Here is another one of those great recipes that I had the unbelievably good fortune to stumble upon while leafing back through old issues of the magazine. I made it for the first time recently, in the dead of a New England January. What a treat to be transported via tastebud to that precious 'first-week-of-August' feeling. Easy to prepare, can be made in advance, flavorful, leftovers are scrumptious, -- an all around winner. -- Bonus: The dish is so easy you'll have the energy to throw a marguerita together. -- Grab a self tanner, choose some good music, and skip those $$$ and risky airline flights. This is a great impromptu alternative that will chase away winter.

Yummy and great the next day too. I had left over spiced sour cream from the cajun shrimp tacos, and I served that with some crisped flour tortillas. Unfortunatly, my mango was bad, so I had to add some more olive oil to mellow the garlic in the salsa. Turned out fine.

A great, easy variation for standard chicken breasts. I live with someone who hates beets yet loved this dish. Next time I will try the suggestion of adding angel hair pasta.

Looks great - tastes great, a wonderful quick dinner. I didn't have cilantro, the salsa was still great!

I didn't have any pickled beets so I added extra lime juice and cooked some black beans along with the corn. It was delicious, and next time I will definitely try the beets.

Ummm, ummm, good. My husband and son do not eat beets (I love them) but I showed them the reviews and suggested that we try it as written. Needless to say, we all loved the dish, especially the salsa! Use any leftover salsa on grilled fish or veal chops. We'll definitely make this recipe again.

This dish was great. I'm glad I read through the reviews and decided to keep the beets (even though they're not my favorite) I place the chicken over some angel-hair pasta, poured the salsa on top and around the dish. everyone loved it!

This recipe was soooo good and very quick and easy to prepare. The salsa had such a unique taste - I added a serrano chili to the salsa and it delivered the perfect heat for my palatte. The serrano also balanced out the sweetness of the mango in a pleasant way. I will make this recipe a lot. I took the advice of another cook on the site and used crushed cornbread stuffing instead of cornmeal - I think it is another great addition to an already good recipe!!

This instantly has become a favorite. I am not a fan of beets by any means but this combination of flavors is so delicious I have already made this once with chicken and another time for company with pork tenderloin. WOW! Don't be afraid of the beets and don't change a thing (unless you want to add a little kick to the chicken coating).

This recipe was outstanding! We have a weekly dinner club and my wife's friend's were very impressed with the presentation and flavor. The salsa with a tablespoon of sour cream provided an excellent presentation and compliment to the chicken. I may bake the chicken rather than sauteing it next time. This would make it absolutely perfect.

This dish is very good, but is even better when diced avocado is added to the salsa, when actual cornbread crumbs (you can smash cornbread stuffing to achieve this) are substituted for the cornmeal, and a little sour cream is served between the chicken and the salsa. Another variation: fresh pico de gallo (diced tomato, red onion and cilantro) instead of the mango salsa. Try it!
