This is an addendum to my review last week, now that I've digested not only all the leftovers but also the other users' comments. Two observations. 1) The anise is crucial to the success and the uniqueness--perhaps I should say magic--of this recipe. Don't substitute some other spice if you don't like it (or don't have it). 2) Gorgonzola crumbles complement the flavor superbly, though obviously adding to the fat and calorie count. But still...!!

The other reviewers almost scared me off, but I'm glad I decided to trust Gourmet . This is delicious- -and unusual--with a pleasant natural sweetness from the anise seed. I confess I wondered how the anise was going to work in this salad, especially with the mustard--but it all came together (very prettily, too). If you think about it, jicama has a little bit of that taste that seems to be the bottom note of anise, fennel, tarragon, and maybe even basil. I didn't pulverize the seeds; just toasted them and sprinkled them over the veggies before tossing. If you like having a big bowl of raw vegetable slaw in the 'fridge as a healthy food to eat to one's heart's content--as I do--you'll find this a nice change from the usual, I promise!

Not great. We are jicama lovers and decided grated jicama and carrots with chopped parsley and red onion with a vinegrette dressing.....much better.

I don't like anise but combined ingredients from the jicama, carrot and lime salad. I shredded the ingredients, added cumin and dried, toasted red, peppers, green onions and sunflower seeds as well as a little sesame oil.
