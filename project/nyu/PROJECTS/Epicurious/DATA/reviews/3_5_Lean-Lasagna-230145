The sauce for this is great and can be used in several dishes. It is an excellent healthy option when you are in the mood for italian!

I really like this meal - it is the perfect lasagna if you are craving lasagna, but want to be spared the calories. I used Italian spiced turkey burger and it was perfect.

I found this recipe when trying to use up leftover turkey burgers from a BBQ. It was easy, very tasty and pretty healthy for lasagna. The whole wheat noodles are great - they have a good texture and flavor. I took a poster's advice to saute the mushrooms on the side then add the meat once all the water was absorbed and this helped it not get soggy. I also added chopped fresh basil to the spinach, but I'm not sure if it helped; for once I think dried would have been better. The fat free ricotta tastes great and fresh nutmeg made all the difference. I also shaved parmesan on top of the cheese before baking. Great dish, I will make it again!

I was dubious about the flavor and found this to be a wonderful dish. I added red pepper flakes which gave it a slight kick. Big hit.

Followed recipe to the T. Didn't find it soggy one bit. In fact, I will probably add a bit more tomato sauce next time. It was a total hit though...served with Olive Bread and a Fennel/Blood Orange Salad over Proscuitto. YUMMMM Guests were totally satiated!

Used all fresh ingredients (spices too) but what was great in flavour was lacking in overall appeal. The dish was a bit soggy. Perfect when reheat though.

So delicious I make two at a time and freeze one (in pieces) for quick, healthy weeknight meals. Serve it with garlic bread..mmmmm!! A few modifications: fry the mushrooms on their own until all liquid evaporates, then add to the meat after it's browned; skip the dry and add fresh basil to the spinach layer instead; sprinkle a bit of grated parmesan before the mozzarella; use the nutmeg nut!

I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't made it and eaten it myself. I was dubious that FF ricotta could taste good, but mixed with the spinach and the nutmeg (which makes it taste almost sweet -- 1/4 tsp is all you need), it was hearty and delicious. Like many other reviewers, I added fresh garlic (4ish cloves) and fresh basil chopped with the spinach. And I confess I upped the mozz to 3 cups and sprinkled a bit of parmesan on the top.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I didn't have any ground turkey, so I used ground chicken instead. Everything worked out. I loved all the veggies in it, and maybe the next time I'll add a full cup of mushrooms and fresh basil (just for fun, but doesn't really need it) I can see how some people would call for more sauce, but I didn't need any extra for mine. Yumm! Will make this again soon :)

We made this using both spinach and chard that we got from our CSA, and it was fantastic! My husband said it's the best lasagna we've every made-- and he was pretty proud of the previous recipes. The one complaint is that with all the veg, the lasagna was quite watery. And we even used no-boil noodles. I'm sure we'll be eating this throughout the summer.

I made this with full-fat ricotta and full-fat mozzarella, which probably influences my rating, but maybe not so much. The meat layer was very tasty - I thought it was better than ground beef. Also, I really liked that the spinach stayed bright green (because you don't pre-cook it), and there's a lot of it. It's not like a lot of spinach lasagnes that just have a token layer of spinach.

I added a touch of extra sauce, then added a little water to the jar to thin it and curb the added sodium. I used 1.5 times the amount of low fat instead of FF ricotta. By serving 12 pieces instead of 8 I was still able to enjoy the extra creaminess without feeling guilty. It's my new favorite lasagna recipe!

I made this last night and it was really excellent. Needless to say I used a ton of fresh herbs instead of just garlic powder, and added about two cups of fresh basil to the ricotta mixture since I had it on hand. Also took the advice on making more sauce - initially I thought I had way too much but when I started spooning it in, I realized I could have used even more. I'd say go 150% on the sauce, volume-wise. Really easy for a lasagna and no too cheesy.

I thought this turned out good but needed more sauce. The first time I made it I followed the recipe, and the second time I added another cup of sauce, and it turned out perfect! Boyfriend loved it.

Really love this recipe. Very easy to make your own and change up depending on what you have in the fridge. Agree with most reviewers and add more spices and loads of fresh garlic. Otherwise go nuts and use what's available.

Good recipe! I just made it for the first time today, and will definitely be making again. I did change one thing; substituted a 10oz. box chopped spinach (thawed and drained) for the fresh. Very tasty lasagna!

I also forgot! i used regular noodles (i.e. not oven-ready), but didn't boil them. the moisture and heat in the oven was enough to cook the noodles perfectly.

great lasagna. got my green-averse roommate to chow down on spinach. i used about 12oz of cheese. i also froze the lasagna before cooking it.

Great recipe! Added more spices than the recipe required as well as a chipotle while the turkey mixture simmered. I had never made lasagna before and was a little unsure, but this recipe is really quite easy.

This recipe is always a hit in my house- my husband LOVES it! I usually try to make it with the whole wheat noodles, but sometimes if time doesn't permit, I use the regular oven-ready ones (haven't seen whole wheat oven-ready noodles- if you have, please let me know where you got them). I always use more sauce than the recipe calls for. I like getting the onion nice and thin, so I use the food processor to chop it up (good for people like my father-in-law who like onions but not in their sauce). SELF delivers again!

Great recipe. The whole family loved it, even the kids. They loved the taste and didn't even think of asking what it was made with. This was my first time making lasagna and didn't feel overwhelmed. Will defenitely make it again.

So I was I looking for a healthy alternative to fatty lasagna, a recipe that both my husband and I would both love. I decided to take the advice of a few of the reviewers as well as add my own flair. I made the mixture much larger than what the recipe calls for. Bigger is better, right??? I added a little more than double the spices, I used 1 TBS. of fresh garlic, 1 full 24 oz. container of LOW FAT ricotta, 1 20 oz pack of extra lean ground turkey, 1 pack of spicey turkey sausage, 2 jars spicey pasta sauce, probably 2 cups of shitake mushrooms, 1.5 cups of shredded butternut squash, 2 cups of shoe string carrots, 1 zuccini, and a full bunch of red swiss chard. I also used whole wheat noodles. This is AMAZING! My husband LOVED it! I loved it!

Good, not great. Added the extra spices and fresh garlic. Needs salt. My husband and 3 year old ate it up though, so it is very good.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Definitely double the spices - I went a little overboard on the red pepper flakes, but the spiciness was good. I added chopped up uncooked zucchini to the meat mixture when it was almost done. Any vegetable would work. I used a little less ricotta with the spinach, and although it looked like a very uneven combination it turned out perfectly. I've had it for every meal this week - and it's still great!

Excellent recipe! I doubled the spices, as suggested, and added real garlic. Next time, I would avoid doubling the nutmeg, as it was a little too strong.

This lasagna was excellent! We probably added more mozz than called for in the recipe, but whatever. A few red pepper flakes and fresh chopped garlic really added some flavor. The next-day leftovers were even better!

Tasty lasagna, keeps well. Took leftovers to work and they all enjoyed!!!!

This was by far the best low fat healthy lasagna I've ever had. I used chicken italien sausage instead of turkey and mini bella mushrooms. I also used a dilute prepared sauce similar to another reviewer. Delicious! Will make for company or as a pot luck dish.

Pretty good overall. I used turkey italian sausage to bring in a little more flavor. Might be better with a little red pepper flake thrown in.

Next time I would make it with ground beef, I didnt enjoy the taste of the ground turkey. I also found it needed more time to cook. I would also recommend using more mozz. cheese then asked for.

Minced 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder - sauted with onions. Really good lasagna recipe - didn't feel like I was missing out at all.

I used 2.5lbs of ground turkey, the sauce looked a little thin without the second package. I used uncooked Green squash, broccoli and spinach all cut up in bite size chunks, which turned out great. I would suggest using more spices as everyone else mentioned. Also the park skim mozzarella did not melt well, I would suggest using the regular kind just not as much. I added crushed red pepper to add a little kick.

I subsituted fresh basil and oregano for the dried herbs and used shiitakes for the mushrooms. I find that if you make the sauce ahead of time and let it marinade overnight the flavor is significantly better, and it saves prep time. There hasn't been a time when I've made this recipe and not received rave reviews!

Rating: 3
Very tasty dish for a heart healthy recipe. For the tomato sauce I used half "Muir Glen" organic Portabello Mushroom Pasta Sauce and half tomato sauce. I didn't use Italian Seasoning but used the tsp of each herb suggested. Use all 6 cups of spinach, much to my surprise, it shrinks down tremendously. At the table we added salt, pepper and cayenne to taste. Nice texture, subtle flavor, nutmeg is a must.

Great, hearty recipe. Increased spices as suggested in other reviews. Will definitely add to our regular rotation!

Made almost exactly as recipe suggested - doubled spices as suggested, reduced spinach (didn't have enough). In my opinion, bland and untastey. Would never make again.

Excellent! I've made this twice and both times I skipped the mushrooms and added zucchini and broccoli which gave it a great texture. I also went heavier on the spices (except the nutmeg which was a bit overpowering the first time) and added some crushed red pepper.

Very yummy Lasagna! I as well used low-fat ricotta as I simply couldn't find the non-fat variety. I also used buffalo instead of turkey. Terrific sub! I also agree with increasing the spice load (I almost doubled it) as well as the sauce. Fresh parsley too. I'd certainly make this one again as I'm going to have plenty of leftovers for easy weeknight reheating!

Great recipe. I omitted the mushrooms and added a bit more spice. Also, I found that it could use a bit more sauce than the recipe called for. All around....pretty darn good.

Made this yesterday and it turned out fabulous. I used part skim ricotta and added a few slices of fresh mozzarela. I also used whole wheat gluten free pasta. Can't wait to make it again.

Fabulous. Freezes well. Thought needed more sauce, a bit dry: also spiced up sauce more second time/ saute a bit garlic/onion/tomato sauce/spices and used part skim and have make with mix of lean pork/veal instead of turkey also. Admit have used frozen spinach, no one seemed to notice. Second time I made two and froze second in sections for crazy nights and it freezes well.

This was wonderful! It definitely didn't taste "lean." I made it for a birthday party and my family raved about it. One small change: I used part-skim ricotta instead of fat-free. Definitely a keeper!

This meal was ok, but you really do need that italian seasoning for flavor. I added little bit more than suggested.

I thought this was perfect for lowfat healthy lasagna. i couldn't find whole wheat noodles so I just bought the regular ones that you don't need to boil. I prefer whole wheat but the no boil noodles made this recipe even easier to make. I would def. make it again.

I'd recommend using fresh herbs and spinach in this lasagne. I used part skim cheeses since it was being fed to little kids and they love it.I have also used ground lean pork which is also very tasty.

Pretty darn yummy for "lean" lasagna. Italian seasoning is key - makes the turkey taste like italian sausage b/c of the sage. I used part skim ricotta instead of fat free. This will definitely replace my standard lasagna recipe. Even the 4 and 5 yr olds ate it! Spinach and all! Fresh spinach is also key, in my opinion.
