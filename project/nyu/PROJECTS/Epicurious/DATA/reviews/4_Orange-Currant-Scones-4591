So good! Flaky center, a little bit of sweetness...Will definitely make again and maybe try with different dried fruits or nuts. My only suggestion to others is to sift the dry ingredients as I got a big hunk of baking powder in one bite, as I probably undermixed before cutting in the butter...

These scones were delicious with a little jam. Nice moist but flakey consistency.

When the recipe said "[add] butter and shortening; using fingertips, rub in until coarse meal forms," instead I used a hand pastry cutter. I'm not sure if the result was related to that change, but the scones turned out very light, airy, and had a pastry-like crispy exterior.

This is the recipe for THE perfect scone! As I didn't have any buttermilk, I mixed yogurt, cream and water. I also simply used unsalted butter instead of the shortening. I omitted the raisins as I don't like them. They were simply fab!

very easy to make. i will make them again. didnt have a problem w/ them lasting the week though were better the first day. omitted veg shortening & salt & added 1 stick of regular butter instead.

Very good. Does not last, so eat the same day. I used a food processor to incorporate the chilled butter/shortening mixture, but afterwards hand stirred the wet ingredients.

I have made this scone about 50 times now. Every Easter I cater a brunch and this is one and the Maple Pecan Scone (on this site) are the ones everyone asks for. I also cater Teas and this one is a staple for our events. The only diviation I make is to use a food processor to mix. Great!

Easy and delicious as advertised. I used cranberries and lemon peel. A keeper for sure!

I made these scones for Christmas Eve. They were a hit before I even got them out of the house! My boyfriend loved them as did my friend, who's family has their own cookbook in print. I made them with craisins instead of currants and with a little more zest. I made enough for xmas day too where they were also loved. I can't wait to make them again. They are so easy!!

This recipe was good. The texture of the scone was perfect for my taste--slightly crunchy outside, and moist and buttery inside. I have tasted better scones, however (e.g. from Zingerman's in Michigan), and would love it if this scone tasted more buttery and also a little sweeter. I'd say that this recipe would make the perfect scones for eating with jam and clotted cream though.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! My wife and I threw a Jan 1 brunch for 3 dozen friends plus an additional 18 young children. I had never made scones before, so I loved how easy these were to make and how great they freeze. I ended up making about 80 (yes, EIGHTY) pieces, though I made mine smaller, a little bit more bit-size. I did this by separating the dough into three evenly sized balls before flattening and cutting into triangles. I highly suggest this, especially if you're hosting a party. One batch will make 2 dozen scones this way. Reheating frozen scones for 15 minutes at 300F as suggested in previous reviews is PERFECT. My wife had never met a scone she liked until she took the first bite from my first batch. Her eyes bulged out, her knees got weak, and I forget how many times she said "OMIGAWD...these are SO good. You HAVE to make them for the brunch!" My subsequent batches turned out even better. Wifey simply melted into a puddle of happiness with each batch. Oh, and I never did use currants. I used dried cranberries, blueberries, and dehyrdrated strawberries. They were all EXCELLENT! By my 3rd or 4th batch, I was ready to experiment a little more, so I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the dough. YUMMY!! To make it more festive and interesting-looking, I sprinkled red sugar on top instead of white. It looked very nice. I also tried brown sugar, but it was not very appealing...it just looked like the tops got burned although they didn't. Final suggestion...I like to spread a little bit of apricot or peach jam/jelly/preserve on top when they're warm.

Wonderful- buttery and tender. Not at all dry. I added a bit of vanilla and almond extracts to the buttermilk; the almond accentuates the orange zest perfectly. Fabulous recipe!

I added a bit more buttermilk than the recipe called for, and the scones had a wonderful biscuit-like flakiness. These are much better than similar recipes I had tried before.

This is the absolute, best scone recipe you will ever come across. The currants seem to just fall from the fork. It is so rich and dense, yet feathery and light. This truely is a dish beyond compare.

Yummy! These really did freeze beautifully and they reheat in a snap. I keep some in the freezer for quick reheating in a pinch (or when I feel lazy).

I make these often and freeze them -- reheating in a 300 degree oven for 15 minutes. I've also used "craisins" instead of currants. But for another taste, substitute lemon peel for the orange and dried blueberries for the currants.

If anyone else is looking for the recipe for orange currant scones from the Epicurious television show, this one is not it. There's another recipe on this site that is the exact recipe they prepared on the show. The show's web page just links to the wrong version of the recipe.

Since cooking can sometimes be a "use what you have in the house" proposition, I have substituted lemon peel for the orange peel and thanks to Ocean Spray, I have used their "Craisins" instead of currants. They look like raisins but are actually cranberry bits and the family just loves them!

These scones are top notch. My husband LOVES them. I took them to a church meeting and a 10 year old stood over the plate eating them saying, "what are these things!" He couldn't get enough. I'll be making them for an upcoming birthday tea party.

Sunday morning, hot coffee, hot scones and new oranges. What could be better? These are the lightest scones I've ever made. It's not my typical style but I did use my hands to mix the dough -- it may well have made a difference. The dough was quite sticky so required quite a bit of flour worked in during kneading process. Next time I'd chill for a bit before baking (as another orange currant scone recipe on this site specifies) for the did spread some, making them look a bit homely, if still delicious. I'd also try more orange peel, maybe even orange flavoring.

This is an excellent scone that is versatile as well as delicious. I've added different combinations of dried fruits such as blueberries, cranberries and apricots with excellent results. They also freeze well.

Delicious! They're a tender and flaky scone; quite rich. I would try them again with just 1 cup of chilled buttermilk.

Mistakenly added the 'plus 2 tablespoons of buttermilk' & the results were more cake-like than scone-like in that they're less dense & more moist. Very good recipe. Will make again.
