This was really delicious, quick and different for weeknight meal. I added a few drops of pepper oil because I like my tomato soup with a little bite to it. I used store bought garlic croutons, which worked very well. Also, maybe it was my pot but my eggs were overcooked waiting 8-10 minutes after adding them to the soup. I will shorten that time by half next time I make this. Yet, even with the eggs overcooked it was pretty darn good.

I added a bit more tomato juice and it was wonderful.

This recipe was one of the worst soups I have ever made. I turned out like pasta sauce instead of soup. It definitely needs a thinner. Once poured over the bread with the egg added in it was like a bowl of unappetizing mush!! Not worth the time.
