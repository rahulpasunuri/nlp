Easy and perfect as written! Garnished with strawberry and raspberry. In my make again file.

This was a good recipe but unbelievably sweet. I would definitely use less sugar next time. My cooking time was also longer - though I used vanilla extract, not a bean which might account for that.

These turned out perfectly! I was nervous to crack through the sugar for fear I'd find a mess underneath, but I was relieved to find beautiful, silky perfection all the way to the bottom. I used 4 larger ramekins so my bake time was a little longer.

This was wonderful! I made a few changes, based upon what I had in the house, and other recipes I'd read. First, for a half-recipe, I used 3/4 c. cream and 1/2 c. 1% milk. They were very rich and creamy. Second, I baked them until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center read 175; the custards were still quite jiggly but set up well in the fridge. Finally, after I broiled the turbinado sugar tops in my toaster oven for 5 minutes, I put the custards back in the fridge for 15 minutes before serving.

As a longtime cook and baker, as well as years as a seasonal employee with Williams-Sonoma, sanding sugar is a COARSER sugar, mostly used for topping on cookies and, in this case, Creme Brulee. It comes in several colors as well and is sold in gourmet shops, possibly your local grocer, and craft stores that carry baking products. That being said, regular sugar will work as well. Just be sure to sprinkle as evenly as possible, and a little heavier than you would with sanding sugar.

Sanding sugar is just baking sugar or super-fine sugar.
