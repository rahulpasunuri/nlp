This recipe is delicious,exceptionally easy and fast. I only did the pickle portion, however I used homemade horseradish, which gave it an extra kick and frozen fresh dill from last summer. I would forewarn others that (I am not sure if it was because I used the fresh/homemade horseradish) but the kick on these is increasing day by day in the fridge. However, they are still a great quick app/munchie!

I doubled the recipe and put the mixture in a big container in the fridge for several days, planning to divide them into individual holiday gifts, which I did. They are tangy and delicious and make a nice surprise for the person receiving a jar.

This crisp and lively pickle is a favorite of my frequent dinner guests. The pickles are good with many types of cheeses and go well with barbecue, fried chicken dinners, and for pot lucks. I make the pickles at least once a month.

The cucumbers in this dish come out so divine! I serve them as a side dish when doing an Asian inspired meal or enjoy them just as an afternoon snack by themselves.

My new favorite summer dinner! I used goat cheese and multigrain bread, the sweet n' sour pickles make for a fantastic lazily consumed meal to be picked at poolside.

The inclusion of horseradish and mustard provides a surprising taste without my expectation of a very hot and spicy mixture. The result is very delightful with a very mild hint of "hot" ingredients. I used regular cucumbers and removed the seeds by cutting lengthwise and spooning out the seeds. I then cut the cumcumbers in two inch lengths before cutting them to 1/8 inch-thick slices. I also substituted Star's Golden Balsamic vinegar for the cider vinegar.

These pickles are great! It's become a necessity now that I make them every week and we keep a whole batch in the fridge for snacking, very healthy and delicious. I use lots of horseradish and dry Coleman's for the mustard to make them really spicy.
