So easy to make. The flavor is not "exceptional", but "delicious", so I rated this 3 stars. But I definitely plan on making this again!

This is a keeper! I didn't use as much butter as recipe called for.

Fantastic!! The potatoes were amazing! I cooked them in a stoneware pan and they were really crispy, everyone loved them!!

Super fast and easy! Looks very fancy and gourmet. Oh yeah- and the taste.... awesome! This is a great side dish when you need to keep your stove top and hands free for other last minute parts of your meal. Also good that you can take out of the oven and cover with foil to free up the oven (if you only have one)for other things. Try this! You WON'T be dissapointed!
