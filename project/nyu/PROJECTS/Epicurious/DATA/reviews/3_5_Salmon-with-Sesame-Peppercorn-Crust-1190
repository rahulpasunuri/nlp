Like an other reviewer I use black and white seeds. Toast them first it does make a difference. I use half a salmon and the whole family likes a lot of it on the fish. We truly have a crust. Surprisingly there is no gritty texture. Just very tasty.

This was a good recipe but not as outstanding as others found on the site. Using the quantities of spices given the taste was not as flavorful as I usually like it but it was good.

This has quickly become one of our favourite fish recipes. I make it with arctic char rather than salmon, and use a hotter oven (400 degrees) for about 12 minutes.

Not very interesting. Many better baked salmon recipes - such as with the sundried tomato and olive crust w/breadcrumbs - this is delicious and tastes like a restaurant dish.

Wonderful dish for entertaining, and so easy. I've made it 2 or 3 times using fresh garlic and fresh dill (instead of the dried/ powdered mentioned in recipe) and it is great. Everyone who's tasted it at my house has asked for the recipe.

A great success! The combination of sesame seeds (and the kind I have are toasted) and the peppercorns was great! Butter was not necessary. The fish was moist and flaky and it looked great. Preparation was a snap, which is good since I am still somewhat new to cooking fish.

I didn't like this - maybe the sesame should be toasted first.

Tastey. Easy preparation. Salmon was moist. No changes are needed.

It was a success! I actually added more peppercorns to the mixture. Next time I may try toasted sesame seeds.

A great dish! Use a mixture of black and white sesame seeds and it is beautiful on the pink fish. I just put them straight in to the broiler without the butter for 7 minutes and they were perfect. Serve with some lemon risotto and steamed broccoli for a colorful, healthy dinner!

This was the first salmon dish I ever attempted by myself. And it was incredibly easy and tasted fabulous! It's a quick easy, dinner party dish too. The peppercorns give it a great zing and crunch.

It has been a challenge finding fish recipes that my husband will eat. This one was easy and got a big thumbs up.

When I make this dish I fry in a hot pan on top of stove. Use a little olive oil and butter together to fry. Fry on each side. An outragously delicious and easy dish. Great for pepper lovers!

This is a fabulous and different recipe for fish. I made it with a whole salmon and coated it with the above. Amazingly delicious!

The peppercorns added the perfect "kick" to this dish!
