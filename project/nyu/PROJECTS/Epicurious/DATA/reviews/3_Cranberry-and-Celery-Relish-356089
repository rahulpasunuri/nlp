The texture contrast of crunchy celery & almonds with the sweetened cranberries makes a nice dish.

Everyone loved this cranberry relish. It was super easy to make. The celery and toasted almonds were delicious with the cranberries. I will definitely be making this next Thanksgiving and was asked to make it this Christmas!

delicious. Loved the contrast between cooked cranberries and raw celery and toasted almond. Will repeat this next year.
