Believe the hype. This dish is AMAZING. I used refrigerated pie dough in my 9 inch tart and placed a few slices of provolone while it was cooling. I also let the tomatoes rest on paper towels to absorb some moisture and it help up well for hours. When I was putting it together, I wasn't sure it was going to work, it doesn't layer like say a lasagna, but it settles and looks like the picture.

Huge hit at dinner party last night. I added Prosciutto, my boyfriend said it made the dish, highly recommend adding it. I also did the provolone slices on the bottom as other reviewers suggested & baked the whole thing for like 5 min to warm up the cheeses

Loved it!!!! Followed the recipe to a tee and it was divine. I made the crust the day before and followed a previous reviewers suggestion by adding provolone cheese while it was still warm to seal the bottom. I took it out of the fridge the next day about an hour prior to layering and serving. Before laying the sliced tomatoes I put them on paper towels to absorb some of the liquid. Both the cheese and this step eliminated any sogginess. Served it on a bed of arugula with a drizzle of good quality EVOO and balsamic.The presentation was lovely and the taste was heavenly. This makes a nice, light summer meal when tomatoes are at their peak. Really great recipe.

Delicious. Absolutely delicious. We used prefab puff pastry, feta instead of mozzarella, and baked the whole thing for a few minutes to warm it through. Just an exceptional dish. Making again? Absolutely.

Mmmmm... I used the some of the last of Southern California's heirlooms with this. I, like some, baked the entire thing, served with a bed of arugula with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to cut the richness a bit. I'm DEFINITELY making this again!

Fantastic! Even without the basil. Thyme was an ok substitute.

I have made this recipe at least 15 times since I first saw it in Gourmet years ago. I have tweaked it over the years. To keep the crust from getting soggy too soon, I lay down a layer of very thinly sliced provolone cheese directly on the crust while it is still warm. The cheese will melt slightly and seal the crust. I also put in a layer of shaved procuitto de parma along with the mozzarella cheese and spice up the pesto with some additional garlic and parsley leaves. A nice drizzle of a fruity, extra virgin olive oil right before serving doesn't hurt either.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish and will probably make it again. I used the crust from the recipe and it was delicious, very flaky. As other reviewers indicated, the crust did get soggy soon after filling.

This was really great. Maybe the only better recipe I've found this summer for tomatoes is the outrageously good green tomato tart on notesfromjudieskitchen blog. She won two James Beard awards and it's obvious why!

What a hit! This is the perfect recipe for highlighting the exceptional flavor of heirloom tomatoes, particularly in their peak during summer. The crust was flaky and delicious and the parmesan and black pepper were a nice touch and the layers of tomatoes, pesto and mozzarella were not only beautiful but also delicious.

I accidentally made this with cake flour so the crust was very delicate and crumbled but it was very tasty. I wanted there to be more flavor to it, even though I used a lot of pesto. Perhaps goat cheese with herbs would have been a nice addition along with the mozzarella? Also might try to heat it as others did? It was good but needs something. Any suggestions?

I thought this was ok. My guests loved it. The pasty was quite nice. I would double the parmesan next time. It makes a lovely presentation for a buffet/appetizer table.

This is an amazing recipe. I'm not a huge fan of raw tomatoes, but I loved this. And it was a huge hit with guests. The pastry was very easy - I messed up everything you can mess up when making it (half-frozen butter, forgot the water, etc) and it was delicious. The crust and the pesto (store-bought from Trader Joe's...) worked very well together and were a perfect complement to the tomatoes. And I love mozzerella, so that was enjoyable! Next time I make it, I'll try as others suggested and cook it after filled for a bit. Oh, and I used at least double the amount of pesto. I could only find red tomatoes, and it was still delicious - this is going to be a staple for entertaining.

This is an exceptional dish. So easy to prepare and so impressive, from the way it looks to its explosive flavor. I had a tart pan so only did two layers, but that was plenty, it's rich. My only advice would be not to make it too far in advance. The juices from the tomatoes really make the crust soggy if it sits too long. Just be sure

Whoops, forgot to mention (in my review below) that I made this with the "Classic Pesto" from this site rather than the suggested recipe. And I used a lot more than a 1/2 cup.

Fabulous variation on the Italian insalata caprese, fresh, moist mozzarella is essential. Colorful heirlooms made a big difference, taste was spectacular. In a rush I used puff pastry for the crust, 'twas wonderful, our Romani friends raved about it. Grazie molto!

Okay, this was incredible. I absolutely adore heirloom tomatos so this was a recipe I HAD to try. I was not disappointed. The crust was perfect, not soggy at all, actually the perfect crisp. And the flavors were astounding! I did double the pesto, per suggestion. My husband ate half the tart all by himself!

This is a keeper. The flavors are great. My son's preschool does a fundraiser with the Philharmonic every year and we "pay" the musicians with a gourmet lunch. I made this last year and it really stood out. There were even recipe reqeusts!

I originally tried following the recipe, but found that everything got soggy and fell apart. Next time, I used goat cheese instead of mozzarella. A thick layer of goat cheese, followed by the pesto and then as many tomatoes as I could pile on. Not only was it delicious, the goat cheese was the perfect thing to keep the crust from getting soggy.

This was wonderful! I didn't roll out the dough, but instead just poured it into the tart pan and pressed it into place, and it worked just fine. I also skipped the pie weights and had no problem baking the crust on its own. Like another poster, I baked again for 10 minutes after filling and then broiled for 2-3 minutes, and the result was extremely yummy!

A real gourmet version of tomatoes, mozarella and basil, but worth every minute as long as you don't count the calories in the crust... I made this tart in a 4x13 rectangular tart pan and found that the "slices" held together much better than with a round tart pan. You need about 1.5 times the dough and a little more pesto to make two rectangular tarts. I needed to cook the tart shell an extra four minutes uncovered, but the parmesan and black pepper crust was yummy!! Do as another reader suggested and mound the tomatoes above the well above the rim. After the whole thing "settles" a bit, it makes a better presentation. I will try this next time in very small hors d'oeuvre tart shells as a one-biter.

This year I'm having a banner crop of heirloom tomatoes, so I decided to try this dish. Although I followed the ingredient list, with the addition of adding shredded parmesan cheese to the top, I changed the way the tart was cooked. I baked the uncovered crust for 10 minutes, then filled the tart as instructed. I returned the tart to the oven for 10 minutes at 375, then broiled the tart for 5 minutes to melt the parmesan cheese. My husband and I loved the result for a perfect weekend lunch.

What a spectacular summer entree this is! Really celebrates the glories of the perfectly ripe red, yellow, green, and orange heirloom tomatoes I found at the market today. The rich, buttery, crispy crust is a perfect foil to the slippery, cool tomatoes and the creamy mozzarella. As a former professional baker, my advice to those who suffered with a soggy crust is first to be sure you bake it thoroughly. We Americans are often hesitant to fully bake a crust to it's golden perfection. For me, at high altitude, it took several more minutes in the oven than the recipe called for. I assembled the tart shortly before serving, and it was not the least bit soggy. My dinner guest said she thought it was key to pile the tomatoes and mozzarella high above the rim of the crust, to achieve the perfect filling/crust balance.

This was a fabulous dish. I used heirloom tomatoes fresh from the farmer's market. Make sure to eat the whole tart the day it's made; otherwise the tomatoes are not nearly as good and the crust gets soggy. Make at least double the amount of pesto.

Actually, I think the tomatoes should be cut to 1/4 inch thick not 3/4. But I actually sliced them thinner.

Simply great! Very easy to prepare. At first I went sparingly on the pesto because I thought it would overshadow the nuance of the heirloom tomatoes, but I think the recipe is dead on. Follow it to a T... it's perfect.

Yum! Great flavors! I used refrigerated pie dough (cheating, I know!), fresh mozzarella and regular beefsteak tomatoes, as well as homemade pesto. I ended up baking the whole thing for about 10 minutes to melt the mozzarella, and put some grated parmesan on top. Yum!! I might add some egg custard next time to help everything solidify better. My only problem was that I didn't have nearly enough mozzarella...will double that next time.

Why do people feel the need to give a totally different recipe in what is supposed to be a review of the RECIPE THAT IS HERE!!! If I wanted an eggy quiche thing, I'd look for one. When I read a review of a recipe, I appreciate tips but I certainly don't need some self righteous know it all type trying to foist their own recipes on me! This recipe is wonderful as is. Making it a free form tart is fine, too, I've done that, but leave the tomatoes and pesto and cheese alone. Jeeze!

A wonderful recipe that really celebrates the summer. It's also beautiful when you use a variety of tomatoes. I made it in a pie dish, and just cut it like a pie.

I liked the above, but suggest you try making a freeform tart. The dough is easier and doesn't require blind baking. Use 1/2 lb unsalted cold butter, 2 cups flour, pinch salt and 1 egg mixed with 1/4 cup ice water. Pulse flour, butter, salt until it's about the size of peas then add the water/egg mix. Chill for about 30 minutes and then roll out into a circle. Sprinkle the bottom of the dough with about 1/4 cup parmesan and then layer sliced heirlooms (about 5 or 6) in consentric circles leaving about a 2" margin to the sides. Sprinkle about 6 oz fresh goat cheese on top of tomatoes and then fold the edges of the dough up around the tomatoes. Pinching the creases casually as you go (so it's leak proof). Then mix 1/2 cup half and half with one egg and carefully pour custard on top of tomatoes. Brush dough with egg wash and bake at 375-400D for about 45 minutes. Sprinkle chiffonade of fresh basil on top and serve.

I thought this turned out excellently and the flavors went together very well. Because of comments that others gave about the crust sometimes getting soggy, I put the baked crust back in the oven with a layer of cheese on top (before putting in the filling) and baked it for another few minutes to seal in the crust. The crust held together excellently with this trick.

A wonderful appetizer or lunch dish. For fast and easy I used a package pie crust mix(Betty Crocker) and added fresh black pepper and parmesan before adding the water and cooked the empty pie shell per directions on package. Now that Heirlooms are almost gone I tried it with red tomatoes and it was wonderful but of course not as beautiful.

I must agree with most of the reviews here. I made 2 tarts for a baby shower and they were a show stopper on the buffet. I had a little trouble with the crust--very difficult to transport. My friend said she used a store bought crust and it held up perfectly. (Not for the purists). I would also use more mozzarella than called for in the recipe. Thought the amount of pesto was fine.

This tart was exquisite. We ate it several times last summer and my husband, a personal chef has made it for clients.

I actually came on line specifically to find this recipe as I packed away all our magazines as we are moving.

This was a fabulous first course; and could easily be a nice, light lunch entree. I layered the tomatoes between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Think it really helped to eliminate soggy crust the next day that some reviewers experienced. Also drizzled a balsamic vinegar reduction over the top - Yum! Next time, for extra basil flavor, I'll intersperse basil leaves among the tomatoes. The combination of ingredients is as attractive as it is delicious!

One of my all-time favorite summer recipes. This is the second year I've made it with the heirloom tomatos we grow ourselves. Every single person who has tasted it raves and raves about it. I don't think I've ever served something that received so much praise. I like to use lard instead of shortening, it makes the crust taste better.

This tart is unique and delicious. I was especially pleased with the dough, which was crispy and light, as well as tasty. One caveat: because the tomatoes are juicy, the dough can hold well for only an hour or two at most, so assembly must really be done at the last minute.

This delicious dish is a must for summer patio suppers. I made it twice: once with the butter crust and the second time with my "never fail" regular shortening crust (but with the cheese and coarse ground black pepper added). Although both were wonderful, the shortening crust held up better the next day and made the perfect leftover.

Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. It was not incredable. My lunch guest seemed to like it, but I'm not sure if he was just being polite. Crust was OK. The heirloom tomatoes from the Farmers Mkt were outstanding. If I make this again, I would be sure to use better grade fresh buffalo mozzerella, and toast the pine nuts when making the pesto.

The best! The crust was a fabulous addition to a perfect combination of flavors. It looked beautiful too. I just wonder how many times I can make it while the heirloom tomatoes are available! (Note to people who've had trouble with the crust: To avoid crumbly crust, make sure to use enough water to keep the dough together.)

We made this recipe for a picnic to Ravinia (Chicago/music). The crust was great! We made it two-ish hour prior to the actual eating and it held up well. We only did yellow and red tomatoes though vine-ripened. We would do more pesto next time. Also we would make it half as thick. Our fifteen guests raved over it.

I have to go against the crowd on this one. I made the tart for a summer picnic and of course had the hassle of assembling the tart at the site to avoid a soggy crust. When I got everything in place, the tart was good but certainly not spectacular. I guess I like ingredients that combine to make a really unexpected flavor; I thought this was predictable. Anyhow, we saved more than half of the tart and looked forward to having a snack the next day. Yuck. Everything was vapid and unappealing.

Yummy! This tart was both beautiful and delicious. It really looked as pretty as the picture in the magazine! It was also very easy, especially if you have any experience making a pie crust. Don't fill it ahead of time, as the crust will get soggy. Next time I'll add parmesan to the pesto. The leftovers, minus the crust, made a wonderful omelet the next day.
