45 minutes? I just made a 10-minute version that blew my mind. Nuked the beans in a few inches of salted water for 3 minutes. Sauteed garlic, beans and peanuts (whacked in the mortar & pestle for a few secs--why dirty the food processor?) in olive oil, added soy sauce, a few shakes of my friend's homemade green chili sauce, and a squeeze of lime--OMG, fantastic. Served with a piece of salmon that took the same amount of time--yum!

I replaced the Soy sauce with Black Bean paste and added coarsely ground Szechuan Pepper instead of Chili. I did NOT add any extra salt, though, as Soy paste has enough of it! A perfect summery dish.

I had not tried long beans and found red ones at the farmers market today, so I needed a recipe quick! I did not add the salt, as I felt the soy sauce would be salty enough, and I was right. Next time I will use a spicier chile, I used an immature Rocoto from my garden. Definitely do not par boil or pre-cook the green beans if you like any texture at all. I sauteed them on high for 4 minutes or so and they were in danger of getting too soft. Those of the generation of canned green beans and soft veggies should go ahead, but most others will not care for the softness. Last change, cooking garlic on high for a long time makes it bitter, so I added it at the end to cook for one minute, and only used a teaspoon. This made maybe a cup and half or so. It was enough for a main dish for one person,in my opinion, or a side for two people. I prefer a large proportion of my meal to be vegetable.

I expected to love this recipe, because I like long beans, I like spicy, and I like peanuts. However, I was not impressed. As written, very bland for some reason ( I used 2 peppers, and was generous with the garlic). I ended up adding fish sauce and some dried shrimp at the end, which made it pretty good.

Keeping beans uncut for initial steaming will reduce sogginess. If you don't have shallots on hand, saute some onion with the garlic or finish with chopped green onions.

don't bother pre-boiling, my mom used to make this all the time in her Filipino recipies. I like cooked yet firm veggies. I cut the beans about an inch and a half, 3/4 according to the recipe seemed too small and I was glad I did. Although I had to substitute peanut oil and just used pre-dried chopped garlic and substituted those tiny green limes you find in Asian markets, this is a real winner. I will definitely make it again. A refreshing and yet hearty meal that doesn't slow you down.

This was tasty, but a lot of work for the end result. I agree with other reviewers that the beans were a bit soggy. I would have preferred crispier beans. I also expected it to taste more peanutty and flavorful. It was very spicy, probably even more so b/c I used large-ish chilies. This was my first time growing and eating long beans and I'm not sure I'm a big fan. I ended up adding additional soy sauce.

This recipe was great! These long beans were so tasty, and perfectly flavored. I only had 1.5 oz of peanuts, so I substituted the rest with roasted/unsalted cashews. Mmm, so tasty!

Really good beans! I used regular green beans and they turned out great. Just a good simple recipe. I sauteed the shallots with the garlic and cooked the beans for less time so they were still a little crispy. Delicious! Thanks.

Spicy and really good! Next time I will probably cook the beans for less time as they came out a big soggy. And maybe just 1 chili as I was sweating eating this. Comparable to restaurant quality. Loved finding a great recipe for long beans which are so prevelant here in the summer.

I loved this recipe. I do eat meat but it's nice to find a vegetarian meal to make now and again too. I made is exactly as written. I agree the long beans are heartier than regular ones. The recipe is simple but the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. Fabulous over Asian noodles.

I used walnuts, but I think it would be better with the peanuts called for in the original.
