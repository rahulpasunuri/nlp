Well, I suppose everyone's tolerance for fussy work in the kitchen varies--I found the roasting and peeling to be a little time-consuming, but not horrible...I have to bone 12 quail tonight and I can assure you that that is much more annoying! When the chestnuts were hot, the peel just came off with the shell quite easily. In the future I would turn the oven off once the roasting was over an take them out maybe 5 at a time so as to keep the remainder hot. I used a dry dishtowel to hold the nuts while removing the shell.

Maybe it's just me, but these seem underdone and bland. I may not have blanched them long enough in the boiling water afterwards, but I just returned them to the oven for a little more time. They did look very white and clean, though.

Thank you again for another great tip! We roast five lbs. each year for our over 100 yr. old stuffing recipe and this is the definitve way to get perfect clean roasted chestnuts. I baked small batches for twenty minutes and boiled for three. A chestnut knife is also a great help.
