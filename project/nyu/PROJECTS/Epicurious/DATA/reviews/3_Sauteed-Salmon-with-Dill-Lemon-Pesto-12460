I followed the directions in a seasoned black skillet and spooned over a sauce without the breadcrumbs but the the other ingredients. A very nice meal with potatoes, carrots and snap peas steamed and mixed together.

I made this recipe last night for dinner (in July). I decided to "summer" it up a bit by grilling the salmon. After I made the pesto, I thought it was a little too strong for my taste, so I mixed it with lite sour cream and some lemon juice. I served it with garlic couscous, grilled zuccini, and a chilled bottle of chardonnay. It made a nice, lite, easy summer meal. It didn't take long at all. It was nothing really special, though. I don't think that I will make it again unless I have all of the ingredients already in the fridge, and I'm in a pinch.

Very good and quick. Do not be afraid to substitute one of the prepared pestos if you are in a hurry. Hint: I think the salmon does not need quite as much cooking time. I served it with asparagus and a rice pilaf.
