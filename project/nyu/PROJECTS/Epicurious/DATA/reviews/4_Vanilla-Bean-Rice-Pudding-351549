Wonderful! Perfect winter comfort food. Used 4 cups of 2% milk instead of the whole milk & whipping cream and I thought it was delicious. Obviously, the whipping cream would be great, but this way, it's sooo much healthier. Also cut the sugar in half as suggested below. Was tempted to use the whole vanilla bean, but half was plenty.

Great basic recipe that is easy to modify with your desired mix of spices and other flavorings. I didn't have any vanilla bean on hand so used a healthy dose of vanilla extract. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and currants.

Delicious! I used vanilla bean paste instead of a vanilla bean, and it worked perfectly.

will be making this again tonight and can not wait. Will add cinnamon to it while it cooks. Love the idea below about adding coconut milk. Wish i had some on hand!

i used all 2% milk and half the sugar and it was fantastic!

this is so delicious with about half the sugar, and it tastes even better after it's been setting up for a few days in the fridge!

Very good, though I'll likely dial back a bit on the sugar and vanilla next time. Flavor was just a LITTLE too strong.

Easy and perfect rice pudding. I used exact ingredients and simmered it a little longer to make it extra thick and creamy. I'm enjoying it hot on a very cold day.

Probably the best rice pudding I've ever had. It comes out creamy and full of vanilla flavor. A real beautiful end to any meal. Make sure and cook it the full 35 minutes which gives the basmati time to get soft and tender. You can also sub 1/4 cup of coconut milk for an amazing flavor.

I am so glad it is getting cooler out; a better reason to make this exceptional and EASY rice pudding again. I have made it 4 times without changing a thing (oh I add grated nutmeg to the serving bowls)

I thought the flavor was excellent but had a hard time achieving the rich and creamy texture that others have described. I didn't stray from the recipe, yet still found the pudding to be runny by the end of the cooking time. I let it cook about 15 minutes longer, but ultimately the pudding was still too thin. Next time I may try arborio rice or use 1/2 cup less milk.

Yummy and very easy to make ! We loved it and the kids loved it. I used less milk (3 cups) because we wanted a thicker pudding and it turned out the thickness of a rich yogurt - perfect for us.

Making this recipie was the first time I have ever liked rice pudding. It was a hit with everyone! The directions were easy to follow and it was simple to make. I followed the other reviews and added a little less sugar and the result was perfect. Thanks for the advice!

Heavenly I made this for a friend who is recuperating from surgery. It is one of the most delicious desserts ever. I agree that next time I would cut back on the sugar, but just fabulous.

Yuuum! The vanilla bean added SO much flavor. I know this sounds like sacrilege, but I used 2% milk and fat free half and half (from Trader Joe's), and it was amazingly creamy & rich. I'm sure it would be even better with whipping cream, but why try it if I love the healthier version? ;) I am making it again right now, and might add a little less sugar, as it was pretty sweet.

I made this and thought it was delicious. I used a mix of skim milk and half&half because I didn't have any whole milk. I was worried that the vanilla bean wouldn't provide much flavor, but it really did. I added raisins when the milk was added, and it was great.

This recipe is good,but nothing I have ever made is as good as the rice puddings in NY Diners.They bye far have the best rice puddings i've ever tasted. Iv'e been on a quest for the past year to make one as good. I know they bake them,but that's all I know. Does any one know the secret of the Diners?

Don't throw away the vanilla bean! Allow it to dry and stick it in your sugar jar for vanilla sugar.

I love rice pudding, this is one of the best I've had. I threw a cinnamon stick in at the beginning (also used 1.5 cups 1% milk and 1.5 cups whole because I ran out of whole milk, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly). There is definitely a sweetness to it; I might use a little less sugar next time, but the recipe is fantastic and very easy to make.

I would not make this recipe again. It was just OK--I like the coconut rice pudding recipe on this website better. Too sweet as well, I would reduce the amaount of sugar.

If you love rice pudding, make this unbelievably easy and heavily recipe. Like Molly, my father loved rice pudding and so did I and we would always order it at the Greek restaurant in the produce market. Years later when I got married, my Greek mother-in-law would make it for us and my father was so happy. My kids grew up on it and loved it but I never made it until I found this recipe. Everyone agreed that it was just like Yiayia's. Don't change the recipe AT ALL, as far as the cream goes. I didn't have a vanilla bean and used vanilla extract and I used Uncle Ben's Rice. I really wanted to make it again the next day but I don't want to get everyone too tired of it.

I made this on a whim on Saturday night. It was simple and so tasty! We loved it. The vanilla bean gave the pudding such flavor. Fantastic! A new favorite.

The toastier flavors by cooking the rice in water first were quite interesting. I did use arborio rather than bismati rice and was compelled by those around me to use a mix of skim and 2% along with the cream. Still delicious! Did take a bit longer to reach the creamy state, however. Was also good with some ground ginger & nutmeg added in to the mix with some dried cherries.
