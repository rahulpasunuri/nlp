We made this recipe, as well as the Herb Roasted Turkey, last year in 2010 for family Thanksgiving. I'm reviewing this one now that I'm back for the OTHER recipe in 2011. This recipe took a lot of work and delivered little pleasure. We had leftovers of this turkey for days, whereas as the Herb Roasted Balsamic Turkey disappeared that very night!

This was weak. Next to the balsamic turkey recipe, no one wanted to eat this!

Very moist. Not difficult to make at all if you follow the directions properly. It was delicious

I have used variations on this recipe for years with wonderful results. The gravy is the one thing I always use no matter what else I change. I leave out the corriander though, and I like it better without it. My kids would drink the gravy straight if they could!

This made the best gravy my family had ever tasted! I don't think they will allow me to make any other kind again!

I made this recently using a 10 lb. frozen kosher turkey. I cooked it for 3 hours and it was just right, the only objection I have is that I found the coriander flavor in the rub to not mesh well with the rest of the flavors (stuffing, mashed potatoes). I thought the gravy was outstanding, though.

Our family has used this recipe every Thanksgiving since it first appeared in Nov. 2001. It is fabulous

Very sweet, and the coriander made for an odd taste with the maple etc. The syrup caused the turkey to brown VERY quickly, it was nip and tuck whether the skin would burn before the inside was cooked. I found the broth cooked away every time I added it to the pan, which was basically full of blackened vegetables and giblets; I wound up just basting it every 20 minutes with broth, and deglazing with another cup of broth, to which I added more broth to make the 4.5 cups called for by the recipe. I used the sausage-cornbread stuffing recipe, which made it seem even sweeter. Not bad, all told, but nothing I'd repeat, either.

My family and friends have had this turkey 2 years in a row an dnow they won't let me switch! I substiture Cognac for madiera and use bullion cubes instead of canned broth, and i use roux to make the gravy base but other than that this recipie actually requires no chnages and is a big hit in my house... there are never any leftovers!

Nice recipe, the turkey was moist & tender. As someone suggested, try dry Madeira wine - and add more of it, about 1/2 cup. The maple coriander butter might work on roast chicken, too.

The turkey itself was very good; the maple butter really helped the skin as well as basting the breast well. Boiling down the maple syrup can be a challenge, as it will boil over quite easily. I've seen a similar recipe on this site that boils down the syrup with some apple cider, which I expect would work much better. The gravy, however, is just too sweet. It probably doesn't help that there are two kinds of Madeira wine, and I had only sweet Madeira -- and tasting the gravy before adding the Madeira I knew that adding sweet Madeira would be a mistake. I tried to compensate with a dry sherry instead, but still: too sweet. Next year, I'll keep the maple butter on the turkey and just use a regular roux for the gravy.

Tasted good, and easy to make. Probably won't make again, since there are (1) a number of other turkey recipes we like better, and (2) other turkey recipes I'd like to try.

The combination of maple, marjoram, coriander, and lemon peel makes for a superb and sophisticated gravy. I followed the recipe and obtained a perfectly glazed turkey. It is well worth preparing the maple butter the day before to cut down on chores the day you cook the turkey. Definitely a keeper.

I made this two years ago and it was the first time I really enjoyed turkey! Everyone loved it from my kids to my older guests. This year I spent a day going through new recipes and decided nothing sounded as good as this was so I'm making it again - this time with a free-range organic turkey.

We've used this recipe several times since 2001 and it has turned out wonderful. Even folks who didn't like turkey loved this one...

I, too, have made this turkey for the past two years and will make it again this year. Both times I have grilled the turkey and its turned out great. The turkey and gravy go well with Mama Stamberg's cranberry relish, which can be found at http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2000/jan/001110.cranberry.html.

I have made this recipe for the past two years. Today I am printing a new copy for this year and I just had to add my review. This is the most delicious turkey recipe I have ever found and it will be the only one I use from now on. The gravy is out of this world!

We made this recipe for a Thanksgiving dinner at our home. We had a lot of guests that day, and everyone loved it. Many said it was the best turkey they had ever had and we couldn't agree more. Definately worth the trouble. Gravy is delightfully different than the traditional but compliments the turkey wonderfully.

I've made this turkey and gravy recipe two years in a row now, and it has received rave reviews each time. I'm someone who can never seem to make decent gravy, but I can make this gravy and people LOVE it! This will definitely be on my regular recipe list.

This is truly delicious. I, too, was making my first turkey last year, and now I am confidently making it again for Christmas. I'm thinking of adding some crushed garlic into the maple butter... Question: can anyone recommend a good cornbread stuffing recipe to go with this? I've been thinking of the corn bread, dried apple, chestnut recipe on this site. Any suggestions? Thanks and happy holidays.

I am so glad to have found this recipe again! Thought I lost it. Made it last year for Thanksgiving (my first as the cook) and everyone absolutely loved it! Making it again for Christmas this year. Only down side to this recipe is if you ever serve it, you'll end up being responsible for cooking Thanksgiving dinner again and again every year!

This turkey is the best I've ever had and I can't wait to make it again. The only thing I did differently was to substitute margarine for the butter, plus I kept having to add water to my roasting pan as the vegetables were threatening to burn. An outstanding recipe--easy, too.

I made this last Thanksgiving and did a breast of turkey the same way for Easter. My entire family just RAVES about it. My duaghter is doing it again for this Thanksgiving and we all can't wait!

The turkey recipe was absolutely wonderful. My fiancee' made this for his first Christmas dinner and everyone was amazed. He added a special touch to the maple butter - peach schnapps, which gave it a great flavor. The dijon gravy was a little bit too sweet. Although his grandfather loved it. I guess it depends on the individual's taste. Overall, great recipe!

Awesome gravy! The turkey recipe has a few more steps than I would like, making for more micro-management, but the flavors do come through quite nicely. As I said before, the gravy really meks this dish shine!

My very first turkey- turned out great: moist, full of flavor, and the gravy was great, even without the giblets, which I accidently threw out. Everyone liked this and I would definitely make it again.

Superb! We've done turkey many different ways, and found this recipe the most satisfying synthesis of traditional and gourmet ingredients and tastes. Fairly easy to prepare, as well!

This turkey recipe was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it and the gravy. I used dried herbs instead of fresh, omitted the coriander seeds, and used red cooking wine instead of Madeira, and people still loved it.

The best turkey I ever made! Even my husband, who's not a turkey lover, ate everything on his plate. I brined my bird first using the recipe for the Honey brined turkey from this sight and substituted maple syrup for the honey. The bird was perfectly roasted. I also substituted port for the madiera and added extra dijon, marjoram and thyme. I made the gravy ahead of time, then added the pan juices just before serving. This is the only way I'll do my turkey from now on.

Loved this recipe. The turkey came out a beautiful golden brown and the flavors were fantastic. Great gravy too!

Wonderful!! Maybe the best turkey recipe I've used. The majoram makes the house smell so good. Everyone was pleased. I couldn't find fresh and used dried with good results. The gravy was very good too.

I hosted Thanksgiving for the first time this year and was really nervous about the turkey--this recipe totally saved me! Everyone raved (my sister is still talking about it!). And, the gravy is to die for--I definately recommend!

I think that the coriander gave the bird and the gravy a nice boost. The Maple added a bit of sweetness but it was by no means overpowering. My family had an enormous bird so we just doubled the maple butter and gravy recipies with no trouble. If anything I'd recommend making extra maple butter just in case you need it. Everyone enjoyed the turkey but the gravy got huge raves from everyone.

Everyone loved this turkey! This was the first turkey I ever made, so I was a little nervous. But I had nothing to worry about! This was the most moist turkey I have ever tasted, and it was pretty simple to prepare.

Great recipe. The gravy couldn't be better (use only one Tbs. of mustard) and is a bit sweet. Also used slightly less coriander seeds. The turkey was beautiful and very tasty.

I made this Turkey for the first time when I was having my first Christmas with my new in-laws. It was wonderful! Everyone loved it and have demanded I make it every year. The turkey was moist and had a wonderful taste to it. I truly advise others to try this recipe. You can't go wrong..

This was a very good recipe though I wasn't crazy about the coriander seeds in the maple butter. It yielded a moist and tasty bird and my guests couldn't stop eating it. The gravy was excellent! I didn't have Madiera so I just left it out.

This was fantastic! I did a test run on this recipe for this Thanksgiving and the sauce for the turkey was to die for! Definitely use all the mustard, don't skimp, it improves the taste so much. My turkey was moist and delicious and I am looking forward to having it again for Thanksgiving, a real keeper! I had leftover butter mixture so I froze it and will keep for next time. I can't wait to impress my guests with this gourmet tasting turkey!
