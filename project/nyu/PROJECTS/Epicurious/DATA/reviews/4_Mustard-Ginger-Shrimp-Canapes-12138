Agree with commentator from Chicago. Skip the pita, and simply thread shrimp and sweet pepper on toothpicks. These were a big hit at a corporate function I catered. A bit different, but really tasty.

Not bad, but not as good as Lime Coriander shrimp, also on this site. I made this as one of four hors d'oeuvres for 12 people, and I had tons left over (not that leftover shrimp is such a bad thing!).

I have made this several times. After the first time I decided I loved the shrimp and peppers but thought it was a bit lost on the pita. So, since then I have cut the peppers in 3/4 inch squares and sandwiched each shrimp between two pepper squares on a toothpick. I always get rave reviews.

I have made this for several parties and one bridal shower. The canapes are always a big hit! One change I made for the bridal shower was that I used mini-pitas (cut in half, split to form a pocket) instead, to make the assembly even faster and the appetizer even more manageable. They were a great complement to the traditional tea sandwiches also served at the shower.

i love hors d'oeuvres and this is so refreshing and tasty. most can be prepared in advance and assembled at the last minute. I make this a lot - everyone loves it and it looks so pretty when arranged on a tray. try it - you'll love it too!
