This is just ok. You'd think with all those spices that it would be more interesting. My husband put hot sauce on his and said that made it better.

This was tasteless like the Minneapolis cook said. We didn't waste the shrimp on this dish. Worst thing I've had on this website so far. Verrry disappointing. BLEH.

"Five spice" is misleading. This was completely tasteless, and I added far more chili powder. The other spices don't meld well in this dish, and the "sauce" became more of a gummy paste coating the shrimp. If you are looking for Indian food, look elsewhere.

I agree with the last reviewer that this is a great little quickie weeknight meal. I sauteed the onions, garlic and ginger together and then added the spices to the pan and let them get real aromatic before adding the tomatoes. Great with snow peas over rice. If you like heat, pump up the chili powder -- 1/8 t just barely made a dent.

Awesome. A good, fast meal. TONS of flavor. The amount of spice you add seems like something you can do to taste, dependent upon your own preference. The next time I make it, I would like to replace some of the shrimp with scallops, mussels, or squid. And add even more flavor.

Excellent recipe, just like my mother's. However it can be improved a little. Putting the cumin (actual cumin seeds are best) directly into the hot oil before adding onions so they pop and release a nice aroma and flavor. To improve texture, you can also grind the onions with the ginger and garlic paste. Yum! Try this.
