Quick, easy and delicious recipe. I used orange extract instead of almond since I had it on hand, and it turned out great.

Easy to make, a certain crowd pleaser, and reasonably low in calories.

This was easy to make and had a wonderful fresh flavor of cherries and vanilla. I couldn't get mine to form nice round scoops like the ones shown in the photo, but maybe I needed to let it soften a bit.
