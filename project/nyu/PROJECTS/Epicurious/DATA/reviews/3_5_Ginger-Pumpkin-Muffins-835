Very light texture but I only had dark molasses so the flavor was more molasses than pumpkin. Next time will try light molasses. I mixed all of the ginger into the muffin, don't think they need a topping.

I only had Mixed Dried Fruit on hand instead of the raisins. These were great. Even 2 year old loved them. The extras froze well. The recipe made 12 muffins and 6 mini loaves. I will definitely make them again.

I made a few changes that were suggested earlier in the reviews, like adding more pumpkin and a streusel topping. I found these to be a lot of work but very moist and delicious. I would recommend making a double batch and freezing some since they took so long to make.

I made a few changs to the receipe, some because of personal taste and some b/c what I had in my kitchen. :) I used wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. I also used 1, 15 oz of pumpkin puree. I also used Agave nectur in place of molasses, but only used 1/4 cup. I also used half & half in place of buttermilk b/c I did not have it. I think they are really good and moist, the raisins and ginger pieces are great little bursts of flavor.

Change the name to Molasses Muffins because that's all you taste. Agree - these are labor intensive and NOT worth the effort.

Rating: 2
These were pretty labor intensive for how mediocre they are. They taste like a basic spice muffin, only with more ginger. Can't even tell there is pumpkin in them. I didn't have raisins or currants, so I used dried cranberries - wish I had left them out all together, as they were tough. Also, I only had dark molasses, so I used half honey/ half dark molasses where the recipe called for light molasses. I liked the crystallized ginger - if you like ginger, you won't go wrong by adding more than the recipe calls for.

These were fine, but more work than necessary. I'll go with my simpler pumpkin bread recipe and add crystalized ginger.

Wonderful muffins, but no one mentioned how many more the recipe makes. I doubled the recipe and got 36 muffins + a loaf. I also would change the topping to more of a strusel (i.e. add flour, butter..). Otherwise perfect!

I used a little extra crystallized ginger and added minced dried cranberries too. Had no brandy then forgot to soak them in something else but they were tender anyway in the final muffin. Also used the whole can of pumpkin. I didn't have light molasses and yes, it overpowered the pumpkin. Couldn't taste the pumpkin at all. They were yummy and I'd like to try them again with light molasses or other light sweetener.

I would have given this 4 forks but if you follow the recipe exactly then they will be a bit bland. I used 3 cups of pumpkin; fresh, minced ginger instead of dried ginger and honey instead of molasses. My friends and I love them.

This was a fabulous pumpkin muffin base - sweet and spicy. I didn't use the dried fruit, but instead made a streusel of melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. I topped each muffin with a tablespoon each and baked for the suggested time - delicious!

Would be 4 forks if it wasn't for the hard outside (the rest of the muffin was delightful). i will try them at a lower temp next time.

My husband and I loved this - but we love ginger! I made quite a few adjustments - partially because I didn't read the directions and partially because I wanted to use what was on hand. They turned out amazing, however. Here's what I did: 1. Reduced flour to 1.25 cups sifted white flour 2. Added 1 cup of all bran cereal 3. Used whole can of pumpkin 4. Used 3 whole eggs instead of 1 whole, 2 whites 5. Used .5 cups of sour cream in place of buttermilk 6. Used .25 cups of dark molasses instead of .5 cups light 7. Threw the minced candied ginger and brandy right into the mix (used Calvados Apple brandy) 8. Just used .5 cups of light brown sugar - it was plenty sweet. 9. Used only 1 tsp of baking soda (high altitude baking) Next time, I will add in chopped pecans. Enjoy!

My husband usually hates ginger (says it tastes like soap). Well he loved these muffuns. I say no more.

Rating: 3
This was a big hit with most friends, but a bit too spicy for some. I loved it and will definitely make it again. To simplify the recipe, I used skim milk instead of buttermilk because that's what was on hand and used whole eggs rather than just the whites to make up the richness.

I loved how much you could taste the ginger.

I love pumpkin muffins so I gave this recipe a try. My recommendation is to try another recipe. The molasses is overwhelming and cancelled out any pumpkin flavor. The recipe should be retitled 'Ginger Molasses Muffins'. However, the texture was good hence the one fork rating.

These were so good and I agree with the reviewers who made comments about the "kitchen aroma". These would be great to make when you are selling your house! I was looking for a pumpkin recipe for muffins that only used 1 egg (all I had). I got started and then noticed the 2 egg whites...but went ahead anyway just using the 1 bowl method....first wet ingred, then dry. I did take most everyones suggestion and use an additional cup of pumpkin, but being a ginger lover, I didn't reduce the ginger. Also, I didn't have buttermilk so used 2% milk and added lemon juice. I believe in trying the recipes as written, so will do with the egg whites, but just wanted to say they are light and delicious as they even without.

A great muffin for a cold fall morning! The thing you want to think about is this: do you like fruitcake? The answer will help you decide whether to use the crystalized ginger and even the raisins or not. These ingredients make the muffin a bit reminiscent of that controversial Christmas time "treat." I probably would not use the ginger pieces again because I didn't care for the texture although I like it in gingersnap cookies. BUT it didn't harbor my or anyone else's enjoyment of the muffins. I would next time substitute with walnuts or pecans. I also used cranberries instead of raisins. Didn't have brandy, so added a little extra vanilla with a dash of water to the dried fruits. Also found my special molasses missing and had to use honey. It turned out just great though I would have preferred to try the molasses. Like everyone else, experiment! You won't go wrong but do be sure to use the whole can of pumpkin and perhaps add extra cinnamon.

A lot of work for a so-so muffin.

As per other suggestions I added more pumpkin puree and less ginger, I found the consistancy wonderful, light and fluffy muffin but with a good chewy bite with a flavourful ginger snap/pumpkin taste.

Rating: 4
The first time I made them, I didn't have any crystallized ginger, but it turned out good so I made them again and that time added it and used raisens instead of currents. I had added extra pumpkin as many had suggested (two cups) and cut back on the ginger, but I think next time, I'm adding all the ginger. I had never used crytallized ginger before and found I really liked it.

Deliciously gingerbread-y! I would even add more crystallized ginger in the recipe.

Not too good. Maybe I missed something, but this recipe lacked taste. I even added extra pumkin like the people before recommended.

Rating: 3
I thought these muffins were tasty! I took previous comments (thank you) and wanted to add extra pumpkin, but was out. I added one banana instead and cut back slightly on the crystallized ginger. I am not a fan of raisins, so I added chopped pecans and that worked great too.

I took the advice of bumping up the pumpkin to two cups and cutting back on the ginger. To the cook who posted that, thanks. Delicious! hands down. Very moist, extremely tasty but not "heavy." Will definitely make these again.

These are delicious! I followed the previous review and increased the pumpkin puree, and replaced the raisins with dried cranberries. For reveiwer Skyye Steele - you're kidding, right? Try a recipe for Carrot Cake Muffins instead if that is what you're craving. We are all tasters for epicurious, that's the whole point, it's all about the food . . .

After reading the previous reviews and suggestions, I think I hit the nail on the head. I bumped the pumpkin up to 2 cups puree, and bumped the crystallized ginger down to 4 tablespoons. Also, instead of pumpkin pie spice, I just added 1/2 tbl. of nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves to make it even spicier. It turned out well, and everybody that tried them really enjoyed them.

Awesome. Yes, they're like dessert, but fairly healthy. Even my husband, who only likes a full-fat unhealthy muffin raved about these. I add more pumpkin than it calls for with no ill effects.

Made these recipe for my companion, and he only ate them because he had nothing else to eat. This is the first time he has told me he wouldn't like me to make something again. these muffins did not have any pumpkin flavor, they were very bland. not worth the time and effort. I am a very talented cook (just ask my companion), so when i say it is a bad recipe, it is a bad recipe. I think I should be a tester for bon appetit and they might learn something from me and would end up with much better, more gourmet type recipes. I'd take out the pumpkin in this recipe, leave out the currants and brandy and replace them with shredded carrots. this needs a frosting, perhaps cream cheese. ... maybe epicurious could alter the recipe and post it with the improvements i've suggested.

This was just way too gingery for us. The crystallized ginger in the muffins AND on top overpowered the recipe. Also, the baking time was way off for our oven. At 20 minutes, they were already slightly burned. I liked the idea of pumpkin muffins but this is not the recipe I'm looking for.

Not enough pumpkin flavor! Tasted like... well, autumn; but not pumpkin.

Amazing muffins - the raisins and crystillized ginger make them really terrific. More gingery than pumpkin. I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. These were so good people ate them as a dessert.

Rating: 3
I took several liberties with this recipe because of what I had on hand. I used 2 1/2 ts. cinnamon and scant 1/2 ts. cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice, 2 eggs because I didn't feel like separating eggs and having leftovers, and peach yogurt instead of buttermilk. I also sprayed the muffin tin, and used the standard dry-into-wet ingredients muffin method. They still turned out very well, very moist. The recipe filled the muffin cups generously.

Very good; I didn't make the topping - ran out of crystallized ginger. As with most spice breads, this one stays moist for days. I actually ended up with 24 muffins. Freezes very well.

Made the muffins for Thanksgiving morning. The house smelled wonderful. The muffins do taste more like gingerbread than pumpkin. I substituted dried cranberies for the raisins.

I didn't feel like getting out the mixer, so made these with the standard muffin technique (mix wet ingredients and then add dry ingredients) and these turned out great! Kids preferred the muffins without the candied ginger, but they were all devoured in no time flat!

Very yummy. Unlike many muffins, actually tastes better the next day if stored in a tupperware.

Rating: 3
Very tasty--a lot like gingerbread. That's what I told my kids it was because they'd never touch it if I mentioned it had pumpkin it it! I actually used canned squash because that's all I had on hand and perhaps that resulted in a milder flavor. I didn't bother with the topping either, just folded all the crystallized ginger in with the currants.

These muffins will wake up your taste buds. The ginger provides intense contrast to the pumpkin flavor. I substituted semi-frozen cranberries for the raisins, and chopped them in the blender with the crystalized ginger. To avoid using more than one bowl, I mixed the eggs and brown sugar as directed, then all of the remaining wet ingredients, and lastly stirred in the dry ingredients. I was happy with the results.

I have experimented with many recipes for pumpkin muffins and bread and most of the time, I'm disappointed with the result...too dense and rubbery. This recipe is delicious! The muffins were light and the crystalized ginger is a wonderful addition. This recipe is worth making just too have the wonderful aroma while baking.

A great, healthy treat. The crystallized ginger is what makes the recipe.
