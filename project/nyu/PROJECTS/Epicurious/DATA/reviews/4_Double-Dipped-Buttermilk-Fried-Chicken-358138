My only comment is the cooking tempature needs only to be 165 degrees and the holding temp between 140-150 degrees. You'll find the chicken to be moister.

A suggestion for those that found it lacked flavor - add garlic chunks to your marinade snd/or the onion as someone else suggested

This recipe was such a hit I'm making it again and I only made it a week ago! I agree with previous reviews, the flour dredge needs doubling and a little extra spice, but other than that it was awesome! I used crisco to fry in and just like the old school tv ads, most all of the grease went back in the can! To the woman who had burnt outside and raw inside, your oil was too hot, try it again.

My goodness, this is a fabulous recipe. I always start at least a day before I plan to serve so the chicken can marinate overnight- the flavor is unparalleled if you have the time for it. The only thing I change about the recipe is to put chunks of onion in the buttermilk marinade, and chunks of onion in the frying oil prior to frying the chicken [pull out the onion before adding chicken]. This recipe is so worth the hour of effort.

this was ok, nothing special. I followed the recipe to the tee, but I was surprised it did not have the flavor it seemed like it should

Great recipe for fried chicken if you like a thick crunchy outside. I used peanut oil for frying and it really helps if you skim the excess dredge that stays in the fryer between batches. Your oil will last longer and not impart burnt flavors into the chicken. I did run out of dredge so double it up if your doing big pieces. I will make this one again, the buttermilk and spices makes it great.

This is the the first and only fried chicken recipe I've ever used (made it twice). Bought cut up parts (thighs and drumsticks), marinated for however long I had (1.5 hours) and followed the frying instructions exactly. PERFECTION. The only change I've made is to add more Tabasco and cajun seasonings to give it a bit more kick. A crowd favorite for sure.

A project but so very delicious. I've never made fried chicken before, but I followed the directions exactly and couldn't have been more pleased. I didn't have time to let it marinate for 6 hours (only had 2), but I'm not sure it would have made a big difference. The next time, my only change will be to add more spice to the flour mixture to give it a bigger kick. Double dredging definitely makes for an incredible crunch!

This was the first time I ever fried chicken. The flavor was great. I had a problem with the double dipping. I felt like the chicken came out kind of bready in spots. Next time I make this I'm going to shake it up in a paper bag and see if it comes out with a more even coating. I bought the cookbook and it's really nice.

It was tasty but even with lowering the temp I still couldn't do the time it said because it was getting too dark. The outside was overdone and the inside underdone. Baking only made the outside darker and harder.If I used a digital fryer it probably would've come out more evenly cooked.
