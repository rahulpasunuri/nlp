The taste of this custard is absolute heaven. I used 1 vanilla bean instead of the extract. I would recommend cooking it a little longer than the recipe says, as it turned out a little runny and not "custardy" as I had anticipated.

Possible modifications when cooking with toddler: Came out splendidly when I stirred for 15 min instead of 30 and I did not strain through cheese cloth. I did add vanilla bean. Awesome.

I made this for a Spanish themed potluck and everyone loved it!! The cinnamon flavour was amazing. The almond cake was also very good, but not as good as the Natillas! I would definitely recommend this recipe

Delicious!! It goes perfect with the almond cake or even by itself...it is funny, but even though I'm spanish I did not have this recipe. It is definetely authentic and it tastes exactly as I remember.

I liked this dessert- easy and different. If you like cream and cinnamon, you can do no better.

I have made this several times to rave reviews.

I served small pots of this with fresh raspberries to a group of girlfriends at a birthday celebration recently. The tartness of the fruit complemented the sweetness of the custard perfectly - I've never seen so many women in heaven at one time!

My grandparents came to america from the mountains of Spain, and so Ive been ejoying natillas since I was born... but recently moved to college without the recipe. This one comes very close and is oh so good.

I am a longtime fan of the spectacular Natillas at El Faro in NYC. This is almost as good. It takes longer to thicken than suggested, but keep at it. I also opted not to strain, which was a minor but not fatal mistake.

Took a lot of time and pot watching, but it's a stunningly delicious custard sauce!

This was not a difficult thing to make (just took some time and constant attention); it really complemented well the tarta de almendras. It's worth trying. I had never made custard before and I was happy with how well it went.
