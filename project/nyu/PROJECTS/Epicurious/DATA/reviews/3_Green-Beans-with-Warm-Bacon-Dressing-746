This side was ok. I cooked 4 pieces of bacon (for snacking) and didn't reduce the amount of grease so it came out quite greasy. There was nothing overly special about this dish, but it was quick. I'm not sure if I'd make this again.

Quick. Easy. Delicious.

There are so many much better things to do with green beans. Not anything worth taking the time to make.

This is the best! My family loves it, as do I. It is good to cut up the bacon after frying it. This dish is awesome and goes with almost anything!

My boyfriend tends to like his veggies plain, but for a nice dinner I decided to try this recipe. The bacon tasted great with the green beans, but the dressing wasn't so good. Part of the problem was that the dressing was too greasy on account of the bacon grease. But crispy bacon and green beans do taste so good together!

Very good, I added red potatoes to it and it was great. Also, cutting up the bacon before frying is a much easier.

From the kids (8 and 11): We love this recipe. We ordinarily like green beans, but the dressing and the bacon are GREAT, taste great together, and make it more than just green beans. Make sure your bacon is crisp. Our mom says to say she cooked it with Balsamic vinegar. We've had it with cooked potato wedges and nut-crusted fish. Delicious!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for a large dinner party of 21 people and everyone raved! I doubled the shallots.

Yum! This is deceptively easy--it tastes like it should be much harder to make!

I found this recipe to be ok. My husband seemed to like it more than me...I think he really liked it actually. I will land up making it again for him. I might try it with another type of vinegar (red or balsamic). We both felt it was better at room temp to almost cold. The vinegar makes it seem like it should be colder. I also diced the bacon before cooking. I usually do this in my recipes and find it to be much easier!

A relatively easy way to liven up green beans. I chopped the bacon before frying, as another reviewer suggested, and this worked fine.

I will make this recipe again. We had it for Christmas dinner and it was so good. I used red wine vinegar and it tasted fine. I like green beans crisp and these were.

My family raved about this recipe at Thanksgiving. I chopped the bacon prior to cooking, rather than crumbling (I don't think it made much difference), and I left the beans whole rather than in pieces. Other than that I matched the recipe and it came out great.

My husband and guests loved this. I did the sauce ahead of time, then just reheated it and added the freshly steamed beans to the frying pan and tossed before putting it out in a serving dish.

If found the dish somewhat greasy and not very flavorful. It added too much fat and too little savory to perfectly good beans.

I thought the beans were way too crisp--I prefer them a little less so. Next time I make them I will try the butter--they seemed to be missing something the way they are now.

This is a very easy recipe and went well with the cornish game hens and wild mushroom bread pudding I prepared for dinner one night. I think the next time I prepare it, I will increase the shallots to 2tbls or my boyfriend suggested using pearl onions instead.

I tried to make this beforehand as an earlier cook mentioned. The beans became sort of wilty so I would not do this again. The flavor is pretty good, but it just wasn't as great as I'd hoped.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and converted green bean haters!! It is absolutely wonderful and tasteful. The beans are crisp. I made this tripling the recipe and it came out just great. Since I do not like last minute preparations when I have a houseful of dinner guests, I cooked the bacon a 3 hours ahead and saved the drippings. Then I completed the recipe with the exception of the topping it with the bacon about 1-2 hours before dinner. When ready to serve just place in the microwave briefly to warm, toss then top and toss with the bacon, serve. Very good. I took the suggestion of adding butter and it was a good addition.

Nice way to dress up green beans without much fat. I used turkey bacon, left it in the pan and added the shallot. I had to add a little oil since the turkey bacon is so lean. I used balsamic vinegar and added a little butter. Very tasty.

Supurb once 2T of butter were added!
