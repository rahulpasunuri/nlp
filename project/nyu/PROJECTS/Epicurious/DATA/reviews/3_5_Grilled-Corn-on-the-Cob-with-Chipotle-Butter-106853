Delicious corn! I have made twice. Chipotle butter adds nice subtle flavor and does not overwhelm the corn.

Delicious! I cooked the corn very briefly in boiling water and then transfered it to the grill and basted it with the butter mixture. I added both more chipotles and lime to the same amount of butter and it was really really yummy. Makes enough for more than 8 ears though. Will make again many times during corn season!!

Very flavorful, new spin on an a summer standard! We grilled the corn, and I also added some of the adobo sauce from the chipotles. I was shocked how good this was, while being so simple. Do yourself a flavor favor, and try this one!!!

This corn was awesome! The chipotles give it just a hint of spiciness but still doesn't overwhelm the corn. Good stuff!

This gives corn a whole new taste. The entire family loves it. I made one minor modification to the butter. I added a teaspoon of the tomato sacue that the chopotle peppers came in to the butter. It gave it a little more zip that didn't seem to cook off on the grill. I also made enough of the butter to have some left over to brush on at the table if desired.

I grilled the corn in husks, which took longer than I thought. The butter was great, and I think it could be used on any other vegetables, meat, etc.

Excellent, excellent. Served it at home, at a cottage gathering, at a book club in the last two weeks. I did add a little more lime juice than recipe asks for, and cut corn up into smaller pieces. Oohs and aahs all around, commenting on the way the corn looked to the sweet, smoky flavour of the kernels. Non corn eater ate several pieces.

The grilled corn is always a plus. Left it on the grill until I herd it begin to pop . . . Delisiuos. The chipolte butter was disapointing. I have had better. Maybe using tin foil to hold the ingrediants with the corn while grilling will help. By the time it was done the ingredients had dripped away. Tried smearing sime more on after cooking, but too late.

I've made this twice now - it's very flavorful and is a nice change from plain old corn. I added a touch more lime - but other than that the recipe is perfect as is. Husband and Dad loved it.

Amamzing. At first bite, everyone at the table fell silent. I used a fixed line gas grill and left them on for about ten minutes until I heard the first kernel pop, then placed them back in the baking dish with all the chipotle butter, rolled them around, and served. A new family favorite.

My husband and I love BBQ and we tried many grilled corn recipes. This is the best! We can't have BBQ without this corn!

I make this corn all the time -- it is very easy and tastes great -- such an improvement on regular corn on the cob.

My wife was skeptical, but fought for the last ear of corn!

We all loved the chipotle butter - nice and smoky with just a little bite!

I had a dinner party and everyone loved the corn. Next time I will use my food processor to save time.

This corn is terrific!

This recipe was nice, but if you want to impress your taste buds (and your guests) try the Ancho-Garlic butter. Superior taste. Mix the ingredients in the food processor.....so much easier to spread the butter on the cob and not as time consuming. Note: chipotles can be frozen individually.

I've made this recipe twice now and my family loved it both times. The corn cooks so perfectly!

Made this corn for a small dinner party - the guests loved it. Also made the sun-dried tomato burgers but those were not as good. I read the "fine print" too late, having previously read only the recipe ingredients for my shopping list - and used lean ground beef. They were dry and the flavors of the spices took over any hamburger taste. It was a little too unusual. They tasted mostly like Cumin Burgers.

I served this for a bbq party with the sun-dried tomato burgers. Both were great!
