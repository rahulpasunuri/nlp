Enjoyed this pie a great deal! Used all whipping cream; increased amount of spices, especially ground ginger. Baked for about 45-50 minutes. Good texture. Filling was a tad sweet, so would decrease sugar in the future. This will become my go-to recipe.

I love, love, love this rendition of pumpkin pie. Have made it every Thanksgiving for the past 8 years and it never fails to win high approval from the partakers. The toffee/walnut topping makes it even more special and is a great combination.

This pie was so easy to make! I'm not a huge pumpkin pie lover, but having the chocolate-y skor bars melt on top added serious pizzaz. It's a simple dessert but very creamy and tasty. PS If you cheat and use store bought crust, the pie is a total snap and still tastes good!

This was good, but I think that's because I love heath bars. It was nothing to write home about, and it went unfinished as the days passed.

This is a good variation on standard pumpkin pie but is essentially very simple in flavors. Personally, I'm not a HUGE pumpkin pie fan...and I made the Spiced Pumpkin Cheesecake (from this site) for Thanksgiving and it was frankly so over the top delish that this didn't stand a chance in comparison! While very good, I'll stick with other desserts with more wow factor - the Pecan, Caramel, Fudge pie is also simple and superb !

Followed the recipe exactly. Great tasting pie but the pie crust was difficult to deal with (I make lots of pies!) because it kept breaking apart as I worked with it. I fork holed the crust and had no sliding BUT had to put foil around the crust on the second bake because it started to brown too much. Having said that it was wonderfully flakey and not a morsel was left over even though I had made extra. I searched for heath bars (and it was worth it) and only put it 1" inside the crust. I also made it the day before and left them out overnight (no cracking!) and applied the topping in the morning on cold pie. Great blend of pumpkin, toffee ,chocolate, walnuts and spices. The loss of one fork was ONLY due to the difficulty of the dough otherwise it would be 4 forks!

This pie got rave reviews from pumpkin pie lovers. I made recipe as is, but my crust was not rolling out, so I pulled it out and pressed it into the pie dish like a crust- it turned out great, and all the seasonings make it a perfect pumpkin filling

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and out of 12 pies at our gathering, this pie blew every other pie out of the water. For the crust, I substituted chilled vodka for half of the water (the vodka evaporates as the pie cooks and makes for ridiculously flakey and delicious crust). I also used skor bars for the topping (which have a little chocolate in them...which make for an added bonus). This pie is a rockstar.

this pie was fabulous. i made it just how the recipe called for. im not even a big fan of pumpkin and i enjoyed it. the family raved about it. the chocolate covered toffee bits and walnuts are a great combination! i would love to make it again. the crust was a little tricky getting it to come together, but it was worth the effort

Excellent pie except it was a little too sweet. Next time I will cut down on the suagr a little.

Everyone agreed this was an excellent pumpkin pie. I only added 1/2 tsp of ginger. I was afraid that 3/4 would be to much. The toffee and nuts were a great addition. A note to those that had a problem with the crust while blind baking. Julia Child said to cover bottom and sides with tin foil and fill with a bag of dried beans. You will not have a problem with the crust shrinking,puffing or sliding down the pie plate.

To correct Olympia, WA, Heath bits DO have chocolate on them with the English toffee. It really adds to the pie. This is the most delicious Pumpkin Pie. The heavy cream makes it smooth and creamy. It has much spice, like pumpkin should. I never tried the pie crust since I make my own from the Peach Pie recipe, Bon Appetit, amazing. Give it a try, I would never consider making any other Pumpkin Pie!

This pie really turned out wonderful. I used a store-bought crust to save time, but the filling was light, with just the right amt of spice. My family has already requested that I make it again!

Absolutely delicious pie! I've made many pumpkin pies, and I think this is my favorite thus far. Can't think of a single thing I'd change about the recipe - just wonderful as written.

Rating: 4
I bake pies A LOT and this is by far the best pumpkin pie recipe around--but I've found it's better with Heath Bars, no just toffee bits--the chocolate is a wonderful touch--in fact, since so many of my family and friends HATE walnuts, I skip the nuts entirely and simply add EXTRA Heath bar around the edge. I usually braid the pie crust edge--it's a wonderful overall presentation.

Rating: 4
Best pie ever! Keep the topping around the sides, don't go overboard, and take the time to make this crust - it is amazing. People in previous reviews mention Skor candybars - don't use the bars because they have chocolate on them. The recipe calls for Skor bits or Heath baking bits, which are just the toffee bits with no chocolate.

This pumpkin pie was the best I've ever had. It was really flavorful and delicious. Next time, I will go the extra step and add the skor candybar.

Well, I'm reviewing this recipe in April since my boyfriend asked me to make him pumpkin pie for his birthday - no chocolate cake for this guy! I substituted evaporated milk for cream and soy milk for milk and it still worked great. The filling set up really well and was creamy and delicious! I didn't try the walnut and skor topping because he is a purist... Only complaint is that this is the first time I baked the crust first and it shrank quite a lot and then was overdone by the time the pie was set so next time I think I will just bake it with the filling.

I made this pie for my father-in-law for a sunday dinner because he loves pumkin pie. My husband turned his nose up. He tried it to be polite. Everyone loved it. The best ever is what I heard. Needless to say I am making it this year for Thanksgiveing dinner and for our church and my sons school feast. Thank you

I roasted sugar pie pumpkins and used the fresh puree instead of canned pumpkin. It was so amazing that our neighbor is insisting I enter this pie in next year's Octoberfest pumpkin pie competition. Utterly outstanding - a must for Thanksgiving!

I only made the filling (already had a graham cracker crust) and no filling, but this was very good. Very smooth, creamy, just sweet enough, and incredibly easy. Will make again and again.

I liked it cooled in the fridge overnight better than while it was warm because it got solid when cool.

First time I made the pie I used the Bon Appetit pie crust recipe that goes with the peach pie on the site. WONDERFUL! This pie to wonderful, best we ever had and I think better without the chocolate and walnuts. The chocolate and walnuts detracted from the sweetness and spice filled pie. I would highly recommend this pie!

The recipe says you can make this 6 hrs in advance. Is there any reason why you can't make it a day or two in advance and refrigerate it? Please advise!!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving at the in-laws and it was quick and easy (I have to admit I bought a pre-made crust not wanting to mess my mother-in-law's kitchen too much), but the pie filling was the best they said they ever had and I thought the toffee topping was a excellent twist on an old favorite. They've requested it again this year.

a wonderful recipe!. the toffee-walnut topping is a nice twist on traditional pumpkin pie. i made this for thanksgiving- my family loved it.

I had this at a 50th birthday party and it was absolutely the best pumpkin pie I ever ate and had the hostess track down the recipe for me. Confusing to me was the use of SKOR candy -- the pie I tasted didn't have chocolate in it so I melted the chocolate off the SKOR before I used it. The pie crust was most of the work but my family loved it so much this will now be the only pumpkin pie I make!

This was an excellent pie. I doubled the spices and omitted the toffee-nut topping. Next time, I won't do the latter, as I think it would've added something unique and interesting. All-in-all, we agreed that it had an uncommonly smooth and creamy texture. Delicious!

Excellent pumpkin oie! My family has requested this pie every year since it debuted two years ago. It is creamy and the crust is flakey. The toffee and walnut topping add an extra flare that is a hit with the kids and adults. I wait until the pie cools completely before I add the toffee.

I did not assign a fork rating because I used this recipe only for the filling. Instead of making a regular pie crust, I baked this in mini-pumpkin shells. The filling was good and quite thick, but I still prefer the filling for Spiced Pumpkin Pie (on this site). I think there was too much of something -- sugar or a certain spice.

OH MY what a beautiful pie! The crust melts in your mouth! I made it as last evenings dessert and this morning there is one piece left! I'll definately make it again!

Very good. Just beware that the toffee pieces melt as they rest on the cooling pie. Therefore when you serve it, you need a sharp knife to cut through the toffee pieces that have melted together into a larger mass.

Everyone loved this pie! The filling was fantastic, but I had problems with the crust shrinking, bubbling, and sliding down the sides of the pie plate during the pre-baking phase, even though I froze it according to the directions. Next time I'll use my own tried and true crust recipe. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves to the filling along with the other spices.

I made this recipe twice and the first time it came out beautifully, the second, I also had problems with the crust. There were only two things I did differently the second time which may have caused the crust to collapse on itself: 1) I used a deeper pie dish, and 2) I forgot the put the crust in the freezer for 15 minutes. Both times I used a store bought pie crust, which was a big time saver.

Rating: 4
Excellent! The crust is very simple to make (can easily be done by hand with a pastry blender) and the filling is divine! I used freshly baked pumpkin (one good size sugar pumpkin, butternut squash, etc. will yield enough for the recipe, probably more) and believe me, this makes all the difference in the world when making ANY pumpkin pie recipe! (Simply cut pumpkin or squash in half, scoop out seeds, wrap in foil and bake at 350-degrees until fork-tender) I covered the entire top of the pie with the toffee-nut mixture and it melted into a beautiful swirl of golden color...and was delicious!

Excellent! I now have my standard for pumpkin pie.

Toffee when exposed to moisture will eventually melt. If you refrigerate this pie a few days ahead, the moisture from the pie filling and the refrigerator will melt the toffee and it will lose it's characteristic "snap" or crunch. Make it ahead, refrigerate it, and then reserve the nuts and toffee for an hour or so before you serve it. While I am more than capable of snarfing up a cold pumpkin pie, the flavors are more pronounced when served at room temperature.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten! I usually prefer sweet potato pie, but now I've changed my mind. I didn't use the crust recipe, I used store-bought, but the pie was absolutely delicious. I made two at the time and brought them to work. Everyone LOVED them!!! Thanks for the great recipe. It's very easy to make and I would recommend it to anyone!

This is by far the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten. I used my own "pate brisee" recipe for the crust. But the filling was divine...and I usually am not a big pumpkin pie fan. This filling tasted like a pumpkin pudding but of course the consistency was thick and stayed together like a pie should. I did make some alterations...I left out all the spices and before putting the pie in the oven I sprinkled cinnamon, toffee and the walnuts all over the top and then baked it. It came out great, the toffee melted and the top looked beautiful, kinda like a pecan pie. It tasted even better...I will never try another recipe for pumpkin pie again. I finally found THE recipe and it was simple to make. This will be a sure hit this Thanksgiving!

I'm not a pumpkin pie expert, but I thought this pie was delicious--good, full flavor with the nice added touch of walnuts and toffee. It was visually appealing as well. I also liked the crust--it started to bubble up a little during the initial baking, so I just took it out and pricked it with a fork a few times. I kept the water to a scant 2 tablespoons which made it very difficult to handle, but the resulting crust was so light and flaky! For the filling, I just used a full cup of cream.

I have been baking pies for 40 years and am known as 'The Pie Maker' by family and friends. This is by far the best pumpkin pie I have ever made. I grow my own pumpkins and believe that adds a lot to the filling. The walnuts and toffee were a wonderful addition. But the crust--unbelievable. I don't know what the first reviewer did, but this is absolutely the best crust recipe for a single crust pie. The egg yolk brush kept the filling from soaking in and the crust remained absolutely flakey and tender.

Rating: 3
The pumpkin filling and the toffee-walnut topping were delicious. The crust, however, left a lot to be desired. I followed the instructions to the letter, and I am not a novice cook, but the crust collapsed in upon itself while being pre-baked. Luckily I checked the crust before the indicated time was up and was able to save it. The crust, however, was tough! I will make the filling and topping again but will use my own tried and true crust recipe.
