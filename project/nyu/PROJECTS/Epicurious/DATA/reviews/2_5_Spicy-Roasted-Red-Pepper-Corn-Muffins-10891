I've gotta side with Seattle on this one. I found the muffins to be overly salty although I didn't find them to be too greasy. The flavor was good but not great. I'm sure there are better recipes out there. They are not so bad that I won't eat them, however.

I love this receipe! Warm with butter or cold, the flavor was terrific, with a nice bite from the chillies.

Do not bother with this recipe. The muffins lacked flavor, except for saltiness, and were greasy.
