So so so so good. Made exactly as directed, but only used four cups of broth and one of white wine (because my box of broth only contained four cups!), and used 3/4 lb of shrimp. Delicious, flavorful, easy.

I hate people that do this, but I made some adjustments based on my past experience making risotto. Used a 1/2 lb of shrimp and added the tails to 4 cups of broth and only used 1 c risotto. Included the garlic and substituted shallots instead of onion and sautéed with the risotto. Also, sautéed the shrimp right before adding to the cooked risotto. Added parmesan at the same time. This amount was perfect for the two of us--no leftovers. Can't wait to make it again! A real keeper.

Excellent risotto! I made a bigger quantity and added also some wine in the rice, berfore adding the broth. Everyone in the family loved it! I left the parsley out (optional since my kids do not like it). Even without parsley it was great!

Absolutely loved this...so did my hubby and friends. Just got back from Italy and I was wanting to recapture the experience. This totally did it! I didn't realize this recipe was a serving for two, but it did feed all four of us. Everyone said it was sufficient, but I really wanted more. I need to figure out how to 1.5 the recipe. Double maybe too much, and I'm not sure how this reheats. This was my first experience making risotto. I used shrimp w tail on. Next time I'll take off the tails, and throw them into the broth for extra flavor. We also added about a cup of parm cheese. They don't add parm cheese in Italy, but we just love the extra creaminess and touch of salt from the cheese. I will definitely make this again.

This is truly superb. The risotto recipe seems to be failsafe - I used long-grain white rice and it was still excellent.

Rating: 4
Yum. Made this as per the recipe, except after sauteeing the shrimp, I did not simmer it in the wine. I thought it would make the shrimp a little soggy. I also did add the shrimp shells to the broth. But anyway, we all thought it was outrageous. One problem that maybe someone can help me with - my risotto took almost 50 minutes to be done. Have had the same experience when making it for osso bucco. Is there something I am doing wrong to have it take so much longer than the recipes say?

Rating: 4
This dish is delicious, period! The recipe is easy to make, even though it does requires a bit of attention as the broth gets added. The flavors are well balanced, and it is lighter than I expected. The red pepper flakes add just the perfect kick to keep it interesting. I wouldnt change a thing. We had this with a vinaigrette tossed salad and Riesling. However, you could eat this as a sand-alone meal. This recipe is deserving of the rating and previous praise. ENJOY!

This recipe was delicious. The only thing that I did differently was when it was all done I added about 1/4 of a cup of parmesan cheese to it and the last tablespoon of butter and a little salt and pepper. Will definitely make again. Very easy.

Um there's none left which is a rare occasion. I did make some slight modifications because I didn't have everything. I did some large shrimp per the recipe and put the shells in the broth. I also did some small shrimp and some Argentinian scallops which I finished off with a fiery Thai sauce to add a little kick. I also used leeks instead of onions since my partner can't tolerate onions or garlic. At the end I added Parmesan and tiny frozen spring peas plus the seafood. It was sensational--by far the best risotto I have ever made and my partner devoured it which makes it a 4 in my book.

So simple. Since I don't follow recipes... I put the peeled raw shrimp into a stockpot together with the wine and chicken broth. Turned up the heat, so the shrimp turned pink. Removed the shrimp and used that broth for my risotto liquid. At the end, I also added some fresh grated parmesan. It was good, and I'll make it again, for sure.

Yum-my! I followed others' advice and 1)doubled the shrimp, 2)added the shrimp shells to the broth, 2)stirred in thyme, butter, and 1/2 c. parm at the end. (I didn't however, add all the stock in the saucepan--there was about 1/2-3/4 cup left--b/c the rice was almost done and I wanted to be able to add the reserved shrimp cooking liquid w/o the risotto becoming too soupy. Glad I made that choice.) The dish was perfect. With salad and crusty bread, it served 3 of us (2 hungry 6-foot guys and me) generously.

I made this for a small dinner party I hosted. I used a whole pound of shrimp, per others' suggestions, and used seafood stock instead of chicken broth. (I actually used four cup stock, and one cup of chicken broth.) I added about a half cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese. It was a hit! I would definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe many many times and it's one of my family's favorites. I too double the amount of shrimp. I also use 2 cups of arborio but don't usually make changes to the quantities of the rest of the ingredients. I have made it with or without the chicken broth and I don't see a big difference. I cook the risotto with fewer amounts of water/broth at a time and stirring almost continuously as per Marcella Hazan's recipe in her Classic Italian Cookbook. Oh and I never use any butter, just really good quality extra virgin olive oil. This recipe is a big hit my two young kids too.

Really delicious and perfect for a cool, rainy spring evening. Can't say it's exceptional, but definitely an ur-risotto recipe. Good ideas I used from other people to make it an entree: double the shrimp and use shells to make the broth; add a little dry or fresh thyme at some point, also spinach, juice of 1/2 lemon and a bit of saffron when stirring in reserved shrimp cooking liquid toward the end; stir in a bit of parm if it needs it at the end or have it on the table.

Rating: 3
This is a good basic recipe for risotto and shrimp. I would follow it somewhat closely if you are not familiar with risotto. It almost always take longer that they say to cook the rice. I also add a veggie (frozen peas, fresh baby spinach or blanched broc) during the last minutes. I agree with earlier reviews that you either add more shrimp or reduce the rice to 1C.

Rating: 3
This recipe was good, but yielded way more than two servings. I was looking for a recipe for two, and even with one additional guest we had leftovers. I ended up adding a 1/2 cup more wine while I was coating the rice which gives the risotto a nice bite and a bit more flavor. I would make this recipe again, I'll just have to remember to make a half-batch next time.

Rating: 3
Yummy - but I agree with the others: use seafood stock rather than chicken stock and add more shrimp. I'd also add a touch more red pepper - I have a LOW tolerance for spiciness, but I can't taste it. Yummy risotto though

Great recipe - only changes I make is double the shrimp - and after peeling the shrimp, I put the shells in with the broth/wine mixture while it simmers - strain before incorporating into the risotto. Great flavor comes out of the shells.

The idea of this risotto sounded pretty good, but the result was a bit bland. I don't mean that it needed salt, but I expected to to taste more the shrimp and overall more seafood taste. Note also that I cooked half of the recommended dosage but kept the one pound of shrimp! I will make it again but replace chicken stock with fish stock or clam juice and add more cayenne pepper.

I agree with other users. This was my first time making risotto (I'm not a habitual cook either) it was pretty easy. The flavors were great. No need for salt or pepper.

This was really good, but I would echo some previous comments re portions and working time. It makes a lot. Next time I would either reduce the amount of rice and make two servings or add shrimp and make it for four. Also, no way does it take 20 minutes; more like 40-45. Having said that, it was more flavorful than the ingredient list would lead you to believe. I will definitely make it again - when I have an hour to stir.

Rating: 4
This was very good. It was my first time making risotto and found it be very easy. My husband and I like more of an al dente rice so I didn't use the last cup of broth. And it's definitely more than 2 servings. I will be using this recipe again.

Rating: 4
Perfect and simple. Next time I am going to reduce the red pepper...not sure it needs it. Only in America is this 2 servings. More like 5-6. I added small scallops to the mix...didn't work that well as the texture was different enough to make a difference. I was surprised by the level of flavor, especially since you don't add any salt or pepper. Finally, I wonder how cilantro would work instead of parsley. It should make a nice marriage w/the red pepper flakes.

really enjoyed this recipe. this was my first time cooking risotto, and i was initially nervous about making it because i heard it can be fussy. patience with the liquid absorption and lots of stirring seemed to be key. it turned out really well, and i added a ton of small squash as a sauteed the shrimp. i served it with pecorino romano, which was also nice. delicious and very rich and flavorful!

Made this as a first course for a recent dinner party. It went over extremely well--certainly hearty enough to have been the main course. Have tried risotto 3-4 times before, but this one has been far and away the best. Thanks to those who recommended lemon and saffron..which I did use (juice from one lemon and just a few strands of saffron). I also added a few chopped baby portobello mushrooms. Excellent. Note: risotto isn't easy. If you don't have the patience to stir it for 40 minutes (not 20 minutes!) until it's creamy and properly cooked, go on to something else. If you do, enjoy.

I used a pressure cooker to cook the risotto, prepare onions and butter as directed, coat the risotto, added all the chicken stock, turn up the heat to cook for 3 minutes on high heat, then lower heat to cook for 4 minutes, remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Run cooker under cold water to relieve pressure, added precooked shrimp and asparagus top with graded cheese.

I loved this. At first I was sceptical of using wine in the stock, the saucepan with the risotto and the pan with the shrimps, but I stuck to the measurements and it came out just right. I had a few variations: I added about 3 tbsp of milk halfway through the simmering of the rice in the stock (enhances the creaminess slightly); added some lemon zest with the garlic and onions, and lemon juice at the end; a pinch of saffron at the end; cilantro instead of parsley, though this is simply what I had in my fridge; and some parmesan cheese at the end for extra creaminess. Each was largely a matter of personal preference and what I had available.

I simmered the shrimp shells in water and used that liquid, along with the white wine, instead of any chicken stock. Tasted great!

Very nice risotto recipe. I cut down on the butter and upped the garlic and parsley. Next time I will add just a small amount of fresh lemon juice to brighten all the flavors. It was a hit with all the guests. No one would believe that there was no cream or cheese added because the dish came out so creamy.

I have made this a couple of times for my family and it has quickly become a favorite. I add 1 1/2 dozen each mussels and clams in the shell, which I cook with the shrimp (I also increase the shrimp to 3/4 lb). It adds a nice touch visually and really enhances the flavor. No need to increase the amount of arborio rice.

I would make it again (and have) with the following changes: Saute shrimp when risotto is almost done. Add lemon juice and lemon zest to the risotto. Do not stir in the shrimp, but rather make a well in the dished up risotto and ladle in the scampi and the juiced then top it with some parm cheese and a little chopped ital. parsley. To mix it up, add in some asparagus as a side or in it. As is this is the most beige, uninviting, borezville meal. The shrimp get lost if you mix them in. The risotto needs some sprucing and lemon and cheese... how can you go wrong? You HAVE to cook the shrimp at the end. The shrimp will continue to cook in their sauce and then if you add them and cook for yet another 5 minutes those shrimp are effectively balls of rubberbands. Cooking at the last minute solves that. The creator of this recipe needs to find another job. As is, the recie is complete rubbish.

I loved the idea of cooking the shrimp seperately and then adding that cooking liquid to the risotto at the end. But overall, I found the risotto kind of bland. Everyone else at dinner loved it, I was not impressed. I added some blanched asparagus towards the end of cooking the risotto. And this definitely serves more than 2! I served 4 for a dinner and there were still leftovers (maybe it's becuase I filled it out with the asparagus).

Fantastic flavor! It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to cook. As it was just the two of us, I didn't make the full amount of rice, but kept the same amount of shrimp.

Another first time risotto maker here, and it was delicious and easy. The one thing I would note is to have all ingredients preped (choped parsley, etc...)before begining the risotto.

I did stir in lots of parley and basil since it's abundant in the garden right now, and also grated in some parm to finish!

I made this for my fiance who does not like rice and it was a success. Then I made it again for my parents and siblings, doubled the recipe, and they were fighting over who got to eat the leftovers the next day. The trick to creamy rice is to watch the arborio closely. Halfway cooked you would notice it has a white dot in the center. It is fully cooked when the rice is translucent.

Loved this recipe - had some leftover shrimp and other items and this was the perfect recipe to do that - maybe I'm too much of a purist, but I NEVER add cheese to seafood risottos (learned that from Mario Batali) as I find the intensity of the cheese flavor overpowers the delicate flavor of the seafood.

As always, I can't follow a recipe to save myself, I always end up changing things a bit, but for the basic risotto with shrimp recipe, this was wonderful and quite simple. I did add some peas, another teaspoon of garlic, a little more than a 1/4 cup of freshly grated parm, about 1/4 cup of wine directly into the mixture at the end to give a bit of pungency, and topped off each serving with a drop of truffle oil just, yaknow, for the hell of it. It was so good that my friend actually ate his peas without picking each individual pea out like he's apt to do.

Rating: 2
tried this risotto with the best/ freshest ingredients: homemade chicken broth, a good sauvignon, ... added some corn and peas. and pecorino. but still the taste lacked pungency. I am thinking that the mixing of broth with 1/4 c of wine doesn't help out. I guess the other technique of (cooking the rice first with 1/2c of wine, then adding cup by cup the broth) gives the rice a tanginess that you don't get with the gradual incorporation of the wine mixed with broth.

Did anybody else find 6 T of butter to be a bit excessive? Not just because of the fat content, but because it makes the dish overwhelmingly buttery-flavored. Now when I make this risotto I use half the amount of butter. This is a good basic recipe--you can play with the texture by adding diced veggies (asparagus, green beans, whatever) toward the end. Just time it so they're cooked through, yet retain their "crunch".

Rating: 2
Well, I was disapointed. It was good, don't get me wrong, and relatively easy to make even though it used several different pans. Something about the texture was bland and I definately did not find it rich, creamy, and delicious as previous reviewers found it. I used the extra pepper flakes and all, and it did have a nice flavor. Maybe I'm just not crazy about the texture of risotto, and just find rice bland/boring in general. I'm willing to make it again though, maybe adding the chicken will help.

This was very good, but I did make some changes...I substituted some of the chicken broth with shrimp stock that I made with the shrimp shells, onion, and a bay leaf, and I added a little bit of parmesan cheese and cream at the very end.

Also, as is, this recipe serves about 3-4, not 2.

Hi! I just made a double batch and it turned out great. I used frozen cooked shrimp bought from Costco (which I thawed and threw into the cooked risotto). The crushed pepper makes a big (great) difference and I also added some saffron (tossed both spices in while the risotto was cooking). Give this one a try - it will not disappoint!

The dish was delicious and very easy to make. However, I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for, and I had to add about 1 1/2 cups of broth. I also added 1 cup of peas at the end--delicious but would have been just as good without. This recipe is much easier than many others I've seen; will definitely make again.

One of the best recipes I've ever made. Very creamy without using cream. It takes time but is definitely worth the wait. It helps to cook with good wine. Will make it again and again!

My husband and I love this recipe. It is easy to make and so tasty. I add a few extra shrimp which I butterfly before sauting. While the risotto is cooking I cut the shrimp into smaller pieces. This way you get shrimp in every spoonful! Don't forget to add some salt and pepper at the end. A definate keeper.

I loved this dish! I added more garlic and more pepper flakes. To offset the creamy texture, I added some lightly sauteed red pepper! Definitely will make again!

My family is not big on shrimp, substituted mushrooms instead. I added cream and parmasean cheese at the very end. Delicious!

Hubby raved! Definately a keeper! Made a few additions of peas and grounded, dried, shitake mushrooms. I rehydrated them in warm broth and added them at the end - They gave a good earthy quality to the risotto. Oh yea, also added lots more garlic. Yummy!!

Good, simple recipe for Risotto. Definitely use arborio rice - it will not be the same without it. I added a few stamens of saffron early and about a cup of frozen peas right at the end - delicious additions! Also added about 1/2 C of fresh-grated aged parmensan cheese.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! We've tried several risotto recipes and this is by far the best. We added some Gran Padano parmesan and a little bit of heavy cream once the risotto was done. And don't forget the parsley!!! Can't wait to make it again!

This is a great dish. I've added blanched asparagus and tomatoes at the end of cooking with great results. Easy to make and delicious.

What a nice change from pasta. This was very easy to make, and even better to eat. I did however make a few additions. I used hot turkey sausage, and portabella mushrooms what a nice blend of flavors. I also added fresh basil and asiago cheese right before seving. Will make again and again.

I do not have much experience in the kitchen but found this recipe very easy to make! My husband and I both loved it! I will definitely make this again.

Loved it! I added just a touch of salt at the end and definitely pepper. I think next time I would use more chile. Don't skip the parsley - it was perfect!

This dish was fabulous, easy with the exception of peeling shrimp which I hate. My husband is a professional chef and I like to cook for him. He loved it was very impressive! My children also liked it. It's a definate winner in my book.

This was fun and easy. I didn't like the red pepper, but my date did (and that's what really counts). Taking a tip from "The Naked Chef", I added some frozen peas and a few mushrooms right near the end. Delicious, but it doesn't re-heat very well.

I have made this recipe many times. Its a great one dish meal. It is very rich and serves more then two and we are even big eaters. Just be patient when adding the broth slowly, thats the secret to a creamy risotto. DELECIOUS!

This recipe is great. I used a shrimp stock made from the shells and chicken stock. I also added 1/2 cup of heavy cream right after it was al dente and then a half cup of pecorino romano cheese. But it was great w/o my add-inns.

Yum! This was my first attempt at making risotto and it came out great! I used some homemade chicken stock and some broth I made with shrimp shells, onions, and carrot. I also used some scallops in addition to shrimp and probably had a total of a pound of seafood. The rice was creamy, the taste was great! On half of it I added some chopped sauteed portobello mushrooms which was also yummy! It was definitely enough for three if not four people. But I like leftovers! Great recipe!

Note: When I visited Italy last Summer, they emphatically recommended that I not add cheese to any seafood dishes. Since that time I've followed that rule and agree wholeheartedly with their recommendations. A couple of tips - do not substitute arborio rice, make sure you stir this dish constantly ***with a wooden spoon*** and cook only very briefly after you add the reserved shrimp cooking liquid. It will be perfect!

Superb!! I did jazz it up however. I put bay scallops, asparagus, and parmesan cheese in it. It would probably have been delicious without the additions, but turned out "beyond compare" with the additions. Very easy to make!

Excellent dish! It was easy to prepare even for a novice cook like myself. I think it really helped to stir the rice constantly though. It turned out perfect.

My first time making risotto, and it was a hit! I thought it would be terribly complicated, but this recipe is very easy to follow. I used veggie stock instead of chicken, and threw in a few crimini mushrooms. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is delicious. My husband makes it for us and we've had it so many times, that he can make it without the recipe in front of him. One recommendation, add more shrimp!

This was a winner. We used 1# of freshwater prawns and added asparagus - 1/2#, primarily tips, crimini mushrooms - 1/4# sauteed and parmesan cheese at the end. This can easily serve four people - or two VERY healthy appetites.

I added fresh basil and some parmesan. It was great. With an appetizer, bread and salad, it served four easily. Way too much for two people.

This was my first attempt at risotto using arborio rice instead of long grain and I couldn't believe the difference!! It was creamy and had a good flavor although I thought it was a little bland. I added alot of salt, but that may just be my taste. My husband and I enjoyed it, but I may add some more seasoning the next time.

I have made this recipe four times. It is really a special dish. Simple and delicious. It makes your whole house smell good while it cooks. I add fresh spinach to vary the texture and the flavors. Mmmmm.

yummy stuff. i just used the recipe as a guideline though. i made shrimp broth and i added crimini mushrooms, asparagus and stewed tomatoes, as well as fresh basil. it was outstanding!

We omitted the crushed red pepper flakes and instead added chopped shitake mushrooms halfway through the cooking time. It was creamy and garlicy with bursts of shrimp and mushroom flavor -- delicious! A wild greens salad along side made it a dinner to be eaten two nights (this dish easily serves four).

I have made a similar risotto before with cooked prawns but your recipe is even better. Instead of using chicken stock, I made a stock from the shrimp shells and an onion. I usually mix virgin olive oil with butter in my risottos.

Great recipe. It even appeals to my girlfriend, who said she doesn't like shrimp!

Rating: 3
I made my first mistake by using a vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth . It also took longer to absorb the liquid than the recipe called for and the cooking time was an extra fifteen minutes.I felt it had nothing special to make me want to try it again but my husband really enjoyed it.

This recipe is excellent. It is easy to cook and delicious. I served it with salad and, of course, sauvignon blanc! I do not suggest substituting the arborio rice - it is crucial to this recipe. Enjoy!!

This was quite simple and surprisingly rich. I made it for my boyfriend for Valentine's and he said it was the best shrimp dish he had EVER had!

This recipe is a keeper! I used green onions and more garlic and next time would add more shrimp. Also, I didn't use all the broth because I like my rice a little dryer. It is quite rich and flavorful.

My husband and I were very impressed with this risotto recipe; in fact, my husband said he thinks it's the best one I've made (so far). It is very creamy, savory, and has a wonderful texture. I will definitely be making this one again! One thing to note: the recipe claims that it makes only two servings; however, I feel that it will serve three generous portions or even four portions, if you are serving a vegetable and salad with it.

This recipe was delicious and we will definately be making it again. My husband loves the spicy red peppers, but I would prefer to cut the amount down a little. Rich & creamy and a great garlic flavor.

This is fantastic! The second time I cut down on butter and used shrimp stock I made. It tasted even better.

This dish was a Huge success with both my Husband and I. I cut the butter by 1/3 to cut Fat, and in the future would likely half the amount of crushed red peppers that I use, but overall a great dinner!

For more shrimp flavor, use a broth made from simmering the shrimp shells and some celery and onion. Another variation of this dish adds petite peas (frozen is okay) and parmesan at the end.

Yummy - well liked every time. However, I found that I had to cook the shrimp a bit longer than specified or else they were undercooked...

There is too much rice for 2 people and just the right amount of shrimp. I would make 2/3 the amount of rice and fluid and leave the shrimp at 1/2 pound. I cut the butter to three tablespoons, which is more than enough.

Very good. Could easily serve three.
