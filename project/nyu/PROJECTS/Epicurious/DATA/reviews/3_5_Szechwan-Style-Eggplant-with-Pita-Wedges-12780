Made this with a mix of eggplants (globe, graffiti, etc.) but they instantly absorbed the oil & never really got tender (even after adding more oil & steaming a bit). The flavor of the sauce is good though. I served this over coconut rice rather than with pita chips.

This is a very good recipe and I have made it many times.At times I have substituted the eggplant with chicken or tofu and always served it on rice but never with pita.

Had three small white eggplant and some stick peppers in our garden, so thought I'd give this a try. It was really delicious, flavorful and cozy and not too spicy (our two year old ate it all up and pronounced "It's good!" at the end.). I used Thai chili sauce, which was what I had on hand, extra hoisin sauce, and mirin instead of brown sugar or sherry. I browned some Italian sausages in a separate pan and added them at the last, and served the lot over soba noodles instead of pita. I make a lot of Thai stir fries, and I'm curious about why this recipe is ordered the way it is. It works, but normally, you'd fry the garlic, then add the eggplant, then the peppers and finally add the sauce already mixed. This recipe seems to require some unnecessary steps. The pita just confuses me and seems gross and wrong. Rice or noodles is a better way to go.

We really liked this recipe, the sauce especially. I added the pepper with the eggplant and it worked well. I also added some baby bok choy to the scallion step, and threw in some cashews as we had it as a main meal, and I was light on eggplant. Great Monday night meal in 30 minutes. You could double the sauce and use as a Szechwan staple.

Not sure I'd be compelled to call any stir fry "amazing", so gearing up to make this my expectations weren't too high. But stir fry IS after all another solution besides pizza, quiche or soup to work a hodge podge of proteins and veggies together before they expire. So I was just looking for a sauce that could be versatile enough to scale various ingredient combinations. Tweaking heat quantities relative to other ingredients, your mood (or your wife's preference!) and adding other stuff from time to time (e.g. fish sauce, chili oil, oyster sauce instead of soy) this serves as a solid roadmap. And for those Epicurious members that chastise people for altering recipes yet still reviewing - get over it - this community isn't meant to be a place where Michelin stars are earned, it's a helpful tool to make dinner for your family and friends.

Disappointing. A "frenzy" of ingredients. Maybe that was the problem; the dish seems to have lost its identity along the way.

This dish was amazing. I served it over Yakisoba noodles as a main course. It was too spicy for the children, but my husband and I loved it!

I just came back to this recipe after about ten years, having relegated it to the dustbins of cooking memory. made it with two unpeeled graffiti eggplants totaling just over 1.5 lbs, and served as a side dish with dinner. As good as the eggplant dishes at our favorite Chinese restaurant. Don't think of it simply as an appetizer on pita - it's delicious hot right out of the wok.

Fabulous!!!! I wouldn't change a thing. Served with Stacy's Pita Chips. Perfect.

This was excellent, though I made it with far less oil. I started out with just a tablespoon. Once the eggplant was browned, I added a bit of water to the pan to cook the eggplant until it became tender. The sauce was terrific, with the chili paste absolutely being the highlight.

I have been making this recipe for years, but never as a dip. I serve it over rice. We love it. Sometimes I add pork or chicken which I first saute with onion, garlic & ginger.

I also liked this recipe. It was very colorful and tasty, but quite spicy. Next time, I'll cut back on the chili paste (1 tsp). I made a vegetarian version as a main course dish, adding 1 1b. of diced tofu (sauteed like the eggplant), omitted the sherry and scallions, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Served over brown rice it was a big hit.

Wow - what a lot of work and spattery mess for not much flavor. I love this dish in the restaurant, but unfortunately haven't been able to replicate it at home.

My husband and I were seriously underwhelmed by this recipe. Obviously, this comes to personal preferences and tastes, but we would recommend cutting back on the brown sugar as we found it far too sweet. I'm sorry I can't suggest a better amount of sugar, but I only made this dish once. I also can't say that I'd find this too appetizing served with pita wedges.

Yum! I added Shanghai noodles and some sprigs of cilantro to this recipe. Very nice - I'll definitely use this one again.

I've made this 10 times now and have changed it a little with each time... for added texture and to make a main meal, sautee 1/2 lb ground pork or beef or uncased spicy sausage (turkey, pork) and break into very little bits. Set aside and cook eggplant in 1-2T of leftover fat. I tend to use a touch less chili paste just because when it is too spicy it drowns out the other flavors... definitely make the garlic and ginger very small (mince in food processor) and cut eggplant really small as well. Add a little basil just to wilt it when you are done. :)

Very good. I lived in Shanghai for five years and this is the closest I've come in my own kitchen to replicating one of my favourite Chinese eggplant dishes. The pita wedges are not Chinese, so I didn't make them--my review is only of the eggplant and peppers.

As other reviewers suggested, I halved the 1/4 cup oil and the brown sugar. Yum!

I skipped the pita bread and made this recipe to use a surplus of eggplant. I can see it being eaten as one of several dishes in a Chinese meal. I think this is one of the best eggplant recipes that I've ever tasted. I used 3 teaspoons chili garlic sauce instead of chili paste.

Fantastic! Only change was a little less oil.

What am I missing here? I'm not in agreement with any of you! The only substitution I made was using Lee Kum Kee's chili sauce for Szechwan chili paste (I couldn't find any). I thought it tasted horrible with the pita bread. It was too chunky for the pita bread and the flavor wasn't that great! I ended up eating some of it with steamed rice and tossed the rest. I love eggplants and will never waste any in this recipe again!

Great dish, cut the vegtable oil to 1 tbsp, skipped the sugar and pureed the mixture for ease of dipping and carnished with shredded carrot and cilantro for color. Served with rice crackers and baked wonton crisps. Super easy to make and keeps for a week. I keep a batch around for quick meals and snacking.

This is fantastic - read all the rave reviews and had to try. But had to modify as didn't have all the ingredients. Used plum sauce and sweet chilli sauce. Also low fat version by spraying wok with olive oil. Added coriander at the end as suggested. This is low fat, healthy and yummy.

Oh my gosh! This was so delicious. I got rave reviews and couldn't stop eating it myself! Perfect because you can make it ahead of time. I served it with pita chips and it was a hit. Be careful with the chili paste. I only used two tsp and it was plenty hot_ YUM!

I don't usually like eggplant but there were some in my organic produce delivery this week so I had to do something. This dish was wonderful. I served it over brown rice. Next time I think I might add some ground pork.

At first I didn't think I'd like this because it's so similar to a Szechwan eggplant and pork recipe I have but doesn't taste as good coming off the stove. Then I let it chill in the refrigerator and wow! This stuff is really good cold, especially with corn tortilla chips -- the corn adds another flavor dimension. Next time I make it, I'll make sure to chop the eggplant in a smaller dice, so it's easier to scoop up with chips. I thought about pureeing it, but that would ruin the pretty colors.

We have made tons of recipes from this website, but this is the first we felt was worth taking the time to rate. We dropped the pita wedges in favor of serving this over steamed rice. In a word, WOW!!!!!

Oh mama, this was good. I didnt even use the szechwan stuff as i couldnt find it; i used a Thai paste. At any rate, the result was vegan, which for my vegan christmas guests was a nice surprise (just substitute veg. broth for the chicken broth). If you want something easy to make, attractive, and one that will add an Asian flair to your appetizer assortment at a party, i'd definitely go for it. The only thing I might do different next time is offer something other than pita's to dip it in...though i havent figured out what that might be yet....

I made this dish for a Christmas party last year and was a little worried when I saw half of the party surrounding it. Good News. This eggplant dish got rave revues. I was almost embarrased by the praise. I presented the eggplant in a bowl of raddicio leaves on a large white platter. I stir fried some baby eggplant as an edible garnish that surrounded the bowl. I also sprinkled sesame seeds and sesame oil on the flatbread before I toasted them and cut them into wedges which I assembled on the opposite end of the platter. Visually this dish is a knock out. The only addition I made to it was I added Thai Basil to the eggplant mixture. I have a party Saturday night and will be making this dish for the second time. I have my Asian chefs certificate so trust me, you will like this one.

I love this recipe. I serve it with pita chips warm or cold it tastes great. I never really got into eggplant before but I can really get behind this recipe. It is visually appealling and not lacking in the texture department like so many other egg plant dishes I've had. The flavoring is perfect as well. Even if you don't like eggplant I suspect this dish would be an exception.

I really enjoyed this dish, but would lessen the amount of chili paste. Just a bit too spicy on a hot summer day. It's great with just the eggplant, but next time I might add some meat or tofu to it. Served it over white rice. Umm.

I was caught by surprise when this dish turned out so visually appealing (colorful and not some stew of mushy eggplant) and so tasty as well. I used 1t of chili paste, which was just perfect for my personal taste. Next time, I will omit the sesame oil from this dish (even though it's an ingredient I generally love). Aside from that, this recipe is perfect!

I actually used this recipe as a main dish serverd over rice. I also added tofu to it. I thought that it called for a little too much vinegar. Other than that, though, it was great. The sauce is a good basic Chinese sauce. You could stir fry any vegetable or meat in it and have a great meal.
