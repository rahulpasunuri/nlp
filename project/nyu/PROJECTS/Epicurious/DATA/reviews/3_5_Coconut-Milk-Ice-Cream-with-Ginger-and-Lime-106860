I chose this recipe to recreate the coconut gelato I ate in Italy this Summer. I omitted the lime and ginger. Added flaked coconut (1 cup), before chilling in ice-cream maker. Next time, I'll fold in coconut after. Excellent. Not too sweet. Just like in Italy.

This is by far the best icecream I've ever had. I substituted one of the cans of coconut milk with regular coconut milk from the carton since that was what I had on hand. The heavy cream was used instead of half and half. Even with the cream sub, the texture and mouthfeel was light and delicous. I also used just 3/4 c. of sugar and it was still plenty sweet for my tastebuds. No cook time for the base which allowed for a finished product within an hour & 1/2. Perfect.

Fantastic! Tastes of Honduras mixed with India!! I cut back by 2 T. on the sugar, used skim milk instead of half and half, substituted ground dried ginger to taste, used bottled lime juice, and omitted the lime peel. Still, it was very creamy. Next time I will try it with the reduced fat coconut milk to see if my ice cream freezer will still freeze it.

I made it exactly as the recipe said with the only exception being that I used slightly less fresh ginger. I thought it tasted too odd, and I didn't think the flavors went well together. It was too lime-y. My boyfriend (who will eat anything he encounters) left his bowl half full.

I halved the recipe and followed others advice here and lowered the amount of lime and ginger. I also used single cream, which has a slightly higher fat content than half and half. After mixing everything together, I let it sit in the fridge and then strained the mixture to remove any solids. It turns out fine taste-wise but the consistency was chalky. I think if I made this again, I'd use heavy cream. I don't think there was a high enough fat content. However, the taste is lovely.

what i was looking for in a coconut ice cream!followed the previous suggestions and used less ginger. also only used 2 tblsp lime juice,just enough to balance the coconut flavor. we use an ice cream maker and it comes out perfect, with a smooth, creamy texture.serve with toasted coconut and mangoes/raspberries and you have a fantastic dessert.

This was excellent! I loved the over-all flavor, however, I did adjust the recipe I added 3 egg yolks and switched the milk for heavy cream (I prefer a more classic French style ice cream) What you need to do is cook the eggs, heavy cream, sugar lime zest and ginger over a double boiler until thickened. Cool over ice bath then add all the other ingredients. Once again cool mixture and put into your machine. It will be creamy and smooth and will also tame the ginger. I served it over individual pineapple upside down cakes with caramel sauce. It was a hit!

This was a very big hit with friends and family. I left the ginger quantity the same but grated on a ginger grater making sure to cut off any stringy accumlation so it was not in the finished product. To serve, I scraped the ice cream into soft shavings(it is a hard consistancy) using a wide flat spoon and topped it with fresh mango.

The amount of ginger is the main issue in this recipe, as too much ginger will give the ice cream a "burning" flavor that I find most people don't like. I may reduce the ginger, but otherwise I follow the recipe. I always find taking the ice cream out of the freezer 5-10 min. before serving makes it much easier to serve.

I left the ginger quantity the same, but increased the lime juice to 5 T. Taste was great, but texture very chewy due to ginger and maybe frozen bits of coconut milk. Not a good consistency, and when I put it in the freezer it is like a rock -- I guess because it's not the same type of fat as the recipes I have that only call for heavy cream.

I didn't think that ginger and lime would work with coconut but what a treat. I made this ice cream before I read the reviews and I got very lucky. I used only 1/2 the amount of grated ginger because it was all I had, I used heavy cream instead of half and half and key lime juice to make up for the one lime I had. I have to say, this is a definite do-over. The heavy cream made the texture creamy and the key lime added a hint of tartness that worked great with the comforting flavor of the coconut. The ginger added a little texture as well as spice. I forgot the mango but it is an excellent ending for a cuban or asian style meal

ok, seems you can't make this with low-fat coconut milk--i couldn't get it to freeze. the second time around (with regular coconut milk) it froze, but still not as creamy as ice-cream--more like sorbet, but the flavors were delicious.

For some reason, this tasted like a cross between soap and meat. I would not make it again.

Even though I like ginger , I cut back to just one TBS because I really wanted to taste the coconut. It was perfect , just a hint of ginger. I can imagine, that at the level the recipe calls for it would definetly be ginger ice cream . Great for a warm summer evening dinner

This was wonderful! BAsed on comments from other reviewers, I just squeezed the juice from the ginger. It gave it that ginger hotness without being overwhelming.

For some reason, my ice cream didn't thicken up well. The end result was more like ice milk circa 1979: not creamy at all. Any ideas? However, the flavour is really good. I followed the portions exactly. Yes, it does have a very strong ginger flavour, but we loved that.

Yummy! I love what the coconut milk adds -- it makes this one of the creamiest ice creams. I'll definitely be using coconut milk in other fruit-based ice creams. For this recipe, I took the advice of others and increased the lime juice & peel. I thought it turned out great, but did get some comments on the overwhelming ginger flavor...

What a fantastic way to make ice cream. I would definitely go with more lime juice, though.

This recipe is wonderful, but (and I'm taking the risk of stating the obvious here) this recipe is much more "ginger" than "lime." If you don't love ginger, you won't love this recipe.

Excellent! I made it for family and it was big hit. Extremely easy. The coconut makes it very creamy.

Oh, this one's a winner. Cool and refreshing for a wonderful summer dessert. I used fresh mango (which was the favorite) along with several other varieties of fresh fruit. A very impressive, easy, and tasteful recipe.
