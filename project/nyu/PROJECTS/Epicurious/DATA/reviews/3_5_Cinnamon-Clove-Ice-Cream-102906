I tell ya, I didn't care for this at all. It was too sweet and thick, way more like a frozen custard than ice cream. The clove flavor was completely gone and the cinnamon was really faint in the final product, even though I steeped both in the cream base overnight. I'm giving it two stars because my dinner guests loved it, but I wouldn't make again unless they asked me too.

This ice cream was perfect with the Apple tarts, but is a little strong on it's own.

I have made this ice cream each Thanksgiving for the past 3 years and it's a perennial favorite. I modify it slightly by adding other seasonal spices (allspice, nutmeg, cardamom--whatever I have, really) and allowing the milk/cream to steep overnight. This recipe is the perfect accompaniment to any pies other cooks are bringing to the party!

Outstanding! I've made quite a few ice creams in my time, and this is up there with the best. You'd hope so what with all of the yolks (I would usually use something like 2-4 with that amount of milk/cream), and it doesn't disappoint. I did halve the recipe and it worked just fine, even if I accidentally put all of the sugar into the cream, rather than divide it between the hot cream and the yolks. I too steeped the cream overnight, and with the sugar gaffe, I added the yolks to the cream as it was just coming warm on the stove. I've never had a problem with curdling a custard, but with this many yolks, I could see that it was quite sensitive to heat, and seemed like it would readily go over, as happened to one other reviewer.

The flavor of this ice cream was nice but the texture was awful. I've made dozens of recipes in my ice cream maker and have never had a problem before.

This ice cream was very good. I served it with the apple upside down cake and it was a wonderful match.

the creamiest ice cream i've ever made. i let the seasoned milk and cream mix steep for 5 hours in the fridge before adding in the yolks. Fantastic flavor, strong cinnamon flavor, but not too overbearing.

The flavor and texture of this ice cream is phenomonal. I liked the amount of cloves as written. We ate this with the Barefoot Contessa's plum tart. Really wonderful.

This stuff rocks. I make ice cream very frequently and I keep coming back to this recipe again and again (and again). It's fabulous!

Yum! Made a half recipe, worked fine. Used recommended spices and i think it could have had a bit more even. My custard curdled about two seconds after it seemed like it might be ready, and a friend advised saving it by whisking vigorously off the heat to recombine, which worked like a charm and saved the day. Served with some previously made banana ice cream, and the whole was even greater than the sum of the parts.

Easy and delicious. Serve with halved strawberries.

We prepared 9 batches of this for an elegant church dinner along with the tarts. We had prime rib, grilled veggies and garlic redskins. This was the perfect ending. Everyone felt this could stand alone in its own right as dessert. Those who don't use all those cloves are missing the best flavor.

This recipe is excellent, easy and rapid. Personnally, I prepared it the night before and left the cinnamon sticks simmer overnight in the cream, the flavor was fantastic ! And I served it with a phillo dough apple tart.

Had some of this as part of an apple tart dessert at Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas -- took a chance there was a similar recipe on Epicurious.com. This ice cream is so wonderful, so rich and creamy, it can stand on its own as dessert; however, I also chose to serve it alongside my apple and pumpkin pies at Thanksgiving. It's IN -- a new holiday tradition. I made it exactly as the recipe reads -- don't need to change a thing. Why tamper with perfection!

I made this frozen custard to go with Indian Pudding for a Christmas dinner dessert. It was a hit! Incredibly creamy and a subtly spicy flavor from the cinammon and cloves. I reduced the amount of clove and I was glad I did; my result was more balanced than if I had followed the recipe exactly. Also, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract which really rounded out the spice and sugar.

This was very good and creamy, excellent.

Made it without the cloves. Added a bit of ginger and a touch of nutmeg. Not only the best ice cream I've ever made, it was the best ice cream I've ever eaten!
