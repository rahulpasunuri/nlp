Family of 5 loved it but did change things up a bit. Basically equal amounts of tomato, cucumber and red onion (added this). Also substituted cilantro for the parsley as another reviewer did and added salt/pepper to taste.

Made this tonight. We didn't have parsley (don't like it too much) but we used cilantro. Great fresh taste. It needed salt and pepper which we added. We will make this again. Next time might add a little garlic.

A great summer salad. I made it as an side to go with the excellent Harissa-Marinated Top Sirloin tips from this site. Sprinkled with Sumac (an ingredient in Za'atar). Also good with the addition of diced ripe avocado.

Ditto with the chef from Boston. Delicious and served all over the middle east, including Israel. To the reviewer who takes such offense at this being called Israeli - really? It's a salad, not a statement on middle eastern politics. I think Israel, and north America have bigger problems than who owns the right to a salad.

I adore this simple salad. It is crisp and flavorful and easy. Kirby cucumbers worked welll

There is a recipe for za'atar on this site in the Tomato, Cucumber and Pita Salad recipe (just click on za'atar) for some reason it doesn't pull up in the recipe search by itself. It's yummy on pita brushed with olive oil.

I made as listed, however, I was wondering about 1 review that stated you could use green grapes, cherries, or crisp radishes for a variation. Question is, which or all?

nice, simple, light, no-fault recipe to start a day in a tasty, refreshing way..and very flexible, as in throw in cherries, tomatoes, green grapes, or crisp radishes and create a brand new variation
