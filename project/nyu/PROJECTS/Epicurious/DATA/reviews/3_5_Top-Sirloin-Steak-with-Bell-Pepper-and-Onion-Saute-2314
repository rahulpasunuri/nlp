This is a simple and yummy recipe. Plus, you can make it low sodium by using low sodium broth.

We really liked this. I did not have onions but I added mushrooms and broccoli and it was really nice. The broth was a little watery but I just omitted some of it when serving. I also used the leftover marinade for the beef in the vegetables. Cheese made it exceptional, but you do not need a lot. Served with brown rice.

Nothing extraordinary about anything in this recipe separately, but the sum of the parts is great! The cheese is the essential ingredient, although some of us used a spiced feta, which was also excellent, since I only had a few small cubes of blue cheese on hand.

reallly tasty while simple enough for any evening. The cheese made the dish.

it's a nice, easy dish, worth making again, but the marinade is standard stuff, the grilling/broiling was common and the bell pepper saute is good. the bleu cheese topping was unique, especially as a finish. but there was nothing truly spectacular about it.

Initially sounded very plain, but the flavor of the cheese with the steak turned out quite surprisingly tasty!

i used orange bell peppers instead and it was delicious!! the sauce didn't thicken the way i thought it would though. the gorgonzola definitely makes the dish special so use abundantly.

3.5 Forks. Made this a couple nights ago and my boyfriend and I LOVED it - One of his favorite ways to prepare tenderloin. The goat cheese makes the entire dish - and cheese compliments the Beaujolais perfectly. We will definetly make this again.

I thought that this was only okay. It tasted fine, but it was nothing special.

I made this for my hubby's birthday. He absolutely gobbled it!! The blue cheese/onion/pepper flavors were WONDERFUL together! It is fairly quick and a definite winner. Will make again and again.

Easy, great tasting and looking. I may use three samll peppers in the future and add a yellow pepper for more color.

This dish was excellent. I added a lemon garlic butter sauce to the meat before I added the onions and bell peppers and it was incredible. My girlfriend who doesn't like onions or any veggies, kept eating all the onions and bell peppers. I will make this dish again very soon.

Little effort, great reward -- my husband loved it! I made it with petite sirloins and they were beyond tender. This will probably become a regular in our house.

Again, I'd like a rating that includes halves -- I'd rate the taste at 2-1/2 and the presentation as 4+. It's beautiful.

I was surprised by how much my husband and I liked this recipe. It seemed so simple but was very good. I substituted slices of parmesan cheese because I had no gorganzola and it was still great. Will definately make again.

I would definitely make this meal again. It is always a good sign when your guests ask for seconds; with this meal several had a third serving.

I thought it was just so-so. i would not add chicken or beef broth to the veggies. I would also soften the cheese to make easy to put on all the pieces of meat

It not only tasted great, but was relatively fast and easy to prepare. I also like the fact that the gorgazola is added at the last minute to the dish since I can add it to my husband's serving and leave it off on mine.
