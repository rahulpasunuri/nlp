When selecting blade steaks, select those with the least amount of gristle down the middle. We have enjoyed this sauce with rib steaks as well. We were surprised at how well the white wine worked. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested doubling the sauce.

Mmmm... buttery wine sauce poured over a great cut of steak. First time using chuck steak, but recipe was right on. Great flavor. Took 10 min, start to finish. Will become a regular "fast food" in my kitchen. Note that the 3 min cooking time per side does produce a very medium rare steak, but that's to my taste. If not yours, recommend cooking a bit longer per side (maybe 4 min?) for medium and medium well.

My family loved this recipe. I did make modifications. I used red wine instead of white and scallions instead of a shallot. I ended up using slightly more wine. I served this with mashed potatoes mixed with sauteed porcini mushrooms and garlic. It was wonderful! A definite favorite.

A very good recipe and quick and easy! The flavor of the sauce was rich and complemented the beef very well. I used red wine as per the advice of other reviewers.

I scored the tops, as other blade steak recipes recommend, and marinated them in a little mushroom soy sauce and red wine for an hour. Used red wine instead of white and scallion whites instead of shallot. The chives and parsley, butter and wine do make an exceptional sauce, and the steaks were surprisingly tender and tasty.

Can't tell you how many times I've made this already within a few months, but it's delicious! Have even tried the finish product on a bed of lettuce with tomato, onion, & a little bit of cheese. Used the Herb Wine sauce as a dressing - Fabulous!!!

As per many other comments, I had a rough time finding the cut of meat. Used a nice tenderloin instead. Also tried both with white and with red wine. I preferred red. Also, I doubled the sauce and then used the extra to saute some mushrooms. Definitely a keeper!

I'm not a steak eater but my husband is. I made this for him, used red wine since I didn't have any white, added mushrooms, and he raved on and on about the sauce. He actually said this was the best steak dish I've ever made him. Will definitely make this for him again.

Help. My sauce is a bit thin and salty. Did anyone use cream to thicken the sauce? Thanks.

This has become a regular dish at our house. I didnt have any trouble finding this cut of meat and it was very tender. We added some mushrooms which made it even better. Outstanding!

Though simple, this sauce is very good. I suggest using a better cut of meat, even tenderloin. I doubled the sauce because the recipe is a little skimpy for sauce lovers. The sauce is 4 forks-the cut of meat, less.

I love this recipe. Instead of Chuck Blade, I use Newport Steaks (easier to find and a great cut for cheap). It has definitely made it into our weekly rotation.

These are very easy to find in the grocery stores were I live. I guess I'm really lucky because these are a wonderfully flavored cut of meat at a very affordable price. They are best when marinated for a couple of hours!

Dear Gourmet, you should tell us that there are only two chuck blade steaks on the whole danged cow ... not easy to access in supermarkets or meat markets or anywhere else ... except maybe in a stockyard?
