I used less cinamon (1/2 tsp) and added 1 Tbsp Vanilla, 1/4 cup Maple Syrup, and 1/4 cup Bourbon to the butter mixture. I also used toasted pecans in stead of almonds. Very delicious.

Made this for Thanksgiving for a table of 20 or so. I doubled the recipe. I used roasted/salted pecans from Trader Joe's (could never imagine almonds), and it was a HUGE hit. Everybody LOVED it! Will certainly make again without hesitation.

This has become a staple in my family. It's sweet enough to satisfy everyone who has a sweet tooth, but yet not at all overpowering for those who don't. It's one of the simplest recipes for our Thanksgiving, as it really doesn't require much more effort after peeling and chopping the potatoes. I choose not to use the slivered almonds, simply because I'm not a fan, but please do use fresh nutmeg as the pre-ground stuff just doesn't compare.

My family loved this recipe...very yummy! I agree that it is so delicious it could be served as a dessert! First, I washed, peeled, sliced, and boiled the yams for about 10-15 minutes to soften it a bit, then followed the recipe exactly. I only had about 1/4 of the yams left over in the dish by the time dinner was over ;) I'm definitely making these yams for Thanksgiving :)

FYI - this is NOT vegetarian - just an FYI for anyone with vegetarian guests, marshmallows have gelatin with is from hooves, connective tissue, etc. you can buy vegetarian marshmallows, but they don't melt as well. Even without, it's delish!

I was asked to make sweet potato's for Thanksgiving. I was told there had to be marshmallow's with it as that is what my brother-in-law expected. I looked and looked and finally found this recipe. It was a hit, everyone in the family loved it (especially my brother-in-law) and I know that I will now be obligated to make them every year. I do have to say I over cooked the sauce, and now I know not to, but despite that they turned out really good.

Wow! Since becoming a vegetarian I thought I had to give up recipes with marshmallows. But after finding the vegan "Dandies" at Whole Foods, I was eager to make this dish. Although I found the initial taste a little mild, after adding the marshmallows it turned out with just the right amount of sweetness. I'm not a big fan of almonds with sweet potatoes, so I subbed pecans instead. Fabulous!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. When melting the sugar and bringing to a boil---don't overcook the sauce or it will crystalize and become difficult to mix into the sweet potatoes.

I'm not a fan of this part of the Thanksgiving dinner, but one of my friends had to have it, so I searched around for a recipe. I don't have an electric mixer, so I was hoping for something that didn't require a puree. This totally did the trick! I layered the marshmallows on like you would for the traditional casserole, and no one was disappointed there wasn't a mash underneath. I omitted the almonds because I used them as a topping for the green bean casserole (instead of onions -- another hit!). I'm bookmarking this one for next year.

All I can say is Y-U-M! This is a new twist on what is for my family a classic Thanksgiving dish. This totally updates sweet potatoes and elevates them from the 1960's "half a marshmallow per potato slice" version I've been used to for 30+ years at my annual family dinner. I was taking a bit of a risk messing with the classic "comfort food" version we were all used to, have loved, and have come to just expect at our turkey dinner - we all know how disastrous messing with expectations, tradition and classics in anything can be, but people in my family can get seriously attached to holiday food! On year my Mom served mashed sweet potatoes and you'd think she started world war 3-no joke! So I was a little hesitant, but right after it came out of the oven with the crusty marshmallows all melty on top my family just started raving and raving about how great this dish tastes and looks. I highly recommend giving this a try if you're stuck in the 60's rut and want a change in your dish but not a vast leap from familiarity!

Excellent!! It was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family. My only mistake was that after pulling it out of the oven I kept the foil on and hit the road for our friends' house.

This turned out great, but it was missing one BIG ingredient... real VANILLA. I've seen vanilla added to quite a few other recipes and it compliments the cinnamon and nutmeg so nicely, I couldn't leave it out! Just add a splash when making the sauce. I also didn't use the almonds- I guess it's a texture thing I don't like about it.

This recipe has become a Thanksgiving staple in my family. It'll be on our table this year too! I like mixing up different types of sweet potatoes - I often combine 2lbs of American sweet potatoes with 2lbs of Japanese (or Korean) sweet potatoes.

Made this last Thanksgiving and it was so good I've made it several times since. I like it more spicy, so I use 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp each of cloves, allspice, and nutmeg, and use a full tsp of salt to balance out the sweet. I've found that all kinds of nuts go well on top, not just almonds.

Rating: 2
While the spices added a different twist, the proportions of ingredients made this a little too overly sweet. I'd suggest using half fresh (boiled or roasted) and half canned, using the canning juice. Add a splash or two of red wine, butter, brown sugar, and a bit of maple syrup. Cover with marshmallows and almonds under the broiler.

Agggh! Can America possibly add anything else to sweeten its dishes? Why does everything have to be so loaded with sugar? And this is coming from a Baker and LOVER of desserts. I just think that adding marshmallows is going overboard. I've made this every Thanksgiving for 3 or 4 years now, without the marshmallows, and it is out of this world. I usually have to cook it a little longer and thought that adding some oj, as one cook suggested, may be a good thing to try this year.

I just sat down to prepare my Thanksgiving menu and found that I didn't have this recipe. I've been making it since it originally appeared and everyone looks forward to having it, it's that good.

After making this recipe for the very first time in 1999, I knew I'd found the holy grail of Thanksgiving sweet potato recipes. Every year everyone begs for it, and many people who don't even like sweet potatoes love it. I make it exactly as written, but have a guilty secret. Instead of marshmallows, I use 1/2 pound of See's scotch kisses (homemade marshmallows wrapped in caramel). I can't say enough good things about this recipe, but I do recommend making it the day you plan yo serve it. If you're unable to get scotchmallos, it's still a winner with regular marshmallos

When I told my friend I was thinking of doing a different sweet potato recipe she gasped in horror! I was relieved, as this is my favorite dish but I was wondering if the marshmallows were becoming to juvenile - good to know, they're not. Great tip about the sugar mixture coming to a boil as I've had the 'toffee' syndrome and didn't know why.

Rating: 4
I just made this for the first time and have added it to my recipe file for future use! The spices were delicious with the sweet potatoes. I added about 3/4 cup orange juice overall into the sugar mixture in order to make more sauce. This recipe held well in the oven. I think it even improved by being held at low temperature in the oven for over an hour while other parts of the meal were finishing up. The extra time seemed to help the glaze soak into the potatoes and the potatoes did not turn to complete mush. I will definately make this again for a crowd!

This is a great recipe. For those of you who ended up with toffee as the syrup, you simply cooked the sugar too long and it went to the candy stage. Be careful to only cook until sugar dissolves and reaches a boil, you should be stirring constantly. Remove and pour over s.p. Also, I bake the sweet potatoes first to a semi-soft consistency and then cut into pieces. I usually look for long thin potatoes that will slice nicely. This is a great recipe that I use over and over again. thanks

Rating: 4
This was a tremendous hit. I didn't make it exactly as the recipe stated because I screwed up when I was melting the sugar, and I either got it too hot or something else went awry. Anyway, I wound up with my sugar hardening and cracking on my potatoes. I salvaged the mess by pounding the hardened sugar into bits, sort of like toffee. Then, I mixed a little more butter with brown sugar and cinnamon and salt, melted it, and poured it all over the potatoes, mixing in my toffee bits. Everything else, I did as stated. I did need a bit more salt than was called for, however. Even non-sweet potato eaters went bonkers for it.

I been making this since 2000 so I've made some changes over the years. I leave off the marshmallows simply because I don't like them and serve the nuts on the side because of allergies. I also boil the potatoes first then cut and mash them, then pour the syrup over them and bake. Amazing and gets rave reviews EVERY time.

I like to prepare as much as possible on Wednesday (so I can watch my Lions, which can be painful). The day before, I prepare and cook for about 45 minutes, cool and then refrigerate. I then put back into the 375 oven for 15 minutes, then at 500 for the remainder. This is easier for those with one oven.

I have made this dish several times and they are always a hit. My husband loves it so much, he makes extra just so we have leftovers for the next day. The sugar syrup does caramelize quickly once it is poured on the potatoes, but you don't have to coat every inch of the potatoes. As the potatoes bake, the syrup liquifies and flows nicely over the potatoes. I have never added water and the potatoes come out fine. I have doubled the syrup recipe because I like it more syrupy. All in all - this is a yummy dish that could substitute for dessert any day.

I have been making this recipe for the last 4 years and it is hands down the best (everyone always wants the recipe). BUT, I make changes! (How original....) I see there are quite a few variations that others have suggested, so here is still yet another! For starters, I double the "sauce" recipe (reduce the butter a bit -- who needs all that fat?) and add Karo syrup (dark, light, brown sugar... whatever I have on hand)-- I add enough Karo to reach the "consistency" that I want. I then follow directions per recipe (so easy -- a make-ahead dream). I do not add marshmallows (not my style!) and add whole pecan halves instead of almonds. Beautiful presentation and awesome taste enjoyed by both young and old, picky, discerning, and otherwise!

After trying many different sweet potato recipes over the years, I've reverted back to this tried and true recipe.

I was looking for a traditional but more delicious than my mom's (shhh! don't tell!) recipe for our sweet potatoes this Thanksgiving when I ran onto this recipe online. It was my favorite part of the meal! It wasn't far different from the ones my mom used to serve, but the spices put it over the top. So yummy! This dish is sweet, but I like that with the turkey and a savory dressing. I'll be serving it again next year, and I'll hope that it becomes a tradition in our family.

Deeee-Lish! I used pecans instead of almonds. The syrup does not seem to coat all the pieces but it is not a problem once it is cooked. I will make this every year.

This recipe was the closest to the one my sister uses. She uses granulated brown sugar (dissolves more easily), adds some water (so as to have more of a moist syrup at the end). I added water because otherwise the sugar mixture formed a paste that did not coat the potatoes well. I skipped the marshmallows and nuts since I like sweet potatoes by themselves. I found that it took twice as long for the dish to bake compared to this recipe. The potatoes were tender at 50 minutes but still tasted raw/starchy. But the end result was well received.

Terrific dish! I cut the potatoes and tossed them with the glaze the day before, covered the dish with foil, then put the whole casserole in the oven (bring to room temp first) on Thanksgiving day. It couldn't have been easier! I don't see why you would resort to canned yams, this dish really isn't difficult to prepare. I was about to add the marshmallows and nuts, but at the last minute I just left them out because the dish seemed pretty perfect without them (and it was). The only downside is that this dish does not reheat well. Leftovers were not as impressive as the day they came right out of the oven.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Even those who made snide remarks about the marshmallow topping thought it was great once they tasted it. There is no need to add water to this recipe. By melting (and boiling) the sugar and butter mixture, you are indeed creating a carmel type glaze that coats the sweet potatoes perfectly, and when covered and baked they come out tender and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

What??? How do you boil this mixture with NO WATER!!! Did I miss something?? I had to make the topping twice because it carmelized when there was no water in the pan.... There is NO WAY the potatoes would have cooked without adding water....not to mention that amount of topping wouldn't have covered all of the potatoes...weird! Anyway, once I added about 1 1/2-2 cups of water to the mixture and then brought to a boil they turned out AMAZING and were such a hit at Thanksgiving! My mother-in-law said it was the best recipe she has ever tasted and I sent her home with the recipe. Very delicious

We've been making this recipe since it first came out and there would be riots if we stopped. We "cheated" this past Thanksgiving, though, and used canned, peeled sweet potatos.

Except those of us who cut 2 hours off of the prep time - a change for the better.

I just made this recipe for a Holiday office potluck and could not believe the people who wanted the recipe!!! I modified it a little bit - no marshmallows, a tad more ginger (1/4 tsp) a pinch of ground cloves, and toasted the almonds before adding makes a huge difference. I also recommend squeezing the juice of a fresh orange to the sauce while cooking - the citrus is hardly noticed but adds a nice zing and cuts the heaviness of the butter. It was a tad dry for the crock pot, so I added some butter and brown sugar to keep it moist. The most unbelievable yams I've ever had!!!! This will be my lifetime candied yam recipe for sure!!

This is what candied yams are all about! I didn't do the marshmallows, but if you like them, this would be an excellent sugar kick! We loved them!

This was a great dish! I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes but this dish made them quite tasty. Skip the marshmallows to lessen the sweetness and they are still wonderful!

My oldest daughter and I both loved this dish but we always love sweet potatoes! My husband and youngest daughter are the sweet potatoe "haters" in the family. After tasting this recipe, we now have two sweet potatoe converts in the family--but only with this recipe!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was simply delicious (and I don't really like sweet potatoes). I prepared everything the day before, let it sit in the fridge overnight, and baked it the next day. Next time I make it though, I don't think I'll add the marshmallows (a bit too sweet).

This was my first Thanksgiving and my Mother-law normally makes the sweet potato dish. This was amazing!!! It was far more better then her's and my Husband couldn't get enough of it. This will be a stable to our family's side dish for the holidays. Thank you Epicurious!

Dish had very good flavor, but a bit too sweet for my liking. I'll make it again, probably with a bit less brown sugar.

We made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was delicious. We needed a recipe without eggs, as my grandmother is a vegan. In fact we ommited the marshmellow and nuts and it was still tasty. We boiled the potatoes and mashed them slightly before adding the sauce.

Everyone enjoyed this dish. Next time I will try Pittsburg's advice and boil the sweet potatoes and prepare the dish the day before. (this should also make it easier to cut the potatoes) This recipe is a keeper.

Everyone wants this recipe. Instead of almonds I toasted pecan pieces and then tossed the hot nuts with salt and butter two days before. I think that the salty nuts were a nice contrast to the sweet sauce and marshmallows.

I wanted a traditional sweet potatoe recipe and this was very easy to make and the flavors blended well. I let the cut potatoes marinade in the sauce overnight then cooked it. Watch over the marshmallows and almond topping because it browns very fast. A Thanksgiving keeper!!!

An easy and excellent dish! I made this the night before with the exception of the final last 20 minutes in the oven. I also doubled the sweet potatoes and quadrupled the sauce! For Thanksgiving I just popped them in the oven for 20 minutes/then added marshmallows and almonds and put them in the oven for another 5 minutes. They were incredible. Everyone loved them and several people asked for the recipe.

This was SOOOO good! The potatoes were soft, but held their shape well, the glaze was delicious, and...who doesn't like some melted, browned marshmallows??? I would not change one thing. I did transfer it to a smaller dish after baking, though. Since it is now the day after Thanksgiving, I can also add that it reheats well, too. YUM! I will add this to my sides list year round. It's just so good!

We started making this the year it first appeared in Bon Appetite and it has become part of nearly every Thanksgiving and Christmas ever since. It is a frequently requested recipe.

We all love this. It's become a tradition over the past 5 years. I even prefer to make this a day ahead, add the almonds then transfer it to a prettier dish and heat up before adding the marshmellows. Enjoy!

I made this recipe a few years ago for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! This is far better than ordinary mashed with marshmallows. I look forward to making them again this Thanksgiving! Really loved having them for leftovers the next day too! Thanks!

YUM!!! We made this for Christmas dinner and one guest who doesn't even like sweet potatoes even asked for second helpings! We have made it several times since then just for ourselves. I like fewer marshmallows and more almonds.

fabulous dish. Everyone will have seconds. I baked the potatos in the 13x9 pan at first, but then transfered them to a square baking dish ( it just looked better)

This is a great recipe that can easily be adapted into a 'make ahead' dish, without compromising taste or quality. First, boil the sweet potatoes until fork tender, then put them in a baking dish and pour the sauce over. You can refrigerate them (covered with foil)up to two days. When ready to serve, reheat in oven and top with marshmallows/nuts as directed.

I've made this twice - the second time without marshmellows and my whole family loves it.

Have made a dish similar to this before, but this version is absolutely fabulous. Everyone had seconds! Can highly recommend it and will definitely make this a holiday table must every year.

I have tried lots of sweet potatoes recipes, and this one is the best by far. Next time I'm not going to add the marshmallows. It was a tad bit too sweet. I also subbed pecans instead which were fine.

This was my first time making sweet potatoes, and I don't think I'll need to try another recipe again. The nutmeg, diced almonds and ginger add so much. Everyone, even those that weren't fond of sweet potatoes enjoyed the dish very much.

Received recipe from my daughter, and it was a great hit. For one thing, it was not "glucky." For another, it is a handsome dish. Used yams (Beauregard) as they tend to hold their shapes very well. Thank you!

Tried this for Thanksgiving, for a crowd of "Traditonalists" and won the heart of everyone. Even my 2 1/2 year old ate it - Now that's a rave!

Delicious. The potatoes turned out creamy and nicely browned. When I melted the sugar and butter, it turned into candy, but it melted into a nice sauce with time in the oven.

I made this for Thanksgiving, 1st itme, I did not like the almonds on top, sauce was tasty, mamybe I should have cooked potatoes more?? I don't know whether I would make again, Help!!

Easy and loved by all - what more can you ask? I like the idea that the reviwer from New York had to include rum and vanilla in the sauce; I will try that next time. Enjoy!

I just made this dish for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. My husband normally will not eat sweet potatos but he just loved this. He even got seconds! I will definitely make this dish again. I guarantee I'll be making this before next Thanksgiving.

I used this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving. Family members that do not normally like sweet potatoes ranted and raved over this dish. It was great for the kids as well as the adults.

This is really a great dish. I however cook the potatoes longer than called for, they have a much better consistency if you go for about 70 minutes. I also add rum, and vanilla on occasion to the syrup. All depends on your own tastes, but the base recipe is a winner.

Whenever I make sweetpotatoes, I always use this recipe. It has been used by my family for many years and will continue to be a part of our Thanksgiving tradition.

This is a scrumptious recipe! It was the hit of my office potluck and easy to prepare. I added a few tablespoons of ameretto prior to baking to enhance the almond flavor. I made it the nite before and reheated well.

I cannot believe I found this recipe once again after loosing my Bon Appetit magazine. I was rather upset at the thought of not being able to make this again. Thank you for having it on-line. THIS DISH IS FABULOUS!!!
