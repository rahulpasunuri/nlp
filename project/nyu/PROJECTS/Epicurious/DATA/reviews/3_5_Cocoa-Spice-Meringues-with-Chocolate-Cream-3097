Only made the cookie part and they were fantastic and stayed fresh in an air tight container for a week. I found them to be a bit sweet and will cut down on the sugar in the future but even with the bold spices my 4yo loved them.

I only made the meringues, but I though they had too much of the spices especially nutmeg. I made another recipe using half the spices, and increased the cocoa to 4 tablespoons, and liked that much better.

A rare four forks from me because it was easy, tastes sensational, can be made in advance without difficult assembly, travels well, presents beautifully, and makes me look like a professional! I too made this as desert for my chocoholic friend's birthday lunch. It was greeted with so much raving and scoffing I am still laughing! Both the meringue and chocolate cream components could be used for other purposes, like filling pastry, or making little meringues for decorating a chocolate cake. An excellent recipe that I can't wait to make and share again.

I made this as a Christmas recipe, and instead of making a multi-layered formal dessert, I piped the meringue into small individual rounds with a sort of hollow in the middle, and piped the cream into the hole after baking. One recipe worth of cream was enough to fill two batches of meringues. People went berserk and thought for sure I must have bought them. My chocoholic sister loved them, a true test. I was also surprised how long they lasted before starting to crumble.
