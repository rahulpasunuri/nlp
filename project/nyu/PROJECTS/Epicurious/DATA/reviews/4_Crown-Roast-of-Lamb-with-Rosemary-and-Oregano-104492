I have been using this recipe for years with some variations. We first made it for the holidays following it as written. Now we usually use some form of the rub, sometimes subbing thyme for oregano or using dried herbs instead. We also found grilling is easiest and just as good if not better.

Served for Christmas; really good. Substituted thyme for oregano. Marinated over night w/ spices. My oven temp is accurate; I took everyone's advise, though, and cooked lamb 5 minutes longer - wish I hadn't. However, there were a few pink pieces. I got meat at Stater Brothers. Costco (which I love), did not have nice racks of lamb when I was shopping. I did double the spices and used a lot more olive oil than was called for. Next time I'm going to do the gravy and mashed potatoes. I made the Medley of Root Vegetables from Bon Appetit's November 2001 issue (easy and great success).

Fantastic. Easy, fragrant, delicious, and well-received. Love it. Took 45 min. for medium in my oven. I strongly suggest marinated meat for a couple hours first. We put par-boiled redskin potatoes in the center of the crown. Lovely.

Don't be misled by the other reviews. If your oven thermometer reads 450 when you put the meat in, you must be careful not to overcook it. The size of the racks is probably an important consideration in this, too, so start checking at 20 minutes and hover nearby until it reaches your desired doneness. Also, I ground the rosemary and oregano with Malabar peppercorns and kosher salt and let the meat rest for a couple of hours before cooking. The spices permeated the meat beautifully.

Made this for Thanksgiving! It was very time consuming, especially since I was also making a turkey, dressing, mac and cheese, lobster bisque... But it was awesome. Our family eats pork well, so additional cooking time was needed and my dinner was about 40 minutes late. But this was AMAZING!

At more than $13 per lb, the crown rack of lamb has to be perfect and this recipe helped to make it so. The rub mix was made as indicated except that we substituted thyme for the oregano, and added the juice of 2 lemon slices to help hold it together. There was enough mix to cover the inside and outside of the crown (made from two 8-chop racks tied together). Considerable fat needed to be trimmed from the inside of the crown before cooking. We cooked it for 40 minutes. Probably the best Christmas family dinner and lamb we've ever eaten.

I had an x-mas party for my Jewish friends... and this receipe just blew them away.It does need the longer cooking time, but it's as easy as chopping a few fresh herbs.

This recipe is so easy and tastes great! I agree with other reviewers that it needs to be cooked longer. I cooked it for 45 min for medium. The only down-side to the recipe is that lamb is so expensive. Next time I will go to Costco like the other reviewers suggested.

I tried this on a few chops before spending the money on the crown roast - and the results were great. I substituted thyme for the oregano. The dish was elegant and quite fragrant. A modernized classic dish.

I've made this twice in the last few months and still get wonderful comments about the meal from the different guest. It's simple to make and the end result presents beautifully. I learned after the first time to take other readers suggestions and cook longer than the recipe calls for (and I like my meat pinker than most).

This recipe is fast, easy and best of all delicious. We have made it several times and it always brings rave reviews from our guests.

To repeat the comments below: 35 minutes will take the lamb in this recipe to about medium; anything less than that and the meat is very bloody and rare. People don't really seem to enjoy rare lamb. Both times I've made this I've had guests eagerly accept my offer to put the lamb back in the oven for another 10 minutes (and that's after I've had it in 35). So cook the meat longer than the recipe says, but otherwise, enjoy the fabulous lamb with the exquisite seasoning. I never liked lamb. I never made it for guests. This recipe changes all that.

Excellent for parties. Got 2 crown roasts from Sam's, increased spices by 1/2, served one roast filled with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and the other with snowpeas w/roasted bell pepper. They were presented together on a large platter and received extremely well.

We tried this recipe for New Years Eve 2002. It was absolutely fantastic. We are lamb lovers from way back, but I don't think we have tasted any lamb as good as done in this recipe.

Having two huge bushes of rosemary in my yard, this recipe is a great find. Normally, I just put plain rosemary on my lamb chops, but this is a good upgrade and not much work. I just put everything in the food processor. I substituted dried Oregano (instead of fresh) and it tasted fine to me. Probably it is even better w/fresh Oregano, but didn't want to make an extra trip to the store (had everything else on hand). For the reviewer who felt the lamb was too expensive, I recommend a Costco membership for this one. I was able to buy each rack (8 chops each) for about $10-$11 each. I didn't bother tying into a crown roast, just put them flat on the broiler pan. And, it was the most tender lamb I've ever had. We have a gourmet grocery store here in Arizona called AJ's and they have fantastic meats (and would probably charge $110 as you paid). I really do think that Costco's meats are just as good, though (and I wouldn't say that about any of the other supermarkets like Safeway, Fry's, etc.) Anyway, great dish and highly recommended. It will definitely become a regular for us.

I added grated parmesan to the mix, it was extraordinary. A very luxurious dish, I served it at a fancy dinner party and was roundly considered a goddess.

The roast was delicious. Next time I would make more of the herb mixture to ensure no scimping on the coating. I, like the other reviewers, found that cooking time was much longer than indicated and much longer than the butcher advised. It could really throw timing off on a dinner party. I also wonder whether $110 I paid for a 16-chop roast was market rate; it seemed awfully high to me.

Made it for New Year's Eve. Fabulous and best of all, easy. Prepped the evening before like others. I had my butcher tie three racks into one crown. The only downside was the cost of the lamb but it was worth every penny.

Wonderful and so easy to prepare. I marinated the lamb for 36 hours. Would definitely make again.

I have not yet tried this recipe. I saw this dish prepared on the TV show. It looks wonderful, and sounded easy, so I thought I might try it. However, I am disappointed that the instructions for preparation and the recipe are not the same as that on the TV program. Specifically, the instructions for the vegetables included in the preparation on TV are not here, nor are the specific steps for preparing the meat. Therefore, I will refer to my cookbooks and not use your recipe. In the future, I probably will not take the time to explore your website, for lack of all the information needed.

This recipe was wonderful. I served this dish to a group of friends at a dinner party. It was a great success. Will do it again. For medium rare I cooked the roast for 35 - 40 minutes and it came out perfect. I also served with the epicurious mint chutney recipe - it also got great reviews from my guests.

Made this with just one rack of lamb to serve 2 people. I cut the remainder of the ingredients to 1/4 of the original and roasted at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. It was truly wonderful!!!

I served this with creamy mashed potatoes, and truly delicous gravy, made from the cooking juices of the lamb: fabulous! My parents said that I should make this more often, and it's nice to think that next year when I leave for college I won't just be living on take aways!

This is a fabulous, easy to prepare recipe. I served this on Easter and got rave reviews. I actually prepped it the night before so it could marinate in the wonderful herbs, and then cooked it as specified the next day. This may become my new Easter tradition!

This was OUTSTANDING!! Everyone loved it - even the non-lamb lovers. As the previous reviewer noted, it took closer to an hour to cook it to medium doneness, so plan accordingly.

Have I lost the ability to read, or does this recipe not include the stuffing of ground lamb in the center as mentioned by the editor?

I took the other cook's recommendation and served this with wild mushroom and leek soup. The lamb was absolutely fantastic. I made enough for 10 people, even though I was only serving 2--it's a good thing, because we had seconds and finished off the rest the next day! It was absolutely fantastic and I will never need another lamb recipe!

Used 3 racks of lamb in lieu of the crown roast for our Christmas Eve dinner...... delicious! The lamb was moist, pink and very flavorful -- everyone loved it including our 7 year old! Preceded by Wild Mushroom Soup (also from Bon Appetit) and accompanied by asparagus, a zuchini/squash/red pepper medley, new potatoes and the Pear, Arugula & Endive Salad (Bon Appetit, December 2000).... the meal couldn't have been much better -- or simpler to prepare.
