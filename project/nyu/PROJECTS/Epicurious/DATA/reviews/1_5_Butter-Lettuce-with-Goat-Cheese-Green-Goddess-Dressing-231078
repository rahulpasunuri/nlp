Rather dull.

I couldn't wait until this recipe was posted so I could warn others away from it and spare them the expensive disappointment we experienced. With the great indgredients I thought it would be great, but I've had bottled dressings that were much better. Bland, bland, bland. Oh - and to the previous poster, fresh soft goat cheese is a much different item then feta.

Hi, I haven't made the recipe, but i find it hard to believe any dish with feta was bland, make sure you buy authentic greek-style feta, otherwise it's true, it tastes like nothing

I would make this again, with some additions, a bit more garlic. My Goodness, Mary, perhaps this site is not good enough for you! Your poor online manners leave A LOT to be desired.

What a waste of ingredients. I kept adding more salt but to no avail. I too ended up dumping the large amount left over, down the sink.

Goodness, Mary - you sure are rude to the other cooks on this site. I made the dish, and also thought it was nothing to write home about (I'm an experienced professional chef.) A bit of sea salt helped. Mary's vitriol did not!

I made this before reading the reviews. I guess other people had as much luck as I did. I added some lemon juice and black pepper but it seemed sort of blah.

Not worth making again.....even after adding some garlic, white pepper, etc.. it was still very blah.

Considering all the wonderful, flavorful ingredients in this I was surprised that it was so bland and flavorless. I used herbed garlic goat cheese for an added oomph, but it was really dull and boring. I threw the rest of it out. Very disappointing.
