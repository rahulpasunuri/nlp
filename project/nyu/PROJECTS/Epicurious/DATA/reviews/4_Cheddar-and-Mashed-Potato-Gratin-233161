The word "tasteless" refers to what appeared to be a joke about the homeless, not the dish, Denver. SMH

Loved this! I stirred in some of the cheddar into the potato mixture along with some ricotta cheese. Used dried herbs and heavy cream instead of whole milk. After adding the cheddar to the top I drizzled a little butter and sprinkled on a thin layer of panko. Also, used pancetta instead of regular bacon. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!!!!!

Vegetarians, I substituted two tablespoons of butter and a cup of sliced mushrooms for the bacon. Also substituted buttermilk for the whole milk, since I had it on hand. Yummy way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.

Excellent! Easy to make. Used turkey pastrami instead of bacon since that is what I had. Can be made ahead and then just placed in oven to heat.

I discovered the recipe searching for a way to use up leftovers. It was an sutstanding way to use leftover mashed potatoes. I had to use dry herbs to avoid a trip to the store but they made the potatoes taste wonderful. I will plan for this dish next time I make it and use fresh herbs instead. My family loves a nice crunch with dishes that have been topped with cheese so I sprinkled it with panko bread crumbs before baking and toasted the crumbs in the broiler before serving. It was a hit.

This was a great way to use leftovers and give them new life. My family loved the shallot flavor and it was a big hit. Will make this one again for sure!

A little tip... add bacon and let the cheese char a little bit... This dish is da bomb!

These were OK. They needed a little more flavor though. I dont really understand the reviews...why did the one reviewer who thought that it was tasteless give it 4 stars? I guess I'll know what to serve at my next buffet dinner for the homeless, only I will add some spice.

I made this for Thanksgiving when the person who usually brings potatoes couldn't come. I put it together the night before except for the cheese. The next day I added some additional milk and stirred it up, then added the cheese and baked as directed. It was great. Only thing is I would take it out of the refrigerator at least 1/2 hour before cooking because it is very dense and takes a while to get heated thoroghly

I didn't have chives or fresh herbs on hand and so I used leeks. Since we can't find cheddar cheese here in Italy, I used fontina. My VERY Italian husband loved this. I was looking for an alternative for left-over mashed potatoes and I will surely make this again.

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and it was truly delicious! I will definitely make it again. It was a big hit at my dinner party.

Made this last nite for Christmas Eve. Everyone really liked it, personally I thought a bit dry. Would add a little more milk maybe. Nice variation from reg. mashed.

why does the above review seem like a joke and therefore tasteless?!?

Hearty, filling, easy, and good. Can be made in huge quantities so is a marvelous choice to serve at buffets for guests who are homeless.
