This was SOOOOO good! I did a few things just a little different based on other reviewers' suggestions-I blanched the asparagus for about a minute, added more dijon mustard and a splash of white wine vinegar, and threw some diced tomatoes on top for color. Outstanding!!!

Great and simple recipe. Was a hit at my party yesterday. Used spinach as watercress was not particular good at the store and parboiled the asparagus as suggested. Will definitely be making this again

Really good but overshadowed by the couscous salad with red peppers and corn I also got from this site that I served at the same meal. I's all in the dressing--the asparagus, radish and mushroom combo is a winner but it needed more zip. Super easy to make, which I always appreciate (and don't expect from this site).

Great recipe. Easy and delicious. Served at a potluck lunch and everyone loved it. I blanched the asparagus like some others, but for only 30 seconds so they were still nice and crisp. I also agree with other reviewers that the dressing was a bit bland. I put more lemon juice and more salt, but next time I may try some ww vin and maybe throw in a shallot.

tasty with the rest of the dinner. I steamed the asparagus slightly. recommended

What a wonderful summer salad because of the fresh asparagus and the simple, but delightful dressing. The shaved parmesan is an absolute must, if you are serving this salad. The only thing I changed was to use fresh spinach, instead of the watercress. Delicious! Served as a side with the panini sandwich found on this site.

Loved using raw aspargus. The dressing was a little bland as written for me. Added a little more dijon and a bit of white wine vinegar and that did the trick!

This salad is one of the many reasons why I love Epicurious! I had some mushrooms and asparagus, and did a search based on those ingredients, and came up with this recipe. It was absolutely delicious! Loved the tart/bitter flavors, the color combo, and the crisp textures of the radish/asparagus mix. Definitely goes in my 'do again' file!

The dressing was lackluster. I kept adding salt, pepper and other spices to bring it to life without much success.

A very good use of asparagus. I did boil my asparagus for about 30-60 seconds, for the bight green color.

I made this salad as part of a Mother's Day luncheon. It was absolutely delicious - and I was able to make it the day before. I will make this again and again.

What a GREAT summer salad or side dish! I dropped the asparagus into boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds to give it a more vivid green color. I've made this a few times now and it is ALWAYS a hit!

This was so gooooood. My family loved it on Mother's day. We were surprised that raw asparagus could be sooo good. It is the dressing that makes it so tasty. I family loved it and it was easy. My favorite combination.

I made this for a Father's Day brunch. My family was a bit wary of the raw asparagus but it was delicious. Instead of watercress, I couldn't find it, I used arugula and it worked really well. My dad ate so much of the salad my mom was worried that he wouldn't eat anything else!

I've made this recipe several times since I discovered it last year. Wish I'd seen it sooner. The raw asparagus has a deliciously nutty flavor. Combined with the spiciness of the watercress and the wonderful dressing, each bite is a burst of textures and flavors.

Very interesting. Great combination of flavors. Made it for a picnic without the watercress (the store was out when I went shopping) and it was a hit. Try it.
