This dish smelled fabulous while it was cooking, and the beef was very tender, but this was far too rich for my taste and that of my family, and we missed having vegetables in the stew. I understand that Flemish beef stew does not contain the traditional stew vegetables, but I will not make this again.

A good stew should be significantly more exciting and hearty. Will not repeat.

I've never eaten a Flemish stew, but I really liked this one, even if it's not authentic. I confess I had to use Guinness Beer (sacrilege, I know!) because I didn't have any Belgian beer on hand, but it gave the stew a lovely rich taste. Based on other readers' reviews, I caramelized the onions in advance and skipped the lemon juice and cloves. Worked very well. Taste and texture were even better next day. Reminds me a lot of another Epicurious recipe for brisket with beer and caramelized onions, which I think would also work in the slow cooker.

I agree with the cook from Brussels: use a trappist beer, and no cloves or lemon juice in this stew! A dash of plain alcohol vinegar should be added.If the sauce is not thick enough when done, you should thicken with some maizena. Serve with French fries and mayonaise.

This is by no means a true Flemish stew recipe. In my opinion the only way this recipe is worth making is if you can get a hold of a real Belgian Trappist beer, since the beer you use is what makes this dish so spectacular. Also, ommit the sugar and try using a small piece of gingerbread instead, it wil thicken the sauce and give it a fuller taste. DO NOT put in any cloves or lemon juice!

Made with a seasonal dark beer from Sweetwater Brewing Company and used leeks in addition to onion since I was short on onions. Halved the brown sugar since the beer was sweet. Very tasty and I liked the bread as a thickener.

Excellent old world stew! The key is to use great beer and great bread. I used an Autrian Bock beer and three slices of German rye bread (like the rye here: http://www.carlbrandt.com/all_season/mestemacher_bread.php4). The slow cooker took care of the rest over a five hour period. Had an inpromtu dinner guest; he and my husband both raved. As with the last reviewer my onions did not carmelize either, but everything tasted great and it was not a problem.

I made this stew with Duvel Belgian ale - which I adore - so I drank what was leftover as I cooked. YUM! All fun aside, I was intrigued by this recipe & I followed it to the letter, only to be disappointed with the end result. The onions did not 'caramelize', which was no surprise to me, since I use my slowcooker often & have never had onions cook properly unless they are skillet- browned 1st. That said, at the end of 6-hours of cooking time, I removed the onions & fried them up in a skillet with additional butter & another dollop of Dijon, then added them back to the mix. As another cook noted, 'there are much better beef stew recipes out there' & I concur.

If there was a way to give a recipe 0 forks, I would have chosen it. This was a real waste of time and effort. The dish was tasteless. I ended up throwing it away. What a waste of money and time.

I'm very glad that I didn't read the earlier reviews on this recipe before I prepared it. Had I done that I might have passed up a very tasty meal. It smelled sensational while it was cooking, and the flavors of all the ingredients worked beautifully together. I didn't have a fabulous Dutch beer, but a local micro brew on hand, and used that. I also used buffalo meat. It was divine!

Browning the beef in butter was terrible. It did not seem rigth to me, but did it anyway. Sweetness of beer made the brown sugar over kill. Much better beef stews recipes out there.

I make this dish (a similar recipe) with some regularity (serve it with crispy french fries if you can). Like any old-world food there are variations to fiddle with, but let me just offer this - you must use a dark beer, and to be faithful, it should be a trappist dark beer from Belgium (such as Leffe Dubble), or at least of that ilk. It is worth the effort - use dark Belgian beer, not Heineken or Grolsch (which happen to be Dutch beers)- trust me. A tblspn of tart red current jelly mixed in once cooked gives it a bit more edge. Wonderful food. Best eaten in a sun-lit cafe on the cobbled streets of Antwerpen - oh, sorry, that might be difficult.
