Loved this. Super easy and even my kids (who "hate mushrooms") ate it all up. Served this alongside brown rice. I had baby bellas so I used those, and the thin chicken cutlet strips (fit and easy or something like that) and it came out delicious.

Excellent. Per numerous reviews, I added a cup of chopped artichoke hearts to the reduction sauce. That was a welcome addition. I used boneless thigh meat, just because I prefer thigh meat over breast meat.

LOVED this! The sauce is fabulous! I followed the previous reviewers' advice and added artichokes - it worked very well. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but would pound them thin next time so they could cook faster (they take a bit longer to cook and dry out otherwise).

Rating: 3
The artichokes really make the dish. And the sauce is delicious! I used only a 1/3 cup of chicken broth and about 1/8 cup of lemon juice & wine each, so the sauce reduced down on its own easily.

This was really easy to make, and quite good. I did add some cream and a bit of feta, but even without the additions it would have been wonderful (I'm just a glutton!).

This was a great weeknight dinner. Very flavorful and so easy - no chopping! (I confess to using pre-minced garlic!) I followed the other reviewers advice and used 8 oz mushrooms and 8 oz of artichoke hearts. I also used only 2 chicken breasts (boneless and skinless) and we enjoyed having the extra vegetables and sauce. My chicken was taking significantly longer to cook than the recipe said it would, so I finished it in the oven. The sauce thickened up nicely on its own and needed no additions (probably due to the longer cooking time).

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight with the Spinach/Feta Rice as a side dish. I didn't think I was very hungry, but I ate until it was all gone! We added some artichokes to the chicken, but otherwise we made the recipe as printed. We will make this again very soon, and we will probably fix it for guests. We both loved this dish.

I enjoyed this very much. I did bake the chicken breasts with a little feta paste spread under the skin rather than saute. I added vermouth and white wine to the roast pan while baking and added leftover cooking liquid back to the sauce when I was finishing it. I probably shouldn't have but I did add a couple of teaspoons of cream to the sauce to make it a little bit richer. Terrific!

The chicken didn't have very much flavor the first day. On the second day I served it over pasta dressed with olive oil capers and feta cheese. Great combination!

Added the artichokes to the recipe and a little more lemon juice - the family LOVED it. Will definately make it again!

This was okay (I did thicken the sauce per other reviewers' suggestions.) If you have the ingredients to hand then you could do worse than this recipe, but I wouldn't go to the store in order to make it.

This is a wonderful and easy dish. I paired it with the Spinach and Feta Rice and my husband LOVED it. My two-year old even ate it. This is an easy weeknight dinner, and will stay on our rotation.

Hey, I thought "tastes like hamburger" was pretty funny - lighten up! It's obviously a poke at the imbeciles who actually write crap like that. BTW - loved the dish w/o any changes!

Wonderful dish, full of flavor and so refreshing! I used whole wheat flour, threw in some artichoke hearts for an extra treat and served it over brown rice to soak up the extra sauce. Served it with an Israeli salad. Se bon!

Those who make huge changes (tastes like burger), then proclaim the recipe a failure, should not have their review published. Some of us want to know how the recipes work, and shouldn't have to labor through someone's poorly executed joke.

I don't know what happened, but this was very ordinary. First, instead of chicken I used ground beef which I formed into mini-loafs and sauteed with onions (no garlic! I can't stand it!). Then I omitted the lemon juice because my husband doesn't like it. And since I didn't have any wine, I drank a beer instead. Then I topped the mini-loafs with cheese because my family just loves cheese on everything. Finally, I served the loafs on buns, and since mushrooms are so expensive, for a little zing added ketchup and mayonnaise. The recipe says it's Greek-style chicken, but we all thought it tasted alot like hamburgers. I won't make this again.

This is a great dish. Very easy to make and full of flavor.

Perfect summer dinner for the family or even company! We doubled it, given that we're talking teenage swimmer boys here. Had a thought, though -- what about adding some drained artichoke hearts to the brew? Think I might try that next time. I'm good with the lemony taste, since that's what Greek-style is all about. The rice dish accompaniment is perfect -- my take on that is to add some toasted pine nuts. Happy July, everyone!

The Skinny Ginni from South Philly reporting... This is a great dish. I would use a little less lemon juice since it can be a strong. Allow the sauce to cook down. Don't over cook the chicken but make sure it's cooked. Good the first day, better the next once the flavors mix. For added effect try cooking it in a white tank-top undershirt. Yo! -The Skinny Ginni

very easy, very good...better with capers.

This dish was fast and easy to make but seemed as though it was missing something. I do not care for capers as others suggested, but next time I will try more lemon juice. This was so easy that i will make it again and add more herbs?? I served over rice pilaf.

Both my husband and I have enjoyed this recipe several times. I too, added more lemon juice. Very easy to put it together with ingredients that I always have on hand. Enjoy!!

Good and easy using ingredients usually on hand. Chicken came out really moist (I also used kosher chicken which I think is less dry anyway). Added capers and a little extra lemon juice as others had recommended.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I also added capers as did others. I thickened the sauce with arrowroot powder before serving. I will make it again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish. I simmered the sauce longer than the 5 minutes specified - probably about 15 mins in order for the sauce to reduce a little more. I also added capers. Even my 6 year old loved it.

Rating: 3
I had read the reviews before I made this so I added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. When I originally tasted the sauce I didn't think it was lemony enough. I think next time I will add a few variations like more lemon and maybe some different herbs. Overall it was good.

Rating: 3
The chicken and sauce were delicious. I used boneless/skinless chicken and will throw in capers next time. I think a milder rice (wild rice, pilaf, or pine nut couscous) would blend much, much better than the Feta/Spinach rice. The rice was very tasty, but detracted from the chicken and it's sauce. Perhaps better suited with a light white fish.

Rating: 2
Overall the dish wasn't bad - the flavors mixed well and it was an easy dish to make, though I agree with another reviewer that said the mushrooms were too tart. It tasted like it was missing a little something - maybe needed a little more salt? I would have liked a thicker sauce that coated the chicken better, but my boyfriend, who doesn't particularly care for chicken, liked it and said make it again.

This was YUM! The mushrooms were tangy, the garlic and lemon really accented the chicken -- my sister was visiting, and took the leftovers home! This will be made over and over!

I love lemon, I love Garlic, I love mushrooms, I love wine. I can't believe I got so lucky with this recipe. I used skinless breasts, portabello shrooms, zinfandel (ran out of sherry!) and the juice of one lemon instead of getting anal about getting that quarter cup. Used fat free low salt broth. It doesn't really "reduce" -- so don't expect that to happen. It's not a thick sauce, so don't expect that either. But, it was delicious. Served it with garlic smashed potatoes. Like I said, we love garlic here.

Although I leave out the mushrooms, I find this a delicious meal, particularly combined with the Spinach with Rice and Feta Cheese. Easy to make and just the right combination of flavors. I think I may try the addition of capers and champagne as suggested as another reviewer, too.

Rating: 1
Nasty. The chicken was okay, but the mushrooms sucked up the lemon juice making them too sour. My husband, who eats everything I make for him, couldn't finish this dish. I am surprised after reading all the good reviews for this recipe.

I used 2Lbs. cut up whole chicken and extra garlic. All and all not as good as I had hoped.

Rating: 3
Quite good, although I did change the recipe a bit. I used leg and thigh meat (removed from the bone) instead of the breast meat. Substituted champagne for the white wine. I also added capers, used white balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice and added a generous amount of tarragon. For the mushrooms, I used portabellos and rather than using all the garlic in the sauce, I seasoned the flour with garlic powder and other spices. Very well received!!!

Very good and fairly easy. I reduced the sauce also (about 20 minutes)Made this with the spinach and feta rice and will definitely serve again

The flavor of this dish bursts in your mouth with every bite. Just before I serve this, I sprinkle some freshly grated parmesan cheese and some shredded mozzarella on top, then cover until it melts. I've served this to guests many times and they've always raved about it.

I served this as suggested with the Rice with Spinach and feta Cheese. They were wonderful together. I even boned the chicken and left the skin on. I made broth with the bones and used that. Also, I used fresh-frozen oregano.

My husband is a chef and said that he would not flour the chicken since it becomes gummy. He would add the parsley to the sauce. Also, adding sliced green olives and using a type of wild mushroom instead of regular ones seemed to improve the overall flavor. Lastly, instead of using all lemon juice, he tried 2 Tbs. of fresh lemon juice and 1 Tbs. of lemon zest. Overall - a winner!

I made both the chicken and the rice w/spinach dishes. However I used skinless chicken. The only modification made was the addition of cornstarch while the broth was boiling. After adding the broth, lemon juice and wine I found the mix too soupy. My family and I all thought it was a keeper.
