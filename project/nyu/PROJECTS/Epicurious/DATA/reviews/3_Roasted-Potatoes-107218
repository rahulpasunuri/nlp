These are always delicious! When the potatoes are roasted at such a high temperature, they get this amazing crunch quality. For a variation on this recipe, try tossing the potatoes with fresh or dried rosemary. These are one of my favorite sides!

Simple to fix...used Hawaiian pink sea salt and liked it.

I also boil the potatoes for a few minutes prior to roasting them. I also roast them under the broiler for about ten minutes. They then have a nice soft inside with a little crunchiness outside. I have experimented with several different spices and have found rosemary to really compliment the most main dishes.

Easy, tasty side-dish. Good when you're making a labor intensive main dish, and want a break on the accompaniments. Try adding herbs of your choice.

This is okay, but I get much better results by boiling the potatoes first until just tender. Then I toss them in the oil and roast. The two-stepped process creates a perfect moist and tender center with a crisp, crunchy exterior.

Point of interest...for the novice in the culinary world, the potatoes should be placed on a pre-heated roasting pan, thus avoiding possible burning and sticking.
