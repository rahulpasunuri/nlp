These are my Christmas morning breakfast scones every year. I love the texture of them; they're nice and moist. The glaze is so good, I double that.

Excellent scones! These are my husband's favorite! I have made them a couple of times, and most recently made two slight alterations. I only had one stick of butter, so that is what I used. Neither taste nor texture suffered. I substituted maple extract for the molasses in the glaze to give it a bit more maple favor.

These are a lot of work for a slightly above average scone. They are also named incorrectly. No molasses can be tasted in the icing. Leave it out and call them Caramel Glazed Pecan Scones.

These are great! I made them as the recipes directs, except I substituted walnuts for the pecans. The results: maple walnut scones! They were a huge hit!

I have made these several time before and I always get the same comment. "This recipe is a keeper." My husand and his golf buddies loved them. They aren't too sweet but they are delicious.

These are the best scones ever! A lot of times I will make the dough, cut them in triangles and freeze them. Then, when we want to eat them, I just cook them right out of the freezer. The are wonderful!!

Wonderful! My husband loves the maple scones at Starbucks and I have been looking for a recipe similar to those- this is it! I made it with the maple icing recipe on this website instead of the molasses glaze

I made these as part of a collection of scones for Christmas presents. Everyone loved them and I can't wait to make them again just for me!

This recipe is a great companion for coffee! I made a few happy mistakes or alterations: 1. used all the brown sugar in the batter by mistake, which left me nothing for the glaze; 2. simply used the molasses and whipping cream for the glaze; and 3. sprinkled pecans on top, mainly because a friend didn't like nuts in his baked goods.

These scones were outstanding. I did not have maple extract on hand, so I substituted vanilla extract. Even so, these were excellent. I will make them again properly with maple extract.

These are always a hit. The only thing I did differently was putting half the nut in the dough and sprinkling the other half over the glaze. We make them often..

I really liked this scone recipe - it's a keeper. Couldn't wait to have them with my a.m. tea the next day. Cut the recipe in half and had 4 nice size scones. However, I will not do that next time because they were soo good and are now all gone. Also, I used almond extract (what I had on hand) and didn't make the glaze.

Easy and tastes great. I too have substitued the maple flavoring with Almond, tastes fine, but the flavor is richer with the maple. Tastes similar to Maple Oat Scones at Starbucks

Easy and fabulous. I didn't have maple extract so used almond extract instead, and they still came out great.

Made this for a father's day brunch - excellent recipe. I would suggest making them smaller as they are very rich!

Quick and easy! What a great change of pace. Loved the moist scone texture and flavorful glaze.

Nice alternative to the regular scone recipes I've made. Moist and the pecans and maple add a nice flavor. I was short on time, so I didn't even toast the pecans. I also halved the recipe and they still came out fine. I'm adding this one to my recipe box.

The molasses glaze was great. The scone, however, was a little too muffin-like for me, even though I prefer lighter scones, this one didn't have a scone texture. The glaze would complement a heartier scone. I would make half the glaze next time and drizzle it over the top.
