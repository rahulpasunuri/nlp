I made this yesterday for my husband and my houseguests. They are still raving about it this morning. This is going into the recipe box. I substituted ground ginger for the cloves. Also, I used two tsp. of vanilla extract since I don't have vanilla bean. Otherwise, I made as directed.

Excellent - made several times and everyone always love it

Based on the reviews, I thought this was going to be AWESOME but I've got to admit that I think my expectations were a bit high. I followed other people's advice and added more cinnamon, a bit more lemon and a third apple, but given all of the spices that went into it I still felt like it was lacking in flavor. Don't get me wrong, it was still good (and really pretty) but if I make it again I'll cut the lemon peel back a lot, add cinnamon directly to the batter and maybe switch to pecans instead of walnuts... Worth a try any way!

I made this recipe very similarly to how it was written although taking some of the suggestions people before me had made - more apples, more spices, etc. I was surprised and dismayed by how much I did NOT like it! It was way too sweet and mushy. I would NEVER make this again.

If this cake were a man, I'd marry it. Took the advice of others to use nutmeg and increase the apple (to 3).

This recipe was a disappointment, primarily because I lived in Germany as a child and it did not resemble the apple cakes I remember. This is a perfectly decent cake if that is not what you are looking for, but it is more like a coffee cake, and not nearly as apple-y as I would have liked.

The only change I made to this recipe was using vanilla extract rather than a vanilla bean, and adding a pinch of nutmeg. Took quite a bit of prep time, but was well worth the effort.

Very nice batter! I did make some changes though. The second time I made it, I added more lemon zest; it gives such a bright, fresh flavor that is not really detectable as lemon, but improves the cake. And, I used much more apple than it calls for. Very good. I put a full cup of walnuts in the streusel. Also, the addition of gray sea salt, a couple of teaspoons, to the streusel, helps to highlight the flavor.

I forgot a few additions; to the apple mixture and the streusel, more cinnamon definitely. To the apple mixture, I added a small bit of allspice and nutmeg, and some Applejack Apple Brandy and I allowed the apples to macerate for about an hour prior to assembling the cake. Also, half of my family is German with extremely high standards for their Apfelstreuselkuchen, and even they were satisfied.

I made this as a coffee cake for my family to have for breakfast this Thankgiving and everyone ADORED it. I actually made it Gluten Free for one of my family members; to compensate for the off flavor of the GF baking flour, I added the lemon rind of an entire lemon, more cinnamon than required, a dash of nutmeg, and vanilla extract instead of the bean and a couple drops of almond extract to the cake batter. Honestly no one could even tell it was GF, including me. It was just delicious. Period.

Wonderful country cake. I made for an Octoberfest dinner on our sailboat and received great reviews from those who do not normally eat desserts. I used three apples and increased cinnamon and cloves as well as added a touch of nutmeg. I only had a small vanilla bean so I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. My cake was done in 1hour. Made the cake day before and heated before serving. Left over cake was great with coffee the next morning. Also freezes well. Great way to use those few remaining fall apples

This cake is very moist, delicious and really easy. Very adaptable: added cinnamon to the streusel, extra cinnamon to the apple mixture, used both vanilla seeds and 1 tsp vanilla extract, nutmeg instead of cloves, regular instead of confectioner's and regular flour instead of cake flour. Even with all those changes, the cake was still great! A wonderful way to use fresh picked apples.

Fantastic! I made this for my son's school coffee morning (a German school) - and the other mums all thought it was perfect, "authentic" one said. Very easy to make, moist and great for autumn. . .I made it a day ahead and it was wonderful when eaten a day later.

I had no lemon or vanilla bean, so I subbed 1 tsp. lemon extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. It worked fine. I was fearful the cake would be dry, so I heated it for 2 min. in the microwave before servng. It was great! The small amount of cinnamon and cloves on the apple slices added a delightful accent to the taste sensations. Perfect cake to serve with a cup of hot coffee! I'll make again.
