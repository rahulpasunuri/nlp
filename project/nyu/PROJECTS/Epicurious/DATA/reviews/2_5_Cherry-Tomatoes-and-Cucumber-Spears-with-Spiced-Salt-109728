This left a lot to be desired. "Spiced salt" is a nutty concept...it is virtually all salt and not special at all. And people didn't use it after their first try. This recipe is really crudites with a dish of salt. Bottled salad dressing in place of the dish of salt would be more tasty.

Perfect. I served it with mango spears as well, limed but not salted. It makes a pretty platter. If serving seems messy, use pretty toothpicks or other pick type servers. Salting ahead didn't work well, and serving the spiced salt from a dipping bowl on the platter allowed guests to control their own sodium intake (those who are not fans of salt said the limed tomatoes and cukes were delicious, too).

This is ridiculously simple to make, and delicious. The first time I served it all of my guests raved about it (and couldn't stop eating it!). I often make it as a snack for myself and my husband on the weekends. As the last reviewer claimed that it was awkward, you could roll the vegetables in the salt before serving.....

Prepared this along with the rest of the menu and threw this out. Awkward to eat and not good to taste.
