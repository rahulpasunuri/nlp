This is a WONDERFUL bread recipe and a keeper. We have been making this bread since it was published in the 11/94 issue of Bon Appetit Magazine, and I must say, it is definitely a crowd pleaser anytime of the year. I have made it with Yukon Gold potatoes, and it turns out just as delicious. Tip: I use a "Potato Ricer" verses "mashing and straining" the potatoes, which yields the same consistency. Tip: The recipe yields 2 VERY large loaves. However, I found that after the first rise, I divide the dough into 3 vs 2 sections, which still yields three generous loaves & allows for more variation, such as kneading with raisins, topping with Sesame or Poppy Seeds, or if desired, make a Plain loaf. Enjoy!

This bread is excellent. My guests ate almost all of the first loaf and 1/2 of the second loaf. I used leftover mashed potatoes, about 1 1/2 cups. One loaf was plain to go with soup. The second loaf I kneaded in golden raisins, and a cinnamon/sugar mixture. Then I sprinkled melted butter on top, pecans and a brown sugar/butter crumble. I will definitely make this again.

Amazing bread, makes great french toast the next day also. I did make the mistake of putting both loaves on one sheet to rise, but the get huge! I was already making mashed potatoes with yukon gold potatoes, so I used those and it was great too. Excellent server warm.

This is my favorite bread recipe, never comes out bad. I even forgot to raise it the second time once and it was still perfect. This was my first bread 6 years ago and I did not find it difficult. Breads take time due to kneading and raising, I plan my day around making this bread.

If you have ever made bread before this is easy. To save time you can always use instant potatoes instead of boiling an preparing all the potatoes. Try it you will love it!

A disaster! When I was kneading the dough I had to add much more than the eight cups of flour that the recipe called for, but when I was getting ready to shape it into a braid I noticed that my dough was still too wet. I ended up baking them in a cake pan and ending up with a decent bread. I certainly will not make this again!

I disagree with the first reviewer. This is the first bread recipe I have ever made and it turned out beautifully. Anyone have any shortcuts, though, like mashing the potatoes with an electric mixer instead of putting them through the strainer?

This is just about the only bread recipe I make any more. Here is the trick to cut down on the tedious-ness of it. I usually make enough potatoes for two batches and then save the other half for the next time. To get the potato water, I just take a TBS of potatoes and add it to the correct amount of water... it always turns out. Also, this is a great recipe for dinner or sandwitch rolls, it also works well if you just want to throw it in a baking pan. Oh, before I forget, I usually leave out the raisins so I've just got a flavorful white potato bread.

We really liked this bread. It was great fresh out of the oven and made the best french toast the next morning.

Moist, tender and very attractive loaf. I took a couple of loaves to work and they were devoured in an hours time.

I really enjoyed this recipe, especially for making breakfast bread w/ raisins, and I can just break off a hunk and eat it plain. I also gave some to others, and everyone loved it. Very moist, sweet, and light. Yummy. However, I modified it so I could make it in my breadmaker, and I also used potato flakes (instead of all the work with mashing potatoes). Potato flakes are cheap and easy. I also cut the recipe in half, so it could fit in my breadmaker and since it's only me & my husband. If anyone else is interested in the time-saving method, here's the ingredients I used: 2 cups water (maybe a little bit less) 3 tablespoons butter, room temperature 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons coarse salt 4 cups (about) unbleached all purpose flour 8.5 ounces potato flakes ½ cup sugar 1 ½ Tbs. dry yeast Pam non-stick spray Cornmeal 1 cup golden raisins (optional) coated in flour ½ egg, beaten to blend (glaze) Sesame or poppy seeds Add ingredients to breadmaker in order listed and program it to dough only, letting it rise (the first time) for one hour. Then follow recipe beginning on the third paragraph. If you are cutting recipe in half, like I did, you only need one large baking sheet. Also, use the raisins, it's really good. I found the cooking times too long; I'd only cook it for about 10 minutes, then maybe 20 minutes at 350. I also used an aluminium tent after the first 10 minutes, because I didn't want the crust to brown more. And really be liberal with the oil and the cornmeal on the baking sheet.
