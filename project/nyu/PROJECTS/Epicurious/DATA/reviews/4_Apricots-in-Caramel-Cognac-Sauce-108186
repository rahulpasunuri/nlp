Why is this so bitter? I found it almost unpalatable, even with poundcake and vanilla ice cream to soften it. Another reviewer mentioned peeling the apricots. Would that really have made such a big difference? I found that the recommended cook time for the apricots was too long. I cooked mine for 6-7 minutes and would have like them a little firmer.

This was really lucious (there is something about fruit cooked with sugar and liquor...). We had it warm when I prepared it and out of the refrigerator the next day. Warm was good w/vanilla frozen yogurt and cold was good alone--the caramel sauce was really thick when cold!

This was great. You do have to be careful, though, when you add the liquid to the sugar--it does "splash."

Something possessed my husband to buy fresh apricots in January. Needless to say, they were not very good so I needed to do something with them. This recipe saved the day even though niether my fruit nor my brandy was of the highest. Still, it made something marvelous out of something mealy. Thanks.

Very nice with fresh apricots. I did add the first 4 ingredients together instead of melting the sugar. Came out nicely.

The recipe is good but to make it better add the sugar, water, and lime juice together then heat up (prevents it from burning. Also peel the apricots, it will take away the bitterness

Cook from portland... when alcohol cooks off it can be subtle, which is the point. However, if you want it to taste boozie you could sprinkle some additional uncooked cognac over it after. As per you not trying it.. if you can't eat sugar don't cook with sugar. Try using SPLENDA, it a sugar substitue recommended for diabetics and others who cannot have sugar but it tastes remarkably like sugar (it's made from sugar) and it bakes very well. I have a diabetic cousin who loves cheesecake and I make him a NY Style with Splenda for every holiday and noone knows it's sugar-free except me and him. SPLENDA is wonderful if you cannot have sugar... I suggest you try it. I personally haven't made THIS recipe, so I did not rate it. But it sounds yummy.

This was great except when melting the sugar, do not burn yourself with it!!! i am recovering from second degree burns on my fingers. must've been the margaritas beforehand....i also suggest something bready to accompany this to soak up the wonderful sauce, i made a poundcake and it was delicious. to the all-caps person below, if no one could taste the cognac, it must have been cooked out for too long. i added it toward the end of the recipe, and the flavor came through. just be careful!!!

I CANNOT EAT SUGAR SO I DIDN'T TASTE THIS. I MADE IT FOR MY FAMILY AND EVERYONE SAID THEY COULD NOT TASTE THE COGNAC. WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE WRONG?

WOW! I rarely give 4 forks, but this time it is for the simplicity of the recipe, and beautiful flavor... If you are looking for a new fruit dessert, this is it! Note: this didn't take me as long as suggested for ea. step; don't over cook so the fruit will "hold up". A little bit goes a long way. Enjoy! KIMBER

Delicious way to use fresh apricots and very easy to prepare. Besides being a great dessert on it's own, it would be an outstanding topping for vanilla ice cream.
