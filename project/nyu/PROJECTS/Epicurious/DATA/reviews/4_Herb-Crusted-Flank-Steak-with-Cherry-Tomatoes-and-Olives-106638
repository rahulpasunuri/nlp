Cooked this for a casual dinner party - everything except the actual grilling could be done ahead. Guests loved it. We had meat left over (from about 3.5# steak) but NO tomatoes. I didn't think they were all that, but the guests scraped the dish.

Was wonderful. I put fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden and added more of the herbs then suggested. I will certainly save this recipe and make it every cherry tomato season!

Delicious! Made the flank steak exactly as stated and like the previous reviewers said, the herbs stayed green, moist and fragrant, and did not burn off on the grill. I did however substitute another great tomato dish from this site (Double Tomato Salad with Capers and Olives - Bon Appetit) which is similar to this except it uses capers and sun-dried tomatoes instead of basil.

I have made this receipe several times and it is great. My husband is in the organic food business so we have fresh produce, herbs and organic meat. I use either the balsamic or the sherry vinegar and tend to only marinate a few hours. I make the sauce ahead and let it sit. I like my meat on the rare side, after it sits I pour over the sauce then add some plain feta and parsley. It is a crowd pleaser.

I've made this recipe several times, and it is always a crowd pleaser. This may be taboo, but I used dried herbs (half as much as the recipe calls for), double the garlic, cut the salt down to one tsp, throw it all in a Ziploc back (including the oil), mix it together, and then drop the meat in and coat the steak using the bag. I only use one steak, so it is entirely coated with the herbs. Some may say this is over seasoning the meat, but I have never had one complaint. I also have never made the tomato topping, so I know the steak is great on its own.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. The marinade is really more of a rub, however, the steak really absorbed the flavors of the herbs when marinated overnight. The tomatoes were a very lovely compliment to the meat, light and refreshing with a depth of flavor. We did not have sherry vinegar, so just used red wine vinegar and it was great.

The only thing better than the meal itself is making extra, so that the next night you can do this: slice some good, thick sourdough bread and spread a little goat cheese on each slice, then layer on some thinly sliced flank steak and a little of the tomato and olive mixture. Brush some olive oil on and grill over low heat. Hands down, my husband's favorite leftovers ever.

We used buffalo flank steak from Whole Foods Market and marinated it for about 12 hours. My husband raved and we will definitely make this again. I was afraid the herbs would burn while on the grill, but they did not. A very flavorful dish.

Been making this since it was first printed, perhaps twice a year. I've made it with olives as suggested, but prefer it with green manzanilla stuffed olives. The leftovers are also good in a baguette.

This was a very successful dish; I think everyone in my party liked it. While I thought the herb rub was great - and I *really* liked the tomato relish with it - I prefer liquid-marinated steak. There just wasn't quite enough flavor for me. And with a "light" relish on top, the whole thing was just a tad bit wanting. If I make this again, I think I'll throw some balsamic vinegar in the dish with steak, and I'll put a splash or two of white balsamic vinegar in the tomato relish to complement it.

Okay, this tomato and olive sauce is also spectacular over sea bass that has been briefly sautéed then completed in the oven. Whether made with the steak or the sea bass, serve over creamy mashed potatoes. Wow, people loved this dish.

Made 1/2 the Recipe for the two of us and I highly Recommend! The end result is a steak that has a light, fresh taste, perfect for summer. My only deviation was to back off on the Rosemary by 50% which is usually my instinct when it comes that that herb. Glad I did, the balance of herbs was exquisite. No one taste dominated yet you could get something different in every bite. Definitely also serve the Tomato mixture over the steak. The combination is fantastic.

To the user who said they substituted "London broil," read this below: http://www.ochef.com/267.htm "If your grocer has labeled the cut of meat you have as London broil, skip to the next paragraph. To purists, London broil is a preparation, not a cut of meat. It is a steak that is pan-fried (and therefore not grilled) over high heat only to medium rare, beyond which point it becomes inedibly tough. It is a useful preparation for lean, tough cuts of meat, such as flank steak, shoulder, and round. To the less pure, London broil is a preparation that involves marinating a flank steak, then grilling, broiling, or pan-frying it. Some absolutely promiscuous butchers label various cuts of meat London broil, including flank steak, sirloin tip, top round, etc. Well assume you have a flank steak. For best results, marinate the meat for several hours or overnight in the refrigerator in the marinade of your choosing. It is easiest to put the marinade and meat in a sealable plastic bag. Turn the bag over once or twice. When you are ready, grill the steak over high heat for about 3 minutes per side, then turn the grill down to medium if using gas or move the steak to a cooler area if using charcoal, and cook for another five to six minutes, turning it once midway. Finally, for a flank steak, the grilling is less of an issue than the cutting. Flank steaks are tough, so you slice them thinly on a diagonal across the grain to sever the tough fibers and make the flavorful steak chewable."

Why is no internal temperature given? I suggest 126 degrees for medium rare.

I found the rosemary and basil to be an unacceptable clash. I love them both, but not together! I would leave out the rosemary next time. And maybe the tarragon too and let the thyme work alone with tne beef.

This is a great flank steak preperation. I did not make the tomatoes, but served with chimichurri sauce instead. I doubled the recipe for a buffet for 50, marinated all day, grilled about an hour before service, then just let the meat sit until I was ready to slice and serve. It was excellent just warm or room temperature.

I was disappointed in this recipe...I love all the ingredients, but didn't like the end result. I've made another similar flank steak that was more flavorable that added some paprika, cayenne pepper and more garlice. I found this to be much better..and I "score" the meat...and rub the marinade into the meat. For the topping - I thought there was too much olive oil...and way too much parsley.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and delicious. The tomatoes in the juice of the steak were excellent and the aromas from the meat on the grill mouth-watering. My only change would be to hold on adding salt to the tomatoe mix (per recipe, add to taste) - after marinating with the olives & seasoning from the meat, it was a little much. But definitely a keeper!

This has become one of our gold-standard recipes in our household (we make it a couple of times a month). We modify the recipe to suit the herbs we have on hand, but the rosemary/tarragon/thyme/garlic combination is hard to beat. We've used this flank steak in a steak sandwich-style presentation on grilled foccacia for a sunday lunch. It's just so versatile and widely liked. Definitely would recommend this recipe.

Made this for a gathering of a few friends and it was delicious as written. Even had the tomato mixture in a wrap the next day. My only suggestion, which I read in another review, is to add a little oil to the herb mixture only for the ease of spreading it on the flank steak.

I love this recipe this time of year but have modified it for the herbs in my garden. I use basil in place of tarragon in the marinade and use double the basil in the tomato mixture. I also use any type of tomato that is avalable from the garden or market and particularly like mixing chopped red and yellow tomatoes for a beautiful presentation. This is a stunning and simple meal served with grilled asparagus. Our guests always love it!

This is a great flank steak recipe because you don't have to marinate overnight as you so often do. I was amazed at how tender the flank steak was with so few ingredients.

Delicious! Especially for those who use a lot of fresh herbs in their cooking.

This recipe should be receiving 4 forks however...I spent 30 minutes making the tomato salsa and spending quite a few dollars on it as well, and it didn't taste so great and it was unecessary. If you let the steaks marinate for approximately 4 hours, they will be tender and juicy. Don't cook for too long. Flank steaks, because they are thin, tend to cook very fast and get well-done. Best served medium rare.

I made this for a bunch of guys who think that the only piece of meat worth eating is a 16 ounce New York strip steak.

My beau announced that I could make *#%! taste amazing - it's simply excellent fresh ingredients and an open mind. This one's a keeper!

I am going to make this recipe again but with one important change. I did not like the tarragon flavor -- too much anise-like flavor and also a type of sweetness that I did not like. Next time I am going to try fresh oregano in its place. The steak was easy to do and smelled wonderfully while grilling. Can also be served cold in my opinion, especially with the tomatoes on top of it. A very attractive dish. Insofar as the criticisms of some about the toughness of the steak, I can speculate only that they do not know the correct way to cut a flank steak across the grain in relatively thin slices (use a well sharpened knife). If cut properly, it is tender and one of the most flavorful cuts of beef.

I really liked this recipe both the steak and the salad. I used all fresh herbs from my garden and the flavors really came through. I let everything sit for at least two hours and made sure the salad was room temperature. However I did cut back a bit of the parsley and used sirloin tip steak instead of flank. I also added a squeeze of lemon to the salad and used Balsamic dressing.

I made the steak with tomatoes for my husband as a sandwich on french bread with cheese. I'm a vegetarian and enjoyed the leftover tomatoes and olives on whole wheat bread with butter lettuce.

I am a big fan of flank steak. Slicing it thin takes away and toughness that it would have had in larger bites and flank steak has more flavor than most steaks. The herbs and garlic were just perfect. The combination of sweet tomatoes and briney sharp olives was a marriage made in heaven. Reminescent of the olive, olive oil, tomato flavors of the south of france. Perfect summertime meal.

I haven't done this particular flank steak recipe, but I marinate and grill flank steak all the time, as it is one of my summer favorites. I would NEVER cook it more than medium-rare! That's the key to a tender and tasty flank steak...don't over cook, and slice at an angle and against the grain.

I made the steak and had the ingredients for the tomatoes, but since we got home later than planned, just skipped the tomatoes and grilled the steak. I marinated for about 8 hours and I also mixed the herbs and olive oil and rubbed on the meat and placed in a ziplock bag. I didn't have fresh tarragon, dried worked fine. We grilled 8 minutes on each side over a charcol fire with plum wood chips and was done perfectly, pink in the middle. The steak had a wonderful flavor and will definitely make again.

Followed this recipe exactly, except I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the tomato-olive relish. This is an excellent recipe. I'm not really a big fan of brine olives, but certainly loved this dish. I grilled the flank steak on a Weber gas grill at HMH for 5 minutes per side. Instant thermometer registered 140 degrees doneness which was perfect degree of doness to allow the steaks to sit for five minutes before slicing. Steaks came out perfect. Guests gave raving reviews and said I was a gourmet chef.

Liked the tomato and olive mixture...really seemed to bring out the flavor of the meat. I didn't have fresh tarragon on hand, so I just increased the basil. Although I was skeptical at first, the cooking time for the meat is completely accurate. Be careful not to overcook - unless you like the texture of shoe leather!

Like the previous reviewer I too wanted to make this recipe based on all the positive feedback it has received. I followed the recipe to the letter and even though it turned out perfect, I have to say I do not share the same view. I though it was OK, but I worried about the meat being tough. My old recipe has wine vinegar to tenderize it some. I cooked the meat to a bright pink and sliced on the diagonal, but it was ho-hum. I would leave out the tarragon if I made this again, I just didn't like it with the beef. I like the tomato & olive recipe, but unfortnately several people I cooked for don't care for brine curred olives. Big disappointment.

Excellent. My husband doesn't like flank steak say's it's too lean and has no taste. He went wild for this. Had enough left over so that I will serve remaining slices on Pita bread with sides of salad tonight. I selected this recipe based on your reviews! It was a smart choice. Thanks!

Tried this recipe tonight. For the steak marinade I used dried thyme, rosemary, and tarragon. (Hard to find some of that stuff fresh in this town.) For the tomato mixture I used regular fresh parsley, plain old canned black olives, and regular old jarred olives with pimentos. (These different olives are too gourmet for this town, and I don't know how Italian parsley differs from regular parsley.) Grilled the steak 5-6 minutes per side. During the last 1 minute of the steak's cooking time, spooned the tomato mixture on top of the steak. It was wonderful!!! Would cut the salt in the steak's marinade down to about 1 tsp. or not add it at all.

I bought 2 flank steaks so that I could marinate and freeze one of them. The one I had froze turned out even better! I couldn't find fresh tarragon so used dried instead and it was fine. I would definitely make again, with or without the tomato/olive topping.

Fabulous! We used sirlion instead of flank. Great tastes.

This was very good. Everyone was very pleased with the steak and I got even more comments on the tomatoes. The next day I made sandwiches of the steak and tomatoes and romaine on asiago bread. I think I liked it even more this way!

This is a great recipe, but the tomato olive part was the best! Have made the tomato/olive part several times as a side dish and it was gobbled up each time. Will try adding marinated artichokes next time.

This was GREAT!! Served it to friends from Sweden and it was a huge hit. Added more garlic and mixed the olive oil with the herbs before spreading it on the steaks. Marinated 9 hours would do it overnight next time. Tomatoe mixture over it makes this an easy and outstanding meal to serve.

THIS IS A GREAT BEEF-LOVER DISH! IT IS SO SIMPLE IT'S ELEGANT TOO.I DID HOWEVER LEAVE OUT THE OLIVES,I'M JUST NOT AN OLIVE FAN, TOO MUCH BITTERNESS FOR ME. IF YOU'RE A MEAT LOVER TRY THIS ONE,THE TASTE IS EXCELLENT!

I made this recipe yesterday for some friends and it was absolutely delicious! Everyone enjoyed it very much; specially the tomato salad!!

Very flavorful, enjoyable, lite summer meal. We really enjoyed the freshness of the herbs and tomatoes against the beef. Fresh herbs are a must! We had twice-baked potatoes that had the richness to compliment the entree and grilled summer squash, a perfect side dish. Don't overcook the meat and use perfectly fresh tomatoes...very, very tasty!! I would serve this dish to all!

My husband and I loved this and think it would be delicious with chicken as well as steak. We added some marinated artichoke hearts to the tomato mixture, too. Easy, looks great on the plate, and delicious.

This definitely tops all my previous favorite flank steak recipes. What a delightful summer treat. I didn't make the tomato mixture but I will next time. I doubled the garlic and mixed the olive oil with the herbs before applying like a paste to the meat.

Outstanding!! This has got to be the best steak recipe I've ever tasted. I marinated the meat for 24hrs.I served it with the "Potatoe salad with toasted cumin vinaigrette" (from same issue) and a green salad and finished with the Blueberry Tartlets with Lime Curd(same issue). Everything was accompanied by a Pic Saint Loup (Bergerie de l"Hortus 2000). My mouth is watering!I'm anxious to make it again.

I used a variety of fresh herbs, including basil. The steak was delicious, but the tomato salad was even better. I don't understand other reviewers confusion about the olives...they're a part of the tomato salad. I served it with couscous and will definitely serve it again.

I have made this recipe 3 times already. It is delicious! the olive and tomato mixture is amazing. I have also used the steak rub on pork loin before barbecuing, outstanding. We will definetly make this again

I love this recipe! It is so simple to prepare and yet the end results are outstanding. We have already made this three times since the recipe was released and all three times recieved rave reviews. The tomato mixture is so nice and refreshing. A nice change and a great complement to the meat. Make lots of it though because it will disappear quickly. I also served this dish with the tri-colored roasted potatoes from the same Bon Appetit issue. Made the presentation of the whole meal perfect!

Grrrrreat recipe! Have made this for our gourmet dinner club and everyone loved it! Had the meat tenderized at the butcher upon purchase and it was refrigerated in the herb mixture for 3 hours - yummy! No need to marinate overnight as usually done w/flank steak. The cherry tomato & olive mix is the crowd pleaser! Add a bit of garlic for some extra kick - delicious! Will use this over & over again.

A different and delicious way to do grilled flank steak - without messing with a marinade! I used more fresh herbs on the meat than specified - since I have a bumper crop in my garden - and the extra flavor really made this dish. Served this with grilled corn-on-the-cob and a simple green salad. My husband loved it. A great summer meal!

Answer to your olives . . . I haven't made this dish yet, but according to the picture, it looks like you just sprinkle the olive mixture along with the tomato mixture on the side or top of steak.

Great receipe, but what do you do with the green olives?

Made this incredibly yummy dish for a "red meat treat" - whether you eat beef regularly or rarely as we do, this is the one to make! Made exactly as directed EXCEPT my grocer was out of fresh tarragon and rosemary so I used fresh thyme but dried rosemary and tarragon. To rejuvenate the herbs I too added the oil to the herbs, then rubbed the steaks after salt'n'peppering. Let it sit two hours, grilled and topped with tomato, then olive mixture (like duh, what else would you do with them?!) Served with green bean and cherry tomato salad from this site, german potato salad and corn. (Strawberry rhubarb pie for dessert.) Devoured by kids and adults, except for our 7-yr-old "baconterian." MMM!

My family & friends loved this recipe! I substituted all the olives with large green olives with pimentos, which worked out great. And, a lot less hassle than pitting Kalamata olives.

What in the world do I do with the Oive mixture? Nowhere in the recipe does it tell me where to use it.

This was really delicious. And may I comment (based on the reviewer who used shallots instead of garlic) I think it is hardly fair to judge a recipe poorly when you did not make it as directed.

We made this at a friend's cabin on the Kenai River in Alaska one weekend when there were ten of us for dinner. We made the "mistake" of adding the olive oil to the rub mixture, and then rubbing it into the meat. It was so fabulous that we did not have leftovers, and we had a bit of a scrabble for that last slice of steak!

This came out absolutely terrible, but I guess it was my own fault. As I was putting together the marinade I discovered I was out of garlic so I substituted shallots. Bad idea--the whole thing tasted so strongly of onions we couldn't even eat it. Very disappointing (the tomato-and-olive salad was good, though).

I have made twice and will make again this weekend! Delicious although a lot of chopping!

A very nice recipe. I served it to friends who were staying with us and made a lot and used the rest in tortilla shells the next night.
