My husband and I enjoyed this dish tonight. (Hard to convince my 2 year old and 4 year old.) I added the juice of one lemon to the bean mixture and it really helped brighten the flavors. I will make this again as it's an easy week night dish that pleased my eat-eating husband.

Wanted to try this before I invited my vegetarian friends over and my husband and I loved it. We even made this while camping!! No clean up. Didn't change anything

I thought this was a bit bland. My husband suggested some salsa, and with a scoop of that, I liked it much better. Next time, maybe I'll also add some cilantro and lime and really give it that Mexican flare. I has prepared polenta for another dish, so I sliced it up and used that instead of the store bought.

This was ok. It needed salt, pepper and more seasonings/herbs, like garlic. We cut the amount red peppers in half, as they tend to overwhelm the other ingredients.

This was fantastic. I doubled the recipe and cooked it exactly as written. Got raves from adults and kids.

There are so many different flavors in each bite because of the blend of cheese, beans, and fresh veggies. As long as the recipe is followed, the dish is a delicious choice for dinner.

I liked this recipe. It bakes well in the oven too if you are stuck without a grill. Good the next day as a re-heated lunch.

This is an excellent dish for vegetarians and veggie lovers. This is a light dish and it does have flavor despite using dry herbs (I didn't have fresh herbs0. I cut the recipe in half and it was enough for 4 people, so I ended up having left overs since it was just for two. The veggies cooked in 10 minutes at a grill temp around 400F degrees. Not an out of this world recipe but good.

This turned out delicious with some modifications. I mixed all of the vegetables (including roasted red papers and zucchini) together. I also added garlic (no garlic, what?), cut down on the amound of red peppers, and mixed in fresh parsley along with the basil. First I put the veggies in the foil, then a good amount of feta, the beans, and stacked the polenta on top. Grilled for about 10-15 minutes and turned the whole thing over in a bowl so the polenta was on the bottom and all of the sauce covered it. Served with a fresh green salad. It was delicious! Making it for a vegetarian dinner party next week.

This was delicious! I cut the recipe in 1/2 (for 2 people) and added 1/2 of a Portabello mushroom - cubed. Came out fantastic, light but savory and basil added great aromatics. Definitely going to be one of my "go to" weekday dinners.
