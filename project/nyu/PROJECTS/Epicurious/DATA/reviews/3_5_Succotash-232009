Fantastic!! I've made this several times using lima beans and sometimes edamame. It is excellent both ways. My kids even eat it, and they are super picky. Equally as good cold the next day. Simple. Delicious. A staple at our house!

Easy and delicious. My kids asked for second and third helpings, so this has been a staple at our Thanksgiving table for the past three years.

In addition, I browned diced pancetta in the pan with a little bit of olive oil, set it aside when done then continued with the recipe. I added the pancetta back into the pan at the end with the cream. I feel the pancetta added more taste to this dish.

With a few minor changes, this is the best succotash I've ever had. I am making it again tonight as it's all I've been able to think about since we made it two nights ago! I used high quality salted butter, one can of cannelloni beans (drained) and four FRESH ears of corn. I also only used 1/3 a cup of cream because that's all I had in the house and it came out just PERFECT. Will make again and again.

Whoops... my rating below was for the chicken that accompanies this recipe.

This is a great, easy recipe. I have made it many times. One suggestion is to remove the skin from chicken, as the marinade penetrates better (and it's healthier). Also, don't drench the chicken in so much marinade that it drips off the chicken - because the extra marinade will just burn and smoke in the oven. Save extra marinade to recoat the chicken when you take it out to flip.

Yum! I made it for some friends here in New Zealand along with other southern treats - a big hit - even better than I remember from my childhood - much tastier than a can of corn and a can of lima beans - the cream is oh-so-decadent.

A very easy side dish! I made this with the Chile Lime Chicken Legs. I used milk instead of cream so it wasn't as rich as it is supposed to be but still very flavorful.

This was a great side dish for the chili-honey chicken legs. It's simple and satisfying. Perfect weeknight meal.

Easy to make, tasty. You feel like you are eating something healthy until you remember it has butter and heavy cream in it! You could make it with less cream and be just fine.

Not only was this side dish simple and quick (once thawed, only took 15 min. to complete), it was delicious. I used standard cream instead of heavy cream, and it was fine (and could really only use 1/4 or 1/3 cup if worried about fat). Friends loved it, and is perfect for many meals.

This supplemented the "Chili and Honey Chicken Legs" very well. However, even though I added a minced clove of garlic, it was VERY BLAND. Several succotash recipes on this site sound better.
