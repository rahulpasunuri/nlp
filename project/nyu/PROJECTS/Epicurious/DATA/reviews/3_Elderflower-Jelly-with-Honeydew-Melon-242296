Most German food stores carry Elderflower syrup. For those in Florida asking, here's a link to places that may stock it: http://www.germancorner.com/yellowpages/foodstores/florida.html. For the reviewer in Boca, you may be able to find it at the Bavarian Colony shop. You can also order online from a supplier in Texas, http://gdcom.stores.yahoo.net/dawhelsyh.html. And if you're really daring you can even make your own: http://pagesperso-orange.fr/jeremytaylor/elderflower.htm. Good luck!
