freezing and microwave thawing-I hope I never catch up to that. This was very tasty. give the sugar and tomato a chance-it's a bit of an ingredient twist on balsamic, and it is so easy in general to play with tomato recipes to account for personal taste w/different herbs, cheeses, kinds of onions...

Why would anyone put sugar on a ripe Heirloom tomato?? Good Balsamic Vinegar, Good EVOO, a little oregano and some thin slices of Videlia or WalaWala onion is all it takes.

I made this for a dinner club--theme was "Farmer's Market" so I wanted to keep it simple. However, this was a little too simple. I used room-temp, locally-grown tomatoes, but not fancy enough for a dinner party. Next time, maybe I would add some chevre.

What you don't realize is that you put the tomatoes the refrigirator six hours ahead of time and then take them out an hour before you serve the dish and add the scallons that way they can come up to room temp.

What everybody is over looking is the fact that you can prepare it 6 hrs ahead of time but you can take them out of the refrigerator an hour ahead of time so they can come up to room temp and then add the scallons. I agree that I don't like sugar on tomatoes even though we ate them like that when I was a kid.

I love this recipe! I use tomatoes from the garden and add feta in between. I have made this a few times for summer parties and it is always a hit!

I don't know why anyone with excellent farm tomatoes would dream of adding sugar to fully ripe fruit. It must be printed for those awful store bought 'matoes I guess. In San Francisco, we can easily buy real farm tomatoes that need no extra steps outside of olive oil and salt and perhaps balsamic vinegar. Also, someone says to "chill" their tomatoes; this is the worst possible thing you can do to this fruit. If you want a flavorless mush, put them in the fridge. Leave them out till they are ready to burst; then use them.

Nice recipe. If you've got wonderful tomatoes don't chill them, but cold helps if they're lacking flavor. Balsamic vinegar adds some punch.

as said before tomatoes should be room temp (always actually) replace the malt vinegar for (good) balsamic and you've got a winner!

This was good but I don't think I'll make it again as I prefer my recipe more so. I use 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar (no need to use a really expensive one but you can if you like), 2/3 cup good, but light,olive oil (not too heavy), sugar and salt to taste,whisk together; sprinkle sliced green onions over thickly sliced fresh tomatoes (1/2 inch), pour dressing over all and let sit for 1 hour before serving. YUM! I hope you agree with me!

So good! I used excellent tomatoes, sherry vinegar instead of malt vinegar and skipped the sugar altogether. A lovely taste of summer.

Great summer recipe, but better when tomatoes are room temperature

Very good...but I would never chill tomatoes!

Forget about the sugar. It's much better without it!!

Not bad, just nothing special. Certainly don't run out to get malt vinegar just for this.

Use Jersey tomatoes.
