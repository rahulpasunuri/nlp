Made this to the recipe - rave reviews from the book club. I can see the opportunity for adding to the topping as others have suggested for variety. Definitely a keeper. BTW - the puff pastry I bought was Tenderflake which comes in a block scored across the middle, not sheets. I used 1/2 the package and it was just the right amount,

While this recipe is a delicious appetizer, I wanted to draw the attention of anyone who enjoyed it to the dish which it is inspired by, flammekueche (better known as tarte flambée), traditionally a farmhouse favorite and not a gourmet appetizer. Traditional recipes are hard to find in English, but essentially the pastry crust here is replaced by very thinly rolled bread dough, and the cheese blend is actually creme fraiche, which doesn't break down or get runny under heat, seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg and canola oil. Creme fraiche is easily mimicked by mixing heavy cream with sour cream and letting it sit at room temperature to thicken. Perhaps I am nostalgic for my past life in Alsace, but I find these both to be improvements over this recipe. Try them out!

I've made this recipe twice; once with regular bacon, once with pancetta. The pancetta didn't improve it, in my opinion. I used whole milk cottage cheese in both instances, and the cheese/sour cream blend is terrific. There's no need to try to substitute ricotta or other cheeses. I never liked cottage cheese by itself, so I'm pumped to finally find a recipe that makes good use of it. Finally, use one sheet of puff pastry - flour up a kitchen board and rolling pin and roll it out to about twice its original size. It won't get crusty in the middle, but it's not supposed to.

Great and easy recipe. Have made this many times with many different toppings. I think the reviewer from Port St. Lucie may have used Phyllo instead of puff pastry. Puff pastry is a thick piece of dough and phyllo is many very thin sheets. The packaging can look very similar, so be careful.

This was really delicious and easy. Made for a cocktail party. Things to change: - use a whole package of puff pastry, not jsut one sheet. I still had leftover cheese. - 1 and 2/3 sheet filled my 1/2 size sheet pan. It was just the right thickness. - the cheese mixture keeps well and I used it again underneath softly scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast, or under Italian sausage too.

This was delicious! I used Greek Yogurt that I drained overnight and the ricotta cheese (1/2 skim). Out of this world, and it looked so beautiful too! Mine was soggy, I rolled it out a little so it was slightly larger and thinner and made sure I spread the cheese mixture thinly, so it wouldn't get soggy in the middle. I also used the extra thick bacon. A keeper!

Update: I removed the crispy edge, rolled out the rest of the dough, scraped up the mix and placed it on the "new" dough. It worked fine. The wording of the recipe should be changed. A package of puff pastry sheets (17 1/4 oz package) should be substituted.I read right over the directions, which would have guided me better, but the ingredients mislead.

I thought one sheet of the puff pastry would be too thin for a "platform" for the toppings. I was right. Made a double recipe and am now looking at a jumbled mess. Thin, crispy edge that shatters, anthing under the cheese is mush. I may try to salvage it by putting the rest of the dough on a pan, scraping the disaster on top, and baking it again. Will update you all, and did anyone else have the same problem? Is it the whole package or a few sheets?

I enjoyed this recipe. I made it with the ricotta instead of the cottage cheese like everyone below recommended. Unfortunately I will agree with the fact that this absolutely will not serve 36 hors d'oeuvres. I'm not sure where that came from.

I brought this appetizer to a dinner party last night. Everyone loved it and one person asked for the recipe. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, turkey bacon and added sliced black olives. Very easy and delicious. Will make it again.

This is a wonderful appetizer! It is different and very guest worthy. Just make sure that the pastry is cooked all the way through in the middle. The "cheese spread" and cooked bacon can be made ahead of time, making this a fabulous last minute dish!

This recipe was a knock out at cocktail hour. I altered it by using the Ricotta and Pancetta. The 2nd time I made it I added sliced artichokes and black olives. Delicious.

I used turkey bacon but otherwise stuck to the recipe - my only complaint is that the cottage cheese bubbled over and made one corner of the puff pastry very soggy. The flavor was delicious, though.

I made this for a wine party and received raves. Not a crumb was left. I used the drained Greek yogurt suggested by a previous reviewer.

I brought this to a party with some people who are from Alsace region. They loved it! Wanted the recipe. The only differences I made were that I used Ricotta instead of Cottage cheese and I used pancetta instead of bacon. I will definetely make this again

Very good and easy. To the shortordercook from Florida: did you roll out the puff pastry sheet? It comes out of the box too thick and will never cook as fast as the toppings. You must roll it out until it's thin in the middle and just a little thicker on the ends where you don't put the filling, and it will cook up nicely.

I'm feeling a little sad that we didn't love this as much as everyone else. I cut the puff pastry in thirds as someone suggested to make it not so soggy, but it still was. Perhaps I used too much cheese topping. I loved the bacon and green onions but that was about it. Don't think I'll try it again.

This is a fabulous appetizer that my husband requests over and over again. I agree with previous reviewers - use ricotta in place of the cottage cheese. But I think it is stretching it to get 36 appetizers out of this - those would be awfully tiny pieces. To the previous reviewer - you only use one sheet of the puff pastry.

I'm confused about the amount of puff pastry to use -- is it the whole 17.25 oz package or just 1 sheet out of the 17.25 oz package?

Delicious and the hit of the party. A little soggy in the center. The second time I made it, I cut the pastry sheet into thirds, spread filling almost to edges. Bake and cut crosswise into slices. More edges made for easier pick up.

I used a ricotta/feta blend made by Lemnos because my lame supermarket was out of Greek yogurt and fromage blanc. I followed the suggestions of other cooks and topped it with Black Forest smoked ham and Emmenthal cheese.

To the cook who suggested using "Lebani" instead of the sour cream / cottage cheese mixture. "Labneh" is a middle eastern dairy product that is really a cross between sour cream and cottage cheese. You don't need to look for it in specialty food stores because it's actually extremely easy to prepare: Put greek-style yogurt (or full-fat yogurt) in a cheese-cloth over a bowl overnight in the fridge. The product obtained is actually Labneh!

Very tasty, very easy to make. Works well with soy bacon. I will try and find some more authentic cheeses as other cooks have mentioned and make it again, although I do think it is great just the way the recipe suggests.

I have made a version of this many times. I would substitute the cottage cheese/sour cream for Quark cheese, available at specialty food stores and use German style doubled smoked bacon.

Lebani, is a greek type of yogurt that should be used in place of the cottage cheese and sour cream blend.. it is beyond delicious and what makes this appetizer great. Hard to find but try an international food store. You can also top this with a lil sun dried tomato and kalamata olives along with the red onion and mmm heaven.

As an alsatian, let me tell you that we don't use cottage cheese but "fromage blanc" which is a creamy, white cheese difficult to find in the U.S. (look at Whole Food, King's, Trader's Joe or any International Food stores) or try to find Authentic Greek Yogurt (in the same stores) which is the most resembling to our "fromage blanc". But if you don't find that, cottage cheese, even if not perfect, will do the trick. Also no grated parmesan but regular shredded Emmenthal. Enjoy.

I haven't made this yet, but usually ricotta can be substituted for cottage cheese, and vise-versa

DO use ricotta; and I would substitute pancetta for the bacon.

Actually the combination of cottage cheese & sour cream is authentic, I've made other Alsatian tarts before with cottage cheese/sour cream - blended up it makes for an interesting filling. Try adding shredded Gruyère cheese for a little tartness

Before I try this - because it does sound and look lovely - is there not a more authentic cheese that can be used? Cottage cheese is so... gross.

This was awesome! Simple to make, smells great while it cooks. We had it as an appetizer with champagne for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.
