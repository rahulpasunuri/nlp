This flavor combination is truly delicious. Ironically, I don't even like pecans, but this is the one spiced nut recipe that I'm saving and will definitely be making again.

I find these totally addictive. I have made 2 double batches so far. Got the pecans at Sahadi's in Brooklyn. Have given out the recipe to at least 3 people so far. I skimp a bit on the sugar to make them more healthy...

Truly yummy! Just made them this morning to use as a salad topping tonight, but my husband and I have already snacked our way through half of them! One note: try to avoid pouring any leftover sugar/spice syrup onto the pan along with the pecans, as it ends up forming a thin sticky sheet of carmelized sugar that glues the pecans together.

These were delicious when they came out of the oven. The next day, when they were room temperature, they were not so appealing.

Really perfect for what I was craving. The pepper and cumin are harmonious with the sugar and don't dominate. Give it a try- we've made 3 batches and devour them. It's like pecan pie without the guilt.

Might as well go ahead and make a double batch, because these get snatched up quickly! Very easy and tasty.

Five Spice Powder can be purchased at any Asian store or where Asian spices are sold. It's also called Chinese Five Spice & it's a combination of cinnamon, star anise, fennel, cloves, ginger and peppers, more than 5 spices.

Made these tonight with this Homemade Chinese Five Spice Powder . They came together quickly and the house smells divine. Better than cookies for diabetic brother, I hope.

Simple and tastey on their own or on a salad. Would definitely make again.
