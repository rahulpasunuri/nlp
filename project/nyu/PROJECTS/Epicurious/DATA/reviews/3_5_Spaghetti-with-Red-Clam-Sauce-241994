Easy recipe. But like another reviewer, I used canned, chopped clams -- three 6.5-ounce cans -- that I added a few minutes before completion. I even added the juice from one of the cans to give the sauce added clam flavor. I also like things spicy, so I doubled the red pepper. This is one I make at least once a month.

This was very yummy. It was easy to make and was tasty. I will have to spice it up a little more next time because I like my fire. LOL. But, this rocked!

This is an excellent clam sauce recipe. I only had a 28 oz can of pureed tomatoes and it worked well. I bought a 2 cup container of freshly chopped clams. I drained the clam juice and added it to the sauce and cooked it down a bit. After cooking the pasta and the sauce heated, I added the chopped clams and they tasted so fresh and tender. I served it in a large pasta bowl with fresh parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it.

Simple recipe, easy to make, delicious to eat. My 9 year old even enjoyed it. Followed the directions and, like previous reviewer, also used whole wheat pasta.
