This actually was a bit dry. But tasted much better when I took the left over's to work! I also had left over pumpkin puree and sauce, so I made a crostini with it - topped it with a little parmesan, was actually not to shabby

Delicious for not a whole lot of work. We did not use clams at all to simplify but added about a cup of clam juice. We used homemade crepes and they were light but filling. Would probably use store bought pasta sheets next time but the whole thing is so tasty.

I made this recipe with just a few modifications and it was spectacular. I substituted bacon with thick cut prosciutto and bought fresh pasta sheets from the market rather than making my own. While rolling the cannellonis I found the pumpkin puree to be a little too liquid and unruly BUT the texture and flavor of the stuffed baked pasta was perfect when it came out of the oven so I wouldnt change a thing.

I was very skeptical when I read the title of this recipe, but I was delighted by the results! I made it exactly as directed and it was fantastic. I served this at a pumpkin themed dinner party to rave reviews. I think next time though I will try it with pureed pumpkin- cutting into the raw pumpkin was incredibly challenging, and since it all ends up pureed anyway, I might be able to get away with it.

Delicious! I made crespelle instead of the fresh pasta (3 eggs, 1 c. water, 1 c. flour) which worked perfectly. The filling was incredibly tasty, although it took a lot longer than stated for the fennel to become soft enough to puree. It really tasted restaurant-quality and impressed my guests.

I should have known from the start that the cannelloni would not be a success. By the time the pasta is rolled out, cooked, cooled in water, and then baked...it just is not the proper consistency of a cannelloni. Cannelloni, if baked, should not sit by itself "drizzled" with olive oil. That's a recipe for dry, chewy cannelloni. Not sure if anyone reviewing this recipe has actually had good cannelloni before. Don't settle...this is not it.

Review for the sauce only: SO GOOD! I made it to go with porcini mushroom ravioli, I really wanted something rich and earthy and this did the trick. Everyone loved it.

Too much effort for the pasta. Just make your own 6 inch crepes if you can, or buy frozen crepes and go from there. Much more "elegant" in the scientific sense of the word :) A keeper overall, though!

My fiance and I are both allergic to shellfish so I made it without the addition of the clams. It was delicious! We were both impressed with the combination of flavors and can't wait to make it again. A pasta maker is definitely necessary - the first time I tried it (without the pasta maker) we had tasty but very thick pasta.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It is a good deal of work but WOW it is a fabulous fushion of flavors. Make the pasta as directed if you can, but I have also used pre-made pasta sheets. We often have many littlenecks/cherrystones we dig up in the fall, and this is a great way to enjoy the fruits of summer with those of fall. Try it!!

WOW!! Unexpectedly delicious! This was the star of a 6 course dinner. We even used pre-made (but not dried) pasta, and it was sublime.

This is a lovely recipe. I agree that the clams seem an unlikely addition and the dish would be delicious without them. But it does make a nice combination of flavors if you have access to fresh clams. We had fresh ones ordered from the website in the article (patsclams.com) which were wonderful. I only had the no-boil lasagna sheets in the house and I discovered that if you soak them for about 7-8 minutes they become pliable and can be easily rolled around the filling.

OK, I was skeptical, too. But I tried it like it is and - WOAH - the reaction was fantastic. I doubled the recipe since I was entertaining a total of six, but I could have tripled it and still had my guests wanting more. It sounds a bit strange, but the flavors worked for us! Give it a try.

I haven't made this yet, but I agree that the clam sauce could be separate. Of course, I'm not a big fan of shellfish, so I'm biased in that respect. I made some butternut squash ravioli the other night using won ton wrappers - very easy and very delicious. I also fried some julienned sage leaves in a little butter, then, after boiling the ravioli, added them to the pan for about half a minute. It makes a lovely dish, with no sauce necessary.

This looks good. I have been looking for a squash/pasta recipe and I think the fennel will be a good addition. However, I'm not so sure about the clams, which seems like a separate dish altogether. I would rather enjoy the mellow squash on its own and have the clams separately. I like the idea of a simple sage/buerre sauce for the pasta.
