This dish was good and my kids loved it. The rounds should be cut the same thickness as for potaoes au gratin - about 1/4 to 3/8 inch think. I served it with Wine Braised Pork Loin, sauteed kale and Portuguese corn bread. I would definitely make again!

How thick are the rounds of potato supposed to be? Does the recipe mean spheres of potato or discs of potato? I cut mine into thin discs, and they ended up like burnt crisps (i.e chips if you're American!). So what happened? The recipe sounds so good, I must be doing something wrong.
