This is truly delicious. A few things I'd say is that I question the ease of seasoning the chicken after it goes in the egg wash (seems easier to me to do it beforehand), and I agree - a little cayenne in the egg wash and/or the panko is a nice addition. Also keep in mind that unless you have a *really* large pan you'll be doing the chicken in batches, so plan accordingly in terms of timing your side dishes. Nice idea to pool the sauce under the chicken rather than pouring over. I served it with Texmati's Royal Rice Blend and green beans with marjoram and sliced almonds. Even the cats came begging.

I have made this many times. It's an excellent, easy weeknight meal, and I love the combination of mustard and maple. Took another reviewer's suggestion and added fresh sage, which tasted great!

I've made this exactly as is a few times. Very easy and very tasty especially if you use good maple syrup. A great weeknight meal!

Delicious dish!! I also finished the chicken in the oven while making the sauce. (The oven was already on because I was roasting broccoli in there as our vegetable.) Instead of serving the sauce on the side, I'd recommend spooning a big puddle of it on each plate and placing the chicken on top of each puddle. That way, the top remains crispy...but you still get the yummy sauce.

This was good but kind of bland. I ended up adding a little cayenne pepper to add a little more flavor. The mustard added to the egg mixture did give the chicken a nice flavor. Sauce took longer to reduce than the recipe indicated. I would make this recipe again because it was quick and easy but would add thyme or some other herb to punch up the flavor.

Very easy & sauce is simple and delicious. We finished off in oven at 325 while making the sauce and they came out very moist & tender.

Great recipe that is good for a quick week night dinner but can also work for a casual dinner with friends on the weekend. Followed the recipe as directed. The sauce took a few minutes longer to reduce than the recipe stated. End result was delicious. Will definitely repeat.

This is a fabulous recipe, one of my family's favorite comfort foods now. I was skeptical about all of the mustard, but the flavor is delicious.

Very nice. I don't like dishes that are too sweet so I used half the maple syrup and it worked out just fine for us. The other comment is 4 minutes is not going to give you sauce consistency unless you have a very powerful stove. I would plan for 10.

Didn't have a lot of time so I skipped the panko stuff and just pan sauteed. Then I used a couple of tablespoons white wine to deglazed the pan and added the broth, syrup and mustard with about 2 tablespoon fresh sage. IT WAS GREAT AND QUICK!

Wow! I just made this tonight for the first time. I didn't even have Panko so I used regular bread-crumbs. It still awed and inspired. Tres chic fast meal!The sauce is to-die-for. My entire family loved it and had secondsd. I served it with mashed potatoes, beet salad, and a Chilean Pinot Noir. Plus surpirse,surprise, the beets also go really well with the sauce!!!

I am giving this recipe an overall 3 forks mainly because of ease, quick preparation and convenient ingredients. Otherwise, it's really a 2 forker. Words of wisdom: make sure you use the best quality imported mustards available, thoroughly preheat the skillet and reduce the sauce for longer than 4 minutes. Also, while the sauce is reducing, place the cooked chicken in a preheated 200 degree oven to keep warm unless you want to end up with tepid soggy cutlets.

I was a little hesitant about the maple syrup, but this dish is fantastic! I didn't have a real egg so I used egg whites for the chicken, instead. I also used German style mustard for the "grainy mustard." I had to cook the chicken a little longer than 4 minutes per side, as the breasts were pretty big. Served this over mashed fingerling potatoes, with broccoli and a side salad. My husband had to have seconds! This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
This chicken is incredible. The first time I made it, I was convinced it would be "good" at best. But it blew me away. I've made it again and again, and each time I serve it to someone new, they're wowed. It's best served with something green (my favorites are sauteed spinach or broccoli) and with mashed potatoes. Spooning extra sauce over the mashed potatoes is the best part!

Rating: 4
This is going to become a regular for me. I made it more or less as written, and thought the sweet level was on target. However, I also added some cayenne and some turkish red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it some sing. It was a great sweet-spicy combo that was a big hit with the family!

Rating: 4
Very Easy and well received by the whole family. I'm not sure about the "healthy eating" designation since the breasts are fried in oil and the sauce is finished off with a glob of butter, but it's a tasty one, nonetheless!

Pretty good as written. This should only be made with panko - if you used regular breadcrumbs you wouldn't get the right texture. I'm not sure about the "too sweet" and "too mustardy" camps - the sauce seemed to work well for me. Pretty easy weekday meal here.

Oh man, I had such high hopes for this. Chicken? Good. Panko? Good. Mustard? Good. Maple syrup? Good? But it's essentially fancified chicken strips and honey mustard (not that I'm opposed to those), but the sauce is SO sweet that it's overwhelming. A much better chicken/mustard/panko recipe is the one here on Epicurious for Deviled Chicken.

This was great! The chicken was wonderful and is my new standard for breaded chicken. The sauce was a bit sweet, so next time I'll go with a bit less maple syrup and bit more mustard. When I made it I was concerned that so much mustard would be too strong, so I many have shorted the required mustard a bit if I'm honest about it.

My husband comented that this recipe tasted like super fancy (and healthy) chicken strips. It was so quick and easy and perfectly healthy comfort food. I don't like mustard, made the recipe as written, and absolutely loved the sauce. I think the key is using high quality maple syrup. Will add this to my winter rotation!

This recipe was excellent; dinner guests from adult foodies to kids were raving. I found the perfect side dish that turned this into a sophisticated entree: the warm frisee salad with fingerlings and bacon, which I also found at the epicurious.com site. (I was happy to find the frisee and dandelion greens, but store was out of fingerlings; substituted quartered yukon gold potatoes.) On my square white plates, served chicken in the middle, sauce drizzled to the left, salad on the right. Perfect and elegant fall meal! The flavor combos of mustard and maple and bacon just hit this one out of the ballpark. It did require a lot of last-minute stove work for both the chicken and warm frissee salad; for a simpler weeknight meal I would choose simpler sides.

This indeed was quick, easy and delicious. I really appreciated that there will no chopping involved other than the italian parsley which I think is the reason why it was so quick. I couldn't find and didn't know what coarse-grained mustard was so I bought a stone-grained kind. I didn't have maple syrup but I did have honey and pancake so I did 2 tbsp of honey and one of Aunt Jemimas and I wouldn't know the difference in the sauce. It was definitely a keeper and I will use this again in the near future. And I'm not even a mustard fan. Oh, I had to clean out my skillet when I was cooking the chicken in batches as the oil got burnt and dirty. Also, I had to use more oil than called for...when I'd flip the chicken over I had to add more as the oil had already absorbed from the other side.

This was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made/had. Don't be afraid of all the mustard!! In fact, put more in, especially when doubling the sauce (which should be done-- there isn't enough sauce.) I accidentally put too much mustard in the egg coating for the chicken, yet it cooks down so much I hardly tasted it. I should have put more in the sauce, or even added dry mustard. Served with "dry fried" asparagus (with garlic and lemon). The chicken was very moist from all the pounding, and extremely flavorful. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic! I was amazed at how simple it was--it took me less than 20 minutes from start to finish, and it was absolutely delicious. It was perfect paired with a simple green salad for a quick lunch, but I'd definitely serve this to company for a low-key dinner party as well. I bought chicken breasts that were already thinly sliced, so that made it even easier.

I made this again a week after my last review but using boneless pork chops as I figured the sweetness of the maple syrup would do well with the pork. I ended up adding a bit of apricot preserves as I prefer a sweeter sauce with pork. I'm thinking of adding a bit of an acid next time like lemon juice, but my family totally raved about it.

I thought it was great.

This is the ultimate showpiece dish - tastes way too good to be so easy! I agree with cateler that the sauce tastes like it has more ingredients. It is easy, but DO NOT skip your mise en place -- it goes together really fast and you need to keep an eye on the chicken to avoid burning bits of the panko. I served with baked sweet potatoes and a green salad with a light maple vinaigrette. I was pronounced a genius by the other diners! :)

Very good. The flavor depends on the quality of the mustard. Mine was a little dull and a tad sweet. Next time I'll look for a more piquant mustard. I used Grey Poupon in the coating, and a coarse grain English style mustard for the sauce. Neither of them shone through. The chicken was excellent. I'm not a fan of skinless chicken breast, but this coating and sauce really makes this bland meat not only palatable but quite tasty.

This was very good. definitely in my rotation from now on. As recommended by other reviewer, I will make twice the amount of sauce, there just wasn't enough! specially since I served with roasted rosemary potatoes.
