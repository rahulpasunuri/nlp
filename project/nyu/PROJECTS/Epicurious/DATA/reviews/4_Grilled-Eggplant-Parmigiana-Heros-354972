This recipe is pretty good. I grilled the eggplant on a George Foreman and added more spice to the tomato sauce. Other than these two changes, I followed the recipe as written. It does take some time to make and assemble, but the pay off is worth it.

Just wanted to point out to those calling this a vegetarian recipe - most parmesan is not vegetarian, though there are vegetarian derivations. If you're being picky.

Made it without the rolls - the eggplant tastes just as good on top of rice or couscous.

This was very good but I think mostly because we baked our own sandwich bus for it. Otherwise it was just ok.

This recipe was delicious! I'm always looking for new vegetarian dishes to try, and yes... I'd never had eggplant parmesan before :(. CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture. Look it up, they're wonderful.

I'm always looking for good vegetarian dishes-- this one pleases even my fussiest Veggie friend. The second time I made it, I used toasted sour dough bread, skipped the marinara and added a layer of spicy hummus instead, and some grilled red bellpepper. It makes a lighter sandwich, and allows the eggplant, cheese and basil flavors to really come through. Either way, it's delicious.

Oh so wonderful. Yes, do use fresh mozzarella. And Parmigiano-Reggiano. A great way to say good-bye to summer.

Nice basic recipe. If you have the time, grill the eggplants and then leave them in the sauce for several hours so they're nice and moist and tasty. Sorry didn't get the CSA reference; doesn't that stand for Confederate States of America?

Fast, healthy (sort of), and delicious. I used Trader Joe's marinara with added cheese and peppers, instead of doing the whole sauce by hand. Saved time, still tasted great. Used provolone instead of mozzarella. I think mozzarella wouldn't be as good. And I grilled some red peppers too. Nice addition. It's good as a leftover for lunch, too.

When I cook for friends, it's usually something elaborate and I spend days in preparation. I decided to make soemthing simnple along with my handcut parmesan fries. The Dining Room fell silent for twenty minutes and the plates were so clean I put them back in the cupboard:) Excellent dish!!

i didn't care for the sauce so i substituted with trader joe's marinara. I thought the eggplant itself was delicious!

Have not tried this recipe- however it is identical to a dish that I make frequently, only not as a sandwich. All the flavor without the extra carbs from the bread. I call it Grilled Eggplant Parmigian... Good to see all the people with the CSA subscriptions!

This was fantastic and easy. We had all the produce from the CSA we belong to and from our garden, so everything was crazy fresh. I will most definitely be making this again!

100% Good to go!! I'm sure you could vary from original recipe as some did and this would still be exceptional BUT prepared according to recipe....OMG!

My significant other (who doesn't usually cook) made this for dinner the other night. I took a bite and almost fell over - delicious! He used frozen tomato sauce from our garden and he forgot to add the parmesan cheese so we just sprinkled some on top. He also used slices of sourdough bread instead of hoagie rolls because we happened to have a loaf in the freezer. It was amazing! The eggplant had a wonderful smoky flavor that contrasted beautifully with the tangy sauce and milky mozzarella, while the basil gave it some pizzaz. A beautiful thing.

I had an eggplant in the fridge from our CSA box, and this recipe caught my eye as a way to use it without frying. I cooked the eggplant on the Griddler for about 5 minutes on high, which was perfect. Wanting a faster prep, I used jarred sundried tomato pesto instead of making a sauce, which was a great flavor addition.

This is deee-licious! Great use for all that eggplant coming from the garden right now. I wish I had a charcoal grill because I believe that would make the eggplant taste even better. I used goat cheese instead of the mozzarella and it was really tasty. I don't know why you would need to puree the tomatoes because they cook down so nicely just chopped. Besides, the burst of heirloom-tomatoey goodness when you bite into a chunk is beyond words. Make this...it was great!
