Easy, tasty sauce served with Deviled Salmon Patties. Adds a welcome lemon-y note. I made it with fresh parsley and thought it was pretty near perfect.

I went with the tarragon option and used almost double the amount because we really love it. By itself this sauce didn't do much for me but it sang when paired w/the salmon cakes. They complement each other beautifully.

This sauce is perfect with the Deviled Salmon Cakes Recipe. My 5 year old loves it. I use Tarragon and substitute with soy yogurt whenever we need the dairy-free option.

I made this sauce to go with the Deviled Salmon Cakes, and used mint. The cakes were delicious, however the sauce was not good at all. So I divided the sauce in half, and added equal amounts of mayo, which made it taste just ok.

I was a little underwhelmed. I'd rather find a good cucumber/yogurt sauce, this one just didn't do it for me.
