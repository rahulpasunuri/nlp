A candy store in Savannah, GA makes pralines to which I am addicted and I was looking for a recipe that tasted exactly like them. Other than using pistachios rather than pecans, this recipe is the closest so far. It is excellent. I don't know about humidity differences affecting how they turn out. It was very cold today when I made them for Christmas presents and they came out perfectly. Also, the recipe says don't stir when bringing to the correct temperature. My husband came in, and trying to be helpful, started stirring away. They came out fine anyway.

These were wonderful. I was a little worried, having had some problems with candy-making in the past, but they turned out beautifully. I gave them as Christmas gifts and everyone raved about them. I think I'll try them next year with cashews or pecans, or maybe both! But this time I'll double the recipe ...

Creamy and wonderful, and the pistachios truly make them spectacular.

I'm a fairly experienced candy maker and followed the recipe to the letter (candy thermometer and all) -but the pralines were much too "liquidy" when I made it on a hot day. I was dissapointed because another reviewer said "foolproof", I should have checked for "humidity proof!". I saved them by freezing them and breaking them up while frozen over icecream. The flavour is good and I will give it one more shot on a cooler day.

I didn't use the toasted pistachios -- added 1/2 c. chopped pecans instead. They were delicious, easy, and foolproof.
