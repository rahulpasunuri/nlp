While this recipse is tasty, I like to do it a different (and easier) way. I've been grilling our turkeys for 7 years on a charcoal grill, and it is supereasy, fast, juicy, and delicious. Check out my blog post for detailed instructions. http://socialmediabar.com/grillingaturkey

I've also been grilling whole turkeys for a number of years. The butter, salt and pepper rub are enough to flavour the bird, along with your preferred stuffing. I prefer one heavy on sage. But the key to a good gravy is to let those pan drippings nearly dry up and brown every once in a while during the grilling, then add hot water or stock to the pan again. And the turkey cooks more evenly at a lower temperature, ideally between 325 and 350.

This is a great way to free up the oven for other dishes on Thanksgiving. We have done it for a few years now, and the turkey always ends up a deep golden brown with tender meat. I do add carrots and onions to the bottom of the pan to flavor the drippings for gravy. Also, a little poultry seasoning mix along with the salt and pepper is good.

I haven't tried this exact recipe, but I've been grilling my turkeys for 15-20 years, almost all of that time over Mesquite charcoal. We got a gas grill 2 years ago, so since then I've been using that. It's definitely easier to control the temperature with gas, charcoal is more an art than a science, but it's really not that hard. I'd usually baste every half hour or so, and I'd add a few more briquettes on each side, as necessary. My old Weber grill had the baskets for starting the charcoal, and instead of spreading them out once they were lit and burned down properly, like I would for quick cooking over direct heat, I'd spread the baskets to the sides and cook the turkey between them. Rather than using water in the drip pan I use a mixture of chicken broth and dry white wine, and I rub the bird with butter seasoned with salt & pepper, ground sage, and paprika. It makes wonderful gravy!

I grilled a turkey breast for a few hours on charcoal over an odd 'beer can' roaster that I had been given for Christmas (without the beer), and had amazing smoked turkey for sandwiches and snacks for the rest of the week. This is a definate 'must taste to believe'food adventure. I would suggest parting the coals to the side, and cooking the turkey in the middle.

Yes, you can actually grill a turkey with charcoal. I used to demo for a widely recognized charcoal kettle manufacturer. I sold more of those black kettles while doing demos of 20+ pound turkeys in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and Christmas than during the Summer. The method is as straightforward as setting a kitchen timer and adding a specific number of unlit briquettes. Google the manufacturer + grill + turkey. I've never had anything but a perfectly cooked bird (and I've cooked birds with this method in sub-freezing temps).

This was a very simple way to cook a turkey, and it worked beautifully! A gas grill with a temperature gauge is definitely the way to go, I can't imagine trying this on a charcoal grill. I actually brined the turkey for 20 hours, then rubbed it with salt and pepper. I had a 9lb turkey and it took exactly 2 hours for it to reach 165. I did have to add more water in the roasting pan about halfway through grilling. The result was a nice golden brown, moist and flavorful bird.
