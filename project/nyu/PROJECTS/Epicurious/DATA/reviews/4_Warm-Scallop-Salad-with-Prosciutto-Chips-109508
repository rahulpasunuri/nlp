My entire family, teenagers and all, loved this. Savory and rich with the brightness of lemon. Easy to prepare. Absolutely will make again.

This was absolutely spectacular. I halved the recipe and had it as a main course. I also used bay scallops instead of sea scallops. (Used 1/4 lb. for a single large salad.) All of the flavors blend really well together. I love the lemony punch with the smoothness of the scallops, paired with the salty, crisp prosciutto. Not only will I make this again, I'm making it for dinner again tomorrow night!

Used as an entree for two and found the recipe great. Not a fan of non-stick services and a copper clad stainless steel pan perfomed well in searing the scallops. I added a very thinly sliced shallot along with a 1/3 to 1/2 cup of very fresh feta cheese to the greens. In addition to being a very good recipe, prep was a breeze.

Scallops and crisp prosciutto is a great combo. Instead of cold salad I sauted spinach w red bell pepper, onion and garlic. Sauce was juice of one lemon, juice from scallop bag, balsamic vinegar. Excellente! didn't rate as this is not really the same recipe. But similar starting point.

There was a divide in my family. I really enjoy this salad, but others did not. Thus the two fork rating. I think if the sauce was tastier, I could get everyone on board. Nonetheless, I will make it for myself from time to time.

We loved this. I used spinach. I used probably 2-4 T olive oil but we also had only 8 giant scallops for 2 salads. Fantastic! And quick / easy.

I made this dish with a side of skewered shrimp which I grilled. I found the lemon dressing a little too tart so I added a small amount of sugar. Served on the greens in large scallop shell dishes. Very nice presentation. Overall my guests loved it. I'll be making this one again.

This is a fantastic salad. I made this for my husband and we both loved it. As I made this to have as a main course, I also added sauted mushrooms and sliced tomato for more oomph. My husband reckons it could be served up proudly at any restaurant. Definitely will make again!

I made this for a small dinner party and it was wonderful. I substituted the grilled escarole (brushed with olive oil and roasted on the grill) for the greens which stood up nicely to the dressing.

I made this recipe last night, and it came out great! I didn't pour the pan juices over the salad though because it was quite salty already wtih the prosciutto chips and i didn't want over power the greens. I just squeezed the lemon over the entire salad at the end. really great.

Delicious - loved the combo of scallops and crispy prosciutto. Rather than the pan sauce, I made a lemon vinaigrette with fresh lemon juice, lemon peel, dijon mustard and EVOO. Excellent first course!

This salad is wonderful! The only changes that I made to the recipe were the additions of a clove of garlic (minced) before I added the lemon juice and peel because I love garlic and tomatoes to the salad. I'll definitely make this one again.

I prepared this using key limes instead of a lemon. I skipped the prosciutto (family members don't eat meat), and used the salad as a main course. This was heavenly and so easy to prepare. I served with roasted asparagus, topped with Romesco Sauce, and Couscous, for a superbly tasty and wholesome meal.

This was really simple and really good! The proscuitto crisps were fun ... my proscuitto was rectangular pieces, so I cut each in three strips before cooking, then propped them up tee-pee style on the finished dish for a "trendy" presentation. I didn't bother to flour the scallops; you don't really need it. First made this for my husband and me. Then made it again for several friends and they all asked for the recipe.
