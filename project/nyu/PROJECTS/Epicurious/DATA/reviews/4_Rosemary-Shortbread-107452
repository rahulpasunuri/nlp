These were absolutely delicious. I found it necessary to cream the butter and sugar before adding the honey. Made the first batch with rosemary (my 13 year old scarfed up 4 before I could box them up). The second batch with lemon & lime zest.

A remarkable cookie. I got quite a few raves about this one, which I made the past two years. This year, I tried just adding rosemary to a classic shortbread recipe to see if that would work as well, and in my opinion, it did not. The honey adds a subtle flavor and changed the texture, making the cookies slightly less crumbly. Having done a side-by-side comparison, I'm committed to this recipe.

Really love this recipe. Like others, I rolled out the dough and cut it with small cookie cutters before baking. And since I used a flower-shaped cutter, I also but a tiny sprig of thyme in the middle of each for a little decorative flair. I'll try adding lemon peel to the dough next time as well.

Yummy! We added lemon zest to dry mix, very good!

You should make these cookies!!! I wanted to simplify my Christmas this year and wanted some key items that would be easy to make ahead and still be delicious. This cookie is an amazing balance between sweet, salty, and savory. I made these into rectangle shaped logs, froze, and then sliced before baking. For those of you also wanting to simplify, I made the following equally yummy cookie recipes from this site, shaped into logs and frozen: Rosemary Shortbread, Pistachio Cranberry Icebox (also amazing!), Chocolate Hazelnut, and Lemony Slice-and- Bakes. I will bring them out and bake the day before my company comes.

Love them! I made two batches (not together) I am doing them for a cookie exchange and the 2 batches gave me just over 9 dozen. I do not have the patience for rolling out dough as my wine bottles typically end of sticky. I rolled in batch into 2 logs put them in the fridge for 30 minutes then sliced them thinly. I added about 1.5 TBS of rosemary, fresh as stated. These are great!

Wow! I made exactly as written, but used turbinado sugar on top, and just rolled the whole thing out onto a parchment covered cookie sheet. These are so easy, and really, really good. I will definitely be repeating this one.

My favorite cookie. I can never really roll this out. I put parchment in 2 cake tins, put half the dough in each and nudge the mass out to the sides with lightly floured fingers and knuckles. Makes 16 per pan.

I've made this shortbread several times now, and it's always perfect. It's so simple, but everyone loves it! Not to mention the recipe is super easy and quick.

Rating: 4
Out of 15 different cookies made at this year's cookie exchange in my home, this was the favorite! Very different with the rosemary so sweet, savory and buttery at the same time. I made dough into logs then squared up the logs cutting into squares from the logs. I had smaller Christmas cookie cutters and used as an imprint in the shortbread dough then adding the granulated sugar and baking.

This was fabulous! Light, aromatic and pretty!

Made my first batch last night and already working on another. This time, a triple batch for Xmas gifts! Followed the recipe exactly, though next time i will slice them into .5 x 1.5 rectangles. The pie-shaped pieces are too large for something this decadent. Excellent with limoncello.

Lovely cookies. Made them with dried rosemary as I didn't have any fresh on hand. Still very tasty and completely addictive. The classic shortbread presentation is charming even without the rosemary sprigs for garnishment, and topping with raw sugar rather than the called for granulated sugar added to the appeal. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think this recipe might actually be easier if the butter was melted. The dough is very crumbly. I didn't have parchment paper, so opted to pat the discs out on the counter then transferred them to a cookie sheet, which worked just fine.

Absolutely divine! Rosemary is definitely one of my top 5 favorite herbs. In this recipe, the shortbread is the perfect consistency -- flaky, buttery, devilishly addicting -- and the rosemary is a nice offset to the salty, buttery flavor. Nice presentation, which makes this cookie delicious and giftable!

I think I've made these cookies over 20 times now, so I'm way overdue for writing a review! The taste is so unexpected and delicious for these wonderful cookies. I've tried making it with partial whole-wheat flour and it works very well, too. I usually chill the dough and cut out fun shapes rather than making a traditional shortbread, or use a cookie press. The taste is still amazing. Highly recommend these!

I made these cookies to go with a chocolate pot de creme with maple caramel sauce and they were excellent! A big hit at dinner.

These are easy and delicious. I added a little bit of lemon zest and made things a little easier by simply rolling the dough into a log and slicing the dough into small cookies once it was done chilling. They turned out great and I'll do the same thing next time.

Wonderful! Mine didn't need to bake quite as long.

This recipe has a nice balance of salt, butter, and honey flavors. For the method, I changed it a little, because I didn't feel like mixing butter, and I felt that beaten butter would be wrong for the crumbly flaky texture I expect from shortbread. I mixed the powdered sugar with the dry ingredients, then cut in the butter as I would a pie crust, followed by the addition of the honey last, just before kneading. I made the rosemary version before, it was curious, and either loved or hated by my guests. Tonight I made a batch with lemon thyme and another with lavender flowers from my garden, both turned out very well also (about 2 tsp chopped fresh lemon thyme, and about one tsp very finely chopped fresh lavender flowers, respectively).

Savory, salty, sweet and delicious. I made these as xmas gifts but ate them all before I could give them away. Great as a dessert or with cheese.

Not much to add to the other happy reviews. I think this is the best thing I've made off of Epicurious. They blew everyone away. The little bit of honey makes all the difference in the world - adds to the fragrance and interest. Yeah, I've decided - the best!!

I get more raves about these cookies than any other. I now double the recipe and press into a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper. I score the batch and carefully break them when cooled. Excellent with tea.

Delicious & unusual. I made these cookies as my wedding favors (cut with a round biscuit cutter & stamped with our monogram before baking) and everyone loved them. They make the house smell wonderful and keep well in the freezer. I found that when rolling & cutting these instead of forming disks, chilling the dough briefly in the refrigerator was helpful.

Years ago, if someone had told me that I could bake cookies with rosemary as an ingredient, I wouldn't have believed them. Well, I'm glad I decided to go for it because rosemary shortbread cookies are absolutely delicious. I do make a couple of changes: instead of granulated sugar, I dust the tops with powdered sugar. And I sometimes add finely chopped lemon zest for an added zing. YUM!

Yum - easy, unusual, and fantastic, with a lightly sweet / savory / buttery flavor. The house also smelled wonderful after baking. Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed.

This was delicious! Took other's advice and pressed it into round pans instead of rolling it out. substituted 1/2 c of rice flour for 1/2 c. of regular flour to lighten the texture a bit.

I love shortbread and this was a different take on it that I had never tried before. I didn't have any fresh rosemary so used dried and can't imagine that it could have been any tastier than it was. Sweet, savory & buttery all at once. Delicious!

This is a great snack. It's a perfect balance between sweet & salty. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was an aromatic kitchen and a delicious treat. I brought them into work abd everyone loved them. The rolling out the dough isnt as bad as you think it might be. I think I'm going to make some more for a holiday gathering this weekend.

I don't think I've ever given 4 forks before..but these are worth the rating. So simply delicious...Plus another great use for all the wonderful rosemary growing in my backyard! I rolled out the dough and cut it into cookie rounds. No need to use the extra sugar...My new favorite Christmas cookie recipe.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful !!! Its an unexpected combination of flavors that really works. My family and friends love it too. My sugestion is that you need to make sure to use a full tbsp of rosemary and dont overwork the dough or it dries out.

It is absolutely wonderful. Make sure you take it out of the oven before the side gets too brown, it gets hard like cookies when it's cooled. It tastes better when it's soft and just golden but not brown.

Wonderful! I pressed the entire recipe into a shortbread mold and baked this for 30 minutes. Unmolded and cut immediately. One comment which I haven't seen listed. Warm shortbread is by far better than at room temperature. A taste of heaven.

I ranked this last year when I made them, but have to come back again and say how much I enjoy them. I just got them out of the oven and they smell wonderful. Makes the whole house smell Christmasy! I used Christmas Shape cutouts and they are really festive. Enjoy.

This has become one of my signature cookies. Dividing the dough and pressing it into 2 9" round glass pie plates is a great trick for ease of shaping/cutting. I recommend using an extra creamy european style butter for powerful flavour. These always get compliments!

Really nice recipe. Good flavor and moist cookies too. I will use my cookie cutters to shape these for the holidays.

Could not roll this out. Placed half the dough into a cake tin, covered with wax paper, pressed the ball into shape. Worked fine. You do not need parchment. Very sophisticated, very popular. Thanks, Epicurious and all the bakers for their suggestions.

Perfect finish for that light summer luncheon with distinguished guests. Very refined and very good. I found mine to be too salty, but perhaps I used salted butter (can't remember!) but that is easy enough to adjust. I bake the first round until just toasty, and the second a little longer. The difference in texture was significant, from tender and smooth to delightfully crisp and crumbly. I wasn't sure which was better, so next time I make this (which I definitely will!) I'll have to try both again. Would also be good with many different herbs to coordinate with the rest of your meal.

These were delicious and came out perfectly. I used little leave cutters, topped them with rosemary, and served on a cheese platter. A big hit.

I love shortbread, and this version with the rosemary is heaven - like someone else said, the taste of Christmas. It is a new tradition for us - one that will be made for years to come!

These have a wonderful, unusual flavour. Easy and quick to make. As recommended by others, I did not bother to kneed, simply poured the crumbly dough into a 9' pie plate and patted it into place. They are yummy and rich - it might be interesting to make them in a square shape and cut them smaller. They would be a wonderful accompaniment to a fruit and cheese dessert tray.

Indescribably delicious. A definite keeper!

So easy and so delicious! Like some others, I pressed the dough into 2 pans (9") - after kneading a bit. Since we're big fans of the other rosemary shortbread recipe on this site (Dec 1994), I went with the same ratio of rosemary, so I used 1 Tbs dried with this one. We were very pleased with the results. We do prefer the amount of salt used in this recipe, though - we think it's right on. So very tasty!

We were house bound with Tropical Storm Grace and this was a recipe that could be made from the pantry with Rosemary from the graden. It is very interesting and my husband, not a cookie eater, liked it. It is a good fall recipe.

These were excellent (and addicting). Make sure to finely chop the rosemary--a scant tablespoon is just the right amount, especially if you are garnishing with additional rosemary. As suggested, I cut these into 16 wedges--just the right size for us. These would also be wonderful with thyme in lieu of rosemary!

This recipe rocks! Rosemary is the perfect compliment to the shortbread. Who knew? A big hit this year with everyone who tasted it, and super easy to make. I pressed the dough into a 9 inch pan without bothering to roll it our etc. Turned out just fine.

Cut the Rosemary by 1/3. Like nutmeg, it can overwhelm a recipe. Otherwise, great recipe.

I loved this, and it was simple and lovely on the Christmas dessert table. I streamlined the prep by pressing it into two 8" pans and used a spatula, rather than scoring with a fork. It was easy to press a fork around the edges in the pan...don't forgo pressing in a tiny sprig to decorate before sprinkling with sugar. It was so quick and easy and added such a pretty touch. Great recipe..even the children enjoyed them, and it was a nice alternative to the gooey fare.

Incredible, and perfect for the holidays. This shortbread really accents the holiday tree smell and tastes like a bite of Christmas.

Wonderful flavour and shortbread texture. Not oversweet. Easy easy, even for non-bakers like me. They looked great too! Next time I would not roll them so thin (9 inch is recommended in recipe). The portions also turned out to be somewhat large, I would cut them to make more than 16 wedges. Great recipe!
