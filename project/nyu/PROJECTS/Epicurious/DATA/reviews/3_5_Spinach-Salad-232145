This was just what I wanted. A prior reviewer made a good point: just dress what you need. The salad won't keep well once dressed. I did find that the dressing keeps well on its own--I refrigerated it over night and then heated it over low heat to melt and reincorporate the bacon fat. Also added sliced white mushrooms. Will make again just as is.

This salad is actually pretty rich. The shallots are wonderful and I added sliced mushrooms, too.

I thought this salad was good, but not great. Nothing especailly unusual.

I really liked the shallots in this, but found that the dressing needed a little sugar, which I have always put into the dressing. Always used the bacon fat as well. This salad really needs some mushrooms also, can't imagine a spinach salad without them.

Great salad. It makes a lot for one sitting, and doesn't save well, so only pour the dressing over the spinach you will eat at that sitting. I didn't use any oil, just the bacon fat from frying the bacon - yummy. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This was a yummy salad. I used raspberry vinegar because that is what I had in the house, and it was nice. Please note, it makes a huge bowl of salad, so will serve many more than 4-6 people as the recipe states. It was a good salad but not spectacular.

Great Recipe - but oh so much better using hot bacon fat as the oil equivalent. I know, I know, not politically correct to consume but once in a while won't be the end of life as we know it. Still good with olive oil but better with bacon fat!

A great spinach salad. Have been making an almost identical recipe for years - the only difference is I toss sliced raw white mushrooms with the spinach before adding the dressing. Be sure the dressing is warm - makes a huge difference. Enjoy!
