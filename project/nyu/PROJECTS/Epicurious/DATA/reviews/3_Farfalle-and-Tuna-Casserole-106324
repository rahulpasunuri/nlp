Made this with an entire package of egg noodles and the whole 16 oz package of frozen peas. Didn't add nearly as much lemon or zest as the recipe called for. Used three cans of Wegman's albacore, one jar of Paul Newman's alfredo sauce, one can of Progresso "meal starters" portobello mushroom cream sauce, and 6 oz of fat free Greek yogurt. Threw some dried shitake mushrooms in with the boiling noodles in the last couple minutes of cooking and added a heathy amount of crushed red pepper. Used panko and parm mixed together and misted with Olio buttery-flavored olive oil spray for the topping. Baked it in pyrex glass dishes. It made A LOT - - like about 5 quarts. I froze 3 quarts and have been eating the other two all week. It's pretty good.

I cooked 1 cup of rice separately instead of noodles and used 3 cans of low salt cream of mushroom soup instead of Alfredo sauce. Was delicious! Will definitely make again.

I accidentally left out the lemon juice and zest and do think it would have added a nice freshness. This is a good meal for when you need to make something out of nothing with your pantry items. I used 3/4 lb Barilla Plus which is whole grain and protein enriched pasta, for health reasons and only used 1 jar of alfredo but added an additional 8oz half and half. I used a whole package of frozen peas which was a little more than the required amount. So my ratios were a little off but it did come out. I think its ok to do this, esp since its a pantry type of meal. I would recommend and next time will make sure to include the lemon ingredients!

A couple of tweaks turns this from so-so to stupendous. Ingredients are the key - use imported Italian tuna in olive oil (it's expensive, but worth it), Italian-flavored Panko breadcrumbs (Ian's are great), added sliced crimini mushrooms sauteed in Sherry, and used a really good, natural Alfredo sauce from a gourmet market. A little Bosari season salt mixed in, and this was really wonderful.

One of the best tuna casseroles I have ever made. This is a staple recipe in my household now. While the original recipe is great as is, I'll often used mixed veggies instead of just peas and will add a touch of garlic to the mix which I find works well with the lemon flavor.

Rating: 3
Very simple to make, good flavor - I described it to my guests as a gourmet tuna casserole and I think that's pretty apt. I used about 1 1/2tbl fresh lemon juice and the flavor was fairly strong in a good way so I'm not sure I would use the whole 2tbl, especially with the zest. I also used "fresh" olive oil instead of the oil from the can because it grossed my significant other out and it came out fine.

Hate to say it, but in this case, I prefer my mom's version with condensed cream of mushroom soup. There's something inherently wrong with lemon zest and oregano in my tuna noodle casserole.

My two men loved it. Definitely would make it when we get hungry for Tuna Noodle Casserole. I did cut the onions in half; only 1 cup of green onions which was just enough of a taste. Also used leftover peas from the fridge from the night before; that worked out well. Added the Oregano to the breadcrumb & parm. cheese mixture topping as opposed to adding the spice into the mixture. The Lemon addition was a nice addition.

I've got a 15 month old who loves vegetables and pasta. Can't seem to get him to eat a lot of meat. I have to hide meat in with his vegetables. So I decided to try this recipe. I only used 1 cup of green onions and swapped a couple of the Alfredo sauces for the milk/cream cheese combo that another reviewer mentioned. My son loves it! My husband HATES casseroles and is now requesting this dish. We can't stand the cream of chicken/mushroom soups that mostly is called for. This was a gem of a find! And a great balanced meal for my little guy-- carbs, veggies, protein, dairy, and fat. A complete meal!

This is a great recipe with an addictive taste to it. I am a big fan and crave it often. I never liked any dish which involved tuna being served hot. I am officially hooked thanks to my big sis making this and passing on the fabulous recipe.

I tried this recipe again but followed the suggestions A Cook from San Diego wrote on 02/06/07. This recipe is a 4 fork and more frugal with those changes plus a couple of my own. Instead of 3 jars of alfredo I just used 1 jar alfredo and then used 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 cup parmesan (in addition to the 1/2 cup used for the topping), and 3 tbsp cream cheese instead of the other 2 jars. Then I substituted fresh chopped dill for the oregano. Thanks Cook from San Diego!

I make this recipe on a fairly regular basis. It is easy and quick. Hubby doesn't like mushroom soup so I was looking for a recipe that used something else. It's also great for a quick weekday dinner because most of the ingredients I have sitting in my pantry so I don't have to make a trip to the store. It does feel like it is missing something though....I think I will substitute fresh dill for the oregano next time and see what happens.

OK, it totally bugs me when people review recipes that they didn't actually make (i.e. olive oil instead of butter, Twinkies instead of phyllo, you get the gist) so I'll start by saying I didn't really make this. However, I do think this recipe is a great starting off point. I have made it word for word before, and I think the jarred Alfredo sauce is a bit gluey. I use just one jar and then thin it out with milk. I like my casserole to be creamier that way. I also think the topping is great, but doesn't need as much oil. In a pinch I have even substituted crackers for bread crumbs. That's the great thing about casseroles! They are very flexible. :)

Rating: 3
I thought this was pretty good. I cut it in half for just the two of us, and in accordance with previous reviews, used less than half of the amount of green onion (about 1/2 cup I would guess). Instead of refrigerated Alfredo sauce, which was very high in fat, I used one jar of Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo, which actually has lower fat content than regular Alfredo, plus a generous splash of white wine. I didn't decrease the amount of peas, and also threw in some chopped mushrooms. I would say it's not as good as traditional mushroom-soup tuna noodle casserole, but it's quite tasty. Would love to try it with some smoked salmon instead of tuna. The best part is that it's really easy and quick to throw together, and bakes for sufficient time to enjoy a martini before dinner.

UGH. This didnt work for me. Lemon juice over a piece of nicely grilled fish can be nice. Lemon juice plus lemon peel made this dish tart and not tasty. The next time I want a Sunday supper or week-day tuna-noodle casserole Ill do the old fashioned tried and true combination of condensed mushroom soup, noodles, salt and pepper and tuna. Into the garbage with this mess.

Very rich but absolutely delicious. I used tuna packed in water and it was still tasty. I topped the casserole with bread crumbs, fresh parmesan cheese & Parmesan Reggiano butter instead of the oil from the tuna. I also cut back on the amount of onions.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe stated, and it was fabulous. My husband said that it was the best tuna casserole he'd ever tasted! I'm a real believer in sticking as close to the original recipe as possible; once you start substituting and omitting and adding, well, then, it seems to me you're cooking something else. Anyway, back to the casserole - it was delicious, it was elegant enough for company and a great colorful presentation. I sent this recipe to several friends, and I highly recommend it!

I really love this dish, but it may be because I'm a cheapskate and didn't want to buy $15 worth of Alfredo sauce. I only bought one package and then added milk, parmesan cheese, and a little white wine to make up for the rest...it ended up tasting very homemade instead of packaged, as some people reported. Try it this way...it's cheaper and better!

Rating: 2
The consistency was nice, and it looked great, but the flavor of prepared alfredo sauce with tuna and lemon was not appealing. I used albacore tuna, about 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables, and green onions as well as some chopped onion and a bit of Mrs. Dash. I substituted french fried onion/parmesan blended in a food processor, instead of bread crumbs/parmesan. This dish would taste better with a homemade sauce.

This was really quite good. I used whole wheat pasta, added more of the spices listed and replaced the 1/2 cup parmesan with 1/2 cup cheddar as I thought the alfredo sauce had enough parmesan. Also, I tossed in a light handful of red pepper flakes that gave it some added zip. Will definitely make again, this time with a low-fat alfredo.

This is my standard tuna casserole and I just make substitutions each time depending on season, etc. I do ALWAYS make my own alfredo however. Jarred can be so gummy and it's pretty easy to make! I've even added cheddar to the sauce for a little bite.

I've made this many times but previously I had used a dried alfredo sauce. This time I bought two 16oz jars and it was so much better than what I had been previously making. I also added a couple chopped mushrooms. I'll be making it much more and it was even good the next day.

This recipe can be amazing with a few additions/ substitutions; I replaced the green onions with red onions (sweeter) and added a cup of dried cranberries to the batch for a surprise in every bite. The sweetness of both the red onions (once cooked) and the cranberries compliment the tuna / alfredo sauce. My friends ask for this dish all the time!

I also used low fat Alfredo, and only used two tubs b/c three would cost approx. $12 and miss the point of simple, quick weeknight meal(and make this something like a $20 tuna casserole!).

I don't recall how I found this recipe I certainly would have never been looking for a tuna casserole, too bland for me. BUT, this one sounded different, and since i had purchased a box of frozen sweet peas with pearl onions in error.... I thought I could use them as a sub in here and they worked great. As is, this was a three fork recipe, but I had some pre-made pesto left over from the Easy spinach pesto lasagna i made last week. I added about a 1/4 cup of that and it really punched up the flavor.

This recipe has become a staple. However as usual, we have altered it to our tastes. I suggest using the tuna in the pouches (no oil) and we use the light alfredo sauce (and no where near the amount called for - just enough). It may not be as moist as the recipe but seemingly more healthier.

I made this tonight and it turned out very well. Using tuna in oil keeps it moist. I made a few changes - instead of 30 oz of alfredo sauce I used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can's worth of buttermilk, and about 1/2 cup of alfredo sauce (Classico roasted garlic). I zested an entire lemon and used the juice of a half. I also used about 1/2C of sliced green onion, 2C seems like a lot. The result was not overpowering but a perfect combination of flavors. I will make this again, perhaps with baked salmon next time.

I also used one 10-ounce container of Buotoni Light Alfredo sauce and about 8 ounces of Rienzi Alfredo sauce, supplemented with a few splashes of milk; finally, I spritzed the crumb topping with olive oil.

I'm sort of a tinkerer with recipes, so based on previous reviews, I added about 1 cup of green onion, and probably about half of lemon juice and peel. We loved the flavor, oregano and lemon are great complimentary flavors. I'll probably experiment with topping a bit more--used olive oil, but not thrilled with outcome. I also added some thinly sliced carrots and mushrooms. Great winter comfort food with an easy preparation.

Even after reading the reviews here I was sceptical that a tuna casserole would be anything to write home about. Well I was wrong...this was great! I made a couple of changes. I left out the green onions completely, I used three cans of tuna rather than three, I used tuna in water and added olive oil to the topping rather than using tuna oil, as others have suggested. I also used "Panko" the japanese breading (used often for tempura) for the topping rather than plain bread crumbs. They really are great in this (and alre almost always a good substitute for bread crumbs). Also, one of the three 10 oz. alfredo sauces I used was "portabello mushroom alfredo" -- the added mushroom flavor was very nice. Finally, I acidentally spilled some lemon juice in the topping when I made it. It actually added a nice tang to the topping so I will probably add a teaspoon or so next time on purpose :-). try it, you'll like it.

I have a recent obsession w/ tuna noodle comfort type food & this really gives me my fix! A few notches above your average tuna noodle and really open to additions & changes; I used a can of organic peas, added some sauteed mushrooms, 1 packet of Knorr dry alfredo & one pkt of Knorr dry garlic herb sauce (so only 24 oz of sauce compared to the 30 the recipe called for), used skim milk, also rigatoni instead of farfelle...oh and some healthy dashes of hot sauce..YUM!

I am not a fan of tuna casseroles because they always taste a bit, well, canned. I ran across this recipe when I was looking for something fast and cheap to make for my family. I used a high quality tuna (caught and canned locally in Gig Harbor, WA - "Tuna Guys" brand - check it out) and made only half the recipe.

I feel strange giving Tuna Noodle Casserole 4 forks, but this recipe really deserves it! Following the advice of other reviewers (I don't like "fishy" tasting food), I substituted olive oil for the oil from the tuna and used water-packed albacore.

Have made several times; the picky child still does not know she is eating tuna casserole. ;-) I recommend making your own Alfredo sauce as it's easy, and you can control the fat better that way. For our family we omit the onions and peas, but I saute garlic and diced carrots in a little butter before continuing with the Alfredo sauce. This last time I had no lemon and had to substitute Key lime juice and rind, and it was a subtle but tasty difference. You can skip the topping, and water-packed tuna works great. A great mid-week staple. Enjoy!

I agree with the other cooks about reducing the alfredo sauce- about half the amount would suffice, and you really don't need to use the tuna in oil if you add a bit of olive oil to the crumb topping. However, I found the lemon to be a lovely addition to the dish. I've made this twice now and always enjoy it- but make sure you're hungry cause it's rich!

Here's a huge impovement that only takes 5 more minutes! Saute in PAM a medium, chopped yellow (not green!) onion with 8 oz. sliced mushrooms and 8-10 sliced baby carrots. Season with salt/pepper. Add to the tuna mix. Also reduce the alfredo sauce from 30 oz. to 20 oz. and use the low-fat kind. And use 3 six. oz. cans, rather than 2, of the tuna. And lose the lemon!

I had not had tuna casserole since I was a kid -- probably 15 years ago and so thought this was a nice "gourmet" version and it made a good meal. I agree that there were too many onions so would cut back on them next time -- I made my own alfredo sauce which didn't take that much extra time.

I made this last night for dinner. The only change I made was that I used 1 teaspoon of dried lemon zest instead of two teaspoons fresh. It didn't taste too lemony, but I think I would cut the amount of green onions in half. They were a little overpowering. It also seemed a little dry, but that might just be the brand of Alfredo sauce I used. I would definitely make it again, with minor alterations.

This dish was good, and I will make it again with a few adjustments. I also thought it was too lemony and will cut the amounts in half. I also bought low fat alfredo sauce to cut the calories. On my first go around I used imported jarred tuna, which makes all the difference taste wise. However if need to be economical, the canned is just fine.

Fast - easy - tasty - cheap - what more can I say? It will please everyone I'm sure. But it doesn't reheat well.

Great tuna casserole. The lemon juice and zest gave it a great flavor. The only changes I made were the type of pasta (I used shells) and I also cut the alfredo sauce and suplemented skim milk. It was delicious.

Great tuna casserole recipe! However, the fat & calorie count is unbelievable. I cut down somewhat by using only two 10-oz containers of light alfredo sauce and adding a bit of milk. Didn't miss the extra sauce at all.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I had canned chicken on hand, so I substituted that for the tuna. I also added mushrooms, and used some cream of mushroom soup in place of one container of alfredo sauce. Yum!

This dish was excellent. Made it for the first time and my husband said it tasted like I was an expert in making tuna casserole. I did alter the recipe a little bit by sauteeing the sauce in butter and garlic and I added mushrooms to the sauce as well. It tasted excellent!
