This is a "rustic" cake- it can be time consuming, but it also has a significant margin of error compared to traditional cakes. Think of this as the Appalachian manifestation of a Petit Four- cakes from the days of coal and wood fired stoves. Consider this as a teaching exercise for children- it requires patience, repetition, and as I mentioned, is not easily ruined. combined ALL of my wet ingredients, and added dry a little at a time, rolled, and dropped in #10 cast iron pans- rotating 2 at a time, while I rolled, It all went quickly, and forgoing the trimming produced a dramatic appearance. I did not have dried apples, nor were apples in season when I made this in early March- instead I subbed peaches I pickled in July, and pureed them "dry" w/ some molasses, the result was not the traditional flavor but very enjoyable. Don't be scared of this one,

This cake is soooo rich and dense ... a small slice goes a long way!!! Easily would serve 15-20. I made it for our thanksgiving table. There is no other cake like this. I bake a lot and can tell you that this cake is time consuming. My dough came out way to sticky to roll easily, it was a very humid day and i measured the flour by weight. I needed to well flour my hands, parchment and rolling pin, to roll out dough. Would I make this again? Probably not, but it was delicious and worth the effort

This cake is absolutely DELICIOUS! My daughter did a report on Tennessee and we made this cake together. It was fun, interactive, and was a huge hit with everyone who tasted it! We dried our apples in a dehyrdator - tasty flavors as we welcome Fall.

Wonderful..and I am a caterer and chef. I feel a kinship with the previous 2 reviewers...this cake IS time consuming to make (but aren't most good things??) but well worth it. I also grew up in the country and we'd make good things like this from our own fruit and veg; yes it took time but that's what you did before the age of convenience and sound bytes. I dried my own apples in an oven, and served with whipped cream spiked with apple brandy. Agree with KY, use an iron skillet and sing your praises to those great cooks in TN!!

I'll make this cake as I grew up with my mother making it without a recipe for all holidays. She didn't need a recipe since she had made it so many times. It's well worth the effort. I agree with not using applesauce but using only dried apples. Using a cast iron skillet is another trick to making it wonderful. YUMMY! I'll break my diet for this cake any day of the week!
