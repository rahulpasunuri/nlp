I grew turnips for the first time this summer. Looking for recipes, I found this on a Google search. I was really surprised that turnips could taste so good.

Oh wow, this is so great. Yes, it's summer and I made a warming winter soup--it's like the ice cream affect in winter. I used only milk and it was still rich and creamy. Great way to use up summer CSA turnips.

I used leftover oven roasted turnips and butternut squash from Thanksgiving to make this soup and it turned out really well. I made the recipe as called for, except for adding a chopped carrot and fresh thyme to the potatoes for sweetness and added my roasted turnips and squash to the onions, stock, and potato during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I omitted the dill and garnish, but am happy with the dish anyway.

this is a very delicate soup which to me lacked something i can't quite place. i might take up the suggestion to add cheese and grate some parm into my leftovers. i think if i had a small bowl of this as an appetizer to a meal, i'd really enjoy the subtle flavors, but as a main dish soup, it lacked a richness i'd like.

I thought this was an excellent soup and so did everyone I offered it to. I did add more nutmeg but I am making it again today. The flavor is suprisingly delightful.This is a keeper for the recipe file.

As I eat this I am realizing that those were white beets in my CSA box - talk about rich! I did the bacon and maple syrup - yum! Being a lactard (I don't eat dairy) I used soymilk in place of the milk and ground walnuts (1.5 cups) to thicken. It's thick and good. I didn't use leeks or potato - instead 5 carrots: And of course the beets - which I did roast for half and hour before I cooked 'em. It's really rich!

I was initially skeptical of pairing nutmeg with dill, but this soup turned out to be a great way to use farm-share turnips and was a lovely warming meal on a rainy autumn night. Except for omitting cream, which I did not have on hand, followed the recipe almost exactly and the result was very good. I can see how a dash of cream would have made it a touch richer and more satisfying. If I were to do it again, I might add bacon, as one reviewer suggested. I might also add a little cheese to the mix, but that's because I love cheese in everything.

The soup tasted like "Cream of Whatever"---with none of the root vegetable distinction-- until I added copious amounts of salt, fresh ground pepper and almost handfuls of dill. A teaspoon of maple syrup deepened the flavor, as did adding a bag of matchstix carrots at the end for crunch and interest. I wonder if sautéing the vegetables with bacon would have given this soup the autumnal heft I was craving?

Very good and easy. I used a can of evaporated milk in place of the whole milk and cream, and added a splash of tarragon vinegar at the end. I didn't make the julienne garnish, since I was the only one eating, but I'll give it a try when I serve this to friends. Great way to use the turnips from my farm share!

This was surprisingly delicious considering it was made with an infrequently used vegetable. I read all of the previous reviews and gave it a try. After pureeing I pressed it through a fine sieve for a more silky texture and I omitted the cream and used only milk. All tasters asked for the recipe.

My neighbor and friend, Jean added his French Canadian touch to this recipe, a tablespoon or two of maples syrup. Everyone raves every time it is served.

I followed the recipe fairly closely. Added about 2 tsp of salt, and after reading the comments here, used much more than a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg. That punches up the aroma nicely. The carrot and turnip garnish is worth the effort.

Delicious. I halved the recipe, used a smooth-fleshed rose potato, added two stalks of diced celery and omitted the cream. Garnished with freshly ground nutmeg, gala apple dice, and a dollop of sour cream. Perfect for a cold night. I've also read that adding oatmeal at the beginning of cooking can be a nice thickener.

This recipe is remarkable because it transforms an oft-despised vegetable into something delicious. We made a heavily modified version - no leeks, no cream, 1/2 tsp dry dill, no julienned topping, only 4 cups water and 1 cup milk. Yukon Gold potatoes instead of russet. We ended up with about 4 cups of chopped turnips and 3 cups of potato. The turnips I used were mild white salad turnips, but they were pretty old with air pockets inside. All that said - the soup was just delicious. Everyone who ate it was surprised to find they liked turnips!

This was awful. It was very bitter and I couldn't bring myself to eat it. I have never cooked with turnips before but someone gave some to me... maybe they were bad turnips? Regardless, this was so bad that I will never cook with turnips again.

I wholeheartedly agree with "sucka". I loved sucka's adding of extra nutmeg, and I agree that the dill is indispensable. I left the cream off as well and found the meal suffered not a mite in flavor for the omission. This is one of the best soups I have had in a long while and it is indeed a perfect complement for a relaxed and cool autumn eve.

Good soup. Sauteed garlic, parsley, and swiss chard with onions and leeks. Added more nutmeg than recipe called for. This spice is a must. Also, the dill is a perfect complement. Didn't do the carrot/turnip garnish. Also, didn't add cream or milk to soup. My house is an anticream house, so I added it to my individual bowl. It was still delicious with or without cream. A velvety and perfect soup for a cold day.

This is a very nice soup, but it is a little boring. Better as an accompaniment to a meal.

This is a nice soup but not, in kmy opinion, the "extraordinary" soup described below. I found it nice and warming and reasonably tasty but bland and nothing special. For special, try the 21 Club Senegalese Soup (served hot, not cold) on this website.

excellent

Yum! Only major change I made was out of necessity -- no potatoes in my house (huge snowstorm so no getting any) so I thickened using a few ounces of flour (added a few minutes into the onions cooking) which I cooked out for about 10 minutes in the fat and onions and leeks. Used homemade chicken stock...Worked beautifully...

A NEW THANKSGIVING FAVORITE. FOUND IT EXCELLENT AND NOT DIFFICULT TO PREPARE BUT NEEDED A FINISH. ADDED ABOUT 2 OZS OF FRANGELLICO WHICH GAVE IT A GREAT NUTTY FINISH TH THE TOUNGE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Like another reviewer, we get lots of turnips from an organic farm, and this soup is by far the family's favorite way to consume them.

Everyone ate this up at our Thanksgiving table. My mother-in-law was asking how to make it... so it definitely was well-liked!! I actually used frozen, chopped turnip and some frozen chopped butternut squash and I doubt you could tell the difference from if I'd used fresh... soup is a great food that way!!

Just harvested a buch of leeks & turnips from my veggie garden and wondered what to do with them. Made this soup. Excellent! Creamy & mild yet still flavorful. Yummy. Garnished it with crumbled bacon. Even my 14 y/o vegetable phobic son ate it and pronounced it "not bad."

This is an extraordinary soup--silky and creamy with a depth of flavor that belies its plain appearance. The nutmeg is an absolute must!

This soup was our first course on Thanksgiving. Rave reviews! The cream isn't absolutely necessary,since the flavor is so good.

We receive vegetables from a local organic farm. Thought we had beets with a light pink skin, re-read the farm's note to find out we had turnips. Just made this soup for my husband for lunch. Served it room temperature. It was delicious, somewhat of a sweet taste.
