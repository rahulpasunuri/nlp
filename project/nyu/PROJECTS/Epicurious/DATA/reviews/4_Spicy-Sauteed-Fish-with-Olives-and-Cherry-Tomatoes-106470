I like to make this dinner on a fairly regular basis. I will tyically finish with a generous squeeze of fresh lime with the entire dish laid over a generous bed of Arugula. Everyone loves it and it takes about 20 minutes. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Spicy-Sauteed-Fish-with-Olives-and-Cherry-Tomatoes-106470#ixzz2P5b0XpT4

I've been making this since I saw it in the magazine years ago. It's fantastic, but I would never dream of serving it without a big squeeze of lemon at the end. It really wakes up the dish's flavors. Soooo good. So healthy!

Forgot to add throw in some chopped up sun dried tomatoes as that really adds to the flavor--use a little bit of the sun dried oil, too! A party pleaser!! I presentation is beautiful!

This has become one of our favorites but with modifications: I use a tomato tapanade that is made with heirloom yellow and red cherry tomatoes, add rice vinegar, golden raisans, cilantro and season--cook over low heat but don't break up tomatoes. Fry the tilapia in olive oil, and serve over a bed of arugula and top with tapanade---delicious!

Rating: 4
I made this once as written, and many, many times since as suggested by another reviewer - broiled. I did make an adjustment to their method, however, as broiling browned my tomatoes too quickly before it cooked the tilapia through. (I used tilapia loins, which are a bit thicker.) I bake at 400 until the fish is cooked through and then broil at the end to roast the tomatoes. I have left the parsley out and it's still been great.

This was really yummy. I used San Marzano canned cherry tomatoes with the sauce, and since I didn't have parsley, I used some thyme, rosemary and sage. I also added some steamed spinach and served over white rice. Really good. I would definitely make it again

This was a refreshing change to my usual tilapia dishes. Very good. I cut down spice to 1/4 tsp. as did not want too much of a kick. Simple preparation.

My mouth still waters thinking of this dish from last night! Our tomatoes haven't been producing enough with this heat, so I took what cherry toms we had and also threw in some chopped sun dried in oil. I also tossed in some fresh basil and cooked, broken fava beans with the saute' (the chef's comments of fava beans inspired that) and had sun dried tomato and herb crusty bread to dip in the juices - heaven!

Excellent recipe for any locally available white fish. If serving with rice make extra sauce by adding some more chopped tomatoes and lemon juice. Delightfully tangy and spicy;great for a summer or winter dinner menu.

Why 3 forks instead of 4? Why on earth would you take the time to fry this when you can broil it in no time, get a nice caramelization on the tomatoes, and (if you cover your baking sheet with foil) totally clean up in seconds? Just line a baking sheet with foil, crinkling it up a bit to allow the olive oil to run underneath, grease the foil with olive oil to keep the fish from sticking, salt and pepper both sides of the fish and top with remaining ingredients. Broil about 4 - 6 inches from broiler (depending on whether you have gas or electric broiler) for about 15 minutes and you are done. EASY.

Rating: 4
Just finished this easy, easy recipe & it was delicious too. I made the recipe exactly but sized it down for one serving. I would make it again with modifications. For example, it says to add the red pepper & parsley to the skillet after the fish. Really? Before the garlic? Next time I will add the remaining ingredients (after fish) in this order: garlic, tomatoes, olives, parsley & red pepper. That way everything can saute accordingly, but I would definitely make again.

Rating: 3
The taste of this was very good but I felt like it needed a bit of liquid so I added a dash of wine. It could have been more. I think there were too many olives, but the taste was very good. I used a blend of fresh parsley and basil and served it over olive oil smashed red skinned potatoes with some fresh herbs. I will definitely make this again with some more tomatoes/liquid.

Rating: 4
Superb recipe!! I did not add tomatoes because they are not in season and had to use cod instead of tilapia. But still yummy! I served it with a side of tabbouleh salad with romaine leaves and a piece of sourdough bread to cleanse the palate. Definitely a new favorite and will have to try with shrimp as suggested by another viewer.

The beauty of this is that it is so tasty, easy, and quick! My husband was very iffy about this before I cooked it, but was practically licking the plate later on! The only problem we had was that adding chili flakes to a hot pan makes a lot of acrid smoke. Next time, I will add it with the tomatoes/olives. Also, it helps to put a lid on the pan after the tomatoes are added, so that the juices do not evaporate.

I have made this several times as it is incredibly simple, healthy and always turns out great. I have substituted basil for the parsley similar to many other reviewers on here. I have also made with mini heirloom tomatoes which was delicious with the basil. Another time I added artichoke hearts which worked nicely with the tomatoes and olives.

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. Used tilapia and halved the recipe to serve 2 but still used 5 garlic cloves as we love garlic. I was so tempted to used canned diced tomatoes, but ended up buying "super sweet grape tomatoes" from Costco which were very sweet. DH (picky) is not a fan of olives but he liked this dish.

I made this exactly as written. Delicious and, I think, very versatile. For example, any firm fleshed fish would be good; if you don't have the olives, anchovies would be an interesting substitute. A spritz of white wine could be added and even a smattering of fresh bread crumbs with a quick flash under the broiler would work well. A wonderful basic recipe with room for creativity, if you feel like having some fun.

I decided to try this recipe, this evening, for our dinner. I had fabulous results. The fish was cooked perfect and the flavors were lovely together. I used tilapia fillets, as that is what I had on hand. I did not have cherry tomatoes in the pantry, so I subed some ripe roma tomatoes, cutting them into wedges. The recipe turned out fantastic and my husband enjoyed dinner very much. I highly recommend this dish to everyone.

Rating: 4
This was great. I wanted something a little more meaty than tilapia, so used cod, but it flaked too much, so I'd probably use tilapia or roughy next time. Paired it with Creamy Lemon Rice from epicurious and a dry Pinot Gris, as suggested by the wine guy at the store. Great dish!

This was a perfect way to use the bounty of cherry tomatoes (mostly sungolds) from our garden. Delicious. I used true cod, and served in alongside sauteed summer squash with basil.

Rating: 4
It's as good as they say it is. I would have given it 3.5 forks, but the ease of preparation and the simplicity of the dish coupled with its tastiness gives it a 4. I made it just as written, using red snapper. Others have suggested reducing the oil, or baking without oil... I wouldn't do either. These white fish fillets are pretty lean and bland and can use the added richness that the olive oil provides, not to mention the flavor. Don't skip or skimp on any of the ingredients and you will be rewarded. (Even some who claimed they did not like olives still liked this sauce.)

Rating: 3
Like everyone else said, this recipe was extremely quick, easy, and delicious. I like the idea of a baked version, because I felt like a fatty eating all that oil, even if it was olive oil. I didn't think that it was at all spicy, but I do go through a few bottles of hot sauce per month. So just use common sense when adding the red pepper flakes--hot much heat can you handle? I served this with pesto-tossed orzo, which was perfect, and the whole thing was ready in less than 15 minutes.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! I make it all the time and it always comes out beautifully. I would recommend doubling the recipe as it goes quickly at the dinner table. Make sure you don't make it too spicey (add the crushed red pepper a little at a time) because it does have quite a kick to it.

I love this recipe! It is quick, inexpensive, and easy to prepare. It has a ton of flavor and everyone I've made it for loves it.

Also, you can adjust the amount of red pepper to make it as spicy as you like! I highly recommend!

It's very easy to adapt this recipe to your own taste. I add onion and mushrooms to the sautee... And green as well as calamata olives. I also use baked tilapia, seaseoned with salt and pepper, and cut down on the oil. DELICIOUS! I serve with grilled asparagus and red potatoes or rice...

I have been making this dish for the last 4 years. I made it the first time the way the recipe stated and as I felt it came out way too oily. Since then I have modified it by baking the fish in a foil pouch with the sauce ingredients spooned over. I also add a little lemon juice, and some olive juice for liquid since I omit most of the oil, but a splash. If I have cilantro, sometimes I use that too. I know this is different from the original recipe, but I love the flavours and ingredients in this recipe and I find it easily lends itself to experimentation. I make this about once or twice a month.

Ok I loved this recipe so I gave it 4 stars, I followed what other viewers suggested and used olive tapenade and capers and added a little mushrooms, but you can always add whatever veggies you like. The rest I kept the same. I did also lightly coat the fish in flour and shake off excess starch. The dish was great, however if you use the tapenade make sure you taste before adding salt, since it is a bit salted. I think this would be much better over pasta than fish, I didnt feel the fish had much flavor I should have followed another person's suggestion and coat the fish in the sauce and let it simmer in that to absorb the taste after I sautéed the fillets. I look forward to adding the extra sauce over pasta for dinner tomorrow. I cooked ratatouille and used that as a side dish to this meal. Wonderful.

Rating: 0
Delicious! The combination of flavors is amazing. I did cut down on the oil to about 1 tablespoon for dietary reasons and instead crushed the tomatoes after they had cooked for 2 or 3 minutes to let the tomato juices combine the flavor of the ingredients.

This was incredible. So simple, light, fresh and popping with flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had green olives on hand and it worked beautifully. I served with canellini beans with caramelized red onion, basil and garlic, and pan seared green beans. This will go on the regular rotation and is sophisticated enough for company.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. My teenage son who doesn't like tomatoes or fish even liked it. I lightly floured the fish and added some chopped scallions to the mix. I didn't have olives on hand...but the tomato/scallion/parsley/g arlic mixture was phenomenal. Like other reviewers I deglazed the pan with a little white wine and added lemon juice to the sauce at end. Great leftovers! I also unintentionally omitted the red pepper and it may not have lived up to the spicy title but it was just a perfect FISH meal for my family. I will make this many times more!

I served this with a side of angel hair pasta with a little olive oil, chopped cilantro and a bit of feta cheese. We were smacking our lips through the entire meal. My critic gave it an A++. This is definitely worthy of serving to company and goes together in no time. Thanks for another winner.

Great flavor, but I needed something lower in fat, with less prep and clean-up, so I created a baked version that turned out fantastic. In a covered baking dish, mix together only 1 Tbsp olive oil, and all the ingredients except the fish. (I added a couple of sundried tomatoes that I'd soaked and chopped.) Place the fish on top, pat it to get a little oil on it, flip the fish over and press it down into the tomatoes and olives. Cover and bake at 375 degrees for about 10 minutes; turn the fish and bake another 5 minutes or so. Voila! No messy stovetop, less oil, FABULOUS flavor!

This is a quick and healthy dish that approaches restaurant quality. The presentation is very pleasing and it's light enough to eat for dinner on a hot summer night.

Quick, easy and great presentation. I used a medley of different colored cherry tomatoes so the colors/presentation was beautiful (red, yellow,etc.) I dredged the fish in flour, along with salt, pepper and some cajun seasoning.

I used these shortcuts and still had a great result!

I just made it yesterday. It is wonderful!!!! Very easy to make. Instead of cherry tomatoes, I uses grape tomatoes.

Be sure to follow the recipe and really cook the tomatoe/olive salad only two minutes or even less.

I made a few mistakes and learned a few lessons with this recipe. I didn't just a non- stick pan, so my fish stuck to the pan. Not terribly bad, but enough to leave a crusty coating on the pan that was enough to start burning with continued heat. Rather than add parsley and red pepper, I went ahead and added all the tomatoes. They released juices and that did a wonderful job of pulling up good crusty bits. I then added the rest of the ingredients and let it cook down just a bit. I agree with others that ample sauce is good. I bought 4 tilapia fillets, which turned out to be about 1.25 lbs. I made full recipe of sauce. That gave me plenty of tomato sauce. In fact, I had leftovers which I served with pasta and sauteed shrimp for dinner next evening.

I've made this almost every week for the past five. Here's how I like it: Salt and pepper the fish and then dip in flour. Saute then remove. I generally chop the parsley, but I use pitted olives from the jar (from Trader Joes), and put in 5 cubes of frozen garlic and 1-2 cubes of frozen basil (also from Trader Joe's). If I'm really busy, I use the frozen parsely cubes as well. I put whole (not halved) grape tomatoes. I saute all of these ingredients together to save time. When it is ready (less than 5 minutes), I deglaze with white wine for a few minutes and then return the fish to warm on top of the mixture. I sometimes add zucchini in the mix as well. I use the frozen brown rice packages from TJ's. It's so easy and takes no time at all. Perfect for a weeknight meal. It's wonderful.

We love this dish! I've made it twice, and prefer it with snapper over tilapia and basil over parsley. I didn't bread the fish, but was very generous with the olive oil, which gave a lovely golden brown crust on the fish. I also added zucchini, quartered and sliced, throwing it in with the parsley. I served it over couscous. Next time we make this I'll add a couple splashes of white wine at the end to brighten it up a bit.

This was really delicious. I tweeked it a bit, based on reviews, and will make it again and again the same way. I dredged the tilapia filets in panko seasoned with s&p and garlic powder, sauteed in 1/4 cup oil, loved the crust. I also sub'd fresh basil for the parsley (all I had), that could go either way as I love both. Finally, I had fresh zucchini on hand, so I sliced and sauteed that with crushed red pepper and olive oil for a couple minutes before adding the sliced grape tomatoes, garlic and kalamata olives (my local grocery market sells them pitted - yay - so they are easy to chop). All in all, a very easy, delicious and healthy one-dish meal! Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe...made it twice already, then the unimaginable...could not find it in my files and could not remember where I found it...thankfully, it came from Epicurious and I was able to find it again....now in my recipe box online and printed....This recipe is fresh and delicious and yet so simple to make...just like a dish from one of my favorite restaurants...

This is a really great tasting and simple recipe. I've made this several times and tried a few different things. First, the deglazing with white wine is excellent. I've tried this with cherry, grape, and roma tomato, and so far grape is probably my favorite. To save time and also add a little extra flavor, I use a pre-made olive tapenade in place of the kalamata olives. It's already pre-chopped, has a nice blend of olive varieties, is easy to measure out, and has other herbs in the tapenade that adds a more complex flavor. It's easy enough to find in most delis. I get the one at Costco and keep it in the back of my fridge just so I can always make this when I'm not in the mood to make something really elaborate. I've also tried adding a variety of other vegetables such as asparagus, green beans, and snow peas so the sauce would be a little more substantial. For the tilapia, I recommed making a very light crust. I first grind salt and pepper over both sides of the fish. Then I mixed together a little cornstarch, fresh ground pepper, and salt and dredged the fillets through that. You won't need a lot. Make sure to shake off the excess starch before searing in the pan. The cornstarch forms a nice crust that helps hold in the moisture and keeps the fish from crumbling into unrecognizable pieces when you place it back in to the sauce to simmer near the end. I've also tried making this with salmon for those who like a fish with a stronger flavor. When using salmon I make a simple herb crust ans sear it in the pan than serve it on a bed of the pasta and sauce rather than cooking the salmon in the sauce itself. I've also tried substituting chicken and apple sausage for the fish and that's worked out well. This last time, I added cooked pasta shells into the sauce and let it simmer awhile so the pasta really picked up the flavors.

Made this last night with snapper and my fish-resisting family likes it a lot. I added a dash of wine with the tomatoes and could easily see this with boneless chicken breasts too. Definitely a great and easy way to get fish-averse dinners to dig in.

Comes out great all the time - I've been making this recipe since it was first printed. The only bad experience I've had with this recipe is when I put in 1/2 cup of crushed red pepper flakes instead of 1/2 teaspoon (yes, I did have company & no, they did not like extra hot & spicy foods) :). I will not repeat that mistake again.

Rating: 3
Second time making this recipe. Thought I'd share that I was able to find pitted kalamatas at the deli counter at my local grocer, rather than the canned/jarred food aisle. Made this a lot quicker and easier. Also in response to the recent reviews, using a full 1/4 cup of olive oil with the salt and pepper on the outside of the fish yields a nice crispy crust on the fish which adds a lot of flavor that the tilapia, which is rather bland, needs. Also, the crust seals in the juices. You may be able to cook it with less oil, but you don't get the same effect of the golden outside crust and the fish may dry out before it is completely cooked. Also, I think kalamatas or other type of greek olives are important for the flavor of the dish. Plain old black olives sliced in a can just wouldn't do this justice.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, quick and easy to make. I used orange roughy, grape tomatoes and a combination of marinated mushroom and green olives stuffed with garlic. Some family members do not like olives so I substituted the marinated mushrooms, but added the olives for those that do like them. It was very, very good. I will definitely make this dish again.

I used the freshest ingredients, and this dish couldn't have been any easier. I cooked it with an Italian theme and my boyfriend's tastebuds in mind, and it was a total hit. Very easy, impossible to mess up, and packed full of flavor. Beautiful presentation as well, all those little tomatoes and chopped olives--looked beautiful. I added white wine to deglaze, during the final phase of the recipe. Very, very good.

Bought Tilapia because it was on sale and then went to epicurious and this recipe jummped out at me. Wow! I always use the critiques. Anyway, what an amazing recipe even the second time around. I will try some of the suggested variations. I used black olives out of need. I think I have seen sliced black olives in a can. hmmmmmmm. I think capers would add the zest of the fancier olives. Served it over brown rice with some crusty bread. Make again? You bet. How about with chicken tender cuts? You could go on forever with this recipe. I agree with the person who suggested that what's not to like about olives, tomatoes, and herbs.

I added slice zucchini at the end before the tomates and this gave it even more substance.

Rating: 4
The first time I made this, I followed the recipe without changes. It was wonderful. I now this every-other week. Both the olives and tomatoes are expensive; to save alittle money I altered the cherry tomatoes with canned stewed tomatoes (Italian flavor or Mexican flavor). When I do not have the olives on hand, I use canned olives, sliced. Add more red peppers if you want it to be spicier. Add more garlic, too. As noted in another review, I too agree the amount of Olive Oil is excessive.

Rating: 4
My boyfriend and I love this recipe. The only thing is that we think the 1/4 cup of olive oil might be a type-o, as less than a 1/4 tsp is needed! I tried with 1/4 cup last time and it was tasty - but really, really heavy. This time I used a few sprays of olive oil from my refilable oil spray bottle, and it was perfect (if not still too much!) For this reason, I'm astonished that others have followed this recipe to a tee... but other than the olive oil amount, it is AMAZING.

Four forks because the recipe, as is, is really great. It's simple flavors come together perfectly. I'm not a recipe person, but every once in awhile, I follow one exactly. I'm always assuming that before I serve it, I'll add something. Not in this case. Perfect.

This was very good and a nice easy meal to make for company. I used a greek olive mix and good italian canned plum tomatoes. i deglazed the pan with the white wine we had for dinner and added some butter at the end to mellow out the acidity of the sauce. also, i used halibut cheeks rather than tilapia and served the whole thing over pasta. not a show stopper but definitely worth a repeat!

Rating: 3
Good stuff, especially with the changes recommended by other reviewers: I substituted basil for the parsley, as I'm not a fan of the latter, and dredged the tilapia in egg then Italian bread crumbs & fresh grated reggiano. I let the fish soak up some flavor by sitting atop the tomato mixture for the last few minutes, and then I deglazed the pan with white wine & threw in some butter. Pretty easy, esp. if one chops everything ahead of time. I was happy to find pitted kalamata olives. Served over brown basmati rice with sauteed spinach on the side, with a bottle of Argentinian malbec.

Rating: 3
This is a lovely dish that is full of flavor and has the benefits of being healthful, colorful and not over-taxing for work night preparation. I used tilapia and the white wine deglazing tip mentioned by many others. My husband and I both enjoyed it. I took cold leftovers wrapped in a flatbread for lunch the next day and was quite pleased from the departure of a typical tuna salad sandwich.

Rating: 3
This was wonderful. Used basil added at the last minute instead of parsley and upped the amount of hot pepper. Also dreged the tilapia in seasoned flour as others suggested. I'm not a big fish person, and I really enjoyed it. Hubby is already asking for it again. Great!

Rating: 3
Very good! However, I suppose this is only quick and easy if you can locate chopped Kalmatas or pitted Kalamatas. Removing the pits and chopping enough to yield a full cut was rather time consuming. Used grape tomatoes (as could not find cherry) and added just a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan as others suggested. Just had leftovers for lunch... even better than last night as the fish really absorbed the flavors, which had a chance to marry. Fresh, light, flavorful! A keeper!

Everyone thinks it is so gourmet and we know that we just threw it on the stovestop right before they came.

PERFECT Valentine's day dinner! Simple, so that i could spend more time with my honey instead of in the kitchen and he was THRILLED with the flavors (and he usually turns his nose up at hot tomatoes, ha!) I did take pointers from other reviewers - deglazed with a Viognier (this is my FAVE white to cook with), used mushrooms, artichoke(just a 1/4 chopped) and put the lightly seared fish back into the sauce and veggies pan to soak up the goodness - and butter at the end to thicken the sauce. Oh, and what else.. MUCH LOVE!!

This was just okay for me. I used 1/2 olives and 1/2 capers. It's a horrible time of year for tomatoes in Ohio so it might be better in the summer. I would try it again adding white wine (as a previous reviewer suggested) and waiting until I can get my hands on some better tomatoes.

I just made this for the second time, and it wasn't as good as I remembered--or as a lot of the reviews here would suggest (fork inflation?). I agree with the reviewers who said tilapia is bland, and for some reason the flavors didn't really come together, though I like all the ingredients. Next time I make this, I might add more parsley to balance the salt of the olives, and make sure I use ripe tomatoes (hard to find in January). Also will be more generous salting the fish at the sauté stage and may try deglazing with white wine as a number of you suggested. I always enjoy reading the reviews here and have learned a lot from the suggestions posted. Thanks, all, and happy cooking.

Excellent! Delicious! Absolutely divine! A definte keeper! My husband loved it, too, and thought that I had made it before. I checked the reviews, but no, this was a first. I didn't have cherry tomatoes, so I used a can of whole peeled tomatoes (drained), and half of a fresh tomato that I had left over(I was only making half of the recipe, because it was just the 2 of us). And I used a can of black tomatoes (drained) rather than fresh. I'm sure that it would be even better if fresh inredients were used. And as a bonus, it is really quick and easy, and only 1 pan for easy clean up. Ths recipe is a winner all around. I served it with a Greek Salad (with Feta and the leftover olives from the fish recipe) and rice sauteed until golden in butter, and then boiled, covered, until finished with chicken broth. I part rice, 2 parts liquid. Enjoy!

Quick, very tasty, and easy to prepare! I have made this twice now and only recommend one change. I put the fish into the sauteed mix to reheat the thin fillets and let the rather bland fish soak up some of the flavors instead of just covering the fish with them. It really improved the experience!

This was great. Did add a little more garlic than called for (by accident), used combo oil and butter, and deglazed the pan with white wine as others suggested. Also, after browning the fish on one side, I removed the fillets and cooked the other ingredients for a minute and added the white wine to the pan. After about another minute, I added the fish back to the pan, uncooked side down and let simmer for a few minutes longer. The fish broke up a little, but tasted fantastic.

I halved the recipe and substituted the olives with 1 tblsp. capers and did not have parsley on hand so used a bit of diced onion in place of it.

The first time i made this, i followed the directions as is. This time, i tried it with catfish, and i baked it rather than sauteeing it. i prepared the sauce in the skillet first (sauteed garlic first, added parsley and pepper flakes, added tomatoes and olives, squished the tomatoes a bit). Then i salted and peppered the fish, put it in a baking dish, and poured the sauce over. Baked it in a 425 oven for about 17 minutes. I did like baking it better, but you need a fish with more substance to it than catfish. i did it with tilapia or snapper the first time, and i remember the texture of the fish was more appealing. so NEXT time, i'll stick with the better fish but bake it. it could be perfect then =).

I was out of kalamata olives so I used plain black olives....to compensate for the saltiness and zip the kalamatas would have given this dish, I added about 1/4 cup or so of capers and some chopped green olives, (as a few other reviewers suggested)..a little extra garlic and that's it! Absolutely fantastic and what a gorgeous dish it made with all the colors of the black olives, green olives, tomatoes, etc. Very, very quick and easy too!!! I don't often make the same recipe twice because I love to experiment, but this one I will definitely make again!

I made this as written, and it was perfect. My husband kept rolling his eyes and groaning, saying it was perfect. My kids ate it too, so it must've been ok. :-)

Loved the simplicity of this recipe. Didn't have the parsley but did throw in some capers and a squirt of lemon juice at the end. Yummy summer recipe!

I love these simple, ingredient-driven recipes. Instead of cherry tomatoes, I found some fresh red and yellow pear tomatoes. I also added some nice green olives, a splash of Sav Blanc, and topped with a chiffonade of basil and a squirt of lemon. Delicious.

I made this dish for company and it was a HIT! Not only does it have a great presentation, but its easy and fast to prepare - allowing you to spend minimal time in the kitchen! Loved it and will try it with artichokes next time.

FABULOUS!! I added a splash of white wine, green olives, yellow peppers, and a little more garlic. My fiance helped himself to two HUGE servings. The leftovers were even better. The sauce would be great over pasta. I found it very easy to prepare too. I will definately make this again.

I have made this recipe numerous times! I found this recipe when searching for a recipe that used talipia since my fish market gave me some for free to try. I have also used the sauce over halibut and even mahi-mahi and it has been wonderful. I usually add a handful of mild chopped green olives to the kalamata ones. I also use a small amount of dried parsley if I don't have fresh around. This recipe is amazing, it really does remind me of a "Naples" inspired recipe!

Delicious. Didn't have the olives but tasted great anyway.

This was a great fast recipe. I made it with the sundried tomatoes, as another reviewer sugggested (I was out of fresh tomatoes). It was excellent.

This is my wife's favorite dish. I add some pieces of kale which gives it some nice green and something a bit crunchy, depending on how long you cook the kale. I used slightly lower heat to keep the fish from tasting "fried".

My husband and I loved this dish. It was really easy and had lots of flavor. We will definitely make this again.

I prepared this for company using Tilipia. We all LOVED it. I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh. This is a definite keeper.

I've made this 3 times, it easy and super tasty, it is a standard for me now. The only negative is that I live in a small apartment and the smell of the meal lingers for a couple of hours after dinner...its a good smell...but everyone in the building knows what I've had for dinner...again

This deserves a 3 forks for taste, but given its time-taste bud value ratio, you can make a case for 4 forks! Simple and elegant, definetly a keeper!!!

A very good tilapia recipe...just spicy enough and very flavorful with the olives. I used grape tomatoes and added a can of artichoke hearts, quartered - it was Valentine's Day, after all!

This is a simple dish that has great flavors. Added a bit more garlic and used Santa Barbara brand black olives instead of kalamata. I like the spice the red pepper flakes add. Everybody loved it.

This was a very easy recipe with wonderful flavors. I halved the recipe with no problems. My husband, who's not an olive lover, didn't think the sauce was overpowering at all!

This was a complete hit in our house, too. I used orange roughy, grape tomatoes (what I had on hand), and sprinkled feta cheese on the finished dish. A great addition to my list of favorites. Thanks!

This the best fish dish we've ever had! I used the Tilapia and added more garlic and a little more of the Kalamata olives for that nice bite it gives you.I also added more garlic and it really enhanced the cherry tomatoes flavor. This is GREAT!

We've made this dish twice in the last month and we gave it three forks each time. My kids loved it too!

Simple, quick, and delicious. I used tilapia and added sliced crimini mushrooms. I had some left over, which made an excellent sandwich!

Not impressed with this recipe. Found the flavours didn't penetrate the fish. It reminded me of having plain stewed tomatoes poured on top of fried fish. On a more positive note, the cherry tomatoes did however look quite nice; I'll incorporate the look into other dishes.

This was both tasty and lovely to look at. I used Whiting as I found some cheap and it was great! I served with brown rice and sauteed zucchini which also tasted good with the olive/tomato mixture.

Yummy...I loved this dish! Very simple to make but with a lot of depth of flavor (of course how can you go wrong with these ingredients?) I served this with homemade mashed potatoes and it was a hit.

Absolutely delicious!! I added cumin and paprika when I sauteed the talapia and served with a small side of hummus. The tomato and olive topping makes a really attractive presentation.

Just made this last night. Very good! Since I usually cook for one and like easy, fast, but good recipes, I am putting this recipe in my rotation.

Very quick to make and delicious. I would not have cooked the Tilapia for as long next time. We used grape tomatoes and spicy moroccan olives. We would definitely make it again.

Great meal and fast. I have found that grape tomatoes are sweeter and add a little more zing and sometimes I spash a little savignon blanc (2T) into the sauce. Don't overcook the tomatoes and olives or they lose their flavor!

With a garden full of cherry tomatoes, thought I'd give this a try. Loved the sauce, iffy on the tilapia. Next time, I'll try the sauce over grilled swordfish.

fast, easy and good. to the cook from NY,I'm just curious how something with such strong flavors like garlic, sweet tomatoes and olives can have 'no flavor?' oh well - to each his own!

Amazingly easy to prepare, only took about 25 minutes, absolutely delicious, prepared exactly as directed, my family already has it down scheduled for next week's meal!!! Thanks!!

Delicioso! This was as good as I imagined. Isn't this classic Puttanesca sauce? It's great. Can't wait to eat the leftovers. My only gripe would be that I couldn't find seedless Kalamatas!
