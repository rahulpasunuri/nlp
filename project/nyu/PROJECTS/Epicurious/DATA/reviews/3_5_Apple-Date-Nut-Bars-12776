Yum! These are a little time consuming compared to other cookie bars (all the fine chopped apples and dates) but they are definitely worth the effort. I made a few changes to the recipe - I had small local Gold Rush apples on hand instead of Granny Smith so I used 4 small apples. Also, having read the other reviews I decided to use a slightly smaller pan (11X7 instead of 9X13) and pack down a really thick crust. No problems with crumbling as a result. I also used walnuts instead of pecans in the crust and I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on the apple filling before putting on the top crust. None of these changes changed the basic idea of the recipe in my opinion.

I had my doubts as I watched it come together... wondering how this was all going to form a "bar". Well, it came out of the oven, and so far, it looks like it will have to be eaten with a fork, on a plate, as opposed to with your fingers as a "bar". I am going to refridgerate it, and hope it firms up overnight. I really wanted a bar, not another crisp type of dessert. I can see why one reviewer said it was a lot like mush.

A really great bar... and adds a nice variety to a brownie tray. Easy to make and it freezes wonderfully. I added 2 additional tablespoons of butter to the crust and it holds together just fine.

I also wanted to use up some apples & make a lunch box treat; these are very good. I used steel cut oats instead of pecans (due to a nut allergy), and so the bars still had some nice crunch and fiber. (Thanks to a previous reviewer's suggestion for oats!) I included dates but think they'd be good without, too.

I have an apple tree and was looking for a way to use the apples in a recipe that's less "formal" (and easier) than an apple pie. This recipe has been a big hit. It is a bit crumbly, but if you pat the crust down well, it holds together just fine. Here are my modifications: No dates. I used 5 cups sliced apples in place of the apples+dates. Chopping the apples isn't necessary -- sliced is just fine. I used 1 c pecans and 1/2 cups almonds. Next I want to try all or part oatmeal instead of the nuts -- to make the recipe easier. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 cup Splenda to the filling after it was done cooking. Upped cinnamon to 2 tsp and dropped salt to 3/4 tsp (try 1/2 tsp next -- 1 whole tsp salt just seems way too much). Also added about 1/2 shot bourbon to the filling after it was done cooking. :P

Wonderful and easy. I've found, depending on the sweetness of the dates & apples that you can leave out the sugar in the filling and it's still fabulous.

These bars are delicious; kind of like an apple crisp. I patted the bottom crumb layer very firmly into the pan and the bars held together well. By the way, a half-recipe worked perfectly in an 8x8 inch pan.

Um-um good! Some guests left with the recipe print-out! It's a keeper for sure. Yes very crumbly, but I cut them into large squares and served with plates and forks...AND ice cream!

Wow, I didn't expect these to be this good (I'm more of a chocolate dessert kind of person) But yum! These are incredible. I made no changes; they are perfect.

A great deviation from boring old brownies and chocolate chip cookie bars. Very tasty. Like other reviewers noted, mine too fell apart pretty easily. Not sure why. But that won't keep me from making these again. Next time, I'll just cut them into smaller, bite-sized squares.

These are great--buttery and full of flavor. They are so easy, too! Wonderful for a post-caroling party.

These bars got rave reviews from everyone. I also made a very complicated and decorative apple cake and it was a definite second best to the bars. They have excellent flavor, even though they are a bit crumbly in texture. Easy to make and delicious.

Mushy and bad--certainly not a finger-food item or a typical bar cookie. More like an applesauce pie in rectangular form, and not at all what I was looking for.

My family and I loved them. However, they taste even better the next day.

We loved these bars and actually enjoyed it more the day after. Definitely make it again.

I had a hankering for the traditional date-nut bars (of school bake sale fame), but I don't have a recipe in my cookbooks. This recipe actually surpassed my expectations! The apples lighten the filling delightfully, and the pecan crumb crust is a richer version of the oatmeal original.

A delicious and easy recipe. I halved it and baked them in an 8"x8" pan- it worked great. I also substituted Jonagold apples.
