This recipe is awful and misleading. The caramel recipe is incorrect and led to a massive crystallization of the sugar; I must replace two saucepans and a wooden spoon. Adding the ras-el-hanout spice makes the pears and caramel (I eventually had to use a different caramel recipe) extremely bitter and disgusting. I had to restrain myself from vomiting after tasting it. I wanted to try a Moroccan recipe, but this one proved to be absolutely repulsive and atrocious. My taste buds want to sue. I did find a recipe for traditional Moroccan mint tea which turned out very well in contrast to the spiced pears recipe. I believe this recipe for pears has permanently turned me off of spiced Moroccan food, especially anything involving ras-el-hanout. Bon Appetit indeed.

it would taste better without the add ground ras-el hanout in it. you many need t add a little more sugar to it.

I always have trouble with caramel and true to my history, while whisking in the butter the entire mixture crystalized into a crumbly mess. I continued regardless, and after adding the water and continuous whisking it eventually reincorporated. The presentation and flavors were lovely.
