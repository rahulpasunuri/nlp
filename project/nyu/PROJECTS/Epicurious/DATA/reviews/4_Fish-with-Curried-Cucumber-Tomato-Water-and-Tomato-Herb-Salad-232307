Made a few small tweaks: Made extra cucumber water, using my juicer and boiiled it down a bit to serve as a bit of a sauce/gravy over basmatic rice in addition to using it in the herb salad. Used our herbs and tomatoes fresh from the garden, and snapper fresh from a fishing trip to the Gulf. Recipe was DIVINE!!

I loved this! It was very similar to a dish I love at a nearby Thai restaurant. I made an extra pan of just sauce so it would be soupier when serving. It was excellent and healthy. Would make it again and could even change the vegetables and meat choices. You want healthier recipe, check this one: http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/halibut-in-creamy-wine-sauce! Try it now!

I agree with other reviewer that you need more of the cucumber tomato water, but I don't agree that it isn't worth it. Wow! It is a delicate flavor, however, and you don't want to overwhelm it with side dishes. I made a side of swiss chard with shallots and that was a mistake. It would have been perfect with just the water and tomato herb salad. I made with halibut, which is a hearty flavored fish, but I think that heartiness played off the delicate cucumber water. I bought a large cucumber and wizzed it with the tomato in my Vitamix, which really got the liquid and flavor out. I can't wait to try this on company and next time I'll make a nice loaf of sourdough to sop up the liquid.

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish the first time I made it. I have made it a half dozen times since. I skipped the cucumber tomato water the second time I made it and noticed that it didn't make a huge difference (one that was worth all the added effort)

This recipe was lovely. Although I made some changes. I used lime instead of lemon and red onion (as I did not have any lemons or scallions) And I grilled the Halibut instead of roasting it. The perfect light summer meal featuring the local tomatoes and herbs. My only recommendation would be to double the cucumber -tomato water and salad recipe. I found that I had to be too frugal with the sauce.

I found this dish delightful in many ways i have made it twice so far. On the other hand i only changed one thing, to reduce the tomato water I simmered rather then boiled. I found the water to be clearer and the flavor was almost 3 times more robust. The only downside i have found to this was the cooking time was another 30mins, but well worth it.

This is an excellent recipe!I used grouper fillets, with very nice results. If I changed anything, it would be to double the lemon in the herb salad. The curry adds a nice flavor. I will definitely make this one again.

We loved this! Did it a little different: I used fresh Norwegian salmon, and marinated it a little with lemon, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Then I also added avocado and cucumber to the salad and it was fabulous!

I tried this recipe for my friends, and I was a little scared, but they all loved it and I am planning to do it this week again...Merci beaucoup bon appetit...

This was good, but after all the trouble of making the cuke-water etc, it simply tasted like a tomato salad on top of fish. very disconnected. not bad, but not great, and not really worth the effort.

Fantastic dish. Challenging to make, but by no means impossible and its very much worth the effort. It is perfect for a spring or summer's evening. Might even be good room temperature served over greens. We made it with crispy potato latkes on the side to add some texture.

this is absolutly delicious. everyone I have made this for loves it. it is very light and healthy but full of flavor.I used halibut both times, but i'm sure the other fishes would taste just as good!
