I don't mind the expense for the ingredients. I found this dish well worth it and I will definitely make it next time I'd like to impress someone! Serve a heavier red with this dish, such as Chateauneuf du Pape or a nice Cabernet Sauvignon.

Very flavorful dish and easy to make. I halfed the hens so they would cook evenly. Also subsituted fresh Crimini mushrooms for the dried morels, cooking them in the stock and Madeira. Turned out perfect! Great dish for entertaining.

Fabulous!!!! Even with the cost of morel's I will make this many more times in the future. I reduced the sauce to 1/2 instead of "thin"

This was alright. The cost of the mushrooms should have made it wonderful but ... not really sure this dish is worth the money.

I made this during the 4th of July week when my grandchildren were visiting. I followed the entire recipe except that I split the Rock Cornish Hens in-half and roasted them on my gas grill. I pour the sauce over them and I served each ndividual half hen to each family memebr. 8 kids left nothing but bones. The adults (my kids) begged me for the recipe.

My guests raved about this, and after dinner, went into the kitchen and started eating the extra sauce from the pan on the stove! I made a couple of changes. First I added the mushrooms in with the stock and wine and let it all reduce for over 30 minutes until reduced by a little over half. Then I finished it with just a little (maybe a quarter cup) of heavy cream. A lovely dish to entertain with.

I made this last night for my husband and I using the full sauce recipe for the 2 of us. It was too much but sooo good. Definitely a company worth recipe. I served it a wild rice blend and Romaine and Red Onion Salad with Parmesan Balsamic vinagrette. Excellent dinner.

This is definitely a special occassion recipe like for Valentine's Day or a romantic dinner for 2. I have made some changes to the recipe over time though that have definitely improved it in my opinion. First, at the beginning I sprinkle a very generous amount of Herbs de Provence on the hens (along w/salt and pepper). Next I heavily rub down the inside cavities with crushed garlic cloves, and butter mixed with more Herbs de Provence and rosemary, followed by a few tablespoons of OJ. Next, I tilt up the hens and line the cavities with tall sprigs of rosemary and thyme (in generous amounts), and the stuff the center with a pre/partially cooked wild rice and mushroom mixture. The sprigs stick out so they can be removed easily later on, and they make a pretty presentation. Next comes the roasting and basting part, while the sauce is made. In the sauce I add an additional tbsp of fresh thyme leaves, and sometimes I use a mixture of half Merlot and half Marsala if I don't have any Madeira.

More like 2.5 forks. I was disappointed in the flavor I got from dried morels (especially considering the $)next time I will either substitute porcini or other "wild" fresh mushrooms. My family thorougly enjoyed the hens and sauce-just not the kick of I was expecting. I served it with classic risotto but a wild/brown rice blend would be good as well. Simplicity of cooking the hens & sauce of this recipe are a good fit for risotto prep.

Made this with chicken thighs (its what I had in the fridge) and port (again, what was on hand), and thought it was great. Actually I was surprised by how much we liked the sauce - it didn't seem like it was going to be that special when it was cooking, but it really did come together beautifully. I reduced it way longer than 25 minutes (probably more like an hour), and it had great depth. I think you could use fresh mushrooms (I used mostly the dried morels, but also a few fresh shitakes) without losing out on flavor.

Made this for a Valentine dinner party and it was a huge hit. Very simple too which means that you didn't spend all night in the kitchen. I didn't add as much stock and the sauce reduced just fine and if anything made the Madeira flavor more present. Will absolutely make this again

Couldn't find fresh Cornish hens so I got fresh Guinea hens instead. I felt that the cooking method in this recipe seemed blah so I added wedges of lemon, chunks of garlic and onion to the roasting pan and covered the fowl with slices of lean bacon. I made the gravy with both morel and porcini and it was delicious. Served this with baby carrots and sugar peas, and mashed sweet potatoes baked with brown sugar and butter.

I'm not a big fan of dried mushrooms now that most of them can be purchased in fresh form. I made this with approx 7 fresh mushrooms which I sliced then sauted in one tablespoon of butter over high heat to slightly brown them. Set them a side. I followed the recipe but cut it in half (we are only two people) reduced the sauce for 45 minutes but after 30 minutes add the sauted mushrooms and a 1/4 cup cream. Wonderful. Do not add salt in prior steps or it will be too salty, wait until the end per your taste.

This was just marvelous. Company good! The sauce is excellent and could be used on most any meat; flavor was elegant.

This was alright. I used Procini mushrooms and didn't let the sauce get thick enough so it had a woody thin quality. Overall it was good, yet I would have prefered different flavors.

Just to prove how versatile this sauce is...I used shitaki mushrooms AND instead of game hens, I cooked chicken tenders (boneless skinless chicken breast cut into strips) in my pan with olive oil and butter. After removing the chicken I then proceeded to make the sauce by adding the shallots, etc etc. My only point to this?...its not just for fancy Game Hens. Its very very good and easy. A bit time consuming, but the sauce reduces in about the same time the wild rice is done cooking! We already have plans to serve this again with company!

My husband made this for guests last night and the first thing they said to us upon arrival was "What is that INCREDIBLE smell? Our mouths started watering 'way down the hall!" The taste lived up to the smell! He made this as written, except he used shitake mushrooms and slipped a little fresh save and butter under the breast skin. Easy to do, delicious to eat! Perfect with wild rice pilaf!

Based on earlier comments, I picked this dish to serve for a dinner party, and boy was it a hit. Not only did the hens look nice, the sauce was "out-of-this-world" delicious. I only wish I would have made more of it -- (this didn't make quite enough). My guests were literally licking their fingers because it was so tasty. I served this with wild rice and glazed carrots. Mmm-Mmm Good!

A nice recipe for fans of "small fancy chicken." The morel mushrooms are a particularly nice touch, and they are good even if rehydrated.

I have made this 2 times now, most recently this past Christmas Eve for 9 dinner guests. It was even better than the first time, and everyone was raving the whole way through dinner (when they DID speak), licking their fingers in amazement. It is probably the most highly complimented dish I've ever made. I stuff the hens with goat cheese, fresh herbs (thyme and rosemary) and whole garlic sloves, which really compliment the sauce. I also brush melted butter over the hens, and dry rub them with herbs of provence prior to cooking. This last time, the store was out of madeira so I used 1/2 merlot and 1/2 marsala. Absolutely superb. Be sure to baste the hens at least 3 times during cooking too.

This was excellent. A huge hit at my last dinner party. There is no thickening agent in the sauce, (which can be made ahead of time), and I recommend slowly adding some diluted corn starch once you have achieved the flavor you want. But the more sauce the better, so don't thicken too much! The mushrooms are fabulous, and quite pretty.

This is absoutely scrumptious; however I made the full compliment of sauce for only two game hens and we had nothing left over. Also, again my experience with this relsulted in about 50% more time than estimated to reduce the sauce, but that's okay it's what I expected. Does anyone else have the same experience or a solution?

This recipe is incredible - the flavor was absolutely perfect, and the prep was not difficult at all. I couldn't get dried morels, so I used fresh and carmelized them - they were fantastic. I can't wait to make this dish for friends!

I cooked this dish for my introduction to cooking with morel mushrooms. It was wonderful! But I did make some of my own modifications - I stuffed the hens with goat cheese, garlic cloves, rosemary, chives and chopped morels (the goat cheese is an awesome compliment to the sauce) and used a dry rub of "herbs of provence" on the hens. I added a touch of cream, pink peppercorns, rosemary and chives to the sauce and served it up with peas and roasted potatoes! Next time I will reduce the sauce to a thicker consistency but I will definitely be making this for my next dinner party!! Yum!

The gentleman that I date and planned to spend Thanksgiving with informed me the day before Thanksgiving that he did not really care for Turkey - imagine the spin this sent me into :-) I quickly logged on and found this recipie for game hens - Its a great recipe I simmered down the demi glace till it was thick enough to coat a spoonback and used fresh morrels which are always a nice treat - the hens where tender and crisp skinned and the sauce made my companion moan in delight - gentle on salt when making this sauce - the reduction of beef and chicken stalk can be a bit salty for some.
