You may want to add another ingredient to give it more flavor - a little balsamic vinegar when tossed for example. As-is, it's a little too bland to be the main-course.

I used heirloom black cherry tomatoes and bowtie pasta (since it was what I had on-hand. For herbs I used fresh basil, oregano, thyme, and Italian parsley. I left the cheese out and it really didn't need it. It was easy, fast, and tasty. Use cherry tomatoes, other varieties won't work nearly as well. This recipe is a KEEPER!

Perfect for a hot summer night. I have a lot of herbs in my garden. This is a great use of them. I added chopped fresh mozarella.

I've been looking for a go-to pasta salad recipe all summer. This is it. Simple, versatile, and delicious, and it keeps beautifully in the fridge. I used strozzapretti pasta and chervil, marjoram, and chives since that's what I had on hand. I would cut down somewhat on the oil next time. It makes way more than 4 servings, even as a main course.

This is a great, simple recipe that I've made several times. I've varied the herbs (cilantro, parsely, and basil was particularly good) and varied the pasta (even used organic bicycle-shaped pasta for a theme party). It keeps incredibly well. I like to add grated romano cheese just before serving. A definite keeper.

Would make again if I needed a pasta salad in a hurry. Only used about 1/4 cup of olive oil and that was enough. Had oregano, basil and chives for the herb mix. Also, used on-the-vine tomatoes instead of cherry. Made with whole wheat rotini (all I had) and it was pretty good. This isn't a show-stopper dish but nice for summer.

Didn't really need as much oil as it calls for, if you are watching that sort of thing. Sustituted fresh Jersey tomatoes, and used a couple tbs. balsamic instead of the sugar. Fresh basil, parsley, oregano. If using reg. size tomatoes rather than the cherry, you may want to leave out most of the seeds. They make the dressing kind of watery, and take away from the visual appeal. Easy and colorful. Good for a cookout or picnic, holds up well.

Nice, simple recipe. I used larger tomatoes that worked out just great. I also added some fresh arugula along side the basil that added a nice taste. Make sure that you season it with enough salt to bring out the flavors.

Seattle, you can use just about anything depending on your preference: rosemary, thyme, oregano, parsley (flat or curly leaf aka Italian) basil, sage, marjoram. You can also use dry if fresh herbs are not available. Just be sure to use half the amount the recipe calls for.

Sorry but I am a dunce when it comes to fresh herbs. What did you use and amounts? Thanks
