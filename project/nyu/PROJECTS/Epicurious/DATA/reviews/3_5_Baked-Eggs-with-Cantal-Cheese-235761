Delicious and elegant way to serve eggs to a group of people. Made this for Christmas brunch, was a hit! Had to sub a few things: sharp cheddar for the cantal cheese which i didn't have on hand, equal parts sour cream and heavy cream for the creme fraiche, fresh thyme and parsley sprinkled over the top instead of chives. Was delicious! Only thing I would note is this definitely needed the full amount of cooking time - took it out earlier based on reviews saying it needed less time, but whites were still liquid - had to put it back in. Came out creamy yet light, will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious. So simple and elegant. I made this for a brunch with girlfriends and everyone loved it. I substituted Lancashire cheese- couldn't find Cantal anywhere.

I couldn't get Cantal Cheese so I used cheddar (also suggested as a substitution in a book about different varieties of cheese.) It was delicious but the yolks were a little runny for me. I'd try it again and cook it a little longer.

very tasty. held out one fork because yolks were hard. the whites were excellent, though i would recommend baking egg whites for 5 minutes and then adding yolk. very tasty layering prosciutto around ramekin and pulls right out by the crispy pieces hanging over.

Wonderful eggs. I used gouda cheese instead of cantal. These eggs are light, fluffy and very tasty.

I must admit I did use a mild white cheddar instead of Cantal, but what an easy and impressive egg dish this is. They came out perfect. Very tasty. If I had a bed & breakfast, I'd serve these every day. Simple preparation. My boyfriend loved these.

Easy, awesome presentation, and delicious. Any semi-firm mild cow cheese will do (like Emmental, Jack ... etc.) You do have to be OK w/ runny yolk which all my families adorn.

If you can't find Cantal at a cheese store near you, you can order it through igourmet.com

the food dictionary on this site says it's a French cheese similar to a good cheddar. Any decent cheese shop should be able to get it; if not, suggest an alternative cheddar to replace it. I agree, I can't wait to try this either!

A really lovely brunch dish, easy and elegant. Super good served with the bacon and funky English muffin strips from the same Gourmet article. rsc1157, if you can't find Cantal, try the recipe with gruyere, or a mix of swiss and white cheddar.
