DELICIOUS! The recipe as stated was enough for 5 lunches for a single woman like me. I put in 1 regular yam, 1 japanese yam, and 1 standard potato. I added half spinach and half kale and tossed in some leftover brussels sprouts. I also added some spicy chili pepper seasoning. Of note, I used Whole Foods chorizo, and like everything at WF, I found it very bland and saltless. Next time, I'll use a more mainstream brand of sausage.

I made this soup on a weeknight and it was incredibly easy and delicious! It took maybe an hour to make including prep and was really low maintenance. I used turkey sausage instead of pork sausage and the flavors were still incredible. Since there are only two of us, we had a LOT of leftovers and just froze them for a future time. This soup is definitely a keeper. Very filling but not heavy.

The only seasoning for this soup comes from whatever chorizo you use so choose wisely. I used a spicy ground chorizo from a Mexican market but next time I will use half the meat, add black beans and only use sweet potatoes. Definitely add smoked paprika as other users suggested.

This was so, so good. I made according to recipe and seasoned with Chipotle, Tony's and Hungarian Paprika. Will make again and try with chicken andouille.

I used a lot if Tony Chachere's seasoning in this soup and subed andouille. The result was spicy and hearty. Mashing up the potatoes is the key to giving this soup some substance.

WOW. I made this because I had sweet potatoes and sausage, and not much else! Exceptional is right. I used REAL Portuguese chorizo (always keep some in the freezer) and I believe that was the key to making this dish great. The flavors melded perfectly. Everyone raved!

LOVED! Substituted turnip for potato, which I thought added a nice flavor, and also used kale as others recommended, which I thought added nice consistency. Also kept chorizo in the pot the whole time. My husband felt it could have used more meats - we agreed on adding anther type of sausage - and crusty bread for dipping, which I agree with. Will make again with those changes.

This is a delicious soup -- and a great way to eat spinach if, like us, you aren't usually a big fan of it. We made it a bit healthier by using chicken chorizo sausage from our local Whole Foods.

very yummy, used steamed red kale instead of spinach, added spanish smoked paprika, two chopped tomatoes and a good splash of Sherry at the end.

This was great. Like others, I used Trader Joe's Chicken Andouille and it worked fabulously. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly and it turned out great. My potatoes didn't "break down" as others did and I only mashed them a few times (as recipe instructs)to chunk them up a little bit and it turned out great. I'm curious to try it with kale next time. Definitely a keeper.

No chorizo at my grocery store so I made it with kielbasa. I never took anything out of the pot from the start to cut down on the dishes. Yummy and warming! Very quick as well. Tasted much lighter than expected. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This soup is fast, delicious, filling, and reasonably healthy, more so if you use a lean sausage as I did, like chicken andouille, and homemade vegetable stock. Would have been even better with the linguica or Spanish chorizo, I'm sure. I found mashing the potatoes unnecessary and skipped that step. I find that soups with leafy greens in them tend to taste a bit off on the second day. To fix this, I wilt the greens in a separate pan, then put them into the bowls of soup when serving, rather than into the big pot. I just wilt more greens on future days when reheating leftovers, so they are always fresh.

Fantastic recipe!!! Made the recipe as written, except I only used sweet potatoes. I served it over brown rice -- Delicious. Next time I will use Kale or Swiss Chard in place of the spinach -- the extra body would really add to the dish. Definitely will make it again.

Simply my favourite combination of flavours. Eaten with a side of cornbread and butter--delicious!

As others had commented, I thought it needed a bit of tweaking, but not much. I added a packet of achiote when sauteeing the onions/garlic, a bay leaf and pinch of cumin. Chorizo and sweet potatoes compliment each other perfectly. A keeper for a cold winter's day!

Fantastic recipe. Used a mix of Italian, Maltese, Veal, and Rabbit sausages. Also substituted the spinach for swiss chard. Washed it all down with an Albert Bichot Pinot Noir. Good times.

This was easy and delicious! I halved the recipe, used Trader Joe's chicken andouille, and never took the sausage out of the pot. As a main course, it wouldn't serve 8 - maybe more like 5-6. Good comfort food for a cold evening.

Rating: 3
This was very good. It made a little less than it said it would. I used a bit more garlic, and substituted chorizo because I couldn't find any Portuguese linguica. My sweet potatoes completely broke down by the time my other potatoes softened, so as other reviewers noted, it became very stew like. It's both sweet and spicy; perfect for a cool autumn day.

Good stuff! I cooked this stew with chorizo. Instead of taking the sausage out, I cooked the sweet potato with the meat. Hearty and flavorful!

A good, hearty stew for a cold winter night. I followed the recipe with only a couple modifications: added 1 T Hungarian paprika to the onions and garlic during the saute, increased the spinach by half again as much, and added 2 T champagne vinegar before serving. Dust with more paprika, and voila!

Rating: 3
Like most, I also used chorizo, but sliced half of it and crumbled the other half. I only used sweet potatoes and found that the cooking time was much faster than predicted. Because I wanted more of a stew, I decreased the chicken broth to 4 cups. I also added two tbsp of wine vinegar to brighten the flavors. My husband who is not a big fan of sweet potatoes thought it was excellent for a cold Boston night and most supplies are on hand.

Rating: 3
It was GREAT. The sweetness of the sweet potato combined with the spiciness of the sausage and the creaminess just make it great for a cold day! Also, it went really well with an imperial pilsner :)

Rating: 1
I found this soup to be really bland and I guess I was expecting something with a bit more of a kick considering the chorizo. Also, despite trying to undercook the potatoes, they still fell apart and the soup became more of a mush. If I made this again, I definitely would not puree as instructed.

Rating: 2
I was excited to try this recipe based on the other reviews, but both my husband and I were less thank impressed. It was okay but I don't think I would make it again. Perhaps the smoked Portuguese sausage is critical to the soup. I used chorizo as recommended for a substitute but the flavor just wasn't enough.

Rating: 4
I'm giving this 4 stars because it was obvious to me that it would have been a 4-star dish if I had followed the recipe faithfully. I used Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo, which had good flavor but compromised the texture significantly. I haven't been vegetarian for years, and I had forgotten about the paradigm shift that one must make in order to enjoy a soy sausage! Everything else about the soup was great, and I plan to try the recipe again with the real thing.

Rating: 3
I had some swiss chard that needed to be used and some local Hawaiian style portuguese sausage; doesn't seem to be much oil in it, so didn't have to pour anything off. Halved all the ingredients except the chard and added a little more garlic to taste. Also added a lttle vinegar right at the end, as I see other review did. This was a wonderful meal and made plenty for dinner plus leftovers; will happily make again!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe with soy (vegetarian) chorizo from Trader Joes, all sweet potatoes, and kale from the farmer's market instead of spinach. I highly recommend all these substitutions as the soup was great!!! I used a lot of kale, diced the potatoes fine, used less broth, and crumbled instead of diced the chorizo. This made for a thick stew. Really tasty -- sweet, spicy, warm, and hearty. If you have a TJ's nearby and are looking for a vegetarian stew, try this!!

Rating: 4
This is, by far, the best soup recipe I have found on this site. DELICIOUS! I could not get linguica so i used chirizno instead. I did not drain the oil from the sausage (why throw out all that flavor!) but sauteed the onions and garlic in it. I also put a few cups of potatos in the cuisinart instead of mashing in the pot. Threwin about a 1/2cup cider vinegar at the end to punch it up again. It came out so good! Enjoyed it with some crusty sourdough bread. now if only someone had a tip for how to freeze soup with potatos in it..as I would love to put some of this away..but freezing cooked potatos always seems to ruin the soup. lara

This was excellent, my company raved. It was also very easy and quick to make. The only change I made was to add the spinach to the onions and garlic and "sweat" it before adding to the soup. All of my guests took copies of the recipe home with them.

My mum made this for a dinner party, but didn't get enough broth, so she used half and turned it into a thick and delicious stew. I have since made it as a stew, but took out the sausage and added parsnips and carrots in place of half the potatoes and added some toasted cumin seeds. I have made that version a number of times for rowing parties, and never could make enough as everyone kept asking for more. This is certainly a dish to be made repeatedly! Perfect for vegans!

For a healthier variety I use the chicken Andouille sausage from Trader Joes. No oil to drain after cooking the sausage and it still tastes great.

I come from a large Portuguese family and a very Portuguese grandmother who cooks wonderful food everyday. I made this soup for her with fresh couves (kale) from her garden in place of the spinach and some spicy linguiça from Goularts Sausage Company (a good friend of the family that not only owns a small sausage company down the street, but makes all the linguiça himself). It was excellent! My grandmother loved it. The sweet and spiciness of the soup was excellent, especially with some fresh bread. This ones a keeper!

Rating: 3
I added some red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of epazote for complexity. The soup needed some acidity for balance, so I put in about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar at the end of cooking. I think I'll use a hearty beer in lieu of some of the chicken stock to achieve the same end when I make it again. I also wonder whether a little freshly grated orange peel would be a nice addition. I made fresh corn tortillas as an accompaniment. This one's a keeper.

A good , hearty, week night soup, and as usual, even better the next day. To round out the seasoning, I used a cup of sofrito from "Daisy Cooks" that I keep on hand in the freezer and mixed it in with the onions. The cilantro, garlic and chile really accented the flavors. And, like others, I enjoy using heartier greens, such as kale, chard or collards.

This soup is a hit! I have made it several times now and every time it is a success. While I like smoked chorizo, I definitely prefer fresh. From the first time I made it and every time since, I have used fresh chorizo (in a pinch I've used hot Italian and it was still great.) Bake the sausage in the oven at about 425C, turning over half way though while the soup is doing its 20 minute simmer. Slice 'em up & voila! The sausage retains more of its flavour when baked. I use about 3 sweet potatoes, 2 large and 1 smaller and the recommended amount of white potatoes. I add a bit more broth and about a tsp. of paprika. As with most soups, this one is more flavourful the day after. This will be a staple soup for years to come and it is also a great post-run meal.

This soup turned out great. I had to add more olive oil after I removed the chiorzo with the onions and garlic so I didn't add anymore at the end. The spinach was a nice touch. Using some of the suggestions of other reviews I'm going to add corn or carrots so I don't get bored eating it for lunch more than 2 days! The only thing I didn't like was the grease from the sausage even though I drained it. Overall a great recipe.

This is a great recipe and you can pretty much modify it anyway you want to accomodate ingrediants that you may have on hand. I used pumpkin instead of sweet potato, the spanish chiorzo sausage, and also added some ocra. You just can't go wrong.

At the advice of a butcher, I used Cajun sausage instead (chopped small and less than called for). Very rich, but a perfect use of sweet potato. This will be a perfect recipe to inexpensively fill up guests and family during the holiday season. Very tasty and full of vitamins. I added red bell peppers, extra garlic, onions, and a few carrots for added vitamins. Very easy to make. Use good quality sausage, and you can get by with half the oil and no additional seasonings.

This was a great soup. I was able to find the linguica which was a really interesting flavor. Not the slightest bit spicy, unlike chorizo. The substitutions I made were minor (leeks instead of onions, 4 c stock + 2 c water instead of 6 c stock, red skinned potatoes instead of white), and just a matter of what I had on hand. I did add about a cup of soaked navy beans with the broth for a little extra protein, and I did not add the spinach to the soup. Instead I put the spinach in the bowl and ladled the hot soup over it. This will prevent the spinach from getting slimy when I reheat the soup for lunch tomorrow. I did have to add salt at the end, but that may have been due to the beans. Overall a great recipe and one I will definitely make again.

cosbyl is partially correct - Spanish chorizo may be dry like salami if you get the wholly cured type (curado), or it also comes semi-cured and in need of cooking (crudo). Semi-cured would likely be best for this recipe.

I had to use a chicken jalapeno sausage from Trader Joe's so I added some paprika to the meat while it was sauteeting. I also subbed in chard and kale for the spinach, and added some fresh oregano and tomatoes at the end. It far exceeded my expectations, which were simply to use some ingredients from my CSA. I will definitely put this into my usual rotation.

To the cook from Woodland Hills--you had Mexican chorizo, which is fresh and therefore crumbly like breakfast sausage. Spanish chorizo is a highly spiced hard dry sausage like a salami. You might like it better with the other kind.

I agree that this recipe was tasty. I was a little disappointed at how greasy the soup was when I first tasted the finished product.I guess it all depends on the quality of the chorizo. I am sure that what I used was not the best, but it was all I could find. However, the next day I skimmed the fat from the top and was pleasantly surprised at how well all of the flavors came together after the soup rested. Please resist the urge to add spices (like I did) before you taste it the next day. I found that the spices I added weren't needed at all, in fact they detracted. Resist the urge!!!
