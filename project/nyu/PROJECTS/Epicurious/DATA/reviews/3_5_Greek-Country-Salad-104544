This salad is OK, but I didn't love it. Maybe it's great if you live out in the Greek countryside or somewhere where everything is extremely fresh, but some of the flavors are quite strong (maybe the plants are too mature?) and there's a general lack of blending. I liked it okay, but honestly, I probably won't make it again. My husband liked it better than I did.

Knock-out combination of bright, fresh, flavors. And packed with nutrients! The key to Greek longevity?

I took this salad to a dinner party last night and it was a great success. Even the men went back for seconds until it was gone. The fresh dill, flat parsley and scallions gave the salad a wonderful fresh and interesting taste. I topped the salad with shavings of fresh parmesan cheese and dried cranberries to enhance the presentation. I know I will make this salad often.

I made this recipe twice this week. It is light and delicious. I had a full bag of mesclun and spinach so I just used what I had.

I was looking for a good lemon juice salad dressing, and this one is perfect, even on a simpler mix of greens. I only looked for about half of the greens and herbs, and relied mostly on an organic mesclun mix, but it is delicious

I loved this salad, and my guests raved. Good thing, too, because if you buy these greens in the sizes normally available in the grocery store, you'll be making it a few nights in a row.

I love this salad. Have made several times and not been disappointed. I especially like the adding of fresh dill and scallions to the salad.

I made this for Easter with lamb and Greek potatoes. It was a hit. The family was expecting the traditional feta/cucumber/ tomato/olive salad but thought this was wonderful. I made it again the nesxt day to have with grilled salmon. If you can find the ingredients, it's such a simple, delicious salad. I had a hard time finding dandelion greens and mustard greens so I just used mesclun mix with the escarole and watercress. I'll be making this often.

We served this as a salate course between a flatbread with dipping sauses and a chicken dinner. Tasted wonderful... many compliments on the dressing. This recipe is definately a keeper!

Very nice. Used 1/4 c oil and it was plenty. Best to use kosher salt when seasoning before serving so that the salad does not wilt.

Good for you Epicurius. For keeping the old traditions of my Yaya and Papo alive I say Bravo! I have vidid memories of them wandering in the back yard pulling weeds to est. We thought them nuts and so it goes. Like marrage, it's the act of searching for the greens that is important, not just the act of enjoying a country salad together.

Delicious, Fab. The dressing and all. Since I'm only ten I like to experiment, so I tryed putting it into a pita making a wrap. I subsituted the dressin for bleu cheese; even better.
