Just harvested my first Bok Choy from the garden and looked up this recipe. Did not have tofu or Mizuna, but did have the rest of the ingredients. Really quick to make, incredible taste. Will definately make again!

delicious! however, i took so many liberties with the ingredients that it might qualify as another recipe. first of all, i couldn't find bok choy or mizuna at the market. my ingredients were green beans, kale, mushrooms, bell pepper and green chilis. also, i added more soy while cooking. served over brown rice.....it was yummy!

I am not a big fan of this recipe, i dont think its that appealing. love all the ingredients, but maybe cooked differently.

I made this exactly as posted and it was the most awful excuse of a tofu recipe I have ever wasted ingredients on. We use tofu all the time by the way, and I am accomplished cook. The individual ingredients appealed to us; the final dish was inedible.

Excellent! I made it without the mizuna because I couldn't find it.

Loved this recipe as a base. I haven't cooked tofu many times, so I followed the directions to cut and dry the 14 oz. of firm tofu. I then marinated it in the soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil sauce. Wish I had cooked the tofu first, then marinated. I used seasoned rice vinegar which was all I had and the recipe admonished against it. I agree. Too vinegary and left the tofu with that being the dominate taste. Since my husband and I make stir fries 2-3x a month, I like to have a greater variety of veggies than this recipe called for. Also, we like spicy food. My seasoning recipe included: 2TBSP minced fresh ginger (1/2 of which I put on the marinating tofu), 2 minced serrano chiles, 1 TBSP red pepper flakes, 1 TBSP minced garlic (1/2 also on the marinating tofu), low sodium soy sauce as desired, sesame oil per recipe and a little Thai sweet chili dipping sauce on my finished dish. The stir fry: sesame oil, soy sauce, the above spices, 1 c. bean sprouts, 1/2 c. broccoli florets, 1/2 c. sliced carrots, 1 c. cole slaw cabbage mix, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 bag (3oz)baby spinach, 1/2 c. sliced scallions, 1/4 c. unsalted peanuts and tofu served over 1 c.Texmati rice that was cooked in my rice cooker w/Swanson's low sodium/fat chicken broth. Husband said it was the best stir fry to date. He did the actual stir frying and starts with the seasonings, then the longer cooking veggies and finally the tofu so it's reheated. Easy peasie, beautiful and yummy. I would add the whole bag of spinach (or swiss chard, bok choy, as alternatives.) We ate all of the stir fry (not all of the rice), so one may want to double the veggies if serving more than two people.

Easy enough to make except the tofu took 20-25 minutes to brown. Family said that the tofu still tasted like gypsum board. I think the tofu would have more flavor if it either was marinated in the sauce, cooked in the sauce, or if some garlic and ginger were added to the peanut oil before adding the tofu. Couldn't find mizuna, used mustard greens, which turned out fine. All in all, an OK dish for adventurous eaters on a meatless Monday.

Easy to do on a weeknight- I used whatever vegetables I had but otherwise followed the directions. Found it far too salty- will use low sodium products next time. Also will cut down on oil. Otherwise a great base recipe.

My non-vegetarian child asks for me to make this recipe over and over again. The only change I make is to shake the tofu in a bag of cornstarch before cooking. It gets a lovely crust and soaks up the marinade. Yum!!!

I added celery, carrots, etc. because I wanted to empty my fridge a bit, and it was great. I just added the veggies between the onions and bok choy and added some extra soy and vinegar. Substituted arugula for mizuna. Also cut tofu into bite-size pieces. Served over rice. Good one!

Easy, quick and tasty. My family enjoyed this very much. I drained the tofu for over an hour and fried it on all sides which allowed the tofu to keep it's shape. The remainder of the dish was cooked in a wok. I substituted spinach and rocket for mizuna.

Outstanding! One of the best ways to cook bok choy I've found.

This dish is my new favorite! It is so delicious and I don't think it needs any hot sauce at all. The ginger, garlic and sesame add a lot of flavor. I've made it with different greens including kale and cabbage and it turns out great.

This is simple and very tasty, not to mention budget-conscious. I found the mizuna, which I was not familiar with, at the local farmers mkt. I up the sesame flavor by adding in toasted sesame seeds. I eat it as is, but to make it heartier you could serve it over rice.

Added jicama for a bit of different texture. Cut the tofu much smaller, per review suggestion, for more crispy/flavorful sides. Loved the result. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty and easy. I substituted arugula for the mizuna, and regular bok choy instead of baby bok choy. Following other reviews, I added some sriracha at the end, which made it even tastier. Next time I'm going to serve with brown rice.

Nice stirfry. Frying the tofu then marinating it makes it soooo yummy. Unfortunately, I didn't have the ginger, but it was still good. I could only find baby Mizuna and that worked fine. Since I can't cook a recipe without my own touch, I added some fresh shitake mushrooms de- stemmed, sliced thickly and stir fried with the garlic and a bit of soy sauce before the adding the remaining ingredients.

As other reviewers said, this recipe needed a little kick. I ended up adding sriracha just on the tofu for a little more spice. I found this recipe tasty, but will probably alter the tofu a bit next time by cutting it smaller and cooking it on multiple sides (not just the bottom) for a little more crunch. BTW, cooking this recipe made the whole house smell fantastic.

This was surprisingly tasty for something with so few ingredients. I have never cooked mizuna before, but I found the texture and taste of the cooked mizuna to be quite pleasing. I did make some modifications though: relative the amount of greens, I halved the amount of oils and doubled everything else. I also used low sodium soy sauce.

Tofu was deliciously crunchly and the veggies (I used choy sum) were great. Only drawback for me was that it all a bit salty and needed a bit more of a kick. Next time I will substitute some of the soy sauce for some oyster sauce. We had it with the ginger-scented rice (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ Ginger-Scented-Rice-352049) which was to die for.

Delicious and easy. Even better with a little hot sauce.
