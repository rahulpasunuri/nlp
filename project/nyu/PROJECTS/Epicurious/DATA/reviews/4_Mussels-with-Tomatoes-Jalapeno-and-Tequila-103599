I was a bit suspicious of this recipe but the reviews were so good I gave it a try. It was fantastic.

Excellent. Hubby was just begging me to make this again the other day. Don't forget slices of bread to sop up the juices.

Just ok for me. Just tasted buttery and spicy. By adding the tequila during the simmering process, it all cooked off so you don't get much tequila flavor. If I made it again I would add it at the end.

it seems like the recipe doesn't make sense but it was AMAZING. my friend said she'd rather come over to eat these than pay 4x at the restaurant she fell in love with mussels at. added some fresh cilantro on top for a little extra flare. goes well with Mexican beer as well. found mussels for $4 for 2 lbs. CHEAP and EASY.

If I could eat this every day I would. YUM! Didn't change a thing.

I love this dish! I'm looking forward to making it as an appy for a dinner party Friday. Any ideas for an entree? It's so good on its own, but the perfect "sit around and gab" starter. The only thing I leave out is the celery because I'm not crazy about it. But it's a keeper for sure. I just wish I could think of the perfect main. Something tropical, but not too heavy...

Fabulous! We are great mussel fans and have tried many variations--this is without equal. Really really terrific--can't wait to have this again.

I have made this recipe at least half a dozen times. Its always perfect! I do add a bit more jalapeno than the recipe calls for because this family likes a lot of heat. I do tone the jalapeno down when my 4 children eat it. I would not change a thing. Every time I have served it, my guests are using a spoon to finish off the broth!! I do think you need the entire stick of butter to maintain the richness of the broth. This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe and expected a wonderful result based on the reviews but nope... this was just so-so. There are many better recipes out there. I won't be making this recipe again.

Of all the recipes I've made on here, this had, by far, the biggest bang for the buck. My girlfriend thought it was better than the mussels we'd have at two of the finest seafood restaurants in the Los Angeles area (one in Malibu, one in Beverly Hills), and I can't say I disagree. The clincher was when we'd spoon as much as we could on to a half-shell, then shoot it. It was amazingly good. It's reasonably cheap comparitively, takes almost no time to make, and tastes absolutely amazing. I'm not a great chef, so I was a little worried following the instructions, but they worked to a tee. I'd highly recommend this recipe to anyone, but especially to any beginning chef, like me, including any who are new to steaming and shellfish.

Ok, so I'm planning to make this dish and buy the mussels. But, when I go to do it the recipe screens are down. Typically, I didn't save it, just counted on being able to access the online recipe at any time, so I have to do it from memory. Changed lots: about 2tbl butter plus 2 tbl extra virgin. Sweated a yellow onion in the butter/oil. added chipotle powder (Penzys, love that stuff), say 1 tsp, and 3 finely chopped garlic cloves, a sliced jalapeno and a diced yellow sweet pepper to simmer a bit. Added 1/2 cup tequila (ok, so I remember things my way). Bring to boil. Add the mussels (1.5 lbs) and cover, cooking until they all open. About a minute or two before I'm ready to stop the show, I added about a cup of chopped tomato and a half bunch or so of chopped cilantro. Huge hit with a crusty loaf. Highly recommended.

This is a great quick and delicious recipe. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the volume of butter could easily be reduced, perhaps in favor of more tomatoes and/or vegetable stock. The crisp celery really added a nice texture to the recipe. I think next time I might even consider doubling the amount of celery added. Overall it was quite delicious and I would definitely make it again.

This recipe is very good. I am addicted to it. Had it twice this week. Cannot stress the importance of having bread as transortation for this delicous broth!

this is so easy to make and tastes so delicious. i added a good handful of cilantro on top before serving; and made some freshly toasted garlic french bread to soak up the goodies. yum!

wow, this was incredible. my husband about scraped the glaze off the bottom of his bowl trying to get the last drops. i served this with crusty french bread and a big green salad. was perfect. i cut down on the butter, didn't miss it. used 3 jalepenos, not too hot, just right. next time i might take the suggestion below of adding the tomatoes at the last minute for more freshness.

I made these as an appetizer, served with warm focaccia bread, and my guests did not want to move on to dinner! I used two fresh jalapenos and they were perfect. I'm making them again this week for my family.

While putting this all together I thought what a disaster of a recipe.......but, the final result was WOW, how did this turn out to taste so great. Added little neck clams w/ the mussels as well.

This recipe was to die for!!! Loved it. I only used 2 jalapenos because I was afraid the recipe would have been too hot. Could have actually used more. But it came out great anyway. Will definetly make it again.

Made for Christmas dinner and everyone (kids included) loved it. Not as spicy as it looks.

Made this again, but removed mussels after cooking and tented them. Then added cream to remaining sauce, simmered a few more minutes, and then served with ladle alongside mussel bowls. Worked very well, and the cream softened the bite, as I chose not to seed the jalapenos.

This is a great recipe. My husband and my 18 month old loved it. I thought it was good and I don't care for shellfish that much. I will certainly be making this again.

This recipe is incredible! Have made is 3-4 times and enjoy it the same each time. Guests have raved and asked for receipe. I will try with clams as sauce is what I think really makes recipe.

Yum! The presentation is beautiful, the flavors wonderful....go for it. We served it with a nice salad as a entree...would be great as an appetizer IF you limit the amount of the necessary soaking bread that you gave each guest! Make it with green lip mussels on the half shell....YUM

This appetizer was made for our dinner group. It was a big hit. This recipe would be great as a dinner with the sauce over linguine or other pasta. All agreed sauce was too good to let sit at the bottom of the bowl. This one is a keeper!

Outstanding! Have made it 4 times in the last month, and it only gets better. Left out the celery (didn't have any), and we like it so well, I hate to tamper with success.

I had this at the neighbours the other night and it was great. I agree about adding the tomatoes and green onions at the end. Yummy ... have lots of bread on hand, the sauce is delicious. The amount of heat is just right for those who don't like too-spicy food. I personally would add more next time.

I made this when it first came out in Bon Appetit and I am about to make it again tonight! This is by far THE BEST mussel recipe I have ever made. i made it originally for about 10-15 people and they all wanted the recipe! It got rave reviews and it's very easy! Will be making this one forever!

This mussell recipe was fantastic. Everyone at the dinner party said it was the best mussells they had ever had. Everone left with a copy of the recipe

Very very good. The only change I made was to cut back on the butter-- I used 2 Tbsp. plus 2 Tbsp. olive oil.

This is the best mussel recipe in the world - we have made this over 20 times and everyone loves this and crusty french bread tops it off perfectly

I am rating on behalf of my boyfriend who was practically in ectasy as he ate this dish. I am a vegetarian but like preparing mussels for him because they are so easy and I don't have to touch them (I ask my fish guy to debeard them for me). He is not a big fan of creamy sauces so this is a nice break from that and tasted really light and refreshing to him. He ate almost an entire loaf of bread sopping up the juice. If you have a mussel lover in the family, make this recipe.

I have not tried this recipe yet,but i know from reading it i would like it 7 keep it in my recipe box

Would like flavors to have tasted fresher - tomatoes and scallions became mushy. Sauce cooked this long with this much butter lacked the freshness I associate with southwestern cuisine. Feel that you should reduce amount of butter, eliminate celery, finely chop vegetables as in salsa, and fold into mussels and liquids at the very end- finish with a little chopped cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.

I made several changes. I used red onions in stead of the green (because that is what I had) I used a banana pepper instead of the jalepenos. and I added 1/4 c of white wine. It is a definite do again in our house.

This was such a simple recipe and luckily I had tequila on hand to finish the ingredients list. My boyfriend and roommate were in heaven while eating this. I added some grilled french bread with some garlic butter to dip the remaining sauce. This was a big hit & I'm making it again tomorrow night.

Made this as an appetizer, had rave reviews and was flattered when a world-class chef at the dinner asked for the recipe. I will be making this again to-morrow as an apetizer, since I've run out of tequila (hard to get the good stuff in BC) I'm substituting vodka - should still work ok as dish is so flavourful with rest of ingredients. I expect to use this one a lot.

We've made this several times. It is awesome!When you put the tequila in, take the time to enjoy the aroma. The flavors all go together wonderfully. Serve with Margaritas.

This recipe rocks! If you are sick of mussels in a cream sauce or mussels in a tomato sauce you will find this a welcome change. I used it as a light first course and got rave reviews. I would watch the heat from the peppers. I seeded half of the Jalapenos and found it to be almost too hot.

We were at a Labor Day party and the mussels came out after all the other appetizers were eaten. No one was particulary hungry at the time, but the aroma from this dish was to much to resist. The plate was empty in a matter of minutes.

This was excellent and easy. I used unsalted butter and added salt and pepper to taste as I went along. My 1 1/4 lbs. mussels yielded 24, NOT 40, as suggested. I'd go by weight, however, rather than number of mussels. This served 2, with a side salad and lots of bread for dunking in the delicious broth. Add hot sauce or red pepper flakes near the end if more heat is wanted.
