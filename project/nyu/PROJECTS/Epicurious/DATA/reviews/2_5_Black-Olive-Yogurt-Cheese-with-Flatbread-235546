Don't bother making the yogurt cheese unless you're curious aboutt he process, but the stuff at Trader Joe's is terrible by Middle Eastern standards. Go to a Middle Eastern Market (if one is available) and get the real thing, called Lebneh or labneh. It's MUCH better! It's also good with zaatar, a spice mix and olive oil.

First of all, this is not a recipe. Do you have a Trader Joe's or a Dorothy Lane Market in your area? If so, buy the Greek-Style Yogurt from there (Even the 2% works!) so you don't have to mess with cheesecloth & waiting overnight. This can all be done at the last minute. Trader Joe's also sells really great flatbread in 3 flavors! I was disappointed because I was expecting a flatbread recipe.
