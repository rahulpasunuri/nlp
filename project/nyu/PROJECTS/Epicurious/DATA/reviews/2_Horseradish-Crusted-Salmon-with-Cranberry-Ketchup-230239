chopped sugared cranberries would be a compliment. the ketchup had absolutely no consistency or flavor, except that it actually tasted bad! the sweetness and tartness were way off, and this sauce would never be something i would dip anything into.

Love the Cranberry ketchup! Made just the ketchup to serve with a grilled turkey. Good combnation of flavors...will do it again but without the egg/flour routine, that seemed unnecessary.
