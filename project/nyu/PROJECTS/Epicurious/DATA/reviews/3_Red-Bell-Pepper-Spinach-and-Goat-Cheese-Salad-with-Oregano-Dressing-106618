I tried this out as just a solo salad for a light weeknight meal. I basically eyed the veggies and then halved the amounts for the dressing, it worked out well. I omitted the celery and added some pecans for a crunch factor. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added a little mustard and honey to the dressing (great suggestion!) It really added to the flavor. I would definitely make this again.

This is so fresh and healthy. The goat cheese nicely coats the spinach. It is something my husband loves and he barely eats salad. It helps me tolerate my January diet and not feel like I am suffering.

This salad was a nice change of pace from our usual iceberg lettuce and leftover veggies. The dressing was good, but could have used a little vinegar. I also added a little honey to it to balance it out, as well as some mustard, and that seemed to work very well.

It was good, but not great. There are alot more delicious salads to make. However, it went well with the steak and potatoes I cooked that nite.

We really liked the full flavor of this very simple salad. A nice accompanyment to the panfried chicken breast with garlic-oregano butter.

I make this salad a lot. The recipe makes plenty for 6-8 people, though. I usually use 1 bell pepper and about 1 cup of celery. I toss that and the onion in the bowl with the oregano dressing and most of the goat cheese, so the goat cheese ends up blending in with the dressing. Then I add enough spinach leaves to fill the bowl and toss (I don't chop the spinach if I have baby leaves). At the end I sprinkle on some more crumbled goat cheese. Very refreshing flavors.

Added toasted pine nuts (because I had them) and used a goat cheese with chives. Also added just a touch of Dijon to the dressing. Very good weeknight salad.

I found this salad just ok. I had to adjust the proportions of oil and lemon juice (3T oil to 2T lemon juice) and I added some sunflower seeds which gave good texture and nutty flavor. The onion was too much for me. So, in fact, I think I WOULD make this again but with several changes.

I make this salad FREQUENTLY - sometimes I will use feta cheese instead of the goat when I know that my guests don't care for goat cheese. I've even made the salad and used prepared dressing when I haven't planned ahead and don't have fresh oregano. Best with the oregano dressing though!

I love any sort of spinach salad. I took note from previous reviewers and substituted very thinly sliced and diced fennel (Anise) for the celery. It was great!

Very disappointed after the raves! As evidenced by the LARGE amount of leftovers, the 8 of us agreed it was nothing special-the goat cheese was the saving grace.

I used arugala instead of spinach in this recipe and the peppery flavor combined well with the dressing. Also, I roasted cherry tomatos, which were tossed w/olive oil, salt and pepper, for 15 minutes at 400 degrees, then added them to the salad. Loved the dressing, but maybe next time reduce the oil.

Served it as a second course recently at a dinner party and everyone loved it. The flavors were wonderful and the dressing was perfect. Had all my ingredients prepared ahead of time and stored in individual zip-locks so it took no time to put them together.

A nice, light, colorful salad. Good as an addition to a heavier meal that needs a salad. I actualy served it with Penne with Chicken, Shiitake Mushrooms, and Capers (from this website) but the flavors weren't very complimentary. I'm not sure I like the celery or maybe just not as much.

Great salad for when my husband comes home from work really late and needs just a light and nutritious meal.

This was great! I improvised a little on this recipe. I added raisins and diced chicken breast. Also, I doubled the dressing, and added some minced garlic. It was so delicious!!! Next time I think I will add chick peas as well. I will definitely make this again, my hubby was a member of the "clean plate club"!

This is a great, simple salad! Spinach is not my favorite green so we used spring mix instead, very successfully. Arugual might be delicious too. The fresh oregano and goat cheese make this something special--we'll have it often.

I made this for friends and I would not change a thing.
