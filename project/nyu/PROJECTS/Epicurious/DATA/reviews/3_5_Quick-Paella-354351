Oh, forgot to add: Started with a medium onion and a clove of garlic, sauteed in olive oil, along with the suasage.

This is a staple in our house. The children don't like spicy, so we make the main dish with a mild sausage and fry a little chorizo on the side for the adults (fry in a good bit of olive oil and then drizze the oil over the adult portions). Other changes: we roast our own peppers in the oven and add them at the last minute (cut in half, put on a baking dish or on aluminum foil, drizzle in olive oil, bake at 200 C until browned on top and soft). We omit the artichoke hearts (sigh, again, children) Sometime we do it without the shrimp. We also use regular risotto rice and add saffron threads. It is also a great vegetarian dish if you substitute a smoky marinated tofu for the sausage and shrimp.

SOLID BASE RECIPE. I used Linguica, added chopped fresh onions, garlic, & ginger for punch. Next time I'll add saffron and Pernod. I made 1 C fish stock by boiling shrimp shells in 1 C water. Only had brown rice. I sauteed rice with sausage, onion, garlic ,ginger, green peppers. Not much flavor besides the saussage, :-(.©

Very solid dish. Easy to make and brings out bold flavors. I used the two cups of white wine, and was quite pleased, but will probably sub one of those cups for a fish stock in the future. I looked for mussels, but my grocer had none. Also, the little neck clams they had were all dead. I will make this dish time and time again. I was enjoyed by my family of four with leftovers for the next day.

Particularly for the ease of preparation, this one's a keeper. I used chicken broth; fish broth might be interesting next time. I cooked the shrimp shell-on which probably helped boost the fish flavor in the mix. Not sure what kind of wine might have been called for here, sauv blanc? Also, Asparagus (cut to ~1-1.5" pieces) were a great and easy sub for plain ol' frozen peas.

This is an incredibly easy and good recipe. The Vigo yellow rice package is now only 10 ounces, but I ended up using about 2 3/4 cups of liquid(I used white wine, water, and Knorr shrimp bouillon) and I used the full amount of the other ingredients. This makes enough to serve 5 or even 6 adults. It will definitely become part of the rotation, in winter as well as summer!

Good base, but made some adjustments. As suggested by earlier reviewers, added onion, garlic, and some diced tomatoes. Used a 10 oz package of vigo saffron rice (which meant cutting down the liquids to total 2.5 cups). Used a package of chicken chorizo to lower the fat, canned artichoke hearts, and used a pound of shrimp.

This recipe is quick, easy, and hits the spot in any season. My boyfriend begs me to make it regularly. I often omit the shrimp since they are relatively expensive and the rest of the ingredients can be kept on hand in the pantry or freezer.

We used already-cooked chorizo (from the fridge section of the store) and as a result burned it a bit. If you do the same, reduce cook time to about 13 minutes. Also would advise leaving the shrimp in the mixture for a bit longer than you'd think. Overall enjoyed this a good deal (about an hour and a half ago).

Past reviewers have been too generous. Make no mistakes: this dish is utterly tasteless. I would not compare this to paella. Not only that, but the recommendation that this makes "4 servings" is thoroughly preposterous. It will not fit in your "large skillet." We should be reviewing the recipe at hand, not reviewing the recipe after adding so many extra spices and ingredients that it is no longer the same recipe we began with.

This was a great recipe and easy to make. I substituted turkey sausage instead of the Chorizo but did everything else as the recipe called for. My husband raved about it and said it would be great to serve to guests.

I'm one of those cooks who takes a recipe and improvises with whatever I have on hand. I made this by sauteeing Andouille chicken sausage, frozen fire-roasted peppers + onions and garlic. When they were browning, I added one Tbs of artichoke pesto (no other artichokes handy). Then I added arborio rice, saffron, a bit of smoked paprika and stirred it for a few minutes. When the rice turned translucent, I poured in a mix of white wine, chicken broth and water. Threw in a handful of frozen shrimp & peas at the end, along with a squeeze of lemon juice. It was so, so good! And so easy! Dinner was done in 30 minutes and full of complex and robust flavors ... (the smoked paprika really added a lot). It came together with pantry and freezer staples, and I'm amazed by this super-easy, super-delicious recipe.

we thought this quick paella was delicious and really easy. Like other readers - we added onion, garlic and a few diced tomatoes. Makes enough for eight people.

This was pretty good, but not great.I cooked this according to the recipe. However, I felt it was lacking something...some flavor or spice. Also, it was a bit soupy, so I cooked it down some more, but it came out rather mushy.

This was a quick and delicious recipe. I added 1/2 cup sliced onion and minced garlic per other reviewers suggestions and it turned out great.

I made this dish after work one wednesday night and it is very quick and easy! I couldn't find chorizo sausage in the store so I substituted in hot spicy sausage which made it a real treat as I love spicy food. I also wanted to keep budget down so I bought precooked fresh shrimp from the deli which I just mixed in at the end. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Fantastic and easy. Thanks for prior reviews, I adjusted based on your comments and our personal taste. My tips, get sausage nice and crispy, double the artichoke hearts and peppers(roast fresh ones) if you like veggies. Used half low sodium chicken broth and half white wine to lower salt. Used medium shrimp, even small would work. 1 1/2 tsp cayenne for a great spice. For those who said soupy, cook it down, and leave the lid on, my liquid was gone in 15 minutes on gas stove, tossed in a little white wine and added the shrimp and peas. Portions are generous. Will make many more times.

This was the 1st time I made Paella. It was delicious but really too salty. I will make it again but I think next time I will use mild italian sausage instead of chorizo, use 1 cup chicken broth and 3 cups water to cut down on the salt. When I made it I made a few changes. I added 1 browned vidalia onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, omitted the artichokes because I don't care for them and roasted 2 red peppers in the oven instead of using canned. I also added 1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, I love the spice! :-)

This was very good, and I wasn't expecting much. I wanted to try the recipe as written, without changing or adding too many ingredients. I used chorizo from Fall River, MA (large Portuguese community there) roasted my own red bell pepper, had to use canned artichokes, frozen were not to be found, and added a little chicken breast because I had it in the fridge. Excellent, quick paella. Almost as good as the real thing.

Great recipe! Like so many others here, I substitutes here and there with what I had on hand -- used chicken and some asparagus -- and andouille sausage. Oh, and definitely cut it in half unless you're feeding an army.

Made this dish with spicy beef sausage and minus the artichoke hearts. Was so tasty! I did most of the cooking in a stock pot because I don't have a large enough skillet. Came out great! Definitely makes more than 4 servings, probably more like 6-8. Enjoy!

I looked at the comments and I added 1/2 of a chopped onion and 2 chopped garlic cloves. I used andouille sausages for my chorizo choice. This recipe was pretty quick and easy and it was quite the hit. Definitely for more than 4 people though.

Hate to say it, but this was a big disappointment. Followed the recipe exactly and it was stodgy and not all that good-flavored. Part of that may have been the chorizo, which was the only brand int he supermarket. We actually threw out the leftovers, which we rarely do around here.

This was so quick and easy. We used a packaged paella starter box of rice and turkey andouille sausage with a Malbec to drink and there wasn't a leftover in sight.

I was blown away with this recipe. I have never made such an easy and delicious version of Paella. I made the recipe as written and only added a chopped shallot and garlic to the chorizo. A definite keeper in my home. My husband loved it, which is good, since I have lots of leftovers.

I made the mistake is misreading the recipe and cooking the rice before adding it to the mix... Came out rather soupy. Don't cook the rice first!

It was okay -- just a little bland. I used plain rice + saffron vs saffron rice, and low sodium chicken broth vs wine/broth. Maybe it needs anduille instead? Maybe some garlic? needs something in addition to how it is written, just haven't figured out what yet.

I added onions and garlic and served with lemons. Very easy to make, and delicious!

I used chicken breasts instead of shrimp (husband is allergic), cut into bite-sized pieces and quickly browned; andouille sausage, everything else as recipe instructs. Although it was good, and very filling (could serve at least 6 hungry people), it was not particularly flavorful, except for the sausage (which was very good) and I don't like to use rice mixes that are so heavy on the salt. It might be a good starting point, but I likely would only make it again with some experimenting with fresh onions, garlic, peppers, and more seasoning, less salt.

My husband loved this and so did I. It was fast and easy, a good break from grilling during a hot Texas summer. I made it almost exactly as written, except I used fresh red peppers, andouille sausage and frozen artichoke hearts. Also had to add extra water to keep it from drying out. Next time I may add just a few threads of saffron. This is a winner!!

OK....Yum. This was very good and very easy. I have made more elaborate Paella's from this site. Backyard Birthday or someting like that. This was so much easier and better. That being said I had a couple of small changes. When I got home from the store I realized my Vigo rice was only 8 oz's, so I cut out the water. Used 1 cup broth and 1 cuo Pinot Grigio. I added a little more liquid when I put in the shrimp. I also added fresh garlic after the sausage step. I didn't use Chorizo but used anduilli. Good stuff.

WONDERFUL! mine ended up a bit more like a risotto than what i consider to be a paella...but nonetheless it was delicious! i couldn't find a package of saffron rice so i used whatever white rice i had in my cupboard and added approx 1/4-1/2 tsp of saffron threads. I didn't use chorizo or linguica. instead i used the spicy italian sausage i already had and just chopped it up into small chunks (abt thumb nail size), casing and all. it took no time to make. probably one of the easiest dishes i've made. although i think it produced more like 7 servings (ie lots and lots of leftovers). next time i will add more peas & artichokes & roasted peppers for sure (but not a lot more). In general increase the ratio of 'treats' to rice.

This recipe is awesome! I made it exactly as written, and it was the best paella I've ever had. Easy enough for any weeknight, but special enough to serve to company. Could easily be modified by adding extra seafood/shellfish, or substituting any fresh seasonal veggies for the peas - green beans, asparagus, garden tomatoes, etc. Yum!

I made this last night for dinner. It came out a little dry but that might be because I cut the recipe in half and didnt adjust the liquid correctly. I will definitely make this again but next time, I might add more seafood such as mussels, clams, or fish. It was pretty good.

This dish was well received by my husband and friend as a quick weeknight dinner. I could not find chorizo, so I used andouille sausage instead, and I used a fresh red bell pepper instead of the canned ones. I also used a 10 oz package of Vigo rice instead of a pound to increase the good stuff:rice ratio. This still was a gracious plent amount for serving 4 people. I would make this again.

I made the recipe almost exactly as written, just added fresh hot peppers, onions, and garlic. It was quick and easy to make but lacked something. I think adding tomatoes might have helped. It was good, especially since it was so quick to make, but just not as flavorful as I had hoped. With some modifications, I might make it again.

This recipe was delicious but next time I make it I am going to use fresh bell peppers and add more spice. Its just not hot enough. I think I will also add chicken.

I think it was too salty. I wanted to taste more of the shrimp, artichoke, etc. I think the problem comes from the use of the packaged saffron rice. I also couldn't find any frozen artichokes so I had to use the ones in a jar. I'm going to make it again with a homemade- version of saffron rice to make for this & keep an eye out for the proper artichokes. If I find a good recipe I'll post it in the comments for this dish. I got some great compliments from all who ate it though!

This is a great recipe. My Spaniard husband loved the dish. The key component was to use Spanish chorizo. We usually get the chorizo at the local Spanish store. By browning the chorizo, the flavor of the chorizo is added throughout the dish. I omitted the peas and used canned artichoke hearts.

I made this two nights ago. It was incredible. I changed a few things though that made it a little easier for myself. I bought all of the ingredients at Whole Foods. Changes: one box of Saffron Jasmined Rice, can of salad cut artichoke hearts, chicken chorizo, chicken broth, 1/2 lb large shrimp, 1/2 lb medium shrimp. I think the large shrimp was unnecessary and added more cost. The medium size was perfect. I didn't use the 2 cups of water it says because I used the boxed rice and that had water in it already. This was the perfect meal for 2-3 people and a little left over. My boyfriend who lived in Spain for 2.5 years told me that this was the best paella he's ever had. (He didn't care for some of the meat they added in Spain.) He enjoyed the taste of the rice, the chicken chorizo and the artichoke hearts and said I shouldn't change a thing. Best dinner so far, thumbs up! I have never made nor eaten paella and I can't wait to make this meal again.
