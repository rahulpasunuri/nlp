This is a basic vinegrette. It's butter instead of oil oil. It was good, but not exciting or tsomething that I'll put in my receipe book to make again.

I made this as the 3rd course for the Snow Day menu and my hubby said it tied for 1st place with the escarole soup. The dressing was so easy and I will certainly make it again...perhaps mixing it with some angel hair pasta and parmesan cheese. Next time I'm going to slice the garlic into a few more pieces so that the butter infuses with more garlic flavor, simple because I love garlic.

Simple but utterly delicious. This is also a fabulous sauce for crab.

Who would believe something so simple could taste so great? I served this to company and they raved about it. Not a morsel was left. I roasted some chopped pecans and added it to the butter mixture. Yum!

I used 2 small heads of Boston lettuce (no Bibb at the store) and halved the recipe for two people. At first glance the recipe sounds strange, but it's surprisingly good -- mellow, with rich nutty and garlicky undertones that don't drown out the delicate leaves. Served it before a steak dinner and it was a hit. The trick, as a previous reviewer said, is to make sure your lettuce is at *room temperature* -- if it's cold, the butter will harden on the leaves upon contact.

There is something sinful about a butter-based salad dressing. This salad surprised everyone, very popular and extremely rich, probably because of the depth of the bibb lettuce moreso than the actual butter as I reduced the amount of butter I used. I served it with an otherwise very light meal, which was important for the success of the salad. I'll make it again for entertaining; leftovers are not great from the fridge the next day.

This has become one of our favorites and have made it several times!!!! Do not use chilled lettuce.

This is a great salad. My mom makes it for me and it has a nice light dressing that compliments a heavy meal. Also great for summer dining.
