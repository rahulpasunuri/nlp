I was looking for a non-Velveeta version of queso and this version was a hit. My only modification was to add a block of cream cheese which prevented it from having that gummy, melted cheese feel and kept it dippable. I also added some chopped tomatillos which gave it a little extra depth and topped it off with a generous dose of Choulula hot sauce which gave it a good kick!

I would like to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt, since I did not use a fondue pot (used double boiler over low heat), but I just can't. Even if I had managed to get the cheese to join the rest of the dish, I do not think the dish would have been a hit. The beer taste was a little overpowering and it was lacking some standard queso ingredients: cumin, cilantro, green peppers. I generally only try the 4 fork rated recipes, but took a gamble on this one and lost.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! I didn't have any pickled jalapenos, but I had a serrano chile that worked just as well. I ended up using a little more beer to compensate for the loss of liquid. Will definitely make this again.

Much easier and much tastier: 1 lb. block of Velveeta (haven't yet found a "real" cheese to substitute), 1 can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and chiles, 1/2 a yellow onion chopped small. Heat, mix, serve.

This is the worst chile con queso recipe I've ever made. I can't believe the other reviews were good! If you are picky about your Tex-Mex (I was raised in Houston) DO NOT make this recipe. The cheese is sharp --- tastes like swiss cheese. The consistency is stringy. It is really bad all around.

this cheese dip was delicious, but did not reheat well at all for me.

My prayers have been answered! I finally found a yummy queso that doesn't require for Velveeta or some disgusting combo (check ut the recipe on this site that calls for CRISCO of all things!) And Mr Perry: if you're still out there thanks for the fondue pot tip...my mom got the laugh of her life when I called to borrow hers. Guess she was glad that someone found some use for it! :)

This was fine, but not incredible. My college-aged son LOVED it, but the rest of us feel that there are better preparations of this type dish.

Yummy! Chile con queso is almost a non existent entity in Australia, but having tasted it on my last trip to Mexico I had to make it! Had to substitute cheeses, as Jarlsberg is NOT cheap here, but Tasty cheese and some Egmont cheese worked a treat. I used the Rotel Extra Hot canned tomatoes with chillis instead of the separate pickled Jalepenos and tomatoes as they also aren't available here -v.very good!

Ditto on the fondue pot. A tip about serving any type of fondue - make sure you GENTLY cook this over LOW heat (this is why using a fondue pot is best). High temperatures will make the cheese seperate. Once it boils, forget about it, its just a huge mess.

No peoblem getting the cheeses to blend using an electric fondue pot. Also we add a tablespoon of lemon juice to help melt the cheeses. 2-3 fresh jalapenos, minced, worked well for us. I would increase the diced tomatos to 3/4 cup or perhaps even a cup. Overall though this was very good.

The cheese never fully incorporated into the dish. There were big lumps of cheese swimming in a very runny queso-like base. I turned up the heat, but this didn't improve things. I had to resort to the Velveeta-type of queso to serve guests.

The only reason I rate this recipe "1" but would make it again is only because you MUST make it (it is a delicious recipe) but you MUST do the following as well: 1) only use about 1/4 of a jar of the pickled jalepenos' NOT a whole jar unless you want to kill your guests 2) Once you have heated the cheese/beer/tomato, etc. mixture, make sure it stays warm or it will separate. And dig in!

This is easy to prepare and it tastes way better than the stuff you'll get at a chain restaurant. Perfect for parties!!!
