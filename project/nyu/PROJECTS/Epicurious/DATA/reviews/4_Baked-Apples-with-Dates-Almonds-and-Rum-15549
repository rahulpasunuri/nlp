This was delicious. I made them for breakfast so I omitted the rum. I also did not have apple juice so I put the cored apple bits in the dish with the butter and a squeeze of lemon juice. Voila! It worked like a charm...I would probably reduce the sugar amount by a couple of TBSPs.

These apples are fabulous! I've made them three times and they always turn out great. If you like your apples creamier you can increase the baking time to 60 minutes. Make sure you experiment with the filling, too. Keep the basics, but throw in your favourite nuts and dried fruit - it always works!

Super simple (hollowing out the apples with a mellon baller was much easier than I had thought!) and really tasty -- boyfriend allergic to wheat and dairy so there's not many desserts he can eat -- this was perfect!

Great Dessert! My family has asked me to make this for them again. I used walnuts and dried cranberries, and also cut the butter amount in half. I think it is a really adaptable recipe for the 'at hand' ingredients.

Excellent baked apple recipe. I used dates, dried cherries and walnuts I had on hand--I think most nuts and fruits would do. I also halved apples--used very large native Baldwins, which had great flavor--which made coring much easier and more room for filling. I loved the combination of just ginger and lemon peel, with no overpowering spices, so you can really taste the apple. Next time I'll double the sauce in the bottom of the pan and perhaps add a little vanilla.

We've been making this for years, and it has never failed. Delicious!

Very very good. Might cut back a bit on the butter next time .... the recipe calls for way more than you need. I cut the apples in half vertically and then scooped out the core bits, which was much easier than trying to stuff a whole apple. Doing that requires a larger pan than 8 x 8, however.

Delicious! I agree with the other's comments that next time I will scoop out more of the apple (I used Rome Beauties) and make some extra filling and use more. The filling is so good! I will also try the Golden Delicious apples, I have a feeling I will prefer them. I was pressed for time so instead of lemon zest I used lemon extract and instead of fresh minced ginger I used ground and the result was still great.

Everyone loved these baked apples. I had no rum so I used brandy. I also added some vanilla to the butter, brandy and apple juice in the baking dish. We liked this recipe so much we are planning to serve it as dessert for a very special Valentine's dinner for our cohousing community.

DELICIOUS!! Once the components are layed out on your cooking surface....A BREEZE to put together...I can't wait to make this again. Next time I think I will make the cavern in the apple larger so as to accommodate more of the delicious filling...I substituted raisins for the dates because I couldn't find dates..the rum taste was an accent and not at all overpowering...A DEFINITE HIT!!

Great recipe. Everyone at dinner wanted another helping. I might make a little more filling for the apples next time.
