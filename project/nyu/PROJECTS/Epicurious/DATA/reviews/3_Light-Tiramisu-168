there are definitely better lite tiramisu recipes. cooking light has a wonderful one. lady fingers are definitely much better than angel food cake. the sweetness of angel food cake takes away from the blend of all the flavors intended for the palate in this dessert. always use espresso, not a substitute. will stick with my staple.

i havent made this recipe, but i have a light tiramisu recipe that has always worked for me. Its in Todd Wilbur's "Top Secret Recipes Lite!" and its a knockoff of the Olive Garden's tiramisu. It uses low fat pound cake instead of ladyfingers, and mixes low fat cream cheese, Dream Whip, and gelatin for the cream. Its not exactly using Gourmet ingredients, but its really GOOD. One change ive made to his recipe: melt the gelatin as you would for a normal recipe, not in the microwave as he suggets, it doesnt work that way.

If you need low calories, go with another dessert, like Jello. And, don't call this recipe "tiramisu" because it's not even close to the real thing. It is not even worth a try.

I guess I have to agree with St. Paul, it's just too different from the real thing. I usually always opt for light, but I think that, in this case, I have to go with the real version. It was worth a try.

Tasty Tiramisu! I substituted dry Sherry for Marsala, and used half cream cheese and half marscapone cheese for authenticity. I also lined the serving dish with Italian Lady Fingers, like the real thing. It was a big hit! I will definitely make this again.

The short of it: If you really like tiramisu, eat a salad for dinner and a chunk of the real thing. This recipe does not do the dessert justice. The long of it: this is a fine dessert recipe, it's just not tiramisu. The cheese taste is very different from the real thing, as is the cake layer. (Marscapone and cream cheese are just two different animals, as are ladyfingers and angel food cake.) The difficulty of the recipe -- double boiling and beating cream cheese for eons -- is not merited by the final result. It's a good try, but even for the low-fat crusaders out there (and I am one of them), skip this one.

I thought this was a great recipe. I didn't line the pan with plastic wrap either. I alternated the cake and marsala mixture and had three layers of cake. I then covered the top layer of cake with cool whip and the chocolate shavings. I definately would make it the day before as it was even better the second day.

It was very easy to make but not flavorful. I probably won't make it again.

Too many alterations to review this recipe, but thanks for the inspiration. I used angel food cake, a custard made with land o lakes fat free half and half (which was very highly recommended by cooks illustrated) beaten into the light cream cheese. I had to throw cold water on my guests to keep them off of it. :-)

Ha Ha!! The jokes on me! When I first read the recipe, I had NO idea what Marsala was....so after reading a few reviews, I figured it was rum. So I speed off: being the impatient person that I am and add 1/4 plus one tbsp on rum!! Then I saw the rum later on and became aware of my error. I decided to keep it a secret and my tiramisu was the best my guest and husband had EVER had!! Ha ha...the more rum the better!!

Wonderful! I don't know why anyone would prepare a full-fat tiramisu after tasting this. Personally, I would have preferred three layers of cake (you might as well, since you're likely to have scraps left over) but that might just be my taste.

This is a great recipe. I have made it light and heavy (with real sour cream and cream cheese). I have also made it substituting rum for the Marsala wine. In all variations all of my guests have loved it! My personal favorite is heavy with rum. I agree with another reviewer in not understanding why you should line the pan with plastic wrap. I suggest that you cook the angel food cake in the same or similar sized pan as you will use for the tiramisu. Then slice it into three or four layers. Use only two or three for the cake. That way you will not have any trimming to do when you put the tiramisu together. I have also found that I need to heat the egg, sugar, wine (rum) mixture to 170 degrees to get it to thicken sufficiently. One of my family's favorite recipes ever.

Operator Error here. Tried double decker. Would have worked if i had not got carried away and over soaked the cake with coffee solution... too soggy. Bleck. Also thought could get away with heating egg/sugar/liquior mixture in single pot HA! little scrambled egg pieces, but didnt taste it. Learn from my mistakes and this could be wonderful.

This was really tasty, and much easier to make than real tiramisu. I substituted fat-free Cool Whip for the sour cream because I didn't have any sour cream on hand-- tasted just fine. I don't know why you had to line a pan with plastic wrap, I did this, but I don't think it mattered.
