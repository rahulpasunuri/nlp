We made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I made the dough and didn't use boboli and also swapped the mozzerella out for shredded parmesan. Also made sure to use really good quality bacon. this was a big hit and something i'd defintely do again.

Did this last night. My husband totally disliked it!!! I thought it was okay, but won't be making this again. There is more interesting stuff than cabbage you can put on a pizza crust!

This sounds weird, but since I liked all of the ingredients, I tried it, and it was great!!!
