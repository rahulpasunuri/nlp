This was too decadent for the end of a rich holiday meal. I followed lots of reviewer's suggestions, like sprinkling both sides of the towel with sugar, only cool cake for 15 mins, and used half semi-sweet and half bittersweet chocolate. I also put a vanilla glaze on the cake. It was realatively easy to assemble, and I did like the cake, but the chocolate was way too much and heavy. I can't imagine using all bittersweet. Most people took two bites of mine, and ate all of the lemon meringue cake that was served. I also spent a lot of money on good chocolaate to make this, and it just ended up going in the garbage. Next year I would make the cake recipe, but look for a lighter filling and topping. I too forgot to add the cinnamon, but didn't miss it.

This was my first attempt and it was easy to do. I'm willing to try a more challenging recipe in the future because of my experience with this. The video on how to roll a jelly roll cake was what clinched it for me. That was what had always kept me from trying to make a jelly roll cake. I did a chocolate whipped cream filling and added a little orange extract to the frosting. All my friends loved it, the bittersweet chocolate kept the cake from being too sweet. I'll make it again, just to make sure I can.

Mediocre at best, probably good for a novice cook looking for a showpiece or something but nothing special. The recipe iself was fairly easy to follow with good results, it just didn't taste like anything special so I'm going to keep looking for a great buche de noel recipe. Definately use a liquor simple syrup otherwise it is way too dry.

I think it calls for too much bitter sweet chocolate and semi sweet would have been better. It scorched while melting in the cream and next time I will use the microwave to heat it. The cake worked beautifully for me. I moistened the cake with Grand Marnier (that's what I had) and used currant jelly I had just made as a filling (idea from an old recipe I have from France). Had to beat the filling in the electric mixer to get it smooth and a little fluffy. It was easy to finish, to make "bark". I just went out in the yard and got some holly to decorate and did not use the phoney stuff. It looked beautiful on a try and brought a high price at a benefit auction. By the way, waxed paper was fine in lieu of parchment. I used a jelly roll pan. This recipe did not seem as daunting as most so I was not intimidated and went ahead and did it. I am glad I did.

Worked very well the first time, but I slightly altered the cake recipe. Used about 1 cup flour plus 3 TBS cocoa and 1/2 cup ground toasted almonds. Batter was then a bit too stiff, so I added an extra whole egg before folding in egg whites. Cooked perfectly at 10 min. Filled the cake with a butter cream mixed with almond paste. Drizzled the cake well with a simple syrup flavored with almond syrup, which also keeps cake from cracking when you roll it. The basic cake IS dry, but excellent for flavoring with syrups. Topped it with a chocolate icing recipe from FoodTV because I did not have chestnut puree. The final result was wonderful, will make it again next Christmas, maybe with hazelnut flavorings.

This is my second time making this buche de noel, and it definitely was easier the second time around. Do as others suggest and only cool the cake 15 minutes. Also, put confectioner's sugare on both sides of the dish towel so you don't have any sticking. This makes a very striking Christmas dinner dessert!

Disaster! 8-10 minutes was not nearly long enough in the oven. I'm wondering if it was because I used an insulated pan? Perhaps the wrong size as well. Anyway, the cake was ruined as it was still liquid on the bottom when I took it out of the oven (at 11 minutes) and flipped it over. Be VERY careful!!! Taste (of the baked part) was very eggy and spongy, but that should come as no surprise by looking at the ingredients.

This recipe is simply mediocre. Of all the wonderful buche de noel recipes out there, why waste time on this one. The cake is spongy, the filling uninteresting and adding insult to injury, finishing the cake with the same filling... I agree with the other reviewer regarding the author, hew recipes are questionable, a little to aloof and unprofessional.

I'm surfing for Buche de Noel recipes and I must say that even though I haven't made the cake yet, I must disagree with M. Denegar, who says she cannot follow the recipe. I read through it and it is completely clear. The over reviewers give it high marks..sounds like the disgrunted cook is in the minority\...and with some apparent ax to grind!

I was disappointed in the cake recipe. I followed the directions exactly, even baked it a slightly shorter amount, but the cake came out very spongy. The flavor was good, but most of my guests ate the frosting and filling and left the cake behind. I won't make it again.

The recipe was not difficult to make but the directions were less than clear. I had to cross-reference this recipe with a few others to understand fully the authors' intentions. I have had several disappointments using this food writers' recipes in the past, and, had I first looked to see whose recipe this was, I wouldn't have bothered! I do not recommend this recipe to anyone interested in a satisfying result!!

I made this for the first time in 1998. It is now a Christmas Eve family tradition. I find it easy to make and very impressive (I decorate with fresh holly leaves and berries) I forgot the cinnamon this year (the recipe doesn't say when to add it) and it was still good.

For my 9th grade English project I had to make some French recipes. Everyone loved this cake and I got extra credit and was on closed circuit tv.

While the flavors in this cake were good, I don't think this recipe is good for a novice baker. The cake was underdone and two of us had to try to get it back into the pan and cook it for another 8+minutes. (my oven is usually on the hot side, I cook most recipes only to the shortest time). I was also unclear on which part was the filling and which was the frosting and switched them. Maybe if I hadn't the cake would have been moister. It turned out pretty and most folks liked it, but I didn't think it was worth all the time involved.

This is really, really good. It takes a while (1hr+), but it got RAVE reviews at christmas eve. Use MOST (not all) of the filling on the cake; and don't worry, the chestnut frosting you make is enough for the whole thing. I let the cake cool for 20mins out of the oven, and the inside swirl cracked just a little let it rest for 15 and you'll be fine. Also, try semisweet for the filling, it might help, but it was great anyways. highly reccomended!!
