Delicious and easy. I took it to a 4th of July party and it was a big hit. Would also be great to use, still warm, as a topping for pancakes, french toast, pound cake, etc.

Excellent sorbet. I made this in my ice cream maker for the freezing portion of the recipe. There were no left overs and my friends raved about how good it was. When sorbet is this fresh and easy to make, why would you ever buy it! Other than cost that is! Will definitely make this again!

Relatively easy to make, I used mixed berries instead of blackerries alone. It did take closer to 2 hours to freeze but otherwise, no complaints. The apple and berries go together nicely. Very good and would definitely make again.

Too Good. everyone just loved this recipe. I will make this all summer long and everyone will be very happy. I do use my ice cream machine for this. I alway make my own ice cream so i always have the part of the ice cream maker in the freezer for quick reicpes. I know everyone will like this recipe, I have used strawberries and blueberries with this.

Very easy and light. Perfect for summer. Raspberries work well too.
