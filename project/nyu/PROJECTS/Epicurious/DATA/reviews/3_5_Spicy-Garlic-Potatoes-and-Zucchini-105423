i was surprised that so many reviewers omit the zucchini, it was delicious. modified the recipe by slicing the vegetables and followed other reviews by cooking zucchini in pan first

I agree with the general consensus here - this recipe is much better with out the zucchini. This is a great, light way to cook potatoes when they don't need to be a powerful side dish.

My boyfriend and I liked the potatoes a lot, but could do without the zucchini. I sometimes cook zucchini in a similar manner, but I sautee it for a lot longer. We ended up picking out the potatoes, and I;m thinking that I may make the potatoes the same was another time. If I use the zucchini again, I'll slice it thinner and add more garlic and oil to the pan, and sautee it for a lot longer.

This was a great accompaniment to the Grilled Asian Flank Steak with Sweet Slaw on this site. I made it as directed except used olive oil. It was enjoyed by all!

The un-peeled fingerlings were so good. I normally would have used rendered duck fat to sautee but did use olive oil instead. Did not cook zucchini ahead- just threw it in with taters about 5 min before main course done and it was wonderful. Went well with a filet and some corn on the cob on the grill.

I've had nothing but compliments on this dish, and yet it is so simple and easy to make. I use red, white and blue potatoes with the skins on to make this recipe, which makes it colorful and as pleasing to the eye as it is to the palate.

This was delicious! My husband raved about it. I made it for the two of us, so I used 4 red potatoes cut into fourths and 2 zucchinis cut into eight spears each. I added the zucchini to the potatoes while they were cooking for the last three minutes. I also sauteed the veggies together. Very easy!

This was a very good side dish and we will make it again. The portion sizes quoted are large, it could really feed 8 with another green veg on the side. We added a large, chopped shallot to the zucchini oil about 2 minutes before the zucchini. Shallot or onion tastes so good with fried potatoes. Next time, I will add more chili pepper and will add more garlic to the zucchini oil, then remove it like for the potatoes. As another person said, the potatoes used up all the garlic-oil.

This has become one of our favorite potato side dishes. We don't bother with the zucchini, and really enjoy these spicy spuds with beef.

Very good. Only change I made was to steam the potatoes and zucchini rather than boil them.

This was great, even without the zucchini. Olive oil was even better than veg. oil. And you can add some fresh or dried herbs for variety, at the end.

Excellent, especially with the Striped Bass and Sour Cream chive sauce.

I have made this recipes many times because everone in my family loves it. (even my eight year old son) It's a real winner and has become one of my "stand-bys". I sometimes add haricort verdes, baby pattypan squash and/or sauteed artichoke hearts, and cover it with grated Manchego cheese before popping in oven. It's delicious!

This recipe was quite tasty, but I used a different variety of potatoes and had some difficulty. Based on the previous experience, I would make this again but I would leave out the potatoes. Cooking the zucchini immediately after the garlic would surely enhance the flavor...by the time I got around to putting the zucchini in the pan, the garlic-oil was used up. I used half the amount of red pepper flakes suggested, but filled the other half with a a hot blend of powdered red and black peppers.

The combination of the vegetables and the pepper tasted great! I added a little mint and that gave it a nice sweetness. There won't be leftovers.

I'd make this again, but maybe with slightly smaller pieces, more veggies added in (like another type of squash and some orange or yellow pepper) and 20 minutes or so in the oven to crisp up the edges. It was a nice spicy accompaniment to the sweet flavors in Monkfish with Apple-Date Compote (also from epi), but I didn't love it.

This is a repeater! Even my husband who isn't in zucchini and hot stuff...found a liking to this dish and even went back for seconds. I even added more than the recipe called for on the pepper flakes, My suggestion is just keep tasting and adding till you find the amount you like!

We live near a farmer's market and this recipe makes wonderful use of the fresh ingredients. If you go with larger squash, just slice them proportionately. Wonderfully tasty - that much better if you use a high quality salt, like Maldon salt

This recipe should work but for me it didn't. The potatoes had an off taste. Too bad too because the only reason I found this recipe is that the store had the fingerling variety and I was excited to try them. I'll try them again some day. One thing I will say is that I only used 1.5 pounds of spuds and I'm glad I used all the red pepper called for. For those who don't have kids you might want to kick it up a bit.

I couldn't find baby zucchini, so I just cut up bigger than match stick size and then steamed instead of boiled. I should have added the full amount of red pepper flakes, but punked out, it could have used the kick they would have provided.

A very good recipe. Children loved it as well, so it's a keeper.

This goes with the Roasted Striped Bass and Chive Sour Cream sauce. Fantastic!
