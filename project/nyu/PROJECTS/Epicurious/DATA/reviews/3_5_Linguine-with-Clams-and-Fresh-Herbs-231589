This recipe is one of my favorites! Simple, yet very tasty & healthy! It has clams in pasta, a wonderful combination. I makeshift this recipe by using only canned clams and dried herbs, but I have developed several fans of this dish.

This is as good/better as the seafood portofino at Olive Garden. I used 1 lb. of linguine and there was plenty of sauce. Changed recipe to 6 cloves garlic, 1-1/2 lbs. clams, 1 lb. shrimp and I only used parsley. Followed the recipe as directed except as clams opened I immediately removed them to a bowl. Then, I added the shrimp. When they just began to turn pink I returned the clams and simmered for 2 minutes. Added the chopped clams at the end with the cream and linguine. This turned out excellent! Could not believe how good it was!!

simple and delicious recipe... especially for us phoenix folks, who don't have access to fresh clams or fishmongers. we used fresh terragon and i think this is key, using the dried stuff might just be too overpowering. also, instead of heavy cream, we added a little butter and whole milk, and the sauce was clinging to the pasta perfectly. no need for the extra calories.

Solid recipe. Some additions: sautéed shallots along with the garlic (which was upped - love garlic). Added a little dry white wine when the live clams were steaming. I also omitted the canned clams and only added the clam juice, while the live clams were steaming. Added a little lemon juice, red pepper flakes, more parsley, a pat of butter and the rest of the canned clams to finish it off.

Just like Mom makes! But better! I added canned minced clams at the end of cooking for just a bit more protein. Didn't have clam juice but made a shrimp broth with the shrimp shells I save in the freezer for emergencies.

Very easy, very yummy. I followed the suggestion to put the canned clams in at the end although I used their juice at the time directed in the recipe. I had light cream, not whipping cream. Otherwise I followed the recipe and liked everything about it. Loved the herb mix, flavors blended nicely.

I like this recipe for its simplicity. I left out the fresh clams as well, since I had all the other ingredients on hand via the pantry and garden. I think this is a great recipe for when you need a pasta fix, as I occasionally do. I did cut out one tablespoon of olive oil, though, and it didn't seem to be missing anything.

I was very pleased with this recipe after making a few changes. Substituted thyme for the tarragon, added the cream with the clam juice, reduced the sauce after removing the fresh clams, added the canned clams just as sauce is sufficiently thickened (adding them too early toughens them) and stirred in the juice from half a lemon just before adding the pasta. As someone else mentioned, leaving out the fresh clams makes this a pantry-ready recipe that can be prepared in minutes.

I make this dish at least twice a month, It is so easy to prepare and the results are extraordinary. I do not use any canned clams (why ruin it??) and I do not use cream. instead I prepare it the Meditteranean way simply tossing the pasta with good quality olive oil and a pinch of freshly ground sea salt & black pepper. I use very little tarragon and more thyme.

I make this frequently. It is delicious. The fresh herbs add fantastic flavor, especially the tarragon which makes it taste very rich. I omit the fresh clams for ease.

I did not like the cream in this recipe; it was soupy and did not stick to the noodles. Also, I would use more oregno; the tarragon was too strong.

I made a variation of this recipe. I used all fresh clams, no canned, and sauteed garlic with a bunch of chopped scallions in some butter and olive oil before adding the liquid. Only used basil, no other herbs, they just seemed to overpowering in the recipe. I also used 1/2 and 1/2. The whole thing was scrumptious and easy with a salad and Garlic bread. Will make again.

I lost my recipe I usually use and have been looking for a good one ever since. This is better by far. I didn't have sweet basil so used oregano. Mine had lemon and no cream. This is definately a keeper.

Hey, this is MY recipe -- minus the cream and tarragon, and add oregano. The family loves my linguini with clams. I'll try adding cream the next time I make it.

I loved this sauce, thickness and all. Being of gool old German descent, I go for a sauce that clings to the pasta. I made the whole recipe and, to my surprise, ate it all! Do not cook the canned clams though, they will be like rubber

I've been doctoring up a can of Progresso Clam White Clam Sauce for years...everyone loves it! Saute 1 sweet onion chopped; add one Can Progresso White Clam Sauce, one Can Artichoke Hearts (drained & quartered)and ¼ cup dry white wine heat. Optional add ½ lb button mushrooms, washed & quartered. When sauce is heated, add 18-24 fresh srubbed littlenecks.

I am shocked and appalled that epicurious would consider, much less highlight, a recipe calling for canned clams. It's really simple -- go to the fish department and buy two dozen cherrystone clams and have the fishmonger open the clams and save the juice in a container. Chop fresh clams. Now you have fresh clams in juice just like in the can. While we're at it, instead of using clam juice out of a jar. Save the shells the fishmonger just opened. Boil in ten cups water and you now have fresh clam juice to use for your sauce.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it very mediocre and don't plan to make it again. The tarragon was overwhelming and the sauce was too thin to stick to the noodles at all so they tasted bland and starchy. I would, however, experiment with this recipe if there was nothing else in the house - it does have some potential as a base for a better linguini with clam sauce.

My kids loved it. The cream makes it a non-traditional rendition of clam sauce, but it holds it all together nicely. I liked the fresh tarragon. It worked for us.

This basic recipe has been in my Italian family for years. I agree, don't cook canned clams--simmer brine with the olive oil and garlic and then add clams at the end to heat. Two suggestions: substitute oregano for the tarragon, and ditch the cream--it's delicious without it!

This is my recipe, I swear. Remember buy the most expensive clams they have(for the canned) Now, all you have to do is omit the cream replace with a good dry white wine(finish the rest w/dinner). Add 2 cloves crushed garlic(remove before eating)SO, SO, GOOD With crusty bread

I think cooking canned clams for 6 minutes is a bad idea. Cook the juice and herbs and fresh clams, then just put the canned clams in at the end to heat them through. Cook 'em 6 minutes and they'll be like rubber!

A tablespoon of tarragon is totally overpowering! Yuk! Maybe a half teaspoon of fresh tarragon (which provides a totally different flavor) would work better. Also, only cook the clams for about 3 minutes, they open (and overcook) quickly.
