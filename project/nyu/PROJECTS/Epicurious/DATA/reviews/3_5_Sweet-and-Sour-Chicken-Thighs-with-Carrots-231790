This recipe very pleasantly surprised me given some of the mixed reviews. I followed it almost exactly, did add some cremini mushrooms and a tablespoon of ground ginger (half to the rub, half to the sauce). It was pretty easy and very nice balance of sweet and sour (a bit more sweet). DO NOT expect the Asian "sweet & sour" you're used to. Would totally make this again for company!

Great!!! I made this recipe as shown. Except, I used 4 good size thighs instead of eight since it was only my husband and I. The flavor was great. If I used 8 thighs it would have lost the flavor of all the spices. I also added 1 TBLS of ground ginger. I will make this again with 8 thighs and double up on everything else.

Sweet and sour..to make this into a sweet and sour, substitute brown sugar for the honey, chicken broth for the water. Add 2 TBSP fresh ginger with garlic, 1 can drained pineapple tidbits, 3 TBsp vinegar, 1/4 c of the pineapple juice, stir into it, 2 TBsp cornstarch to thicken (use more or less of this mixture, till desired consistency)

I made this with boneless chicken breasts ( that's all I had in the house) which I brined for an hour, rinsed and dried and then coated with the rub. I then cut it into chunks and followed the recipe from there. But I did add mushrooms and sliced red pepper. The chicken was very moist and tender and the veggies flavorful. But when I make it next I'll probably pump up the seasoning like some other posters mentioned. Maybe fresh ginger and hot sauce. It's definitely worth making and adjusting to your taste.

This was so excellent! Followed many suggestions here--added powdered ginger to the rub, added sliced red pepper and cremini mushrooms, used chicken broth instead of water--and it came out great. There was a lot of liquid after 25-30 min so I cooked uncovered on very low heat ~20 min and the vegetables became wonderfully caramelized while the chicken remained juicy. Think next time I might use fresh ginger added to the sauce at the end to see how it tastes. Thanks for all the suggestions. This is perfect for guests--rustic and sophisticated at the same time--or for a bunch of frozen meals. I served with quinoa, my favorite grain, and will do so again.

I have made this perhaps 4 or 5 times now. The first time, I was struck by the similarity to many Moroccan recipes. The flavor was a bit too mild for us, so in subsequent preparations, I added to the spicing, using more of the indicated spices and adding a few others traditionally used in Chicken Tagine. This is a quick and easy way to enjoy the complexity of Moroccan spicing.

The chicken was good in the end, but I found the carrots and onions to be insanely sweet. If I made it again I would use less honey. I added some flour and milk to the sauce left over in the pan and made a gravy which was good, but also very sweet.

This recipe was good and I feel liek it has a lot of potential, but it wasn't quite there for me. I served it with quinoa, which was perfect. I think couscous would also be great. I'm going to make it again and try the following: remove the skin first, add some cumin to the spice rub, let it sit with the rub on for a little while before cooking, double the onion, add a little lemon zest at the end to brighten it. I'm hoping those modifications will really take it from good to great!

This dish is fantastic -- I've served it at home to a picky 12-year-old and a sometimes particular husband, as well as to company on several occasions, and it always gets raves. I use chicken stock in place of the water, I add a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger, and I've found that it can simmer anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes -- the chicken just falls off the bone at that point and is tender, juicy, and delicious! I've made it both with and without the cilantro and either way is great. This is now my go-to dish for entertaining.

Got a "It's OK" from the family but no raves. Probably won't make it again, but if I did I would use chicken breasts with skin and ribs and I would also add some corn starch to keep it from being so watery.

Very simple to make yet very tasty. I had it go longer then 30 minutes because I was waiting on few other things. Because of that reason, the sauce thickened nicely (like gravy consistency). I think I might try and add some ginger powder to the seasoning and add cream to the sauce on my next try.

We love this dish and we have young picky eaters in our home. I also double the rub but reduce the salt to just 1 tsp. total. As I use boneless thighs, I roll them and tie the ends with string to keep a nice shape, remember to snip them off before serving. A bag of baby carrots or shredded carrots are another short cut on time and work very well. Herbs can easily be omitted if you don't have them on hand.

This was a very easy, very tasty recipe. I made it with skinless, boneless thighs and it worked out well. Fork tender with a nice pan gravy for the roast potatoes I did as a side dish.

This dish was great. Considering how simple and inexpensive it is. I agree with adding more carrots, they were incredibly delicious. I probably doubled the spice rub recipe. To make this an even easier weeknight meal (with a 3 year old) I applied the spice rub the night before, and chopped the vegetables the night before. Active time the day of eating was only a few minutes. This is going to be a staple.

This dish is a keeper. Used 4 legs and 4 thighs from the Farmer's Market. Doubled the spice using 1 tsp truffle salt. Half smoked paprika, half regular hungarian paprika. Added Fava Beans and they were kind of crucial to the sophistication and funk of the dish. Also added a little garlic powder and cumin to the rub. Used chicken stock instead of water. Next time, some mushrooms would be really nice. Baked it instead of stove top, 375 for about 30 minutes. SO MOIST!! Comforting, rustic and classy. The jus was amazing and dippable and sippable.

I love how tangy this recipe is. The lemon juice moderates the honey so that, while the dish is sweet, I didn't find it *too* sweet. The carrots and onions soaked up the lemon flavor very nicely, and the chicken stayed very moist--even with defrosted, skinless boneless breasts. It's very easy to make and I'm looking forward to doing it again.

Yuck. I used boneless chicken thighs and it came out bad. I followed the recipe exactly except that I notice just now that it called for 2 tablespoons honey and I used more like 2 teaspoons. Could that have really made all the difference? If so, don't skimp on the honey!

This is one of my and my husband-to-be's favorite recipe. Tonight will be the 3rd time I'm making it and we love it every time. I've used lime juice instead of lemon because it was all I had. I also doubled the rub ingredients - we like a lot of flavor!

I had 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs and wanted to try something new. The flavor combos sounded interesting, but in the end it was just okay. I used the measurements given, but substituted white wine for the water. This may have made it a tad too acidic/sharp. The dry spices smelled really great while cooking, so I'm inspired to try something similar in the future, but finishing it off differently.

The recipe title is definitely deceiving. This is no take out Chinese chicken recipe! The deep rich flavour of the cinnamon and paprika reminds me of African cuisine with a hint of Thai/Laon/Vietnamese thrown in with the cilantro. Absolutely delicious! Doubled the spice rub as suggested by other reviewers and the flavour was incredible; very far from bland. Used skinless but bone-in thighs and the meat was super tender even without the extra fat from the skin. Didn't have carrots so I used half a turnip instead and the earthy flavour of the root really complimented the spice mix. Used equal parts water and fresh lemon juice and the sauce was a perfect consistency. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans and the leftovers I was hoping to have were gone by the end of the meal!

This is a really interesting and flavorful chicken recipe. I served it over cous cous. One thing though, and this is probably just my inexperience: I can't seem to brown the chicken without clouding my entire apartment with greasy smoke....

Delicious but had problems making sure the thighs were done - since they are sort of oblong, on neither side (skin up or down) did all parts of thigh touch pan and so contrary to instructions, I did turn chicken (so skin side was down) once it was in pan with carrots to make sure it got cooked through. Anyone else have this issue? or have suggestions?

This dish has a really particular flavor, so I think it might be one of those hate it/love it recipes. I personally loved the spice rub for the chicken. The sauce was too tart (I used lemon & honey exactly as stated). My husband, on the other hand, was less than thrilled: ate the chicken, but didn't finish the veggies (served over rice).

Rating: 4
Everyone in my family loved this dinner. My only regret is that I didn't have any leftovers. I doubled the amount of carrots and used baby carrots. While I only used 5 thighs, it seemed the perfect amount of seasoning and sauce but next time I make this, I will double the amount of chicken and thus double all of the other ingredients. For those that said this had no taste, maybe your spices are old??? Otherwise, I can't see how anyone can say there wasn't any taste. This is actually worth the time that it takes to make and from start to finish only took me an hour.

Read all the reviews and added more carrots as suggested. Did not have honey, so used apricot preserves as one reviewer did. Overall the dish was good and I would make it again. Not an overly exciting dish, but a good way to use chicken thighs that are on sale. Since I normally use skinned and boneless thighs for less fat and quicker cooking, respectfully, I thought this dish was better with both skin and bones. To cut down on fat, degrease the sauce afterward, which I did after the dish finished. I also thought the sauce was a little thin and I reduced it adding some cornstarch. The bones made the meat more juicy I think.

Excellent! Made it with boneless skinless thighs and substituted butternut squash cubes for carrots because that was what I had in the fridge. Glad I read the earlier posts to deglaze the pan with a shot of sherry. Yummy. After cooking, I transfered the food to a bowl, keeping the sauce in the pan, added a bit of cornstarchy water to thicken it - poured it over the chicken, served with crusty French bread for dipping. Ta da! Perfection.

When I made this a 2nd time recently, I used 8 thighs (bone-in, skinned and trimmed of all visible fat) that weighed 34-1/2 oz. after prepping. Also, decreased the salt in the rub to 3/4 tsp., increased the onions to 1-1/2 and the carrots to about 20 oz. Since my thighs were quite large, it took them about 40 minutes to get done in the final step. NOW this recipe made 4 nice size servings!!! ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!! Served it over plain old white rice. DO TRY THIS!!!

Excellent recipe! I've had this in my recipe box for a while and made it tonight following the recipe exactly except for the cilantro which I didn't have on hand.

I may not have been inclined to make this dish had it not recieved such positive reviews here. I mean, I like chicken-apart from boneless skinless breasts-and I like carrots-most of the time-but the combination seemed a little ho hum. Well, I expected a lot, considering how protective epicurious reviewers are of their four fork ratings (and that's why I love this site!); but this recipe really blew me away. It just might be the best chicken recipe I've made, and the only chicken recipe I would serve at a nice dinner party. The flavors are surprising...not at all sweet and sour in the takeout teriyaki sense of the phrase: bright and clean, but with a sense of intrigue (that must be the cinnamon and cilantro). Tonight I'm trying it with a combination of parsnips and carrots, just because that's waht I have. Even if it doesn't turn out as well as the full-speed carrot version, I'm sure it will be excellent. This dish, by the way, really does deserve thighs. Come on, they're not that much worse, nutritionally speaking, than breasts, and they taste *so* much better in dishes like this. And don't skimp on the fresh herbs!

By the time I found this recipe we were already committed to chicken BREASTS. No problem. The recipe might have been EVEN better with chicken thighs, but what I made with this recipe was delicious. I will try it with thighs the next time, but I doubt that the part of the bird is most important when you have such a great recipe. Not so many years ago people bought a whole chicken, cooked it, and each person chose his/her favorite part.

I made this earlier this the year w/red-pepper spiked polenta and parm to rave reviews (the fragrance of cinnamon is amazing but yes, add more carrots). So, when recently asked to plan/prepare a meal for a women's shelter, I selected this for me and my team (it's so easy). Because of the massive quantity, it couldn't be finished stovetop. I browned all the thighs and then cooked the vegtables in the same pots but didn't put the two together until we transfered to the pans to be put in the oven. I was terribly disappointed when I pulled it from the oven a half hour later (the center closes at night and we needed it to cool before putting in the fridge). It was cooked through but with none of the lucious sauce reduction from before. Not to worry, when heated in a very hot oven the next day (for about an hour) it was perfect!. Served with mashed potatoes which I treated the same as the polenta. It and our team were so well received they have asked us to come back. Just try and stop us! This is why I cook and why this recipe will always be very special to me. Real foodies don't cook because they're hungry. They cook to feed, the stomach and the soul. That's what fills us.

Another wonderful Rosh Hashanah meal with this dish as the main course. I prepared during the day, and then placed the skillet on delay-start so the chicken would be hot when we returned from synagogue. The reviews were fanstatic - especially since thighs don't dry out.

I have used breasts before, and they're fine, you just have to shorten the cooking time so they don't dry out. I love this recipe - it's surprising and different. In a world of bland chicken recipes, this one is a crowd-pleaser and leaves your palate feeling that you've "switched it up." I love the interplay of cinnamon and paprika. The fresh herbs give a good touch. Easy and highly recommended recipe.

So this is the second Passover in a row in which I made this amazing dish - I think my review from last year must be out there somewhere.

I made this for a family dinner party, doubling the recipe to rave reviews. I didn't change much, just used boneless thighs (easier for the kids to eat) and deglazed the browning pan with sherry before adding the veggies. I used packaged baby carrots which helped cut down the preparation time. I thought the results were absolutely delicious. I served it with basmati rice to which I added a couple of handfuls of golden raisins. Next time I will add the raisins directly to the chicken mixture, as they added another tsty dimension to the dish. I also served it with a salad with maple dressing - overall a wonderful meal!! Leftovers were great too!

I have made this dish many times. It's one I make for guests because it's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. It's great with couscous, and the fresh cilantro really makes the dish. Don't substitute boneless skinless chicken breasts!! There is a reason the recipe calls for thighs with bone and skin.

A really tasty dish! Enjoyed by all, including my three-year-old. I followed the recipe except I used boneless chicken thighs (therefore reducing cooking time for the meat) and served it over ramen-style noodles. Yum, yum! It is now in my recipe box!

I used chicken breast, and it still turned out very well - my picky 4yr old loved it, and even ate the carrots without complaint. A great weeknight dinner.

Rating: 3
Excellent dish overall, if a bit oily. The flavors blend well, and none are overwhelming. Sophisticated enough for an adult palate, yet my two year-old asked for thirds! To cut the preparation time a bit, I used a Le Creuset Dutch oven in which I could brown all the chicken at once. I think this also cut the cooking time a bit (to 20 min. instead of 25-30) since it's a bit wider than the 12-inch skillet called for. I've only made this once, with that adjustment, but I don't see how all that food and sauce would fit in such a small skillet. The Le Creuset worked nicely. [Side dish note: I paired this with Aromatic Yellow Rice from Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cooking (rice, tumeric, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, a little butter, whole cloves, golden raisins added), and it was a nice match.] I'd definitely make this again, especially for a weekend meal or for dinner guests. Very, very good!

Rating: 3
Would I make it again? Maybe. Everyone who partook of it liked it, but as one person commented, "You could tell you'd eaten it for a couple of days afterwards." It didn't taste bad...it was actually quite good, but the flavors needed a little mental adjustment on my part to find cinnamon in a savory dish. With regard to the frying difficulties that Neome75 had, that's easily remedied: brown the chicken in a wok.

This recipe is great! I made this dish earlier this year, to much acclaim from my husband, who is generally a picky eater. I am making it again, adding peppers and celery. Very yummy and super easy!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I followed this recipe exact, except I placed the sauted carrots and onion with drippings into a large baking dish, then placed the frying pan browned chicken thighs on top, followed by pouring the lemon/water /honey liquid over, then covered with foil and baked in 350* for an hour. The last 15 minutes, without the foil, it made the skin semi-crisp and tacky from the honey! I then made my famous red, skin on, butter/cream/herb mashed potatoes and served the chicken/carrots and the gravy on top! We really enjoyed this dish, I will be making it again. The only downside to this recipe/cooking method...the frying...it's terribly messy. Definitely use a frying screen if you've got one!

This was incredible! I was a little leery of the spice combinations, and the honey in particular, not being a big fan of honey, but it all worked together beautifully. Double yum! The spice rub helped the chicken brown nicely, and the rest was easy. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs, by the way. What I liked in particular was that I had most of the ingredients on hand. This one is a keeper.

Odious. Something tastes a little off with the sweet and sour elements in this sauce, and even though the blurb before the recipe makes it sound exotic, it's really nothing but chicken and carrots. You could puree it and feed it to your baby I guess; otherwise, skip it.

I used skinless boneless chicken thighs to make in healthier and baby carrots to make it easier. I followed everything else to the T. We thought it was a really delicious and fast weeknight meal.

This recipe was a winner for me for sure...The best thing about it is all the ingridients are at hand ...I acutally did not have to run to the supermarket to get something!

I did it with skinless chicken tights and legs was amazing, and the vegetables were just making it all complete (I mean the carrots and the onion) DEFENTLY RECOMMENDED!

This was great for a weeknight family dinner. I used skinless chicken thighs, on the bone, left out the cilantro, and used olive oil spray instead of the oil, but otherwise I followed recipe exactly. Adding dried apricots as one reviewer suggested(and probably toasted slivered almonds too) would make it more exotic and Middle-East-like; couscous would be great. But I'm watching calories and the plain version was not at all plain and was a treat for a family meal.

Last review (Cook4YT) hits it on the nose - hilarious! I agree, this recipe is great and we all personalize by adding more of what we like. For example I'm not the biggest cinnamon fan (i.e. in chili? Uhn uh) but this ingredient is essential for this wonderful dish - and adding more lemon, garlic and pepper definitely works that out for me. GOOD FOOD!

So, after reading all 73 reviews, this is what you should do: use 4T minced garlic instead of 2T, 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup lemon juice instead of 1/4 cup. Add: 1 red pepper, dried plums, apricots or golden raisins and 1/2t ground ginger and some red pepper flakes to the spices used for rubbing the chicken in step No.1. DO THIS, and you will end up with a dish to remember. Bom Apetit !

Doubled the recipe and made it the day before using boneless/skinless thighs and simply reheated it before dinner - so simple and just delicious.

Very kid-friendly recipe too - this recipe will become a holiday regular on our table!

This recipe was great!. I cooked both chicken thighs (some without skin) and thigh/leg portions. I followed the directions for the recipe but substituted white balsamic vinegar for the lemon. I cooked it in 2 separate covered roasting pans as I made 16 servings, so rather than cooking it on the stove, I finished it off in the oven, covered at 350 for an hour.

Nice recipe. Made it today using thighs w/out skin on the bone.Used smoked paprika for half the paprika called for and also added some dried chili flakes for zip and the rind of one preserved lemon-It turned out great!! If it wasn't passover I would definately serve it over couscous. Instead I boiled some tiny new potatoes and reheated them in the pan with the chicken. The cilantro complements the flavours really well.

I was leery of all that cinnamon but this turned out GREAT. Even though I only had 6 small thighs (that I skinned and defatted), I made all the spice rub (except that I only used 3/4 tsp. of salt). Increased the onions to 1-1/2, and used a 1 lb. package of peeled baby carrots. Only sprinkled salt and pepper over the onion and carrot mixture. Next time I would use regular carrots for more flavor, and delete the cilantro (since we don't care for it). VERY GOOD.

this was easy to make with ingredients that are always sitting around in your pantry. On Thursday,I knew I was going to have a long Friday so i made the chicken the night b4 but didn't cook it all the way and threw it in the oven when i got home with my husband and 3 small children. I made some white rice and an extra veggie (green beans). Dinner was over by 8pm dishes washed and all and kids were in bed. Hubby and I got to watch the yankee game and put our feet up. If I can do this dish anyone can!! It was great tasting and the carrots roasted in the oven with that honey glaze... YUMMMO! Thanks.

YUMMY!!! I used boneless chicken breasts because they were actually cheaper than thighs. I too doubled the onion. I also doubled the sauce, except for the honey, because it just didn't seem like enough. And I like sauce to soak into the rice. Since I used chicken breasts I probably should have doubled the rub spices also. I'm also thinking that, as in other reviews, dried fruit would be very good addition. Excellent, well worth making again again.

After seeing all of the reviews, I had to make this. I'm very glad I did. Even my children ate it (and I have very picky kids)! This would be a great dish to make for Rosh Hashanah - hopefully I'll remember it when that time of year comes around again. Although I rated this three forks, I did think it was worth four forks just because my whole family ate it and it was fairly easy to make - it just wasn't a dish beyond compare (it was simply delicious, though). I made steamed potatoes with this but next time I'd try something different - maybe couscous to soak up all the yummy juices.

Rating: 3
I was skeptical of the flavor combo, but the reviews were so good, I had to try it. And I'm glad I did! This was delicious. I had chicken tenders in the freezer, so I skipped the browning stage and just added them to the simmering mixture to cut down on their cooking time. They cooked a little faster than the liquid boiled off, but the liquid was great over rice. I'll definitely make this again and play around with it a bit.

This dish was very easy to prepare with a payoff that tastes like it was hard work. I had it with basmati rice as others have suggested. I really enjoyed it, but the biggest surprise was how tasty the carrots were. I found myself savoring each individual carrot. It also fills the room with wonderful aromas as you cook it.

Everybody is right about this recipe, it is worth keeping and to share with casual company. I made a few modifications, as per some others suggestions: - used 2 large onions - added dried plums - to compensate for the swelling of the dried plums, I also increased the volume of water from 1/2 c. to 1/2 c. plus 2 Tbsp, and lemon juice volume from 1/4 c. to 1/3 c. - added finely minced lemon zest during the last minute of cooking. Serve Basmati or some type of Couscous instead of potatoes. Start with a Spinach, Grapefruit and Almond salad. Finish with a simple lemon tart (or Lemon Gelato).

The next time we adjusted things a little bit, and they loved it even more.

Just made this tonight and I think it's one of the tastiest chicken dishes I've ever had! What a great blend of flavors! I also used boneless thighs which just melted in your mouth!

This was a a fantastic dish. I also served with couscous, which was a great way to enjoy every drop of the delicious gravy. I didn't have a whole pound of carrots, so I added some thickly sliced baby bella mushrooms, which worked out well. I also used boneless, skinless thighs with no loss of flavor or tenderness. One question...although I didn't think the cinnamon was overpowering, it's not my favorite flavor in savory dishes, and I have a feeling some company (my parents, for example), may find it too "exotic." I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about what the results would be like if one replaced the cinnamon with ground coriander in the spice rub. I'll try that the next time around and report back.
