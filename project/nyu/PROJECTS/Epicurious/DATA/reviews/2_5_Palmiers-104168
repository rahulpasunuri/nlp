I make small versions of the normal sized palmiers. The trick I use is to sprinkle as much sugar as possible on top, and when I flip them in the oven, I sprinkle the side that was faced down with more sugar. This gives them that desired sugary crunch on both sides.

Try to roll the pastry as tight as you can in the plastic wrap before you stick it in the fridge or freezer. 1/4 inch thick is too narrow a cut. The pastry didn't expand, and even with less time in the oven than suggested, came out too dark. 1/2 inch thick came out much better. I would suggest giving the sheet a 180 turn in the oven after you flip the palmiers over and leaving them in for less than 10 minutes. As it is, I would try this recipe again but not without being on top of the palmiers to be sure they don't overbake. Take this recipe literally and you will have 2 plates of small dark brown pastry curls rather than anything that resembles elephant ears.

Tried this recipe but when I cut the chilled dough it all crumbled.

If you have the Silver Palate Good Times cookbook, you will find two "savory" palmier recipes. Both are wonderful and very impressive. It seems that you can roll whatever you like into the puff pastry. I recommend blanched asparagus and proscuitto, or pesto and sundried tomatoes.

I was really diappointed with my palmiers. I tried the recipe twice! The sugar kept carmelising in the oven & didn't produce a nice palmier. Couldn't imagine how I went wrong?! Puff pastry is generally a sure-fire hit. It's so easy, tasty, & rich. Oh well!

These were wonderful and very easy to make. I served them on Thanksgiving with coffee and everyone asked for more. They will definately become a tradition in our house.
