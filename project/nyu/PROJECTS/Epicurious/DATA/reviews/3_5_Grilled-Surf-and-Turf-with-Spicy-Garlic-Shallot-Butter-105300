The seasoned butter was ok as a marinade for the steak and lobster, but serving it on the side was not possible. The garlic was so overpowering, it ruined the butter. If you want to try this recipe, use only one garlic clove and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper. Also be careful of the amount of salt you put in. Sorry, but this was pretty awful. I'm glad I didn't have guests over.

Very tasty, but would make the following changes next time: saute shallots and garlic in olive oil before combining with remaining ingredients and reduce cayenne to 3/4 teaspoon.

I made this as directed and the taste of raw garlic was too overpowering for me to feel confident on using this to grill our New Year's steaks.

How do you cut the lobster tails in half... just use scissors and cut length wise all the way down?

Easy and a keeper. You'll be looking for things to put this butter on (corn, veggies, baguettes, popcorn...) but the raw garlic flavor does strengthen over time. We're thinking to roast the garlic or otherwise cook it before putting it in next time (as opposed to decreasing the amount because we love garlic). The spiciness was not at all an issue for us. Our "turf" were grilled, bone in chicken breasts and it was still a great match. My first grilled lobster tails came out perfectly by following this.

Great recipe, made it with shrimp instead of lobster. Has a great kick to it.

to master pulverizer, I completely split the tail into half and I think that was intended in the recipe as it was for 6 servings and called for 3 tails. Splitting completely in half worked well and they grilled very nicely

Rating: 3
reducing the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp worked for us. A little kick but not too much to overpower the lobster. grilling directions were perfect.

When the recipe calls for splitting the lobster is it suggesting that we fan them out with the tail fins still on or actually splitting the whole thing in half?

I grilled scampi last night with the butter sauce, following the recipe, and it was delicious! My guests kept asking me for more. Can't wait to make it again.

very good technique but shallots overwhelmed the flavors. Loved the concept but had to use plain butter for finishing due to strength of shallots. Any compound butter would work and the lobster was very tender and well cooked. substituted jumbo shrimp for steaks and it was a great way to cook the seafood which often gets dry on grill.

this is becoming the staple surf n turf recipe in my house, I tweak it depending on what I gave in the cupboard but the essential is the butter. Isn't that always the case?

Excellent butter -- I marinated porterhouse steaks, scallops, and lobster with it. Cooked up great (broiled steaks, pan fried scallops and lobster tails) -- served with the melted butter -- my husband was in heaven!

i like this recipe because of the ease and also how it uses things already in most kitchens. i preferred it on the lobster although it wasn't bad on the steak.

I've never made a review before, but I thought this was worth me reviewing! It was delicious! I didn't change one thing. It was so good that for the first time my boyfriend didn't even add A1 to his steak (which drives me crazy)Well definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe. I added a bit of Old Bay as well. The butter spread works perfectly with the lobster...good combo with steak, red potato and corn.

I made a version of this last night and it was a hit! I was lacking most of the ingredients though so the butter consisted of one stick of garlic butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil. The lobster was fantastic.

Made this over the 4th of July weekend. Wow, great butter. I also added chopped Italian Parsely for a little color and didn't put the butter on prior to cooking...did that during grilling. Although the butter was very strong, it mellowed out during grilling...provided a subtle flavor. I also reserved a little butter so I could place a dollop of butter on the steak prior to serving.

I made this a few years ago for a special NYE dinner. WOW! The lobster was great! I am not a big lobster fan, however this was so flavorful. Definately leave the butter marinate for 1-2 hours. THe filet was great too!

This recipe is excellent! I excluded the beef but only b/c I don't eat red meat. I'm sure it would be excellent w/ the beef, too. I don't usually repeat recipes, but I will cook this one again as soon as I can!

Didn't do the steaks - did them with a spicy dry rub instead - but the lobster was very good and the butter was great. I simmered the left-over butter for dipping to eliminate others' concerns about raw garlic taste, and it was great.

I made this as the center piece for our anniversary with 1lb tails it was awesome. Very easy and quick. One note if you leave the butter out for 30 minutes or more you can blend with a wisk for less mess

Great recipe as well as grilling directions. I made a few changes to the butter but other than that I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out perfect. I added chipotle pepper instead of cayenne, added some cumin seeds and I omitted the oil. I love simple yet sophisticated recipes like this one, it makes cooking a joy.

A good way to add flavor to the steak is to cook it first and top it with slices of the compound butter.

I made this for 6 on New Year's Eve 2004. Everyone thought it was amazing. I doubled the recipe for the butter concoction but only used 1 tsp of cayenne and instead of thee steaks I made filet mignon. We used the butter for the meat as well. Awesome.

WOW. I made this last night for a dinner party. I made the amount of butter sauce exactly as stated (which was for 6 servings) and there was def not enough. This one will be made again. Hint: ask the guys at the fish market to cut the tails for you. I just bought whole lobster (used the claws for something else) and it was very hard to remove tails and cut them.

I was disappointed in the sharp flavor of the raw garlic and shallots. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and used 1/2 tsp. cayenne. It had a nice bite but didn't like the bitter garlic and shallots. Lobster tail cooked on the grill according to your directions excellent.

We loved the lobster tails haven't tried it on the steak. I didn't have shallots so I skipped it and I've used ground red pepper instead of Cayenne. This is a keeper!

I never had much luck grilling lobster but with this recipe it always comes out perfectly done. I've made it several times and guests always say it's the best they've tasted. Love the garlic shallot butter.

Have to agree with the cook from San Diego. The dipping sauce was too over powering.(too much cayenne powder). Marinated the steak but the sauce did not add much flavor to the steak. I will cook the lobster tails again exactly as the recipe tells you too. The lobster tails were very moist and not dried out. This was my first time grilling lobster tails. Will use this recipe for grilling lobster tails again.

Hmmm...dissapointed. Butter was good on meat/lobster while grilling (most of it cooks off) but FAR too strong to be served on the side for dipping. And I love intensely flavored, salty, and spicy foods. On the up side, the grilling instructions for the lobster were right on. I will try something different next time... sorry to be the dissenter!!

Rating: 1
buttering the steak had no noticeable flavor impact. didnt split the lobster tails, just buttered them and grilled them shell down which was a good technique-moist result. melted butter was not very visually appealing. i think the steak would be better if the butter was served as a 'compound butter' (mix, chill in log shape, place disk on hot steak when serving).

DIdn't get the lobster, but used the marindae/sauce on NY strip steaks and as a sauce for Salmon Cakes... Nice complement... Make sure to season the butter mixture well!

My son did not want to go out for his birthday, so he picked "his" dinner. Surf and Turf. I went to epicurious and naturally found the "great" recipe. I did broil the lobster tails because it's about 25 degrees here. The garlic shallot sauce was WONDERFUL. Both my Husband and son declared it "4 forks". I started with a crab and corn chowder followed by the surf and turf and a baked potato. For his birthday "cake" we chose a creme' brulee cheese cake (purchased from Sweet Street Deserts). An absoultely WONDERFUL Dinner. Thanks

I think that the butter sauce slightly overwhelmed the delicate lobster flavor. The sauce was great and I think I would make it for a dish, like shrimp, that has a more assertive flavor.

I made this for 12 for Christmas Eve dinner, used filet mignon (pan sauteed 4 minutes per side), and baked the lobster tails (15 min at 400). Fabulous! I usually change my menu every year for this special meal, but EVERYONE requested that this become the annual fare. Excellent!

letting the tails stand for one hour with butter marinade is the real answer..but I just used a bit of butter ..lemon juice white wine and pureed garlic....forget the steak..did on my jennair grill..served over angelhair pasta and topped withfish stew without the fish and a sprinkle of the best parm cheese
