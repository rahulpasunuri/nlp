This is my new favorite soup recipe. Followed the recipe as written except that I had about a quart of good homemade beef broth on hand and used that in place of part of the water. Took along to a potluck and everyone loved it. If you're serving to a diverse group, you may want to let people add their own chopped cilantro, as some people don't like it. And don't forget a nice crusty loaf of bread!

This was great. The only change I made was to measure the spices generously (very rounded), and I used half low-salt broth and half water. Great soup, and a great way to enjoy both lentils and veggies.

This was very easy to make and delicous!! I used lentals that were already cooked from Trader Joes and that cut down on the cook time. I also added some baked chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces, yum o!!!!!

This is an excellent dish and can be prepared in a fairly short time for a vegetarian dish. The yogurt is a great compliment so I would advise using it if you can. Also vegetable broth is an excellent substitution for the water. The soup is spicy but not overly so, so adjust for your tastes.

A little bland for my tastes. I will defiantly spice it up a lot more next time. But this recipe seems like a good start.

I love this soup. It was plenty spicy as I upped the curry powder as others suggested and I also increased the crushed red pepper. I did not use the yogurt. I made it Sunday and have eaten it every day since I made it. Very nutritious and filling. No need for any meat!!

One of our favorite soup recipes. The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water.

Like others, we added 2-3x the ginger, garlic, cumin, and curry powder and subbed in 4 cups of broth for water. The result was a tasty and healthy meal that we'd certainly make again.

I think that the reviewers are right about bumping up the spices....more is better because this makes alot of soup. I would increase the curry to 5 tablespoons and 1/2 tespoon of red pepper flakes. Kept cumin at 1 Tablespoon and ginger at 2 Tablespoons Also more vegetables in better as well - double those. I used kale instead of spinach and I also finished my soup at the last minute with 1 cup of cilantro and the juice of 1 lemon. Oh and lose the meat - don't put that in....at least I didn't care for it ....messes up the texture flow - at least for me. Great soup though.

Thanks to kimpaw from Newport and her 11/2/09 comments. She knows her stuff. I took many of her suggestions and modified slightly. I first browned 1/2 pound ground turkey then put aside (add turkey back in when add in lentils). I subbed in half of cup of scallions instead of the entire 1.5 cups of onions. I used chicken stock instead of water, and used 10 cups. Additional mods: 6 cloves garlic, 1 T cumin, 3 T curry; 2 T chopped fresh ginger; 1 cup cilantro; 12 ou of spinach. A coincidential addition (due only to multiple cooking of things) was 1/2 cup of fresh tomatoes - stewed and pureed. The lentils took at least 2 hours to cook - but I consistently checked for tenderness. You will need to add liquid once the lentils are cooking. I added 5 cups of water during the simmering time. Last, my mom and I both think the cilantro should be added at the very end, say 1-2 minutes before ready to serve (versus adding in with the spinach). We followed the recipe for the cilantro and could not taste it at all. This was the BEST soup, and I will make it many more times.

This is a great recipe to make in bulk, divide in freezer bags and freeze so you can pull it our for an easy meal. I read the reviews and did make many of the changes suggested in addition to increasing the quantity. First I added 2 pounds of ground turkey. and started the soup by browning it. I then followed the recipe directions but changed quantities as follows: I doubled the onion, used 5 stalks of celery, 5 carrots, 8 cloves garlic, 3T curry (I could have gone higher), 4 T minced garlic, 1 T cumin, 2 bay leaves, 16 cups of chicken broth instead of water, 12 oz spinach and a cup of cilantro. It was great and I am looking forward to pulling out my frozen baggies for a fast meal. Next time I would add some cubed potatoes.

So great! made almost as is, did add some stock in place of some of the water, also my husband preferred it without the yogurt, but i enjoyed it with. Served with some crusty garlic bread, so delicious. Even my picky son enjoyed this one. My best advice, as with all curry dishes, get a good fresh curry (not one from walmart that has been there for 3 years); whole foods or earthfares or whatever have great bulk spices for this, use the kind you like and enjoy!!!

I've made this soup with and without meat (I prefer it with a mixture of ground beef and turkey.) I also use veggie broth in place of water and as the soup cooks add the layerings of spices and seasonings. Since we prefer this soup spicy I slowly add cayenne pepper (heated in a dash of oil first) for an extra "kick." Lastly we add chopped fresh spinach and a squeeze of lemon while serving. Delicious!

This is one of many recipes that I have found to use the overabundance of celery, carrot and onion from my CSA. It is easy, inexpensive (if you buy your spices from The Spice House), and incredibly flavorful. I used homemade stock because I had a lot of it. That made it even better.

Rating: 4
I doubled the cumin, added more but not double curry powder, 3 bay leaves, lots of garlic. After the first steps I put it all in a crock pot, added a can of tomatoe puree. the crock pot worked out so well. De-lish, I did not add peppers and tempered the spice with a squeezed lime minutes before serving. Made a huge batch will freeze 1/2.

Even though I used more spices then called for, this was way too bland for me. If I were to ever make this again (which I probably wouldn't), then I would use at least some broth in place of the water for more flavor.

This was very easy and very tasty - I loved the yogurt. Used veggie stock instead of water, used a generic "hot curry powder," and kept everything else the same. Reading the reviews, I see that people have different views about the heat of madras curry powder - I looked it up and found that it can be mild or hot, depending on how it's made. Old mate wikipedia says it's "fairly hot." I think this soup would work with whatever you have on hand, depending on how hot you like your curry. I'll make this again - hopefully it will freeze well!

This makes a wonderful lentil and spinach soup and I've been looking for a good recipe for a lentil and spinach soup for years! I've made it twice this winter, once with hot curry and once with sweet curry. It stole the show at our annual soup dinner. The only change I made was to replace the water with chicken stock (vegetable stock would work if you wanted the recipe to remain vegetarian). This is a rich, spicy, flavorful soup that is very filling yet doesn't havea a lot of fat. I'd recommend anyone try this soup. It will appear on our table frequently.

I gave this 1 fork for the recipe,I had to change it too much for any more than that. I did not have any celery so I added some leftover thinly sliced portobello mushrooms (1) also added 5 small red potatoes chppd and 1 1/2 regular szd yellow zucchini for more color. I used fresh ginger (1/2 tbsp) and used 6 tbsp garlic, (both from a jar, which is as good as fresh) and a little extra cumim no red pepper. 8 1/2 c water, and 1 c of white cooking wine and 1/4 c lemon juice and 3 1/2 tbsp veggie granules and a lot of salt (according to taste). I would make again with my variations

Very very good! Doubled spices and used four cloves of garlic, as per other reviewers. Also, used the whole bag of spinach. The yogurt at the end is a nice touch, but it's delicious (and easy) with or without it. Puréed in blender, as I prefer that consistency, but would be good as is.

This was really delicious. I used lots of regular chopped fresh spinach (more than the recipe called for - handfuls of it) and veggie broth for liquid. Didn't have ginger or coriander and didn't even add yogurt at the end - it was still fantastic and good left over the next day.

This recipe is a staple for us (on the menu every one-to-two weeks). I substitute veggie or organic/free range chicken broth for 1/2 of the water, and use 2T of Patak's Madras Curry Paste (concentrate--not the overpriced soupy coconut madras stuff they make), and I use at least 10oz of spinach. Be aware the curry paste is hot--you can omit the red pepper flakes if you're looking for a milder dish.

I made this soup with the suggestions of others..double spices. I doubled the garlic, used 2 32 oz. containers of low sodium chicken broth, and one can of beer in place of the water. I used spinach but will make it again with a small head of escrole, cleaned and chopped. I made it late morning so that it could sit. I added 2 cups of water before I warmed it because it was too thick for us. Also will leave out the cilantro next time. It is a keeper!

This was a good 'un. I do agree with those who said it lacked flavor -- making it again, I'd double the spices and use veggie stock rather than water. Also, use more red pepper for heightened zip! We forgot the yogurt and didn't miss it, but we did pair it with some crunchy garlic bread for an excellent meal.

Read the suggestions and so doubled the curry. Next time I will quadruple the curry. Also replaced 1/2 the water with veggie stock and tripled the red chile flake. Good winter supper. Served over basmati rice.

Love the recipe. Tried all the suggestions above and they're great. Even with 3-4 cups of chicken stock replacing water, it still seemed to lack depth, so half and half between stock and water might be about right. Also, it needs a fair amount of salt to give it a flavor base. With those two adds, it's wonderful.

Rating: 3
Doubled the curry. Next time might put in a little more - and yes, it is high quality fresh curry, we just like spicy food. This is very good, hearty soup. The leftovers are great for lunches during the week! The recipe says 4 servings, definitely a typo - I would say at least 8 full meals.

This is a good recipe, but only if replacing some of the water with stock. There is no depth without it. I also tripled the curry power as suggested by other writers, and I added lemon juice for more balance.

This recipe is a fantastic base that can be adjusted to your own taste easily. The cooking instructions made for flawless texture, which many soups combining lentils with hard veggies fail at. My own adjustments were taking out the cilantro and bay leaf, which I really dislike the flavor of, adding celery salt and some broken fennel seeds (not many, just enough to enhance the curry), and putting about three or four times the madras curry. The garlic flavor was barely noticable (even before adding extra curry), so you might want to add some extra if you're wanting that to stand out. The ginger was also a mere hint, but I liked it that way. The water amount was perfect for what was eaten immediately; leftovers (which got gone QUICKLY) needed some more. The other thing I had to adjust for was a lack of celery since I did this on a whim (that was one reason for the celery seed and fennel, which worked out great). For the celery (to keep proportions), I substituted an extra half cup of carrots and half cup of asparagus spears (though I added those after the carrots and onion were cooked, since I knew it wouldn't hold up as well). I think celery would work well, but it wasn't missed. In fact, this stuff was gone so fast all we miss is its great smell and taste. Yogurt is a nice touch, especially if you use hotter curries like me, but our lactose-intolerant guest didn't have a single complaint, so don't sweat if you don't have it. We were all very quiet and meditative as we let this warm us! Oh yeah, I also ground the pepper into the soup when it had around 10 minutes left since crunchy peppercorns sounded risky. Anyway, it's really easy, healthy, and fantastic.

WOW! just loved this. used some leftover bacon instead of olive oil (hey, we're not vegetarians, and it tastes good) and otherwise used 8 cups vegetable broth in place of much of the water, plus a big heaping tablespoonful of curry, plus 1.5 times the amounts of garlic, ginger and cilantro suggested. also added some lemon juice and chili powder for the hell of it. divine! the recipe as stated may well be bland (obviously I wouldn't know) but stews like this are a great chance to experiment with various spices etc. that you have lying around your kitchen. even with the bacon this is pretty darn healthy and we will DEFINITELY be making it again. oh, and if you only have lowfat sour cream lying around instead of yogurt (again, using up leftovers) trust me, that works great too.

Can only taste the curry. Had to add some veggie broth mix to it to make it palatable.

I didn't have the celery, bay leaf or cilantro (life in Africa!), nor did I have any vegetable stock (just used water) or fresh spinach (used frozen) -- and the soup turned out super delicious anyway! I did double the amount of curry, and added about a tablespoon of sugar to mellow it out a bit, which worked well. I served it over rice, sans yogurt, to my omninivore boyfriend and vegan friend -- and both loved it. Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this soup. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using vegetable stock in place of the water. I also cut it in half, as I was only cooking for two. It still made a lot. Now I have lunch for a few days! I would not skip the yogurt. I thought it was a nice touch - it kind of mellowed out the spices in the soup. I did use low-fat yogurt, though. I just couldn't bring myself to use fat-free! If you thought this recipe was bland, try more salt and pepper. It needs a lot!! Great recipe - I will definitely make it again. I would give this a three plus!

I just finished simmering the soup and have yet to add the spinach and cilantro. I can tell however from a preliminary spoonful that it is anything but bland. I used chicken broth and a nice heaping tablespoon of freshly opened Madras curry powder. Maybe those who find it bland are using sub-par or old and tired spices. Proper use of good old salt and pepper are important too. Can't wait for dinner!!

This is a great hearty soup. I added four small potatoes, cubed, with the vegetables and substituted 4 cups of vegetable broth for part of the water. I think a little lemon juice would give it a nice finish.

I made this for a Lenten supper at my church and everyone loved it, even the spinach haters. Use red lentils, which will cook up in 25 minutes as they are smaller than the more traditional brown. Madras curry is pretty mild so if you can't find it in your neighborhood, not to worry. A mild generic curry is a good replacement. I also made a minted yogurt sauce with 2 parts chopped mint to 1 part chopped basil and 1 part chopped cilantro stirred into plain, non-fat yogurt. Just a dollop on top before serving and YUM! This easy soup is a new winter staple in my house.

I made this overnight in a crock pot - sauteed the veggies and spices and tranferred them to the slow cooker, then added 8 cups of chicken broth and the lentils. I left the spinach out; when serving, I either didn't add the spinach *or* lined the bottom of the bowl with baby spinach leaves - the heat of the soup wilts the spinach and adds fresh flavor to the soup. This was very warming and quite rich tasting with all the spices and the lentils.

Rating: 2
Although everyone said they loved it, I'd try other lentil recipes before I'd do this one again. I added sauteed sweet italian sausage and used only chicken broth, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. By the time it was done cooking it was so rich I skipped the cilantro...too many flavors. A big dollop of plain yogurt and some Syrian bread toned it down somewhat.

Rating: 3
This recipe was tasty with some alterations. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I made it. It would definitely be better with chicken or vegetable stock. I'm also not a vegetarian so I added some seared chopped smoked sausage. Also my lentils took 50 minutes to soften instead of 25 (which is what the package indicated). It's a good fall hearty soup. Also it makes enough for about 6 to 8 people.

I served this soup at a dinner party and received rave reviews from everyone. Not only did it taste delicious but it also looked and smelled fabulous.

It is a pretty good base soup. One of the best lentil soups I've had. I took the suggestions of people here, I did use vegetable stock. I tasted it before I added it, and it does need the stock. I made two other changes though, I didn't have spinach so I threw in some brocolli and I added some coconut milk powder. It made 8 good sized portions. Oh, and I didn't have any yoghurt so I skipped that - would have been nice with sour cream too I think!

My boyfriend and I are vegetarians, and we thought this dish was great. However, I did alter it a bit. I halved the recipe, but still added the same amount of curry powder and cumin as called for in the recipe. I used vegetable broth instead of water, which is pretty necessary. I also used a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of crushed pepper flakes. For people who thought that the soup was bland--it might be the quality of spices that you're using. They may be too old. I would definitely make this again.

This soup is outstanding! Full of flavor (use fresh spices and Madras curry is a MUST for the heat as well as flavor!) and so easy to throw together! I made it much lower in fat by using only 2 teaspoons of olive oil and sweating the veggies in a small bit of water until tender. I used chicken base and only used 8 cups of water for a thicker version. Next time I will cut up unpeeled new potatoes and sauté them in with the veggies for some interesting texture and added heartiness to this earthy soup!

Made this tonight and it was delicious. As other reviewers have suggested, I used only Swanson fat free, reduced sodium chicken broth to cook the lentils, veggies, and spices. The soup was very thick, so I did use water to thin it. Added a sprinkle more of both curry powder and cumin before adding the spinach, as it needed a bit more spice. At the very end it only needed ground black pepper, as it was plenty salty. DO try it, as it is GOOD!!!

Great winter recipe! Thick and filling. If you use premium spices this level is enough, but you might have to add more for lower-quality curry. I skipped the cilantro and had to add quite a bit of salt since I used water instead of broth.

This soup was great, I would definitely make it again. Husband and 11 year old son loved it, too. But yes, DO use chicken or vegetable stock in place of plain water-I used half stock/half water but should have used ALL stock. Could have used more of the spices,too. But all in all, it was yummy and filling.

Great flavor combination! As I was both short on time and fresh ingredients, I improvised (note that this yields a thicker, more stew-like consistency): used frozen spinach (thawed it right in the pot, with all of the recipe's seasonings already cooking), added canned (cooked) lentils, then finished with Imagine Foods "creamy" (but healthy) chicken soup, which contributes taste and doesn't thin it out as much as water or stock would. Heat it through, and it's done 5 minutes later.

Highly recommended. I substituted a rich chicken broth for half the water and nudged up the spice level a bit, but basically stuck with the recipe as written. As mentioned by the other reviewers, it makes much more than four servings; probably closer to six or eight, depending on your appetite!

3 forks, but with modifications. I agree with everyone - use stock or broth, not water. I used chicken stock, added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes (Muir Glen fire roasted are tastiest) and squeezed 1/2 a lime into the soup. I also added some lime to the yogurt at the end. It was delicious - even my 2 year old liked it!

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe, as it looked so good in the magazine. I, too, added some broth to the recipe, as the water alone made it taste bland. Serving size was also underestimated; I had enough to freeze for future meals (not that's a bad thing). I have another lentil soup recipe which is simpler and way more flavorful, so I'll stick with that.

I made the recipe after reviewing it in my Bon Appetit magazine, so I didn't have the chance to see other reviewers' comments. I, too, found that using water turned it into essentially curried water, but to correct it, I added two heaping tablespoons of Wylers Chicken Broth "granules" and the soup turned out very well. I would disagree with the description "serves four"...perhaps if you're into "supersize", maybe, but I ended up freezing a good portion of it and got several servings out of it. Would definitely make it again, but I will probably add a little more red pepper to make it spicer.

A good cold weather supper dish. Like other reviewers, I used stock instead of water and doubled the curry.

Our whole family loved this soup. Granted the color was a little unappealing...but the bright green of the spinach and cilantro definately helped. Definately use stock and not water, I can't imagine using the water, it would be very very bland. Would also up the curry a bit. We also squeezed a lime in our bowls, nice tart touch. Used sour cream as garnish but think yogurt would be better. All together, an amazingly simply extremely nutrious and delicious soup.

my BIG TIP for not just this soup BUT ANY soup recipe is NEVER use water ALWAYS use a stock, as this is what gives it a great base and flavour.
