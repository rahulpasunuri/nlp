I found this to be a delicious alternative to the standard vegetable lasagna recipe. It is labor intensive but well worth the effort. Very rich and decadent. will definitely make this again.

um - I am thinking I know how to read english & follow recipies. so the title of this recipie says spinach pesto fontina lasagna - there is not any mention of the pesto until you get to the last part of the recipie - & guess what pesto is not even on the shopping list - but its in the title & description of some type of herb pesto. Jeanne Kelley either you should add the recipie for the pesto or list it in the shopping list or take pesto out of the title or even better you should proofread your recipie. this was a complete bummer super duper never going to use a receipie that this person writes.

I made this exactly as written and I found that the pesto totally overpowered the dish. There was no way I could have used all of the ricotta mixture - it would not have fit in the pan. You don't need two boxes of noodles if you buy the 9 oz size - one will do. I don't mind all of the steps, good lasagna usually is labor intensive, but I was disappointed in the final result. I will keep looking for a good vegetarian recipe.

I made some adjustments based on what I had available. First, I added chopped grilled chicken to the spinach sauce layer which added depth and protien. We're not vegetarians. I used half the spinach because that's what I had available from our garden. Skipped the glazing part. I only had about a teaspoon of liquid to glaze anyway. I did use a prepared pesto. Other than that followed all directions and other ingredients to the letter. Both my husband and I thought it was delicious, not bland at all, and I do love my salt. It was a very time consuming dish to make, about three hours to oven.

This was so good I nearly made myself sick eating so much of it. Don't skip the noodle soaking part - ours came out tough (even no-boil). We made a straight parsley-oil emulsion instead of pesto since we had parsley on hand, didn't seem to hurt it any (but husband said basil out be even better - agreed). Definitely will make again! Fontina is the key to great lasagna!

Big, big hit at a party - everyone tasted anise or nutmeg, but it was the tarragon in the pesto. Will make this a go-to recipe for future potlucks.

This is one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made. Everytime I make it for even the most discerning cooks, they ask for seconds or some to take home. I followed it to the letter. It takes time but worth the effort. Made it all in advance and baked the next day. Turned out perfect. Recommend it for gourmet food lovers

This recipe was very tasty and a big hit! I took lots of shortcuts based on what I had in my pantry (skim milk, frozen spinach, boiled my noodles, ready-made pesto), but it still came out great! I would happily make this again.

Made this recipe with a few substitutions (less ricotta, 4 cheeses instead of fontina, good purchased pesto). The results were very good and it wasn't too time consuming. The only difficult part was the "no-bake" noodles - I didn't want to lay them out on parchment and they stuck together somewhat. Maybe I will just use traditional noodles next time.

I don't know what people are talking about...I really don't like lasagna, but this was fantastic! I even completely screwed up the glaze and threw out most of my spinach water, but it still came out fantastic. The couple I made it for for dinner and who I let keep the rest (it serves way more than 8), said it kept getting better as they continued eating leftovers for a week! Yes, it's complicated, but fresh, high quality ingredients will stand out here. I even used a white Bordeaux instead of cheap cooking wine; it didn't call for much, so we were able to drink the rest of it with dinner. The bechamel was so good I kept trying to eat it out of the fridge while it was chilling! Did I mention I really can't stand spinach? the pesto was incredible; I think that should be saved to use by itself, as the addition of tarragon with the fresh parsley really made it sing. Bravo.

I tried this recipe because I couldn't believe people called it "bland" with all the garlic, cheese, & pesto! But gosh darn it, they're right! The spinach adds very little to the dish and dulls the other flavors. In addition, it's overly-complicated to make (like making a glaze from the spinach juice, soaking the noodles and laying them out). This dish has all the right ingredients but just doesn't perform, I'm sorry to say.

This was outstanding. My family, including my young children, loved every bite of this. The recipe calls for 15 no-biol lasagna noodles (from two boxes), I found that I only needed one box, which had 16 lasagna noodles.

Yummy! I put the nutmeg in the bechemel, that was good move! If I make it again I'll put more spices in it overall. A little bit more salt too.

I also added nutmeg to the bechmel sauce (always do).Wow, so worth the time!

This is excellent - we added nutmeg to the bechamel sauce, but that was the only change we made - delicious and well worth the time and effort!

This is a delicious lasagna! I followed the directions exactly, except for adding more seasonings to taste. I added nutmeg to both the sauce and the ricotta cheese mix, and garlic salt to the spinach. (Note, the recipe says to season to taste in several spots.) I grow my own basil in the summer, and make and freeze pesto, so I used it. Yes, there are several steps involved in making this dish, but that is true of all good lasagnas. My adult family all labeled this recipe a keeper. I will definitely make this again!

I made this with several substitutions/alterations based on what I had available. I used double the amount of shallots because we wound up cutting up double the amount but didn't want them to go to waste. We used regular lasagna noodles and cooked them most of the way before using them. A large tub of cottage cheese substituted in for the ricotta, and grated mozzarella instead of fontina. We didn't find it to be terribly bland. It wasn't particularly bold either. Just tomato-less lasagna with a heavy white creamy cheese sauce. Personally, my household prefers http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sauceless-Garden-Lasagna/Detail.aspx this recipe, it's something kinda different. Again, we use regular noodles but precook them, because my experiences have not led me to have any faith in no-boil noodles.

Well, I have to agree with many reviewers this recipe is a lot of work but I think with a few tweaks its a very yummy dish! I find Fontina to be very bland, every time I use it I am disappointed with the results so I used Cacio De Roma a sheep's milk cheese suggested by a cheesemonger in place of the fontina. Other minor tweaks: I only used 2 1/2 cups ricotta and added an extra cup of parm to make up for less ricotta. I did not add an egg to the ricotta and parm mixture. I suggest making the pesto and sauce ahead of time that cuts down on the amount of work you have to do at one time. I think this dish turned out pretty well.

I made this last night for my family and thought it was great. It was indeed time consuming but I thought it was flavorful. I skipped the soaking of the noodles step and might consider storebought pesto next time but we did enjoy the final results!

I am not rating this but I have noticed that it is tagged "vegetarian" but because it has cheese, there is a very good chance that it is not vegetarian. I do not think it is because many cheeses have animal rennet which is most of the time, an ingredient used to make cheese that contains the underbelly of a calf. If it were to be vegetarian, you would have to be very careful with the cheeses that you buy.

VERY disappointing...Spent all day in the kitchen for bland nothingness. You don't need two boxes of pasta at all as each box has 15 strips in it. Too many useless steps from zesting lemon to spinach reduction...Try the Super-Fast Spinach Pesto and Cheese recipe from this site or Bon Appetit 1999--way more flavor in one eighth the time!

We loved this recipe and I was surprised to read the harsh reviews. Yes it was time consuming to make. I made everything a day ahead EXCEPT the noodles and just kept things in separate bowls. I loved shallots instead of regular onions with the spinach. Also added lots of baby bella mushrooms sliced to the spinach. Didn't make the pesto recipe but rather used store bought to save some time. Whole wheat lasagna noodles were a nice twist.

I read these reviews after I had already started prepping and was very nervous for how it would turn out. With a few modifications, this was fantastic! I tend not to measure unless I'm making baked goods, so I may have had a few more herbs or cheese. I actually made the spinach without the sauce a day ahead, and think that may have made the difference since it was able to sit in the garlic/shallot saute overnight and probably brought out the flavors. I also pre mixed the ricotta and parm, without the addition of egg and added nutmeg for a little extra umph. When it came time to assemble, I made the cheese sauce (since it was quick and easy) but certainly cooked it longer than the suggested 4 minutes to make sure it was thick. In the ricotta layering stage, I actually spread the pesto on top of the ricotta and added diced italian tomatoes (Cento brand) to the ricotta pesto mix, as my husband cannot do lasagna without tomato! We both loved it, it wasn't overly rich or bland and I didn't have to salt the heck out of it, which is what I was afraid of reading the other reviews. Like others said, I'm not sure the glazing stage was necessary, but I do think letting the spinach sit overnight made a huge difference. Definitely worth a try!

I agree, waste of time and money for bland results, I can't think of anything to save this dish.

This dish was a big disappointment. Followed the recipe and felt it was a lot of work for very little flavor. Don't know what I would do differently to make it a better dish. Would love to find a vegetarian lasagna that is out of this world.

I think this recipe has potential but needs several changes to make it work. As is, it's fairly bland and time-consuming for what it is. Cheese: While I'm a fan of fontina, its taste did not stick out over everything else and was an expensive choice for what it was. Next time, I'd try to find something with more of a bite. There was also too much ricotta. I would probably halve the amount next time. The pesto was the interesting flavor, but there wasn't enough. Next time, I would use 150% the amount of pesto. I'd also consider using white onion instead of shallots to give it a little more texture/flavor. The spinach preparation steps seemed unnecessary. If you use fresh spinach, I would chop up the spinach some, otherwise it doesn't spread very easily. I also considered mixing it in with the ricotta so that it doesn't clump as much. You would be able to get away with frozen spinach if you were pressed for time. Overall, I like the idea... but it needs work.

I've been on the hunt for the perfect vegetarian lasagna and was bummed to find that this wasn't it. It was time consuming even with the substitution of "no boil" noodles and skipping the spinach water reduction step (could that really be necessary??). The worst part was that it was simply bland. Made me wish I had a horde of 8 year-olds to feed it to instead of a table of disappointed but polite grown ups.
