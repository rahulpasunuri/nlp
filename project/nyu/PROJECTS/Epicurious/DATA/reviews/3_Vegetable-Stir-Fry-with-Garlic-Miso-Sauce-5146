This was great. We do a lot of vegetarian meals. Made this exact as the recipe used a bag of stir fry veggies from the store. Served it with homemade scalloped potatoes. My husband loved it who is not a vegetarian.

The recipe as written was ok. I used baby eggplant, scallions, mushrooms, snap peas and bean sprouts. The sauce was not as flavorful as I had expected. Once we added a little szechuan sauce it was much better. I would make it again with my modification.

This recipe is very easy and quite tasty. Used broccoli, snap peas, sunflower shoots, shrooms, zucchini (green & yellow), and green beans. Served it over Trader Joe's frozen Jasmine rice (after microwaving, of course). Went easy on the jalapeno, because my daughter doesn't like things too spicy, but she loved it. Getting a 13 year old to eat that many veggies is tough, so I'd certainly do it again.

This was amazingly simple and terrific. Served it with Trader Joe's Frozen semi-cooked Organic Jasmine Rice (highly recommend if you have TJ's in your area) as it only took 10 minutes too.

Good! I served this with jasmine rice and shrimp satay, and my family was quite pleased. I agree with previous reviewers who increased the oyster sauce; I used an extra teaspoon of miso as well. I'd also increase the quantity of veggies next time, as three of us gobbled up the whole dish and could have eaten more.

Fantastic and simple, I added more of everything esp the oyster sauce. I also added shrimp I had sautéed separately. Served it over rice and guest raved. The cooking time definitely needs increasing. Not too salty at all.

I found this was an excellent recipe to use up all the leftover vegetables from the fridge. I did not find it too salty or needed a cornstarch/water mix. The only thing I found was that the cooking time was off (by alot) and that when adding the miso/oyster sauce it splashed up. Overall...excellent!

Tasty. Great for preparing veggies ahead of time.

Miso can be too salty sometimes. I made it with mild yellow miso and extra oyster sauce and made the veggies crispy for reheating.Good!

I too did not add the miso until I had steamed the vegetables for a couple of minutes. Otherwise a lovely, refreshing and colourful dish which I have made a couple of times already and also passed it on to my mother.

This is so easy and good! I add more veggies than just 1 pound. Also, I add more sugar and oyster sauce, less oil, and it comes out perfect.

This was a big hit with us and something we would not hesitate to serve to guests. On our next attempt, we will massage the vegetables to add a bit more color to the mix. Definitely worth a try.

The trick to following this recipe is to be very energetic when adding the miso and oyster sauce. Stir stir stir. I have made this several times, and an interesting variant is to add about 5 tablespoons of water and steam the vegetables for a minute or two, and then thicken the resulting sauce with about a teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in water.

This ended up being a tasty combination, but putting in the miso mixture so early didn't work for me - it clumped and the oil spattered. I started over, cooking the veggies first and adding the miso sauce when this was done, and that was good.

Could not locate the mso sauce so added orange juice instead
