Next time I make this, I'm going to add more cherries and chop my hazelnuts even more finely, but overall I liked it a lot. The buttery crust tasted like shortbread -- really rich. Very glad I had a stand mixer to make it it, too, as it was quite stiff. For the bottom crust, I let the chilled dough sit for 15 minutes before I rolled it out (per the recipe), and it was a disaster - softened up way too quickly and was unmanageable. Top crust I rolled directly from the fridge and it worked really well. Also loved the sugar sprinkled on the crust.

I love to bake interesting desserts and this one definitely did not disappoint. I did not have time to make the pie crust from scratch, so I used store bought shells. The pie still turned out scrumptious!

Spectacularly impressive looking pie with tons of filling and a super thick flaky crust. The small addition of nuts and cherrys makes this a more interesting and creative pie to serve with out losing any of that "apple pie feeling."

I like this recipe a lot. However the crust was quite a headache. Real hard to roll out and move it around without sticking to something or breaking, but it turns out great non-the-less. Next time I won't use any nuts. I'm not a fan of too many different textures. All in all, great pie, eat it a la mode and nut free.

The crust on this pie was wonderful. It bakes up like puff pastry. However, I found I did not care for all of the additions to the pie. I guess I am just an apple pie purist:)

I loved this pie. Roasting the apples gave them a wonderful rich flavor and pleasant texture. It is a bit dry so needs to be served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. The pastry is rich and flaky. I love an all butter crust, but you need to be very quick about preparing it. Butter pastry can be difficult to make. I did opt for macademia nuts, rather than hazelnuts, and wow what texture.

Very disappointing. We all longed for a "regular" apple pie instead. The hazelnuts sounded like a good idea, but they really just didn't work. Bland pie.

I only used this recipe for the crust and next time, if I use it again, I will change the proportions of fat to flour. The crust was really too flaky...with too much shortening. I would cut out at least half a stick of butter.

I thought this would be fabulous but I was really disappointed. It was just too bland. Not a bad recipe, I just think I will experiment with the sugar and cinnamon the next time. I guess we're just traditionalists when it comes to apple pie and were looking for something closer to that.
