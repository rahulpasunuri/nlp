I had this soup at Cibreo years ago, and I didn't realize that it contained no cream or butter until the recipe appeared in the much-missed Gourmet Magazine. The version printed here is not the one that appeared in the magazine. The original recipe, which I clipped from the magazine, called for 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes as an alternative to the whole peperoncino. If you use 3/4 tsp., as this version suggests, you may have guests running to the closest fire extinguisher or gulping down water. It tastes like something from south of the border, and I don't mean the Swiss-Italian border

This soup was great. The addition of the potatoes kept it from being too squash-y for my husband. I omitted the hot pepper and amaretto and instead served it with sharp white cheddar cheese. Delicious winter meal!

I've made this twice, Thanksgiving and Christmas! The first time I added chicken broth as recommended by other reviewers; however, for me, it obscured the taste of the squash! This time I made it with good old water, and it is MUCH better! It is a lovely, creamy soup that is healthy too!

I made this soup yesterday as I was cooking up a storm and needed something for dinner. I followed the recipe pretty much as is with the exception of the pepper/crushed red peppers which I excluded (young kids that don't like spicy food). I also replaced 1 cup of the water with low sodium chicken broth. I used a hand held blender to puree it all. To my amazement, my kids (6 and 4) loved it. My eldest actually asked for the leftovers in her lunch today. I have leftover squash so I will be making another batch this week.

I've made this soup a few times and it just keeps getting better. Most recently I made it with kabocha squash and sweet potatoes. The color was gorgeous and it had so much natural sweetness and depth. I added a little extra salt when cooking the mirepoix. At the end I had to thin it out with some boiling water. Just when I thought it was excellent I added a little more salt, and then it was divine. Finished it with a drizzle of olive oil on each bowl. Easy, beautiful and I will definitely make it again.

the original recipe calls for 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, NOT 3/4 teaspoon

I was amazed by the full flavor of this soup made without cream or milk - it was delicious. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 8oz. of chicken broth, and the remaining 20 oz. was water which I'll do again, but for a truly vegan approach, I do think all water would still taste rich. I substituted 1Tbsp of minced Jalapeno pepper for the peperoncino which I couldn't find in the grocery - it was not too spicy. My kids asked for corn in the soup - so I pureed 8 oz. of frozen corn in the batch which definitely made it a corn & squash soup - but I prefer the unadulterated taste of the squash soup without this addition.

Rating: 0
I followed the other cook's suggestion and simmered the vegetables in vegetable broth (not water) for an hour instead of 20 minutes. I also thought a whole onion was entirely too much for this recipe and will half it next time. Otherwise, this is a great fall/winter soup and a nice alternative to the heavier cream-based squash soups.

Great stuff! I made this during a blizzard, so was kind of limited by what I had on hand. I didn't have celery or carrot, but I did add one lonely little turnip that was languishing in the vegetable drawer. Since we're not vegetarians, I used chicken broth instead of water, and added a little bit (no more than 1/4 cup, but I didn't measure) of half-and-half at the very end. Also, following one other reviewer's suggestion, I used only 1/2 teaspoon of pepper flakes vice 3/4. It was GREAT, and I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this with chicken stock instead of water. It did come out a littles spicier than I wanted, but I mellowed it out by topping each bowl of soup with a dollop of sour cream. Also, I garnished with chives. It was lovely, and soooo easy.

I love this recipe!! However, I made a few adjustments...:) I simmered the vegetables in vegetable broth, not water, and let them simmer for a about an hour, not 20 minutes. If you're short on time, 20 minutes if sufficient but this is the kind of soup you wanna take your time on! Love it!!

Rating: 4
I love this soup! My only suggestion is to go easy on the salt, and if you use red pepper flakes, adjust to your own taste. I sometimes adapt this recipe to make a soup version of The Moosewood's "Arabian squash casserole", by adding minced red bell pepper, a little thick yogurt and some feta cheese, and skip the amaretti.

Rating: 3
I am also a fan of tasting the vegetables i use. I used yukon gold potatoes (great!) and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon after i pureed the dish. the spices really helped the potatoes smooth in with the squash. best of both worlds. i also omitted the red pepper flakes. next time ill experiment with using vegetable broth and maybe even a little apple cider instead of boiling water. also, i let the veg mixture simmer for 40 minutes instead of 20. very satisfying dish!

Rating: 3
I like the simplicity of this recipe. I'm all for veggies tasting like themselves, even if they're boiled and pulverized into soup. But oops, I forgot to add the salt with the veggies and I must have somehow *doubled* the red pepper flakes because the only really notable aspect of this soup was how terribly spicy it was. I'm sure if I remember to add the salt earlier next time, and maybe kick in a dash of cayenne instead of eyeballing the red flakes, it will be a tasty and healthy-feeling soup. (For anyone who finds themselves in my unfortunate position, a pat of butter and a healthy splash each of water and milk toned down the heat a little bit.)

This was such an easy soup to make. I had all the ingredients on hand and is something you can really throw together very quickly. I doubled the recipe - so i used half chicken stock and half water. I used an immersion blender right in the pot so that was very easy. The texture is very nice and smooth, it was very tasty, and the red pepper gave enough heat to make it interesting. Loved it! So easy to make.

I have a mixed vegan/carnivour crowd for holiday dinners. This soup was perfect for everyone. I used vegetable stock and red pepper flakes. While I initially thought some roasted garlic might be necessary it was not. It would however be a great addition. I did a little sour cream and chives on top for presentation although also not necessary. This soup's flavor is surprisingly complex but so easy one could make it every week.

this is a very different soup for those that are not into cream based soups. my husband does not like butternut squash or cream and somehow he loved this soup. the flavors are very complex, for as simple and EASY as it is to make.

I made this for our thanksgiving dinner. 13/14 adults and 1/4 kids at our table enjoyed it (the other kids wouldn't try it, oh well). I used an immersion blender, as suggested by one other chef a few reviews ahead. I had to triple the recipe because I had a lot of guests. I also added a cup of nondairy creamer to make it extra creamy. Delicious!!

I made this as a starter for my boyfriend's family for Thanksgiving. When my boyfriend and I made it per the directions (with chicken stock though) it still just tasted like pureed vegetables. My boyfriend said it tasted like baby food. Then he had the brilliant idea to add roasted garlic to it. So we did and it was sensational. The crumbled cookie added a really nice sweet crunch. I kept the pepperocini in the soup and pureed it, and it had a lot of zing. Really great, healthy, hearty soup. We gave it three forks for the actual recipe, but with the extra flavoring of the roasted garlic it was definitely four-fork-worthy.

Loved this! Used red pepper flakes which were still too hot for the kids. Hubby and I will make this again and again. Also celeriac instead of celery.

I thought this was a great veggie soup. I was surprised by how much flavor there was. I roasted a red pepper and used that instead of the flakes. Used only a touch of oil. Also added an apple (I often throw an apple into soups). Delicious and filling! Get an immersion blender. It makes ANY soup a breeze!

I made this with the red pepper flakes, and found the result to be disappointing. The soup has very little taste except for the zing you get with the red pepper flakes. If I were doing this again I would play around with different spices or fresh herbs, to try to make the flavours a little more complex.

This was really good. I used vegetable stock and some thyme and I cut the red pepper flakes to a generous 1/4 teaspoon, but still found it a just a little more spicy than I liked. I will definitely make this again.

I Love this soup. It has a beautiful silky texture and just the right amount of heat to spice up the sweetness of the butternut squash. I used chicken stock intstead of water and used the red pepper flakes (the full 3/4 tsp) instead of the fresh pepper. I used a handblender to save the step of having to puree the soup in the food processor. Served it with a small dollop of creme fraiche and a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan (as i didnt have any amaretto cookies) Reheats very well. I will make this soup again and again.

As is, the soup was rather bland. It would probably be better with a light vegetable stock instead of the water, but then it would contain a lot of sodium. However, afer I added a dash of cayanne, a shake of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. dry thyme, this ended up being a delicious soup, creamy and yummy comfort food.

This is my first one fork rating at this site. The soup lacked something. It was flat. I used the pepper and not the pepper flakes. I used curry powder per other readers suggestions, but even that didn't help. When I pulled it from the heat, I tasted it. It was obvious it needed something more, so when I pureed the soup, I pureed the pepper in with it. That still didn't help. I added some half and half, some freshly ground pepper and more salt. Only then was it what I consider to be fairly good. My husband liked it, which surprises me because he likes things extra hot. With tweaks here and there, it could be a good recipe, but as written, it is not something I would make again.

I guess I was disappointed when I learned this recipe came from a different Fabio than whom I had hoped. This soup will forever have a flat taste to me now.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My family loves it and I have made it many times. It is very creamy. I made it using the amount of pepper they called for and it was to spicy but from other reviewers I have just read that it's a typo and the original recipe only called for 1/8 of a teaspoon. As winter is approaching I know that I will be once again making it very often.

I fiddled with this recipe a lot in terms of the seasoning, so I'm not going to rate it. But I will say that the potato to squash to liquid ratio in this recipe is just perfect. Too often, recipes for squash soup end up too thin or too thick. This was just right.

As a student living alone, I don't have a lot of time to cook dinner every night so I've gotten in the habit of making a pot of soup and eating it throughout the week. This soup was easy to make and tasted delicous. I noticed however, that when frozen and thawed again, it turned quite chunky. Re-blending it seemed to fix this and it tasted the same as when it was fresh.

Made this soup tonight for dinner. Wow! I followed other reviewers suggestion of adding fresh grated ginger and worcestire sauce and decreased the hot peppers to 3/4 tsp. I also added about 2 tsp. sugar which "rounded" the flavours out beautifully. The consistency was like velvet in the mouth.

Simple and tasty! We actually had Tuscan olive oil on hand (brought back from our last trip), and boy did they work well together! I omitted the pepper flakes (can't do spicy!) and celery (didn't have it on hand), and even my husband loved it. Nice recipe to offset a few days of bad eating habits.

I didn't modify the recipe at all except I used turban squash, and it came out really good. It was creamy, flavorful and easy and I would definitely make it again.

A real winner. We served the soup to about 160 people at a chuch social and it received an ovation. People that hate squash loved the soup. The only change was we used about one-third of the red pepper. We are still getting requests for the recipe. A real winner.

The recipe as written would only receive two forks, but MODIFIED, it's easily a three forker. Very yummy. I needed a creamless soup for a formal dinner party including a lactose intolerant guest. Before I made this, I read the reviews, and already had a head's up that it needed doctoring. I added ginger and worsteshire sauce, and garnished all but the one guest's with a dollop of sour cream and some hot buttered pecans. It was a huge hit, and quite delicious.

While I've had better butternut squash soup recipies (this didn't seem all that creamy to me?), it is quick, easy and very flavorful (cut back on the pepper if you don't like spicy foods). I used mostly vegetable stock, some water and added about 1/2 cup of sherry. An added bonus: the flavors seem to mellow for the next day's leftovers - yum!

Fabio, you bore me. A mental taste test revealed little flavor, even with a chicken stock. But I was tempted by the promise of a creamy creamless soup.

This was fantastic! I can't tolerate dairy products and was happy to find a squash soup recipie without cream in it. It tasted so good that I ate it all in one day by myself! I did use the chicken stock, but might cut down a little on the pepper next time, it was a bit hot for me.

This is a wonderfully creamy soup and only 2 points on Weight Watchers scale if you use 1 Tbs. of olive oil and don't use the amaretto cookie.

My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by this soup, although I did make some minor adjustments. I'm not a spicy food person, so I omitted all of the pepper except a pinch of cayenne. I found that added just enough zip for me. Also didn't have any sea salt on hand but I don't think it was too essential. If anyone owns one of those little hand-held mixers, I HIGHLY recommend using that right in the pot rather than trying to transfer back and forth to the blender! So easy! I will make this soup again when it's wet and cold outside.

I have made this soup many times. Consider this receipe as a blank canvas. You can change the taste considerably with the herb of your choice.

I've made this soup MANY times before. Even though it calls for butternut squash, try yellow summer squash (that's all the grocery store had the first time I made it and I'll NEVER make it different). Especially for those that didn't like it the first time around, I think you'll like the yellow summer squash. Just peel it and take the seeds out with a spoon - really easy. I add veggie broth and sometimes a little water if needed. I made this for Thanksgiving and my stepbrother (who ONLY likes pasta) loved it. I'm making it again tonight....

Yum, Yum, YUMMY! I made this soup this weekend and it was a great hit! I used chicken broth instead of water (based on previous reviews), and think I could have probably gotten by with 1/2 water and 1/2 broth. I used the pepperoncino vs. the crushed pepper flakes. I also roasted the squash ahead of time since it's so hard to cut up raw. Brought left overs into work today and got rave reviews from everyone. MAKE THIS SOUP! You won't be disappointed.

I added a bit of white pepper along with the red (1/8th tsp of each) as well as a touch of cumin. I also used vegetable broth instead of water. It is very good, although next time I'll just use the white pepper I think (or not, it is nicely spicy now but maybe a touch too much for some people). Glad I read the reviews, 3/4 tsp of pepper would have been way too much, the other flavors are too delicate to withstand that much heat.

I have not made this recipe as of yet, but I definitely intend to make it this weekend-it sounds delish. One rater commented that she used acorn squash which was a pain to peel. Here's the thing--ANY squash is a pain to peel when raw! I am going to split the squash in half and roast it cut sides down for about 40 minutes-the outer skin will just peel right off with no problems. I think it will be easy to adjust the recipe to accomodate this. Also-roasted squash sounds a lot more tasty than boiled, I reckon!

I've had this soup at Cibreo several times. It and his cream of golden pepper soup, garnished with a "raft" of robbiola are wonderful. Perhaps his is the only restaurant in Italy (the only one I know of after having lived there for 10 years) that does not serve pasta. I've tried this recipe and it brought back wonderful memories of late evening dinners there on the Piazza San Abrosia...
