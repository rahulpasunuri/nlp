Recipe turned out nicely and smelled lovely while baking, however it tasted.... blah. Was pretty disappointed considering the effort involved. Still, I would make this again, after I figure out how to make it a little more flavorful.

This was very yummy and not really difficult or time consuming. I baked slices of Chinese eggplant and added shitake mushrooms as I only had 1 lb eggplant. The only other change was adding an extra teaspoon of cumin.

This came out perfectly. I was a bit nervous after reading the cook from Germany's review, but I suspect her's was mushy because she used too little phyllo or too little oil (or perhaps her oven is off). I followed the recipe with regard to that and both bottom and top were wonderfully crispy--like a well-made spanikopita. I used cheddar and pecorino since my market didn't have the other cheeses. I didn't want to spend all that time frying the eggplant and I prefer less oily foods, so I baked them (as per the German cook's direction--only two of them at 400F for 45 minutes until they were wrinkly, no draining needed). After they cooled a bit I put their innards :) in the food processor and pureed them as I didn't think I'd enjoy the mouth-feel of chunks. I mixed everything together as per the recipe. I was a little nervous about the cumin as I tend to associate it with tacos and Indian food, so I only used 1 tsp. I discovered that in this dish it brought out the earthiness of the nuts and cheeses and thus complemented it perfectly. I won't have any hesitation next time, but I will stick with 1 tsp. since that seemed adequate to me. I used a pan that was about 9"x5"x2" and it was filled edge to edge to rim. I enjoyed the dish very much. I'm planning on making it when school starts again as a lunch take-along. It'll be a nice variant from sandwiches!

Excellent recipe. I grilled the eggplants, sliced as prescribed, with the skins ON and I love the difference vs. w/o the skins. Chopped the walnuts roughly...not too finely. Omitted the cumin and instead added 2 TBSP sugar and a bit of cinnamon. Delicious!

I was nervous about making this after reading some of the negative reviews, but I ended up enjoying it. I used 2 eggplants instead of 3 and used pecorino and feta from sheeps milk for the cheese. I roasted the eggplants whole in the oven (prick all over with fork or knife then roast at 400F for about 40 minutes or until a bit blackened and collapsing. Peel skin off and drain eggplants if necessary.) rather then dealing with the salting and pan frying. Its A LOT less labor intensive and healthier as well since you don't use all that oil. I had problems with the phyllo, I only used 5 sheets and thought that was definately enough..I disliked how it was mushy on the bottom. Next time I would either not use the phyllo as a bottom layer or I would use lasagna noodles instead.

Seriously? Active time 1 hour?? Start to finish 3 hours??? Try about 3 hours active time and 4-5 hours total. And that was with some pretty intense multitasking and time management. Guests liked the dish, but it was not at all as cheesy as I would have hoped and tasted of mushrooms even when none are in the recipe.

I haven't actually made this yet but wanted to add a tip about cooking eggplant from the most recent Cooks Illustrated issue. It advises you to microwave the eggplant for 8-10 minutes prior to sauteing it (using less oil too). It also keeps the eggplant from getting mushy since it's basically dry before you saute it. I made the accompanying Caponata recipe in CI using this technique and it worked great.

Eggplant is a great vegetable, but why oh why do recipes tell you to fry eggplant, adding oil "as needed". Eggplant will suck up all the oil you give it. Much better to brush with oil and broil in the oven. Easier, healthier, better tasting. A cup and a half of oil? Gag.

Worth the effort! When I make it again I am going to bake the eggplant, pan frying takes too long! I am going to omit salting the eggplant too, with the cheese, it was slightly more salty than I like. But this is on our list as one of our favorite recipes! I served it with the Swiss chard with raisins and pine nuts. ( Recipe off Epicurious) That was fantastic too!

I baked the eggplant, which cut down the time and oil factor. Still a lot of work, but definitely worth it.

I followed this recipe closely. The entire pie was so oily. Far too much oil for my taste. Good flavor, cheeses went well with the walnuts. I would broil the eggplants if I make it again

It is something different to make with Phyllo dough. It is a little too salty, but worth trying.

Way to 1960's "granola". Needed pep and complesity. I removed the eggplant from the phyllo and put it into a pasta recipe to save all the ingredients.

After draining the eggplant, I brushed it with a little olive oil ahd baked it in a 375 oven til golden, turning halfway, about 20 minutes total. This cut down on the oil. I then followed the recipe, adding 3 cloves of crushed garlic to the leeks and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a shake of hot sauce. This brightened up the flavour considerably. I toasted the walnuts and only coarsely chopped them, to allow their crunch to shine. All in all, it turned out very good and I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN.

Very greasy -- if I made it again, I would have tried to drain the eggplant more after frying. It also needed more cumin. I was just a little disappointed; I didn't think it was worth the effort (but it was fun to make). Oh, a hint -- try using 2 pans to fry the eggplant, it will speed things up a LOT.

This is a great dish that I will definitely make again. The eggplant step is the longest, but you can easily do this ahead of time, and store the eggplant, covered, at room temp. The ratio of eggplant to walnuts and leeks is perfect. I would recommend increasing the cumin a bit, and sauteeing some garlic with the leeks as well.

I love eggplant and always am looking for new ways to incorporate into our menus. This was delicious. It does take a bit of time to prepare the eggplant but worth it in the end. I realized that I didn't have phyllo but had a sheet of puff pastry. Just rolled it out, piled on the filling, folded over the edges and made a free-form pie. Baked it for about 30 minutes and it turned out great. Much easier that working with the phyllo.

I made it frying the eggplant, as the recipe stated, using three eggplants. That is truly the most time intensive part. Turn on some good music, that will make the time fly. That aside, the final product was tasty. I eyeballed all my measurements, so I'm not sure they were exact but the proportion seemed correct. The only thing I changed was using fewer phyllo sheets- after 2 hours I was reading to get it into the oven. Nice smoky fragrance from the cumin. As I heated up leftovers tonight, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is day 2. This is definately a weekend dish (when you have three hours to spend in the kitchen.) All in all a nice alternative to a meat centered meal.

I just finished making/eating this dish, and I have a few comments. First of all, I baked my eggplant instead of frying it, as eggplant soaks up loads of oil when you fry it. I also increased the cumin by 1 teaspoon and decreased the eggplant by 1/6. Besides that I stuck to the recipe. I was very excited about this recipe as it was full of awesome ingredients. However, I feel the eggplant overpowered the other ingredient even after I decreased the amount. The walnuts, leeks, and cheeses were not able to shine through as much as they should have. The timing is also off as it took much more active time. I might possibly try this recipe again sometime, but I would def. decrease the eggplant.
