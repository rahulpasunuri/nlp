This was just "good" (two forks). I followed the recipe exactly and it had a very "basic" taste - - probably because it has no herbs or spices. It does taste very "healthy" though (sort of a 1980s "health food" vibe). Will not make again.

Great easy dish--made 1/2 recipe which would serve four generously.

I did not use bulgar and only used 1/2 cup of wild rice because I was only cooking for 2. It was delicious. It's nice to have a side dish that is veggie heavy.

This is a healthy, easy to make recipe. Made it for my family and they really enjoyed it. I added some different vegetables, like snowpeas, and it turned out fine. Easy to make the rice and bulgur ahead of time.

Whilie making this, I kept thinking this would be bland. But surprisingly, it was delicious! And the leftovers were even better. Since I only had salted butter, that's what I used and omitted the extra salt. No other changes. Super simple and healthy!

I halfed the recipe and was plenty for our family. Made it with Meatloaf and it was a nice change from mashed potatoes.

Went very well with wine braised leg of lamb. Next time I would half the amount of bulgar, wild rice, and the onion. Would still feed eight.

Very good, very easy. I mixed cooked shrimp into the final dish. Could use a bit of spicing up but I can't think of what to add. Any suggestions?

Very tasty. I made the dish with vegetable broth and a mix of wild rice grains since I didn't have plain wild rice in the house. I served with grated asiago cheese and sauteed spinach.

I used chicken stock in place of plain water and this was wonderful. Hih=ghly recomemded! It will go with anything really!I will make again and again. I'm sure it will appear as a side dish to grilled lamb for company soon.
