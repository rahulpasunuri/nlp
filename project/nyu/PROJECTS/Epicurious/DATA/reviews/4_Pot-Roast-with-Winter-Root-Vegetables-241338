Very tasty. The celery root was OK - could probably use potatoes instead. If you don't cook the liquid down as much, it's a stew.

Made as directed while substituting dried thyme for the thyme (2 tsp) and beef stock for the chicken stock. In my opinion the recipe leaves out the directions needed for perfect results (although experienced cooks would take these for granted). I let the roast come to room temperature before applying the rub, and let it sit for half an hour with the rub on it before browning. Likewise, I let the roast sit, tented loosely under foil, for 20 minutes after cooking before slicing. (Looking for too much info on letting your meat sit? http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/12/how-to-have-juicy-meats-steaks-the-food-lab-the-importance-of-resting-grilling.html) Really excellent dish. Served with boiled yukon golds and steamed black kale paired with a 2001 Gran Reserva Rioja (in 2012). A perfect winter dinner.

Great recipe, we did modify by using 2.5lbs buffalo pot roast, no celery, cut back on the salt (bacon and broth contributes salt). The pot came off tender, the sauce was very nice and we served it with couscous.

I was really disappointed in this recipe given the rave reviews. There were far too many vegetables relative to the amount of meat, and I ended up throwing them away. In fact, unlike most pot roasts, no one wanted to eat the leftover meat, which I was able to salvage by making a soup. Tremendous waste of ingredients, IMO.

wow, this was beyond extraordinary! i saw it had 4 fork rating and did not read any reviews but this exceeded any expectations i may have had, unusual flavors and got rave reviews from my guests and looked beautiful.

Found this recipe to be really disappointing. After four hours, between getting the celery root etc, we followed to a T and the meat is tough, the juice nothing to rave about. Someone gave us a gorgeous grass fed roast where he'd raised the animal himself. This was a really disappointing recipe and the meat is overcooked and bland. Way too much work for what it is. Next time, salt, pepper, and stick it in the oven till medium rare. This recipe ends up with tough, boring meat. I'd also rather have just roasted the veggies in a little olive oil in the oven -- veggies cooked in broth just don't do it for us. BLeh.

This was a great pot roast dish. I subbed out the parsnips for some yukon gold potatoes. I will definitely make this again.

A good, solid pot roast recipe. Loved the root veggies, but cooked them 1/2 the requested time to retain some texture. Flavor is decent, but not wow-worthy. Recommend roasting longer to create a more tender dish. Taste is a B, texture a C, ease of preperation a C-, expensiveness a B-, presentation a C+, so overall the dish is a C+.

Loved this recipe. I've always hated beef pot roast as it's usually dry. The red wine and combination of spices made a fabulous sauce that kept the meat tender and juicy. Yay! This was my first time cooking with celery root - the whole family loved it! - and it was a great change from the standard potatoes and carrots pot roast medley.

Great recipe! Easy to prepare, but takes time to cook. The sauce is outstanding. I forgot to get parsnips and I used potatoes instead - still wonderful! I'll make this again.

An excellent pot roast - will make again. My husband loved it! I was tempted to subst. the chicken broth for beef broth - but instead followed recipe - and glad! However - next time I make it, I will probably prefer serving the next day. There was a lot of fat in the sauce (from bacon, and marble in chuck) - yet we all enjoyed - but it is easy to skim the fat after refridgerating overnight. A GREAT WINTER DINNER!!!!

I don't know why the photo they chose to represent this recipe is of some sick nasty dried out looking roast beef + a carrot - so ignore the photo. Follow this recipe exactly, and you will create the greatest pot roast in the entire world. Ok...well, I did replace the celery root and parsnips with potatoes, because it was what I had/to me, I think red new potatoes and pot roast go together like Peanut Butter & Jelly - BUT OTHER THAN THAT, follow the recipe exactly and you will have the greatest pot roast in the world. Note: I've used this site for about 5 years now, and I've never written a review until now. That's how impressed I was by the roast.

Excellent pot roast. Seasonings, wine, onion, shallot, and garlic created great depth of flavor in the gravy. I used (unsalted) beef broth because it was on hand. Added more to the pot as it cooked. No salt or pepper necessary. Perfect as is! Served with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. Yum!

Best pot roast ever. Don't change a thing except for the combination of root vegetables. Use what you have but don't use beets unless you roast them separately. Pink food is a bit unappetizing.

Too bad for that horrid "arty" photo (if that's what you call it), because this pot roast is fantastic. Served with egg noodles and a green salad.Way better than what mom and dad served in the 70s--sorry mom and dad! The paprika adds an interesting depth and touch of sweetness. Seems like a lot of onions, shallots, and garlic when you're chopping, but no worries--they all cook down to a wonderful sauce. This will be going in my permanent recipe file, and would be a homey yet sophisticated dish for guests.

Made this again...only this time needed it to be cooking while I was out - so wanted to use the crock pot. Seared the meat on the stove first. Cooked the bacon first too. Then put the meat on the bottom, added the wine / broth, then added the veggies on top. Cooked it most of the day. It was super terrific this way - cooked about 6 hours...

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious! I loved the way the flavors were layered, and the celery root was a big (and unexpected) hit. My only regret was that this didn't make more sauce, so I think I will add a bit more wine and stock at the beginning of the cooking process. Mushrooms would have been absolutely lovely as well, and I will add them next time.

Rating: 4
What an amazing pot roast! The roast that I had in the freezer was a bottom round, so I used that instead. Here are some changes I made: -longer cook time by about double, it didn't seem tender enough at 1.75 hrs -omitted the stock and used water. The salt in the rub was enough to make the sauce perfectly salty -the recipe was still excellent without the shallots or the celeriac. I just didn't have those in my fridge! Don't omit the red wine, it is key!

I had to double this recipe to make enough for my family for Sunday dinner. I couldn't fit 2 cast iron pots into my oven, so I cooked one on the stove top. The oven-baked one was better. The meat was more tender and the sauce thicker. The whole family raved about the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I used chuck roast. I will definitely use this recipe for my pot roasts in the future.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Made this for friends, and it was a big hit. I used rump roast, which took about an extra hour. Served over buttered egg noodles to rave reviews. Next time (which will be very soon) I will add even more vegetables and more liquid to get more gravy. This was really really great and not hard at all. It would probably work well if adapted to a slow cooker (crock pot).

Making this for the second time right now and the aromas are driving us all craazy -- so delectable. This is the first pot roast I have ever really loved. Between the rub and the selection of root vegetables the mix of flavors is rich and delicious.

Rating: 4
This has to be the most amazing pot roast I've ever had. I even bought the wrong cut of meat, a rump roast. And it still turned out perfect. The meat fell apart. There was no need for a knife. Because of the less fatty cut, we did end up cooking it slower and on the stove top. Simmered it for about 6 hours. I'm afraid to use a chuck roast because I don't want to mess with perfection. But judging from other comments, I'll have to give it a shot.

Rating: 4
This is an exceptional recipe and meal. So wonderful and I would definitely be proud to serve it to guests (which I'll do tonight). The concept of pot roast always sounded gross and sort of 1950's to me, but forget that. Do you know what really makes this recipe? It's the celery root. Don't skip that. I guess I'm so used to having slightly squishy potato and carrots with a dish like this, but the parsnip and celery root really stand up to the job and don't deteriorate. Does not disappoint!

Rating: 0
Great flavor and simple to prepare. Worked fine in single stove top pot, no oven needed. Used turnip roots, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes. Great mix of flavors!

Good the first time (I made it as directed) the roast was stringy but the sauce was great. Bought a new Emeril cast iron dutch oven and made the recipe a second time except cubed the meat and rolled in seasoning. Upped the wine and added crimini mushrooms, and the meat was moist, flavorful and tender. I think it's the pot that slow cooks and infuses everything with flavor. My husband and I both enjoyed it with buttered noodles but next time will make mashed potatoes. Will make again and freeze some for a cold winter night comfort dinner.

I have never made Pot Roast before - this was our xmas meal with my mother - and it was awesome. The rub was key and I doubled the amount - braising the meat initially sealed all the juices and ymminess inside. Two hours 45 minutes was enough to bring the meat 160 degrees with a thermometer. Added the carrots, parsnips and celaric root after an hour of roasting meat. Never turned the meat after the first hour. Two whole bulbs of garlic - b/c I love garlic and used Sherry not red wine - didn't want to waste my stash. Made a really nice gravy with the juices. highly recommend this dish - good luck!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this, though for us 45 minutes wasn't long enough for the vegetables. The next time we make it, we are going to add the carrots etc. at the beginning with the onions and halfway through, put the meat on top of the veggies. We also are going to add mushrooms.

Rating: 4
I'm not usually a fan of pot roast, but this was great. Before putting the other veggies in I used an immersion blender to puree the onions. I didn't have wine on hand so used chicken broth instead, added a bit of sugar & some tomato paste. Veggies used were carrots, sweet potato, red potato & little frozen onions. Will definitely make again. The rub on the meat really made the sauce.

This has become our house pot roast. I has amazing flavors and is so delicious that we crave it. Because of a red wine allergy in the family we use dark beer in place of the wine. It works perfectly with the root vegetables and onions. I can't recommend it highly enough!

I followed this recipe as written, with the exception of adding 1 cup of beef stock instead of the 1/2 cup of chicken and omitting the bacon (used sunflower oil to brown the meat). It was so simple to make and absolutely delicious; my husband was in heaven. And I highly recommend using the celeriac and parsnips - they give the dish a wonderful earthy wintery flavour. This may replace "Beef stew with Herb Dumplings" as our favourite winter comfort meal.

This was the best pot roast I've ever made. Used Beef Stock, and added potatoes. It was very flavorful and made the house smell amazing! This will be my go-to pot roast from now on. Didn't think I liked parsnips until I had them in this- sweet and delish!

Outstanding recipe. I'll make it again. I agree the paprika rub makes this roast. I added perhaps a little bit more of the paprika, and added a rutabaga and a red potato. The celery root, parsnips and rutabaga were standouts! Excellent.

Really quite delicious! This is going into "the other season" rotation. The spice rub is the signature for this roast--we did use dried thyme which worked fine. Halved ingredients as roast was 2 lbs. Omitted bacon and roasted on rack in pot to decrease fat with baby carrots,red potatoes, and onions on top. Used 1 cup chicken stock, 1/4 cup red wine, 1/4 cup water. Didn't fully reduce but will save this delicious au jus for soup later. Took just under 2 hrs to roast and it was perfect!

I made half this recipe using a 2 (lb.) chuck roast and divided the cooking time in half. In the future I will definitely use a meat thermometer to ensure the roast is medium rare to medium,which is my personal preferance or I will use a crock pot. Following the written directions, my roast turned out well done and tough. I will probably double the amount of celery root, parsnips, carrots and will add potatoes but again that is personal preference. The good thing about recipes you can always tweak and make adjustments to suit your own personal preferences.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Our new favorite pot roast recipe. Made a few changes b/c of ingredients on hand: rump roast instead of chuck, dried thyme instead of fresh, beef broth instead of chicken, left out shallots, used potatos instead of celery. After cooking bacon, searing meat, and preparing sauce, I cooked this in the crockpot and it came out great. I added veggies at the end after I came home. I also used about 1 cup of broth to make sure it had plenty of sauce in the crockpot.

Best pot roast recipe yet! The flavors are great and the bacon is an excellent addition. The only changes I made were beef broth instead of chicken and I used 2 cups because I like more juice. I omitted the parsnips and added potatoes and the cook time was about 1 hour for the veggies. I also added a half more of the rub for more flavor. This is definitely a keeper everyone in my house loved it!

Rating: 4
Excellent pot roast. I misread the recipe and didn't mix and rub the first 6 ingredients on the beef before browning, so I added it before I put it in the oven. If you do it that way you might want to decrease the black pepper a bit. I didn't add the root vegetables but roasted them separately on a large 1/2 sheet pan. I cooked it for at least 1 hour more because the cooking time didn't seem quite enough. Thickened the sauce and it was wonderful. Don't skip using the bacon.

Living in Denmark currently and found a special on "grydesteg", which translated as pot roast. I had never made one, but found this online. Root vegetables, like celery root and parsnip, are really big here (one reason I selected this recipe). Danish bacon is really meaty, and I needed to add a little oil to brown meat. It was even better two days later, and it got more tender, too. Would definitely cook it for four hours and a day or two earlier next time, and by the way, that will be for company this weekend! For once I did not cut corners, though I omitted the mustard powder by choice. The result was one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever cooked.

Made in the crockpot; took about 7 hours on low heat. I was impressed with the flavors, although it didn't stand out any more than most pot roasts I've made, to be honest. Wouldn't cut the bacon up so small next time and would recommend way less onion. The spice blend on the beef is what made this special, I think!

This was great. Tweaked the recipe a bit though. Forgot to rub the roast, so put that rub in with the wine to reduce and added about a quarter cup of balsamic to that as well. Did it at a friends house and he doesn't have a roaster, so we just did it in a pot on the stove. Cooking time should be adjusted a bit as we like our meat to be bloody. After the hour and forty-five minutes the internal temperature was a bit high for us, 145F, so about twenty minutes less would've been ideal. With doing it on the stove we added about a cup of water to it as well! And we used a 5lb. inside round roast instead of the chuck specified. Will definitely be making this many times.

Fabulous! This is even better than the recipe that I've been using for the past 20 years. I prefer to braise in a pressure cooker rather than the oven, so I made minor adjustments. Just as written up to the point of putting it into the oven. Instead of putting it in the oven, I cooked it at the low pressure setting for 70 minutes, allowed the pressure to go down naturally. Added the root veggies and cooked at low for another 25 minutes. Again allowing the pressure to go down naturally. Tender, wonderful blend of flavors.

This is a BEST POT ROAST RECIPE! Here are my suggestions after making it once: 1. Use beef broth instead of chicken broth. 2. For more gray, double the recommended amount of beef broth and red wine 3. Add extra carrots. 4. Cook a total of 4 hrs. and Let cool up to 30 min. 5. Cook root vegetables (last add) no more than 2 hrs. 6. Serve the pot roast on a bed of buckwheat groats (Kasha). It's an EXCELLENT compliment. Prepare the groats in gray and beef broth.

I used 2, 2 1/2 pound chuck roasts as is - did not tie. I did not have parsnips or celery root, so I used potatoes and 4 celery stalks. I roasted for a total of about 4 hours, then kept it on low on the stove for another hour until we were ready to eat. Everyone raved. I thought it was absolutely out-of-this-world! The beef was so tender and so tasty. I added much more chicken broth...at least 2 cups. When I make it again, I will definitely add double the carrots and celery, and even more broth, perhaps some beef broth. I would also like to try the parsnips, but the potatoes were wonderful. Leftovers are yummy too!

I've tried many pot roast recipes and this is by far the best one. I had only 3 shallots and two pieces of bacon, added no water during cooking, a 3+ lb (not 4lb) chuck roast and more fresh thyme than called for - threw a bunch of it in on the stalk. I'm not sure but it seems like the rub is the key - really special. Who is this guy Bruce Aidells? He's good!

Fantastic recipe. Increased chicken broth to 1 cup, increased carrots and parsnips, and added small red potatoes cut in half. Would definitely go with a large celery root, or 2 small next time. Cooked about 4 hours, and the meat was tender and delicious. Served with rice and the vegetables from the pot - this meal was a big hit!

i had never made a pot roast before, and was a little nervous, but this turned out so well that my husband said "no reason to ever look for another recipe". byw: the piece of meat i had was a bottom round, not a chuck roast, which was the reason i was nervous. not knowing much about cuts of meat, i didn't know how it would substitute, but it was great.

Excellent dish and rather easy to prepare. It's only difficult in terms of dedicating a nice chunk of time to it, but it's perfect for a Sunday dinner. I made a smaller version of the recipe since I was using a 2 lb Buffalo chuck roast, but it still turned out great. I was very liberal with adding more chicken broth. I think the Buffalo was even better than using beef because I think the flavor complements the flavors from the root vegetables even better than beef. The next time I make it I will try beef (mainly because it's cheaper than Buffalo) and I'll try out using beef broth instead of chicken.

I also did this one in the slow cooker, and it was marvelous. I used beef stock instead of chicken, and I added some more so that I could have more gravy. I also thickened the gravy before serving. Everyone devoured it!

Great flavor! Made a few changes. I found the beef to not be as tender as I like so bumped up total cooking time to 4 hours. Also, before adding the veggies, I took my immersion blender to the onion, garlic, liquid mixture for smoother texture (also to hide the onions from the kids).

A hearty and filling winter dish! I made this in my slow cooker. I put the vegetables in the bottom of the pot, sprinkled the bacon and bay leaves on top, then added the the browned pot roast (it's important to brown the pot roast to get that carmelization that is so very important), then deglazed the pan with the wine, reduced the wine, and added it, along with the chicken broth, to the pot. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate.) I then left it alone to cook in the slow cooker for about 7-8 hours on low heat. The result was tender, flavorful beef and a heavenly scent throughout the house! FYI, for the vegetables I replaced the shallots with pearl onions, only one large onion instead of two (because of the pearl onions), celery root, rutabaga, parsnips and white creamer new potatoes. That's the beauty of this recipe-you can mix and match according to what's available in the store, or according to your mood!

Yummy! This had amazing flavor and was very rich. I might try cutting back on the bacon a bit when I make it again. The only change that I made was to add some small new potatos, halved. Tomatoes were a nice addition when I re- heated the leftovers. This recipe is a keeper.

Great recipe...but I made some substitutions. Namely port for wine (gives it a sweeter punch), pork jowel bacon (fattier and therefore tastier), leeks for shallots, turnips for and parsnips. In other words I used the base ingredients for the roast and embellished on the accompanying ingredients...and it's a very easy thing to do here.

To kavitab from London, England... I am a Londoner living in Texas. Next time you make this, try using "braising steak" or "blade" (both cuts from the shoulder). Chuck roast comes from the shoulder of the cow; "silverside" is a very lean cut of beef usually used for dry roasting. It is part of the cow's posterior! I'm afraid your British butcher gave you a bum steer, pun intended! Though in his defense, it is not always easy figuring out what the equivalent cut is in Britain, and vice versa.

This was my first pot roast and it was great! I made it on Sunday night for dinner, and then enjoyed leftovers for the next two days.

I left out the Brown sugar & added 8oz of tomato Paste I also used 1c of Shiraz Wine & threw in a Rudabaga & Some Redskin Spuds. Along with most of you I also used a crock-pot. This dish is soo Simple my Sisters 8 month old son could make it. A Good solid Meat & Potatoes Winter De-Light

I love pot roast, but with our warm weather (sorry) I don't get to make them often. I'm glad this recipe paid off, thank you Bruce! The rub was a great idea. I didn't have celery root, so I used (3)celery stalk and cut them the same size as carrots and parsnips, also used Pancetta, an excellent substitute for American Bacon. The left overs were fanatic too!

Like Mr37 from Atlanta, I made it in a crock pot for a winter night dinner party of 8. It was a hit and would make again.

Fantastic even without all the extra delicious things (shallots, parsnips), the rub is truly excellent. Actually used a venison roast and am trying elk next!

Yummy! A nice change from our usual pot roast. More flavorful and not terribly difficult to make.

This was the most flavorful pot roast I have had in years. I served it with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes blended with a bit of sour cream and horseradish - a great accompaniment to the earthy flavors in the pot roast!

This was fantastic. Made it alongside some Yukon Gold potatoes with Fontina cheese and scored big points with my husband! Meat turned out really tender and I like how the onions, garlic and bacon cooked together into a tasty sauce/accompaniement.

Thiswas my first Pot roast so I asked the butcher (we live in london, U.K.) for the right cut and he recommended the silverside, it ended up being very dry.I did follow the recipe adding 2 cups of water to it. The flavour is immense though we doubled up on the veggies since we love them all. I would make sure that the roast is always topped up with liquid next time,since there will definitely be a next time!!

This recipe is great, but the photo is disturbing.

Wow. I had to make this the day the magazine arrived. The taste is fantastic, and unlike so many of my pot roasts, this one was not dry. A definite keeper.

that IS an awful picture, but I am going to cook this anyway...maybe their art director had the day off.

I loved the flavor of this recipe. The parsnips really add a great taste/smell. I did it in a crock pot since I did not have a large roasting pan. I would definately do this again!

Maybe if they would took the shot a little wider , it would look better.

I'm not rating this because i haven't tried the recipe yet. But does anyone else find the accompanying picture as UNappetizing as i do? The picture is full page in the magazine, too.
