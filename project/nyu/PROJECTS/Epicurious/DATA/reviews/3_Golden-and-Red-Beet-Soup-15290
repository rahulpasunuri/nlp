I pretty much followed the recipe and thought the soup was very tasty. The color effect of mixing the two batches was less spectacular than I had hoped but the flavor was excellent and enjoyed by the whole family. The soup was creamy but with a nice beet flavor.

I had both yellow and red beets piling up in my refrigerator from my CSA, and was looking for something other than borscht or a salad. I made the recipe with the following modifications: I used chicken broth instead of water and splashed in some Madeira for a few minutes before adding the broth. I cooked the beets longer than 40 minutes, probably closer to 1 hour. I used sour cream because I didn't have any creme fraiche, but I did use fresh dill. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, and husband and kids all enjoyed it.

I've made this recipe a million times and got raves, but couldn't find golden beets, so I used carrots instead. beautiful color match.

I loved this recipe. I also love beets (-: I have made it twice now using only golden beets, both time for guests who all raved and wanted the recipe. The dill and creme fraiche are needed to finish it off properly. I plan to do it as written one of these days with red and golden beets. I'm sure that would be a huge hit. Probably 4 forks.

It was great! They didn't have golden beets, so I was forced to use just red ones. I recomend using only 1 cup of milk and adding one cup of chicken or veggi broth, because the white milk with the red of the beets, gave the soup a "funky" fuchia color. WARNING - YOU MUST LIKE BEETS IN ORDER TO LIKE THIS SOUP! (sorry San Diego - I couldn't resist)

Foul, foul, foul. Unless, of course, you REALLY like beets.
