Super quick + easy emergency hors d'oeuvre! The garlic and smoked paprika toasts are a really nice match for the melted brie. I didn't even have time to go to the cheese shop for a real brie, just bought a supermarket brand in a cardboard box. Worried about the cheese leaking through, I covered the inside and outside of the cardboard with foil before returning the cheese. Probably unnecessary to do this, as the cheese rind held everything together very well and the oven temp probably isn't high enough to burn the cardboard inside of 20 minutes.

Actually, a surprisingly delicate flavor. I would not suggest substitution of Pimenton with Paprika, the smoky flavor is what makes is an elegant taste.
