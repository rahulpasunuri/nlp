Considering how simple this recipe was for a curry, I'm very pleased with its complex and delicious flavor. I am used to making Indian curries that are much more time consuming and sometimes not nearly as tasty. I highly recommend this one. The tamarind mixed with the freshly ground cumin and chili is just wonderful.

I followed the recipe, but used garam masala in place of the panch phorom. Since we didn't have naan, I spooned the curry into warmed fat home-made tortillas from the local Mexican bakery. It was just delicious!!

Instead of serving over rice, you can eat this with chapatti or naan breads. Just as tasty!

For the cook from Oakland, you can use dry red Kashmiri chile.

Adding one teaspoon of sugar improves the flavour considerably. I served it garnished with chopped cilantro, which was a nice contrast to the rich brown of the gravy.

I'd love to make this recipe since it has ingredients I love, but what kind of red chile are we supposed to add? Could anyone help? From my cooking experience, the type of chile used makes the dish, and I've no idea with this meal.

panch phoron = panch pharon = panchphoran = five spice Notes: This is a Bengali spice mix that combines aniseed, cumin, fenugreek, mustard and nigella. Don't confuse it with Chinese five spice powder, which is completely different. Substitutes: garam masala OR curry powder

Question: Is there a substitute more accessible for the Bengali spice mix? What does it taste of?
