I have been making this recipe since it was published in 2000. My family won't consider any other recipe.

My family has demanded this stuffing every year since I first made it in 2000. I discovered you can cut WAAAYYY back on the butter. I only use 4T to saute vegs and it is still great. I like it with the pkgd stuffing, with all fresh, or a mixture of both. Great with any Mexican meal.

This was ok, but I liked the "Southwest Corn Bread Stuffing with Corn and Green Chilies" much, MUCH better!!!!! Maybe I'd make this again as a potluck item one day as a side..Some people liked it (with the "Southwest Corn bread stuffing" recipe, *EVERYBODY* loved it!!!).

I found this dish to be only so-so. I made it to take to my in-laws Thanksgiving in the Texas Hill Country, thinking it would fit with the locale. However, despite all the poblanos, it was a little bland, no heat to speak of. I think I would have liked it a little better if there was a mix of cornbread and regular bread.

This was great - close enough to "traditional" stuffing but still unique. I made it as directed, except I substituted homemade vegetable stock for the chicken broth to make it vegetarian. It was delicious - try it! I also made the Chipotle Gravy from the "Citrus Glazed Turkey with Chipotle Gravy" recipe on this website. I used the same homemade veggie broth for the gravy instead of pan drippings/chicken broth. It complemented the dressing nicely. At our dinner, there was traditional turkey gravy and stuffing too, and several people passed those up in favor of mine (or at least tried both)! I will definitely keep this recipe!

I made this dressing to perk up a (very) traditional Thanksgiving spread, and three years later my family still insists on having poblano dressing. Just spicy enough and the crunchy pumpkin seeds give the dish great texture.

Absolutely fantastic! Served it at two large thanksgivings and received so many rave reviews. Fantastic do-ahead recipe as well.

Wonderful, again. This is the 3rd time I've made it. If you have trouble finding poblanos, pasilla chiles are a great substitute.

I made this last year and it was a hit! I also made the chesnut dressing listed on this site in case this was was too spicy for people and everyone preferred this one.

I started making this stuffing with the CITRUS-GLAZED TURKEY WITH CHIPOTLE GRAVY in November 2001. I have made it at least once a year since and it is an absolute hit everytime. I am not a cook by any means, and these two dishes always pleasently surprise and please my family and friends.

This stuffing is SO good, and my Thanksgiving guests would agree. I think I've hit on a new tradition. I recommend baking a homemade cornbread (8x8 pan) and letting it sit out for a few days for this recipe.

I added a pound of chorizo to this recipe, which I think made it better (and more spicy). It was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner.

careful with poblano chiles they can be quite hot. My stuffing tended to be too hot for some guests. I would use less poblano, maybe add a milder chile like anaheim.

Wonderful, flavorful way to add a little pizzazz to the ordinary stuffing. Will definitely make it again next year!

This stuffing was good, with a strong, unique flavor that reminded people of peanut butter, strangely enough. Because of the strong flavor i only wanted to eat a small amount of this at a time, but did still enjoy it and found it easy enough to make.

My guests couldn't get enough and HAD to have the recipe. Can't wait for the holidays to roll around again!

This was probably the best stuffing I have ever made. I did cut back on the poblanos because mine were really hot. The stuffing came out perfect just the right amount of heat, the crunch of the pumpkin seeds made for a nice texture .

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was the best dressing I have ever had by far. I used day-old cornbread instead of bagged crumbs, and it was moist and delicious.

I've now made this recipe for two Thanksgiving holiday dinners. Each time, I get requests for the recipe. I real hit.

I served this with the Achiote Butter-Basted Turkey on this site and it was delicious. If you don't make this stuffing (I didn't put it in the turkey) be sure to try the achiote turkey it's incredible.

This was a very good stuffing.I wasn't able to find poblano chiles so i used pasillas chile. I made it the day before Thanksgiving. In the morning I added 1 more cup of chicken stock to make it moist. I then baked it a room temp. Happy Holidays!!!
