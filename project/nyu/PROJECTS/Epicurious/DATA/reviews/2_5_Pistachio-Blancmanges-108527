This dish was okay. I didn't really love it, but not hate it. But I can say this much! There are many better pistachio flavorings in this large world that God created for us!

I modified it to intensify teh nutty flavor ... the substitute for gelatin is agar ... found in Asian food sources ... it is made of sea weed instead of collagen. Works great for jello squares, too ...

Can this recipe be made without Gelatin? or does anyone know of a substitute for Gelating? I really want to make this dessert. Thanks.

Yes, to the new/recent cook. I should think muslin or cheesecloth would equate with a kitchen towel. I'm thinking about making this for dinner tonight.

Question about recipe. Please don't criticize me for asking a question I am an average cook - not a gourmand chef, (although I do like to try different recipes) and I do need help sometimes. I can't rate yet because I haven't made this, but I have a question for other reviewers/cooks who have.. Will cheese-cloth or muslin do as a substitute for the kitchen towel?
