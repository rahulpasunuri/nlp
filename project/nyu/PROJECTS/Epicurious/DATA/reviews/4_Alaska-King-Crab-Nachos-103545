Took these to a Father's Day dinner and everyone loved them. I made everything ahead and quickly assembled them before rushing out the door. I served it with a small dish of sriracha and mayo mixture for additional heat. Some of the kids even tried it with a drop or two of the mixture and loved it. I used backfin blue crab. This is a keeper!!!

I thought these were a bit large, too big for one bit appetizers. I added garlic, more wasabi, some Sriracha sauce in the guac and some minced tomatoes. When all assembled it still "needed" something. You can taste all the flavors but somehow it just fell a bit flat. I tried more Sriracha sauce with a bit of mayo and lime juice mixture to dallop on top. I made the won ton cups the night before and they were a bit crunchy and fell apart when bit even though I cooked them as instructed.

I tried taking the short cut of using pasteurized king crab meat and found it very fishy tasting. Next time I would use fresh shrimp, it would be much better tasting and less expensive. Love the won ton cups, will use them for other stuffings..

This was the perfect appetizer for Thanksgiving - not too much work, not to heavy and everyone loved it. Followed other suggestions with garnish and addition mayo/serachi sauce. Looked good and tasted good. Will make it again soon.

Great fun recipe... however RESIST the temptation of using LUMP CRAB! I did due to the ease factor but was let down. The more fishy taste of the lump crab versus the more sweet of the snow crab makes a drastic difference. Hated with the lump, loved and devoured with the snow crab!!

A secret to tamping down the wrappers is to use a clean wine cork....works well and is faster than using your fingers. Fun, tasty recipe that I will be using again.

These are phenomenal. Everyone always loves them and I get multiple requests for the recipe whenever I make them. You can't go wrong.

These "nachos" are guaranteed to disappear at your next party! Every time I make these I am asked for the recipe. I use Dungeness crab because it is more readily available in our area. Also, to make this dish more cost effective, try substituting bay shrimp for the crab. By the way, the wonton shells really do keep for a day or two if stored in Tupperware.

I doubled the avocado filling but kept the amount of crab the same, and I was still able to make about 35 of these little guys. I put a cilantro leaf in the bottom of each wonton cup to help prevent them from getting soggy as they sat out, and that seemed to work like a charm. (I put a leaf on top of each one, too.) They were delicious and I will definitely, definitely be making them again.

I also increased the wasabi and added some chopped red pepper and cilantro to the avocado. I put one leaf of cilantro on top of each crab piece and drizzled a little bit of sriracha on the whole thing -- very striking. I loved this recipe.

I've made this several times--from bridal and baby showers to couple's coctail parties--and each time it is a hit! I usually substitue Dungeness crabmeat for the King crab. It's a little bit sweeter and a lot more decadent!

This always flies off the plate! I make a few changes, though. Add more wasabi, garlic and more avocado. In keeping with an Asian flair, I cut the wontons with a 3" round pastry cutter and use seame seed oil, which adds a wonderful flavor. I do not use the lime juice on the crab. Instead I mix Sriracha sauce with a bit of mayo and squirt just a dab on the top after assembly. Makes a wonderful presentation and does not seem to overwhelm the crab. Am always asked for the recipe!

This is such a great recipe! The guacamole itself is very good on its own to begin with, and pairing it with crab is a great idea. I couldn't find won ton wrappers, so I toasted some pita wedges in oven instead. Turned out great.

Given the reviews, I expected something more flavorful. I added garlic and cilantro and still thought it was only OK. The won ton cups are a nice presentation but they are a little too much for one bite and awkward to eat in two bites. Guests at my cooking exchange all agreed that these were fine but not worth making again. I have made other recipes with most of the same ingredients that tasted as good or better.

I served this as an appetizer on Christmas and everyone loved it but my husband. He thought the guacomoli over powered the king crab. Next time I make it I may try a less expensive crab such as snow.

I made this dish for our supper club and it was a huge hit. I used fresh Alaskan King Crab and I think it really made the dish. It was quite easy to prepare ahead of time (I put all the elements together right before we left and it took about 5 minutes)

Extremely yummy! It's also very easy and can be prepared ahead of time: It's only a matter of baking the won ton shells and filling them with guacamole and crab. The most labor-intensive part of the process was removing the crab meat from their shells; to save time one could use imitation crab meat, which comes cooked and ready for use. Try other toppings with the won tons and guacamole: baby shrimp, shredded beef, or some matchstick carrots. Like the previous reviewer, I would also add more wasabi (I used 1.5 tablespoons). This is a FANTASTIC recipe!

A huge hit - common response "I'm doing these for my gourmet club!" Looked great on a stark white Asian platter. I had to use spring roll wrappers trimmed to size. They wouldn't press into bottom/sides of the muffin tins so had to use dried beans as pastry weights during cooking process. Added quite a bit of time unexpectedly to the prep time. I would add another small avocado and experiment with using a little more wasabi.

This was such an easy appetizer to make, and the little cups were really cool. Loved the wasabi flavor in the avocado allthough I had to use about double.

I loved this recipe. At first I thought I had a flop on my hands while I was making it and I didn't think there was enough guac. But after putting it all together they were very tasty and a hit and there was plenty of guac. I'm making them again

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I plan to use the won ton shell for other hors d'oeurves. One thing I learned: stick the avocado mixture in a pastry bag to make assembly time faster.

Be sure to use only the freshest crab meat available for this great appetizer. Even if you have to crack and shell the crabs yourself, it's worth it! I doubled the guacamole filling and upped the wasabi a little at a time. The contrast between the sweet, fresh dungeness crab (a local San Francisco delicacy this time of year) and the fresh avocado with a little kick was a sensation on Christmas eve. Oh - and use a pastry bag with a large, open tip to fill the cups with the guacamole - much faster and neater, too!

These were wonderful!!! I used Jumbo Lump crabmeat instead of King Crab. I also did use more wasabi because you couldn't even taste it in the guacamole with only 3/4 tsp. I should have doubled the recipe....they went REALLY fast! Will definately make again.

I made 48 of these for a party and not one was left over. I double the guacamole portion and it was perfect. Took advice from others and increased the amount of wasabi and I also added fresh, finely chopped, garlic. Great presentation and a big hit!!

I first made these when the recipe was in Gourmet and have been asked to make them several times since. I made two batches the first time. One as shown and the other with twice the wasabi. The extra wasabi batch won hands down.

I made these as an appetizer for a Mother's Day dinner. They looked pretty and tasted great! I'll definitely make them again.

Very tasty and impressive in appearance. I made twelve of these for four persons. Doubled the avocado's and increased the wasabi to 1 tsp., I steamed the crab leg in beer and garlic. I filled the won tons about 30 minutes prior to serving and they weren't soggy on the bottom. I filled them 2/3 full. They're great with a chardonnay.

The won ton wrappers are so easy and perfect for all types of fillings! I also bumped up the wasabi knowing my guests tastes. I will make these again.

Was very disappointed by these! They were pretty but just "average" tasting, nothing special. Added more wasabi to the guac which helped, but these did not disappear quickly as anticipated. Will make the won ton cups again, however, as they have great potential for other more flavorful fillings.

I gave this '4 forks' because of the presentation as well as the flavor. Great appetizer for entertaining! I suggest making more of the filling mixture or a really large avocado. I only had enough for a little dab in each cup. Also, more wasabi please!

I JUST DID THIS FOR OUR ANNUAL NEW YEAR'S EVE SLEEPOVER WITH FRIENDS. IT WAS A HUGE HIT. I KICKED UP THE WASABI TO ALMOST 1 3/4 TEASPOONS BECAUSE WE LIKE IT SPICY. AND I DIDN'T THINK THE CRAB LEG NEEDED ANY SALT, JUST THE FRESH LIME JUICE. WE'LL DO THESE AGAIN IN A MINUTE.

Well, believe it or not, I couldn't find Won Ton Wrappers. I used pre-baked puff pastry shells [thaw and serve]. I made the guac ahead of time, and then assembled the hors d'oeuvres right before serving. If I was making these for a few friends, I would have added more wasabi, but the larger group warranted I use what the recipe called for. I also used roasted garlic in place of the shallots, and don't forget to season the guac with salt and pepper. Use real king crab. The contrast of the red and white crab with the green guac is very attractive. Excellent nibble.

Made the recipe for an office party. Everyone really liked it. I think it's important not to let the wonton cups bake beyond lightly golden brown or they are too crunchy to easily eat in a bite or two. Also, important to have fresh crab otherwise they are too fishy smelling/tasting. Experiment with putting other things in the wonton cups. You can make your own creations in those cups whether savory or dessert (like brushing chocolate inside the cups and adding a custard filling with a raspberry on each).

Beautiful presentation. Second time we made them, we used rock shrimp for half, crab for half and thin-sliced lime segments to garnish. These disappear quickly!

I made this for a party, but changed it from an asian syle to mexican. Instead of using crab, I made each bite into a little 5 layer dip. I put a few black beans in the bottom of each cup, then some shredded cheese, followed by the guacamole, and topped it off with some sour cream and a small piece of tomato. I made the cups a night before and found that using just 1 wonton per cup was plenty, and I assembled the rest just before my guests arrived. Everyone loved them!! I will definately make them again.

This was good tasting and nice looking. I added much more wasabi than called for.

I recently made these and they were a hit. I also put cilantro in with the avacado! The trick is to make them right before your guests arrive as the longer they sit they begin to get a bit soggy. They were the star of the show....and everyone wanted the recipe.

We made these for 8 guests. We made the cups the night before the party, the guacamole a few hours before, and assembled them as the guests arrived. Incredibly simple but very impressive-looking. Everyone loved them, especially the hint of wasabi in the guac. They said it reminded them of sushi (which is a good thing!). Highly recommended for a stunning presentation and delicious starter.
