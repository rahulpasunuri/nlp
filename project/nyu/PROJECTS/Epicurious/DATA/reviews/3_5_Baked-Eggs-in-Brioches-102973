Always a great brunch dish. Never fails to satisfy me or my husband. I usually top off the eggs with just a drop or two of milk before baking to keep from over cooking. When out of fresh herbs I sprinkle grated Parmesan instead.

Good but not worth a repeat. The brioche I found were only about 3" in diameter and it took forever for the eggs to cook so I put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes. All in all, though, not a lot of flavor or anything to make this interesting or special, well maybe the presentation. I looked all over for brioche. Trader joes in Orange County, CA does not carry it. I finally called and found it at Whole Foods.

This was very nice and makes an impressive dish for entertaining. I overcooked the yolks (I wanted them runny), even though I only cooked them for 10 minutes following the addition of the tops--so be sure to watch this. Also, it was impossible to find individual brioches (how frustrating!), so I used individual challah rolls, which I found at Trader Joe's.

Yum! This was perfect with other suggested "Mother's Day" foods: Home Fries with Onions & Chives, Grand Fruit Salad, and Banana-Macadamia Nut Muffins. Found the brioche at Trader Joe's. Will definately make again!

Placing a thin slice of smoked ham under each egg inside the brioche was a HUGE hit! I also sprinkled a bit of parmesan on the eggs (fresh parmesan) and let it bake on top of them... it also went nicely with the brioche... and our tummies!

I had been searching for brioches for a couple of years. Once I finally found them (@Trader Joe's in Batavia), I was anxious to finally make these eggs. VERY good (may be partially attributable to the 25g of fat in each brioche). I most certainly will make these again. Yummy!!!

This is a lovely dish. The buttery richness of the brioches is wonderful with the herbed eggs. I made it Xmas morning for my family and they loved dipping the tops into the eggs. Be careful not to overcook the eÁ..
