Not spectacular but easy and fast to make and adaptable. Can be tweaked in many ways. For example, I added about 1 cup artichoke hearts, 1 teaspoon of paprika, about 1/8 cup water and about 3/8th cup of oil. Fresh ground pepper and generous with the salt (about 1 1/2 tbl). Very nice! I imagine I can roast red peppers and blend them with an herb - maybe marjoram - for another version. Roasted garlic is another way to go as is caramelized onions. I'll go to this again and adapt it according to what I have left over.

I used 1/2 the amount of olive oil & some of the cooking liquid to reduce fat content. Added a clove of garlic, some chopped flat-leaf parsley & sprinkled smoked hot paprika on top. Served with thin sliced Italian bread & raw veggies. I think the number of servings given is off, for a snack or hors d'oeuvre, especially if used as a condiment "instead of butter" as stated in notes prior to the recipe. I'd make this again, with modifications. If using it as a dip, I'd reduce the olive oil even farther, using very good oil & just enough for flavor & enhanced mouthfeel.

This was simple and filling. Nothing special

This is a staple recipe of mine. Add more s&p or garlic or sage - whatever you want. Season it so that you like it - most of the time my guests love it as is.

This is nothing special -- indeed, it's so bland (even after doubling the garlic and sage and being heavy-handed with the salt and pepper) that it needed a shot of cayenne pepper to make it presentable. I won't be making this one again.

Good stuff and generated requests for the recipe from more than one food snob. I added another garlic clove, an additional teaspoon sage and fresh ground pepper. Also used the canned beans (3 15-oz cans, drained and rinsed). Thanks, Houston, the food processor made this a breeze.

I used canned beans and a food processor. Easy to make and great reviews from guests. For presentation I topped with seeded, chopped tomatoes and served with pita chips.

To the previous reviewer: 1 cup of olive oil is 320g of fat, which makes 53g of fat per serving for this dip. This recipe doesn't claim to be and isn't anything close to low fat.

This was a mellow and delicious lowfat recipe. The sage hits just the right note. I know, it's a lot of olive oil, but it works.
