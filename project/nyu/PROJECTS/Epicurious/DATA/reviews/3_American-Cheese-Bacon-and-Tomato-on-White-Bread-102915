a cook from PA says This is a perked up version of a grilled cheese sandwich. Who needs a grill? Use a fry pan and serve with tomato soup. Yummm!

American Cheese is cheese slices in plastic wrapping al a Kraft. I'm sorry, I mean none of you any disrespect, but how big of a dork do you have to be to need a recipe for a cheese sandwich?

I've often wondered what "American cheese" is. Could anybody enlighten me?

Really yummy, but no big deal. I like using good crusty bread and meunster cheese (makes it creamier). Great with soup on a rainy night.

Never a fan of cheese on sandwiches, I've never made a grilled cheese one until this one tonite...and it wasn't bad at all. Low energy, like me, and no special shopping, and it hit the spot. Give it a shot.

A simple sandwich but delicious even so. I add a little bit of mayo and some freshly ground black pepper before grilling.

I've been eating and making this recipe for years ever since I was a little kid, my mother always made them, and we called them "Montauks". We toasted the bread slightly, and put the cheese, then tomato and partially cooked bacon on and then a small dollop of mayo and into the broiler until the cheese melted and just barely started to turn brown (if we were lucky and didn't burn them!)

A variation on this tried and true recipe is using Colby cheese or a cmobo of two cheeses. Using unsalted butter works as well for those concerned about salt. When adding tomato soup, cream it with milk or cream and chop up garden fresh tomatoes when in season. Yum!

Only instead of American cheese, the only way to go is Oregons famed Tillamok extra sharp cheddar. And west coast sourdough bread. Otherwise O.K.

My disclaimer: I'm a mediocre cook at best. However,I have found that the grill being hawked on TV under the aegis of the ex-boxer, G.F., makes very good grilled sandwiches. No added fat necessary and you can't go wrong.Our personal favorite is feta and tomato on Greek bread.

Kat... Don't be so critical. This comfort food.. In a world of hummus and lattes, sometimes people need to be REMINDED of the basics.

This is a very popular sandwich served in almost every restaurant, coffee shop, etc., I have ever been in! An American Institution! Any bread will do and I put mayo instead of butter. Love it!!!OOPS, I meant the mayo inside, not out!!!

This is a recipe? I don't come to Epicurious to find food a 5 year old can make.

A wonderfully tasty and refreshing sandwich. My only change might be the bread. I'm not a fan of white bread, but I can see this same combination on a good sourdough bread.The grilling time might be a little longer. I served it with a nice green garden salad and fresh fruit. It was delightful.

This is one of the best sandwiches from my childhood. It also works well when you toast the bread and put the open-face sandwich under the broiler to melt the cheese.

This is true comfort food. Skip the bacon and add oregano. It is also good on rye.
