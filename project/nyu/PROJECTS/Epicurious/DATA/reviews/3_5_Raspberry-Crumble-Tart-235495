The first time I made this recipe it turned out awesome. I have made it several times since using different berry combinations. In fact, I'm about the make a raspberry and blueberry crumble tart this morning. I think I might try using hazel nuts this time. Thanks for that tip.

I made this in a 10-inch spring form pan and used my usual Williams-Sonoma pastry crust recipe, adding in the nuts to two cups of the dough for the topping. This turned out fabulously well! There were 7 of us at dinner and we ended up with only a small wedge left over by the end of the evening. This tart serves up well with whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream. I will make this every summer, it is delightfully tangy with just enough sweetness from the crumble topping.

Very good though yes, though a little tart for my taste. Next time I will sprinkle a little sugar over the strawberries. In the end we poured a touch of cream over each serving and it was fine.

This is an amazing way to use summer fruit. I've made it several times with different fruit combos (raspberry-blueberry, peach-blueberry), always with delicious results. I use brown sugar instead of white in the topping, and hazelnuts are a great substitution.

This is great. I do not agree at all with the commenters who think the berries need sugar. In fact, I cut down on the sugar in the topping. The cake is about the contrast between the tart berries and the sweet topping. I also used hazelnuts instead of almonds.

I made this recipe substituting toasted hazelnuts for the almonds, and threw in a handful of blueberries for color.. I surprised even myself with how good it tasted. Your guests won't have to know how easy it is to make; mine raved.

I wish that I had read the reviews before making this tart, I would have added the needed additional sugar to the berries. I felt it lacked something. If I make it again I will add sugar to the berries and maybe coconut to the topping.

This was a delicious tart, and very easy if you use a food processor for the crust. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a few tablespoons of sugar to the berries and to the dough recipe. I wanted to have a mixture of berries, so I used half raspberries and divided the other half between blueberries and blackberries. I served with Dreyer's light french vanilla ice cream and received rave reviews.

Terrific dessert, loved by everyone at a recent family gathering. I didn't feel there was a need for adding more sugar at all--it was refreshingly tart, with just a hint of sweetness from the topping. I didn't have enough sugar when I looked in the pantry, and so used about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to supplement what I had, which worked well, sicne I enjoy brown sugar in crumb toppings anyway. Make this for your friends--they won't be disappointed! This one's going into the permanent file!

This was worth the effort. I found the pastry dough a but difficult to work with but it came out great. I added sugar to the fresh raspberries I bought. I didn't use all the left over crumb toppingm just a handful or so. It is even better then next day!

Delicious filling - I did sprinkle in a little sugar as my raspberries weren't that sweet. The crust was light and flaky - and the crumble topping was a perfect accompaniment. Not too rich and a very tasty end to a delicious meal.

This was good, although not the greatest thing I've ever made, even with farm fresh raspberries. They could have used a little sugar. Still, it was easy and quick.

Absolutely beautiful and even more delicious! Bought very sweet raspberries from the farmers market but next time I'm definitely adding a bit of sugar. The crust was perfect. Flaky AND tender (and pie crusts are the bane of my existence). Have to make another before the season's over!

Simple and delicious. Raspberries have been great this summer, so I didn't feel the need to add any extra sugar to the berries as others had mentioned.

DELICIOUS .. definitely a keeper! Im not sure if the tartness for those who have tried this recipes is due to this or not, but ... I did notice when I picked the fresh raspberries this year they didnt have the same sweetness as usual .. so check your raspberries first and decide for yourself on the extra sugar.. as always, recipes are made to be adjusted according to taste :) Enjoy!

Everything about this dish was delicious! The crust was flaky and soft, the raspberries (with the addition of a couple tablespoons of sugar) became gooey and thick and delicious and the crunch of the almonds in the crumble were the perfect end. Definitely a hit!

I also picked fresh local raspberries and mine were on the tart side as well. They often vary in sweetness and I thought that the filling needed more sugar. The tart crust came together beautifully and rolled out perfect (I used an 11" round tart pan) but a little sugar in the dough would have helped sweeten the crumble as well. The whole house smelled wonderful while this was baking and it was picture perfect. I will make it again but with some additional sugar added.

I made this recipe yesterday with fresh raspberries picked from a friend's garden. The raspberries themselves weren't particularly sour to begin with, but I think this recipe could have used a couple tablespoons of sugar mixed into the berries before adding to the crust. If I can score another batch of berries, I'll try this recipe again with the added sugar. The streusel topping is very tasty.
