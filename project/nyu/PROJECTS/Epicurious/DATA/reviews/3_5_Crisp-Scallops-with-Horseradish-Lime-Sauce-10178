Made these for my husband (seafood fanatic) Loved them! The sauce is good enough to eat on cardboard! Great recipe easy and quick.

I noticed that some reviewers were not huge fans of the way the scallops themselves were prepared, and I was a little skeptical of the graham crackers, so I just obeyed the advice that Alton Brown gave and pan-seared the scallops (he claims this is the only way to eat a scallop). I dusted them with paprika, salt, and pepper, dredged them in flour, and seared them in olive oil, then served them with this sauce and roasted potatoes. The sauce was AMAZING. Don't change a thing. One of my new favourite scallop recipes, especially because of the easiness of the sauce. Good for a weeknight.

This was not even worth one fork. Yuck. It came out beautifully - the frying, the texture of the scallops, etc.; however, I just did not like the taste combinations. My husband agreed. Had to make a substitute dinner. It was that bad.

First of all, the trouble factor on this dish was high. Too much effort for very little reward. I thought the deep-frying made the scallops taste mundane. The sauce, which I thought sounded interesting when I found the recipe, turned out to taste too lime-y. Perhaps this was just because I prepared the sauce a few hours ahead of time. HO-HUM!

Based on other reviews, I made these for a Riesling wine tasting for 8. Crushed crackers to about three times the size of commercial bread crumbs; used IQF (individually quick frozen, but thawed) scallops sized 10-20/lb. Deep fried them (360F) for 2 minutes in batches of 8, then finished/held them in a 350F oven for 1-2 minutes before serving. The sauce is excellent, but I would use more horseradish next time (some prepared horseradish is really bitter - find one you like). A 'keeper' - crispy but juicy, sweet scallops - my guests thought them excellent!

I thought the graham cracker crust would b sweet, but it was not. I'd add more lime zest and lime joice to the sauce next time.

I used this dish as a main dish instead of an appetizer, useing 5 scallops per serving we found that this was a few to many 3 scallops might have been better. The only other change I made was to double the quantity of sauce. While reading this recipe to start with we were surprised by the grahm cracker breading & the lime we found it to be great even one guest who is not found of shellfish she ate it all. Thank you!

THE SAUCE FOR THIS DISH IS DELICIOUS, BUT I FOUND THE BREADING ON THE SCALLOPS TO BE TOO THIN, AND BROWN UP TOO EASILY SO IT WAS ONLY DUABLE IF I DIDN'T COOK THE SCALLOPS ALL THE WAY IN THE FRYER AND FINISHED THEM OFF IN THE OVEN, OTHERWISE DELICIOUS!
