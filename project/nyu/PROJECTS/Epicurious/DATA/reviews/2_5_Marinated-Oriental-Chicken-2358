With all the kick to the marinade, the chicken turned out surprisingly blah. I would recommend making a sauce, while the chicken is broiling - I just used the same ingredients in the marinade and added cornstarch to thicken. Served with some crispy veggies or tempura would make it better - the chicken needs something with texture.

I love this dish. I have made it many times. It is easy. I would recommend this dish to everyone.

I used a dry marsalla wine in place of sherry and marinated for about 10 hours. The results were delicious.

We doubled up on the recipe since we used two HUGE chicken breasts (4 HUGE halves). I thought the marinade needed a bit more soy-sauce, so I increased the soy to taste. My boyfriend (the real chef in the relationship) made a delicious tangy dressing, to compliment the chicken and jasmine rice, but mixing a reduction of balsamic vinegar (dark or white) with soy-sauce and chopped green-onion -- delicious! I think this recipe would also be delicious by spicing it up with red chili flakes, as well. Bon Apetite!

I found this recipe wasn't bad but not exceptional. It is a good every night recipe, something fast and easy. I wouldn't use it for a dinner party. There are other recipes to try before I come back to this one. It does, on the other hand, have a good base to experiment with. I would definately add lots of garlic, chili paste salt and pepper to start

I've made this several times. It's easy and has been good each time. I recommend reducing the marinade and using it as a sauce. It makes the dish.

Very good main dish. We grilled the chicken instead of broiling it. Very tasty with grilled veggies.
