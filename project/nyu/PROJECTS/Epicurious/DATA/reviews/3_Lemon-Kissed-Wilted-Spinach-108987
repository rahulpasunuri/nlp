loved this but I cut the oil down to about 2 T. To me 1/4 cup is way too much oil for cooked spinach. Delicious lemony flavor. I made sure to fish out all of the zest which was delicious.

This had just the right amount of lemon flavor!

This was very easy to make and a good complement to the garlic chicken that we made. I used regular spinach rather than curly. It is a definite repeat!
