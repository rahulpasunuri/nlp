This was excellent! I used a red Anjou pear and left the skin on for some added color.

Absolutely fabulous ! Only change I would make is less dressing....

This is a fabulous, easy recipe. I did cut the quantity of dressing for health reasons -- still delish! I added some cukes because I had them (the garden is going crazy), and would do it again.

This salad is OUTSTANDING! I have made this several times now and now my family and friends are also hooked on it. Don't skip the avocado! It adds a beautiful texture and flavor that marries well with the pears and gorgonzola. I've substituted goat cheese or Roquefort for the Gorgonzola when I didn't have any on hand and it's still marvelous. The dressing is also delicious and perfect for this salad. Take the time to make it, it'll make all the difference!

Fabulous combination. Made this for a quick summer dinner with grilled chicken breasts. The rice vinegar and lime juice make the dressing "sweet" without the sugar that was used to be the standard spinach dressing. Definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe! Since I am a novice cook I followed the recipe without adding anything. I love the idea of letting the red onions soak in the dressing before serving, will try that this time. Served at Christmas dinner and it was a hit. It is being requested at a family dinner tonight!

Important note - I made this salad again, but this time I accidentally used olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil, and it was not that great. I think everything else was the same!

This salad is awesome. I made pretty much as directed except for adding one clove of real garlic to the dressing instead of the garlic powder. Also I realized too late that I didn't have enough rice vinegar, so I supplemented with red wine vinegar and a little more lime juice, which worked well. After I made the dressing, I let the sliced onions sit in the dressing for awhile so that they wouldn't be so raw. Also, I used a Bartlett pear instead of an Anjou. This was such a good salad! I can't wait to make it again!

I read all the reviews and modified the recipe to fit what I thought sounded good and I had on hand. I used baby organic greens instead of spinach, deleted the avacado (not really needed) and sometimes add the onion or not. I used red D'Anjou pears without peeling them. They're beautiful in the fall and look great against the colorful salad mix. The right Gorgonzola is also important. Use an imported one that is creamier and not too biting. The dressing should be made with minced garlic and I use flat Italian parsley as I don't like uncooked cilantros' flavor. I toss the greens with the dressing and keep the pears separate until serving time. Place the dressed greens in a bowl, sprikle with the pears and onions and sprinkle with toasted pecans for a great starter salad course.

This was truly excellent and made a nice presentation. I placed slices of the pear and avocado on top of the spinach like a fan, topped with crumbled goat cheese and drizzled the dressing on top. Lovely to look at and great flavors!

Didn't have avocado. Still a great salad. Mixed leftover dressing & sliced red onion; pickled onion kept well in frig & was very good on salads, sandwiches & fruit salsas.

Yummy! This was a great salad, I couldn't stop eating it! As suggested by the other reviewers, I added the avocado and pear at the end only after tossing with the dressing and I also added some candied walnuts. I also made only half of the dressing as suggested by the other reviewers and found that it was plenty, I didn't really use all of it. I did add the full amount of lime and cilantro and I did about 2/3 vegetable oil and 1/3 extra virgin olive oil ratio for the oil part. Overall, it is an impressive looking salad and tastes great! Would certainly love to do this again soon for company.

This salad is amazing! I was going to a potluck birthday party and decided to bring this, and it was the only thing that was completely finished! I was concerned about the dressing, because at first there is no taste, but when it mixes with the salad its fabulous! I put the cheese on the side, which worked great. I definitely recommend this, its super easy and delicious and a major crowd pleaser.

I made this salad for my best friend. We sat outside in the wonderful spring air, and enjoyed this light, summer like salad. As others had suggested, I left off the avocado (I didn't need the extra fat, if it didn't make much flavor difference), but I did add grilled chicken strips, and it was sooo yummy. I will make this again, and again!

Thank you!!! This was a sensational salad (hence the 4 forks) we all simply adored! I'll be making it for varrious guests to dazzle their tastebuds.

Great recipe - used for huge Christmas party and used 5 x the amount of salad. Only needed to double the dressing for that amount. Kept the blue cheese on the side for those that don't care for it - everyone loved it. Tried it again at home with just a field greens mix, and wasn't quite the same -- need good fresh baby spinach to do the trick. Softening onions is a good technique (soaking in dressing or just in vinager) if onions you have are slightly harsh.

I have made this salad many times over the last couple of years and it is fantastic! The only change I make is to use fresh garlic- you really can taste the difference if you use powdered garlic.

The salad dressing is delicious, light, and easy to make. I added the pear and avocado last. You don't need the avocado, but if you love them in your salad, why not?

Very good and easy salad. Added pear and avacado after tossing with dressing. I don't think that the avacado is necessary. It gets lost in the flavors of everything else. Added dried cranberries and used feta instead of gorgonzola cheese. Decreased oil to 1/4 C. and increased vinegar to 1/2 C.

Still our favorite salad...the dressing makes much more than you need!...you only need a light coat on the lettuce ...add the pear & avacado last & serve...stick to it as written & you won't be disappointed:)

this was far and away the best salad that I have ever made. Following the advice of the other reviews, I added more vinegar and less oil and also used the toasted pecans and dried cranberries. It was awesome!

Another Epicurious hit! Used Cambezola instead and everyone loved it - probably a bit milder than gamb so it let the pear flavour stand out! YUM. One guest licked the salad bowl clean.

Rating: 4
Wow! Following some of the suggestions & adding a few twists of my own, this was fantastic. I used an Asian pear (my regular pear wasn't ripe enough). I used 1/3 cup oil: a fifty-fifty mixture of neutral oil and roasted walnut. I had only unseasoned rice vinegar but I cut that 50:50 again with some wonderful but pricy Alessi pear infused white balsamic vinegar. As recommended by other reviewers, I used fresh garlic over powder and a generous sprinkle of toasted nuts (pecans). I also briefly marinated my onion in rice wine vinegar (then drained & blotted dry), but that's because I get heartburn from the raw ones. Just thinking about it makes me want more & I haven't even had breakfast yet.

I will make this salad time and time again, believe me. It is so easy to make and so delicious. I thought I had my all time favorite salad, but this salad has me hooked. I added some toasted walnuts, but other than that, stuck with the recipe. If you're shy of onion slices, please don't think you can go without them on this salad. They are a must and delightfully add to the combination.

I already have plans to make this delicious salad again. Everyone who ate it the last time around still raves about it. I only used half the amount of dressing called for in this recipe and it was PLENTY. I rated it three forks but it would be four with the recommended recipe alterations.

I made this one for the Hollywood Bowl and all 12 people LOVED it. My brother doesn't like fruit in his salads so I substituted an heirloom tomato for the pear. It was great - and everyone loved the dressing on its own.

We love this salad. I make extra dressing as we think it needs it. Don't use over ripe pear or avacado, as it makes it too mushy. Very good salad.

Turned out great with extra dressing. Put fresh garlic and lots of rice vingar (otherwise taste too much oil). Also added extra everything and a tomato.

Oh so good! I had an Asian Pear on hand and it was an absolutely fantastic substitution. I omitted the cheese and it was just fine although I bet the extra pizzaz would be delicious (I'm on a detox diet currently - no cheese allowed) I highly recommend this one

Not as good as I expected, but didn't use the Gorgonzola. Maybe that would have made a difference. We love the Apple, Walnut, Dried Cherry salad on this site.

I have made this dish often, but I have never ever mixed/tossed it. I always fan out the pear and avocado on top of the bed of spinach. In fact, I think I'll make it again tonight.

Huh. I had such high expectations for this recipe, what with all the 4-fork ratings, but this salad just didn't do it for me. After just a few tosses, the avocado and pear turned the salad into a mushy and slimy mess. I also found the dressing to be too oily. I would swap the amount of vinegar and oil the next time. I would also give the salad some crunch by adding some nuts, maybe toasted pecans or pine nuts, and perhaps some chew and color with dried cranberries, as others have suggested. This salad wilted rapidly, and became ugly within 10 minutes of its first toss. If I were to make it again, I think I would thinly slice the pear and avocado and fan the slices out on top of the spinach, maybe mounding the cheeese in the middle. Definitely use a firmer pear and avocado. Maybe the ones I used were just too ripe . . .

My roommate has brought this salad to local legend status. Like all great recipes it has taken on the word "the" as it's defining value. It is now simply knows as THE salad, and we have yet to find someone who doesn't like it.

I didn't have vegetable oil, so I used olive oil. Maybe that's why I felt the dressing was on the mild side. The red onions and gorgonzola are what pack the flavor. Aesthetically, I think it would look better to thinly slice the pears and avocado instead of cubing.

This was an easy and delicious summer salad. My husband is still raving about it, and he is not generally a huge fan of "fussy" salads. The vinagrette was a beautiful compliment to the texture and of the pear and avocado and set off the gorgonzola perfectly!

Just the right amount of the ingredients to make this a tasty salad. It was easy to make too. And I used the tip on dicing an avocado -- just type in "avocado" on the learn section of the site. It worked like a dream. I had enough for one big dinner salad and two tupperwares for lunches this week.

This is a wonderful salad....great flavors and textures! You can play around with the ingredients depending on your taste. I increased the amounts of lime juice, cilantro and garlic powder in the dressing, and I used canola oil because that's what I had on hand. I also added toasted walnuts for a crunchy texture, and used Comice pears (because I think they taste best).I served it as a first course for dinner last night, and today had it again as a main course lunch! Yum!

Since I am not a big fan of blue cheese, I would make this salad the next time with feta or a similar milder cheese. However, the pears (which I added extra of) and the dressing is to die for.

This is the best fresh green salad I have ever had. The pear is just a fantastic complement to the spicy flavors. I could eat it every day. I left out the onion because I don't like it, though. I made it with corn and cheese soft tacos and the dressing seeped off the salad onto the tacos, mmm,mmm,mmm.

This salad is great! A friend brought it to a picnic and told me where to find the recipe. She had altered the dressing (which tasted wonderful), but the original dressing is perfect. I love the combination of avocado and gorgonzola with the bite of red onion. Will make this again & again.

7/29: I made this with grilled marinated flank steak and everyone loved it. Taste the dressing and adjust accordingly; I added more rice vinegar and lime juice.
