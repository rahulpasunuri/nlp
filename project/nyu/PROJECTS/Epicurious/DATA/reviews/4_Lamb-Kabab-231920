Alteration: Used pork instead of lamb, lemon instead of lime, marinated for a mere hour, skipped the basting, and wrapped the meat in lavashes with lettuce & tomato, mayonnaise & a spicy meat garnish. That might sound like a whole different recipe, but you gotta do what you gotta do. It was great!

While preparing, I was skeptical. The marinade seemed way too oniony. Wrong, it was delicious. I only basted these lightly (2 brushes per skewer) and used ghee not butter. This was great and I'll make again. I also served this w/ mint yogurt sauce.
