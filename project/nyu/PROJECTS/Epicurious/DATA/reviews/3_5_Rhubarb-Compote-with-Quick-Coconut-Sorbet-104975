Well, I went the "quick sorbet" one better and went to Toscanini's for their fab coconut ice cream, but this is terrific rhubarb sauce! A shortbread cookie would not have been amiss, either...

Easy and delicious. The crystallized ginger adds a wonderful flavor...also good with vanilla sorbet or ice cream.

Good, but not great.

It is 1/4 cup minced crystallized ginger. I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. The rhubarb and coconut make a different, but tasty, combination.
