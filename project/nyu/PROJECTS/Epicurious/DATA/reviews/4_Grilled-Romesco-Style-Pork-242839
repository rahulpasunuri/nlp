I too agree with other reviewers. 15 minutes is long enough if your grill is hot. Rest for at least 10 before slicing. Had some leftover panzanella salad that I added more basil and spring mix to plus the pepper that I grilled before I did the pork. Loved the addition of the smoked paprika. Did this with friends and got rave reviews. It also looks great on the platter. Served with linguine tossed with walnut pesto and quartered sautéed mushroom..

Agree with all the reviewers. This was totally amazing! I doubled the recipe to make two tenderloins. I also used half smoked paprika and half regular and a bit less cayenne than it called for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. YUM!

Delicious, fast and easy! I used half smoked Spanish paprika and half Hungarian. Grilled the pork only 15 minutes and it was done. 150 is too high a temperature -- pork will be dry and overdone after resting. Followed other reviewers suggestion and served with mozzarella and tomatoes and crusty bread. Great meal!

Absolutely outstanding - added some smoked spanish paprika to the pork before grilling and some with the regular paprika in the dressing. Used mixed greens and grilled bread cubes, bocconicini and artichokes. Also added a little salt to the nuts when I took them out of the oil.

This is really, really good. I made it pretty much as directed except I cooked the spinach instead of serving it raw. After preparing the dressing I added the peppers (home roasted) and the spinach to the pan, covered it, and let them steam. The vinegar-steamed spinach was fantastic. Will definitely make again.

Very flavourful. Quite a bit of bite to it with the cayenne pepper. We served this with some tomato and mozzerella on the side and a nice crusty bread. Nice because the kids can eat the pork 'plain' and the adults can have the sauce and topping

I LOVED this dish!! I wanted to do something different than the regular meat and potatoes deal. This had a really great flavor.

This was very good, but in no way grill the pork for 20-25 minutes until 150 degrees; it's overdone.

Very nice summer meal. Interesting combination of flavors.

I really loved the flavor! Since I don't have a grill, I used a 2 burner, ridged grill pan and covered it with the top of a pot and it turned out perfect! However, I was not a fan of the jarred red peppers, I think that next time I make this, I will use fresh red peppers and grill them myself. I also added some powdered chili de arbol to the sauce and that gave it even more of a kick than the only the cayenne and paprika.

I liked the bright flavors of this recipe and made a sort of pork salad, using pork filets instead of the whole tenderloin. After grilling, I sliced the filets, and placed them on top of the salad. Yummy!

This was really delicious. I used sherry vinegar and arugula. Lots of textures and flavors. I used just over 1/8 tsp of cayenne and that was enough. Fantastic!

This is one of the best pork recipes ever -- and a fabulous summer meal. I used the sherry vinegar, and grilled 2 large red bell peppers rather than using those in a jar. Everyone loved this!

Absolutely delicious! I did reduce the cayenne by half, and next time would reduce the grilling time a bit. But the flavors and textures were so fabulous that two of us polished off most of it! My husband called this a "definite keeper."

You must make this! This recipe was hidden in the "10-minute mains" section of Gourmet this month. It didn't have a picture to go with it, so it was easy to miss. We love romesco sauce, but this is the easiest, most delicious take-off on it. By using romesco ingredients, but keeping them intact, the textures are amazing. I didn't change a thing (next time I might reduce the cayenne). This was a perfect early-summer dinner. I also served a few mini-balls of fresh mozzarella on the side of the plate.
