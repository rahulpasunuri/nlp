This is an incredibly easy, delicious desert. I've made it twice and have gotten rave reviews both times. I used baking cocoa powder and coffee instead of the espresso powder and it turned out just fine. The only problem with this recipe is that it's a mess to eat. Bits of puff pastry and ice cream all over your hands, quite a mess, no matter how long it sits in your freezer. But delicious.
