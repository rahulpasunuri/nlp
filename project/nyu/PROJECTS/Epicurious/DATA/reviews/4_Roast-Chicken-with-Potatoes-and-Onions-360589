Fantastic recipe - used sweet potatoes instead of regular and made the spinach side dish suggestion at the top of the page in the magazine. Simple and delicious - will definitely make it again!

Very good. A thin slice of lemon under the skin with the rosemary will add a light citrus taste.

This was excellent! Definitely a keeper. Great combination of flavors. The chicken was moist and very flavorful, and the pan drippings with the wine and butter added just the right touch of richness. The vegetables were delicious too, but did not need the extra roasting time. They were well done by the time the chicken was done. Any extra time in the oven at that temp would have dried them out.

Very good as written. My alternative is to omit the garlic and place thin slices of rosemary & lemon under the skin of the legs and thighs as well as the breast. Another alternative is to add carrots and/or peppers into the mix.

The recipe is sound, but if you want flavor use a Weber Kettle Grill instead of a oven.
