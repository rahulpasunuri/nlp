This was delicious. I did everything as the recipe said, except that I purchased canned artichoke hearts, and then rinsed them quickly in a lemon juice mixture. I used the creme fraiche and the fresh morels as directed. Then I served it over jasmine rice. Wonderful meal!

I have to use dried morel's so I also add some fresh crimini mushrooms and substitute fromage frais low fat for creme fraiche. I use all chicken thighs and canned artichoke hearts. Everyone loves it. Keeper

This is just so good and easy to make. There was a similar meal in Italy in the early 80's that I've never forgotten. So glad to have this recipe at last!

Was looking for a healthier way to make this recipe & found it. Used canned artichoke hearts and crimini mushrooms because it's what I had on hand. Didn't have creme fraiche so used the previous comment of buttermilk, nonfat greek yogurt and lemon juice to add at the end. Good flavors, low fat and very simple - almost like country french cooking. I'm sure the original recipe is far better, but I feel great knowing I compromised for a healthier version.

Surprised I didn't like it that much considering I love all the ingredients. It was ediable, but I won't make it again

So I've made this two times so far. The first time, I made a few substitutions. I used jarred artichokes, chicken tender pieces, bella mushrooms and I was all out of white wine so I used red....BEST decision EVER! I used homemade creme fraiche and I used fettucine as a companion. The sauce was not nearly thick enough so I thought I'd make it again using store bought creme fraiche. That time I used the WHITE wine that it called for and noticed a vast difference in taste. Although still good, the RED wine was unbelievably delicious!!! Second time I combined with rice which was able to soak up the sauce a little better since it still didn't thicken like I thought it would. Will probably make again with the RED wine. :)

I did not make this as described since I only had a nice Chardonnay and dried morels. However, it was excellent even with these replacements. I put it on very low and simmered for about 2 hours since I was trying to time everything and needed to have this part done. It was perfect.

What an outstanding chicken dish! Made this for my husband - he licked the plate although he is not usually a chicken fan! Managed to find baby artichokes but had to settle for dried morel mushrooms as fresh ones are not in season. Doubled the sauce as some of the reviewers suggested and there was plenty left for next day's leftovers, which were equally delicious. All the flavors blend in wonderfully - a real treat!

Well I was surprised not to like this more since I love the Chicken in Riesling from this site and other than the artichokes it's more or less the same recipe. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was good but the veggies lacked something. Perhaps I didn't season aggressively enough. I also think that an addition of some extra acid (lemon juice) to the veggies might go a long way. Used cremini's and frozen artichoke hearts but o/w followed the recipe. I have used cremini's for morels and those frozen artichokes in other recipes and it was great so I don't believe those subs are the problem. I'll try it again but not more than one more time unless the next go is a significant improvement.

Very, very good. Used whole baby portabella caps (no morels to be found), removed the skin from the thighs and used 7 oz of crème fraîche (the whole container). Otherwise, kept the recipe the same. Served with rice. Delicious.

This is the best chicken dish I've eaten this year! I made this for a Friday night dinner for my honey and we both agreed that it is definitely "company worthy!" I made it exactly as written - except I used frozen artichokes and brown button mushrooms. Morels were only available dried (at $15.00 a bag!) and there were no baby artichokes. Even so, this dish is scrumptious! There were left-overs and they will be gone by tomorrow!

Rating: 4
This dish if very, very good. I could not get either morel mushrooms or baby artichokes. I substituted brown baby bella mushrooms, halved or quarter-ed depending on size. For the baby artichokes, I used regular artichokes but in future, if I can't find baby artichokes, I will use the frozen artichoke hearts. I served this over a wild rice/basmati rice mix. It is even better as left overs.

Went over really well with the group I made this for! Instead of creme fraise I used buttermilk whisked with lemon juice and a little greek yogurt. Also the chicken cooked in a lot less time than the recipe recommended. LOVED this and can't wait to make it again!

Outstanding! I used chicken breasts, canned artichokes, and baby portabella mushrooms. I flattened the chicken breasts prior to cooking to reduce the cooking time. I didn't add the artichokes until the end so they wouldn't get mushy. I also doubled the sauce like others recommended. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. It tasted incredible and was beautifully presented on the platter.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have bay leaves and didn't add mushrooms since I don't like them. Even with those omitted it was a hit. I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Used skinless bone-in chicken breast and skinless drumsticks and doubled the wine and chicken broth so there was more sauce. Only added about 2 tbs of creme fraiche and the sauce was amazing. Definitely a keeper.

This was very good. My only complaint was that I hardly had any liquid leftover at the end to make the awesome and extremely delicious sauce, even though I only used 3 chicken breasts. Next time I will double the liquid, or perhaps not take the veggies out at the end (maybe only the artichokes) and then make the sauce. I used greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche and it was one of the best dishes I've made in a long time. Baby artichokes aren't in season, so I used marinated baby artichokes from my deli. Husband loved it; was easy enough to make on a weeknight.

Made this dish tonight and followed the recipe with the exception of using dried morel mushrooms as fresh were not available. I soaked them in hot water for a few hours prior to cooking with them. My family (2 young kids incluced) LOVED this dish. I have to say it's my new favorite chicken dish. The sauce is rich but there's not so much as to overwhelm the juicy flavors of the chicken and vegetables. This will definitely be what I serve the next time we have family or friends over for dinner. It's easy to prepare and basically a one pot meal if you work it right. It was AWESOME!

This dish is exceptionally good! I didn't use the morels - too expensive. Used dried oyster mushrooms - they usually have more flavor then fresh ones and less expensive than morels. I also added artichokes for the last 15 minutes. The flavors were amazing! Great recipe.

Yum! Swapped the thyme withRosemary. Swapped the morels with brown mushrooms. Swapped the shallots for cooking onions. Swapped the creme fraiche for whipping cream. Didn't use a bay leaf, and I added some really dry black olives. All this, just because it's what I had on hand. Oh ya, and used beer instead of wine. Given all the substitutions, it was actually fantastic. Served on steamed basmati.

What an amazing dish! I loved it! I made quite a few substitutions since I couldn't find the morels. Used baby portobellas, marinated artichokes, no butter or olive oil since the fat from the chicken was enough. (I even poured out some of the fat before cooking veggies.) Put breasts instead of drumsticks and all broth instead of wine. Made creme fraiche with sour cream and half-n-half. "The sauce was exquisite," said my thirteen-yr. old daughter. Served with fresh bread and was full from the dish and bread alone. No room left to eat a green salad. Definitely adding to my repetoire!

Used frozen artichokes, 4 cups of water (instead of 6), bella mushrooms and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of creme fraiche. Served with rice, this was very good.

I loved this recipe. I used boneless chicken breasts just because I like them better, and just added them back into the pan a little later than the recipe says since they didn't need as much cooking time. I also found that I needed to add more chicken stock, probably an additional 1/2 cup overall, because there was just not enough sauce. I have never cooked with (or even tasted) morels so I was curious to see what all the fuss is about, and I can't say I was blown away, I think another mushroom would substitute just fine. But overall the recipe had great flavor and has a nicer, fancier look and feel than most braised dishes. I served it with polenta, a great accompaniment. VERY filling, definitely not a light spring dish despite the seasonal ingredients.

Man, we love Fricasse in all its forms! Used porcinis and buttons-its what I had. Pared down the recipe for the 2 of us. I could only eat one piece of chicken and I tell you, it was so rich and even better the next day. Made the sour cream/whipping cream creme fraiche and it really made the sauce. Enjoyed with the Cannonau Sardegna 05. Perfect. Earthy and rich.

This was absolutely delicious. I made the recipe exactly as written except made my own creme fraiche with half sour cream and half heavy cream (beaten) Received rave reviews from my friends and can't wait to make it again.

Amazing. the technique of cooking the artichokes in water with flour and salt was odd, but worked in the end to thicken the sauce. Flavors were excellent. We loved the sauce and I am artichoke fiend, so next time we are going to double both the sauce and the artichokes. The morels were great, but could easily be made with less expensive mushrooms, would maybe add a bit more thyme to boost the earthiness.

I agree with a couple of other reviewers ... am always surprised that people review a recipe when they don't first try it as conceptualized. I realize I'm fortunate to live in an area where baby artichokes and morels are readily available in the spring and they really make this recipe. The creme fraiche is a must. Great recipe.

I didn't agree with the other reviewers. I thought it was good, but not exceptional, although it did improve in flavor when reheated the next day. Other thoughts: agree with others that boneless, skinless chicken is a good substitute as well as less expensive fresh mushrooms.

Really good and definitely going into my kitchen rotation. Couldn't find morels, so I used shitakes; didn't have creme fraiche so I used greek yogurt and a jot of dijon mustard. Scaled back to make one serving and served over whole wheet noodles. Absolutely delicious!

Absolutely delicious! Next time I would double the wine and broth. Didn't make enough sauce to serve 3 adults. I served the chicken and veggies over angle hair pasta- it was great! Also I used fresh morells which I soaked in boiling water for an hour prior to cooking, to soften. Def. worth it! Used canned artichokes and it tasted fine. Would def like to try the fresh ones next time

Delicious and relatively easy. I found fresh morels at the farmer's market. I was planning on putting in marinated artichoke hearts from a jar at the end, but since my boyfriend isn't crazy about artichoke hearts, I left them out. Will definitely make again... could substitute dried porcini mushrooms when morel season is over.

This is a delicious and easy spring recipe...have made it several times with both fresh and canned artichoke hearts as well as dried morels(reconstituted). I have also used boneless chicken and used breast pieces for those who prefer white meat. Always delicious!

Great dish. Since morels aren't easily available I went with crimini's and also used canned artichokes. Next time I will use a boneless breast and see how that comes out. It was kind of messy.

I made this recipe using halved small creminis (couldn't find fresh morels). It was quite delicious. I make my own creme fraiche very easily by adding a couple tablespoons of either buttermilk or good greek (thick) yogurt to about 2/3 cup cream (both heavy and light work, although heavy will produce a thicker result)in a covered glass jar and then leaving it out of refrigeration for about 8-10 hours. Do try to use fresh artichokes, but don't add them until the last 20 minutes. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I served it over basmati rice to soak up the delicious sauce. A great way to use baby artichokes when you are lucky enough to find them!

Made this dish last year for a wonderful spring birthday. Felt it important to review, even a year past! Followed recipe exactly as written, with great results. This is truly a seasonal dish, as fighting for the morels and baby artichokes are a prerequisite...though entirely worth the hunt. Creme fraiche makes an exceptional finish. Am planning on repeating again as soon as spring hits!

I will definitely make this again but with some changes. The skin and bones add nothing to this recipe. I will use skinless, boneless breasts and thighs next time. I used cooking sherry instead of white wine, cream instead of creme fraiche and shiitakes and baby bell mushrooms instead of morrels. I will keep at these changes. I used canned artichoke hearts which I will use again but they got very mushy after 35 minutes. I will add them about ten minutes before the end. This recipe is very easy and really delicious.

We made this the first time exactly per the recipe, and found it to be somewhat bland, but with a lot of promise. The second time, we added about 3 Tbsp. of Dijon mustard, more wine and creme fraiche, and some capers. Also used a mixture of mushrooms as others have suggested. Next time we'll omit the initial dredging in flour, as the once crisp coating gets soft anyway in the braising process; if the sauce needs thickening, you can do so at the very end. As modified, this is a definite "4 forks" recipe we'd serve to company any time.

Simply fantastic. I also used canned artichokes, shittake & portobellas with heavy cream (as creme fraiche was not readily available). Served it up with some homemade risotto and received two thumbs up from all my guest. Already have plans to make it again next week!!

Very simple to make, resulting in moist, tender chicken. Next time we'll add Dijon mustard and more fresh herbs to the sauce, but this is the type of recipe you can really make your own, depending on what's in season.

This recipe was wonderful, I could not find Morels locally, so I used shiitake, baby bells and regular button mushrooms... Additionally I used frozen artichoke hearts...to save time and effort. I would and will make this again and again... well done and thanks
