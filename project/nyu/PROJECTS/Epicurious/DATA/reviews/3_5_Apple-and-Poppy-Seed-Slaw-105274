Very good. Mine was made as broccoli slaw and with Veganaise and Tofutti Soy Sour Cream. I was pretty generous with the fresh ground black pepper.

Wonderful recipe. It was a first so I stuck to the original recipe. Will definitely make it again. The apple makes a great flavor to slaw. Love the apple and poppy seed combination. This distinct slaw recipe has made its way into the family cookbook (it's a repeat). Thank you!

Used Galas instead of green, used my own dressing, and let me tell you, apples and poppyseeds are perfect complements to coleslaw. It was a smash at my Fourth of July Dinner With the "Works" and I personally LOVE it.

I had this at a local restaurant on a sandwich I ordered and it was amazing. Perhaps it should be served that way instead of on it's own, just my opinion.

Really non-descript, not a lot of apple flavor- will not make again

pretty good but needs a kick. i used a little less mayo than called for. think i would add some red pepper flakes next time. or perhaps some dijon mustard.

This is a delicious slaw recipe. I served it at brunch with a wonderful cheese and onion pie, so the apple was a very nice complement to the cheese. I did make one change: because I wanted the apple to stand out, I cut it into small pieces rather than grating. A nice surprise in the texture. Everyone loved it.

I can't give a "fork" rating since I didn't follow the recipe to the letter but, with tiny changes, this salad was a super addition to our Easter meal. I hand chopped the cabbage, I like it a little more coarse, and I added an extra apple. Where I live, frozen apple juice concentrate is not available, so I thought the extra apple might make up for the juice. Our "Crema" is not like sour cream, it has no bite, just rich and creamy flavor. What brought the flavor of this salad together for me, was the addition of a generous sprinkling of salt. The salt made the flavors really pop out. The poppy seeds are a must! I will look forward to making this again. I've had this recipe in my files for a few years, I can't figure out what took me so long to make it.

This is a refreshing take on cole slaw. I love the addition of the apple juice and the poppyseeds. I have made this recipe on several occasions. Everyone always wishes the recipe.

This is the first time I've made slaw of any kind. I doubled the recipe and served this slaw for a baby shower luncheon. Omitted the green onions, reduced the mayonnaise, and didn't add any dressing until about 1 hour before the event. I felt the results were good - and like others, I have received requests for the recipe. It was a good recipe for this type of event - easy to eat and a good side to a chicken pie entree.

I made this for my sisters birthday dinner. Went great with baby back ribs. I thought it was good, but she thought it was great. Said it was the best cole slaw she had ever tasted. I think it needed to have a little more pizazz!!! Might work with it. Has alot of potential.

This side dish is refreshing, crispy, and simple to make using my food processor. The last time I put it together I used plain apple cider and it tasted just great. This recipe tastes very good in any season too.

I really liked the tartness the g smith apple brought to this. Followed the recipe exact-what do you mean you couldn't taste the apple?

I didn't have apple juice concentrate on hand, but I will use it next time to see if it completes the flavor and adds the "extra zip" that other reviewers claim this recipe needs. This dish is good simply if you are comforted by the fact that you're eating fresh vegetables! Next time, though, I will liberally sprinkle on the vinegar (as I do when I make my mother's traditional cole slaw sans recipe) and maybe even add a hint of Dijon. Like another cook who commented, I couldn't detect the taste of the apples either!

If you like coleslaw, and apples, this is a great recipe. Super easy to make, follow it to the letter. Everyone will love this!

I'm afraid I have to agree with the first two reviewers. Ho hum in my opinion, however, my guests loved it, so I would probably make it again. The recipe has potential, it just needs something to give it a little extra zip. Like one of the other reviewers, I also added some sugar (to taste) and that did seem to help. I'll have to experiment some more...

I made this for several different picnics and had an empty bowl each time. Liked the use of apple juice concentrate for the sweetness. I don't think it was lacking anything. Omitted the poppyseeds. Grandparents and dentures!

I made this for my husband's annual company BBQ from a friend's magazine and was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a copy. Thank goodness it's been put on the site. Everyone loved it and it was very attractive

I had to add extra apple concentracte and cider vinegar, but it still was just "okay" nothing really jumped out at me, and I couldn't even taste the apples.

I don't agree with the other reviews, because I prepared this for company along with grilled flank steak, heirloom tomatoes w/buffalo mozzarella, olives & herbs, grilled potatoes, corn and asparagus and assorted rolls/breads. My guests loved the slaw and even asked for the recipe. I used Napa cabbage, other than that, I made it as is. I did use a slotted spoon to place in my serving dish after it was refrigerated, which alleviated the problem of it being mushy or runny. It was a very tasty dish and I will definitely make it again!

this was a hit! Even my kids liked it and they don't usually like cole slaw. Don't let it chill for too long after making it. It gives off a great deal of extra liquid and gets too mushy.

I agree with the other chef. The recipe sounds fantastic, but it just doesn't live up to expectations. My mother made this for the fourth of July, and it just wasn't great. We had to doctor it a little bit with additional cider vinegar and sugar, and while it helped, it still was ho hum.

Ho-hum. This is a very average slaw recipe. It sounds SO great, but the results didn't live up to my expectations. It's not bad, just not as good as most Bon Appetit recipes are.
