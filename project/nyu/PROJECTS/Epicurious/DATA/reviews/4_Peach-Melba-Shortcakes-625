I must agree with a previous reviewer that this is an excellent shortcake recipe and would have many applications. I found that 1/2 shortcake was sufficient per serving. I topped the shortcake with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream. I used fresh peaches, as I do not like canned ones, but briefly poached the fresh ones (as per the classic "peches melba"). I used frozen raspberries NOT in syrup, and I used fresh ones just for garnish with a sprig of fresh mint. A tiny drizzle of raspberry liqueur raises this to gourmet status. All in all, it is an easy, delicious, and impressive presentation.

The shortcake in this recipe is outstanding. Just the right amount of sweetness and excellent texture. I halved the recipe with no problems to make three shortcakes. I used regular frozen raspberries (no syrup) and just added a little powdered sugar to give the puree a light sweetness with some tang. I also omitted the fresh raspberries. I did use fresh peaches, but they were too firm and not very flavorful. I think canned would be just fine. The shortcakes are quite large, and since my husband and I were having this dessert for our anniversary after a meal he cooked, we ended up sharing one shortcake and it was plenty. I halved the shortcake and plated it on some raspberry sauce with the peaches and whipped cream on the cake, then the top, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and then a drizzle of raspberry sauce. It was beautiful and delicious. we'll be having it again tonight, but we're using strawberries this time!

I think this dessert is delicious and easy to make. However, I used canned, drained, sliced peaches instead of fresh peaches and omitted the fresh raspberries also. I received rave reviews from my guests.
