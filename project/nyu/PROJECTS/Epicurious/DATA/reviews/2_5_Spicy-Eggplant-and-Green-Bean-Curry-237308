We added a couple serrano peppers for extra zest, 3/4 lb. of roasted pork and doubled the green curry. This one will be good for company.

The first time I made this dish, I was convinced I did something wrong because the curry ended up being very thin and watery without much flavor.The scone time around I took the advice of the previous cook and peeled and diced the eggplant. I also replaced the green beans with green and red peppers. I also tripled the curry paste, added lime zest, thai basil extra scallions and mint. By doubling the flavors this turns out pretty good.

I read all the comments and followed the first one but still this was pretty bland.

With a lot of amending, this turned out great. I added extra curry paste, the whole can of coconut milk, fish sauce, sweet Asian chile sauce and the juice from the lime. I used fresh green beans, cilantro and mint, per the recipe. This is a quick and easy recipe with a mice, fresh taste.

Ok-Here are some tips - I peeled diced and salted the eggplant and let it drain in a colander for a couple hours - This step eliminates bitterness and I've found my mouth doesn't itch if I do this in advance. Before using rinsed well with cold water and squeezed out excess liquid pressing the eggplant in the colander. Took a hint from some of the others here- I tripled the curry paste (11/2 T) - and finely grated the lime peel from one lime - added both with the eggplant and beans - along with 1/2 a chicken breast sliced in roughly the same dimensions as the eggplant. This means you never move anything out of the wok - add the coconut milk at the end bring to simmer for a few minutes - then tossed in the scallions cilantro and mint - splash of fish sauce - teaspoon or so of sugar and the lime juice from the lime-served over basmati rice --yum!

I've made this twice now, once with frozen green beans and once with fresh, and we thought it was "authentic" tasting & delicious both times. I used Asian eggplant and mint from my garden.

Where did anyone get the idea that coconut milk is bad for you? (Recent serious medical studies have shown that it is filled with health benefits and may help prevent heart disease, thanks to its lauric acid, a component also found in human breast milk.) Anyway, thanks to the cook in Baltimore for the suggestions on curry paste. I agree with the Kansas City cook, that fish sauce and lime juice help. It's a great, simple, delicious recipe.

It was not nearly as spicy or Thai as I thought it should be, but after adding fish sauce and lime juice it tasted great.

I don't understand either what the uproar about this recipe is. It's simple, and if you have even BASICS that anyone who likes cooking should have in their kitchen, it is a whizz to whip up. Any good flavoured recipe deserves a bit of time and attention anyway! And as for nutritional value: people need to be wise enough to know these things themselves. It's 2007, yes, but everything can't be done for you! Anyone can know that coconut milk is far from the healthiest things a person can consume: even the lowfat versions are bad for you!! In the end, you can only get out of something what you're willing to put in.

I have just brought my husband home from the hospital with two new stents and the chance to live another 20 years -- provided he EATS RIGHT. This curry looks interesting; now, I need to look up each ingredient and check on fats and carbs. WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF THESE RECIPES INCLUDED THEIR NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION!!!!!

It was very good and surprisingly easy. Minor changes - ommited additional herbs as suggested by cook from Baltimor, used canned beans, but next time will try with fresh ones and added fish (also following suggestions of cook from Baltimore). And also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Delicious!

I make curries like this all the time, and although I didn't make this one I can tell what I'd change by the recipe. First, I'm confused why people think there's a lot of work & mess since it's only a few ingredients & 1 skillet? I would chunk the eggplant instead of putting it in sticks though because it saves time, but otherwise it just takes a minute to chop garlic & ginger with a good Chef or Santoku knife. I'd definitely add at least 3-4 times the curry paste, and good quality is a must! I'd also add a few T. of fish sauce at the end and the entire can of coconut milk. With those small changes it should be delicious!

Try to use only green curry paste and coconut milk without all other herbs in the recipe since the curry paste was made of several herbs combined together.Use about 1-2 Tbsp of curry paste with 1-2 Tbsp of oil cook on low to medium heat until oil turned green color and you can smell fragrance coming out probably will take couple mins,if you like to add cut up meat eg pork or chicken or beef ,add it now to the curry paste,add couple Tbsp of coconut milk and cook until meat done then add the rest of coconut milk (use the whole can) and heat until boiling then add cut up vegetables then cook until done.If you like seafood need to add to the boiling curry soup at the end so it won't be overcooked.Add some basil leaves at the end.Greencurry usually taste slightly sweet therefore add a pinch of sugar to your taste.some time need a little bit of salt as well.I am from Thailand and I cook this for my son allthe time .He loves it.The more you put curry paste the spicy it will be so use it as you wish.Hope it will come out better if any one want to try and good luck.(actually this is the way we make it in Thailand)

I wouldn't even give this one fork, a dissapointment. I really like all of the ingredients seperately, so I was looking forward to this. A lot of work and mess for very little payoff, I agree with the others, into the trash with this recipe.

This just was not good. Agree with cook from Buffalo - not easy, not inexpensive. I diced and chopped and just didn't get any reward from this recipe. My husband and I both thought there was an ingredient missing. In addition, there is a lot of cleanup after making this dish. I'm tossing this recipe.

I'm giving this 3 forks based on changes I'd make next time. I make it exactly as written but as an entree for 2 people over rice. I think putting it over the rice took away some of the zest/spice of the sauce, and if I made it again I'd put in the whole can of coconut milk and maybe add a bit more curry paste. But overall I thought this was a delicious, healthy and different vegetarian entree (not that easy to sell those in this house, but I continue to try, and this was a hit).

I did not like the combination of flavors in this dish. Plus, it was not quick to make (or inexpensive). Would not make it again.
