Maybe it's because I used steel cut oatmeal or have only made scones once before during culinary school...but the scones came out dry. Definitely needed some jam or butter. Great flavor though.

I was striving to recreate a lost recipe, so I made changes to be more like the one I was trying to replicate...RASPBERRY Oatmeal Scones! First, I toasted the oats in a 375 degree oven for about 7 minutes, let cool, as you prepare other ingredients. What I did differently: increase cinnamon (1 tsp, slightly rounded), 1 cup plus 2 Tblsp buttermilk, 1 tsp vanilla (added to buttermilk), 9 ozs fresh raspberries (rinsed & allowed to dry). Rather than sifting flour, sugar, etc together, I pulsed in food processor. Add oats & pulse 5 times; add butter & pulse 12 or 13 times; Fold in buttermilk & vanilla using rubber spatula a few strokes, then add raspberries, gently folding 'til large clumps start to form. Use hands if further mixing is necessary, to keep from mashing all of the raspberries. Divide into 12-14 scones (blobs of dough) on a parchment lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each with cinnamon sugar. Bake at 400 -425 degrees F for 14-15 minutes. These are not traditional dry scones (which I don't care for), but they are moist & yummy! I give this version 4 forks!

I enjoyed these, with a little extra cinammon and nutmeg and also a cup of frozen blueberries.

I have made this recipe many times and have never been disappointed. I always add extra vanilla and spices. Everyone loves them and takes home doggie bags for snacking later. They always come out light and flakey. I have also added dried cranberries and chopped pecans to this recipe with great results.

Definitely bland, I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all.I should have read the reviews before I made these. I love scones and I don't like things sweet but these were more like a savoury scone, perhaps if I had skipped the sugar and added cheese it would make a lovely savoury scone recipe!

Add vanilla! Yummy vanilla oat scones like at Starbucks.

I've made these scones twice now and had great success. After seeing the reviews that noted the recipe as a little bland I added a few more spices (just a little bit of nutmeg and cloves).

Definitely lacks flavor and substance. Good in a fix but not a stand-alone breakfast item.

I suppose that calling these oatmeal scones is apt -- they have about as much flavor as a bowl of plain oatmeal. I agree with the other cooks that they are light and not overly sweet, but by the same token, they are not sweet enough to eat alone (without jam). I would not make them again with the recipe as it is written.

I made this recipe using steel cut oats, adding cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, (a dash here and a pinch there) and half of the flour was whole wheat, they were very yummy. The oats gave them a crunchy nutty flavor and texture

My family loves these scones. Not too sweet, perfect with blueberry jam! So easy to make when all the ingredients can be dumped into the food processor. I added bran and wheatgerm to the recipe, used about a stick and a half of butter but otherwise stayed true to the original recipe and they turned out very well. Will definitely make again and will add blueberries or raisins.

This came out more like a cookie than a scone. It did not rise much.

Wonderful. Light, and not overly sweet. We invited friends for a last-minute brunch, and I was able to throw these together these without going to the grocery store. (I used milk with a little lemon juice in place of the buttermilk.) They liked them so much I sent our guests home with a 'doggie bag'.

This recipe was good but needs a little tweaking before it gets four forks. I added about 1 cup raisins and then drizzled white chocolate after they finished cooling. When I make them again, I'm going to increase the amount of cinnamon, use 1/3 cup light brown sugar instead of 1/4 to make them a little sweeter and use maple sugar on the top before baking to add a unique flavor (you can find maple sugar at most gourmet food stores or Whole Foods). Overall, it's a pretty strong recipe for scones.

I was looking for something to bake that called for buttermilk (the buttermilk in the refrigerator was about to expire) and I found this recipe at epicurious.com. I quadrupled the recipe and added blueberries to half the batter. Half the batter was uesd in my heart shaped muffin pans and the other half I cut into quarters and both turned out perfect....nice and light, not heavy. I will definitely make these again.

Wonderful recipe and very easy. My guests raved! The only thing I did differently was to cut the dough to make 8 scones instead of 18. I will definitely make this recipe again.

excellent with hot beverage. blueberries added makes it even better.

These are delish! I used 1/2c. butter and 1/4c. apple sauce to make them slightly less cardiac-arrest inducing and I don't think any flavour or texture was lost, although i did have to up the baking time to 20 minutes.

These were yummy with a cup of tea or coffee. My office coworkers gobbled them up.

Simple to make. Start to finish in less than 30 minutes and delicious. A winner in the office and requested by friends. Delicate crumb, sublte flavor and with just a dab of butter, the perfect companion to a hot cup of tea or coffee.
