Would have never thought to mix carrots and avocado but it works very well. Love the dressing too. Just a good tip: whenever I use raw onions on salad, I let them sit in salted water and rinse out before using.

Great salad and something different. The carrots were perfectly tender after boiling five minutes. I plan to bring this to the next summer gathering!

This recipe really accents the sweetness of the carrots. It seems a strange combination but it works. I absolutely love it. I have used the recipe without the avocado and another time without the carrot. Both were good, but not as good as the initial recipe.

Changed the recipe up a little by cutting the carrots into very thin rounds 1/8" thick maybe and then blanched them for a few minutes. Everything else was the same until presentation. Rather than chopping the avocados, I halved and seeded them and then topped with the carrot salad. Very light and refreshing.

Fantastic, light, seasonal favorite. This is the dish I will bring to every cookout and pot luck from spring to late summer from now on!

This salad is one of the most delicate, gourmet salads I have ever made. Absolutely delicious!

i made this with spring onions and pears instead of the regular onion and cilantro and it was absolutely wonderful.

The recipe is OK and an excellent solution to an over abundance of avacados in the house. I stayed true to the recipe but if I make again, will cut all the veggies smaller, blanch the carrots a little less, and add a pinch of cayane to the ingredients.
