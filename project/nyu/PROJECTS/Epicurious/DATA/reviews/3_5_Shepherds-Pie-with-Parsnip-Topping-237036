I know some people get cranky when you make a lot of changes to a recipe and then review it, but I had to add my 2 cents for the non beef eaters out there. My husband doesn't eat red meat, so I made this dish with chicken thighs. I made the Brasato just for the purpose of putting in the shepherds pie. It was a lot of work, but the sauce on the meat was so good and the topping was excellent. I think next time I will add some mushrooms to the vegetable mix as the earthy flavor would compliment the chicken and sauce well.

Excellent Dish. Worth the effort will make again, but definately add more salt and i like rosemary with lamb so i'd probably throw that in too.

My family absolutley loved this recipe! They prefer it over the traditional shepherds pie I've made in the past and have made this version 3 times already. I always tweak my recipes as we love garlic and my husband uses only Kosher salt. Wonderful comfort food recipe!

This was not as tasty as we hoped. Good. But, it needed more flavor...

in case anybody cares, shepherd's pie uses lamb, hence the name... the similar pie using beef is called a cottage pie. even trader joe's sells a "shepherd's pie" with beef. what's wrong with cottage pie?

A twist on the more traditional pie using ground beef...we loved it!
