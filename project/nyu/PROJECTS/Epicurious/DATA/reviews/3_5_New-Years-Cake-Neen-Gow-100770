I have made this multiple times for Chinese New Year. It's an easy & consistent recipe that produces (in my Chinese-American opinion) an authentic New Year Cake (neen gow). The reviewers who felt that this was not a good dish were probably not looking for neen gow. The recipe is therefore not for them.

It's not sweet enough, and I've got less of a sweet tooth than most people. Also firmer than I'd like. I halved the recipe and made it in ramekins. For photos, visit http://whataboutsecondbreakfast.blogspot.com/2012/01/nian-gao.html.

Good but not too exciting.

The first reviewer is obviously incorrect, ignorant, or did something wrong. This recipe is right on target. Will definitely make again.

It is a great dish, but sucks.

I have been looking for a recipe of Chinese New Year Cake for awhile, I'm glad I found this. This is called TIKOY (minus the red dates)in the Philippines and a standard during New Year. I followed the recipe, turned out beautifully. My husband and two boys love the slices fried to a crisp exterior with gooey centers. Great with a good cup of Oolong. Will be making this again soon for the Chinese New Year of the Rooster.

Been wanting to make this for many years and finally thought of searching and searched the entire website for this recipe. Can't tell you how exciting I was when I finally came across this!! Just couldn't wait and did it right away with whatever ingredients that was handy at home. I was short of glutinous rice flour so added some sweet rice flour instead (like half and half). It works, just made it a bit firmer, so it's perfect for those who prefer a firmer texture. Also decorated with some red cherries in the centre instead of dates. Go for it! Yummy! Thanks a lot.

I made this for my Chinese mother and we all loved it. It's great fresh, still warm from the steamer, without wok-frying it. Very easy to make. I skipped the red dates, and it's still very authentic!

My friend and I (who are not Chinese) made this dish to take to Chinese New Year with friends'. It was very simple to make. The other guests took seconds and were amazed that we had made it ourselves. Everyone had seconds - and thirds. If you're attending a Chinese New Years celebration, don't be afraid to try this recipe. Revised cutting instructions: this is what they mean: in one direction, cut the cake in 2 inch strips. In thge otehr direction, cut the cake in 1/4" strips. You'll find this easier to manage if you turn the 2" slices on their side.
