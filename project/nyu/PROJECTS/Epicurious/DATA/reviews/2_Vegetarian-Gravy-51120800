This is my first Thanksgiving as a vegetarian and, while I'm happy to give up the turkey, I will miss the gravy on my mashed potatoes and stuffing. So I decided to take a stab at vegetarian gravy. First the good: the color and consistency are amazing. Looking at it, no-one would believe it's not meat gravy. Now the bad: 3 hours at 375 degrees is a LONG time to roast vegetables. Mine did not carmelize; they charred despite using a heavy Calphalon roasting pan on the middle rack. I gave up after about 2.5 hours, removed them from the oven and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I fully expected to throw away the final product but decided to give it a fair shake first. Rather than adding 3/4 of the vegetables to the blender as directed, I added only the ones that weren't charred completely black, namely the turnip and carrot. The final product was better than I expected. I added a tablespoon each of butter and cream in an attempt to cut the bitter taste caused by the burnt bits. I think this recipe is definitely worth another shot. Next time I'll probably lower the heat, toss the veggies with a little oil in the roasting pan, and cover them with aluminum to keep them from drying out so much. If anyone gets it just right, please let me know how you did it! It has real potential.
