good base but it does need some additions. I tried avocado, still a bit bland. Will try grated parmesan next time as well.

Served this to a mediation group during a mindful eating exercise. It is a wonderful way to prepare arugula and accent its flavours and textures without covering them in any way. this will be on my menu many times again!

add some very thinly sliced fennel bulb (really need a mandoline to get thin enough), a few shavings of parmesan or pecorino, and this salad would be 4 forks. I wish I could remember the name of the restaurant in SF where I first had this simple salad so I could give them their credit due. Yes, it's simple, but a revelation if you've never tried it! It is definitely a regular in our rotation of salads.

I had long been trying to recreate a simple arugula salad I had years ago. Turned out it was lemon juice I was missing! The contrast of bitter greens, tart lemon, salt and olive oil are prefect. I whisked it all together before turning the leaves in the dressing. Glad to have this recipe.

I do like the simplicity of this but I really like it with a bit of grainy dijon mustard mixed with lemon juice and olive oil and with cut up avocado!

I think it's funny that this recipe got such high marks--it is very basic. I liked it and would make again as a quick side to many things. But, in my opinion it tastes just like it reads--pretty straightforward.

Because this is tasty yet so quick and simple, I'd make it again in a heart beat. It's a great accompaniment when the rest of the meal is heavy. It'll never be the star of the meal, however. One really needs no recipe to make this dish.

I followed the suggestions of topping with sliced pears and parmesan curls. YUM!

FABULOUS!! I made this for an Italian dinner for out-of town guests and everyone absolutely loved it! So simple- I prefer a bit of tang- and might drizzle some vinegar with it next time- I served it with sliced pears and shaved parmiggiano-reggiano on top- beautiful!

So simple and so delicious....shavings of parmesean cheese is a nice addition to the salad.

Perfecto! Good with course, freshly ground pepper on top too. I peeled and sliced a pear and put slices on each plate to the side of the salad. Enjoyed it alongside boiled lobster and a Cote d'Rhone wine. So simple, so nice! Will definitely use again!

this is a great easy salad, just make sure to use baby arugula or the salad will be too bitter.

This is so quick and easy that it is amazing how wonderful it tastes! I was searching through recipes to make a quick arugula salad, but had few other ingredients. This was just a perfect addition to our pasta night. I had some white truffle/ virgin olive oil (Bakers Cataloque), and also added fresh ground pepper and a few slivers of fresh mozzarella. So good! Will do again whenever they have fresh arugula at the grocery.

If you love arugula and have some really excellent olive oil, this is the best every day salad I've found. Really. Yum.

A bag of organic baby arugula, a lemon, salt and olive oil. So simple. Served alongside shrimp scampi first course. Great complementing flavors.

Perfect summer salad. I used fresh, organic arugula grown here in alaska, and added parmesan & cracked pepper to the ingredients. I'll make this again & again.

Beautiful simplicity! Just so! Tonight this salad-- with some grated parmesan-- constitutes my entire dinner. As the happy-tired new mother of a 6-week-old baby, I must be in the mood to keep it simple... and this salad is a deeply satisfying simple. Did I mention arugula is a good source of folic acid, the prenatal-vitamin staple that may keep us from getting Alzheimer's?

Wonderful. I made this to accompany the Sweet Potato Salad with Chili-Lime Dressing and Grilled Tuscan Pork Rib Roast with Rosemary Coating and Red Pepper Relish and it was a refreshing contrast. Not having fresh lemon juice I used lime. Next time I cant't wait to try some of the variations suggested by the other cooks.

I always eat this salad, at least three times a week. I have a lemon tree and quality olive oil is a must. I'd add left-over salmon, pine nuts, or goat cheese. YUM. One italian restaurant has this on the menu with roasted beets and goat cheese. Absolutely delicious!

Albert Einstein once said: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." This recipe epitomizes that thought and also mirrors my personal philosophy on cooking...it is not the complexity...it is the freshness and quality of the ingredients that make a recipe shine. Fresh, organic arugula, high-quality olive oil, freshly squeezed lemon...you can't go wrong...won't outshine the entree, but will be a delightful understated compliment.

This is my all time favorite way to eat salad. The only thing I do differently is add shaved parmigian cheese and it is UNBELIEVABLE! The flavor is addicting. Enjoy!

This is especially great whenever you are featuring a dish that is to star, like a special risotto. I used organic arugula and refreshed it in ice water then spun dry and in the fridge til dinner. It complements without competing.

Like the Minimalist Chef from the NYTimes? Then you will love the way this 'no-brainer' recipe allows the arugula to shine. The second time I added some toasted pine nuts and late summer tomatoes.

I am far from a novice cook, but I had never heard of a salad recipe as simple and tasty as this (guess I lack imagination!!). I have made this about 3 times recently. Since arugula doesn't exist in this town, I use spinach (as other reviewers have suggested). I rely heavily on other reviewers and have tweaked this recipe by using their advice: add chopped tomato to the basic salad; top the salad with avocado slices, Parmesan cheese, and freshly cracked black pepper. THIS RECIPE IS EXCELLENT!!! If I could, I would give this 5 stars. Make it any day of the week--spinach is so healthy and there is not much oil in this. [A note to "Claudesta": I get very frustrated when I try to read reviews on this site and cannot figure out what the reviewer was trying to say (due to poor spelling, improper sentence structure, etc.). So I don't think that it is "TACKY" to berate those individuals who totally butcher the English language. I noticed that your review was in good prose and easily read!!!] Thank you.

Great tastes, if you cannot find Arugula use baby Spinach

Hey San Diego! The only reason I commented on the spelling of a previous critique person was to point out that "judge not lest ye be judged". To ME, what was TACKY was commenting that this was not a recipe. Maybe not for you or me. But for the novice---it was a good thing. Guess that one went over you head. SWHOOSH! Oh! Well!

In Greece and Italy, arugula is usually dressed with balsamic vinegar rather than lemon juice. Arugula with shaved Parmesan cheese, balsamico and olive oil is a salad to be found just about everywhere, and it is absolutely divine. We often add chunks of tomato, which balances out the flavors. Pine nuts and avocado, as suggested by another cook, are also great additions. And yes, I do agree that this hardly qualifies as a recipe, but thankfully there are all these people out there who offer their variations and make all the difference!

To this recipe I add fresh corn and slivers of fresh parmesian.It's one of our favorite summer salads. Try adding pine nuts too. I like reading how people add their own personal touches to recipes.......

This is a wonderfully subtle way to include greens at lunch or dinner. *By the way, I think that the reviews should be limited to the food and not expand to include a review on the opinions or bad spelling of other reviewers. That's just plain tacky.

Now Alexandria - if one has never made this before, how would one know how to make it without an ingredient list and instructions? By the way, did you know that every time someone gripes and comments that a simple recipe is on this top 30 list, it just keeps it there that much longer. Enjoy!

Excellent! I have to say that I didn't realize I ran out of lemons so I used lime juice instead and it was extraordinary! I also added some shavings of parm. Delicious!

A slight variation of this is my favorite salad...I toss in about 1/2 to 1/3 of chopped up pear and some parmesan shavings (use shavings instead of grated or shredded, if you can).

I have been making this recipe at home for several years after having enjoyed it at a favorite local restaurant. Top with grilled shrimp & shaved parmesan or other hard Italian cheese & it's definitely one of my favorites.

This is one of my favorite salads also. A little Italian restaurant I frequent has it on their menu. A great variation is to add some butter lettuce and avocado slices.

Weird that this is a recipe!? Anyway, we commonly use this on any green salad. It has to be my favorite way to dress a salad. Light and simple, yum.. don't forget a couple grinds of the pepper mill.

What's next, oil and vinegar? Another great dressing to have in the back of your head for quick salads...

This is a great side salad for any entree that won't overpower the dish, but will add a great flavor and contrast to your main dish.

As I read this recipe in the June issue, I kept thinking about some leftovers I had in the fridge: gorgonzola cheese, grilled skirt steak, roasted red peppers. I decided this dressing would work well in a salad with these ingredients, so that is what I made. Delicious! The greens in my salad were baby spinach and red leaf lettuce. Very simple, isn't it? A good recipe to have in the back of your mind for quick salads.
