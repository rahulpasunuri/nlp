The best ever pumpkin pie!

Rating: 4
This was the favorite pie at our Thanksgiving table this year. It is easy to make and the crust is superb, nice texture and great taste.

Made just the filling for this -- used a regular crust recipe instead. It was food, but not fabulous. The consistency was definitely nicer than regular pumpkin pie -- much lighter. But the pie didn't set quite as firmly as I would have liked, and the taste just didn't have enough "oomph" somehow. Perhaps it would be better with additional spices.

This pie didn't wow me. Flavor was good, but nothig spectacular. The crust, however, is very good...will use that again. It made a full 9" pie and 2 small ramekins. Save some of the crumbs to sprinkle on top for nice presentation. Unfortunately, the host of the potluck we went to did not heed my request to put it in the fridge until dessert time. Instead, she left it on the counter in the hot kitchen, and it wound up being a mushy mess by the time it was served. (Why bother taking good food to homes of people who don't appreciate it?)

This was SO good. My tip would be to press the gingersnap/pecan mix into a springform pan. Make this like a cheesecake-like form, not a pie. The crust was a bit buttery, so next time, I'll cut back on the butter by a few TBS. Otherwise, it was delicious and the crowd favorite.

This was the big hit of my three desserts - I think it actually tasted better after 48 hours; somehow the spice flavors in the chiffon developed more, and I thought crust perfect consistency after sitting (i.e. not overly hard)

Hmm. I am still trying to decide if I really liked this pie or not. Those that I served it too made polite noises but I don't know if they loved it. My filling, while light had a less than silky texture and I don't know what caused that. I had a recipe for pumpkin chiffon out of the newspaper years ago that was fabulous. This was not the same as that one. I don't know if I would make again. The crust isn't bad but since I made my pie almost 24 hours before I served it I thought the crust was a little soggy. I don't know if I'll make this again.

I have been making this crust for many years with different fillings which don't have gelatin in them. I love to combine this with the recipe for "Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Streusel Topping". I look forward to making this crust each fall - love it! I will reduce the amount of sugar in the crust at times.

This was one of the best Pumpkin Pie's I have ever had.

This was delicious; however, I would not make it again because compared to a tradition pumpkin pie recipe it has more steps, takes way more time to prepare, and packs more calories. I might make the crust again for another type of pie.

The only pumpkin pie I've ever made and eaten. So light and fluffy, it is one of the best dessert recipes to come out of Gourtmet's offerings. Also look up the pumpkin custard pie with with win-poached peears on top. Both are exceptional and will become favorites of family and friens. I switch between the two every year to keep it fair.

Save a little of the crumb crust to scatter over the top. It looks really pretty.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving this year. So huge - traditional pumpkin is now out at our diner and this was unanimously the favorite! 1 cup of oatmeal was substituted for pecans in the crust crust for nut allergies and worked well.

Rating: 4
I thought this was delicious. It was not as light and airy as a normal chiffon pie, but was a good way to make pumpkin pie lighter and more delicious, as I think the usual version is dense nad unappetizing. I made it without pecans because someone had a nut allergy and it was still great.

We have a large family of pumpkin pie lovers and I have to say that since I started making this pie for Thanksgiving 3 years ago I have not gone back to my old recipe. This pie is light and delicious. My brother has demanded it for his birthday (in August) and I am looking forward to having it again even though we are in the dog days of summer.

This pie was scrumptious! The pecans made the crust, and all the flavors worked in perfect concert. Sadly, we had stopped making my mother's traditional pumpkin chiffon pie years ago because the eggs are uncooked, so I was thrilled when I found this recipe. I was even more thrilled when mom pronounced it a keeper. The next time I make this pie, I will consider eliminating or reducing the sugar in the crust. In any case, let's just say this pie did not stick around much beyond the night I served it.

I am delighted with the way this pie turned out. I followed the recipe exactly. It was a big hit. I love the crust and the filling was smooth and silky with a great flavor. I topped with sweetened whip cream and cinnammon. I will definately make again. Many of those I served it too were not big fans of the traditional custard pumpkin pie but loved this version.

Rating: 3
This pie was very delicious; I enjoyed how light the filling was compared to the traditional pumpkin pie. The pie crust is something that I would love to try on a few other pies recipes. I will defiantly make this pie for the holidays!

Toast the pecans then add to the gingersnaps for the crust. I added a little sugar. The pie is wonderful. Light but full of flavor and calories (unfortunately) but it is a "keeper" for special occasions. We had guests who are not pumpkin lovers who raved about this pie.

I used this filling to make a "diabetic" pie for my father in law, with Splenda instead of the sugar. (I don't think sugar substitutes work too well for baking, and this gets around that problem.) I put the filling in a nut crumb crust to keep the sugar down. I'm sure the original recipe is better, but my father in law raved about it.

Thought this very easy to make and was a hit with everyone. it traveled well, leftovers held up very well..and very good flavor ... extra chiffon was great on its own !

Great taste and superb crumb crust. Maybe too sweet and a little heavier than a true chiffon type pie. Still lighter that the usual pumpkin pie.

Rating: 3
I loved the way the filling turned out. The crust was too "browned" tasting compared to the filling. I doubled the filling and used the original amount for the crust, and used a 12 inch springform. The pie texture was great, and the leftovers were just as good!! I will make this again with a different crust.

Rating: 3
Used the recipe for the crust only, which was delicious and easy with no rolling. For the rest of the pie, I made the Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Streusel topping. All 11 diners raved, one has asked for the recipe already, and that was the warmup for Thanksgiving.

I never used to like pumpkin chiffon pie, but my mom made this resipe for me a coupple of years ago and now I beg her to make it every thanksgiving.

Rating: 2
The ginger snaps really overpowered the flavor of the filling. If I make it again I will do something to "soften" the flavor of the crust. This was an interesting take on pumpkin pie and a nice option for something new, but I think the traditional pumpkin pie is still better.

I would not make this again and would try to find another recipe. Wasn't as smooth as I had hoped

This pie is excellent! Very delicate, almost like a cheesecake in texture, but so subtle in taste. Very yummy. This has replaced traditional baked pumpkin pie at my table during the Holidays!

Rating: 2
I made this pie as an alternative to a regular pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. Nothing really wrong with it, but not worth all the trouble it took to make it.

Rating: 3
I only made the crust for use with another pie recipe, the crust got rave reviews from guests and looked very festive and attractive. It lacked a certain zing in my view, but all others loved it.

yummm yummmm this turned out great the crust was crispy and the pumpkin filling creamy and flavorful. I will make this again.

I was some what disappointed with this pie. The crust was good. However, too much cream and too little pumpkin.

Rating: 3
I took this to the office and it was devoured. It's quite the crowd pleaser. The crust is divine, and would even be good baked flat and eaten as is. The filling is light and fluffy, though it din't quite set- perhaps I need to use a little more gelatin. It's a nice alternative to a traditional, dense, dark pumpkin pie.

Rating: 4
Have made this pie countless times, always to rave reviews. It is a great deal more trouble than a traditional pumpkin pie, but very much worth it, as it's lighter, silkier, and more elegant. No need to restrict yourself to pecans in the crust--walnuts and hazelnuts are great too. I always make this recipe in a shallow quiche pan, which gives a more professional-looking result and just the right proportion of custard to crust.

This was delicious! And very easy to make. I saved some of the crumbs from the crust mixture and sprinkled them over the whip cream on top when I served it. It got oooohs and aaahhhs Thanks!

I used only the recipe for the crust, opting for a gelatin-free pie filling. An amazing, fantastic, perfectly wonderful crust!! A perfect compliment to any pumpkin pie filling. Highly recommended.

I had made this in 1995 - Twice!! No doubt, it was the best pumpkin pie we've ever tasted. So light and fluffy. The pecans in the gingerbread crust is a MUST! I had lost my Gourmet 1995 issue and was bummed out about losing this recipe. I finally got a computer and am so extremely happy for this site!!!

i cannot believe how delicious this pie is. the only problem was that i didn't make it for many people, so the crust gets soggy after a few days. but this pie, from the amazing filling to the BEST CRUST I'VE EVER TESTED, is the best recipe (that i haven't inherited from mom) that i've ever tried.

This was definetly a hit at the Thanksgiving table. The ginersnap crust really complimented the pumpkin filling. This desert was not to heavy so it was pefect after stuffing ourselves at dinner. I used twice as many ginersnap cookies, being that cookies I used were smaller. Yum!

i was looking for a very old gourmet recipe for this pie -- the filling used drambuie instead of rum and the crust was crushed vanilla wafers instead of ginger snaps. try it either way and no holiday will seem the same without it. I can't even look at plain old pumpkin pie anymore!

Rating: 4
This is a delicious and easy pie. I followed the directions explicitly and was delighted with the results. The crust MADE the pie. Do not substitute a regular pie crust (or worse, a store-bought crust) it will not be the same. And plus, the ginger snap crust takes only minutes to make. The only thing I will change the next time I make it (which will be on Thanksgiving) is to use a deeper pie plate. There was too much filling for my tiny 9 inch pie plate.

This is THE best pumpkin pie recipe. If I don't make this for the holidays everyone is so disappointed. Also, I use just plain Pillsbury pie crust and it comes out great.

Change nothing, but do use one whole 14 or 15 ounce can of pumpkin. Make sure you evenly spread the crust in a deep dish 9 inch glass pie plate. Graciously accept the kudos from your guest. This is a wonderful recipe.

Everyone loved the pie, I read the comments and used the spice amounts on the can which used nutmeg instead of cloves - next time I make it, which will probably be this week-end, I'll try 1/4 of nutmeg and 1/4 of cloves. The crust is delicious, you have to be careful to pat it up all sides and make sure bottom isn't too thick for filling - mine came out perfectly

I make this dish every holiday and sometimes just for something different for dessert.

If I have any complaint with this recipe, it would be with the crust, which while delicious, was too thick and totally obscured the pumpkin flavor(which is fine if you're not a pumpkin lover). Still I found it easy and it was a huge hit at my T-giving. I would definitely make it again, but would make a smaller amount for the crust and use more pumpkin in the filling.

My family loved this pie. It was time consuming to make but worth the effort. I used the spice amounts on the pumpkin can and that seemed to be perfect.

A unique pumpkin pie recipe with a light and airy filling with just the right amount of spice. The crust has a nice crunch and great flavor. This pumpkin pie doesn't sit like a lead weight after you eat it, it just leaves you feeling deliciously satisfied.

I made this last year for T-giving and received raves. Will make it again this year. Yummy, crust is great.

I think the spicing is a bit off. There was something funky about the combination. I much prefer the spicing balance in the recipe on the can of pumpkin. I don't think the hassle of this recipe is worth it. The pumpkin pie recipe in the Nov. 1999 issue of Bon Appetit is much better. The crust was interesting, however.

Rating: 3
The Gingersnap crust was excellant and I will use it in other recipes. The pumpkin was not spicey enough for me. I would spice it up next time.

Rating: 4
This pie is delightful... a robust and flavorful crust that is sure to surprise any guest. I like to make two, but be sure that they will be eaten within 48 hours. This pie doesnt "age" well. For the folks who prefer a bit more spice than normal, I would recommend doubling the nutmeg, and perhaps adding a 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. Also of note: I think there may be a typo in the recipe... it is 1&1/4 CAN of pumpkin, not 1.25 cups! This pie is a lot of work, but the results are outstanding.

It was a nice lighter ending to a big meal. The ginger snap crust complemented the pumpkin chiffon beautifully. I multiplied the recipe by 1-1/2 and made it in a 10-inch pie plate with fine results.

this pie was easy to make but the flavor and texture were lacking. in the future i would make a regular pumkin pie and top it with the chiffon to give this pie some body.

I made this pie last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I can't wait to make it again next month!

A wonderful alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. Those who don't generally care for pumpkin pie (myself included) and even those who "couldn't have Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie" loved it.
