Found ramps and local lamb sausage at the farmer's market today, and thought I'd tool around to see what I could make! Used homemade organic chicken stock, and WOW. This was delicious! The lamb sausage (which had feta and mint in it) may have overpowered the ramps a bit, but overall it was still phenomenal! Definitely worth a try if you fall into ramps!

I have made this twice with ramps that grow wild on our island. It is easy and delicious! I found the amount of broth just right. Added some fennel seeds.

This was amazing. I did end up needing to use twice as much broth as was called for, but it turned out great. This is a new staple.

This dish was fantastic. This is my first time writing a review on epicurious, but I was compelled because this was so good. Hot sausage is key - it gives it tremendous flavor. I used extra ramps, almost a pound of sausage, and didn't have vermouth so I just left it out. Will definitely make again.

First off, full disclosure here...I altered this recipe quite a bit based on what I had handy. I was searching for something to make for dinner which didn't require me to go the store. I had just about everything except the ramps so I used leeks instead and I only had sweet italian sausage. This was still quite good and I can't wait to try it again exactly as written but will have to wait until spring to find ramps in my area. The fresh parmesan is really important. I will say it isn't that good the next day but risotto leftovers typically don't appeal to me.

The BEST risotto I've ever made. You must try this. But I agree, ramps are the key - without them it's just your average risotto. Can't wait to make it again this weekend after a trip to the farmer's market.

I found this recipe after buying ramps at the local farmer's market. It was easy to make vegetarian by using vegetable broth and veggie sausage. Very easy, very tasty, and well worth the effort.

I made this for my husband who said it was the best risotto he's ever tasted!

Made this recipe as is and it was awesome, hands down my most delicious risotto ever! I'm sure substitutions are delicious also but I have to agree with the previous reviewer that you have to try this recipe as is in order to get the harmonious flavors of this dish. I'm sad that I probably won't get to try this again anytime soon since ramps don't grow in my area. If you are in an area with an Asian supermarket you may want to try substituting Chinese chives. I think the flavor and smell is similar to ramps, maybe just a bit sweeter.

Make this recipe exactly as is. If you can't locate ramps in your area, then don't even attempt it. The subtle flavor of the ramps are what this recipe is all about. It's an exceptionally delicious risotto.

This is a fantastic recipe. The only changes I made were to 1) add a scallion since I only pick the leaves of the ramps (wanting to leave the roots to encourage them to spread) and 2) used white wine since I don't have vermouth. I don't usually like cheese in my risotto, but this recipe has just the right amount. If you have big eaters, I would double the recipe.

Outstanding. Hubby promptly dubbed it his favorite risotto recipe ever (which is saying something). No ramps to be found (yet), so I used leeks. Served with the fennel and celery salad also on the website, which was also a huge hit.

Delish. I have also made it with Quinoa, which is quicker and just as tasty!

The fine print: Not quite time for ramps when I tried this, so I substituted leeks (white and some green). I also used sweet italian sausage, as opposed to hot, and white wine instead of vermouth. Finally, I topped with some slivered radish. Great!!! So simple and it really had a wonderful, clean flavor---I will make again.

Fabulous recipe. I made it with leeks instead of ramps and dry white wine instead of vermouth and it was still wonderful. So easy.

This meal is on my steady rotation, now. Every time it's made, someone comments on how great it smells in the cooking process! Also, very easy -- my boyfriend has added it to his rotation as well, which keeps him away from fast food. Avoid sausage in casings altogether, as I bought a bunch of sausage in casings and found they add extra grease to the recipe and make it a sickly orange color. Scallions can be subbed for ramp.

This is not only the best risotto I've ever made, but the best recipe I've ever made from Epicurious and possibly the only one I haven't change . . . much. When ramps were no longer available, I used spring onions, which extends the time a person can make this risotto by nearly a month. Each time, I've used whatever white wine I happen to have. My only caveat is that it makes enough for two, if they're piggie, or three people eating normally. I'd hesitate to try and feed four people from this recipe.

Wonderful recipe and very quick and such a nice way to use the beautiful greens available all spring and summer. We used beet greens and even the most anti-vegetable person I know loved it and took the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I added some morels, and sauteed the julienned tops of the ramps in a separate pan before stirring them into the risotto at the end. When I tasted the result, it seemed to scream out for some lemon zest, so I added that as well. Wonderful result! Will definitely make again.

Delicious. AND it was special enough for a dinner party, yet easy and quick enough for a weeknight dinner. That's a winning combo!

I've never had Ramps, bought them at the Farms Market and made this recipe, I added Asparagus too and it was wonderful!

Rating: 3
This was great! I added asparagus when there was about 10 minutes left to cook - would recommend that to make it a more complete dish.

I may have cooked the risotto for too long because it was mushier than other risottos I've made but the flavor is great. I realized too late that I had no vermouth in the house so I used a dry white wine instead.

Awesome Risotto! My husband loved it and I did too.
