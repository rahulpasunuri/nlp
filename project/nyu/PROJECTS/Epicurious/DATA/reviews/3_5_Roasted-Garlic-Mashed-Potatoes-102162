This came out perfectly. Served it under Red Wine Braised Short Ribs. Didn't put the half and half in a sauce pan, just dumped everything in to the cooked potatoes at the same time and it was fantastic.

Opps, please disregard my previous review - it was meant for the Crispy Garlic and Rosemary Potatoes. I don't know how to delete review.

I used red potatoes instead. I also cooked a lil longer than suggested and it just added a great crispy taste.

I don't eat potatoes anymore, but knew these would make a good side dish to my Xmas Eve menu. The guests loved them. I'd recommend for all potato lovers.

As others have said, more garlic, definitely salt and pepper - I used a mixture of cream and half and half I had leftover from another recipe, which made them extremely rich and smooth.

I have made these twice for dinner parties and everyone raves about them. I added a 1/4 cup chicken broth too.

Very good - and easy. The house did not smell like garlic afterwards. But needed salt, pepper - probably could have added cayenne for a bit more of a bite.

This is one of the easiest, tastiest dishes I have made. Everyone just raved about it at my Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

I substituted whole milk for 1/2 & 1/2. Just as good in my opinion. This will be the only garlic mashed recipe I will ever use. Mmmmmm.

Excellent! Add some milk and make potato soup with a great flavor!

To the Cook from Hainesport, NJ - roasting the garlic longer (up to 60-75 minutes) will soften it even more making it easier to mash. I suspect yours were a little less done then they could have been.

Per the advice of others. I doubled the amount of garlic. Next time I'll triple it. It was very good.

Great stuff. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and I added some fresh rosemary when the half&half was simmering, added a nice flavor to it.

I have a question regarding the technique for the garlic as this was my first time roasting it. While the garlic was very soft when done roasting and easy to pop out of its skin, I found that it did not blend that well into the potatoes. The flavor was wonderful but many of the heads did not mash down (using electric mixer) and I was left with rather large chunks of garlic throughout the potatoes. Is this to be expected or could I have done something differently?

My boyfriend LOVED these potatoes. Since it was just the two of us, I used two large baking potatoes and about half the head of garlic. great sweet garlicky flavor that didn't overpower the rest of the meal. roasting fresh garlic is so easy (just throw it in the oven and forget about it!) that there's no excuse to buy the pre-made stuff anymore

I used the NON-FAT half & half, now available at Safeway and QFC. You cannot tell the difference in taste at all, and the richness made the dish a real success. And no fat from the cream....

Great recipe. Very easy to make. I used unpeeled red potatoes and had to boil them a bit longer, and they were wonderful. Just don't forget to cut the tops off the garlic before you roast it to make it easier later.

Rating: 3
I cut the recipe in half, but by mistake added the whole head of roasted garlic -- and it wasn't enough!! Also needed to add quite a bit more salt. Other than that, it was great! Poppy

The half & half really makes these potatoes creamy. I also whipped them on high in my Kitchenaid mixer to give them an extra fluffy texture. The roasted garlic flavor is relatively mild for garlic-lovers, so be liberal with the roasted garlic.

Very easy and delicious!!! My two year old daughter who hates mashed potatoes loved them!!! Would definately use recipe again.

my sister added some sweet potatoes to this recipe and it was delicious. It gave it just a little extra flavor that potatoes sometimes lack.

As an avid cook, I am almost ashamed to say that I have never made any roasted gralic mashed potatoes before. I guess I usually do more ornate side dishes. But this just sounded right for my menu. This recipe was easy and very good. My guests asked for the recipe. I recommend these roasted garlic mashed potatoes!

This was good. However with so many other great potato recipes out there, I would not make this one again.

I used red potatoes instead and it turned out very colorful. The garlic took a lot of time, so I would suggest doing it a head of time. All in all, the finished product was very good and even better the second day.

This is delicious and easy to make. I made it earlier in the afternoon and reheated in the oven and just before serving topped with a little Parmesan cheese and browned the top under the broiler.

I used red potatoes and substituted fat free sour cream and only one tablespoon of butter. Turned out great.

The potatoes were pretty good. I just don't care for the flavor of russets. I'm hooked on red potatoes. I used evaporated milk instead of half and half and also roasted peeled garlic cloves that I had in the freezer. If I make these again I'll try them with red potatoes.

Good - I would ad a bit more garlic and a bit less cream - kind of goopy but delicious

Delicious!! I used warm whipping cream (all I had) it came out so rich and creamy. Be generous with roasted garlic, it makes the dish.

In one word "Yuck!" This dish was horrible and I love garlic.

YUM! I modified this a bit by splitting the half & half and adding buttermilk (gave it some zing!). With a recipe like this one, who needs to try mashed poattoes anyway else? mmmmm......

Made this recipe once again...you cannot beat freshly roasted garlic with just a tad of olive oil. I used Yukon gold this time and used 1% instead of half and half. This is the ultimate comfort food!!

Being an avid devotee of garlic in practically any form, I was especially impressed with the wonderful flavor the roasted garlic gave to the mashed potatoes. Much better than granulated.

Excellent side dish. I served this with a red, yellow, and green pepper, and jalepeno rib recipe. It was a terrific balance for the spicy nature of the ribs. I used my stand mixer--which made this recipe a cinch to execute. Enjoy!

Most Excellent !!! I increased the garlic to 3 roasted heads..... although.... look out for the 'garlic farts' about an hour later ~ good thing it was a Family Thanksgiving.

I increased the garlic by another half a head, and added some roasted shallots. Also added some salt to bring out the garlic flavor. It was very good.

This was my first recipe from epicurious. I cleaned the skin and cut out any spots on the potatoes and left the remaining skin on for color. I served it with grilled steak and sauteed green beans. What a versatile side dish!

This recipe would be good with spicy roast meats since they are kind of bland. I prefer my mashed potatoes to be a little more flavorful (i.e. adding green onions or maybe garlic salt).

I used garlic cloves that have been marinating in olive oil for quite some time. We served it with filet minion, mushroom wine sauce, and creamed spinach. An elegant dinner!

Lovely. Just lovely.

Very, very good. We'd tried roasting garlic before, and it didn't come out too well. We decided to take a risk with this recipe - and it was certainly worth it! We didn't have half and half so we substituted milk and the result was still wonderful. Served it with "pork chops with mango-basil sauce", also from Epicurious.com. Delicious!

To lower the fat I used skim milk and it turned out delicious.

Incredible mashed potatoes!!! They stand out wonderfully on their own (i.e., no need for gravy, etc.). They go perfectly with the "Spicy Lamb with Tomato and Cilantro," also from this website.

I boiled small Yukon Golds unpeeled. Then mashed the potatoes and used their broth for the liquid. I did use two heads of roasted garlic, but I made enough for eight. The Yukon Golds are so delicious that no cream or half and half is needed, and very little butter, to make it a Five Star accompanient.

I added an additional 1/4 cup butter. I tasted much creamier and balanced out the garlic. Very delicious. I served it with Prime Rib, red wine gravy, lemon green beans. Very tasty!

This went over well with my Thanksgiving guests also! Next time I'm going to add more garlic.

This was very good. But instead of mashing the garlic into the potatoes, it mixes better if you puree the garlic with the half and half (I used whipping cream) and butter and then blend into the potatoes.

This is one of our favorite potato dishes. I did change it a bit by leaving on the skins - giving it a more of a "country mashed" flavor..more nutrition.Would recommend this recipe to ANYONE.

Very tasty. My family raved about the potatoes during the entire meal, and then they made me promise that this will become a regular recipe in my cooking. Try it, you'll like it.

This recipe made for yummy mashed potatoes. It was my first experience roasting garlic, and I enjoyed it. I'm a garlic lover though, so I think that this recipe would have been better with a bit more garlic.

Very good. I left the potatoes lumpy which I sometimes like, but I think this particular recipe would be better smooth.
