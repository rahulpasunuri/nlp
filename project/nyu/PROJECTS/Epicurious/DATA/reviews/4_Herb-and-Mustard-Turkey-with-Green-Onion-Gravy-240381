We made this recipe with a Narragansett heritage turkey this past Thanksgiving. The turkey was divine and the gravy was absurdly delicious. This will be our go-to turkey & gravy recipe from now on. I'm going to try roasting a chicken tonight with the same method.

My husband picked out this recipe for me to make for Thanksgiving and it turned out so well we are naking it for New Years as well. The enriched stock made a very good gravy and I especially enjoyed the flavored butter under the turkey skin. It was so good that I saved the extra and used it to spread on bread the next day.

I Made this as part of the overall Country Thanksgiving menu from Nov. issue. I overcooked the turkey, but it was till quite good. But the gravy. Good god, the gravy. Possibly the best gravy I have every had. I would make the bird again, but I don't know that I really tasted all the herb butter. Mostly, I tasted good turkey and amazing gravy. Steps to make the gravy were complicated, but well worth it.

I made this Thanksgiving '07 as well, and plan to make it again next year--it was absolutely delicious! Yes, the butter was difficult to spread, but it's got to be done--I'd brined my turkey the day before as well, and the following morning, massaged this herb butter under the skin, olive oil on top with s & p, put it in the oven at 500 degrees for a half an hour--it came out perfectly brown and smelled wonderful. The extra bonus was the gravy that resulted from using the pan dripping--best ever!! sassy sandy

I made this for Thanksgiving '07 and wow. Incredible! All preparation was done the night before. I put the butter spread on the turkey and stuffed it with herbs the day of. It was beautiful and moist. I recommend letting the butter spread come to a complete room temperature almost melting as its easier to handle and spread under the skin.

This was good, but not out of this world fantastic. I thought the butter was a gigantic pain to spread. This was the first time I used a flavored butter to rub under the skin, but it wasn't as easy as I expected. First, my turkey was too cool, and the butter hardened. (I let the turkey warm up a bit before trying again). When I came to rub the butter under the skin of the breast meat, it glopped all over my fingers, making it extrmemely difficult to spread evenly. Also, I had to settle for rubbing only the top of the turkey with butter; when I tried to rub the bottom, the butter slid off the bird and onto the platter. Anyway, it tasted good, but I think simply brining the turkey and using a different recipe (that didn't call for a compound butter) would have been more tasty, and definitely more simple.

I will admit that I completely over cooked my turkey, but you could still tell the flavors were wonderful. I can't wait to make it again and actually pay attention this time!

Turkey was the easiest I've made in many Thanksgivings. Result was a very moist turkey with NO basting. Gravy recipe was too confusing with all the degreasing and draining. I ended up using just 2-3 cups of liquid from the pan with no additional stock, but gravy still came out running. Also, DON'T add extra salt to gravy, since most of salt from turkey drains into the pan dripping.
