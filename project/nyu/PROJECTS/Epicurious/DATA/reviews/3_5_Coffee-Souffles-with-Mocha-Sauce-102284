This was really bad. It's all egg-whites -- needs flour or something to give it a bit more structure. I checked the recipe to make sure I didn't miss any ingredients. This went in the garbage. I usually have good luck with epicurious recipes that get good ratings: not sure where the disconnect is here.

I love souffles, but had never made before. Texture came out right, but I also found it very sweet (and didn't even make the mocha sauce). I'd probably remove 1 tablespoon of sugar. I filled up 2 10 oz ramekins and probably could have divided the mixture up into 3. Will definitely try this again.

As everyone else said... easy, amazing and looks really fancy. Actually like it plain... no need for the mocha sauce.

I found that I had to use 10oz ramekins since in the 6oz ones it was overflowing so much that I could have made 4 in the 6 oz. it was very good though, seemed like we had more to eat with the same calories!!!

very good, bordering on excellent, but i prefer the warm chocolate souffles on this same page

Too Sweet - I would resuce the amount of sugar to about 3-3.5 tablespoons for the whole recipe, instead of 5 tablespoons as mentioned... Otherwise great!

I have made this recipe at least four times with perfect results. Not only does this taste marvelous, but the presentation makes you look like a master chef in front of your guests. Use the guide to make the sauce and custard in advance. Most helpful.

This recipe was surprisingly fast and simple to make. It also tasted delicious and got rave reviews from my family! I served it with fresh berries in addition to the mocha sauce - yummy!!

How is it that the souffle has 225 calories and 5 grams of fat? I don't see any fat in the ingredients. Mocha sauce is almost zero fat, don't you think?

This is a fast and elegant souffle. I can only wait until it's time to make it again! My husband raved about it and we both savored each and every bite!
