This is the third or fourth time I've made this tart. Every time, it knocks me out how good it is. I love cooking with florals, but they can be tricky. The lavender has enough oomph to assert itself against the chocolate and make itself known, the chocolate pushes back hard enough so the lavender doesn't become overwhelming and soapy. It's always a hit. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

Okay but not impressive. The chocolate tastes like fudge, as another reviewer noted, and the entire dish is so rich, it could easily feed over a dozen people - no one could take more than a few bites! The texture of the crust is definitely the saving grace. It's a great contrast, and I almost want to make it again with 1.5 times the crust, with some of the crust on top. I'm switching to a different dessert for my dinner party, but if I were to serve this, I was thinking iced mint tea and fruit would help balance the sheer chocolate density.

Soooo good & Sooooo easy!!! A KEEPER! I didn't think I'd be able to find the lavander but that worked out too. (the choc. crackers as well!) I figured the only real chance for the lavender was the near by Kitchen store or the health food store. It turns out the health store has jars & jars of spices etc. that if I'd seen listed in a recipe would have made me scoff & move on.

Amazingly good! Ok - I couldn't find lavender so I took advice from others. DH loves orange and dark chocolate so I bought 2 60% cocoa bars with orange (included orange zest in them) and cut back on the chips as appropriate. I also added Grand Marnier when boiling the cream - to taste. You can do anything with the recipe!!! - raspberry, orange, vanilla, coffee...my guests said this was fancy restaurant good! And EASY!

Gets rave reviews each time I make it. The lavender is a wonderful surprise. Embarassingly, I end up using chocolate teddy grahams because that's all I can find, but it tastes great every time!

Aside from how wonderful this tart tasted, I was surprised by how easy it was to make! This is a very rich and decadent dessert, a chocolate lover's dream.

This is a fantastic easy dessert! I made it with normal graham crackers, and it tasted great. This is a wonderful recipe I will make again and again!

Wow! This dessert is phenomenal. I made it exactly the way the recipe called (mixed semi and bittersweet chocolate). I served it cold out of the fridge with hot decaf coffee. I took a sip of coffee after each bite and it cleared my palate for the next. My guest told me the coffee complimented the earthiness of the lavender. He also admired the 'crunchy' crust. Great for a make-ahead dessert. It was just as good the next night.

This tart was so easy to make. I loved the lavender and didn't find it at all overpowering. The supermarket didn't have chocolate graham crackers, so I used low fat honey grahams, which was delicious. If I were to play with other ingredients to substitute the lavender, I would try to make it with rose, or orange peel. I also love that it uses so few ingredients - it really tasted so fresh, and dare I say, healthy!

This tart was excellent and easy to make. The lavender is only a very faint flavor, but it makes this recipe unique. I had some problems getting the last tablespoon of butter to mix in with the chocolate, probably because I didn't give it enough time to mix in. I refrigerated it immediately after and the butter separated from the chocolate and congealed at the top of the tart. I fixed it by melting the tart for six minutes at 250 in the oven. It melted the chocolate and butter just enough so that I could stir the butter back in...not perfect, but it'll do. Probably better to allow the tart to cool at room temperature before putting it in the refrigerator.

this is a very dense and rich chocolate dessert. the lavender gave it almost a minty essence. my one friend said it was like "pms heaven. " it could use a little more presentation but is a very easy, simple, and delicious dessert.

Wow. After scouring the store for organic lavender, inspiration struck and I bought a bar of Dagoba's lavender-blueberry chocolate , which I used for 2 oz of the chocolate. Very sensual, and the crust completely augments the experience of contrast. Wow.

What a wonderful tart recipe! If you make it a day ahead, the lavender is even lovelier. I might try doing some variations with espresso beans or vanilla beans. Dark chocolate chips mixed with the semi-sweet go well too!

This was an excellent chocolate fix. It was very very rich. However I did not put in the lavender and I think it still tasted superb. Everyone in my family Loved it .

This was a wonderful and simple recipe. Without the lavender it would be rather plain and ordinary - don't skip it. It definately makes the dessert.

I usually don't rate a recipe if I haven't followed it exactly, but I thought I would mention that one could eliminate the lavender blossoms, substitute Famous Chocolate Wafers for the choco graham crackers (if hard to find) and have a wonderful and easy, and fairly quick special dessert. I am sure the lavender makes the tart even more special, but if it isn't available, make this anyway. Yum!

I made this almost exactly to the recipe, except I added a touch of rosewater to the lavender-infused cream and chocolate, to add even more floral goodness. It came out amazing. The first of my friends to take a bite of it made a sound I would normally associate with sex, not food. This was like a truffle in tart form: rich, creamy, dense, and heavily chocolatey. Delicious!

I made this in an 11" tart pan, but made adjustments to the measurements (about 1 1/2 times the amounts) and used chocolate wafer cookies for the crust. I made the strawberries with lemon sugar and lavender syrup (with creme fraiche) to go along with it. It was a huge hit! The strawberries gave the dessert a fresher, lighter taste and mirrored the lavender in the tart.

Could not find chocolate graham crackers, so used chocolate wafer cookies instead. Made mini tarts and they turned out great. Did not have any left after our party!

This was outstanding and so easy. I skipped the lavender (hard to find in Wyoming!) and added almond extract to the ganache instead. I also topped it with toasted sliced almonds. I will definitely make this often!!!

Excellent! I made this for Easter for some very sophisticated palates! Everyone loved it! I have had lavender for a little while and have been looking for a recipe to try it out on. I found it! This is so easy but incredible!!!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it got rave reviews. I thought the lavender was a bit strange- it tasted almost minty, but not quite- but I also had a cold, so my taste buds could be off! A pretty easy, quick recipe though. I'd make it again.

I made this for some friends and they loved it. The lavender added a hint of mint to the tart. I am making it again for my family.

I thought this was great and easy! I needed to make a quick dessert for a spur of the moment luncheon I had today. I skipped the lavender because I didn't have any. It was wonderful with a cup of dark roast coffee. Tonight we are going to try it with a glass of Pinot Noir.

It was good but not great. It tastes like your basic chocolate fudge. I added walnuts around the edge to make it more visually appealing. It tasted like a flavoring component was missing -- maybe coffee or orange?

Good but not great. 4 forks for ease, 2 for overall flavor. Seems like it was missing something - maybe next time a dollop of cream with berries will finish it.

Honey ganache in a graham crust? sounds good! Will try it!
