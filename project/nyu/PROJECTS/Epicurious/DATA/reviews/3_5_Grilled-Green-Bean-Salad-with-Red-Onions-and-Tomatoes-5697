I thought this recipe was pretty good but definitely not my most favourite green been recipe - I think I found the dressing overpowering, specifically the balsamic flavour.

tasty and fun, recipe has already been made again as it is a nice easy change of pace for a vegetable option with a summer meal

Very nice. To simplify, I roasted the green beans (didn't blanch) w/the sliced red onions sprinkled on top (450 degrees). When done I added tomatoes & tossed w/ 3/4th of dressing, & let rest. To serve I tossed 1 bag of mixed greens w/simple vinaigrette, then placed beans on top. Served 6 as veggie/salad combo.

Fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing!

This recipe was delicious. I made it with caramelized onions, which definitely lent a sweetness to the dish. Next time, I won't make nearly as much of the dressing as the recipe calls for, as I had lots left over.

I made this dish exactly to the recipe and thought it was one of the best I've had. Will try the carmelized onions next time. With a plethora of fresh green beans from my garden, I am grateful for such a recipe. God Bless Garlic.

The dressing was fantastic. I had no problems roasting the garlic as stated in the recipe. Next time instead of roasting individual cloves I will roast an entire head of garlic- just for ease of preparation. I doubled the recipe and I doubted that it would serve ten, so I added mesclin. Also, I was grateful to know that part of the recipe could be made ahead of time. It was wonderful! I can't wait to make it again.

I made this as one of my contributions to an Easter family gathering and it went over pretty well. There are some points I'd like to share, however, that may be helpful to some. One, the method for roasting the garlic was a failure for me. The last 10 minutes uncovered produced some close-to-charred cloves. I would wrap the garlic cloves and oil in foil and bake for 30 - 40 minutes. The foil keeps the garlic from getting burned (worked fine). Also, the 2nd stage of cooking the beans can be misleading. Some reviewers said they needed more broiler time (I followed their lead) than recommended. I would recommend figuring out how "done" you want your beans and go from there, babysitting them very carefully. Next time I think I'll skip the 1st step of cooking in water and simply roast them. That produces a rich, flavorful bean. I followed one person's advice and slowly caramelized the onions until they were beautifully brown. Nice dish -- just needs an adjustment or two for my taste.

Great side dish. Carmelized the onions and used sliced grape tomatoes. Very picky green bean eaters in the family. They loved it.

Fabulous. Very pretty presentation with excellent flavors! The recipe as is didn't quite serve as many as intended. My guests must have eaten more than their share......I'll double it next time. I broiled the beans with excellent results. It just took a bit longer than written.

Fantastic! Flavors are best when the dish is served at room temperature. Nice advance preparation recipe. I omitted the basil and tomato.

This recipe was a perfect with grilled venison. I broiled the green beans a little longer than called for and they turned out delicious! Will definitely make again, this time for company! Easy to prepare.

This was a perfect recipe to use some of our HUGE harvest of beans and cherry tomatoes. Everyone loved it! I halved the recipe since there would only be 4 of us eating, but we could have eaten the full 12 servings.

I made this dish for a dinner party and sent every guest home with a copy of the recipe! It is fabulous!
