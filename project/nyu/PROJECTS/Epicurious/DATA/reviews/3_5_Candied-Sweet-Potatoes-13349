I just slice yams, put all ingredients in cover well and bake slowly.. it is even better

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. I did add 1/16 tsp each of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. I'll make it again for Christmas for sure, but I plan to add it to weekend menus as well.

I live in Paris and will celebrate Thanksgiving here. I'm taking these delicious sweet potatoes to my friend's house tonight. He is a french chef and I know he will love these as much as I do! I have passed this recipe to friends in Phila and NYC and everyone gives it 4 forks.

I listened and learned from the cooks below (many thanks!) and just used this as a springboard. I precooked the potatoes in the oven for 1 hour in the same dish, then glazed with 1 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c butter, 1/2 c orange juice, and 1 t ginger. The last 5 minutes I sprinkled them liberally with miniature marshmellows. Cooking the sauce in advance would be recommended if you want the sauce to cling to the potatoes but for me, it was fine as a "marinade". Will try reducing the sauce in the future for more cling.

No big deal! I will try the other Candied Sweet Potato recipe on this site next time. The boubon would add an interesting flavor.

Make this and make the kids happy. OK, this is not the most sophisticated recipe. But my godson loves it, as do many of the adults at my Thanksgiving table.

Perhaps I did not do something correctly but the candied glaze seemed to have vanished and so the result was plain sweet potatoes w/ a hint of sweetness.

I was told no marshmallow topping on my sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving, but this recipe was not interesting enough. I need some zip in my food, and creativity in preparation. This was too straight forward for me. The upside is, aside from having to baste these every 15 mins, this recipe could be renamed "sweet potatoes for dummies".

This was terrific. I did make one slight alteration, I added a tsp of maple extract.

I tried out this recipe tonight since I was looking for something different to do with sweet potatoes. They were delicious, but I felt like brushing my teeth right away afterwards--very sugary! Next time I'll add some cinnamon to the syrup. It was a pain in the neck, though, to baste them every 15 minutes, but I will make them again, for they were very good.

If you like sweet, then this is a great dish. It was a perfect accompaniment to roast turkey at our Thanksgiving dinner. The taste was out of this world, and I was happy that this dish ended up being the one next to my place at the table.

This recipe was a great new addition to my family's Thanksgiving dinner. I added the spices per an earlier review- and was very pleased. If you make this a day in advance, I would make some more syrup to add to the dish while reheating.

Quite nice, but there are a lot of good recipes for this type of thing out there. I'm partial to yams so I'll try them... sprinkle some parmesan on top for something a bit different.

Make this for X-Mas dinner each year. Try adding 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves. Haven't had any complaints with these additions in the last 5 years.

It takes awhile to make but it's definately worth it.

Very good, relatively easy to make - still wish my kids would eat it though!

I've made this several times at my familys request. It's the first sweet potatoe recipe my kids will eat - they say they taste like pancakes.
