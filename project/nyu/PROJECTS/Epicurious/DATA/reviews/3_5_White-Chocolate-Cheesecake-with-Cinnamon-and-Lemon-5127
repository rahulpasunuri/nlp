I wasn't very impressed with this cheesecake. The texture was grainy on the first day after refrigeration, but improved a bit on the second day (still a bit grainy though). The flavors were just ok to me. The lemon overpowered the white chocolate.

Having been only a fan of fruity desserts in the past, this one took me by surprise. It is the most decadently delicious cheesecake I have ever made or tasted. The flavour melts on your tongue and slips down your throat, leaving you wanting more. Will I make it again? Only if I can eat the whole thing myself!!

It was just okay - not great. The crust was a bit soggy. Also the texture was a bit grainy. The recipe states to chill overnight uncovered, which I did and I think it dried it out a bit.

I just made this and my husband went crazy for it. I substituted Carr's gingerbread cookies with lemon filling in the crust which turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

Superb recipe, rave reviews from co-workers. Definitely suggest making two days in advance as the cheesecake improved in both taste and texture over a three day period.
