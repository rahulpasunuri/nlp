I used this on grilled veal chops...excellent! You must like goat cheese, however. I make this comment due to some of the poor reviews.

ALWAYS a hit! I've made this many many times and absolutely love it. The goat cheese butter is great on bagels the next day too. Not really sure why anyone would give this a bad rating - unless they don't like the ingredients?

I've made this recipe MANY times and it's always a huge success! The goat cheese butter is more than enough for the recipe, and I've used the leftover as a yummy spread. And you can't go wrong with the cut of steak that you use either, any cut goes with the goat cheese butter. Tonight it's filet, roasted asparagus and quinoa risotto!

Simple way to vary steak. Quick & easy when we got home after a weekend of roughing it so doubly appreciated by me. Leftover butter was great for school sandwiches so will make just the butter form time to time to perk up their lunches. See no need to slice the steaks - let everyone do their own slicing and patting on of the butter and so that the steaks remain warmer while the family is getting to the table.

Use a good cut of meat, and the cooking time varies, but the goat cheese butter was fantastic!! Will definately make again, and again.

Three-and-a-half -- really good and really easy. I had a thicker steak (2.5-3 in.) and it took about 10 minutes per side but was perfectly seared.

This was great, If you like goat cheese you will love this one. The left over butter is great on crackers!

The steak was good, but my boyfriend did NOT like the goat cheese, and to tell you the truth it was a little overpowering. Perhaps cutting down on the amount of cheese in the butter will help. I'll try it again with a lesser amount of goat cheese, but I'm not holding my breath for that to be a resolution.

Excellent and easy! I used new york strips and blue cheese for extra flavor. a wonderful, quick dinner!

We thought this was great! Plus we had a lot of fun digging into the extra goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes before dinner. Can't understand why it wouldn't work for someone who knows they like the ingredients. Use good meat, unsalted butter and soft French goat cheese and capers packed in salt... it has to work!

I wasn't sure how the butter would taste with the steak but an excellent combination. The sundried tomato/caper butter gave the steak a fabulous pizzaz. My dinner guests enjoyed the meal and I'm making it again. The apple/pear crostata is a nice desert to end the meal with.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it on Valentines' day for my boyfriend and he loved it!! It was one of the easiest dishes I've ever made!

Out here in the west we call the rib eye steak a spencer steak. My husband loved this recipe. I thought it was rather easy and I had no trouble making it. We had a Reserve Merlot from Chateau Ste. Michelle which complemented the steak beautifully.

This just didn't quite do it. Sounded good and easy to make, but wouldn't do it again. My dinner guest hated it and did not complete the meal.
