This recipe is so great for entertaining. It's easy to put together, make it ahead of time and serve it up. It's really good the next day too. I've put it with pork dishes, turkey, and beef. It works well with everything. A keeper!

Really liked this recipe and will make it again. We took the advice of the prior raters and used only about half the oil called for - it was just right. We like carmelized onions so we didn't change that - and the balsamic vinegar was a nice touch. Excellent!

Really liked this. I'm always looking for ways to add more vegetables to our meals and it helps to have new recipes. This one went over really well. After reading the other messages, I cut the amount of onion and olive oil by half and it was perfect. Will probably make this at least monthly.

This needs some tweaking. Definitely halve the oil--this dish would be an oleaginous mess with the amount given in the recipe. And I'm in agreement with the reviewer who thought the proportion of onions to green beans out of whack: we're big fans of caramelized onions, but the vast, wormy clumps produced by this recipe overwhelmed the green beans. If you make this ahead of time, I'd recommend keeping it at room temperature rather than on warm; otherwise you'll lose the contrast of textures that's important to the dish. I also added toasted pecan pieces for some additional contrast.

I'm not impressed. I thought the sweetness of the caramellized onions would put this dish over the top. However, the addition of the vinegar and maybe the tarragon, made this too zesty. Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't see how, considering how simple this recipe appears to be.

Loved this for it's simplicity. Okay, I confess I started with frozen French cut green beans, but I swear it was still delicious. I rarely use tarragon, but was really pleased with the flavor it gave this dish. It was unique enough to serve company, yet simple enough for everyday. I'm adding it to my recipe box.

Grill both parts separately in a grill basket on the BBQ. It's smashing!

Afraid I do not agree with the rave reviews - my husband and I love all the ingredients, but in our opinion this recipe resulted in a big ho hum.

While I disagree with the cook from CA on the ratio of onions to green beans (I thought the recipe was perfect as is), he/she is absolutely right about the oil. The couple of tablespoons used to carmelize the onions is more than plenty to coat the green beans. I skipped the additional oil and just tossed everything together with the balsamic. Fabulous. Would definitely make again - especially when entertaining.

Very, very good. We made a huge batch for dinner on Boxing Day, and kept heating it up as we had leftovers. It kept getting better and better, I liked it more as the green beans got a little overcooked, became more mellow.

I love carmelized onions, so I loved this dish. simple. Could be made ahead. I just kept it in corningware and kept warm until dinner.

Hate to be the spoiler but you have to really hate vegetables to love this dish. Green beans are wonderful and caramelized onions are great, but the ratios in this recipe need improvement. Made to recipe....it's a big oily onion mess. I'd double the green beans and only use about 1/4 of the caramelized onions. I'd then use a splash of the dressing. In the original receipe, the oil used just cooking the onions is more than enough to coat the beans.

Best green beans I've ever had. Carmellizing onions is a great thing in my book. Make sure you use a good quality balsamic vinegar, the supermarket brands just aren't the same. Brought them to a friends for Thanksgiving dinner & got rave reviews all around. You can easily cut back on the olive oil if you like.

Great flavors... Room temperature serving option makes this attractive when serving other complex items. Everyone loved it.

I must have done something wrong! All these glowing reviews for a fairly plain dish. I like green beans and this was nice but I did not think that this was spectacular.

Wonderful flavor! Everyone just loved green beans prepared this way. Take the time to get the onions really brown...you won't be sorry!

I made this side dish for a dinner party this past Saturday. It was outstanding. The onions took a bit longer to caramelize (although they never actually "browned" as the recipe says,it was well worth the time. I made this the night before and just warmed it up before serving it the next day and it was still sensational. This is a high-end dish and this recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is easy to make, and quite delicious. Everyone liked it, even those who say they dont care for onions enjoyed the dish. This one is a keeper!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! It was easy to prepare and I liked the fact you could make it ahead of time and reheat it quickly before serving. I think the flavor improves with the increased marinating time. This recipe has now been passed around my family and become a favorite.

I made this for Christmas dinner and my boyfriend loved it. He usually doesn't like vegetables, but this one was a hit. He even took seconds. It was really easy and the onions addded a wonderful sweetness to the beans. Yummy!! Aloha from Maui.

I ranked this a "dish beyond compare" because, for the limited complexity and prep time, it's quite a tasty dish. The carmelzied red onions are oh so sweet, and the beans offer a clean-tasting counterpoint. The balsamic vinegar serves as a nice bridge between the sweet onions and beans. This dish will go into immediate rotation in my kitchen.
