Great dish....love the cucumbers cooked and the coconut milk is a great compliment to them. I actually sauteed my red onions in the pan first til caramelized and added fresh spinach and, ate the dish with a side of rice.

We are always looking for new things to try with cucumbers since we have an abundace in our garden during the summer. So...the sauce was great, 4 stars, cooked cucumbers, I thought were okay, my husband didn't like at all. We had with tuna which was a perfect accompaniment. We would definitely make again without cucumbers.
