Made it the way it is written and everyone loved it.

Nice combination of flavors and textures. I felt the dressing was a bit heavy with 1/2 cup of olive oil and needed more acid, so next time I might add more vinegar or maybe some lime juice and reduce the amount of oil.

I would give it five forks if I could! Took it to our Supper Club dinner on Friday and was a huge success. Fabulous combo of sweetness from the jicama, crunch and saltiness from the cojita cheese, and the dressing was simply delish (think that next time I would make extra and pour a little over grilled fish or chicken). The only alteration I made was to add a scant 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to the dressing, for a little extra kick, and I lightly blended the dressing with an immersion blender (don't overblend it or you'll lose the "leafy" look of the cilantro). Outstanding recipe and definitely a keeper.

I substituted avocado for the radish since my children won't eat radish. This recipe was excellent. We served it alongside fish tacos and it was a hit with everyone.

Wonderful salad. I used spinach and white balsamic vinegar, which worked well. I would add a little less jicama next time.

An amazing combination of flavors. I added one firm ripe mango but otherwise followed the recipe. Will be making this one again!

I made this without cheese and its just divine! The recipe is simple, as is production, and this gives me a wonderful reason to buy jicama and radishes. Great alone or with spicy meat.

I shredded the jicama and radishes. I served this for a friend who is from Monterrey Mexico and he went back for seconds. He said it was great!

This is such a light and flavorful salad. My daughter is making the dressing right now as a dip for jicama just to snack on. Yum! I used spiced pepitas from another recipe and it made the salad extra good.

This is a very fresh and delicious salad. I thought the cumin would make it heavy, but it is lovely and was enjoyed by all.

I've made this salad several times now for dinner parties and it's one of my favorite finds on the site. Simple, but exquisite -- in unexpected ways. It is light and crisp and is an excellent start to lend freshness to a heavier Mexican meal.

Terrific salad. Wonderful variety of flavors and textures. The crunch of the jicama, the creaminess of the cheese, and the nuttiness of the seeds. Yum. Paired it with grilled Jerk chicken and mango chutney (from this site) and it was the perfect summer meal. This will become a frequent offering at my table.

i didn't realize until the last minute that i was out of olive oil so i used grapeseed oil - am thinking it would be much better next time with the olive oil as the dressing seemed a little "meek" - will definately give it another go.

Wonderful flavor combination, textures, and color! Added thinly sliced red onions because I had some. My husband is a "regular dinner salad" kinda guy and he loved it. Next time, I'll probably do a real emulsion with the dressing (i.e., blend all ingredients except oil in blender, then slowly stream in oil with blender running).

I used Daikon radish and it was a little too bitter the first day, but after a night in the fridge in the dressing it was delicious. I used papaya, and would probably prefer this salad with mango or pineapple. We also used grilled turkey breast with a curry rub for the meal version of the salad, and it was an excellent accompaniment to the salad.

Very good! The salad dressing was much better the second day. I used butter lettuce which went very well with the other ingredients.
