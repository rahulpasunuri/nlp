This is our go to recipe for mushroom soup. I add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg & 1/4 tsp of paprika for a slight depth of flavor. The soup is even better the second day. Typically I use all chicken broth, that's what I have on hand. I use 20 oz of regular mushrooms for the base & another 20 oz (sauteed) for after the soup has been pureed, with a garnish of Fage Greek yogurt. The soup's even better if the mushrooms are slightly brown & not fresh. Nice to have a flourless cream soup, as well.

Definitely better than anything you could find in a can, but not that exciting--thought it was a bit bland. I doubled the cream, added some salt, and used cremini mushrooms, but wasn't thrilled with the result.

Very good and creamy taste. It is a great recipe. I thought it was smart with just a bit of whipping cream and some rice to cut off the heavy taste it might have.

This is far and away the best cream of mushroom soup recipe I've tried. I'm a die hard mushroom lover and have tried them all. If it is too brothy, then you might not have blended it enough. Works best to use an immersion blender if you have one, or you might have needed to cook it down more. As for the use of button mushrooms, there is no reason to limit yourself if you feel the flavor is lacking. I've used a variety of combinations of available mushrooms and it is always delicious. You want to be sure to use a good flavor broth, and you absolutely need both beef & chicken to make it turn out right. I've made it at least a dozen times, and I've never been disappointed.

So-so. As for the leeks, I like potato and leek soup better, and this version of cream of mushroom soup is pretty plain since you're using button mushrooms and sauteing them. I didn't like the beef broth because I thought it was trying to put flavor where there isn't really any. I have a better recipe for cream of mushroom soup that uses oven roasted crimini mushrooms instead.

I love this soup, Cream of Mushroom is one of my favorites. I will make it again. I did not use rice instead I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not add leeks, used scallion onion and added Fresh Thyme as well.

This soup is amazing. I am part of a soup exchange at work and I made this for 3 others there. everyone loved it. I also made this for my boyfriend and my doorman had some too and they both really enjoyed it as well. I did add a little bit more rice and upped the mushrooms to 2.5 lbs. I also added more broth at the end to thin it out a bit.

I have added a little salt and fresh ground pepper and as another reviewer mentioned, after blending all together I added finely chopped portabello mushrooms sauteed in 1 tablespoon of butter; final touch by adding some sour cream; will make it again

Fantastic! I used a combo of button and portabello mushrooms, plus only pureed maybe 2/3 of the batch, stirring in the remainder. My husband and daughter had two bowls each!

Actually, rice is necessary - it's starch. Sometimes they sell it in powder form to thicken up desserts and soups like this. It's what helps make "cream" of mushroom soup creamy, not soupy. You could probably use a potato for your starch instead of rice. I liked it much. I added the salt and white pepper while it was cooking - before adding milk(there's no stock or canned broth around here). I worked around it loosely, probably halving the recipe, since there was only 1 leek, I cut up the green with the white. sprinkled with some nutmeg , and voilà! a healthy change in winter. I would have given it four forks, but my enthousiasm may be due to my current hunger, so I'm trying to be fair

I was disappointed because for a cream soup the consistency was rather thin. It was too brothy. Otherwise the flavor was good. I used it on the Atkins diet.

This was quick and easy. I would make it again.

I really loved this. I sauteed an extra 1/2 lb of minced baby portobello mushrooms in a Tbsp of butter for about 10 minutes and added to the finished soup, for that mushroom texture. Delicious. Otherwise, made it exactly as written, if your mushrooms are good it needs no other flavors.

I think this is an excellent soup. I didn't add the sherry as some readers recommended cause I didn't have it....next time. I can't help but think that this soup would be a good base for another soups. Something that meat in it...maybe beef cubes....it would ehance the experience.

This was delicious. I had planned to add milk instead of cream, but it was so good when it came out of the blender that i decided to leave it as it was, and did not add anything else.

How embarrassing, I was adding my review for the Beer Cheese Soup on this site.I apolgize. Anyways, try that rcipe. This recipe I am making at the moment and appreciate you reviews.

This soup is one of my favorites. My husband and brother- in-law constantly request I make this soup. I choose not to use leeks, I do not think they add much flavor.Also, at times I will substitute potatoes instead of using carrots. Also, I like to use smoke cheddar cheese for the flavor. This is a great dish!

Yum! I am using this as a smother for some steaks, and it is really great. Instead of using canned broth, I used some homemade broths which are thicker and have a lot of flavor. This is great, and my house smelled so good when I was making it!

I was so excited to make this. I used a slow cooker and simmered it all day. It tasted like mud soup. I love mushrooms, but this recipe was a real let down.

This soup was good (I too made without rice) but definately was missing something. I added some fresh thyme and very dry sherry and it was better, but still tasted like it was missing something. My husband loved it...

I made this dish last night as the first course to our Valentine's Day dinner. I omitted the rice and used a mix of button, portobello and dried exotic mushrooms with some added fresh thyme. It was worth the extra flavor--it was a nice rich broth. I decided to use a hand blender to puree the soup and I wouldn't do it again--it would have been much better to puree half to smoothness and leave the rest with pieces--my texture was too grainy. Would definitely make again--would even be good with milk instead of cream.

The leeks were a great addition, but the rice not at all necessary. I only puréed part of it, and think that made a better soup. The vegetable broth I used worked out fine, too. I also halved it, which worked well -- and still made quite a lot of soup.

My husband and I loved this soup - will have it again and again. I added salt while cooking mushrooms, then ground black pepper. There was no mention of either in the recipe, not even "to taste"; without them, it would definitely be "bland".

The leeks were a great addition, but the rice seemed, and was, unnecessary. I only puréed part of it, and think that made a better soup; ditto with the addition of a handful of dried porcini and oyster mushrooms. The vegetable broth I used worked out fine, too. I also halved it, which worked well -- and still made quite a lot of soup.

It was really delicious and easy to make. I used light cream instead of heavy cream, and I think I prefer it.

Creamy mushroom flavor. I think I'll add fresh tarragon next time I make it. Very simple and easy to make. Worth the time and effort.

I am not the best of cooks, but this recipe was easy and it turned out really good. I added a little more garlic and used 1\2 brown and 1\2 button mushrooms, and a dash of dried basil.

I can't believe anyone would say this recipe is tasteless. For someone who loves mushrooms this is the best. I used onions instead of leaks and half crimini half white button mushrooms. Delicious.

the rice interferes with the taste of the mushrooms. I wanted a concentrated mushroom flavor, not a rice soup. Very disappointing to me.

I served this soup to vegetarian friends followed by manicotti and salad. I used shallots instead of leeks, and overall thought the soup had a wonderful rich mushroom flavor. I didn't really think it needed any other herbs, and my husband and I finished the leftovers with some fresh bread the next day. I thought it might be fun to try some truffle oil with the recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe. However, we had made some slight alterations. Instead of two pounds of buttton mushrooms, I used only half (one pound)and one pound of shitakes. I didn't have any leeks, so I substituted scallions. Excellent! Yummy!

Hi, I used sherry for more flavor, used canned portobello mushrooms, and used ev. milk to cut the fat. A little spice such as tarragon, or something would be nice also.

Rating: 1
OK, but after my boyfriend and I each had one small bowl we tossed the leftovers. Not very flavorful even with the addition of tarragon.

a rich and satisfying soup but i found the flavor greatly benefited from the addition of a goodly amount of tarragon. if leeks are not conveniently available, onions also seem to do quite well.
