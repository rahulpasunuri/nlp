These potatoes have become a stable at my dinner parties. I add a bit more heavy cream and gruyere for a more cream consistency and top them with freshly grated parmesan cheese. There are never any left!

I actually followed the recipe and it was great! I don't think this would be good with cinnamon, onions, and cheddar though. It made just over 12 and making these in a muffin tin was a nice presentation and added to its charm.

Good recipe. We coarse grated the potatoes and added onions. Used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I would just bake them in a casserole dish rather than the cupcake pan next time. A lot of work and made way more than 12. Also used grated sharp cheddar since we had to use what we had in the pantry! Will make it again.
