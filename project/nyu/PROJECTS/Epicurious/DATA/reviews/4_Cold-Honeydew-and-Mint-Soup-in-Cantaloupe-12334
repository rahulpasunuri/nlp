Just made this with a perfectly sweet cantaloupe for lunch and a group of 10 year old girls loved it! I used apple mint which is a bit more subtle and strained it after pureeing- so the soup was lovely and foamy smooth. I will make this for a June dinner party for certain.

I've been making this since it appeared in Gourmet, and I love it. I'm taking it as my course tonight for a dinner party, and I think the others will like it as well. It's cooling, a little exotic, and healthy to boot.

I did a variation of this for Mother's Day brunch where I made the Honeydew soup (with honey instead of sugar) in addition to a soup of Cantaloupe and ginger like the honeydew soup. Then I poured both soups into the same bowl at the same time so that it was half and half, and served immediately.

I'm afraid I have to differ with the others: this turned out to be a putrid dark green color after it chilled over night, and the taste was just weird. As one guest put it, "this is more interesting than good." Next time, I'll serve honeydew wedges to start, or the Blueberry Soup on this site, which is delicious.

this is the best way to use a honeydew with a nice taste but bad texture. the mint and lime go really nicely with the honeydew. yummy!

Refreshing on a hot summer day. The perfect way to use up all the extra mint in your garden.

I made this soup for company on a hot summer day and everyone loved it. My friend immediately asked for the recipe and my husband wants me to make it for his parents next week. We ate it after a long hot walk and it was very perfectly refreshing

This dish is like...liquid springtime. It is so fresh and clean and light. I had this first at a dinner party to celebrate a friend's engagement, and I was so happy to find it on Epicurious. I made it last night and my honeydew wasn't as fragrant as it could have been, so I added a few tablespoons of Midori and the end product was great. You couldn't tell I'd fudged the melon flavor at all. I also served it in flutes, garnished with raspberries (which I happened to have) mint, and small dollop of vanilla frozen yogurt. Made me look like a real cook! Very, very impressive, and got rave reviews. And it is *sooo* very simple. This one is definitely on the "keeper" list.

Liked this one a lot. I did modify. I used 2 1/2 melons, cantaloupe and honeydew, and added a little salt to the blend. I served the soup at the end of the meal, after chiles rellenos, in chilled margarita glasses rimmed with salt and garnished with mint and a little minced red jalepeno. Visually impressive, unusual, and quite a hit. Definitely leave time to chill. I'll make it a day before serving next time.

Melon soup is a surprise and a delightful challange. Serving it in a melon is also a visual stimulous. Sort similar to a delightful dollop of sour cream sprinkled with your choice of greenery. Like Medori love this soup.
