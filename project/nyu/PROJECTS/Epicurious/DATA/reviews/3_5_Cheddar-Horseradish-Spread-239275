I made this recipe for a large cocktail party. There must have been 7 dips available and this was the clear favorite. Definitely make it close to serving time because it does get loose as it sits from the water in the radishes. I served it with pita chips (brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and baked) It was really yummy!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. The flavors are really lovely and it comes together very quickly. However, I made one big mistake - I made it the night before thinking I would let the flavors meld. Unfortunately, the radishes "wept" overnight and I was left with a somewhat soupy mixture! I will definitely make this again though and if I prepare it ahead of time will add the radishes at the last minute. I might also grate the cheese a bit more finely so that the mixture holds together more.
