4 stars for tasty and EASY! This recipe is so simple and so delicious, I make it frequently. I can keep a nice supply of these little hens in the freezer. The sauce is perfect.

Ok, but nothing exceptional. The hens were very moist, and spice rub and sauce go together well, but because the spicing is only on the skin, the interior meat ends up a bit bland.

Made this for Christmas Dinner. huge hit. used about 3 times the spice rub and half the garlic, but otherwise followed the prep notes. will make it again for our friends for new years.

Made this with Organic whole chicken. Easily one of the best recipes for chicken I have ever made! I fill the cavity of the chicken with a whole onion, 1/2 lemon, and kosher salt. Use the spice rub generously. Absolutely tender and flavorful -- completely easy to make.

I thought this recipe was good, but didn't like the combo of the yogurt sauce with the chicken. Each individually was good, but thought that together they were not a match.

This was a great recipe and easy to follow. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use my spice grinder, so I had to use already ground cumin and coriander and I adjusted the measurement as best as I could. Next time I'm going to toast the seeds. The cucumber yogurt sauce was delicious. I served this with the Spiced Basmati Rice and it was a perfect accompaniment.

Finger lickin' good! This was very simple to make. I used a whole chicken instead of Cornish game hens since I can't find them in Singapore. I also threw in some aluminum-wrapped potatoes onto the same baking pan so that we can have baked potatoes. The yogurt sauce is delicious.

Excellent as written. The spice rub/yogurt sauce combination was a yin/yang experience and everyone voted to include it in the "winner" notebook.

This was a simple recipe and absolutely delicious. Got rave reviews from my friends. Will definitely keep it as a favorite recipe. The contrast between the spice rub and the cucumber yogurt sauce was perfectly balanced.

Oustanding and easy as well as inexpensive. Served with a little rice and it was delish.

Amazing, simple, and incredibly juicy. Be generous with the spice rub and make sure to monitor the temperature of the hens as this will ensure a perfectly cooked bird. I've made this about once a week since I first tried it.

DELICIOUS and sooo easy! The sauce is definitely garlicky, as one reviewer said, but I like garlic. I roasted on 400 for 30 minutes and that was plenty. Otherwise, I think the dish would have overcooked.

This was really exceptional and way too easy! The cornish hens were perfectly seasoned, although next time I'll roast them a little less. The sauce was perfect, but i did add a little more cilantro and sour cream. I served with isreali couscous that had some onions and dried fruit cooked in. yum!

This was a very yummy recipe. I did, however, find the sauce a bit too garlicky. I would reduce the garlic next time. I think this sauce would also be excellent over a whole chicken or chicken pieces prepared with the same spice combination. I like a lot of sauce with my meat, so I doubled the recipe for the sauce.
