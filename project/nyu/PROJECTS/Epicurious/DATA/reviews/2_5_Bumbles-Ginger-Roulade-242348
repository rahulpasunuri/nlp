This one definitely could use a few modifications, but came out really quite nice. After reading the previous two reviews, I took a few tips, but ultimately kept it simple. Decrease the molasses to ½ cup and increase butter by one tablespoon to compensate for the loss of moisture. Chop the ginger as the recipe says, but to the cream add 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar (or more if you like it sweeter) and one tablespoon of brandy. I ended by brushing the top with some more brandy AND lightly dusting it with confectioners sugar. Nothing but compliments on this unique dessert. A definite success!

I have been a long- time subscriber to Gourmet and have never made anything from the magazine I thought was awful - until now. I was expecting a spice cake or gingerbread cake. It's neither. The cake has a molasses aftertaste - no spice, just molasses.The whipped cream filling is dull - needs to be sweetened. I tried it both original recipe and with turbinado sugar. Didn't add much improvement. I won't bother even trying to doctor this one. Not worth it.

Made this for a dinner party and my guests LOVED it because of it's uniqueness, especially the Roulade. After cooling in the pan I left on parchment paper and covered with plastic wrap and was still able to fill and roll the next day. Whipping cream and adding chunks of candied ginger seemed strange as it would be chewy and the cream would not be flavored. Instead I heated ginger in 1/4 cup water until just boiling, drained and cooled. Then added ginger with 3/4 cup heavy cream to food processor and 1/4 cup french brandy. Place in refridgerator to cool. Then whip 1 cup heavy cream with 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar depending on how sweet you like it. Then add cooled ginger puree to whipping cream. Spread on roulade and roll it up. I skipped the confectioner's sugar and brushed outside with more brandy. Let it chill for about an hour in fridge.
