Fantastic. I love raw oysters but for cooked ones this is my favourite. I save the really good coleville bay oyster for raw and the more usual oysters for this.

NYE staple at our house. An oyster shucking knife is a good way to avoid the trip to the ER. I would highly recommend one.

I thought this recipe was really good. I am planning on making it again sometime.

An excellent, if very rich appetizer. I will make it again. As all of you know, however, wear a leather glove on you non knife hand while shucking. Our dinner was interupted by a trip to the clinic for sutures.

I made this dish on my honeymoon and on our first anniversary, and I'm making it again tonight, on our second anniversary. It is my husband's favorite food, bar none.

This is the BEST oyster appetizer I have come across. I have even substituted cashews for the hazelnuts. It's exceptionally easy, everything can be thrown into the food processor, et voila, pesto. Everyone who has tried this loves it, even those who don't like oysters. Makes for great sopping after the oysters are gone too! I highly recommend this dish.
