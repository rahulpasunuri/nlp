I love this recipe! I used Trader Joe's pesto which comes in a small jar and used a whole jar on about 8 of their thawed frozen chicken tenders. I mixed it in a bowl with their grated fresh parmesan, and added about a teaspoon of garlic powder. I cut slits in the breasts, coated it well with the mixture, marinated in the fridge for about an hour, then baked it in my toaster oven. I didn't add more oil, but did add more Parmesan to the top about 1/2 way through cooking. I served it on top of a jar of shredded artichoke hearts and steamed asparagus. A new go-to recipe, all the ingredients are at Trader Joes!

I thought this was just so so. If you want a couple great and easy chicken recipes, I suggest you try a couple other recipes from this site: Parmesan chicken (105912) or chicken breasts with goat cheese and rosemary. Both are awesome and easy.

Yummy! I followed the recipe and took suggestions from other reviews. I used boneless/skinless breasts, cut the center lenghtwise and filled the cavity with pesto/cheese mixture then spread mixture over entire chix. Lining the bake sheet with aluminum foil was genius. I sprayed PAM on top instead of drizzling olive oil (let's face it, this dish isn't low cal)and all was well. Easy on the last 10 minutes. My total done time was 21 minutes at that high temp.

I never recommend changing recipes drastically and then reviewing them, but i was out of pesto with no time to get any. I used boneless skinless breasts, cut a pocket in each, and filled them with a mixture of oil-packed sundried tomatos that i processed with a little olive oil, a few cloves a garlic, and stirred the cheese into. I followed the directions re: coating with parm, then followed the baking instructions but didn't add the extra oil. The chicken was very good, a tiny bit dry but I didn't let them marinate at all. I served with whole wheat angel hair with a little of the sundried tomato mixture stirred in. Next time I will also add goat cheese to the stuffing. So in other words I didn't make this recipe, but it was a great help in inventing my new one!!

This is a tasty dish that is easy to make, but was nothing spectacular. I think the main issue here is that the pesto tends to overwhelm everything else, which is fine if you like pesto, but I too had trouble detecting the parmesan. As well, I found that you need much less parmesan than the recipe calls for if you're only going to coat the bottom of each breast with the cheese. Next time I might go for less pesto, more parmesan, and perhaps the addition of nuts, sliced red peppers, or spices such as sage or paprika to differentiate the flavors.

Very simple and tasty recipe. Good weeknight recipe, using prepared pesto, purchased fresh (deli) grated parm, and boneless skinless breasts. Spread the pesto on the breast and press on lots of parm, then adjust your timing to accommodate the boneless breasts. Though the pesto does create quite a bit of oil in the pan, the parm crisped up quite nicely for me. This recipe is not overwhelmingly creative, but it does have lots of flavor and is quick and easy enough to pull off when you want something a little bit special and have no time to get fancy. Served with sauteed spinach and roasted yukon gold potatoes.

I made this recipe recently and instead of using chicken breasts I used turkey breasts. I was a little skeptical how it would taste, but it came out delicious. My friend even asked for the recipe.

This sure smelled terrible when in owen, yet it turned out very good. I couldn't taste the parmesan at all, but as I followed the instructions and put the pesto under the skin there was a subtle pesto flavor. Next time I will cut a pocket for the pesto and take of the skin. I don't know, however, how I will make the parm more pronounced.

I thought I would have crispy golden chicken breasts with lots of flavour from the cheese and pesto. What I got was something green that was semi-baked semi-braised. The only way to brown it (guests were getting hungry) was to broil for a few minutes on each side. I would only make again with changes. The chicken refused to brown because it kept draining its liquid in the tray, I had to keep opening the oven and draining. Also there was so much oil seeping out of the pesto coating (I used homemade pesto), next time i will try to squeeze as much oil as possible out of the pesto before using it. The third problem I admit is my mistake, I was trying to save money by using supermarket-kind grated parmesan. I'm sure the real thing would add a lot more flavour.

Delicious and sooo easy! A dish I crave often now. Homemade pesto is key, and as suggested by another reviewer, stuffing the breast slightly with pesto helps infiltrate the flavor. Sauteed veggies (zucchini or eggplant) are a perfect side dish.

What a fabulous, simple recipe! Halfway through cooking, I used the oil and juices that had drained off from the chicken to spoon over the top. There was no need to add additional olive oil. This recipe has now been added to my permanent collection of favorite dishes. It's really fun to experiment with different types of pesto. The last time I prepared this dish, I used a lemon artichoke pesto that was absolutely amazing!

I used fresh basil pesto (see several good recipes is from this site) and boneless chicken breasts. I thought it was good, but nothing I would rush to make again. Also, be sure to cover your baking pan with foil to avoid a messy clean-up!

This dish was wonderful! My husband and I thought it a fabulous way to dress up a weekday chicken plate. It was so flavorful! I halved the recipe, and added a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and garlic powder to the parmesan cheese used for coating the chicken. I will definately make this dish again! Yum!!

I had boneless/skinless breasts (not thin cutlets).Since my chicken had no skin I cut a pocket into breast half and put about a tablespoon of homemade pesto into the cavity. Then, with olive oil on both sides of the chicken, I dipped it into the cheese (to which I had added some dried herbs, salt and paprika). It was very good and everyone who had it liked it.

This recipe is outstanding. I've been making it for years, and last night for the first time, put the chicken on the grill. It was terrific!

Followed the advice of previous reviewer and stuffed pounded breasts with spinach and (this time) bleu cheese. My pesto is also homemade from my summer basil crop. Be careful not to overcook. I cooked it at 425 for 20 min. and then covered until we were ready to eat. I'll never cook plain old parmesan chicken again.

This is one of the tried and true stand-bys in my house. Never had a complaint! Perfect for a quick, but delicious, weeknight dinner.

My husband just raved about this recipe. I used my own pesto that was made this past summer and frozen in ice cube tray then packed in zip-lock bags. This was just delicious and I also didn't add extra oil after cooking 10 minutes. Definitely will make this again!

The recipe is so simple and the chicken was very moist. Thanks for the suggestions. I did not add the extra oil, I just used the oil in the bottom of the pan and spooned it over. I thought it was a little salty and would use less cheese, but no one else thought it was salty. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. A wonderful meal and so easy

I modified this recipe. I mixed italian herbs,bread crumbs and parmesan cheese; I then melted butter in a stainless steel roasting pan in the oven, mixed the ingredients and breaded the chicken. I baked the chicken on both sides and added more cheese on the top(after I turned the chiken once). Delicious, try it.

This was a great change of pace and easy way to dress u chicken breasts. Turns our just a tad oily, but draining the excess off is easy. I've made it four times now.

Very dissapointed with this recipe. I used thin cutlets chicken breast, and pesto sauce from a store. After dipping the chicken in the pesto, I pressed both sides of the chicken in the parmesan cheese. The result was a ton of oil! Had to put chicken in a new pan half way through. Despite the oileness though, the taste was really nothing special. Much better recepes in epicurious.

Fabulous recipe! I'd definitely make this again .. Pretty simple, not to mention the wonderful aroma it sent throughout the kitchen! I'd recommend serving this with a side of cous-cous, to balance out the saltiness of the pesto & cheese.

Excellent, and I added quite a bit. I used boneless, skinless chicken, and pounded it to 1/4 inch thick. Separately, I mixed roughly 3/4 cup steamed spinach (frozen would work), 1/2 - 3/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese, and 1 tbsp of the pesto/parmesan combo. After coating each breast with the remaining pesto/parm mixture as per above recipe, I spooned a tablespoon of the spinach/gorgozola mix in the center, then rolled up each breast before placing it in a baking dish and following refrigeration/baking directions as above. One note: remember to separate rolled breasts so that each bakes on all sides. I didn't and had to cook 10 more minutes at 325 degrees so that the sides weren't raw. Truly delicious in the end, though!

Yummy! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I make my own pesto and freeze it, so didn't have to use store-bought. Added extra parmesan half way through and drizzled a LITTLE oil from the bottom of the pan over that. (Thanks to previous reviewers for the tips and alternatives.) Crispy top, moist chicken, great flavor.

This recipe was a refreshing change from other chicken recipes and enjoyed by all (with the exception of some 4 and 6 ye olds!). Very simple to make and delicious. We too used skinless breasts but did not see a need for the olive oil drizzle... the prepared pesto seemed to be a little oily.

A fabulous recipe, which worked very well with skinless, boneless breasts. A few minutes under the broiler at the end added some crispiness. I served this dish with rigatoni and sundried tomato sauce, and a dry red wine.

This was delicious! I made it for a bithday celebration with a greek salad and foccacia(sp?) bread. However, next time I am going to make it with boneless chicken breasts; I think it would be better with the flavors of the pesto and cheese.

Fantastic! Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added extra parmesan halfway through baking before drizzling with olive oil. Finished off baking with a 5-minute broil. Permanent addition to my recipe file. Also completely legal on the Atkins diet.

Yummy! Because I was so short on time, I had to improvise a bit one night...I coated the boneless/skinless chicken with olive oil and rubbed it with the pesto. Let it sit at room temperature for an hour and put some shredded parmesan/mozzarella cheese on top of it before I put it in the oven. Turned out just fine.

The Parmesan-Crusted Chicken breasts were outstanding! If you like cheese you will love this dish. Not only was it easy to prepare but very few ingredients were used. I altered the recipe by using skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and mixing the pesto and fresh Parmesan in a bowl. I took each chicken breast and covered it in olive oil then "breaded" each piece with the cheese mixture.

A quick and easy recipe that yields a juicy chicken breast as long as it's not overcooked. The quality of the purchased pesto makes a difference. Would also be good with homemade parsley, thyme or cilantro pesto. I used pecorino cheese as it's what I had on hand.
