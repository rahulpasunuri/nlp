very good, but the proportions are incorrect: you need to reduce the masa harina to 1 cup, although you will only be able to make 6 to 8 tamales. Unusual, slightly sweet. I made mine ahead (fully cooked) and froze them. I then thawed them and resteamed them for 30 minutes, and they were very good.

MOST Ashkenazic authorities have added the following foods (kitniyot) to the prohibited list: rice, corn, millet, legumes (beans, peas; however, string beans are permitted). Sephardic authorities PERMIT the use of all of the above. Consult your Rabbi for guidance in the use of any and all these products. Great Flavor and nice and light. Great twist on the traditional tamales. A big hit with everyone! And again please consult your Rabbi before passing judgement on whether this is Passover or not. For some no, for others, it's ok.

Just a note to Epicurious: corn and corn meal (including masa harina) are strictly fobidden during Passover, so this recipe could not be made as suggested for Passover.
