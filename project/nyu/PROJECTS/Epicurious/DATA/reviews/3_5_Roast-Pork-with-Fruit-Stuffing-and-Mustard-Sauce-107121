Brined the boneless pork roast in a salt/brown sugar/fennel seed brine and soaked a mix of dried cherries, apples and cranberries in port. Seasoned fruit with rosemary and fennel, and rubbed the roast with rosemary. Definitely worked...

Made this for a family dinner and it was a hit. I would recommend starting to watch the meat temp after about an hour to ensure it doesn't dry out. Also the gravy was very good, wouldnt change anything.

Terrific! I used a boneless pork roast; the dried fruit kept the meat moist and tender. I also used some chopped rosemary along with salt and pepper to season the roast.

Awesome. This was a hit a christmas dinner. Pretty easy to prepare. Have you butcher cut a pocket in the meat and then tie after stuffing. Much easier and can get more fruit in meat. I used apricots, cherries and cranberries. Very pretty when cut.

I ended up using tenderloin instead of a roast and dried cranberries instead of prunes, but it was awesome! The sauce was perfectly mellow even though it has strong mustards, and it complemented the pork very nicely.

Meat was very tender and had good flavor. I included diced apple with the fruit and some fresh sage with the carrots and onions in the roasting pan. Sauce was excellent!

Made this for New Years with the immediate family. It was OK overall. The roast cooked faster than the recipe indicated so I would recommend checking it within the hour as I did. It was quite flavorful but at the same time subtle. I really did not like the sauce. I would not make it again. The stuffing was great. The sauce seemed to be at war with it and not in pleasant contrast as I had hoped.

I made a variation on this last night and it was AMAZING. I used boneless pork loin, spiraled it open into a flat piece, coated outside and inside with a mixture of salt, pepper, marjoram and whole plain yogurt. (Don't worry about the yogurt, it seemed to seal in all the moisture and there was no yogurty taste or smell) I then stuffed the inside with dried apples, prunes, cherries and apricots (all unsweetened and unsulfured)that had soaked in the wine for a few minutes. I rolled it up, tied and baked slow at about 275 degrees. It was absolutely awesome. I used a pretty lean loin and it was juicy and delicious. The downside of the lack of fat and bones was that the pan drippings were nominal. Also, the veggies seemed to keep it from cooking evenly, so id just bake with veggies around it rather than underneath or perhaps with a thin layer of onion underneath for flavor. Also, I would use a little less mustard in the sauce. Thanks so much! Hope more of you try this one - its awesome!

Gotta have the cherries! The flavors blend very nicely without overwhelming the pork. We all liked the sauce but agreed that it was a little heavy. I think I'll try it with corn starch rather than flour next time. There WILL be a next time!

I make this dish all the time - so easy to prepare and great for a nice Wed. night meal or if you're entertaining a crowd! I use a pork tenderloin and stuff w/cranberries, apricots, and cherries. The sauce is wonderful - a nice compliment to the sweetness of the fruit. Even my 2 year old eats it!!!

Delicious. The only variation was that I used a boneless roast instead of on the bone. It was fabulous. The sauce was nice and softly tangy against the sweet fruit. A superb contrast.

Made this dish for my Mom's B-day dinner in Oct 2004, it is AMAZING. At first I was a bit leary about the idea of stuffing the pork with fruit, but it is just fabulous!!! Not only did I use the dried prunes and apricots as the recipe suggested, I also took the hints from the other reviews and added the dried cherries as well. I soaked them in cherry brandy first and then stuffed the pork with them. The flavour is in one word...AMAZING... I also added white wine to the basting sauce as the pork roasted and the sauce was nothing short of just FABULOUS!!!! This is one of the best pork dishes ever! And the presentation is truly grand!

This is an outstanding recipe that is not difficult, especially if you have your butcher prepare your roast and insert the hole for the fruit. The gravy is out of this world. Our gourmet dinner club featured this for a fall harvest dinner and it met with rave reviews. I have made it myself several times for friends and family and always had it turn out well. I would highly recommend this recipe.

PS. Made it with the tenderloain and grilled it. It was Fab!! Restaurant quality. Upgrading my rating. Original Posting: While this was good, it wasn't great. It was certainly a nice, easy and different way to prepare pork. But it really doesn't deserve four forks. Since I love the combo of pork and fruit, and it was relatively easy, I'm going to make it again even though I only gave it 2 forks. I also would suggest adding more fruit (fewer prunes--and I happen to love them--and definitely more cherries!). I just butterflied my rack, and it worked fine (in fact, I think you can get more fruit in there that way). However, I'm going to try a tenderloin next time for ease of serving and see what happens. Lastly, I had almost NO pan drippings, so the veggies were a bit dry. Next time I'll add them about 15-20 min after the meat goes in.

Delicious dish. I put a lot more fruit in the middle about 2x. Looked great when it is carved. Great to seve "family style" because it does look so nice on the platter and the fruit and meat come together without a separate compote to go around the table. Very tasty.

Rating: 4
This was an eyefilling and well as palate pleasing dish. I used a boneless loin of pork. My husband carved a small hole but by really packing in the fruits it expanded beautifully. I used a larger assortment of fruits than called for. Also instead of wine I used some balsamic vinegar in the sauce. I think this a recipe that can stand up to a lot of improvisation. A winner.

This has become an often repeated favorite in my house. I too add more fruit and marjoram. The vegetables are wonderful served with rhe pork. This dish is sublime.

I have just made this for the second time for a large dinner party. I used four 4-rib racks. My butcher butterflied the meat and I rolled the apricots and prunes inside, using about double the amount of fruit called for. I also seasoned the inside of the meat with marjoram, salt and pepper. We then rolled the pork and tied each rib section. I think it roasted for about an hour. I took it out of the oven when my temperature probe read 142 degrees. It came out so good that I increased my previous rating from 3* to 4*.

Cooking in Houston - Have made this several times and is always a crowd pleaser. Am cooking this again this weekend. YUMMY!

I've made this several times - usually with a cc tenderloin, I tie it (for even roasting) and then pan sear the outside on all sides. And other dried fruits work great too - I've used cranberries and cherries, both with great results. Also I coat the outside with with the herbs de provence...you can play alot with this recipe.

Used Figs and golden raisins in addition to apricots and prunes. Soaked thenm for a day in Armangac. Got a 5 Lb., 7 rib pork roast, butterflied the roast then stuffed the center with fruit and trussed. Deglazed the pan (after throwing away the veges) with the soaking Armangac + 1/4 cup more, then prepared the gravy as described -- with chicken stock, vermouth, and mustard buerre manier. Spectacular and simple to prepare for company!

A solid recipe, and a real crowd-pleaser. Note, however, that glass pans work poorly on the stovetop. My dinner guests were somewhat startled when the pan I was cooking the sauce in exploded, shooting slivers of glass across the kitchen.

Excellent. Since my butcher does all the real work, this is great for company. You can use any dried fruit. Cherries work well. Ask your butcher to bore the hole and to give you the meat.

To the previous cook: my impression (supported by the photo) is that you remove the veggies with the roast, and just use the rest of the stuff in the pan to make the sauce/gravy. This is how I typically do a roast with veggies. Then you can serve them with the meat. Click on the camera icon next to the recipe name to view the photo. Happy cooking.

Do you serve the pan roasted vegetables or are they "spent" after roasting for so long and then simmered for the sauce? ...I'm a little perplexed since the recipe does not say to discard or to serve.

I used a boneless pork tenderloin and added other dried fruit like cherries and figs. I also added other vegetables to the pan like butternet squash, potatoes, turnips, etc. I made this for a dinner party of 20 people, and they raved about it! Even the children liked it, which was great because I didn't want to make two separate dishes. I will definitely keep this one in the file!

Since I bought my roast at the last minute I could only find a de-boned roast, actually it was 2 de-boned roasts tied together, about 4 lbs. Everybody liked it and it was moist and delicious. I will try it again with the bones on and with the herbes de Provence. Teh sauce was excellent.

This was a great dish. I did make some variations, using dried cranberries instead of prunes, and coating the pork with Herbes de Provence rather than marjoram alone. My dinner guests raved about how tender the meat was and the mustard sauce was a hit.

I had the original version from Gourmet years ago and could not find it again. Thanks love it.

I and my guests really loved this. I used tenderloin b/c of availability rather than rack, but results were beautiful and delicious. The mustard sauce was what really made the flavor special. I also thought it was really easy. I pulled this together for a dinner party for 8 plus sides, etc. in 3 hours.

This was a great dish!! I made it for company and everyone loved it. I added Herbes de Provence as well as marjoram which really added to the flavor. I too added the herbes to the inside of the pork. I used a boneless loin and split it down the middle, added more fruit and all the herbes and then tied the roast together. Also added a small amount of white wine during the cooking. The sauce is fantastic and should not be omitted. Enjoy.

This was delicious with a lovely presentation. I cooked 4 8-rib racks in one big roaster and it worked great. Mine were still connected at the backbone, so cutting to serve was rather difficult. The cooking time was just right, but check your meat thermometer to be sure.

This was a good entree for our supper club. All recipes came from the 10/02 Bon Appetit. The other reviewers were right--just get a hole through the roast and work it with your fingers and a wooden spoon handle until the fruit goes in. The sauce is very good with pork and is one I'll use with pork again.

I have been making this roast for years. I usually rub the outside with rosemary and black pepper. I never made a mustard sauce but will try it next time. It makes a pretty presentation and good left overs.

I took the advice of the previous reviewer and didn't cut a tunnel, but just a large slice and that worked perfectly. We enjoyed this dish very much as it was different and a tasty fall meal. It wasn't a "knock your socks off" dinner, but it was worthy of another try and I certainly would serve it to guests, the presentation is quite impressive. A lot of time is involved, so I wouldn't recommend it as a quick meal.

This was a beautiful fall roast with all of the colors. It was good but not delicious. I agree with not cutting out the center of the roast-chopping up the pork for the gravy was a pain and did not add much to the flavor or texture of the sauce.

Rating: 3
The presentation is what got me. The dish was pretty good, very simple sauce and I have always liked the fruit combination with pork. Don't get worried about cutting the tunnel in the pork, I made a large single cut through the roast and was able to squeeze all of the fruit in without much effort.This was good, but I have not added it to my recipe box.
