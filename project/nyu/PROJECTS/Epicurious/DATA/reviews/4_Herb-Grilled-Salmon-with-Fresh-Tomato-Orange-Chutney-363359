We loved this--so fresh-tasting in the middle of winter, and quick to prepare. The tomatoes really reduce down, so I would recommend using more in the chutney. And next time I'll up the jalapeno as well.

This is outstanding with or without the chutney. Use wild salmon (I used Copper River salmon) for best results. The only difference is I grilled it skin side DOWN initially.

I made the chutney and baked the salmon due to a rainy evening. I was serving 10 people and received rave reviews... some even said restaurant worthy! Also, two people who said they don't normally like salmon loved the dish. I'm making this again for the holiday weekend. Enjoy!

Amazing salmon and the chutney was FABULOUS. I am actually doing this a second time which says a lot as I never do things twice, I love trying new recipes too much.
