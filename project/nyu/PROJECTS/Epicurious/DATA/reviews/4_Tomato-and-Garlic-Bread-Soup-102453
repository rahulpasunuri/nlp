Making this for the second time, it is unbelievably easy. Totally delicious.

One of the best recipes in terms of taste/time ratio! I made only the soup, no croutons, using Muir Glen roasted tomatoes and pretty much followed the recipe. My additions: whipping cream at the end, & a piece of Parmesan rind. Amazingly delicious!

I was hosting a meeting at my home and served this soup. It was quite a hit and I almost ran out of it! The croutons are crucial and we each put them in the bottom of our bowls before adding the soup so it didn't get overly soggy. It was perfect. Frankly, without the homemade croutons it would have been just okay.

yum! I love this recipe especially since it makes so much it is good for cold nights with friends. I like to add white wine (half a cup) and since my friends are vegitarians I use veggie bullion cubes and add water.

The croutons are great and tasty; we put them in each bowl right before serving. The soup itself is ok, not great. I did follow other suggestions and pureed the soup with the stick blender, but the soup tasted a bit like a jar of pasta sauce. I might make this again, but would probably add a little milk or cream to soften it a bit.

Nice soup. Love the croutons, though I just sprinkled them on top of each bowl of soup instead of adding it to the whole pot. Garnish was beautful with the basil shavings & parmesan cheese. I served with a little caesar salad on the side.

This soup was quite delicious and satisfying. I did choose to puree the soup and I added some bacon pieces to the soup as well - delicious! Next time I would double the amount of bread croutons.

I have never been a huge fan of Tomato soup but this recipe is fantastic. My husband feels the same way. I have made this soup many times and have always gotten rave reviews. I do add a little more garlic and I puree the soup at the end. Very simple and a great winter meal.

I used Muir Glen crushed tomatoes with basil - what a good choice! It was foolproof. I boiled the soup for 20 minutes to thicken, the cooled for 15, and stirred in 1/4 c. of light cream to soften the soup. The croutons were a big hit. Go easy on the parmesan sprinkled on top - it just cakes to your spoon!

This dish was quick and mess free - perfect for a winter Sunday dinner after being away for the weekend.The first time I made it exactly as the recipe and it was delicious. Last night I added red lentils to thicken it up, and it was great. With the amount this makes though,we will be eating this soup for days.

Interesting take on Italian tomato bread soup, but the best I have ever had is from a recipe from the book, The Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews by Edda Servi Machlin. The book is out of print and hard to find but if you see a copy grab it. Her peasant soup recipe and others are excellent.

Wonderful! This recipe has just enough prep work to be satisfyingly homemade... plus great potential for creative add-ins. For two or three people, I'd suggest making a half recipe of soup and full recipe of croutons.

Was the perfect soup for a blustery winter day! Cut the recipe in half and served four with lots of leftovers. I added lots of fresh basil and used vegetable stock instead of chicken. The garlic croutons were what really made this soup so outstanding and it was enjoyed by all!

This soup is great, and even better after a couple days. I used a bit too much garlic, and to mellow the bite I added a small swirl of cream to the top of each bowl--looked pretty and tasted wonderful. I totally agree about cutting the oil on the croutons and serving them on the side.

Try this recipe, it was so good. Even the people who thought they didn't like tomato soup liked it! And the best part was that it was so easy. The only thing I changed was that I only used two onions instead or three.

This is a winner. The second time I cooked this soup I made the croutons with less oil (reduced by 75%), and the result was even better.

This was fabulous!!! I just loved it as did my husband and guests. My girlfriend's 1 year old liked it too. This tastes a lot like soup I had in Florence, Italy on my honeymoon!!!

This is a great basic soup that almost everyone will like. I like to puree the finished soup in the blender to give it a smooth texture. I would also reccomend adding extra herbs and putting the croutons in individual bowls at the very last minute.

This soup is fabulous -- like French Onion, only with tomatoes! Loved it and have made it several times.

A very tasty & easy to prepare soup. I used batard bread for my croutons with great results.

Fabulous soup. Have prepared several times. I like to add good parm reggiano rind to the simmering process (along with the 1/2 cup of grated.) Enjoy!

This is easy to make and saves well. Try a mixture of tomatoes for a nice texture - I used one can of crushed and one can of diced instead of both cans crushed so it'd be a bit heartier. I also threw in two diced fresh tomatoes at the end to give it a tarter taste.

My entire family found the soup delightful. By the way, the recipie says the dish serves 6, but as a started it could easily feed many more people. Also, a friend gave me a great tip: If you plan on serving the leftovers the next day, don't put in all the crutons on day one---put them in individual bowls as you serve the soup.

This is a delicious soup. I made it for a Christmas party, and it was a big hit. Strangely like a French Onion soup.

I was lazy in crushing the tomatoes the first time, so the result was a very watery and chunky soup. For my next attempt, when the soup was simmering, I used one of those hand-held blenders that you make drinks with, which "blended" all of the ingredients very well. Also, a spoonful of store-bought sun-dried tomato spread added a little kick!

Everyone who tried this recipe loved it. No doubt, I will be making this again!!!!!

This soup is delicious! I am e-mailing the recipe to my friends as soon as I'm done typing this review. Simple, healthy and tasty. One for the recipe collection!

this is so easy and so good. I just used a can of crushed tomatoes and, of course, extra garlic. make extra croutons because you will end up munching on them!

A wonderful recipe!!! I would recommend this to anyone! Its a perfect lunch or as a starter! Definitely put the croutons in as you serve the soup-not before!

If Meg Ryan was eating this in the restaurant scene of "When Harry Met Sally", then I understand her reaction. : ) We thought it was outstanding. It's a keeper!

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of tomato soup, but this was tasty. I used tomato stock as my base rather than the canned chicken broth and I think that gave it some extra flavor.

Wow, this was a great one. I'll definitely be making it again! When the recipie says "Serves 6" however, they're not joking. I now have a very full freezer, but am looking forward to defrosting this soup and having it again, and again! I followed the advice of one other reviewer and put the croutons in later. Actually, I put them in a bowl on the table which was fun to be able to eat our way through the bowl one crouton at a time. Delish!

Excellent, especially considering how easy it was. I added a lot of fresh herbs (thyme, chives, oregano) just cause I had them. Sadly, I didn't have any onions - can't wait to try it again with them. I think I wouldn't add the croutons while cooking next time - I might sprinkle them on each individual bowl. They seem to get soggy awfully fast.

I was looking for a light meal after a filling Sunday brunch and this soup was perfect. My husband and I were very pleased with how tasty the soup was. It's a keeper!

Made this with last year's garden tomatoes, which we'd frozen. It was great! Didn't use the basil, just cuz I didn't have any. My husband, who usually only cares for very meaty and thick soups/stews, had two bowls. With the croutons and cheese, it reminded me of french onion soup, but with a delicious tomato base instead. I loved it!

Superb! Wouldn't change one thing!
