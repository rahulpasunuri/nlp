Awesome. Making pasta is so easy. You can also use peas vs. asparagus or even sauteed spinach or kale, added at the end. Yummy! Definitely on the "list"!

This is definitely not a quick pasta dish, but one worth the time when you do have the time. I also used wonton wrappers and thought they worked just fine. Will make again!

I really enjoyed this dish. I was tempted to skip the parmesan broth and use an infused basil oil but I'm really glad I followed the recipe exactly. Sure it's a bit more complicated than a regular pasta dish but I found the whole thing flowed rather well. Most of the work can be done while during the time it takes to for the fresh pasta dough to refrigerate. I would certainly make this again and would use the parmesan broth in other recipes. Finally a good use for cheese rind!

The final product was very delicious! I used wonton wrappers instead of making pasta squares, but it was still very time-consuming. I also substituted bacon for the pancetta, which was fine. The parmesan broth was very tasty and flavorful! Good, but definitely not a quick pasta dish.

Very flavorful, but would not make again. I'm not afraid to tackle any recipe, but this was too time consuming and not worth the overall effort.

it was wonderful. The sauce was awesome as well. I had no problems with it at all
