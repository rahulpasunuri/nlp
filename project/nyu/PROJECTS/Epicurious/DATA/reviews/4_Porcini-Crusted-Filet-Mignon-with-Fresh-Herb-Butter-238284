Superb! This is by far the best steak I've ever cooked at home. And best of all - super easy. Came out deliciously flavored and perfectly cooked. Will definitely do this again for special occasions.

I have made this twice now. I serve it on top of a potato / celery root purée along with some candied carrots. Outstanding! Wouldn't change a thing!

This is by far the best steak recipe I've come across. It cooks perfectly every time. The dried porcini mushrooms make it smell so earthy. Perfect dish for a date night at home with baked potatoes, grilled asparagus, and a great bottle of wine. I've made this more than a dozen times. If I don't have all the ingredients for the butter, I simply use a garlic butter and it's just as great. Sometimes I get nice filets for my husband and me and buy cheaper cuts of steak for the kids (they love this too).

Delicious... Had long debated on making it, it just looked to simple to be that good.. It came out perfectly, porcini crust was yum. The only thing I would do next time is saute shallots & more garlic for the butter sauce.

I make this exactly as the recipe called and it was fantastic. I would definately make again.

Absolutely delicious! We have made this several times and it's the best way to make filet if you can't cook it on the grill. The porcini crust and the herb butter are an amazing compliment to each other. Love it!

Definitely the best way to cook filets if you can't cook them on the grill. Flavorful and delicious! We have made them numerous times and we have never been disappointed.

This was good but not great for us. Unfortunately I think it might be because we used Rib eye and not Filet as the butcher was out of Filet. The juices from the Rib-eye seemed to take over the other flavors. If I make it again I will defitely use Filet next time.

This is really good and very easy! Followed the recipe exactly and meat turned out perfectly medium-rare.

My husband and I are big filet fans and cook it every weekend. We always look for different recipes for variety, and this was top notch. The meat came out very tender and the flavor was wonderful. We like our steaks cooked rare-medium rare, so I cut the time down to 2 1/2 minutes per side (the recommended 6 minutes per side for Medium rare is bang on). Perfect! Served this with simple baked potatoes and it still seemed gourmet b/c we used the leftover butter in the potatoes. My parents were over and loved it and had me forward the recipe. Definitely a winner and you won't be disappointed.

This was phenomenal. The dried mushrooms lend just the right depth of flavor to the beef, without masking the beef's own flavor. Yum! My husband was skeptical but after trying it he says we'll never pan-cook steaks again any other way.

Without a doubt the BEST filet I have EVER made and eaten. Super easy. If serving with bread, sprinkle dried tarragon on the butter dish to add color.

This is the best filet mignon I have ever had, let alone made! The porcinis and tarragon complement one another - I wouldn't substitute other herbs or mushrooms for either. Cook to 130 degrees for a perfect med-rare.

If your not health conscious this is absolutely delicious. I served it with sweet potato french fries and tri colore salad with balsamic vinegrette. I also spread the herbed butter on french bagettes and toasted it. To die for!!! Because it is such a high fat meal I would really serve it as a treat once a year.

This was so easy and incredibly fantastic.

The best steaks I've ever prepared, and better than many that I've had at higher end restaurants and steakhouses. So simple, too! You can grind the porcinis (yes, coffee grinder) and make the herb butter in the morning and be done with it. When it's time to make dinner, the steaks take literally 2 minutes active time and then 12-15 minutes on the stove. Like most meats, I take them out of the fridge and salt and pepper them about a half hour before I'm ready to cook them, so they have a chance to get close to room temperature.

Hard to believe such a simple ingredient can make such a differance. It will be difficult to ever prepare a steak again wihtout the Porchinis. And yes, the coffee grinder works perfectly for preparing the mushrooms.The herb butter was good but this preperation is really all about the mushrooms. Fatastic!

Rating: 4
AMAZING! And so easy. I made a couple substitutions - firstly, I didn't have time to buy fresh herbs, so made the butter with McCormick's Italian Seasoning and minced garlic instead - still phenomenal. Secondly, I don't have an electric spice grinder. I tried using my manual one, but that was taking FOREVER. Ended up throwing the dried porcini mushrooms in the food processor. They came out slightly chunkier, but worked nevertheless. Also, my grocer only sold thicker cuts of filet mignon, so I had to cook it longer, but it still came out fantastic! Made some extra herb butter and slathered it on slightly fork-mashed potatoes as a side, which complemented it quite well. All in all, great recipe.

Rating: 4
By far one of the best dishes I've ever had! Never would I previously cook filets without grilling them. Every time I make this, EVERYone is impressed. The mushrooms add the most delicious flavor to the meat. I usually make mashed potatoes as a side dish and throw in the leftover chives.

Rating: 4
This recipe is simply divine. Filet mignon simply can't be improved on - such a fabulous earthy aroma. Made the most wonderful, romantic dinner and truly impressed. This is my new favorite for entertaining special guests. Also turned out great on less expensive cuts of meats for more everyday meals.

I didn't have filet so I used Ribeye instead. I thought the flavors were great, but a little rich because of the ribeye. I'm planning to do this again with filet next time.

Used ground dried shiitake mushrooms because it was on hand. Thought this was just ok. So disappointed too because it is easy to prepare. Just needed more flavor, believe it or not!

This is my favorite 'find' from Epi. It elevates a steak from good to fantastic. I love a recipe that is easy as well as fantastic. This is the only way I do filet now.

I can't disagree with any of the previous reviews. This has every element of a great dish-- simple, rich, and great combo of flavors that combine in an unexpected way. Made it once with porcini and once with dried chantarelles, and they both were outstanding. Try this dish!

I normally never review recipes but this one floored me. With respect to steak, I usually don't eat filet and tend to eat strip or rib-eye, but the porcini crust and richness of the butter make this dish sing. I never imagined I could make such a delicious steak on a pan. Do not hesitate to make this.

ok so can i just say WOW i rarely review but this was a winner. prob. the best filet i have ever had. I cook a lot and this was one of the best things i have ever made. my friend who is also a cook called it outstanding. and it is! i ground porcini in coffee grinder.

Perfect! A friend and I cooked this for a New Year's eve dinner... fabulous! One trick, we used a coffee grinder to grind the mushrooms to a powder& it worked perfectly!

Made this for Christmas Eve, along with wild mushroom bread puddings and pancetta-sage green beans. Phenomenal centerpiece for the meal. The herb butter really made the meal. I don't like chives, so just made it with the tarragon and garlic. Also used the food processor and strained the porcini powder, per the other reviewer's tip.

Extraordinary. The mushrooms compliment and deepen the beef flavor. Absolutely amazing dish. I used a food processor instead of a spice grinder and it worked fine. Strained out the pieces that didn't turn into powder.

WOW!! this recipe is a definite keeper. Made this last night and aroma hung in the air until the next day. The mushroom was a perfect match with the flavored butter. This is a crowd pleaser and great for a romantic dinner (even if you're married) just kidding. This recipe is beyond 4 forks. I even ate the leftover for breakfast. I wonder if you can make this on the grill.

This recipe is FABULOUS! My boyfriend and I love grilling steak and this recipe is by far the best steak either of us have ever eaten! We use a cast iron skillet on the gas grill to give the steaks the perfect crust. This recipe is a must for anyone who likes red meat! You won't be disappointed!

This was sooo delicious. My boyfriend claimed it was one of the best steaks he's ever had. I cut the cooking time to about 4 mins per side and had a beautiful med-rare. I also made an extra one for next-day sandwiches... WOW. A little old cheddar and mustard and I was the envy of the office.

Great recipe. One of the best steaks I've ever made. Better than a steakhouse! The porcini give the steak great depth of flavor(almost truffle-like). The butter melts over the steak and pools on the plate to make a delicious sauce. This is a keeper.

Very nice. The porcini makes a nice crust on the steaks (and what a handy way to use up all that porcini dust that accumultes in the bottom of jars and packages!) Herb butter on any steak is delicious.
