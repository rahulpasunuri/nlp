I love squid in all forms, but the technique is a bad call. I admittedly made the mistake of using a Holland Grill (slow and low heat), not sure what I was thinking - tough and terrible. However, you really need an open-flame grill, we use charcoal, and the odds of the squid successfully staying on a standard grill are slim. Plus you lose the yummy juices.

Tried this with baby octopus and liked the overall flavour. Leftovers are not a good idea though, as the texture became rather slimy and rubbery.

i loved this recipe. At first i found them a little spicy and thought i could reduce the red pepper flakes but i think it wouldn't have the same kick without the spice. I also grilled the tentacles until they were nice and crispy and they were amazing. Also i suggest cutting rings into the calamari in order for it to cook evenly on the grill.
