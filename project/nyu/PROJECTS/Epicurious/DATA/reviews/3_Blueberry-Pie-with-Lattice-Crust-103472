This is a tremendous pie! The first of many blueberry I have baked that did not suffer from being overly soupy. I added 2T of cornstarch as recommended to ensure it set properly and omitted the vanilla, preferring the lemon flavor. Blueberry pies are highly dependent on the blueberry used. The juicier the berry, the more thickener required. Taste them for sweetness as well; at times more sugar is required. The optimal berry for blueberry pies is a wild Maine blueberry, but at $9 a pint, it makes for an expensive pie. This will be my defacto blueberry pie from here on out. FYI - I used the "Best Ever Pie Crust" from 2007.

This pie was amazing. The lemon flavor was pronounced, but a wonderful balance for the sweetness of the fresh Michigan blueberries I used. (I did add about a tablespoon of cornstarch, which worked beautifully) I used my standby crust recipe, so I can't comment on the one here, but I will definitely make this again, hopefully once more before blueberries vanish!

I made this because my son wanted to try making a lattice pie. Picked the blueberries from the neighbor's bushes. I think they were a little tart. So I omitted the lemon juice and of course the peel (that's way too dominating). I didn't have quite enough (barely 4 cups) so I cut the amount of flour and sugar by 1/3 to 1/4. The filling was enough for a standard 9 inch pie, it was still tart (should have added more sugar) but not runny at all. The crust was nice in consistency. I admit I didn't have vegetable shortening and the amount of fat seemed large so I used (gasp) 1/2 cup lard and a little less butter. Dough was actually very easy to work with! Cut the cooking time, to 30 min uncovered, 30 min very loosely covered. Family liked it. I need to make some ice cream to go with it, that would counterbalance the tartness well. Don't quite understand the initial bad reviews...

A delicious pie! I make it to the recipe specifications and it is always delicious. I would definitely make the pie crust...it is fairly easy to make and adds so much to the pie. I recommend making extra dough...1 1/2 to 2 times the recipe is perfect. If you don't want to make the lattice you can make a solid topping and cut an x in the top to vent. Delicious!! You can also make the recipe as cobbler. Roll 1/2 the dough out and put in the bottom of a 9X13 pan, pour the blueberry mix on top and then roll out the top layer of dough to place on top. You don't have to cover it completely, just place it around the top. As a cobbler you don't have to worry about the pie setting up perfectly.

Delicious! Have made this twice -- the second time making two for a big dinner. This is not your typical cloyingly sweet blueberry pie; the lemon juice and zest cut back on the sweetness so that it is just perfection in each bite. And the lattice top is so pretty. Really great crust recipe too -- is now my go-to for pie crusts.

This was an almost excellent recipe. Next time I will use 1 TB lemon juice and add cornstarch/more flour to adjust moisture. The cooking time was perfect with a very hot oven & convection. I'd make this again in a moment - with those changes.

This turned out beautifully! I didn't find the lemon to be too overpowering. In fact, I found the vanilla to be what I tasted more than lemon. I used frozen blueberries (filling was perfect- not runny) and I used my own crust recipe. Will make again for sure!

I read the reviews and tried adding cornstarch 2T as suggested. That didn't work for me. It was too thick. Maybe would work if you used frozen berries, but not fresh.

I have never baked a pie before so this was quite nerve racking. I listened to everyones suggestions and added cinnamon, corn syrup, left out the lemon zest and closely monitored the baking time (about 55 minutes). I am pleased to say my pies came out PERFECT and delicious! I did cheat and use frozen blueberries and frozen pie crusts!!

I read every review before making this pie and I got great results--the best blueberry pie I've had. Here's what I did: I used my own recipe for crust (2 1/4 c flour, 1/2 t salt, 1/4 c butter, 1/2 c shortening, 6-7 T cold water, chill for half an hour.) For the filling I used double the amount of vanilla and 1/2 t cinnamon, the juice and zest of one SMALL lemon (about 1/2 t), a big pinch of SALT and 2 T cornstarch (crucial to the setting of the filling). Because of the other reviews, I watched the baking time carefully. After half an hour I covered the edge of the crust with foil and decreased the oven temp to 375. The timing of the recipe was accurate--90 mintues in all. My filling was set, my crust was flakey and golden brown. Rave reviews all around. If you make this pie, be sure your oven rack is adjusted to the bottom quarter to third and the temperature is accurate. Good Luck!

Good filling but I would cut way back on lemon juice and zest used. Following the recipe allmost totally washed out the taste of the bluberries. Also, only used three Tblspoons iced water and pie crust was very sticky. Refrigderated pie crust for thirty minutes and that helped. Will make this again but will add cinammon and way less lemon.

Rating: 3
I'm making this for the second time. I think it's a great pie. I don't think the lemon flavoring is too powerful. The filling was a good consistency and is even better after refrigeration the next day. The only change I made was bake it uncovered for the first half hour or so and THEN cover it, after it has reached a nice color.

I made this for a Labor Day picnic and it was a definite hit. Used store-bought pie crust, but tasted excellent. Would definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
I thought this pie was delicious! The only problem was that the filling was a bit runny. I made the crust and filling exactly as stated except I used lime rind instead of lemon rind. I think this is one of the best pastry crust recipes - I have used it many times, including for the vanilla peach pie which was also featured in the article. Regarding the cooking time, my feeling is that you just need to watch it. For me, it turned out the pie needed the full 90 minutes, but I did cover the top early.

Excellent. I will definitely make this again. As suggested, I added a little cinnamon (1/2 teaspoon) and cut the baking time to 55 min. I used my own pie crust recipe. The next time, I'll probably skip the lemon peel, too.

VERRRRRRY good, but I agree to cut down the baking time. First time I made this, I baked it for the suggested 90 minutes, the second time I baked it for 1 hour, it was fine. The crust was THE BEST crust I've ever made!! Took me back to the blueberry pies my mom made when I was a child that I loved. It's a recipe seemingly similar from somebody's grandma's recipe collection. Very good! Big hit with all who tasted it!! Was gone in one day!! I also covered the edges of the crust for the last 30 minutes of bake time. Soon as I made this the first time, I immediately copied it for safe keeping. I've made this 3 times now, will make many more times, as my family really enjoyed it and even asks me when I'm going to make it again! Definitely a keeper.

I made this pie last night from the magazine, and only today thought to check the website for comments. While my husband and I both thought the final product was delicious (the only change I made was to cover the edge after 15 minutes, and take the pie out 20 minutes early), the crust was too wet to work without wax paper and a lot of extra flour. Next time I'll use my regular pie crust recipe or reduce the liquid.

Wish me luck: I am about to make this pie for the third time. The first time, I misread the amount of lemon zest and used 2 tablespoons(!). Having baked many pies, I thought the cooking time was much too long and the crust looked done after about 55 minutes, so I took it out. We liked the strong lemon flavor altough it did overpower the berries. I did not like the soupiness of the filling. I wondered if the extra zest had somehow contributed to the filling's failure to gel, so the second time I measured very carefully, but still cooked it only 55 minutes or so. It did not gel, and we missed the lemony tang. I have only now read all the reviews...wow...all over the place. For my third attempt I will add some extra zest and some cornstarch and see what I get. Blueberries are almost gone, so this probably the last one for the season.

I made this pie and it was easy and delicious. However, there was no way I was going to cook it for 90 minutes. 55 minutes did the trick perfectly. (30 covered, 25 uncovered.)

I was worried about this recipie, since there were so many negative comments. However, it came out wonderfully. I didn't use much lemon, and I used more flour to coat the berries. Also, I often do not go by time alone when I bake. I watch over whatever is baking and think about taking it out when its aroma seems right. Not scientific, but you can't always follow the time and temperature recommendations literally.

This delicious, old-fashioned pie was simple to make with ingredients "on hand". It received RAVE reviews from my dinner guests. I omitted the lemon peel, because I didn't have any. I added 2 TBS. of corn starch, to insure that it "gelled" in time for dessert. It held together perfectly, and tasted like a traditional, "grandma's" blueberry pie!

I would not recommend using this recipe. If you use it, be sure to reduce the cooking time. I followed the recipe and cooked the pies at 400 for the amount of time suggested and they liquified and were barely edible. Bon Appetite should make sure they are testing every recipe before publishing because the cooking time suggested was way too long.

This pie was fantastic! I found the crust easy to make and the filling was just the right consistency. I would cover the crust after 30 minutes, not 40, as my crust browned just a bit more thatn I would have liked. I'll know better next time. There will definitely be a next time.

Rating: 2
This pie sounded great, and I had a bunch of leftover frozen blueberries from picking earlier in the season so I thought this would be the perfect use. I just tasted it, and I can't say I'm wowed. The filling came out a little runny, and it seemed like I baked and baked and baked forever. While the crust came out looking fine, it didn't do a good job of keeping in the filling, and it left the pie in an unpresentable condition in its plate. I'm supposed to bring this to a party this evening, but I think I'll pass.

The baking time is much too long! We've been making a lot of pies with the wonderful summer berries, and I should have followed the Joy of Cooking baking instructions: 10 minutes at 450 degrees, then 30 minutes (more or less) at 350. With only 10 minutes after the original 40, the crust was all dried out and the berries completely lost their shape. The flavor is delicious, but the texture needs work. Fortunately, blueberries are just coming into season in Massachusetts, so we'll make another in a week or two!

I found this pie to be too sweet and would reduce the amount of sugar so the natural flavor of the berries can come through. The lattice crust was beautiful, flaky, and fun to make.

I've made this pie at least a dozen times since last June's issue came out and I'm making it again for a Memorial Day bbq this weekend. I use small and large star-shaped cookie cutters to make about 2 dozen stars out of the top crust and just scatter them over the berries, brush with egg and bake. Looks and tastes great.

We loved this pie. I have made it several times and its a winner every time. I have used (fresh)frozen berries too. Add a little flour to coat them before putting them in the crust. I've never used the rind either!

I have made this pie twice now. And it's great. However, I'm not a fan of lemon rind, so I didn't put it in. Also,I used an oil pastry crust recipe from the Better Homes and Gardens cook book instead. This has been a "no-fail" flakey crust for me, and probably a little more healthy (using canola oil instead of butter or lard). The original baking time was too much so I just kept an eye on it until it looked done--I think it was about 20-25 minutes after the first 40.

I thought this was one of the better blueberry pie recipes. I agree with most of the reviews however, NO LEMON PEEL...and the tip about the waxed paper and freezing the rolled out crust made it an easy clean-up too!

Rating: 3
After cooling this pie for 2 hours, I didn't like it much. The crust seemed salty and the filling was runny ang too acidic. However, when we ate the rest of the pie the nextg morning it was great. Somehow the longer cooling time allowed the flavors to mellow out and come together, if that makes sence. A couple notes about the crust: I roll it out between two pieces of wax paper and then put it in the freezer for 10 minutes. This makes it much easier to work with and also less messy. I made a doule crust pie this time but I imagine this would work with lattice also. Also, my pie was done at least 10 minutes before I thought it would be so deffinately keep the long cooking time in mind.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use only scant tablespoons of lemon juice, no rind, and a generous amount of vanilla. The final blend was perfect, not cloying, not tart. My husband loved it. (Also, I used my own pastry recipe.) As a side note; in my haste I only baked the pie for 40 minutes. An hour after it had cooled, I reread the recipe and realized there was 50 minutes to go. I just popped it back in the oven, turned it on again, and it turned out perfectly... no harm done!

Well - just to confuse people reading the reviews I made this pie and we thought it was great! I would make it again.

I would make this again only with serious modifications. The lemon taste in the berry filling was unpleasantly strong, and I think it competed with the bluberries. I'd omit half the rind and juice, at least. Also, I'd definitely use another crust recipe. I haven't found one better than the one on the back of the Crisco tub. So really, I'd change a lot about the pie. Basically, I suppose I'd just make up a new recipe!

Lots of trouble with this recipe. The filling was vile, and the crust impossible. No matter how much water I added, the crust refused to come together. I know some had success with this dish, but given the percentage who would not make this again, I'd say if you want a reliable, good pie, make another recipe.

I was served this pie by a friend a month ago and thought it delicious enough to bake on my own. I did so this weekend and it came out perfectly! I didn't bother with the crust (Pillsbury refrigerated crust worked fine) and the filling was delicious. I recommend adding a little more sugar than the recipe calls for and brushing the crusts with egg whites -- it was delicious!

I had never made a blueberry pie before, and was very pleased with the results I got from this recipe. The crust was a little difficult to work with, but once baked I thought it was by far the best I've ever tasted, and worth the effort. The filling was great too, but I will add a little more flour next time to combat runniness, and I did ease up on the lemon and will again. I wonder if those who had crust burning difficulty didn't place the pie in the bottom third of overn as directed. I did and cooked it exactly as long and as hot as indicated with great results.

I made this pie and the crust came out fine. I covered it according to the recipe's instructions and it came out great, really nice and flaky, I had almost no trouble rolling out the dough either. I kept the pie in the bottom rack of my oven. My filling did not come out thick and it was kind of runny, I'm not sure if maybe I should have baked it longer. Everyone loved it and I served it with vanilla Haagen Daz. Very good, but I would have preferred a more solid filling.

This is really bad. I'd skip this one. Crust was BURNED to a crisp, and the dough was too hard to work with. Too bad I didn't experiment with this recipe before serving it to company. I ended up serving it anyway, and not one person could manage more than a few bites. Yuck!

Horrible! I make pies all the time, but this has got to take the cake for worst ever! Dough was ridiculous, and tough to work with. I couldn't manage to roll it out, so I had to press it into the pie plate. That makes for some nice tender crust, huh??!! I didn't think it was possible to mess up pie FILLING, but this recipe manages it. The lemon overpowered the blueberries and imparted an unpleasant zing to the filling. The baking time and temperature are all totally and completely off. I wish I'd read some of these comments before attempting this pie. It would have saved me a disasterous afternoon. What a waste of time and 12 dollars worth of ingredients.

This is a wonderful pie! It was a big hit in my family. I'll definitely be making it again soon. I liked the texture of the crust and the filling was wonderful -- not at all runny. I followed the recipe exactly, and it worked fine. The only difference is that I made it over 2 days, completing only the crust on the first day. I placed the bottom ctust in the pie pan and refrigeratied it overnight. It was still cool when I put the pie in the oven. I don't know if this made any difference as to success.

There is no way that the cover recipe was baked at that high a temperature for that long a time. I even covered my pie with foil for half the time, but the top didn't look golden brown like the photo-- it was positively bured black in some spots. The filling tasted good, but I wasn't partial to the burned crust. The dough was ridiculous to work with. I had to finally roll it up and press it into the pie plate. Now, I'm not exactly an expert chef, but I know how to make pastry dough. It seems to me that most of the people who gave this recipe a high rating did not use this particular crust recipe. That might be key -- as it is written, this is a big disappointment-- I have made much better pies.

Baked blueberry pie isn't one of my favorites - I prefer a glazed blueberry pie. But - this was very good. Didn't use your crust recipe - use an old family recipe for all of my pies. For those of you that had your crust burn, I've had that happen all too many times. Invest in a few pie shields - they are great - no more burnt crust!

Okay, so I'm a traditionalist: I always make pies with Julia Child's sweet short paste (for the crust.) That said, the filling was *great*. Not too much lemon, not too sweet--just right. I loved the glaze of whipping cream and suger; I'd never done that before and it looked (and tasted) great. I would use sugar sparingly and take seriously the instructions to cover the crust with foil. Mine bubbled over a little, but I kind of like that look. (Use tinfoil or a cookie sheet on the rack under your pie.) I will make it again--probably until people tell me to stop!

I would suggest to those whose crust burnt on top to try baking the pie on the lowest shelf in the oven. The pie may be too close to the top of the oven & therefore baking too fast.

I had trouble with the crust from this recipe. While baking, the edge, which I fluted decoratively, ended up drooping and then falling off onto the cookie sheet below! I don't know what went wrong. I've never had this happen before and I make pies all the time. If anyone has any input let me know. The blueberry filling was good, but, I think the lemon taste is too tart and competes with the berries. The lattice top did look beautiful when the pie was done. It ended up more browned than the cover photo, but, only slightly.
