Deeelicious! I agree, it was bland when I tasted it all mixed together, just a nice dill flavor (I did not skimp on the dill at all!). I added salt and white pepper to taste with the salad, not just the dressing. I had some crushed thyme on hand which gave it a nice secondary note to the dill. Served with a cocktail menu, and it provided a nice staple with all the other more exotic flavors. I would definitely make again for part of a full menu, or a light weeknight kind of meal.

One of my favorite recipes. Clean and simple, but so yummy!

This is bad. It's bland even with added feta cheese, and I think there's too much cucumber in this recipe because the texture of the dish was unpleasant. I think this may qualify as the worst recipe I have ever made off of Epicurious.

Love this salad. I'm not a huge Green Bean fan, so have substituted blanched asparagus and fresh avocado cubes. Great with orange sections too - the citrus helped punch it up.

I added feta like other reviewers suggested. The salad really needs it, pretty bland without. My rating would be 3 forks if they included feta in the recipe.

Not exciting. Just different.

The dill pesto is delicious, and worth trying again with other pasta salads, or maybe crackers and light cheese, but the salad as a whole is bland and lacking.

Love this salad. I have made it many times. Great summer dish that goes with almost any grilled meat, chicken or fish.

I had really high expectations on this one after reading the good reviews. Unfortunately though, I found it pretty bland and one-note after following the recipe exactly. The pesto, while tasting great on it's own, lost a lot of power once it was mixed in with everything else. I can't recommend this one and won't be making it again. If you want to give it a go though, I'd suggest adding some nuts and/or grated Parmesan on top.

I make this a lot - it's a great warm-weather dinner as a main course, or an excellent side dish when it's cooler out. If snap peas are in season they are a good substitute for the green beans and add a little delicate sweetness. It's a very flexible recipe; I've used white balsamic vinegar, white wine vinegar, sherry vinegar - it's all yummy. Super easy and I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like it.

Fantastic and easy recipe. Was thinking I might substitute snow peas for green beans next time, and possibly add avocado and feta cheese.

Simply wonderful!Followed others suggestions and increased lemon juice & added feta. Decreased orzo to 2/3 cup. Did not use cucumber as the fennel on hand was huge and did not want to waste it. Do not skimp on the fresh dill. Was equally as good the following day. Will make this repeatedly.

Really tasty! I increased the dill to 1 cup for the pesto and also put chopped on top just before serving. Needed salt, though, to really taste the flavors. Added pine nuts, which MADE THE SALAD, in my opinion. Next time I make this I'll blanch the green beans, they were a bit too cooked for me.

I made this receipe for a party for the first time and loved it. I'm already passing on the receipe. It was easy to put together. Great combination. Will make again.

This recipe was a nice way to use green beans in a different way, and I've been getting a lot of them from my CSA in recent weeks. It was a refreshing summer meal, but it didn't exactly blow me away. I used more dill and lemon than suggested. Next time I'll use more fennel too. It's a nice quick midweek meal, but I don't think I would make it for guests.

Tasty, but needed more dill. Also, the recipe says '6 servings' - maybe if this is the only thing you serve! As a side dish, I would halve the amount of pasta and it would still be plenty.

Wowza! Awesome! I'm a huge orzo salad nut - this one's been in my recipe file as one to try for some time. And it's fantastic! I would make extra pesto though - it needs it after standing longer than an hour. The pesto is divine. I plan on using it for other purposes - marinades, etc.

A light little breeze of a salad. The orzo with the dill is a delight. I added more lemon juice to the dressing, and oddly enough, more chopped dill (after blending). Despite the copious amount used in the dressing, it still did not seem as dilly as I was craving. I also added more fennel and cucumber as I had chopped too much. Lastly, I added some pine nuts toasted and tossed in garlic oil and some goat's milk feta. I think it would have been lonely without those as a main course salad, although perhaps OK as a super-light side. Now I have to go plant some more dill so that I can enjoy this again.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was delicious. Nice flavors, nice variety of texture, and a perfect light side dish.

Made this many times since the summer for many parties and everyone always ask for the recipe. I double the main ingridents and triple the dressing when I do it for parties. I like to add a bunch of asparagus slightly blanced, feta and pine nuts.

I have made this salad 4 times now and it is definitely a hit. I just made it tonight and had a guest ask for the recipe. I make it exactly as the recipe is shown but I do add cubed feta cheese, french feta if I can find it and I really like the flavor of this added ingredient. The feta does add a bit of a salty taste. It's such a versatile salad and can be made ahead.

A Cook from CA...I couldn't agree more! A Cook from Brooklyn made a totally different recipe. I made this recipe and found it delightful!

I omitted green beans and added cherry tomatoes and feta. Inside of making a pesto I whisked together the oil, vinegar, lemon juice and chopped dill for a dressing. Didn't have white balsamic so I used brown. Nice, quick easy summer pasta. If I made again would probably try a variation of ingredients.

I liked this a lot. I used fusilli and omitted the fennel. Just used regular balsamic and added some grated Parmiggiano. Definitely will make again.

This is a great side dish. The fennel is delicious and balances the dish well - don't skip over it. Everyone had seconds.

After reading the recipe and the reviews, it looks like people may be forgetting to season with salt and pepper. That note is in the preparation part not in the list of ingredients. This salad would be bland without salt for sure. I would add some finely grated asiago or romano cheese too. Great concept.

A great cool summer side! We really enjoyed this dish with lamb chops grilled with some extra pesto.

I started with this base but found it a bit too bland. I added 1 heaping tablespoon of Mayo and 1/2 cup Feta. The dill was much more awake after that. If figure friendly was what you were shooting for, I might have messed that up. I lived the cucumber idea. After a bit of doctoring, I give the new version 3 forks.

I didn't have enough fresh dill so suplemented with dry. Will definitely use fresh next time. Thought the dressing a little sharp at first, but I let it sit and it was fine. My beans were fine at 5 min, but did put them in cold water immediately and then drained and cut into smaller pieces. All in all a good summer salad. Served as a side with grilled tuna.

Made this recipe last night and found it tasteless. The dill pesto was a bit bitter so I added some sugar. That helped but not much. I finally added a cup of pecorino romano cheese which finally gave it some flavor. Would not make again.

A great summer recipe! I would agree with adding more lemon to the dressing and maybe use a little less orzo.

I just finished making this... it was super easy, I added garlic to the pesto and served it with grilled chicken! AWESOME!!!

I made this as written with the exception of the amount of dill (I used half the amount because I could not proper judge 2/3 cup of chopped dill). I thought the dressing was lacking in flavor and had to doctor the salad with more dressing: added more lemon, vinegar and finally dijon mustard. I used a meyer lemon. Maybe it wasn't strong enough? I usually make another orzo salad in epicurious which has feta cheese, olives and cherry tomatoes. I like that one much better. It has a bolder taste. I think I was drawn to this recipe by the picture and the thought of using fennel. I used persian cucumbers. It is nice and sweet.

This is a fresh tasting, delicious side dish to salmon and lamb. I did not have white balsamic so used white wine vinegar and it was fine. As with any pasta salad, I would not mix the dressing in until ready to serve.

I made this last week - excellent! The dressing was just right, and the fennel-dill combo really worked - and I don't particularly like fennel. Two words of caution - be sure to use the English cucumbers - mine were from the local grocer and were slightly bitter. Also, if you cook the green beans for five minutes, they will be a mushy mess - three minutes should do.
