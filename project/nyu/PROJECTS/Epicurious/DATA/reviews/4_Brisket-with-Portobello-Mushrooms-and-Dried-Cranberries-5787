Made this as my first-ever brisket recipe, and it turned out great. Plenty of sauce and really similar to a lovely pot roast, with a nice cranberry twist. Contrary to other reviews, I think I would actually add a bit more rosemary than called for, as I thought the taste was a bit lost and rosemary is fabulous with beef. Following other suggestions I cooked at 250 for 4 hours, then lest it rest for about 30 minutes, then bakes at 350 for 45 minutes with the mushrooms and cranberries after sliced. It was fall-apart good, not dry at all. Excellent for a dinner party as it just comes out of he oven sliced -- you've already done the work before guests arrive! Will make again.

This wasn't horrible but my brisket turned out dry. I would definitely turn the heat down and cook for longer. I think the cranberries in addition to the cranberry juice was just too much. As a result of this recipe I have discovered that I am not a big "fruit with meat" fan. If you are, you would probably enjoy this. I will stick to herbs, garlic, mushrooms etc rather than the fruit.

I now make this twice a year for family gatherings -- the family insists on it. It is rich and full of lively flavor. Great accompanied by rice with a side of root vegetable casserole in winter.

The key to this recipe is cooking the meat LONG and LOW...I usually do 3 hours at 300 degrees then another 2 hours at 250 degrees and a tight lid, either double foil wrapped or a tight lid. You will always get tender brisket whether it is grass fed or not. I make it every year for Christmas Eve and EVERY year I pull it out after 3 hours and it's always too tough. Making it a day in advance always enhances the flavor as well. ENJOY! its a family FAVORITE!!

My Mom has made this recipes since the 1950's and it has always been a big hit. Wonderful savory taste for all to enjoy! This was popular in Germany in the mid 1900 and still cannot be improved upon. EXCELLENT DISH!!

Amazingly good! I used a dutch oven with a foil layer between pot and lid and pushed the center down so the condensation dripped back in. Used 100% Cranberry juice (no sugar added) instead of concentrate. Did not chop the rosemary, just put a sprig on either side. Cooked until temp was 185 then rested IN the braising liquid (braising 101). Strained and degreased the sauce before returning to wiped out dutch oven. Removed the fat still remaining before slicing the brisket and putting back in the sauce. For final, I sliced and lightly caramelized a new onion, tossed the mushrooms in with that to slightly cook then added to the pot with the cranberries. Once warmed up I removed the sliced meat, thickened sauce with cornstarch and done deal. The cranberries really added something wonderful. Everyone loved it and couldn't stop making the Mmmm- mmm noises. Will definitely be making this again and again.

Rating: 2
This turned out tough for me as well. I'm sure it wasn't a bad cut of meat--my butcher is very reliable. Talked to him afterward and he recommended baking at 250 and scoring the fat. Will try that next time. The rest of the recipe is wonderful.

Substituted with cherries instead of cranberries. Everyone loved it! Great for leftovers the next day - I made sandwiches topped with horseradish. First time making a brisket and would definitely make again. No problems with drying out, I used a lidded baking pan, or you could use a dutch oven.

I made this for our recent Hanukkah dinner with great success! This, by far, makes the best fork tender brisket with "self" gravy. I've made several brisket recipes but this is the winner to date.

I made this in 1998, when this recipe was first published, and I remembered it all these years! I'm making it again this week. I'm so glad they put it on line as I can't seem to find my copy of that issue (just spent part of an evening looking for it!).

I was really looking forward to making and eating this based on the ingredients and the reviews but it didn't work for me. The sauce just didn't taste right- my wine was good. Perhaps it was the cranberry juice cocktail which made it a little too sweet, or maybe it's the fact that I'm not a big rosemary fan. I also used grass-fed brisket for the first time, and it came out very tough. I read afterward that grass-fed definitely needs to be seared before roasting. I don't blame the recipe for the toughness, but this was a disappointment.

Absolutely amazing flavor; just the kind of cooking I love...low and slow! Similar to a Junior League of Seattle Cookbook recipe but much easier. Rich and flavorful, definately a company quality recipe. My husband and I had enough for 3 meals and I still crave it. Will make it again and again.

I've been making this brisket for our family Passover for more than 10 years -it's simple and delicious. This year I had to make 3 to feed 25 people and still have enough for leftovers. I've used the concentrate and I've substituted with cran juice - both turn out great. Leave out the mushrooms since not everyone is a fine. This is a keeper.

I have always hated brisket, but needed to make one for a family party. This was exceptional. The flavors were wonderful together. The rosemary was not overpowering, and with the wine, cranberry concentrate, and beef broth, it was just perfect. After 3.5 hours, the meat was still a litle tough, but after 4 hours, it was as tender as can be and was falling apart. My son is the pickiest eater in creation, and he had 2 helpings. This is a keeper.

Don't understand the tough meat. Most brisket cooked as long as this recipe will be tender! Could be an oven problem or a lousy piece of brisket. I used to make a beef tenderloin at Christmas and my usual guests said that this was as good if not better. I have copies of this recipe in several places in the event that Epicurious ever deletes it from the site!!

Rating: 4
Like other reviewers, I have made this numerous times producing raves and recipe requests. Like with any meat recipe it is essential to start out with a quality cut of meat. I think it's possible that the "tough" problem others reported could be due to not having the best cut. Sometimes it's hard to tell by looking at it. I recommend trying it again with a really good piece of meat and see if that' the problem. It truly is a fantastic recipe!

This is an outstanding brisket recipe. I get rave reviews every time I serve it. How anyone could be left with a tough piece of meat is beyond me..there is enough acid with the cranberry juice concentrate and the wine to almost melt the meat if it is cooked too much longer! I've made this many, many times now and have never had it tough. The balance of ingredients is perfect for a rich, savory roast with deep brown sauce. I do add a butter and flour roux to it as a thickener; just enough to give it a velvety smooth texture.

I do NOT drink so I substituted the red wine for cranberry juice and it came out great. I also added more flour to make the broth thicker.

I've been making "My Mother's Brisket" for years and assumed the gang wouldn't be happy with anything else. Wrong. They loved this recipe. Per other suggestions I added little more flour to tighten up the gravy and mixed some dried cherries with the cranberries. What came out of the oven was delicious.

Not my cup of tea. Brisket was a bit tough, and the sauce was thin and not very flavorful. Maybe I just like a tangier brisket.

I was so excited when I saw this recipe and read the reviews. I made it exactly as it was written. At the end of 3 hours, it was still firm, so I gave it another hour of cooking. Still too firm...more cooking time. I'm at 6 hours and still have a tough brisket. I froze it, cooked it more and STILL had a firm, un- brisket like peice of meat. I will say that the sauce was delicious though. But for me, I'll go back to my grandmother's recipe...at least I can depend on it! Sorry reviewers...this one didn't even deserve one fork!

I love this dish. I used dried cherries and spread a layer of dijon mustard over the beef in the pan. After the cooking, I simmered the sauce to reduce and thicken it as I sliced the beef. The sauce developed better flavor and richer color. Mustard is a must.

I too was fooled by the reviews. Hated the rosemary flavor with brisket. Yuk! Tasted a lot like a Sunday pot roast, but fat and messy. Even w/ a trimmed brisket. Next time, but there won't be, I would pre brown or grill the mushrooms and double the cranberries. Only really tolerable if you can get a bite of these things with it. Glad I tried first before wasting my time on the fourth!

Yum, yum, this is one fabulous brisket, and a cinch to prepare! I first seared it and let it bake for about 4 1/2 hrs. It fell apart. I also added about 1/4 cup cognac to the gravy. So delicious it evaporated from dinner plates. Served with little roasted potatoes and chilled asparagus. I also made the "brisket with apricots" recipe for 15 people at Passover. It was very good, but this cranberry recipe gets my vote because it's much less time spent prepping.

Excellent. Slow cooking but practically no prep. We devoured it. I didn't have the cranberry cocktail, but did have pure cranberry juice, which I sweetened considerably with sugar. My husband loved it, and asked that I increase the number of mushrooms next time.

I served this at a dinner party and people loved it. I served it with wide egg noodles (with butter and chopped italian parsley) and green beans(with sauteed shallot and sliced toasted almonds). I sub'd crimini mushrooms for the portobello and I carmelized them prior to adding them to the sauce. Delicious. I doubled the sauce but didn't need to - there would have been enough. At the end, I removed the meat and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Delicious.

The 1st. I made this my husband and two teenage boys ate the whole thing. I have since moved from Danville, CA and have not been able to find some of the ingredients so, I have made a switch of the juice for a can of cranberry sauce and adding a bit of water. But, the other night I made this dish and I use cranberry sauce (Spiced Cranberry Sauce W Zinfandel) left over from Christmas. Zinfandel for the cup of wine and craisins, cherries would also be good. Making this in my pressure cooker reduced the time and it was out of this world. I'd do this again in a heart beat.

Wow! 159 reviews so far on this recipe. I would like to weigh in with my own variation. I use short ribs, trimmed of as much fat as possible and it works great. I also make a reduction of 1 1/4 cups balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup cabernet (reduced by half) when preparing the mushroom/cranberry sauce to make the sauce more tangy. The recipe is great as is, but my taste buds are looking for more powerful tang.

I have made many briskets and this one is by far the very best! The sauce does turn out very thin. So, what I suggest is that once the meat is cooked, pour the sauce into a saucepan. Add to the sauce a mixture of 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (or matzomeal) and 2 tablespoons of water. Boil the sauce until it thickens and then return it to the meat.

Really, really, good! The cranberries give it a nice little punch. I aded a little more wine and chicken stock when it was time to put the mushrooms and cranberries in as the meat had absorbed a fair amount of sauce after refrigeration.

This was delicious -- I too made it for Passover, and it was the best seder dinner I've ever had.

This was excellent. I doubled the sauce as recommended by everyone else. When I purchased the brisket, my butcher told me to keep some of the layer of fat because the meat will burn. But I found that not to be true. In fact the sauce helped the meat from drying out. I ended up scrapping off the fat when the meat was done. Not as pretty but still delicious!

Excellent recipe. This is the second time I have made this. Both times I followed the recipe exactly, except I used pre-sliced "baby bella" mushrooms instead of the portobellos. There was plently of sauce, and to my taste, it was the perfect consistency, not to thin and not too thick.

This was superb! As suggested, I doubled the sauce, but I cooked it in the slow-cooker for about 8 hours. When tender, I sliced it, reduced the sauce to about half, cut the mushrooms in thick slices (also suggested by another reviewer), added the cranberries and baked in the oven until the mushrooms were tender. Excellent with Goat-cheese scalloped potatoes with chive blossoms, also from this site.

This is a wonderful dish! I made it yesterday for my family and everyone loved it. I took the advice of several other reviewers and doubled the sauce (wine, broth and cranberry juice concentrate) and added some extra flour so that the gravy was extra thick (and wonderful!). I sliced the portobellos extra thick, too, because I did NOT want them melting into the gravy. I added lots of freshly ground black pepper to the recipe. This is wonderful food, the kind of food that makes you love everyone around you on a cold Sunday afternoon. I served it with Ravenswood 2000 Zinfandel. Fantastic!

Wow -- so many great reviews ! However, my family and I found nothing special about this recipe. This dish was like traditional brisket recipes with a thin gravy.

I made a practice run of this dish because I wanted to see how it would work out for passover. It was delicious. I recommend doubling the sauce and adding a couple more onions, garlic and rosemary to the sauce. I used a 6lb brisket and cooked it at 325 for 4 hours. I basted the brisket every 45 min and then kept it tightly covered with foil. When it was done I removed it from the oven and then scraped most of the fat away. I refrigerated the brisket in the sauce overnight. The next day I skimmed all the fat away and sliced it and recooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. The brisket was so tender and delicious. I recommened though grilling the portobello mushrooms first, then slicing them and placing them ontop of the sliced brisket with the cranberries. This dish really is delicious. I am substituting passover cake flour and potato starch for the flour so it can be used for passover. Enjoy

Rating: 4
Excellent. Doubled sauce but probably shouldn't have. Added 3/4" sliced mushrooms, cranberries and one sliced onion (1/2" thick) after slicing the brisket (other reviewers complained that the onion dissappeared. Later addition solved that problem). Cooked, after slicing, for about 1 1/2 hours. Very tender, very flavorful, not too sweet. Plain mashed potatoes w/ skin on were perfect accompaniment.

Rating: 4
Not only fantastic flavor but it's easy and can be made ahead - perfect for entertaining. I added a little more garlic and used a 4 1/2 pound brisket (from Costco), a cheap cab for the wine and the flavor was to die for. I think the secret to the cooking time and tenderness is making sure the roasting pan is covered tightly with foil. Mine was done in the 3 1/2 hours. I cooled it than refrigerated it unsliced. Before the final cooking I removed the top fat layer from the sauce, sliced the meat and transferred it to a serving quality roasting dish and cooked it for about 1 hour. I served it with the Potato Pancakes and a nice salad - Excellent dinner. the sauce consistency was perfect and I wouldn't add any more mushrooms or cranberries.

Really excellent -- and it got better the next day so that left-overs were an even bigger success. I recommend it for family holiday dinners. It adds a touch of class to the usual brisket meal. Hint: Buy portobello mushrooms, craisins, and whatever else you can at Costco. You can save lots.

This was fun to make! The smells from the brisket cooking were killer. When it was done I put it in a glass bowl (non reactive) and was delighted to see that protective layer of white fat that comes with any good recipe for a "potted meat" the next day. It was perfect for seeing a long movie, as I placed the brisket and (cheaper and fresher then whole portabellas) babybellas as well as the cranberries in a slow cooker for the length of the movie. Mashed potatoes and asparagus made a quick dinner, with a nice bottle of Pinot Noir and an unexpected good friend who said that this was better than anything she ever had tasted! It is sweet so beware, but very tender and special, thus a perfect NYE dinner.

Made it the first time - was a huge hit with my in-laws! Does anyone know what the Weight Watchers Points would be for this dish? Please e-mail them to me if you can. I appreciate it!

This recipe is a winner. I suggest using a Pinot Noir or Merlot, because of the light and fruity characteristics of the wine creating a perfect blend with the cranberry juice.

Made this during the holidays after my sister emailed it to me. It has become the basis of her annual Christmas Day meal. It is deliciously different, my husband raved about it and ate all the leftovers by himself. The sauce is killer and making it ahead of time makes it a cinch during the busy holidays. This will be a regular holiday meal in our house, too.

I love that you can make this the day ahead and rewarm it--so much easier to time for guests. It is a sweet dish, though, so be warned if you don't like sweet with your meat. I did really like the blend of flavors, and the meat was tender. I highly recommend.

I've tried a lot of different briskets over the years and many have been good, but this was by far the best I've had. The sauce was rich and flavorful and the meat was very tender. It also went beautifully with potato pancakes. Everyone who tasted this brisket wanted the recipe.

My guests loved this recipe and I would make it again. The missing element for me was the richness that comes from carmelizing the meat and onions prior to braising. I would dreg the brisket in flour and brown it. Remove the meat, add onions and cook them until they are brown (10 minutes or so). THen add the liquids and roast uncovered 30 minutes. The rich broth would enhance the final flavor and bring my rating to a 4.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it, even my four year old son who doesn't eat meat. I wasn't sure about the combination of cranberries and mushrooms but they were delicious together. Next time I will cut the mushrooms bigger as they tend to shrink when cooking.

I made this for a few of us before trying it for the big Chanukah dinner (15) and it was great. Instead of doubling items for the gravy I did 1 1/2 and it was delicious. The gravy was not thick but oh so flavorful and the meat was extremely tender. The mushrooms and cranberries were especially nice. I recommend it heartily

We're not really big beef eaters in our house, but this was absolutely delicious. Although the picture should be posted with this recipe, because as I recall it was the picture in the magazine that made me make it in the first place. I made it as a New Years dish, and the cranberry sauce with the beef was perfect!

Rating: 3
The sauce was very flavorful, and the meat was very tender. I think I would have liked more contrast with the cranberries - In order to reduce some of the calories I made the dish the day before and separated out the sauce, got rid of some of the fat and then replaced the sauce before adding the mushrooms/cranberries. I'll definitely make it again....great party food.

This was a huge hit with my family at the holidays. It's easy to make and makes the house smell wonderful! The cranberries are a great touch -- and the flavors work really well together. There was hardly any left over.

Excellent. Very easy. Even my son who never would touch potted meat loved it. Should have doubled the sauce. I tried pureeing the sauce to thicken it. Pureed part. It was the right consistency but turned a little grey, so I just mixed it in with the rest and it was fine. Everyone raved.

We made the change of adding the basalmic vineagar this time.Wow-it was a super idea.Thanks to David we ended up with a much richer gravy.

Rating: 4
This was really great as part of a valentines day feast. We incorperated a basalmic-cabernet reduction: As per the recipe, we made this 2 days in advance. On the next day, reduce 1 1/4 cu balsamic vinegar + 1/4 + Cabernet to about 1/2 - 1/3 volume. Scoop out most of the juices & fat from the brisket pan and add to the vinegar reduction and then add the 1 cu dried cranberries and reduce a bit further. Add 1 - 2 tblspn sugar. Pour the results back over the cut slices that are in the original brisket pan and back in the fridge it goes. We later re-heated this (as per the recipe) on valentines day with whole portobellos (cut into heart shapes of course)...

I served this to my dinner guests and received nothing but rave reviews. Usually I make some changes in new recipes; but, not this time. It is perfect as it stands. Can't tell you how pleased I was, and definitely will make it again--over and over. Thanks so much for sharing.

made this for a family dinner and they liked it a lot. However, although the sauce was rich and flavorful, somehow the flavor seemed a little sour. I love the concept but probably wouldnt make it again. the portobellos also disappeared during the 30 minute cooking time so I should havecut them into larger pieces.

Rating: 4
I have to join the group who raved about this dish. I made it as part of our annual Christmas Eve buffet. It was terrific. I especially liked it because you can get it ready the day or two before and just warm it up before serving--a real advantage when you need to get several dishes ready all at once for a sizable buffet.

Recipe came from my sister in law in Pa. My wife fixed it for my birthday. My sister in law was at the dinner and passed it to her daughter in Houston. We had it for a dinner party for eight and each couple wanted the recipe. It's a hit.

I served this for a dinner party of eight last night. I bought a five pound brisket so as to have leftovers. My guests all had seconds and some thirds. There are no leftovers. As recommended by other reviewers, I doubled the sauce. This dish makes a beautiful presentation, is an absolute crowd pleaser, and delicious.

This recipe is over rated thus far. It is interesting for the first couple of bites and then gets boring quickly.

What a hit. I made this for my husband's family celebrating a Texas Christmas together. Two brothers, one from Florida and one from NY, were dismayed that the brisket was not barbequed. But, once they tasted it and had it for leftovers they raved about it. I even had a 15 year old niece tell me how good it was. I would not have changed one ingredient. It was perfect.

Rating: 2
although the flavor of this recipe was interesting, it was far more time consuming than the recipe indicated; in order to get the brisket appropriately tender, i needed to cook it an additional 3 hours! in addition, the meat was stringy, and the amount of mushrooms needed to be more than doubled, and the onions had completely broken down by the time the dish was done. on a positive note, i did add carrots to the dish, which developed a lovely flavor.

I made this for an annual "fancy-schmantzy" dinner with friends. It was accompanied by a couple of terrific sides, but folks just kept eating and eating this! I chilled this for only about 3 hours prior to slicing, but it sliced nicely with just that much. I found that the recipe produced lots of sauce, so I wouldn't change the proportions myself. The added butter, mentioned by another reviewer added just the right balance. Fine recipe.

What a tasty, satisfying, and simple dish to make. It will be a holiday tradition for my family. I used fresh rosemary, Gallo burgundy, and made it a day ahead. Everyone absolutely loved it.

Excellent recipe! Served it to guests who devoured it and heaped praise upon it. Two suggestions: cut down on the rosemary to one tablespoon and make sure to let it sit overnight. It is MUCH better the second day.

If doing a 4lb brisket, I would double the sauce quantity as everyone loved the sauce. Might not double the amount of dried cranberries in the sauce, maybe just up it by 50%.

Rating: 4
Like many others who have reviewed this recipe, I have to say this was the best brisket I've ever had. SO tender and tasty--the whole family devoured it. The only changes I made: I chilled the brisket overnight before slicing it with an electric knife, so the slices held together beautifully. I also used homemade stock and cut back on the rosemary a bit--and whisked in a few tablespoons of butter into the sauce. Superb recipe.

*Thought this would be good given the list of great reviews. Boring and very disappointing. Would not make again, no one in family enjoyed.

Wonderful recipe! A snap to make and delicious, a definite keeper. Due to time constraints, I made and served it the same day -- cooked it at 300 degrees for 3 hours, added the mushrooms/cranberries and cooked for another 45 minutes or so. Came out great. Can't wait to try it again, with at least on overnight cooling period, as suggested by the recipe. All in all, a new holiday tradition for us.

This was a wonderful change from my usual "onion soup mix" brisket for our Rosh Hashanah dinner. Needing more than 4lb, (17 guests), and wanting to follow the recipe exactly to ensure best results, I made 2 separate 4lb briskets, 2 days in advance. It was soft, tasty, and got raves from everyone. I suggest you use a good quality dry red wine in the sauce, and make sure you used UNSWEETENED dry cranberries, not "Craisins".

Rating: 4
Without a doubt...the best brisket we've ever had! This recipe is a real "dress-up" to the standard brisket fare. Make sure you cook slow and low (temp.)... for me it took 4 1/2 hrs. for the meat to soften.

I loved this recipe. I made it for dinner guests who are used to my cooking and always enjoy coming to my house for dinner. They could not believe how good brisket can really be. I had some leftovers and it was even better two days latter. My mother came over and almost fainted with pleasure. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't have a problem. Enjoy! This is one recipe worth making - take it from me, and I'm an excellent cook....

For Passover I made this two days in advance without the mushrooms and it was a big hit. In fact, there was very little left even though I served it alongside wonderful herb-roasted turkey and a bunch of good side dishes. Even my husband, who eats rare meat only, found it acceptable. I don't eat red meat, but I would definitely make this again for those who do.

This was just absolutely fabulous. How do I know?, my jewish mother wants the recipe... and I used to make lousy brisket; tough and not all that edible. This finishes with a tasty, almost tangy gravy. By far, the best brisket recipe I've ever had. It is elegant, and delicious. It also reheats easily and makes great sandwiches the next few days. Get the biggest brisket you can, follow the easy instructions, then just sit down and enjoy.

WOW..This is fabulous..don't doubt it..it comes together after you reheat it with the mushrooms and cranberry..the men at my table were going on and on about this dish....it really is very tasty, and pretty also, i wouldn't go so thin on the slicing of the meat....
