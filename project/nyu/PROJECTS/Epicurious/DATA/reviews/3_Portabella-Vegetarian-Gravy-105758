Although this recipe has nothing to do with mushrooms, it is a great vegetarian gravy! Perhaps it is meant to go over portabella mushrooms? Either that or a very important ingredient is inadvertently left out!

I've been making this on Thanksgiving for the last three years for the vegetarians in the family. This year I got distracted and used double the amount of mushrooms (1 pound instead of 1/2.) It was sensational with a really deep mushroom flavor. Everyone loved it, and I actually prefer it to the turkey gravy. I also leave out the red peppers from the stock recipe, and I don't use the cream in the gravy. In my opinion, it's unnecessary. This has become a permanent part of my Thanksgiving menu (and thank goodness it's over until next year!).

This recipe is delicious, though I think it's a lot of work, personally. And to those asking -where are the mushrooms- they are in the vegetable stock recipe. Click on the recipe where it says -vegetable stock- and you'll be linked to that recipe, and all the work!

I've been making the portabella stock and gravy since the receipe appeared in Gourmet magazine in 2001. The stock is great for moistening a side of vegetarian stuffing too. The stuffing and gravy have received thumbs up from vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

Absolutely delicious gravy but be prepared for the work and the relative expense- that's a lot of mushrooms, which are quite pricey where I live.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! My husband is a vegetarian, and we could not be happier using this gravy for the both of us! I made it at Thanksgiving last year, and it got raves. We would reccomend it to anyone! =0)

I can only give 3 stars as I only made the vegetable stock (1/2 recipe). I omitted the bell pepper & fresh parsley but was very pleased with the out come. I will use this stock at a later date and follow the original gravy directions.

I wondered for a while where were the mushrooms? As other reviewers have mentioned, they are in the stock. Click on the link and there is the recipe...

This gravy was such a big hit at last year's Thanksgiving that there was serious disappointment when I did not make it again this year (because I did not think we were having any non-turkey eaters, but turns out everyone else liked it, too. So, it is being requested for Christmas. I used canned tomatoes, but used the good Italian plum tomatoes. I omitted the red peppers, as some of our group are allergic to them. The real key, though is: MORE MUSHROOMS. I actually increased the amount of portabella in the original stock recipe, and then still felt it needed intensification of flavor at the end, so sauteed and pureed some more and stirred it in. You also need to adjust the seasoning of the finished gravy to taste, of course.

You could also use the Roasted Vegetable Broth found in this site instead of the Vegetable Stock!

I made this for Thanksgiving and I thought it turned out well. I agree that the canned tomatoes detracted, rather than added to the flavor. It made the gravy a little too sweet. I will definitely make this again, but I will leave out the canned tomatoes and add more mushrooms. Everyone at the table thought it was very good, even the non-vegetarians.

For the unitiated--although the recipe fails to specify, umpeeled shallots must be very thoroughly washed--or else you're going to get a gritty product. In any event the overall result was a big disapointment because the taste and texture of canned tomatoes predominates, and the subtle flavor of mushrooms doesn't come through at all.

The mushrooms are in the vegetable stock.

Is this a joke? Where are the mushrooms?
