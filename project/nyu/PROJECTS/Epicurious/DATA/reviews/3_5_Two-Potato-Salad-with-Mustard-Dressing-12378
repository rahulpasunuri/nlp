I made a different version, with just sweet potatoes, onion and steamed green beans plus the dressing. Both my husband & I thought it delicious... with pork chops.

I made this recipe for a BBQ. Everyone loved it. There was no left overs, so that is always good.

I did not have any sweet potatoes. I boiled the small white potatoes and cut them in quarters and left the skin on. I added chopped celery and chopped daikon. It was easy and tasty.

This is a great dish to take to a pot luck. Very pretty, if you can call a potato salad that. I've made it a few times, and it always gets rave reviews. I like to add more mustard & sweet pickles than called for - it gives the salad more of a zing.

This was a big hit at my house. I boiled the potatoes instead of steaming and the sweet potatoes were a little overcooked so next time I'd put them in a little later. Otherwise, this will definitely be available at my house through the summer.

The recipe doesn't mention whether to peel the potatoes. I did peel the sweet and left the skins on the Yukon Golds. I did find that after the max steaming time, the various potaotes were at various degrees of doneness.

Yummy! I have made this about 4 times this summer and it is always a hit!

Wow. I don't know if I will ever make a traditional mayo potato salad ever again. This was excellent! I used red potatoes as well, but I boiled instead of steamed both the red and the sweet potatoes together so the sweet taters were a little mushy since they cooked a bit faster than the red. It didn't matter to me though! It was such a great flavor combination and it looked beautiful. I didn't measure the onions, peppers or gherkins, I just threw in how much I liked of each. Yum, yum. Will definitely make this often this summer. Enjoy!

This is a very good recipe. Nice break from the mundane mayo based white potato salad. Healthful and flavorful - two things I always strive to achieve. I like it with dill pickles instead of sweet, but that's just a personal preference.

Sounds interesting, and with all of the great reviews, I can't wait to try this one. A gherkin is a small, sweet pickle. :)

i would love to try this recipe, since everyone seems to love it, but i have a question, could anyone tell me what gherkin is?

It looked beautiful and tasted even better.

This is an OUTSTANDING potato salad -- just different enough, but still something most people would like. The recipe needs a little salt. Use waxy red potatoes, not crumbly ones. I'd definitely double the recipe since I ate half of it before it ever made it to the table. Also, it's good warm.

This is one of my all time favorites. My father used to make this in the summer. I was so happy to find the recipe!

This is a delicious replacement for regular potato salad. I made it for a barbecue party and got rave reviews. Some people thought it was strange but still like it.

This is just an ordinary potato salad with a little sweet potato for interest.

I do not want to sound overly enthusiastic, but . . . this potato salad is a simple, delicious alternative to a traditional potato salad. (I did add fresh, crumbled bacon to the salad before serving, though.) The salad was superb as part of a summer holiday picnic--cold fried chicken, fresh corn and fresh tomatoes rounded out the menu.
