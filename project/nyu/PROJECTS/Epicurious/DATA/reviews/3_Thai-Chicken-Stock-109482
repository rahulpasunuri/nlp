I have made chicken stock in the past and this certainly does the trick. However, I was disappointed that the broth did not have more "thai" flavor. I actually doubled the cilantro, garlic and ginger - I double the spices in most recipes. Still, it had only a very mild thai flavor. Try a recipe with traditional flavors like celery, carrot, turnip, parsley, etc. More flavor.

Great asian stock. I used new Swawson chichen stock, 3 slices of ginger, 1/2 cup parsley stems, roasted garlic and lemon grass paste (couldn't find fresh). So simple and so good!

An absolutely wonderful stock to keep in the freezer for any recipe! In my opinion it did need to be cooked down about a half-inch or so for a stronger flavor but I will never buy canned chicken stock again. This can be adapted to suit any recipe. Also, I put it in the fridge immediately after cooking and removed the fat very easily the next day.
