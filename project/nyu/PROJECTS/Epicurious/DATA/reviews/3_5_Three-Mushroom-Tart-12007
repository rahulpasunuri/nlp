My variations on the dish: Whole wheat crust Omit enoki-dake mushrooms Replaced sherry with white wine and butter with olive oil Sliced instead of minced mushrooms Added bit of fresh parsley into mixture Sprinkled pine nuts sparingly on top before baking No fresh mushroom topping Added lemon juice directly into mixture It made a thin and delicate looking tart (having made shallow shells), was flavourful and tangy, although I may have gone too heavy with the Worcestershire thinking back. It would be fun to play around with different kinds of mushrooms as well- improvisation is part of the fun!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and I chose it from a search of mushroom tarts on Epicurious because it was the easiest to make and the filling could be made ahead. The flavor was okay, although I may have gone too heavy on the lemon, which was powerful. I agree with other reviewers that some herbs or garlic might give it more flavor depth. The problem is that the filling looks gross, greyish and mucky, and although I covered the whole tart with fresh sliced mushrooms, including the enoki, when sliced into, you can't get away from the goo. I will probably try a different mushroom tart next time that doesn't have such a liquidy filling. And yes, the crust gets soggy. Overall, though, it's not bad, and quite easy.

yum! I used vermouth instead of sherry and added a handful of chopped spinach to the mushroom filling for some colour. Try different types of mushrooms for a subtle change to the taste and if, like me, you like puff pastry, leave the crust on!

The filling was awesome (didn't change a thing) but I made it the day before and reheated it. The crust got soggy, so I wouldn't do it that way again. Served as a first course and was loved by all.

I made this for a gathering pressing puff pastry in muffin pan. The outcome was passable but nothing to rave about. Plus, the mushroom filling did not look very appettizing (although I decorated the tops with slices to make it prettier. I'll keep looking for a better filling...

My friend made this for me - using a whole wheat, frozen, crust - and it was awesome. I'm going to make it for Thanksgiving!

made it the first time as written and was a good base recipe. made it again the next day, but added garlic and herbs and 1/2 onion. Much better flavor. Lots you can do with this recipe based on what you may have in stock.

Add tarragon, thyme and some soy sauce (preferably ponzu) for more depth in flavor.

Wonderful recipe! I also added some garlic. This is a very versatile recipe. I used it as a first dish at a dinner party. Making the filling a day ahead makes last-minute preparations very easy. It would also be perfect with soup or salad for a light brunch or as tiny individual puffs at a party.

Good flavor. I used 4 types of mushrooms - Included Oyster Mushrooms in Filling. I particularly liked being able to prepare filling the day before. Will make again

I garnished the top of the tart with reconstituted dried morels and omitted the lemon. Delicious!

I made this as a side dish for Easter and we loved it..I agree make two as they are smaller and labor intensive if you don't use a processor. Also used regular sliced mushrooms on the top.

A big hit with our dinner club! I made it in a 9-inch tart pan, but will certainly try the individual tarts next time.

Incredible! This is a huge crowd pleaser. I also make it as a "strudel" encased in filo or puff pastry or as mini art, puff pastry squares pressed into mini muffin pan. Latter is the best if you ask me.

A breeze to make a day ahead of time and then reheat. Excellent first course. Enoki mushrooms are good but not crucial to the recipe.

Make two - they go fast - and make the filling a day ahead to enhance the flavor. It will be the favorite appetizer.

I rarely repeat recipes as I always like to try something new. But this recipe warrants repeating. It is easy to make, can be made in advance, and is versatile. The filling is delicious, and you can make this with a number of different mushrooms. This is always one of the first things to go when I make it.

Excellent. Great mushroom flavor. Would have been great for a party. Was a little difficult to match something with for dinner? Does anyone have any suggestions?
