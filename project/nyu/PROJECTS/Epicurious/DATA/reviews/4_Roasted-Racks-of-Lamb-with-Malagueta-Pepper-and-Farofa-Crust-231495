I was feeling adventurous, so I went to the web site suggested in this article and ordered the flour and the peppers to make a truly authentic dish. I make rack of lamb several times a year as a special meal for my husband and me. This one is one of the very best I have ever made! The flavors were terrific, and I really liked the consistency of that flour. In fact, I may use that flour again in place of bread crumbs in other R of L recipes. I would not change a thing in the recipe! I also made the squash/coconut soup and the collard greens that were part of the menu, along with the espresso meringue dessert. With Brazilian music playing in the background, this was truly romantic meal on Valentine's weekend!
