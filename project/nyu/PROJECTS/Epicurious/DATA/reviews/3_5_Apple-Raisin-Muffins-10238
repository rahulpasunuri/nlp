Don't skip on the raisins like I did! I'm not a big raisin fan so I didn't add them, but they would have been better with the raisins.

Love, these, but I only got nine muffins. Regular size ones. They aren't even huge. I left out the walnuts, but otherwise, didn't change anything.

Yummy and healthy! I added 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal and subbed 1c of whole milk plain yogurt for the sour cream. Turned out great!

Perfect little moist muffins! I added 2 tbsp of melted butter and apple pie spice for a "southern" taste, exchanged the raisins for dried cherries and added almonds. I'll use this recipe again!

These muffins aren't really anything special. I think it's a good standard recipe.

These were great for breakfast because they were not too sweet. Here is some of what I wrote on my blog (http://afreshstarteachday.blogspot.com/) about my experience with this recipe: To spice things up, I used New Zealand dried sweet apples, oats, and an extra dash of cinnamon. Sour cream and a single egg added a slight tenderness that held the otherwise crumbly dough together. The molasses-like tinge of the raisins heavily complemented the sweet chewy apples and woodsy walnut pieces, while the oats created the illusion of a wholesome goodness!

Since other reviews focus on using fresh apples, I just wanted to say this recipe is great with dried apples (which we always have a lot of from our trees) and it's nice to find such a good recipe using them. I use 1 c white and 1/2 c whole wheat flour. When the kids are home (not fans of nuts in baked goods), I use 1/2 c wheat germ in place of the walnuts.

i thought this recipe made great muffins, of course i made a few changes though. i substituted about 3/4 cup of vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and added apple butter to fill it up to a cup. i also used fresh granny smith apples like others previously mentioned.

Here are some adjustments for eliminating wheat and dairy, and for using a fresh apple, which I had on hand, istead of dried. I also reduced the sugar and fat, and it's STILL a great recipe. It came out really yummy! (I just made it a 2nd time.) Instead of wheat flour, use whole spelt flour. (Or mix spelt and garbanzo or brown rice flour. I used 1 c. spelt, 1/2 c. rice flour.) Skip the sour cream, and use 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and 1/8 c. soymilk. For the apple, I threw a cored med-lg apple in the food processor with skin, and pulsed it for very course chopping. I reduced the brown sugar to 5/8 c. (1/2 plus 1/8 c.), and the walnuts to 1/2 c. Great out of the oven, but tasted even better the 2nd day.

These are great muffins. I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of fresh chopped apples. I used 1 cup vanilla yogurt (instead of the 2 cups of sour cream I should have used for doubling) and with the fresh apples, it was plenty moist. I only had 1 cup brown sugar, so I used 1/2 cup white sugar in addition, and it was plenty sweet. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking for a sweet top. Made 12 big muffins and 12 mini muffins.

fluffy, yummy muffins! per previous reviewers, i made the following modifications: * instead of 1 c. sour cream, i used 1/3 c. sour cream + 1/3 c. yogurt * instead of dried apples, nuts, raisins, i used 2 small fresh apples chopped * instead of 1 c. brown sugar, i used 3/4 c. * i sprinkled the tops with cinnamon + sugar before putting into the oven * i only used the mixer to beat the eggs and sugar. after that, i mixed by hand. maybe that's why my muffins came out fluffy and not dense. my yield was 12 muffins too.

Thanks to other reviews, I used 1 fresh apple, grated & squeezed dry instead of dried apple. This was about 1/2 cup of apple; next time I'll use more. Used 1/2 c. nuts. Also subbed 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 3/4 c. all-purposed flour instead of all all-purpose flour (get a little more whole grain in there). I think it would be good with oatmeal, but I don't know if that should replace some of the flour or be in addition to flour. Anyone know?

I think these are very good-my husband really likes them and they are so simple to make. My kids don't like raisins or nuts. I used 2 fresh granny smith apples. I used 1/3 cup light sour cream and 1/3 cup nonfat yogurt to cut the calories. I added a pinch of salt and then we sprinkled sugar on top for the appearance. Not mushy, not amazing, but worth making.

This is a great recipe--my only changes, per the other suggestios, was to substitute one small apple, coarsely chopped, for the dried apples, and to leave out the nuts. With the apple and the raisins, there was no room left in the batter for any more stuff! The muffins were great, very moist (maybe a little too moist), but not dense at all. After using the mixer to blend the sour cream in, I just used a spatula to fold in the rest of the ingredients to avoid toughness of the batter.

muffins were great--moist and dense. Only substitution was yogurt for sour cream, and used an apple (so old it was almost dried!) shredded and squeezed. yummy!

These muffins turned out fantastic. Very moist and light. However, I made the following changes. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour; 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup peanut oil (or any vegetable oil); 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (maybe 2 tablespoons less). 1 apple chopped instead of dried apples. I baked them for 12 minutes in a convection oven which heats faster. I did not add raisins or nuts.

This is the worst muffin recipe I have tried on this site. Too dense and the paper didn't come off. Oil or butter somewhere in the recipe would have helped. Only had enough batter for 12 muffin cups.

I was surprised with the range of reviews for this recipe. I too used a fresh apple and also took the advice to reduce the sour cream (I used more than 1/3 c.) and I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. They are dense and tastey. I appreciate a muffing that rises more than this recipe. I will make these again because the brown sugar makes them taste so nice. I also added 1/4 tsp. cardamom because I love cardamom.

These muffins were really good. I used fresh Granny Smith apples and plump raisins, omitting the walnuts because I don't really like nuts in bread, and they were wonderful. My only problem was that the recipe said it makes 16 muffins, and I only got 12 small muffins out of it. Did they mean mini-muffins? Anyway, other than that they were "excelemundo" according to my boyfriend.

Excellent ! Using fresh apples, it's better to reduce a little the quantity of sour cream. Maybe you'll want to use only 3/4 cup of brown sugar as it is a little too sweet. Would be also perfect if made with raspberries and a little lemon zest.

Best basic muffin recipe ever! I often change the ingredients but my usual is rasperries with a mix of almond/hazelnut. Bake them every Sunday and offer some to my colleagues at work on Mondays. They just rave!

I used fresh, tart apples in this recipe. The muffins were dark, dense and delicious. And divine. And I'm not a fan of fruity breads.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, except I used fresh apple in place of the dried (chopped to roughly 1/2 inch chunks), and used fat free sour cream instead of regular. The muffins turned out well for me and were tasty--rubbery (cook below) may have been from overmixing? Recipe says to beat dry into wet--I have never been successful that way, and much prefer a wooden spoon at that stage, so I stopped using the mixer after the vanilla had been beaten into the sour cream mixture. Next time I think I would omit the walnuts; the muffins were a bit too full of stuff, believe it or not! Very tasty though, and fat free sour cream worked fine.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh apples. The muffins did not rise, and were rubbery. I had to throw them out. I couldn't serve them to my brunch guests. Would not make them again.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought this bread was so bad I had to throw it out. I used fresh apples and it was pasty and tasteless! When they say add a pinch of salt, maybe I added too little? Anyway, I don't even think it's worth trying again using dried apples...

I also used fresh apples and the muffins came out very well. This recipe was simple and quick and is perfect for an autumn brunch menu.

I also used fresh apples instead of dried and the muffins were scrumptious. Really moist and dense and flavorful. Will definitely be making these again.

These are really good muffins. Like the cook from Germany we made changes according to the contents of our pantry. We used chopped fresh pear, toasted pecans and omitted the raisins. They were delicious. Next time I'll double the recipe because these were gone in no time.

Making it in Germany on a weekend when shops are shut I had to get creative with what was in the kitchen... I replaced the brown sugar with half cup white sugar, used fresh apples, replaced half the sour cream with buttermilk, used vanilla rum extract, and replaced the raisins with 3/4 C of chopped hazelnuts (no walnuts)... they were great but the brown sugar would have been better!

I made two changes: I used the same amount of fresh apples, coarsely chopped and I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the muffins prior to baking. EXCELLENT.

To Whom It my Concern: I like very much your apple raisin muffin, but please just reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup only. The taste is great. Thank you and more power to your site. I love you recipes it is very simple and easy to follow. God bless you, Lynz:)
