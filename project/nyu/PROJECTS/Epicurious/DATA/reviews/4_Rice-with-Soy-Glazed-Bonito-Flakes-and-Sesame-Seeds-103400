@ Cook from telluride - you can use post-dashi kombu in pickles  I used it today in a batch of asazuke well be eating tomorrow. I toss the kombu in the freezer in a ziplock if I'm not going to use it right away, which makes it even easier to cut into nice thin strips. The first time I made dashi it seemed so wasteful to toss out the bonito & kombu, per my cookbooks instrux, and this recipes a great use of the leftover bonito. You might also want to check out this homemade furikake - http://naokomoore.com/2009/12/what-to-do-with-leftover-dashi.html - the author uses both the kombu and the bonito flakes together to make a rice topping like this one.

The link to the dashi recipe isn't correct - it takes you to a recipe for cherry almond crisp.

A great use for leftover bonito flakes once you've made dashi. Excellent with rice.

Easy, tasty, and a great use for the bonito flakes after making dashi stock. Now I need to figure out what to do with leftover kombu. This topping is great over tofu that is drizzled with soy sauce, too.

My boyfriend doesn't like rice, but this gave it such a great kick, he loved it and had two helpings! It turned out looking just like the picture, except I had a lot more of the bonito flakes, which was great! This is a keeper!

This was my first experience with bonito. It was very simple to prepare, and has a kind of addictive quality - as I ate, I really started to like it. It turned out almost black, though, thanks to the soy sauce. Not at all like the picture. Instead of chopping the flakes after moistening (if using fresh flakes instead of the left-over ones), measure flakes into a bowl and crush them with your fingers. They are quite brittle. This is a good simple rice topping when you are serving other Japanese or Asian dishes.
