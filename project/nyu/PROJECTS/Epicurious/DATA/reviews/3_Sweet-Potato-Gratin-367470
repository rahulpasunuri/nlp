Is the cheese missing? This is a dauphinois not a gratin. Please advise.

The dish is really good and easy to make -- just make sure you have enough cream to cover the sweet potatoes -- that is the key.

An elegant dish- and yes the salt and pepper was important. The combination of seasonings and cream made for a decadent, silky, savory dish. I pureed the leftovers with chicken stock and now this sweet potato soup puree sits in the freezer awaiting Christmas eve.

Nice change of pace - rich rather than sweet - good for those who are not fans of sweet potatoes especially if sliced thin - worked better with orange sweet potatoes than white sweet potatoes - important to use salt and pepper

This recipe didn't have much depth of flavor. The spices made it reminiscent of the holidays, but there wasn't much taste. I prefer regular sweet potatoes with butter and brown sugar to this. I won't make it again.

Can this be frozen? If so, at what stage?
