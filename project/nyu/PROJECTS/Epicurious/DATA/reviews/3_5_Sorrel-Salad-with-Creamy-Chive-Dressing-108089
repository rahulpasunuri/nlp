It;s ok...certainly not a ten. The sorrel added to the lettuce is wonderful. I think you could do it with any salad and use a better dressing.

I'm growing sorrel this year so I have been looking for ways to use it. I have made this salad many times. I love the creamy dressing.

I "discovered" sorrel last year and found this recipe while looking for alternative uses (besides soup). I followed the recipe and found the flavors refreshing. Maybe the reviewer who found it bland substituted another green for the sorrel. A great alternative the standard green salad.

Great recipe! Delicious! I did make a few changes: I used sour cream instead of yogurt because I didn't have yogurt on hand. I used 3 packets of Splenda instead of sugar, and because I really abhor Dijon mustard I used Maui Onion Mustard. For the Salad I didn't have terragon on hand, so I used 2 table. fresh fennel fronds, which has the same licorice taste that terragon has. My husband and I thought this was one of the best salads I've made, and we are big salad eaters.

My husband and I adored this salad and the dressing (although I will reduce the sugar a bit next time). I am constantly searching for uses of the sorrel that I grow, other than rich sorrel soup. This was perfect on the sorrel, frisee and romaine. I didn't have any tarragon so julienned a couple of fresh basil leaves instead. I added some slice of hearts of palm and grape tomatoes, just because I had them around. This will be a standard during sorrel season.

My husband insists on growing sorrel (I really don't like it much), and it grows like a weed, so I'm always looking for a recipe that uses it. This one was quite good: the dressing toned down the sharp sourness of the sorrel nicely, and the texture of the frisee was an excellent addition. Since the dressing was designed to counterbalance the very piquant flavors of the greens, I can see where it would be very bland on any other type of greens. However, the dressing can easily be dressed up with garlic, mint, cucumbre, etc, for a middle eastern style dressing. Hopefully this helps any cooks considering the dressing portion of this recipe.

I find it hard to believe that folks found this bland! Sorrel has a sour-lemony flavour and frisee has a bitter edge. I find no problem with the dressing. Maybe people are fudging on the greens as they are quite piquant on their own and the dressing soothes it down in flavour and texture.

No, the percentage refers to whether people would make the recipe again (yes/no). Neither of the reviewers said they would make it again.

There is a mistake in your rating. Although the two comments would add up to a 37%, you have it listed at 0%.

I added minced garlic automatically. It still didn't have much to recommend it so I let it sit in the fridge for an hour. Still no go. Needs a lot of work.

Curiously devoid of flavor. I added feta to the salad to jack up flavor but there are better dressings out there.
