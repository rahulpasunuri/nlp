The recipe mentions an egg in the ingredient list, then neglects to say where to add it! I didn't realize I had missed the addition until I was 1/3 of the way through adding my flour mixture. I whisked the egg and stirred it into the mix, and the cookies turned out fine. They took slightly longer than the 15 minutes in the recipe - closer to 20 or 25 - but the taste was delicious!

I didn't do the gingersnaps yet but the ice cream is just like we had at Old Salem with Gingerbread. Yummy.

I have to give this 4 forks because of the ice cream, not the cookie. I've made the cookies but never bothered with making a sandwich - I just serve smaller cookies along side and guest can crumble on top or bite at will. The cookie needs more ginger but even then, it will pale in comparisson to the ice cream which I never make without doubling the recipe.

These cookies were wonderful. I served them with the lemon ice cream and candied lemon peel. The flavors blended perfectly, but these cookies could stand on their own.

This recipe was delicious. I made a parfait out of it and layered the gingersnap crumbles between scoops of ice cream and topped with crumbled pistachios. Quite impressive!

This is the second time I have made the lemon ice cream. It is out of this world. I used half heavy cream and half 2%milk instead of the "half and half". It turned out the same, just as good. The gingersnaps are wonderful too, although I would rather eat them separately from the ice cream. If you think they are too crispy, bake them for a shorter amount of time,maybe 12 minutes. That is what I did and they turned out chewy not crisp. But that lemon ice cream cannot be matched by any other name brand. If you like lemons, you have to try this!!!

The ginger-lemon flavor combination is excellent, but the ice cream really steals the show! After the first serving, my guests requested the recipe! However,I agree with a previous reviewers - the gingersnaps are too big, thick and hard to make sandwiches. For those wanting sandwiches, I would suggest undercooking the snaps so as to make them very soft like the outer chocolate layers of a traditional ice cream sandwich. Otherwise, the ice cream will squish out the side. Next time, I will serve it parfait-style as another reviewer suggested. One more idea: I tried the ice cream with some specialty boxed Ginger Crisps made by Peek Freans which I purchased at Publix. The thinness of the cookie and mild ginger taste complemented the delicate flavor of the ice cream and would save you the time and trouble of having to make cookies.

This was like a little piece of heaven . . . The gingersnap recipe was the best I've ever used. We made the cookies again with vanilla chips . . . Wow! It was fabulous.

These were just delicious and easy. I am partial to spices from Penzey's and I used their Vietnamese cinnamon, but any cinnamon would work fine. They are excellent with the lemon ice cream but equally delicious by them selves.

The lemon ice cream has wonderful fllavor and texture. The cookies are also good, but not good to make ice cream sandwiches. I made gingerbread cookies instead and cut them out in 4'' circles. Flat cookies make much better sandwiches! The two fllavors together are great.

I didn't think any recipe could replicate the wonderful flavor of lemon ice cream found in Italy. Not only did this compare, it might even be better! I agree with one of the other reviewers - serve the ice cream with the cookies on the side. By the time the cookies are thawed enough to bite into, the ice cream is too soft and squishes out the side.

The ice cream is wonderful--beats anything you can buy in a store by a mile. In fact, it's too good to hide with those gingersnap cookies, although a few aren't bad. I also found it hard to keep the ice cream from melting when I placed it in the gingersnaps, even though the latter had fully cooled and no matter how quickly I headed for the freezer.

I made this for my husband's family and served them on the 4th of July. Everyone loved these, even my husband, who is NOT a fan of lemon ice cream or molasses cookies. There is something about the combination of flavors that is more than the sum of its ingredients. Delicious!!!

These ice cream sandwiches are so refreshing and delicious. The ginger cookies and the lemon ice cream are wonderful recipes in and of themselves. I will definately make these again.

The gingersnaps in this recipe are among the best I've ever made. I'm so happy to have found this recipe again, I thought it was lost forever in my files! Be careful though, the recipe neglects to say where to add the egg; it should be added after the molasses.
