This is truly exquisite. I served it with plain thin rice noodles (not as rolls), with all the vegetables/toppings, sort of the way bowls with noodles and grilled meat are served in Vietnamese restaurants. I also doubled the recipe, otherwise followed it completely. Incredibly good, a good-restaurant quality. And not difficult at all, although, as with most Vietnamese, Thai, etc. dishes, it takes a while to assemble it all. I am most certainly making this again.

Huband thought this dish was absolutely delicious!! Made dish according to recipe, but used a whole habanero and hubby squirted in probably another Tbs. of Sriracha into the beef sauce. The sweet notes in the overall dish complemented the heat nicely. Followed previous reviewers suggestion and added rice noodles as another condiment. If you like heat, you'll love this dish... also, wasn't too hot as to take away from the other flavors

ok, so I used a red jalapeno...

4 forks because of the chili sauce! The beef is delicious, but the sauce, as previously menstioned, makes the dish! Surprinsingly, I made the dish as written, and used flat iron (it took a little less time to cook the beef). in the future, I will add a little curry paste before the coconut milk.

Great dish! We enjoyed it with brown rice and as lettuce wraps. We have leftover sauce so I'm going to try the dish with pork.

Very flavorful dish. I served the beef over rice and sprinkled some of the ondiments over the top with the chili garlic sauce. I left out the coconut milk and thought it had enough sauce. Will try with it next time. the only other change was to use a milder chili. I think it would be really hot with the habanero!

Fantastic recipe! I have been making this for years and we think it is perfect. Not too sweet nor too hot (for us...if you don't like spicy, use different pepper than habanero). It can be a bit messy, but SO worth the effort. All of the flavors meld so beautifully together. Always get raves when I serve this!

This is an excellent recipe easy to follow and the results are mouth watering, if to hot omit the habanero pepper. Ive made it many times and it is always is a crowd pleaser.

With my husband not knowing this recipe came from a great restaurant, he said he would have asked for the recipe had he ordered this. I loved it, but felt the sauces were too much for the lettuce to handle. I had some leftover brown rice. My husband used that to soak up the wonderful sauces.

fantastic - loved it, followed the recipe as directed and steamed some jasmin rice on the side - delicious melding of flavors ...

I did make this and assembled as a salad.awesome. I did cut the pepper down to a half of a large serrano. It was good for me. The butter lettuce and the spicy sweet beef. I would make this again for sure.

This was great and very easy. I didn't make the chile-garlic sauce, used store bought due to time constraints. All flavors came together beautifully and we'll definitely have this again. I agree with Sandie, this would make an excellent salad with lettuce as base vs. wraps.

We liked this very much and it was not difficult to make. It's very flavorful and satisfying without being heavy. I will probably double the recipe next time so we'd have the possibility of leftovers, which work well assembled as a salad.

Wow! The recipe is good, but the chile-garlic sauce makes this dish great. It was restaurant-quality good! I had no trouble making it exactly as instructed; it should be thick but clear when you're done. Do add the coconut milk--it makes the meat saucy. I used sirloin and just let it stew for a bit longer, which made it quite tender.

This was fabulous! I didn't add the coconut milk at the end and it was still wonderful. My husband keeps asking me to make this over and over again. Definitely on the list for my next dinner party!

Sounds to me like Justin from Vancouver used Pepe's Coco Loco or some such sugary cocktail making crud....too sweet HAH!! Coconut milk isn't very sweet at ALL :)

Holy oh my good food yummy ugh! I didn't have all the ingredients (like the rice wine or the pepper sauce), but I made my own variation with sweet vermouth and "pick-a-pepper" and wow. I finally got to use that can of coconut milk that's been sitting there. What a great use for it. All the condiments were too taxing for just myself (but I do belive it would be fun for a dinner party), so what I did was heat up a spinach tortilla (wrap), throw on some lettuce, squirt some lemon juice on it, add the beef and the sauce and it was marvelous! Also, because I had it in the pantry, I added bamboo shoots and waterchestnuts during the 20 minute saute. I also had some roasted red pepper in the fridge I needed to use so I threw that in there for some color. I did add a little extra salt in the end and some garlic powder to give the beef a little more flavor, since I didn't use very high quality meat and it needed it. I served it with a cocktail of orange juice and club soda, a nice mild beverage to cool the intensity. One other thing, I used a serrano pepper instead of the worlds hottest pepper, habenero. It was PLENTY spicey and I think overnight it will intensify a hair. Yee Hoo I have lunch tomorrow! ENJOY!

I've made this dish many times for friends and family and got raves everytime. They ask me to make this when I invite them over. And it's great for people who like to eat low carbo.

I went out and bought all the ingrendients and followed the recepe to a T. We all agreed that it was just too sweet. While the meal was eaten we will not make it again.

I agree that this is messy with the lettuce. But the flavor is very nice. The sauce is also great as a variation on that old "in a pinch" appetiser where you put a square of cream cheese on a plate, pour sauce over it and guests spread the combination on crackers. The Saigon Beef sauce is very good this way if you have some left over.

This is one of my favorites! Don't be put off by the list of ingredients -- if you're not sure you'll like it and don't have all the proper condiments, make do with what you have, but it's so good you'll run out to buy the mirin and everything else! (Do cut back on the peppers if you're sensitive.) I don't wrap it in the leaves but just put the beef over rice and sprinkle with the sauce, which also doubles as an excellent spring or summer roll dipping sauce. I suppose I'm mixing my cultural cuisines but who cares as long as it tastes good?

I've made this at least 5 times in the past year and a half. I've improvised with great results. This is a very tasty meal that is light but very satisfying. Will continue to make.

This has become a favorite with my husband and myself (too hot for the kids). My husband is vietnamese and the ingredients and presentation--along with the name (LOL) are very common in dishes oriented in Viet Nam. I serve this with rice, rice paper and the traditional vegie platter it's delicious. My husband requests this along with bom ba hui and pho. Although I agree with other reviewers...if you don't like HOT you should reduce the habanero.

This was a good recipe. There are substitutes that may be used for those who have difficulty getting some of the ingredients. I.E Rice Vinegar-white distilled Vinegar, Sriracha-Chiu Chow chile oil (or other Chinese/Japanese chile oil), Mirin-White cooking wine. Like the others said, I would go easier on the Habanero or substitute Red Pepper flakes to taste.

If you like this, also try the silver-wrapped chicken.

This was very good. Will cook some glass noddles as well next time, for filling the rolls. we used spring roll wrappers (but in addition to lettuce), to hold all the stuff in; this way it was neater.

Yum, yum, very good! Used butter lettuce instead of boston. Will use less habanero next time too. Just a little too hot. Keeper!

I've made this recipe several times. I have to, at the very least, double the recipe. Everyone I've cooked this for has loved it. I made it with chicken as well and it was terrific. I did, however, use less Habanero to accommodate all tastes.

This was fabulous! So unusual. I made it for my husband & I, but I would love to serve it at a party. Worth the prep-time.

Instead of lettuce, I used spring roll wrappers (having diced the beef small enough for that). It was neater, and just as tasty.

Great flavors. A bit messy to eat. We have made it several times already and each time, I add more heat than before.

I agree, the key to this recipe is the chili garlic sauce. However,when I put mine aside to cool to room temperature, it hardened like candy and I had to soften it with a bit of boiling water which threw off the timing of the presentation. Fortunately, my husband is ever-enthusiastic and didn't really notice. Needless to say, I tossed the recipe.

Too hot to truly enjoy it. I will make it again with modifications, but the presentation is beautiful.

Very entertaining participatory food - fun to serve and eat. Not too spicy, although it was possible to ratchet it up if so desired. Used tenderloin, so the cooking time was reduced.

Awesome!. Repalced the habanero with 2 seranos. Just the right amount of heat.

I made these for a small dinner party and we all thought they were great. The sauce (which is just great) along with all the condiments make the dish. (I also added julienned hot house cucumbers to the condiments.) I cut my beef a little smaller than 1/2" cubes and I omitted the habanero from the meat mixture at the request of one of my guests. I'm glad I did --- it would have been nuclear with more heat. One guest mentioned that these wraps were reminiscent of PF Chang's famous lettuce wraps. Well...that's a bit of a stretch but these still were very good. I'll make them again.

This was one of the best Asian recipes I have made, and I make a lot. The flavors change on the palate, tangy, sweet, hot, and altogether memorable. With its long list of ingredients in three parts, the recipe looks far more daunting than it is, although I think next time I will omit some of the condiments or prepare them ahead of time, as shredding carrots, cleaning scallions, washing and trimming lettuce and the same for mint took more time than I wanted to spend. For the meat, I used sirloin, which didn't want to brown, as is so often the case these days, probably because it is lean to a fault. Once it released the excess water, I removed the meat from the pan and drained it in a colander before returning it to the pan to brown properly. In the end, the meat wasn't exactly tender, but it wasn't tough either, and it really had a pleasing bite to it.

This was very tasty and easy. Just the right amount of spiciness. I used flank steak, which I wouldn't do again. It was too tough. I think sirloin would be a lot better. I served it over white rice.
