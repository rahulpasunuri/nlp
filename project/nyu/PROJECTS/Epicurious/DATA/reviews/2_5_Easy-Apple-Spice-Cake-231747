I was really disappointed with this recipe. Out of all recipes for apple cake, crumble or squares, I would rate this one of the worst. The combination of the crumb mixture and the dense cake mixture was not a match. The only thing that made this cake better was the vanilla ice cream. If you are torn between recipes to make that are similar to this one, I encourage you not to pick this one.

i needed a fast recipe for a last minute dessert and i had all these ingredients. that's what it was good for...it didn't have enough batter to cover the crust, it was just strange. It's like the 13x9 was too big for the recipe. i wouldn't bother with it if you're looking for a good recipe.

Quick and delicious! I used 2 mcintosh apples (will try 3 next time), low fat cinnamon graham cracker and sprinkled the top with demerara sugar. Should be great for breakfast!

Good idea -- anything with graham crackers is tops with me. But too much sugar. I'll try half the amount of brown sugar and maybe no sugar on top.

I do not recommend this cake at all; there are far better recipes for apple cake available on this website. It's easy to make and I took the last reviewer's suggestion and used 3 apples but I don't see how that helped the taste.

This was a good, quick dessert. I think next time I would use 3 apples, instead of the two. I didn't use a glass baking dish. and I had a slightly different size pan. It took an extra 5 minutes. Good with vanilla ice cream.
