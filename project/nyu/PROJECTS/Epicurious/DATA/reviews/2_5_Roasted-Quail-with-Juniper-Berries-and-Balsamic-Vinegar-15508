My husband made this and we both thought it to be delicious. The quail seems to be a cross between duck and chicken. My husband forgot to include the vinegar but it was delicious none the less. We served it with roasted potatoes and carrots. There isn't much meat on the quail, but we all don't need that much protein so it really is just enough.

Sauce? What sauce? There weren't any juices left and the balsamic flavour overpowered the birds. Nevertheless,we found this recipe extremely bland. There are many other much nicer recipes for quail out there.

We made this recipe for our New Year's Eve dinner for two. It was very easy and quick, not too much to it. We did make two changes to the recipe. We didn't see the need to clean the pan and add butter before putting the quail in the oven. Instead we added the butter at the end while making the sauce. Also, we added a bit of chicken stock and a little demi-glace to the sauce for more volume. When I make it again, I'll use a spice grinder for the juniper berries, rather than chopping with a knife.
