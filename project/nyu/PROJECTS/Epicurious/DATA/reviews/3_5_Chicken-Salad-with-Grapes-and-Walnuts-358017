Its a great recipe! For garnishing: Serve it on Belgian Endives... Perfect party portions. Accompanied with white wine Italian Pinot Grigio. My guests loved it!

Easy, quick, and tasty! My new go-to chicken salad recipe.

Delish. Used strained yogurt and added about 10 blackberries which gave it a really great color.

Just made it for the first time; I roasted a whole chicken on the Weber with hickory chips and used the leftovers for the salad....greek yogurt and cashews instead of regular yogurt and walnuts..tastes great.

good and quick! i had no more yogurt in the house so just used a little mayo and used leftover roasted chicken. Very good stuff. Maybe next time I will throw in a few olives as well.

Great recipe to make ahead for packed lunches. I substitute out the plain yogurt and mayonnaise for an equal portion of greek yogurt, and add heaped cups of grapes and walnuts. Also, have baked a full chicken and used 'bits' rather then the tenders. Makes it even more moist.

I ditched the mustard and finely chopped some red onion and added it to my home-made mayonnaise to make it more healthy. Delicious and my parents loved it too. I also skipped the capers.

Great little recipe. I don't think I've seen a recipe attributed to Gourmet Magazine call for the use of chicken tenders before. I used a rotisserie chicken and thick Greek style yogurt + added a little salt. Also toasted the walnuts.

This was easy, quick, and very tasty. Good thing to make for a relatively healthy lunch during the work week.

Overall it was a good salad. The flavors blended well together, but no one was jumping on the leftovers.

I wasn't too impressed with the results. It could be me. I thought the sauce was too tangy. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I would make this again.

Wonderful salad. Made this twice in the past two weeks. The second time, I strained the yoghurt in cheesecloth in a sieve for a few hours to remove some of the moisture as the salad was a little on the runny side the first time through.

Really good summer meal, easy, and very fast to make (and great for leftover lunches). Only change I made was to add some finely diced red onions to make it more savory, and omitted the capers.

Delicious and simple. I poached my chicken to keep it more moist and juicy. Definitely making it again.

Tasty, easy and pretty healthy. I used almost all yogurt with only a splash of mayo to reduce the fat. I like my chicken salad sweet, so I added granny smith apples and craisins and a touch of honey. I will definitely make this again.

Super easy. I also added some scallions for color. Even better the next day.

Simple, excellent. Used a pre-made roasted chicken, nearly effortless.
