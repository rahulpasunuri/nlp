This brownie recipe is incredible. Whenever I serve it to people I'm always asked for the recipe. This is my go-to dessert. It's so much better than boxed brownies and only requires a couple more steps!

AMAZING! These brownies are fantastic!! I used a 250g (just over the 8oz) hazelnut-milk chocolate bar, and boy oh boy were these yum! Also added some chocolate buttons which nessled themselves at the bottom and made a deliciously gooey chocolate layer!

The brownies themselves were fine but the 9" square pan was WAY too small. Next time I will use a larger pan.

Delicious! Mine turned out interesting, cooked it for a little longer and the texture was like that of a dense sponge, yet was light and chocolaty. A keeper for sure

I used brown sugar and real vanilla instead of the syrup. I also added some honey and used orange-peel-flavored bitter-sweet chocolate. They were delicious and fudgy, just the way I like them.

other reviews are right...when these come out of the oven they appear to still be raw. However, if you follow the recipe and wait until cooled COMPLETE they turn out moist and fudgy. I added about 2 TBS finely ground coffee powder to the chocolate/butter mix. Delicious!

In trying to make a chocolate cheesecake, I managed to seize up the chocolate, which I saved, hoping I could use it for something else. I wound up adding butter and maybe cream to unseize the chocolate and used it with this brownie recipe as a guide to salvage the mess I made. The brownies turned out unbelievably good - a dense, fudgy center and crispy surface. The best I've ever had, by far. So I had high hopes trying this recipe properly, just as it's written. No seizing of the chocolate, and they were quick to make. I used a 13x9 pan, and they baked in about 50 minutes. But they didn't taste the same as my salvage batch! These were moist, almost soggy in the center, but somehow more spongy than dense and fudgy. Maybe they were just overcooked, but at 45 minutes the center was still wiggly. Maybe the perfect batch of brownies only comes once in a lifetime&

Apparently, fudgy brownies are really raw brownies, because I baked these for the required 35 min. for fudgy brownies, expecting a dense, rich, but baked interior, and was met with raw batter once I cut into them! In fact, I had to bake these brownies for a whole extra hour in order to get the consistency that I wanted, and I don't like "cakey" brownies at all. What a weird recipe! Once I baked them appropriately, they were delicious, though . . . Just realise that when you insert the toothpick, and it comes out full of batter, as the recipe states it will, that it just may be exactly that, batter . . . .

Awesome brownies. I, like another reviewer, substracted 2 T sugar and added 2 T Dutch cocoa powder to flour. I also added a large pinch of espresso powder to chocolate/butter in double boiler.

We agree with many of the positive reviews! They were great! We only had an over-sized metal pan, but they turned out wonderfully all the same: crispy on top and fudgy in the middle, plenty chocolatey, but not like you're just eating a bar of chocolate . . . and so quick and easy! Plus they got rave reviews from a Russkie, in a land where they don't really know how to make brownies...

I love these brownies. This recipe is definitely one of my favorites. Its very simple and the brownies are fudgy and delicious! I have served these a lot and they have always been a favorite!

These are my favorite brownies - I double the recipe (if you're making brownies, might as well make a lot!) and it fits perfectly in a half-sheet cake pan. I bake them at 350 in a convection oven for 50 minutes and they're perfect. With the parchment paper, you can then flip the whole thing over on a cutting board, peel off the paper, and cut them with no problem.

I love these brownies!!! I made them last year for Valentine's day and they were a huge hit. This recipe is also really easy to make. I dont even bother getting my stand mixer out just three bowls a whisk and a spatula. I also just break up the chocolate and butter and place in a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds then mix and repeat two more times. Much easier than using a double boiler.

These brownies were amazing, a nice mixture between fudgy and cakey- however, using my older oven they took over an hour to bake! (70 mins.) My husband who is a chocolate fiend, found them too sweet- I used two bars of Coco camino bittersweet chocolate. My entire body vibrated after eating the initial 2x2" square. I will take them into work and see what happens! Definitely more money and time to make, than the "best cocoa brownies". I would reduce the sugar almost by an entire cup and see what happens.

These taste good, but a 9x9 pan MUST be a printing error! I ended up cooking them for an hour and 15 minutes and the center was still liquidy. I imagine that if I cooked them in a 9x13 pan they would work much better. I will try again since they still taste quite good, but I can't give the recipe more than 2 forks since I really think there is an error in it!

I was looking for a go-to brownie recipe and this it. I'm a professional caterer and have served these several times-- people love them! For a slightly less sweet brownie, I sometimes leave out 2T sugar and add 2T good quality cocoa powder. I think this improves the texture as well. But I've also made them as written and they're great like that too--just a bit sweeter and gooey-er.

Rating: 4
I have been searching for the perfect brownie recipe for some time and everyone in my family agreed that this is the closest we've come so far. I baked these in a 9 x 13" pan for the recommended time and they were fudgey but not too much - just the way we like them. Using the bittersweet chocolate gave them a slightly sweeter taste than using cocoa or unsweetened chocolate.

Rating: 4
A great standby brownie recipe. I, sadly, didn't have bittersweet chocolate on hand, but semi-sweet worked well in a pinch. I added maybe a tablespoon of instant espresso for more depth and, like other reviewers, needed to bake for 50 minutes even for fudgy brownies. I will definitely bake these again.

I chose this brownie recipe because it seemed so quick and simple. It was! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate,so I used Scharffen Berger 62% semi-sweet chocolate. I left out the nuts. I baked the brownies for about 28 minutes. Even with my terrible oven, these still turned out great! They were even better the second day...

Baked these with my 10 year old son and they were a breeze to prepare. Should have read the reviews and switched to a 9x13 pan, they came out great but very thick. Subbed a half cup of mini choc chips for the nuts. Watch cooking time, in convection oven they were done in only 35 mins. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe! For a more sophisticated, torte-like taste, I would cut the sugar in half. But still it was delicious. I kept it in the oven for about 40 minutes and it was still really gooey. Yum. Here is my special brownie secret: I unwrap a bunch of peppermint patties and put them all over the top of the brownies for the last 10 minutes that the brownies are cooking. Make sure the peppermint patties are all touching one another. Then I spread the melted goodness around for a great mint icing.

These brownies were rich, fudgy, and delicious. I am at high altitude, but rather than add extra flour, I added ~2t cocoa powder. I also substituted Kahlua for 1/4 c of sugar. I found the consistency perfectly fudgy after 45 minutes. I lined a 9x13 pan with parchment paper rather than waxed. The middle was much gooier than the outer edges--next time, I will probably use 2 smaller pans to get the same consistency throughout.

I've never made brownies (although I do cook/bake a lot). I used powdered unsweetened cocoa in this recipe and found these to be GREAT brownies! Somewhere along the line, I inherited 2 cans of cocoa (from departing seasonals) and wanted to use it up. So, here's what I did with the cocoa in lieu of the bittersweet chocolate: to substitute cocoa powder for bittersweet chocolate, use 25% less chocolate, and 1.5 tsp more sugar per ounce of chocolate used. This translates to about 1 3/4 cup cocoa, 6 Tbsp vegetable oil, and 3 Tbsp. sugar. I used the remaining listed ingredients as called for. Because I am at high altitude (8,200 ft), I increased the oven temp 25 degrees to 375F, and baked 35-40 minutes for fudgy brownies. I think I will make them again...yum......

I've actually had trouble finding a brownie recipe that I LOVE to keep in my arsenal but after this recipe, I think I've found it. These brownies are exceptionally moist and very versatile. I've doubled the recipe before and baked in two 9-in round pans, filled with banana-flavored ganache and iced with peanut butter cream cheese frosting. Absolutely delicious!

I made two different brownies this one, and another recipe from a children's cook book. This recipe smelled so unique right after we pulled it out of the oven, I felt like I wanted to gobble it all down in one big bite! The cooking took a while, so if you want fudgy brownie's put them in for longer. We kept sticking tooth picks in again and again and we gave it 10 minutes extra. Now the taste ooohh the taste. It was rich, moist, and buttery. So ,overall I would recomend making this recipe for any event.

I halved the recipe and cut the sugar by 25% as others suggested, then tossed in a handful of dried cherries and baked the batter in a 7x11" pan for 20 min. Worked great. I'm in a temporary (read: not well stocked) kitchen and appreciate that this recipe calls for only one kind of chocolate (I used Lindt 70%) rather than a combo of unsweetened, bittersweet, cocoa, and so forth. I'm keeping this simple recipe for making on vacation or at low-stocked friends' houses, or whenever.

Made these for a Mexican dinner party, so substituted Ibarra Mexican chocolate for half of the regular chocolate, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and left out the nuts. Baked them for about 50 minutes in a 9x9" pan, and they were *delicious*.

Fantastic brownies! I used Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chocolate chips, and they were wonderful. Make sure to use a 9X13 pan and not a 9X9. Also, my brownies were done in less than 30 minutes, so set a timer earlier.

These were delicious and everyone loved them. I didn't have bittersweet so substituted chocolate chips and they were still great. I don't understand why the use of wax paper however. I used it as directed and the brownies stuck to it. I'll just grease a pan next time as usual.

The best brownies I've ever made. I made this for a dinner party, divided the batter into 6 oven safe chili bowls and baked them right in the bowls the night before. I then re-heated them slightly and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and carmel sauce. Unbelieveably rich, moist and delicious.

I took the advice of previous reviewers to cut down on the butter by 1/4 and substitute a bit of cocoa for some flour. Maybe individually it's good advice, but together - bad idea! After 30 minutes my brownies were already done and on the cakey side. Unfortunately, I like the fudgy kind. In retrospect, I probably should have *added* butter to compensate for the dry cocoa. I'm giving the recipe 3 forks anyway because the flavor was good and because the problems were probably of my own making. And in any case, with a glass of milk, I didn't notice the dryness.

These brownies were awesome! Almost more like fudge, and definitely for chocolate lovers. I added 1 cup of dried cherries, and 3/4 cup candied pecan pieces to it, and it was great. Cut small pieces, as it is very intense.

I just have to say that this is the BEST brownie recipe I have ever used..even better than the one that came with my well-known company's brownie pan.

I should have read all the reviews before making: while these are super delish and I will def make again, they definitely require a larger pan - they were bursting out of the 9x9 pyrex I used. Secondly, cut the butter by 1/4.

These were delicious and easy to make. Only issue I had was I baked them the shorter time so I could have fudgy brownies and they were too soft - had to put them back in longer. But they still tasted delicious. Apparently (according to my Sister-In-Law) this is the same recipe that is on the back of the Bakers Square Label. Who Knew....

I have made this one 2 times. First time was following the recipe exactly and it was very good. I made it just until center was slightly done as it keeps baking a bit after you take it out and I didn't want it too cakey. The second time I made it I added chocolate covered orange peel and this was a nice suprise for the people who ate the brownies. I also used excellent quailty chocolate and I think this made a difference as well.

Outstanding chocolate brownie recipe! Perfect chewy texture, rich taste and simple to make. I have experimented with this recipe using the various baking times to create more cake-like brownies (increasing the time) to gooey fudgy brownies using the shortest recommended baking time. Our favourite is right in the 'middle'.

Keeper recipe! Perfect proportion of ingredients except I reduced the sugar down to 1/2 cup only to suit my taste,allowing the taste of Valrhona choc to really shine. Generously topped brownies with half-baked cashew nuts. Yummy! This recipe reminds me of Raspberry Hazelnut Brownies which is also heavenly except much easier.

I followed the suggestions posted by some of you, i.e. reduced sugar to about 1.5cups. I used a 11"x11"x3" baking tin and baked for 25-30mins. I chilled them overnight in the fridge and served cold. The brownies tasted heavenly. My 2yr old daughter polished her plates in just a few seconds. My family and friends craved for more. Definitely will make them again!

This was my first attempt at homemade brownies. These were really good. I baked them for 40 mn. next time I will bake a little less for more fudgy stuff. I couldn't help but throw in 1/4 c. cocoa powder(good quality stuff). Otherwise followed the recipe - used the full 2 cups of sugar - thought I should with cocoa powder...

I definitely agree with those that say that they have found THE brownie recipe. However, using quality chocolate is a MUST (Trader Joes semisweet chocolate chips - melted, don't quiet cut it) and so is cutting out some sugar and adding some cocoa. I also prefer pecans to walnuts. After these tweaks this recipe is heaven.

These are awesome for many days after you make them. I cook them fudgy and they get fudgyer over the days. You can also make them with a little less sugar (1.5cup is good) and 1/4cup less butter and use yogurt instead to add moisture.

These are yummy! If you're looking for a "different" kind of brownie, look elsewhere because this is the quintessential recipe. But basics are great and that's why they hold up over the years. You could add espresso powder or a different kind of nut to make these 'au courant'. I used a 60-40 mix of bitter- and semi-sweet chocolate (as I didn't have 8 oz of bitter), added 1/4 black chocolate powder from the Baker's Catalogue, cut the sugar down to 1 2/3 cups sugar, and baked them in a 9 x 13 pan as other reviewers suggested. Came out perfectly and very tasty. Great, easy recipe.

Rating: 1
My first batch I overbaked (I didn't hear the timer) so I know why those were awfully cakey and dry. I hoped that bakning them the right amound of time would remedy the rather lackluster flavor of the overdone batch, but 'twas not to be. My second batch was also rather dry and crumbly and still just as flavorless as batch one. Betty Crocker brownie mix is better than this recipe. Too bad "0 formks" isn't an option.

Rating: 2
These were just okay. I followed the advice of some reviewers and used 1/4 cup of cocoa in place of some of the flour, but even that didn't give these enough of a chocolate flavor. I didn't use the best chocolate available, but I did use Ghiardelli which has worked nicely for me in the past. I baked them in a 9x13 pan as others suggested and though they were thick enough, they were still too fudgey and falling apart, even after baking at least 30 minutes. I like a fudgey, chewy brownie, but I don't like a brownie that you can't even cut out of the pan without it falling apart. Baking them longer may have improved the consistency, but it wouldn't have saved it from an unexciting flavor. If you want a really fudgey brownie with tons of chocolate flavor, try the Farm of Beverly Hills "Chocolate Brownies" from Gourmet, February 2000. These were a little too moist and rich (I like chewy, not just fudgey) for me, but they had an excellent chocolate flavor.

Rating: 3
I found this recipe to be very satisfying in both texture and flavor. The only modification that was made was substituting 1/4c. of cocoa powder for 1/4c. of flour, and I add a cream cheese swirl or something like that from another brownie recipe. My wife and friends ate it until their bellies ached.

These were decadent and delicous and easy to make. I omitted the walnuts because I like my brownies plain, and I used a 9x13 pan like other reviewers suggested. I was hesitant about changing the pan size but am glad I did, they came out plenty thick enough. I think if you use the 9x9 pan, you probably end up having to cut the brownies into those tiny piece that are narrow but tall. I will make these again for sure!

Finally, my perfect brownie! I hate it when they're too thin, and this is just perfect and thick and cakey yet moist and fudgy inside. I baked for almost 45 minutes for my perfect texture. The only thing-- it could use a little bit more chocolately goodness. Next time I will add 1 or 2 ounces of bittersweet chocolate, or maybe a 1/4 - 1/3 cocoa powder in the dry mixture.

I think I messed up and cooked the brownies too long (30 minutes in a 9 x 13 pan) because they came out much cakier than I thought they would. Next time I have to keep a really close eye on them, because the first time I checked, after 30 minutes, the toothpick came out clean. The flavor is great, though. I used Lindt 70 percent chocolate. I cut the dryness by serving them with vanilla ice cream.

Making these brownies was a last-minute move last night - so easy to make and sooo delicious. Although I will make these again I think the 13 x 9 pan is definitely the way to go, per suggestion of another reviewer. Make appropriate changes in cooking time and do cut down a bit on the sugar.

Great recipe! I've been looking for a good, easy, brownie recipe for a while... especially one using sweetened chocolate - I used 230 grams of 74% dark chocolate - I made the brownies 3 times in the past few weeks and they all came out great... took other reviewers' advice and used less sugar... about 1-2/3 cups - definitely sweet enough! My French family members don't like the brownies too chewy, so I baked them for 50 minutes... perfect!

I've baked a lot of brownies through the years, and I had the same problem with these that I've had with some others: When done, they had a crusty top layer that actually separated from the brownies themselves. On this recipe, when I turned them out, that top crusty layer actually shattered. I had baked about 45 minutes, aiming for something between cakey and fudgy. Also, I discovered later I had accidentally used unbleached all-purpose flour, although I've had the problem with bleached flour as well. Any of you chemist/bakers out there know what causes this problem?

I have finally found the perfect recipe for brownies. I used Lindt 70% chocolate and they turned out great. I baked them in a 9 x 9 pan for 35 minutes as indicated but found them to be a bit too runny. Will try increasing baking time by 10 minutes or using a 9 x 13 pan, as other reviewers have suggested. No matter what, this one is a keeper!

My first attempt seemed to go very well - until I fell asleep for 2 hours. In an effort to prove that a pan of brownies wouldn't bring me down, I tried again. I only had unsweetened and a little bit of semi-sweet left after the first fiasco, so I increased the sugar. They came out ok, but I wasn't terribly impressed until about 12 hours later - the taste improves tenfold, as the recipe mentions. The instructions are easy, and the hardest part was greasing the parchment.

This recipe is really good. I changed the walnuts to cashew nuts as I like cashew better. As I have a hectic student live, I keep forgetting what I have in my kitchen. I thought I had dark chocolate (the recipe uses bittersweet chocolate, i normally use dark choc for this). It turned out that I only had milk chocolate. I pushed myself to use the milk chocolate and it still turned out marvelous. Everyone who has tried it seems to enjoy it so much. I would make it again. You may want to reduce the sugar by a little bit if you're using milk chocolate. Good recipe indeed!

We had these tonight for dessert. I found the recipe in this month's Food & Wine Magazine. They are easy to make and sinfully chocolatey. I would use a 13X9" pan to make the fudgey brownies again.

This recipe is just perfect... I'll never try another one.

To answer the question as to why this was rated 4 forks by both reviewers but only 50% would make it again: The ratings (1-4 forks) and whether or not you would make the recipe again are not dependent on one another. Someone can rate a recipe as being great- 4 forks, yet are not likely to make it a second time for whatever reason (too time consuming, difficult to locate ingredients, etc.) one of the reviewers must have answered "no" to making the dish again.

When I read this, only 2 people had reviewed it. Both gave 4 fork reviews, yet the top said 50% would make it again. I almost didn't read the recipe or the reviews based on that error.Whasup?

Fudgy brownies are simply the best. There isn't a better recipe. Try them with premiere quality chocolate chunks added for a real chocolate indulgence.
