My guests all loved this recipe. I will double it next time I make it. Can you assemble this the night before and cook it in the morning?

This was a huge hit at christmas morning breakfast. Very easy to make. I could only get a knotted challah bread and would recommend looking for a loaf with square slices, the center of my loaf sort of fell apart due to piecing bits together. Thought the top looked kind of boring so I quickly microwaved some raisins in some additional glaze and it was a total hint.

My family loves this recipe! It's not as sweet as other bread pudding recipes. Followed exact recipe and it came out perfect for our taste. Great for holiday brunch

I made this as individual bread puddings using cinnamon swirl-type bread (reduce sugar a bit if you use a sweetened bread) and only did 2 layers ending with the pecan mixture (to which I added some softened butter) on top. I dried out the bread in a 250 degree oven - this helped prevent a soggy middle. I served for dessert with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream which really added a nice additional flavor. Very good - everyone loved it!

I was extremely bummed by this dish. The center of the pudding was totally soggy and squishy (due to using a loaf pan I believe) and the flavor was just so-so. If I was to ever make again, I'd use cinnamon swirl bread and bake it at a higher temp. in a lower-sided pan. And I would definitely add salt.
