Most of the sauce fell off on the bbq, so by the time it was on our plates, it wasn't very flavorful. If I make this again, I would reserve some of the sauce and brush it on at the last minute before serving. It was nothing spectacular, just a plain steak.

I doubled the sauce and the found the recipe to have a nice but not great or unusal flavor. We're always looking for something a little different. It was an easy preparation.

Last week I gave this recipe the ultimate test by serving it to my in-laws . . . it was a home run. I used Top Sirloin instead of T-Bone, and the result was amazing.

WOW!! This was wonderful. Instead of each seperate pepper type, I had a five peppercorn mix and I used 1 1/2 tsp. of that ground up. I do not particularly care for steak sauce but this combination was great. Very easy too.
