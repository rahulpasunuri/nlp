This is absolutely delicious - it has a depth of flavour that makes it truly yummy without a strong flavour of either cinnamon or vanilla bean. I didn't need the extra 1/3rd cup of sugar and I used light brown soft sugar for the cup I used. I used a large non-stick saucepan so there was no danger of it sticking and after everything had combined on the Simmering Plate of the Aga I gave it 90 minutes in the Simmering Oven with a lid on. Perfect! I have made this with damsons as well as plums and they are both equally delicious.

This recipe was so simple and really highlighted the flavors of the fruit. I had a basket of overripe plums and no scale, so I just had to guess the quantities of sugar and cinnamon to add. I added a generous sprinkling sugar and cinnamon to taste and it was just fine. The compote turned out a little tart which was a good complement to sweet ice cream and cake. Just be sure to stir frequently; I didn't and had to be careful not to scrape the burnt bottom when transferring into jars.

I'm a fruit dessert lover but had never cooked w/ plums before and wished I hadn't waited so long; this delicious. Only complaint is the cooking time. I didn't have time to stand & stir for 45 mns.so I covered and let stew while I prepared other dishes. It turned out great. The tanginess of the plums is complimented well w/ vanilla bean ice cream.

This recipe was delicious. I had a bunch of plums that were going to go bad and I was looking for a healthy way to use them! Since my pockets are pretty shallow right now I used vanilla extract instead of the vanilla bean and it still turned out great! I put it in oatmeal, and over light vanilla ice cream! yum!

Not only was this easy and pretty healthy, switching to brown sugar and slightly reducing the sugar amount did no harm, and the product was loved by all, including people from 3 continents on the night I tried it out. I wish vanilla beans were cheaper; I would make it frequently.
