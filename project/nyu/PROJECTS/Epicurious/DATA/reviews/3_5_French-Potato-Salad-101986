Wow, 46 people reviewed and not one had the problem I did. I followed the reicpe to a T, but my dressing turned out really runny. I loved the ease of the recipe so, if I try again, I think I'll combine the broth, wine, olive oil, & mustard separately, add that to the potatoes, green onions, and capers and then cautiously add additional dressing if needed. I thought it needed salt too.

I absolutely love this recipe. Love the tanginess of the dressing. I make it with Yukon Gold potatoes and chives. I'll be making it again tomorrow to take along on a sailing trip and I think I'll try adding green beans as another reviewer suggested.

This was very good, but not "the one" I'm looking for. I'm going to keep trying others.

Really excellent as is. I've made other olive oil-based potato salads and this one is the best. It can be made way in advance and holds up well. I should've taken people's advice to slice the potatoes before cooking, but it wasn't too bad, but you have to work fast, as the potatoes should go into the dressing while warm in order to soak it up. Not dry or bland at all. You need to adjust the salt and pepper to taste. A little tarragon works beautifully.

I've been making this recipe since it was first published in 1999. My mother still asks me to make it when we have a family gathering in the summer. Like all recipes, adjust the seasoning or ratios to suit your taste buds. I almost always add a little more vinegar, and occasionally add celery or parsley. If you have green beans, they are a great add too.

Delicious and easy. Found I had to add quite a bit of salt, though.

I used whole grain mustard instead of Dijon. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it.

I slice the potatoes and cook them covered with cold water on high for 20 minutes in the microwave. I also add at least 1 TBS dried tarragon to the dressing to enhance the flavor.

Excellent departure from mayo-tato-salad. I used a little dry vermouth (because I had no other wine) and boiled the tatoes in chiken stock to add depth. Yummy

I lost track and over cooked the potatoes which was probably a good thing. The slightly mushy potatoes soaked up all of the great sauce and gave the recipe a delightfully sour taste. My wife said it reminded her of German potato salad. Can't wait to make it again.

I liked this a moderate amount; it wasn't bad at all, but it was sort of bland. I brought it to a barbeque, and people definitely ate it and said nice things, but no one raved about it, and no one went up for seconds.

this is a delicious and refreshing accompaniment on a summer day, especially relative to mayo-based potato salads. i agree that it seems "light" even though it is made with potatoes (which we normally despise-so boring). we had it with barbequed salmon and it was great. even the French woman in the group loved it! i don't like capers, so put in a few olives and chopped jalapenos. also added a splash of fresh lemon juice (not enough zip as written). personally, i like the potato salad with toasted cumin vinaigrette on this site better, but this one's a keeper too. delicious.

This is the potato salad I have been looking for. I can't stand mayonaisse and years ago I had a potato salad with none and since then I have been looking for it. I'm eating right now and I haven't even waited the hour. Yum.

I made this recipe mostly for the dressing part of it, so instead I used whole Baby Dutch Yellow Potatoes (sliced after cooking), blanched Haricot Verts, diced red bell pepper. Wow!

The flavor is great! Refreshing to have a pretty potato salad rather than a gloppy mayo coated one. Next time I will add a just a bit of mayo, though, because it was a little too dry.

Excellent potato salad recipe, especially if you don't care for mayo. This is definitely a keeper. Flavor gets even better after a day or two!

Great, different. Definitely serve at room temp or warmer - a good choice when you don't have room in the fridge or for a BBQ or picnic. I took reviewer's advice and pureed capers with olive oil before adding to dressing. If you slice potatoes before boiling (a brilliant suggestion), be sure slices are evenly sized so all potatoes finish cooking at the same time. Add lots of salt to boiling water. Store in container that allows you to tumble the potatoes to coat with dressing.

Made this for a baby shower this weekend. Huge success. I added 2 tablespoons of mayo and it gave it a little added moistness. Everyone loved it!! Careful not to overcook your potatoes....

I don't know what the other cooks are raving about. I followed the recipe to the letter and found the results to be so bland and uninteresting even I didn't go back for more. I took the salad to a bar-b-q for 30...when all the guests were gone half the salad was left so I wasn't the only one who found it boring.

This is an old favourite!!!! Got it out of the magazine when it was first out, and it is a really big hit!!!! I agree about the pre cutting of the potatoes!!! Cut them up, boil them and then toss with the dressing. I get asked for this recipe all the time!!! WONDERFUL!!!!

Excellent!!!! I followed the advice of Fremont to slice the potatos before boiling. Very easy. Because I'm not a huge caper fan, therefore didn't want whole ones, I threw all of the dressing ingredients into my blender. Next time, I'm going to substitute tarragon and a small amount of chives for the capers and green onion. This is a great recipe in that you can improvise after you've made the basic olive oil/wine/mustard/vinegar base.

Thanks to those previous reviewers for the tips about slicing the potatoes prior to cooking and adding lots of salt to the water. The recipe was delicious. To those cooks that are worried about their guests missing the rich taste of mayo in the potato salad, don't worry -- this recipe is even better than any with mayo, but you can't tell immediately that the mayo is missing, due to the rich taste.

This is a beautiful, subtle departure from traditional potato salad. It's better to slice the potatoes before cooking them and also important to serve the dish at room temperature. This held up well when I made it a day in advance and traveled well for a wine harvest festival and picnic we attended. Everyone loved it!

This potato salad was part of my summer bbq party menu and it was a hit. I'm not a fane of the traditional mayo potato salad so this was a great alternative. A must is to serve it room temperature not cold.

DO NOT COOK THE POTATO MORE THAN ABOUT 15 MINUTES!!! Otherwise, the dish is OK. Flavor is nice, but not wonderful.

Take the advice of Boca Raton - I've made this recipe twice and slicing the potatoes before cooking definitely made the difference. Be liberal with the salt (in the water and the dressing) and the vinegar! Sits at room temperature for several hours very well.

I haven't tried this yet, but wanted to respond to 'A Cook from 5/28/02'. Slide the red potatoes into 1/4 in or 1/3 in slices BEFORE you cook them. It's so much easier, you only have to boil them about 5 mins, and it looks much nicer! Also, add alot of salt to the water.

wonderful. I added shallots ( didn't have any capers)Good warm or cold. I've made it three times already and it's only the end of June.

For some strange reason, everyone liked this. It didn't do anything for me. It also didn't look anything like the photo, as the red potatoes tend to break when you slice them while they're still hot.

This is delicious, simple, and quick to prepare! And, even though it's potato salad, it has a light feel. Be careful not to overcook the potatoes -- 35 minutes is a little too long.

I totally agree with my fellow cooks, what a lovely variation of the "same old" potato salad recipe. We do have leftovers, so today I'm going to take the suggestion of adding a small beet.

Several people in my family do not like mayonnaise, so the quest was on for a recipe that did not use it...this received rave reviews from everyone who tried it!

This is tasty--although I didn't think it was particularly special. Also, mine didn't present nearly as nice as in the picture (potatoes a little soft, dressing a little milky). The big selling point, to my way of thinking, is how fast and easy it is.

I love this potato salad. I just think it's a very "frenchy," "adult," "sophisticated," not to mention delicious alternative to mayo-based potato salads. You have to be careful, however, to not let it cool to much. The warm temperature even further differentiates it from it's often too cold mayo-based cousin. Good all year round. Chopped scallions are a nice addition as well.

Great receipe! I used red skinned, white skinned and purple skinned potatoes to give the salad color. The flavors were very good and the different colors really drew attention to my guests.

Very nice potato salad. I agree with the cook who commented that 35 min is too long to cook the potatoes. I would start checking them after 20 minutes to prevent them from being mushy.

This salad pleased a diverse crowd, aged 4 to 68! I did put in an extra TBSP of vinegar. Ted Tyler recommended an old Vermont tradition of adding a couple of small beets, which, much to everyone's surprise, was delightful! this one's a winner!

A big hit with everyone! It would've been 4 forks if I hadn't overcooked the potatoes (35 minutes was too long) making it mushier but no less delicious. The leftovers were great, too!
