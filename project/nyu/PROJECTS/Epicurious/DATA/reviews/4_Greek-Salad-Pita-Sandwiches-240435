Where does the 13 grams of protein come from per 1/4 of recipe? Feta has around 4 grams of protein per ounce so that would be 8 g protein? I would like to know because I am trying to get the school to make this.

i made this as a salad side (sans pita) to lamb burgers and it stole the show! great the next too after the flavors have married.

What a fabulous idea, LOVE this for summer! Just made this last night and it was really good, this is such a perfect crowd-pleaser. I will say, though, where is the oregano in this recipe? Seems a bit strange. I've made Ina Garten's Greek salad quite a few times in the past, and to be honest, this one is no where near as good as hers. Next time I'm going to go with Ina's recipe to fill pitas with. http://www.barefootcontessa.com/recipes.aspx?RecipeID=290&S=0

So simple and delicious. A wonderful meal on a summer night when everything's in season and you don't want to turn on the stove.

I added about one cup of diced Volpi Genoa salami to the mix and eased up on the salt in the dressing. Wonderful.

Good pita filling, becomes very potent in flavors if left sitting for too long. Two days max...great alternative for lunch during the week.

Really yummy! I used red pepper instead of green pepper and omitted the radishes. I ate the sandwich with garlic hummus as well. I will be making this again!

Great recipe--sprinkled some diced spanish olives on top of the filling. Coupled it with the Whole Wheat Pita Bread recipe from this same website which was amazingly easy and fun to make with my 9 year old. (We added the 4 teaspoons of wheat gluten as recommended by a previous reviewer to the pita bread recipe which made great pockets for this salad.)

Super simple, healthy and delicious. I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green, didn't have radishes so I left them out... I thought it could use more vinegar, however, and so I ended up using equal parts olive oil and vinegar.

This recipe is so simple yet really really yummy! And everyone at work commented on how good it smelled, so the second day I had to bring extra. Used champagne vinegar, otherwise followed recipe exactly.

Made the following modifications; used a red pepper instead of a green pepper, didn't peel the cucumber, added 1 cup of canned, rinsed chickpeas and an extra splash of red wine vinegar for extra bite. I thought this was going to be bland but it packs quite the punch! Tastes even better when all the favors have melded in the fridge overnight.

Trader Joe's didn't have any radishes (sad face), but it was still super yum. I'm thinking about tossing in some raw asparagus slices. I used Champagne Vinegar because that's what I had on hand. Really good salad in a pita or not. Would be great with hummus and a cold Hefeweizen + lemon wedge...

Oh so easy and so delicious. It's a great use for grilled chicken too. Super easy to make and prep work is not that complicated. Will definitely make again.

My fave lunch recipe. I like it best with cilantro and extra radishes. I don't usually put it in pockets, but i bet this would be great on toasted naan.

I made this recipe for a very hungry - and very picky - film crew of 12. It was very easy to make, and everyone loved it. Unfortunately my grocer didn't have any radishes, but I'd imagine it didn't change the tone of the dish very much. It was so good I made a double-batch and served it as part of lunch the second day. The only problem I had was keeping the pitas from cracking open at the bottom once they were filled.

absolutely delicious! we chose to use a Marzetti balsamic vinaigrette that was absolutely incredible with the rest of the dish.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe! Great for the lunch box and it keeps for a week. I used red peppers from a jar because of time, but will try it again with roasted peppers from the grill. I don't like radishes so omitted them and it was fine without them. My co-workers were jealous - they wanted me to make their lunch!

Total keeper! Full of flavor and super easy. My husband and I chowed it down. I used what I had onhand. Changes were: red pepper instead of green, cilantro instead of parsley, didn't have a radish, and didn't use a pita. Will try with avacodo next time!

forgot to add...I used half basil and half parlsey...bit I'm a basil lover.

Excellent. Wonderful light lunch. A bit of chopping, but easy enough. I'd recommend holding out the tomato until the last minute if you make it ahead of time.

Okay, I used regular tomatoes and red peppers from a jar, and then used homeade flour tortillas instead of the pita bread. BUT, this one's a keeper! It was simple and delicious. Very refreshing for the summer.

So GooD! Even my anti-veggie husband liked it! I used blue cheese instead of feta - only cause that is what I had on hand... still great!

Rating: 4
This recipe adds up to more than the sum of its parts. It was so easy, and really delicious. It's going to become a lunch-time staple for me. Changes: used red and yellow bell peppers, cilantro instead of parsley, a Vidalia instead of a red onion, and fat-free feta.

We love this quick and healthy meal. I always add avocado and substitute cilantro for parsley.

This is a wonderfully easy little recipe. I served it for lunch at my annual Cookie Baking Party and I had no leftovers. I made some quick homemade flatbreads to accompany this, so they were not stuffed as recommended. I think the recipe needs more olive oil (I have a weakness for good olive oil).

A tasty and traditional ingredient combination. I left out the vinegar, onion, and radishes, and had good lunches for a week.

These delightful sandwiches taste so fresh and healthy, it's hard to believe they are so delicious.

Quite tasty and I will certainly make again and again but I can't say it's particularly special. If I got this at a Mediterranean cafe it would not stand out. But great for a quick lunch box standard and being able to keep the salad mix in the fridge for a couple days is handy.

If I could give this recipe more forks, I would! It is the best. I add diced rotisserie chicken. Even my husband (who doesn't prefer veggies) loves it. It keeps a long time.

Rating: 3
This is a really easy and fresh recipe. It would be really difficult to mess this one up. I eyeballed all the ingredients and used Vidalia onion as opposed to red. I'm sure I will be making this again. Its also a good use for the leftover veggies from other dishes.

I love this recipe. Being a vegetarian, lunch is the hardest meal to plan for. I love the simplicity of the ingredients. I've taken this with me to a day by the river and for camping as a easy meal that required no effort to prepare. My normal ingredients include; red and orange peppers, cucumber, olives, green onions, white onions, feta cheese, and whatever I can think to put in there (my ingredients were usually sweeter than the original recipe). An additional tip for a quick recipe, just use Italian Salad Dressing, or just a dressing in general but from the Mediterranean. It is also really healthy and has become a staple in my diet.

Yum! I thought this was a wonderful cool, light summertime meal. I think chicken would detract from the other flavors of the meal. A little bit of hummus lining the inside could be nice, though.

Fantastic recipe, one that can easily be adapted. Very important in my household because I have a 20 year old daughter who eats only vegitarian, but I also have a 17 year old son who loves grilled chicken. I just love the bright colors.

I love this recipe. Perfect for a quick dinner or lunch. I left out the onions and green peppers and added sliced green olives. Yum! I also used a whole wheat pita. It was fantastic.

This is great! If you want to make it even better add beets, black olives and grilled chicken! Delicious but must use it in a larger pita or a wrap.

The perfect dish for a party when Vegetarians are attending. I actually a small hamburger in it for myself and it was wonderful.
