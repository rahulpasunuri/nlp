Awesome. This recipe is time consuming, but after you beat it, you can leave it on the counter over night until you have time to roll the next day. I left the balls in the fridge for a few days and dipped them last night. Oh my gosh, these are the tastiest Christmas candies I think I've ever had. They are now my favorite Christmas treat, even if they are extremely time consuming. They are worth the effort. The main thing when making candy/fudge is to follow the directions considering temperatures. The times may differ, but if you want the right consistency, you MUST follow the temperature guidelines. If you do that, these are going to knock your socks off. DELISH!

This candy is very sweet and has a nice flavor. In general, I found that all of the cooking/beating times were much shorter than written. For instance, it took less than a minute for the hot candy to reach 234 after I added the cream mixture. Also, the first time I made it, I overbeat the fudge and it came out grainy and dry, so beware. The next time I made it, I just beat the fudge by hand and stopped beating a little before I thought it was done. Then, it only took about 30 minutes (not 2 hours) for it to harden enough to scoop into balls. It took a little finessing, but a nice product in the end and fairly easy to make once you get the hang of it.

Having tried penuche fudge and failed . . I was a bit nervous about this recipe. It came out EXACTLY per the instructions! Fabulous and delicious . .a real treat and they look beautiful too.

I've made this recipe twice, to rave reviews both times. As I like very sweet candy, I dip the brown sugar fudge balls in milk chocolate, rather than semi or bittersweet chocolate. These are rich and delicious -- a real indulgence. Be careful not to over beat the fudge as it will indeed become dry. Enjoy!

I made this recipe for Christmas,2000. They were time consuming, but well worth it for those who enjoy making Christmas candy and are tired of the old favorites. They have a wonderful melt in your mouth brown sugar flavor and were enthusiastically received by all who tried them.
