I have made this recipie exactly as written many, many times and it is always perfect. The creme fraiche is a must as it counter balances the sweetness of the apples; longer cooking time helps caramalize them.

Omit the cinnamon - so much better without it. Also, substitute the regular sugar with 3/4 cup light brown sugar.

I found this too sweet. I'll cut down the sugar the next time I make it.

Everyone seemed to like this desert, though I found just a little bit too sweet (maybe because I served it without the creme fraiche?). I will absolutely make this recipe again, but I think I will cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup. I also followed the other cooks' very helpful suggestions about reducing the cooking time of the apples and the baking time of the tarte, and I cooked it in a 9-inch cake pan as well.

If I had to choose one desert for the rest of my life - this is the one! How can you lose with Pate Brisee and carmelized apples. For the pastry I leave out the shortening, add a few more tablespoons of butter, and whip one egg yolk into the ice water. I agree with the previous reviewer about shortening the apples' cooking time on the stove top by carmelizing the sugar a bit longer before placing the apples in the pan.

This is the best recipe I have ever used from the wonderful Epicurious. I do it a bit differently and it is predictably perfect each time. I make the crust, bake it for 10 min in the oven. Then, I placed the cooked apples in the tart crust in pan and bake for 10-15 more min. until the crust in browned. My supply of Normandy Calvados is dwindling. Now it's time to la Belle France for a refill.

I think this is my favorite apple dessert now. It is even better than some I've had in France (probably thanks to the alcohol.) I used 10 apples and two 9-inch cake pans. I transported the pans (with the apples already in) and the crust separately to the party site, put the crusts on and baked them there. I found that it takes longer for the apples to caramelize if you follow the directions exactly and the apples turn mushy after that long, so the third time I made them I caramelized the sugar mixture a bit more before putting in the apples and they turned out perfect. Even my newly-arrived French sister-in-law liked them. I've made them with Calvados and plain brandy and could not tell the difference. So now I used plain brandy and save the Calvados for the whipped cream I serve it with.
