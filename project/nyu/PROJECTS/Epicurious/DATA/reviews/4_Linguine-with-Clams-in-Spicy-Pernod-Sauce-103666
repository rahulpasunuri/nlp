Good, easy recipe. Unfortunately, fresh clams were not available at Whole Foods the night I made this, so I used canned clams. I the clam liquor to help flavor the sauce instead of water, and the sauce came out nicely seasoned. I also cut the butter up into pieces to better incorporate the butter into the sauce. The mistake I made was putting the claims in at the beginning. Next time, if fresh clams are not available, I'll put the clams in at the very end and just heat them through, but I'll add the clam liquor with the other liquids. I found that simmering the sauce over a medium heat reduced the sauce down nicely.

This recipe was amazing; however, I put the oil in when the recipe called for it, and there was so much smoke that I set my smoke alarm off. I would suggest cooling the pan & clams briefly before adding the oil. Also, I let the sauce simmer (on low) for while longer, and the sauce reduced to perfection. Overall, a very good recipe (will definitely keep in the recipe book), just watch out for smoke.

We enjoyed this dish. The pernod gave it a unique licorice taste. I used Marzano tomatoes and added finely sliced basil and eliminated the water. The clams exuded enough broth. Perfect.

I loved hearing the fennel seeds pop! I felt that using my own homemade fettucini really made the dish extra special. Guests raved. The fact that is not heavy with cream really adds to the enjoyment of this dish. I added half a can of clams and their broth as well as some large shrimp to stretch the quantity. Will become a classic in our home.

I make my clam sauce only this way now, have been making it for a couple of years and use canned clams and when I didn't have pernod used a cheaper brand of anisette it worked just as great.

This was so, SO good. It was easy, too. Made it exactly as the recipe. I'm making it again tonight. Don't change anything.

I made this last night (Valentines Day) and it was wonderful. The fennel seeds combined with the red chili flakes, wine and garlic, was just a delicious combination. I used cockel clams and they rocked too. I also skipped the Pernod and added more wine. Excellent dish.

THIS IS EXCELLENT. I'VE MADE IT SEVERAL TIMES. ONE TIME I TRIED IT WITH THE ANCHOVIES BUT I THINK IT MUCKED IT UP A LITTLE . SAUCE JUST DIDN'T TASTE QUITE RIGHT. "DON'T FIX IT IF IT AIN'T BROKE."

I just came across this recipe--haven't made it yet, but it sounds just like a recipe I used to make that also included pork--as I recall, someone passed the recipe on to me and said it was Portuguese. I browned smallish strips of pork first, then proceeded with the recipe more or less as given here, except that I also waited until near the end to add clams. I was using small cherrystone clams; larger ones might need longer to cook. If you wanted to brown the shells as this recipe suggests, I would then remove the clams and return them near the end to cook 'til open so they're not underdone... I also added a little white vermouth with the Pernod. The Pernod flavor is not for everyone, but I'm a sucker for it and for clams, so I loved this recipe. Also do not judge what you will think of the finished dish by how much you like the smell or taste of straight Pernod!

Quite yummy. Will make again, next time with the little bit of anchovy recommended by other reviewers.

We love this recipe and have made it 5 times, now. I took one reviewer's advice and added anchovy (paste)to the sauce and waited to add the clams until I dropped the pasta in the water. Otherwise, they're overcooked. Have made it once with shrimp in addition to the clams. Fantastic!

This was very good, although I had to use canned clams as we can not get fresh ones in Quebec. I also added a bit more red pepper flakes as I like spicy food. Will make again.

woo-wee pernod is an interesting color! i can only imagine what real absinthe looked like back in the day.... while this dish wasn't my favorite, i did enjoy it quite a bit and it impressed the heck out of my boyfriend's brother-from-out-of-town. i would recommend and i will definitely make it again sometime.

Three and a half forks, actually. Definitely a keeper. Easy to make. Certain to please sophisticated palates. Will try this one on guests next time. Doubled the tomatoes for a heartier sauce. I took the advice of a previous reviewer who suggested adding anchovies to the saute and putting clams in at the last few minutes. They open quickly...and cooking them for too long will just make them rubbery.

Nicely balanced, complex sauce. I put the fennel seeds to soak in the water the night before so they were soft and released their flavor well. I used a package of frozen-on-the-half-shell manilla clams. Fast, easy, good looking and delicious.

This was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. We used a superior pasta from Italy (ordered from Zingerman's), and the only changes I made to the recipe were to start by sauteeing an anchovy or two and garlic in olive oil. Then I added the tomatoes and such, then the wine and Pernod, *then* the clams. They didn't take long to open at all, so I was glad I saved it for the end. It was absolutely fantastic.

This was wonderful. Very light and delicate tasting and a breeze to prepare. Not being a linguine or clam fan, I substitued regular spaghetti on the first remake and Angel hair on the second. Also, substituted shrimp for the clam. My preference was the Angel Hair and Shrimp. This is a simple, easy to make recipe that will wow any dinner guests you may have. My teenage daughter's comment; "Cool, it looks like something out of a magazine!!" Then she asked for seconds.

A prince of a dish! The flavors are robust but balanced. Caveat: My clams were ready much sooner than 7-10 minutes, and it is perfectly great to hasten the recipe along; do not leave the clams long after they have opened.

This was great. To the 7/30 reviewer-Pernod is a classic accompaniment to seafood.

I made this two weeks ago for friends. The recipe was easy to execute and produced fantastic results. My dinner guests are still talking about it. To the 7/30/00 reviewer: of course it's not the classic recipe - it's a wonderful variation; how about trying it before panning it?

Perhaps reviewers should actually TRY the recipes before rating them. Coming from someone who doesn't even usually LIKE clams, this was a spicy treat. The Pernod tempers the fire of the pepper for a great pasta dish.

Zero! Some years ago a great Italian chef said to me "Simple cooking is the best cooking." Your linguine should be just about done before the clams open. Leave the Pernod with the cookies.You can't beat the traditional recipe no matter what. Sorry.
