Our whole family loved this recipe...it is absolutely delicious without overpowering the steak.

Excellent recipe! There were only two of us, so we used the leftover butter over hamburgers. So good. I think I'll make a big batch of the butter to keep in the freezer for quick meals.

So hate to break this 100% run but. . . this was not worth the effort. I actually did get a request for the recipe but either my tastebuds have started to go (like everything else in my early 40's), or this really is ba - land. You try.

I recommend the version of this in Rib Eye Steaks with Bearnaise Butter (Bon Appetit 99). It calls for reducing the shallots with white wine before compounding the butter, which intensifies the flavor. But this recipe inspired the addition of a squeeze of lemon which makes a big difference. Overall, though, 2 similar ideas, and it was delicious over a pepper crusted filet (not to mention a lot less agony than bearnaise sauce).

I just made this. Won't be making the steaks for a few hours & won't have a chance to post later, so thought I'd write now and say it's to die for. More intense flavor than bearnaise sauce. I didn't have fresh tarragon so pulled a couple sprigs from a jar of tarragon vinegar a friend had given us & used that. Strange, maybe, but great flavor.

Delicious, but as another reviewer suggested, a quality, juicy grilled steak tastes great already. I'll enjoy using this butter on other dishes, particularly vegies.

With our home-grown tarragon, and good quality butter, what could be better than this simple treatment for a good rib-eye? A seasonal favorite.

The recipe is worth having simply for the butter. Even after the steak was gone they asked for more butter to use on everything else and left with its recipe.

I made this, for my husband's birthday dinner. I used 1 1/2 inch thick sirloin steaks. I could not grill, and do not own a grill pan. I broiled the steaks to a lovely medium rare, and topped with the butter. Served with steamed asparagus, boiled new potatoes, and sauted mushrooms. The dinner was a big hit. My husband said it was better than anything he could have gotten in a restaurant.

I agree with Ridge Manor, FL. It's quite likely in my opinion that if you have four 1" ribeyes, that ALONE without an herb butter, they will be excellent. Maybe it's not the recipe for something special, as much as 4 excellent steaks with special enhancements or not. Still, it's easy enough to put together, so I would consider making it again. I just wouldn't expect great reviews unless I began with great steaks; and I'd assume it was perhaps the STEAKS which deserved the applause, moreso than the bearnaise butter making them great.

I've made this a number of times. Easy. I agree with the Cook in MA - the Bearnaise Butter is delicious on ANY steak! It's also good on dinner rolls!

Simply delicious.

My taste buds must have had a bad day, for I found this to be not as wonderful as all the reviewers have noted. I made it exactly as the menu states. My guests felt the same way.

The butter was incredible! I have tried it on both rib-eyes and filets and it is best on filets (use sparingly). Like the other cook, my rib-eyes were not the greatest... they needed a bit more flavor.

The taste of the bearnaise butter with the steak was awesome. I was disappointed with the steaks themselves. I don't know if it was the particular rib eyes that I bought or the cut in general. I might try this butter on a sirloin steak the next time.

I am not a steak person but my wife is. I love to cook to please her and this recipe was a real hit. I could learn to like steak with this recipe. I bet it would make a great burger topper.

Wonderful! Freezing is the way to go, and works great with any steak.

Unbelievably delicious, and almost no work. I'm delighted to hear the earlier suggestion about freezing the butter...I'm going to be eating well this summer!

This Bearnaise Butter is delicious on any steak! I make it and freeze it. Then just cut a pad off and place it on the steak when it comes right off the fire. It melts right in!

There was no fresh tarragon in the two markets I tried this week. So I used dried, it was still GOOD.

This was one of the best steaks I have ever had!!! I have not been much of a steak lover in the past, but my husband absolutely loves it. I figured I should start making more of an effort to make steak dinners for him, so I found this recipe and tried it. We both absolutely LOVED it! What a fabulous flavor! I plan to try the sauce with grilled chicken, as well! Definitely added this one to my "favorites"!

Simple to prepare and delicious! Be sure to add the butter the minute the steaks come off the grill. KIMBER

I loved this dish - very simple yet sophisticated. I slighly overcooked the steaks, so I'll be more careful next time, but there definately will be a next time!
