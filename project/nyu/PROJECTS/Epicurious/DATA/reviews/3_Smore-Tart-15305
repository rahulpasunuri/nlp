Excellent recipe! Would recommend reheating the marshmallow topping with a mini-torch, though. This caught on fire under my broiler after mere seconds! Fortunately, I had made two large tarts and had one left to serve.

Absolutely delicious, got rave reviews from my staff and the customers. Will make again.
