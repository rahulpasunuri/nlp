Great Hors doeuvre! Unfortunately I was unable to get Nori and Wasabi, though it was fantastic without.

Wow! This was delicious!! All my guests were raving about it. Did add some finely chopped green chilli for an extra bite (think my wasabi powder was a little old!) Easy to make and a perfect party dish!

I really liked this recipe a lot. Several reviewers said they had trouble with everything sticking together, the secret to that is to MINCE EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT VERY, VERY FINELY......It comes out looking exactly like a 'tartare' should. Rather than put strips of nori around the edges (some said when served it started looking messy), I just cut some nori in tiny, tiny pieces and sprinkled it over the dish. Looked and tasted really good. The only other slight change I made was to omit the lemon (so it wouldn't lighten the salmon color as some complained)...mixed the wasabi with soy sauce instead...The sesame oil I had on hand has chili oil in it....I used it and loved the extra spice added. My husband is already asking me to make this again, as I made it for a party and it was gone too quickly for him to have as much as he wanted!!!!

I will use a whole piece of smoked salmon, not sliced, and cube it next time. The lemon juice "cooks" the salmon. I think this is why people suggested raw salmon. I have to agree the the previous post. It doesn't count to rate a recipe after you have altered it substantially. There's a great recipe on here for cinnamon apple crisp, a lot of sugar & butter. A shortbread topping. People cut the butter & sugar, and add oatmeal. There are 150 other apple crisp recipes on the site. I laugh. Exchanged the apples for tomatoes, sugar/cinnamon for onions, butter for oil, eliminated flour, great on pasta!

Dont understand people who change recipe so drastically that it becomes something else!!!!!!!!!! Recipe is just wonderful as it is, Ahi tuna would make it ahi tuna tartare, different thing entirely. Will keep this as a staple in my recipe box

This recipe has been a huge hit at our dinner parties. The key to making this recipe such a delicious success is to replace the smoked salmon with fresh Ahi tuna. We also serve this finger food on cracked pepper water crackers, easy to find at the market, forget the nori. It's a delicious dish and pretty to serve. Use a little more spice as well.

I made the salmon recipe as is. I did not use the nori. Instead I served the salmon on rice crakers. It was great.

This is a good recipe. I use it at home and work. Nice presentation for up scale guests.

Like the cook from Boston, I tried this before a big dinner party and decided not to include it on the menu. We followed the recipe exactly as written, and we didn't care for it at all! Smoked salmon is just not good this way, the nori was messy and unattractive, and it needed more of the other spices. I would follow the advice of the other cooks next time - fresh salmon, add soy sauce, omit the nori, etc etc. I don't recommend following the recipe here.

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner last year and was a huge hit! Has been a staple ever since.

This is a delicious recipe. Do not use smoked salmon, only fresh. I also made some changes, as did others. I added several splashes of soy sauce, fresh cracked black pepper, salt, and a TINY amount of rice vinegar. This enhanced the flavor. For those who prefer more wasabi, be careful, because the powder can make the dish chalky -- and more lemon juice will make it too tart. I balanced this problem with the soy sauce and rice vinegar. Also, it is IMPORTANT to let the dish set for about an hour. The juices will release and allow for the ingredients to stay together (some people complained about the dish "falling apart").

We used fresh tuna, eliminated the nori, increased wasabi by 50%, stirred the diced tuna in the wasabi and lemon juice mixture to "cook" while cutting the other ingredients, and then served it in baked wonton cups (see the Alaska King Crab hors d'oeuvres recipe on this site that uses the wonton cups). It got raves and was delicious!

Try this: Remove the Cucumber Remove the Nori strips Add Sesame Oil (Sesame Seeds optional) ADD Olive Oil Add Soya sauce Add a mashed Avocado and, tell me about it!

We have made this at least 10 times. Forget the smoked salmon, I used fresh salmon and served it as an hors d'oeuvre on endive topped with salmon caviar. Try it with Tuna.

For a recipie that includes so many of my favorite ingridents I was disappointed with the final result. There were too many stong flavors competing here - and the mixture did not hold together as you would expect - very messy to eat. I was glad I tried it out ahead of time before preparing it for a dinner party - because after tying it I decided not to include it on my menu.

I made this for a party and got raves! I would omit the nori and simply serve on it's own on a platter or in a small bowl, garnished with cilantro sprigs and thin lemon wedges. A little extra ginger helps.

These are some of my favorite flavors, but it was a lot of work when the ingredients would have tasted better if left alone. The lemon bleached out the smoked salmon, and the whole thing did not hold together well.
