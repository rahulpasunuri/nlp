An excellent soup! I used good veggie broth and the only addition I made was a bit of parmigiano rind. Like good gazpacho, you need to add the toast for the right texture. Gets better the following day.

Good, thick soup. I used 4 cups vegetable broth + 3 cups water and didn't add the basil, red cabbage or zucchini, but otherwise followed the recipe. Tasty and satisfying, will make again!

Great, hearty soup! Like basically everyone else I didn't add in the bread. I did add in chard, skipped the red cabbage, and substituted pinto beans since I didn't have white. You can really throw in whatever veggies are in the kitchen. It was a great soup and I'll make it again come winter for sure.

Delicious! Closest to the soup I enjoyed while in Tuscany years ago. I used chicken stock, a parmesan rind, and kale instead of the cabbages. This made a ton of soup and guests and kids all liked it!

I made this soup last night and thought it was wonderful. I, too, left out the bread and served it on the side and I also threw the parmesan rind in when adding the red cabbage and zuchinni. I only used 5 cups of vegetable broth because my pot was not big enough. The color was fine and the consistancy was thick...like a stew. It reheated wonderfully and I am enjoying right now as I am typing my review :)

Loved this receipe, I did change a couple things. I did not have time to use DRY beans,I put in 2 cans of cannellini beans instead, I also did not use the bread as a thickner. I saved the bread and used it on the side. It was an excellant soup which I will make again.. Family loved it children as well as adults. Enjoy

I did not have fresh Thyme - used dried; did not hae zuccini - used Barley and Broccoli Rabe. Lastly, no fresh parmesan (used the stuff in the green can). Turned out Great. I also put a couple of drops of balsamic vinegar on afterwards - to my dish.

Simply AWFUL! The color (brownish purple) and texture (mush) was bad without the bread and cheese. With the bread and cheese it was horrible! I am a very good, experienced cook and thought this had promise. Wrong!

This soup is boiling at the moment, but I can't wait to tear into it. I cut alot of corner, because I wanted to use what was in the pantry. So I used an entired (small) head of green cabbage, a can of diced tomatoes, a can of pureed fire-roasted tomatoes, two cans of Great Northern beans, a can of French cut green beans (for the celery), and slaw-cut carrots. Will serve bread and parm on side as my daughter is a vegan.

Lovely soup, I followed others advice and added the Parmesan rind, also used chicken stock, and omitted the red cabbage. With that, it was easily 4 forks. It was lovely. Simple and very tasteful. Without the cheese rind, it was a bit bland. I chopped the cabbage relatively finely, as someone else suggested and it ended up being like stringy noodles, not great. But another chopping method would have remedied that unappealing part. Not something that would change the taste but a personal preference that I just found out I had. :-) happy eating!

A truly delicious soup. Take the time to make the vegetable stock yourself -- it doesn't take that much extra time and really does make a tremendous difference. And add Parmesan rinds. Add the basil at the end, unless you have lots on hand and can add it to the stock and again just before serving.

Rating: 3
Everyone in my family likes this soup, even my two twenty-something sons. The only thing I vary, and I do not know where I came up with this idea, is that I take about a cup of the beans after soaking and puree them before adding them to the soup, which thickens the broth a bit. I also do not bother with the bread.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe with the suggestions of others, using all green cabbage instead of green & red, throwing a cheese rind in while the soup simmered, using chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and skipping the bread, but still found the soup to be a bit bland. I found that adding a teaspoon or two of sugar did the trick, though--just like you would add to a fresh a tomato sauce to pique the flavors. I also topped the soup with fresh basil (in addition to the cooked basil), parmesan, fresh black pepper, and extra virgen olive oil after plating, and found that that enlivened the dish nicely. Be careful about adding the parmesan to the soup before it's had a chance to cool down to serving temperature. If the soup is too hot it will melt the parmesan, creating a weird stringy texture in the soup.

Great soup! I served the bread on the side.

Since there is some controversy, I had to add my 2 cents that this is a truly excellent recipe. I've made it over and over. I do modify it as some of the other reviews have noted, such as adding Parmesan cheese rind, using chicken broth, and skipping the bread at the end. I think I also use a little extra garlic. If you have good quality ingredients, it turns out just beautifully.

Rating: 3
I'd like to note a couple of modifications in case you have the same reaction that I have to soups with cabbage....instead of the cabbage, I threw in some chopped organic kale and organic spinach right at the end in place of the cabbage. It only needed to cook for about 1 1/2 minutes before dishing up the soup. I also added some fennel at the same time as the celery--it was delicious and seemed to belong in this soup. I used less fresh tomatoes and added a tablespoon of tomato paste. Very good base soup, try it!

This soup is delicious, I used canned cannellini beans, just green cabbage and chicken stock. I will make it again!!

I used a tip from one of the previous cooks and put a ham hock in the broth because I didn't have any cheese rinds. I also omitted the bread, serving it on the side. I left out the red cabbage, substituting all green. It was a hit at my house and in my opinion, tasted much better the second day.

I had to make this, despite the mixed reviews (or, perhaps, b/c of them). I thought it was bland, but good. My guests all liked it, too. I followed the recipe, but with canned tomatoes, not fresh. I also followed the suggestion to add the bread & cheese to each bowl, which was good (and allowed me to leave it out of one person's that doesn't like cheese).

I had to make this soup because of all the hoopla written on this site. I made some recommended changes, i.e, the parmesan rind (which made the soup) and using chicken broth in place of vegetable. I also added beef bouillon cubes (with water), navy beans (because that's what I had on hand) and eliminated the red cabbage and increased the green. It was WONDERFUL! Very hearty and worthy of repeating. Gave some to a friend (it makes alot) and she loved it, too. I didn't do the bread and parmesan at the end. It would have been too thick and heavy. The soup is thick enough as it is. If desired, I'd add the bread to the bowl, as others have advised. I'd give this 4 forks with the changes I made.

Rating: 3
The thing missing is a big piece of parmesan rind in the soup while it is cooking. Many Italian meatless soups include it. One rind can flavor two or three soups, so even though it looks yucky when you take it out, save it and reuse. Without the rind, it would have to have at least a nice big bone or ham hock.

I served this for lunch one day to visiting Thanksgiving week relatives. Everyone loved it. I thought it needed seasoning then I realized it was because I used low-sodium vegetable broth. ALL the veggies were great. I wouldn't leave any out. I bought a really nice round loaf of multi-grain bread and only put in 4 slices because they were so big. They disappear once they are in the soup. It definitely makes 12 serving.s

This was quite possibly the best soup I've ever made. After serving it tonight I couldn't wait to see how it was reviewed on this website. I was shocked, especially about the comments about the red cabbage and its "unappealling" color. What's that all about? There are tomatoes in this recipe- the only color (red, not purple) in my soup was from them. Because my daughter is a vegetarian, I used 8 c. veggie broth and 1 Knorrs vegetable boullion. I added 2 tsp. sea salt and 3/4 tsp fresh pepper at the end. I omitted the bread all together- it was completely unnecessary as my soup was sufficiently thickened. Yes, there is a fair amount of cutting and chopping but it's worth it. Do not substitue canned beans for fresh, use fresh herbs and the best parmesean you can find. This is a Keeper!

Rating: 3
Here's my comments on this soup (having made it for the first time tonight): 1/ Make 1/2 the recipe the first time, it's designed to feed TWELVE. If you don't like it, less to throw out. 2/ Don't use the red cabbage. I hesitated seriously before adding, and then kind of regretted it. It doesn't ruin the soup, I just have a hunch the actual recipe (don't we wish we could have it) does not include that. 3/ Slice any cabbage that you do put it in very, very thin strips. Cabbage is not appealing in soups and you want to kind of camoflage. 4/ This recipe needs either more salt (a lot more) or bouillion cubes. And definitely use chicken broth or a combination of chicken/vegetable. If you do the above, it's actually quite, quite good.

My husband loved this soup, but I thought it was missing something. I made it almost as directed, substituting kale for the cabbage and canned beans for dried. I think if it were made with chicken broth, extra garlic, and possibly some sort of leftover meat it would be really good. To be fair it deserves 2.5 forks.

The soup was good, but the color from the red cabbage made it very unappetizing. Next time I'll leave out the red cabbage.

My family devoured it!! All 3 of my kids and my husband have been begging me to make it again. I used canned cannellini, 6 cups veg. broth, 2 cups beef broth, and omitted the red cabbage. I also added left over roast beef. This soup gets better with age!

I sought out a recipe of this nature as I was having vegetarians among my dinner guests. I'm not used to cooking for vegetarians and thought this soup would be appropriate. My guests raved over it and I thought it was pretty good but I too thought it was "missing something." I used vegetable broth, not chicken as I felt obligated to stick with it being completely vegetarian. I used Knorr's vegetarian bullion cubes and made 12 cups, putting two cups aside until I was sure I might need it. Sure enough, I did need it, adding it after I had added the toasted bread. However, I intend to use chicken broth the next time as I think this might have given it more flavor. I made the whole thing in an 8qt stockpot which was just big enough. I'm anxious to try the leftovers to see if I like it any better than the first time. I often don't have much appetite when I've been cooking all day. This is a labor-intensive soup to make, lots of cutting and chopping. Will use my cutting appliances next time for all the cutting. It is very good and certainly worth the effort. Unless my guests were lying to me, it seemed to be a hit! Bon Appetite!

I thought this soup was wonderful! It had a great flavor and everything. The bread did it's job in thickening the soup and the Parmesan gave it a nice bite. I will definately make this soup again. As for the lack of flavor some are referring to I do like a "clean" tasting soup so I liked it a lot - but maybe a smoked ham hock thrown in while cooking would give another layer of flavor. I have to make it again tomorrow and I may try that.

I was confused by the conflicting reviews so I decided to make this recipe anyway. It smelled delicious as I was making it, however my husband and I both agreed that it was tasteless. This was after I used canned chicken broth and liberally salted and peppered it before serving. The addition of the bread and cheese didn't help either. This recipe makes tons. I should have halved the recipe but didn't - my husband likes to have leftover soup in the fridge at all times for whenever he wants it. Since we're a one income family (I'm a stay at home mom) I hate to waste the leftovers. I guess I'll try and add spicy Italian sausage to my husband's and smoked sausage to mine. There are so many other wonderful recipes out there that I won't bother to make this again.

From the other reviews, I thought I was in for a great soup. Would have preferred to leave out the bread at the end. Served for guests, they were not impressed. Threw the rest away! Will not be added to my favorite soup recipes.

This is a wonderful soup, even using dried spices and canned beans. We also use just one kind of cabbage (green or red) because otherwise we buy two heads and have way too much cabbage left over. It's still excellent. The more grains and nuts in the bread the better because they become part of the soup and add flavor.

We loved this, it was perfect on a very cold night. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and kale instead of the cabbage. Because I hadn't soaked beans overnight, I used Progresso-brand canned Cannellini beans and it was absolutely fine. Lovely meal.

I have made this soup 4 times since I first discovered it (3 months ago). It is truly delicious and easy! I prefer spinach (fresh) over cabbage and chicken broth over vegetable, so those are the only ingredients I changed in this recipe. My family loves it and it is a filling, healthy meal!!

I've made this recipe both with chicken and veggie broth. And I also used green cabbage. I liked what the bread did to the texture of the soup, so I added it, and mixed it in, just before adding the cheese. This recipe is definitely a keeper--and a repeater and repeater!

Rating: 2
This recipe really does make a TON of soup! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except no potatoes. I used a nice 9-grain bread, toasted it, and put the Parmesan right on the bread so it melted onto it. I put the bread into each individual soup bowl and ladled the soup over it. The toast keeps some texture that way, and the cheese doesn't get lost in the bottom of the bowl. This is a good basic recipe, but without the bread and cheese it would be nothing special. But I do have enough leftovers in my freezer to get us through the entire winter!

I've made this several times. With a few modifications, it's wonderful. I took several folks' advice, and left out the red cabbage; instead I used half a head of savoy cabbage at the start, and finished it off with the rest. I also added fresh tarragon and a quarter cup of minced fennel stalk. Since I'm not a vegetarian, I also browned a pound and a half of spicy Italian sausage. This makes it more like a cassoulet, but it's delicious.

I had to use my two biggest pots-- this made a lot! I agree with others on the ugly purple color that the red cabbage adds. It ruined my leftovers. I've made other similar soups that I liked better. There just wasn't any desire to take this for lunch the next day. What a waste. If you thought something was missing there's another recipe on this site called "Winter Vegetable Potage" which is way better.

I helped a friend make this soup one afternoon. We thought it was terrific! It tastes healthy and hearty and we all enjoyed it. We, like other reviewers, added the toasted bread to each bowl rather than to the entire pot. I will definitely make this soup again

This was delicious on a cold rainy night! I agree though that it's best to wait to add the bread until you pour the soup into the bowls--otherwise, you get mushy leftovers which were a disappontment after such a good soup the night before. Used only green cabbage, canned beans, and added 1 cup Pomi marinara in addn. to the fresh tomatoes. Yum.

This was pretty good but not a wow. I wasn't crazy about bread in soup...especially as leftovers, which we didn't entirely finish, very unusual in our house for soup. Maybe better to add bread in serving bowls. It does need the full cooking timme. This soup tastes very similar to an inexpensive soup I've made since college: sauté lots of vegetables in olive oil, add broth or water, some canned beans or pasta if you want, and parmesan and oil on top. I'll likely return to that rather than look up this recipe again.

Can't remember if this is the same place or not, but we have had this soup many times in Florence across the Arno. As others have said "something is missing". Beans seemed more tender in original. Is Red cabbage put in at the end so it is more chewy? Red cabbage seemed tough in mine. Color was not bothersome it seemed like the original, not lavender/purple, in fact, what I think a chef would want, pleasant multi-color vegetable display. I do need to establish a better bread. The bread I used detracted from the taste. No sausage/meat in original, maybe that is a good idea. Don't know of easy way to chop either cabbage, thus, a long prep time. Thanks to the author, she's on the right track because there is just nothing as good as the original Ribboleta.

I love this recipe and had fun preparing it! Made some changes! To make beans more digestible, changed the soak water around every hour 3-4 times, then placed a strip of kombu (kelp, a sea vegetable) on bottom of bowl with beans on top, then final soak water, cover, refrigerate two days. Drain beans. Cut up kombu into tiny squares and set aside (add with beans.) Used 12 qt. pot; extra virgin olive oil; five UNSALTED vegetable cubes (Morga) softened in 1 qt boiling water before adding. Unsalted is key here. Salt used before beans are fully cooked can make them tough. Also added tomatoes with red cabbage and zucchini for the same reason. I like beans soft! Added water as I went along so as to always keep everything covered and just enough to ALMOST cover at the end. Cooked beans 1-1/2 hours before proceeding. Weighed almost everything! Carrots, celery 12-oz each; potatoes (Yukon Gold), tomatoes, white and red cabbages, zucchini 1 to 1-1/4# each. (If using large garden variety of zucchini, remove seeds and the soft pithy part in center.) At the end, I took out 3 ladles-full of liquid and added one packet vegetable Miso-Cup Soup to compensate for additional water and salt needed. Did not use additional oil or bread suggested. Parmesan a must; added individually! Enjoy!

This was a good soup but just not as good as my usual recipe, which is stir-cooked veggies then added tomato paste. cooked in broth with potato, cooked beans & at the end - stir in paste of blended basil, garlic, olive oil. serve on coarse bread. As my husband said, I should not mess with perfection. I think iit was all the cabbage that bothered my pallet.

Delicious! Made this as written and it turned out beautifully. I topped each individual serving with toasted bread (used 5-grain whole wheat from Amy's bread) and parm rather than mix it in (in the interest of leftovers). Alot of prep work is entailed but after that it's a cinch and smells wonderful as it simmers. Use the biggest pot you have, I started with a 5.5 quart and had to move to a 8 quart half way through.

Hmm, let's see, I made an identical soup last week without a recipe from ingredients on hand, the only difference being that we added the bread and grated fresh parmesan to each bowl when serving; otherwise the texture of the bread is lost when leftovers are reheated. I thought it was a tad bland but can't put my finger on what's missing. I see the food police are weighing in on the matter of sliced bread. That's a shame, because it has its place and there are some darn good ones out there, like Pepperidge Farm German Dark Wheat--mmm -- and they make a good 7-grain bread as well. That said, I would agree that with a soup like this one would want a crusty peasant bread. With cheese and fruit, it's the perfect autumn meal.

This soup is great. When the recipe says 'sliced bread' it probably means sliced Italian bread, homemade if you like, not Wonder bread/sliced bread. Big deal, use whichever you like. Euros are consumed by the myth that 'all' their food is pure natural made by Grandma and 'all' American food is imitation/made from chemicals.

In fact, leeks are botanologically a member of the onion family, so no, substituting them for onions isn't weird at all. You might also want to experiment with different kinds of onions -- shallots, for instance, also have a milder, more delicate flavor than regular onions and might work for you. As regards the issue of sliced bread: having traveled extensively all over Italy practically every year since 1979 and even having lived there for a few months once, I have to agree with Phil that no self-respecting Italian would ever use sliced bread. The issue is not in the slicing, it is that pre-sliced bread is full of all kinds of additives and preservatives that keep it fresh even though it's exposed to the air, and they affect the flavor. And Peggy, really, why all the sarcasm? I am amazed at the number of people on this site who are nasty to others. We all come from different backgrounds, okay? I thought the point of writing reviews was to *help*. I, for one, thoroughly enjoy the diversity of viewpoints on this site. Let's not kill it. Say whatever it is that you want to say, just don't be nasty about it.

QUESTION: Would substituting leeks for the onion be too weird? I've never been a big onion fan; however, I quite appreciate the taste of leeks. Please don't hurt me--I'm just starting out in the kitchen and my palate isn't as developed as I hope it to be someday. Thank you.

Over here in Tuscany it is absolkutely unheard of that beans might be cooked that way for the soup. The beans are cooked separately, and than mixed with the vegetables and of course the liquid one uses is the liquid from the beans, not a broth made separately vegeyable or otherwise
