Yummy! I did read the other reviews first and this influenced how I made the dish. I had a cantaloupe in the fridge and used it since I saw a comment on how lovely the colors were together. Second, I used poached chicken breasts because I had those on hand and I didn't know if my guests would like smoked. Third, I diced the melon and tossed everything like a salad in the dressing, then chilled for a couple of hours in the fridge. That seemed to really pull the flavors together. I served this to sorority sisters and they asked me to make it again. Believe me, I will, whenever melons are in season.

Really interesting and delicious. I will definitely make it again. Too bad the only person who gave this one star substituted absolutely every ingredient and thought they may have use bad ham. Guys... if you use rotted food and don't use the recipe, does it not occur to you that a review isn't really appropriate? We are trying to help people rate the recipe. This isn't about "you" and your experience the day you made something vaguely related.

Perfectly written!! Only change I would make is to add a bit more zucchini and honeydew for that amount of meat. Refreshingly light and yummy!!!

I used this salad as a side dish, so I did not use chicken. My husband loved it. I did not have fresh mint, so I infused the olive oil with dried mint. I can't wait to try it with fresh mint.

This recipe came our great!! What a terrific use of zucchini. I left out the chicken (didn't have any today), and used cantaloupe (fresh from the co-op farm -- perfect) instead of honeydew. The colors on the plate were lovely (I used a yellow zucchini). I fed this to my zucchini-detesting husband, and he had thirds!! My kids liked it, too. A few toasted pecans were a nice addition.

WOW, I was weary mixing all the flavors together, but it was great! I did not add the chicken, I used crumbled bacon instead and treated the dish as a side vegetable. Even my kids, who hate zucchini, loved it. (I did not drizzle their dish with the olive oil/lime juice mixture). The zuc is so thin and tasty that you hardly notice it. I will definately serve this again.

I gave this 1 fork because I took some of the advice from others and just didn't like the way it turned out. Tried prosciutto instead and maybe I got some that was bad since it smelled somewhat fishy (?). Spent so much on the ham that I skimped on the cheese (where I should've spent the most money!). First time with raw zucchini and learned I like it better cooked. Used basil instead of mint. So really the only thing I liked about it was the melon. Might try someday with chicken and mint but for now it's out of the recipe box.

I made this with cantaloupe and no chicken. Excellent! The mint, zucchini and cantaloupe go very well together. Great way to use up my mint. This is going to be a summer staple.

Perfect summer dinner or lunch, cool and delicious with crusty bread. (I used some bacon and some grilled chicken).

My guests LOVED this. I think the key was really great, fresh zucchini and melon. I skipped the meat. I also added some grated parmesean to the top just for a little more flavor

This is a keeper. Made it last night, followed it exactly but with the additon of prosiutto and no salt. I used a mandloin so prep time was next to zero. Great summer dinner!

i added basil instead of mint and it was a great combination. i also only had smoked turkey instead of chicken, and the combination was great! this is easy and it looks great!

To the cook from Austin, the directions clearly instruct you to shave only one fourth of the cheese into curls. I assume one starts with a bigger piece to facilitate shaving.

This recipe was excellent, I changed it since I do not like the combination of parmesan with mint, I used excellent feta cheese and added some walnuts. You could vary it using instead of mint, basil leaves then it will combined well with the parmesan. For vegetarian I omit the chicken since the cheese is a good amount.

Very fresh and light and summery -- I thought proscuitto would be a good sub for the smoked chicken, and it was!!!

Guessing you're really supposed to shave the whole 1/2 lb. of cheese and divide it in fourths amongst the four plates... Haven't tried it, but it does sound interesting.
