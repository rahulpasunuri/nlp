I love this recipe in winter because it is so fresh tasting, especially after all the heavy holiday foods. I first had it when a friend made it for New Year's Eve and at first I was suprised we weren't having some rich chocolatey thing, but this surpassed my expectations. It is also very easy, mostly do-ahead, and guests are always surprised at both the idea and how delicious it is. Kumquat season is very short, so put this recipe in your calendar for December and January so you won't miss it!

Outstanding!! The first time through it seems complicated; the next time it will be a breeze. The sweetness led to a debate--on red leaf lettuce it's an appetizer--what makes it a dessert?
