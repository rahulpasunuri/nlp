the cake by itself is just ok. it's the fresh strawberries and chocolate sauce that make it amazing. Mine didn't come out dry like everyone else said. But I altered the recipe by using only 1/2 cup sour cream and adding 3 additonal egg yolks. Also, I used a silicone bundt pan and put in in a baking dish with an inch or so of water. I baked it at 350 for the first 15 min, then 325 for just under an hour. Use GOOD chocolate for the sacue and forget the sugar on the strawberries (if they are in season, they are sweet enough.)

I did not make this recipe, but for those of you looking for a really good moist chocolate loaf cake, look in Nigella Lawson's "How to be a Domestic Goddess" cookbook, in the Chocolate chapter. It's wonderful.

I did not make this recipe since all the reviews said it was dry. However, I can recommend a good chocolate pound cake recipe - it's the chocolate bread recipe in The Cake Bible. It's made in a 8x4 loaf pan, is moist, dense, and has a nice chocolate flavor. I've usually just put the sugar syrup/liquer (Bailey's, Kahlua, Grand Marnier) glaze on it. It's very easy too.

Oh my, this cake was delicious. I love to bake pies and cookies, but am not usually a cake baker. I doubled the recipe and baked it in one of those new silicone bundt pans. It was delicious and so moist. I served it alone with fresh strawberries at a party, but look forward to serving it again with the chocolate sauce and ice cream.

Other reviewers are correct that this recipe turns out too dry and not much like pound cake at all. It is tasty though. The next time I would add a few extra egg yolks to see if that made it more "pound cakey". I think I might also melt the chocolate chips before adding them to the batter. Would love to know if anyone out there has a fool proof choc. pound cake recipe though.

My family loved this cake. It wasn't dry at all, I followed the ingredients but adjusted the process, I don't know if this made a difference. I put the sugar, eggs, vanilla in a blender and blended until mixed about 10 seconds. Then, I melted the butter and slowly poured into the blender while it was going. Then added the sour cream. Poured all into a bowl and then added dry ingredients. I baked it at 350 for 15 mins and then reduced heat to 325. (This is the technique from Cooks Illustrated for Lemon pound cake.) Works great!

I made this recipe for Christmas this year and my only problem with it was that I made the poundcake 2 days prior to serving (as the recipe says) and it seemed a little dry. I would suggest making it less than one day prior to ensure moistness.

From now on I will trust the reviews. Something is missing from this pound cake, very dry!

Paying attention to the reviewers who criticized the cake for being dry, I used a full cup of sour cream. The resulting cake definitely wasn't dry, but it was heavy, without a good pound cake crumb. I was not impressed, although I have to say that people loved the dessert; I attribute that to the sauce, which was quite good, and to the strawberries and ice cream. The four elements combined made a spectacular dessert even though the cake itself was not memorable.

turned out excellent! I sliced the cake into individual portions, glazed each with a bittersweet glaze and served it with strawberries and whipped cream. My family and guestes throught it was professionally made!

The recipe made my mouth water but it was a little short on pizzaz! I read the reviews and added more sour cream and used a water bath to keep in the mositure. However, it just didn't really cut it. So, I sliced it, toasted and served with ice cream and chocolate sauce.

This recipe was wonderful! Everyone I served it to REALLY enjoyed it. The Strawberry ice cream added a nice contrast to the richness of the cake & sauce. Not only was it tasty, but it was also incredibly easy to make. I will definitely make this dessert again. Maybe try Peppermint ice cream around the holiday season.

Although it had a pretty good taste, it was too dry. I suggest adding a pan of water to the oven to keep in moisture or maybe a tiny bit of milk to the mix. Also, the amount of chocolate chips suggested is too much so i cut back on that. I pureed strawberries and sugar to make an additional syrup which made a great addition.

My family absolutely loved this dessert. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry sauce on a glass dish so it was not only a wonderful dessert, it looked wonderful also

We were treated to this delicious chocolate pound cake with strawberries and chocolate sauce on New Year's Eve. It was a perfect winter time desert after a lovely and flavourful meal. The sauce was thick, velvety and rich and you can't help but indulge. Heavy, dense, moist and delicious.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday dinner since all 14 of our guests LOVE chocolate. Although the recipe was easy and there was no cake left at the end of dinner, it just didn't "bowl us over". I felt it was dry in spite of serving it with fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce. This recipe will definately NOT go into my recipe file.

We had the cake with and without the strawberries and it was good both ways. I only used about half the chocolate chips and that seemed to be enough. Loved the cake. It's not too, too chocolatey sweet, but still rich and very light tasting for a pound cake. I'd definately make it again. My kids all loved it.

Not as good as I expected. The cake was not as flavorful or rich as the recipe sounded. It was ok - nothing wrong with it, I just wouldn't make it again.

I made this cake today and it tastes great - can't wait to taste it tomorrow after it has a chance to age. I used four small pans instead of one large one so I can share the wealth!

This was a quick and easy dessert provided you made the pound cake the day before. The cake was very good -- chocolatey without being too sweet and it was neither too dry nor too moist. The chocolate sauce was rich and a little goes a long way. The strawberries were nicely sweetened and the ice cream went well with the cake - the strawberry flavor helped cut some of the chocolate richness or else it might have been too overpowering.
