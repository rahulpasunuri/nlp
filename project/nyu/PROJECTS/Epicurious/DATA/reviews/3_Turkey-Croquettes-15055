I used corn flake crumbs and it was absolutely delicious.

I used minced fresh dill instead of parsley, as well as extra turkey (which I diced finely in the Cuisinart rather than grinding). In addition, I served the croquettes with slices of lime (Cuban style) in place of turkey gravy. The lime perked the croquettes right up!

While bland, this recipe has potential. Minced chiles, or sage, or Old Bay, or nearly anything might give the flavor more spunk. Since the turkey is already cooked it's OK to taste the mixture before cooking. A more interesting sauce than gravy would also help. I made the croquettes into patties, rather than cones, and only breaded them once. I fried them in about1/4" of oil.

I think I know what is missing in these turkey croquettes... Turkey! I made the recipe with 6 cups of turkey and I still could not use all the white sauce. Any less turkey and the croquettes would not have held up. I also had trouble with the amount of bread crumbs. Actually I used a dry stuffing mix, crushed and much more than called for. I think it helped with the rather bland taste. There is no salt and pepper listed, but I added that too. I used homemade turkey broth and baked rather then fried them. I served them with homemade turkey gravy and they were great!

I made this recipe as instructed and half of my croquettes disintegrated in the oil. Those that survived were OK but not great. I think Howard Johnson's had a better recipe.

I read every one else's thoughts, and was concerned that it of th needed a little something extra, so I added garam masala and curry to the mix. I made some croquettes the normal way, and then added curry/garam masala/cumin to about half. We taste tested and compared. The curry croquettes were by far the favorite~ yum! Serve with a curry/coconut milk gravy if you want. Also ground turkey in food processor. BIG time saver. Definitely would repeat the curry version!

Great use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I keep returning to the Epicurious website for the recipe for three years running now. I add a little spicy red pepper, but otherwise found this to be a good recipe-- they taste very much like croquettes I've had in Spain.

Very tasty. I place them on a parchment lined cookie sheet, sprinkle the tops with melted butter, and bake using convection. They come out nice and crispy.

Very good. I heeded the warnings of blandness and added about 4 more dashes of the spices along with sea salt to taste and cayenne pepper which gave it a kick. We also made them patty shaped. By doing this, we thought we could Pan Fry them. Nope...definitely deep fry these guys.

Going on the previous reviews, I added red pepper to spice things up, as well as more flour to have a less mushy consistency. After chilling the mixture in the refrigerator for about 1 1/2 hours, I rolled the balls, dipped in the egg and rolled the ball into the crumbs. The key is to have wet hands. I only rolled 2x in the eggs and crumbs, not 3. They came out wonderful and looked like cigars.

I had a lot of dry turkey leftovers so decided to try this recipe even though the rating wasn't great. I used my food processor to chop the turkey (instead of ground) and found that that worked very well, as well as quick. I also added 1/2 tsp. red pepper since some reviewers thought it was bland. To cool the sauce down quickly I put the saucepan into an ice-water bath. With those changes it didn't take long to make the croquettes. I also made them into patties, and fried in a small amount of olive oil. Still a little bland, but we loved it.

Outstanding, company came and we all enjoyed. A bottle of wine, steamed broccoli, and italian potatoes in the oven complimented the croquettes.

my mother used to make croquettes and this recipe is very close, and my kids love it what more can i say.

I had been looking for a good recipe for croquettes. I used leftover cooked chicken, and minced it rather than grinding it-- this makes it less mushy. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and was delighted with the results. It would be a great party food, and I didn't find the preparation to be all that time consuming.

I actually got this recipe on foodtv.com, compared the ingredients on this website and it is the same exact dish. I had this recipe in my file for the longest time and I finally decided to make this. First of all, this recipe is way too time consuming. Secondly, the result was disappointing. I've had croquettes in the past and they have always been firm. When I bit into this thing, it was biting into mush --way too running for my taste. The only similarity from this dish and croquettes I've had, was the fried part of it. After making this dish, I tossed the recipe out!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but croquette (kroket) is a very common here in the Netherlands. Most Dutch kroketten are made with beef and are very good as a broodjekroket-a kroket with bread (a roll with perhaps some light butter) and a touch of mustard (Hollandse or French Dijon)

These croquettes are really delicious, I've made them twice before and am making them for dinner tonight. Everyone loves them, I'll make them again and again.

Way underseasoned. Also, too loose and creamy inside. I'd prefer it more "solid" and meaty.

Definately Delicious! Since it is time consuming, I did mine in 2 days, making the croquettes on the second day. Everyone loved them!

These were delicious. Even my picky husband loved them. The only change I made was to form them into small patties and intead of deep frying I fried them in a small amount of oil in a frying pan. A bit time consuming but worth it. A definate keeper.
