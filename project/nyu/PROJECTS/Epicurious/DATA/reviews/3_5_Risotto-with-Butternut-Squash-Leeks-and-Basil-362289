Bland. Bland. Bland. I minced up 4 cloves of garlic and added a little bit more salt. Desperately needs garlic in this recipe. Now mine does.

This was so yummy! We loved how the squash broke up the intensity of risotto. I highly recommend it.

I made this today with exceptional results. The only deviance from the recipe was that I used chicken broth. It made a very nice risotto, and was flavorful due to fresh leeks, squash, basil and thyme I used and of course a bit of pepper at the end. It is nice to have a risotto recipe with no butter for a change. My husband and teenagers even loved it. I make a different experimental risotto every month and this one is a keeper.

Very bland. Not looking for another recipe that requires a ton of salt and cheese to taste good.

Reading the other reviews, I wonder if I did something wrong, because this turned out bland for me. I did have to substitute Hubbard squash for butternut. But even with the full amount of leeks and cheese, this just didn't taste like much.

I made this recipe along with the "Hot Date with a Chicken" for a valentine's theme party the Sunday before Valentine's this year and also earlier in the week in order to do a test run. The first time, I used Delicata squash and the second time I used butternut squash. Both turned out fabulously well. I used freshly grated swiss cheese and parmesan (2:1 ratio). I got lots of rave reviews and I had 25 people in attendance at the theme party! This is definitely on my list of favourite make again recipes.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was phenomenal. I halved the recipe which served 2 for dinner (plenty!) and roasted the squash in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper before adding it to the rice, as per the suggestions of several reviewers. I also cooked the rice slightly longer than the instructions, and added broth after adding the squash. Do not be intimidated by risotto! This was my first one and it was super easy. Just be patient and be sure to stir often :)

This was the best risotto I have ever made. I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth. It was so flavorful and creamy. I loved it!

This was tasty but be sure to use fresh basil. We used dried about 1/3 Cup and it changed to flavor and color

Very flavorful and filling! If you make this as directed, as most reviewers don't, you'll find that 5 minutes on medium-high heat is just about right for slightly browning and softening the squash. It will cook more when you add it to the risotto at the end. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think this was lacking due to the vegetable stock. Risotto is always a little time consuming, but worth it!

This was GREAT! Really rich and tasty. I was only cooking for two, so I adjusted the ratios (and added a bit of butter and a splash of white wine), as follows: 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 small butternut squash (I made my 'cubes' very small so it didn't take forever to fry--way more than 5 min, tho!), 1 knob of butter (which I added with the leek and thyme instead of the extra olive oil), 1 leek (halved lengthwise then very finely sliced), Hearty pinch of thyme (all I had), 1 cup arborio rice, 100ml splash of white wine (which I cooked off before I started adding stock), 1 litre vegetable stock, 1 tbsp chopped basil (all I had), parmesan and seasoning to taste! Was plenty for two with leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Yum! :)

I agree with the reviewer before me. The squash definitely needs more than 5 minutes to get soft. Plus, I live at high elevation in Colorado, so everything takes longer. Other than having to adjust cooking times for elevation, it was great!

I made this last year a few times and we loved it. I just made it again this fall and I still love it. The only caveat I found is that 5 minutes is not enough time to cook the squash to al-dente, you either have to cube the squash very small or saute it longer. I use the vegetable broth from Natures Best (stop & Shop Organic) and it is delicious. This risotto is going on my regular menu rotation.

Made this recipe with chicken broth and acorn squash, because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again!

Made the recipe as outlined in the recipe, except for using less cheese to make it healthier. It was still creamy and delicious. Would definitely make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I threw a leftover scallion in with the leeks. It was amazing! As I was making it, I wasn't sure it was going to be worth all the work (I get tired of the stirring and stirring and stirring...), but wow! It was delicious, and my husband was seriously impressed. Probably one of the best things I've ever made!

Excellent recipe as is but I agree it is better with chicken stock, however, this worked well for my vegetarian friends. The majority of reviewers who complain should consider adding salt and pepper to taste, which the recipe does not state, for all the commercial palates opining on this recipe: IT IS A SACRILEGE TO USE GARLIC WHEN EMPLOYING LEEKS, it negates the delicate flavour of the leeks. I blame chain restaurants who need to please the masses. Excellent and sophisticated dish.

Fantastic texture, beautiful combination of flavours and nice subtle notes of every ingredient coming through without any one of them being overpowering - would highly recommend; easily halved recipe and would recommend having stock in a pot hot and ready to go! Enjoy!

The combination of butternut squash, leeks and basil added fabulous flavors to the risotto recipe. Everyone that ate it had seconds if not thirds, but I personally felt that this dish was lacking a little of the pizzaz that I'm used to when cooking though. If I were to cook this again, I would substitute the vegetable stock with chicken (make sure to have the stock already hot before adding to rice mixture), more leeks, and possibly some lemon juice + peel. Overall though, great recipe!

We really loved it. Minor modifications: cut in half (only two people), less basil (didn't have a lot on hand), added a splash of lemon juice, added lots of extra leek, and a tiny drizzle of truffle oil. I also roasted the squash with oil and salt. It was super tasty and we intend to make it again.

Ever notice how people who review a recipe negatively, rarely employ a review of their own cooking skills? Or quality of ingredients used? My question is did they use the first cup of wine for the recipe or the last? I crumbled a little crisped prosciutto on top before serving.

My first attempt at risotto and, other than being a bit tedious, was easy and delicious. I love the flavor or roasted butternut squash so, like many other reviewers, I went that route and subbed a touch of sage for the basil when I found that my store was sold out! To please the hubby, I added some bacon to make the dish a bit more savory, and it turned out to be a nice touch.

Excellent recipe--if you are new to risotto be prepared to face the tedium of watching broth slowly dissolve in rice cup by cup. Aside from that, do add salt and pepper to taste (I'm surprised it was not mentioned in the recipe). I used garlic salt for additional flavor, and drizzled it lightly with truffle oil to increase the richness.

LOVED this! And my gourmet cook mother loved it. Baked cubed squash instead of cooked in pan. Didn't have leeks, so used green onion. Sooo yummy!!!

This recipe was my first attempt at risotto, it's tedious to constantly watch and stir the pot, but easy. I didn't have basil, but added shrimp & extra parm cheese. It turned out great and was even better as leftovers for lunch.

I used chicken broth and white wine, swapped the sage for the basil, and roasted the squash and I still found this dish lacking in a richness of flavor.

I also wasn't sure about the basil/butternut combo but decided to try it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. We used purple basil b/c it was all they had at the supermarket, and it also added a nice color. But the flavor combo with the leeks/thyme/squash and basil actually had something reminiscent of what sage offers so it really works! I might use slightly less cheese next time even though I usually like a lot of cheese - this was a bit much. Altogether delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe that my husband and I loved! As much as I like fresh basil, it seemed odd combined with the butternut and so I swapped it out for fresh sage. Would definitely make again.

This was the first time making this recipe and as such, I followed it to the letter. The result was extrememly good. I thought the combination of the basil and squash superb. I was concerned that the vegatable broth would result in a bland flavor (as I am a fan of traditional meat broth based risotto). It was an unfounded worry. I did not find this recipe "...lacking flavor..." at all as has been alleged. Definately will make it again before the weather warms up.

Absolutely delicious. It tastes just like restaurant food! The 3 leeks just melt into the risotto... awesome with a big glass of wine, too. I even messed up the directions and didn't add the squash until the end and it was STILL good. Herby and rich but not too rich. It's amazing there's no cream in this. It would be great with a salad or some fresh bread to break up the flavors. My roommate asked for the recipe and my boyfriend ate all of the leftovers the next day. Highly recommended!

This recipe was really pretty mediocre. Followed it exactly, but it didn't have much flavor. Definitely had to add extra parmesan. Also added feta, which helped. But I wouldn't make it again--there are better recipes out there.

My first time making risotto and it turned out great, so i can bet the praise rests on the recipe. Added some baby bellas for a nice rustic flavor. Also, I toasted some of the basil leaves over high heat (no oil) until nice and crispy...made for a great garnish.

I took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and replaced the basil with sage and wished I hadn't. The sage was really overpowering. Otherwise, it was a really good risotto and I would make it again, with basil.

Great risotto. Like other reviewers, I roasted the squash and used white wine in place of some of the broth. Also used a combo of leeks and shallots and added a couple of cloves of garlic. Very nice winter dinner with a crisp green salad and a bottle of wine.

oh my goodness! It was wonderful. I loved the flavors. I roasted the squash like others did as well. Next time, I'm going to try using half white wine and half stock.

Eh not great, I wish this had more flavor - maybe chicken stock rather than the veggie broth would have helped? I swapped out the basil for the sage, as suggested, and that did go well with the other flavors, but I was still missing that good base flavor.

Great Vegetarian option for large family meals! I used veggie stock instead of broth and it intensified the flavor a lot, next time I'll use some white wine like others suggested. I also couldn't find basil at the market, so I just omitted, and I hardly missed it! A good find for gluten-free eaters as well.

With help from reviewers below I made this last night and it was a hit with everyone at dinner. My changes... Roasted the cubed squash with olive oil/s/p on 400 for about 40 minutes. Added 2 shallots and 2 cloves minced garlic to the leeks and thyme. Used organic chicken broth since it is what I had on hand and a nice chardonnay. About 25% of liquid used was wine. Used about 1/3 cup cheese since that was all I had. Delicious!!

A great dish. It was definitely heavy, maybe too heavy for a main dish (I found my mind wandering to ingredients that might lighten it up just a smidgen), but it would work wonderfully as a side. A couple small changes: I used chicken stock (because boyfriend read the grocery list incorrectly) and replaced 3/4 of a cup of stock with white wine. I also roasted the squash as suggested by NataliaSw, but at 500 degrees F. I think keeping the squash pieces small (mine were probably slightly smaller than 1/2 inch) helped a lot.

I've made this dish twice now, its very satisfying but it lacks a little flavor. Second time around I roasted the butternut squash at 400 degrees while I prepared the risotto which my boyfriend and I felt created a better texture. Also, I added 2-3 thinly sliced shallots along with the leeks, which added some flavor that it initially lacked. And since I didn't have any dry white wine on hand the second time I used a marsala cooking wine which also enhanced the flavor. And lastly I substituted freshly chopped sage instead of the basil which produced an earthy flavor and paired beautifully with the squash. Overall a very tasty and filling dish so come hungry!

My family liked this dish. I liked the individual flavors. For me, however, the combination of creamy risotto and butternut squash was too heavy for one dish. My husband said "It's a great winter meal." I say, "Eh."

This was very tasty but the squash was not cooked to a tender state with the times given. I tried to make up for this by more cooking time in the risotto. Next time I will cook the squash much longer adding a small amt water

Fantastic! Great dish for the season. Fits perfectly, tastes like winter. Followed recipe almost to the letter. Used chicken bouillon cube disolved in water for broth and 2 cups only of leeks (4 leeks total...seemed like plenty to me). 2 1/4 lbs squashed yielded much more than 4 cups. My mom could not stop commenting on on how good it was.

Perfect winter choice. I made it for a fairly large family gathering and it was a hit! It's already been requested for Christmas dinner.
