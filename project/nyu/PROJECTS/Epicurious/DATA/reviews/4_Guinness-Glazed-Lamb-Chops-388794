Delicious! The glaze is sweeter than I expected and I was a bit worried that it would overpower the meat, but it actually complimented the taste of the lamb perfectly. The only change I made was using ground coriander instead of crushing the seeds myself and as a result I didn't have to strain the glaze. Big fan of making the process easier. All in all, a very easy, delicious recipe that I'll be making again (maybe trying it with pork?).

The glaze was reduced over low heat. It made a nice thick glaze. Found a beautiful farmer market leg of lamb, which I made kebabs. Cook over hardwood charcoal, brush with glaze at end of cooking time. Served with calcannon

Delicious. found a great price on some shoulder blade chops and found this recipe. Served with leek and potato puree and swiss chard. The sauce paired well with the veg as well. For those who felt it was too bitter or did not achieve a syrupy-glaze, be sure to reduce at a high temp. The finished product should not be a thick glaze.

With a quality piece of meat, these are restaurant worthy! Definitely recommended!

Really tasty. I only had ground coriander and pepper, so I put those in and didn't have to strain the glaze at all. I also over reduced the glaze a bit so that it was way too thick. But, once it got scooped onto the warm lamb chop it melted into the meat. Used high quality farmer's market lamb, which made it all the better. I will be making this again.

Really don't understand all the great reviews. I have been using Guinness in stews for over 20 years, so I was excited to try this recipe. Like other reviewers, it did not reduce to a syrup and it was way too bitter. It only took away from the flavor of the chops. Instead of using the reserved glaze, I made a gravy and add a small amount of the glaze. Even that wasn't good. Very disappointed. Only good point was that it was very easy, so I didn't waste a lot of time

I made this on the night before St. Patrick's day and will be making it again for a small family gathering on Easter. DELICIOUS and so so easy! I served it with a parsnip puree and roasted (until crispy) Brussels sprouts. Yum.

Glaze was AWESOME!! I actually forgot to strain it before I served it, but it was fine, albeit a bit crunchy. Would also be good on pork.

Made this last night -- will become one of my "go to" recipes for a quick after work meal. Made everything as printed (scaled down for 2 people, 3 chops apiece, but made the same amount of sauce). My broiler, too, is not reliable, so I pan seared for 2 min, flipped, and put into a 400 oven for another 2 min (internal temp 115, pulled and rested). Add roasted red potatoes and a green salad, dinner in under :45. NICE. Oh yeah -- flavor was AMAZING. Plenty of 'saltiness' from the salt on the chops prior to cooking.

This was excellent and not difficult. The cut I used was "Lamb Loin T-bone Chops". The glaze boiled down to the right quantity, but I would not have called it "syrupy". I may have heated it at more of a simmer than a boil which could be the problem, but the taste was still very good and it really brought out the flavor of the lamb.

First, I am not a fan of Guinness beer as a beverage. I'm more of a Pilsner beer fan. However, I couldn't resist trying this glaze, as I recently made a stew with a stout, and loved the depth of flavor it imparted. With that said, I used pork chops (bone-in) only because my husband isn't a fan of lamb (which I am). The glaze reduced beautifully...thicky and syrupy. The flavor had a surprise OMG factor-- a little sweet with more of a molasses flavor. Excellent!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but this is for lenguamor. There's no salt listed in the Ingredients, but there is a 1/4 teaspoon salt listed in the Prep area.

Why no salt? Is this a diet recipe?

Ha! First to review. Well, this an surely an honor. I would give a 4 for flavor but you need 18 lambs chops for 6 people. Simple divison folks, 3 per person and even that was kind of skimpy. Serving 2 may work for an appetizer but not for an entree. I served it with a hearty polenta and some brussel sprout. The glaze is really nice, it's sweet so serve with something savory. My broiler is electric so I really didn't get any char on the chops either. I would probably recommend grilling or a quick pan fry or maybe moving closer to the broiler, still everyone liked it!
