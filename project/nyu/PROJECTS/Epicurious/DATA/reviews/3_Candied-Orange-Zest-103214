Totally good as a garnish for citrus or even chocolate cakes and desserts. Drying on paper towel is a little less messy. Store on sugar with generous sugar between layers helps prevent sticking together (and aids appearance too). Keeps for months this way.

Homemade candied peel makes all the difference in stollen and panettone. I use the same directions to make lemon peel as well.

I prepared this and gave it as small hostess gifts. Along with the complements, I received several requests for the recipe! It has been e-mailed to several of my friends for their enjoyment.

Too time consuming and the flavor was not as bold as I would have liked. I make mine in a simpler way and the flavor remains full. Peel orange in large sections, remove all white matter, julienne, then shake in a plastic bag with sugar. Place coated orange rind on a silpat and bake in oven on low, stirring it around a little every 10 min. Usually done in an hour or so. I have done it this way for years and it tastes wonderful in so many recipes calling for zest!!! It also keeps for months if in an airtight container.

The orange zest came out too bitter, and I put a bit more sugar than the recipe called for. It took a long time for the syrup to cool on the orange peel, and after it cooled, the orange zest was sticky. Overall, it was too time consuming, and not enough good taste to make it again.
