I wasn't impressed...the topping is bland...too much chicken broth, needs something to liven it up. My dinner guest liked it, but I didn't care for it.

Too much vinegar and bland tasting. Had to add sugar to overcome vinegar and a little dijon mustard.

This was an easy and tasty weeknight dinner. I browned some inch thick boneless chops in the pan, then took them out and added the onion and pepper, which I didn't bother roasting. Softened the veggies a bit and then added back the chops and a sprig of rosemary, covered and simmered for about 10 minutes. Then took out the chops and made the sauce, put them back to rewarm a bit. The sauce is delicious. Will definitely make this again when I have some peppers to use up.

Not wanting to fire up the grill for this(and using boneless pork chops), I seared them in the pan, put them aside, then went on with the onion saute in the same pan. The fond from the chops gave this another flavor level. Then after broth added-put the chops back in the pan til done. This was very good-served over hot, soft polenta. Yum.

I'd give this a three and a half fork rating if I could. I used fresh homemade red pepper paste that my father in law had preserved. It made it much more saucy, but was delicious. I almost omitted the wine, but was glad in the end to have added it. It gave loads of flavour. I would definately make this again, next time with boneless chops.

i halved this for just me and my hubby. i used half a red onion and an orange bell pepper. i'm not a person that just loves bbq. i even put off making this for about a week since i didn't really want it. i sure was suprised last night, i loved this. had with the macaroni and blue cheese w/chives.

Excellent! Would definitely make this again. Quick, easy and very flavourful! Made it exactly as the recipe called for, except that I used boneless chops and I used fresh roasted red peppers from the deli (I was feeling lazy). Served it with fresh green beans and a salad. Wonderful! Just as good the next day for lunch, too!!

I mistakenly added white wine vinegar instead of the apple cider vinegar - I don't know if this contributed to the vinegary taste or not but adding sugar helped. Our children really love 'smothered' so I will try this again definitely cutting amount of vinegar (apple or otherwise) in half.

Like it, don't love it. I made the recipe exactly at written, lacks flavor and the chops are just grilled....

I read the reviews prior to making this dish. Unfortunetly, I did delete the wine and increase the capers. The sauce ended up being to sour. Keep the wine. The caper amount is to your taste.

Didn't like this really and won't make again. nothing special and a little too tangy.

I made this for dinner last night. The boyfriend RAVED, but I just thought it was ok. I loved the pork chops, but the sauce was a bit oniony for my taste. He, on the other hand, could not keep his hands away from the sauce before the chops were even finished cooking! I'll def make it again because it's so easy and quick and he loved it, but I really didn't think it was spectacular.

I used roasted red pepper from a jar which made this recipe easier; plus I greatly increased the capers; not sure if the small amount of wine made any difference - would probably next time delete it and increase the vinegar.

FANTASTIC! I used our home grown sweet onions and farm stand peppers and the results couldn't have been better. Only addition we made was to add some soaked hickory chunks to the fire to add an extra dimension to the pork chops. For side dishes think mashed potatoes or grilled polenta - YUM!

Wow, a nice, flavorful sauce! May try it with boneless pork next time,(personal preference) but there will be a next time.

My husband (who is usually the chef), was stuck in traffic so dinner was up to me tonight! I thought I'd try this recipe, as I had all the ingredients on hand, and it could be made fairly quickly. Dinner was great! I did toss in a sprig of fresh rosemary from my garden at the end, just to infuse it's essence in the sauce, which I think helped make the dish. My husband and I both agreed we would definitely make this again! A great, quick recipe to make during the work week!

Very good -- all my favorite things! Super easy week night meal. Served with a couple of vegetables on the side (avoiding the starches as well), and it was excellent.

My family is on a low-carb diet and I am always on the lookout for new ways to prepare pork. This was a hit with the entire family, even the picky 17 year old daughter who isn't on the diet and everyone wants to have it again

Made this last night with thick boneless chops. The sauce is superb -- vigorous, complex flavors. Will definitely do again for guests that we want to surprise a little.

We really enjoyed this. It was easy and I served it over orzo to mop up the yummy sauce. I also tried it with veal chops - delicious too
