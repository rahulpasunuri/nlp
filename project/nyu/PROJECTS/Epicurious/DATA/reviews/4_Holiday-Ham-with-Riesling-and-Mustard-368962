I made this recipe exactly as shown for new years and my family said it was the BEST ham I've ever made, as well as the best ham they've ever tasted! This is why I gave it the highest rating. I'm making this tomorrow for Easter and I know it will be given raves again. I did not serve the juices with the ham, instead saved it along with the leftover meaty bone for a country calico bean soup, which also was really yummy! One big reason I love baked hams with bone-in!

Hands down the best ham I have ever eaten. I had a small ham, so halved the recipe and it was fantastic. Super moist leftovers; it's worth a try even if you have a recipe you traditionally use.

Wow this ham was so good! We used a very nice quality ham from the pork store and combined with this recipe it was so good. I used an 8lb ham but made the whole sauce for the ham and just used the rest to pass at the table. I didn't bother putting the shallots in the food processor (my processor in the dishwasher) and it tasted great.

Best ham recipe ever and I've made a lot of hams! Followed exactly except used 1/2 ham and reduced baking time. A big difference I think is that the ham is not overcooked and the rind is removed so the basting gets into the ham. I did not serve juices w/ham. Used juices make ham broth for bean or pea soup. I put ham bones, fat, and assorted vegetables in crock pot overnight, strain, cool, remove fat and then proceed to make soup.

This is the best ham recipe I've ever made..I've made others from Food Network chefs but this is by far the the best.The method is different with the water and wine steaming over the ham while it's baking. I used a 10lb Smithfield bone-in. Next time I'll cut the shallot and mustard topping in half. Didn't have Auslese but used Pinot Grigio instead. It took 3 1/2 hrs for it be completely done.

My first time cooking a ham and this turned out perfectly. I basted every 15-20 minutes and I think that helped. The mustard glaze was excellent. I will make this again. I found the broth was a little too watery when I went to serve it so I reduced some with an additional cup or so of wine. Next time I will thicken it with a bit of butter/flour mixtures, too. Delicious!

This ham was fantastic. The flavor was great and it was super moist. It puts those spiral hams to shame.

Even though the half ham I ordered turned out to be a fully cooked one, this prep is a winner. I just heated the ham with the Riesling broth and then finished with the Riesling/mustard mixture as directed. It's one of the most moist and flavorful hams we've had in years (no more spiral cuts for me). Can't wait to use the bone and leftover pan juices for split pea soup!!!

Instead of Riesling We use sautern wine mixed with a little bit of chardonnay because it was we have in hand

The most delicious ham I've ever tasted. I didn't have shallots so I just used onion. The Riesling mixture gave this ham a mild, unique, and divine flavor. It's perfect for the holidays and fairly easy to make. Don't hesitate to make this for your next party. It'll be a hit!
