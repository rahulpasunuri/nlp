This was delicious and not to hard to make if you like grilling and I do. Myh 9 yr old picky eater even liked it.

Wrap the brick/bricks in aluminum foil! The breast meat is denser because of the weight of the brick/bricks...Yum...

This is a tasty dish. However, it's a pretty stingy cook who would serve 8 guests with one 3 1/2 lb. chicken. I added the juice of 1 lime to the marinade. Having cooked many a chicken under bricks, I think it will take more than tongs to remove the hot bricks; wear heavy grilling gloves and carefully remove the bricks by hand.
