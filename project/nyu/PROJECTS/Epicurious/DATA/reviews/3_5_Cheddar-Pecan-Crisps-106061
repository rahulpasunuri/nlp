I mixed this in my food processor. I used half rye flour because I had some from a mill I visited, thought it might be good. Accidentally added whole egg (that's what I get for talking and baking). They are crisp chewy and I think the cayenne is a good amount. Just enough kick. Trying it with walnuts and blue cheese just for a lark. We'll see how that goes.

I don't see anyone else reporting this problem so I guess it's not the recipe but operator error: Mine were all inconsistent: some baked flat and crispy; some were more like a cookie - held their shape and were less crunchy. But they tasted good. I used harissa instead of cayenne.

I basically followed the recipe, making sure I creamed the butter and cheese together real well as an earlier post suggested. Didn't use all the cayenne but wished I had. Did anyone else end up with very lacy edges, so fragile they left crumbs everywhere? Any suggestions would be welcome.

This is a lesson in how NOT to make these delicious savory cookies. Do not roll the dough into logs and freeze them before you bake them. I did this 2 days ahead and upon baking, they crumbled into tiny pieces. A total failure on my part, but since I didn't exactly follow the recipe, I cant rate it correctly. I will use the crumbs for topping salads.

these were great. a little spicy, but still good. I used a food processor and pulsed all the ingredients until it formed a ball.

A real crowd pleaser. I didn't have pecans so I used almonds instead and they worked fine. For those having trouble shaping them, follow the advice of the previous reviewer - make the dough, shape into logs about 1-1/2" in diameter on plastic wrap and put in the freezer for about an hour (or weeks if you like to work ahead). Slice into 1/4" rounds and bake 1" apart. No trouble with spreading. Freezing the dough also helps the gluten settle down.

These were great. Pefect kick with the cayenne pepper. I used a bit less butter and mixed everything using a fork rather than using a mixer. Worked great! Will definitely make again!

I made a cracker almost just like this several years ago, and it was very good. Using this recipe, I made a couple of batches. They were swimming in fat from the butter and the cheese. I pulled out my old recipe, and it was different. It calls for 8 oz of cheese, 1 cup butter, just like this one, but calls for 2 1/2 cups of flour, rather than the comparatively small amount of 2/3 cup. They are more crumbly, but stick together well enough to form into the crackers. And they turn out much better. My recipe is for "Rio Grande Crackers." I'll use that one from now on.

Great recipe. Cut back the butter. The batter does stick to the beaters, but eventually comes off. Makes perfect present for neighbors, etc., and much better than most cheddar crisps. Amazingly layered and puffy.

These have been fabulous! After reading the reviews I lightly Pam my cookie tray and fine-ground a few more pecans than the recipe calls for. My fouth batch are cooking now and I have had several people I have given these to ask for the recipe. Great for snacks and gift-giving and the recipe is forever memorized.

Cheesy and crispy, yes. BUT, floury and greasy as well. I cut the amount of cayenne in half and it was still almost too much. Flavor of pecans did not come through even on second day. Bottom line - a waste of time.

These are delicious (and addictive), with one major caveat: I was surprised that no one else thought that the amount of cayenne was too much for a savory hors d'ouevre. It was such a pronounced flavor on first tasting that I thought the name of the recipe should be changed to include the word "peppery." Half of my dinner guests wouldn't eat more than one because of the amount of heat. I like the kick that the pepper gives, but next time I'll reduce the amount by half when serving to mixed company. I did increase the flour to 3/4 cup as others suggested and used baking spray rather than butter for the sheets. I found that the batter was relatively easy to work and the crisps were still tender.

These were delicious but frustrating to make. The butter/cheese mix kept sticking to the beaters and had to be scraped off repeatedly and unsatisfactorily. Flattening the dough was frustrating as well because it stuck to the fork. I did add a little more flour to remedy the problem - but any more flour would have ruined the lovely taste and consistency. I tried creaming the butter/cheese mix with a fork initially but it still got trapped in the beaters. I'm amazed that no one else has complained about how hard it was to mix the dough with a mixer - and this is the second or third time I've made this recipe. Any hints? But these are so good that I will make then again and again!

It took me two tries to make but they were awsome! Hint: you have to cream the butter with the cheese so that you have a homogenous mix, if you have bits of butter and cheese then the crackers will turn out greasy and full of holes. I also processed the pecans till they were almost ground, and I formed the dough into a log chilled it and then sliced and baked. Keep extra dough in the fridge for later.

I didn't rate this with the forks, since I need to try it again. It sounds like it's supposed to be amazing, but I was very disappointed with mine. They were quite fragile, and didn't hold together very well, and someone stated that they spread quite a bit. Mine stayed right where they were. I would take the recommendation that says to watch that you don't overdo it--I found any sort of browning (even tannish) on the bottom negatively effected the taste. I used three year old Wisconsin sharp cheddar, and that might've been the problem. It was too sharp for me, and I'd like to try it again with a milder cheese. Also, I'd like to actually weigh the cheese next time to be sure I have the exact amount, as opposed to relying on cup measurements. Anyway, it sounds like it's worth another shot, so I'll post a follow up sometime--I suspect so many people who like it can't be wrong, so it's worth another shot.

A great recipe to bake when hosting a party or to give away as gifts! I baked mine on parchment paper and blotted them with paper towels to make them less greasy. I also reduced the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp and added 1/2 tsp chili powder. It gives a nice bite.

This recipe probably depends a lot on the cheese you use... These were too greasy for my taste and not really an improvement over the original ingredients. Some cheese cubes and spiced pecans would have been better.

These are extremely delicious! I just made them for a wine tasting we're having tomorrow evening, and I am very pleased with the results. I used 3/4 cup of flour as suggested in a previous review and baked them on a parchment lined sheet, my awkward Swedish oven took 14 mins on convect. I did not have any problem with greasiness, they did bubble a bit in their own butter, but this just made them yummy. I made them bite sized, and the recipe yielded about 75 little dreamy bites. This is definately a keeper!

This has become a staple appetizer whenever I host a party or help cater a party. The only change I make is to use crushed red pepper instead of the cayenne powder.

Although very tasty (especially the next day), the texture of these so-called crisps were not crispy at all, but delicate and crumbly, almost sand-like. Maybe I need to add more flour next time.

This is such a quick, easy recipe to do and got rave reviews from my friends. I increased the flour to 3/4 cup and next time I will increase the cayenne for a little more zip. I was in a rush making them and forgot to put in the egg yolk and they still turned out great. Really addictive!

Yummmmmy!! I host a wine tasting party every year and these are always a hit! I double the batch (which yields a lot of crisps) and there's never any left over. They have a nice little "zing" to them, too.

This was fabulous and goes great with a glass of Cabernet! Be careful though. These little wafers are terribly addictive!

I love the flavor of these crisps but found that they are a bit too greasy for even a butter lover like me. The next time I make them I will cut the butter by 1/3-1/2 or perhaps add a bit more flour. This recipe is definitely worth refining--the flavor is excellent.

Dreadfully greasy, even with reduced butter and very little handling.

I really loved these ones! My tip is to watch carefully when baking, if they get brown they taste terrible. Take them out of the oven when they are just golden and nice.

I made these to accompany drinks. They were a huge hit. I used a blend of pecans, almonds and walnuts to make 2/3 cup because I didn't have enough enough pecans! still terrific. I will surely make these again.

To eliminate extra calories, I used silpat instead of buttering the pan. They turned out absolutely perfect and went great with pre-dinner cocktails. Both my husband and my friend loved them. I will definitely make them again.

These were delicious; they go beautifully with a glass of red wine. They are better on the second day when the flavors have melded. I agree that there is a bit too much butter. Next time, I will reduce it the amount of butter and cook on parchment paper rather than buttering the cookie sheet.

These are very delicious. I also tried using other hard cheese flavors with different spices and it worked very well. These would be great served with a soup and/or salad.

Good, though shaping them into discs took more time than I expected. Use extra-sharp Cheddar for maximum flavor. Definitely reduce the butter and salt. They were bubbling in the butter like crazy when cooking -- and while they tasted bland right out of the oven, they were too salty once they cooled.

Rating: 3
These are very good, and I would definitely make again. The only negative thing is that I found that buttering the pan like it suggests left the crisps tasting way too rich for my taste. I learned to not butter the pan and cut the butter in the recipe slightly so they are much less greasy and less overwhelmingly buttery. Excellent otherwise!

This recipe has become one of my favorites. So easy, so few ingredients, but spectacular! I grated some leftover cheddar cheese with jalapeno peppers and added it to the regular cheddar cheese, which I think gave it more of a bite. I agree, this makes a wonderful hostess gift, especially around the holidays. A great cocktail munchie..

This recipe was a hit on 4th of July and at a Ravinia picnic. They go great with a glass of wine. I added some fresh sage to a few and they were good too. The recipe is simple, good and makes the kitchen smell great. Theses will be included at my future parties!

Not the most attractive item, but nicely spicy. Would recommend serving with a spread of some kind.

These were crazy-can't-stop-eating-them-good--just like Jo's Pecan Wafers but faster and easier to make. I made them for a fundraiser and they were a huge hit. Next time I'd make them slightly smaller, silver-dollar-sized--the smaller ones were crisper and browner and would make good cocktail nibbles.

Ohmigosh!! These little cheddar crisps are sensational!! I made them to take as a little hostess gift (I'm tired of taking a bottle of wine) and barely rescued them from my husband. I am not sure you need to butter the cookie sheets as they bubble in their butter. And, for what it's worth, I also made the Spiced Pecans (Bon Appetit, December 1990) to take along, and found another winner!! TWO "keeper" recipes....!!!!

I served these as an appetizer and they went fast. Very yummy. Great cheddar flavor - added a bit more cayenne. Definitely make again.

These are just like the ones my mother used to make in South Carolina when I was a little girl. These are so easy to make (I threw them together with a KitchenAid mixer) and they are addicting. The perfect amount of cayenne - I wouldn't change a thing!
