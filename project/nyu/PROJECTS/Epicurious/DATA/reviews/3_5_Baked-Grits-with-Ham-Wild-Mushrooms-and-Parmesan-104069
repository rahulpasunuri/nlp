I omitted the mushrooms and added the ham/shallot saute to the grits mixture before baking. Also, I added an egg to help the grits set up - take it from an Alabama girl: one egg is not enough for this quantity grits. Baked the whole thing, dished it out with green beans and fried cabbage for a Saturday night dinner. Heaven!

We love grits and are always looking for "the best" shrimp and grits recipe. But this wonderful albeit simple blend of mushrooms, shallots and ham was the best grits recipe yet! I used about two-thirds oyster mushrooms and one-third shitake, both fresh. I also used yellow grits, which helped the overall color. My grits didn't set up in the water bath either, so I served them in a soup bowl with the mushroom mixture over, topped with additional parmesan. The next day, however, the leftover grits had set up like polenta. I guess it just took the grits some time to absorb the liquid. Fantastic flavor!

I used grits instead of polenta. My man looked a little unsure, but after trying it went back for seconds! He even suggested we replace our grits and shrimp recipe with this one for our famous New Years Day Brunch!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I do not have wine so I used chicken bullion,I also added green bell pepper.I had to cut the recipe in third as it would have been too much for two older people.I will be making this again.

One word: Yuck. The flavors were an odd combination and it was completely unappealing to the eye. I followed the recipe exactly. I usually love all polenta dishes but this one is out of my recipe box for good.

Absolutely delicious! Very simple to make. I left out the ham and still delicious.

I have made this dish several times and it always turns out great. The wild mushrooms are key. I travel to the south and have not tasted anything quite this good...this recipe is in my recipe box.

I give 3 because I made adjustments that contributed to my not caring for the dish, but I do think that the dish has tremendous potential. I added some dried mushrooms to the dish that made it muddy looking and tasting. I also added shrimp as per some other reviewer recommendations and I didn't think it added to the overall taste, as it was a weird combination of flavors that didn't meld well. I did like the ham, mushroom, polenta possibilities though and will attempt it again. I also think it could be a little saucier so will probably add some stock to the reduction next time before adding the cream.

I am a recent transplant from Birmingham and this incredible dish, hands down, is the one thing I miss the most about the city. It takes Southern comfort food to all different levels. Thank you so much for finding this recipe!!!

Impressive dish...we loved this recipe! I added sauted shrimp to the mushrooms and served with a mixed green salad in walnut vinagrette. Such a great combination of flavors. Can't wait to make this for guests!

The flavor was great! I used asiago cheese rather than the parm. Yum. Also, I wish I had read all of the comments instead of the first few because I did the water bath and the grits didn't set up so I had to cook them without it for another 1/2 hour. Also, it is too hard to get the dish out of the water bath.

This was an absolute hit! It was so amazing that I made this recipe two days in a row. I added shrimp to this recipe and that made the difference. I am excited about having a dish that everyone of my guests couldn't stop talking about. This was better than Wishbone.

This is a wonderful recipe but there really is no substitute for the real grits. Textue is a very important part of the whole eating experinece.

This dish definately has a wide range of flavors. I used procuitto instead of regular ham and it was an amazing flavor with the mushrooms and wine.

This recipe was great for a number of reasons. First, the mushroom mixture. I made the recipe and served with the baked grits; however, the mushrooms would be great over noodles, rice, and almost any other starch. And, they are so simple to make. Even can make them vegetarian with little difficulty or compromise in flavor. I made the grits but did not use the water bath. I think they turned out just fine. I would agree with other reviewers to up to amount of mushroom mixture to make 6 ample servings.

Delicious, next time I would double the mushrooms. Not sure if I undercooked the grits before I baked them or if some of the waterbath ended up in the dish, but the grits were runny. I ended up putting them back in a saucepan and cooking them for an additional 15 min. I would definitely skip the waterbath next time.

Grits and polenta are close to the same thing, but please, if you can get them where you are, go for real grits. They have a different texture and work a lot better in this dish. Plus, grits are cheaper.

Good...but I think I like it better on rice. I still think "hoppin John" is a better recipe

I try to eat "veggie" as often as I can so I left out the ham and the overall dish did not suffer at all.Way yummy!

Outstanding. I used a half-water-half-milk, and bit less than called for, for more firmness since I was taking this to a chic potluck. Added some Gorgonzola on top. Used half reconsitituded dried wild mushrooms, half regular white mushrooms, for economy. Huge hit. My reputation, already great (thanks to Epicurious), was enhanced.

I can't believe I found this recipe! I was just thinking about how great it was the last time I had it, and thought I'd try to find it. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!!!

My husband and I love this dish and it has become a favorite use of leftover ham. I definately recomend doubling the sauce but leaving the polenta the same. It worked better for me not to cook the polenta in the water bath.

An awesome meld of flavors. As a main course along with a salad, the four cups of mushrooms weren't enough for 6 people, I would double the amount. (The polenta was the right amount)I used 3/4 fresh chanterelles and 1/4 shitakes. This will become a family favorite, simply delish.
