Re my previous review, sorry about my so-called "change" #1. I realized (too late) that the ingredients I said I substituted are actually what's called for in the recipe. I guess I was thinking "cordon bleu = ham and swiss" and forgot where I got the idea for proscuitto and gruyere. Again, sorry for the confusion! But my #2 change is still (very) accurate.

I made these pretty much according to the recipe with a couple of important changes. (1) Instead of ham and swiss, I used proscuitto and gruyere; and (2) although I deep-fried them per the recipe, there is no way that could possibly cook them enough. Therefore, after deep-frying, I baked them for about 20 minutes in a 350-degree oven. With these two changes (esp. the latter), they were very good.

As one other reviewer did, I browned the chicken and then baked. Perhaps deep frying is essential to making this dish spectacular, but I just can't deep fry (anything). It was good, but not anything special.

I would have given this 4 forks, but I changed up the recipe a bit. I used Virginia ham by Boar's Head sliced very thin. (I couldn't find uncooked ham, even in our gourmet grocery store.) I also added chopped basil to the filling before rolling the breasts which was excellent. I mixed in panko breadcrumbs with Italian seasoned bread crumbs which crisps up the coating a bit. Rather than deep frying, I browned the rolled breasts on all sides (1-2 mins per side) in a little olive oil in a frying pan, then baked at 325 for 15 minutes. It was moist but cooked through and delicious. I also topped the meat with a Hollandaise sauce which was perfect.
