I thought that the dressing was a bit bland, but it did go pretty well with the apples. If I make this again, I might try using balsalmic vinegar. Also, I would suggest using extra virgin olive oil. I don't know why you would put vegetable oil in a dressing.

Made this exactly as written, with the addition of roasted baby beets to the salad. A great beginning to a nice fall dinner party.

Really good dressing. Kind of a modern waldorf with the apples and nuts. Made a delicious main dish lunch salad.

This is one of my standby recipes; everyone always loves it. Depending on availability, I have substituted apple juice for the cider and it works fine as well. Often don't add the nuts in case of allergy concerns and it doesn't suffer for it.

Delicious, but trimming all that watercress is a real pain. Will substitute chicory or some other bitter salad green next time.

Made this last night at an experimental dinner - everybody loved it. I also crumbled a little stilton on top. Not only highly edible, but easy to make beautiful.

Spectacular! A terrific treat made with seasonal local apples. Last week I used Macombs and this week Northern Spies, both crisp, tart and not too sweet. Drawing on another recipe from this site, I crumbled in some Stilton. I went with walnuts rather than almonds and, having comsumed the last of the apple cider, I subbed cherry cider for it. Bottom line; many ways to vary this wonderful theme.

This salad was REALLY good! I made it for Christmas diner and everyone cleaned their plate. Changes: I used a Fuji apple, didn't include endive, and crumbled a creamy Stilton on top. Will definitely make again.

Instead of watercress, I used sunflower sprouts. I also added crumbled roquefort cheese. The dressing is lovely; I didn't have cider, so I added a bit of sugar.
