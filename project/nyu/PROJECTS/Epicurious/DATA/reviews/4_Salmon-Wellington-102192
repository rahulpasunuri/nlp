The basic recipe is amazing - simple elegant and delicious. I found the sauce to be fussy and less then optimal but rather served the fish with a dilled mustard sauce and tender lettuce salad with a white balsamic vinaigrette. Yum!!

These flavours were amazing together. I thought the sauce seemed too buttery, so I followed another reviewer, cut the butter to 2 tbsp and added 1/4 cup heavy cream. Also a little flour too thicken it up as it was really runny. Will try again with spinach and boursin as many others suggested.

I've read all the variations from reviewers, but I recommend if this is your first time with this recipe, follow it to the letter. Stunning flavor and presentation.

ok I gave this one four forks but mostly for the great suggestions from many of the reviews! I needed a vegetarian portion to go along with the traditional beef version (used the Individual Emeril one from the Food Network). Basically made a "duxelle" like mixture of spinach & garlic sautéed in a bit of butter with some feta. Baked in the same amount of time as the beef versions and was the perfect doneness!

This is a great recipe. It was really easy and yet so impressive for guests. I sauteed the scallops in some butter for both inside and the sauce and it turned out great. I also prepared them ahead of time and kept them in the fridge and they were perfectly cooked after 20 min. My guests raved! I served them with green beans and the scalloped potatoes with fennel and it was an amazing dinner.

Great recipe! I added some spinach on top of the salmon before enclosing in the pastry. Very tasty!

This is delicious and easy to make, but presents as a very fancy dish! Perfect for special occasions. I warpped the fillets about 2 hours before I baked them and kept in the fridge and they turned out perfect. I did not make the sauce-I served it with a champagne buerre blanc instead-very good!

I added mayo and shrimps to this recipe. The mayo helps keep the fish moist and the shrimps added sweetness. The sauce is a must. The acidity in the sauce cuts the richness of the fish making it more balanced in taste. I paired this main with scalloped potatoes and fennel. I found out that tarragon and fennel are good friends, the licorice flavors echos. The 2 dishes compliments each other beautifully.

I have made this recipe several times and LOVE it. I also used Boursin cheese and spinach and mixed in some chopped tarragon. As for the sauce, I have tried the sauce in the recipe but just find that it's too much butter! A nice refreshing change is just to use yogurt, mixed with some chopped tarragon and lemon juice.

Presentation was great. Be sure to put the shitake mushrooms underneath when wrapping so they're on top when you flip it over. I used Dufour puff pastry (had to cut it in half and roll it fairly thin because only one sheet comes in a package) from Whole Foods and it took more like 45min to brown. Of course, the fish was overcooked. I froze two of them for the next day and thawed it out a few hours to let the pastry thaw out and when cooked 45min, the fish was cooked properly. The cooking time probably varies a lot depending on what you use for puff pastry. I also cut the tarragon in half and found it a good amount that didn't overpower the fish. Left the vinegar out of the sauce and increased wine to one cup. Making smaller salmon wellingtons would be better because they're pretty filling w/ the puff pastry...I'd make it again next time and cut the fillets slices in half cross-wise to make them more square.

I made three versions of this salmon: 1) exactly as the recipe indicated, 2) using the recipe plus sliced shitake mushrooms, and 3) replacing the shallots with Boursin cheese and spinach cooked with leeks (per the Colorado cook). I also made two versions of the sauce: a) exactly as the recipe indicated and b) using Julia Childs recipe for Béarnaise sauce). My conclusion is that the recipe is perfect without any modification. I liked the flavor of the fresh salmon complimented by shallots in the original recipe. The addition of mushrooms was fine - I was personally indifferent to their presence. My wife (who does not enjoy fish as much as I do) very much preferred the Boursin and spinach addition. My opinion was that the Boursin resulted in a good dish but that it masked the flavor of our (expensive) fresh fish. With regard to the sauces  I was very much surprised to prefer the original recipe (for this particular dish). The ingredients are very similar to Béarnaise minus the egg yolks. The sauce was obviously not as thick as Béarnaise, but reached an appropriately thickened consistency due to the cooking down of the liquid and addition of (lots) of cold butter. The recipes sauce tasted great  with a good tanginess that was too muted when eggs were added (i.e., the Béarnaise). In summary  this recipe is perfect without modification but I understand why different palates may prefer the added richness of Boursin to the fish and/or eggs in the sauce.

Great recipe - super easy. I made this one day in advance and popped in the oven for a weeknight dinner party. Used Boursin and spinach as the filling and it turned out wonderful. Just make sure to squeeze ALL the water out of the spinach. Finally, score the puff pastry slightly before putting into the oven for a beautiful presentation.

I made this for the second time for Easter dinner, and it was a big hit. I added chopped, sauteed mushrooms, which gave some additional moisture and flavor--wouldn't leave them out. I found the portions much too large: pastry-wrapped filet feeds two normal eaters. And so I had a couple left over and was delighted to find that they freeze very well. I defrosted and reheated them in the oven, and they still tasted fresh and delicious. Nice to have them on hand for an impromptu dinner!

This was easy, excellent, and impressive. We made it for Valentines day using previously frozen sockeye that was on sale,(use good fish, farmed stuff is awful, fresh or otherwise) and used some boursin under the pastry, and it was absolutely fantastic. Used basic bernaise for the sauce. Wonderful presentation, we will make it for guests soon!

This was just OK. As with other reviewers, I found the sauce had too strong a vinegar flavor, and the sauce really did not thicken up very well. I ended up adding cream cheese to thicken the sauce. Definitely not something I would make again.

I made this just as written and it was fabulous. It would be a great presentation for guests. I had the oven rack about 1/3 from the top browned nicely and the salmon was done perfectly. Don't miss out on the sauce. I can't imagine this recipe with basil.

I make this on a regular basis. Use the frozen salmon from CostCo on somewhere similar, which is really almost as good as fresh, and this is actually a really low price weekly dinner! It is always a hit, whether having friends for dinner or just me and my guy. This is an amazing recipe.

Made it for a family dinner for thirty people. Lots of prep work with the wrapping but it can be done ahead of time an is definitely worth it. Followed advice from another rview ad added boursin cheese and spinach sauteed with leeks (just make sure you press out as much liquid as possible). Served with a tarragon, saffron bernaise (did the blender version, EASIER THEN STOVETOP). Definitely follow advice on chilling before placing inthe oven and don't skimp on adding some butter to the puff pastry to get a nice warm crust on it. Served with roasted beet, fennel and orange salad (recipe online) and potato latkes with caviar. AMAZING

I made this just as described for a dinner party that included my new boss. It was impressive to serve and tasted wonderful - and relatively easy to prepare. I followed the advice of a cook about keeping the pastry cold and after putting the salmon packets together put the baking pan in the refrig for a couple of hours - making it a great prepare-ahead main dish as well.

After reading recent reviews, I made this over the weekend. I took one reviewer's suggestion of the spinach and boursin cheese additions. The flavors were excellent but the salmon was dry and very overcooked and the pastry was barely done. Very disappointing.

Rating: 4
Thanks to the cook from Cincinnati who suggested using Boursin cheese and sauteed spinach in place of the tarragon, this recipe was above and beyond delicious. I was nervous about how well-cooked the fish would be (not being able to see it), but when the pastry was browned it was perfectly done inside. I did make the tarragon butter, but used it more on the steamed asparagus than on the salmon. Definitely a recipe I will use to impress company, and I'll take any excuse I can get to justify the calorie count and make it again!

Loved this recipe! So easy and elegant! I even sent it to several friends that loved it. Only thing that I would change is to double the sauce. We liked the tart flavor. I was concerned about the tarragon because I don't normally like dried tarragon, but found the fresh tarragon made all the difference.

Scrumptious and very easy. Will definitely make again. I also found the sauce to be too vinegary, so I'll probably just use white wine next time and double the sauce as well as we didn't think there was enough.

-I have never had so many compliments on a dish! Two men said that it was the best entree they had ever eaten. I did make a few alterations to the recipe. I marinated the salmon for 20min. in a white wine, vinegar, tarragon and shallot marinade that I had reduced.(You could save some, reduce further for bearnaise sauce to save a step later). I used a 1/2 T. of Boursin cheese and covered that with sauted spinach on top instead of the tarragon. I also used a bearnaise sauce instead of the butter sauce. I shaped the puff pastry into fishes by pinching it around the salmon & cutting the end tail. Capers work well for eyes. For those that found the puff pastry greasy, make sure that it is very cold before placing it in the oven, and make sure that your oven is very hot...it should be puffed and nicely brown- (mine took 25 min.) or it will be doughy and greasy.

Dish worked wonderfully for entertaining and is a versatile dish open to interpretation. I found the sauce too vinegary, so I halfed the amount of vinegar, used 2 TB butter and a 1/4 c of cream (or fold in room temperature low fat sour cream for the more healthful version). I made 2 with dill and 2 with tarragon, guests loved both! I took small cutting of the puff pastry and put each guests initials on their pastry. Simple and REALLY IMPRESSED my guests!

I dunno. I'm from Alaska and LUUUUV salmon. When I've worked with puffed pastry before, I separated each sheet and brushed with butter which made the pastry lighter. The recipe did not indicate this so I threw it out there in a great lump and it turned out a bit dry and tough. The sauce was a bit tart (vinegary) for me, so I added some creme to sweeten it up which was great. I did not find the tarragon overpowering, but did not measure and probably used less than called for. Any suggestions on the pastry?

Wonderful presentation. Tested on my husband first before trying with company and will definitely repeat. We love tarragon, but will throttle back on the amount next time as it was a bit overpowering. Also, I halved the butter at the end to cut back on fat and calories and it was still rich and delicious. Other herbs would be fantastic, plenty of room for interpretation.

I found this recipe to be fantastic!! I am not a big salmon fan, but this dish is an exception to the rule... and will become a dish to "wow" guests. The only modification I made was to the sauce because I didn't want to use all that butter. So I simply sauteed the scallions and tarragon in a tsp of butter, then boiled and reduced a cup of wine, let cool slightly and added fat free sour cream. It was delicious and didn't compromise the flavour. Thanks Epicuriuos!!

This was fantastic. It is a very attractive and impressive dish that really wowed my guests. The flavor of the fish and pastry alone is subtle, but the sauce really compliments it perfectly. I added two tablespoons of capers to the sauce and omitted the taragon. I used only a small amount beneath the fish and a drizzle over the top because I was afraid of it being too vinegar-y, but it really made the dish. Served with a spinach and gorgonzola salad, nice white wine, and pavlova for dessert, it really made a perfect meal.

This dish is outstanding! I brushed each filet with Dijon mustard before sprinkling with the green onions. Because I did not have fresh tarragon on hand, I sprinkled only a pinch of dried tarragon on each filet. Same thing for the sauce.

Excellent recipe, this contains a lot of assembly but it's overall not too difficult. As did many of the other reviewers, I used a variation on the recipe... I filled each pastry with a dab of sour cream, dill, and shallots. My hunch is that tarragon might be a bit strong for this. One experiment I tried on a few was to leave the top open (with sour cream side up). This comes out looking very nicely, you can also cut and layer a piece of smoked salmon into the opening and then douse the whole thing with the cream sauce as indicated. I served mine dry, they turned out fine and I would recommend baking one without the sauce and trying before committing to making the sauce (or any of the 100's of good variations in the other comments). My pastry sheets were not 12"x12" so I ended up making much smaller versions of what is seen in the pictures. I used Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets and divided each into four squares. This makes each a perfect size as an appetizer. The trick to using the pastry is to keep an eye on it so that you use it when it is just warm enough to be malleable. Don't wait too long or it starts to get sticky and hard to manage. If this is your first time, you may want to buy extra in case. I didn't have time to let them defrost at room temperature so I ended up warming them a bit in the microwave, but I would only recommend this as a last resort. During assembly, make sure you seal the patry pretty well along the long side the pastry does not explode during baking, since it will try to expand somewhat.

I made this for an elegant dinner party and was very happy with the results. I may a few changes to suit my taste.I made a filling using sauteed leeks and mushrooms with cream cheese with the tarragon on the salmon before wrappng in pastry. I also used slightly smaller pieces of fish and served them as a first course. I changed the sauce as well and made an easy blender hollandaise that was AMAZING with both the fish and the pastry. OK, I basically changed the whole thing, but the idea was a great one to build on.

This is a great basic recipe and open to a lot of opportunity for change as you can see from the other reviews. I added a mushroom duxelle on top of the salmon like a beef wellington, and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper!

This was only so-so. I used Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry. The pastry performed properly it turned a nice golden color and had a flaky texture, all well and good, BUT, the salmon lacked the nice little crust you get when you broil salmon. The inner layers of the puff pastry were a little doughy and undercooked, perhaps, that can be corrected by additional baking, I am not sure. It was good but I was distinctly underwhelmed after all the 4 fork reviews.

Fabulous! I served this to a group of ten for Easter dinner, and it was a great hit. I, too, added sauteed, minced mushrooms to the packets, which was wonderful--great flavor and it helped keep things moist. The only thing I would do differently, perhaps, is to make the servings a bit smaller; these were very hearty portions!

I served this to guests for a special occassion. Got great compliments from a tough crowd. I was a bit skeptical of the sauce, but it also got great reviews. The only two things I did change, was that I was a bit short of shallots, so I added some minced mushrooms and I had to use dried tarragon instead of fresh. It still turned out beautifully, although using fresh would have brought out even more flavor. Definitely will be making it again.

This recipe is definately a keeper. It presents very elegantly and is definately open to variations in spices and sauces. I made a cream sauce and used dill, shallots, and chevre inside each packet. Also, I cut some leaves out of the puff pastry and placed them on each salmon packet and didn't cut them in thirds as suggested. This was a very beautiful presentation. I received rave reviews from all the guests. I think the reviewers who didn't give this recipe a great score perhaps need to get a little more creative and daring with changing the spices and ingrediants to their own taste.

I served this dish up for some of my college friends whose compromised cooking abilities enable them to barely boil water with terrific results.

I modified the sauce - try 4tbsp of wine vinegar and 4 tbsp of white wine - reduce w/the shallots and tarragon - using a double boiler, wisk 3 egg yolks w/the reduced liquid add some capers,the stick of melted butter and wisk until thickened, then remove from the heat.

This entree received rave reviews from my guests tonight. I didn't have enough shallots so I mixed mild white onion and minced garlicwhich I mixed with the tarragon chiffonade and light sour cream. The sauce was great. I did use white balsamic vinegar which I reduced earlier in the day and just before serving, I heated the reduction and added the butter. Absolutely superb! Accompaniments included corn custard in individual cups, tender crunchy green beans, and salad of baby greens, strawberries, Bermuda onion, toasted almond slices, and Roquefort cheese crumbles with Italian style olive oil dressing. I would definitely serve again. Not only was the salmon moist and tasty, but presentation added to meal. I served each Wellington uncut and let guests cut their own and add sauce separately.

Excellent... with some adjustments. The salmon by itself did seem like it would be too plain. I sauteed some shitake mushrooms, and then stirred in some sour cream off the heat. I mixed in the shallots, and then topped each piece of salmon with some of the mixture before wrapping. It added a great touch of extra flavor. I used cream in the sauce in lieu of the butter. I thought the flavor of the tarragon was great. This dish was a hit! Definitely a crowd pleaser!

I have made this for several dinner parties and have sent leftovers home with the guests. For those that think the dish is missing something, it is...you must add creme fraiche (store bought at Tom Thumb) inside with the shallot and fresh tarragon. The sauce makes the dish, but like a previous reviewer, I use Alessi Sweet White Balsamic Vinegar...this is key. I don't measure the tarragon, but I probably use less than what is called for. Excellent flavor and texture.

I made this recipe for a Christmas dinner for 45 people. I made them as individual wellingtons and had several requests for the recipe. It is impressive, but easy to do ahead. I will serve Bearnaise sauce with it tonight as my husband wants red wine and I thought that would "heavy" it up a bit.

This recipe was VERY disappointing! The idea was very intriguing and different, but the flavor of the salmon/shallot/tarragon was quite bland. The accompanying sauce was so sour I had to throw it away. If I ever make this again, I would definitely use more herbs and make a more flavorful sauce!

I made this recipe for the first time and I too didn't go with the tarragon sauce. When I placed the salmon on the pastry I topped off each piece with some fresh shrimp, drizzled some bernaise sauce on top and then laid a sprig of fresh dill on top just before sealing the pastry pouch. Then after cooking and just before serving I drizzled more bernaise sauce on top, but didn't cut open the pouch. I wanted to see the look of delight on our guests' face as they opened up their individual pouches. And it was a hit! Thanks Epicurious for making me look so good!

I served this at a surprise party for 7 couples and it was a hit. I used bernaise sauce instead of the vinegar sauce, which seemed too tart. I also made a pate with mushrooms, cream cheese, onions and a dab of sour cream to go over the salmon before I wrapped it in the pastry. Be careful not to overbake the salmon, as it cooks quickly. I am making this again tonight for another dinner party! I can't wait!!!

This was the best!! I've made this twice now, the first time for just my husband and I, and the second time for 12 people. I made the salmon the morning of the party and refrigerated it until an hour or so before I cooked it so it would come to room temp and not take so long to cook. I also made the sauce ahead and when I went to reheat it, the butter broke up and it was no longer thick, although no one noticed but me. So don't make the sauce ahead of time unless there is a trick to keeping it thick when you reheat it. I also cut out leaves to place on top and this made a great presentation. This is a keeper.

I thought this dish was really easy to make, that was a pleasant suprise. My husband loves salmon however I am not overly fond of it. I thought I would suprise him and make it at home, as the only time he has it is when we go out. To my delight it was not only easy to make but quite delicious also. I was a little leary of the sauce. I would have prefered a cream sauce but this really brought out the flavor. I'm hooked - yes this will be a regular meal at our house, but still be a special meal!

I was very impressed how nice this dish came out and how good it was!! I never did any baking so I thought the puff pastry might be a disaster. As it turned out, the dish looked very similar the one in the photo gallery. I did cut back on the tarragon by 1/2, as I did not want to overwhelm the dish with flavors that may be too strong. What a good meal it was!! Now I feel confident to make it for dinner guests.

This was easy to make and delicious. While the vinegar/wine sauce was a bit tart, it was quite good and complemented the salmon well. I set a side dish of the sauce to dip into, since too much of it could be overwhelming.

One of the best salmon dishes I have eaten.Surpriseingly easy to make. Try a light bernaise with capers. Just as nice.

ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!! One of the BEST Seafood dishes I have ever prepared. I improvised and put 1 TBSP SOUR CREAM into each Wellington before closing. The extra taste and texture was perfect. Must have for a dinner party.

I thought the recipe was great. You would have to like tarragon to want to eat it (as you can really taste the flavor of tarragon in the recipe). If not, substitute another herb - it would still be good!

Great presentation for minimal effort. But I found the sauce to be too strong with the amount of vinegar called for. After reading the other reviews (after I prepared it) I think it was just my vinegar - no one else has mentioned this. I'll try again!

Magnificent taste, exquisite presentation, but best of all - it is a do-ahead entree that allows you to enjoy your guests while it is baking. Recommend Beet and Beet Green Risotto with Horseradish (Gourmet 98) as an unforgettable menu! My guests really went for the tarragon sauce...I used Alessi Sweet (white) balsamic vinegar rather than white wine vinegar. It was a great culinary moment in my house!

This is absolutely the best meal I have ever prepared. I could not have been more proud. My guests just loved it. And I will make it again and again! I am not a gourmet cook (never had time to be), but I do love entertaining friends and take pride in the presentation and taste of foods. I was looking for something spectacular that could be prepared easily and quickly for a very special dinner. This was an awesome selection.

I've had this on my list of recipes to try since it came out in 9/99 and I can't believe I waited so long. It's amazing that something so easy to prepare can look so elegant.

I made this for friends who enjoy good food and nice presentation and we all loved it. I did not use all the fresh tarragon, but the flavor of the tarrragon was delicious in it! I will make this again since it was easy to do with company!

I made this dish for dinner on Christmas Eve and it came out fabulous. I do not like the sometimes overpowering flavor of tarragon so I substituted fresh dill and cut the amount to 1/2 tablespoon per fillet. Dill is a good compliment to the salmon. The sauce was excellent even though I cut the amount of butter. This dish is great for dinner parties where you want to impress someone!

This is absolutely delicious! The sauce pairs particularly well with the fish. I did use dried tarragon instead of fresh and cut down quite a bit on the amount, which helped prevent it from overwhelming the dish.

Delicious and different! Next time I too will decrease the amount of fresh tarragon. A bit much, even for this tarragon lover. Beautiful presentation and even better taste!

This was very easy to prepare, looks beautiful and tastes great! Next time, I would cut down a little on the amount of fresh tarragon put on each fillet.
