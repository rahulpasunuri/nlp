Colorful, flavorful, filling. Could be a great main course for lunch. We ate it as a side course to potato leek soup. The flavors are things that I don't eat very often, so it is a little special and out-of-the-ordinary.

Quite tasty, and as others have pointed out, very colorful, what with all the reds and greens. I plan to use more grapes next time (because I like grapes a lot). Otherwise, very nice!

This is colorful, easy to make, and a great combination of flavors. A nice change from the ordinary green side salad.

Pretty good salad. If I made it again I would increase the amount of romaine and grapes (I used red seedless instead of black). I would also decrease the amount of radicchio. It was a little over powering of the fennel. Other than that it was good, and very easy to make.
