I used only the sauce for a different stir fry. It had a nice flavor, good enough to make again.

The cornstarch mixture should be added when you transfer the pork and vegetables back to the wok.

one more comment - my cooking times are quite a bit longer than the recipe has. Maybe my wok temp isn't as high, but no way would I do pork for only 40 secs - that seems unsafe. I do the pork for at least 5 min. And it takes more than 30 secs for the bell pepper to "soften" so I do the veggies for longer also. And the "thickening" takes longer than 20 secs. So I would say trust what looks right to you re cooking time, not what is in the recipe. I really do like the results! just think the directions could be better.

My husband & I enjoy this recipe a lot; he has ordered this dish in restaurants, and says this tastes like he remembers it. I too am confused by the cornstarch; I add it in when I add the vinegar. Would love if someone knows if that is correct or not. There is a lot of prep for this recipe; best to have all the ingredients ready before starting up the wok. I use any dried mushrooms; doesn't have to be tree ears; or you can leave them out (I've done that too). I do use a lot of garlic and ginger. And I use pork steaks,as my store doesn't have pork butt. Very tasty!

Mediocre, like the restaurant. And what are you supposed to do with the reserved water/cornstarch mixture?

Exceptional dish- I substituted cubed pork (and sliced them into thin strips) for the ham/pork butt. Unfortunately, there were no tree ears available where I live, so I omitted them. Even with the prep work, it was a quick and easy dish to make.
