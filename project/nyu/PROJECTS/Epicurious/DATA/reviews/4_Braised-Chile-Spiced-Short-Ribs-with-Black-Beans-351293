Made this recipe one day early and reheated. Dish was very good - liked the spiciness with complex/earthy seasonings. The black bean recipe was bland, and was not worth effort. next time I would use canned beans or look for another black bean recipe with more seasonings.

This is rich, delicious dish full of complex flavors and just the right amount of spice (without being "spicy"). I appreciated the addition of cloves and cinnamon which added another layer of flavor beyond the usual chili heat/spice.

Delicious! I used maple syrup instead because I made chipotle/maple butter to go with some grilled corn and it turned out great.

Let me start by saying these are definitely my kind of flavors: Bold, spicy and complex. This was a wonderful dish that went together quickly and easily and then braised slowly while I did other things. I omitted bacon (we keep kosher) but I did toss in a little duck fat that I had in the fridge. At the end, just to brighten the dish I tossed in a whiff of fresh orange zest. You could cook a boot in this sauce and it would be delicious, but short ribs are even better!

Good but not great. Not worth the trouble.

Good, but not great. My husband far prefers the Beef Short Ribs in Chipotle and Green Chili Sauce recipe (on this website). Still very tasty. We went the whole day cooking in the crock pot method v. the recipe (the crock pot really tenderizes the meat). Serve with some great mashed potoates.

Outstanding and easy recipe; definitely restaurant quality. I made these in the slow cooker and served with warm tortillas and a salad with avocado.

*Just a little side note, I used a nice big pot for this recipe and the liquid reduced and the ribs were not fatty at all, I don't think an expensive dutch oven is necessary, just patience. They were fall off the bone tender after only three hours.

The ribs were delicious, three thumbs up from my roommates. I added cayenne pepper to the beans before serving which gave them a nice little kick. I will definitely be making this again!

I browned 100% of my ribs in a Le Creuset enameled cast iron Dutch Oven, in two batches. I oven- braised 50% in the Dutch Oven and after 3-1/2 hours @ 350 degrees the oven ribs were tender and the liquid reduced by half. The second 50% I attempted to braise in my slow cooker. Bad idea. After 3-1/2 hours the slow cooker ribs were tough, the fat unappetizingly intact and the liquid had not reduced. The slow cooker does not get HOT enough to BRAISE. Learn from my experience. I believe the heavy cast iron lid on the Dutch Oven also contributed to the oven braise where the glass lid on the slow cooker did not. I then put rib batch #2 into the now empty Dutch Oven and finished batch #2 in the oven for one hour @ 375 degrees....and they finished equal to batch #1. (Thank you, God.) My ribs were not as pretty as Gourmet's but very tasty.

I stayed pretty close to the recipe and these were delicious.

Great complex flavor. Spicy doesn't always mean "hot" and the chiles add a spice flavor without heat. My husband said this was one of the best dishes I have ever made. The beans were bland but my Cuban friend suggested using a sofrito and that took the beans up a notch. Definitely making this again!

Chile Ancho is now sold ground -- ready to use -- in Latin Markets

Beans and ribs are much better cooked in stock rather than water. Otherwise, a great alternative to the standard red wine-braised short ribs.

omg this dish is amazing. AMAZING!! I followed the recipe to a "T" and I would not change a thing (well, except the part where you're supposed to seed the ancho chilis while they're still dried; save yourself some trouble and soak them for 10 minutes or so before you do THAT, then soak them some more). This is probably the best new recipe I have found in more than a year. I would give it FIVE "forks" if allowed! -- such depth and complexity of flavor, and absolutely wonderful texture. Served with polenta, a HUGE hit with everyone in my family. Will definitely be a new family favorite!

Extraordinary. I doubled the chipotle and the garlic, but prepared the remainder as in the recipe. The resulting glaze in the pan was extraordinary. At the suggestion of the family, I stayed with whipped potatoes and believe that with the glaze it is a better option than the beans. To each his own.

We enjoyed this recipe. I make a lot of BBQ and these flavors had spice and depth. I took the cover off the last 30 min, hoping to cook down the sauce. I'm not sure it changed anything since this is the 1st time I've made it. I did not make the bean recipe. I used canned black beans from an old recipe. I did make mashed potatoes on the side. I would probably use tortillas or bread next time.

Made this night before serving it. Followed recipe, substituting country-style pork ribs (No, I have no idea why something with little or no bone is called a "rib.")Omitted the beans. Went over with everyone but me. After 3 hours there was less than 1/2 cup of sauce left. Next time I up the saquce and cut down on the time.

MMM... This is a very sexy dish. It tastes best when made the day before. For the black beans, I used a can of black beans warmed up with two cloves of crushed garlic and topped with caramelized onions. I also served it with plain rice to sop up the sauce.

Ok, maybe I did something wrong. I though the recipe was ok. Not nearly as spicy as I had hoped. The beans were a little on the bland side. Not my favorite recipe, but based on the other reviews, one I am willing to try again.

Very good, great depth of flavor. Not as spicy as I thought it would be but does have a kick. I used Cumin powder as I didn't have seeds and turned out great. I made the black beans but also served it with a simple polenta- you need something to catch the amazing sauce!

I am just a beginner when it comes to braising, but this recipe is easy as so delicious. I made it with a pot roast that I trimmed & cut into large (rib-sized) chunks. It was delicious & even better the next day. I used canned black beans that I drained, rinsed & then cooked with some cumin & fresh cilantro. Very tasty and definately a keeper.

Fantastic! Smells amazing, not too hard to make, and isn't as hot as one would expect (thoug I do like spicy food). A really great round mouth feel. Skip the black beans as they are not that good though, serve it with some mashed potatoes.

I did not use as much of the chipotles as called for because my daughter does not like spicy. I also thought the sauce was a bit thin, maybe only use 1 c. of the ancho chile liquid. Would have been much better with more chipotles! Black beans were great just ate the last of them for lunch with a scoop of salsa added.
