Very good pesto and a nice change for burgers.

My mom sent me arugula from her garden, so it may have been particularly flavorful. We did have to add extra oil to this to get the right consistency. We had mozzarella on hand, so we did follow that in the recipe. I think it would be quite good with a more flavorful cheese, like blue or swiss. I am looking forward to trying the pesto in another dish to fully taste its flavor profile. Our burgers were delicious, but did not completely adhere to the recipe. (Use turkey with spices, add grilled onions, avocado, and lemon mayonnaise.)

O.K. I don't find mozzarella to be a very flavorful cheese for a cheeseburger so I tried this again with goat cheese on half the burgers (thought it would go well with the pesto), cheddar on the other half. Although it was better with either of these cheeses, the end result was that the pesto was a lot of extra prep for very little extra flavor. I probably won't make it again.
