this is now my go to technique for cooking eggplant. crunchy on the outside, custard-like on the inside. not at all greasy, and easy. i did use the pomegranate molasses, but i would honestly be just as happy dipping these in a good spaghetti sauce. have already done it again & again.

We love this recipe. We took great care to slice the eggplant just as thin as called for by the recipe, and it yielded delicious results. We didn't have pomegranate molasses (though seeing what other people said about it absolutely making the sandwich, I'm sorry we didn't...), but the sandwiches were still delicious even without the molasses.

This was delicious! I made my own pomegranate molasses with a surplus of POM juice - don't skip the molasses, it totally makes the sandwich. I am only giving three forks because I made some substitutions based on what I had - I used ricotta and parmesan instead of the called for cheeses, and I used all basil because I didn't have any parsley. I had two small eggplants, but they weren't the long skinny kind. I think this would be great if you could find those, with a toothpick a tiny sandwich would be a great appetizer.

It's my second time making it. The first time was delicious (except for pomegranate syrup, was too sweet.. not sure if they sell " molasses here)So good you're tempted to make the eggplant rounds thicker the next time, as another reviewer wanted. Don't do it. The sandwiches get too big to put in your mouth, and it's simply too much eggplant to handle at once. The lovely aubergine taste suddenly becomes too squashy and sweetish. With the filling I always improvised, following reviews, and mixed mozzerella with feta or goat cheese, it turned out fine. I love it because it's quite easy

Surprisingly strong flavor; I'd like to try it again, substituting one of the cheeses with a milder variety. The eggplant has a wonderfully light and crispy texture. Easy to make, especially because you don't have to sweat the eggplant beforehand.

This was super tasty! I didn't have any provolone, so I just left it out to no ill effect. I used super skinny Japanese eggplant, and they made adorable little sandwiches, perfect for bite sized appetizers to serve at a cocktail party or something. Since the eggplant were baked not fried, they made for very delicate little pillows of eggplanty goodness.

Excellent. Even my teenage son, who generally refuses to eat eggplant, declared this dish to be excellent. The pomegranate molasses was a perfect accent for this dish.

This makes a delicious vegetarian dinner but it is a bit time consuming. First, I needed two eggplants to get 16 slices. Second, I couldn't find the molassas so I simmered pomegranate juice until it was the consistency of maple syrup. For the cook from Ohio, there is a recipe on this site called Muhammara. It's an excellent red pepper spread and it uses the molassas.

This was easy and very tasty, the eggplant gets really crispy, I was surprised how crispy it got. You can really improvise with the filling, I added a sausage and some mushrooms. Next time I'm going to mix in some cooked greens.

Really good. My husband was initially skeptical but loved it. Couldn't find sharp provolone or the molasses, so used mozzarella and a bit of Parmesan and served with marinara. Would suggest reducing the salt in the panko, as it was a little too salty.

Made these sandwiches many times and have served them with a sweet, spicy chili sc as well. Delicious. Great way to use eggplants.

i have made this 4 times now. i have made it with both regular breadcrumbs and panko. it is a sophisticated way to eat eggplant, esp if you use the panko and the pomegranate molasses. everytime i make it, people love it. it is also an easy dish for a vegetarian dinner

My daughter loves eggplant in any form and this one was no exception. I lined baking sheets with parchment paper and then brushed with the olive oil-a big help on clean up! The were very rich and filling (could actually cut down on the amount of cheese as I used most of two large eggplants and had plenty of the cheese mixture and I think they would have been even better with a thinner layer. Another great way to use the bottle of pomegranate molasses hanging around in the fridge. There must be some recipes that use more than a teaspoon or two!!!

Wonderful. I made this exactly as written, it was delicious and elegant. The pomegranate molasses was good (go easy on it) but I might consider using a marinara next time for variety.

I made this last night and it was very very yummy. My husband hates egglplants, but loved this dish. I used regular bredcrumbs and forgot to add the molasses on top, but it still turned out really good, because of the cheese filling.
