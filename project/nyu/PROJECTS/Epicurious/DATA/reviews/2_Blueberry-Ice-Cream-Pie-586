Note to cooks - I had hoped to make this for our family July 4th gathering, but I was unable to find the Blueberry and Cream ice cream called for in the recipe. After a few tries I called Haagen-Dazs directly and they no longer carry this flavor, or any blueberry variation. I guess the issue (August 1990!) should have clued me in to that possibility. Hope someone has luck with another blueberry ice cream.
