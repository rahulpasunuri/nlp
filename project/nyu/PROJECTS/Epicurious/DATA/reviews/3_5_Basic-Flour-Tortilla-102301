These tortillas were fabulous. I doubled the salt as others recommended. I also rolled mine out paper thin. Once a tortilla was cooked I placed it in a towel lined plastic bag to keep the steam on them. They were soft and delicious, not tough at all. I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again! The rolling out is a bit labour intensive but worth the effort

I only gave this recipe one fork because the tortillas were tough and flavorless. I didn't have my grandmas recipe on hand, so I used this one despite thinking there wasn't nearly enough fat or salt. I was right. And per the other review about shortening, I highly recommend using twice as much shortening as the suggesting oil in this recipe.

Followed directions exactly (except for doubling the salt and making the tortillas smaller) and it turned out great. Just thin enough, neither dry nor brittle. Yielded like a dozen tortillas.

Not as pliable as I would have liked. Some small changes. Doubled the salt per multiple suggestions and used shortening (could contribute to the crunch). Will continue to search for the perfect recipe.

Magnifico! My daughter and I had fun making them. We followed the advice of others and made them thinner and smaller. We also used vegetable shortening instead per the recco. of a iron skillet expert. It keeps the griddle from building up a sticky residue.

Magnifico! They were so easy to make and delicious. My 10 yr old daughter and I had lots of fun making them. We followed the advise of others-making them thinner and smaller. We also used vegetable shortening instead as a griddle expert advised this. This keeps the griddle from getting sticky. We were able to make 11 total. We'll never by store bought again.

I have made this recipe several times, it definitely needs 1 teaspoon of salt or seasoning. It is delicious! You can even make burritos with it. If you make the whole batch and put it inside a big zipblog bag it will last 2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator, and you can used it for a quick delicious and healthy meal. You should try it with scramble eggs, ham and cheese! yum :p

The two times I've made these they've ended up like pita bread. I can't get them to go any thinner than that. What am I doing wrong :(

The tortillas turned out really try and brittle, and I did follow the instructions exactly! There was another recipe that used vegetable shortening, that one turned out a lot better.

The texture of these is great, but the taste is somewhat lacking. Still looking for a good flour tortilla recipie.

The first couple of times I made these, they ended up becoming somewhat brittle as they cooled. I found I wasn't kneading them long enough. Be sure to do the whole five minutes. I've also found I like them better with twice the salt as another reviewer suggested. For some reason, my guests have been more impressed by the idea of homemade tortillas than by almost any other thing I've done. In terms of bang per buck, this is definitely a four fork recipe.

Yum! Easy (a tad messy with all the flour) and fast! I made this, put some cheesse on and it was great. Even for someone my age! But double the salt, let sit for 30 min., and make super thin. Perfection!

I made these tonight and they turned out really well. I've never made tortillas before, but this recipe was very easy. I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and let the dough rest before rolling it out. Since I didn't use all of the tortillas, I decided to freeze the dough for later use (hopefully that'll work). Will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this recipe with my first grade class when we talked about Latin America. I served the tortillas warm with salsa and cheese. It was simple and the children loved it.

Very simple, very easy, very delicious! Could add a little more salt for better taste, maybee another 1/2 tspn but not bad especially served with refried beans, sour cream and chile (salsa). My abuelita would approve of this, her home made flour tortillas are the bomb!!!

A very simple and good recipe. It didn't take a long time to make at all, although the dough tends to be a lot tougher to knead than I thought. But it was delicious!

This was great in a pinch...like them way better than any store bought flour tortillas...as someone else said..it made twice as many as the recipe said...I rolled them thinner..and used more baking (soda or powder..sorry can't remember which is in the recipe..at first they looked a bit thick, but they rolled better than I expected..very good indeed..

These were good, basic tortillas. I upped the amt of baking powder & salt, and allowed them to sit covered for 30 minutes before rolling them out, as per others' suggestions. They were very good, just not as great as I remember my friend's nonna's tortillas from childhood. Could it be the oil vs. shortening? I'll try it & report back. Happy eating!

I enjoyed making this recipe with my friend. He kneaded and rolled and I fried. The tortillas did become a bit tough the next day, but I just reheated them in the oven. They are wonderful!

I come from a long line of tortilla makers and I was very dissapointed in your recipe. In our family we do not use a tsp in our recipe because the next day- you end up having one big cracker. We would use one tablespoon baking powder and one tablespoon of salt. And as for the water- we use about 1 1/2 cup to 2 cups depending on how much flour you use and it is always luke warm. We prefer canola oil to anything else and if you want to make flavored tortillas- just add liquid to liquid and dry to dry. Some of our favorites are tomato flavored tortillas- just use a bit of tomato sauce with the water- and pineapple tortillas. We warm them over the burner and serve them with our shish kabobs whenever we have a barbecue. They're great in the morning with scrambled eggs as well.

A little tough, but they were resilient enough to make burritos. I rolled them once to about 1/8" thick, separated them with waxed paper and let them rest, then rolled them out as thin as possible just before frying each one. The dough is very stretchy, and I pulled it to help flatten them out.

I halfed the recipe (cuz I can) and only had bread flour on hand. But OHMIGAWD, did this really turn out good, added cheddar/jack and fresh cilantro; recooked over cast iron pan and was transported back to Cancun! Very simple, very good.

When I found this recipe, I was actually looking for something to use for making wrap sandwiches. It worked well, though I think I will take the other cooks advice and let the dough sit. My finace and my 4yr old had lots of fun helping me with these, and they loved eating them too!

I had tried making tortillas before and failed miserably.This time though my tortillas were perfect, I even put a little mexican seasoning in the dough and it was fabulous!My family could not get enough.

This was a very easy and good recipe. Everyone loved them. I divided the dough to make 12 tortillas. This made the size more manageable to work with. As others have mentioned, make the dough as thin as possible -- much thinner than the recipe directions. It helped to separate the dough into the number of tortillas you want to make and then let it relaaaaaaaaax several minutes -- before you roll it.

Wow, and I've been buying ready-made tortillas all this while... These are great. My burritos tasted so much better. The only problem I had was rolling them out into a nice looking circle!

This is easy and fairly quick. I, too, let the dough sit for at least 30 minutes the first time, finding the dough rolled better, with smoother edges. I also divided the dough into 16 taco-sized tortillas. The second time I made these, I added other ingredients--jalapenos and cilantro pureed with olive oil and some with roasted garlic and pesto sauce--yummy. These extra flavorings help make the whole-wheat version much tastier.

Good tortillas!! My suggestion is to let the dough sit, covered for 1/2 hour before rolling them out and frying them. This makes a more elastic tortilla, like my grandma made.

Very simple and easy recipe...I too agree that this recipe should make 12 instead of 8. Works out well!!

This recipe is terrific. I followed the advice to make 12 instead of 8 and rolled each as thin as possible. I also used the wheat flour version.

Excellent recipe for tortillas, but *do* roll them out very thin. My husband is on a low-salt diet and all the store-bought tortillas are loaded with salt. With this recipe I can cut the salt and have fresh, delicious tortillas. Make extras and freeze the leftovers for a last-minute-meal helper.

I agree it does need to be rolled out thinner, but also try dusting each tortilla with a little cornmeal just before putting on the griddle, it gives the tortillas a crunchy, corn kick!

This recipe is so simple to make you could do it with your eyes closed, and be done ten minutes. One thing for sure. The tortillas should be rolled out as thin as possible, about 1/16 of an inch. It shouldn't have any stickiness at all. A quarter inch thick like the recipe says would make pilot bread crackers. Maybe they could add a cracker recipe to their database.

I'm a long time tortilla maker but this recipe made with canola oil instead of shortening or lard is the best I've ever tried. Try the variation with 1 cup of whole wheat flour to 3 cups of white flour. Kids love rolling these out!

I'll make it again. But rolling the dough out to about 1/4 inch thick made pita bread more-so than tortillas. The dough needs to be rolled much thinner. I would also suggest cutting the dough into thirds, than halving and halving again until you have 12 equal portions. Then roll as thin as you can without breaking the dough. That would make 12 tortillas, much thinner and not so "pita-like". They do taste good, especially when made with the whole wheat flour and when cooked on a cast iron griddle or pan.

i really liked this recipe. certainly is better than the store bought tortillas. i used wheat flour in mine. we all agreed they are really good served right off the griddle.

There must be a mistake in the recipe. Tortillas in New Mexico are made with baking powder, not soda...and usually shortening, but I guess canola oil is healthier! -- Angie in Albuquerque

My husband says she put baking powder not soda in the tortillas. Is he right?
