Everyone considers this now my signature dessert. I have made it numerous times since it appeared in Bon Appetit in 2000. Everyone says it is the best panna cotta they have ever had, and many of our friends, and we, travel to Italy frequently. Not sure why some folks have had to reduce the gelatin. Mine always comes out the perfect consistency - that's one reason its so popular at my table. I always use the pine nuts which adds a wonderful crunch and additional layer of flavor. I've mostly used Vin Santo but have used Muscat a couple times when I couldn't find any Vin Santo. Both equally delicious. I only make this during fresh strawberry time here in NC, or use fresh strawberries I've frozen in season.

I have made this recipe a number of times and other panna cottas from Bon Appetite as well. This is by the far the best. Like other reviewers I reduced the gelatin by 1 tsp but I left everything else the same. I always get requests for this recipe. It's a truly wonderful comfort dessert.

Juat made this and thought the panna cotta was way too sugary and sweet. I would decrease the amount of sugar next time.

Very delicious, although the first time it was made, it was a bit too firm. This was remedied by reducing the gelatine to 3 tsp.I left out the pine nuts, but made the strawberry vin santo sauce. It's a fantastic dessert, and received rave reviews!

This was made for an Italian dessert for our gourmet club, and it was heavenly!!! Although it seemed a bit too firm on the first batch, so we decreased the gelatin to 3 tsp, instead of 4 tsp. We were unable to find vin santo, so used the cream sherry. The sauce was fantastic!!! We left off the pine nuts, but did add a decorative touch by swirling a caramel colored vanilla sauce randomly across the dessert. Quite possibly one of the best desserts we've ever eaten! Yes, it's THAT GOOD!!!

This is hands-down the best and simplest dessert to make! I can't believe it's better than my friend's panna cotta--and she's a gourmet chef! The sauce is fantastic, and don't skip real Vin Santo; it's worth the extra bucks (have a glass with the panna cotta!). The pine nuts toasted also lend a great element. I have also skipped the sauce and served with fresh blue/black/raspberry mix tossed in a sprinkle of Vin Santo and a little sugar...looks beautiful in a ramekin; you don't need to unmold. In fact, I'm serving it at a dinner party I'm having this weekend with Timpano!

This was a hit at my dinner party! One guest wasn't going to eat his dessert until his wife urged him to taste it, and he ended up finishing the whole thing. I omitted the pine nuts; maybe I will try them next time. I love the flavor that the sweet wine and honey added.

I used custard cups and they worked fine. I did use a warm-hot water bath to loosen the panna cotta to invert onto plates. The strawberry-vin santo sauce is very sweet but goes with the panna cotta perfectly. I did have a lot leftover so I would probably just make half the amount next time. I did substitute slivered almonds for the pine nuts -- they were kind of soft when we ate the dessert so I will omit the nuts altogether next time. Overall, an easy, light, and impressive-looking dessert.

I haven't made this exact recipe for panna cotta yet (although the one from the Letter from Italy is fabulous and is what we use in the restaurant) but to the first reviewer or anyone who would get confused reading this recipe-- just make the gelatin/water mixture in a small sauce pan (like the kind used for egs) and melt it directly over very very low heat stirring constantly. it will be melted and will work fine from there.

I would give this 10 stars if I could Beyond compare! The worst cook in the world could make this in 20 minutes (except for the chilling) and it would come out like Julia Childs prepared it. This is the first recipe I could say my husband could prepare on his own. Delicious and elegant! Use a good wine. I used a Muscat I bought at Whitehall Wineries in Napa and it was worth it. Did not put the pine nuts in the bottom of the cream as I was unsure I wanted to use them, but ended up sprinkling them over the top. I was glad I tried them; they gave it a very slight nuttiness and perfect blend of textures to the desert. Don't even consider the "low-fat" panna cotta recipe...nothing compares to real cream. As my mother says, "if you're going to sleep with the butler, enjoy it!"

This is the Classic Italiam dessert that you can not go wrong with. It isn't too sweet and the sugar lovers get the extra sweetness from the strawberry sauce. I have made this many times and the crowd always asks for more. Do make the investment in the custard cups, it makes all the difference in ease and presentation.

To the unknown cook from Santa Clara, CA on 05/26/00. This italian dessert can be made without the fuss of a form. See the recipe called 'Strawberry Panna Cotta with Strawberries and Honey, June 2000--just search 'panna cotta' and it will be found as well as other related ones. Panna Cotta is a classic Italian dessert and is it ever good! It isn't hard to make either, and looks particularly great in a -----. Go see the recipe for yourself, and see my comments below the recipe for 'Strawberry.... [I would have eMAILed same, but you did not include your eMAIL address.]

Re: 1st reviewer... don't put the bowl of gelatine in a POT of boiling water. Try a shallow pan with a little bit of simmering water.. that's all you need.... it doesn't take more than 2 minutes...

I served this as the finale to a full tuscan feast (inspired by the issue of Bon Appetit devoted to Tuscany). Everybody loved it and it was a good dish to serve for entertaining since you can do all the prep work ahead of time. I made the strawberry vin santo sauce two days ahead and the panna cotta one day ahead. I thought the amount of pine nuts recommended in the recipe seemed like too much for me so I reduced them by almost one half. I also found the instructions for preparing the gelatin a bit awkward so I may look for alternatives to how I do this the next time. Specifically, once you get the bowl of gelatin inside of the pot of boiling water, it is pretty difficult to get it out without scalding yourself or spilling the gelatin. I'm sure there must be a better way to do this so I will check back for your suggestions.
