I struggle with rice dishes but this came out quite well. I took some of the posted advice and after it cooked for about 30 minutes I made holes in the rice pile and poured down a little more butter and olive oil. I was hoping to ward off a burnt bottom. I'm not sure it helped but it didn't hurt. Next time, I'll try adding the yogurt/saffron to the bottom. Definately a keeper in my recipe book.

Excellent. The purpose of the tea towel under the lid is to absorb extra moisture. Otherwise it would drip off the lid back into the rice,rendering it less dry and fluffy.

This came out very nice. I used an extra TB of butter, but besides that I stuck to the recipe.

The boiling time should vary depending on where you live. If the humidity is high your cooking time would be lower or vice versa, you should wait for the water to boil again after you add your rice and then taste the rice. It should be a little tough in the middle when you take it off.

This is a really great recipe. I have been looking for a good Persian rice recipe since we visited Iran, and this is the first successful attempt. It is easy, and is now the standard for all recipes requiring rice in my house.

I'm half Persian, and my dad has always made rice this way. Mine turned out good, but not nearly as good as his. *sigh*. As other reviewers have mentioned, definitely place a towel-wrapped plate over the pot as you steam the rice - I don't know why, but all Persians do it that way. I alternate between making the tadig and throwing thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom. Another fun option is to add dill and lima beans.

We've used this recipe for a few years and love it! I always add fresh chopped or dried dill, slivered almonds and about 2 tbsp. of yougurt or sour cream. It's really great with just about anything!

used a little more butter for a thicker crust and cooked a little bit longer. Great!

I also have had this recipe when served by persian friends and the cook from Israel is right on the money with his suggestion about the thinly sliced potatoes and diced onions to be added. It also cooks better with a dish towel draped under the lid. No idea why that is.... One of my favorite dishes of all time when done right.

I am sure this recipe would have been good, but I screwed it up so maybe somebody here can learn from my mistakes. First, I boiled the rice too long and it became a mushy mess. I would say boil the rice for 8 mins, not 10, depending on your burner. Mine is strong. Also, I added the 2 tablespoons of salt and the rice was so salty I couldn't even eat it. So, I guess with practice, maybe I'll get it right next time.

I had this dish more than 10 years ago at a friend's house--she had grown up in Persia and learned the recipe there. The crunchy golden crust never left my memory and I searched high and low for a recipe to make it for myself. How excited was I when I found it in Gourmet! And it was exactly as a I remembered it.

This recipe is fantastic, but do include most all of the hints from the various reviews. I was thrilled to find this after having at a persian friend's home a year ago!

One more thing to make the tah-dig taste even better, if at all possible, pour crushed saffron in the yogurt (no more than 2 spoonfuls) and mix well and THEN add the rice. Make sure when you add the rice the yogurt's well blended and there aren't any clumps of yogurt. The yogurt acts as a cement, if you will, and binds the rice together for a fantabulous eating tah-dig. If you make the rice in a teflon/non-stick coated pot, for presentation's sake: put the dish you'll serve the rice from on top of the pot and hold with your fingers; in one swift move flip the pot over and the rice will make a perfect landing on your serving dish. The result will be a "rice pie" with a beautiful golden brown crust.

A great variation to this menu is cornish hen marinated in one tbs of warm water/saffron, salt, and pepper. Melt 3 tbs of butter layer the cornish hen pieces then layer the cooked basmati rice one cup at a time followed by 1-2 tbs of butter. Cover the lid with a towel. The hens turn out crispy, golden on moderate to low heat for 30 minutes. I use "I cannot believe it's butter."

This rice is my personal favorite. Just a few Suggestions/recommendations: Use the tallest, narrowest saucepan you have. Use dill and lightly toasted, slivered almonds. After the rice is cooked, layer it in the pan as follows: rice then almonds then dill for as many layers as possible. Finish with a rice layer. Then, with the back end of a wooden spoon, poke holes in the rice all the way to the bottom. After you poke the holes, pour some vegetable oil or any oil that can withstand high heat (in place of the butter) into each one. Then follow the recipe from adding the towel on. You will actually hear the bottom layer of rice sizzling to crispy, golden perfection. Believe me, the dill makes this recipe. You can also add a layer of golden raisins if you like them (I don't).

One step missing for traditional Persian cooking is that the basmati rice is typically soaked in water for several hours, then rinsed several times until the water runs clear right before the initial boiling.

My husband is from Iran so I have made this dish time and time again. When I make the tadig (persian name for the golden crust), I usually add 1 tablespoon of plain yogart to 1 cup of rice, mix it together and then spread the mix on the bottom of the oiled pan. I then put the remaining rice on top.

A Persian friend of mine made his version of this recipe using thinly sliced potatoes. Heat the oil in the pan, place the thinly sliced potatoes (peeled) to cover the bottom of the pan, then place the boiled drained rice on top. Press down firmly, cover with a paper towel,and the pot lid. Steam untel the potatoes are cooked and brown. This is the best rice!!! I have trouble getting the rice out in one cake. He gets it perfect everytime. Also, you could use pressed bread to make the topping in place of the potatoes- thats very good also.

I tried this with a pinch of saffron in the boiling water with the rice, and added 1 more tsp of butter and small pieces of turkey sausage and extended the cooking time to 1 hour. I was able to dunk the bottom of the skillet to cool it and flip the whole business over on a plate. It has the vibe of a fritatta. Served it with chipotle sauce grilled shrimp. It's kind of a persian paella.

I agree that a combination of butter and olive oil works best. Also a longer slower cooking time produced the best results for me. Adding some chicken would make this dish similar (as well as easier to prepare) to a recipe for Persian Rice in the "Seductions of Rice" cookbook.

receipe is very good,but I made it even better by melting the butter and frying a sliced onion and slices of potatoes first in the pan,till crispy and then turning them over and only then spooning the rice over them and continue cooking for at least a half an hour over a very love flame. You then flip the pot over on a plate and dig in.try it and see.

My friend's mom makes amazing persian rice so I had to try this one when I saw it. Mine didn't turn out nearly as well as hers, but I learned a few things: if you use gas lower heat for longer time is better (it burns easily) and a combination of butter and oil works better than oil alone for the bottom of the pan.

I first tried this dish in the 70's, when a friend from Iran made this for me. He "Americanized" it by adding southern fried chicken in layers in the rice before covering it with the towel and cooking for the last 30 minutes. Quite unique and the chicken gave the tah-dig a wonderful flavor.
