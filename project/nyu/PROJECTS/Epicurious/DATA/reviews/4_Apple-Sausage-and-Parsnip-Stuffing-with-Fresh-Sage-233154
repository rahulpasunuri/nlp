This was absolutely delicious. I took other reviewer's recommendations and prepped the celery, onion, parsnips and bread crumbs the day before. I also made half of the recipe which comfortably fed 10 adults. I used the full half cup of chicken broth which I thought was necessary because of the amount of bread. I also chopped up the sage before sauteing. This is definitely going to make an appearance next year!

We all enjoyed this with the Cider-Brined-And-Glazed Turkey. I would make this recipe in half next time. We all enjoyed the taste.

This will be the second time making this dish (the first time was an absolute hit). In my opinion, there's too much sausage and I will be cutting that portion of the recipe in half. And I use pre-dried bread from the market.

I didn't mind the volume this created or the amount of time to chop, but I was disappointed in the end result. The bread cubes were too large even though I cut them as small as possible with a knife and try as I might to keep it moist by adding additional broth it came out dry.The flavors were good, but the consistency was my issue.

Not sure if it is really fair to review this recipe because I left out the sausage on account of having a vegetarian in attendance at Thanksgiving. The parsnips were a wonderful addition to stuffing, I may add a bit more sage next time, just because I love the flavor so much.

Rating: 4
This recipe was great! Since some other reviewers thought it was bland, I seasoned all of the veggies with salt and pepper while they sauteed. I also ended up using about 2 cups of stock to moisten the bread (could probably have done slightly less in hindsight). Still, an excellent stuffing!

I loved it. I did all the vegetable prep the day before, so that saved that chore on Thanksgiving Day. I didn't make the whole recipe; I used about 1/2 a large loaf of peasant bread and scaled down everything else approximately, and it made a good amount for our small gathering with a few meals worth of leftovers. The only flaw in the directions that I found was that the parsnips were still quite tough after 10 minutes. I probably cooked them nearly twice that so that they would be soft. I like most vegetables al dente, but not tough parsnips. It seemed a little dry when everything was mixed together (I don't use that much butter), so I also added more chicken stock before baking it. I'm not married to any particular stuffing recipe and I tend to look up recipes for it every year. I don't know that I'd make the same exact recipe again, since so many are similar, but this was a good one.

Pros: Great combination of parsnips, apples, sausages and sage, easy to prepare. Cons: Pretty darned bland and IF I made it again, I'd soak add at least a cup of milk with two eggs whipped into it, pour it over the bread and let it soak for 15 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I'd also up the spice ante with some thyme and dried sage as well.

Fantastic! I am now a huge fan of Parsnips and will make this every Xmas and Thanksgiving from now on. The four of us ate all 12 servings in two days, great for breakfast as well. Enjoy!

This stuffing was fantastic! Very flavorful and well balanced. This does make quite a bit -i filled two 9" x 13" pans full and after feeding 9 people for Thanksgiving dinner, I still had a full pan left of it! (Which is actually quite delicious for breakfast the next day.) I recommend doing some of the vegetable prep the day before to save time day of. I bit time consuming to make but well worth it. I also added about a cup of chix stock before cooking to ensure it was moist enough and it seemed to work perfectly.

This was wonderful! Everyone loved it. Yes, it does make a lot of stuffing but as stuffing is my favorite part of the feast, I don't mind having a lot of it left over.

This was a great recipe but way too much. It makes 12 servings as a stand alone meal, in my opinion. Just add up the pounds of ingredients and you have more than 10 pounds of stuffing. I liked the recipe but I think it was a bit too hearty to serve on Thanksgiving with all the other fixings.

I haven't even gotten this into the turkey yet and it's already one of the most delicious stuffings I've ever tasted. I did make a large number of changes. First I halved the recipe (15lb bird), put everything in the food processor instead of chopping stuff, used 1/3 kamut bread (toasted then torn) to 2/3 brown Basmati rice (this gives it a very nutty flavor), and finally added walnuts apricots and dates. A bunch of zucchini got in there as well because I was making two things at once. I also put in two Tbs parsley and a bunch of rosemary. I also only used four hot sausages. It's essentially a different recipe, but the critical stuff, parsnips, apple, sausage, and sage, are all there.

Rating: 4
I agree with others, it takes some prep work, but if done right this is very good. The only thing is that it is a bit dry for me. We don't stuff the bird so that is the difference and why it was so dry for us. Next time I make it I am going to drench it in chicken broth. That will make it the moist consistency that we prefer.

Stuffing was yummy. I did less than half the recipe based on previou sreviews saying even 1/2 was too much. Skipped the parsnips. Easy to make the night before and heat up in the oven on Thanksgiving day.

Rating: 4
This is my absolute favorite, but a word of warning - with the sausage, it's quite a hearty stuffing. Now I don't like roast turkey that much, so I fill up on this stuff, but it can be overwhelming with all the other stuff going on. I made 1/2 vegetarian for a particular guest (no chicken broth or sausage) and that was quite tasty, too - and a bit more unique than the average stuffing. If you chop everything the night before, it's a much less onerous recipe to handle on Thanksgiving day.

Rating: 4
Great stuffing. Followed recipe exactly except divided quantities by 3 to serve 4 instead of 12. Made enough stuffing for 8. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Very delicious. Even the stuffing-hater loved it. I don't think it's so huge... It's 1 and a half, not 11 and a half loaves. To me, if you make a 20+ pound bird, you need that much stuffing, but then again, that's coming from someone who "dresses" a bird and calls it "dressing!" We love the stuff (ha) and would never consider using boxed bread cubes - they are too small and uniform and it just doesn't come out the same.

Rating: 0
I agree with what other reviewers have said - even half quantity seems a great amount; chop the sage leaves; cut bread into small cubes; prep time is significant but I think worth it; tastes delicious and interesting!

Rating: 4
This is excellent. I made it for 25 people on Thanksgiving...and it was the hit of the meal. Everyone loved it. It takes time to separately prep all the ingredients, but it's worth it & that's what makes it taste extra special. I used bread cubes, not crumbs. I already made this a 2nd time since Thanksgiving....there weren't enough leftovers with my crew, even though the quantities are enormous!

Rating: 4
I halved the reciepe and even so had leftovers. Used organic sausage so missed out on the sweet and spicy flavors, but nevertheless worth cooking. I used fresh sourdough bread instead of bread crumbs because the crumbs need a lot more liquid than the reciepe asks for. Learnt this trick for dieters watching carb intake - use fresh bread crumbs to bread anything because of the volume difference.

Rating: 4
This was a great stuffing recipe, every one loved it! I used sweet italian turkey sasauge only and left out the spicy sausage, only for my own prefrence. It turned out great! I was able to get everyone to eat it, even those that didn't like stuffing before this one! yummm!

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I can't stop eating this stuffing, neither could anyone else at thanksgiving! The only thing I had trouble with was getting the stuffing to reach 160 degrees inside the turkey (the temp CDC recommends stuffing should reach to kill any Samonella). Mine only got to 120 after 3 hours, and it was clear the bird would be ready well before the stuffing got to temp. So I scraped it out and cooked it separately in the oven.

Rating: 4
Halved the recipe, still makes enough for 8-10 servings. Also left the parsnips out and doubled the amount of liquid. I agree with previous reviewers- I wish I had made the bread bits smaller, it was closer to a bread pudding, but still absolutely great, it's a nice alternative to traditional stuffing.

Tasty stuffing, but I think there are others out there that are way less labor intensive...ie don't involve various separate rounds of sautéing. I halved this recipe and it easily have served 8 with leftovers; it's quite huge as is. Also, I recommend giving the sage leaves a quick chop.

Without question the best Thanksgiving day stuffing I've ever made. It's now an annual tradition at our house. The balance between the apple and parsnip is wonderfully evocative of New England in the autumn.

Someone had asked earlier: The recipe calls for 1 (one and a half) pound loaf of bread. NOT eleven loaves of bread. Maybe that's why one chef had complained that the recipe has too much bread? Happy cooking...

Really really delicious stuffing. We halved the recipe (and it was still way too much for 6 people... we still have leftovers). We also used fresh apple juice instead of chicken stock. Next time, I might play down the parsnips a little and use less, as well we used bacon cheddar (with cinnamon) sausages and italian sausages and I would try another type (too much cinnamon). But overall, really really really delicious, a total hit at our quasi-thanksgiving dinner.

I love this with the Herb Roasted Turkey with Apple Cider gravy. Sounds like a strange combination but guest love it. Do it even when not planning a special meal. Lots of flavor.

I've made other dressings with great success, so I don't think it's me, but this was a bomb at our house. No one really liked it or ate much of it - the bread and parsnips and apples all ended up with the same consistency, which is to say, smushy. I don't think that lightly toasting french bread in the oven is enough - I think croutons are better in this case, and there is WAAAAY too much bread in the recipe. I spent so much money on all of the ingredients (organic, etc) that to have it turn out like this was truly disappointing. My favorite stuffing is still (on this site)- fennel and cornbread. I DO NOT recommend this recipe unless everyone in your party has a very bland palate.

I halved the amount of bread but kept all ingredients the same amount as in the recipe. Came out wonderful. You can omit the sausages, as they don't add too much difference, and also add a lot more chicken broth for additional moistness and flavour instead. Divine!

This stuffing was a hit! I served it with the apple cider brined turkey that was paired with it. A couple of comments - it makes a TON of stuffing so unless you are having a large group, halving the recipe is probably best. I halved the recipe, using a 14 oz bag of unseasoned bread cubes and still had enough stuffing to fill two 9x13 casserole dishes. Also, I added way more liquid than it called for - I added at least a cup of chicken broth to the "halved" recipe and still could have added a bit more. I don't stuff mine into the bird, but it really could have been moister. I also didn't think the sage would be enough seasoning, so I also sauteed freshly chopped rosemary, parsley, and thyme along with the sage. I was unsure if I would like the parsnips as I've never had them before, but the stuffing was delicious! As someone else noted, I did my sauteeing ahead of time, with the exception of the apples and seasoning. I did the onions, celery, sausage and parsnips the night before so it wouldn't be so time consuming. I finished the apples and seasonings the next morning, then threw it all together a couple of hours b/f I put it in the oven. For someone who asked, I think you could prepare most of it several days in advance but would probably wait to do the last steps until the morning of the day you want to cook it.

DEFINITELY make 1/2 (if you're not stuffing the bird). I fed 11 and had leftovers. Took a while, but rave reviews. I made the night before, then heated for an hour day of.

I also would like to know how far in advance this could be prepared. Also, would it go with the molasses-brined turkey from this site? The suggested dressing for that is cornbread, I made it a few years ago and we did not like it (the dressing); the turkey was a hit.

Can anyone clarify - that's one 1 1/2 lb loaf of bread, not an 11 1/2 lb loaf... right? Logic would seem to dictate the former, but just wanted to make sure.

I cut this recipe and half, and used Tapioca bread (Gluten and Wheat free) instead of the sour dough bread. Everyone loved it, and nobody could tell that I used a Gluten and Wheat free product. The sausage and apples gave the stuffing some intense flavors, along with the sage.

Prepared a one third batch of this recipe. Did not add the parsnips and I used bulk breakfast sausage instead of the Italian. Still Delicious. I did need to add much more chicken stock than called for as I cooked the stuffing separatly in a 9" square pan. I used approx 1 1/4 cups for this 1/3rd of a recipe.

My experience was the same as other reviewers - absolutely fantastic, and worth the work (and the wait), but still a lot of work! I made some modifications: about a pound less apples and parsnips, and I also used bulk maple sausage, in addition to mild italian, which was awesome! I ended up subbing thyme for the sage (unfortunately, they were out of fresh sage at my grocer, but the thyme worked well, too). I also used quite a bit more chicken broth to keep it moist, as we baked it separately from the bird (about 1.5 cups more). Quite wonderful, altogether! Plan ahead to save headache at the last minute.

Excellent recipe, this will definately become the one that I use each year! The chopping and sauteeing were a bit time consuming, but well worth it. The parsnips were the key ingredient, their flavor is unique but subtile. I wouldn't recommend making this recipe without them. I did use bulk breakfast sausage instead of the italian sausage that was recommended. I think that the recipe would be just as good and maybe a little more moist if quartered mushrooms were used in place of the sausage. I also added 2T of tart dried cherries to give the mixture a little "kick". Loved the outcome!

This was a HIT on Thanksgiving day. I had made two different stuffings and according to the group, this was the star! Very moist with a lot of flavors and textures. However, it is time consuming so I cooked the sausage, onions and celery the day before and toated the bread. Thanksgiving morning I just sauteed the apples, parsnips, mixed everything and voila!

This is the perfect stuffing to go with the herb roasted turkey with cider gravy from this site. I halved the recipe and still had plenty for 10 with leftovers. I did use 1 cup of broth for a more moist dressing, and used spicy cajun sausage. The contrast of the sweet/tart apples and the cruncy parsnips was just great. And the smell of the sage cooking in the butter.........mmmmmmmmmmm.

I served this stuffing with our Thanksgiving meal today, and it received exstatic reviews from everyone. I had never cooked or eaten a parsnip before this, and I was pleasantly surprised at the special flavor it added to the recipe. This stuffing would probably still be a winner without the parsnips and sage, but these two ingredients are what give it a unique and intricate flavor. The recipe itself is not difficult to execute, but somewhat time consuming because of the large volume of peeling, chopping, etc. If you do not have extremely large cookware, it may be difficult to prepare this as a single batch. Sauteeing 6 cups of onions and 2 cups of celery at once was a little too much for my largest pan. It turned out fine, but the onions never did get quite golden brown. When I make it again I will try cooking half as much (I don't feed 12 people on a regular basis.)Nonetheless, this stuffing is a winner, and I will be making it again.

I love this stuffing and would definitely make it again. It wasn't super easy, but it's worth making. I forgot to put in the parsnips, but it still turned out great.
