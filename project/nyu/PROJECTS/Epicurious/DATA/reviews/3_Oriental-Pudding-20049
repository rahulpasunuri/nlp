I really enjoyed this recipe! Although I wouldn't call it Oriental Pudding, I do enjoy the ginger, dates and coconut. Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Also as a variation try this with Cream of Wheat instead. Delicious! Also, lots of kids may like this better if the dates and coconut are kept to a minimum or omitted.

My husband and I really liked this pudding. My kids, 12 & 3, though, didn't care for it. My 12 year-old likes almost everything but really didn't like this at all. He even wrote a paper at school about how much he disliked it! That's ok -- more for us "grown-ups!"
