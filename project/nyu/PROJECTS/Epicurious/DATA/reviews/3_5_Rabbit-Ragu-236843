This was good - I used veal. I did not cook it for the required 10 hours (????) but simmered it in my Le Creuset for 2 1/2 hours -- it was delicious with home made gnocchi.

Flavoursome and easy to make. I did serve it with the polenta... Husban and I loved it, but the kids liked it better with the fresh hot garlic and herb bread I also served. Will make again. Cheers
