I saw this recipe while at work and called the hubby and had him make it minus the almonds (which we were out of). I can't wait to get more squash, this was so yummy!

Thanks to another commenter I just figured out that the squash I used was a calabasa! Thanks, cook from Long Island!

What can I say but yum?! This is a perfect holiday dish and great for winter. I got a huge, unidentifiable squash from my CSA and used it for this - it worked out great! It turned out to be similar to butternut squash. The caramelized onions to top took forever to cook, but were totally worth it.

This recipe was delicious! We modified some of the amounts, and I think it worked perfectly: 1 or 2 onions at most 1/8 cup sugar (used purevia instead) 1/5 tsp cinnamon 1/4 cup raisins (didn't plump them) Will definitely make again! YUM!

A little disappointed with this dish. Way too many onions - it seemed like there were more onions than squash. Kind of tasted like baked apples. A few too many raisins.

The squash vanished from the pan - my family loved it

Not nearly enough squash, way too much onion.

Onions took longer to cook, and never browned. Cooked squash w/onions for a bit.Very tasty.

I thought this would be have an exotic flavor, but it was overwhelmed by the cinnamon. I would not make this again.... I like winter squash with brown sugar and butter, i'll just stick with that.

This was very good and very unique BUT cut back on the onions ... way too many. Also I used just one teaspoon of cinammon and a bit less sugar. It was especially good with the crunchy almonds on top.

It was superb! I loved the mixture of flavors. It reminded me of a Sephardic tsimmes, if there is such a thing. I used the Spanish squash, called calabasa, which in Israel is often mistakenly called pumpkin. I'm looking forward to making it again for company. It would be a very appropriate side dish for Thanksgiving or just about any Jewish holiday including Passover.

I made this recipe for a group of friends for Thanksgiving (the Canadian one in October) and everyone loved it including three friends who love to cook and are food snobs. Highly recommended!

This is superb! I made it the day before, with butternut squash, re-heated it in the microwave and topped with the almonds ppepared earlier. Everyone agreed that it was outstanding.

I try to like squash but am often disappointed with it. This recipe was impossible not to like. With the carmelized cinnamon onions, raisins and deeply-flavored almonds, the texture and taste combination was outstanding. I concur with the previous review; don't change anything. I made this with turban squash and was delighted.

I made it for my family first,they could not get enough of it. Today I took it to a church potluck. It got great comments, most of the ladies wanted the recipe for it. My husband said, please do not wait till the winterseason before we can have it again and do not change anything about the recipe. IT IS A KEEPER.
