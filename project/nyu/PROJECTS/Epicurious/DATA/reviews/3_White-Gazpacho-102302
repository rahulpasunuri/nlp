Always a hit although I have made a speedier version by toasting almond meal and and using more garlic. I puree about 2/3 of the grapes and cucumber with the bread in a blender and use far less oil. The Spanish love the oil but I'm looking for something lighter.

Absolutely agree with A Cook from Long Island. Much much too oily, so oily in fact that it separated constantly while eating. The grape, cucumber, crouton combo was excellent taste together, the soup itself inedible without this topping.

Looks like the white gazpacho I learned to love when I lived in Spain; I'm going out to buy almonds right now. Some cooks use the blender to emulsify the almond flour, garlic, damp bread, vinegar and oil, somewhat like a mayonnaise. Then they thin it slightly with the grapes and water.

Once I added a lot more pureed grapes, this recipe was great. If you have grapes with incredibly dense flavor, stick with the quantity. If the grapes are ordinary, add more.

Different, but much too oily for my taste. Half the family could not even finish their bowls.

This recipe is unusual, easy, and delicious. An extra clove of garlic made it even better.
