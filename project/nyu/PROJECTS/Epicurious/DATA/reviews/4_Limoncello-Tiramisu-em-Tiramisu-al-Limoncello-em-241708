Sorry Lidia, but I really didn't like this. Totally one note with nothing to cut the excessive lemon flavor. The lady fingers got wet and soggy as they absorbed liquid from the cream filling. Also a very expensive recipe to make with the lemoncello ($18) for the cheapest bottle, marscapone and lady fingers. I wouldn't make this again.

This was really delicious and my first time making this dessert. I made it for Easter, so I bought extra mascarpone and had extra eggs on hand in case I encountered some of the other reviewers problems. The zabaglione went perfectly. Be careful because the instant it is ready you need to get it off the heat or it will curdle. You can strain it, but it isn't nearly as good, better to start over. I beat the mascarpone with a spatula and it went grainy in a very short time. So I started over with the extra mascarpone I had on hand this time mixing it gently to smooth then adding the zest. After this everything incorporated beautifully and the dessert went together beautifully. I make candied lemon peel for the topping, and it was really good, but the dessert did not need it. This is a really good dessert. I rank it up there with the Tropical Carrot Cake

Made this one for a second time with a few changes based on previous experience and other reviews! Definitely only need half of the syrup and this time I put 1/2 cup of lemoncello into the zabablione/mascarpone mixture just before folding in the beaten egg whites. I wanted a more elegant presentation, so lined the sides and bottom of trifle dish with the lady fingers and soaked them with syrup using a plastic squeeze bottle. Next added a layer of the cream topped with more ladyfingers etc. Just before serving I topped with some coarsely grated lemon zest (coarse microplane) and blackberries and raspberries. Beautiful to the eyes and mouth!!!

I made this for an Easter dessert. Everyone fell in love with it. It takes time, but the taste and rave reviews make it worth the effort.

Have made it twice, big hit both times. I took the advice of the cook who added fresh raspberries crushed with sugar in a thin layer on the first layer of lemon cream, and served it with the leftover raspberry sauce, fresh raspberries, and whipped cream on the side. Regarding the amount of syrup: The first time, I took the advice of several reviewers, and made only about 2/3 of the syrup, quickly rolling the ladyfingers in it. I found the tiramisu a bit "crunchy," and not soaked enough with lemon-y flavor. The second time I not only did a quick individual soak of each "finger," but then took another reviewer's advice, and soaked the cookies further with syrup via a turkey baster. I used all but about 1/4 c. of the full recipe of the syrup on the second round; much better!

My only caveat would be don't bring this to anyone else's house. Once you do it will the the first and only thing you will be asked to make from that point forward. I am making one for Christmas dinner and it was honestly the first thing on our hostess' request list for me to bring. Enjoy!!

I have been making this special occasion dessert for a couple of years. If you take the time to do it right it is an unbelievable dessert. Not particularly difficult to make, it just has a bunch of steps and uses pots and pans and bowls galore and takes time. Honestly if the results weren't so spectacular I probably wouldn't make it. For someone who is not known for her baking skills at all (I am never asked to bring the dessert), I blew the competition away at the first family Thanksgiving dinner I took this too. People were stealing tupperware bowls to take the leftovers home. I make it almost verbatim, actually double it, and make 2 half-sheet deep aluminum pans. It isn't much more work to make two and I leave one at home for us to eat since I know that none will be coming home from the dinners we attend. I do take the time to make a fancy presentation. I dip the lady fingers in the liquid and stand them up all around the edge. Then I fill in the bottom with the first layer of cookies. After I put in a custard layer I put in a layer of crushed raspberries mixed with a little sugar, before the next layer of cookies. Not too much, just enough for a little color and an extra little taste. I end with a layer of cookies and chill overnight to set really well. I put all the cookies in the same direction for the layers, cutting off the ends of the last row to fit in the pan. After chilling overnight I can turn it upside down on a platter and the whole thing stays together as a stand-alone dessert. Then I pipe whipped cream rosettes on top and place one raspberry on each rosette. People freak out when they see it. It is just so light, not overly sweet, and the perfect end to what is normally a day of complete indulgence. Not that the taste would be any different if it was made and served in the pan similar to a banana pudding, but the presentation is absolutely spectacular.

Added 1/2 pint heavy cream to custard mixture. It was a hit. Everyone loved it.

Easy to make and a great hit with the friends. I ended up zesting all of my lemons, which I then candied. A lite layer of fresh whipped cream on top and sprinkle the candied lemon zest across that; voila the dessert looked complete.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was easier than I thought it would be. Also, I sampled some limoncello beforehand and was worried that it would have a strong taste, but once the alcohol burns off, it is really quite pleasant. In fact, it was just the right amount of lemon flavor. I think you could get away with leaving out the limoncello and substituting some other liquid along with more lemon juice.

Wonderful! At first it wasn't looking good :( I made the lemon sponge - but I had the heat too high. So it didn't really become fluffy. I put the tiramisu together anyway. The next morning (after googling recipes for zambaglioni) I found one that emphasized low heat and used a hand mixer. I made half the recipe for the sponge and marscapone mix and just added the extra layer. It was great! For presentation, my very creative assistant topped each piece with a few mixed berries and a coulis of mixed berries. It really made a beautiful contrast with the light yellow tiramisu.

Absolutely delicious! I served this alongside traditional tiramisu (Gourmet January 2009) and everyone raved about this lemon version! Be sure to use good quality limoncello (Sogno di Sorrento is best but Meletti is good too)

A great take on Tiramisu. At suggestion of other reviewers I made half of the syrup and applied with a squeeze bottle (and still ended up using only half). It seemed perfect. Presentation seemed a bit lacking for such an elegant dessert. I crumbled the few extra lady fingers that wouldn't fit into the 9 x 13 pan and sprinkled it over the top with a bit more grated lemon zest. I think it deserves a trifle dish with a twist or spiral of lemon peel to bring it up a notch. The lightness and fresh flavor was a great contrast to the chocolate, almond raspberry tart for this New Year's eve party (2010)

The first time I made this, it turned out beautifully. This time, though, I had trouble with my mascarpone breaking up (almost looking like cottage cheese) after I softened it with a spoon and added the lemon zest as directed. Could it have reacted to the lemon zest? My zabaglione turned out great, so I was optimistic, but the curdled mascarpone hurt the texture of the finished product (the stores were already closed on Christmas eve, so I couldn't make a last minute run for more mascarpone) -- Any tips on what might have happened, and how it might be remedied if it happens again? It was perfect the first time I made it a couple of years ago, and this time it tasted good but the texture was really diminished by the problem with the mascarpone. Hints, anyone?

Quick tip--instead of dipping the ladyfingers, I put the syrup in a squeeze bottle, lay the cookies in the serving dish then squeeze the syrup ontop. Less messy and saves time.

It was my MIL's birthday I decided to make this and everybody raved about it. My FIL who doesn't do dessert much had asked for another serving. I used the limoncello di leva probably 3/4 of a bottle and used the rest to marinate chicken breast for a chicken souvlaki. I actually forgot to mix the syrup with the sponge and did it last minute. It still turned out good. This tiramisu is a labor of love. With the procedure and all, you are only going to make it for your love ones. Glad I did it for my mom.

Help! I want to try this recipe after seeing it my newspaper. A friend of mine does not consume alcohol for religious/spiritual reasons, and wondered if there is a good substitute for limoncello. Would lemonade work? Also, I found Absolut limoncello in a huge bottle. Is this what would originally be used?

I made this for a bridal shower. I've never made a tiramisu before, and it was perfect! I had made some Limoncello myself, and the flavor throughout this dessert is so bright and lively! Yes it's work but it is worth it!!

I just made it and I'm not yet sure of the verdict. I used Limoncello de Leva and it has a very good taste to it. I followed some of the tips of those who made it. For the syrup, I used 1/2 cup of limoncello instead of a cup and a cup water. Then I poured the remaining 1/2 cup of limoncello in the mascarpone-egg white-zagbalione mixture which made it really lemon-ey and lighter in consistensy.

This tiramisu variation is AWESOME. We made it for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit with all ages. It's only slightly more work than traditional tiramisu (making the zabaglione), with the syrup replacing brewing espresso, and the lighter flavor seems more appropriate for spring/summer. I did need more than 40 savoiardi, so buy an extra box. As others noted, the recipe makes 2x the syrup needed. We combined the leftover syrup with mineral water and a little cherry syrup from a jar of maraschinos to make our own version of pink lemonade.

This was amazing! Perfect for Easter/spring dessert. Nice and light, and refreshing. Chilled it in the fridge for about 5 hours, and this may not have been enough time for it to completely set because I couldn't cut it into nice squares that stood on their own. Mine kind of glommed into a squarish shape once plated. So when I'm tight on time again, I may just put in ramekins or glasses - because the flavor did not suffer.

This was absolutely FABULOUS! OMG! Yes, it's a lot of work and yes, it requires several bowls... but the end product is more than worth it.

Try it once - do not be intimidated!

I made this recipe after reading the wonderful reviews. It wasn't difficult but it did require lots of bowls and pans to complete the steps. I consider myself a good cook but was very dissapointed in the result! The flavors were delightful but the tirimisu was dry. I followed the directions for moistening the ladyfinfers but it was not adequate moisture for the dish. I won't make this again. Too much work for too little presentation. There are better desserts out there.

Wowza! Fabulous! Lot's of work, of course, but delicious for a fancy dinner. I made it in individual tall glass dessert dishes, and it was a pretty presentation. I found that the limoncello got a little too strong in flavor near the bottom, but it might have been the dishes I used.

Loved this recipe. It wasn't terribly complicated -- no worse than a cake. And it came out great -- amazing texture and flavor. I couldn't find any ladyfingers and wanted to keep with an Italian theme so I used Stella D'Oro Margherite cookies.

This limoncello dessert was light and refreshing. Also, think about what to do with your left over syrup, it was a waste with so much delicious syrup left over after soaking the ladyfingers. However, I would recommend individual serving's in Coppas instead of the big pan. And it was quite time consuming and used a lot of dishes to make.

Wonderful! I did not use any zest into the mascarpone, but used the rinds to make candied lemon for toppings and garnish. I must of erred the first attempt because it did feel grainy. But, the second batch was spot-on. Thanks Lidia!

This was a showstopper at Easter dinner! It was decadent but somehow light simultaneously, and the bright flavor of the lemon (limoncello) was perfect for a Springtime dessert. I halved the recipe, (3 eggs) using a bit more limoncello (less water) and it was easily enough for 8.

Very good version for those of us who do not prefer coffee. Several people commented on the problem of grainyness. This could happen very easily if you are not accustomed to making custards or sabayon creams. As mentioned cook the egg mixture over simmering water comstantly whisking and make sure it does not cook the egg mixture too hard but just thickens it. If it gets too hot and curdles only slightly you can strain the egg solids out. Also this could happen if you whip the cream too much or the eggs whites too stiff. The cream should be whipped to soft peaks and be creamy and not stiff as it will stiffen with further mixing and may separate -also the egg whites should not be whipped too hard as they will dry and may break separating into granular hunks. The techniques used in this receipe are advanced and just need a little care and perhaps some practice. They are well worth learning as the results are superior to just using cream and mascarpone.

As I sit here, eating a piece of this tiramisu, I must say it's pretty delicious! I made it with homemade limoncello, and that made a difference. My only complaint is that I prefer a higher ratio of mascarpone mixture to ladyfingers. However, if it were assembled similar to the reviews from Aunt Enza's Tiramisu (it's on epicurious, and it's amazing) where it's put into a round springform pan, I think that problem would be solved. I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty and light to the traditional tiramisu. Even my hubby that's a big chocolate lover, loved this version. Just make sure to temper the eggs over SIMMERING water, NOT boiling water so that your eggs do not cook and become grainy. I will be using this cream for other tiramisues as well.

I've had problems with tirimisu cream being grainy, so I altered this a bit and substituted heavy cream beat to stiff peaks for the egg whites. I got a really smooth and creamy filling. I also added the liqueur directly to the cheese. All in all, it's a good recipe and very yummy!

I'm a big fan of Tiramisu and this was truly delicious. Alas, I believe I prefer the traditional coffee/chocolate version but this is nice for a change. My guests loved it. My other Tiramisu recipe isn't quite so labor intensive but I think the result in terms of consistency and flavor is superior with this one. I will refer to it next time I make my regular Tiramisu which is hard to beat.

Did I miss something somewhere? I purchased an expensive bottle of lemoncello. Made a delicious syrup-- only to be used for dipping ladyfingers?!!! Seems to me this is an error in the recipe. Next time I will use the syrup in the marscapone mixture instead of the liqueur alone. There was plenty of syrup to use for dipping and for adding to the marscapone. Without it, the cheese mixture is somewhat bland.

This was a really light and refreshing cake. Easy to make as well. The recipe looked cumbersome at first, but it wasnt at all. There was more than enough soaking syrup so if you want you could cut that part in half. It definitely needs to sit the full 6 hours-- preferably longer. It is worth the wait.

Not being a fan of limoncello, I was unsure of how this recipe would turn out, but decided to try it anyway. After reviewing the recipe a few times, I decided to prepare everything by hand and the results of my labor would have made my 12th grade home-ec teacher (Miss Z) very proud. One taste of the folded zabaglione, marscapone, and eggwhite mixture was all it took to make the effort worthwhile. Slightly tart, light and lemony, this dessert is a perfect way to compliment any dinner.

I can't stop talking about this dish. It is just that good. At first I was a little overwhelmed with the different parts to the recipe (I only have so much space in my kitchen), but that quickly disappeared as I was folding in the delicious zabaglione into the marscapone and then the egg whites. They combined to create the most delicate, light, airy mousse that I began eating out of the bowl. My ladyfingers were on the smaller size, so I used an 8x8 pan. After a night in the fridge, I served this with some sliced strawberries.

I love Lydia's recipes and I am a lemon fan so I jumped at the chance to make this for Easter dessert. It came together easily and was nice and light. I made it mostly as written during the day on Saturday and it had a chance to "get happy" overnight in the fridge and was delicious on Sunday evening. I also (as another reviewer did) ended up adding a bit of lemon juice to the sponge because I like the tart punch. If I were to make this again, I might also add a bit more mascarpone to the filling--no more than 4 oz--to make it just a tad bit thicker. All in all, this was a great dish and there's plenty of the limoncello left to put over vanilla ice cream at a later date!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was fabulous! I made it friday night and it kept perfectly for Sunday afternoon dinner. I made it exactly per the recipe, except used a little less limoncello and substituted some lemon juice in the zabaglione part. I did that partly because I like a tart taste and partly because I ran out of limoncello ;) I also used a little more zest than called for. It was really light and tasty - a big hit with my guests.

I made this exactly as written and it was quite good, but the syrup was a bit heavy on the alcohol taste for me. The next time I make it I will reduce the limoncello by half and adjust the sugar content depending on how sour the lemons are.
