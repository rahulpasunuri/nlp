If you want to make a beautiful looking dish, serve this spinach gnocchi with sweet potato (or butternut squash) gnocchi, and potato gnochi. To save myself some work, I make a base mix without the puree, and divide it into 3 portions, addding the different purees to each one and adjusting with flour if needed (the amount of water/moisture is different for each kind of puree).The tri-color effect is stunning and delicious!!! As they're all very flavor and colorful, I like to serve them with a very light cream sauce or butter sauce with sage

I made this for some guests after finding it on the foodnetwork site. Unfortunatly, I did not read these reviews first. I should have drained the ricotta overnight and pressed the spinach more thoroughly. To fix the consistancy, I added about 1 cup of flour and a whole egg. I thought they come out a bit too dense. I would try another recipe next time as the flavor wasn't all that great.

After following instructions to the very last letter, I discovered what everyone else here already knew -- this recipe does not work. This is the first flop I've encountered on epicurious, a major disappointment! Don't waste your time on this one -- there's no shortcut for gnocchi.

Tasteless and not worth the effort. Like Watertown, I followed all reviewer comments (drained ricotta and spinach, chilled the dough for 24 hours, added extra flour) and mine didn't fall apart - provided that I rolled them in flour and made them large. All the others became ricotta soup. But that's not my complaint. I found them to be tasteless (use more salt), with a strange texture (use potato!) My husband couldn't gag down the sauce, which tasted canned. Use fresh tomatoes and some herbs ... all in all, skip this one.

This dish has an unfairly low rating! These gnocchi are fantastic, provided that you follow the recommendations given by other reviewers. I did that, used plenty of flour, and also refrigerated them for a while before cooking, and the gnocchi came out perfectly. (Didn't make the sauce - they don't need any!) My man loved them, and we will definitely be eating them again! Slightly time-consuming, but well worth the effort.

I followed the tips and instructions of many of the previous reviewers (i.e., add extra flour, drain ricotta, wring excess water out of spinach, use water at a simmer when cookin) who had success and the gnocchi i made STILL fell apart. Be prepared to have a back-up item on hand for dinner if you use this gnocchi recipe, should the gnocchi fall apart. in retrospect i should have kept the uncooked gnocchi "mix" and used it to fill lasagna or ravioli, soon as i realized the gnocchi were not "cookable".

excellent. gnocchi should NOT be cooked at a rolling boil like dried pasta, for all he folks who complained about them being too soft. you simmer them until they firm up and rise to the top. i recommend poaching the gnocchi in a medium-sized sauce pan to retain their mass if they are soft.

Three hints to help firm up the gnocchi. First, yes, drain the spinach thoroughly by any means you can think of, including wringing it out in a tea towel. Dry spinach is essential. Next, drain the ricotta cheese as suggested by reviewer Troy on 3/31/00. I drained mine in a sieve lined with cheesecloth, putting weights on top. This removed only about 1/3 cup of liquid, but did help. Third, put the mixture in the fridge until very cold. An important fourth: no recipe for spinach ricotta gnocchi ever calls for enough flour. By using the above ideas, however, you won't have to add much more, thus keeping the gnocchis light and fluffy. Most recipes for gnocchi call for salt and some for pepper as well. Good idea for those who found these bland. Instead of making a roll, I take a small spoon and form the dough into balls the size of a large cherry. Flour your hands well and often. Place the balls on a lightly floured tea towel on a baking sheet, cover loosely and refrigerate until cooking time. For sauce, I made two, a fresh, light tomato sauce of my own devising; for the other side of the plate, Gorgonzola Sauce (from the Pork with Gorgonzola Sauce on this site). I chose this particular cheese sauce because it's lighter than most. Try this recipe at least once in your life, and try not to remember the flour and bits of spinach all over your kitchen; that way, you may make it again, and again. It is truly delicious.

I love to read recipes, visualize the ingredients and then get to work preparing "mystery master- pieces". I am a professional "amateur" home chef that loves to create aesthetic wonders. I improvised quite a bit with this recipe. I used russet potatoes steamed and mashed. I sautéed garlic and spinach and added freshly ground pepper along with two eggs. The garlic and spinach mixture was then pureed in my food processor. I added fresh basil and cilantro to my pureed mixture and then added @ 1 and 3/4 cups flour. I then kneaded the dough and rolled into a circular flat area with additional sprinkles of flour (as needed)...my catch was improvisation! I turned these scrumptious dumplings into ravioli by rolling out the wonderful dough and stuffing it with mozzarella, parmesan and ricotta cheese. The skins were slippery but delectable...cover with a very light ratatouille sauce and you'll be in a culinary heaven.

Excellent recipe. I imagine the trouble that some will have will stem from not getting enough water out of the spinach. First attempt was a dinner party-no leftovers.

This is delicious! I added a little more flour and made sure the logs were well formed, and they held together fine. The melted cheese at the end adds that special touch - yum! I've found a favorite recipe for many dinners to come...

I have made gnocchi many times and this one was the worst! I tried using more flour and the gnocchi still fell apart. Guess I'll stick with gnocchi made from potatoes. They are labor intensive, but at least you know you're not wasting time and ingredients.

It's delicious!!! My family loved it and I will do it again for sure. I doubled the flour though.

The gnocchi completely fell apart. This was not worth the work at all. Don't bother.

My husband and I both love this dish! I've prepared it 3 or 4 times and have never had a problem with the gnocci falling apart. I always make sure that the spinach is good and dry and always need more than 2T of flour.

After reading the reviews below, I doubled the flour in the recipe. I also made sure my hands were very well floured when making the dumplings, and removed each dumpling from the water as soon as it floated to the top. With these modifications, the dumplings came out fine. It's a great use for frozen spinach.

I had the same problem as Amy, my gnocchi fell apart. I would not bother doing this again. the taste ok. Lacking presentation.

Very nice. Light and silky. A couple of things that the recipe failed to mention. 1. Drian the Ricotta. 2. The amount of flour will change depending on how wet the ricotta is. Use the 2T measure in the recipe as a starting point and add more flour as needed.

Tomato sauce was good, but the gnocchi completely fell apart and had to be thrown away. Don't bother.

I cheated on this recipe and used prepared gnocchi, but I followed all of the other instructions. The sauce was fabulous and this was a delicious, hearty Saturday evening meal for two.

I have made this recipe twice now. Both times, my husband and I loved it. It gives me another way of using ricotta cheese and spinach, which I always seem to have on hand.

Like eating little puffs of clouds. Very light and delicious. For faster prep, microwave the spinach (no need to add extra water), and put all ingredients in a food processor to form a smooth (very very soft) dough. The light tomato sauce goes perfectly with it.
