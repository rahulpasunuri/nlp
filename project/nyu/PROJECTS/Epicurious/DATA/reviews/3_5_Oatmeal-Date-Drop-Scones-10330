Super easy and tasty--definitely worth making. I mixed the dry and wet ingredients the night before and in the morning combined to have fresh scones in a few minutes--came out just fine. Froze about 1/3 of them for later.

The husband and I really liked these scones. After reading some of the comments I decided to tweak the recipe a bit. I used three heaping tablespoons of brown sugar; substituted 1/4 cup of flour with 1/4 cup of wheat germ; added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts; increased chopped dates to about 2/3-1 cup; added about a teaspoon of lemon extract;I used heavy cream instead of milk; and probably used about 1 tablespoon less flour. I added the dates and walnuts to the wet mixture before whisking the dry ingredients -perhaps this helped with stickiness that others found. The lemon extract really made these awesome- next time I would add zest too. Read More http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/notes/Oatmeal-Date-Drop-Scones-10330#ixzz1m6ChTtZU

Meh. I made this with a extra heaping of dried apricots instead of dates and the results are pretty mediocre. This may be a good base recipe but it needs help. If I make these again I'll do the following: Be generous with the milk (or use cream) and add an extra tablespoon of brown sugar and the zest of a while lemon. Add a lemon glaze (powdered sugar mixed with a skosh of juice). Take the time to shape these into attractive, smooth mounds or triangles. My husband loves classic scones and he is underwhelmed. Me, too.

Quite good, kind of a strange flavor, would like it with more dates, I added 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3 and they were good, not too sweet.

The comments below were very helpful. To compensate for the dryness (and to make them a bit sweeter), I added one cup whole milk rather than 3/4 and 5 tbsp brown sugar rather than 3 - perfect! My kids don't like fruit bits in their baked goods, so the extra bit of brown sugar was a good alternative to the missing dates.

I made these this morning for my boyfriend's birthday. Scones are his favorite and he's not a fan of sweets and loves dates so they were perfect! I made the dough the night before and rolled it up in plastic wrap really tight and then sliced it this morning and baked them so they'd be fresh. I made quite a few edits to the recipe but they turned out great! I omitted the baking soda (on accident!), used slightly less than a tablespoon of baking powder, doubled the dates (chopped up a 9 oz. bag of whole pitted dates), used salted butter so I didn't add salt, used heavy cream instead of milk, zested a whole valencia orange and used regular all purpose flour instead of cake flour. I nearly had the same dates sticking problem so I ended up adding the dates to the milk/cream mix first so that some of the stickiness was reduced. I also accidently added the milk before the butter, which turned out ok, but I had to knead it by hand a bit to get the butter fully mixed. I'm definitely keeping this in my recipe box for the future. Next time however I will use cake flour and milk as these were very dense and possibly do a sugar dusting on half (I like sweets) and depending on my mood I could use a little less zest. I liked the almonds suggestion too, so I might try that. Overall, these were delicious and hearty. A great breakfast for a cold rainy morning.

I have been craving scones, and have some fresh dates from the farmers market. Everyones comment has made me decide to make em. I will follow advice and add more dates, and maybe some zest!

As someone else said, a good basic recipe. I agree they could use a just a tad more sweetness. The texture was perfect. I added some orange zest for a bit more flavor. Probably will continue to experiment with these.

These were good, although a bit dry. I used buttermilk instead of milk, with good results. I thought they could use a tad more sugar. My kids (surprisingly) did not like them.

I make these regularly but substitute large semi sweet chocolate chips for the dates and they are always a huge hit. So easy!

Most scones are dry and was really pleased how tasty these came out. The dates were a nice touch. I used Deglet Noor dates because they are the least sweet type of dates. I sprinkled the top of the scones with paper thin sliced almonds before placing the batch in the oven. It perfectly complimented the oatmeal and dates. Try it!

I substituded dry cherries and swapped in 1 cup of Ryeflour and they were hearty and delious!

modified this a bit, used whole wheat organic flour, about half the sugar in the recipe because I don't care for sweet scones. I added currants not dates. Dropped using a mini ice cream scoop, dusted with a little demara sugar to make them look pretty and baked for 10 minutes. Delicious hot with jam and butter

Exactly what I was looking for in an oatmeal scone, especially after replacing 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla with 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract.

These were good but needed some more spice - I'd add orange rind next time.

If you like dates, don't just add half a cup, but a full cup....that does the trick....I also did not have any cake flour, so added 2 cups of white flour...should have also added some cinnamon...but did put in a little more brown sugar.....I like to pat my dough out on a floured board to 1/2" thick and then cut in pie shapes before baking...will definitely make it again!!

Nice, quick and simple, definitely the easiest scones I've ever made. And healthier compared to others too. I used raisins instead of dates and added some toasted pecans and a couple dashes of cinnamon. Will try again and add more sugar and spices.

This recipe will replace my exisiting scone standard-the scones have perfect texture, is made from ingredients that I already have in-house and were easy to assemble and bake.

As Don in Florida said, this is a "great basic recipe" A little too doughy for my tastes however, so cake flour might not be the best choice. I added raisins instead of dates, chopped almonds & 1 tsp of lemon zest. They were good, but I'm sure there are better recipes out there, just waiting to be made.

Really super good scones...I used half buttermilk and half regular, and about 50 percent more dates....Next time, I will also add pecans with less dates....I already have it planned to make it with marchino cherries,maybe coconut, maybe -oh, you get the idea....Great basic recipe...

Delicious! I added a little cinnamon but otherwise used the ingredients as listed (except I substituted regular flour for cake flour). We thought these were terrific - the oats added a wonderful texture, the dates provided just the right bit of sweetness, and there was no detectable baking powder taste. And despite my flour substitution they were very light and fluffy. Will definitely make again!

I thought these were heavy and boring. I'm not sure what was missing, but with so many other excellent scone recipes out there, I won't bother experimenting with it to figure it out.

I followed the recipe exactly, and was very surprised at the outstanding results. Having made several quite varied scone recipes, I can say this one is easily the best combination of outstanding flavor, very good texture, and surprisingly little fat. In fact I have never seen a recipe this moderate in fat that tasted this rich. The texture is both fluffy and toothsome, thanks to the whole oats. The flavor is delicious, and I detected none of the baking-powder bitterness or saltiness that others have suggested. I cannot imagine how to improve this recipe. I will make it again soon, and will strive to copy its techniques in other dishes. Highly recommended.

Yum! Not overly sweet! Because these are drop scones, this must be one of the very easiest scone recipes. I had to use a pastry cutter to blend in the butter successfully, though. Be careful that your chopped dates are not all sticking together when you add them to the flour mixture. I really struggled to separate mine afterwards because they were all mushed together as a big lump. Store-bought chopped dates would have been easier to manage. I couldn't taste the oatmeal, but as for the baking powder, was that the just detectable, biscuit-like saltiness? If so, sure, it could be reduced just a twinge, but I still love these scones as they are!

excellent - I have made it using the exact receipe and have found it to be delicious.I also made it be substituting cream for milk which added richness.

These are EXCELLENT! I substituted a cup of fresh strawberries for the dates, added 1/8 cup ground almonds and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. These were devoured by our U.K. house guest for breakfast. These would be great for a shortcake with icecream. Will make these often....

I found this recipe in Gourmet ten years ago, tried it right away, and have been using it regularly ever since. It's the best! Really easy and really, really good. My friends invite themselves for tea hoping I'll be moved to bake, and my son's primary school classmates begged for these on snack days. This is the recipe I am most often asked to share, so thanks for adding it to your archive!
