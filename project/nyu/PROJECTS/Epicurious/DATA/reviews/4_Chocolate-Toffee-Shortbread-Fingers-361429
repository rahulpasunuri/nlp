I used this chocolate/toffee/pecan variation with my homemade shortbread and it was a nice change. The toasted pecans and toffee are great together. The chocolate/oil mixture works well, if not a touch too thick. I ended up scraping some off on the side of the dish after I dipped them. I laid them on a Silpat mat and let them cool in the fridge and they set/removed perfectly. These were quick, easy and beg for homemade shortbread to get a truly great taste. It only takes a few minutes to whip up a batch of shortbread. It's worth it. I will make these again.
