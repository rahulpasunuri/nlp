So simple, and it's something you'd think would occur to everyone anyway. When I served it, I converted a whole group of people to summer vegetable grillers.

I made these veggies on the grill but I added Balsamic Vinegar. Then I wrapped them up in Phyllo Dough and then baked them. I topped them with Red Bell Pepper Sauce made with roasted bell pepper in a can..this is very rich but quite tasty... enjoy
