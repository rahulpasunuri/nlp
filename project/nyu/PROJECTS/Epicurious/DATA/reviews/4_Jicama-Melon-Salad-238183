The picture does not do this recipe justice! I've made this several times -- it's good to provide a lighter side during holiday meals. The pomegranate seeds add that pop of both color and taste. The cilantro brightens it up wonderfully. I use honeydew melon. I've served it with pork tenderloin and it makes a wonderful side dish.

Jicama is excellent with just about any fruit. Pomegranate made it really special, & also used Cuties instead of oranges. Made this for 3 different groups over the holiday & all wanted the recipe!

It was not quite was i was expecting. The jicama is a very crunchy firm fruit but the rest of the flavour went well togother. Overall, I would probably not make it again

I've made this several times and only made one small adjustment. I used canned mandarin oranges instead of fresh orange segments. It is fabulous - light and colorful and unique. I've served it as a side for Christmas dinner and it was gobbled up. The pomegranate seeds added a burst of color and flavor. It's also fantastic as part of a mexican-themed dinner. A total keeper.

We served with a mexican themed dinner, a nice lighter touch to the meal. I found frozen pomegranate seeds at Trader joes, so that was easy, and decided to fresh mango instead of mellon. All good

I used blood oranges in combination with the navel oranges, just to give it a little color. Really refreshing salad, I'll definitely make it again.

As other reviewers have noted, a refreshing and unique salad. It was a nice accompaniment to spicier, heavier Mexican food. The quanitites are large and it makes a HUGE salad that doesn't keep. I mean, at ALL...the next day it was bitter and mushy, so either halve the recipe or make sure you are cooking for a crowd!

Like another reviewer pomegranates were not in season and I think they would add a lot. The spices are essential for the blend. I liked it more once I made the jicama into a finer julienne like match stick size because it was a bit too woody and the tastes did not blend but rather exploded from chunk to chunk. Looking at the picture later I realized I could have used more mellon and less jicima and it would have been a bit more balanced. Certainly an interesting flavor combo but I would work more on getting the quantities and sizes in better balance.

This was an excellent addition to my mexi-themed dinner party. The chili powder and cilantro really provide an unexpected (though subtle) flavor. Pomegranates are not in season so I left those out; I used a combo of honeydew and watermelon for the melon and substituted pineapple for the oranges (for a picky guest). It turned out fabulous! Note, though, that I served this for a party of 7 and there was still quite a bit left over - it makes a lot!

This salad is wonderfully refreshing. I served this at a barbecue party and everyone raved. The different flavors just burst in your mouth. It's light, healthy, and the jicama gives the salad a great crunch. I actually halfed the recipe using 1/2 of a large jicama and it still made a HUGE bowl. I still had too much left over after a party with 15 people.

This was a delious and refreshing salad for my Cinco de Mayo party. I loved the combination of melon, jicama and chili powder. Since pomegranates are out of season I left it out but it was still good.
