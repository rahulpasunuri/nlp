Great recipe. I made it exactly as written except that I had med eggs so I added an extra egg. No problem peeling the foil..which I had sprayed with butter flavored Pam.

My new standard lemon bar recipe! Real Simple has a very similar recipe (Coconut Lime-Curd Bars) that I adore, but I wanted to find a new lemon-specific one to make use of the abundant Meyer lemons from our family tree. To double the recipe for a family party, I kept the crust amounts as stated and doubled the filling - this filled two 8x8" glass baking dishes (no parchment paper - just greased with butter). They baked together in the oven for about 20 mins. Fabulous!

On the day of our annual Christmas baking marathon, after making 10 different squares, we decided that we needed to add a citrus, coconut square. This was very simple, easy and quick. I listened to other reviews and used parchment instead of tin foil, and that worked great. I also doubled the filling recipe that was a great idea. I also used a combination of lemon and lime juice. Next time I think I might sprinkle toasted coconut on the top.

After much cursing and gnashing of teeth when trying to gently remove the buttered foil from the edges of the bars, I switched to parchment paper. That has made ALL the difference. No buttering required, and it peels off the sides of the bars with no trouble whatsoever. Also -- I took the note of someone else and always double the amount of filling. I serve it with balsamic strawberries (from this site).

You cannot go wrong with this recipe. The bars themselves are wonderful alone, but I've found a nice, tart raspberry sauce on the side compliments them extremely well. Some fresh raspberries and blueberries on top finish it off with style.

To A Cook from Media, PA: how did the Cooks Illustrated lemon bars compare with these or others you've tried? I'm trying to decide between different recipes (there are so many) and don't have the option to test them all. Thanks so much for your help (and anyone else's who's willing to share)!

I've made this a couple times exactly as written, and it's always a hit. My kids and friends love them. I love the crust -crisp, hint of coconut -but absolutely agree that it needs the double filling -I just haven't made it that way yet. The lemon filling in the recipe is just too thin of a layer to be 4*. Also am wondering why it has baking powder in the filling - you can't taste it, but I haven't seen other lemon bar recipes w/ it in it. Next time I will try this recipe with double the filling - -but first I'm trying cooksillustrated's 'Perfect Lemon Bars' to compare. :-)

These turned out so well! I also doubled the filling, and it was a perfect amount! These were a great mix of sweet and tangy, with the surprise of the coconut in the crust. Everyone at the party I took these to loved them! make sure you butter the foil extra well...the sides of the filling stuck a little bit when I was removing the foil.

Rating: 2
These were good, but not great. The whole lifting-the-foil wasn't as easy as it sounded (to be fair-I somehow poked a hole in the foil, so the filling leaked and melded to the pan) I liked the coconut, but much prefer the double lemon bars on this site: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Double-Lemon-Bars-232572

These were great! Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Loved the coconut with the lemon topping.

Now, I am the Lemon Bar Queen of the Universe-always looking for the perfect lemon bar, and this comes the closest than any other. Simple, loaded with tang, and gone in no time! I didnt change a thing in the recipe. Only the 4th time I have given any recipe 4 forks.

I needed to make a large batch for a fundraiser, so quadrupled the recipe. I had fresh lime and thought the "lime in de coconut" could be great, and indeed it was. Followed the recipe and used three 9 x 11 pans. To serve, thinned some store bought lime curd with fresh lime juice, warmed together in the microwave and well stirred. Just drizzled it over the cut bars off the end of a spoon in stripes, then lightly dusted w/ powdered sugar. Tasted great, looked great, all gone!

Heavenly! Everyone has asked me for the recipe.

I loved this recipe. The filing was tart and good and the crust was amazing. I will use a little more coconut next time as I feel it was lost under the lemon. Definitely a keeper in my cookie box.

Successful at doubling in a 9X13 pan, baking for 45 mins. Fresh lemons are the best with zest and pulp! Everyone asks for the recipe. Joanne

These tasted great, but they looked awful! For some reason they had a weird greyish hue - not bright yellow like I was expecting. The lemon filling also bubbled so I would tap the pan on the counter before baking.

I made this for a bridal shower with 1 1/2 topping recipe and unsweetened coconut - huge hit! I made it again 2 days later it was so good. I did have a little trouble buttering the foil.

Rating: 3
Well I thought they were delicious although my husband thought they were too sweet. I suppose it all depends whether or not you have a sweet tooth. Tip: don't dust with powdered sugar until you actually want to serve. Otherwise it just gets absorbed into the lemon bars and you'll have to dust again.

If you like a pucker with your lemon bars, don't make this one. What a disappointment!

These are good, not the best however. Although it's the coconut crust that really makes them. Definitely double the filling!

these are great, as stated below, the filling must be doubled, and i think it could use even more lemon flavor (zest and juice). Loved the coconut in the crust. And i used a blender instead of food processor, worked fine.

I made this last night as a gift for a couple of people in the office. The coconut (toasted makes such a difference) in the crust really made these so much better than regular lemon bars. Since other reviewers wanted more filling, i made a double recipe but baked it in a 9x13 pan. It was a really perfect ratio. The other thing I loved was that it was so simple and convenient... only a food processor was dirtied, the butter didn't need to sit out all day and nothing required rolling or sifting. Give these a try!

OH.......these are DELICIOUS. My pregnant girlfriend commented that she loved lemon bars and I was on a quest to find the perfect recipe for her. Well, this it it. The coconut crust can be eaten by itself it is so good. We made them together and our reward was absolute decadence. We doubled the filling as we read from other reviewers and it was pure heaven. We WILL make these over and over again. Devine.

Rating: 3
These came out very nice. The crust very crumbly and the filling nice and tangy. I made it with brown sugar, but it takes away from the visual effect, so I suggest you stick to white sugar. The crust was a little thicker than I thought it would be - though I made 1.5 times the filling - I think next time I'll make 2x as much filling.

I served these bars for a tea, and the guests loved them. These have superb lemon flavor, and the coconut in the crust gave the bars a delicious difference from other lemon bars I have tried. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Wonderful!

Like many others, I doubled the lemon filling and got perfect results. Have served these to guests many times to rave reviews.

I will never make "plain old" lemon bars again. The coconut in the crust makes these so much more delicious. I, too, used 1 1/2 times the ingredients for the filling (on the suggestion of others below) and found the ratio perfect. These are in my permanent collection - after, that is, I get finished printing copies for all my guests that have asked for the recipe. YUMMY!!!

I loved these bars!! I added a 1/2C of coconut into the lemon mixture just before baking. It gives it a more chewy texture.

Fantastic, easy. Will definitely make again.

I found this very easy to make and very good, but a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll try it with unsweetened coconut, as previous reviewers have done. I also prefer more of a coconut flavour, so I'm going to top it with shredded coconut instead of icing sugar.

We love this square, they don't last a day at our house. The lemon is pefectly balance with the sweetness. Easy to make! A great square.

This is a keeper recipe! We love something tart and lemony at Christmas to balance all the chocolate, etc. I made the recipe without doubling the filling recipe and got a "thumbs up" from guests. I added dried Craisins on top [nice partner with lemon] before the icing sugar. Enjoy!

I got suberb results from this recipe. What's important to me is how well the lemon filling sets, after having my shared of too-soft, jelly donut-like selections from coffee houses. This filling set perfectly, not too gooey and not too firm. Sugar to lemon juice ratio is terrific, resulting in a nice tart-sweet flavor. I too doubled the filling. I also added two tbsp. slivered almonds to the crust recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as written, with one small exception. I made the mistake of adding 1 tablesoon of flour in the filling instead of the 1 teaspoon called for. I have no idea how this changed the recipe. I guess I'll find out next time I make them. Mine turned out fantastic. I had no problems with the amount of filling. Everthing worked out great. Made them for friends last night, they raved and we ate them all! I cut them into 12 instead of 16. 16 made them too small for me.

Rating: 3
I've made these twice, once as written and once with double the filling (as suggested by previous reviewers). Both were excellent, so I don't think I'd bother doubling the filling next time. (If I doubled the whole recipe I might make 2.5 times the filling.) The cooking time was bang on, and they lifted easily out of the pan using the foil method. The bars were really popular both times I made them -- in fact, they were fought over by a group of male friends who don't normally eat sweets!

Rating: 4
On the advice of past reviewers, I doubled the filling recipe. The results were perfectly proportioned bars. I cut the bars into 1 inch squares put them into a tin as a thank you for a kindness done. They were well received!

First, this recipe did not have enough filling to cover the crust. And second, the baking time was too long so part of the crust burned. I was making these for a party and had to scrap the entire batch and make the traditional lemon bar recipe which is always delicious.

Mmmmmmm!!!! These were wonderful. Nice, sweet lemony flavour. Easy clean up too! Will definitely make this again.

The only thing I would do different next time is to double the lemon filling. I felt like the proportion of the crust could use more filling. Watch when you toast the coconut it burns quickly.

This recipe lived up to its expectations. I would also recommend reducing the baking time to approximately 20 minutes - depending on your oven. These were very easy to make and tasted great. I used a 9 x 13 pan but would not recommend doing so. Use the pan indicated for best results. This is a keeper. I will be making it for the second time this week!

Made these for a baby shower, and didn't serve as the crust was so hard. I did use a glass pan, rather than a metal pan (contrary to what the recipe stated). However, the next day, the SO had a bite, and pronounced them wonderful. The crust had softened after a day in the fridge, and they really were delicious.

Excellent! I just replaced the coconut in the crust with a handful of almonds (many people do not like coconut).

Rating: 3
I experimented a little and added an 8 oz. block of cream cheese to the filling (bring to room temp. first), which made it a little creamier and toned down the tartness of the lemon (for a husband that has mixed feelings about citrus). The crust was great; loved that toasted coconut.

Rating: 3
I have mixed feelings about these-they were delicious, but could have been better, I think. I doubled the recipe, but otherwise made it as written (used a 9x13 pan). Fantastic lemon flavor, but the texture wasn't very appealing to look at-the top cracked a bit and looked pitted. The proportion was a little off-I would have preferred more lemon and less crust. The crust didn't seem quite done-maybe should have baked it a little longer at a lower temperature and the filled bars not as long. Love the coconut in the crust.

Delicious ~ If you love lemon and coconut, make these! Did reduce the time in the oven....

This was terrific.Took advice of some reviewers. First, I made this in a 9 by 13 non-stick pan. Second, I incorporated 1 cup unsweetened coconut into the crust. It was great. You do not need the added sugar. You do not need to coat the pan. Just loosen sides with a spatula, and you should be fine. This is a definite keeper.

A wonderful refreshing little sweet and tangy dessert bar. Served it over Mother's Day brunch and my party of 8 LOVED them! Best to double the recipe - I should of trusted the reviews below as they were right. This recipe is a keeper. Bake only 20 min. or so and make your life easier - use parchment paper rather than alumofoil to line pan.

Sorry if I'm bringing down the average, but I had high expectations for these bars, and they weren't fulfilled. My lemon bar recipe is better. I thought 25 minutes was too long, and I think that was why they turned out dry. If I didn't have the perfect recipe already, I might try these again, since others were so impressed.

Everyone loved this recipe. The addition of the coconut to the crust was a nice touch. I usually use another lemon bar recipe without coconut but will continue to add the coconut. Toasting the coconut certainly whets the appetite of anyone waiting for them!

Simple, scrumptious, and addictive....! I used less sugar (2/3 cup in the base) and unsweetened shredded coconut (1/2 cup). They were still plenty sweet enough for me and my potluck group.

I also forgot to toast the coconut but the bars were heavenly none the less. The whole pan was gone at one sitting (6 people). I used a pyrex pan lined with foil and the bars came out fine. Delicious and easy - what a great combination!

I love everything lemon and I love these bars. I forgot to toast the coconut and as a result the crust was deliciously chewy. I also doubled the lemon juice and flour only and added a small amount of coconut to the filling. In my opinion these changes made this recipe different from the norm and worthy of 4 stars. I will definately double the recipe next time(I know first hand that they are great straight out of the freezer!)

These were a big hit at a recent party. The lemon filling is more lemony than most lemon bar recipes(which is a great thing!), and the coconut crust balances it beautifully. I will definitly be making these again!

Doubled this recipe and used a 9 X 12 inch metal pan lined with foil. It was difficult to remove from the pan with the foil. Next time I will use a Pyrex glass 9 X 12 and just butter the dish well and not use the foil. Maybe oven temp will need to be reduced. Otherwise, these are delicious and were very well liked by 20 plus people when taken to a dinner party.
