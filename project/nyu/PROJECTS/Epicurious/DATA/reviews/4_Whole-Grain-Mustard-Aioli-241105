Very good but go easy on the salt! I used Kosher salt for the recipe and then made the mistake of salting and peppering at the end before tasting. Too salty. Otherwise delicious.

Whole grain mustard aioli is to french fries as cream cheese frosting is to red velvet cupcakes. Loved this aioli recipe...my homemade french fries were just a delivery device. It was so easy to make and took absolutely no time. (next time I think I will serve it with asparagus in hopes that it will make me feel a little less guilty)

This is very easy and a fantastic gourmet touch to burgers and/or homemade french fries. Several people have asked me for the recipe, which to me is the best compliment!

Excellent and easy aioli recipe. I used it as a dip for cooked-until- just tender asparagus (immerse in ice water after cooking and store in paper towel in refrigerator until ready to serve). Place dip in bottom of a wide-mouth vessel (clear-glass vase works well) and place asparagus tip-side-down into aioli. Very popular at BBQs--looks and tastes great.

You will never settle for ketchup on fries again! This is fabulous. Also great as a dip with some crudite.

Fabulous. This was a huge hit at our dinner party. It goes great with homemade french fries.
