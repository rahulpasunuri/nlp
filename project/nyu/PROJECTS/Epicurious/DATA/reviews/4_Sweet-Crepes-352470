I, too, was a novice crepe maker. These are SO great! I was really concerned about the crepes sticking to the pan and tearing when I flipped them. No need to be concerned--they turned out perfect! I was trying to make a quarter batch, so I didn't follow the precise proportions here and, again, still great. I love that the recipe has ingredients I almost always have around. I filled mine with Nutella and topped with fresh local raspberries. Heavenly! I will be making these again and again.

After watching Hell's Kitchen I thought crepes would be "hell" to make. Not with this recipe! Very tasty and held together very well in the pan. I don't have a crepe pan so I just used my Calphalon infused anodized frying pan with a light coating of butter and they came up perfectly. Of course, mine were fairly jagged around the edges, but that didn't matter in my mouth! The sugar/lemon mixture is very good.

I was afraid of crepes before this, and this recipe proved to be very easy to follow with incredible results. I also recommend a simple lime and sugar addition to this. Deliciousness.

My first attempt at crepes ... and it worked very nicely. Found the video most helpful, although never did get the hang of turning them using my fingers as chef did. A spatula works very nicely too! Very flavorful ... serving with lemon juice and sugar was simply the best. Did a complete batch one at a time. By the end, I had completed Crepe 101 ...

This is a very good recipe for both savory and sweet crepes. I make a whole batch at one time and usually freeze those not used. All one has to do is make stacks with inserts of waxed paper and then freeze them in bags of six each. Just remove from freezer an hour prior to use. A real time saver.
