Me and my friend loved the sauce. I didn't have a canned tomatoes stew. I chopped 2 large tomatoes, onion & quarter of bell. Sauteed it for 30 min with cumin and tabasco. Added stew to the sauteed garlic+onion+cilantro and simmer them together. Put snapper filet in between the sauce for 10 min. Sprinkle w/cilantro and add ground pepper. Pair this spicy fish with brussels sprouts with caramelized shallots. Yamm!

I gave this 4 stars, because for such a simmple recipe it really delivered great taste! I was really skeptical about all the great reviews, but had all the ingredients and was feeling lazy so thought 'why not'. The worse case would be that it was 'so-so' flavor. Glad I made it, because the flavor was great. I did add fresh jalapeno pepper because we like spicy. After removing the snapper I continue to let the sauce simmer until thicken - didn't take long. Sprinkled with fresh cilantro and chopped green onions before serving & squeeze of fresh lime juice. Will definitely make again. Served with Mexican Rice (Aug 2004) recipe from this site and brussel sprouts.

This was ok - but tasted really healthy (and not in a good way, if you know what I mean). I served with jasmine rice in seafood stock, which might have been the best part. I won't be making this one again.

I agree with other reviews that the diced tomatoes with green chilies makes this easier. I also used white pepper on the fishjust another layer of spiciness

In a complete fit of laziness, and noticing that the ingredients were essentially sort of salsa-esque, I dumped a tub of pico de gallo from the supermarket into the skillet in lieu of the ingredient list; I cooked the snapper on top of that. It was fantastic! Practically an instantaneous dinner (with tortillas).

excellent! i was a little skeptical at first at how easy it was to make but it tastes fantastic. i used half a jalapeno instead of the mild green chilies but followed everything else to a t.

Great, easy recipe! Much more than I expected from the short ingredient list. Used a can of petite diced tomatoes with green chilies to make it even faster. Served over jasmine rice.

This was awwesome and so easy. I served it with white rice. My husband came home with red snapper from the fish market and I didn't know how I was going to prepare it. Epicurious to the rescue. I used a jalapeno instead of the canned green chilies and a 14.5 oz can of Del Monte diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chilies. So glad I also had cilantro in my fridge. Can hardly wait to have this again!

quick, easy, healthy and tasty. highly recommend. you can really use any type of fish, and it doesn't hurt to up all the ingredients to make more sauce. i served with couscous, per the suggestion of a previous reviewer. to add a bit of spice, maybe add a tablespoon of jalapeno.

I made this recipe with a few modifications and it was absolutely delicious! I used canned Rotel tomatoes with green chilies already added, omitted the cilantro as I don't really care for it and cooked the snapper on the grill. Served it on top of a bed of jasmine rice. Wow! So easy yet so good!

As a beginner, I found this recipe extremely easy and very tasty. I've made it with both Red Snapper and chicken breasts. For the chicken, I browned two boneless chicken breasts in a separate pan for about 3 minutes on one side and then cooked them the rest of the way with the sauce for about 5 minutes. I also added two diced jalopenos, which I sauteed along with the onions.

Light, tasty meal that is easy to prepare. Made as written except for adding a diced jalepeno to the onion, garlic and green chili saute.

Made this in 2 pans, one for my husband and one for me. His was just as written; mine had no garlic and substituted parsley for the cilantro. We both loved it! I wasn't sure it would have enough "zip" for him with the green chilies instead of jalapeno, but it worked out great! The fish was very tender. I cooked mine a few minutes longer.

My whole family loved this recipe. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed because thats what I had ... the snapper was tender and I'd make it again.

You could make this with any white fish and it would be delicious (I used Tilapia). The sauce is perfect and not spicy at all. I served it with rice, and actually think next time I would have bread as the starch because some of the taste was lost when put over the rice. Very easy - a real winner!

Exceeded my expectations. So easy and so tasty!

It would be impossible to exaggerate how delicious and easy this dish is! Because it turned out to be impossible to find red snapper at any of the grocery stores or markets in my town, I used tilapia, but I still thought it turned out great. Very highly recommended!

This is a nice, quick easy dish. For lunch, I followed this recipe with the Mexian-style tomatoes and wrapped the pieces of the snapper and souce in a spinach tortilla with a little sour cream and fresh pico de gallo. It was great.

I really loved this sauce. The flavours blended well and made a very bland boring fish taste lovely. That said, I didn't have cilantro so I changed the flavourings adding black olives and capers for a more mediterranean dish. It was great.

we didn't have stewed tomatoes so we used a can of chopped w/ jalepenos - excellent! It was very spicy and tender. We also didn't want the house to smell like fish, so put the pan on the grill. It took longer, but the results were wonderful!

Loved this dish. Unfortunately, I was not able to get red snapper so I used tilapia which was delicious. Made a mistake by buying diced jalapenos instead of diced green chilies which made the sauce quite a bit hotter than I prefer. Other than that, the sauce was great and I'm looking forward to making it again using snapper and chilies!

Great one dish meal. I used spicy red pepper canned tomatoes and I will experiment with different seasoned tomatoes. Made it with mashed red potatoes. Sauce has a slightly fishy taste which makes the sauce like a seafood stew. The fresh cilantro is not to be skimped on... yummy!

Rating: 2
I found the sauce to be too heavy and overpowering for the fish. I am fortunte to get absolutely beautiful fish in Toronto so that was not the problem. If I were to make it again, I would use fresh roma tomatoes and fresh chilis and I would probably use a light white wine for liquid.

My girlfriend is an awesome cook, and so I rarely cook. However, I decided to give this recipe a try for Valentine's Day. Both she and I agreed that it came out excellent. We found whole wheat cous cous to be an excellnt side dish (I posted a simple recipe for whole wheat couscous at www.allrecipes.com).

Easy, healthful, and tasty. Versatile too: as others have commented,the sauce could be used on other fish; my husband recommended the sauce for omelettes as well. I agreed with others on need to cook down sauce to get rid of excess liquid. Also, you could use the full recipe of sauce of less fish; I used only about 3/4 pound fish for full recipe sauce, since sauce is such an important component of dish..

What a winner--easy to prepare and delicious! I used Ro-tel tomatoes (original recipe) which gave the dish a real kick--nice and hot. Also used talapia instead of red snapper and it worked out beautifully. We will definitely make this one again!

Wonderful and fast fish dish! I love to make it snapper, salmon or rainbow trout (whatever the market has on-hand). I followed the suggestions of prior reveiwers for adding lime zest and serving on yellow rice. I also can not find Mexican stewed tomatoes, so I use regular ones and add 2 tsp. Chili powder. It has become a staple in our house. One trick that I've learned is to cook the fish skin side up, so you can easily remove the skin before serving. ENJOY!

Wow! I made this dish based solely on the rave reviews. About half way through, I was a little skeptical that the various ingredients wouldn't mesh well. But the end result was out of this world! I served it with spicy spanish rice which was the perfect compliment. My boyfriend was in heaven. I'll make it again soon!

What a delightful dish! It treats fresh fish well--the fish was the star of the course, and the acids of the vegetables helped keep it firm, but the tomato salsa was just sharp and complex enough to be a perfect complement and enjoyable on its own. I served this dish with brown basmatic rice, which was good, but next time I'll try something like couscous or mashed potatoes that could benefit from the juiciness of this recipe. A real keeper, and a good recipe to play with.

Another great weeknight entree, I had a full meal ready in 20 minutes. I couldn't find "Mexican-style" tomatoes, so I used tomatoes with medium jalapenos. This made the sauce a little too spicy for my wife, but it was just right for me. Serve with Spanish rice and yellow corn to make a quick and delicious meal.

I breaded the filets with Japanese Panko breadcrumbs, sauteed them in a TBSP of olive oil until crispy on each side, and them baked them in the oven to finish them cooking. I topped the filets with the sauce and fresh chopped cilantro. I substituted Muir Fire Roasted tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes. It was delicious.

This recipe is to die for. I generally make a new recipe once and my family never sees the dish again. I made this recipe twice in one week. I'm not fond of cilantro so I used fresh parsley. The second time I made it, I added around 3/4 of a cup of fresh peas prior to putting the fish in the pan. I served fish and sauce over fettuccine. On a scale of 1 - 10, this is around a 15.

I added some 1/2 pound bay scallops and 1/2 pound shrimp (as others had suggested)--would suggested about 3-4 min. into cooking and keep an eye out to stop cooking when all parts are done-- and got a rave on this recipe. It is very very easy and not timeconsuming. Served it over mashed potatoes which was great with the sauce (which I did reduce some because the juices from fish and seafood added alot of moisture.) I added grated lime zest to sauce because I had some extra. This was termed "best fish ever" and, tho I had enough for six with the additional seafood, we had a cancelled dinner party due to weather and we ate enormous quantities!

The store had no snapper, so we bought salmon and scallops. It was DELICIOUS !!! I scored huge points with my girlfriend. I would definitely recommend letting the sauce thicken, after the fish is done cooking. I would rate it a 3.5, but that is not an option.

The sauce was awesome. Made it for the family, son-in-law, daughter & 21 yr. old son. They're used to seafood as I fish alot but they went nuts over this. Wanted it with shrimp, scallops, crab et al. Will use this for a lot of seafood bases. Big Dave from Carlsbad e-mail dobx52@aol
