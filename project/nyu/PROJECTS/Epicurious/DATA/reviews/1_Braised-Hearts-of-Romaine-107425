Nah...it has all of the right ingredients but, you know how Randy Jackson always says "it just didn't do it for me, dog" when someone's really tried hard but they're just not that good? That's this dish. It looks like it should be good, I really tried to like it, I really *wanted* to like it. It just didn't do it for me.

Not very good. My husband actually spit it out.
