Great flavor for the very small amount of time it takes to make. Definitely add the garlic like others have said.

I didnt think I would like it as much as I do from looking at the color after blending, but it tastes really good. Add the 2 garlic cloves as other reviewers have suggested, it gives it a good flavor and the smell from the oven is great. If you do not plan to bake the ingredients, then it may be too salty and oily, but if you plan on baking them (you should!!) then follow the ingredients as stated. Otherwise, there will not be enough oil to soak into the bread and keep it moist.

I took this to a meeting yesterday and brought the leftovers home. I didn't think my husband would care for it much, but he really liked it. We both commented that garlic might be a good addition, so I followed the advice of other reviewers and added two cloves, which I put through a garlic press. We just had it for a snack and both agree the garlic has to stay. Next time I think we'll try it on sourdough. Oh, and thanks to another reviewer for the suggestion of putting parmesan cheese on during toasting. That would be fabulous, too, especially Parmesano Reggiano!

Awesome for any party/dinner party... Perfect b/c you can make it the night before. Always a hit.

Oh, this is wonderful! I made this for a friend's house warming party, along with many other things. This was gobbled up and I worried that some of the guests might turn their noses up at it but, not the case at all! Everyone loved it!

Run home and make this recipe! Now! :-) Instead of oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, I used plain sun dried tomatoes, soaked in hot water until softened. I also added some juice from the capers for a bit of extra acidity. Also, I used pickled anchovies bought at the deli counter instead of canned anchovies. (The pickled anchovies is much firmer, slightly acidic, and less salty.) I served the tapenade with my home-baked French bread. Yummy!

Excellent! I added garlic and lemon juice to the mix. Wonderful on a toasted bagette.

Maybe it was the olives I used, but this dish was too salty.

This dish is a bit salty. I cut the olive oil down to 2 tablespoons and added a clove of garlic. To save time, serve with pita chips.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. It is easy and very good.

Wonderful. I toasted a little parmesan on top of each bread slice and added a thin strip of roasted red pepper atop the finished crostini (for color). Went fast, really tasty.

This is a wonderfully easy and delicious recipe to accompany a good glass of wine either pool side or fire side.

I thought this recipe was great. We also served it with Belgian endive (which I liked better than the bread) You use them to scoop and eat. It seemed to give it more of a crunch, freshnes and texture to the palate.

Pretty good - my guests enjoyed it. I thought it was kind of the same old thing, but it was still a hit and was made easily from ingedients in my pantry.

Very tasty and VERY easy to make. Not liking capers in excess, I used only two tablespoons, which did it for my tastebuds.... I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup, upon the advice from earlier reviewers.It's very good advice, I might add; I think that it would be excessively oily otherwise. Also, I just chucked in a well-drained, 7 oz jar of oil packed tomatoes - why would I want one or two, leftover tomatoes hanging around? I served this, Fig & Walnut Tapenade w/ Goat's Cheese, and Olive & Artichoke Tapenade (both from this site) with crostini as a starter during a dinner party last week. All three were popular.

Served this at a party where guests would be arriving at various times, so I just put the tapenade in bowl on platter with toasted baguette along side instead of putting in oven first. It was a big hit.

Easy & great to make ahead of time! I also made the Crostini with Spicy Green Olivada (from this website as well) to have a little variation, and my family ate it all!

This recipe is very nice to serve to the guests at the beginning/ I recommend to spread a bit of garlis on the bagetts before the oven

A belting recipe - simple, quick and delicious.

Made this as part of a New Year's Day brunch. Thought the bold flavors might not appeal to my less adventurous guests, but everyone liked it; some couldn't stop eating it and asked for the recipe. Buy pitted olives, if available, to make it even easier, and just as good.

Worth the trip? Well I guess so! Thanks for the laugh, Austria.

Using San Marzano Tomatoes is best. You can get these in Italy and are well worth the trip.

My husband, who loves sun dried tomatoes, really liked this alot! It's very easy to make, although the bread was a liitle dry, but maybe that was me. I would make this for a quick appetizer again.
