I really liked this pesto a lot. At first I wasn't sure if it was like a watered-down version of basil pesto, or if it is more fresh-tasting. I've decided on the fresh. I liked mine with crackers, and I'll enjoy it on pasta, as well. It's a good recipe to use when your plants have produced so much zucchini that you want to cry. I like freezing pesto in individual serving sizes and defrosting them through the winter. It's like a bit of summer in the darker months. Try it!

This was easy and delicious. My husband who is not fond of zucchini (at all), really enjoyed it. Only changes I made to the recipe: I only used about 1/3cup olive oil, and I scooped out the core of the zucchini.

Great use of both basil and zucchini. I do think it needs a bit of salt to really bring out the flavour.

Good recipe to use extra zucchini. Very tasty

This pesto is great as a filling for ravioli. Another use is to marinate peeled deveined medium shrimp in it and then, leaving the marinade on, wrap with pancetta, skewer, and grill. Also good as with any grilled white fish such as halibut or orange roughy - just serve on the side instead of tartar sauce!
