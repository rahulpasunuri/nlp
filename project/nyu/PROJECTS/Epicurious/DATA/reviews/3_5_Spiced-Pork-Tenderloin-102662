The recipe was easy but despite all the spices we found it rather bland. It needs a kick from something--maybe citrus, maybe wine. I would skip the chicken stock next time.

This was easy and delicious. I used a cast iron pan instead of a 13x9 and it worked wonderfully -- what a beautiful deep sear on the bottom of the tenderloin!

This isn't a "serve to guests" dish but certainly was savory and easy enough to execute for family dinner. After reading the reviews I also used OJ but not as a sub for broth - mixed in with it. I also used a bit more garlic and sprinkled some flour into the au jus at the end to make it a thicker drizzling sauce.

I decided to make this even though there are mixed reviews here. I took the advice of other who used OJ instead of Chicken Broth. I also added a touch of pineapple juice and white wine. I would certainly make this again.

Delicious and easy to make -- I made the spice mixture as written. Seasonings are very tasty. For the sauce, I used the drippings, a little Alsatian riesling, and a fruit's worth of tangerine juice -- I skipped the chicken broth. I'll make this recipe again! The dish pairs well with riesling.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I have made this over and over and have turned guests on to it over and over as well. The flavors really blend well into a tasty and aromatic dish. Everyone loves it.

I did not realize that the pork tenderloin that I defrosted already had an Ancho Chili rub on it, but I decided to use it anyway since I had already made the spice rub. As suggested by another reviewer I used half chicken broth and half juice from canned unsweetened mandarin oranges and added the orange slices to the broth. I thought it was delicious and the oranges were a nice addition.

Amazing! This was absolutely delicious...the date I made it for ate about 2/3 of the meat! The flavors worked so well together, and the instrutions about timing and temperature made for a juicy, tasty pork tenderloin. I only made two alterations: I added orange juice to the spice rub to sweeten it up a little, I was afraid all that cumin would make it too spicy. I also added about a tbsp of flour to help the gravy/sauce thicken up. It was absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to try it on a larger audience.

I was unimpressed with the recipe. Without the cilantro, it seemed to be missing something.

Thought this was overpowering, ended up scraping spices off meat just to eat it. Meat was fork tender but flavor was just too strong for my family.

Delicious and easy. I used half chicken broth and half juice from canned Mandarin oranges and added the orange slices to the broth. Served with basmati rice topped with toasted pecans and the spiced orange pork broth. Did not use any cilantro at all.

Very, very good. This was extremely simple to prepare and came out nice and juicy. I added a splash of white wine to the pan sauce. I didn't find the spices overwhelming at all. The leftovers were great in fajitas the next day.

Very easy and very tasty. Excellent weeknight meal. I didn't bother with the broth/pan juices thing - just made the pork with the spice rub.

I can't believe I didn't like this, considering all the other reviews. My best description for it is "edible", but my husband is still ranting about how awful he thought it was. His best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) comment was "If you hate the taste of pork tenderloin, make this recipe, because all the spices hide the flavor."

this was very easy and good - i added a splash of OJ and some thick cut carrots and red potatos to the pan for a one dish meal. also, didn't have allspice and used nutmeg instead. my daughters licked thier plates clean, literally.

This is a very easy main dish to prepare. I made it as a post-Thanksgiving meal on Saturday and everyone enjoyed it. One person asked for the recipe. I served it with butternut squash risotto and I think the combination of the risotto with the spiced meat was what made the meal a two and a half to three fork meal. I will definitely use this as part of our weekly meal menu.

Yum...I have made this many times now and always to great reviews. Even those who are not huge fans of cilantro loved it. I love it but realize it's not for everyone...but the cilantro in this is the perfect compliment to the spices on the pork even for non-cilantro lovers. Make it as is, bake some yams, steam some asparagus and be sure to watch your meat thermometer. Plus it makes your house smell exactly the way you want it to when you open the door to guests.

I doubled the garlic, and doubled the whole amount of the spice mixture, as per the suggestion of another review. It was just the right amount for one tenderloin. I don't like my pork medium well, though, so I cooked it for an extra 8 minutes. It was tender, flavorful, and my husband absolutely loved it.

Super easy and excellent. I'm not a fan of cilantro, so left it out. Thickened gravy slightly and added a touch of sour cream.

There isn't anything essentially wrong with this dish, but it truly lacked something - I may marinate the pork next time, either that or create a wrinkle by adding a tad brown sugar or molasses.

Rating: 3
Great flavor. I doubled garlic to two cloves and used allspice instead of cloves as well. Next time I will double the recipe as I like a lot of flavor and would like to coat the entire tenderloin. Boyfriend said I outdid myself! Little does he know how easy it was!

This is a sure hit--everyone I make it for loves it. It reminds lots of people of Morroccan cuisine, I suppose because of the cumin. It is also one of the quickest and easiest ways to fix a tenderloin.

I thought this was just good, but certainly not great. I made it just as written, with no substitutions. It seemed like it was missing something. The cumin, clove, cinnamon all together seemed a little one-dimensional and flat, and it seemed (after I'd made the recipe) that just a bit of brown sugar or honey would have been a great addition.

This was amazing! I never thought something that delicious could be prepared so easy! The whole family loved it and I've already invited some friends over to share it with them.

Really different and easy. I had an accident so wasn't able to make sauce and it was great without the sauce. The lemon risotto was a brainstorm accompaniment.

It's hard to believe that such super quick prep resulted in such a wonderful, complex flavor. Delicious! I served it with lemon and herb couscous like another reviewer and it was a perfect compliment.

This was a delightful dish, with a wonderful flavor! It took a bit longer than 20 minutes however, but created a very moist, tender meal. My husband gave it a definite 4 forks!

A very simple and good tasting dish. I will increase the spice concentration next time for more of the flavor to come through. Served with Lemon & Herb Couscous (on this site). The cool lemon was a great foil for the spice of dish.

For best results, cook this dish in the winter and serve with something hearty like couscous or butternut squash and a big wine. I substituted Italian parsley for cilantro and it worked well. Definitely a simple favorite!

This was merely *okay*. I would definitely make it again, if only figger out how to improve upon it. Wasn't bad ... then again, it's awfully hard to ruin a pork tenderloin. Served with Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Brown Sugar and Pecans and steamed broccoli.

I used Harvey's Bristol Cream (had it in the house) instead of the brandy and it was very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy it was to make. The pork was extremely tender. I also follwed the advice to use half and half - much quicker for reduction! I would use this recipe for guests.

Two Forks - like it, don't love it! Easy but nothing spectacular. The flavor of the spices didn't really come through. I used a full recipe for 1 tenderloin.

Tasted a lot like Jerk Pork to me, although I didn't have the fresh Cilantro. Not spectacular, although my thermometer failed me and it was probably cooked too long.

Excellent, primarily because its so easy and quick and great taste. I like that when I get home and have to prepare dinner quick. While fixing dinner my husband (the consumate conservative) said "what the hell are you putting on that meat, you know I like it plain" then after he ate it he said--"that was very good."

I served this for Sunday dinner and everyone loved it. The combination of spices is diffent from what I usually use and was a nice change. also, garnishes usually don't do much for me except look nice but the cilantro complimented nicely.

Excellent recipe. I used a mortar and pestle to mash garlic and whole cloves adding other spices and then making a paste with oil and spread this on the meat. Also coated bottom of baking pan with 1/4 cup of beer, could use wine, too. Served with sauteed, sugared apples; steamed white new potatoes and green veggie. Was a big hit with the family begging for me to make it again.

The aroma of the spices is marvelous, the taste exotic Near Eastern. Removed at 145 deg, we like it just passed pink, let it rest while making the sauce, turned out perfect.

This was a great recipe for pork tenderloin, and very easy to prepare! I doubled the recipe since we had two guests, (the recipe said it only served two) and we had plenty left over with everyone taking seconds (and one eating thirds!). I would definitely recommend this recipe to others.

This is OK, but I have had better recipies, it needs more garlic and less cumin.

The female master-chef being off duty, this male sous-chef tried it. Great! Used bulk chicken stock instead of canned, and accompanied it with Balsamic roast potatoes and B-sprouts. I advise other chefs to make a larger amount of the spice mixture for greater enjoyment.
