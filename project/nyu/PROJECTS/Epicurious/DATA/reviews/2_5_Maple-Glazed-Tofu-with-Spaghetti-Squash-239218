This is a good BASE for a recipe. I added my own originalities to this recipe...included cinnamon to the squash. I used water instead of broth for the glaze and 3 garlic cloves. The tofu I rolled in cornstarch which gave it a beautiful crunchy texture on the outside with a touch of yummy soft in the middle. Then I sauteed and steamed Kale to add some color and texture to the dish. And I added a yam alfredo sauce that I made from scratch to the spaghetti squash. After all of the additions I thought it was actually one of the best dishes I had ever made! A beautiful dish with devine flavors....

So by now it is clear that this is mild and yes, probably well suited to a child's palette. I doubled the "glaze" recipe (really more of a sauce) and the cider was pleasantly sweet. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested cinnamon instead of brown sugar. I also dusted the tofu with cornstarch and did find it crisped nicely. In all, it was good but not memorable. For me it isn't worth three steps. Maybe will try baking the tofu in the glaze.

Very mild, per other reviewers. Added more garlic, more lemon juice and doubled the sauce. Stirred in some sriracha and snipped in some kale for color, taste and nutrition. Still not a real savory dish. I'd eat it again, but only if I again find myself with a spaghetti squash, a tub of tofu and little else but pantry staples.

As is I give this 3 forks - with minor changes I think it would rate 3.5 forks. It is somewhat bland (as other users have mentioned)- next time I will try adding fresh ginger, more lemon juice, and an extra garlic clove. Also, as one other reviewer pointed out there is not enough sauce for the amount of squash & tofu - I would suggest doubling it. I added chopped fresh spinach to the sauce to up the vitamins and which was great. Also, made it with vegetable broth rather than chicken. My vegetarian teenagers loved it.

This was, like other reviewers said, very mild. That said, I liked it a lot. A sprinkle of sea salt over the final product enhanced the flavors quite a bit.

I can understand making this for a baby, who would like soft and bland, but I was very disappointed. Followed recipe as written, but added ginger and an extra garlic clove as advised below. Still flavorless.

I made a lot of modifications to simplify the recipe, but, was very happy with the squash! Instead of brown sugar, I sprinkled with cinnamon. It smelled so good while in the oven and tasted so good, with no sugar! For any of you out there trying to cut down on sugar, give the cinnamon substitute a try. Then, I just seared the tofu with olive oil and garlic. Very pared down, but, with some other veggies, was a really delicious meal.

Nice, simple recipe. It is very mild, so the addition of approximately 1 tsp. ginger and an extra clove of garlic seems to really help it out. Pleasantly sweet, but not too much so. I recommend using real maple syrup as well in case that wasn't obvious.

I do not recommend this recipe. For the marinade, I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth, because we are vegetarians. The marinade was completely overpowered by the vegetable broth, and lemon was the only other discernible flavor. The sweetness of the maple syrup and apple cider were lost in the rest of the ingredients. The name is misleading, because I found no traces of maple in the glaze. However, I cooked the squash with a brush of olive oil, and baked it according to the recipe's instruction, and it was delicious with some jarred marinara sauce.

I didn't make the spaghetti squash. I deep fried the tofu after breading it, and then glazed it. The glaze is absolutely delicious and could be used on practically anything.

This glaze is really, really good and combined with the squash it's really something special. Tofu works, but really anything mild in flavour would work.

I have done tofu in this cooking method many times, and baked spaghetti squash the same way also -however- I really enjoyed the sauce and thought it really brought everything together! I agree ginger would be a great addition and a bit more spice, but as is, it's very good! Also, I usually dust the tofu with cornstarch before frying with veg oil, helps with crisping!

We thought this was very tasty! The only thing I added to the glaze was some fresh ginger. For the tofu, once it started browning, I alternately added some soy sauce and nutritional yeast (sauteeing a few min between each to prevent gooey clumps) to taste. The saltiness of the tofu was a great complement to the sweetness of the squash and glaze. My boyfriend, who is not vegetarian, says I can make this anyttime!

I really liked it, we used vegetable broth instead. I would make twice the amount of glaze next time, otherwise the tofu seemed dry.

however because i am vegetarian i substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth.

this was a lot easier to make than i had anticipated. both my daughter and husband loved it and asked me to make it again.

Wow. This was even worse than I expected - and my expectations weren't very high after reading the other review. Not only was it flat, the textures didn't work well together. Neither my husband or kids would eat it.

Not terrible, but very bland. Should have noticed it came from a parenting magazine, so it might be ideal for kids. We wanted a lot more flavorN I may make this combination again, but will add some spices--maybe curry?
