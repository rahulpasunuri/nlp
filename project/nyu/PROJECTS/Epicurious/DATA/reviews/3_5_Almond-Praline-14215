My mum used to make this recipe when i was a child in sicily. Its delicious and very easy to make, use oil under prailine so that it doesnt stick on the marble slab if you got one or use heat proof board and cut with large knife being hit on top to cut through the prailine. keeps for weeks in an airtight container. try it! oh i used whole toasted almonds instead of slivered almonds
