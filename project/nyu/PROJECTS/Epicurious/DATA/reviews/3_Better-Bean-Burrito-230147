Basic recipe that is made better by adding a few extra ingredients. It was my first time making burritos and it was truly an easy recipe to make. As others recommended, I during the saute process I added a dash of cumin, and red pepper each. I also added chopped jalapeno peppers during the simmering process. Lastly during the burrito building process I added a fresh green salsa (store bought) and some extra hot sauce. We love our food with some extra heat. It was excellent.

This was good: quick, cheap, and easy. It wasn't great. It needs a bit more spice. I definitely had to make guacamole and pile it on to make this worthwhile.

This is a very easy, quick dinner recipe. I add a bit of cumin and black pepper to the beans and use hot sauce instead of the anaheim pepper. Delicious!
