I made this for a client in their weekly meal service rotation. They loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Many fish soup broths are just too "fishy", but the rouille helps make this a surprisingly clean, and even brightly flavored soup! I had tilapia and some large shrimp on hand, and they worked just great. I did marinate them in some evoo, lemon juice, lemon zest,and garlic for about 1/2 hour prior to cooking. I used a separate frying pan to cook the leeks and then seared fish very quickly, then added it to the soup. I used the marinade and a little extra wine to deglaze the pan, and added it all to the soup. I think perhaps the lemon in the marinade was the biggest help in making the flavor bright. All in all, the whole dish, as I prepared it, turned out delicious!

I used what I had on hand, substituting clam juice for the fish stock, using bottled smoked peppers and cod, salmon and shrimp. Delicious!! And much quicker to make.

absolutely delicious! we had it without the bread and rouille and it was still fabulous. make sure you use a dry wine!

This was a delicious soup and all of our guests loved it. I would only suggest like others have that you make as much ahead of time as possible. The fish stock can be made well ahead and frozen and the broth can be made up to three days ahead as the recipe suggests or, I think, could also be made well ahead and frozen. I felt that for a main course soup, there was not nearly enough fish so I added 1/2 pound each of shrimp and bay scallops. This was sufficient but I think it could still benefit from more seafood. Overall I think I've made other recipes just as tasty without so much effort. Try the "Summer Seafood Stew".

This has an outstanding flavor. Served it as a first course, and my guest loved it.However, by the time that it made it to my table, the croutons had absorbed most of the fabulous broth. I think next time I will serve bread on the side. And the rouille.. that will be a staple at our house! Wow! Made the recipe for the stock and broth ahead, and froze it. All I had to do the day of the dinner was make the rouille and add the fish. Great recipe.

I made this soup for a Provencal dinner party. The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I didn't strain the broth. Instead, I made sure to dice the leek, carrots and celery very finely and I left them in the soup as I wanted some texture. I added a strip of orange peel to the broth with the bay leaves to infuse flavour as I have seen this done in other recipes for fish soup. I used two kinds of white fish and I added some shrimp as well. It was so flavourful and the rouille was divine. One of the guests must have eaten 5 croutes with loads of rouille slathered on them after her soup. She couldn't get enough. My friend is from Provence and I've had her fish soup. This one is extremely similar to her old family recipe.

Loved it so much we're adding it to our monthly rotation.

This soup is superb and worth the effort. As with most soups the key is the fish stock. I usually make enough stock to freeze. The Rouille adds depth to this wonderful recipe. Choose a good bread and be sure to have plenty of extra Rouille. We serve it with a salad, a good French Rosé, and Crème Brule for dessert. Prepare the broth the day before and you have a dinner party that you do not have to spend the evening in the kitchen.

As much work as any Bouillabaisse I've ever made without being nearly as good. I was a little surprised given the ingredients, raves and stars. If I was ever to make this again, I'd leave off the tomatoes in place of extra onion and carrot but it's almost certain that I never will. It was far too acidy and the saffron was lost in it. For the money, make a standard Bouillabaisse.

Just a superb dish all round!!

This is a lot of work, but I took a shortcut on the fish stock and used Japanese hondashi, and it came out great. I'll make this again, possibly with the modification of pureeing some of the vegetables used to make the broth and adding back in to thicken the soup a bit.

The flavors are incredible. Husband & friends are from Southern France and they raved about it! Am making it again this weekend for another group visiting from Paris. It is a lot of work but I am doing it in stages. Will make & freeze the fish stock, make the broth 2 days before and make the roulle on day of serving. This and a salad, dessert is all you need. You will not be disappointed.

wonderful soup with some incredible flavors. It takes way too much time to make with all of the stock, broth, rouille--we did have a wonderful supper though. Glad I had the experience but I may as well be making Thanksgiving dinner with all the tasks associated with this recipe.

I have made this dish a number of times now always to great acclaim. This time I wanted more of a ciopinno kind of dish but never altered from the stock but added spice and the variety of fish at will. I love this recipe. Well worth the effort. Having made this often I can attest to making the stock the day before. Lots more intensity

Made this as a first course for dinner and it was superb. Everyone exclaimed over it. I don't think I'll make the stock from scratch again; I tasted the stock and the flavor-to-work ratio wasn't there. But after making the broth, the flavor was amazing. And the rouille really gilds the lily. My crowd ate up all the rest of the rouille over the course of the dinner. Am going to make it again as a main course for a luncheon. (Used tilapia for the stock and halibut for the soup.)

The flavor is exquisite! Making the soup is simple but very time consuming. However, the homemade fish stock is well worth the time if you want something really special. Also, it would be easy to make the stock in advance and freeze it.

This is really a delicious soup. I originally found the recipe in my Gourmet Cookbook and I only came online to print it out, so that I wouldn't stain my cookbook by working out of it. After I got into the cooking process, I discovered that your online recipe leaves out one whole section. In the book, this section is called "Finish the Soup". I really needed to have that section, as I wouldn't have felt comfortable with such a gourmet recipe without every little instructions.

Lovely and elegant soup, presents beatifully ladled over the croutes, with amazingly complex layers of flavor. The broth is quite spicy (or perhaps my red peper flakes are unusually potent) -- reduce the pepper a bit if you desire less bite or are serving sensitive palates. I used a combo of red snapper, basa and dorado (mahi mahi) and the result was really delicious -- rave reviews, and worth the (considerable) effort.

We lived in Europe for 12 years and visited Cannes many times. Have been trying to find a recipe comparable to Soupe de Poissen. Definately. I will serve it at my next dinner party. Worth the preparation. Perfect.

I prepared this recipe in trying to replicate THE BEST Zuppa di pesce I've ever had from Buon Appetito restaurant in San Diego's Little Italy. This rendition was very good, albeit a little time consuming with making both the fish stock, and the separate broth. The finished product was wonderfully rich, and complex. Used halibut trim for the stock, and in the soup itself. I probably won't prepare this again only because I'd like to figure out a recipe that is closer to the taste of the soup I had at the restaurant.

This is a FABULOUS soup. The flavor was rich and very "South of France." Next time I make it I will do bite-sized croutons so it will be easier to eat. You may want to double the fish (added at the end) if it is to be a main course.

wow- this is pretty spectacular! i used already prepared fish stock from the whole foods store, and roasted peppers from there as well, which cut down on time, and i don't think it compromised the taste at all. also, i used tillapia for the fish, because it is relatively cheap, and it was great! the rouille rocks!

This soup is elegant and so flavorful. The rouille makes this a standout dish, so be sure not to leave it out. I made stock with mediterranean sea bass and used dorade in the soup. The recipe definitely stood up to these more fishy tasting fish. Absolutely guestworthy.

Excellent recipe! Not as daunting as it appears at first reading - especially if you already have your fish stock made. (I used a stock made from lobster shells and shrimp shells that I had in my freezer.) I made once with bass and once with cod - excellent both times. The rouille recipe makes more than what's needed for the recipe but can be used as a dip or spread! (I have made the rouille again just to use as a crudite dip.)

Excellent! To save time, use fish bouillon, and tear a bagette into 2 inch pieces and toast (leave the crust on!)instead of the croutes. Cook the white part of the leeks at least 5 minutes. This is the best fish soup I've made. The rouille is amazing!!
