This is a yummy recipe but I have made it my own. I have only ever used prawns (cheaper) and sometimes substitute apple juice for the calvados to save money. It is a slightly sweet dish.

Simple and incredibly delicious! You may substitute the lobster with prawns or a firm white fish, still turns out awesome. P.S. Add a little garlic.

I liked the way the lobster was cooked (sauteed at the end) and also used frozen lobster tails. However, the sauce had a bitter taste to it. I added some cream and some cayenne pepper to mask the bitterness. There are a lot of simpler curry recipes out there which I would use next time. I would try a little clam juice to add the fish flavor. The brandy and the wine flavors were totally lost. All in all, good, but not great.

A Valentine's 4 forks - made with 4 6 oz. frozen rock lobster tails. I almost burned the sauce when I was reducing it, and had to add more water to get the sauce back, but it turned out to be very tasty.

We did this recipe as a main course. We used frozen tails instead of live lobsters. After cutting the tails into medallions, we used some leftovers to enhance the flavors of the sauce. This recipe is simple and delicieuse... We only received praises from our party of 16 on New Year's Eve...
