Great use of Chard. I had a big bunch from my share so I used only the leaves and discarded the stems. I also went for a more hearty-sweet profile: I omitted the red pepper flakes. Instead, I started out by cooking 1/2 lb sausage from Fiorella's (sweet w/fennel seed), sliced it up. Then made everything else and tossed the cooked sausage before adding the tomatoes. Then a I paired it with a hearty whole wheat pasta. Normally I don't care for whole wheat pasta, but it worked really well with this recipe.

Loved it! I'm in Colombia so some recipes are almost impossible to make for the lack of ingredients. I didn't have access to red pepper flakes so I subbed chili peppers-not too shabby. Like others, I added more garlic and loved it. I also added onions and the second time I made it, red bell pepper-each addition was a good one. This is a great basic recipe to which you can add whatever veggie or sausage you like and it turns out great!

So simple and yet soooo good. Lovely with swiss chard fresh from the garden, I will make this over and over.

Loved this. Took other reviewers' advice and added onion at the start and toasted pine nuts as garnish with the parmesan cheese.

This was pretty good and a great way to use the greens we got at the farmers market. We didn't have enough chard, so we substituted part of it with kale. We also used fresh tomatoes and added two italian sausage links (one hot, one mild). That added some nice flavor. The recipe says it makes two servings but I think made more like four.

A keeper! I, too, added toasted pine nuts and served with Italian sausage.

I added sausage to this and a little extra red pepper, and it was a great quick meal. Will definitely make again.

The Boyfriend and I recently moved from a small town with very few dining options to the 'burbs of a mid-sized city. We rejoice every weekend at the variety of establishments now within our reach, but as the weeks have worn on, we've found ourselves missing a small, family owned, simple Italian place near our old abode. Although they have nothing resembling this dish on their menu, it made us both feel like we were there. I did, however, make some modifications I don't think we would have found there: doubled the garlic and red pepper, threw in a handful of halved grape tomatoes, a quarter cup of pine nuts, and, due to necessity, cut the chard in half. My chard came from a local farm, and, also unfortunately, the stems were such a mess that even after fifteen minutes of soaking and scrubbing, they still didn't look like anything The Boyfriend would be willing to eat. As a result, I also cut the water in half, and, of course, skipped the associated cooking time. I think it was because of this, and the fact that I drained the can of tomatoes before tossing it in, that we didn't get any extra sauce to sop up with the focaccia we had on the side. Oh well. It was still excellent.

Super tasty. Added some chopped onion and zuchinni that i had. also used fresh tomatoes and a few more cloves of garlic than called for. Everyone really liked it and it was great for lunch the next day.

My first time trying Swiss Chard, found out I like it! Based on the other reviewers, I sauteed some chopped onion with the garlic, crushed red pepper flakes & a pinch of oregano in the olive oil, added some diced tomatoes and wine, let that cook down a bit. Then added some cooked italian sausage and more tomatoes and let simmer. About 5 minutes before the pasta was cooked added the swiss chard into the sauce. Delicious!

Toasted pine nuts, definitely, and don't skimp. Petite diced tomatoes (slightly drained) worked nicely, also. Thank you, fellow reviewers.

This is a great recipe. I preferred more tomatoes and put in one full 14-oz. can of diced tomatoes. I didn't have penne and used rigatoni and it worked very well. I'll definitely be making this again!

Simple, quick, and very tasty-the first dish I've really liked chard in. Used beautiful rainbow chard, and added toasted pinenuts.

We had a split vote in my family; I loved it, my husband not. He generally doesn't like bitter-type greens and pushed the greens to one side, but I thought it was tasty, as well as healthful. (I ate his greens!) As for whose vote prevailed here, it was mine! I agree with others: double the garlic, and the pepper (if you like the hotness. I do.)

A true winner! More garlic needed! Easy and delicious for kids and adults alike!

This is a great vegetarian recipe, made it exactly as per instructions and we were all amazed by the results. Sometimes very simple recipes with simple ingredients turn ou much better than some complicated ones. This is one of those, we will be making this regularly when we need to slack off on eating meat.

THis recipe was so good on a cold night... and so easy to prep. I doubled the garlic and the red pepper. The bad breath afterward was worth the extra flavor. Next time I might consider adding in some additional vegetables like asparagus or zucchini. I loved the way the chard was so tender but not overcooked.

This is an exquisite dish in looks and taste and wonderfully easy to prepare. Used swiss chard and tomatoes from the garden. I think the key is sauteing the garlic properly -- browned but not burned, as this carries the dish.

Disapointing. Definitely needs more garlic!

Love this one! Simple and so tasty! Make sure to have bread on hand for sopping...

FORGOT TO INCLUDE THE PINE NUTS!!! I make a similar version. I saute chopped onions in olive oil, add garlic for about 30 seconds, canned tomatoes (with juice), 1/2 cup chicken broth or red wine, hot pepper flakes, salt & pepper. Allow to cook down for about 15 minutes, then add chopped Swiss chard & 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts. Cook only until chard wilts, adding a little pasta water if necessary. Toss with cooked & drained penne and serve with Parmesan.

Excellent. Used myzithra cheese instead of parm. Tip: Drain the sauce well to prevent cooked-off water from diluting the flavor of the final dish. A great meal for one, with leftovers for the next day.

this is a very taste pasta dish. It presents well being colorful, and appetizing. I often add a variety of different game meat to the recipe. Sometimes ground elk sausage, or sauted pheasant strips.

This was quite good - I used thin spaghetti instead of penne. I degalzed the pan with a good chardonnay after sauteing the stems. I reserved more pasta water at the end and added to the sauce. Also used 2 fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned. I would make it again, but not hurry to.

We loved this one! Usually we just order out for Italian, but this tasted just like the restaurant. We did add sausage and that satisfied the meat eaters in the family. I will keep this one handy! 3 for 3 this week with epicurious..

I substituted a homemade tomato sauce for the canned tomatoes. Great way to use Swiss chard. I would suggest serving toasted Italian bread or focaccia to "mop up" the great sauce.

This recipe is great, especially with garlic and red pepper. Red chard stains the pasta a lovely color, making the presentation as good as the flavor.

This is a very simple, but delicious recipe. Even my 18 month old loved it! I added more toms and about 9 cloves of garlic! This is one my daughter will grow up on! Enjoy.

Classic, simple, very tasty. I made adaptations that really worked. I removed 2 sausages from their casings and sauteed them with the garlic (they added a layer of depth that really worked). Then, after the tomatoes went in I added a half can of their liquid and simmered vigorously for an extra 10 mins. before starting the pasta. Finally, when the pasta was 5 mins from being done, i added 1/4 cup of pasta water to the sauce. EXCELLENT. With the additions, it made sauce for 1 lb. of pasta--great leftovers for the microwave.
