I huge it at home. I already had all the ingredients (frozen corn and leftover cooked chicken), and read this thinking it would be okay. But it was WAY better than okay. Just a terrific dish. The fresh basil is key. I'm looking forward to making this again using fresh, uncooked chicken thighs with some extra cayenne and tabasco because we like it hot.

Exceptional. Added quite a bit of cayenne and some tabasco (we like hot) and used frozen corn. Otherwise, followed recipe. Will be doing this one again and again.

This is 31/2 forks. Very delicious. I used chicken thighs only, about 1/2 hot italian, 1/2 hot links for sausage. I crisped the chicken in a cast iron, after sauteeing the sausage. I added a touch of white wine and a couple dashes of wostershire. Used fire roasted can tomatos,and frozen fire roasted corn from tj. I usually don't care much for basil, but it really worked on this dish. Served with rice and collard/kale green with bacon and mushrooms. I will make this again.

Absolutely fabulous--rich, exceptionally flavorful, and hearty. One of my all-time favorite dishes. Some have said they don't like how sweet it is--but that is exactly what makes it sing, in my book.It's all about the fresh sweetness of corn and cherry tomatoes, balanced perfectly by the savory, spicy sausage and rich chicken meat. I use bone-in thighs, half with the skin on and half with the skin removed, because I don't mind eating from the bone and I think it adds depth of flavor. Love, love, love!

This is really good and I will repeat it often. I made a few modifications such as one jalapeno rather than a green pepper, used some Cajun seasoning plus the cayenne and it still wasn't hot. Andouille rather than Italian sausage. Served it over plain Basmati rice at which time I wished for more sauce. Next time I will add some flour to the veg saute and after it cooks a bit add chicken broth, being careful not to salt much due to the saltiness of the broth. I didn't detect much if any sweetness from the generic supermarket frozen corn I used.

Frozen corn works great to save time. I added more cayenne and some garlic as well.

This dish was ok, but it was very sweet. Too sweet for me, and I even like sweet-tasting foods. I would most likely not make this again, but if I did I would serve it with something salty like rice or mashed potatoes.

This is a family favorite. It gets requested at least once ever couple of months. It turns out best with fresh yellow corn (not sweet). It goes well with a crispy whole grain baggett and butter.

Excellent dish and a crowd pleaser. We've made it with both fresh corn and frozen corn, and the fresh corn made it sweeter, especially if it's in season. If using skinless chicken thighs (for less fat), do not pour off fat to saute the vegetables. We added mushrooms and garlic the second time to enhance the flavor and served over a bed of rosemary jasmine rice. Everyone raved about the wonderful flavor!

This is wonderful. Have made it many times . . . never fails to please. Good to take, good to give. We added tiny fingerling potatoes, served with a salad and crusty bread.

I have made this recipe numerous times and everyone loves it! I misplaced it and am so happy to find it on Gourmet's website.

I was afraid the kids wouldn't eat the hot sausage so I used sweet but I threw in some red pepper flakes. We thought it was great. It's a very forgiving dish and probably very adaptable. Once our Jersey sweet corn is finished I will try frozen.

Very interesting flavor combinations. My husband doesn't usually like corn mixed in dishes, but really liked this one.

The results were disappointing. Very sweet (due to the fresh corn) and the flavors just did not blend well. For the efforts required I should have made a gumbo!

A friend made this and raved about it. I retrieved my Gourmet Magazine from the recycle pile and tried it this weekend. My husband and I loved it and want to make it for company. It looks beautiful and tastes just as good. We served it with a coarse Tuscan-style bread. Grits (the stone-ground, slow-cooking type) might be a nice side dish.
