We've made it 3 ways: with just white asparagus, with just green asparagus, and with both. Each was good, but we prefer the white because we have so many other delicious recipes for green asparagus.

Great, simple recipe. Nice side with grilled steaks and/or tuna. I agree the white asparagus is inconsistent in texture, but the contrast between the white and green asparagus works for me.

This was a perfect side dish for family dinner - but white asparagus can be so inconsistent! I'll use all green next time...

This was delicious made with all green asparagus. Other reviewers are correct about the recipe calling for too much oil - I will use half the amount next time.

Living in France part-time, I love white asparagus, it is in season now, but I am here in the U.S. I was anxious to make this recipe. I found that the use of 1/4 Cup of shallots was too much, rather overpowering. Would start w/1 Tbl.and test for taste. Would definately try again. For an added twist: roll the asparagus in toasted sesame seeds just before serving.

I prepared this recipe for Christmas dinner using only green asparagus and it was outstanding. Went well with the Prime Rib and the Mashed Potatoes with Mushroom Gravy. Will absolutely do again

I nearly always roast asparagus with olive oil. The combo of green & white was pretty-but for us the green has a much better(more intense)flavor. I left the spears whole, but can imagine that the dish might have been better if I'd followed the directions. Shallot and lemon peel added nice flavor contrast to the companion recipe of fingerling potatoes with oyster mushrooms. We had both with the Muscovy Duck Breasts with Pomegranate-Wine Sauce from this site. Cooked them all in succession so only one baking sheet to clean!!! Christmas 2008

The lemon and shallot added a nice subtle flavor. I often roast my asparagus, but use just salt, pepper and a touch of olive oil, so I tried this just for a little twist. My only complaint was that there was way too much oil for my taste. Next time I will use 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.

I only had green asparagus to use, but my guests loved it. It is a subtle way to do something new with asparagus. The shallots and the roasting helped with the wine pairing as well

I had white asparagus and went looking for a recipe afterward. I really like this technique of roasting them. You want some brownness so you get a caramelized crunch. I used an onion instead of shallot and frankly I can tell this would taste a lot better with shallot. Next time.

I thought this would be really pretty. My white asparagus comes from really far away and it was not good. The green asparagus had a good flavor but there was too much olive oil. The green was tasty but not worth repeating.

This was good. Be careful not to use all the olive oil if you are using less of the asparagus. I did not like the white asparagus. Probably because it is not very fresh by the time it gets over here to the U.S. I kept the asparagus in whole pieces rather than cut it and I liked it that way.
