Our steaks were wonderful with this marinade. All the flavors melded perfectly. I didn't change anything in the recipe, except I used ribeye steaks. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.

I made the recipe as is for a low-key dinner party to rave reviews. EVERYONE asked for the recipe!

What a nice surprise! Yum. Forget the 4-hour marinate -- go for 24+. I made and applied the marinade paste 2-3 days ago, substituting honey for the sugar. Slathered it on a beautiful rib-eye. Expected to cook it the next night but had heavy business lunches the next two days. So, after 48-72 hours of marinating in an airless zip-bag in the fridge (dutifully turned every 12 hours), I broiled the steak tonight. It was wonderful, considering the paucity of ingredients. For a topping, I made a simple side of sauteed onions in 2/3 butter, 1/3 EVOO, to which I added a couple of cloves of minced, de-germed garlic and quartered brown (cremini) mushrooms. To the mushroom-onion mix I added a niiiiice big splash of cognac, flamed that, and then a few tablespoons of very good Merlot. Got to tell you, folks, this one will score points. Be sure you use very fresh ground cumin and chili powder (and don't mess with the quantities/ratios). I used fresh Penzeys' for both and was very happy with the results. Next time I'll substitute Minor's chipotle or ancho flavor concentrate for the chili powder, to gauge the difference. Normally I don't give 4 forks to such a simple recipe, but the "memorable, want it again" factor gets it there. I'd think this marinade will work well with anything from flank steak to filet. A plug for rare beef -- "Grill it, don't kill it!"

Fabulous rub for steaks. Used shell steaks and only changed the amount of chili powder by reducing it a bit (hubby isn't as fond of heat as I am). They were PERFECT, marinated for a mere 2 hours then grilled to perfection (5 min per side on the outdoor gas bbq grill); tasty, juicy, so flavorful but not too hot nor overpowering. Fire up the grill and ENJOY! This recipe rocks!

I've been making this about once a week since discovering the recipe. It's our favorite way to prepare steaks. I use almost an entire head of garlic, as we LOVE garlic. I also use 1/2 Hot New Mexico Chili Powder and 1/2 Reg. Chili Powder. FANTASTIC!

I don't eat beef so I am basing this review on the rave reviews I got from the beef eaters. My husband is still talking about it 4 days later. I cut up the meat into cubes though and skewered it - it's easier to cook this way on a camp fire.

I've been preparing this recipe since it was printed in Gourmet in 1995. Couldn't find my recipe today and am happy to see it's still available here. The prep time for these steaks is so fast and the flavor delicious; Perfect for weekend grilling at the cabin.

For my fourth of July party, I barbequed some steaks with this chili rub. I followed the recipe perfectly. I completed the chili rub about six hours before going on the grill. The steaks had a difinite kick to it, as they were very spicy. For myself, I would prefer something more on the lighter side; however, everyone seemed to have enjoyed them.

Really enjoyed this recipe - and thanks to the reviewer from Chicago who suggested the smoked chili powder! I just put a couple dried chipotle chilis in the spice grinder and used that - it added a wonderful flavor. This is my favorite steak recipe now.

This is one of my favorite steak dishes. If you have the opportunity, substitute some smoked pepper powder (I make my own.) for the chili powder. The taste is out of this world!

Absolutely delicious! I used a spicey hot chili powder and it really gave the steak some kick. I will make this again and again.

Great why to make less expensive cuts of meat.

Great, have used it two times, improvised a bit and grilling ribeyes in Texas right now.

This is a terrific recipe-the steaks are extremely flavorful with a nice spicy kick to them. I sprinkled a little vegetable oil over the rubbed steaks before placing them under the broiler, so that they wouldn't dry out too much.

These is a wonderful, highly spiced recipe. Not recommended for the fair-hearted. (My only mistake was that I only let them marinate for 1-1/2 hours...next time I will let them go for the full time). Yummmmm!!
