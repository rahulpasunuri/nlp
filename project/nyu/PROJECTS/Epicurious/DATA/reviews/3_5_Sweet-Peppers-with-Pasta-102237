Delicious as written, so long as your red peppers are flavorful. I wouldn't add parmesan (tried it, and didn't think it worked with the simple, oil-based pasta flavor). On the other hand, adding some parsley and pine nuts for serving went well.

I used this recipe as a base and made changes based on what I had on hand. I had a lot of different types of peppers: lipstick, italian, hungarian, and a slightly spicy pepper. I didn't have garlic, so substituted a shallot. Used the olive oil, white wine, and a added shrimp. Tossed with salt and pepper and parmesean. Used a flavorful pasta which made this a tasty dish. I will make again -- will try with non-flavored pasta and and parsley. The shrimp makes it a main dish. It would probably work with Chicken too. A great use of in season peppers.

Excellent side dish. Not at all bland as some reviewers state. Just S&P to taste. I did add parsley and shredded parm cheese.

I like the idea of this recipe... so I made it. I had to make some changes as I didn't have all the ingredients at home... so I improvised.. which I have to say was complete perfection. I used red wine vinegar... made the peppers sweeter. I didn't have garlic. So it was redwine vinegar, kosher salt, and olive oil. I actually let it cook at lowest temp. for about 45min while I added some chicken in the oven.. added lemon juice from the bottle and garlic powder and olive oil and a pinch a cracked pepper and kosher salt for 30min. at 400. Wow. Add this all together. Drizzle a little parsley and some fresh mozarella or Parmesan cheese and you have an amazing dish! Gonna be a favorite for me! Thanks!

It was a bit bland as-is. I added parsley, garlic salt, onion salt, tomatoes, a some balsamic vinegar, parmesan, chicken, and pine nuts. DELICIOUS!!!!

This was way, way too oily for me. In the unlikely event of me cooking it again, I think I'd slow roast the peppers in the oven and then remove the skins. Perhaps adding a little garlic oil to the cooked pasta. Perhaps a little more work but it would make it edible.

amazing. even more amazing with a lot of grated locatelli cheese. we make it with brown rice penne which is much healthier.

Terrific. Easy. I added some goat cheese, chicken and basil for a variation.

I've made this a couple of times. It is a very nice, light pasta. I have added chopped parsley, grated cheese and even a few hot peppers. Easy and tasty.

Very nice and best of all, simple. The addition of a little fresh parmesan is nice.
