It was good but not great. I enjoyed the fennel but the sauce mostly tastes like putting butter on salmon even with the pernod.

Followed recipe exactly. Easy and delicious! I had lots of compound butter left over (not sure why), so I threw it into some chicken and dumplings I made the next day. Also turned out delicious. We will be making this salmon recipe again for sure.

Having loved the Bengali, Javanese roasted salmon, salmon strudel and many other recipes...just can't understand why this gets to be in the top salmon recipe bracket.

Couldn't get King Salmon so I had to settle with wild Atlantic. Cooked way too fast so I had to eat it mid well. Probably a small-ish filet. Doesn't matter. This recipe is phenomenal. This was my first time cooking fennel so I had trouble being patient because it took a lot longer to sautee the fennel on a lousy gas range than anticipated. So much fragrance and flavor. I cooked this with whole foods qinuoa with an america's test kitchen recipe (time consuming but worth it). Again, had to be patient with my first pilaf. Just cooked it down with shallots and a fresh apple. Really complemented the robust and fresh fennel/pernod dish.

Loved this one. Had no idea what Pernod was, but somehow I had it in my pantry (grandfathers old bottle). Like Sambuca, but less licorice-y. If you can find it, grab a small bottle; well worth it.

Fantastic and easy too! Followed the recipe exactly and loved every morsel. A definite keeper in our family!

Great recipe hands down. I use cod, I suppose we just got a little tired of salmon, and I've also used hake. Firm flesh fish... Otherwise I was lucky to find Pernod which is distinct and aromatic. I cut back to 1/2 butter and find it is quite sufficient. I have also once added sliced pear toward the end (not too soon, easily gets mushy) and it added a new dimension.

Loved this, easy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was to sear the salmon separately and finish cooking in the oven, and I added a little bit of Land O'Lakes No Fat Half & Half to the sauce at the end. Like others I used Sambucca.

Amazing! I made only one change. I couldn't find pernod so I used Sambuco. I cannot wait to make it again. Easy to make for a weeknight dinner or an elegant meal.

Although I used Sambuca instead of Pernod, this was incredibly good. When the Sambuca finally runs out, and now it will, I'll try it with Pernod. I've never tasted anything like this before. Wow.

Love fennel and pernod and salmon together. I added some onions with the fennel and why use water?? white wine is my liquid of choice.

Great meal, if a little timely in the prep area (took longer than 30 minutes). The only thing I would consider changing is you might be able to cut back on the butter just a bit.

Simple elegance. I wanted to do something special for my husband and found this recipe. It is so easy to prepare, makes a lovely presentation and is so delicious. I followed the recipe as written--did not have Pernod so I used another anise flavored liqueur. May add a little more liqueur next time--the flavor it gives is amazing. I served it with sides of roasted fingerlings and ribbon zucchini coated with some of the butter mixture that was left. Positively wonderful.

Not sure if you get this recipe wrong. It was so easy to follow - I think I got some steps wrong and it still came out delicious. Amazing.

Unbelievable! Fennel and shallots create such a complex flavor. I used Sambuca. The second time I made it, I used tilapia and added asparagus. It's like dessert. I did make sure to cook off the alcohol, and the sambuca goes sweet.

I have made this several times over the past few years -- it is one of the all-time greats. This recipe is super-easy and yet seems special enough to serve to company. If you make double the flavored butter, you can use it the next day on something else. Tonight I added fennel pollen and wanted to comment that it didn't add anything special to this recipe. Fennel pollen is very expensive and best used elsewhere.

This dish is amazing. I'm not big on Anise flavoring, but it compliments the salmon wonderfully in this dish. I could not find Pernod for the life of me, so I used Sambuca and it was amazing. I complimented this dish with some steamed asparagus and home made garlic mashed potatoes. My guests raved, and they are exceptional gourmets. Highly recommended!

If there's fennel at the farmers market then this dish is being made. By simply adding an additional fennel bulb you will use the extra butter and have an entire meal. Well almost...don't forget a crisp white wine to truly enjoy the flavors and except no substitutions for Pernod!

This is a great traditional receipe which is often made with shrimp. The reason the instructions are confusing is in the first part you are making a compound butter which is traditionally chilled and then added at the end of cooking off heat to make a smooth non-greasy sauce for the fish. The receipe should state that the Pernod be added to the cooked fennel in a hot pan to burn off the alcohol-then the last of the compound butter added off heat and the sauce poured over the fish. This would be better tasting and easier than trying to manage the salmon in the same pan as the cooked fennel. The sauce should be for the fish not a part of the preparation of it.

Be careful of what you use in the place of Pernod, if you don't have it. I used Ouzo. My husband said he really liked it, but I was not pleased with the end result. It tasted quite bitter to me. I love fennel and was really looking forward to this, the fish was good, not great. I would try this again, with Pernod and with some other tweaking.

Good recipe, great base for other ingredients (as mentioned before). Reduce butter (I used more olive oil, instead), do not put too much water on the salmon, smaller fennnel cuts actually blend flavors better (or combining chopped and julienne fennel cuts, but not too long).

Rating: 4
Weirdly enough, I had everything on hand to make this, and it was great. Most of the cooking times given were longer than what I ended up needing, and the fennel had more sauce (butter?) than was pictured in the photo, but that just made it better. The flavor was really good and different and the look on the plate was beautiful. (I served with homemade saffron rice.)

Excellent. I didn't really like the smell of the fennel while it was boiling/frying, but it was superb when everything came together at the end. I used herbsaint instead of pernod since that was what I had on hnad, it is a fine substitute.

I'm not sure why everyone raves about this dish. I followed it to a tee and it's was just so-so, to be honest. There is too much butter, like everyone says. Also, the recipe never says what to do with the crushed fennel seeds. Never mind all that, the flavor was just ok. I actually think a white fish would be better with this than salmon. Adding another veggie with the fennel would have made it more interesting to me as well. I might make it again with other things added.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Like others, used Sambuca since I didn't have Pernod. Also recommend 2 changes: decrease butter as slightly greasy, and keep fennel pieces to 3" or shorter (longer strips are attractive but more difficult to eat). Husband loved it!

Rating: 4
EXCELLENT. FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THE PERNOD YOU COULD OVERWHELM THE SALMON. ALTHOUGH I FIND THIS RECIPE POORLY WRITTEN AS IT IS A LITTLE TOUGH TO FOLLOW (BUTTER HERE, BUTTER THERE GETS A LITTLE CONFUSING)IT IS RIGHT ON. I SUGGEST REWRITING IT FIRST.

This was simple and looked great on the plate. I substituted onions for shallots and cognac for Pernod and still tasted great! Next time, I'll also try adding a few capers.

Got rave reviews - I would increase the amount of fennel by 1/2, double the Pernod and decrease the butter by 2tsp - found it a little greasy. My salmon was cooked (a little pink in the middle) in 7/8mins - also didn't need to add the water after turning it.

I've been getting fennel from my CSA and this is a great dish to use it in. It was easy to make and very tasty. I used Chartreuse instead of Pernod, which probably made it sweeter, but I think most any herbal liqueur would do in a pinch.

I loved this! It's a delicious quick and easy weeknight dinner. Healthy too. I thought the Pernod might add too much sweetness, but it doesn't at all.

This recipe was pretty easy to make and my husband loved it! I used Anissette liquer from Joacquin instead of Pernod since it was less expensive. Joaquin's was $11.00 and the Pernod was $30.00

WONDERUFL! The only change I made was to not add ANY salt. It wasn't missed. Do NOT leave out the Pernod - it adds such a subtle and elegant flavor that it really enhances the dish. Followed the recipe otherwide exactly only paying attention to salmon cooking times and modifying accordingly. My boyfriend liked it so much he had a Zen chewing experience - closed his eyes and savored. I served with a spicy yet simple vegetable soup and Bakery Fresh Whole Wheat bread. He used his bread for the last bits with the butter - THEN went and got the pan I cooked it in and cleaned it out too! I'll definately make again! (I used Wild Alaskan Coho Salmon and I think that made a big difference.)

This was great. We made it with blackcod (aka sablefish)instead of salmon and was a lot better -- more delicate and rich. Although with blackcod, you only cook one side (skin down). Try it!!

This was fantastic. I made it exactly how it was written but with a side of risotto as well. My husband loved it and said it was a keeper. Would not change a thing!

Wouldn't change a thing!!! This dish completely rocks! Using Pernod or a less expensive anise liquor does not over power the dish as I thought it might when reading the recipe. My guests cleaned their plates and left me with no leftovers!!

To the cook who asked what might pair with this dish as an additional side.... For one, I'm not sure it needs one if your meal has additional courses. But if you wish to make it a more typical starch, veg, protein plate, then for the starch you could do something like a white bean puree, mashed potatoes, a pasta like spatezle, or a very basic risotto. Whatever it is I'd suggest something on the simpler side so as not to compete with the anise flavor of the dish.

Wonderful! Forgot to toast the fennel seeds, but it was good anyway. Served with couscous and a salad with basamic vinaigrette.

Fish tastes, well, fishy, but this dish is out of this world! I would recommend paying attention to the fennel seed as this can be overpowering if not crushed to a fine consistency.

Perhaps the best salmon I've made. I, too, skipped the Pernod, and everything came out regardless. I feared the fennel seeds might be overpowering, but the flavor was lovely.

This was a very easy and quick meal that would impress anyone. I would suggest to cook the shallots for 2 minutes before putting the salmon in the pan, & only cook salmon for 3 minutes, otherwise it is overcooked! Fabulous!

This was a great, easy meal. I skipped the liquor because we didn't have any in the house and served on a bed of sweet, sticky rice. Lovely flavours.

Fantastic! I substituted Sambuca for the Pernod, a small onion for the shallot, and served over Campanelle pasta to round out the dish. I would recommend to use a little lemon at the finish to brighten the flavor. A deffinate do over!

Very tasty. I used more Sambuca than it calls for since I love the flavor. I also substituted sea bass for the salmon. I would make again as well.

This was excellent. The salmon was tender but nicely browned on the outside. The fennel taste was wonderful. My only question is what to serve as side dishes, since the flavor is so fennely distinctive?
