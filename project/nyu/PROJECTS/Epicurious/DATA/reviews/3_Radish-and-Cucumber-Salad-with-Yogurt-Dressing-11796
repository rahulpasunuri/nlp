Or, use greek yogurt (Fage) which is already drained, and will save time.

I loved this recipe, as did my fiance who never eats any vegetables. I used both Italian parsley and mint in this recipe. If I make it again, I would use less yogurt, probably about half of the amount.

This is an easy delicious salad if you're on a diet or a summery side dish for blackened fish. Don't bother straining yogurt -- use Greek yogurt which is becoming more available at grocery stores (2% was plenty rich). Lots of fresh herbs are critical - any combination of parsley, basil, and cilantro. I also added a cup of diced red pepper. It keeps well for a few days, has practically no calories and lots of protein from the Greek yogurt, and is really bright tasting!

Very good, very simple, quick salad that's pretty filling considering how healthy it is (I used fat free yogurt). We ate it with pita. A very nice weekend lunch when you're swimming in radishes from the farm.

Made this delicious salad last week end to be a side dish to a 'catfish stew' that I made as main course. Was perfect. The cold salad.... with the Hot, Spicy stew. We enjoyed it so much I remade it the next evening to go with the leftover stew !!!! I am not quite clear about the draining for two hours. I tried to drain for an hour and nothing much happened. I also used less yogurt and a tad more garlic. Enjoy. Shall make the salad again this week to use as a sandwich in a mini pita.
