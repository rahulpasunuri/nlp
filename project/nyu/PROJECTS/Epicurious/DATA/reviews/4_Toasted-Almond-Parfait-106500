this is a delicious recipe. it is very rich so a little goes a long way. I served this on top of fresh strawberries in small glasses. My guests loved it so did my kids who got the leftovers.

Really easy and amazingly good. Better texture than ice cream and no special equipment required. I'll be making this again soon for sure.

Delicious and easy to make! A wonderful almond flavor that doesn't need a chocolate garnish.

This was a wonderful, rich, decadent dessert. The texture was smoother than any ice cream I've had.
