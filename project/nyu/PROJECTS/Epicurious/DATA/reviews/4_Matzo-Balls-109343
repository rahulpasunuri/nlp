delicious! My first attempt and it was so easy. They came out light & fluffy. I could have made them a little smaller because they expand. So next time I'll do a tsp. But with my home made chicken stock it was a cozy dinner my family enjoyed.

Fabulous! I use this matzo ball recipe with the Leek and ginger soup stock...these are like little clouds of delight! I mix it up sometimes and add grated ginger, or chives to the mixture.

My first attempt at Matzo Balls. I let the mixture sit overnight then made the next evening. Based on recommendations elsewhere, I simmered them covered for 30 min, then let stand for 10 minutes. They came out great. Next time, I'll add more salt, but other than that, won't make any changes.

This recipe makes the lightest, fluffiest, most melt in your mouth Matzo Balls. I am constantly asked to make my Matzo Ball soup - just so people can eat these Matzo Balls. This is the perfect recipe!

Better than my mom's matzo balls. Very light, perfect for soup.
