really glad I tested this recipe before making it for a small, casual wedding. cake is excellent (and yes, dense after night in fridge). frosting is tasty but gloppy with the curd. use this frosting if you don't have to travel with it or it doesn't have to be outside for any length of time as it will melt right off. It's august so next week when I make the cake for real I'll use a lemon buttercream with a little meringue powder for stability (thanks, internet!)

My family is a tough crowd to impress when it comes to desserts so I normally stick to the ones I know they like. But i wanted to change it up so i tried this recipe, and it was a huge hit. It was absolutely delicious and there was none left at the end of the day. the cake itself was perfect, and the lemon curd helped to balance the sweetness of the white chocolate. i garnished with raspberries to add a little color.

I've been looking for a very good white cake and I stumbled over this recipe. I only tried the cake part and boy was I not disappointed. The cake turned so moist and not too sweet. I made the cake with swiss meringue buttercream, and was it delicious!!! I wonder how it would turn out if I use real chocolate chunks instead of white chocolate, I'll definitely write back and let you guys know.

I've been on the hunt for a good white chocolate cake recipe, and I'm only reviewing the cake part of this recipe since that's all I made. This cake is FANTASTIC. I'm not a big white chocolate fan, especially in cakes/cupcakes; white chocolate's flavor is so subtle that I usually end up thinking "This just tastes like a white/yellow cake." Not the case with this cake; the white chocolate flavor is subtle, but definitely there. I really like the texture: it's almost like a very plush, springy, fluffy pound cake, both in flavor and texture. It's not overly heavy, though, and is awesome with frosting. I used a different frosting for mine (8 oz. white chocolate, melted with 4 oz. cream and cooled; 1 stick butter; 4 oz. cream cheese; 3-4 cups confectioners sugar; a healthy pinch of salt). Like a previous reviewer, I made 2 9-inch rounds and about 10 cupcakes (it made GREAT cupcakes, too).

This was a great cake. I made 2 9" and the rest into cupcakes. The cake was very moist and I felt it was sort of light which was unexpected but GREAT! I did not make the lemon curd. With the icing, I used my stand mixer with whisk attachment, whipped the cream and then added the white choc/cream mixture AFTER I had let it cool. Next time I'll add a little more white choc or less cream as it makes more than enough icing and the white choc flavor gets a little lost with that much cream.

This is a nice, moist, dense cake. The lemon curd isn't overwhelming, just a nice foil for the frosting. My husband doesn't like lemon curd, so was so-so about the cake. I love lemon curd, so liked it! I did, however, find the cake very rich and very sweet - perhaps a little too much so.

I grew up with my mother making this cake (she's a fantastic baker) and as a young adult myself, this is one of my favorite recipes. It's consistently AMAZING, especially if you know what to expect the first time. The cake layers are seriously dense and moist, so if you're a traditional "cake" fan this might not be your thing, but for someone who prefers frosting to cake, these layers are the perfect texture. I also LOVE lemon curd - it's definitely the star of this cake. Even though you don't use a ton, it's a big flavor component so if you're not wanting a lemony cake this isn't for you. The whipped cream white chocolate frosting is very light, and is more a complement to the lemon curd. One thing to recommend is do NOT skip the parchment rounds; I did that once and 2 of my layers broke off in the pans! This cake makes a fantastic spring/summer birthday cake, or certainly, a wedding cake.

This cake was FREAKING awesome I didn't ass all the sugar to the egg whites but it turned out perfect and I don't know how the other reviewers could give this a bad review I loved it and will be making this again

I was very nervous about making this recipe due to the negative reviews...however, it was definitely a hit at my mother's 76th birthday party. Yes, the layers are heavier than your typical cake, but their texture was wonderfully rich and moist. The mix of lemon and chocolate was divine. Instead of using 2 tbsp lemon rind I used one, and found the lemon curd was not overpowering. I placed some wooden skewers into the cake so that it wouldn't fall apart in transit and this worked wonderfully. I will definitely make this cake again...worth every minute I spent on it!

I have been baking for over 50 years and I cannot remember being as disappointed in a cake as I was with this. Followed the recipe exactly, which obviously took a fair amount of time, and the result was not worth the effort. The cake was heavy, the white chocolate was overwhelmed by the lemon curd and barely discernable when tasting the cake alone.

Rating: 4
This is a really excellent cake. I have made it on many different occasions and it has come out perfectly each time. The only problem that I have with this cake is that since it is so good, each time I mention that I am baking a cake, everyone requests this one and is dissapponited when I show up with a different cake.

It's me again with a report on the wedding cake. It turned out stunningly. The cake is fantastic for a wedding cake as it holds up really well. Make 2 batches for a 14x3" layer, one whole batch for a 10x3" layer. I found other recipes for white chocolate frosting, though, because I didn't want the risk of a whipped cream frosting sitting out too long. For the filling I used raspberry preserves with a layer of white chocolate merengue frosting (also from this site) and since that was really sweet, I used the recipe for chocolate buttercream from baking911.com except used white chocolate instead of regular chocolate. I also coated the cake in chocopan. I'd never used chocopan before but it tastes fantastic, is easy to work with and looks exactly like fondant. I had several people ask me for my card at the wedding--and this was my first wedding cake!

I would like to stand up for this cake and add a positive voice to the recent disappointments some reviewers have expressed. I have made this cake twice. Each time, I made two cakes because I was throwing a HUGE birthday party. I love white cakes, and I think this is one of the better ones and the white chocolate flavour is subtle and perfectly complements a fruit filling. I have never had any trouble with the cake being too dense or too dry (except for the one time I left one batch in the oven a little long). However, it is rich! I find that it is a consistent recipe. I have never made the lemon curd, as I prefer to use raspberry jam with some of the frosting in the middle of the layers--YUM!! One of my friends liked this cake so much that she has asked me to make it for her wedding cake. From my experience, this cake would be perfect for a wedding cake. (I'll let you know it goes later this month!) Unlike other reviewers, I have never had a problem with the cake falling apart (I've always made it in February when it's cold out and I have always made sure to refrigerate/freeze it properly). One recipe of this cake is perfect for a sheet pan. I like to make square cakes. The frosting is also fantastic. I've always found that when I make two batches of the cake, I make two batches of the frosting, and it is quite sufficient. For a simple yet stunning decoration, melt some white chocolate, put it in a parchement cone (or plastic baggie with the corner cut off) and drizzle it diagonally over the top of the cake. Add some fresh spray roses, and you have yourself a stunning cake!

This is a very dense cake.Another review said to carefully fold the egg whites in, etc, etc.I am a pretty experienced baker and this recipe makes a MERINGUE, (which is heavy) to be folded into the batter, and I think it's misprinted and should be egg whites beaten until stiff (without sugar added) which would definately lighten up the cake. Was a dissappointment.

I loved the flavour of this cake. The lemon curd was intense lemon and soooo smooth( I strained it while warm to take out the lemon zest). I found the cake heavy and the assembled cake fell apart on transporting it in my cake carrier. The bottom line is that the filling is soft and smooth and the layers will naturally slip with any movement. I adore the flavours of this cake and might try the curd and icing with a sponge cake and assemble it jelly roll style.

I have never made this cake, but i would like to help stietz from austin. You may be over mixing the cake, that is why it's heavy/dense. From the looks of the recipe, air cells are being developed when the egg whites are being whipped. The air whipped into the whites is what is leavening the cake (at least, that is what is seems). You may be destroying those air cells when you are incorporating the whites w/the rest of mixture. So next time, gently fold the whites into the rest of the batter and don't overmix. Also, you might want to see if your oven is too cool; and if it is, adjust oven temperature. Just a couple of tips that I hope will help.

I've made this cake three times now because I love the flavors, and I keep thinking I'm making a mistake that I will eventually fix. The cake's always too heavy and a little dry and the frosting's always too sfot. This time I was so careful and I added an additional egg white to the batter in hopes of lightening the cake up and an additional ounce of white chocolate in hopes of firming up the frosting but to no avail. If anyone has any advice, please help. I replaced the lemon curd this time with a raspberry curd in addition to adding some frangelico to the frosting and everyone loved the flavor combination.

this is my second time making this recipe but this time i made as a white chocolate pineapple cake. i substituted pineapple for the lemon. i used unsweetened pineapple juice to make the curd and then folded crushed pineapple in the finished curd and refrigerated overnight. i followed the cake recipe as stated but left the white chocolate out of the frosting. it got rave reviews! one person (who has tasted both versions) preferred the pineapple to the lemon!

good! i followed the recipe as stated but using bakers white chocolate (my grocer didn't have any lindt - which would've been my preference) and using a specialty whipping cream. what i got was a very moist delicious cake with a fabulous frosting. the curd recipe was ok, there's a better one on this site that doesn't use cornstarch. i used 2-10 inch pans instead of the 3-9's. this cake is deceptive, it feels light and refreshing on the palate - but after finishing the slice you realize how rich it was. the white chocolate flavor is very subtle, most people didn't even notice it. it turned out better than expected.

The cake was very moist and delicious, but I agree with the last reviewer. When I made the frosting, it did not whip. In order to finish the cake, I had to improvise. I have to say, though, that no one could tell - they all loved it! I will try this one again.

Lovely cake and the flavor was terrific. I made this for a birthday party and everyone had seconds! I did encounter a problem with the frosting. The first batch turned out okay but was not enough to cover the entire cake. The second batch never developed much volume and got a bit grainy. Not sure what the problem was but would appreciate any suggestions.

it might have tasted wonderful... however, it fell apart so badly on the way to a party that I had to abandon it and buy a cake. The layers started cracking and sliding off each other and off the plate. I am an experienced baker and have never had an experience like this. Sure glad it wasn't a wedding cake.

I am giving this one 3 forks even though I could not get the egg whites to whip properly due to high humidity. In an attempt to save this cake, I added 3/4 cup whipped cream with 1/2 cup of sugar and it was just way too heavy. I couldn't use the cake for my little girl's birthday as it was so heavy. But I did break it up and add it to ice cream. The flavors were beautiful despite the texture. I froze the unused cakes. I will use it as a base for another dessert.

This cake is moist and delicious, and the lemon curd is the perfect accompaniement to the subtle white chocolate cake and frosting. The only problem I had with the recipe was the grated lemon peel added to the curd clogged my no. 2 star tip - the lemon peel adds a lot of flavor, but I had to go with a larger tip to frost. This was a good friend's birthday cake and he really liked it! Yum!

This is one of the best cakes I've ever made. It took a while but wasn't difficult. My big mistake was trying to transport it to a friend's house - the layers started to slide and I had to patch it back together. It was so delicious that no one cared that one side was mauled. I'm making it again in a few weeks for a baby shower. Next time I'll wait to assemble it. Great cake!!

I've made this cake three times so far and my daughter has made it once. We really like it...one of the families favorites. One of our family members gets headaches from chocolates so finding recipes that call for white chocolate is wonderful. White Chocolate doesn't give them migranes. It's a great recipe!!!

A variation - this was to be a birthday cake that had to be served with strawberries which my mother-in-law had already purchased. I susbstituted Polaner's Strawberry All-Fruit for the lemon curd and used my own white icing recipe to which I added 1/4 cup melted white chocolate. I decorated the top with icing "balloons" tinted red with Wilton's red paste color and a birthday message. The cake looked great, tasted great, and I think would work with other fruity variations. The cake is a little fussy with the egg whites, but worth it - flavorful, moist & light. Yum! It got raves.

This was wonderful! If you like lemon, and moist white cake - wow. To my surprise, it came out beautifully (I do not always have good luck with whipped cream-type frostings) and it tasted divine. Not too sweet, and the contrast of tart lemon is soo good. It is now a family birthday cake choice!

I used only the cake mix part of the receipe. Adding to it coconut and macadamia. It was very moist, airy, and delicious. I was worried however, about the crust it formed on top.I simply made a milk and sugar syrup and brushed it atop each layer As for a frosting I used cream cheese/white chocolate. A very decadent cake. 10+

The presentation of the cake got a lot of oohs and ahhs from my friends, but I personally found the cake a little on the dry side. In addition, there was not enough frosting to frost the entire cake generously. I would add another half cup of whipped cream to the frosting to add more volume.
