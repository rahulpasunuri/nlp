I made this for a Turtle Pecan Cheesecake, that called for store bought caramel pieces. I wanted to try one from scratch. This made a delicious tasting turtle pecan cheesecake. Or so everyone who had a piece stated. I don't usually eat cheesecake, but did enjoy it, as this sauce really added to the flavor. I would also recommend this on vanilla ice-cream!
