This was a hit at Easter brunch. It was creamy and just delicious. Personally, I wish that there was a version without the cream cheese but perhaps that's what makes it so yummy?!

I doubled the amount of crab meat because I wanted it to be mostly crab, and added some Old Bay and salt/pepper. Turned out GREAT this way.

I made this for a new years eve party and while it was well received, i will cut the mayo to about 1/4 cup next time. The flavor was great but the texture of the lump crab was lost somewhat between the cream cheese and the mayo.

My new favorite recipe for crab dip. Pretty much stuck to the recipe (8 oz. of crab instead of 6), and I cooked longer than 12 minutes so the panko was nicely browned. The lemon zest/panko is a great addition. I can't imagine doubling the amount of crab meat, but next time, I'll increase the amount of crab meat, and maybe add a little parmesan or other cheese.

Excellent recipe. Added more crab (maybe 2-4 oz more) only because I had more than I needed after cracking & retrieving the meat from legs/body, used regular fat mayonnaise, doubled Tabasco, added Old Bay Seasoning. Took it to a super bowl party and then to a church function -- several people requested the recipe after the events were over. It was gone in no time with compliments that it was the best crab dip they ever had to the compliment of OMG this is good! I am making it again tomorrow for a backyard beach party I am having.

Excellent! I made a quadruple batch for my sister's 50th birthday party - it was a huge hit! The only changes I made were to use regular mayo and added Old Bay seasoning. Comments ranged from "Best crab dip ever!" to "first crab dip I've had that you can actually taste the crab". Will definitely use this one over and over again.

Used finely shredded mozzarella, real mayo, Old Bay type seasoning, all chive, no parsley or sweet pepper. Would cut down mayo in future. I wonder if sauteed shredded zucchini, drained after cooking, would be good instead of the sweet pepper.

Excellent and easy to make! Unfortunately, no panko, but no worries. It's delicious without it! I sub'd green onions for chives and added a dash of Old Bay. Yummeeee

I altered the recipe slightly per the previous reviews. My ingredient ratio was 16 oz fresh crab meat, 1 medium red pepper (1 c.), 1 large bunch of flat leaf parsley, 1 bunch scallion greens (about 4 tbs), 3/4 cup regular mayonnaise, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 1/4 tsp tobasco, 1 c. panko, the zest of 2 lemons, 1 tsp. old bay seasoning. It was a huge hit, the entire batch was eaten. It's a delicious crab dip which highlights the seafood flavors.

made the recipe exactly as written (except full-fat mayo) and it turned out great.

Made it according to recipe,good, but not great; tasted better room temp instead of when hot and bubbly, flavor developed as it sat and it became less runny. Would encourage kicking it up a notch like previous reviewers suggested.

Fantastic. Everyone loved it.

Excellent and easy. I used less red pepper and parsley and added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. Served it with baked pita chips. It was gone in no time!

Delicious with my own twist/adaptation with less fattening ingredients, ie greek yogurt, 1/3 fat cream cheese (we find that full fat cream cheese tends to overpower the flavor of the crab), no milk. Added Chipotle Chili Pepper (ground by McCormick's) to Panko topping. Loved the lemon as it really brightened the flavors. Since we have fresh crabs available, we steamed/cooked/picked our blue crabs providing us with succulent lump fresh from the Chesapeake Bay. My husband loved it.

I loved this recipe. I also made a variation of it to go with my low carb diet- I used ground almonds ( almond flour) as the topping. I also have used tuna instead of crab, added red pepper flakes and cayenne for a wonderful spicy variation. It's a great recipe to build from, but great the way it is too.

We catch a lot of our own crab and I am always looking for new recipes. This is a good one! I added extra lemon juice and doubled the panko and lemon zest for the topping. Let the hot dish cool and set up for about 10-15 minutes before serving. Red pepper is a must!

funny but not amiable.... but I do "concur." Looks like the same old same old but I'll still try it. Never added the Panko before but will probably also add Worstershire. As usual. It will still be yummy I'm sure! Gonna serve it as a 'cook's appetizer while preparing a cajun dinner for my Mom's b-day. My Grandma's gonna LOVE it!
