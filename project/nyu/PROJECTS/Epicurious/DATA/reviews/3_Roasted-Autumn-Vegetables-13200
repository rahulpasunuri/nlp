I had to adjust the cooking time by adding 10 min. to each section. I would use a little less oil the next time. But it was a fantastic dish...very flavorful. I'm going to serve it for Thanksgiving as a side dish. Being a "sometime" vegetarian, I found this dish to be an excellent "one pot meal"! (is there an EASY way to peel Acorn Squash)?

This was very good and easy to make as much of the preparation could be done ahead. I added carrots and brussel sprouts to the recipe (blanching the brussel sprouts for about a minute), as well as using garlic flavored olive oil and a bit of roasted garlic. I prepared all my vegetables several hours in advance putting them in plastic bags with the olive oil for coating, saving last minute work. Just plopped them into the pan for roasting while the main dish "rested" on the counter. Very tasty, a rich blend of flavors!

This recipe was great! used sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash(had some left over from Thanskgiving) can't wait to make it again!
