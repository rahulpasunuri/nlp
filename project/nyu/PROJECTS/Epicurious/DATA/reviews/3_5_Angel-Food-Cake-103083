Excellent recipe. Left out the ginger and followed the recipe exactly, including beating in the flour instead of folding.Cake only took 29 minutes to bake.

Ok, so this was my first attempt at angel food cake and although the ginger added quite a nice touch to the recipe, overall I did not win. I am going to guess that it was the lack of cake flour that did me in and that I baked it too long. Mine was well done after 34 minutes when I checked it. Should have check it sooner. Angel food cake won round one, I will win round two.

The cake rose perfectly, and the texture is just right. I had never made angel food cake before, and feel quite proud. I didn't have cake flour, and substituted two tablespoons of cornstarch to regular flour and sifted three times before beginning. Nor did I have superfine sugar. I processed can sugar in the food processor for about three minutes to create a substitute. I also used a vanilla bean instead of plain vanilla and omitted the ginger and the almond, as we don't like ginger, and I was out of the almond extract. I would add the almond next time. I also wonder if anyone feels it needs more salt?

I haven't made this yet, but you can use 4 egg yolks in key lime pie (this site) that's good. I think you can also freeze them but haven't tried that myself yet.

This was my first try to make angel food cake--it was light as a cloud and so refreshing, worth the effort to separate the eggs. Served with fresh strawberries. This will be my classic recipe (no ginger added). Does anyone know what to make with 11 egg yolks?

Other than folding in the flour, this recipe is a very good one. Used regular sugar without issues. The 'run a knife through the batter' step should protect you against lopsidedness, so don't skip that. The ginger was a very good (and we thought subtle) addition - mine was pretty new too,so I'm not certain why it came out overpowering for others.

I made it for my dads birthday and it turned out perfectly! I have made many angel food cakes before and this was definitely the best recipe I have ever come across. I followed what others said about folding in the flour at the end instead of beating it in, which I believe helped significantly.

Following the recipe as-is is a mistake. It is important to gently FOLD in the flour, do not beat it in. I felt the instructions were questionable but I followed them anyway. The result was a cake that did not rise at all. Without any air left in the batter it came out compact and dense. Tasted fine, but texture was completely off.

This was amazing. It was my moms birthday, she loved it. I would definitely make this again, and would never buy this cake at the store. Just not the same!!!

This is probably the worst I have ever had an Epicurious cake turn out--and I have made LOTS of them over the years. I think it is about to ruin my rep as a pastry chef...I actually made two of these today. The first was a disaster and came out in chunks from the pan (and btw, didn't rise either). I figured my bad, and it was easy to make, so I tried again with a different pan, scrupulously cleaned and I followed the directions exactly (except for folding rather than beating)--but it didn't rise over the pan--and it is so lopsided, it looks like some wacky Alice-in-Wonderland dessert. My good friend wanted angel food cake for her b-day party tomorrow and I am not sure how I'm going to rescue this one. I've been eating the first one as I made the second and it does taste really good, but presentation is important, too, and this one just doesn't rate 3 or 4 forks in that category.

The perfect Angel food cake recipe. I omitted the ginger and added an extra teaspoon vanilla for the perfect flavor. Enjoy this one...it is sooo good.

This was my first attempt at an angel food cake from scratch. It came out great. I did not use the ginger because I wanted a more traditional cake. It was pretty easy to make. All the sifting is really worth while. Made this for a birthday gathering and it got raves. Definitely on my regular rotation now.

This was an efficient way to use my extra egg whites. The ginger is a nice surprise. I actually forgot my head while making it and sifted all of the sugar in with the flour, so I beat the whites with an additional two tablespoons of sugar and then added the rest of the dry ingredients in batches. The cake turned out very well - a little more dense than a boxed angel food cake - which is what I like anyway. I've only made it once, so I don't know if I lost volume because of my mistake or not.

DO NOT USE EGG WHITE PRODUCTS FOR THIS RECIPE!! I used "Whippin' Whites" and had to start over again with real egg whites. Agree with other opinion about WAY too much cream of tartar. Cake went well with macerated berries and Devonshire cream.

This was also my first time making angel food cake. I made it for my husbands birthday because he loves angel food cake. Followed recipe exact. Served it with homemade whipped cream and strawberry sauce. FANTASTIC!

This is my first time at making an Angel Food Cake and it turned out fantastic! It rose beautifully. Served it with whipped cream and strawberries. Next time I am going to try the Oregon reviewer's tip and beat in the flour, etc., as I love a dense-type cake.

This cake was good served with strawberries marinated for 30 minutes in Grand Marnier and a little sugar and Devonshire cream. The cake serves 12 people. I did not use superfine sugar. I did not have cake flour, so I sifted the flour and then substituted 1 T. corn starch for 1 T. flour for each cup of flour. I used 1.5 t. ginger - I would not have minded a little more. I folded in the flour as suggested by another reviewer and the cake was nice and light. A great spring dessert.

My 1st attempt at an Angel Food Cake and WOW. It was fantastic. Took another reviewer's advice and folded in the flour vs. beating it in. Also omitted the ginger. Served cake with strawberries and whipped cream! My family loved it. Note: Super fine sugar is so expensive. You can make your own by putting regular sugar in a food processor for a few minutes.

I'm going to make this tomorrow and modify it for sugar-free. To the previous reviewer, I am not a pastry chef but I think you are safe on all dessert recipes to assume "vanilla" means the extract unless it specifically says bean or powder.

Rating: 0
Could someone please tell me whether the "vanilla" in this recipe refers to ground vanilla or vanilla extract? Many thanks!

INCREDIBLY GOOD CAKE! I cut the ginger usage in 1/2 which turned out to be just right for my tastebuds. Highly recommend this one.

As a culinary student, I have a few tips that might help in getting a higher, lighter cake. One is that it's very important to fold the flour into the whites, despite what the recipe says. Do not beat it in! This is how you get the most volume from your cake, by keeping all the air that you have beaten into your egg whites. (Same reason the flour is sifted so many times, to keep the lightness and not deflate the whites) Two, you must invert the cake on a bottle to let it cool, otherwise it WILL collapse. Once you know that, it's actually a very easy cake to make and relatively guilt=free! good luck!!!

I made a variation for my husband's birthday & everyone loved it (my husband scraped the cake plate). I increased the recipe by 1/3 and made 11 small cakes baked for 20 minutes in springform pans. I formed the cakes into a flower (two circles of five & one to top the cake) then drizzled the cake with lemon icing (sifted powdered sugar, lemon juice, grated lemon peel, vanilla and lemon coloring). Served it with fresh diced pineapple, pureed & seeded frozen rasberries with liquer and a dollop of non-fat sour cream blended with lemon juice and sifted powdered sugar. The recipe is now a staple!

This cake was basically the best mistake I've ever made. Instead of folding in the flour mixture, I dutifully followed recipe instructions (being a rookie) and beat it in on low speed. The result was a soft, dense, springy cake that smelled and tasted like heaven, with a super-fine texture. I brought it to a pot-luck party (accompanied by devonshire cream and assorted berries), and even though cutting it required a bit of sawing because of the springiness, it was devoured within the hour. I skipped the ginger because I'm not the biggest fan in the world; however, I'm thinking of flavoring it with a bit of cocoa and Frangelico the next I make this. Definitely my "keeper" recipe, and I'm going to repeat my mistake again some time in the future just because I like that dense, fine texture so much.

Rating: 3
Yes...I agree. This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box. I do like the ginger. It gives this cake a more custard like taste. I imagine I can use lemon, almond, orange or whatever taste I would like. I wonder if anyone knows of any tricks that could take it to 5 in.

I want to correct my earlier review of 1 fork. I still have not been able to get the highrising results I seek, but I have made this cake 3 times and each time it improves. I've experimented with different pans and ingredients. The last time the taste and texture were so good my husband thought it was store-bought, but I didn't get a cake 5 inches high, which one of your reviewers did even without the proper ingredients. I'll keep checking this out, as it's a tasty lowfat recipe with berries of the season.

Delicious cake! I didn't have either cake flour, nor superfine sugar & cake still rose to 5 in. I'm sure it will be even lighter & higher w/correct ingredients.

Very good recipe!! This was my first time making an Angel Food Cake. I bought an Angel Food Cake pan with the removeable bottom at a garage sale a while back and have been working up the encouragement to make one (I heard how complicated they are). I was really surprised that it did turn out. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the ginger seems a little stong and out of place. I didn't cook it long enough because the top was getting brown and I though it was burning. After removing it from the pan after cooling I realized that it was not burning and it was still a little soggy. I put it back into the oven to dry it out. Overall though it was very light and fluffy. I think I will make it again tonight without the ginger and cook it for the recommended amount of time. I have came across a superfine professional grade sugar that C & H makes thats now available at grocery stores. It costs about 2-3 times as much as regular sugar (imagine my horror when I caught my husband using it for coffee!!) but it makes a huge difference in any desserts that require sugar to melt fast and not bead up on the finished product. I definatly recommend using it for this recipe.

This cake was delicious! I didn't use the ginger and because I couldn't find my other cake pan, I had to use a springform pan. I also mixed all the sugar and flour together by mistake. The result was a more dense angel food cake and it was amazing! It was more like a light pound cake, so I covered it with freshly whipped cream and surrounded it with strawberries. I could not keep my guests away from it. I definitely recommend this recipe.

Excellent texture. I used regular granulated sugar and only 2 teas. of ginger. I did not "sift flour into egg whites". It worked just fine. It cut well with a serrated knife.
