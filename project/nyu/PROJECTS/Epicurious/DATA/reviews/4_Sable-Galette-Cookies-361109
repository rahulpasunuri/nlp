These cookies are amazing!!!! You do not need the butter. Margerine works great. My kids love them & nice enough for entertaining.

This is an incredibly easy, yummy cookie! I did not use margarine. I used unsalted butter. I also did not have any orange blossom water on hand. When I pulsed the ingredients in the food processor, I noticed that the mixture did not come together with the addition of only 1 T. cold water. I added another tablespoon, and then another. I do not think that the amount of liquid (3 T. in all) is optional, though the orange blossom water flavor may be. I wouldn't omit the egg wash dusted with sugar. The egg wash and sugar created a pretty, sweet glaze on top of the cookies, and it helped enhance a golden-brown baked color.

I love the idea of this, but would never use margarine for baking. If anyone had tried this cookie, I'd be interested in hearing how it is.
