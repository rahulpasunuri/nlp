Did not work out, pork was undercooked and very salty. The vegetables were nice, a little mushy, the family was not impressed.

I have a very picky son and he devours this recipe. I have had great luck with this. It is a big hit with company. You can get everything in the oven and have some time to relax with guests.

I marinated for about 45 minutes prior to roasting. Used a convection oven at 400 degrees. I took the meat out at 135 degrees and let it rest tightly in foil...came out way too dry. The veggies were delish though and were done at the same time as the roast...I didn't roast them longer. Next time I will not use convection, and I will marinate the pork overnight.

This recipe didn't turn out at all for me. The veggies were mush and the pork undercooked. Given the other reviews, I'm at a loss. Maybe I did something very wrong.

I'm a porkaholic, and this recipe is one of my favorites. Though I typically find it takes days to get marinades into pork, the rub in this recipe adds a great deal of flavor in a very short span of time. I found the recipe turned out great prepared exactly as written, which is a bit of a departure for me... I usually love tweaking things to suit myself. This roast makes a regular appearance at our dinner table through the winter months.

This turned out really well - The pork was tender, juicy and flavorful. I did have an issue with my veggies, however - some were wonderfully caramelized, others were more carbonized. I would make it again, but I'd keep an eye on the veggies.

this was really good--my husband and I spent a few hours salivating at the fabulous aroma while it cooked, and the dish certainly lived up to that...I cut back a little on the vegetables (maybe a third less carrots and potatoes), since we used a slightly smaller pork loin and were only 3 people for dinner. Also, and this is important, I used one generous teaspoon of salt in the rub and maybe a half teaspoon directly on the vegetables, along with 1 tablespoon (scant) of sherry vinegar, and some pepper. The other comment is that it took longer than I expected to roast, maybe because I only heated my oven to 400 since I was using a nonstick roaster--probably 2.5 hours all told, from when I put in the veggies for their pre-roast and carved the roast pork at the end. Very easy to make, just not fast.

I made this for my extended family last night. Great meal to make for company. Everything done in advance. An earlier reviewer said they browned the roast and then out on the marinade. Wish I had done the same. Missed having a crust to the roast. Afraid that might prevent the marinade from absorbing, but maybe you could brown and pierce with a fork to let it soak in. The veggies were great and although I have some left I would not cut back. They make nice leftovers. I served with brocolli raab as a side dish. The deep green made a nice contrast on the plate.

I made this awesome dish last night for a dinner party, everyone loved it! I used pork tenderloin from Costco and marinated it overnight in the mustard rub. I usually think of pork as being dry and bland but this was very flavorful and moist. For the veggies I substituted sweet potato for the new potato, and I would recommend using only one onion and adding more fennel. I cooked twice the amount of pork to feed 10 people, but kept the same amount of veg, more than enough! If you are cooking for the 6 people I'd cut the veg portions in half. All in all a great dish, no fuss, and minimal time in the kitchen so I was able to visit with my guests. I'll be making this again for Christmas dinner with the inlaws!

Might have had a wee much salt in the mustard sauce and I would have appreciated a cripier crust from the sauce, too. Very simple, very straightforward ... very likely to become a regular on my menu.

The roast of pork was juicy and tender. I am not a fan of pork but this dish was delicious. I left the pork in the oven until the pork read exactly 150 degrees. The vegetables were also very tasty. Cut the salt to 1/2 tablespoon. Would definately make this recipe again

Excellent!!! The veggies were amazing and the pork was moist and tender. Definitely add the fennel. I was short on potato so I also added sweet potatoes which were also delicious.

Damn. This recipe was amazing. Seeing as i'm a total idiot when cooking, the fact that everything worked out for me says a lot about this drop dead easy recipe. I had a 6 pound piece of pork and doubled the marinade (i used normal salt which worked out fine), I also added 3 extra big cloves of garlic for oomph and used grey poupon. As i tasted the marinade, i began to freak out cause it tasted like ass (or rather, what i assume ass tastes like). I rubbed it in all over, unlike what Ina did on her show (she only spread it on top of the pork) and also marinated it over night. For the veggies I added 3 zucchini to the mix and cooked everything in one pan low and slow at 325 for a few hours (my mom check on it for me ha ha ha). When the pork was done, we took it out and cooked the veggies on a higher heat and then broiled it until they were browned and crisped. HEAVEN! The meat was prefectly seasoned and not too salty at all, the veg was divine and I had a whole crew of appreciative family members who were impressed that fennel (an unknown vegitable in my house) tasted so darned good.

The vegetables were amazing! The fennel combined with the spice rub was out of control. The pork itself, while juicy, totally lacked flavor if there was no spice crust on the piece. But when I put a slice of vegetables on top of each piece of pork I popped in my mouth, it was great. Next time I think I'll marinate this overnight to let the pork absorb some more flavor.

-very salty -very dry, roast was raw in middle but dry at surfaces -lots of leftovers, guess I'll turn it into soup

Made this Christmas Eve and it was divine. Only problem was the veggies were a little burnt; I did not cook them 30 min. before the roast, but did it altogether. Next time I'll make absolutely sure the pork is at room temperature. I think this is the only way to ensure pork and veggies finish cooking at the same time.

I said I'd make this again, but it's a qualified yes; I will only make the vegetables! The pork was mediocre, without much noticeable flavor from the mustard coating/marinade, despite sitting longer than recommended. The veggies, as noted by others, are out of this world! My kids were scraping the serving platter for the onions! I'll try doing these as a side for a different roast.

These veggies are superb! Pork is good, but veggies are amazing! Next time I will double the veggies and roast a separate tray in addition just to have more to eat. I used small whole carrots, small whole potatoes, and small whole zucchini in addition to the fennel and onion and they all just melted in my mouth. A keeper!

This pork roast was fantastic. It was extremely juicy and the roasted vegetables were delicious. I browned the roast for two minutes on each side, then coated it with the sauce and let it stand for an hour. I do wish that I had followed others' advice and used a bit less salt. I did skip the first 30 minutes of roasting the vegetables and just cooked them along with the roast. I let the roast rest for 20 minutes and roasted the vegetables for about half that time. The result was a wonderful, memorable meal. I also used half of a six pound pork roast from Costco, and I'm going to make the other half the same way this week!

Absolutely delicious! Perfect for company. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is just fabulous and a no-brainer. I don't know of anything that I make that is better suited for a large dinner party. Amazing flavors, all done is one pan and "meat and potato" foundation that appeals to even the most unadventurous eater. Beautiful and easy to present as well. I have served up to 12 people in one seating with this dish and your guests show up and your kitchen is spotless and smells divine. I always serve this with rustic bread and a walnut, pear, blue cheese salad over greens because it balances it while holding up to the hearty and aromatic flavors. Most importantly I have never served this to anyone that didn't fall over backwards over it. I just can't recommend this enough. I will concur with some of the posters that 1 hour is the MAX you would want to roast the vegatables, other than that it's perfect.

I loved it as did all of my guests. The vegetables were excellent even for those picky eaters and the pork was juicy and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe seemed like it would be delicious, but it was not. Though the vegetables were good, the pork rub only flavors the skin of the pork, leaving the meat itself completely devoid of any flavor. While the meat is moist, there are plenty of other ways to roast pork in a juicy thoroughly flavorful way. We will not make this again.

OUTSTANDING!! Quite easy to put together and my guests all raved - had 10 for dinner so used extra 1/2 loin and added more veggies - I had forgotten how great the taste of fennel bulb is. Definitely a do-again!!

Omit the salt -- the salt in the mustard is more than enough. Juicy pork. Great leftovers.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! I cooked the vegetables in a separate roasting pan for the same length of time as the pork roast, one hour. Although I thought that cooking the pork to only 138 degrees would result in a roast that was too rare, this was not the case. Everything was cooked to perfection. The pork roast surrounded by the vegetables on a large platter resulted in a lovely presentation at the table.

Very good rub for the pork, it truly made this roast memorable. Next time I will try browning the roast first then spreading the rub on, it would make for a better presentation. Otherwise I really would not change anything else.

I could make this on every cold-weather Sunday and no one in my family would complain. So simple and such great flavor.

My husband and kids LOVED the roasted veggies. Too bad I only had one large potato... they were fighting over it. Made a gravy with the juices that accumulated as the roast rested as well as the pan drippings. The roast was very moist. Served with rice and green salad. Oh, the Oregon Pinot Noir is a must.

I can't wait to make this recipe again! The roast was delicious, but the sublime carmelized vegetables absolutely make the dish. As recommended, I started the vegetables at 425 for first half hour. After cooking the pork for 15 minutes at 425, I lowered the temperature to 350 for the next half hour, then upped it to 425 again while the meat was resting. I also tossed a handful of thyme sprigs in with the butter and oil. Next time, I will add more onions as they really melted away and they were SO GOOD. Also, will reduce the salt to 2 teaspoons. Pork makes great sandwich leftovers, too.

This was fantastic! I did 1/3 of the recipe. I let my 1# loin sit on the counter slathered in the mustard concoction for 1 hour. One half of that hour I roasted the vegies at 425 degrees. Put the loin in for 55 minutes until it reached 140 on the probe thermometer(one of my better investments!) I stirred the vegies every 15 minutes. After resting the roast for 10 minutes, the inner temp rose to 153. It was the juiciest pork roast I've ever had! Easy & elegant for company. Just make sure you use a large enough pan so the vegies can stretch out & bask in butter & olive oil.

The roasted veggies are to-die-for, but 425 was WAY TOO high for the pork, which was not juicy. My second try was much more successful: 425 for 10 minutes, then 325 oven until meat reached 138 degrees. I would have liked a gravy recipe with this as there are not many pan juices.

Rating: 4
An AWESOME recipe! The only things I did different was that I browned the roast really well, then put on the mustard coating; then I roasted it at 350 for approx 2 hours,until internal temp. was 145. The meat was tender and melt-in-your mouth. The mustard coating didn't taste like mustard, but just added wonderful flavor to the whole dish.

We had this on Christmas Eve and found it to be wonderful. The fennel gave such an incredible taste to the pork. We, too, used a 4 pound loin and adjusted the amounts and cooking time.

The obligatory substitutions: I divided the recipe by three, since I didn't have six people to feed. I used Yukon gold potatoes (which turned out great). The rub was too salty for my taste and many of the vegetables were charred to a crisp. I think the recipe might depend on crowding the roasting pan to prevent burning, which I didn't do.

Rating: 3
Very tasty!!! I Loved the rub that goes on the pork. I left it on for an hour rather then a half hour. Next time I'll make a gravy from all the good stuff left in the roasting pan.
