This recipe struck me as a bit bland as described here. Adding a bit of cumin, black pepper, and chili powder picked it up a bit though.

I`m a soup lover. curiously today I thought about the fact that soup can heal most physical pain and in my own appreciation i`d say most spiritual illnesses also. I changed this soup a bit. For i am not a good jalapeño (per se) digester, i`ll try jalapeño powder next time. So i used a bit of red and black pepper. I made my own broth and added an extra bit of oregano and garlic. Also i used Most broth than water (4 1/2 broth and 2 cups of water) and i did used more avocado and blended a part of them to give more consistency and tiny more thickness because the way the recipe goes, it does come out kinda watery. The lime makes this soup glorious... I just made it and couldn`t wait to let you guys know...

This is a good basic recipe but I couldn't' give it four stars since I (and others) had to make so many adjustments to the recipe. As written it is too bland and watery. I added more garlic, jalapeno and poblano peppers and crushed tomatoes, and it worked. Definitely do not use more water.

This is a good, light recipe. I'm going to spend some time playing with it, there was not enough heat for me.

Oh...forgot to mention: used 6 cups broth instead of 3 broth and 3 water. Can't imagine it watered down any further, and wouldn't recommend skimping on broth for water.

I think this recipe could probably be a 4-fork recipe with some tweaking, but I'm a novice cook so perhaps I'm not the one to blaze that path! I'll definitely be making it again. Like another reviewer mentioned, I'd probably either up the vegetables or increase the time they're simmered (I did the latter but also increased the garlic). I added a chile along with the 1/2 jalapeno...not enough heat for me, next time I'll be looking for ways to increase the heat factor. The lime is fantastic (one additional tablespoon did not make it overwhelming). After straining the broth and re-adding the chicken I added a few half-wedges of tomato and some corn kernels. Very tasty! The tortilla strips were delicious, and a piece of briefly-fried ciabatta (because I only had one tortilla left) was also excellent.

Loved it! So light and tasty.I had lots of cooked chicken in the house so I used that and used all broth instead of water. The lime gives it such a bright kick. Next time I will try some of the suggestions of others - they sound great.

I have made this recipe several times - I really love the 'base' recipe, but, like others, I make modifications that make the recipe work well for me. I add tomatoes and black beans, omit the tortilla strips, and probably add a little extra lime, (love the acidity), garlic, and cilantro. I love the richness added by the avocado. Usually, I use a serrano chili, rather than half of a jalapeno. THe base recipe is a fine 'start' -- from there, modify it to suit your own taste. Sooooo nice to have something other than chicken noodle...

I doubled the recipe, added cooked white rice, canned corn, & white pepper. I bar-b- qued the boneless chiken breast, shredded it and added to broth. I used canned diced jalapenos & minced garlic. I sprinked parmesan cheese on top with tortilla strips. Very spicy! Loved it! Beats El Polo Loco.

I too enjoyed this dish. IAs did the cook from Long beach, I found I had to extend the cooking time of the chicken because I like large breasts.

This soup was horrible. It was so bland and wasn't exactly quick and easy. Yuk yuk yuk. My friends and I threw it in the sink and went out for ice cream.

I was disappointed in this soup.It was certainly missing something.Perhaps a richer broth base.The cubed advacadoes procured an odd texture to the soup.I did like the idea of the tortilla strips!

This soup was perfectly delicious exactly as-is. Such a light, clean taste. I did have to simmer the chicken for longer than the 15 minutes; but I used rather large breasts. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was a great soup, but I did change some things. I used a green chile (Anaheim) instead of jalapeno and increased the amt. of cilantro. I let the chicken simmer for 30 minutes and let the broth simmer longer, to blend the flavors. All told, it simmered about 2 hours total. When I strained the broth, I put the veges. in cheesecloth and put it back in the mixture. I added more leftover chicken pieces, a couple of handfuls of tri-color rotini noodles, and, just a few minutes before serving, added a DASH of garam masala. Topped it off with tortilla strips and shredded monterey jack/colby cheese. Yum!

This was really bland. It was missing something... it needed a bit of a kick. I won't make this again....

Doubled the tortillas, and scattered shredded jack cheese on. Very tasty, and all my 4 kids loved it, even my two picky eaters. Better to double all portions -- what little is left is more delicious later.
