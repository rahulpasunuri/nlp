Mmmmmmm. Delicious! The vegetable ragout was great all by itself and the addition of scallops put it over the top. Rather than open a can of vegetable broth, I used the scallop water.

My freinds and familie's eyes light up when I make this. Unfortunately it is a seasonal recipe and the ingredients are only avaiable for a short time. Scallops are also a rare treat so I use just about any kind of fish I can get.But it is worth the wait.

This recipe had lots of flavor and great spring vegetables. I would use a small sweet onion instead of a large one next time.

Fast, easy, and light but lacking flavor.

Terrific and FAST! I served this as an appetizer and it was almost hearty enough for an entree. The veggies here are all green, so next time I will zip up the color by dicing a red/yellow pepper finely and sprinkling over the top or use some edible flowers. The flavor is wonderful - a real hit.

This dish was simple, quick, and visually appealing. The vegetable ragout was the highlight, and practically shouted "springtime!"

This recipe has a nice bright fresh flavor to it. I think a little more broth might make it even better. It is pretty easy and it looks really great.

My son loves scallops and chose this recipe while looking through the magazine. It was great! Next time I will increase the broth to 1/2 cup and increase the lemon juice to 2-3 T. I also think that when I make this again I will drizzle each serving with 1 t. of white truffle oil. A beautiful springtime entree!

Excellent! Everyone raved about it and I would make it again in a heartbeat.

I absolutely loved this recipe and wouldn't change a thing about it. It goes very well with Chardonnay and some crusty french bread. My entire family loved it. Very impressive and beautiful presentation. Easy to prepare.

We thought this recipe was good, not great. Watch the salting in the recipe. We found it a bit overpowering. My husband seemed to enjoy it at first and then became very bored half way through the meal
