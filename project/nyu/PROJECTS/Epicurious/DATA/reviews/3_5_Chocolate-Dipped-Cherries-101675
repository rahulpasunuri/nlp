What about the pits; do you leave them in?

I've made these two times. The first time I didn't think they were anything special, and neither did my guests. The second time I used the same incrediants but I left them in the fridge for overnight. The taste was so-ooo much better. My guests loved them!

To give the extra flavor without thickening the chocolate, use the jarred cocktail cherries, drained well. Soak them overnight in the liquor of your choice - kirsch works nicely - or in a simple syrup with vanilla added. Then drain, dry well and dip. Lots of flavor, perfect chocolate.

i made this recipe then added my own stuff to it. On some cherries, i sprinkled coconut shavings, others, chocolate sprinkles, and some i decorated with white chocolate designs. My family loved them!

Excellent, quick, elegant & easy! The other reviewer's suggestion about adding vanilla is good -- but it does cause the chocolate to get thicker & stickier (thus requiring the addition of the Crisco).

excellent, elegant, and EASY to make dessert. i brought this to a dinner party and got so many compliments. people couldn't believe i did it myself, and couldn't believe the chocolate was just plain old bittersweet chocolate, and not some ornate sauce i was slaving away over. a perfect dessert when you need something easy and elegant

Easy enough to make! I added a dash of vanilla extract and almond extract just to give it more flavor. One thing I found, though, is that I had to add about a tablespoon of Crisco to soften up the chocolate enough so that I could dip the cherries in it.
