I've used this recipe several times and we love it. I usually make some minor changes depending on what I am using it for. Mostly, I "heat it up" a bit with a chopped jalepeno and use it as a taco filling. I also used it as a stuffing for (New Mexico)hatch peppers; I roasted, skinned and seeded the peppers then added the filling (left out the peas and added raisins) and baked with Mexican cheese crumbled on top for 30 min in a 350 F oven. Yummy! It's a winner!

I also added green and yellow peppers. Added a bit more garlic and cayenne pepper. Put in a chilli bowl and topped with cheddar cheese...delicious.

Very nice and easy, my husband loved i. I added some olives at the same time with the capers and gave it a really nice taste.

Pretty good. Had over hot soft polenta but wide noodles would be good, too. Quick and easy.

Excellent! Put the finished product in turnover pastry shells and bake - makes a nice empanada.

Delicious! I made the recipe as is and loved it. I stirred the beef quite a bit to break it into small pieces, and it had just the right texture. I used the leftovers the next night in the Layered Taco Salad recipe from Gourmet. A winner.

Simple to make, I cooked it a little longer to thicken it up. I prefer the picadillo recipe on Epicurious with green olives and raisins, so I will not make this again, but I enjoyed the change.

Very nice and easy, and to have it with rice is an interesting change from the usual red beans. I also very much liked the capers to give it a bit of tang. And with the peas you have your veggies as well!

My husband & I thought this was a great recipe, and have tried it several times, with some variations on the theme. Our favorite version was when I added a handful of raisins, some sliced green olives, and substituted chicken for the beef. It was great served in tortillas and garnished with a little cheese and some cilantro.

This recipe halves well for 2 people. I served it over chips and garnished with cheese, cilantro and sour cream. I also added some paprika and chili powder.

A fairly easy mid-week meal. I made it more or less as directed except I halved the amount of everything except the spices, broth, and capers (b/c I really like them). It made 4 healthy sized portions with only 1 lb of meat, so I can imagine that the full recipe is quite large. I was going to serve it on rice, but when I discovered I only had a 1/4c left, I just threw it into the pan with the broth and tomatoes.

My husband loved this dish. It's savory, flavorful, and fairly easy to make. I also subbed corn for the peas, and I left out the capers. I used Basmati rice which really enhanced the flavor.

Total comfort food. I had defrosted some chopped beef, but I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it. I turned to epicurious and found this. Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the peas and used corn instead -- hubby doesn't like peas, poor soul. Served it with rice. The capers add a nice flavor, I don't know why someone said they couldn't taste them - try before and after. Quick, easy and good. Not company food.

For me this is a refreshing grown-up twist on the basic hamburger-tomato (either w/rice or elbow mac) skillet supper that my mom made when we were kids. I followed the recipe except I used green peppers, which probably made the finished product less sweet. Served with flour tortillas. Took just 45-minutes to prepare, this is a weeknight meal that will be a pleasure to enjoy again.

Surprisingly delicious for the amount of time it took to prepare and cook this dish! I had fresh tomatillos left over from another recipe and added them to the mixture and thought it was a nice addition. I didn't really taste the capers and will add more the next time. I served this with brown basmati rice and thought the texture was a nice combination with the picadillo. Definitely a great weeknight meal!

This is really terrific and it is FAST. I've made is several times and will make it again. It is fun for kids and adults as well.

Pleasantly surprised with the results. I omitted the peas and enjoyed the addition of capers to this dish. I'm more accustomed to the traditional Mexican version of picadillo and this was a bit sweeter than I expected but it still reminds me of flavors I enjoyed in my mother's and grandmother's cooking. A nice, simple dish.
