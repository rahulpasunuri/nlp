It tasted like banana/peanut butter cardboard. Except it was as hard as a rock; leaving it out for a day and a half would work better.

Other people really liked this, but I thought it was blah. I wanted more peanut butter and banana flavor. I might try it again because I am a lover of PB and banana, but I would add more of both ingredients, and more vanilla.
