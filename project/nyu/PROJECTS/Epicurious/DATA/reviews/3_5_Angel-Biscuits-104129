I wish I had read Stephanie from NC's advice before making these for Thanksgiving. Mine turned out very heavy and practically inedible. I think the problem is that the yeast simply cannot grow, except very slowly, once the dough is in the frig: duh!

I just made this dough for baking on Thksgvng. I'm a little nervous because it's crumbly/dry - not sticky at all. I live in Illinois and am originally from Phila, so no experience with a good biscuit. Is the dough supposed to be sticky? I baked a test biscuit as soon as I mixed and the flavor was fabulous, but I'm still wondering if the whole batch will come out OK...any advice?

My mama taught me to make these when I was a little girl. What this recipe doesn't tell you is that they turn out a lot better if you let them rise for about an hour before baking, and that the dough really should be made at least a day ahead.

I cut vegetable shortening out and used unsalted butter

These were very disappointing. Even follwing the cooking time stated in the recipe, the biscuits were not cooked all the way through and I had to return them to the oven. Took them to a dinner and while everyone took one, no one finished them and no one went for seconds. Even my friend John who loves everything I make, did not like these.

This recipe was a huge hit for a family get together. None left over! I used White Lily flour which is a soft wheat flour and also followed the advice of others and used butter flavored shortening. We also folded the biscuits over a couple of times and teh result were flaky layered DELICIOUS biscuits.

My mom always made angel biscuits--they really need to be made two days ahead and punched down every day. But I've never met anyone who didn't like them.

We used cake flour and recommend it for this recipe. We followed the directions for the 2 1/2 high biscuits. It took 15 minutes to cook these instead of 12 minutes in our oven. They were very light, very fluffy and very plain. If you want buttery tasting biscuits, try the butter flavored shortening instead of the unflavored. However, even plain, they tasted wonderful! This dough was so easy to work with the after it's overnight wait that it is ideal for the child-cooks. It wasn't sticky, difficult to roll, or difficult to cut. One thing we did do was to let the dough return to room temperature (30-60 min) before baking it. The dough is very cold after allowing it to sit in the refigerator the night before. You may need to moisten the outside of the dough and place a wet towel over the bowl just to keep it from drying out (we did this).

The biscuits were so light and tasty. Add a touch of Cheddar Cheese and they are much more tastier.

Prepared these for Easter dinner. Rose very high and smelled delicious. Were light and flakey. A nice yeasty change from my standard Southern biscuits. Should have followed previous reviewer's advise and used butter instead of shortening. Went well with my grandmother's chicken and dumpling recipe.

Made these with butter and all purpose flour. Mixed dough the day before using dry instant yeast straight into recipe with no proofing. Rolled out and baked perfectly--Light, layered and delicious. Going to make again and again.

These were some of the best biscuits I have ever made and they were so easy. I did use all cake flour and half shortening and half salted butter. I mixed the dry ingredients with the butter/shortening coarsely in the food processor and then stirred that into the yeast and buttermilk mixture with a spatula. The dough folded out beautifully the next morning and cooked up to a light, flavorful, fluffy biscuit.

The biscuits were not at all fluffy, and although I baked them for over 20 minutes, there were still not cooked through.

These were hard and not fluffy at all.

These biscuits were a big hit at Thanksgiving. I made a test batch and when I realized I didn't have any shortening I substituted butter (salted) and the biscuits were so good I made the "official " Thanksgiving batch with butter also. Very easy to make and being able to do ahead of time is a real plus. I made the dough 2 days early and formed the biscuits a number of hours before they needed to be baked and they turned out great.

I made them for the first time for Thanksgiv. and even with a moist turkey that was great the hit of the day was the Angel Buscuits. Our family is planning Christmas and they said "Mom just bring the biscuits."

To the cook asking about heating the buttermilk: You do not need to heat the milk. The yeast will have already been proofed. I have been making these biscuits since I was a little girl. They are so easy and fun that the job is often doled out to kids during holidays.

I haven't made these, but plan to. Question: does the buttermilk need to be warmed?

As a transplanted Californian, I had resigned myself to my Suth'n husband's opinion that "real" biscuits were beyond my abilities. He sucked these down at dinner and wrapped up the rest for later consumption. They were easy to make, too. You can hardly ask for more than that from a recipe.

I did this recipe exact and found delicious but a bit heavy. The next batch I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and it is great. I tried freezing the dough for later and it was ok for one week but then turned dark and did not rize when baked.

I really enjoyed these biscuits. Since I am from a northern state and our wheat is harder than the wheat flour in the south, I chose to make these biscuits with pastry flour. The fact that I could make the dough several days ahead of time and bake them as needed was a great joy. They turned out beautifully.
