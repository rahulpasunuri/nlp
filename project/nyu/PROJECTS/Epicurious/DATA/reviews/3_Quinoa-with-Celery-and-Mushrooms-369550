Loved this recipe and so did my husband! I added onions to the mushrooms to give it a bit more kick, but made the rest as directed. Dicing and lightly sauteeing the mushrooms gave them a meaty sort of texture so it was perfect for a vegetarian main dish. Made a side salad to go with it and it was great.

A bit bland. I added onions which I sauteed with the mushrooms, then pepper and basil when I mixed it all together.

When do you put in the mushrooms?
