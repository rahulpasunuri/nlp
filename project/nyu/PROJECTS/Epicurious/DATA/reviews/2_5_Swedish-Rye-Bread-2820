I actually have not tried this recipe, but as one with a Swedish heritage, I can tell by the ingredients that this recipe is bland. Not enough rye flour or spices. I bake wonderful limpa - the real thing. I use a a heaping tablespoon and a half each of dried anise, dried fennel, and caraway seeds. Coriander is a nice addition. I use the grated peel of two large oranges and 1/3 cup orange marmalade along with molasses. My flour ratio is about 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour to 3 cups dark rye flour. Also, I add about two tablespooons of vital wheat gluten to help with the rise (rye has almost no gluten).

My father loves Swedish rye and I'm still seeking the perfect recipe. I'm also familiar with the strong Swedish limpa, not the flavor/texture I was seeking. I substituted better-for-bread flour and used dried orange peel but the anise/orange was too subtle for our taste, the color too pale. And only 16 hours later, the bread tastes dry. I may modify another favorite recipe with anise and orange peel -- but if you're using this recipe would recommend substituting molasses for corn syrup and doubling the coriander, anise and orange peel.

I was afraid that it might be vortlimpa, which is too spicy for my taste, because of the spices. I was pleasantly surprised. It is not quite the same as the Swedish limpa that I grew up with in Brooklyn, but excellent in its own right.

I had lost my recipe and was so glad that I could retrieve it through your database. It is a delicious bread and very easy to make, freezes well. Thanks for having such an easy retrieval method.
