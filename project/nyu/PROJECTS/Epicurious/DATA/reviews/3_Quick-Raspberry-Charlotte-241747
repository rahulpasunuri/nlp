This is a quick and easy dessert that won't fail to delight. The raspberries and lemon work so well in the cream. It's colorful and makes for a nice presentation. Anything with Ladyfingers is always a pleasure...make this whenever you buy them!

OK. So I left the Charlotte in the REFRIGERATOR overnight, added some cognac to the strained and reduced raspberry sauce, and now the dessert rocks.

The desert came out OK, perhaps mostly my fault... to begin with, the fingers were still a little crunchy which didn't taste right. Next time, I would allow them to sit in the ice cream mixture longer or find some other way to moisten them further. Also, straining the seeds from the frozen raspberry puree was difficult so I had to warm up the sauce, then pass it through a sieve. I also ended up adding more lemon juice and sugar than stated, and I also reduced the sauce to give it more punch. Lastly, I ended up leaving the whole dish in the freezer for 50 minutes instead of the recommended 30 and ended up with an icy cream trainwreck.

when working with sweet (sugary) food using a pinch of salt will balance any dish better. this recipe really benefitted by it.

This was fantastic. I even did a low-fat lazy version using low fat vanilla frozen yogurt and low fat cool whip. I just folded pureed, defrosted frozen raspberries (that WERE in light syrup just because it's what happened to be on hand) into the cool whip and omitted the extra sugar and water, used double the brandy in the melted yogurt, and assembled as directed otherwise. My guests wanted to lick their bowls and there was not a drop left. Definitely heaven on earth.

Okay, it's from Gourmet! Sorry about that!

This was the worst recipe that I have tried making from Bon Appetit. ( I think all their recipes are on a decline anyway.) But this was really terrible - the raspberry cream turned out not sweet enough and was very icy - the recipe doesn't call for straining the seeds - so if you like seeds this would be great! Would never make it again!

It's me again...it's actually getting better each day it sits in the fridge. The sweet ice cream flavor is mellowing out on day 3. Maybe mix 1/2 ice cream and 1/2 raspberry sauce. And make it a day or two before serving. I'm upping rating to a 3 fork.

I made this last night and it would have been very good except for the melted vanilla ice cream. I used Haagen Daaz (that's as premium as I can find in my local store). It was much too sweet, not mellow enough. Not sure what could be used instead. Anyone have any ideas? I also soaked the ladyfingers for almost an hour and then froze the dish to serve later. And I strained the raspberry sauce to get all the little seeds out.
