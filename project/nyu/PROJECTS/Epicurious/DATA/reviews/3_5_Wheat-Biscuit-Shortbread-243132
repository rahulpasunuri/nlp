Simple, simple, simple. I flipped the amounts of flour to trick myself into thinking they're healthier that way and I spread milk chocolate along the bottom to add some of that bone-healthy dairy we all need. So eat up, with no guilt! Right?

Crunchy, thin & golden. I drizzled 3 oz of Vanilla flavored Mexican chocolate (2 round disks)that I blended a little milk into in order to thin it out. Rolled out dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to avoid the stickies. I've made these with chopped sliced almonds too...VERY GOOD!!

I took a tip from another shortbread recipe that instructed just patting the dough into the pan. This saves so much time, there's no re-rolling scraps- no tough cookies! It's less fussy, and saves dirtying more equipment than necessary. After patting the dough on to a parchment lined cookie sheet, score the whole lot into the appropriate number of squares without tearing the parchment. Score the whole sheet of shortbread with the tines of a fork as in the original. After you remove the pan from the oven, re-score the original cuts before removing the cookies to cool. This WW version is pretty tasty but I still like the buttery-ness using all white flour better. If you're trying to make a treat with whole grain it's fine, I'd make these again.

Well, whatever you do, don't skip the refrigeration step. I did, and the whole thing spread out about 2 inches in all directions. I think that was the problem, anyway-- I also used all whole wheat pastry flour-- maybe that was it? I blame myself. It was salvageable once i cut the burnt edges off, with very good flavor. I'd make it again, following the directions more closely. ;)

These are fantastic! I've made these twice. The only changes I made was to cut the amount of sugar. I melted semi sweet chocolate and kahlua and spread it over the cookies . The chocolate hardens if you add the liqueur for some reason so it was troublesome. It certainly was delicious!

best shortbread ever!!! the only change i made was i used brown sugar instead of white sugar and all whole wheat flour instead of just one cup. they came out just perfect after 18 minutes at 325! it was soooo super easy and the ingredients were already all there!!

These are fantastic--I can't believe no one has reviewed them yet. I have been trying to figure out how to make a whole-wheat shortbread for ages. These are delicious, and so easy to make. And they're "healthy"! (Well, not really--but it's an excuse to eat a lot of them!)
