The fiorst time you make the soup, use milder Jerk seasoning. Also, if you have one, use a Key Lime - - yes, just one. It has a flavor that is SO different than a regular lime. Sauted onions are a great addition, and because it is blended they just add to the flavor.

I have this recipe from the original printing in the magazine and it was a little different....unless I missed it someplace...you should garnish it with some chopped red onion & a spoonful of sour cream. It's perfect that way! Making it for dinner tonight :-) Yum!

Really, really great... I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added chopped bacon, bacon fat, garlic, onion and pureed half the beans. The soup was very, very spicy. To tame the heat, we ate the soup with water and bread. :- ) . I will try to find mild jerk seasoning next time I make it. Very tasty. Easy to make and highly recommend!

Great again and again. The quickest soup in the bag.

I agree about adding some sauteed chopped onion and some garlic before the jerk seasoning. I used "mild" jerk seasoning, and was not overwhelmed by spiciness at all. Makes a great meal when paired with arepas and cheese.

This was good but not great. I would add slightly less lime juice next time.

This was extremely quick, easy and tasty. I made it exactly as written except that I only pureed half of the beans. Will be making it again and again.

The quickest soup ever! Really yummy and filling. My mate asked for the recipe! I'm making it again this week for a very speedy dinner for 2. Goes well with a lemony raw grated carrot & beetroot salad.

We added an onion and garlic clove and used the jerk spice recipe kindly posted by the cook from San Francisco below. The flavor was great and we both enjoyed the soup, but unless you like fiery food try half the amount of cayenne pepper suggested. It was a bit hot for both of us and we were both choking and coughing after toasting the jerk spice (probably from the amount of cayenne and my overly vigorous stirring).

This is sooooooooooo good. Love that its stuff that is always in my pantry. Had made BLTs the day before with the great tomatoes that out now and had saved the bacon drippings. Sauteed a small onion with the bacon drippings and then made the soup as written. Was nothing short of terrific. Squeeze of lime and dollop of sour cream, and your home.

The last time I made this soup I added several slices of pickled jalapenos to the food processor. It added a lot of interest and kick. And I always add a generous dollop of sour cream to each bowl.

This is a staple in our kitchen, especially during Lent; when paired with a grilled cheese sandwich, it makes a nice dinner. I generally double or triple the recipe and freeze the leftovers for lunches, because it reheats really well. Only change I make to the recipe is to use a hand/immersion blender rather than transfer everything to a food processor (one less thing to wash). This is quick, tasty, and incredibly easy.

Even though I live in a San Francisco neighborhood where you can get most anything, I could not find jerk seasoning. I did a little research and came up with this recipe for the spice mix: 1 tablespoons onion powder, 2 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, 2 teaspoons ground allspice, 2 teaspoons ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt. My only caution is when toasting this mix, keep an eye on it because it began to smoke and burn very quickly. When making the soup, I was short one can of black beans (I didn't notice that this recipe is for 2 servings only!) so I pureed a can of white beans which worked just fine. All in all, the substitutions worked out well and my guests all liked the soup.

This was very good but not overly exciting. I added garlic which helped the flavor a lot and I didn't puree the beans because I prefer texture.

During a trip to the caribbean this spring, my husband and I fell in love with the local cusine. So I was thrilled to find this recipe. This dish truly delivers. My only alteration: I only puree half of the beans in favor of additional texture. A common sense tip which I failed to think of prior to making this the first time- go easy on the spice until you figure out the level of heat. When in Puerto Rica we purchased some caribbean jerk seasoning, so this recipe was my first chance to enjoy it. I followed the recipe and landed up in tears over the amount of heat. (even though I love heat) Certainly not the brightest thing I have done to date but hey, we're all human. Tonight I used 1 1/2 teaspoons instead and it was perfection. (I served it over brown rice to add another texture) It will be a regular at our table.

Love this soup! Couldn't believe it could be so good and so easy, but it's true! Try it! 3 1/2 forks for taste and simplicity. Served with a dollop of sour cream and oven-baked corn tortilla strips for garnish and crunch. Toasting the spices did make me cough a bit.

Very easy and very tasty. I made up a batch of caribbean jerk seasoning which I got from another recipe. Caribbean Jerk Seasoning 3/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste. Also much easier to use an immersion blender in the actual pot before you heat it up.

We too used Jamaican jerk seasoning as that's all we had on hand, but we did not encounter the odor or allergic problems that the previous reviewer did. In fact, the soup turned out quite well if just a touch too spicy for my taste. I don't know if there's a difference between Caribbean jerk seasoning and Jamaican, but if it's just a degree of heat, I'd still use the Jamaican again, just a little bit less of it.

My grocery store didn't have Caribbean jerk seasoning blend but they did have Jamaican Jerk seasoning and I figured this was just fine. WOW, I hope there is a huge difference between the two! When we toasted the Jamican Jerk sesoning, it gave off an odor about on par with pepper spray. It gave my husband a full blown asthma attack and I could barely breathe. We had to hide our two little kids up in our office for hours until we could get the smell out of the house. After all of that, the soup was barely so-so. Needless to say, I will NOT be trying this recipe again!

A simple soup that can be made with pantry staples. This is the kind of thing that is perfect for a mid-week meal.

I'm amazed that something with so few ingredients and that is so easy is so GOOD. Really delicious, really fast, and it's even healthy. This is going into heavy rotation at my house.

This recipe gets major bonus points for being so absolutely effortless! I've only tried it with plain black beans and it's lovely that way, and I actually like it both with and without the lime juice. It's also good both with and without the olive oil for anyone cutting back on fat. This is such a great recipe for those times when you're really starving and can't wait for supper. Even a pokey-slow cook like me can get it on the table in 10 minutes, and it's nice and hearty! But it's tasty enough to want even when you're not pressed for time. All in all, highly recommended.

We even prepared the ice cream Puerto Rican style. The soup is wonderful!

This soup rocks! It is easy, virtually fool-proof, and very delicious. I've had it with an without the chopped red onions and lime wedges- i consider both to be essential for really "topping" it off. I've also used jerk sauce when I couldn't find seasonings, and have used instead a combo of cumin, chinese five spice, garlic and others spices to make up for lack of jerk seasonings.

I was really amazed that this soup was so good considering how quick it is to make and how few ingredients it requires. Because it's pureed it felt to me to be more of a first course than a main course.

This soup is amazing. It is super easy to make and very forgiving. I experiment with the spices putting in whatever sounds good and have added cilantro which turned out well.

Very unique and tasty soup. I really liked how quick and easy this is to prepare. Definitely just enough for two people so I would recommend doubling the recipe. For two of the three tablespoons of olive oil, I used garlic olive oil. That gave it a bit of extra flavor. You can add some more Jerk seasoning to give it a bit more of a "kick".

hey...Mr. Texas...WHO ARE YOU???what is the difference whether or not a recipe is "authentic" so long as it is tasty. What we need is more tasty recipes and less tasteless critics! Recipe..excellent Preparation...easy this is a keeper!

I love it, being a Newyor-rican (New York Puerto Rican) I grew up with Black Beans. My father grew up in Puerto Rico with Black Beans and since retired to Puerto Rico and continues with the black beans. Mr. Texas, don't know how many Puerto Ricans you know, but WE LOVE BLACK BEANS and it doesn't matter where they came from and how we found out about them. THEY'RE GREAT!!!!

Very, very good recipe. Contrary to the self-styled "expert" from Texas, we've been eating black beans in PR forever. This is a typical recipe that reminds me of my childhood.

I have not yet tried this recipe but will, however, to the person who thought it was ridiculous that Puerto Ricans don't eat black bean soup, I want to say that I have vacationed in Puerto Rico many times and the best black bean soup I have ever had was there!!! They usually served it with chopped raw onion on top and sometimes a little bit of scrambled egg as well.

Funniest recipe I've seen so far in Epicurious.com. Puerto Rican-style black bean soup? Give me a break. Puertoricans don't eat black beans. First time they saw black beans was back in 1959 when cubans started to emigrate there after Castro's take over; before that, they didn't know -except for New York's puertoricans- that black beans ever excisted. And black beans cooked with yogurt, chopped red onions, vegetable broth, lime juice.....???? Like I said, very funny. Not tasty, but funny. The recipe also calls for sweet potato chips to be served with the soup.... in Puerto Rico? That's another thing they don't know of. Cubans love sweet potatoes but not with black beans, thou. By the way, Goya, a puertorican company cans black beans, not for puertoricans but for cubans in Puerto Rico, Miami, New York, etc....and venezuelans who also like genuine black bean soup.

This soup is tasty and incredibly simple to make. Watch the jerk seasoning as it can get very spicy very quickly.
