I have made this dish several times for a mixed crowd (people who love and people who hate brussel sprouts) . It gets two thumbs up from everyone. I make two changes - I carmelize the shallots until they are buttery (takes at least 30 minutes on low heat) and I omit the pine nuts ( I just don't think they are needed). I made it at Thanksgiving and my husband's family who are picky loved them.

I've made this recipe several times for my husband and I and we like it as it is. I think it really doesn't need bacon. I have used it as a base for grilled scallops (w/spicy seasoning and olive oil) and along side of grilled rock fish with marjoram butter (See "Red Snapper With Lemon Marjoram Butter"). Really nice combinations. I use my Cuisinart to slice the sprouts very thin (the thinnest setting). The sweetness of the shallots and the lemon juice balance out the bitterness of the sprouts. Note that it's important to remove the dark out leaves of the sprouts. Dark leave produce the really bitter taste that some people have complained about.

I found this to be bitter and would suggest the addition of bacon or a bit of balsamic vinegar. Would not make this again.

Great way to prepare brussels sprouts. I added 4 thick slices of bacon, cut into thin strips and sauteed crisp, then drained. Wipe out the pan with paper towels and begin the recipe, adding bacon back in at end so it stays crisp. I also toss lemon zest on the finished recipe for added lemon flavor. Even people who claim to hate brussel sprouts liked this!

I have made this recipe many times over the last few years, and all have loved it and asked for the recipe. I do not use butter, I crisp up finely chopped pancetta in a fry pan first, then remove it from the frypan and crumble it, set it aside,then pour off most of the grease from the pan before I saute the shallots in the pancetta oil,then follow the recipe to the end. At the very end I add the crumbed pancetta just before serving

This dish was yummy!I used leeks instead of the shallots. I also eliminated the butter. It is so crunchy. I made again 3 days later. This dish is a keeper.

Did not remember to get enough shallots to double the recipe, so I used 2 giant leeks as well. I also added extra garlic (about 50% more) and added some sweet and some smoked paprika to taste, plus extra lemon juice as others suggested. Personally, I thought the pine nuts gave it an earthy, pleasant flavor....brought it to a party and it was a big hit!

Ok well I LOVED them. I did not include the lemon juice and I still thought they were tasty. the pine nuts add a nice touch.

My technique for slicing brussels sprouts: cut off the tough bottom stalk and remove loose and tough outer leaves. Stand on flat bottom and slice off the outside edges until you are left with the core. Now slice off the upper one-third of the remaining core and discard the rest. You are left with the most tender parts of the sprout, and everything cooks uniformly since it is the same density. This is no different than what you would do with a cabbage.

Just goes to show how tastes can be so different... I thought this was terrible! Even the pine nuts were completely lost in this!

This was delicious! If yours was too bland, it is because you didn't cook it right. A delightful side dish. I could eat a bowl of it alone. But the entire menu was mouth watering. It goes so well with the braised ribs and polenta.

A little bland. We were expecting more flavor.

This is really good. I cooked the sprouts only 5 minutes or so and then topped them with parmesan and put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Delicious with the savory mint lamb chops.

I have not made this dish yet, but was foraging around the site to replicate a wonderful shaved brussel sprout dish we had recently at a fine restaurant. I think this dish is pretty close except no pine nuts and could not taste lemon. But this is what took it from good to great; the chef finished the dish in the broiler with parmasan. It was not a heavy "cheesy" layer, but rather it added a toasty, slightly salty crust to the actually sweet sprouts. I am going to have to experiment a little to get it quite right, but as I live with a sprout lover, it should be worth it!

This is an excellent and easy side dish. Even my kids will eat these brussel sprouts!

Here's what I liked: shaved brussel sprouts. I liked the texture. Here's what I didn't like: the taste. Too boring! Too bland! I felt sure all those shallots would be delicious, but this was one boring dish. Needed way more flavor and some better texture. The pine nuts didn't do much, nor did the lemon.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first to go! Even the non-brussel sprout eaters loved it!

Slicing the sprouts (I did it by hand) made them a bit too indistinct; very much like a cooked fine cole slaw

my busband and I have made it two times already and we are adding it to our Thanksgiving menu.

I'm not sure how you could burn these unless you had the heat up too high or didn't use enough butter/oil. Different pans transfer heat differently so if your food is burning, turn the heat down! Anyway, these are fantastic. As others have said, simple to make and will be a big hit at a dinner party. Surprise your friends who still think brussel sprouts are the nasty things of childhood.

I have made this twice for dinner parties and both time received rave reviews. My picky teen-agers even loved it. Great with Beef Tenderloin.

Nice and simple, with great flavors. I've had issues with brussels being bitter, but no worries here. I also hand cut the veggies.

Easy and tasty! A lovely seasonal side dish with great color and textures. Instead of just pine nuts, I used a pine nut/pumpkin seed/almond mix from Trader Joe's. Delish!

I followed the directions exactly and the brussels sprouts started to burn quite a bit before the 8 minute mark. Maybe my food processor sliced them too fine. I will try slicing them by hand next time.

Excellent: with recipe followed exactly. Wouldn't change a thing. Even "brussel sprout doubters" will love this recipe! Plan on serving again at Thanksgiving

This was tasty. However, I don't think the mess of dragging out my food processor. I'll just do a fine chop next time. Plus I'd add a bit more lemon juice for my taste.

I am known to "hate" brussel sprouts but my husband requested this recipe. To my surprise, it was delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly.

I was lazy to get out the food processor, so I cut the sprouts by hand. I thought this dish had great flavors, I would make this again!!!

Rating: 3
I thought this was great but the food processor was turning them into slaw so I put half through the processor and hand sliced the remaining. My experience with Brussels sprouts is that if you just sauté them theyre tuff , so I steamed them through for about 5 minutes until they were tender, followed the rest of the recipe and they turned out great. As an added touch try sprinkling with parmesan cheese.

Very easy recipe with a delicious taste and texture. Family loved it!
