We really really liked these. My teen daughter pronounced them "strangely delicious". I also baked them on a rack. You need to make the filling and re-stuff the potatoes as soon as they are cool enough, then later (or the next day)you can put the coating on and bake them again. I dipped the bottoms first and placed them on the foil lined baking sheet on a rack, then at the end smoothed the yogurt mixture over the top and sprinkled with sesame seeds. I had plenty of sesame seeds on hand and was quite liberal with them. I used shredded cheddar jack cheese from Costco and that worked well. I am thinking of taking small potatoes and making them little two bite finger foods for my next party. I serve them with just about anything; steak, salmon, chicken. I like a simple sauteed spinach to round out the plate.

This recipe was pretty good overall. Nice indian-style variation on the standard sourcream-cheese-onion twice-baked potato. I made a number of variations -- made it with sweet potatoes, used pepper jack cheese, just used spicy chili oil in the yogurt, went heavier on the green onions and spices, threw in some chopped spinach with the cilantro, AND baked in in the oven as per other users. I made lots of the extra yogurt sauce to serve cold on the side as a dipping sauce -- which I think is an essential addition.

I as well, baked in the oven. We loved the potatoes but I put the sauce on the side as it seemed a little bitter to me. Great spice with the serrano pepper.

We really liked these. Agree that the foil pan in the grill wasn't really necessary--they didn't bubble over or anything, the foil was fine. A great vegetarian option, if you're having a barbecue and don't want to just roll out veggie burgers.

I find many incredible recipes on epicurious. That being said - Stop now and do not make this - it is a disaster.

Loved these! I switched up the cheese to something with a little more flavor (goat or sheep, not super strong) which went over well. I also didn't see the point in grill instructions, instead just used a rack over a rimmed sheet in the oven. I absolutely recommend not skipping the bottom coating - it really adds a great look and extra crunch.

I also just roasted these in the oven instead of using the seemingly complicated grill instructions - 450 degrees for about 20 minutes. I also reduced the potatoes to 2 instead of 3 but left the rest of the ingredients the same, and I thought the ratio of potato to other stuff in the filling was good. I didn't dip the bottom in the paste and seeds, but served the leftover paste on the side as a dipping sauce. I don't know that I would make the potato part again, but the paste was excellent!

These potatoes were really delicious. They were kind of a lot of work in the beginning, but I made them ahead of time and they were ready to go for dinner. I also didn't use the grill, instead I baked them for 30 minutes at 350 on a regular baking sheet (obviously without the drip pan). Served with the yogurt marinated chicken kebabs, corn, and riesling.... I might not serve it again with the kebabs, because it was a lot of spice, but definitely with the riesling!

These were delicious (LOVE SESAME SEEDS). The instructions got a little involved setting up the grill so I ended up baking them in the oven while I grilled the steaks. Interesting flavour and they look great on the plate
