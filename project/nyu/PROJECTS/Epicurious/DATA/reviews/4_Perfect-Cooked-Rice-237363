Gummy disaster. Just follow the recipe on your bag of jasmine rice. Keys are soaking and boiling without covering, but this recipe did not work.

Never thought about how I was making rice until I came across this recipe. It really is the way to make perfect rice.

Usually I don't look at recipes for simple things like rice, and I came across this recipe and it has changed how i cook my rice. This is truly the only way rice should be cooked!

I never comment on things but I had to for this. I've always used way too much water for rice and it always comes out gummy- this is the best rice recipe. I actually used 1 cup water and and 3/4 can of coconut milk for the soaking and cooking step. The rice was phenomenal, and the coconut milk added a tiny bit of sweetness. Really good.

This recipe does make PERFECT rice. I've tried many techniques but this one is fool proof.
