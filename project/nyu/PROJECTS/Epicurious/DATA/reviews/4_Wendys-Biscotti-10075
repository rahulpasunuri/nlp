This recipe is excellent as written. This year I decided to make them for Christmas so I used dried cranberries instead of currents. The red cranberries, white chocolate chips, and slight green tinge of some of the pistachios gave them a nice flavor. I sliced them 1/2". If you use a finely serrated knife (I have a ceramic serrated tomato knife) they slide easily without crumbling. Even my husband, who is not a fan of biscotti, liked this.

Delicious - definitely a winner. Next time I would decrease the pistachios - 3/4c recommended by Sheila from Dayton is probably right. I would also slice them thinner - 1/2". Still, that does not take away from the great flavor and texture.

Fabulous. The only things I changed were to substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 of the cups of white flour and I subbed dried cranberries for the currants. This is a terrific biscotti.

I, too, have been making this recipe for 9 years and have a large fan club. I've changed it to 3/4 cup butter which makes for a crisper biscotti, dried cherries which give more body than currants, 3/4 cup pistachio which seems plenty, and totally eliminate the white chocolate but rather dip the dried biscotti in melted semi-sweet chocolate. Perfect!

I have been making this recipe for the last nine years and it is one of my favorite biscotti recipes. Make sure to add 1T of grated orange peel and I use dried cranberries instead of currants. When I can't find unsalted pistachios I rinse them in a colander, pat them dry with a papertowel and add them to my dough. They crisp up in the final baking.

Sorry to dissent... This was a BLAH recipe - absolutely nothing special... I am an experienced cook, who loves to bake -don't bother with this one...

Simply delicious biscotti. I have made a number of biscotti recipes and while I enjoy a super-crispy cookie to dip in coffee--these tender, but firm cookies are definitely a crowd favorite. I have done a number of filling combinations with this recipe. I works with chocolate chips, walnuts, dried cherries, golden raisins, anything your heart desires. Good enough for a gift.

I used almonds and Craisins (dried cranberries) instead of currants. Make sure you have a good knife or the cookies will crack in the wrong places.

i found this recipe to be very user-friendly. the biscotti are easy and fun to make and look very pretty when finished. i leave the white chocolate out and instead dip them in dark chocolate...so delicious!

I will make these again! I increased the orange zest to 3 tablespoons (I used dried, it was much simpler), and substituted dried cranberries and almonds. I had no trouble slicing them, they were crisp yet tender. A keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and the results were delicious. However, possibly because of the large amount of butter (one stick per 2 cups flour), they were extremely fragile. They crumbled so badly I had a great deal of trouble slicing them. Even after the 2nd baking I didn't want to risk packing them for shipping as I do my other biscotti recipies. Cutting back the butter to 2-3 tablespoons would probably fix the problems I had. I was also surprised to see baking powder called for rather than baking soda, but I'm not certain what difference using soda would make.

Wonderful basic biscotti recipe! The dough had a perfect texture to work with. I substituted the chocolate, currants and nuts with 1 cup of chopped toasted pecans and 1 cup shredded coconut - delicious.

Wonderful! I used this recipe (more or less) in place of my "tried and true" biscotti recipe (now lost). This is every bit as good as my old one....and I've tried MANY biscotti recipes. I omitted the zest and currants. Instead, I added 3 Tbls Creme de Cacao and a few handfuls of chocolate chips. My oven runs a bit hot, so I didn't cook them as long as suggested, but everything came out great. This is a keeper!!! Great texture and crunch-ability. Nice.

This is by far the best basic biscotti recipe I've made - and I make a lot of biscotti! I've used different nuts and added dried cherries or white chocolate chips, dipped in chocolate or not. Very versitle.

this was easy--and so delicious! it was my first time making these and they were a big hit at the party it took them too. i subbed dried cranberries & almonds, & loved the flavor combination. i also reduced the butter and increased the amount of orange zest as recommended. perfect. these would be great as a snack/with tea!

Kudos to Wendy -- these are the best biscotti I've tasted! As everyone else, I adjusted the recipe a little, substituted dried cranberries for the currants and almonds/hazelnuts for the pistachios (seems to work better if you coarsly chop them). I eliminated the chocolate and upped the orange zest to 3 T. I found it easier to make 3 smaller logs (fit better on my cookie sheet). If you are short on time, you can bake the logs in advance and slice and rebake the next day (it's much easier to slice them when the logs are cooled). I've tried a bunch of variations, my fave so far is apricot almond. Definitely try this recipe!

Everyone thought these were delicious, and I loved how easy they were to make. I especially liked the idea of chilling the dough -- it made shaping the loaves a snap. The versatility of the recipe is great, too. I've used various nuts and dried fruits, and left out the chocolate chunks - dipping half in dark chocolate instead - all to rave reviews. Thanks Wendy!

I used dried cranberries instead, and dipped baked cookies with melted chocolate (some with dark, others with white chocolate) rather than mixing in with the dough. Stickiness was not much of a problem; I just used my rubber spatula to form logs directly on waxed paper...no need to knead at all.

This recipie was a huge hit with both friends and famil. I added a little bit of extra white chocolate for added sweetness. Be careful though, on the second baking, it is not always easy to determine exactly when these are done.

i am the wendy of this recipe. since the inception of this, i have made adjustments beyond what the kitchen at gourmet had done for publication. First,to keep the dough from being too sticky, add flour one tablespoon at a time so that the dough can be handled more easily. it does depend upon the water in the eggs, air and flour itself sometimes. professional bakers weigh the flour to get a consistent amount for repeated results. secondly, i use Boyajian orange or tangerine oils for the citrus element. it is a pure and clear flavor that can be adjusted for personal result. it is strong and consistent in its flavor capacity. thirdly, i like to dry the cookies in a very low oven temperature or with the off overnight on their bottoms rather than their sides for all cookie variations using either any kind of chocolate or dried fruits. it prevents any scorching or weeping or unidentified acrid flavors being added to the cookie itself. finally, i adjust the amount of nuts or fuit constantly depending upon what i have in house or what flavor is desired. it is a personal choice always and it always seems to work out well.

All of my guests enjoyed these cookies (or so they said) but they were blah to me. I couldn't taste the pistachios, but the dried cranberries complimented the chocolate dipped cookie well. I prefer the anise flavored biscotti cookies with almonds. They are more traditional and the flavor of the anise is distinct and yummy.

I made this according to specs the first time and it was good. However, I've tweaked it several times since and here's what I've found to work best: less butter (3/4 cup, like others said), less pistachios (3/4 cup), 3 tablespoons orange zest (really, instead of vaguely, orange flavor), skip the white chocolate and dip in melted dark chocolate. Also, I prefer dried cherries to the currants, but they both work well, as do cranberries. Regardless, this is a good adaptable recipe that has won rave reviews each way I've made it.

I like my biscotti crunchier and better for dipping in coffee or vino santa. These had a consistency more like shortbread, probably as a result of the butter. The melted white chocolate was not attractive, had an almost orangey look (I used Lindt). If I make these again I'll melt the chocolate separately and dip the biscotti in afterwards.

Easy and delicious! Used dried cherries and unssalted macadamia nuts and followed the suggestion of cutting cookies 1/2 inches and dipping ends in melted chocolate. Sinful! Will absolutely make again!

Absolutely delicious. I made this, along with various cookies, as a Christmas gift to family members and they all enjoyed it. I did not add the currants and only used 3/4 cup of pistachios and it was still wonderful.

This is such an excellent biscotti recipe. I used only big chunks of walnuts and dipped some of the biscotti ends in semi-sweet chocolate. My guests loved them! I found that I had to toast them alot longer than the recipe says. I also flipped them over so that they would be golden brown on both sides. It will be fun to make all kinds of substitutions with this recipe...dried apricot & almond, cherry-walnut...etc....

I have to tell you, I have been making this recipe ever since it appeared in Gourmet. They are absolutely fantastic!! I make tons of them during Christmas, and they are always a hit, and keep well in a cool dry container for a long time. I didn't alter the recipe, however I make the dough a day ahead. And be sure to let the loaves cool a lot longer for easier cutting. Enjoy!!
