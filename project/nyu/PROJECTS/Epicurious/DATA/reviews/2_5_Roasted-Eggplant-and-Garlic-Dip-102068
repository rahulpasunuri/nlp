I cooked eggplant for an hour and added mayo as suggested - it was still an unappetizing color. I also added a little chili oil for heat. I thought it tasted ok, not as good as Trader Joe's Eggplant Garlic Spread - nicer texture though

Just okay - even with lots of S & P it was pretty bland. Also, I only got about a cup of dip out of the recipe. This is a lot of work for such a little amount back.

Delicious - left the eggplant in for an hour on 475 as suggested and added sea salt, a dollop of mayo, and fresh pepper when blending but otherwise followed the recipe.

This turned out to be very yummy and I've made it several times with great success. Having said that, I want to address some issues that people seem to have with the dish. 1) Cooking time varies depending on your oven, but overall I think it needs to be cooked between 45 to 60 minutes at the suggested temperature. 2)Seasoning is also VERY important especially when your dish uses such a mild vegetable like eggplant. I used about 2 tsp.'s of finely ground sea salt (little by little tasting after each addition of salt.) 3) Finally, for a more appealing color - add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of mayonnaise. It will become a pale brown shade instead of the murky gray of just plain eggplant. Hope these comments help. Enjoy!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. I never really liked eggplant before, but this is great! Just make sure you roast the eggplant till it is really falling apart. It's true the color is a little uninspiring, but the taste is amazing!

I think this recipe is wrong! Oven temperature and roasting time is way off. Roast the eggplant at 475 degrees for 1 hour until the skin is blackenend and soft, turning occasionally. Cut the eggplant in half, spoon out the flesh into a strainer and drain for 15 minutes. Then follow the rest of the recipe. Yummmm.

The flavor was kind of odd. And it looked like baby gruel. I will make the pita toasts again, though, but I'll dip them into something yummier.

The presentation of the dip is awful-not an appealing color. There was little flavor. I threw it away, unserved.

This is the yummiest dip. If you make the pita toasts with some garlic and olive oil on them it is even better.
