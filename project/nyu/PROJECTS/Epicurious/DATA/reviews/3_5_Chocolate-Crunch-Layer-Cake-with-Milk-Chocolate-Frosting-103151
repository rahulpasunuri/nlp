I followed this recipe exactly and while the frosting was yummy, the cake left something to be desired--dry and crumbly. I have many more chocolate cake recipes that are better so probably will not make this one again.

This made an excellent birthday cake. The only tweak I did to the recipe was swapping the vanilla extract for mint- voila, a mint chocolate crunch cake! The frosting came out beautifully, I threw in a lb of high quality chocolate chips instead of chopping up bars of chocolate and stuck it in the fridge a few times to get it to thicken. One of the guests called the cake "better than sex".

I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and it did not need the pudding cup. It was moist enough.

I had problems with the frosting - getting it to thicken. I beat it forever and it was still too thin and I could not get it peak. I ended up putting in the refridgerator to cool and even then it never got to the thickness I was hoping for, but at least it was usable. Having said all that, it really was delicious.

The cake itself was on the dry side, which affected the flavor. Frosting was delicious. Good concept with flavor and texture combinations, but would replace cake w/ dif. choc. cake recipe.

I love this recipe. I make a lot of birthday cakes, and this recipe is going to be my go-to recipe from now on whenever I need a chocolate layer cake. It was moist, flavorful, and easy to make.

I have made this cake four times and each time it has been awesome. I used very high quality Milk Chocolate with Hazelnuts for the frosting--strongly recommend. Now I am going to modify the frosting recipe and substitute a white chocolate toblerone bar (just got back from Switzerland) and use with a lemon curd filling and white chocolate cake.

If you bake this in a diferent size pan, you will have to allow for different baking time. Also, if you use pyrex instead of metal, you will have to adjust the oven temperature as well. If you do bake it in a 9x13" pan, then cut into two, to layer, you will have difficulty icing the cake...the crumgs on the cut side of the cake will come loose, and interfere with the icing.

Mmm!!! I made this cake for my daughter's birthday party and everyone raved about it! I took someone else's suggestion and added a chocolate pudding cup to the batter and the cake was super moist. I had trouble getting the Hershey's choclate bar to curl (it just crumbled with the peeler), so I chopped up a couple extra Heath toffee bars and sprinkled them on top. It looked and tasted wonderful! I also made cupcakes, however realized afterwards that this recipe makes flat cakes/cupcakes. They still tasted great, but were missing the fluffy tops. I guess I need to add baking powder next time if making cupcakes?!?

I have two tricks that make this the perfect chocolate cake. One--use one to two chocolate snack pudding cups for a truly moist cake. Put the pudding in at the same time you add the milk. Two... for the frosting... you don't really need the bowl of ice. Just use the mixer as directed. Then put it in the freezer for 15 minutes. Take it out. Use the mixer again. Keep doing it every 15 minutes until the frosting becomes stiff enough to spread. Every other instruction in this recipe is flawless.

This cake does take time to make but worth the effort. Here are some tips from someone who's made it several times. 1-Add pudding to the cake mix. I use Snack pudding cups. Use 1 1/2 cups. This makes the cake a no-brainer for being extremely moist. 2-The frosting. I use ghiradelli milk chocolate chips. Once you transfer the chocolate to the bowl you can skip the whole ice bowl underneath and don't bother using the whisk. Instead. Use your average pair of beaters... mix it on medium for about 4 minutes or so. Then put the bowl in your freezer for 15 minutes. Take it out again and beat it some more for maybe two minutes and then put it back in the freezer. Do this three times. Total time it takes to make the frosting the right thickness is about 45 minutes or so. 3-I use a large Hershey Bar for the chocolate curls with a peeler. Everyone loves this cake and requests me to make it often.

I made this for a family party to welcome our son to the world and there was not a crumb left over.. i doubled the recipie and made four layers. The only thing i added was about a quarter cup of mayonnaise which i always do to cakes and it really adds to the moistness. I did not use the frosting in the recipe but a simple chocolate buttercream and WOW what a cake...also sprinkled some toffee bits between the layers.

I bake all the time and had to try this recipe. It was good and worth making although I would tweak it a little. Using really great chocolate is the key. I would make extra frosting and split the layers - frosting between all and crunch between the two cakes and on top. My cake was very crumbly and didn't cut nice but that could have been my mistake. Any chocolate cake will work with this frosting. So easy and not very time consuming. I do agree with everyone that the frosting takes much longer then the few minutes mentioned in the recipe. Even over an ice bath I would say it was closer to 10 minutes.

This cake was surprisingly good (for milk chocolate which I don't very often use) and easy. It was perfect made in a lg metal rectangular pan. I had to beat frosting w/electric mixer longer than 2 minutes, but it turned out very creamy. I added the crushed toffee to the top of frosting and left off the choc shavings.

Ok, this was good, don't get me wrong, but DISAPPOINTING! What should have been, in my opinion, orgasmic, veered toward pedestrian. This is not, alas, for dark chocolate lovers like myself (although I still LOVE milk chocolate, don't get me wrong there). The frosting is good, and I might use it again, but would sub at least semisweet choc. Although this was rich, I found myself craving something with more depth. The cake also could have been more moist, if I made this again, I would cook it less, even though I think I took it out at the "right time." There are just better choc. cakes out there, and if you know one, I suggest you sub. it for the one here. They say it is a dark choc. cake, but it is not fudgy, and certainly more toward medium, even using good quality chocolate. Also, by all means, add more Toffee candy! It looks like you are putting so much on, but somehow you never get enough in one bite. Lastly, make MORE frosting, probably 1.5 times the recipe would be enough. Oh, and use dark choc. for the curls, I would say, the milk never gets firm enough in my opinion.

The cake was beautiful and delicious. The only draw back was the frosting for us, my daughter does not like whip cream consistancy for frosting. So I will do butter cream and still make the cake which was tender and moist.

Wow! This is for the frosting only. I actually put this on top of a pound cake. I don't know how anyone could rate this less than a four forker. I used 3 1/4 bars of the Hershey's Symphony bar. It came out wonderfully light and fluffy. I had to restrain myself from just eating the whole bowl. The key is to make sure the chocolate is completely cold before whipping. 8 minutes was way too short! It was closer to 45-60 minutes. This is an absolute keeper!!!

I made the frosting only. I made the ganache and then put it in my mixing bowl and put in the refrigerator for 3 hours. I also put in the whip attachment from the mixer in the refrigerator. After 3 hours I used my electric mixer and it whipped up in less then 2 minutes. I finished it with just a drizzle of ganache with just 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/3 cut dark chocolate. Let it cool and drizzle down the sides of your finished cake. The icing was sweet but not as sweet as regular butter cream icing. It was very chocolatey, but I liked that.

This is a really delicious cake, fairly easy to make and looks very impressive. The frosting is the best I've tasted, and is the reason why I keep making it!

The frosting is what really makes this cake. Be sure to let it is cool (a bit below room temp) before you whip it and you should have no problems with it being runny. The cake itself was good, but crumbly. Be sure to use parchment and let it cool completely. Put Heath pieces in between the layers and on top of the cake instead of chocolate shavings. Very good.

This is a great cake. I overbaked the cake part so they weren't as moist as they could have been so watch out for that. Even though I did what everyone suggested, the frosting never did thicken, so I put it in the freezer for a few minutes and it thickened up. The frosting was delicious though and the skor in the cake was heavenly! A definite keeper!

This is a phenominal cake recipe. I have made it several times and had rave reviews. I usually make the frosting with semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate and everyone still just loves it. It is a rich and chocolaty cake without being "stick to your teeth sweet." It's a very nice mix of chocolates. It is an easy recipe if you follow the instructions. And great to make the day before. Fortunately, I have the article from the Bon Appetite when it was first published and it shows pictures which are quite helpful. Here are some tips for anyone who has had trouble with the recipe. First, make sure all of the ingredients are at room temperature and do not overbeat the cake mix. Absolutely let the cake cook completely before frosting or the frosting will melt. As for the frosting, while you are whisking over the bowl of ice water it is imperative to do this until the frosting is completely cool otherwise you will end up with liquid frosting. As it cools it will lighten in color and become more stiff. Make sure you beat the frosting for 2 minutes at least. It will be a much lighter color and much stiffer but not hard. It should be easy to spread with no dripping. I have added fresh berries on top of the cake, as well as a light dusting of powdered sugar. There are several ways to decorate this and make it unique. Enjoy, it is a fabulous cake!

I have made a modified version of this cake again and again. Each time I get many compliments and requests for the recipe. The cake is moist and not too sweet. The frosting is sooo delicious! I use a "Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce" instead of the toffee bars. (The recipe is from epicurious) The end product reminds me of "torte" I enjoyed at cafes in Germany. I sift the dry ingredients for the cake. High quality chocolate such as Ghirardelli or Lindt is a must for the cake, sauce and frosting. Follow the directions exactly for the frosting; tranfer from saucepan to stainless bowl and use the larger bowl filled with ice & a little water to cool the frosting. Allow cakes to cool COMPLETELY. Cut each cake horizontally in half. Chocolate sauce should be easy to spread but not runny. (When it's completely cool it'll be like a fudgy ganache; heat up left overs and use as ice cream topping!)Spread first layer with choc. sauce, second with frosting, third with choc. sauce. Frost entire cake. Decorate. Chocolate lovers enjoy!!

I have been searching for another chocolate layer cake recipe(Just for variety) but I am not satisfied with the reviews for the cakes on this site, and I have found no true chocolate layer cake recipes. I would suggest Gale Gand's Chocolate Layer Cake recipe at foodtv.com.(just put "Chocolate Layer cake" on the search). I think everyone will agree how unbelievable smooth and rich this cake is!. You just need to let the layers cool completely before icing it, as it is a very velvety cake and will fall apart if not completely cooled.(I know this because it happened the first time I made it.) This is the best chocolate layer cake I have ever made, and everyone asks me to make it for their birthday! It is restaurant quality , after all Gale Gand is one of the most famous pastry chefs!!! I will make it again for my daughters birthday in 2 days! (she's asking for it anyway!)

This was excellent and worth the effort. I used the waterbath method for the icing. It only took the 8 minutes. I removed the frosting from the sauce pan to a stainless steel bowl. I think the bowl that you use is key. Stainless steel gets cold quickly and stays cold which is ideal for whipping cream. I also starting checking the baking of the cake at 25 minutes. It was done at 30 minutes. It was moist. Ghiradelli chocolate is a must!

This cake is TERRIFIC! I love baking cakes but have a difficult time with achieving that light airy cake texture. This one was close to bakery style and you don't even have to sift the dry ingredients. One thing, I found the frosting had to be fairly cold, almost chilled, before it started to thinken properly. I agree with the reviewer who placed the frosting in the freezer. Mine stayed in the freezer for almost 25 minutes. Also next time I will do 1 1/2 times the recipe for the frosting. There was enough to cover the cake and the filling for a thin layer, but extra frosting will ensure a perfect cake.

This cake was good, but dry (probably my fault). I'll try it again and hopefully I'll get it right. I found I didn't need all the toffee bits to cover the first layer. If you love chocolate, try the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle Cake on this site - now that's four forks, any way you slice it :)

I have made this cake two times, once for my own birthday! The second time I let it cool in the pan because I did not have time to remove it before going out.

Contrary to some reviews of this cake, my guests loved it because they didn't think it was too sweet. Great chocolate flavor, loved the icing, and the Skor bars added that something extra that put this cake over the top...DELICIOUS!

Just o.k. - I liked the intense milk chocolate flavor of the frosting, but it was too sweet. Maybe the corn syrup could be reduced, but I figured there was a food-chemistry reason for it. The cake itself was bland, with a kind of burnt cocoa flavor. I used toffee chips instead of heath bars because I was in a hurry, and they didn't add anything to the cake except unnecessary sweetness.

This cake was the most moist chocolate cake I have ever made. If you are hestitant to make this because of all the comments about the frosting just make it for the cake and use a different frosting.

In my opinion this cake was WAY to chocolatey. It could be that I used semisweet instead of milk chocolate in the frosting, but don't think it made that much of a difference. I followed some earlier advice and just put my frosting in the fridge and stirred it every few minutes, but then I ran out of time and stuck it in the freezer. This was a HUGE mistake. It became the consistency of cold butter, impossible to spread, and ugly as sin. In fact, I used a little extra to make truffles! I think it needed more heath bars, too.

I made this as one of several Thanksgiving desserts and everyone loved it. I did have some trouble with the frosting -- it took forever to firm up, the texture wasn't quite the same after chilling the cake overnight, but it was still great.

Made this for a birthday on 12/8 and have been requested to make it for Christmas Eve dinner. Reviews about the baking time were right on.

Definitely refrigerate melted choc. for the frosting - stir every 20 min. - chilled after an hour. Whipped perfectly. What a fabulous recipe!

This cake presents beautifully and is not difficult. The frosting makes the cake, and turned out exactly as the recipe described.

This was the best looking cake I ever made. I followed a couple of the suggestions I read from previous reviews. I used Toberlone instead of the chopped Heath bars, and the best suggestion, is to forget the whisking for 8-10 minutes and just put it into the fridge for an hour and it comes together perfectly. The problem was the cake. I've had much better tasting chocolate cake. I thought it was a BORE. I'd make the frosting again being a chocoholic.

My boyfriend and I decided to take on a baking project one weekend (neither of us had made a cake from scratch before) and once we saw the recipe for this cake, we knew we had to make it. Despite a few bumps along the road (dear Lord, could the frosting have taken any longer to form???) the result was absolutely delicious. We used 5 ounces of dark chocolate instead of 4, and substituted Toblerone for the Heath bars, and it was perfection. Rich, chocolatey, yet not too sweet. The frosting was the best I'd ever had. However, the whole deal is very time-consuming. It's more of a special occasion cake, not a "gotta satisfy that sudden chocolate cake craving" cake.

My family loved this cake! I used toffee chips instead of the actual Heath or Skor bars. I also put the chips on the sides of the cake as well as in the middle. I used a blend of milk and dark shavings. It was great. The wife and kids are already asking when I'm going to make it again.

This cake was outstanding! It is very unusual though, so if you are looking for a classic cake, this is not the recipe for you.

While it was time-consuming to make this (since it's my first "from scratch" cake ever), it's worth every minute of preparation. The icing is absolutely heavenly, with a rich thick chocolate-bar taste. The cake itself is wonderful, not too sweet so it lets the icing "take the cake" without overwhelming your sweet tooth. Just be careful & keep it in a chilly place so the icing doesn't melt and get slippery...but maybe that was just a first-timer thing. After making this for my fiance's birthday, I've been asked to make this for all my friends' birthdays. We love it!

I made this for my chocoholic (but picky) 5-year-old son's birthday and everyone raved. I baked the batter in three 8" pans instead of 2 layers (gave the cake nice height). After reading the reviews I decided to just refrigerate the ganache (icing) and stir it every so often until it was the right consistency to whip. Instead of chopping toffee bars I just used toffee bits from the baking section of the supermarket. My kids and I made curls from Hershey's milk chocolate and Special Dark bars for the top, and sprinkled toffee bits around bottom edge of cake on the platter. It tasted as good as it looked. We served it with Starbucks Java Chip ice cream. My great aunt proclaimed it the best chocolate cake she's ever had (I think it was pretty good, too.)

I love this cake. I have made it for several people's birthdays, and have been asked to make it again. Everyone likes it so much, that even the men in my family don't mind helping me shave the chocolate. The way I handle the icing is, after whisking over heat, I refridgerate it until it is cold, and then mix it with an electric mixer before I ice the cake.

I am not a huge chocolate fan, but everyone LOVED this cake. It is surely as decadent as it gets. Great recs on the frosting in the other comments. I would also use Toffee pices on the top instead of more chocolate in additon to toffee in between the two layers of cake. It just gives the cake more diverse flavor. If you have a special occassion, this is a great cake for the chocoholic in your life!

I did have some difficulty thickening the frosting. Being the impatient type, I thickened it a bit with powdered sugar which still did not render it too sweet. It was still a bit thin, but after pouring it over the cake it firmed up nicely, giving a very finished look. I am not a chocolate maniac, but I will definely repeat.

A minute on your lips, forever on your hips recipe but we loved it!!! I've only tried this once and I liked the results. The cake turned out alright (I do agree about cutting the baking time)and the frosting was really divine. However, I would probably cut back on the milk chocolate too. I'm a chocoholic but I thought 1 lb of milk chocolate on the frosting was a little too much. So I used a little less and it turned out very well.

This cake is excellent. It is not your typical American chocolate cake. What makes this recipe great is that the cake is not overpowering in sweetness. Use good chocolate and not Hershey's. Try Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate. Also, I put my icing in the fridge for an hour and take it out every 15 mins to beat it with the mixer. For all of those people that have a runny icing like pudding, it is because the icing is not cool enough. Don't give up. Stick it in the fridge and let it cool. This cake gets rave reviews from everyone. My son's school teachers call to request that I make this every time for Teacher Appreciation Day.

My oven underheats slightly, and 35 minutes seems fine for the cake. I wouldn't have a problem baking for 30 minutes, though. I always freeze my cakes for a day or so make transporting easier. The cake seems much moister after it has been frozen overnight. This cake has gotten rave reviews from my friends; I have made it 4 times, and will make it again. Leave off the fancy chocolate curls, or simply grate a little milk chocolate and/or sprinkle a few chopped Heath bars on top, it still looks good and is not as cloying. The frosting is delicious and the texture is good, even when it has been whipped too long. I have frozen the cake layers frosted and unfrosted, and both came out fine. Use good quality milk chocolate chips, or bags of unwrapped mini-kisses - don't bother to do any chopping. I have varied the sophistication of the milk chocolate flavor by mixing milk chocolates. And if the cake is a little cold when serving, a 7 to 10-second microwave blast brings out all the flavor and seems to moisten the cake more.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I didn't mind the preparation, but this cake just wasn't worth it. Baking for 35 minutes is was too long! I took mine out in 30 minutes and it was still dry. The frosting was fine, I did whip it over ice longer than the recipe called for and then beat it with the electric mixer. I would make this same frosting for a better chocolate cake recipe. But, I don't think I'll try this cake again.

Wow! Excellent taste and texture. Yes, the bake time listed is too long. Check it at 25 min. I just put the ganache in the fridge to chill and thicken, don't bother with the ice.

This cake looks spectacular-great for entertaining. I also had problems with the frosting. It would not whip up to soft peaks, more like a thick pudding consistency. I spread the frosting as well as possible using wax paper around the bottom of the cake dish to cake all the drips-and there was a lot of dripping! I saved about 1 cup of the frosting and refridgerated it overnight. The next day, it was thick and I went over the sides of the cake again with the thick frosting, added the chocolate shavings, removed the wax paper with the drippings and voila! It looked perfect and tasted great. My cake was also a bit dry, but my guests didn't think so at all!

The first time I made this cake I was rushed and did not have time to thoroughly beat the frosting and it turned out to be more of a glaze that I poured over the cake. Everyone prefered it that way!! This cake gets rave reviews.

I loved this delicious cake. Start checking the cake for doneness at 25 minutes and chill the frosting before you try to beat it.

This is truly the BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten, and it received RAVE reviews. However, be careful not to overbake. The first time I made it it did turn out a little dry. Check the cake for doneness before the 35 min. Watch carefully.

I know this recipe will appeal to some because of the Heath bars, but several people commented that their cakes turned out dry. I wanted to take the opportunity to let fellow Epicurious lovers in on the BEST chocolate cake I've tasted. You'll find it at this site under Double Chocolate Layer Cake. (Gourmet, March 1999) No, it doesn't have that crunch, but EVERYONE I've served it to has swooned over it. I've made it numerous times and this recipe is no fail-- really moist, chocolate-y and I-can't-believe-my-tastebuds delicious! Look it up now, and you won't be sorry!

I liked how the recipe turned out and it was fun to make. The cake could have been a bit moister though, perhaps on account of not having the eggs and butter at room temp. The frosting held its shape and didn't melt, maybe because the outside temps were relatively cool. I substituted bittersweet for the milk chocolate and toffee bits for the toffee bars with good results.

This is a great recipe.. I have made this cake twice in the last 2 months and have had rave reviews both times. It does take a little time but it is worth the effort.

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday. Several people told me they thought it was the best cake they had EVER tasted. Very few people believed that it was homemade. One tip- Don't overbake the cake- mine came out a little dry...

Like so many of the others my cake was dry. I cut back the baking time and I used Callebut chocolate and neither made a difference. I will have to try Lindt next time. Also, like many others, my frosting turned out great. I will use the frosting again but search for a better cake recipe.

What I like most about the cake is that is't not too sweet. Family and friends loved it and commented they have not had a better chocolate cake from any restaurant, including the Ritz!

I made this for a birthday party and everyone absolutely loved it! The cake didn't turn out dry like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I think it turned out so well because I used Lindt chocolate for everything.

My frosting came out great - no trouble with the texture. I whipped it after it was cooled. I loved the toffee in the middle, but I thought the cake was too dry. Nice flavor with the dark and milk chocolate. But if you are thinking of putting candles on the cake for a birthday celebration, watch out for flying chocolate curls. It made a little bit of a mess!

The cake was too dry for me, but the frosting was great. I did not have any problem with the frosting getting too soft, as long as it was refridgerated.

I haven't made this cake, but I have made plenty of ganache frosting. My trick is to put the frosting in the refrigerator to cool--sometimes I do the frosting the day before and leave it in the fridge overnight before whipping it. I always get raves for my ganache!

My frosting turned out okay and had a perfect texture. The trick is to be patient and let it cool enough (which took longer than the recipie seems to indicate) before whipping it. The cake itself was too soft. It cut into slices well enough, but smaller pieces on the fork seemed to fall apart. The flavor was satisfying and the toffee is a pleasant touch.

OK, so the frosting was difficult to make, but it does work. You just need to whisk it over the ice a lot longer than the recipe requires. I actually used my hand blender and it got really thick. It was a bit dry but I admit I overcooked it.

This "frosting" sucks. Why would you use corn syrup??? That makes a GANACHE which NEVER THICKENS....I can't figure out how you make a ganache thicken but this magazine has put that in recipes more than once.....you want a good frosting that will hold???.....use powerdered sugar instead of corn syrup. You can also substitue Crisco veg. shortning for the cream...holds even better. Forget this ganache stuff....it just makes a MESS.

I tried the frosting two different times using different chocolates and whipping cream each time to see if it would thicken. It never did and I had the problem of drippy frosting all over my counter after it ran off the cake. Not a pretty sight. It certainly did not look like the picture! =)

I made this cake following the recipe printed in the magazine. I found it was a little dry and certainly didn't live up to the claim of being "the chocolate cake of your dreams." I did like the idea of putting diced English toffee bars between cake and frosting layers.

Tasted great, but the frosting never thickened and ran all over the cake before we could serve it. It also takes all day to make this cake!

The correct amount of cake flour is 1 3/4 cups. I have the issue this recipe is printed in.
