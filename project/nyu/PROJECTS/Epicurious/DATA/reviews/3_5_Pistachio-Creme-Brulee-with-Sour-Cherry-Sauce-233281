Lovely! The hint of pistachio was very delicate, I'd have liked perhaps some of the leftover nuts scattered on the top to make it more complete. Whatever you do- don't discard the nuts, use them in cookies or waffles! Didn't make the sauce.

I skipped the Sour Cherry Sauce as I had too many things to cook for Thanksgiving already, but consensus was that this was the finest thing I've ever made for dessert (which is saying a lot). Used 4" ramekins and baked in a hot water bath in a 325°F oven for 30 minutes. Utterly sumptuous.

We made this recipe for a dinner party and it is delicious. The creme brulee is not as sweet as what you might be used to, so it definately needs the sour cherry sauce. I could not find sour cherries so I bought sour cherry jam at an organic grocery and topped it with that instead. My only complaint is that the recipe for the sour cherry sauce just says they are available at "specialty stores" but not which kind - I did not find them at the gourmet grocery I tried. Great texture and it really tastes like pistachio and has a slight greenish color. Loved it!

Made the for New Year's Eve and it was delicious. I made it a lot easier by leaving the pistachios in - and it was great that way. Even though the nuts sort of sink to the bottom, I would do it again.

Even though it was time consuming, it was a great ending for our dinner. The sweetness of the brulee and the slightly tart of the cherries married well. We served it with a nice chardonnay. I would definitely make this again.

Couple of answers - A chinois "mousseline" (super fine) IS better than a cheesecloth - worth the expense in the long run (Will cost $75) Second - Hey, Harwinton!! Torrington native here - nice to see locals on this site.

I did not rate because I have not made it. My question being, does anyone know if a fine Chinois and cheesecloth work as a replacement for the kitchen cloth this recipe is calling for? My guess would be the chinois would work just as well, perhaps better?? Suggestions please! :)
