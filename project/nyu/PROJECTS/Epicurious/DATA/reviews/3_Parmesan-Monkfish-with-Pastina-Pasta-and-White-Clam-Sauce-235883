This dish is fantastic!!! I've made it several times and there is a lot going at once but well worth the effort. To cut back on time I have used canned clams, juice and all, and that's just as delicious. The sauce is phenomenal, don't forget some crusty bread to sop it up. The pepper in this dish makes it pop so don't skimp, but do be careful with the lemon.
