I made this cake for Passover first night (2 days before). It was lovely. The syrup, not as much as is in the picture, really added moistness to the cake. I'll probably serve it again tomorrow night.

ok...i'm not jewish and didnt make it for Sedar. but i love this cake! i had been reading a bunch of recipes because my husband has a sweet tooth (really a mouth full of them) and thought this cake sounded great. the first 3 times i made it i had all of the ingredients but today i could not find matzo meal at either of the 2 grocery stores near me. kosherness not being an issue, i substituted the only thing i could think of that would mimic the texture and flavor of the matzo -- corn meal. believe it or not, we couldn't tell much if any difference in taste or texture. it was delicious and i would do it this way again.

Read through the directions first. I did not follow my cardinal rule of doing this and mixed everything together at one time. It turned out great though does need whipped cream. People really liked it. I like it for later in the week and not at the Sedar.

Made this for the first time for Passover this year, and we all loved it. It didn't come out quite like the picture--the top had a crust on it that cracked when I tried to cut the squares. But it looked cool like that--we called it "desert cake", which is quite appropriate for Passover! It was positively delicious--moist, lemony, and almondy--and it's true that a little goes a long way. I will definitely make it again but I'll cut the sugar...it really is quite sweet. If you can serve dairy with it, it would be great with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. Also, it kept for nearly 2 weeks wrapped loosely in plastic wrap. Enjoy!

I made this for the second Seder. I was not crazy about it, although my guests liked it. I would much rather make the chocolate torte with raspberry sauce or the strawberry eclairs. I don't know that I would make it again.

We loved this cake. It's so rich a little goes a long way. However, for us it was expensive to make; the matzo meal and flour and almonds were kind of costly. I'd like to try it again using orange instead of lemon for variety.

Very easy to make and one of the best honey cakes I've ever tasted. The lemon cut the sweetness of the honey and the cake itself was moist and delicious.
