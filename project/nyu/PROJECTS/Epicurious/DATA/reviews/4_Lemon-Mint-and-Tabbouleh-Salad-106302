This was delicious. I used it as a side dish for a party serving 40. I made it with 3 cups of bulgur, so I tripled the recipe, but only doubled the dressing. YUM!

Excellent dish! Lovely balance of salty, sour, bitter and sweet and great depth of flavor. I did add minced cucumber and a tiny bit of very finely minced red onion - it just seemed to go with everything and came out perfect. Also, it is difficult to find bulgur in the grocery stores in my neighborhood (sighh....) so I used quinoa as another review suggested. Definitely will make this sgain- tasty and healthy!

So good! I also make it with quinoa - red, which makes it beautiful too! The 30 minute wait is key, it's even better the next day (brought back up to room temperature of course, nobody likes cold tomatoes!). I like to make a batch over the weekend then have it for a side 2 or 3 times during the week.

A great tabbouleh recipe. Packed with flavor, but not oily or bitter!

This was really tasty. I made it as the recipe stated and I wouldn't change anything. My first time with bulgur and my husband went back for third helpings! Leaving it for thirty minutes seems to be key.

Absolutely delicious! This was my first time to make tabbouleh, and it was as good or better than what I've eaten in restaurants. Yum!

I used Quinoa instead of Bulgar. I also added black olives it was a light and delicious side dish

I used couscous because it was on hand, and used more lemon than called for. Very nice and refreshing, a great change from tossed salad.

Easy and delicious. This will definitely become a staple.

I doubled the recipe, but for the dressing, I used only 1/4 c (the amount for the original single recipe); I also added 3/4 tsp cumin to the dressing. Lots of flavor, without being heavy or overly oily. This would be most ideal with flavorful summer tomatoes, but it was still delicious now.

I substituted couscous for the tabbouleh and it was terrific. Made couscous, let cool a bit, and then mix in all the remaining ingredients. I also substitued chives for the green onions and omitted the mint (I went with what I had in fridge) and it was great! You could even mix in cooked shrimp if you wanted to make it a main dish. YUM! This will become staple summer time dish!

I made this for my family and a couple friends and we all loved it! I really liked how bright the lemon flavor was! This is a great dish...quick, easy, and tasty!

I've made this several times and I LOVE it. Lots of flavor, travels well, and good served at room temp. The dressing is very lemony and delicious!

I liked this dish- it seemed a bit on the sour side when I first mixed everything up- but after the 30 minutes it needed to blend flavors it was great-nice and simple side.
