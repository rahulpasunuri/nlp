I thought this was wonderful! I used cilantro instead of basil and added a bit of chicken stock, sour cream and garlic, and dashes of cayenne and cumin. Subtle, cool and creamy. First course for grilled steak, asparagus and nectarine pie.

This soup is delicious! I use fresh dill instead of basil, since dill is wonderful with cucumbers, & I use sour cream in place of yogurt. I also add a little of the sour cream to the soup, while mixing.

Agreed with other reviewers regarding milk; I didn't have buttermilk so I used lowfat milk and it worked just fine.

I used Kefir instead of buttermilk. This was light and tasty, good for a summer vegetarian dinner.

This is a good base for a light summer soup. The tomato salad is good for a bit of texture but I am not certain how much it adds as far as taste. I added some crab meat (the mock sushi style) which added a nice sweetness as well as a high quality (high fat) sweet yogurt. That extra sweet really balances out the flavors. We are with crusty bread and it was a in itself.

Excellent beginning to a summer meal. A creamy and refreshing soup that is flavorful without being overpowering.

This is the quintessential summer soup - light, refreshing and frothy. I used a really large avocado which gave it enough flavor. Definitely a repeater!

totally agree with the cook in houston TX. buttermild too strong so i added another avocado and a bit more cucumber, red onion, and basil. the flavors came through a bit more, but still subtle. the "salad" + yogurt made it all work. and totally easy.

I liked the soup as it is really refreshing on a hot summer day. I modified slightly by adding some curry powder. Not too much maybe a 1/2 teaspoon or so.

This soup seems to be a love it or hate it combination. My father and I loved the subtle flavors with and without the salad. My husband thought it was tasteless. I agree with the increases in basil etc. I wonder if adding some lime juice to the soup itself would add a greater depth of flavor.

I thought this was very easy and refreshing. I added crabmeat to the "salad" on top, which was a nice addition. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe as written.

Saw this almost exact same recipe in Martha Stewart Everyday Food magazine, and made it to rave reviews. I topped them with grilled shrimp, which lends a little more flavor.

Too much work, not enough flavor.

This is a really nice soup - great texture and flavor - and I substituted equal parts skim milk and non-fat yogurt as that's all I had. That worked very well. I would recommend something to give it a little more kick however - little more onion or tiny bit of fresh chili pepper. And I would certainly increase the basil portion. Really, very simple to make, a crowd pleaser and nice to present for guests.

Didn't think this was a very zippy cold soup. I think it might have been because I used a substitute for the buttermilk (1 cup milk with 3 tsp fresh lemon juice x 2.5 to make the 2.5 cups of 'buttermilk')? Seems thin and very one-dimensional in flavor (too basil-y). I have made other, much better, cold soups in my time.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I doubled the amount of basil and substituted light sour cream for some of the buttermilk which thickened it up a little bit. Beautiful presentation and the flavor was refreshing. Served with pita triangles for a fabulous first course!

Very delicious and refreshing soup. There is one thing I will change next time though: I felt that the buttermilk flavor came across a little bit too strong, overpowering the delicate avocado and cucumber flavors. So, next time I will try replacing buttermilk with plain kefir or even yogurt mixed with water.

Yummy! It was all I wanted for dinner during an summer heat wave. Some modifications on my second batch: Doubled the basil in the soup, doubled the amount of "salad" to make soup a bit more chunky.

This soup is so good. It is part of my summer entertainment recipies. One guest liked it so much they ate two bowls and never got to the main course. A great change from the everpresent gazpacho.

Elegant presentation--received rave reviews on the looks. My guests and I agreed that mixing the yoghurt and "salad" mellowed the flavor, creating a delicious chilled soup. It was a perfect starter for Easter dinner--very Spring-like!

Terrific and easy! Makes a great pairing with salad or light sandwich for lunch. I wouldn't change a thing.

Wonderfully refreshing! I have made it a few times already. If you don't mind the extra fat or calories substitute a little crème fraîche for the yogurt. This soup is appealing to eye and the palate. A summer favorite!

Wow! A great summer cold soup and very easy to make. We had it with company and everyone loved it.

The soup was refreshing and delicious. We thought the topping made the whole dish, that's what gave it all the flavor!

I am a fan of cold summer soups. I liked this soup, and it was good, but I was not very fond of the topping. I enjoyed the soup without the topping.

This soup was wonderfully refreshing. I just love the cool taste of cucumbers. It makes very good lunch fare for the middle of the summer here in Phoenix. Just add a few crackers and some fresh fruit for a light yet satisfying meal.

This was the first cold soup I have ever made and it was a wonderful introduction. Go easy on the red onions as they can overpower the delicate nature of the soup.

Great summer starter. Made this for an impromptu BBQ and got great reviews. Lots of basil is good to keep the soup lively. Very quick to prepare and a beautiful colour.
