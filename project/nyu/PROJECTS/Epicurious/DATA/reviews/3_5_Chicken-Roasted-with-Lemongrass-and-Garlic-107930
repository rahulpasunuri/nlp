This turned out very tasty! This one will go in my recipe box. I cut back the garlic and chilies, next time I will use all that it calls for. It was not over powering.

I doubled the recipe, used drumsticks and thighs, and put them on my Weber gas grill. This has to be one of the best grilled chicken dishes I've ever had. The marinade imparted just the right amount of flavor after 10 hours. I removed 75% of the marinade before putting the chicken on the grill. The residual marinade charred nicely -- probably the result of the sugar. Char = flavor = everybody happy. Served with some stir fried rice noodles and veggies .

I used an onion instead of 5 shallots and sliced chicken thighs instead of a whole bird. I cooked it in a wok on the stove and it was incredible! Would have been even better grilled but that will have to wait for summer. Fresh lemongrass is key. The taste permeated all the meat after only 6 hours of marinating. The stir fry veggies were an unworthy pairing so I made Vietnamese spring rolls to go with. I served this over coconut rice which went well with the lemongrass flavor. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was awesome and very easy to make. I will definately make it again.

I was hoping for more flavor but I must say I didn't cook it the way it was written. However my guests did seem to really enjoy it so I'm going to give 3 forks instead of 2. I used the marinade on chicken quarters overnight and then grilled outside on the BBQ for 1 hour over low heat (It was 90 out that day) . The chicken was very moist but didn't have as much punch as I was hoping for. Served this with a VERY good SPICY SESAME NOODLE, GREEN BEAN AND CARROT SALAD Bon Appétit, July 1998 and a simple cucumber with rice vinegar salad.

This is a great dish and really easy to make, as long as you remember to marinate the chicken the night before. You don't have to use a whole chicken; you can just as easily use breast halves or whatever. The lemongrass is wonderfully flavorful without being overpowering. Lemongrass is not that difficult to find. Most major grocery stores carry it in their Asian produce section. Or if you're lucky enough to live near an Asian grocery store, they should have it as well.

While I enjoyed it, it wasn't special enough to be worth the hassle to find enough fresh lemongrass. If you do have fresh lemongrass, definitely give it a try. I used cut up pieces of chicken instead of two chicken halves and it worked fine.

The taste of this chicken reminds me of those Vietnam food I always love. The chicken is very juicy and tender. If I could find a Vietnamese dipping sauce recipe to go with this chicken, then everything would be perfect.

Great flavor! Easy to prepare. I served it with steamed rice.
