I am getting very annoyed at reviewers who give recipes 4 forks based on considerable changes they have made to a recipe. As written, this recipe doesn't turn out as expected and lacks flavor and texture. Most of the suggestions involve turning this recipe into a typical one for crab cakes. I also agree with reviewer who said that the mayo/yogurt/sour cream sauce (I used a combo of all three to be safe) is like sour cream with grass in it (and I had a lot left over). I hadn't been a subscriber to Gourmet magazine in its later years, but if this is an example of the types of recipes they printed...

I made this for my kids and it certainly smells lovely. Being from Nova Scotia, we are very particular about our fish cakes and, due to this, I'm getting a bit p.oed with regards to how they are totally falling apart in the pan. I would follow the other reviewers as to additions and to coating them in flour before frying. If I were to make these again I would really cut the salmon into smaller pieces (maybe minced) in order for cohesion. Nothing more disappointing than it all falling apart in the pan. The taste is good and the dipping sauce is great altho I had to substitute dill for the tarragon...probably better with dill...tarragon is too overpowering if you actually want to TASTE the salmon

This was very tasty. Dipping sauce adds also. Nice as an elegant appetizer or make a little larger for bunless patties.

These are delicious, and the sauce is superb - you must use fresh ingredients for the sauce! I used 1/2 panko and 1/2 regular bread crumbs. I little extra mayonnaise helps things hold together. I probably added garlic, I add it to almost everything. I make a batch of these and pack some for lunch at work, have some for dinner, and I get a few days of meals out of them. That just about satisfies my cravings for them for a little while!

I'm not a huge salmon fan, but my husband and daughter like it so I tried these today. My two year old devoured them! I cut the salmon into much smaller pieces, used all panko for the bread crumbs, and added the 3T capers, and green onions another reviewer suggested and about 2T mayonnaise. They fell apart a little bit, but not terribly. I made the cakes larger for entree servings. I also left out the lime zest and used about 1T of lemon juice. Since sour cream is much different in Sweden, I used creme fraiche for the sauce and lemon juice instead of lime since that's what I had. Although I'm not so keen on salmon, the fact that my daughter loved these means we'll be having them again for sure.

These flavors are outstanding. I had a little trouble keeping the cakes together, but will try again with finer bread crumbs. Crumbled cakes are still tasty, but for guests, it would be better to have them look pretty, too.

This was an excellent recipe. I got raves from my husband during dinner. I did make some adjustments. I read the suggestions of other reviewers and decided to follow along with their insights. Firstly I had some alaska smoked salmon on hand so I used that to make this dish instead of fresh salmon. 2nd I followed the suggestion of 4 tbsp of mayo, 3 tbsp capers, chop green onions, a dash cayenne, and the juice of 1 lime, I added to the mixture. I also coated the cakes in a dusting of flour before frying. They turned out awesome and did not fall apart at all. The sauce was the perfect compliment. I would think that if you only had canned salmon on hand, that would do nicely in this recipe as well. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks to all the other reviewers for their suggestions. You were spot on!

My variation on this was delicious! Based on what I remembered from the restaurant where I made salmon cakes, I added some very finely chopped red pepper, celery, and minced garlic, put in some lemon juice in place of the zest, and added about 1/3 cup of mayo, which made the cakes stick together so they're much easier to handle. Served with parsley aioli, and they're delicious! Also good with other flaky fish -- good use for any extra fish in the freezer!

Wonderful and very easy. Made with the dipping sauce but couldn't find fresh tarragon so I used fresh dill instead and it was excellent. Served salmon cakes hot from the pan with the sauce (room temperature) and they were perfect as a light winter lunch.

I make this recipe exactly as stated with one exception. I make the salmon cakes larger and serve two per person on a salad plate with a dollop of dipping sauce along side mixed greens with a lime vinaigrette. An absolutely wonderful appetizer course. I get rave reviews every time!

mmmmmmmmmm! i added scallions, a large red onion, and used dried bread crumbs (more panko [japanese bread crumbs] than italian) and used about a half cup more than what's stated on the recipe and it turned out great! i also used the basil aioli sauce instead of the taragon sauce and my boyfriend and i loved this appetizer! with the additions to the recipe, the salmon cakes still crumbled a little but all in all, it pretty much stayed together...i only served three of the cakes for appetizers for our romantic dinner but all the leftovers were devoured by us the very next day! can't wait to make these again!!

I added a few scallions to the mix and cooked in small amount of vegetable oil and thought they turned out well. Also, due to lack of ingredients, I substituted plain nonfat yogurt for about 1/3 of the dipping sauce mayo and sour cream and it added some tang and lowered the calorie count, too! I used dried tarragon about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. It was a nice alternative to poached salmon, which is what I usually make, and my 9-yr-old liked them well enought to ask me to make them again some time soon.

Rating: 1
i just made this recipe and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very dry and the lime flavor was too much. I would add either a leek or scallion to the mixture to add some texture and less bread crubms. I might also use oil in stead of the cooking spray.

Rating: 3
These went to a party with me and none came back. The flavor is great and the dipping sauce is perfect. The cakes did tend to drop pieces as they were cooking and didn't look perfect, but so what? I had no lime and found that lemon worked very well. I agree with a previous reviewer that green onion and capers would be a very good addition, and will try that next time.

Rating: 4
I added 2T light mayo (and a dash of cayenne) to the mixture because I thought the consistency was somewhat dry. I used fresh salmon caught right from the bay and I followed another fellow Marylander's advice about making mayo/chili paste/worcester sauce dip instead of the chive dipping sauce. I have tried several salmon and crab cake recipes and so far this one is my favorite. The addition of the lime and cayenne gave the cakes a unique kick.

Rating: 4
I like this recipe because it is easy to follow and not too time consuming. I added capers and green onions as per another review - a great idea. I also made the Basil Aioli for a dipping sauce ( I made it with lime instead of lemon) and loved it. I think the Basil Aioli might be the recipe the cook from Helena, MT was referencing as I was also unable to to find a Garlic-Basil Aioli recipe.

I enjoy this recipe very much. I've made it following the recipe exactly; and, I've made it adding some burmunda onion, chive, and cilantro. I use the basil-garlic aioli sauce (on Epicurious) and I've put hot chili sauce on the table for those who like a kick. Easy and delicious.

This recipe works best with cold leftover salmon. I added minced red onion, capers, a little lemon, and used one part regular breadcrumbs to three parts panko. The panko, I think, is key to the overall crispiness and texture.

I made these as appetizers and our guests loved them. The key is to make them small enough where they can be easily handled in the frying pan. Make sure to brown them well before turning them over. Also, overcooking will dry them out. Although the recipe says to eat them at room temperature, I found that they tasted better warm.

The biggest drawback was that my house smelled of fish for two days. I wouldn't recommend cooking these the day of a party. The sauce makes it.

Rating: 1
I would not make this again. It was not moist and there were not enough bread crubs. Therefore it would not hold together long enough to even form the patties. It was bland and uninteresting. If you want to make salmon cakes, use the scallop cake recipe here instead and substitute the salmon. a waste of salmon.

We used creme fraiche in the sauce and substituted dill for the tarragon. A very tasty addition to Sunday brunch.

I made these for an office brunch this morning. They were well-received, but that was by a group of people who didn't have to prepare them! I found the cakes difficult to handle in the pan--they broke apart and were tricky to flip. They did, however, taste good enough that I will make them again. Perhaps I will smash the fish up a little more. That said, the tarragon-chive sauce was not worth my (or the cow's) time.

Extremely simple to make and quite tasty! I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Do the 1/3" dice if you are making appetizer/mini sized cakes. Otherwise, do a 3/4" cubes for a large patty-big enough for a hearty meal. I didn't do the tarragon sauce, but served it with a sweet chili sauce and a mango/pineapple chutney. Delicious! My toddler wolfed down an adult size portion!

We made this recipe for a dinner party and served it hot with a Thai dipping sauce since the reviews for the Tarragon sauce were poor. The salmon cakes were GREAT! And while we thought the batter was very wet, we had no problems with the cakes falling apart! Guests loved them.

It's got potential. On impulse, I bought some salmon stir-fry pieces but didn't really know what to do with them until I did some research here and found this. Added dried tarragon and finely chopped green onion. Browned in a non-stick skillet with a tablespoon of butter. I want to read all of the reviews and incorporate some of your suggestions! Did not bother with the sauce; used store-bought tartar instead. *hanging head in shame...*

I used this as an Easter appetizer. The ladies LOVED it. The men (not big salmon-lovers)were indifferent. The golfball-sized salmon cakes were perfect finger-food. Unfortunately, it's hard to keep the bread crumbs on, so the results are half-naked salmon cakes. I would have added more lime to enhance the tartness, and completely abandoned the dipping sauce (it was predominantly sourcream, so it suffocated any flavor the salmon and lime had). Everyone who ate the salmon WITH the dipping sauce said "Oh. I can't taste anything." After cooking diligently, I WANT my guests to taste the fruits-of-my-labor.

This was great for breakfast! Quick & easy, but what makes this one a keeper is the flavor. I didn't expect such great flavor. As I was preparing it, I was not convinced I'd ever make it again. It kind of crumbled in the pan, (flip carefully) Then, the first bite, oh my God, it was gooood. Two things I'd do differently: cut the fish smaller, minimize crumble - I wouldn't change the recipe at all, except the dip. I'm gonna try thickened yogurt instead of the sour cream & mayo next time, a heart healthy alternative that tastes just as good or better. Do this one, you won't be sorry.

This recipe is perfect for the salmon lover. For all of the people who reviewed it with "fishy" or "bad texture"; free your mind. A salmon cake is just that- a cake made of salmon. If you don't care for the "fishy" flavor of salmon perhaps you're buying a low grade of salmon. Perhaps the salmon you've had in the past was grossly overcooked and therefore had little flavor. Don't criticize a recipe because of it's content when the contents are clear and very well complement themselves. A true culinarian can recognize a good recipe whether he or she likes it or not. This is a good recipe. It is simple in content and execution. The best recipes are often the simplest.

We enjoyed this recipe. We made the cakes slightly larger and they seemed to hold together better than the smaller one. The sauce was great!

I used canned salmon to save an extra trip to the market. Although I was not sure what to expect, it turned out great. Had to add an extra egg to keep the cakes together, which did not hurt a thing. The dip brought it all together and my son, who does not like fish, ate a half a dozen with mounds of dip. We were impressed, this would be wonderful for a party, make ahead and fry at the last minute.

My husband and I both loved this recipe and scarfed down the cakes with...of all things...blueberry chutney and Patak's lime pickle! I don't like heavy dairy dippers, and here in Maine blueberries and salmon are a natural pair. I added some lime pickle to the salmon before cooking, as well as including it as a condiment, to intensify the lime flavor. I used suggestions from previous reviewers and cooked the salmon first. I broiled it skin-side-up for a brief time, then baked it for a few minutes. The skin came off easily, and the fish was not totally cooked in the center but was very easy to work with. Also used just egg white, and increased the amount of fresh bread crumbs. It was fabulous, and made a very quick late supper.

Thank you cook from Westchester County! I had leftover mahi mahi and had no idea what to do with it - used those suggestions with the exception of the tarragon dipping sauce. I had some leftover VERY garlicky pesto and used that instead. Yummy for leftover fish!!

This sounds great. I am terrible with fish, I remember the horror of salmon loaf every spring, made from canned salmon. Now where we live, we can finally get fresh salmon, and last time we grilled it, it was GREAT, however it left 3 perfect salmon steaks frozen. So, this would appear to be a great use for them. Appreciate all the hints too! I'm ready to fry.

I loved this recipe. I used homemade rye bread crumbs which i increased to 1 cup for inside and then coated them again. I just seared them with some olive oil until they were crisp. Yummy. I also followed some suggestions of adding onion and the tarragon sauce in to help bind. Outstanding.

Rating: 3
Per other cook's suggestions, I made some adjustments and these turned out great. First, forget about the 1/3 in cubes! I cut the salmon into really tiny pieces. I then increased the breadcrumbs to 1 cup, added 2 tblsp minced shallots, 2 tablsp softened cream cheese, 2 tblsp diced green pepper, 1/2 teaspoon celery seed, 2 tblsp tarragon-chive dipping sauce and 1 teaspoon garlic powder. Mixture should be very "damp" but not runny. Also increased the black pepper and made into "burger size" patties. Cooked 'em up with a tblsp of butter in the pan until they were golden (3 minutes on side 1 & 2 minutes on side 2). Served these on toasted buns with a slice of tomato and choice of mayo or the dipping sauce and they were great! Actually trying the same recipe with tuna tonight.

I made these for a brunch. They were all consumed rapidly. Even the kids ate them. After reading the other reviews, I also added to the mix, more fresh breadcrumbs a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese and a spoonfull of the tarragon chive sauce to hold the cakes together. The sauce should be made a day ahead to let the flavors peak.

Rating: 3
I actually enjoyed these but they're not by far the best I've ever had. I chopped up half the salmon and cubed the other half. Plus I added 1 tablespoon chopped dill to the taragon dipping sauce. You must use fresh breadcrumbs, otherwise you're wasting all that good salmon. BTW, here in Europe you can get Laurent-Perrier Rosé Brut NV Champage for roughly $60.00 or so; in the USA, expect to pay $120.00 or more IF you can find it.

Like the cook from Pryor, OK I pretty much altered this recipe. On the West Coast of Canada we call them patties, too. I used leftover baked salmon and skipped the breadcrumbs substituting 3/4 cup cooked mashed potatoes. I did not use the dijon or lime, but instead used 1 heaping tsp. of Madras Curry Powder and a good handful of chopped green onion. I needed an extra egg, too. I fried them to a crisp golden brown and served with a choice of bearnaise sauce or homemade Major Grey chutney - Delicious!!

I made alot of changes to this .. almost a different dish entirely, but we absolutely loved it. I used salmon, left-over from a previous dinner, that I had pan grilled in garlic, olive oil, and butter. In food processor, I chopped 2 shallots, some green onions, 1/2 green pepper. Then blended in 12 oz softened cream cheese, the salmon, 2 eggs, bread crumbs, some grated romano cheese, couple dashes of jalapeno sauce. When nice and creamy, I poured into a buttered loaf pan and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes. Yummy! Texture of a cheese cake but good strong flavors. For the sauce, I substitued dill for the tarragon, increased the amount of chives, added a dash of garlic powder. This will be a repeat for us!

I love salmon patties (that is what we call them). However this recipe does need improvments and all the other suggestions are great. I would like to emphasize the baking of the fish to be used or as what we do is fresh pack the fish (jar it) which cooks it in the jar. When you use the fresh pack, you can crumble it easily and add your additional ingredients. Baking the fish will give you the same result. This allows you to form the patties and brown them quickly and easily.

I would rate it a 4, but I made it into a 4 with my additions. I added a couple of tablespoons chopped chives, parmesan/romano blend grated cheese, a few more bread crumbs and I always beat the egg really well. I bought fresh salmon filet, skinned it and pan fried it on both sides until it was gently cooked through, added salt and lemon to it at the end. I flaked it and just mixed it with all of the ingredients. I also added some garlic flavored olive oil and butter to the pan to make the cakes brown nicely. The recipe received raves. I made it for an afternoon tea.

This is a good recipe. If you want to add zest to it, grate 1/2 small onion or slice thinly one green onion and add a dash of hot pepper sauce. My family is from the south and this is the way we make them. Really good. Some people substitute potato flakes or self-rising flour for bread crumbs. It is a matter of preference. I like them either way.

We loved this recipe. I used fresh Stealhead from the Columbia River and it was great. We also like the sauce, I think it would also be great if you added a little fresh ginger to it. If it tastes fishy then your fish is to old. Great Recipe.

I loved the flavors in both the fish cakes and the sauce. Using fresh salmon I had no trouble with an overly fishy taste. However, I agree that the texture was not ideal--I've had nice results running the fish through the fine grind plate of my food grinder and doubling the fresh bread crumbs. Sauce is equally good on steamed green beans, hot or cold!

I love salmon but these cakes tasted "fishy". The salmon cakes are not really complimented by any of the ingredients added to it so that it really just tastes (and looks) like cubes of salmon in the shape of a "crab cake". I also made the chive-tarragon dipping sauce and it tasted like lime and mayonaise. The cakes and dip together tasted okay, but I really don't think I'd ever make this again.
