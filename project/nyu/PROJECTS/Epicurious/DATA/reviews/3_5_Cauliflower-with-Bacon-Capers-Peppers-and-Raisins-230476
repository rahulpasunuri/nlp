Definitely took longer to cook the cauliflower through than stated in the recipe. Turned out pretty good. Will serve it over Israeli couscous next time.

Very good. Similiar to other recipes I have, except the cauliflower is not roasted in the oven and it has cream -- I used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of cream, no other changes. This is a very easy recipe -- lots of flavor. Will definitely make again and again. Served with Bacon, Onin & brown lentils and Wine glazed winter vegetables (Cooking Light recipes). Was a great 'comfort' food dinner.

we'll try anything once and I am so glad we tried this weird-sounding dish - it's now my favoite way to use cauliflower! But one thing - you MUST use orange/yellow cauliflower (I don't know if there is a name for that?) It's not nearly as good with ordinary white cauliflower.

Blecch. There's not an ingredient in this recipe that I don't normally love (which is why I gave it a shot) but the flavors did not meld.

This recipe got my kids to eat cauliflower. Hubby was a bit turned off by the capers and raisins until I told him to eat them WITH the cauliflower. Used half and half as I didn't have cream, but definitely something I'll make again.

This recipe surprised me so much that after a year of lurking on this site, I was compelled to write my first review. Who would have thought these flavors would work together so well? Not me! I love cauliflower but my husband hates it. I've tried every cauliflower recipe on this site trying to find something he would like. No luck. This one looked so odd, but I thought, what the heck. We both loved it. Made it as written. I highly recommend it!

I was looking for a way to add some excitement to cauliflower, and these ingredients were intriguing. I did omit the cream, and still found it very, very tasty. The raisins really bring it off.

My husband and I really liked the combination of flavors in this recipe. We just served it with a simple roasted chicken - it made a delicious week night meal.

I was looking for a Sicilian-type cauliflower recipe; this delivered some of the flavors. However, for health reasons, i did as other reviewers did and omitted the cream. The dish was quite good anyhow.

Admitedly, the ingredients in this sounded a little bizarre...but I read the other reviews and didn't have any other bright ideas for my organic cauliflower. I had to sub the golden raisins with regular raisins because that's what I had on hand. I thought the flavors and textures were wonderful - especially for a cold, winter night. I served it with some leftover grilled flank steak - easy enough. I've saved this one to my recipe box - definitely a keeper! Next time, however, I think I'll add maybe a handful of toasted, chopped pecans...I felt like it could use a little crunch. Still...a winner!

Not only do the blend of flavors work exceptionally well, but using orange cauliflower means this is a very colorful dish as well. I omitted cream, and it worked splendidly. Agree with other reviewers that more oil is needed to coat the vegetables, and steaming in a little vegetable broth speeds the cooking time. I used apple-smoked bacon for extra flavor.

This turned out extremely well (and I was skeptical)... I basically wanted to use up some excess cauliflower and bell pepper in the house, and having all the other ingredients, I picked this one, leaving out the bay leaf, since I dislike them. I've tried it a few ways since. It works extremely well with orange cauliflower, which is milder, sweeter (a bit like sweet corn), and more nutritious than regular white. The combo of red peppers and raisins is really wonderful in the cream sauce. A simple way to cheat (though it's not difficult by any stretch) is to steam the cauliflower and bell pepper for about 15 minutes (I actually steam a cut-in-half lemon with them to make getting the juice a cinch) and toss it all together.

Great blend of flavors, with nice variety. Have made several times, always to rave reviews.

I have made this recipe several times and haven't changed a thing. It is delicious just as is and my dinner guests loved it. A very nice change from my usual cauliflower recipes.

Unusual but very nice. I omitted the bayleaf (which i don't like) and increased the lemon juice until the sauce tasted very slightly tart (1 1/2 tbsp). Next time I will add more capers. Warning! Browning the cauliflower properly needs more fat than is released from 3 oz of standard supermarket bacon. I used some olive oil. Also, unless you have a very large skillett it better be done in batches.

Well, it was quick. It used a bunch of things that I needed to use up. Overall a bit odd and not repeatable.
