Scrumptious! Quick and easy to make. Use recipe for dinner or appetizers. Suggest double or tripling the recipe so no one has to go without. You definitely won't have left-overs.

This was a quick and easy weeknight meal. A great homemade version of PF Changs, and likely more healthier as well. I served this for dinner and it was filling without being too rich.

Great recipe, very tasty! Next time I would double the recipe amounts, serving size is a bit wrong. I made it as a dinner for two, maybe serving size of 8 is correct as an appetizer dish.

I doubled the seasoning and it came out pretty well. seems like it's missing something, but I'm not sure what.

Good, almost like PF Changs

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was moist, had wonderful flavor, and simple to make. The dipping sauce really makes it! I'm making it for dinner again, tonight. It deserves an extra 1/2 star in my opinion!

I made this as a light dinner to be enjoyed outside on the deck. It was perfect - not too filling, quick, and tasty. The only change I made was to use reconsituted mixed dried mushrooms and about 1 Tbs of fresh ginger. AND- I served it cool, not warm. Perfect for a picnic. The bottled sweet chili sauce gave it more kick - although my MIL prefered the wraps without the extra sauce. It was even better for lunches the next day - could definitely be made ahead of time!

This was a delicious and convenient dinner when served with rice. I doubled the soy sauce, scallions, cornstarch, garlic and ginger and it came out just right. I would have preferred the sauce to be a little sweeter, but that's why dipping in the sweet chili sauce works so well. I was able to throw this dish together in 30 minutes while my 8-month-old napped. (Major bonus!) It's not out of this world, but we will definitely enjoy this again.

Hey, I just noticed in my notes - I used hoisin sauce instead of sweet chili sauce. That might have made a difference!

I made this with iceberg lettuce and I used water chestnuts (already sliced from the can) instead of cashews. I minced the chicken thighs in the food processor. I used extra mushrooms - dried/rehydrated shiitake and fresh button (about double - I used 2 shiitake and 3 button). I served it with Sriracha sauce. We loved this dish and it will be a regular in my line up. Came together really fast for a great weeknight supper. I made my son something else because I didn't think he would like all the mushrooms and he was reaching over and eating the chicken because it smelled so good. :-)

I made this with tofu instead of chicken, and doubled all the spices, and it was DELICIOUS! Just like PF Chang's or any Chinese restaurant. I didn't run into any of the dryness that other reviewers mentioned, probably because the tofu doesn't dry out as easily, but also possibly because I doubled the soy sauce as well. It was so good, perfect balance of flavors. I will definitely make again with chicken as well.

I think this recipe is good, but it needs a little tweaking. The soy sauce needs to be doubled, as well as the spices. I also added some sriracha and toasted sesame oil to the stirfry. Additionally, I found that the chicken needs to be cooked a bit longer than the recipe states in order to not be slimy. With these changes it's really yummy! I served it with brown rice, not lettuce leaves.

Agree with past reviews. Dish is bland. I doubled up the ginger, garlic, onions and soy and it was a bit better - but it still needs something.

I found it boring as well. Most lettuce wraps end up with some kind of sauce, and this was quite dry. I added lime and cilantro, but it was still only OK.

My family loved it but I did find the chicken lacked flavor. I'd ramp up the ginger and garlic next time. Also, I too served it with brown rice and it was a meal. Great for week night dinners

This was very simple to put together. I made a meal out of it serving it w/rice. It was delicious with the sweet Asian chili sauce. I'll make this one again.
