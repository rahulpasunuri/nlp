Love the litle toasts. It makes for a special little treat for those you love.

The simplicity is what makes this a 4-fork. So many compliments for so little time. Had toasts and spread left over -- it IS a course in itself!

Nothing exceptional. Thanks for the vinegrette recipe. The rest is just plain show-off.

Light, savory salad that is a perfect after-entree salad. The little roquefort toasts are great and almost like serving a cheese course. Very nice flavor and simple.
