I slow cooked bone-in pork shoulder with the Lexington-Style BBQ sauce. So easy and quite the hit on July 4th as sliders. Yummy

Excellent flavors!! I've made it just as noted on recipe over four times. Never disappointed. Guests LOVE it! Distinct flavors. Fire up the water smoker or indirect side of a grill with a water pan really adds alot.

I made this wonderful recipe for New Year's Day this year for four grandsons and their parents. Without a doubt this is one of the best things I have ever made. It's a little bit of prep work that needs to be done with the dry marinade and I changed the process a little to suit my needs by smoking the meat in the weber barbecue for two hours and then putting it into a large crockpot to cook the rest of the way. I made a slight change to the vinegar sauce by warming it up just before boiling and then letting it sit until needed. I also strained it so that the hot pepper seeds were removed but the little "bite" was left behind. Among the grandsons they ate 12 sandwiches and begged to take the leftovers home. I happily packed up the ziplock containers for them. And whoever thought of coleslaw on this sandwich??? It is just magic when you put it with the pork. Enjoy and "pig out"!

This is a good recipe. It was a hit with my family. Make sure you use indirect heat or a smoker (works best). Some may find the barbeque sauce have too much vinegar and you may want to sweeten it up.

Halved the recipe and cooked it in a Le Creuset dutch oven. Also, did not have the bone-in or the skin (waaah!) but let me tell you - this pulled pork RULES. The vinegar taste is strong but that's what makes this dish distinctive and the coleslaw, which is excellent, cuts and compliments the vinegar-flavored pork nicely. Talk about falling-apart tasty pork goodness...it's really a great recipe and definitely stands out from the ordinary pulled pork meal. And easy to make, just give yourself time. Highly recommend making the buns from this same issue. Just do it!

4 stars in underating this dish. I prepared this recipe for the first time at a Memorial Day celebraion. In a word, it was AWESOME. However, I made a slight change to the recipe by cooking the bone-in pork shoulder with pecan wood v. hickory. Pecan has a milder more balanced flavor than hickory- in fact I never use hickory because of the heavy smokiness. And by all means, use a good hardwood lump charcoal and don't "overwood" your fire. Too many meals have been runined by the cook's assumption that more is better. Only 3-4 chunks are necessary to obtain a full rich flavor. I also incorporated a fuild pan which was filled with Sprite and a stick of butter- this provides for a flavorful & moist atmosphere in the cooker. My 7 LB. pork shoulder was cooked in an offset smoker with an avg. temp of 350 deg. for 5 hours and it came out perfect... AND PLEASE, get yourself an instant read thermometer if you don't already have one. If you elect to use the Lexington bbq sauce with this dish (too vinegary for my persoanl taste), I would suggest doubling the ingredients to have emough on hand for those who like to flood their food.
