I made 2 pies with the same filling - one with the crust mentioned here and one with a regular purchased crust which I prebaked. I baked them at night and served them for dessert for lunch the next day. The crust from the recioe got a bit soggy by the time we ate. The purchased crust - I had lined it with melted chocolate before mounding in the filling - was perfect. All in all - a very good recipe - simple, very fresh tasting and good looking. I served the cream on the side because of various diets.

This pie gets a rough rap...it is excellent with a few minor adjustments. The reviewers stating that 5T of butter for the crust are right on, that is the perfect amount to get a nice crunchy crust. The filling-the sugar completely depends on your berries, if they are on the tart side, you will need the full cup, if they are sweeter, you may want to cut down to 2/3-3/4 cup...we like ours with a balance of tart and sweet so adjust accordingly. Also, dissolving the cornstarch with the sugar and berries prior to heating is a MUST. I add an extra 1/2 T of cornstarch if my berries are extra juicy to be sure it will set up. Finally, rather than mixing lemon and organe flavors-we use lemon juice with 1t lemon zest-that is merely personal preference though. All in all-excellent summer dessert but you do have to consider the berries you are dealing with in order to get the desired, great results.

The crust is a soup. Smells great, but I'm scratching my head about how to salvage this mess. The crust recipe is very, very simple; there should not be this many negative reviews for such a simple recipe. A lot of the positive reviews mention premade crusts; clearly that is the course I should have pursued.

I thought I would make this pie for my birthday, having eaten a similar one in the past. What a disaster! After molding the crust to the dish, it melted into a puddle after just 10 minutes in the oven. I added additional crumbs and it still melted. I was left to reform the crust after it cooked and (perhaps due to my addition, but maybe due to the recipe) it tasted like rocks. The strawberry filing also never set. I was left with strawberry soup over rocks! I also personally thought the orange rind detracted from the strawberry flavor.

My experience was similar to the Charlottesville misfortune. I followed the recipe to the letter, but the filling never firmed up and was a soupy mess. I also didn't care for the texture of the crust. I would not make this again.

I used a store bought crust, which I had on hand already, and lemon zest instead of orange zest. The pie set up nicely. I was initially worried b/c the mashed strawberries and cornstarch seemed whitish looking, but it cleared up once I added the rest of the strawberries. I cut the sugar to about 3/4 cup and added a little balsamic vinegar for additional dimension. This pie is very refreshing, the essence of strawberry, but next time I'd top with a little whipped cream or a put a thin layer of sweetened mascarpone on the bottom, with the strawberry layer on top, to add another note.

I didn't realize that I was missing a second page when I printed this recipe out. I had made everything and wondered why the recipe stopped after "... prepared pie dish". I did not mash 2 cups of strawberries. I put the corn starch, sugar, lemon juice and zest all together in the pan, heated it until it was all dissolved and mixed well. Popped the crust in the oven, took it out and put it in the fridge to cool quickly. Once the filling was done, I pulled the crust, filled it and chilled it. Hoping for the best panned out. It was great, tasty and looked beautiful. So, you can cut the time a bit and just cook it all together.

I made this for a very discerning group of women, my "cook" book group. All excellent cooks. They all really loved it. They've all made it probably multiple times since then to raves. We even made it together in Los Angeles where we gathered for our 10 year reunion. It's a wonderful recipe. The crust is the best part. You can use most fruit in it.

This was quick and easy and good. Had compliments all around. I noticed however that the pie didn't set after 4 hours in the fridge. Maybe I didn't let it thicken enough. I had it on the stove for the recommended time...That will take some trial and error I suppose, as I am new to cooking pies.

I've always been a tapioca fan when it comes to pies, so I almost passed over this recipe. It's a good thing I didn't: the cornstarch thickened without being noticeable, and the color was beautiful. My husband claimed it was the best pie ever (but he may have been flirting). Regardless, I'll certainly make it again.

Raves and more raves!!! My guest just couldn't stop the compliments and raves. What a wonderful flavor and the hint of citrus is a delicious addition! The secret to the thickening is to cook it not by time but to the desired thickness knowing it is not going to run!

This pie is delicious. I had some very tart strawberries so the sugar was just right. Dissolving the cornstarch completely in the berries/lemon juice mixture is a must. The fillng was not quite set after two hours of chilling, I would give it a good 3-4 hours in the fridge before serving next time.

I've been dying to make this ever since it was first printed and finally did! It was excellent. I took the advice of past responses with the following: 5 T butter in the crust and cut back the sugar in the filling to 3/4 C. The orange zest is such a nice touch. My family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I had no problems with either the crust or the filling, and we liked this a lot. It looks gorgeous, and was easy to make. A couple comments: followed another reviewer's advice, and cut the butter back to 5 TBS, and that worked well. The crust looked a little bubbly fresh out of the oven, but not greasy, and set up and held together well. The pie set well, too, in fact, was almost a little too "gelatiny" for me. I cut the sugar back a third, and served w/out whipped cream. Next time, I'd add more strawberries to the uncooked part, so the strawberry to cornstarch ratio would be better. And just another reminder to let the cornstarch dissolve and mix well before heating-it's key.

I thought the idea of this sounded delicious, but the crust seemed to have way too much butter in it. It just turned to a goopy mess, which I baked, but it bubbled so much because of all the butter. I tossed it and did a regular graham cracker crust. Did I do something wrong or was it supposed to look like that? I wouldn't make it again with the quantities listed.

Sooooo easy & a perfect way to use those extra strawberries you seem to have from those Buy One Get One Free deals!!! Due to a citrus allergy I left out the orange and lemon. To please the chocoholics coming to the table I lined the pie crust with a thin layer of dark chocolate. It got rave reviews! This will be an addition to our summer party menus!

I launched into this recipe and THEN read the reviews. It's sitting in my fridge right now, and I don't know if I can keep my hands off it until dinner time tonight. It set perfectly -- before I even put it in the fridge. (And I'm really not much of a baker.) I'm wondering if the folks who had trouble with the filling setting either a) cut back on the sugar or b) tried to cook it on LOW heat. My filling started to gel within a couple of minutes, and I was scraping the bottom of the pan so it wouldn't burn. When I turned the heat to low, it stopped gelling. Cook the filling on medium or medium high -- with all the sugar -- and see how that works. As far as the crust, it too is fabulous, though will undoubtedly be a mess when I serve it. I found that the recipe is a little scant and would increase all the ingredients proportionally to make a thicker, more generous crust.

Very good for Easter dessert. I made a bit more crust than recipe stated. Strawberry filling turned out fine. I mixed melted white chocolate in the whipped cream. Yum.

I followed the recipe exactly and had no problem with the pie setting up. I did three things to make sure it set: 1) dissolve the cornstarch mixture in the crushed berries before heating; 2) cut the remaining berries in quarters only and drain well; and 3) mix in quartered berries with the glaze only after it has been thoroughly cooled. The crust is easy and fantastic, but I wish I had tasted the berries before adding so much sugar. Although the unsweetened whipped cream did cut the filling's sweetness, next time I will reduce the sugar.

This was absolutely delicious, but it really did fall apart completely. A fabulous dish to make for family, but not something i would present at a formal dinner.

I have made this pie many times, once with a macaroon crust for Passover! I learned from experience that if you cut the strawberry pieces too small (smaller than just quartered) it leeches too much liquid and it gets soupy and never sets. I have some fresh strawberries right now that are very juicy, and will only halve some because of this. For the cook who had the soupy pie problem, try it again, it is worth making!

I made this pie once a week all last summer. I just used a pre-made graham cracker crust. I also prepared the filling in the microwave on high and stirred every two minutes until thick. Put saran wrap on top until cool. This is a great pie!

I made this for a "girls' night in" party that we have once a month. I am usually the good cook in the group, but this recipe didn't help me out at all. I cooked the filling until it was pretty thick, but once served, it just oozed all over the place. The crust didn't hold together nicely, either. So I ended up with a pile of strawberries and crust crumble on everyone's plate. The flavor was nice, but not worth the poor presentation...strawberries would have been put to better use in a stawberry shortcake with buttermilk biscuits (also on this site..very good).

I made this pie this past weekend. The crust was easy and tasted great, but there wasn't enough of it for my 9-inch pie pan. I would suggest making more of it. The filling never solidified. I cooked it for quite awhile, then put it in the fridge for six hours, but still no luck. I added the whipped cream...it all TASTED great, but looked HORRIBLE. It was very soupy. I will try to make this again because it was a hit, but does anyone have any suggestions?

Made this for Mother's Day 2003. It was great. I never thought I would like the combination of strawberry-almond as much as I did. I'm looking for another occasion to make this. Everyone at my table was impressed.

After incorporating several of the suggestions in the other reviews, I tried this one out. I cooked the heck out of it in order to make sure the pie actually set, cut back on the sugar a bit. The pie did not set, and it was way too sweet. The crust was pretty good, if perhaps overly rich, and the filling good, except a complete mess and too sweet. Will perhaps try it again with half the sugar called for, and likely will try the gelatin suggestions.

I think this recipe is FABULOUS!! I've been making this pie at least once a week lately (especially because it's strawberry season here in western New York). Everyone loves it! I make it for all the parties I have with my friends and the parties with my family. The crust is wonderful and even if you don't have almonds, just use any kind of nut (or a mixture). It tastes wonderful no matter what you do with it!

OK, I admit that I decided that I had to make this mostly because of all the "complaints". I just didn't see how this could be that flawed a recipe! I still don't see how so many had problems. The crust was a breeze (my only complaint is the quantity: I actually used a 10" pan, and it was perfect). The strawberry mixture thickened just fine (do you all know that you need to dissolve the cornstarch first, and then stir while cooking until thick? Just like lemon meringue pie). The flavor (as written) is wonderful. The only change(s) I'll make when I make this again (and I will), will be to double the strawberry mixture (Partly because the crust was perfect for the larger pan, partly because it's so good!), and only offer the whipped cream on the side. Everyone agreed that it would be better without the whipped cream on top. A great, easy, make-ahead summer dessert.

The strawberries were delicious-- I will definitely make them that way in the future. And you can't go wrong with whipped cream on top of those berries. But the crust was runny (too much butter, as a previous reviewer stated) and the flavor (in my opinion) didn't taste that great with the berries. I think I will stick with a graham cracker crust in the future.

I've made this pie a few times already. Some tips: Make sure you dissolve the sugar and cornstarch in the strawberries before you put any heat to the mixture. I actually pulsed the mixture in my food processor before I poured it into a saucepan. I've never had a problem with the mixture setting, but that's because I've cooked it until it was very thick. Taste your berries before deciding on how much sugar you add--if your berries are very sweet, then cut the sugar in half. I also cut back on the orange zest--the original amount is too much. I noticed that there's a little too much butter in the crust. I've knocked it down to 5 tablespoons instead of 6.

Even though my filling didn't congeal either, this pie was excellent and got rave reviews from all who tasted. The crust is delicious...I let the crust AND the strawberry filling refrigerate overnight...I added the three cups of strawberries and ONE tsp. orange peel in the morning and poured it into the shell. We ate it about 12 hours later. I served it in bowls, as another reviewer suggested. The next day it was much more firm, yet not as firm as in the picture. Next time I will definitely cook the mixture longer and maybe let it refrigerate for a full day before serving.

This was really delicious and I had no problems. The secret is to not use more than 2 cups of the berries to crush and not to crush them too fine. Cook the mixture at high enough heat to thicken in the three minutes. Don't over-stir or over-cook it and stir in the lemon juice after it is thickened. If it isn't thick when it is ready to put in the pie shell, it won't thicken. A tip, if the berries are various sizes, use the largest to crush and save the smaller ones to quarter. There is another recipe on this site that is very similar called No-bake Fresh Fruit Pie. Worth checking out and is excellent using blueberries.

To the cook from NJ: Do you honestly think BA and Gourmet do not test recipes before publishing? Perhaos the instructions should be more detailed or clear, since so many people are having trouble making the filling correctly, but BA does extensive test-kitche work before publishing recipes. Doesn't mean you or I will find the recipes foolproof or even good, but they test recipes much more extensively than most cookbook recipes are tested.

I thought this recipe was fabulous and had absolutely no problems. I have to admit that I was in a hurry so I used a store-bought graham cracker crust (I know, shame on me). The citrus taste was a bit strong the first day, but by the next morning the flavors had more time to blend and the pie was fabulous. The consistency was fabulous and I had no problems. I can't wait to make this again as a warm-weather treat!

Like almost everyone else here, my pie turned out really watery - I poured liquid out of it at least 5 times. IMHO, these recipes need to be made in a test kitchen before publishing them in BA. However, what this dessert lacked in appearance it more than made up in flavor - everyone loved it!

I followed reviewers advice and cut back on the sugar and added gelatin after I cooked (AND cooked!) the berry and cornstarch mixture. The pie setup beautifully and was delicious. I must admit -- I gilded the lily. Had wanted to make the Lemon Layer Cake with the Lemon Curd and Mascarpone but didn't have time so I took a jar of Trader Joe's Lemon Curd, added it to the whipped cream along with 8oz. mascarpone & served a dollop of this mixture on each pie serving. The best of two recipes!

HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! Where to even start. 1/4 cup of corn starch is Way too much. My pie looked like someone sneezed on it! The crust while delicious before the filling was put in it got completely soggy once the filling went in. I tried to cut a piece but it completely fell apart. It didn't even taste good. I have never had to write a bad review before but I am so disgusted by this recipe. What a waste!

I thought this sounded like a wonderful way to use fresh strawberries, and made the crust with no bother. I cooked the filling according to the recipe but let it cook considerably longer than the stated time. Did everything else as called for except reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and added more lemon juice. I used the zest from a whole large orange. I waited and waited for it to set. Every time I checked the pie in the fridge, it was swimming in liquid, which I poured out. I did this three times, and considered not using it for my six friends coming for dessert, but thought what the heck, I'll just serve it in bowls with the whipped cream on the side. Everyone raved and loved the flavor. Next time I'll put in some gelatin.

I found the addition of the orange peel in the feeling gave an overwhelming and unpleasant taste of orange in what is supposed to be a strawberry, not orange, pie. Maybe its just me, but even with cutting the amount of orange peel down to one half, I still did not like it. I had no problem with the filling setting up, but did find that you had to cook it far longer than instructed to get it to the desired state, just like almost every other recipe I have every tried.

I rated this recipe low but said I would cook it again because it has great potential. Whoever thought of combining toasted almond crust with strawberries is nothing less than a hedonistic genius. But the consistancy of both the filling and the crust tells me that the recipe needs some fine-tuning. The crust turned out to be a giant hard cookie for more than one of us on this site. And the filling is just too thin and soupy. A Strawberry Pie without using Gelatin: noble attmept, but I'm going back to gelatin. And by the way - the men I baked this for don't care about fine-tuning, they loved it and it lasted less than 24 hours in my kitchen.

I made this for my husband's birthday, and we both really enjoyed it ... as a vegetarian, I was happy to find a strawberry pie recipe that doesn't use gelatin. The filling didn't set for me either, but I suspected that I simply didn't cook it long enough, and the other comments verify my mistake (so I cannot hold it against the recipe). The crust was fantastic, nutty and chewy and yummy. It made the pie far more substantial than I expect strawberry pie to be, so be aware. BUT, it was so yummy. It would make a great crust for chocolate pie as well. Mmmm. Gonna have to try that soon!

What did I do wrong with the crust that it had flattened into a greasy cookie when I took it out of the oven? I quickly crushed some more graham crackers and was able to salvage it; tasted OK but the texture was closer to rock than crust.

Just made this dessert for Easter dinner and thought it was excellent. I didn't have any trouble and am not sure what people mean by "setting." Are you guys doing it right? You need to cook the glaze until it gets quite thick. The thickening happens during cooking, not afterwards in the fridge. We're talking cornstarch here, not gelatin. I put two tablespoons of Grand Marnier in the whipped cream and that was yummy. Another time I will not use toasted almonds but will make a plain graham cracker crust. Both my husband and I thought the flavor was overpowering and did not match the strawberries. The first thing he said was "Does this have peanut butter in it?" With that said, this is a great recipe, and I'm looking forward to an encore on the 4th of July.

I made this for dessert after Easter dinner and adults and children both liked it. I didn't have trouble getting it to set, but I did cook it a little longer. Also, I didn't put the graham cracker/almond mixture in the food processor, so I had bigger chunks of almond which gave the crust a nice crunchy texture.

My family loved it. I read reviews before making it and added one and a half packets of unflavored gelitan softened in 1 to 2 tablespoons of water into the hot strawberries. And wated until the strawberries were completely cool before adding the rest of the strawerries. Make this the day or night before it sets nicely with more time.

Great strawberry flavor! I cut the sugar in half because I served it to my diabetic dad, and I thought it was perfect - if I used the stated amountin the recipe it would have been way too sweet.
