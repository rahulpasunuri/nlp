I made this tonight for dinner. It was ok. The shoulder chops I used were far too sinewy, which has nothing to do with the recipe, but there you are. I would recommend removing the bones from the chops before saute-ing them. Otherwise, expect to pan fry them for at least five minutes per side, even 6 if you want them done medium. All things considered, I've made better lamb chop recipes than this one.

I purchased my shoulder chops from Whole Foods and perhaps they were thicker than most but 2 minutes on each side was raw not medium rare. I threw them back in and about 3 additional minutes gave me the pink in the center medium rare.

Made this last night and it was delicious, tasted like spring ! I followed the other reviewers advice and drained the yogurt for about 3 hours. Will definitely make this again. I served this with the roasted-garlic asparagus ( I cheated and added julienne carrots in with it.)

Certainly couldn't be easier and if you like southern Med. foods there is lots that works well as a side.

I've made this recipe several times because it's easy and delicious. Be sure to make the yogurt sauce and definitely strain the yogurt for a thicker, creamier sauce (it's easy). I serve it with either a cucumber and tomato salad.

My husband who was born and raised in Lebanon LOVED this dish. It was decptively easy to prepare and the cost of lamb shoulder chops also makes it very economical. That said, it looks and tastes fantastic. I prepared it with Potatoes Roasted with Olive oil and Bay Leaves. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent. I marinated the lamb for about an hour. The yogurt was so nice that we didn't even need the boiled marinade. Next time will make with Saffron couscous with peas & chives (this site) and marinated cucumbers for a "mediterranean" meal.

Though we would normally grill our lamb chops, with sub-zero weather we decided to try this preparation and found it very flavorful. I didn't have fresh mint, but substituted cilantro in the yogurt sauce . . . I really think I would prefer the freshness of mint.

Delish! I marinated the chops for around 30 minutes per side, since I was doing other things, and grilled them while cooking the marinade on the stove. I spooned the marinade on the done chops and served the yogurt on the side. Even the skeptic in the group, who didn't think the yogurt sauce sounded good and preferred to make a wine sauce instead, ate every last bite and loved it. Served it with rice pilaf and a fresh tomato and cucumber salad with mint. Terrific dish.

I skipped the yogurt sauce. The marinade for the lamb was good, although next time I would marinate it longer for more flover.

I used loin chops. I blended the sauce and served it on the side as a dipping sauce. Both my husband and I thought it was delicious. It was also very easy.

I used the marinade for shish kebab cubes cut from leg of lamb. I drained the yogurt (whole milk) for about two hours, using a paper coffee filter. The texture was worth the wait. The yogurt I use is either Brown Cow or Stoney Brook Farms, available in health food stores and some progressive grocery stores. For those with leftover sauce who are unsure what to do with it, it makes an excellent dip for pita or Middle Eastern flat bread. The marinade, while not unusual, is very good. If marinating longer than the 20 minutes called for, adding the lemon juice later in the procedure is a good idea because the juice tends to make meat mushy.

I thought this was a great recipe although I was left with a bucket of unused yogurt sauce :-)I also went overboard a bit and let the lamb marinate almost 12 hours, with terrific results.

The lemon and garlic combination was a nice enhancement to the flavor of the lamb chops. I marinated the lamb for about 2 hours. Next time I might try a different and fresh herb in the marinade. Not that the dried oregano wasn't good, the lemon garlic just seemed like it would combine well with other herbs as well. I didn't make the yogurt sauce.

So good. The rib and loin lamb chops we have from the lamb we purchased are 1" thick so we sautéed them for 4 min./side. After the first try at this recipe, we've passed on the yogurt sauce and use our mint sauce instead.

A very quick and easy dish that tastes fantastic, although we added a dash of Shiraz to the marinade.

So good and so easy to make. I didn't have yogurt or fresh mint on hand, so I used sour cream and dried mint instead and it was delicious!

Yummy. I use rosemary and these were just scrumptious. However, I allowed 2 or 3 chops per person. Didn't make the yougurt sauce.

I agree with the last poster about draining the Yogurt. It is also called Yogurt Cheese. Rather than using cheese cloth I used a strainer lined with a coffee filter, an excellent substitute. Yes you need to allow it to drain for several hours. Served it with Dijon Mustard Mashed Potatoes and Corn on the Cob. Nice balance of flavors.

I haven't made the dish, but I can tell you why they said to strain the yogurt... you want a thicker, more sour cream-like substance. We call it Lebni...but it really needs longer than 20 minutes...several hours at least (overnight would actually be ideal).

I modified this recipe alittle by making kebabs instead of lamb chops, and marinading the meat before grilling... Yum! Served it with herbed rice and roasted asparagus; it was a hit! I agree with the others, I didn't see a reason for draining the yogurt- it didn't work for me!

Enjoyed this recipe, easy to prepare but could not understand why I had to sieve the yogurt? any help here?. Our lamb chops must be different to American lamb chops , the recipe calls for one chop per person! Ours from small young lambs, requires about 5or six per person. Will do it again though. The sauteed fennel and carrot was super and complimented the dish very well.
