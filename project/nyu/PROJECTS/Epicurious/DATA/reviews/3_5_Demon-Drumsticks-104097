I couldn't get past the smell, this was not a good recipe for my husband and me. My husband who eats almost anything couldn't get into this

This is definitely a keeper. We had my parents and grandparents over for dinner, and they loved it and said these were the best drumsticks they had ever tasted. I only marinated the drumsticks for about 10 minutes with Dale's marinade (doesn't take long), then proceeded with the rest of the recipe but used Italian breadcrumbs instead of making my own. Very tasty!

I too was very disappointed with this receipe. Mediocre at best and I won't be making it again.

My finicky four year old loved these so much, he wants me to keep some in the fridge all the time for lunch or whenever we're having "grownup food". He even likes them cold! I did cheat a bit, modifying the prep. I've always had a problem with just baking chicken drumsticks...seems like I always end up with overbrowned exterior and still have red meat on the bone. ICK! So I marinated these, but then boiled them with a little water added to the marinate, for 30 minutes before breading them and finishing in the oven. The result is thoroughly cooked, jucier than baked-only drumsticks, with a perfectly browned crunch on the outside. And boiling in the marinade, really sets the marinate flavor. Double bonus! I guess I'm making these again...for life, or until he turns 5 and finds a new fave.

I was utterly disappointed with this recipe. It was mediocre, at best. The flavor combinations were strange (soy sauce and dijon mustard) and didn't blend well. I certainly wouldn't make this again!

This dish was very good but now WOW, so I didnt give it a 4. I didn't have enough drumsticks so I did 1/2 thigh, and IMO, the thighs were better because the skin comes out very crisp and crunchy. I also just used store-bought Italian bread crumbs since I had it on hand. Got lots of compliments. Would definitely make it again.

This is a favorite with the whole family - a great kid pleaser. I marinate the drumsticks and then freeze them so I can pull a batch out for a quick weeknight dinner.

Delicious! I made it exactly as said the first time but only marinated for 1 hour and it tasted great, we all wanted more. The second time, I added cayenne pepper and it was really really good. It's an easy dish to make if you're out of ideas for dinner.

Read the reviews, and modified the recipe-I used onion salt (3 tbsp) and garlic powder (2 tbsp) instead of manually putting in the chopped onion and garlic. I added extra soy sauce as well. I found the first time I made the chicken, too much liquid to mustard was used prior to coating the chicken with the breadcrumbs, so I only put in dab of chicken broth to the dijon mustard, so instead of the liquid being so thin, it was a slightly runny paste consistentcy. Also, to cut down on the whole bread crumb stuff, I substituted the bread crumbs for italian style crumbs (which can be bought at the store). In addition, I also found out that when baking, the temp was too high, I decreased it to 350C for the time, then broiled for 2 min to brown at the end. In the end, this was a fancy shake and bake chicken, but everytime I have made this everyone has finished it, and there are never any leftovers. I have made this several times, and when substituting in the above, it is a lot faster as well. Will make again!

I tried the recipe last night on a crowd of different nationalities (6 to be exact) and they all had more than one piece. I added a few drops of Tabasco in the marinade. It even tasted nice cold today for lunch. Thanks

This was a bit hit at our Halloween party with both kids and adults. Definitely will make for a fall party again.

Sure I would do it again but I would simplify the recipe. For the work it involved you don't really taste the flavors of the marinade. But it's a nice recipe the kids liked.
