Definitely cook the quinoa in chicken stock (NOT WATER). Makes a great side dish on it's own, but needs a few cloves of chopped garlic and a couple more limes or lemons worth of juice. As for the garlic sauce, I recommend doubling the # of roasted garlic heads, or halving the amount of oil and stock used. Otherwise, the sauce ends up being VERY runny/liquidy and not looking half as pretty as the picture. The sauce is relatively flavorless as described. Back to the quinoa recipe by itself: go ahead and make the garlic sauce, and toss it into the quinoa. Dramatic positive difference...

Wow, this was good! The garlic sauce was mellow but delicious. I will definitely be making this again. This is a good recipe to impress guests with.

I made this last night - I just had two filets so I cut the sauce recipe in half and that was plenty. My husband went crazy over the sauce! Here's a suggestion - pour most of the sauce over the meat - save some to dip crusty bread into - amazing! (Didn't make the quinoa-maybe another time).

I made this last night - I just had two filets so I cut the sauce recipe in 1/2 and that was plenty. My husband went crazy over the sauce. Here's a suggestion - pour most of the sauce over the steaks - then save the rest to dip some crusty bread into - that is amazing! (Did not make the quinoa).

My fmily isn't much on beef so I made this with grilled Chicken and added chantrells to the sauce. The combo was much lighter and delicious! The quinoa recipe was by far one of the best I've had in a while. My family asks for this, gotta love that!

I served this for a New Year's dinner 2-3 years ago. I'm surprised I had not rated the recipe. I wanted to address a couple of comments. Do you want to waste 2 cups of milk. First, if you are serving a meat of this quality, two cups of milk are like water. Yes, you do want to use the milk. In fact, I loved it so much, I use this method to make potatoes dauphinois. I digress...the sauce is perfect and does not overpower the meet. The quionoa (separate recipe)was superb. Wonderful texture, very flavorful. I did have a hard time finding the orange/yellow tomatoes, but track them down I did. The flavors were nicely balanced and I loved introducing my guests (and myself) to this unique, underutilized grain. This year, I'm trying the tenderloin with zinfandel glazed shallots. I'll post a report on that.

The Garlic sauce is fantastic. My family requests this every Xmas. Havent made the tomato quinoa yet, but the tenderloin and sauce is the best ever

Made this for four people for my Mom's birthday. There was no meat left over- just enough. The recipe seemed to make 2x the garlic sauce and quinoa. Made the garlic sauce the night before. Not a difficult recipe but looked wonderful on the plate.

I LOVE this dish and cook it often. We've shared this meal with many guests and everyone has agreed the garlic sauce is awesome and quinoa is a great side dish and easy to cook with. Highly, highly recommend!

Fantastic small group dinner. Got nothing but raves.

This was a great meal. Couscous is really a very poor substitute. Quinoa is a great grain. The dish has a great cruchy texture. The garlic sauce is terrific with the tenderloin. Needs lots of salt to bring out all the flavours...don't skimp.

I served this dinner last week and found it easy to make, great tasting, and well received by my guests. The only thing I changes was that i also served asparagus with the meal and finished with a flourless chocolate cake w/a cabernet/blackberry sorbet. My additional thoughts are that it was great to have a meal that was rich but not so heavy that you felt unable to move after dinner. I will absolutely add this to my regular meals for guests.

I thought this was a nice tenderloin dish. As far as steeping the garlic heads, it does mellow the flavor of the garlic. In addition, I found that after roasting, the "pre-soaked" heads meant that the garlic skins (paper) was not as brittle or crumbly, so it was easy to just squeeze out the garlic without all that paper falling apart. Side note: I find roasted garlic to be an excellent emulsifier for vinaigrettes, etc., and serves as a fantastic thickening agent for other pan and reduction sauces.

I really liked the idea of steeping the garlic in the milk. It's a roasted garlic sauce, but really garlic is the only thing in the sauce. I thought it was too strong on its own, but absolutely perfect with the tenderloin - one of those matches that makes you sit up and go wow. But if it hadn't steeped in milk, I think the garlic sauce would have been way overpowering, even if roasting it mellows it. I plan on making this meal many times, though perhaps with couscous instead of quinoa. Not that I don't like quinoa, it's just couscous is a little easier to make.

This dish needed some "fixin". I added the pureed garlic mixture to chopped shallots and shitake mushrooms that had been sauteed in 1/4 c oil and 1/4 c butter. Add 1 can chicken broth and 1/4 c. ruby port and reduced (do this twice). Add 1/4 c heavy cream and season to taste. (Kick it up a notch by adding wasabi). I've served this over tenderloin and thick, grilled veal chops. Yummy!

The milk helps deadn' the pungency of the garlic. It milds the flavor/aroma a bit.

I'm with the cook from Seattle. Does anyone know why we waste 2 cups of milk to make roasted garlic? (Since roasting mellows the flavor so much to begin with, I question the need to reduce the pungency first) Please, someone give us an actual review of the recipe!

I just read 7 reviews and not one person actually said if this was a good recipe or not. Can someone who has actually tried this recipe rate it?

russell from oakland: despite the fact that the a's are up 2-0 on the sox i'll help you out. there is another recipe for tenderloin at the site that is one of if not the best meat dish you could make. something like herb roasted tenderloin with wine shallot sauce(that might not be exactly the title but it's in the ballpark)

Gee, I don't know....This recipe just doesn't sound good. Tenderloin of beef is just too expensive to experiment with and be less than pleased with the results. Any brave souls?

Generally, low salt broth means from a pre-packaged version (a can?) While stock means the slow cooked method. Arguably, there are some pre-packaged "stocks" which will suffice found in at least some supermarkets here in the USA. I would assume most store bought stocks are well salted and that is what this recipe is trying to avoid. As for the milk, that would have the affect of reducing the pungency of the garlic.

I have not tried this yet, but I am curious as to why the garlic is simmered in milk prior to roasting. Anyone know why this is done? Does it change the flavor of roasted garlic?

Rating: 0
Will chicken stock do instead of broth? (or are they the same in USA?) And I wonder how well the recipe would work for pork tenderloin
