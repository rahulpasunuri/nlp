ok...kind of fun to make...seems like it should be interesting it is easy certainly... just found it a bit boring... I would definitely not make the Berry Sauce...fresh berries would have been better and prettier.

I doubled the recipe and took it to a friends bridal shower. I did not have the ability to make the berry sauce, although it looks easy enough. My one issue is that getting the vanilla wafer cookies ground down can be a hassle if you don't have a food processor. I called them "Deconstructed Mini Cheesecakes" and everyone thought they were delicious. Using the Nilla wafers really brought back good childhood memories!

I've been using this for my 'basic' cheesecake recipe for a couple of years now, everyone loves it. It's easy to adapt to different crusts and flavors. I've used the berry sauce recipe with different berries, also. Adding a little lemon or orange peel and a dash of nutmeg to the cake and using blackberries is amazing.

I made the sauce to go with a Lemon curd Marbled Cheesecake. It was amazing! I won a dessert contest with this recipe! I would suggest taking the blueberry skins out of the sauce before serving the sauce. It looks much more elegant that way!

I made these in muffins tins and they came out great! In response to previous reviews, I used graham cracker crumbs and doubled the vanilla to get a little extra flavor. I used about 1 Tbsp of the crumb mixture in each tin and filled each to the top with the cheesecake miture; this worked out because they didn't overflow, but they were full enough so that they didn't sink in the middle upon cooling. It ended up making about 17 cheesecakes and instead of using a waterbath I just filled the 7 empty tins with boiling water. I baked them for 23 minutes exactly, by which time a few had cracked a little but once cooled they looked fine.

Used the berry sauce to pour over pound cake for a quick dessert - it was horrible and such a waste of delicious berries! It was too sweet, too goopy and just ugly. Yuck...

Yawn. The cheesecakes would not unmold from the cups. I served them, gouged out onto the plates, with my own raspberry sauce and the general effect was that of road kill. The flavor was just cream cheese rich, without anything to recommend it.

Good for small bite size desserts for a cocktail party etc. 1/2 of recipe is about right for 24 mini-muffin cups. Bake approx 40 minutes and top with fresh raspberry or blueberry

Definitely delicious. I had no problems with the centers sinking or the flavor, and I made some to save for the next day (I didn't put the sauce on top so they'd keep better.) My husband said they were better the next day than the first (he re-heated the sauce). I had a slight problem with the raspberries disintegrating quickly in the berry sauce, but I think I left them in too long or I might strain the sauce next time. Otherwise, they were fantastic and so easy!

This is a no-fail recipe. I've made these in mini-muffin tins and they work so well.

While I didnt make the cheesecake, I made the mixed-berry sauce for ice cream. Everyone absolutely loved it and had me make more. Will definitely try the cheesecake soon!

I only made the sauce, for another cheese cake. It was outstanding and very easy. It turned ordinary into special. I will save to use as my staple dessert sauce.

For the cook in NJ, the only problem I had with sinking centers was in the batch that I overbaked a bit. The rest I baked until just set and they were perfect. I was concerned about the review that said the cheesecake lacked flavor, so I added 1/4 t almond extract,I thought it might be a mistake to do this before I even tried it....but it was so delish that I will make them that way every time. I also used the muffin tin idea with foil liners and I got 24 cheese cakes using one rounded T of crumb mixture and filling 2/3 full w/ cheese mixture. Try putting the filling in a zip lock bag and filling the cups pastry bag style. Makes quick clean work of it. Also, I had fresh berries on hand but no liqeur so I just coated the berries with "melted" jam before topping the cheesecakes. yum. easiest impressive looking desert I've ever made!

I liked the consistency of these cheesecakes, however there was not a lot of flavor. I would recommend using more vanilla, and I used a graham cracker crust with aromatic spices.

I made a batch of the mini cheesecakes and found that the centers of the cheesecakes sank quite a bit. I used a water bath and also used cupcake liners in muffin tins. I think the problem was that i filled the liners too high and when they sank, the edges got caught on the fluted liners resulting in the centers really sinking low. I was wondering if anyone else had any input and tips on how to avoid this in the future. The taste was wonderful and definitely plan to make them again.

I made this for a bday party and though I'm not a cheesecake fan, everyone loved it. I made this in regular muffin pans and easily got 12 cakes. Also used 2 tbsp vs 3 of shortbread mix - in foil cups 3 leaves little room for cheesecake mixture. This still left me with extra shortbread mix; would probably reduce by 1/3 next time. Berry sauce was excellent but again, would reduce by 1/2 since it's just way too much for the small cakes.

Made this for a Christmas Party for 20 that I catered. It was delicious! We used Christmas paper liners with a foil liner inside of the paper so the crust would stick. Bought the mixed frozen berries from Costco and substituted the very costly Chambord with Mathilde Framboise liqueur. Turned out great, many compliments & requests for this recipe.

For the cook from Toronto - yes, you would need to use a water bath. It helps to regulate the temp around the cheesecakes and the added steam helps to prevent cracking

If I use a muffin tin, do I still need to do a water bath? (Thank you for reading this!)

Instead of the custard cups you can use a muffin tin with liners. Once the cakes are room temp simply peel off the paper. Or line the custard cups with muffin liners. Either way works plus you get a fancy fluted edge to them.

Delicious!

This is a classic recipe I learned about a long time ago from a college professor who often gave large parties. A very easy simplification of this recipe is to: 1) use paper muffin cup liners and bake in muffin tins, lightly spraying the liners with cooking spray, and 2) place the vanilla wafer, uncrushed, in the bottom of the liner before pouring in the batter. My friend would make literally hundreds at a time and fill her deep-freezer with them, and always had a delicious dessert ready at a moment's notice, even for a crowd of hungry students.

Next time try dipping the cups into a hot water bath to loosen them up a bit right before serving.

The flavor of the cheesecake was delicious, but they don't come out of the ramekins. There must be more to prepping the dishes than buttering. They are good enough to keep experimenting, though. Also, they are okay the second day, but best the day they're made. If anybody tries them and can get them out in one piece, please say how!
