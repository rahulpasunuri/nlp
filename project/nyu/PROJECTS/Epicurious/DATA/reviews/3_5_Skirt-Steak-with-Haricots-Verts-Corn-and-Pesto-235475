I made this recipe so easily with some help from Trader Joe. I sauteed a flank steak in a cast iron pan for about 5 minutes, removed it and threw in a few handfuls of TJ frozen roasted corn, while cooking a bag of prewashed haricots verts in the microwave. Then added them to the pan with the corn, then added some jarred TJ pesto, Meanwhile sliced up the steak and finding it undercooked threw the slices back in the pan, where the residual heat finished them perfectly. Served it right from the cast iron fry pan.

Loved the combo of the pesto, haricot verts, and corn! The skirt steak however just didn't do it for me. So, like many of the other reviewers, I will use another cut the next time around.

Prepared this with a cut the butcher called Sirloin for Fajitas. Cooked the meat on the grill and everybody loved it.

Really good, really easy. Make it now while corn is at peak season. I added 2 ears' worth of corn. Delish!

I'm not a big fan of skirt steak, so next time I make this recipe I'll use a different cut of beef. Other than that, the flavors meld well together (I added a few halved cherry tomatoes to the corn/haricots verts mix for some added color).

A very easy and tasty weeknight dinner. The corn, green bean combo with pesto is yummy. And, the skirt steak is simple but good...be sure to trim it pretty well first though. I used a cast iron grill pan to get some nice flavor.

Quick and easy. A real crowd pleaser.

Okay, I didn't do the recipe EXACTLY as called for, but it still turned out well! I ended up using frozen white corn and frozen haricot verts and I didn't end up using the pesto...just salt and pepper and the taste was really good. The meal was simple and relatively inexpensive to make. I like meat so this was a good choice for two people...plus you can add more veggies if you need to.

A nice mix of ingredients i would not have thought of. Corn and green beans are in season so it was very fresh. I agree to use more corn. In fact you can't use enough corn! I would say this dish is more for 2 or 3, not 4. Watch the fatyness of the meat.

This was great - very nice presentation, great flavors, and best of all, very easy. I used 2 ears of corn and 1/2# of regular green beans - the proportions seemed perfect for a dinner for 2.

I agree with the idea to use more corn. This is a typical steak dish like those I find throughout Latin America. It is easy, quick, and delicious.

I liked the veggies more than the meat & agree with the previous poster that more corn is a good idea. I'm not a huge beef fan, so this opinion might just be mine, but skirt steak is pretty low-grade & has too much gristle.
