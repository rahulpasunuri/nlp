Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, making the syrup and lime mixture in the evening. The following morning I froze it in my ice cream maker and let it sit in the freezer for the day to serve at that evening's dinner for desert. It was perfect, I had no issues with the texture or consistency. I'm making it again for tonight!

This is a great recipe. I didn't add the triple sec or tequila until I had chilled the lime juice mixture. Seemed silly to put that much alcohol in something and then boil it right off. At any rate this was the favorite of the 3 fruit sorbets I made. I will definitely make this again. In fact the request for the 4th of July is to make all 3 the margarita sorbet.

Easy to make and very good. "Lightweights" may feel the effects of the alcohol, but it really does taste like a margarita. Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

The recipe worked very well. The flavor was perfect and it froze properly. I feel however that It couldbe improved by removing the plainlime zest and substituting candies lime peel.

I also didn't have it frozen in time for a bbq I had this past weekend but my husband and I had it the next day. The flavor is perfect, very refreshing on a hot day. The texture could have been smoother but it's definitely worth making again.

Ever since Hagen-Daaz stopped making their margarita sorbet, my family has been looking for a replacement. When I found this last night, I decided to make it for my father's birthday today. Unfortunately a disaster with an ancient ice cream maker kept it from freezing in time for dessert. Everyone still loved the slush so much that they all want the recipe now. I would definitely start this one at least a day in advance just in case the freezing techniques decide not to work. A deliciously tart palette cleanser!

Served this for dessert on Cinco de Mayo -- very refreshing and easy to make. Nicely tart - it would be perfect on a hot summer day.

Very tasty and refreshing. Dilute with a little water to make a weak frozen margarita.
