Simple and delicious. I'm usually a little scared to use cumin as it smells so powerful, but this was great. Enjoyed it without the tortilla and a just a side salad.

The sauce was delicious! I cooked my steak on the grill and added some cubanelle peppers to the sauce but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Can't really go wrong with cilantro and tomatoes!

Wow, this is an amazing recipe! So easy, with so much flavor! I grilled the steak, and sauteed the garlic, tomatoes and cilantro separately, and it still tasted great! My husband and 11 year old fought over it! Definitely the tastiest summer steak recipe I have come across! Also fancy enough for guests, can't wait to make it for friends!

Wow! I'm not a huge fan of cooking steak in a pan (we like to grill), but this was great! The sauce was fabulous and the steak was flavorful and surprisingly tender. I put the rub on about three hours before cooking and also added Adobo seasoning to the seasonings in the recipe. Served with black beans and rice - perfect!

The steak was great, but the sauce was exceptional. I would make this again in a heartbeat. Served with tortillas and salsa, and it was just dynamite.

Awesome!! My husband and I loved it, I'll add it to my regular repetoir. I deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth before adding the tomatoes. Served dinner with roasted asparagus and pepperjack polenta. loved it--so quick and easy!

We just finished eating and we were very impressed. We did not have tomatoes so we used canned diced tomatoes and did not fully drain them. We also used minced garlic instead of sliced. It still turned out great. This is a very easy recipe to make and it is delicious.

Very easy, I did add more tomatoes though for more sauce (3 plum). I served it with the Avocado and white bean salsa found on this web site. A nice quick dinner for a busy night!

This steak can be kicked up quite a notch if it was marinated in a lime based marinade first.

Taste was above average (the reason for three forks) but hold for the "quick meal" area of your index. A bit of a southern "south of the border" flavor is enjoyed in the southern states if you have company over from the south. I halved the cilantro and added yellow peppers for taste and preasentation.

This was fast, easy, and tasty. I even used London Broil. The spices made a dark edge, esp. when broiling it to med rare. I also used double the spices for the rub. Great recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I used farmer's market tomatoes. Didn't bother to seed them. It was alittle liquidity but the taste was outstanding. I recommend this recipe. It's quick and soooo good.

Quick and easy and minimal ingredients. My husband loved it and said it was a keeper. The only difference is I used Sun-dried tomato Lawash instead of Flour Tortillas. It was awesome!!!!

Oh boy... Was this ever good! I just happened to have all the ingredients and was in a bit late to start dinner and on top of that I was totally bored with cooking!! This dish was so easy and incredibly different and delicious. I followed previous reviewer's advice and was generous with the cumin powder. Also, I didn't have the chili powder but I did have a chinese chili garlic oil in the fridge so I used that. It made a gorgeous glaze! We ate it with flour tortillas, refried beans, lime and tomato/salad type garnish. I can understand where this combo would be wonderful on chicken as well.

My wife and thought that this was delicious and very easy to make. If you like the combination of cilantro and tomatoes, you can't go wrong with this recipe. You could easily substitute other meats in place of the beef.

YUM! This is delicious and incredibly easy and fast. I doubled the amounts of cumin and chili powder, I didn't think the 1/2 teaspoons of each went far enough. I used Spice Hunter Ancho Chile Powder, which had a little extra kick. Also cut the olive oil by a tablespoon and only seeded one tomato. I think the seeds and pulp helped to make for saucier sauce. Just wonderful! I'll make again for sure. Also, I had a Kendall Jackson Collage Cab Sav-Syrah blend with this, which went great. (Much better with the steak than on its own, I might add.) It's a good "summer cab."
