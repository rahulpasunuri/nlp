Very solid meal, easy and while not super quick, simple and straightforward once all ingredients are measured out. I made with boneless pork chops, and would have liked a bit more seasoning, although each bite with a bit of crumbled bacon on top was delicious!

I was wary of this as I haven't cook many pork chops but it turned out to be fairly easy. I did cook them on the stove as the comments suggested and finish the pork with a bit of the liquid from the cabbage. Served with a german potato salad in addition to the cabbage and it was an amazing dinner!

Good , I made it with half the bacon and splenda, for a lower caloric recipe. I also, just braised the chops in wine for a more tender dish.

My husband absolutely loved this dish. I used half the bacon, but otherwise followed the cabbage part exactly. It was the perfect way to use a head of purple cabbage, sweet and sour and savory all at the same time. I didn't put the pork in the oven, but used a sirloin cut instead and just put some white wine in the pan and cooked it covered on the stove top. Came out succulent. A perfect recipe!

Rather simple and bland. Would prefer a recipe with carrots potatoes, etc that might be much more interesting.

Preparation is straight forward and the taste was finely balanced. Red cabbage can be made a little ahead of time and kept as the pork chops do not take that long to cook.

This was easy and delicious. Made it right the first time. Next time I'll just pan fry the pork chops. Putting them in the oven just made them dry. The caraway seeds are what make it special. They give just a hint of flavor without being overpowering.
