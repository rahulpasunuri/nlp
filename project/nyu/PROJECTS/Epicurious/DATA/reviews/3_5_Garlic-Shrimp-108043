Great flavor, and super easy. I followed other users suggestion of using less oil. Only about 1/3 cup in the marinade, and just a tbs or 2 in the pan. I added a jalapeno pepper to the marinade, and I doubled the garlic. Yum!

Although this is very good, it uses WAY too much oil. I cut back on the marincade to 1/4 cup of oil and skipped the step of adding more to the skillet before cooking. Even with those modifications I could have reduced it more. I will for next time because there really was a lot of flavor with the other ingredients.

This was wonderful. I cooked some linguini and as the sauteed shrimp was cooked, I stirred in the cooked pasta. Served with warm seasoned bread and it made a great meal. With the pasta, we needed to add a little more salt and pepper but the flavor was great. I also used precooked shrimp and warmed it in the fry pan just until all was warm, then added the pasta.

This was fantastic! I wanted to find a new way to do garlic shrimp to serve with steak and these were excellent. I really like the technique of blending up the marinade. Delish!

Great elegant dish. I served it with a Caesar salad and garlic and oil pasta. All very simple and tasty.

I tried making this on a whim last night and it was AWESOME. If you serve it in a shallow dish with the juices it makes for a great dipping sauce as well - especially if you have crusty French bread on hand.

This simple recipe is very elegant on it's own, however you can easily enhance it by adding fresh herbs or spices. I use basil, cilantro or whatever is on hand or a cajun seasoning. Also, I double the garlic.

We all liked this, next time I'll add more salt, served over brown rice, but I agree, this would be great over pasta. I didn't marinate for a full hour, just a half, and I didn't use extra olive oil o saute either. This was so simple and delicious!

I make this on a regular basis now. My kids love it! I do not add additional olive oil to the pan to saute the shrimp. Also, it's great over pasta!

This was pretty good. I did adjust the recipe though. I added some chilli powder to the puree to add some heat, and then I sauteed some zucchini before added the marinade and the shrimp to the pan and also added lemon juice in the end. The zucchini added some nice color that this dish really needed. Plus, there was no need to add so much oil. It tasted great with half as much. My kids loved this dish and i would definately make it again, with those changes.

I loved this recipe! I would cut the salt to 3/4 tsp. and I don't think it needs all of the oil either. I will be making this again. YUM!!

This is very good, but the "shell on" business is too annoying for words. My husband works too hard all day to come home and fight with his dinner. I shell the shrimp and then feel guilty that maybe some taste has been sacrificed. Maybe I could fry the shells and reduce the sauce with them?

it´s a quick,simple but delicate gourmet recipe.

The taste is way more complex than it sounds from these few ingredients. Delicious, and I only marinated for 30 minutes. I used the frozen super collosal frozen shrimp from Trader Joe's. These amazing shrimp are already cleaned with only the tail on and taste like fresh. Used a white onion (according to Rick Bayless, this is the best kind for Mexican recipes). Used Trader Joe's Green olive oil. Served with Trader Joe's spanish rice in a box. Took the advice of other reviewers and used just 1/2 teaspoon salt, and sprinkled with red pepper flakes, lime and cilantro at the end. If we had bread, the sauce looked wonderful for dipping, but alas, we try to be limited in our carbs. So quick and easy.

I make this frequently with the MEXICAN RICE recipe on this site. Wonderful!

This is a very simple and versitile recipe. It can be dressed up or down, depending on what you have in your fridge. I omitted the onion,(not a family favorite), and served it with peas, carrotts, and peppers, over a bed of alfredo noodles. I would make this dish again because of ease of preparation and taste. A favorite.

I made it as directed (except no oil on the non-stick pan), and I really enjoyed--different from what I had expected (I had expected more of a clear sauce, rather than the thick marinade), but it was delicious. Being on a low-carb diet, I didn't make any side starch dish, and I ate the whole pound of shrimp myself. The sauce was great, and I tried to put as much of it on the shrimp as I could because it added so much great flavor. If I were going to add a starch, I would add some nice thick slices of toasted Italian bread and spread the sauce on it like butter. Be sure to give your guests gum or mints afterwards--the onions and garlic are powerful!

This was very good but alittle too messy for us. Next time I will shell the shrimp and, as other cooks have suggested, I will cut back on the oil. Also I will try adding some lemon juice and red pepper flakes as suggested. Great with rice!

I just made this again for my boyfriend. He bought a pound of pre-frozen large shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. They were the best we could find that weren't farm-raised. It is a simple-to-prepare dish and I received compliments. He ate the whole plate save for my share. I like the fact that this garlicy shrimp recipe uses no butter. It's an easy recipe -even my boyfriend could make it. Impress a date with this guys!

I love this recipe. I would add nothing, subtract nothing. I was worried the sauce would taste greasy, but it was nothing short of wonderful. The simple flavor doesn't mask the subtle sweet salty flavor of fresh shrimp. Absolutely perfect!

Delicious! I use this in a pasta dish. After marinating, I saute the shrimp for about 2 minutes, then I remove the shrimp only and set it aside. I then saute diced zucchini and tomato in the garlic oil mixture until cooked, then add the shrimp back in until heated through. Pour the whole thing over pasta and top with fresh grated parmesan ... yum!

This dish came out super well. I stuck pretty closely to the recipe but incorporated input from other reviewers - ie, the red pepper flakes and lemon juice. They really brightened up the dish. I also threw in some green onions into the pan right before sauteing the shrimp at the end, to further add color and dimension. You can't really go wrong with garlic, oil and shrimp!

Maybe I expect too much but this just wasn't special for us. Good, but certainly not great and not something I'd fix for guests. My deviations from the recipe were at the end - a big squeeze of fresh lemon over all, fresh chopped parsley, and fresh grated parmesan cheese.

This recipe was perfect--I cut back on the oil in the marinade and added some parsley while cooking as as a garnish at the end. Just perfect I served it with Cous Cous with Tomatoes and Basil

The first time I made it I followed the recipe and it was good. The second time I made it I used the same ingredients, but I added them all to the pot from the start. I added crushed red pepper at the start and sprinkled with fresh cilantro when done. It was fantastic!

Oh my my, this was excellant. I did not add any additional oil to the pan before adding the shrimp with the marinade and it was just perfect. I served it with a Thai rice mix I had in the house and it was just yummy. I will most certainly make this again.

This recipe is a perfect copy of the garlic shrimp served in the Portugese section of Newark, NJ. It doesn't strike me as a Mexican or Italian dish. I don't think it would go well with rice or pasta; too oily to mix into a starch. Bread for dipping works better. I doubled the amount of garlic and pureed it with 1/2 cup olive oil, onion, salt and pepper in a food processor until it was a loose paste. Marinate the deveined but still shelled shrimp for at least 1 hour in the garlic/onion/oil paste. I reduced the frying oil to just enough to coat the bottom of a large frying pan. WITHOUT cleaning off the marinade, place the shrimp in medium-hot oil, and fry for 2 minutes each side. Pour shrimp and oil into a bowl and serve with warm portugese rolls or crusty semolina bread. After the shrimp are gone, dip the bread in the garlic oil. Goes perfectly with a pitcher of sangria.

this is my first time trying out this recipe and was hesitant, after reading the mixed reviews, but it turned out pretty good. i followed the recipe verbatim and also made the mexican white rice as suggested. it was a great accompaniment to the shrimp. next time i think that i will cut down on the oil a little. otherwise, i would leave the recipe as is.

HELLO!! Is anyone reading the review from...let's see...MEXICO! We are so Americanized in our taste of Mexican food.(Taco Bell!) This rice is like a fresh breath after spicy or hot foods. Kind of like clearing yout pallet. It prepares your mouth to catch all the spicyness again making the meal more enjoyable!

Not Authentic? Then what are they? Unauthorized shrimp? Boot-leg Shrimp? Artificial Shrimp? Virtual Shrimp? Imagined Shrimp? And what's with the phrase "very authentic?" Isn't authenticity (if there is such a thing in cooking) a binary proposition?

Rating: 3
I looked at the amount of olive oil and cut it down by half a cup, and that seemed to work just fine. It is very, very delicious. As for this whole notion of "authenticity" I just don't get it-- it's like saying that anyone in any country other than the United States never changes a recipe or experiments... (I mean, how silly) and that recipes should be static, in order to be any good. Makes precious little sense to me.

I really wanted to like this dish, especially given the reviews it received. It was just too oily for my taste (3/4 cup oil?). I served it over pasta instead of rice and ended up pitching the pasta because it was like an oil slick. Sorry, I found much better recipes on your site for shrimp than this one.

Rating: 3
The flavor was delicious. The sauce I found too oily and wouldn't use again over the rice or in my case quinoa. It's better as just a marinade.

To the Cook from Mexico...No, this isn't very authentic, but rather yummy. If you want an authentic recipe for garlic shrimp, do a web search for Rick Bayless' version. It's an easy and outstanding recipe, and very authentic. It's easier and less oily than this recipe.

Delicious and simple. I made these with the rosemary grilled shrimp from this site, and preferred these. My only problem with the recipe was getting the shells off after grilling... we got marinade all over our fingers. Good licking off, but a little too messy, I thought!

This was fantastic. My wife and I gobbled these up and enjoyed every succulent bite. For a little show, I did add a splash of a little brandy into the pan and ignite with match (always an attention getter). Keeping the shells on the shrimp seem to preserve the moisture and keep them from drying out. This has always been a big problem for me in the past. I used collosal shrimp. I think I'll try adding a little white wine next time.

I thought this recipe was great. I did add more garlic because I'm a garlic lover. When cooking, make sure the fire is high and the oil is HOT and I would use less oil. I added about 6 basil leaves and marinaded for about 2 hours. Excellent and easy!

This recipe was just awesome!!! And the Mexican Rice was PERFECT with the shrimp. We live in Finland so we used giant prawns (already skinned, deveined, everything)obtained from the frozen section. The recipe was so easy and so delicious: one of the best recipes from this Web site thus far, in my opinion.

This is a great week night recipe. I am sure it is delicious as written but, I added a few things for fun. I will definitly keep it on hand for a busy night. My additions were adding about a tsp. of stone ground mustard and the juice of one lemon, plus approx two TBS fresh basil. Have you seen the new fresh herbs that come in a tube from the produce section? Again, a busy night saver!!

This is delicious, although not too much different from other shrimp recipes I've tried. There is a Mediterraneon-style version we prepare with the same ingredients plus 1/4 cup lemon juice and a tsp lemon zest. For ease of eating I tried this with peeled shrimp, removing the shrimp from the pan when done, but leaving the marinade on medium heat to reduce to a nice sauce. I added the shrimp to the sauce just before serving. The dish did not seem to suffer from this treatment. Either way,it's a great recipe!

Rating: 3
A super recipe, although I think you underestimate the quantities needed to feed four hearty appetites. As given, it merely was adequate for two people with a liking for shrimp. Also, the rice accompaniment suggestion with its heavy capsicum content, while perhaps authentic, came near tooverpowering with the flavors of the shrimp and garlic.
