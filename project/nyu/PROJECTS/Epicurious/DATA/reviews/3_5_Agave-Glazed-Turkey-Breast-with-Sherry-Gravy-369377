Great technique for cooking a turkey breast. Didn't make the gravy per the recipe. Thickened the juices in the pan with a cornstarch slurry; added water from making mashed potatoes and a little extra chicken stock. Left the onions in there and whisked them right into the gravy. Would make this one again.

So I actually made this, and it was delicious. Rich, slightly sweet-sour tang to the turkey - not overpowering, just right. It was quick, easy, and came out perfectly. It made a nice showy Thanksgiving bird for 2 with generous leftovers. I'll make it again with chicken or a Cornish hen - yum!

I wanted to try this but the reviews sound scary... However, I'm a 'try it myself' kinda guy and will adjust to my liking if possible. No recipe should be rejected without given a fair testing first. Don't like how it sounds, leave it be, perhaps someone else will be brave enough (as most of us,) to do what I'm going to do. Look for my comment in the future. God bless and Happy Thanksgiving.

@blueskymining: ROFL ... don't know the difference between agave-the-green-plant and agave nectar? Did you even READ the recipe?

Having learned to Roast a traditional TG Turkey from my German-Czech Grandmothers the right way, this recipe and picture looks and sounds like crap. Who the hell wants an "off-green" turkey that tastes like Agave?? Sorry, but there is not enough Sherry on planet Earth to hide the awful taste of Agave on any "bird" meat! This is one recipe to RUN FROM!!
