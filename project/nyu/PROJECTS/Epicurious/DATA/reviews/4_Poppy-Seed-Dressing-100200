Love your recipe. I started with the onion juice. (did 1/2 large onion or 3/4 medium in blender. moved to a wire strainer over a bowl put juice back in blender). I added some white wine vineger (say 1/4 cup). Some EVOO (oil say 2 T). Some grey poupon mustard (say 2 T), added poppy seed and blended (say 2 T). Then I added about 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo...and some brown sugar. Technically I guess you just add the poppy seeds after it is blended. I love the recipe. The onion juice did not come out until I had pulverized the onions. The larger wire strainer made it easy. I put the onions back in the tiny plastic bowl for later use!). The ONION juice is what makes the recipe...THANKS.

Delicious. I chopped 1/2 small white onion in my processor, then added ¼ tsp of Dijon mustard, sugar, salt, white wine vinegar, and oil and briskly blended it. Then place the ingredients in a jar with the poppy seeds and gently shake. For next time, I would reduce the amount of poppy seeds.

My family loves this dressing - so simple, yet so good! Love it with strawberries in the salad in the summer.

How much mustard?

So amazingly easy, and really delicious. I took the advice of prior reviewers, and just put 1/2 a small onion in the blender with the sugar, salt and vinegar (tarragon white wine), and I also added about a teaspoon of whole mustard seeds. Blended all that smooth, and added the oil while running. Stirred in the seeds at the end. This was fabulous on a fresh picked lettuce salad with tiny ripe strawberries.

Love this recipe! It's a classic! No mustard needed & just toss a small chopped onion in a blender to make 'onion juice'. Add sugar, salt & vinegar. Blend & slowly drizzle in oil. Finish with poppy seeds & you're a super star!

This was delicious - great for spinach salad and a recipe I have shared with others in the short time I have been making it. Since there was no quantity for mustard - I added a bit of powedered mustard as well as dijon.

The other reviewers are right about this one--just the right amount of sweetness. I reduced the amount of poppy seed to 1 1/2 t. This will be my standard recipe for poppy seed dressing henceforth.

Blend onion with sugar & vinegar in a blender, then add the oil. I omitted the mustard.....and kept ALL the poppyseeds....LOVE THEM! It was great on spinach salad with red onion & sliced strawberries. You can buy onion juice, but I haven't found it yet. It's just as easy to use 1/2 a small onion!

Easy and adaptable. I used the fresh onion in mine and did it in the food processor. Imagine onions in a fruit salad dressing! It is company worthy. Spectacular for those of us who like different flavors.

Yes, something is missing--1 tsp. DRY mustard. I have been making poppy seed dressing by a similar recipe I got in the 70s from a Texan friend who said it was from Neimann Marcus' retaurant. It called for more sugar, but this amount is fine; depends on your taste and what you are serving it with. A summer favorite in this house is a fruit platter which almost always has melon, strawberries, blueberries, grapefruit, and green grapes. You can add just about any fruit you like. At one time you could buy onion juice; I haven't looked for it lately. You can also finely grate onion, or just put a slice or two in the food processor with the dry ingredients, process until smooth, then add vinegar and pour in oil with motor running. Use white distilled vinegar and a neutral vegetable oil, esp. if serving with fruit. I like to mix all ingredients except poppy seeds and store in fridge (it keeps better). When needed, take out 1/2 cup and stir in 1&1/2 tsp. poppy seeds, more or less to taste. (enough for 4 servings)

Outstanding! We loved this dressing on our spinach salad. I took the advice of the previous reviewer and used a heaping teaspoon of poppy seeds and it was perfect.

Loved this dressing. Very light with a little sweetness, but not too sweet. I however felt 1- 1/2 tablespoons of poppy seeds were too much. I altered it with 1 heaping teaspoon, much better.

Was thinking about making a salad with greens and fruit to accompany a very spicy main course, but this recipe is apparently incomplete. Mustard? ONION JUICE? (Try minced.) Anyway, I'm moving on.....

This recipe sounds like it is exactly what I have been looking for. Just when was it last updated? Especially with regards to how much mustard and what type of mustard? (Certainly not since the last review [7-01]!

I added one tablespoon of Dijon mustard and two tablespoons of minced red onion. The dressing tasted great, maybe a little sweet.

I also would like to make this recipe. My question (in addition to the mustard) is: What is onion juice?

Rating: 0
I would like to give a review on the dressing, but there is no mention of "mustard" in the recipe. How much and what type{if at all) does it call for?
