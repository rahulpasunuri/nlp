Thank you, Allessandro. I, too, had difficulty understanding where these cookies might deserve a 'disgusting' rating as mentioned by another user, but the mention of Pam would indicate the tuiles were not made with the correct ingredients. When created with the ingredients as listed, and proper Silpat liner used as suggested, these tuiles are a delicate treat to enjoy. So light, so dainty, and by using oil in place of the butter, less saturated fat, always a win-win.

Loved these tuiles. Made them for this past Passover and they were almost as good as the tuiles I used to have to bake when I worked at Bouley. Was surprised that another reviewer found them to be "disgusting." Our guests devoured them, tasting a nice blend of almond and lemon. Will most likely repeat this next year.

This tasted like oil mixed with a hint of lemon. It was DISGUSTING! They are very fattening and DEFINITELY not worth the calories! So, if you like the taste of oil and pam and starch with a hint of lemon, this is for you!

Soooo good and soooo easy ! I made a couple of different versions because I ran out of almond extract. Anise/black pepper/oregano : omit the lemon zest, almond extract and sliced almonds and add 1/2 tsp anise seed, 1/2 tsp chopped fresh oregano and a couple of twists of fresh ground pepper. Also, Lemon/basil/pine nut : omit the almond extract, increase the lemon zest, add 1 tsp thinly sliced basil and top with pine nuts. For all of them, make sure you spread the batter thinly and cook until golden toward the center of the cookie.
