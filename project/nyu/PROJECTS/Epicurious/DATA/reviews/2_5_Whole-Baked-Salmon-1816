the first disappointing recipe I've made from epicurious. I suppose it really needs to be served cold because if warm it's really mushy. Next time, I'll take make the effort to filet the fish and make salmon with mustard and brown sugar glaze (a great salmon recipe). I hated this but my dog loved it.

Very good, simple and straightforward approach to cooking a whole salmon, with nice results. I added some water to the pan (1/4-inch) for a combined baking and poaching. Both flavor and texture were as good or better than expected. Some other reviewers have commented negatively on the sauce, which I whipped up as an afterthought. It definitely needs a sauce, and this one went over very well.

We like this salmon quite a bit. It had a really pleasant flavour. I didn't make the mayo sauce, we just drizzled with lots of lemon.

Was very dissappointed in the sauce. I will hold on to my "stand-by" sauce. For those interested, I melt butter, add finely chopped scallions, and minced garlic, alot of freshly coarse ground black pepper, and just enough honey to make it slightly sweet. Place salmon on foil, pour sauce over, and seal. Throw on grill until slightly under-done. Carry-over heat will continue to cook until flaky.

This turns out a very nice salmon. I checked on the fish a bit early, which was probably a good thing as it seemed to be cooked quite nicely in about 45 minutes or so. I saved all the juices in the foil wrap for a simple sauce to pour over the fish when I served it.

This is a wonderful meat dish. And not something most people fix. It's quite the treat! Thank you

This was awful. I literally tossed it into the trash as it was unfit to serve. It was so mushy! I believe cooking with the lemon juice denatures the protiens causing the flesh to be very mushy.

I've made this receipt twice now, with a boneless salmon roast in a net, stuffed with Spinach, seafood stuffing. It was delicious!! Especially serverd over a lemon cheese risotto.
