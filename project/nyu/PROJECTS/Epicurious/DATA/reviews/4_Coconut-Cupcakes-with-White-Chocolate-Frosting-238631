I only made the frosting but its delicious. I used Merckens White Chocolate and found it to be a little sweet when the frosting was mixed so I added an additional 4TBSP of butter to round it out. Very good and will definitely make again. Note, definitely make sure your chocolate is completely melted - I did mine in the microwave out of laziness and I found a few chunks of white chocolate in my frosting which blocked up the piping tip. Very annoying!

Since most people reviewed the icing I'll review the cupcakes - they are excellent! Very light and moist, yet crunchy on the top. Very easy recipe that took about 20 minutes to make (I skipped the gradual adding of the three mixes and did it all at once in the food processor, they turned out fine). It made exactly 12 muffin-sized cakes, but if you want big overflowing muffin tops, consider making 10 pieces instead.

These were absolutely fabulous cupcakes. Period. I doubled the recipe for the cupcakes and the frosting, and everything turned out exceptionally well. The frosting is to die for! However, I don't understand some of the reviews. This frosting is the best-tasting and easiest frosting I have tasted or made in my life. I am an experienced, and avid baker. It only takes two or three minutes of hand-whipping with a wire whisk for it to turn shiny and smooth if you make sure your butter is at room temperature. It is also exactly enough for the number of cupcakes it's supposed to make, if you pipe on the frosting with a pastry bag. You would probably need a lot less if you just smear it on with a knife, so I'm sure it's intended for piping, as the quantity was dead-on. This frosting remains completely stable at room temperature. The cupcakes themselves were incredible too. Light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness! These were a smashing hit at the Christmas party I took them to!

I, too, made just the frosting to go with the "Ganache-Filled Chocolate Cupcakes with Seven-Minute Meringe Frosting" for a 4X chocolate fix. Great frosting, but you definitely need to beat it long and hard in order to get it smooth and satiny...uh, don't read too much into that.

I used just the frosting part of this recipe and added toasted coconut. It worked out really good and tasted even better...

Have to admit, I'm just reviewing the frosting here, which is truly exceptional. I haven't tried the cupcakes themselves yet. But this has become my go-to frosting. It's fantastic. However, a word to the wise, whoever the sadist is who wants you to beat the frosting with a whisk should be sentenced to make at least three double batches as punishment. It takes a really long time to "beat until smooth and shiny." And by then you've dislocated your shoulder, bloodied your knuckles and taught any children in the vicinity lots of words you didn't want them to know. So do yourself a favor and use your electric mixer.

I needed a vanilla cupcake recipe for my sister who's finicky and isn't crazy about chocolate. These were perfect. I used 1/2 chopped white chocolate in place of coconut. I figured it would add some moisture without altering the proportions of the recipe too much. These came out prefectly! The flavor was actually very close to sugar cookies in cake form! Delish!!! I can't comment on the frosting. I made a double batch of my favorite and used it on these. Just use frosting that you are already used to, or top these with whipped cream. Either way they are great!!!

Just needed the frosting. Recipe is needs to be more accurate. Those who had clumps of butter did not have the butter softended. Soften butter. I mixed the pd.sugar with whipping creme then followed rest of recipe. I did not hand whip and if you want a light whipped consistancy then make sure the chocolate is cooled yet still liquid. I liked the consistancy but it was a bit sweet-I'm going to try less sugar.

the cake is wonderful the directions for the frosting are crazy.. when I try a new recipe I follow instructions to the letter, then my own way the second time. Don't add the butter to the mixture secondly.. cream the butter first.. The texture was clumpy... I put fresh coconut ontop of the cupcakes to disquise the bad presentation

I was very excited to try this recipe.. I thought the white chocolate would compliment the light coconut cupcakes. These cupcakes were a tad dry...I even added 1/4 cup veg. oil. The frosting preparation instructions are backward. Butter to be creamed first! then add the chocolate and other things. I had to add coconut on top to disguise the clumpy frosting. Recipe needs individual tweaking. will try it again

Not loving these cupcakes. Too dense and too dry. Just okay.... I didn't make the frosting though, I had a strange flour-based recipe I wanted to try with passion fruit juice, which turned out surprisingly delicious. I'll be looking for a different cupcake recipe next time for my frosting!

LOVED IT! We left out the unsweetened coconut, and would maybe add a little coconut extract instead, but this recipe is fabulous. I halved the frosting to make just enough for the cupcakes.

I made just the frosting. It was good, but needed 3 cups powdered sugar. Too greasy with just 1 3/4 that the recipe called for. This is a good option from regular buttercream frosting. The white chocolate flavor really comes through.

I love these cupcakes but I would rename them. These are similar to the cake texture from my mother's and grandmother's kitchens until they started using boxed cake mixes. I would rename this Coconut Pound Cake Cupcakes with White Chocolate Frosting! These are very dense and rich cupcakes and not the fluffy white cupcakes this generation would find to be familiar. I actually like the fluffy white ones, too, these are just different!

These are so good! Everyone said they tasted like sugar cookies. In the future I'm leaving out the coconut--wasn't crazy about the texture of it inside the cake. But the frosting is really good too, used that on a chocolate cake. This will most definitely be my "white cake" recipe. Except that to make layers, the recipe needs to be doubled.

A keeper! I made the recipe to the letter except that I only had unsweetned coconut so I just doubled it and added a bit extra sugar.

This recipe was really good! The cake was moist and delicate. I added mandarin juice to the batter and icing and to brighten the flavors. Got rave reviews! Strangely, the icing is enough for 24 cupcakes but the batter only made a dozen. I'm about to make a second batch!

I didn't make the cupcakes, but I did make the frosting to go over some brownies. The frosting is delicious, hope the cupcakes are just as good!

These are YUMMY! I substituted a cream cheese (neufchatel) frosting with a little coconut extract, and would do the same again. Topped some cupcakes with toasted coconut. I'll make these again and again to the detriment of my waistline!
