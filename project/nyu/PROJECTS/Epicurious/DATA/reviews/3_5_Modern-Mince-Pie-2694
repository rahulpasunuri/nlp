Made this a few days ahead and let it chill in the fridge. Assembled on Xmas Day and served that evening with vanilla ice-cream. Everything hit the right note - Not too apple-y (I used spartans and granny smith - left them quite chunky), not too clove-y not too citrus-y. It was all a lovely balance. Got rave reviews. Will make again. I might try a different crust though. Something more buttery and flaky. The only downside is its a bit pricey to put together.

This did not have strong rum or brown sugar flzvor. I added 2 more cups of brown sugar and another 1/2 cup of dark rum to make it more like mince meat.

This recipe tasted too close to apple pie and not like mince pie fililng. I upped the amount of brown sugar to 2 cups, used 1 cup of molasses and doubled the amount of each spice to make it taste more like mince.

We all liked this. Easy to make, and the last piece tasted good even three days later. (I did use my own crust recipe.) I might reduce the cloves to the barest pinch next time, as I thought their flavor was a bit strong.

When I lived in England I loved Mince Pies. I was doubtful I could recreate the complex flavors and textures at home, but this recipe does it. The only change was I used my own (trusted) crust recipe. I took the time to do an oak-leaf crust which looked incredible and people loved. I served it with homemade eggnog ice cream which went great!

I made this pie several times after it was in the magazine, but I lost the recipe a few years ago. I should have gone online to look for it sooner. I can't wait to make it again this year. Even people who think they they could never possibly like mince pie love it. I used to take it to a friend's house every year and it always disappeared quickly.

This was a hit for Christmas dinner. The flavor is rich and complex. We will be making this a traditional holiday dessert for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Very rich, but very good. The amount of apples seems excessive, but it is not. For the top "crust" I used Christmas tree and star cookie cutters and arranged them to make a pattern. Any type of cookie cutters could be used.

This is a new holiday tradition. It is delicious, rich, and comforting. I just wish we could come up with a better name because my pals are always put off by the thought of "mince" or "mincemeat." This is more like a very sophisticated apple pie.

I have never made or eaten mince pie before, but my English-raised boyfriend raved about this recipe. He said it was just like how his grandmother would've made it! Instead of making one big pie, I made mini tartlets instead. I think it works better because of the rich filling.

i'm being silly here, i realize, but i think it ought to be said... the recipe says to put together "the first 17 ingredients". that's everything except for the pie crust. so why not just say "combine everything except for the pie crust"? or not; i think most cooks would know not to cook the pie crust in with the pie filling in a big pot. but it's good though.

Fun to make and very tasty. It didn't fit in my 9" pie pan, though; I had to cook it in a larger baking dish. (Maybe I bought apples that were too large, I don't know. :) )

We have made this pie at Christmas and Thanksgiving since 1991. The very best minced pie we've ever had. This pie is ok when made a day ahead and keeps well. This is a very rich recipe and plan on serving 12-14 slices per pie. The original article illustrates a top crust of cutout oak leaves. Simply get a cutter and score the leaves for a realistic look
