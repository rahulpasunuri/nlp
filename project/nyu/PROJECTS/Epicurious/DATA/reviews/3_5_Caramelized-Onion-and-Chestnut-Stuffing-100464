I've used this many times, and it has become my default dressing. I've substituted the chestnuts with both pecans and walnuts, and both are very good--and easy. I've also used it as both stuffing and dressing, though, when using as dressing, I add more broth.

This recipe has become my yearly tradition. Delicious. I roast my own chestnuts because the jar is unbelievably expensive. A pain, but worth it. I also added quite a bit of extra broth before putting it in the oven. Just kept pouring until it was nice and soggy, since I wasn't stuffing the turkey. Came out perfect.

I love this recipe, and it has become my family's tradition! I prefer to use sourdough bread instead of the french, and I also add one diced granny smith apple along with the celery to saute with the onion mixture. I would recommend actually stuffing your turkey with the stuffing to ensure it doesn't come out dry, or else adding additional broth to the mixture before baking. (Bobby Flay gave the best bit of advice: Just when you think the stuffing is moist enough, add a bit more broth, and then you"re right on. Love it!

I made this recipe for the American Assoc. of Chile Thanksgiving lunch in Santiago. It was as show stopper with the Roast Turkey with Herb Butter and Caramelized Onion-Balsamic Gravy. And it's easy to follow.

Very good stuffing. It is STUFFING, so you should stuff the bird and bake it in it, and you won't have any problems with dryness. Never understood this oximorronic stuffing baked aside....

A delicious stuffing. I stuffed the turkey with it and had no problems with it being dry.

The recipe was easy and convenient--you could do most of the work ahead. My rating would have been higher but since we did not roast it in the bird, it came out quite dry. If I made it again, I'd roast it in the turkey or added more broth and/or turkey drippings (it takes only 30 minutes to bake by itself so you could do it while the turkey "rests" before serving).

This was good, but a bit laborious. I added mushrooms to the stuffing which I think gave it a nice flavor. Also, if I make it again I would chop the chestnuts into smaller pieces. I found the quarters to be a bit too much. Overall - a great stuffing which was great even a few days after Thanksgiving./

It didn't seem as though it would end up dry, but it did. I might make it again, but with this in mind. The aroma suggested that adjustments would make it fantastic.

All in all, this was a disappointment. I'm going back to my own tried-and-true stuffing next time!

This is a good stuffing, but not super distinctive. If I make it again I'll use quite a few more chestnuts.

This recipe was great! I found that the estimated cooking time for the onions was a bit short. Caramelizing the onions for 30-35 minutes, instead of 20, resulted in sweet flavorful onions. I also made the dish with veggie broth and the results were wonderful. It still makes a very "meaty" dressing. I also made the suggested gravy. I would recommend making both!

This is a wonderful and very traditional stuffing recipe.

Very good flavor, especially re-heated the next day as the flavor seemed to mature. Subtle and delicious.

If you are going to make this recipe I strongly suggest that you buy chestnuts in the jar. Roasting and cleaning the chestnuts was very labor intensive. I also think the recipe is entirely remiss in the amount of chicken broth needed. I tripled the amount and it still came out a little dry (however, we didn't stuff the bird with it -- maybe that's the difference).

Easy recipe to follow. I used a hardy nine-grain raisin & walnut bread instead of white french bread. I used more chicken broth and roasted chestnuts. Make one day ahead so the flavors blend. A great tasting and easy to make stuffing. Everyone loved the nutty flavors and it sounds so gourmet when you say, "Oh, I made a Caramelized Onion & Chestnut Stuffing for our Thanksgiving dinner".

After making this recipe in 1998 it has become a family and friend favorite. Each year we are requested by others to make it for the holidays. I recommend you try it, you'll love it.

This was my first attempt at hosting Thanksgiving at my house, and I am now elected to host EVERY year!! This was SO delicious, EVERYONE still raves about it! Every course I made that evening was from epicurious.com, & my entire family was SO impressed by my "culinary skills!" It was easy to follow, even for a beginner like myself! This is our NEW family tradition Turkey dinner. If you want to impress your family, as most newlyweds do, try this and other recipes from epicurious! You won't be dissappointed!

Very nice flavour. Happily, chestnuts are easy to find here, and can be bought peeled and frozen. I have made it three times, and it has always turned out very well.

Made this For Thanksgiving, with Williams-Sonoma chestnuts- hardly any prep time (just chop). Was excellent stuffing, worth doing again & again!

I have not made this yet, but I wanted to say that I have made other chestnut recipes using RAW CASHEWS and they taste the same. They are easy to find and there is NO preparation time.

Very good taste but needed much more chicken broth and using fresh roasted chestnuts was time consuming (peeling them). I may try to find the jarred next time. Therefore I am glad that I also used packaged breading. When cooking for a large group this may take more time than it is worth but if you have the time the taste is very good.

A warning: Finding these chestnuts is more difficult than nailing jell-o to a tree. (At least in Portland) That said, it was a very flavorful dressing. I used chopped pecans, which worked well. It was a little dry, so I added a little (1/2 cup?) of chicken broth to moisten the bread. Worked fine -- tasted great.

I had never made chestnut stuffing before. Now, this is the only stuffing I make. It's fabulous! Great with the Roast Turkey with Herb Butter and Carmelized Onion-Balsamic Gravy (also November, 1998). Easiest and best turkey gravy ever too!

My family loved this stuffing and the gravy that goes with it. It was the best part of the Tahnksgiving meal. A new tradition with us.
