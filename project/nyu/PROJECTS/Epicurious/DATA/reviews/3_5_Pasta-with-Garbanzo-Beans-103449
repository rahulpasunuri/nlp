This is simple and quick. I made it with little effort. My family has some young'uns that don't like it hot, so I scrimped a little on the crushed red pepper.

Surprisingly tasty. I did what others did by adding a full cup of pasta. I used wheat shells. I also used an entire small can of tomato paste and ended up using an entire quart of chicken broth. Very enjoyable dish. Quick, easy, satisfying!

Really yummy, very easy, and quick. Made two hearty main dish portions. A soup-y sort of pasta dish that was a nice change from the usual.

Love it love it~ Made it for my grandbabies who both are riddled with allergies, we used rice pasta and Queso Fresca goat cheese. Then I made it for myself, at home using spelt pasta, yummy and so nourishing.

Delicious! My family loved this,makes just enough for two adults and 1 child as a main course. I used brown rice noodles for my gluten free son.

Very easy and YUMMY. but if you are dumb like me and dont really read the directions...make sure you use three, 1/4 cups of broth. not 3 and 1/4... ;)

Not the most amazing dish, but amazingly easy and satisfying. Gets better the next day. I used 1 c. whole wheat shell pasta.

This was fairly quick and tasted great. I added 4 cloves of garlic, organic garbanzo beans and used the juice from the can and the chicken broth. I doubled the pasta to 1 cup. The fresh parsley, e.v.o.o and parm cheese is a must.

i try to keep the ingredients for this dish in the cupboard because it is so easy and always a hit.

This is a terrific basic recipe. I used red peppers instead of celery and extra garlic (I put some in right near the end as well). I doubled the amount of pasta to make it a hearty first course. It only took about an extra cup of liquid to cook (I used broth from cooking the garbanzos) and an extra tablespoon of tomato paste. It's true as other reviewers noted that a good freshly grated parmesan is key.

I had to review this dish again. I have made it twice a week since the first time I made it a couple of months ago. So easy...and so satisfying. The ingredients can be finessed to a point with what you have on the shelf -- and the garbanzos give it such a hearty texture. I love it...and so does everyone else I have given the recipe to!

Delicious--perfect fare for a single person on a Sun. night...didn't have tomato paste on hand, substituted a few scoops of organic diced tomatoes w/ juice, which worked fine.

This dish is wonderful...can easily be made fully vegetarian, too. Great for a quick, satisfying lunch or paired with a salad for dinner. Leftovers heat up well...great as a side with fish. Agree that good parmesan is key...and don't forget to hit it with fresh parsley!

I love garbanzo beans but have yet to find a fantastic garbanzo bean pasta sauce. Tried to give this one some more flavor by adding a half of a cinnamon stick... gave it a little more depth. Next time will use cinnamon stick and a little orange zest and maybe a smidge of rosemary or sage.

I really love this recipe - I have made it many times as a main course for myself and for my vegetarian family (substituting with vegetable broth). It is always enjoyed by everyone immensely - the key is to use a very good parmesaen cheese, as that is what adds such great flavor to this dish.

This dish was very bland. I tried to jazz it up by adding spinach & diced tomatoes, but it was still not very exciting.

I loved this, but my husband went in search of the cereal. I'm a salt lover, so I used regular chicken broth, and it was too salty for me. Try Health Valley's veggie broth instead, it's my new all-purpose broth, and it's lower in sodium.

Yum! A great summer meatless dish that even my diehard carnivore boyfriend loved. The one-pot aspect is superb as well - so easy to make after a long day at work. Omitted celery, doubled garlic, bay leaves & tomato paste.

Easy and delicious! Used it as a main course and added extra pepper. Great with a crusty french loaf and red wine.

This was such an easy one-pot weeknight meal. I nearly always have all the ingredients on hand. I might skip the celery next time. I couldn't find low-salt chicken broth, so it was very salty. If that happens again, I would use half chicken broth, half water.

Doubled the peper flakes and used small shell pasta. We were delighted with both the taste and texture of this dish.

I love this although I usually leave out the celery (not a big fan). The bay leaves are the key to its flavor and I've sometimes added zucchini or peas for color/variety. It's a great comfort food!

I doubled the recipe and used it twice for a main dish and everyone loved it. I used three or four small bay leaves instead, which gave it a more intense flavor. Easy, tasty, meatless, filling, and liked equally by kids and adults...

Easy, tasty, and cheap to prepare. I add 2 ounces of chopped pancetta to the celery, and saute it for 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. The celery ends up too hard otherwise. I also drizzle with a fine extra virgin olive oil before serving. Fabulous meal!

This recipe was so easy and so flavorful that I was glad I didn't start to make changes. It's a cross between a soup and a pasta dish, definitely a meal in itself.

Delicious, different and easy!
