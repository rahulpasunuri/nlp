Definitely tasty, and I will make it again, but the spices (save for the ginger) seemed to get lost somewhere. I didn't make the whipped cream, but I think that would have lost the other spices even more. A tasty break from "normal" hot chocolate, give it a shot.

I made this without the whipped cream, and it was still amazing, though I found this made 4 rather than 6 servings if you use mugs. The deliciousness of the cardamom and chocolate together was a revelation to me.

I loved this. I find any hot chocolate too sweet and am a coffee drinker, so I had a mug of half coffee and half of this with the ginger whipped cream. Great treat on a weekend morning! Would enjoy without the cream, which adds to the sweetness.

I like unusual tastes, this qualifies as unusual, but this didn't do anything for me (kind of blah). A waste of calories.
