basically the proportions are off, the baking time is off, but it's hard to go wrong with these ingredients... delicious but needs tweaking like the other reviews suggest. i added more flour and less coconut, and needed to bake for a few minutes longer.

Be sure to space them out 2 inches apart! Very yummy but a messy cookie and I would use less chocolate chips.

Followed the recipe exactly...got more cookies than anticipated so must have mad them smaller. Would add walnuts next time but delicious. Great texture. Expected overwhelming coconut but they were well balanced.

I baked the cookies for 13 minutes rather than 10, just because they were so thick. The recipe made excactly 27 cookies for me, but they were pretty big, and like I said, needed to be baked for longer. These cookies tasted SO good and I will absolutely make them again. The coconut and chocolate chip amounts were perfect for me and didn't overpower eachother. This is probably the best cookie I've ever made and tasted. :D

I like this cookie. I made the following changes after reading prior reviews, only used 2 cups of coconut and 1 cup of walnuts. I followed everything else as instructed. Next time I will try this cookie with a banana and reduce the sugar.

I used almost 2 cups of flour, almost 2 cups of coconut, 1 cup of choco chips, and instead of white and brown sugar - I used one cup of raw/turbinado sugar and my cookies turned out very cakey (in a good way) and had some good texture since the raw sugar is pretty gritty. Quite good, I'm hoping they freeze well.

I usually favor more doughy cookies, but I liked these cookies before I added the extra cup of 1/2 flour. I like both variations, but I thought the original recipe was better. Delicious!

I made two batches with several changes based on the comments. With the modifications, I was very pleased with the recipe and would make it again, though it is not my favorite cookie recipe. I made the following modifications: 1) Baked at 350 for 14 minutes 2) Added one cup of flour 3) Subtracted one cup of coconut 4) Omitted brown sugar altogether, and kept suggested amount of regular sugar 5)Used slightly more vanilla extract 6) Added some crushed macadamia nuts (in second batch) Next time I might use 2.5 cups of coconut, even more macadamia nuts, and maybe half and half brown sugar and regular sugar. I think they need something else for added complexity of flavor, but I can't figure out what that should be.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added an extra cup of flour. With that modification, I would rate this recipe at 4 forks. These cookies are delicious!

I really love these cookies, and so does anybody with a like of coconut and chocolate. They're really a hit. I agree that 1/2 cup more flour helps the cookie. We also think that you could cook a minute less.

So following the advice to a degree, made some changes: 2c flour salted butter no salt 2c white sugar no brown sugar 1 1/2tsp vanilla 3 1/2c coconut 1/4 c walnut chips Everything else was the same. I rolled the dough into 1/2" balls and baked them at 325 for 15 min. I ended up with over 100 nibbler sized cookies. Crispy buttery edges, chewy coconut-y centers. Fantastic! Will definitely be making this again and again and . . .

Easy! Delicious! Even those not fond of coconut couldn't get enough!

I added one cup of flour per the other reviews, used only 2 cups of coconut, used mini chocolate chips. Baked at 335 for 10 minutes. Pure heaven, looked excellent and tasted excellent. Didn't have brown sugar in the house so used 1 c of white sugar only. Added this recipe to permanent collection.

This recipe is a dud. The cookies were flat, lacked body, and generally bad.

These cookies are ok. Yes very sweet and alittle bland. I did add the extra cup of flour and the texture is nice. I also added some pignolis and they make it a little more interesting but I think there are much better cookie recipes out there.

the negative reviewers are crazy! too thin?! the thinner the better I say! I love these cookies and make them lots. just watch baking time so that they don't burn. I make them with unsweetened coconut though and bittersweet chocolate chips when I can.

All the reviews almost made me not try this easy recipe! I followed other reviewers suggestions, (1 c. more flour, 1/4 c. less sugar, 1 c. less coconut.) I also added 1/4 c. oats! These cookies came out in perfect golden mounds, with an amazing moist center! Will make a regular addition to our cookie baking!

too thin,, needed atleast another cup of flour, u would think that gourmet site like this would test the recipe first.

These were disappointingly average, certainly not good enough to add to my repertoire when there are so many really good cookie recipes out there.

I have been making this one for about 8 years and only around the holidays. I always end up making twice as many as the year before. This year it will be up to 20-23 batches. I can't seem to make enough to keep everyone happy :) It is the all-time most favorite cookie around my home and work and moms and the in-laws, etc.... The best sweet and chewy cookie around!

First batch came out very thin: one humongous, flat cookie! It was still absolutely delicious! I went back and added about a cup of flour and the next batch actually resembled cookies! YAHHH! Very good and very sweet, have lots of water handy to quench your sweet tooth.

These were lacy like florentines the day after crisping in an airtight tin. Used unsweetened coconut, otherwise would have been cloyingly sweet.

They quickly became everyone's favorite. Worth every calorie!!

Love these cookies - but they are very sweet. Did try making them with margarine and less brown sugar but they did not turn out as well.

This recipe was interesting...I knew these would be think cookies, but I didn't know they'd be NEARLY as thin as they came out. They were crumbly and SUPER SWEET. My sister is a desert fanatic and she never thinks anything is too sweet, except for these cookies. On the other hand, they had a great taste and smelled great too, and although I'd make them again, the recipe would DEFINITELY need some modification. I used chocolate chunks instead of chips, and they were good overall. Next time I'll cut the sugar or use unsweetened flakes, increase the flour a little bit, and put them on 350 for 15 minutes. 375 is too high for these cookies. Overall, thumbs up.

I made these cookies and found them delicious but I wasn't happy with the appearance. They are thin and crisp on the edges but have a great chewy consistency. It also took me a couple tries to figure out the best cooking time and temperature--the ones given caused the edges to burn and the center to remain uncooked. I tried a different coconut choc. chip recipe and realized how good this one really is. I realized despite the less than beautiful appearance these cookies are really delicious. And i really love the chewiness the coconut gives them. I made them again recently and I got the cookies as perfect as they could be at 350 degrees for 10-11 minutes.

These are great and have already made an encore performance in our house! WATCH CLOSELY, as they have a propensity to burn. 10 minutes is too long.

Yummy!!! I found the amount of coconut to be perfect.

I followed some of the suggestions made by other reviewers which was quite helpful. I cooked the cookies at 325 F which made them crisp at the outside yet still soft overall. I also cut down the coconut to 2 cups and added 3/4 cups cocoa instead of the chocolate chips. They were great, very similar to chocolate macaroons but not as heavy. I will definately make these again, they were a great hit!

I was having some friends over for dinner and wanted to make something easy for dessert. This receipe was perfect. It was easy, I had all of the ingredients on hand, and the cookies turned out delicious. It also was nice because it was easy enough that my three year old daughter could help me. She loves to help! I would definatly make these cookies again.

8/00 Had coconut, so wanted to try this. To compensate for runnies I used 3/4 C more flour, 1 C less coconut, 1/4 tsp bk pwd, and 1 tsp cinnamon for kicks but it was indetectable after baking. I like a larger cookie so mine only made 36 3" cookies. They were crisp on edges, and tender elsewhere. It helps the runnies to keep your batter cool.

Makes an extremely thin cookie. Very hard to get off cookie sheet because cookies wants to split in two. Make sure you make VERY SMALL cookies. These spread big time. Most of my cookies ran together. Makes a lot more than 27 unless you want them the size of a dinner plate. I think there was too much coconut in this recipe and I LOVE coconut. I think the batter should have been a little thicker; maybe that would have made the cookies less wafer-like. I would not make again. There are too many other coconut cookie recipes out there that are better. On the good side, if you love to eat cookie batter, this batter rates A1 with me.

Very rich yet cloud-like cookies which my husband loved dearly. I used fresh coconut which I happened to have on hand and I credit that for making them sublime.
