Delicious! I didn't have a skillet deep enough, so I put the fish fillets in a metal cake pan and steamed in a wok that had a lid. Cooked at lightening speed (under 5 minutes).

This is a wonderful, easy and exceptionally flavorful recipe. It has been turning out too salty in my kitchen because I only have light soy sauce (jiàng qing) on hand because I've been too lazy to replenish my supply of dark soy sauce. Even though it was too salty, the flavor was wonderful! This is definitely the catalyst that will get me up to Chinatown - I'm looking forward to making it with the right kind of soy sauce!

This dish is a traditional style preparation in our family, but we do a couple of things that you may want to try. I make mine with grouper, since we have such a wonderful fresh supply (a generous neighbor who fishes!) In addition to the cilantro, take a couple of green onions and cut into 1 inch pieces and add before steaming. If you like more of a citrus flavor, try substituting ponzu sauce for the soy sauce. We don't add the sesame oil during steaming. When the fish is done, we remove it, strain and reduce the pan juices a bit (by maybe a third). Plate the steamed fish, top with more fresh cilantro and slivered green onion, pour the reduced pan juice over all, then drizzle the sesame oil over and serve.

A great light, healthy dinner. I served this with some stir fried baby bok choy with shitakes and brown rice.

Good for a different tasting fish. Light and oriental tasting. Used flounder and served over saffron rice with snap peas.

Easy light delicious meal. Served the fish over saffron rice surounded with snap peas. Made a colorful presentation and complimenting flavors.

Simple, light and very tasty. I've made this with halibut and with ling cod, and both were good. I don't have a small enough wire rack so I put an upturned small plate on on the bottom of the skillet, then put the pie plate on top of that. You just need something to keep the pie plate off the bottom of the skillet.

Great, easy and even do ahead and re-warm. I used sole and it turned out great. Great for a party with brown rice, sugar snap peas.

Yum. I used my bamboo steamer over water in my big wok and this was amazing. So delicate, light , and flavorful. Will make this again for sure.

SO SIMPLE and so good! I steamed it in a vegetable steamer basket lined with parchment. Excellent! I threw some asparagus in as well in the last few minutes of steaming. It seemed to take more than 5 minutes (one 6 oz fillet of rainbow trout) but it could have been me fiddling with the stove too much.

I never cook fish at home but thought this recipe sounded really good -- it was the best!! I'm not a snapper fan so I used Tilapia, and it was absolutely incredible. The flavor was amazing and it was sooooo moist. I WILL be making this one again!

WOW - My fish-hating husband AND my 2 and 4 year old children DEVOURED this dish. I just used a vegetable steamer and put everything on top of the fish. Easy, healthy and a hit. Will definitely do this again.

Impecably fresh fish is essential to the success of steamed fish. Anything less should be used for frying or heavily sauced recipes. Grouper is the traditional Cantonese favorite. I use lots of shredded green onion and tiny shreds of ginger, and let it "marinate" for up to a couple of hours before steaming. I also use lots more cilantro.

Walleye was on sale at Kroger this week. The first night we grilled it and it was ok, but needed some flavor - so I went to my favorite resource for recipes and voilà. I used the suggestion of utilizing my microwave (a perfect steamer)and it was a breeze to prepare -so easy that I was able to stir-fry two other dishes to compelement the meal at the same time. It won't be an every week meal in our house - but it was a great alternative and certainly easy enough for a week night on it's own with some rice and a vegetable.

Use a neutral, less-fishy tasting fish for best results - I used White Roughy and it was great.

I made this with Tilapia and Patis as was suggested. My husband, who is Filipino, loved it but I thought it was nasty. I would make it again for him and maybe my in-laws but not for me.

A basket of truffles to the Cook from Mill Valley CA. I haven't tried the recipes but shall do so. I regard my microwave oven as a steamer and wonder why the great chefs and home-cooks disdain this wonderful appliance. Don't fry anything, don't bake fine pastries, don't grill -- you can't use it as a tin opener either. Please -- more attention to quirky users of microwave ovens.

The steaming worked great but the flavor was a bit bland. I added more soysauce and a little bit more salt. The cilantro makes a huge difference.

Very good fish recipe although I think that the dish would be better served with a more delicate flavored fish such as tilapia (can probably be found in Asian groceries). Adding patis, Philippine fish oil sauce, also might serve better than soy souce as well and maybe a little lemon or lime would be good, too. Also, rather than using the cake rack suggested in the recipe, the fish would be better cooked in a bamboo steamer with the glass dish placed inside. I will definitely make this dish again. Overall, a nice light but filling meal. I also served the dish with mushrooms with ginger, spinach, and soy and a large bowl of rice which accompanied the dish well.

I really like Cantonese steamed fish in restaurants, but this didn't do much for me. The garlic, ginger, and soy were overpowering somehow, and I really couldn't taste my nice red snapper at all. I'd ditch this recipe and turn back to my Chinese cookbooks next time I'm tempted to try this.

This dish is very similar to my mother's recipe, although I added some garlic as well. I placed the fish in a steamer which works very well. The old tradition would be to used the bamboo pots on top of double-boiler.

I used grouper instead of snapper because my fish merchant was out of snapper. Turned out really well and I don't usually like fish dishes. I steamed in a stand-alone steamer (rather than in a pot on the stove) which I think made it easier to cook. I love the way steaming kept the fish very moist.

I cooked in parchment paper (using same quanities of ingredients) instead of the described process for steaming. I also used green onions. It was delicious!

"Healthy" but bland.

I will make this again - my way. I rubbed the snapper with the fresh ginger then poured the liquid ingredients over it. I omitted the garlic, used sherry instead of white wine and topped it with the fresh cilantro. Rather than fussing with all of the steaming paraphernalia, I put the fish, covered, in the microwave for exactly five minutes. It was delicious and a great last minute meal! I give the recipe as written only three forks because I think it is unnecessarily complicated. I'd rate my simple and speedy version a four.

Made this recipe to include the orginal ingredients and the earlier suggestion of topping the fish, when served, with diced scallions. We made this in a regular steamer pot and placed the fish in a souffle dish inside the steamer. It was easy to make and delicious. Will definitely do it again.

Great flavor & so quick and easy! You can make it even faster by starting the water to boil while chopping--then you can clap the lid on as soon as you get all the ingredients together. We just moved from Hawaii, and I have to agree with the previous cook that this dish is definitely island-style. Brings back great memories!!

I just got back from Kauai and had a similar dish to this at a resort. Needless to say, I was so excited to try this. Though not exactly the same, the flavors are mimiced perfectly. Its a simple and low calorie dish. The set-up for cooking is a little strange. I just used a normal steamer with a pie pan on the top. I put a stock pot lid on top and cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for. It worked just fine. I also topped it with some green onions. YUM YUM!!!

This dish is good and very easy to make. Works well with Sea Bass also. My advise: Try it without the garlic.
