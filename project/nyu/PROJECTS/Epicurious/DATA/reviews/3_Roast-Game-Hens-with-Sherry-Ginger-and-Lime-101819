I'd make it again, but with some changes, unfortunately I'm not sure what they should be. The birds were cooked to perfection. The skins brown and the meat moist. So far so good. I made a gravy from the pan juices. The lime wasn't quite right at least for my taste. Perhaps I shouldn't have used the pan juices, but I hate to see them go to waste. I might try again without the lime.

Marinade didn't really flavor the game hens. If I hadn't cooked them on a charcoal grill, they would not have had much flavor at all. There are better recipes for these birds.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was dull as can be. I love all the ingredients, and let it marinate for 24 hours, but I didn't like it at all. In fact I through it out after a few bites. It's a mystery to me what the problem was, but I won't be trying it again.

I used the "sauce" as a marinade, and let the hens soak overnight. Circumstances intervened, and I didn't get to cook the hens until the following night. Thus, after 48 hours in the marinade, then roasting for an hour (30 mins. at 425* and 30 mins. at 375*), and omitting the bacon, these birds came out beautifully browned, wonderfully moist, and deliciously tastey. Fresh ginger is the key.

The next time I make this, I think I"ll cut the bacon amount in half. Other than that, it's a keeper.

Very easy and very good. You have to be a complete dumbass to louse this one up. I love serving Cornish Game hens. They make a nice impression when being served seeming as if they took a lot more effort than actually was needed.

Very good and easy. Bacon makes hens very moist.

I made this for guests and they raved about it, as did my husband. I was in such a hurry, as usual, I used ground ginger and powdered garlic from my spice rack. It was still spectacular.
