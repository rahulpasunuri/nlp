I changed the topping in accordance with the original cafe juanita recipe - and I still found it incredibly dry and it also burned within 20mins. Whilst the pears had a lovely vanilla fragrance I felt they could have had a little more syrup to counterbalance the dry crumble.

I followed the version from cafe Juanita and it was excellent. It's not too sweet and for fruit lovers like me, it's perfect, you can really taste the pear.

What a waste of wonderful ingredients! The topping is dry and crumbly and burns before the fruit below is cooked. Also, the fruit to topping ratio seems off.

For the topping, add 1/2 tsp.cinnamon, 2Tbl. sugar, and make the butter a whole stick, not 3/4. Much better!

REALLY wanted to like these crisps, but they were just terrible. I followed the recipe exactly, but they were so dry on top, and tasted awful.

I was so excited to make these crisps, but was disappointed with the results. The topping was very dry and the flavor just wasnt good.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I could eat it everyday. If you are bored with apple pie, this is a refreshing alternative - the almonds balance beautifully with the pear!

These were great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Used a full stick of butter in topping. Used pecans instead of almonds which I think was probably better. Also, seemed like I had too much topping so I didn't use it all. Big hit with my guests.

I really wanted to love this recipe. I'm a huge fruit crisp fan. When I read the recipe, the almonds concerned me a tad, but I decided to follow the recipe. Unfortunately, I thought the almonds in the crisp were much too overpowering for the delicate flavors of the pear. My 3 guests agreed.

Same as one above said, I would add a bit more butter. The topping was a bit bland but everything else was fantastic!

The lovely Barletts and the sweet-smelling brown butter is just phenomenal... I would say quite French. The crisp and crumbly topping texture reallly gives you and outstanding first impression. Would try again soon.

Exceptional!!!! Chef Holly is the best. If you haven't tried her Turnip Gratin (in the same Gourmet issue as the Pear Crisp) you should. I thought I hated turnips until I tried this recipe. I am now a convert and can't wait to make it again.

The flavors of this crisp were perfect together. Brown sugar, vanilla and pears made a delicious combination. I made it in an 8" square dish, but in the future will use individual ramekins. Served it warm with prepared caramel sauce. Whipped cream would be a nice addition, too.

Delicious, but would add a little more butter to topping, when baked, mine topping was still powdery and not dense and crisp.

I am a huge fan of Cafe Juanita and was thrilled to find try this recipe at home. Delicious and easy, too! The Bartlett pears are wonderful this time of year and the vanilla brown butter really added to the filling. I ate almost the whole crisp myself (over the course of a few days- delicious cold, too!)
