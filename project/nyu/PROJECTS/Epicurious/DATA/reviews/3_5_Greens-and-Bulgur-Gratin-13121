One of my favorite epicurious recipes. I double the bulgur,triple the garlic, use whatever good crumb you've got. Definitely use feta with the mozzarella, too. Even with lots of cheese, it has got to be good for you.

Solid recipe! We used collards, chard, and a little beet greens. I didn't realize I didn't have enough mozzarella, so I crumbled a thin layer of goat cheese as the middle layer. Also didn't have bulgur, so used 1 C cooked barley instead. Not crunchy, but it worked. We added cannellini per other suggestions, but as a side dish, it might be better without. The cheese does just bind, and this is not a decadent gratin, but it was good and the greens retained a little tang. Would make again in greens season!

I have made it repeatedly as written . I use collards and spinach. I like this recipe that doesn't beat the collards to death. With the bulgar and cheese, it has a nice chewy texture. Tonight, I skipped the breadcrumbs, because they seem to be just for show. I added extra bulgar instead of the breadcrumbs.

I've been making this one since it was first published in 1995. I used swiss or gruyere in stead of Mozzarella, which nicely offsets some of the more bitter greens like mustard or collards. Everyone who tries it is surprised at how good it is.

I didn't have any mozzarella in the fridge so I used a pureed cottage cheese instead. The flavor was great but it wasn't as stringy-cheesy as I'd hoped. Also, I added cauliflower because I had an extra head on hand, this was delicious, though I suggest cutting the florets very small. Next time I'll use mozzarella or another melty-stringy cheese and a can of(or 1/2 c dried and soaked) Lima beans.

I really enjoyed this, and it was a great way to use up a huge bag of kale and collards we got from our CSA this week. I didn't use all my leafy greens tonight in case it didn't work out but now I'm going to make this again tomorrow and take some of the suggestions on here (feta, balsalmic, beans, yum!).

I made this as per the recipe the first few times and really enjoyed it. Then did a variation to make it a single dish dinner: I doubled the bulghur, added two tins of cannellini beans; and sauteed the greens with garlic, chili flakes, 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, a splash of soy sauce, and a dash of liquid smoke. Really turned out well. This is on its way to become a staple in my house.

This is one of the few recipes I make over and over, and will make over and over for the rest of my life (once or twice a year). It is not for the unskilled cook, as it must be seasoned assertively. Use way more garlic, definitely try a little feta at least once, and get creative with your greens.

Good. I used Fontina, fresh mozzarella and parm. I would also add a béchamel sauce next time but during the fall or winter. I used beet greens, baby spinach and kale.

Wonderful recipe. I added it to my recipe box and definately will make it again.

I actually made a version of this based on a recipe I just read in Yoga Journal. I used kale and swiss chard. the recipe called for gruyere would be far better than mozzarella any day - also add a cup of milk (i used soy cream), i added whole wheat panko crumbs and parmesan on the top. i did very low on the dairy and used olive oil instead of butter. i also skipped the bulgur and added white pepper and sauteed shallots, which i put in everything.

It's okay, but nothing special. It was a nice way to use up lots of greens from our CSA box in the winter. The mozzarella held it together but didn't contribute much flavor. Maybe another cheese would be more interesting?

I'm not sure why everyone was so crazy about this. It was okay. It's hard enough to get people to eat greens, and there are lots of better recipes that use them.

I have made this several times, always using fontina and Pecorino for the cheeses. Also I use Panko for the crumb topping. Rather than steam the greens in a pot, I wash them and chop the stems and leaves separately. Then I saute the stems with the garlic, and steam the chopped greens in a ziplock bag with a few holes poked on top in the microwave with the water still clinging to them from washing.

I really liked this gratin, despite the fact that I was afraid it would be bland. I doubled the amount of bulgur and went heavy on the bread crumbs greens, using all kale as that was all I had on hand. To give it some kick I added 1/4 t. cracked red pepper and 1/4 t. ground mustard. I served it with a light salad and even the carnivores enjoyed it.

I tried this dish with kale and chard with some chicken basil sausage chopped and added to the gratin - absolutely scrumptious. A great way to eat your greens and grains!

I'm sure my dogs will like the leftovers! you'd think by now I could read a recipe and know whether it will be good!

I just made this again and added some chopped vegetarian sausage (tofurkey kielbasa, it's pretty good) to the mixture before baking. This dish is plenty substantial and tasty without it, but if you want to add a bit more protein, texture and/or spice, or if you want to make it more appealing to hard-core carnivores (using non-veg sausage), it's a nice addition.

Does the bulgur go into the gratin or is it meant to be a side??

A great way to use up all of your greens! This recipe seems designed with CSA members in mind--who else would have two pounds of greens on hand? It's a simple but delicious dish that makes a great light meal with a green salad.

Even with all the really positive reviews, I was still surprised at how very good this was. A great way to make a really satisfying and tasty main dish out of all the greens we get from our CSA. I used a bunch each of collards and spinach and the proportions of everything were just right. I only modified it by adding some red pepper flakes with the garlic (in a bit less oil) and used about half feta and half some mexican melting cheese (it's what was on hand), and it was great. Though next time I might use some drained cottage cheese for less fat and more protein. Great with a side of roasted beets - the person with the sweet potatoes had the right idea, any sweet vegetable - carrots, squash - would make a great side.

Am I missing something? Are the greens to be eaten accompanied by the steamed bulgar, or is the bulgar to be layered and baked with the greens and cheese, which the title seems to indicate? It sounds good, but I haven't made it yet. Probably good either way.

As part of my new healthy living campaign (will it last until the weekend, I wonder?) I made this dish last night to serve along with corn, green pepper and tomato salsa and a baked sweet potato. It was much nicer than I expected! I did make some minor alterations - I used only spinach and omitted the parmesan cheese, substituting @ 100gm of diced Halloumi, a Cypriot cheese made with ewes milk that mimics feta's saltiness but has a texture more similar to mozzerella. OK - so it's basically garlicky greens with crunchy bulgar, as per a previous reviewer - but I feel it's a winning combination that can be put together easily and provides a great veggie main dish.

I thought this dish was a terrific vegetarian main course. It's an easy recipe to make and very flavorful. I doubled the bulgur to make it a bit more substantial. Yum!

Good and easy. I substituted feta for the mozzarella, as per reader recommendation, and it came out great. I think that with the mozzarella it might be tasteless, though.

I've made this several times as swiss chard is a year round staple from my garden. I substitute feta for the mozzarella - saltier and more flavorful.

This recipe gives exactly what was put into it. Greens that are a little garlicky, with lots of cheese on top. I wasn't overly impressed, but it tastes good. It's useful if you're looking for something quick, and nutritious (if not fattening).
