I give this recipe 4 forks thanks to all the feedback and suggestions from the other reviewers. I added 1 more egg, garlic powder and chives. I felt these additions lifted this recipe from OK to great. Husband loved it. this is a keeper.

This was a great base recipe and really easy. I followed the other suggestions and made a few of my own variations (added fresh garlic, scallions, cumin, cilantro...).

I tried to make this gluten free by using coarsely ground almonds instead of breadcrumbs and I thought it was only ok, but my husband loved it and had two servings. I used two eggs as a lot of reviewers did and it made it much more eggy tasting, but made it easier to cook. I think next time I might try ground pine nuts and some basil and make it more like a zucchini-pesto pancake.

It's hard in some ways to review this as is since I used so many of the additions other reviewers suggested: Added a clove of garlic, 1 1/2 red onion and onion tops, a couple tbsp grated parmesan, 1 tsp boursin, and 1-2 tbsp chopped orange pepper, as well as about 1/2 extra tsp of salt. Also added about 1/4 cup of flour, and the mixture was still rather wet. Fried in 1/4 inch oil, not sure it would have turned out as well if not somewhat deep fried. Turned out tasty, smelled especially yummy while cooking. Served w/dollop of plain Greek yogurt with a bit of the boursin stirred in. Good savory dish, really more like fritters than traditional "pancakes".

Made these for breakfast, and topped with light sour cream- a delightful change! Used panko crumbs, added a bit of 'magic dust' (dry rub barbecue),and tbsp grated cheese. Encore?? For sure! Will make great side dish for fish or chicken, too.

Followed the advice of others by adding garlic, garlic salt, a fresh red pepper, and asiago cheese to add to the flavor - fantastic! Also, we served it with plain, nonfat yogurt on the side and it was delicious!

I used leftover zucchini that I'd grated for bread, and so kind of eyed the quantities of ingredients. Also added garlic powder and pepper, and found these to be savory and delicious. My kids weren't huge fans, but my husband and I were. I used more oil than noted to get them crispier which really helped with the taste and texture.

This recipe was not what I expected. I think that if these pancakes were more deep fried then they would be better.

We loved these pancakes. I used 100% rye breadcrumbs to keep the recipe wheat free and it worked well. Delicious vegetable snack or side dish.

These were pretty good with the additions.....garlic,seasoned breadcrumbs, extra egg,parmesan. As the ratings say...liked it, didn't love it (2 forks). I thik I've made better ones in the past. We thought a pinch of cayenne would have added some depth. Nice to have when the zucchini is plentiful, and teenagers like it too.

I thought these were a bit lacking in flavor. I'll try them again using other sugggestions about scallions, herbs, cheese etc. Also, I stuck them in the oven after cooking them in the pan which made them more like souffles - I liked that effect.

These are very adaptable and easy. I used a little flour, two eggs, some seasoned bread crumbs... just use intuition to make a nice consistency. These and soup made a great meal.

This recipe has made me famous ;-). There is always such an abundance of zucchini at the end of the summer, people can get quite excited about good zucchini recipes. These were served as the vegetable with a homemade ravioli and meatball dinner. Hard to tell whether they liked the raviolis or the zucchini better. I used and additional egg and a little cayenne

It was easy and delicious. I reheated some the next day and everyone liked them.

These were really tasty. Made as recipe suggested. I was skeptical, but really tasty.

Thanks to all the cooks who suggested additions to this recipe. I added 2 cloves minced garlic, 2 green onions, 1 tbsp flour and about 1/3 cup finely-grated parmesan. I also used two eggs, beaten and store-bought bread crumbs (that 's all I had on hand). Needed more salt than the recipe indicated. Delicious, and a great way to get some zucchini into our diet (we're not big zucchini fans). Will definitely make again.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest things i have ever made. I am making this again and again.

I added some scallions and it was good. As is, this recipe needs quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavors. But it's a good one to tinker with. I'm looking forward to trying everyone else's suggestions.

I really like this recipe. Through experimentation, I have found that the breadcrumbs are really necessary for the whole thing to stick together like a pancake (it won't stick together when you just add flour), especially when you are substituting wetter veggies like spaghetti squash. I make these fairly regularly because they are a good way to get your servings of veggies in and are easy to bring to work.. My favorite is adding in a bit of garlic, shallots, finely chopped mushroom, cheese, and a little spinach to the batter.

I've tried many recipes, but this one compelled me to review for the first time. Simply put; it is outstanding! I too used shallots (1/4c minced)) parmesean (1/3c grated fine, mixed in not on top of) and due to dryness - two eggs lightly beaten with a splash of water. It is a meal in itself! It will be a mainstay in our household! :)

Good, but a little dry. I put cheese in too, that could be why. Next time, I'll leave the flour out, and keep the zucchini moist

We already have an abundance of zucchini in our yard, this recipe sounded interesting. Needed to add about 1 Tablespoon of flour and added about 1/3 cup grated parmesean cheese. Very Tasty, would make it again.

These were awesome, a big hit with everyone in the family including our 19-month-old! Very easy to prepare, though I had to add an extra egg to get the mixture to stick together enough to form the patties and then flip them. I also took some previous reviews' advice and added a bit of flour and some crushed garlic. A definite keeper!

The second time I made the recipe I used yellow squash instead. Sooooooo good. You cant go wrong either way!

I made many changes, incorporating an epicurious latke recipe into this one. I added some minced fresh garlic, freshly grated parm. cheese, a dash of sugar and a sprinkle of flour, and used both zucchini and yellow squash (only b/c that's what I had on hand). I served them topped w/ sour cream which was a yummy finish. I will make them again, but only with the additional ingredients.

I loved these! I didn't use breadcrumbs (didn't have any), but the rest was the same. I used a nonstick skillet and Pam, and they were great. My son ate 2 of them.

This was a scrumptious recipe that I would make every day if I could!!!! It is a great vegetarian recipe and a good recipe even for the omnivores!

I made this with a little minced garlic, chopped scallion, a little grated ginger, and some chopped fresh cilantro. FABULOUS!!! Also can use parsley if you positively loathe cilantro (I did, but it is wonderful in this.)

Very good. I used shallots and store bought bread crumbs instead, then sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top. Yummy! Thought they were a little on the salty side, next time I will decrease or leave out salt.
