Delicious soup, especially the next day. I used dried instead of fresh dill and no salmon, only because I didn't have them. Great for using my garden cucumber glut.

This was an ok soup--the smoked salmon and dill really added a lot. I made this for a party and everyone agreed that the chicken broth flavor was too strong. It far overpowered the light cucumber taste. I will use vegetable broth next time.

Excellent! I like extra dill, salmon and sour cream. I wish there were more chilled soups on this site - they are a summer favorite!

This is a very good chilled soup. I don't think I would want it as a main course, but it is a very interesting starter for a summer meal. As a starter it could serve 10 or 12.

Addictively delicious, this soup stands alone without salmon quite well. I served it warm and subbed sour cream for creme fraiche. I used the dill seeds from plants that had seen better days and may have added more than the recipe says. I can hardly wait to make this for a soup lunch for a crowd. It's a wonderful do-ahead and appears to be a cream soup but isn't. Yummy!

I was looking for a good starting point for a cool summer soup based on buttermilk to serve with some great smoked salmon that I had. I agree that one should not cook the cukes. I too used a seedless cuke, but grated it, then salted it to release the extra water. I used buttermilk, low fat sour cream and lemon for the base. Add some green onions and voila. Let it set for a few hours and serve cold. I realize that I completely changed the recipe, but it met my needs. (In other words, I completely skipped the butter, cooking tatoes and cukes and the chix broth.)

Still not sure that I like the cucumber cooked here, I prefer it added finely grated and left raw in a cold soup like this. I also noticed that the reviewers that didn't like it subbed the creme fraiche with lower fat products, so of course it isn't going to be the same. If you can't use creme fraiche, I suggest adding a thicker Greek-style yogurt or draining low-fat yogurt overnight through a cheesecloth to thicken it up, makes all the difference.

This soup worked wonderfully for a dinner party; several people wanted the recipe. The day after, however, the soup was truly outstanding. Next time I will let it chill overnight.

This soup was nothing special. I used low fat sour cream instead of creme fraiche. I find that the addition of smoked salmon is very important to the dish. It makes it a little more interesting. I don't think I will make this soup again.

This recipe works very well exactly as it is. I used creme fraiche as the tang works well with the dill and salmon. I recommend a strong smoked salmon to compliment perfectly.

WONDERFUL!!! We've made this soup cold in summer, warm in winter....Guests are always impressed - - the soup looks and tastes like a lot more work than it actually takes. The first time I made it I accidently added all of the dill at once in the simmering phase, and then put all of it into the cuisinart later. I think it increased the dill flavor - - which we prefer. I always do it that way now.

I also used fat free plain yogurt to cut calories. It is a delicate tasting soup and the salmon is a nice addition, but without the salmon, it is a great vegetarian soup if you use vegetable broth.

Very good. We served it hot and it was still great. It is a nice summer time soup.

It came out great. I cooled it in the freezer in a fraction of the time because I was in a hurry and it didn't seem to have any ill effects.

I preferred it without the smoked salmon. The taste of the soup itself was wonderful. Also, I reduced the calories substantially by using yogurt instead of the creme fraiche or sour cream. Good enough for company!
