Mine came out more like "Hint of Mint" than double mint. I guess it depends on the size of the bunch of mint that you buy. Still, it was a pleasant compote - I couldn't find kiwis yet so I substituted mangoes. Mint & mangoes go great together. This definitely wasn't a flop, but next time I make a compote I'll go for something else instead.

This was a simple, light and elegant fruit salad. I left out the bananas and used assorted melons, strawberries and kiwi. The doublemint syrup was very tasty and gave the fruit a little burst of flavor. The recipe make quite a lot of syrup though. If you use all of the syrup you will lose the flavor of the fruit.
