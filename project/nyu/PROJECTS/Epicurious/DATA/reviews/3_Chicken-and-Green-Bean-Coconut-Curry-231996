This dish was fantastic! I just added a few more chilis to make it a bit spicier. I think I made a mistake because I discarded some of the oil before the final step of sauting the mustard seeds and the curry leaves. I just used a new tablespoon of oil. The dish was very flavorful and a very big hit at my dinner party! I made the whole menu and the carrot dish really complemented this one.

While the recipe takes a bit of time, care and special ingredients, the spice mixture is to die for. I tried it with lamb and it didn't come out nearly as well (I think) because the lamb is so lean. The two times I've made it with chicken, it's been fabulous.

This recipe was a lot of work, but if you take the time to do it and search out the right ingredients from a good Indian grocer, you won't be disappointed. I actually thought it was much better than the local Indian restaurants, although it was very different. It seemed much 'fresher' to me. All of my guesst loved it. Excellent recipe.

The recipe wasn't nearly as complicated as I feared and I and my guests enjoyed the sweetness of the coconut along with the tang of the spices. My only problem was that the dish wasn't hot enough, so I'm going to add more dried chilis when I make it again.

Not worth the effort. Very little flavor- it did not taste anything like real Indian curry.

Not worth searching out the ingredients for this recipe. It had very little flavor and wasn't even worth doctoring, and I even used all the correct ingredients! Don't bother.

While I haven't made this recipe, it sounds delicious & makes use of common Indian ingredients & techniques. First-rate Indian cooking is not difficult, but it is procedural. Part of the delight is in savoring the smells & textures of ingredients as you cook. Those who want to explore world-class Indian cuisine should look at Yamuna Devi's (born an Italian-American)award-winning cook book, "Lord Krisha's Feast." And to others who share the "this sucks" opinion, the style & discipline of Indian cooking probably isn't for you.

It would be helpful if you could me more articulate as to why you didn't like it.

this one sucked-it took forever to make and was expensive to get prepared for. Never try this one on your own
