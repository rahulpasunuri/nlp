Although it's no Lou Malanati's this was really good deep dish pizza. The only change I made was I made my own bread dough (out of the old BHG binder for french bread - then you get 1/2 for the pizza and 1/2 for french bread!). It was really yummy.

We really liked this pizza, so thank you for posting the recipe. I would recommend chopping the tomatoes smaller than I did (in 8ths)- they were too big. Go for 16ths, or the suggestion of a whizz in the blender is ok, too. The pound of dough is fine- the advice that you just need to roll it out patiently is right on. I found it cooked faster than 40 minutes, but I suspect my oven runs hot. Very tasty, and pretty darn easy. Oh, I added cooked, chopped, drained spinach, too, plus 3 slices of provolone at the bottom for kicks- yum!

This recipe is wonderful. I drained the tomatoes in a colander, then pressed out as much liquid as possible. I put what was left in the blender, and it made a thick tomato sauce that was perfect for the pizza. It's also very important to let the pizza sit for awhile after removing from the oven. I only used 1 loaf of dough--you just have to be patient when rolling it out, then I let it rise while prepping the ingredients. The crust came out perfectly browned in my large cast iron skillet, I didn't use cornmeal. The cooking time was right on for me, and I'll be making this again.

My entire family loves this recipe. Even my three picky children. We can't find any pizza we enjoy better in our area. The only comparable pizza to this is actually in Chicago! One hint though I always use 2 loaves of bread not one.

EXCELLENT!! I was nervous about making this because of the mixed reviews, but it was great! I followed the recipe exactly and was extra careful about draining the tomatoes (used a cheesecloth - totally unnecessary). Tomatoes rather than sauce was a very good idea, and the crust came out perfect - only used one loaf of bread. It wasn't too thick and it came out nicely browned. Only difference was that my pizza was cooked to perfection in about 15 minutes - much quicker than the recipe said. Will definitely make this again!

We weren't thrilled with this. The dough was too thick and burned on the bottom well before the suggested baking time was up. The tomato sauce was watery, though that was probably my fault because I followed the recommendation of another recipe and used Muir Ground Peeled Tomatoes, which are impossible to drain. All in all it was more like bread with a watery topping. Too many corners cut, I believe. PS Semolina flour is better to dust pan with than cornmeal, which tastes raw.

This pizza was great. We were all fighting over the leftovers! I baked it on a pizza stone because I don't have a deepdish pizza pan, plus I like what the stone does for the crust. I'll be making this again for sure. We really like the chunky tomatoes instead of the usual pizza sauce.

This is a great recipe! We ended up using twice the amount of frozen bread dough to get the right amount of coverage in the pizza pan. We added thawed, drained frozen spinach for an added taste treat! I've made it twice for casual dinner parties and people think I bought it at a pizzeria.

I have not tried this recipe yet but I sounds very good and I will try it soon.
