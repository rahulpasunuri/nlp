After reading earlier reviews, I added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the topping and 1 tsp almond extract to the batter. Everyone agreed that the cake was a great addition to the brunch buffet.

I made this with fresh, locally grown peaches and agree with previous reviewers that you should definitely add more than what the recipe calls for. I doubled the recipe and used 8 peaches, but in the future would use even more. I also used a full stick of butter in the topping (2 sticks since I doubled) and added some almond paste. I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 65-70 minutes and when I cut into it, the cake was done and moist. I took it to a potluck party, but I bet it would be even better right out of the oven with a bit of whipped cream or ice cream!

With a few modifications, this EASY cake was very delicious! First, I added 4 oz. of almond paste, about 1/2 to 2/3 C of sliced almonds and 1/2 tsp. salt, all to the topping. I pulsed it only a few times in the processor, to keep some bigger clumps of the butter / sugar / flour mixture. Next, To the batter I added an extra 1/2 stick of butter, 1 Tb. of almond extract and 2 tsp. vanilla extract, and I used extra large eggs instead of just large. I used a 9" springform pan, buttered and lined with parchment. Baked it for 60 minutes, which was perfect. The super-ripe, juicy peaches were perfect to create an almost custardy layer in between the cake and the topping. Such a great, summery, homey dessert. Everyone loved it!

Nothing too exciting. Could make better options out there...

This is a great cake and very easy to make. Every time I bring this to an event I get asked for the recipe. I live at high altitude, and had no problem with the cake being undercooked.

Very quick and easy to bake!! Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Didn't have fresh peaches, so used peach jam and have since used raspberry jam with excellent results. Have also used thinly sliced pears with a little ginger in the batter. All very good combos and always rave reviews. Also good with blueberry preserves and then a little milk/sugar drizzle on top. This is a never-fail recipe for me!! Have even won a blue ribbon in the local fair with this one.

A great basic crumb cake, everyone loved it, though next time I might substitute almond flour for a portion of the flour -- needs a bit of a kick.

This cake tastes great - when you finally get it completely baked. This is the first time I've had a recipe on this site be so off. I baked for an hour and the tester came out clean. After it cooled and I cut into it, the middle 1/3 of the cake was raw! I ended up baking for another 50 min. Don't trust the tester test, bake for over an hour until the crumb topping is nicely browned, over the whole cake, not just the edges. I added extra cinnamon to the topping (will use even more next time) and a splash of vanilla to the cake. Use a springform pan, I can't imagine all of this fitting into a standard 8 in round pan.

The first time I made this cake, I cooked it for over an hour. The tester came out clean, but nonetheless, the cake was completely undercooked, so much so that it was inedible. I am not a novice baker, and could not understand why my cooking time was so far off from the recipe's estimate. My oven works well, I'm not in a high altitude... I just don't know what went wrong! I just made it again, using plums rather than peaches, and cooked it for an hour and a half. I also added rolled oats to the topping and increased the butter to one stick. Absolutely delicious! With the changes, the recipe works, but the original just didn't work.

Rave reviews - made it in a springform pan - delicious - wonderful texture. Bottom cake layer was almost cheesecake-like! Excellent as a coffee cake - will become a staple in our house.

I made the suggested modifications (increased the butter in the topping and used 4 peaches, thinly sliced), however I think I would have preferred the recipe as it was written. My topping was more like a streusel, not like a dryer, more crumbly crumb cake (which is what I would have preferred). I do not have a food processor, though, so I made the topping using an electric stand mixer.

Wow! I 1-1/2ed the crumb topping and baked it in a 8 inch springform pan and it was delicious. Needs baking longer than 50 minutes and the peaches need to be sliced thin. Next time I'll try chopping them and perhaps adding almond flavoring to the batter.

This recipe wasn't bad, just very average. Since I used peaches from my tree, I was expecting a delicious dish. Instead, it was bland and on the dry side. I plan to experiment with other peach recipes. This one goes in the trash.

This recipe is definately QUICK to prepare. I think it took me just under 15 minutes, so if you are in some kind of hurry, this one wont take up too much time. I agree that more peaches should be used. I wonder if it would be good if you put a layer of peaches down, then half the crumble stuff, then more peaches, and then more crumble? I will try that next time. Maybe with blueberries and peaches. It smells super good. Havent tasted it yet.

This is a very good basic cake. Try 1 stick of butter in the topping. I took this to an early morning meeting, hot out of the oven. Everyone cleaned their plate, so I would make this again.

This cake was totally delish and very easy to make. I used only 2 nectarines (sprinkled with sugar) and added cinnamon to the batter. Other than that it was easy and yummy! And- it is better refridgerated the next day and for breakfast!

This is a good, basic recipe versus a really "gourmet" one. I agree with the reviewers who were looking for more of a punch of peach in their cake. I would make again and add more peaches; perhaps tossing some small-diced peach into the batter. I like the idea of adding butter extract into the cake - very smart! Here's another hint: This cake tastes more flavorful when chilled, or a day or two after baking. Excellent for breakfast.

Loved the flavor;just added almond extract to make it have the flavor of French tart;I might even add MORE peaches, and let some be mixed in the batter.

When I made it I doubled the crumb mixture and sprinkled with 10x sugar. I also tried it with 2 cups of fresh blueberries mixed in the batter without peaches. Yummy AND FOR ADDED BUTTER FLAVOR USE 1/2 TEAS. BUTTER EXTRACT TO BATTER...

This was a wonderful, traditional coffee cake. I thought the ingredients were accurate and perfect for what it was - a crumb cake. It would be a great addition to any brunch.

This cake needs a lot more fruit and butter than the recipe states. A little sugar and lemon juice on the sliced peaches brings out the flavor as well. Real peach lovers would be happier with a cobbler.

I did follow the suggestions from Brooksville, NY and the results still didn't WOW me. Won't make again.

this is an old fashioned crumb cake that reminds me of my childhood. Absolutely the best!

Definitely follow the suggestions for extra peaches and butter. I've made this twice this summer to good reviews. It looks pretty when sliced and the main flavour is definitely peaches - the cake doesn't overpower the fruit at all.

I agree with the comments below. I added several layers of peaches and used about a stick and a half of butter in the crumb topping. It turned out to be delicious. Very moist yet light and fluffy. I am going to make it again and use apples, bluberries or pears.

Very good. This is the second time I've made it and I agree that at least 2 to 3 layers or peaches make the difference. The first time I used the recommended 3 peaches and the peaches pretty much disappeared. This time I used 5 medium peaches and this made it much more enjoyable. I baked it for 1 hour in a glass Pyrex 8x8 baking dish and it turned out great.

I've made this cake 3 times in the last few weeks. The first time, I agree with some of the reviews, the cake was dry as was the topping which had the consistancy of dry sand -- but I was encouraged because the flavors were very good. I determined the key was to 1) use more peaches -- 2 layers of slices about 4 (or 5)large peaches and more importantly 2) use about 1 1/4-1 1/2 sticks of butter to make the crumbs for the topping. As you add the topping, sort of rub it between your fingers to get a more crumbly topping. After the cakes cools, it's nice to sprinkle with a little confectioners sugar. The cakes prepared this way got RAVE reviews.

After reading such favorable reviews of this recipe, I was disappointed with my cake results. I increased baking time, as was suggested by different reviewers, and my cake and topping was dry. I found overall this recipe to be tasteless.

We thought this was great! I baked it in a 8 1/2 inch springform pan for 60 minutes. It was very simple to make and was as delicious as any peach pie or cobbler. It was very pretty too as I was able to remove the pan easily and show the cake! I served it warm with a little whipped cream on top which didn't hurt of course!!

I made 3 of these cakes today (1 to keep and 2 to share). Was time consuming peeling, pitting and slicing peaches but that's probably because I was doing in for 3. I baked for 60 minutes and middle seems fine on the one I tried. Cake was moist and good....tastes like a fruity coffeecake.

This recipe is great. It takes about 20 minutes to prepare. Definitely give it 1 hour 15 minutes depending on your oven.

This is a very good recipe for a quick dessert. I didn't have fresh peaches, used canned and it was still great. I think it should be baked a little longer as a previous review suggested. The peach juices did make it a little gummy in the center, but it was still delicious. This recipe is definately a keeper.

Very flavorful cake. A good base cake to use with other fruit as well. If questioning doneness, I would bake the cake a little longer. The fruit will add to the moisture. I underbaked it just little and found that the fruit made the center seem even more underbaked.
