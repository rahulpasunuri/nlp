I made this recipe 2 years ago for Christmas dinner for 30 -- doubled the batch. I live in Chicago and Christmas celebration is in Milwaukee. It travels perfectly...I made it ahead of time and baked it before I left in Chicago...wrapped the cassorole dishes in tin foil, then in newspaper and stuck them in a cooler for the hour and 1/2 drive. Perfect and still hot by the time dinner was served. The BEST, most flavorful mash potato recipe by far! It it simply delicious and has become a Christmas Potato Tradition! :)

I am not a chef by any means and was put in charge of making potatoes for a Christmas party of 30. They were easy to prepare and excellent! Made enough for 40+ servings and they were about gone. The true chefs of my family kept asking where I bought them...will definitely make again!

I have made these potates with everything from Turkey to Ham. They are fantastic with any gravy or sauce and can stand alone. A true crowd pleaser. We have 9 little ones to feed at family gatherings, all under 8 years old. All the children devour them including the one year old.

Made this for Thanksgiving because I was looking for a make ahead mashed potato recipe that wouldn't be dry. Read the rave reviews, and let me tell you, it's PERFECT!!! Because we had a large group, I quadrupled the recipe.At first, you think it's going to be too soupy, because of all the cream and milk, but adding it all, made the potatoes the creamiest ever! And the fresh sage, I had worried would be overpowering, after cooking and baking, became subtle and wonderful. The white sharp cheddar didn't taste too sharp in the potatoes, but just heavenly. (are you getting the picture that we loved this recipe??) I even had people who stopped by for dessert, who ended up eating double helpings of these potatoes INSTEAD! People asked to be able to take some home too! It was THAT good!This will be my permanent potato recipe for Thanksgiving. It's expensive because of the cheddar, but SO worth it. And it's the first time I was able to make mashed potatoes the day before, and have them be creamy instead of dry. Make it with confidence. You don't even need to make any adjustments. Perfect!!!

Wonderful again. This is a staple for us now at the holiday's. I add extra sage for more flavor and like it best with Horshradish Cheddar. I also cut back on the cream and milk. I use 1/2 cup cream and 1 cup skim milk. No one would know the difference - it still so rich. I love that I can make this the day before and simply reheat it while the turkey is resting for 30 minutes.

The amount of liquid (butter,cream, milk) mixture is too much for this recipe. Think about it, would you add almost 2 cps of milk in your normal mashed potatos? The flavor was good, next time I will reduce the liquids by half.

If you're looking for a dish that can stand alone, or stand up to all the delights of your holiday table--- this is it. I make these potatoes every Thanksgiving, and they are always the dish 1st to disappear. They also simplify timing for the meal, as you can make them the night before, and then oven reheat with the cheddar cheese. The texture does not suffer at all.

This dish was a big hit at a dinner party I had. The sage was unexpectedly good, and the white cheddar cheese was unique and delicious. I always use baking potatoes when making mashed potatoes, and it turned out wonderfully. Also, I used a potato ricer which made the potatoes light and fluffy. I will definitely make this dish again in the future.

The only modification I made was to use half and half instead of the cream & milk. A great do-ahead dish. It makes a lovely presentation w/the browned top and sage.

Made this tonight with Filet Mignon, Madeiros, mushrooms. Very good. I made two individual servings in large ramekins. The presentation was excellent and taste superb. However, next time I will allow them to cool a bit before serving. They were very hot, almost to the point of masking the taste. Definately company material.

This promises to be a regular addition to my burgeoning recipe notebook. Wonderful! Another great potato recipe and so different!One fourth recipe feeds two to three amply. I actually used two regular Russetts so probably they were a little under 1/2 lb. I used Vermont cheddar and put the potatoes back on the fire to get out the moisture before I added the cream and milk (2%). I mashed the potatoes with a masher in the same pan in which they boiles. Easy and good!

Rating: 4
I made this for a "Thanksgiving" dinner we had when my brother came into town in September...and it was a huge hit. I LOVED that all I had to do was reheat it on the day of our dinner! I am making it again for Christmas...I had read many of the reviews prior to making it the first time, and since many complained of it being dry, I left a small pat of butter on the bottom of the pan, and after reheating it, the melted butter helped moisten the potatoes. Also, I used all half and half instead of heavy cream and milk...which is basically the same, I guess! We also served them with gravy, which may sound weird but it was actually great together! Enjoy!

This was a wonderful potato recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone at the table went back for seconds (and some thirds!) I used a reduced fat white chedder cheese from Trader Joe's to cut the fat a tiny bit. It was still rich and delicious, both with and without gravy.

What a inventive take on mashed potatoes. A huge convenience to have them done the day before. The sage flavor is subtle and didn't offend the traditionalists. Probably too rich for everyday but a real treat for the holiday. This entire menu is wonderful, and the do-ahead instructions are extremely helpful for sanwiching prep time between work and other activities.

I was desperate to have mashed potatoes ready in advance for Thanksgiving. I still wanted the traditional mashed, so I did not add sage OR cheese, and these were a HUGE hit. Before baking I add 3/4 stick more butter to top and they were unbelievably moist and flavorful! 5 FORKS

Have made this a few times now, and always to rave reviews. I've never had a problem with dry out after baking. I usually add a touch more butter or milk to make sure it stays moist. The sage makes the taste fantastic.

This was a wonderful and decadent mashed potato recipe that went very well with the pork tenderloin and cider jus that I made for a small harvest inspired dinner party I had this October. I made the potatoes the night before and then baked them the day of. As other reviewers have mentioned, they were a little on the dry side, but about what a usual twice-baked potatoes consistency is. I would definitely make this again, but might skip the second half in the oven.

Next time and I won't "twice bake" these and therefore I won't add as much liquid. I think that additional step of baking is unnecessary unless yoiu are doing them in advance and the potatoes would have a better texture if you just mashed and served. I was disappointed that the sage flavor wasn't more pronounced. Otherwise, on the whole, they were pretty good and my guest loved them.

These potatoes are just killer. I have made them exactly as the recipe calls for with russets, and then I tried them at Christmas with Yukon Gold's. I preferred the Yukons, though the mixture seemed too wet at first, because after baking, it was lighter and fluffier than with regular baking potatoes. Nevertheless, it is simple enough to commit to memory and tasty enough for many future get-togethers.

Christmas dinner without mashed potatoes is heresy in our family, but the last-minute mashing is a real pain, especially in a crowded holiday-time kitchen. This is the only make-ahead mashed potato recipe I've found that's really spectacular. The recipe is also perfect as is - I make no adjustments. Everyone in my family loved them and wanted seconds, and as a result this recipe will now replace the traditional last-minute mashed spuds at holiday dinners. I was worried when reading the recipe that the sage flavor might dominate and therefore the dish wouldn't appeal to everyone, but the mixture of flavors is just perfect. None stands out; they all meld harmoniously. Delicious with traditional pan gravy, too.

Made these for a Christmas party. They turned out very well and everyone liked them. I boiled the potatoes first in chicken broth and added a bit extra sage as other reviews had sugggested. I made with the marmalade horseradish glazed ham but think these would taste even better as a turkey side dish because of the wonderful sage flavor.

Rating: 2
These are very good mashed potatoes and my family all went back for a sizable portion of seconds at a recent special dinner. My one reservation, though I will probably make them again, is that they aren't really exceptional. A healthier version of mashed potatoes is just as good. If I'm going to blow this amount of fat, carbs and calories I want it to be memorable!

Was a bit surprised to find these were more a cassarole than a mashed potato. When they cool a bit, they act more like mashed potatoes.
