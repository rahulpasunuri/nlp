I made this recipe despite the mixed reviews (and my lack of Japanese cooking expertise), and I have to say I was very pleased. I added extra ginger to the rice, used the clam juice, and substituted honey for sugar. I also bought the highest grade sake I could afford, and I really think it made a big difference. It was light and flowery and so smooth it was almost sweet. I recommend drinking a small glass of it while eating. I seared the scallops in butter because they are always delicious in butter, and I think the searing added a bit more flavor. For the citrus notes, I served the dish with a pineapple-mango salad (garnished with lemon and ginger zest and a little cilantro). It certainly cleansed the palette. For Japanese novices, I would highly recommend this dish.

Yum! I read the reviews and took advice for suggestions of adding more flavor. I put lots of ginger in the rice. I used a really high grade green tea. I used chicken stock instead of the clam juice. And I marinated the scallops in sake and soy sauce for about an hour before cooking them. I also prepared several bowls of garnishes that guests could use to add to customize the flavor of their dish, including sriracha chile sauce, wasabi, strips of nori, toasted sesame seeds, scallions, limes. It was a hit!

I'm a tad over excited about reviewing this. That tends to happen when you see a variation of your favorite dish just waiting for you to review.. But really, if you're unsure of this dish, consider tips below (yup, ingredients ARE important) and give it a few tries. My grandfather (the better cook in an elderly Japanese couple) uses these tricks sometimes when he prepares Tea Rice. Try marinating. I recommend plain soy sauce with perhaps a pinch of sugar for the roe, and a mixture of soy sauce and clam juice for the scallops. The tea needs to be left alone until quite strong. You should be able to smell its grassy/sweet/sometimes pungent/bitter-ness. If what the recipes calls for seems to be too much liquid, go ahead and leave the tea in the pot. The Japanese would often leave a pot of tea at the table when having Tea Rice, so the people who want more tea have easy access. And last but not least, having something citrusy around can appeal to some. A little juice can brighten the mellow taste, and if you've a penchant for the spicy, investing in some Yuzu Kosho is always a good idea. Replacing the wasabi with yuzu kosho is slightly unconventional, but soooo delicious.

A very Japanese dish that makes a delicious setting for truely superb scallops. You need perfect ingredients to make a dish like this. Don't bother unless you can get absolutely fresh scallops. (You might try it with medallions of lobster that you steamed in tea if you don't have good scallops). Get everything, except perhaps the scallops, from a really good Asian grocery. It is especially important to use the best tea leaves and salmon roe you can afford. Even when it is made with great ingredients, scallops in tea might be a little bland for people who put chipotle peppers in their mashed potatos-- Japanese food often disappoints Westerners. If you really want to taste scallops, you can't beat this simple presentation. Note: I always make a dish according to the recipe the first time out. Even though I was skeptical about the clam juice, I used it. Next time I'll probably use dashi and I think I'll julienne the ginger.

Had high hopes for this dish but was seriously underwhelmed by the lack of flavor -- mainly due to the green tea! Might try again in the future without the tea.

I thought that the clam sauce gave this extra flavor and a bit of a zing to the dish. I think you really must learn to savor any asian dish . At first you may not care for it, try it again you never know you might be supprised when your taste buds lenger a while. Not everyone appriciates asian dishes but if you try something new once in a while you will get used to them .
