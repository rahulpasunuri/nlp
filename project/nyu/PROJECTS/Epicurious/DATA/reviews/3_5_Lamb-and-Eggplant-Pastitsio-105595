this is really delicious. it takes some time to make it, but not difficult at all. My additions: double the garlic, added a couple bay leaves to meat sauce, and some cayenne for a bit of a kick. picky hubby liked it a lot. I recommend this one. Cheap, feeds a crowd, and yummy.

this is really good, 31/2 forks really. I made my own ras al hanout (recipe on this site) and spiked it with more cayenne. I added extra garlic, and a splash of white wine to the lamb mixture. In addition to feta, I also added a little white cheddar to the bechamel because I needed to use it, and a pinch of nutmeg. I baked it for 35 minutes, and under the broiler for the last 5. It made a lot. Great leftovers.

I'm rating it 4 forks based on the way I always put it together, though I'm sure it's as delicious as it is written! I've made this for years but the first time I made it I happily misread the recipe and only tossed the pasta w/ the cheese sauce--I spread the lamb eggplant mixture first in a casserole pan and then placed the pasta & cheese on top. It's like a variation of Shepherd's Pie that way and I've only ever made it that way since, though I now tend to double the lamb/eggplant portion(for more base layer).

This is my second review. Tonight I made the one I froze. I baked it at 375, covered with foil, for about 75 minutes, then removed the foil, turned heat up to 425 and cooked for about another 20-25 minutes, until the top had nice crusty spots. Although the pasta was a bit soft, the flavors were still quite delicious. I will definitely make again!!

This recipe is a regular on Christmas at my house. Delicious every time. The cheese sauce is especially yummy so I half again that part of the recipe to give additional creamy goodness to the casserole. I just throw in chopped garlic rather than fooling with removing the garlic clove/head. No matter how much I make, it all gets eaten up every time. This year, most of my guests took thirds -- the sure sign of a great recipe.

Not sure why some folks had their knickers in a twist over 3 pots plus a casserole dish, but oh well! Double the garlic and cinnamon and fish the garlic and clove out of the cheese sauce. Use good feta. If you don't have access to a Mediterranean market, there is a good feta available at Costco (Dodoni brand) Any tube pasta will work (like ziti), just be sure to undercook it - to less than al dente - because it cooks more in the oven. Use Japanese eggplants (the long slender ones) because the skin is more tender, hence no peeling. I love Greek food. I used disposable foil pans so I could make two (each for three people) and froze the other, so I hope it comes out well when baked from frozen.

Made it to the letter according to the recipe (without the clove -- didn't have one). Really delicious, although there are lots of pans to wash, but it is honestly better than the pastitsio we had in Greece!

Rating: 4
This was awesome! It required a lot of pots and bowls and so took a while to clean up but other than that it was easy. And I washed the pots while it was baking so it wasn't really a problem. I followed the directions exactly except I doubled the garlic, oregano, cinnamon and sugar. The ratio of meat sauce to cheese sauce was perfect and it baked up nicely in 25 min. Letting it sit for 5 or 10 minutes is important so that the top layer can really firm up. Greek food is my favorite and I am so happy I can make this at home!

Absolutely delicious, and so big it fed me and my boyfriend for a full week! 13x9 pan no where near big enough. I used beef instead of lamb to save some money, and did not find the flavor lacking. If you take this step, be sure to drain the browned beef - I did not and there was some excess grease in the finished product. I used more spices than called for (as per usual) and added about 5 whole cloves to the meat, which I fished out after it had simmered with the tomatoes. Will defintely make this many, many times.

Rating: 3
I halved this recipe and it fed 4 adults, 3 men and 1 woman. I will leave the eggs out of the cheese sauce next time. The baking step rather scrambled the cheese sauce into a solid mass sitting atop the meat and pasta. Thought the sauce thick enough without the eggs. Even with the layer of scrambled cheese sauce and pasta, my guys thought it was very good. so will make again. Plan to make the meat sauce a day or two in advance and freeze half. Both meat and cheese sauce are excellent on their own.

Rating: 3
This is delicious, and I don't mind the prep time and bowls/pans. I made it just like the recipe. However, I'd like a higher ratio of meat sause to cheese sauce, which is how I'll make it next time. Not more meat, just more sauce. Or maybe just less cheese sauce, with more of the pasta in the meat sauce.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and a great way to use surplus tomatoes and eggplant. I didn't have feta so I used parmesan instead and used brown rice penne instead of regular pasta. I also broiled the eggplant in large slices coated with olive oil and dusted with garlic powder before cutting into smaller pieces and adding to the lamb sauce. Family enjoyed it, said it was different, but went back for seconds, so it must have been good. Makes a nice flavor change from typical pasta or lasagna dishes. Froze one extra pan so that I can use it for dinner in a pinch.

Rating: 4
Wow! I made this today because I was craving pasta. I added a little more cinnamon and 3 cloves of garlic instead of one. The DH, who loves pastitsio, said this was better than the pastitsio at the Parthenon in [Greek town] Chicago. I agree.

Rating: 2
This was better than expected but does leave many dirty pots. I must have messed up on the cheese sauce because mine was not creamy in the final dish. However, the lamb portion was so good that I am going to make again as a lamb sauce alone for pasta.

Rating: 3
Quite tasty and, I thought, very authentic. (Reminded me of my vacation to Athens!) As others have suggested, I would increase the spices a bit next time; I had a real Greek feta, fresh ground cinnamon, and flavorful dried oregano, so I used the recommended quantities of each, thinking it'd be enough, but I would've liked just a tad more flavor. Used fresh tomatoes, since I have dozens right now from my farm share! I great way to use up a bumper crop of produce on a cool early fall evening. Served with Greek salad. Yum!

Rating: 0
Really good - though I used ground beef (my family doesn't like lamb unfortunately..) As suggested I divided into two baking dishes and only made 1/2 batch sauce for the first night. The second time I served it I didn't have feta so I used Parmesan cheese for the sauce, which was fine. I also added some pitted greek olives. My husband loved it!

Yum! I had to make a few adjustments according to what I had on hand, but this turned out great! I had to substitute cumin for oregano and tomato sauce for crushed tomatoes. It still turned out great. It wasn't too difficult to make, it was just the having three separate pots for clean up-- plus the casserole dish. I'd still make it again though.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Really worth the time and effort. I make enough of the base part to freeze then I just have to make the sauce fresh! Increase the seasonings as other recommend & add a pinch of nutmeg.

I made this last night as sort of a last minute thing, happened to have the ingredients on hand but used half ground lamb and half ground beef. It really surprised me as a wonderful dish I will continue to make a regular one in my cookbook. My only suggestion is to double the spices called for. The eggplant really absorbs everything and I like a well flavored dish. I also added a few pinches of Cayenne Pepper to add extra dimention. Instead of adding pasta to the meat sauce, I kept all of the layers seperate and really liked the effect. This really is simple to prepare - just time consuming on the stove so start early. Enjoy!!

This was delicious and easy to assemble. I used ground lamb from our local farmer's market, which can never hurt!

This dish was really delicious. I added extra cinnamon and oregano, plus some garam masala and red pepper flakes for an additional pop of flavor. I didn't mix the milk and feta mixture with the eggs because I didn't have any, but still turned out good. I did find that the cooking time on the stovetop was significantly less than in the directions. It took about 15 minutes for the eggplant to soften versus the recommended 40 minutes. Next time will add some fresh parsley and basil as well.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous and made abundant quantities to freeze for quick meals later. Tasted very authentic to me. It's all about the ingredients as usual, though. I used a slightly larger eggplant and "real" feta, not that awful pasturized cows milk stuff and used lamb not beef. I can understand why making it with beef or the americanized feta would be bland to some of the raters. One other change I made was to make 1.5 times the cheese sauce, using a full lb. of the feta to flavor it. I also used 1/8 t ground cloves since I didn't see any whole cloves in my cabinet. I used whole wheat penne and the flavor was a great compliment to the hearty dish but next time I will use a smaller whole wheat tube shaped pasta - just whatever small tubes happen to be available at the grocer.

Awful stuff - tasted like slichtly grownup mac and cheese. No flavor to speak of, even though I used much more seasoning than suggested,. Definitely not worth it, tasted like a 1950's dish, Ugh!

Rating: 3
Very hearty, absolutely delicious! A bit time consuming but in a nice way. Not sure if I was supposed to, but I didn't want to chomp down on it, so I removed the clove just before I added the cheese. Like a previous entry, I froze some of it as well - and it was just as good after re-thaw!

This dish is more like 3-1/2 forks as it's very delicious and an authentic tasing greek dish. Made exactly as recipe stated and it turned out perfectly. The prep is a bit intensive if alone but this dish is worth the work. Excellent the second day and also freezes well.

The lamb and eggplant sauce is very good. Instead of using the cheese sauce in this recipe I used the cheese sauce in the recipe for vegetable moussaka (another fantastic recipe) and it turned out great! I doubled the recipe for a large gathering and served it with salad and bread. Everyone enjoyed it.

We loved it and didn't find it labor intensive at. Minor adjustments: LAMB SAUCE - omitted cinnamon, added red pepper flakes and doubled black pepper. CHEESE SAUCE - Used minced garlic in place of whole clove and omitted clove. Divided into two baking dishes - baked one and froze the other. Delish!

Very tasty, and not at all difficult (better in pairs - one person should cook while the other chops and measures). The least appealing part of this recipe is the way it looks! The jumbled pile of pasta on your plate belies the complexity of the spices - I wish I could think of a different way to bring these ingredients together.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I substituted a combo of soy sausage and soy burger for the lamb and it was excellent. A bit time consuming and I used quite a few bowls and pans. Make sure to bake in a nice heavy skillet- cast iron or le creuset if you have it to get a nice finish.

This is a staple at my house. My supermarket doesn't always carry ground lamb, so when I see it I buy extra to keep in the freezer to make this. My few alterations: brown the meat first and add spices to the meat, eliminate the sugar (use a big, sweet onion instead)for the meat sauce;use a dash of ground clove (carefully - it can be overpowering) and finely mince the garlic in the cheese sauce. This is a bit labor intensive and you'll end up with a lot of dirty dishes; but I find it no more work than making lasagna and the results are far more flavorful. Make this, you'll love it!

My husband would give this 4 forks. It smells and tastes great. I mashed the garlic in a mortar and pestle so it dissolved into the sauce and removed the clove before I assembled the dish.

OMG, this is so good! I mad it for our Big, Fat Greek Olympic opening ceremony party. Everyone just lost their minds over it. One guest was not a fan of lamb, and she now wants the recipe. Next time I will not add all the salt. I thought I had ruined it after tasting the lamb after adding it. Fortunately the rest of the ingredients helped mask what I thought was to salty. Adding more cinnamon than you think is also a great idea. Replace the salt with cinnamon, that's what I say.

This is fabulous. I always make it with left-over leg of lamb, ground. Since there are just two of us, I make the recipe and divide it into 3 meatloaf pans. We cook one for us that night, and freeze two for later delicious, easy meals. This really is a great dish. Whenever we cook lamb, we make sure there is enough left-over for this dish.

What a wonderful accompaniment to Easter ham! I'd always heard this, but didn't believe it until today when my dinner included this wonderful dish. The eggplant lightens the dish making it even better than usual. Increase spices esp cinnamon but do make this wonderful dish!

This is worth the effort! The spices seem strange to American tastes but the flavor is great. Keep the eggplant cubes small so they will cook all the way. This also freezes well.

I made this last night for a Greek Halloween dinner with friends. I made the meat sauce a day early as a time convenience. It was delicious. I'd say it serves 6 generously but wouldn't count on it stretching for 8. I followed the recipe exactly and would definitely make it again.

This was really nice. When I mixed the two sauces, I was worried there weren't enough noodles and it seemed like too much liquid, but this cooked off considerably in the baking process. Turned out delicious. I mixed in some extra cheeses as well.

Neophyte cook here. Got to the supermarket; "We don't get lamb very often." Ground beef worked well. Was amazed at the subtle blend of flavors. That "clove" thing threw me too. Ran over on the time, but I figgure I'm a bumbling amature. Can't wait 'til the next time:)Here...sheepy sheepy...

I saw Sarah Moulton make this recipe on the food network and it looked wonderful. My husband doesn't like lamb, so I substituted hot Italian sausage and cut out the cinnamon and sugar, but left the rest. Of course this completely changed the recipe, but it was excellent, and all my guests rated this a "keeper".

Sorry, Teresa, Mousaka and Pastitio are two very different dishes. Both are served in Greece. They have similar spices and both use lamb or beef but Mousaka is not made with pasta. In Greece Mousaka is often made with both potato and eggplant.

This is a great recipe. I'd say, though, that the active time is closer to an hour unless you're a professional Ginsu knife demonstrator and can chop all that onion, garlic, and eggplant in no time flat. I also used quite a bit more cinnamon than what was called for, and a generous pinch of nutmeg rather than the whole nut. What are you supposed to do with the garlic clove once the cheese sauce is done? It never said (nor did it specify to chop it), so I removed it. Wonderful with a salad and some fro-yo for dessert!

This dish was incorrectly named pastitsio. The correct name for this dish is mousaka as seen in any greek restuarant and even by the definition in the food dictionary on this website: mousaka [MOO-sah-kah] Originally from Greece, moussaka is a popular dish throughout most of the Near East. Its basic form consists of sliced eggplant and ground lamb or beef that are layered, then baked. The variations, however, are endless and the dish is often covered with a BÉCHAMEL sauce enriched with eggs and/or cheese.

Oh yummy! My mother has made pastitsio for my family since I was little, but this was MUCH better (sorry Mom!) I used ground beef instead of lamb to appease my non lamb eating friends, and added a touch of nutmeg with the cinnamon. A huge hit!!!

After eating in Greek Town in Chicago for over 30-plus years, this is the closest I've come to duplicating authentic pastitsio...except...I omitted the eggplant and instead of 1/2 lb. feta cheese, I used 1/4 lb. and 1/4 cup grated romano. It stinks up the house a little more, but what flavor!!! Definitely a keeper!

There is a nationally known Greek recipe in Mpls. where I was introduced to Pastitsio as a child and I never thought I would make in my own kitchen a dish that was almost exactly like theirs. I thought it was great and I am making it a second time. Before no-boil lasagne people thouoght that was too labor-intensive also, but it was a dish you wouldn't make every day of the week. My whole family loved it!!

Rating: 3
My only substitution was beef for the lamb. Though I didn't find the preparation to be particularly laborious, I did think the final dish was a bit bland (think "school food"...yes, even with the cinnamon) and even a touch dry. I'd make pastitsio again, but I'd try another recipe with more (apparent) kick to it.

I resent spending the time one hour to make this bland dish. I normally woud try to tinker with the recipe to make it work but there are already better versions: http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=102153 Just add lamb and the pasta at the appropriate times.

This was a good dish. However, I probably won't make this again. There are pasta dishes that are just as good without the multi-step, fussy cooking process (that used half-a-dozen pots and pans) that this recipe called for.

This was fabulous. I especially liked the few crispy pastas on top. I used turkey instead of lamb and added some cumin. I don't think you should skimp on the feta cheese and using a flavored pasta is definitely a bad idea. If you use ground cloves instead of a whole, be sure to add JUST A PINCH (a mistake I made). But the dish was excellent.

I loved this recipe. Instead of using lamb, I used low fat MAVERICK ground beef. I adjusted the spices to my liking in the meat sauce, which included adding more onion and I may have added shallots. For the cream sauce, I used skim milk. I think I also added a dash of dry white wine. You could also add a splash of fat free half/half. The SECRET, is to smash a couple cloves of garlic, and RUB the pan THOROUGHLY with them!! After you add the milk, add the garlic chopped up! ALSO, I used VERY lowfat and lower salt FETA!! I loved it, as well as my neighbors- but my husband didn't like the cinnamon in it! ( not very cultural)

I made the lamb and eggplant pastitsio and although the result was quite fabulous, I was a bit confused by two of the ingredients called for. The cheese sauce includes "1 garlic clove" and "1 whole clove", but does not say what to do with either of them. Please advise.
