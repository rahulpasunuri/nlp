This was outstanding, and we're not huge fans of kale. I added a few slices of chopped bacon, and I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added more lemon juice and a handful of crushed red pepper. Maybe next time I'll stir in some ricotta, but the dish wasn't exactly lacking without it.

I agree, the kale added such a nice flavor to classic pasta, garlic, olive oil, cheese. I thought it might be another boring dish but it was unexpectedly great!

Had some kale that I needed to use and this recipe fit the bill. I did make a few changes though - I added VEGGIE bacon to the onions/garlic and then removed them after they finished cooking. I added veggie broth and white cooking wine to the braising liquid and later a bit of crushed red pepper. Before tossing the spaghetti with the veggies, I added back the chopped veggie bacon and added some zest of lemon as well as the lemon juice. Grated and shaved Grana Padano and mixed it in and topped it with just a few pieces of chopped avocado (inspired by Heidi Swanson's Spring Pasta recipe). Overall, it was a very fresh, flavorful dish. I used Barilla Plus thin spaghetti so I didn't feel guilty about this one at all! Will definitely make it again.

I just made this tonight for myself and the hubby. I had some kale that I didn't want to go bad and looked this recipe up. It was easy and tasty. I'm not much of a cook so I look for recipes that are simple to make and the payoff is big. I did modify it a bit for what I had in my house. I followed the recipe to the end, but I added browned chicken to the mix for the last 5 - 8 minutes and I put some chopped up tomatoes in the finished dish. I also used whole grain penne for the pasta. Hubby loved it. Lots of flavor.

I wanted to love this as kale is so good for your health. But it was NOT good. I always wonder when I see some 4 forks and some 1-2, but I have to agree with the low reviews on this one. I cooked it to the recipe, and the kale was too overpowering. Maybe I needed to cut it smaller, but I really think it's just way too much kale/pasta ratio, and not enough flavor from something else. Maybe bacon next time?

I love this recipe! Add a healthy pinch of red pepper flakes. So delicious, so simple.

I give this 2 forks as written and 3 forks as I made it, using several suggestions. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and doubled the amount of lemon juice to perk up the flavor. I also added pine nuts and grilled shrimp.

underwhelming. Strange dishwater taste. Pine nuts or similar would definitely help. But there is a much better recipe for pasta with kale and lentils here - go with that.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner. Didn't change a thing and it was delicious. I can't stop thinking about and am planning on making it again this week!

I made this with an even mix of kale, chard, collard greens, and mustard greens from my CSA box. The flavors mixed very nicely, and I added a tablespoon each of cider vinegar and chicken stock to the braise. I agree with others who suggested adding red pepper flakes and toasted nuts.

Braising kale is the way to go, and it tastes great on farro pasta which is how i like to serve it. I've also found that replacing olive oil with bacon fat really brings out the sweetness of the kale. And after you cook the bacon, you can chop it into bits and sprinkle it on top.

Just made this tonight! WOW!! It was great! Even my 3 yr old cleaned his plate! The only thing I added was a pinch of red pepper flakes - I like a little spice in my greens! I could see using these greens in many different applications: bruchetta , omelets, mixed into rice, etc.

I've made this several times and every time it's been 'Wow!'. I usually add a bit more lemon juice and i keep an eye on the kale so as to not let it over cook. Great additions are: a bit of pancetta or some toasted pine nuts.

Rating: 1
I agree with others this was underwhelming. 20 mins overcooks the kale and leaves it soggy. I am a kale lover and I struggled to eat it. There are so many other ways to enjoy spaghetti and kale separately that it's not worth combining them.

I don't know why I expected more. . .this is spaghetti with sauteed, limp vegetables. I like kale (here I used both kale and chard), and this is a fine way to cook it. I also like spaghetti with olive oil, garlic & cheese by itself. But together they are just ho-hum --in this recipe, the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. I used red pepper flakes, extra cheese, and extra lemon juice. I also drizzled white truffle oil, which helped. If I have more kale or chard to use up, I will definitely add bacon or sausage next time.

I made this as specified but next time I"ll add more kale, add about 1 teaspoon more lemon juice and halve the garlic.

This is a great recipe. I didn't taste the lemon very much; I think I may add just a bit more lemon juice next time. The recipe doesn't specify how much salt to add - in my opinion, it needs tons to not be bland (at least in my opinion). Make sure you add enough before deciding it does not have enough flavor. With enough salt and parmesan, it is really tasty. I drizzled just a bit of white truffle oil over the finished dish, and I thought it really added to it. If you have some, try it! I will make this again; it's a great way to use up kale from the backyard.

Kale is my favorite vegetable and I felt it was overcooked in this dish. OK for dinner, but leftovers were soggy. I added toasted walnuts at the end which improved the texture and flavor.

Kale always felt like chewing on tree bark. However, prepared this way, it's fantastic!

This is a pretty good basic recipe, but I found it to be a bit bland as written. The following changes made it a keeper: 1) added salt and a good amount of freshly ground pepper 2) added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick 3) increased lemon juice to juice from a whole lemon. 2 teaspoons of lemon juice isn't enough to taste 4) I found that I needed to add quite a bit of the pasta cooking water - probably at least half a cup. I also used a full box (14.5 oz) of whole grain spaghetti and there was still plenty of the greens mixture to go with it. It takes a little time to trim and chop the kale, but otherwise this goes together quickly. We'll definitely make again.

i made this for dinner--in fact i'm eating it right now-- and found it to be an easy, delicious, and cheap meal. the trick is in the 20-minute cook time- that lets the onions and garlic soften and sweeten, almost caramelize, and it makes the kale very soft. the lemon juice and salt can also make or break it, so make sure you add enough! i also tossed some toasted walnuts on top, and they are a welcome addition.

After making this recipe my husband and I were surprised it had been rated by all with 4 forks. I was excited to find a tasty & easy recipe that incorporated kale. Easy yes. Tasty...not so much. The sour taste of the lemon juice and kale did not mix well with the parmesan cheese and the spagetti was simply filler. We won't be making this again. However a nice mixture of kale, lemon juice & garlic does sound like a good idea for tomorrow night...

Pretty much unmeasured, love this combination, used leftover butternut squash in cubes once the kale was wilted and bright green. A lot of lemon juice and parmesan, fresh pepper and salt all helped. Very satisfying, simple.

I loved this. I used chard instead of kale. I also used half the garlic, as 8 cloves is excessive. Also, I chopped a bunch of orange squash and added it toward the end of the sautee step. It added a nice complementary color, flavor, and especially, texture. Perfect dish for the fall!

This recipe was awesome and so easy to make. When I made it the second time, I shredded the kale and it was even better (the kale clumped together the first time). Great for people afraid to try kale. Lemon juice is essential!

I really liked this dish- but my husband hated it. This is something that only people who love healthy vegetables and lemon juice will appreciate. It does not have much flavor- it is mild- which may be too mild for some and wonderful for others. I would make it again- if I were alone.

I thought I didn't like kale from experiences with it as a kid. So, when I read this article I thought why not. It is such a nutrious veggi. What a hit. This is absolutely delicious. My entire family loved it. Perfect just as is. I love kale...who would have thought!

Rating: 4
Loved it. I used more Kale than was required and it still cooked down to almost not enough -- will use more kale next time. I don't know if I agree with other suggestions to add pine nuts. I'm sure pine nuts wouldn't hurt anything, but they are expensive and rarely add much to a dish. You can't go wrong with the recipe as is. And it was very easy too.

This recipe is such a sleeper! How can such simple ingredients add up to something so memorable? Like the article's author, I had pretty negative experiences with kale. The dishes I made all called for cooking the kale, but not for long braising as in this recipe. It was exactly like eating grass. I concluded that, since kale is a dark green leafy veggie loaded with all kinds of healthful stuff, I could stand to consume it dutifully on occasion for medicinal purposes, but certainly would never eat it for pleasure. This recipe changed my mind. I've made it twice and it blew my socks off both times. I actually fantasize about it when I'm hungry! It's so simple to make and so satisfying. The kale acquires such complexity after the long braising---it's sweet, but there's a slight bitterness, too, tender but still with some crunch and body. The onion and garlic caramelize and get really sweet, and the zap of lemon juice at the end sets the flavors off perfectly---then, the salty Parmesan on top adds just the right note. I serve it with whole grain spaghetti. The slight nuttiness of the pasta pairs so well with the strong flavors of the kale, onion and garlic. I note that others have added pine nuts, bacon and other things. I'm sure those versions are very good but I think it's pretty hard to beat just as it is. I urge everyone to try this, especially the kale haters and those who regard the giant, green-black leaves with suspicion. I bet you'll be a convert, too.

My husband and I made this last Sunday for ourselves plus one guest. It came out really well! It seemed as though it was going to be an incredible amount of kale, but it cooked down to a fraction of its original bulk. We added a little bit of turkey bacon (unusual for us; we rarely eat meat) and it gave just the right amount of salt and fat. As another reviewer suggested, we used the entire box of pasta (whole wheat). A great way to get some kale! I'll definitely make this again.

Heavenly! We had a few slices of bacon in the fridge that I wanted to get rid of, so I first cooked the bacon, removed it when it was done, and cooked the onion, garlic and kale in the remaining bacon grease (instead of the olive oil.) Wow!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was good, but not terrific. I added a bit of anchovy paste to the lemon juice, and fresh ground pepper and red pepper flakes at the end. Added a needed kick. A bit labor intensive but worth it for this great vegetable.

Nice recipe for using kale, one of my favorite foods. I can't understand why this recipe calls for only half a box of pasta, though. The amount of kale and other ingredients called for would definitely support a full 16 oz. I paired this with Rack of Lamb and Roasted Figs from this site and a lovely Niagra Merlot...a near- perfect meal!

I made this dish exactly as the recipe states. It was so-so for me. I loved the bitterness and texture of the kale, but overall it was bland and dry. Next time I'll try adding red pepper flakes and pine nuts as previous reviewers have suggested as well as tossing it in a lemon garlic butter sauce.

I made this exactly as printed with one MAJOR exception...I was a little worried about trying kale for the first time so I used fresh organic spinach. However, it was AMAZING!
