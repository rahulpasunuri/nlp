This was a huge hit at a BBQ I went to. It's almost like french onion dip. Very good.

When made with regular onions rather than sweet, this is a spectacular replacement for the Lipton onion soup mix version that we've all grown up on.

This recipe is great on it's own or you can add other ingredients to it. I get rave reviews every time. Add 4 oz. crumbled gorgonzola and 1 cup chopped walnuts. Can also add 6 oz. goat cheese and 1/2 cup drained and chopped sun dried tomatoes. Another option 6 oz. goat cheese and one pkg drained chopped spinach. No end to what you can use it for as a base.

This is really delicious. I have made it twice. The first time I didn't use any cream cheese - just sour cream. The 2nd time I put an 8 oz. pkg of low-fat cream cheese with the sour cream, and I didn't like the cheesy taste as well. But it was still good.

Truly an outstanding Onion Dip! Served this at my annual "Super Bowl" party to rave reviews as one of several hors d'oeuvres. I followed the recipe to the letter. Took the leftovers to the office the next day wherein a number of my coworkers asked for a copy of the recipe. This dip is definately a keeper!!

Excellent! I didn't need the extra chipotle kick, so I left it out this time. I also pureed the dip, you could do this if you want a smoother dip. I'd say if you don't have creme fraiche, substitute more sour cream. I'll never buy dehydrated french onion soup again!

Delicious! I'd never had fresh onion dip before... only the kind with the icky seasoning packet. This was a million times better. I used regular chili powder and that worked fine. Next time I might chop the onions a bit smaller. Since it doesn't go into the food processor, the long pieces of onion are a little awkward for people to eat at a party. But very tasty!
