A new favorite for me. Wonderful hazelnut flavor even though I had to use less hazelnuts than it called for (thought I had more in the freezer than I did). I had some almond meal on hand so I just mixed that in. The frosting ended up being quite tasty as I had to keep adding frangelico to get the right consistency-probably more like 6 tablespoons.

One of my go-to recipes. It's not your classic cookie, but it is great nonetheless. I don't think they are ugly looking, but keep in mind they don't rise much as normal cookies,so when you place the dough on the tray that's how they'll end up for the most part. I would also be generous with the orange juice, it gives a great flavour. So delicious and addicting!

Oh, and I didn't think they were ugly at all. Deep brown with little flecks of nuts and a circle of frosting a little smaller than the diameter of the cookie and even darker in color than the cookie. I thought they looked quite attractive next to the paler cookies on the Christmas tray.

A little too salty. Not intensely chocolately or hazelnutty as might be expected, but intense in other ways. Very rich, but not very sweet (a good thing!). I couldn't possibly get the frosting to stick to the ccokies by dipping, so I spread it with a butter knife as did another reviewer.

It wins the ugliest cookie award but it is DELECTABLE...especially after a few days as the recipe suggests.

These are really great cookies. Very "Italian" tasting, in that they are not too sweet and are a bit on the heavy and dry side (but not in a bad way). I was really concerned when I first started putting the dough onto the cookie sheet; it was so crumbly and dry, I really didn't think they would hold together. But they did! I would say one of the keys is to make sure to make them small as they're very dense and have strong flavors (really no larger than a tablespoon). Also, with the texture and dryness of this dough, a larger cookie would probably be more prone to crumbling after baking. Last, I didn't have the liquor called for so I added the same amount in orange juice and a bit of vanilla. Very good.

This recipe was great. I left the cookie unfrosted and was generous with the orange and frangelico. They were very well received, even though they're not too sweet, especially as I hadn't frosted them. I froze half the batch and am looking forward to those later! Well balanced flavors, spicy and interesting. I agree that they were great after sitting for a day or two.

I loved these cookies. They were rich, nutty, and the pairing of orange, chocolate and hazelnuts was delicious. I only made one modification to the recipe, which was to add an extra tablespoon of frangelico to the frosting (which would have been too thick otherwise). I also spread the frosting with a knife over the cookies, since I found it rather thick to "dip" the top of the cookies like the recipe instructs.

I didn't think much of these cookies when they were freshly baked, but they improved a lot after sitting a day. Rich cocoa flavor and not too sweet.

Actually, "mostaccioli" refers to both pasta and cookies. In Roman times, these cookies were sweetened with the must, or mosto (as the name indicates), left over from wine production.

The cloves, cinnamon and hazelnuts really stood out which I liked a lot. I thought the flavor was intense and different which I can appreciate. And the end result with the icing was nice.

An intriguing cookie. Used Amaretto instead of Frangelico with no ill effect. Easy to make and not too sweet, But "mostaccioli?" It's PASTA! Even in Epicurious own dictionary.

Fantastic cookies if you're in the mood for a more sophisticated flavor. I didn't hesitate to serve them for dessert at a dinner party. I felt they were at their best on day 3 (another advantage if you're cooking for a large group--one more thing you can get out of the way ahead of time!).

These were a big disappointment! I think the orange was too overpowering. I brought them into work and one of my co-workers said they tasted like a health food bar. They weren't sweet at all. I would skip this recipe!

This is a fairly grown-up cookie - it's not too sweet. I was worried that the cookies would be too busy-tasting, with all the strong flavors going in, but the combination works pretty well. My cookies did not puff up very much, notwithstanding the description in the recipe.

I didn't have Frangelico at home, so I used rum and Cointreau. Didn't have cloves either so used cardamon and nutmeg...Turned out great! Not your ordinary cookie. Hopefully next time I make this, I have the ingredients from the original recipe.

anybody use vanilla or another type of extract instead of Frangelico?
