Got to tell you, I've done this twice and never caught the "CLOVES" thing. Like others, I thought they referred to cloves of garlic. And like another poster I just put minced garlic in the marinade. It was fabulous. I think I'll stick with that version - mix minced garlic in the marinade and skip the CLOVES! As they say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"

Instead of a rack I just used some double thick loin chops. We enjoyed the lamb although I thought there was a mite too much vinegar. Next time...

manhattan - the tomatoes are added to the dressing after 1/3 cup is removed for marinade.

How do you a tomato-mint dressing without any tomatoes?!? I must be missing something, given all the reviewers praising this dish.

Tim, thanks for pointing out the Cloves... My brain must be so accustomed to garlic cloves that it never dawned on me to READ the recipe. Still, I don't think I'll try this with the cloves. I'm sticking with tried and true in this case. Thanks for teaching me how to read, though!

Follow up from previous post - Oh, whole CLOVES -- not cloves of Garlic! Well, the garlic tastest great. Now I have to retry the recipe with CLOVES.

Great and easy dish. I never thought to BBQ rack of lamb. The marinade takes away that "lamb taste" that some people are turned off by. The only thing I don't get is how to press the closes of garlic into the bone. So I just chopped a bunch up and added it to the marinade. Worked just fine.

This is the second time I've made this dish. I marinated it all day. I served it with a mesclun salad with toasted almonds, grapes, apple and blue cheese with a dijon vinaigrette dressing and grilled new potatoes with a garlic, rosemary, dijon sauce. Dessert was also a BA recipe - frozen mixed berries with a white chocolate sauce. So much for the South Beach diet!

This was an excellent dish. Easy but delicious & makes a nice presentation.

This recipe is really easy and elegant. The only thing I did differently was to substitute the mint for some fresh basil and marjoram from my garden. Try to marinate the lamb longer if you have a thing about the "gamey" taste. The double chops cook fast. I served it with the Orzo, Feta Tomato Salad I found on Epicurious. What a hit! This is definitely one to serve to guests.
