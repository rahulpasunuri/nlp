Quick and easy, especially with refrigerated biscuits. I added peas as others recommended and it needed the texture and sweetness. I used whipping cream as that was what I had on hand. I may try adding half white wine and half chicken broth next time to bring out a little more flavor.

This was easy and tasty! I used boneless thighs and breasts (two each), poached them in a can of chicken broth, then shredded them instead of using rotisserie chicken. Then used the broth to make the gravy. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add a bit more flour and not put in all the broth and half/half because I didn't want the gravy to be runny. Used refrigerated biscuits too and added some frozen peas.

I make this often, and my kids love it. However, I do cheat and usually use refrigerated biscuits. It's my go-to recipe when I need to take a meal to another family.

I added mixed veggies to this. I placed the unbaked biscuits on top of the chicken/gravy mixture and baked 10 mins at 425, then 10 mins at 400. Used whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the required flour in the biscuits. Everyone loved it!

I would actually give this 3.5 forks. Very yummy and super easy comfort food. Perfect for a rainy/icy Sunday night in Chicago. Best biscuits I have every made.

THIS IS SERIOUS COMFORT FOOD. This is the 3rd time I've reviewed this recipe, even though I've made it many times. Each time I modify it a bit: this time I used only 2% milk (to cut a bit of calories and fat), and it turned out too soupy. Next time I'll add more flour to the gravy to compensate. Also increased the thyme and lemon juice by 50%. DO TRY THIS!

This was a great recipe; I made it for my roommates and the only change I would make is to make more gravy or use a little less chicken. And I cheated and used refrigerated biscuits :)

The first time i made this, I thought it was a bit thin; the second time, I added and extra 0.5 tablespoon of flour and heavy cream instead of half and half --- and it came out extremely well

This is a tasty, relatively easy recipe for a "comfort classic" meal. For people doing Weight Watchers, it's only 12 points a serving, as written - and could easily be reduced by substituting some ingredients.

I just used the biscuit recipe. In my opinion there is too much butter and liquid for the flour. Try 1/2 a stick of butter and maybe buttermilk for better flavor. Start with 3/4C and see how that works.

To those people that said that there wasn't enough flavor...I started by using a big TB of butter (rather than 3TB) and a package of chopped pancetta from Trader Joe's (1/4 lb). When it's all brown and delicious add some chopped rosemary and sage. Then add the veges. When they are almost done add a couple of cloves of garlic. Then proceed with the rest of the recipe. The reason that I give this only 3 stars...It is kind of a 60's dish. It's not light, but it is a comfort dish.

This recipe was really good! Unlike some posters, I appreciate the suggestions and substitution ideas posted here. After all, cooking is a creative sport! I added peas and served it over mashed potatoes like another reviewer suggested, and it was really good! I served biscuits alongside, as my kids prefer to eat them that way. A keeper!

I LOVED this! It is pure comfort food. I made it as directed with one slight excption; I used whole cream instead of half-and-half. It was a beautiful consistency before I added the cream but, after adding it, the sauce was really thin and took maybe 8 or 10 minutes (not 3) to cook to a nice consistency. So, in the future, I would only use 1/4 of cream or half-and-half. I used lemon juice but don't think it's critical to the recipe's success. Based on the reviews, I skipped the biscuits and served it over mashed potatoes. So good!!!

Very quick and yummy meal. I used pillsbury grands biscuits from a can...and then added peas and white wine to the chicken/gravy. It turned out to be a delicious, comforting meal. I will make again!

Based on other recommendations, I included one diced potato and some frozen peas with the other veggies and increased salt. I let the chicken and veggies simmer in the broth for much longer to let the flavors meld and the chicken soften - then added half and half. Made biscuits with heart healthy bisquick. We thought it was a pretty tasty dish.

Made the biscuits according to recipe: too much milk--needed extra flour. Poached chicken and made low sodium broth. Nothing special. I noticed my guests were adding more salt. I'll continue my search for a more tasty recipe.

This is a great quick recipe. I didn't take the shortcuts though. I made a different biscuit recipe. I had no celery, but used 2 carrots and frozen chicken tenders. I just sauted the carrots, onion and chicken in some butter. I deglazed with some white wine. I then added the flour and thyme (I had dried on hand). Added the chicken stock, reduced until it started to thicken then added whole milk. I reduced further to the desired consistancy. Served them up and they were great.

I have made this MANY times, and the first time I reviewed it, I only gave it 3 forks. Now that I have perfected the texture of the biscuits for our altitude, it is a 4 forker. I want to try adding raw shrimp instead of chicken at the end. This sounds really good to me--has anybody else tried this???

I made this last nite for dinner and to be very honest i will never make this again there was absolutely no flavor and it was just not to my liking i personally thought i wasted a good couple pounds of meat that should be made in a nursing home.

This was SO good and EASY to make! I doubled my carrots, celery, added a minced clove of garlic and upped the thyme to 3/4 tsp. Also instead of finely chopping my ingredients I cut them into a small dice. The biscuits turned out perfect for me.

Made this last night with a few changes based on the reviews. Poached a chicken breast, added diced potatoes and peas. Used plain milk instead of half and half. And used Bisquick for the biscuits. It was really excellent! Tasted like a really good chicken pot pie. I will definitely make this again!

We had a rather dried-out rotisserie chicken and this was pretty much a desperation dinner. What a wonderful surprise--it is truly delicious! I took several shortcuts, using good-quality frozen biscuits, light butter, fat-free half and half--whatever was in the refrig. No matter, it was great anyhow! I can only imagine that the full version is very special. This is a new staple at my house.

This was SO delicious and and simple. I didnt add the half-half cause I didnt have any but I cant imagine it would make it taste any better. I also dumped 3/4 of a cup of wine it at the end and used half a tangerine instead of lemon. Will def make this over and over again!

Excellent dish. I had it with cornbread biscuits - just fabulous. Very rich and satisfying.

This was very easy and so yummy. I agree with others that a different biscuit would be better. Next time, I'd buy ready- made.

Awesome, great and simple! Added peas as others suggested, and doubled the amount of carrots. So fast and yummy...and bought biscuits from a nearby bakery (and I don't feel bad about it)!

I would make this again, but would use a better biscuit. We also thought it needed more carrots, and I would add some peas next time. Overall, a very tasty, easy dish.

This was fantastic. The hubby loved it, and so did the kids. Plus, its very simple and fast, so its a perfect weeknight meal. I will definitely put this one into our rotation!

I gave this four forks because of it's goodness AND simplicity. It's often hard for me to find something that my whole family likes without spending a lot of money or spending a lot of time over the stove. This fits the bill perfectly. Like some other reviewers, I used store-bought bisquits (Pillsbury in a can) and half the onion plus a 1/4 tsp dried thyme instead of fresh. I added a little more flour for a thicker sauce. Next time, I'll add frozen peas and maybe use whole milk instead of half-and-half to reduce fat. It's sooooo good just as it is, though.

If I could, I would give this 3-1/2 forks. Nice to have such a GREAT tasting recipe that isn't so very much work, as some of the Epicurious recipes can be. Followed the recipe exactly except to sub dried for the fresh thyme and use slightly more veggies. Next time I'll use less milk in the biscuit dough because my dough was so gooey that I had to keep adding more flour to get a decent consistency. Tasted good, though. GOOD JOB!!!

My family loved this! The biscuits were great and easy. Like previous reviewers, I doubled the vegetables, added shitake mushrooms, lots more fresh thyme, and wished I had doubled or even tripled the "gravy". But this recipe is so flexible, it's easy to make it your own. And the best part... I made everything but the biscuits the day before. Easy.

The biscuits were absolutley horrid! Store-bought would have to be better.The chicken with gravy was good, but it needed something. Perhaps a splash of white wine after the veggies had cooked??? Hey, it smelled great!

Made this last night and it is basic comfort food. Tasted just like chicken pot pie. I increased the vegetables, added potatoes and peas and cut the fat. I used "Heart Smart Bisquick" w/ 2% milk. I sauteed the vegetables in one tablespoon butter and increased the broth to make more gravy, and added more flour to thicken it. It was yummy!

This was very good but very rich. I just bought the frozen pillsbury biscuits and used those since I was already using the rotisserie chicken and thought it was easy and good. My family loved it.

Tasty. This was my first time making biscuits and they didn't turn out so well, but the chicken and gravy was yummy (and very rich). I'd probably prefer that as a filling for a pot pie-type of meal next time instead.

Yes, it was indeed a comfort dish. I love the recipe for the biscuits!

I felt like I was making a recipe from the 1970's but I still really liked it! I doubled up the celery and carrots which I thought was necessary. Next time I might throw in either a little fresh dill or some tarragon instead of the thyme just to see the difference. Either way I'm sure it will be still be good for a cold snowy Sunday meal. True comfort food (and from Gourmet too!)
