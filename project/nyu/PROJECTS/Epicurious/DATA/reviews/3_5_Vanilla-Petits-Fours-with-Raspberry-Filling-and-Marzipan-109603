This was alot of work for something tasted just okay. I substituted Drambouie for Cogniac, but other than that followed it to a T. Very disappointed.

I made it for my friend's wedding and everyone loved it. I used apricot preserve in place of raspberry and somehow managed to get 48 pieces. I also used a fondant glaze instead of the store bought poured fondant. The marzipan was the toughest part of the whole process, it took a lot of elbow grease to roll out two tubes. I added their initials using butter cream, it came out gorgeous wish I can upload a picture. A keeper!!

I made it without the marzipan for my 4 year old's princess themed birthday party. I made half a batch with the raspberry and half with a buttercream filling. I'm not a fan of fondant, so I dipped each petit four in white chocolate (technically, pink almond bark). They were delicious, and it was much easier than I thought it was going to be.

Beautiful and delicious. I had no problems with this recipe and everyone raved!

The cake was fabulous -- easy to make and work with and had excellent flavor. The cognac and raspberry also worked nicely. This was, however, my first experience with ready-to-use fondant, and it was beastly. After the first few came out neither looking or tasting good, my friend and covered half of them in ganache and half in marzipan, and they were quite delicious.

Your butter solids may not sink to the bottom of the pan, so don't wait for them to fall or you may end up with burnt butter.

After hours of work, not to mention the expense, I could not serve them. Fondant would not run properly and was so heavy that when I finally got it on the cakes it pulled them over and they looked terrible. I used pre-made fondant - was this my mistake?

Be prepared to tweak this a little, it's great w/polmer's allfruit rasberry, and brandy in the simple syrup for the layers. Had to do the cake twice, couldn't get the layers cut evenly, and the fondant recipe I used (didn't want to go back to the store for the instant stuff) had to be reworked because of the humidity. After all that they came out absolutely gorgeous- cheated and used candy flowers on top, which softened in the icing to a perfect bite.If I HAD done the royal icing, w/the heat and humidity it would have bled into the fondant anyway, a fact I realized later. Had to almost double the sugar in Gale Gand's recipe to get it to cover well, but after all that it was a 'piece of cake' (sorry, couldn't resist)
