Followed the recipe exactly, except halved the meat only because it's all I had. It turned out really great! So hearty and the broth was amazing.

My Ukranian wife says that this borscht is not Ukranian, but is much much better than what she ate growing up. I love the no sugar / no cabbage part. Notes: * I used a giant celery root, an extra beet, an extra onion and, doubled the amount of potatoes and carrots. I used an extra pound of shortribs (3lb total but thinking about increasing next time). I also added 6 liters of water (recipe only calls for 3 quarts) and the soup was very thick. * I replaced the all spice with thyme and peppercorns. Excellent. *Do NOT wash the pot before beginning to cook the root veggies. Keeps the good juices there. * I saved the onion and carrot from the meat for adding back in later (though next time I will remove most of the cloves from the onion). * As noted below, add the tomato paste just after root veggies. * I added the beef at the very end and simmered for 5 more minutes before shutting off.

My late mother-in-law was GALITZIANA, and her recipe (except for the butter and allspice) was identical to this. They used all root vegetables. She likened it to the "stone soup" of our colonial times. whatever was harvested went in. just make it, enjoy it and don't worry about anyone else's idea of authenticity.

Billy made this a couple times after he lost the recipe our friends in Ukraine gave us. It was great, and we followed instructions from our friends to add a little water and extra cabbage and dill after the first day. It was even better the 2nd day

This was my first time making borscht and my family loved it!! I modified the recipe by using thyme instead of allspice. I also skipped the celery root. Next time I make the recipe I plan to reduce the amount of short ribs and oil because the recipe was a little too fatty for my taste.

This soup is amazing. It took about three hours from beginning to end, but it was worth it. I substituted bay leaves and peppercorns (as another reviewer suggested) for the allspice, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. The stock alone made my kitchen smell incredible, and the soup itself turned out both delicious and beautiful. The red of the beets with orange pearls of oil from the meat, topped with white sour cream and green dill and parsley. Beautiful! As for claims to its "authenticity", I've seen borscht prepared in so many ways that I don't see how any one way is "correct". What's important is how it tastes! Also, though it takes quite a while, it's a good chance to unwind, chop slowly and enjoy the smells.

I have made this soup several times and it has always received rave reviews. It's time-consuming, but enjoyable to make if you enjoy cooking. I made this for someone from the Ukraine, and he said that this was very close to what his mother makes, so it must be pretty authentic. In any case, I highly recommend it. It's become one of my standards.

This takes a bit more planning to make than other borschts I have made, but it is so worth it!

I am grateful to the several cooks who noted that the recipe does not say when to add the tomato paste. The directions also don't say when to add the cubed meat to the soup. I suppose it goes in with the broth, potatoes, and beets. Too bad the recipe wasn't edited before it appeared, but I'm happy to see it at all. It resembles the one I used for a long time, from an Armenian cookbook I lost about forty years ago.

I changed this recipe considerably to make it more "authentic" and it turned out fabulous. I replaced the allspice berries with 10 pepper corns and 2 bay leaves. The beets were roasted without the aluminium foil. I don't think the foil is necessary and I cut it out for environmental reasons and because they're easier to handle that way. I did, however, add a cup of water to the beets, to ensure they don't burn. I replaced the parsnip and turnips with half a cabbage, shredded in the food processor. Finally, I added three ripe, finely diced tomatoes at the end, along with the dill and parsley.

This soup is excellent, making a very satisfying lunch or dinner on a wintery day. I found it was not necessary to strain the soup after boiling the broth. I just removed the bones, carrot, etc., sauteed the vegetables and added them to the pot (simpler). I added a touch of honey to balance the lemon and bring out the sweetness of the beets. I also found it helpful to let this soup cool and remove the layer of fat that condensed at the top before eating - makes it healthier. Freezes very well.

As the previous reviewer mentioned, this recipe cannot be called borscht, much less a traditional ukrainian borscht. And I know, I have grandparents and other relatives living there, whom I visit regularly, and nowhere would you see a borscht that includes the aforementioned ingredients. Allspice? Come on! You NEVER see that in Russian/Ukrainian/Slavic cuisine. And borscht never includes parsnips or turnips. Overall, the soup tastes good, but it is not a borscht... Sorry guys. Giving it three forks only because my husband made it and it turned out pretty good, but without that authentic flavor.

The title is misleading, this is not a traditional Ukrainian borsch at all. It is a reasonably tasty soup(comes out more like a stew), but it's not accurate to describe it as borsch, and there's too much work. Allspice, celery root, parsnips, and turnips!? Very atypical ingredients for Ukrainian borsch. There is another better borsch recipe on this site, the beef bortsch with sour cream recipe, i believe, which does much better justice. In closing, this recipe is ok, but you would be better off choosing a simpler more traditional Borsch recipe.

Wow, this is the recipe I've been searching for! Wanted to copy the Ukrainian Borscht I've been eating at NYC's Veselka for years. This recipe was time-consuming to make, but it's worth it. Next time I will double it and freeze half. I subtituted a few ingredients, but it came out just the way I wanted it. Fabulous!

This seems like a quality recipe--close in style to the one my family makes (and we're from Russia). They forgot to mention when to put the tomato paste in; you should do it after the step "Add cubed celery root, parsips, turnips and carrot. Saute 5 minutes." After you saute for 5 minutes, stir in the tomato paste and saute for another minute before adding the rest of the ingredients. The saute process brings out more flavor depth from the paste.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always good. Very hearty comfort food! You might want to decrease the water and add more beef. A very good fall/winter soup. Serve it with a good crusty bread and top quality butter.

Great recipe! (although I also didn't understand when to add the tomato paste so I left it out). I served it for Easter lunch, followed by potato pancakes with smoked salmon. Very good.

We just made this soup for a group of 17 and everyone loved it. The only thing we did differently was to brown the meat in the pot (in several portions) before adding the water (based on one of the other borscht recipes in the file), which may have enhanced the meat flavor. We don't think it needs more meat or less liquid- it was quite a thick soup.

It irks me when recipes miss steps. When do you add the tomato paste? I can figure it out, but c'mon!

I love no sugar borschts and this one has good flavor

The basic recipe is great, but the next time I make this, I will add more meat for flavor and lessen the amount of liquids. This would intensify the flavors.

This was very good borscht but the broth was too thin and the amount of meat was too little. Next time I'd cut the amount of water and add an extra pound of flanken. Aside from that, it was wonderful, good enough to serve to company.

Made for a gathering of 30 people. I enjoyed it and had other good comments
