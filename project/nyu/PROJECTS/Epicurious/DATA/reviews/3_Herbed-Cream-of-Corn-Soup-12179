Good soup but leave the solids in for texture. I had to add one more cup of corn and more parsley to move away from the milky taste.

I wish there was a rating lower than one fork. This soup made us all nauseous. The idea of pretty much drinking half and half is still making me sick. I cannot believe anyone would invent this soup. It tastes so raw...and yes, I used cooked corn. Ugh.

This soup was delicious! It took awhile to strain the corn through the sieve but it was well worth it. I served it as the first course for Christmas dinner and all my guests loved it and wanted the recipe.

Loved this soup. We also alternate this with the roasted red pepper soup-putting one soup in 1/2 of the bowl and this soup in the other half. It makes a great presentation and an eatery here does that and calls it painted desert soup.
