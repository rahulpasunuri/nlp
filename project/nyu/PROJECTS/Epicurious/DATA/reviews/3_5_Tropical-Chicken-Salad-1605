I have tons of spearmint in my garden and needed a new use for it. This recipe gave me an idea on using mint with chicken in a salad for lunch. I mixed cubed papaya, rotisserie chicken cubes, and 2 tablespoons sliced mint. Tossed it with oil and raspberry vinegar and it was fabulous. If I added walnuts, it would have even been better. I'm making this recipe exactly as written next time because all of the ingredients I omitted are delicious. Mint was something I never thought about using in salads.

This is a great way to serve chicken salad as a summer lunch or picnic item. Be careful not to over mix it...and add the raspberries last, toss them, don't mix them in too much otherwise they will get smashed and you lose the presentation of this dish. Also, I did not mix in the greens, again, you get a better presentation if you serve the chicken salad on a bed of tossed greens.

Fresh fruit, greens, mint, berries, and some grilled chicken. What's not to like? It's light and refreshing and a great change of pace. Enjoy a glass of white wine alongside, and feel the rat race disappear for a few precious moments. I'd recommend this for a romantic evening, but it works equally well for a family meal.

EXCELLENT. Because of what we had in the house, we subbed a green apple for the papaya and pecans for the walnuts and it still tasted great. I don't think it matters much how you prepare the chicken. We broiled it with a little soy sauce and it was great.

This was not the type that I had In mind- maybe next time I will read the reviews before making a dish.

I poached the chicken in the microwave to keep the kitchen cool. I put a little soy sauce, ginger, garlic and brown sugar in with it. I love the nuts in the salad.

Delicious, light salad....will definitely make again! I couldn't find papaya but the salad was wonderful, even without it!

Yummy summer salad. I don't care for papaya, so I'm looking for another tropical fruit to use it its place...
