This was a super easy and quick meal to make for a date night. I used tilapia instead of Catfish and queso blanco instead of feta.

I LOVE these fish tacos. I use Tilapia instead of catfish but do everything else exactly the same and they're delicious.

Perfect as printed. Succulent. Nice depth of flavors.

These are easy and very tasty, although I did make some changes. I cooked the fish slightly differently than specified with no detrimental effect (no marinating; baked at 400 degrees on oiled pan for 10 minutes). Reduced lime slightly as others had suggested. Used cheddar instead of feta (as it was what I had available). My daughter was craving a chipotle mayo, so I whipped up a small batch (mayo, a bit of chipotle in adobo, fresh lemon juice in a mini-chopper). Also offered sour cream. Oh yes, added chopped cabbage. A winner.

Delicious guacamole recipe and catfish is the perfect fish for these tacos, cooks quickly and is very inexpensive.

Was awesome. Used muenster instead of feta and poured the cooked lime juice over the top. Yum.

I make this recipe all the time. I use basa fillets, which are common in the supermarket both fresh and frozen, and have a mild taste. love it.

I knew better and I did it anyway! Too much lime. Not enough jalapeno. Broiling catfish is a poor choice; the filets have way too much variation in thickness. Feta cheese does not go with catfish IMO. And finally, it's only about a million times better if you fry the corn tortillas. Hubby didn't like it either.

Excellent fish tacos. Would give it 3.5 stars if I could. The flavors tasted really fresh and I made some more of the salsa to use on eggs tomorrow morning. I had to broil the catfish a bit longer (more like 10 min) for it to cook through though.

I used tilapia & tripled the recipe for a group of 12. They were a big hit.

This was delicious even though I omitted the jalapeno chilies. Would definitely make again.

I've tried a few fish taco recipes, love this one best, didn't have green onions, used red onion.............easy, fast and healthy.

I made the recipe with mahi mahi. The salsa needed salt and more of a kick to it but it was good

This was very good and very healthy. My very skeptical husband ate every bite and asked for more!! Recommended!

Made this with tilapia and it was delicious, even though I forgot to add the feta. My boyfriend liked it but thought it had too much cilantro. I might reduce the cilantro by 1 TB next time, but I'll definitely make this frequently. Does anyone have any suggestions for other fish one might use? Preferably fish heavier in omega-3s but still low in mercury.

This recipe was one of the best that I've made from Epicurious.com! The flavors blended well and tasted wonderful. I was a little bit skeptical about the feta cheese, but it worked very well. I will make the tomato and avocado salsa again by itself and serve it with tortilla chips. Cannot recommend this one enough!

Very good- I would tone down the lime a little next time. I added more avocado than what it called for and it was PERFECT!! Just a tiny bit too "limey".

This is so simple and so good. Great for a weeknight when you don't have tons of time to cook. I use cilantro and onion in the fish marinade too. I can never get enough cilantro. Also, I get butter or boston bibb lettuce instead of curly leaf.

I thought these tacos were delicious. My husband thought they were too wet. I used the pre-seasoned cajun catfish from whole foods and a pepper jack, colby, muenster cheese mix.

This is a house favorite now. I added some garlic into the salsa too. Definitely use the feta! We use the salsa on everything else too! Very good.

We loved these tacos. We eat a lot of tacos usually using leftovers but these we made special and they were absolutely delicious. I usually don't like fish but this recipe makes it easy to eat. Delightful.

We LOVED this recipe. I actually don't like fish but know it's good for me so I branched out and made this. I used Tilapia instead of catfish as it's more mild. I would not add the extra squeeze of lime at the end because it's just a smidge too much. I've shared this recipe with others and have been told it's the best fish taco recipe they've ever tried.

I didn't much care for this recipe. I used flounder instead of catfish. I might have liked it better if I had used grouper or mahi mahi. The avocado salsa was wonderful, the feta cheese didn't do much for me.

Great light recipe. The flavors go excellent together. The feta adds a nice touch as well as the garlic. Everyone that has eaten this has loved it and wants me to make it again.

Fantastic recipe! I also replace the lettuce with cabbage, also for preference. I also added a spiced sour cream sauce that I got from another site. Great base recipe for amazing fish tacos.

This may well be the best recipe for fish tacos that I've ever tried, and I've tried a number. I, like others, substituted tilapia because it was available. Worked beautifully. The only other change (other than not being scared of a little more jalapeno than prescribed) was to substitute savoy cabbage for the lettuce which is something I've come to prefer. I was skeptical of the feta but am now a believer. This is a definite keeper! Healthy, fast, and incredibly delicious.

Rating: 4
Spicy and light. This is a great lower fat alternative to cheesy tacos with sour cream and ground beef. We used a whole jalapeno and found it to be just a little too spicy, so we will cut back next time. Salsa would be perfect on its own, mashed up and served with chips.

Healthy, quick, and delicious. I added a little ancho chili powder to the marinade and marinated the fish for a few hours. I substituted the feta cheese for a bit of sour cream spiked with tapatio. I used tilapia instead of catfish, which was delicious.

We really liked this a lot. Barbecued the fish instead as it was hot weather. I was going to serve it with queso fresco, but I forget until I saw it in the frig the next day. Next time I make it I'll try to remember the cheese!

I will make this again.... the feta was an impressive and unusual (but perfect) finish! I agree that the catfish was too watery. Not sure how to remedy that, but I might try a different kind of fish next time... the tilapia sounds like it might be a perfect solution.

Tasted great, but seemed way too watery. I would try another fish taco recipe before revisiting this one.

Simply delicious! I made them exact from the recipe and would not change a thing. I love how fresh they taste, my husband wants them again tomorrow...

I would make the salsa over and over again. I omitted the jalapeno, but the complexity of the tomatoes with the creaminess of the avocado and the tartness of the lime did not make me feel the heat was necessary. My canned tomatoes had some basil, and I think that is a good addition. I modified the salsa and the marinade to taste (salt, cracked pepper, more lime, more garlic, etc) to taste, but the basic recipe is there. Re the fish, I used tilapia and it was very nice. Great summer or light dish.

This is a simple, delicious recipe. Add some cumin to the avacado salad and it's perfect. We made this while we were on the beach; just grill the catfish.

Delicious! I used grilled tilapia instead of catfish. I also omitted the feta cheese - it had gone south - but it was delicious without it. I think I added more lime juice to the avacado-tomato salsa than was called for, but I loved the extra tanginess.

Rating: 3
Used grouper instead - maybe it would have been better with catfish. I thought it was a little bland. Maybe grilling would be better. The feta was great with the salsa, and I also tried with Haberno-Jack cheese, which was better. I think the cheese makes this dish.

This recipe is very easy, and healthy too! I loved the salsa, which went beautifully with the fish, which I recomend cooking on the grill. The grilled flavor brings the hot and sweet flavors of the salsa together nicely. You must try this one!

I've made this dish several times. I've used roughy and salmon and the results were great. I've tried them with reduced fat sharp white cheddar and they were delicious. The salsa is excellent!

This is great. I added two more garlic cloves. The feta is good, but the second time I made it (the next day), I used sharp cheddar. Liked it even better.

I made this with fresh tilapia and it was delicious! I thought the feta cheese would be overkill, but it gave it the right amount of kick -- we got 5 generous servings out of it.

Wish I lived in an area where fish was good and available...would make this recipe once a week. So delicious. Simple preparation of the fish. And, the salsa is more like a guacamole, but wonderful nonetheless. Great for fish taco lovers. One note: changed the lettuce to red cabbage, gives a nice crunch.

This dish is delicious! I've made it several times and not changed a thing. It's great.

This was very good, but next time I would make only 1/2 of the marinate. I buttered a cookie sheet and broiled (475-500 degrees} the marinated catfish (I used nuggets) on the center oven rack. I had enough pan juices to spoon some over the fish on each taco. So I pitched the second half of the marinate. My husband thinks that this recipe is too time consuming to warrant the results, even though he enjoyed it.

Left out jalapenos from salsa, but not marinade, since I have small children. Used red onion instead of green, since it's a staple in my house. Used Talapia, since I had frozen filets. All worked well, but next time I think I'll grill the fish instead to add more flavor.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe. I've made it three times and have a few comments and changes. I've tried catfish, flounder and cod. Catfish is best because of the firm texture. I decided that making the marinade for the fish was ineffective and a waste of time so I squeezed lime over the fish and added salt and pepper. I then put all the jalepeno in the salsa and added the garlic. I actually liked it better, though the next time I will also squeeze some lime juice over the fish after it's cooked. I also changed the lettuce to chopped iceberg because I like the crunch. But this is a simple and delicious recipe and has become a staple already.

A little watery, however they are still very tasty and much healthier than most versions of fish tacos.

This was fairly easy to make, light and very delicious. I used Orange Roughy instead of catfish. I would definitley make this again.
