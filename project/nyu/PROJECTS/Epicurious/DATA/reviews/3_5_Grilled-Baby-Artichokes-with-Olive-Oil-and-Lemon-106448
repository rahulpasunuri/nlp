I thought the method in this recipe was good, but I found the result to be surprisingly lacking in flavor.

The Pasadena recipe is still here. I've copied it below: While this recipe is on the right track....I have one that is phenomenal. Never had artichokes on the grill?? Once you have you won't have it any other way.Cheap and plentiful at Trader Joes...purchase any size artichoke...cut stem and trim thorns from leaves. Steam or simmer whole. Cool down and refrigerate till cold. Marinade: 1c. Olive oil 1/2 c. red wine vinegar juice of 1/2 a lemon 1 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper 1/2 tsp. Herbs de Provence 1 tsp. garlic. Depending on size...cut artichokes in half remove choke with a teaspoon...may want to quarter if large. Pour marinade over artichokes...I cook night before and marinate in the morning..you can leave on the counter or in fridge all day...grill till you see light char marks and they are warmed through. You can serve this with a basil pesto mayo...but the flavor is great on it's own. I usually don't put recipes in my comments, but when I saw this recipe I had to share...just a few more ingredients can make simple....sublime. This recipe was given to me by a restaurant manager....never hurts to ask huh?!

What happened to the review from the Cook From Pasadena? Surely BA didn't feel they had to remove it becuase it was a better recipe??

Four Forks for the cook from South Pasadena!!! Look no further, these are THE best grilled artichokes ever! I've been making these for years to rave reviews!

I followed the Pasadena recipe too. I thought it was absolutely delicious but I would change two things next time- less oil (the oil caused flare ups on the grill and it seemed too oily when eaten too) and I would take off more of the outer leaves until you get to the lighter green leaves. Also, you don't need to take the choke out- baby artichokes have edible chokes. Yummy recipe!

WOW DID I GOOF! I used the recipe that Pasadena wrote about, that is the 4 fork recipe!!! SORRY! To find hers, look on page 1 to find it!

Okay, this is easy....yummy...makes me wish that artichokes grew in my neck of the woods! I made it repeatedly this summer and last.

Well, like almost all the other reviews on here, I'm rating this recipe, not as Bon Appetit wrote it, but I'm rating it for the fabulous recipe that "A Cook from Pasadena" submitted.I think hers' or his' was the first review submitted. (I personally think Bon Appetit should list your recipe, and send you royalties!) We had never grilled artichokes before, and I've never even bought the baby onees, but they were just perfect! My little twist on it, was to add some white wine, a little herbs de provence and some kosher salt to the pot the artichokes were simmering in for added flavor. I only had about 30 minutes for the cooled artichokes to marinate, but they were full of flavor! I thought they would need some aioli or something to dip the leaves in (because we love condiments) but they didn't need a thing! Thanks so much Pasadena cook!

I made as written and really enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe. The lemon and good olive oil complement the artichokes without stealing the show. Easy and relatively quick too!

We loved this, and yes, we did it the way S. Pasadena advised to do it. I found that with these baby artichokes you didn't need to remove the choke. I marinated all day and then poured the marinade back on them after grilling. Bring on the napkins!

Sorry, my comment should have read: Steam the baby chokes for 6-8 minutes, roll them in olive oil (and sherry vinegar or rice wine vinegar, if you feel so inclined); grill them over hardwood charcoal, taking care not to let them burn, until nicely browned; and serve them with a homemade Aioli. Deborah Madison has a great Aioli recipe. You really can't go wrong.

Sometimes recipes don't work because they don't tell you what you need to know. Sometimes they are just not that good. I think both are wrong with this one. I don't see a real difference in the origional and "South Pasadena". They both marinate in olive oil and acid. I used the Herbs de Provence, but other seasoning/herbs would have done fine. I left out the garlic, but this should be no big deal. I often cook artichokes with cheese and stuff, and we strip the "meat" from the leaves with out teeth, before eating the hearts. These little guys, cooked this way, have to be denuded of any leaves that have any green fiber (most of the artichoke) whether the leaves have any meat or not. Let's just say that you take a little artichoke and snap off any leaf that is green (as well as cutting of the stem and the "thorns"). Boil this little thing until it is tender, marinate for flavor, and grill to warm and brown. Sounds good.

Like a lot of people, I didn't make this recipe but rather the version detailed by the cook in South Pasadena. Like everyone has said, it was delicious. I made a couple of adjustments. First, I didn't have red wine vinegar in the house, so I used balsamic instead. Also, I would add red pepper flakes next time to give it a little more zing. This is a great accompaniment to the Spicy Marinated Mozzarella with Oregano and Capers also on this site.

Good recipe; was intrigued so I made both the Pasadena way and as written. Both were good. As written, you get more artichoke flavor. The Pasadena way reminded me a little of marinated artichoke hearts placed on the grill. If health weren't an issue, I still feel there is nothing better with artichokes than butter and lemon.

I made this for my husband and kids and it was a big hit. I would probably not add any more dressing to the artichokes once the grilling is complete. This made them a little oilier than I would prefer. Flavor was great.

Love the Pasadena recipe! It was too cold and rainy to fire up the grill, so I sauteed the marinated artichoke halves in a deep pan until slightly browned. I also ran out of red wine vinegar so used 1/4 c. vinegar but all the juice from one lemon, liked the lemon flavor. And rosemary instead of herbes de provence.

I tried the "pasadena" recipe and thought it was WAY too overpowering. You couldnt taste any artichoke flavor. The epicurious recipe is much better as it brings out the flavor of the artichoke.

Maybe I did something wrong or maybe I just don't like artichikes but this really was the worst dish I've ever made (following the Pasadena recipe).

Hats off to Pasadena - thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe! I made that recipe last night and they were a hit! As other reviewers have stated it's SO much easier to remove the choke after cooking. Will make again and again! Now I know exactly what to do with the baby artichokes you see in Trader Joe's all the time....

WOW! Thanks Pasadena (1st reviewer). You are right, this is the ultimate artichoke recipe. Simply outstanding! We used sherry vinegar instead of the red wine (it was on hand) with excellent results. Awesome.

Follow the Pasadena recipe and process. It's so much easier to cook the artichoke first and then remove all the insides...the marinade from the reviewed in Pasadena is AWESOME!! This is a GREAT recipe.

Like everyone else, I'm reviewing the South Pasedena cook recipe (see "More Reviews") and not the recipe listed above. The results are fab. No need for dipping sauce. I pressure cooked the artichokes for 7 minutes before cooling / marinating / grilling them.

It doesn't get any better than this! Thanks to the reviewer from Pasadena. Truly delicious! Two thumbs up! As an aside, I note that almost all the reviewers are from California -- I guess grilling artichokes is the California method of choice!

Thumbs up to South Pasadena. Everyone asked me how to make these delicious artichokes when I served them for a party of 10. Nice recommendation!

Sometimes you read the reviews and the suggestions made, and you wonder why anyone would substitute for the recipe given... but in this case, South Pasadena was right on! Her/his recipe for the baby artichokes was really, really good. I served a platterful of baby artichokes as a side dish and they were really wonderful. After I took them off the grill, I added a little more olive oil and squeezed half a lemon on it, some salt and peper, then garnished with some chopped Italian parsley. They were great!

I added this to our Antipasto Platter and it was a hit. We used the marinade the reviewer suggusted and it was great and I was able to do ahead.

I made this dish with the marinade that the reviewer from South Pasadena suggested. It was indeed, phenomenal. Absolutely delicious and I can't wait to get back to Trader Joe's to get more so I can make them for tonite! I served them with the basil pesto mayonnaise, however, the marinade was so good, they really would have been great all alone! Do try this dish and do it his way!

This is outstanding. Minimal effort and great taste, I cut back on the olive oil as I usually prefer less. I could have eaten these all day. They're great cold too. If you can find baby artichokes, this is definately the recipe to use.
