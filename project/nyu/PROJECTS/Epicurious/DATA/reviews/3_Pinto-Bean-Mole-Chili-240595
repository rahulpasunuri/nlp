OK, but I doubt that I'll make it again. Much as I love one-dish meals with pinto beans -- we have great local pintos which I pressure can, this recipe just doesn't make the cut. I made it with only two substitutions: chicken stock instead of water, and semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened. It's definitely better the second day, when the spices have melded, but still is lacking something. The pan sauce is too watery; it's calling out for something fatty and unctuous to bind things together. Were I to try it again, I might add bacon -- reserved for a topping -- and use some of the fat to saute the onion, instead of olive oil. I also might use collards instead of kale.

Made the recipe fairly accurately, though I cooked my own beans and added ground turkey and pumpkin instead of zukes to the onion/spice mixture. I like it -- including the subtle orange and chocolate notes -- but there's something missing...I wish I could put my finger on it.

The pumpkin is a great addition, I used black beans instead of pinto and added quinoa. After making this myself, I have a few comments. For beginning/amateur cooks re: too watery. It's a good rule of thumb to never add 'water' to soups. Always use veggie stock or something with more flavor (chicken stock if you are not vegetarian, beef stock or V8 juice). More importantly, with this recipe (and others like it in the future) add water ONLY if you need it. If your soup is too watery, let it sit overnight--especially with bean dishes, they will always soak up the water. If it is still too watery, you can put 1/8-1/4 of the soup into a blender or food processor, puree, then add back to the rest of the soup. This will help to thicken it up without changing the flavor. For more seasoned cooks, re: mole & flavor. This recipe could either be very cool or very strange. I understand all of the mixed reviews and made a few changes in my approach. If you are feeling adventurous :)...make the mole on the side and add it at the end. Cut seeded chile with scissors and add to 1/2 cup of water in skillet with seeds, 2 Tbsp sesame seeds, 1/4 cup almonds, 1/8 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/4 cup golden raisins, anise seeds or star anise, 2-3 cloves and cinnamon. Simmer on low and continue to stir for 3-5 minutes. Add to blender with 1/2 can tomatoes + all of the juice. Add water if necessary to puree all of this mixture. Return to pan and add chocolate, salt, pepper & sugar to taste. Add 1/4-1/2 cup of mole sauce to finished soup to taste. Add grated orange peel to taste. This turned out beautifully!

This is such a good, smoky, well balanced vegetarian chili. I add pumpkin instead of zucchini, which I think is a better fit with the chocolate. I also squeeze in the juice from the orange. Nobody who has tried it has walked away from a spoonful yet.

I've been making this chili since the recipe was published in November 2007 -- and my husband and I love it. It does matter that you use fresh spices and good quality peppers. If you don't like kale, then maybe steer clear. But if you haven't tried enough kale to know if you like it or not, this is a great starter recipe! The orange + chocolate is a great flavor combination, and balances the bitter greens so well.

This was just awful. Rarely do I go to the trouble of reviewing a recipe, but I would like to save others from the trouble of making this. It was weirdly bitter from the unsweetened chocolate. The orange zest also did not marry well with the other flavors. All in all, a big disappointment.

A delicious, and chunky chili. Easy to make and a big hit with my family and with guests. Super topped with yogurt and avocado slices.

This was great - such a different flavor! Even my boyfriend loved it - and he needs meat at all meals. Only changes I made were to use pumpkin instead of zucchini (as other reviews suggested - better texture I'd say, thought more work) and I didn't have the chili's so I used some extra hot cayenne and a little chipotle in adobe sauce- perfect amount of heat. I'll definitely be making this again!

What a satisfying meal after a hard day's work. I made it for my husband and me using ground ancho chiles and canned chiptle chile since dried ones were not available. I used butternut squash and red kale. As one reviewer recommended, I doubled the amount of chocolate. Perfect for a cold, rainy evening meal.

I have made this recipe several times, for aprties and for myself. Even my carnivore of a husband enjoys this meatless chili! Yum!

This soup can be great, it needs just a little more body. Not sure what- any recommendations would be appreciated. I still love it and made it many times

This was delicious and perfect for the vegetarians and those who ate meat in my family. I added double the chocolate than the recipe called for. This enhanced the chili flavor and made the chocolate flavor present, as it otherwise did not seem to be.

This was fantastic. I forgot the dried chipotle, and wish I'd worn a mask while dealing with the anchos. I used one of bunch kale, thinly sliced the stems and center ribs and added them with the onions. Used winter squash instead of summer squash, also added along with onions. Wonderful flavor.

A reasonable facsimile of mole with a whole lot less effort! I took even more shortcuts: I ground my chiles without toasting them.I too used dry beans instead of canned, so I put the raw vegetables in the pot at the appropriate time and skipped the sauteing step. I did substitute winter squash and sweet potato for the summer squash - just seemed to me to pair better with the beans and spices. Next time I make it (there will be a next time) I think I will add mushrooms.

The chopping is the "hard" part, but this recipe is awesome, and well worth it!! I've used ancho and chipotle chile peppers from Penzey's Spices (penzeys.com) and had a great result every time -- maybe the spices were to blame in the bad reviews?

This is a lovely chili. I will make it again. Instead of water I substituted 1 1/4 cup of coffee. Very nice.

This isn't a true mole, but the chocolate definitely makes the dish.

I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about. This was delicious - and oh so flavorful. I enjoyed the heat at the end. I used soaked beans instead of canned (as I do with all soups) and cooked it a bit more than recommended (about an hour) and it turned out so good. My honey had thirds (something he is not prone to do with something that's not loaded with meat or cheese)....

With all of the spices in this recipe, I thought this chili would be great. We found that it really lacked flavor, however, and the bitterness was a little overwhelming. I definitely would NOT make this again!

I almost moved on to another recipe because of the low ratings, but I sure am glad I didn't. This vegetarian chili is delicious, and super easy to make. The prep time takes a bit longer then expected, but once everything is chopped and prepped, it comes together fast. I substituted the sugar and bakers chocolate with some delicious 82% cacao extra dark chocolate. I also added a small can of green chilies while sautéing the onions and garlic. If your chili is a little loose, just let it simmer uncovered for an extra 5-10 minutes. It also seems to thicken and get better after a few days. Serve with some cornbread for a perfect meal.

I agree with the other reviewer that this was a little too watery. Perhaps it needed some tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. We enjoy mole, but thought that the flavours really didn't work with the beans.

I made a huge pot of this delicious Mole Chili and served it to a bunch of hungry jazz musicians, who all went back for seconds. I improvised in a few ways, using canned chipotles as that's all I could find, and skipping the habernero. I also added the meat from four turkey chorizo sausages, and a bunch of mushrooms. All of the flavours were so distinct, particularly the orange and cinnamon... I couldn't taste the kale at all, and was happy to have the added nutrition. I would defenitely make this again.

I've never before made a chili with kale and zucchini, and I've never made a mole. The experience was fun, and I thought that this chili was excellent. My only complaint is that it seems to be missing a tiny something. My boyfriend and I decided that with a little pulled pork (with no BBQ sauce) on top, this would be a fantastic meal. It would no longer be low-fat or low-cal, but it would still have lots of fiber and veggies. : )

The ingredients smelled wonderful as they cooked, but the start to finish time was over an hour, and the finished product was watery and not nearly as flavorful as expected. I would make it again, but with no water and adding a few more chili seeds!

My husband and I loved this recipe. We served it over spanish rice and garnished with scallions, cilantro and sour cream. The only thing I think is funny is that this is considered a "quick" recipe. If you follow the instructions it is very time consuming to roast and grind the peppers and chocolate. This recipe took me a good hour to prepare. I think the flavors are delicious and if you are a fan of spicy mole you will love this. Only thing I changed was I used Swiss Chard instead of Kale since I had that in the frige. Worked beautifully. Use real, dried peppers!

My husband and I loved this one. So tasty and so healthy, too. We used chili powder instead of the dried chilis and cocoa powder with a little bit of sugar instead of the baker's chocolate. We also used a can of fire- roasted tomotoes. Served with yellow Spanish rice, it was superb!

I love both mole and kale, but I didn't like the combination; I found the bitterness of the chocolate to be unpleasant against the flavors of the zucchini and kale. The chili looked and smelled delicious, and the textures were wonderful, but I couldn't get past the alkaline bitterness. I'd make it again without the chocolate-- it wouldn't be a mole any more, but it would be a succulent vegetable and bean stew.

Rating: 4
I agree with the most recent reviewer, I think it was great! I was a little nervous, not being terribly familiar with Kale and knowing that my husband doesn't generally care for "greens." But the flavor combination looked intriguing so I gave it a shot. The only substitution I made was I chopped up a canned chipotle in adobo instead of dried. It was awesome - I had two helpings and so did my picky husband! It was spicy but very yummy.

I don't know what all these other folks expected when they made this chile, but I thought it was spectacular. I loved the way the orange and chocolate flavours were still distinct,and the bitterness of the kale set everything off nicely. I'd rate it as one of the best chilis I've ever made.

I love pinto beans, chocolate, chile, oranges and cilantro and was intrigued to try this recipe. Eating it, though, was a thoroughly weird experience: I saw the kale, felt the kale, but didn't taste it. It was like watching TV on mute while listening to the radio! What I was tasting as far as aroma didn't match the texture! Very weird vibes! I do like kale, but I think it's better in other contexts, eg creamed with a little nutmeg. I might make this again but alter it somewhat.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe, as well. The orange, chocolate and chile flavors just didn't seem to blend together well. I'm a huge fan of mole sauce, and I think perhaps it just can't be rushed.

Love that this recipe uses winter veggies - not wild on the taste (or the amount of leftovers) ergo, probably will not make this again.

anyone else find it amusing that this has 4 forks but yet no one would make it again?!? My favorite chili is the Black Bean one with Lime Creme on this site. Will give this one a try but modify it to include beef. Vegetarian chili just "t'aint right" in cattle country.

This was awful. Maybe I just don't like kale, but this turned into an icky, bitter weird concoction. I ate it because I was hungry, but I'd so never make this again.
