This is a great recipe. I used thighs and regular dijon mustard because that's what I had. Did not use any butter and it still came out moist and delicious. Hint: to keep the chicken from sticking to the pan, I lined my cooking sheet with foil and laid a cookie rack on top of the cooking sheet. I sprayed the rack with Pam and the chicken did not stick or loose any of its crust at all. Also having the chicken on the rack helps get both sides crispy. We didn't use any sauce, but simply drizzled a little fresh lemon juice on top. This is our new favorite chicken recipe.

I used this recipe to make a chicken Parmesan dish served with noodles and tomato sauce. I too did not use the butter and I flattened the chicken breasts to make them thinner. Amazing results that the whole family enjoyed, even the picky eaters. Very crispy on the outside but the chicken was not dry at all. Will make again and will try it with the asparagus and sauce from the original recipe.

This is one of my "Go-To" chicken recipes when I've got a package of breasts and not much time or inspiration. I make it with normal Dijon instead of honey mustard and have made it with panko or regular bread crumbs. I don't always drizzle with butter and I always just spray my pans. I've never made the asparagus but since I'm thinking about making this for a little get together tomorrow I may just try it! Quick, simple, easy and consistently produces juicy, flavorful chicken!

I was only making this for myself, my husband and our three year old so I used 2 large chicken breasts and 1/3 of the recipe. It turned out quite nice though it was a tiny bit dry. The changes I made were smashing the breasts flat instead of butterflying the chicken. I used Dijon instead of honey dijon since that was what I had. I also used parchment paper instead of buttering the dish - it just made for an easier clean up and saved a few calories. Overall a nice simple recipe.

The crust stuck to the pan which was probably my fault for not coating the pan well enough but it turned out delicious. I didn't have asparagus so I made a quick pan sauce by reducing the remainder of a bottle of chardonnay with butter, a little chicken broth, and herbes de provence which I drizzled lightly over the chicken. Superb!

I cut this recipe down for two on a hurried weeknight. Plain dijon mustard, regular bread crumbs. I sprayed the pan with a baking spray but still drizzled a little butter over the top. Juicy, tender, flavorful chicken that was easy to cook, quick to clean up, and fast and filling on a boring week night!

Wow! Easy and good! For those who are watching their calories, you could use egg whites and cut back a bit on the butter. Great "House Chicken" meal.

My son asked for parmesan crusted chicken for his last family meal before leaving for his first year of college. I didn't have a recipe so I of course went to epicurious. This was surprisingly good! I added garlic powder and flour as the first step before the egg. Aslo spayed the pan as advised instead of the 2 T of butter. Served with gnocchi and pesto and oven roasted asparagus (roasted in oven with chicken) Great family meal!

I've had this recipe stored for awhile and finally just made it. I was preparing a red meat dinner and had a guest who only ate chicken or fish, so I chose this second recipe because it required very little preparation and few ingredients (I had the panko bread crumbs). There is a lot of crumb mixture and I had quite a bit left over, even with 4 pounds of chicken breasts. I would reduce that next time. I was very pleasantly surprised with the results. I put it in the oven with the other meat, so I could only bake it at 400, but kept it in longer. It was nicely browned and visually very attractive. It was tasty; it was moist. Most every one ended up having chicken also. And I had requests for the recipe. I would definitely make again.

Cut down on the butter by spraying the pan with olive oil spray, but still drizzled a littler over the chicken. Otherwise I followed the recipe (butterflied the breasts myself--it really isn't that difficult). I grilled the asparagus with garlic infused olive oil and salt and pepper to cut down on the fat. The chicken was very moist and got two thumbs up from picky husband (and I thought it was pretty tasty).

Really great way to prepare chicken breasts. They were perfectly cooked through, not dry at all, and full of flavor. Plus it was fast and easy. Instead of buttering a baking sheet, I laid parchment paper on the baking sheet for easier cleanup and to avoid the smoking butter/smoke alarm problem some reviewers complained about. I still drizzled the chicken with the melted butter though as they were baking. Perfection!

As one reviewer has already noted, the baked chicken is similar to chicken parmesan from the '70's. I've added minced fresh sage to the bread crumbs and used non stick aluminum foil on the pans. Also, decreased the oven to 400 degrees and eliminated the need for turning off the smoke alarm. I have a convection oven and the higher temperature was not necessary. An easy weeknight recipe that kids and adults enjoy. Next time I'll try serving with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

Great improved version of 70's parmesan chicken which was made with bread crumbs and already grated cheese. Halved breading amt as per others' suggestion. To Vancouver: sounds like at 500 your bottom broiler kicks in.

This chicken recipe was so simple and delicious! My whole family went nuts over it! The sauce for the asparagus was a little time consuming (and very fattening), but was also delicious. I made the sauce without the orange and it was like a very rich hollandaise sauce.

Love this recipe for those "I have no clue what to make for dinner" nights. I now cut the panko et al portion of the recipe in half as I found I was throwing out much of the breading mixture.

After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this recipe. Though the ingredients are excellent, I found the procedure didn't work for me. The 500 oven temperature was so high that it melted the parmesan, creating puddles of grease in the baking sheet. The copious amount of melted butter added more grease, causing the smoke alarm to go off. While the top of the chicken was pale in color, in spite of the heat, when I turned the chicken, the underside was black and burned. I have no idea what went wrong, I seem to be the only cook who had a problem. Too bad, I even used expensive free-range chicken breasts. I would be interested if anyone else had the same experience.

I used this recipe for company recently. It was easy and delicious. I used another reader's idea & added fresh Rosemary and Thyme to the panko mix. I butterflied as well as lightly pounded the chicken. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Great results for very little effort.

The other reviews say it all. I would like to add that we do this in a toaster/convection oven and don't have to heat up the big oven and the whole kitchen in the summer, and if you freeze the chicken, it is the best impromptu meal for guests we know of. We always have the other ingredients on hand, and I can thaw the chicken breasts in the sink (cold running tap water) in about 25 minutes if they are separated before freezing.

I made this for the first time last night. I served it with risotto and couldn't have been more pleased. My modifications: Cayenne, Salt & Pepper added to the breadcrumbs. Regular Dijon, a swirl of Honey, Cumin, and chopped Scallions added to the egg mixture. Seasoned chicken breasts with just garlic and WOW.

I've made these several times for guests (as an appetizer) and everyone loves them. A few people have commented that these are the best oven-baked chicken tenders they've ever had. The only changes I've made are 1) I make my own coarse breadcrumbs from whole wheat bread and toast them extra-crispy - which I think tastes as good, but is a bit healthier, 2) I use egg whites instead of whole eggs, and 3) I use a mixture of ground chipotle and habanero peppers for an extra kick. Honestly, I think the original recipe is fantastic - I just prefer spicier chicken and try to cut out fat when it's easy to do so without sacrificing flavor. This is a great recipe. Highly recommended.

Prepared the chicken portion of this recipe and followed instructions as written. Very good. The parmesean/bread crumb mixture makes quite a bit. I set some aside from this recipe I made a couple weeks ago and froze it for future use. Used it today and was just as good as the day it was prepared. Just don't contaminate the whole batch with chicken unless you intend to throw it out (the excess).

Easy, easy, easy....excellent rI ecipe...my husband is learning to cook, and this is definitely on his chosen list as dishes to prepare.....I thought the sauce on the accompanying asparagus dish was a little heavy for the asparagus....just steamed asparagus with a drizzle of butter and lemon might be a nicer accompaniment to this dish....

This is excellent. I used regular bread crumbs which were fine and I flattened the breasts with my kitchen mallet. The coating is excellent and crispy. I did not try the asparagus recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious...and so simple! My boyfriend loved it, too. I made a creamy sauce to enjoy with the chicken that mirrored the flavors in the chicken. I warmed some lite sour cream with a splash of nonfat milk, and added parmesan cheese, garlic powder, dijon and whole grain mustard, honey, salt, cracked pepper and cayenne pepper. Delicioussss! Served the dish with sauteed green beans and chunks of sweet red onions.

Very good & easy to make! A crowd pleaser! I did substitute in regular bread crumbs as I just made it with what I had on hand. Don't know if that made it terribly different than the recipe intended, but it was still very good. It's a keeper!

I make this all the time - I add fresh thyme and rosemary to the panko mixture and it really adds a great flavour. I also use a little Extrav Virging olive oil instead of the butter and it works out great. We serve it with a sweet/spicy thai chili sauce and mashed sweet potatoes w/ roasted garlic for a quick weeknight meal.

Everyone loved this, especially with the asparagus and sauce. The excessive amount of butter sets my smoke detectors off every time I make it, but it is well worth it. Don't be tempted to buy the thin sliced cutlets..they just don't taste the same.

Made this for dinner tonight - the chicken was easy and DELICIOUS! My entire family loved it..even my picky three year old son. I added one tablespoon of orange honey & served with smashed potatoes. I won't do the asparagus again...there are much better recipes out there..without all that butter.

Nice overall. Not too much to say about the recipe as it is quite simple. Didn't have to sub any ingredients. The trick with the chicken is to ensure you don't overcook. It should come out nice and juicy without being underdone.

I have made this several times..very simple, but very good! I haven't been making the sauce for the asparagus, but did experiment and added taragon to the dry mix...makes for an even better dish! Have tried both dried and fresh taragon and both are equally good. It's also a very simple dish and one I have taken to friends who needed food delivered to their houses. Will make over and over again.

This was very good. I made it with plain bread crumbs, and a maltaise sauce recipe also from this site. The maltaise sauce separated a bit, I think because I kept it over heat too long. Still, it was delicious.

Have made this chicken dish - without the asparagus - three times since the issue came out. Very nice, similar to the parmesan-sage crusted pork chop recipe on this site, which is also a family favorite. Needs a minute or so under the broiler to really crisp up the crust.
