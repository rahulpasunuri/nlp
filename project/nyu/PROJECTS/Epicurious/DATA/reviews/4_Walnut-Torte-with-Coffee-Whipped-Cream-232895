This is very airy and slightly eggy in the style of an angel-food cake. It smelled like an omelet when it was baking and I got worried. But it was delicious, and the whipped cream was a must. It was equally great as dessert and breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly, twice: making two tortes and twice the whipped cream in order to serve it as a layer cake. It is lovely, but the walnuts are SUCH a subtle flavor that I think I want to kick them up somehow next time. One idea is to add a tiny pinch of salt, to make the walnut flavor more pronounced. Or I might simply bastardize the flavor by adding an orange or coffee flavored liqueur to the batter. I wonder if using almonds would yield the same success, but with more flavor?

I over whipped the cream....so i ended up with a coffee vanilla butter. Oops! Not so bad, but I ran out of creme, so not so useful. I stuck the torte in the freezer (this was going to be dropped off as a gift to a friend's house on the way to the airport) and left town for a few weeks and forgot about it. Unthawed it, made a new topping, served it for dessert at a dinner party and it was great. Light and lovely. A friend not fond of coffee didn't care for the creme, but everyone else took seconds!

Fantastic dessert - quick, easy and delicious. Added a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the ground walnuts and whip cream to give it some spice. Turned out great. I will make this again.

This was an okay, relatively quick dessert, but not spectacular. It was light and not too filling, but had an unexciting taste.

Outstanding! Made it for our Canadian Thanksgiving and it disappeared faster than our traditional favourite pumpkin pie. I am always tempted to "play" with recipes, but did not change a thing with this one; I wanted to see if it was as good with the simple, basic ingredients. Everyone, including my finicky seven year old loved it. With generous whipped cream, it is still a marvellous "light" dessert; as another reviewer wrote, delicious with coffee.

Like others, I found espresso gave the whipped cream a nice balance and just threw in a lil leftover morning liquid instead of bothering w/ the instant powder.Came out wonderful. Adding this to my repertoire of easy yet elegant desserts that can be made in a flash. I will be experimenting with different nuts and whipped cream flavourants as time goes by.

This was really good and easy to make. I will try it next time with hazelnuts. :)

amazing what using just walnuts, eggs and sugar can accomplish. This is VERY good with coffee.

Absolutely fantastic. Light, yet flavorful...perfect for the finale of a substantial meal. You can make it in a 10-inch springform and increase the quantities by 1.25 (i.e., 5 eggs, 1 1/4 cups walnuts, etc.). Serve with fresh strawberries.

Great flavor and texture. I was pretty unsure because of the simple ingredients, it was well worth the gamble!

This is one of the best, most memorable tortes I've ever eaten. Light and easy to make. I add a wee bit more coffee granules in the whipped cream since I like stronger flavor. It's to die for.

A really nice desert to serve after a heavy meal. Everyone loved the roasted walnut flavor and light texture.

I've never had anything quite like this and it really is good - but the flavors are subtle and delicate like the feel of the cake itself. I was dubious about the recipe but now I'm a believer.

This was both easy and delicious. I also 1.5 the recipe. I only had a 9.5 inch springform pan, and I didn't want it to be too flat. Mine was done in about 30 minutes, but I think my oven is running hot. This is one you should try.

Great recipe, highly recommend it as-is. Made for my wife's book group; they called me at the office to rave about it. OK to make 1 day ahead.

Awesome. Made twice. 2nd time did 1.5X of the recipe so the torte is higher. Also used half ground almond and the flavor seems to be even more interesting. Definitely don't skimp on the whipped cream (for diet sake.) LOTS of it, is essential to the full enjoyment of this great dessert.

A wonderful dessert. Easy to prepare. It really impressed my co-workers, one of whom can't eat wheat. She was just thrilled with this. I think I'll try it using other nuts, maybe hazel-nuts, with frangelico dribbled over it.

Made this dessert for Passover and it got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper and will make for one of my friends with celiac's disease. Also, used instant espresso powder instead of instant coffee powder as recommended.

For someone who cannot eat flour/gluten [such as myself] this was impeccable! Light,delicate and easy...My xmas wish? To find more recipes like this !

Delicious! As the previous reviewer noted, it's also very light tasting. I, too, used an 8" pan, but I didn't need the full 40 minutes of cook time--I would recommend checking the torte after about 35 minutes. Also, I whipped up an extra half cup of heavy cream and I used instant espresso instead of instant coffee.

I made this for our book club (Spanish theme for Shadow of the Wind). It was so incredibly easy to make and so light! Not too sweet, it would also do well at a brunch. I made it in an 8" pan and it came out just fine (smaller but higher) with only 5 min. extra cooking time. Leftovers actually kept well in the fridge for several days, which surprised me because the cream held up so well. I whipped it ahead of time, let it stand in a strainer for a few hours in the fridge, and then topped it just before serving the night of the party. Maybe that helped. I'm making this again for Thanksgiving. Easy and maybe this year no one will complain about my too-heavy dessert after a big meal.

This was simple, quick and delicious. I didn't grate the walnuts first and they got a bit sticky, so I mixed them with a bit of sugar before garnishing the whipped cream.

I made this dessert for company and everyone loved it. I didn't bother with grating the walnuts first (too much work and unnecessary, in my opinion) but was careful when processing them. I thought there could have been more filling - it didn't mound up quite as high as the photo in the magazine. And my husband thought the coffee flavor could be more intense, but both problems are easily fixed. It tasted heavenly and looked very impressive!
