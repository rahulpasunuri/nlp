As far as curry goes, this one is pretty easy to make! I was really happy with this, as the curry is reminiscently sweet but not overly so. I served it first with wild rice, which added nice texture and flavor with the curry, and the second time with white long grain rice...which was nice because it was easy. Great recipe!
