Made this for my family for Thanksgiving and can't wait to make it for Christmas. My family (including 2 picky boys) LOVED it. Truly the best stuffing I've had! Followed the 35 minute roasting tip....it was perfect!

Turned out great. I added more turkey stock because I like it moist--probably almost another cup full. I also added some cream to the mixture, as I had seen in some other recipes for stuffing. Followed previous suggestion of 35 minutes for squash. Finally, I would definitely cut the bread into smaller pieces, so it stays together a bit more.

We made this for Thanksgiving last year and cooked it with Jacques and Julia's technique of boning and stuffing the thighs, spreading the bone-in breast tented over a mound of the stuffing (look it up, a great way to do a turkey!) and it was AWESOME. I didn't think I ever cared for fennel but it was not overpowering, just a delicious stuffing.

This stuffing was a huge hit with my family, all of whom are snobs about stuffing! I substituted lean ground turkey sausage, baked the squash for only 35 mins as recommended (great tip), and otherwise followed the recipe as is. This one will become a staple in my house.

This was soooo good! It was a huge hit this year. I made it exactly as written, and ended up using a whole cup of extra broth (I may have dried the ciabatta bread chucks too much in the oven). It has so much depth of flavor from the varying ingredients, and I think it may have been the biggest hit of the whole spread. One note: when they say mix it all in a large bowl, they mean large. After trying my two largest mixing bowls, I ended up mixing it in a 8.5 quart casserole/saucepan. That was about the right size, and I still ended up with lots of stuffing escaping on to the floor. Delicious. Don't change a thing!

Really good recipe. I substituted the onions for leeks, and the butternut for acorn squash. Leeks have a more delicate taste and acorn squash is a little sweeter, cook quicker, and you don't have to peel them. I subbed about half the stock for white wine which was great! I will make again next year with less bread and in smaller cubes (as someone already suggested) and I think I will cook the sausage in the liquid, then add the bread and let it soak, then mix in the vegetables and bake. I want the sausage to melt into the stuffing instead of keeping it's own texture.

Traditional enough to please a crowd yet different enough to stand out. Next time I will decrease the bread (I used a local bakery's Pane Bello. I highly recommend something rustic with a nice crust.) and increase the squash and sausage. I also recommend roasting the squash for no longer than 35 minutes so as to prevent it from becoming TOO soft during the additional baking time.

We have made this stuffing for the last 2 Thanksgivings and is now our favorite stuffing recipe. Delicious as written. A new tradition!

I made this last year for thanksgiving and I'm making it again this year. It is the best stuffing I've ever had. I love it!

This recipe was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner this year. My husband called it "magical." I didn't have quite enough chicken broth (only about 3/4 cup), so I supplemented with some white wine (probably about 1/3 cup, when all was said and done) and fresh apple cider (about 1/4 cup)...delicious. I think they actually added a lovely depth of flavor to the dish that I'll try to incorporate next time I make this recipe.

The stuffing was delicious inside and outside of the bird (and I'm an inside the bird snob). I used ciabatta sandwich roll from Costco for bread, and it was yummy! My family really like the larger chunks of bread instead of the smaller ones typically found in box stuffing. Made recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing.
