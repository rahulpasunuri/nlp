Very easy, quick salad that was a hit at a summer BBQ. I used Hidden Valley, but added fresh dill, parsley and a bit of garlic salt. Very fresh and light tasting!

The salad is good, but the dressing is fantastic, and so much healthier than bottled dressing, which is loaded with MSG and HF corn syrup, yuk.

I used peitie peas, sunflower seeds, red onion and celery with Hidden Valley Ranch dressing. It is very very good!!!!!!!

I would make it again but with Hidden Valley Ranch. It really can't be beat.

I thought this recipe was OK. I may be struck down for saying this, but you still can't beat Hidden Valley for the best ranch dressing. I think maybe tossing this with some type of lettuce would be better, which would defeat the whole "chopped salad" idea, but it would be better. Maybe if you CHOPPED the lettuce?....

Really great summer salad. Everyone always gets 2nds or 3rds.

This was a great change from lettuce salads. Had a nice crunch and the dressing is excellent. My husband and I both loved it.

Excellent, refreshing salad. It should appeal especially to those who don't like munching a lot of lettuce -- a good way to get some fresh vegetables into kids in particular.

I served this with the beef stew w/ herb dumplings and it was great! I don't like radishes, and my mother-in-law doesn't like cucmbers. We both had seconds. I love it for lunch the next day also.

I tried this recipe when my parents came to visit. We all liked it. It is a very crisp salad with lots of flavor.

We really liked this salad. It's nice and crunchy with a lovely flavor. Would be nice for summer picnics, too. Different!
