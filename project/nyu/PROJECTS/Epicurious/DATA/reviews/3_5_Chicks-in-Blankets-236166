Great appetizer for parties. These went over very well. I had some difficulty folding the puff pastry over the slices of sausage as instructed and ended up wrapping them up like a little package instead. These went very quickly at our holiday party. Next time I may try out some of the variations noted by other reviewers.

Used chicken & apple sausage. Didn't measure the mustard -- used a squeeze bottle, so just estimated the amount. No matter, these went like hotcakes -- everyone loved them and received several requests for the recipe. Super easy to make, too!

The cook from Chicago (below) nailed this by adding cheddar and preserves. (thank you Chicago!) It was amazing! I used sharp cheddar alternating apricot and fig jam. Will certainly make again. Great and easy finger food for a party

Easy and elegant version of the cocktail weiners in cresent dough! It was a good do ahead addition to the appetizer part of our 8th annual New Year's Eve progressive dinner. I used two types of chicken sausage (one slightly sweet with maple syrup and a spicier chicken andouille with artichoke. To differ the look between the two I folded all corners over on one to make a little pouch and just the two corners as directed on the other. Some of the two corners only popped open, but the appearance was still nice.

My guests loved this, I thought it was okay. I might make it again because it was so easy. I also presents well. I did both andouille sausage and chicken apple, the andouille was better.

These were a hit at a dinner party I had. However, to make the flavors more compatible with other hors d'oeuvres I used various jams (fig, apple and apricot) instead of mustard and I added cheddar cheese.

Made this for a bithday party and they were gone before I could get one, so I'll assume they were tasty. One note, make sure to really overlap the puff pastry because some of mine came undone in the oven.

This was a great, savory recipe that can be made ahead (yahoo!!) and served easily. It was delicious as it was simple. It's the kind of recipe where you can use similar substitutes and never be bored.
