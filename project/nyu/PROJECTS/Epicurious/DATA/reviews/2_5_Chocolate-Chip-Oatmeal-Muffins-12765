These muffins have potential. I used brown sugar only and white, whole wheat flour mixed with flax seed meal to make them taste more like chocolate chip cookies. They were very dry, though, so next time I will add more liquid or use less flour. My kids were afraid of the way they looked, but thought the muffins were delicious once they took a bite.

These muffins had the consistency of a scone rather than a muffin. I happen to like scones, so I enjoyed the muffins. I followed the advice of reviewers and creamed the butter and added some vanilla. I also added sliced almonds because those were the nuts I had on hand.

These are the best muffins I have ever tasted. I don't quite understand why others don't like them. Yes, they are a bit dry, but I actually prefer that to greasy muffins with too much oil. I love the consistency - the cruch of the walnuts, and the wonderful chocolate taste. I always take less sugar, and more chocolate. And I recommend you do the same! I double the recipe, so you can put 1 cup of chocolate. I keep the sugar the same as for only half (i.e. 1/2 c).

The worse muffins I ever tasted, will never make again.

Very bland and dry. These need more butter, or some oil or yogurt--pretty much anything to give them more moisture. If I were to make them again, I might also add some almond extract instead of vanilla, to give them more flavor.

Used canola oil & 1 mashed banana as reviews suggested. Also used mini-choc chips & omitted the nuts. These are definitely heavier muffins, but not overly so, and still good. My 3 kids (1, 4, & 6) loved them and that was the point this time.

I thought this recipe was great. I took the Yogourt idea, but added 2tbsp of raspberry yogourt and a little butter and extra sugar. Also added dried cranberrys and extra chocolate chips! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMm Good!

I am always looking for something to make ahead of time that I can keep in the freezer all week and pop in the microwave for 30 seconds to have a light breakfast. I, like another reviewer suggested, added a mushed up banana and also used a bit more sugar than called for and canola oil instead of butter. And, I used 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup regular white flour (adding about 1/3 cup more of skim milk)for a bit more texture and wholesomey-goodness. We LOVE these muffins and the freezer takes nothing away from their lovely texture and flavor. Oh, another nice touch is turbinado sugar sprinkled on the top before baking. Nothing like dessert for breakfast!

Definitely cream butter rather than melt. I also added a little more milk and 2 tbsp of plain yogurt instead of 1 tbsp of butter.

I've made these as jumbo muffins. They were a real hit in my son's school. He would take one for breakfast and I'd have to send extra's for the rest of the guys--They beat out Dunkin Donuts I did omit the nuts becasue my son doesn't like them

Great snack! I have been making this recipe for years. I use canola oil instead of butter, and if I have a very ripe banana I mash that up and put it in. They are a dense muffin but that makes them perfect to carry to work - they don't fall apart.

I thought these muffins were much too dense; the batter seemed too thick and resembled something like a cookie dough. They were very dry and had a strong floury taste.

These, with a few substitutions, were wonderful! I creamed the sugar (an extra tablespoon or so) with softened butter. Also, to the wet ingredients, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. To the dry ingredients, I added 1/2 teaspoon or so of cinnamon. Unfortunately, I did not have any walnuts, but these muffins still came out great!

I prepared the recipe as is but the muffins were too heavy, very cookie dough-ish. I tried fluffing the butter (softened, not melted) and sugar; much better.

These objects were shaped like muffins and had choc. chips in them but other than that they did not come close to what I was hoping. They were a weird color too and definately not sweet or flavorful enough.

The whole family really likes these they are very quick & easy!we like to leave out the nuts and add more choc. chips

I've had much better muffins. These were buttery and I added more chocolate chips. I sprinkled sugar on the tops (more sugar was suggested which helped.) They were very quick and worked fine without paper liners. Just not as tasty as I expected.

I thought these muffins were really bland. Even the chocoholics in my house didn't really like them. I wouldn't make these again.

This is a good basic muffin. I'd actually give it 2 1/2 stars. The muffins are not very sweet, so if you like a sweeter muffin, add more sugar. I toasted extra oats and sprinkled them on top, which gave them a nice crunch. Also, mine were done in 14 minutes.

Very good. I doubled the recipe so I would have 12 muffins instead of just 6. I used 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour and substituted cinnamon chips (from the King Arthur catalog) for the chocolate chips. Everybody loved them!

Great recipe and easy to make with ingredients you would usually have on hand. Kids love this muffin! Remember, this recipe only makes 6 muffins rather than your usual 12.

Great Muffins! I finally found a good recipe. Using it as a base, I substituted the chocolate chips and nuts with apples and raisins and added some cinnamon. Everyone loved them.
