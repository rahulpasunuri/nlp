What did I do wrong? Ended up with CHARRED sauce in the oven. Is 500 degrees F correct?????

This is one of my no-fail, amazing reward for little effort dishes. I follow the listed recipe, but add a pinch of saffron to make it even better. It is worth hunting down blood-oranges for the best flavor blend

This was delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, but could not find a blood orange, so used a regular orange. Next time, I will add a little bit of white wine to the sauce at the end; it was just a bit too sweet for my taste, so the wine will help with that. But otherwise, ooooh, what a meal!

Absaloutley delicious! My husband, daughter, and myself all loved the recipe! We had it with organic spinach salad with balsamic vingarette, sourdough bread, and roasted asparagus. I will definetly make it again!

So delicious! The only change I made was to use just a pinch of red pepper flakes (in half the recipe). This is, literally, finger-licking fabulous!!! Now I want to try the sauce with scallops.

I've made this many times over the years. It is a dish to share with good friends, not someone you'd hope to impress. It's very messy! The flavors are incredible. At the start of crab season in Nov., this is the recipe I pull out.

If you want to see an entire table go dead quiet because they are so focused on INHALING their food- then make this dish! I had to break out the little seafood forks but otherwise no utensils because the crab was expertly cracked. Dispense with anything else besides crusty sourdough and a tartly dressed green salad served after crab-mania. Offered Vouvray and Viognier and both worked splendidly as this is very rich and wants a wine that doesn't get lost. I used 5 v large crabs for 5 pp but 4 would have been plenty as noted by others. Also used a combo of blood orange, navel and lemon juices. Do not skip this element as it provides the acid balance the dish needs. This one is a keeper and I know my friends will be clamoring for it again next crab season.

I make this all the time during crab season, and it's wonderful! I have made it with the orange sauce, but it's just as delicious without. You can serve it right out of the oven. Have some crusty bread to mop up the buttery and garlicky goodness!

My husband had just caught some fresh crab. I got home from work at 6:30pm and within 45 minutes we were sitting down to an AMAZING meal that anyone would pay big bucks for! Made the recipe as is (used a regular orange) and served with a green salad and olive bread... We were in heaven!

Clarified butter is just the oil separated from the milk solids -- the milk solids are where the cream and salt are -- don't use clarified butter!!!

Rating: 3
Very good! I doubled the sauce, but next time I'd double the butter and other ingredients, but leave the oil at 1/4cup -- butter separates anyway, so there's even more oil on top. I roasted my crab in a roasting pan on the grill so I wouldn't have crab smell in the house, worked great. Just put all the sauce in a pot and reduced it on the stove while crab cooked outside, then poured it on and let it cook a few minutes more. Two crabs were MORE than enough for two big eaters - four servings with bread is more like it.

Giving it three forks as I didn't make the sauce. I really wanted an oven-roasted crab that was similar to Crustaceans and this was pretty darn good (I believe they use some other seasonings I don't have on hand). I made this for Mother's Day Brunch and it was a hit. Excellent as I have never seen my mother-in-law enjoy a meal so much before. The seasoning and butter sauce are excellent. I'm planning to make it this weekend for my family.

Fantastic. Made this quick and easy recipe for a family gathering and everyone loved it, including the kids.

Very nice. Used fresh crabs, which I boiled for 8 minutes before baking. Would it work to just bake fresh crab? Left out the red pepper and didn't miss it. Used clarified butter that I had on hand - probably better than regular butter. substituted half lemon and half orange for the juice. This will be a regular recipe at the cabin this summer, so long as I catch enough crab!

This was a quick and easy recipe that yielded delicious results.Used Alaskan King crab legs from Costco. Only had dried thyme on hand, but next time will use fresh. Will make it again, for sure!

recipe was delicious but hubby thought the sauce overpowered the delicate crab taste. he doesn't like lemon on ANY fish so I should have figured... overall, very easy recipe. Nice presentation. Skip the blood orange sauce and stick w/ the butter etc if you want to really taste the dungeness crabmeat. we got the crabs shipped in from City Fish @ Pike's Place Market, Seattle WA. Excellent job w/ picked crab & nice cleaned whole for my party!

This is a really great way to serve crab. I have made it twice now--the second time I cut down the butter amount to 1/4 cup and we liked it more. Also, the first time I used a regular orange and the second time a blood orange. the blood orange added an extra level.

Guess I'm a purist. Dungeness crab is one of our favorites and usually I just go with steaming and clarified butter. For me, the crushed red pepper overpowered the flavor of the crab. The orange flavor was nice. Dungeness crab has such a delicate light flavor, I just want to taste that.

Recently had a fresh crab feed for friends, cooking 20+ crab for a like number of guests. Separated 7 for oven-roasting according to this recipe, and they were the hit of the evening! Made everything a day ahead and then combined with the crab just before serving for an easy and tasty meal. Mopping up the roasting tray butter, herbs and garlic with crusty fresh bread may have been even more popular than the crab, which is hard to do.

I cooked and cracked the crabs myself (see video instructions on youtube). I used 3 medium size crabs and served 4 people. I added some small nugget sized yukon gold potatoes and green beans and served in large bowls with bread and lots of napkins on hand. I did not use the organge juice but sprinkled with lemon and parsley. I will make again.

Easy and delicious, great when Costco has their crab special........Made twice the sauce as some had suggested. I think the amount in the recipe is sufficient. Twice a year will be enough.

Exceptional crab dish! I followed the recipe exactly other than cutting back slightly on the amount of butter and olive oil used, and reducing the oven temp. to 400 degrees. Also, the recipe states that this serves 2 people. No way. With bread, and salad, this would easily serve 3 or 4 people.

This is amazing! Followed recipe, but used only 1 teas. red pepper flakes and regular orange.

If I were a Dungeness Crab, I would willingly hop into the pot just to be covered with this sauce! It's sooo good! I doubled the sauce as many people suggested and I don't really know if we needed to...we had a lot left over (which is ok because it's great to dunk some crusty sourdough into!!) I used half lemon half orange juice and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This was some of the best crab I've eaten. Can't wait to make it again!! YUM!

This was the first time I had ever prepared dungeness crab. I have had dungeness in the past and always wanted to try it. This recipe was better than any restaurant's dungeness that I've ever had. Delectable. The 'sauce' was fairly nonexistant, I used a little less butter and a little more dried red pepper and it was beautifully glazed with a spicy, buttery sauce. fingerlickin' good.

This was so wonderful. Made two crabs and doubled the sauce. There is lots of sauce leftover, but we enjoyed having the big bowl of it to dip the crab in (didn't pour sauce over crabs). The sauce is so spectacular, I will find a way to use it all week. (Must love garlic to enjoy -- must have dining companion who doesn't mind getting close to you after this dinner.) Added about a cup of a dry pinot gris to the crabs before putting them in the oven. I too was skeptical about the OJ, but it softened the garlic and complemented the crabmeat. We ignored the rest of the meal -- corn on cob and asparagus/green bean/heirloom salad with herbs -- to concentrate on the gorgeous crabs. Lovely!

This dish should reek of garlic. The crushed red pepper was so dominate we tasted very little garlic. Next time I will double, or triple the garlic and reduce the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. I will also increase the sauce by 50%-100%.

Added a bit of chardonnay, maybe heavier on the pepper flakes than called for (I'm not good at exact measurements), BOY, was this GOOD!!! All you Costco fans, when they have they seafood rodeo, grab the crabs and go crazy!

Oh this was yummy. I usually warmed crab in a pot with butter and wine, but it was hard to get the flavorings in a large pot full of crab. This receipe spreads it out in a larger pan and also the roasting really makes a difference. I added about 1 cup of a sweet reisling toward the end of the roasting time and served the "broth" in bowls with the crab. Add a little parsley for garnish. With sourdough bread for dipping it was a hit for Christmas eve.

An excellent alternative to crab with drawn butter. I followed the recipe exactly but did not have enough sauce left to make the orange reduction so I just served it in a little bowl to drizzle over the crab. Will definitely double the sauce next time as other have suggested. I recommend straining the sauce before making the reduction.

I've made this with Dungeness and King crab, and love it. I don't usuallly like orange flavor in dishes, but it's not overly "orangey", the sweetness of the orange mixed withthe sweetness fo the crab, coated in hot butter is unbeleivable. VERY good.

Instead of serving the sauce over the crab, I put it in its own dish and presented it as a dipping sauce. I also made cayenne lime butter and an asian sauce- the orange reduction was my favorite. This was my first time making crab, and it came together nicely! I didn't have any trouble- used about half blood orange and half regular orange juice. Tasty and unique, would be great with shrimp!

Excellent. Easy to prepare and fast (30 minutes tops) After making it a few times I have come to the conclusion that navel oranges have more flavor than the blood orange. Also, snow crab is the best crab to use. The slightly saltier flavor of the crab cuts the sweetness of the orange perfectly.

Nice flavor. Next time I will at least double the sauce for dipping; made an appetizer for 2 people with one large crab and even then we wanted more sauce. The sauce is fantastic with a baggette. Used lemon juice b/c I like that better with thyme. Next time, I will try it with oj and tarregon.

I passed on this recipe a few times, as I believe crab needs nothing but a little lemon, but this is fantastic! I did the saute at home, then took it to a friends for the baking. We all loved it and was great as left-overs. We didn't make the orange sauce, so can't comment on it. Make this dish!

The store had a sale on Dungeness crab yesterday and we got some, but, being from Nebraska, where Dungeness crab is not in great supply, I didn't actually have any idea how to cook it.

Made this for Valentine's Day last night and it had my Valentine moaning - which is the desired effect, no? Didn't have the red pepper so used a dash of cayenne which gave it a nice gentle background heat. And then what put it over the top was adding a pinch of saffron along with the garlic and shallots. I concur with my fellow San Franciscan that normally I am a purest when it comes to Dungies, but this was quite simply the best crab dish I have had in a long time.

I made this for my Valentine last night and was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh dungeness crab. I really love hot, spicy food. Jalopenos and Tabasco make daily appearances in my cooking, but the amount of red pepper flakes in this recipe was far too much for me. It simply overwhelmed the wonderful, sweet flavor of the crab. However, I really like the orange juice with the other ingredients and might try it all again with much less hot pepper. Also, salt should be used very sparingly if at all in this recipe. In the opinion of this San Franciscan, anything that detracts from or covers up the flavor of the crab should be avoided. We usually just serve the crab with a combination of melted butter, lemon juice and a bit of garlic. Not too many things get better than that.

Phenominal. the sauce is one of the est I've had. I served this for valentine's day and it was a great success.The blood orange is the key. It really adds a dimension and cuts through the spiciness of the red pepper. I served this with french green beans and rosmary focaccia. A perfect dish for two!
