I can sum this recipe up in two words: Booooor-ing. Broiling the vegetables and sausage didn't allow the flavors to meld. Won't be making this again.

We had this recipe tonight. It was wonderful, and EASY! I added four cloves of garlic (we like garlic...), used sweet onions, and had to substitute anaheim peppers. After the dish came out of the oven, I added some diced tomatoes, and served it over pasta. Yummy! We will definitely be having this again.

What a wonderful dish. Delicious and easy, it's a favorite with my family and guests. I often use shallots, sauteed in olive oil or butter in place of or in addition to some sweet or red onions. If I can't get the peppers, I'll use red/orange/yellow bells which also work wonderfully. Finally, I serve it over creamy polenta mixed with mascarpone cheese - the perfect complement and so delicious.

This was a crowd-pleaser and so easy to make. Fabulous to serve along-side vegetarian lasagna - made everybody happy!

With all the rave reviews, I am heartily disappointed. It got 2 stars because it's sausage and peppers - how bad can it be? Well, it was a waste of good sausage. I'm going to simmer the leftovers in some tomato sauce and I know it will be better. But, as is - eh.

Absolutely delicious! Simple ingredients, but they combine to deliver the most flavorful experience. I used a baguette to soak up the juices ... don't miss out on the bread!

This was excellent! I considered doing this in a fry pan because I was worried it might not cook evenly under the broiler but wow it really worked and it was so easy. As everyone has said: serve with bread. The juices are fabulous.

This was outstanding the first time I made it, when I made it as written. The next time I was going from memory and forgot that it was supposed to go in the broiler -- I sauteed in a pan over medium heat. I don't know why, but the difference was dramatic. Never again in the pan- it turned out much oilier, and not nearly as good. I thought I'd pass that on for anyone who was contemplating skipping the broiling. Broil!

for years i'd wondered why my sausage and peppers were so bland. i tried garlic, i tried adding tomatoes...i ,even, tried hot peppers to no avail... the fennel has solved the problem. also, i was using green peppers as opposed to cubanelles... i'm not a great fan of broiling, so i pan fried the dish and i did add some light garlic and some red pepper slivers for color. it came out great over linguini with an asparagus side...

This is wonderful!!!! Easy, tasty, comfort food with a flair. I served it with Collard-cannon with ale-braised onions & raw milk cheddar from a really fun cooking blog. (I added it to my blog, too!) Just search for the recipe title and you'll find it.

Very tasty! I made this exactly as written, and served it with toasted Italian bread. We loved it, and will make it again soon.

This does not make for a pretty presentation, but it was so very good. Me and my husband found it delicious, but my seven year old hated all the vegetables (not much of a suprise).

This is a great recipe that relies totally on the sausage. I like using half hot and half mild sausages, and I substituted Anaheim peppers as I couldn't get Cubanelles. A good wine and crusty bread for dipping (absolutely necessary, the juices are amazing) and the easiest throw-together dinner. I have made it twice and love it.

This is delicious! It sounds so basic, but the flavors blend wonderfully and the broiler cooks everything beautifully. I'll definitely make this again!

Have never reviewed before, altho I use this website all the time with great results so after this fabulous dish, I felt compelled to share with others. I made this for a holiday and it was a huge hit--very, very flavorful (even tho there are no seasonings except for salt) and extremely easy. I used half sweet, half hot sausages from the butcher which may have added to the flavors. Even my Sicilian sister-in-law hoarded the left-overs for herself after packing everyone a doggy bag of the other food. Foolproof!

A delicious and easy recipe! I pan fried all ingredients. With prep and cooking time, dinner was ready in less than 30 minutes. In the future, I will definitely double the onion, pepper and fennel and serve with hearty bread.

Really tasty! I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was also very easy--and broiling make so much less mess than frying. I tossed in a zucchini I had lying around, and that was good too.

Lovely easy weeknight supper. Be sure to cut out the base of the fennel bulb, so it falls into leaves like the onion and pepper. Otherwise it will take an hour to cook, not 20 minutes. Add a jar of drained, lightly chopped sundried tomatoes halfway through cooking. Serve over creamy polenta (we like it enriched with mascarpone)

A delicious, easy and attractive one-pan recipe that's suitable for casual entertaining. Just add a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread.

I'm with Kairee, my late, great, italian grandmother always cooked sausages and peppers like this, but without the fennel. And caramelizing the onions is key. It's so long now, I can't remember if she fried or roasted the dish, I think fried. Anyways, the fennel was a nice addition, and by all means, make lots/double the recipe, and serve with plenty of hearty bread to soak up the juices! Oh the juices... By the way, the leftovers (if you have any!) make a great sandwhich filling, especially hot up with some fresh mozzarella on ciabatta.

I LOVED the fennel in this; somehow it made what could otherwise be a "heavy" meal, seem lighter. Perfect as is; serve with steamed white rice.

I've made this "dish" since I first started cooking as a child, except without the fennel bulb. It seems like an interesting twist on what I always assumed was the most typical way of cooking Italian sausages and peppers. You have to like Fennel for this to work for you, hence only 3 stars. For color, and because I like them, I have often used sweet red bell peppers instead of the Italian Frying Peppers. I have also always fried this dish. First cook the sausages in a large skillet or everyday pan, take them out once browned nicely and mostly cooked through, fry the onions and peppers in the sausage grease. While they are caramelizing, slice the peppers. Re-add them to the skillet and cook until done.
