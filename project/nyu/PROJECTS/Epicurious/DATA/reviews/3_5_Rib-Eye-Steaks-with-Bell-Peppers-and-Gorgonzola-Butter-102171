I love the taste of Gorgonzola with steak, but have added a twist...I mash a tablespoon of whiskey with the cheese and butter! Its fantastic! A family fave!

This was delicious... the gorgonzola butter was a fantastic plus to this tasty marinade. One exclusion was the peppers... and we didn't miss them. Delicious!

I prefer sharper tasting recipes. I reduced the peppers and increased the cheese.

It works with half the peppers, unless you really love them. The marinade was delicious, and the gorgonzola butter made a nice addition. A lot of strong flavors.

This was an easy, colorful, and flavorful summer presentation. I served it to company with a wild mushroom risotto.
