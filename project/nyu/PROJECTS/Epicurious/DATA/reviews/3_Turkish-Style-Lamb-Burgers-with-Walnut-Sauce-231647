I often make this recipe when having guests over for the first time. It is very easy to prepare and is a bit unexpected (without seeming like you tried too hard). Presentation on the mini pitas is very sophisticated. Important to have the fresh herbs (and dried herbs that are not too old)--even so, I often double the allspice and paprika. I like to serve it with a tomato salad and roasted potatoes.

I have made this recipe many times -- it is really good! I also like to add greek yogurt to the walnut sauce -- gives it great texture.

The burgers are EXCELLENT but did not care for the walnut sauce at all. I did not put the cayenne in the sauce and maybe that was part of the problem. We made a yogurt sauce instead and it was great. My husband grilled the burgers and they were incredible. YUM!

I have to agree with the cook from Carbondale. These burgers are fabulous. Better even than my brother-in-law's meatballs.

I love this recipe as does everyone I know who has tasted it. I saute the onions and add a bit more lemon juice to the walnut sauce, then I cook the burgers on my George Forman grill. I never serve with the pita bread.

I didn't make the sauce; the burgers were great with the sole exception of the raw onions--which were pervasive. Next time I'll saute 'em and then combine with the herbs, etc.

Made this last night and it was very good. The burgers were light and a little meat went a long way. The sauce was a little garlicy, but good (not enough though -- made double). I used hot paprika and skipped the pita bread.

Despite the terrible previous review I tried it anyway, thinking the combination of all these ingredients had to be good. Well, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't great. A few improvements would be to use olive oil in the walnut sauce instead of water which made the sauce too weak and thin. The burgers could use double the recommended spices (including salt) or more and maybe a garlic clove.

One fork is way too generous! Love lamb, eat it all the time, so that wasn't the problem. We made the sauce first, and on it's own it was good, and as a bonus, low fat. The lamb burgers were like a bad meat loaf, and the combination of the lamb with this particular sauce was truly awful. I've never had such a poor experience with a recipe from here. And I've never published such a negative review, but folks, don't waste your time, or money on this one.

I have never encountered such a bad recipe from here. Both my husband and I love lamb, and were very excited about a fun new way to make it. Started by making the walnut sauce, and thought it was really good, and as a bonus really low in fat. Hmmm, a good start, and could really imagine the flavors blending with the lamb. Then the lamb, all the ingredients seemed to be right together, but that's where it ended. Poor husband spooned the sauce all over the lamb and what an awful combo. And the consistency of the lamb was more like a bad meatloaf. We bought the lamb from a local farmer and really looked forward to trying it since we have chops on order. I can only say that we followed the recipe, I've never posted such a negative review, but folks, don't waste your time or money on this dish.
