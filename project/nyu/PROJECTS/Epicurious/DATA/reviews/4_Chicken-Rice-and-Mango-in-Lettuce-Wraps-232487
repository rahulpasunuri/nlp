My family loves this. The only change I make is using non-fat unflavored yoghurt instead of mayo in the dressing. And when hurried, I just buy a pre-cooked chicken--works fine.

I have previously review this awesome recipe. Last time I made it, I had left over dressing so I froze it. I just un-thawed it and it still tastes great.

Good. Added garlic to the dressing. They are messy...a salad would be a better idea with all these ingredients. It took me a lot longer than I expected to make, and was more filling than I expected. Overall a good refreshing dinner. I would cook rice in chicken stock next time ,and add more crushed red pepper.

This was one of the best Sunday family dinners I have ever made. After reading the reviews, I decided to reconstruct rather than change anything. For the chicken, I used boneless, skinless thighs cut into bite-sized cubes marinaded for a few hours in the lime marinade with an augmentation of cilantro. Just prior to eating, I skewered and grilled them. When done grilling,I removed from skewers and placed on a platter mixing with the remaining lime marinade. Made Jasmine rice as indicated (alright, I confess, added a bit of butter too). The rice was served as a side dish. Dressing needed nothing more or less, absolutely perfect as is. I made a salad using butter lettuce, mango, cucumber, avocado and celery. Had lots of dressing leftover. As another side,I made Chinese Garlic Broccolii. Everyone raved about this meal, even a few picky, picky eaters.

Yay! This recipe is great:) I will make it again for sure! I increased the chicken to 3 large breasts as I knew I wanted leftovers. I did not grill the chicken as the recipe suggested, instead I pounded it thin, broiled it, and cut it into cubes. This worked great and I didn't have to mess around with firing up the grill. In terms of veggies, they were all great and added something special to the dish. But next time I might change the cut of some of the veggies and mix some of them together. There were way too many bowls used for the presentation of the recipe. I am in agreement that turning the recipe into a salad is a great idea, and that is what I did with the leftovers. On a note, I made the entire recipe for the dressing and there was a ton left over. Next time I will cut it in half for sure.

YUM!! This this dish is fantastic. I simplified it by not using the lettuce as a wrap. Instead I threw it all together in one large bowl to make a huge salad. The heat wilted the lettuce... which tasted much better than it sounds. Later in the week, I used the left over mayo dressing to cook some fish fillets in parchment paper. So yummy.

I've made these fabulous wraps many times,however, today was the first time I thought to mix leftover dressing, cucumber and green onion over some cold angel hair pasta. Perfect, especially with a little added hot sauce.

Wow! I made this for my daughter-in-law's baby shower for 20! Grilled 5 lbs of Trader Joe's boneless chicken breasts. Mixed it all together and served with rice, a salad and the dressing. In that quantity I did the scallions and cucumber by sight and used 2 lbs of mango. I really wanted to mix the salad and the rice togeter with the dressing- which I have done in smaller quantities- but thought for a crowd it was better to serve them separately. It was wonderful. I put it all togetheer in the morning and was able to enjoy my own party

This recipe is amazing! I love the combination of flavors. I stopped eating meat but couldn't bring myself to stop making this dish, so I've tweaked it a little bit and turned it into a vegetarian salad which is still amazing and flavorful.

Oh, I can't wait to make this recipe again when the weather is hot! This was so delicious, brightened up a grey February. The ginger dressing is amazing and definitely worth the effort, plus you'll have some leftover for later. There's a bit of assembly involved, but it's easy, fun, and worth it. Made as written, with minor exception; added julienne carrots to the array for added color and crunch. Loved it.

My husband made this for dinner. The mangos he purchased were bad, so we used mandarin oranges. Still very good. We love the ginger dressing too. Next time, I think we may add some toasted almonds. It also tasted great on day 2.

We loved this recipe. I don't know who took the time to put the dressing together, but it's great. We used ripe nectarines instead of the mango, which worked out fine (there weren't any ripe mangoes available). There was literally nothing left. And we ALWAYS have leftovers. Highly recommended.

OK, this is about my 4th or 5th time to make these and my 3rd review. I REALLY like them :) The last two times I've done as other reviewers have suggested and wrapped everything up in rice paper wrappers. I just made them for dinner tonight and made a couple of substitutions: I always just poach two chicken breasts and shred them up; I used lime ponzu and veg oil to dress the chicken and used slivers of red bell pepper because I was out of cucumber. So delicious! This is SUCH a great summer recipe - it's 110 degrees today, so I'm chilling the rolls and the sauce for a refreshing dinner. Aahhh.

I was looking for a recipe where I could use some leftover, grilled, Asian pork tenderloin. This sounded like a great recipe to use. Other than substituting pork for the chicken, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I both thought that this was fantastic, and we'd make it again in a heartbeat. We agree with other reviewers that the dressing is fabulous. It was a wonderful dish for a very hot, steamy New England evening.

I have made this twice and my family absoltely loves it! The dressing is amazing and everything together is really delicious. I make one modification: add a few sliced jalapenos in with the salad.

Whole family loved this! I would probably try both the soy dressing and the lime vinaigrette with less oil. I only put 1/4 cup in the soy dressing and I think it would be fine w/o it. Might try it is a regular salad, as the the wraps were hard to eat.

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC - dressing is to die for, delicious mix of flavors. That said, even if you're starting with leftover chicken and rice, this is not a workday meal. The sauces, the chopping..... Have served these completely assembled on a 3-tier platter at a buffet. Beautiful presentation - all gone in 10 minutes.

This is an excellent recipe.My guests loved it. The dressing is awesome! I served it as a "make your own salad" with mesclun instead of trying to stuff all those yummy ingredients in a small bibb lettuce leaf.

I reviewed this recipe before but only made the dressing. Last night I made the entire recipe and it blew us away! This is better than any lettuce wrap we've ordered in any restaurant. Next time I will probably not worry about cutting everything in matchsticks and will just dice, unless I'm trying to impress company or something. Great recipe!!

The dressing is fabulous, I've made it many, many times. Today I found myself without any fresh ginger. Ground ginger didn't sound right so I added half a cup of fresh cilantro leaves. Not as good as the original, but very good anyway.

The sesame-ginger dressing was amazingly flavorful and delicious. I used low sodium soy sauce. There are two dressings and I thought the lime vinaigrette was not totally necessary and came out oily. This worked well as a salad with spinach or with a flour tortilla.

Rating: 4
Excellent, rich, flavorful dressing. The sesame oil lends an Asian flair to the whole meal. Very fresh flavors and extremely light for a summer dinner. Fun for guests to assemble, since they can customize the toppings to their liking. Beware, these can get a bit messy, though - delightfully so!

This meal is really flavorful and tasty. I knew I was only going to have about 30 minutes to get this dish on the table, so to save time I used rotisserie chicken from the store, diced the veggies and mango, sliced the green onions, and added them to the shredded chicken mixture. It all worked perfectly and it was quick enough for a mid-week meal. If I was having guests on the weekend, that's when I would take the time to make matchstick cuts and do a more elegant presentation.

Use brown rice, splenda or stevia, minimal oil, non-fat yogurt, low sodium soy sauce, be careful to NOT over grille the chicken, try and find butter or bibb lettuce as they are more supple than romaine. Romaine can be used though and is fine.. This recipe easily makes enough for 4 adults. Don't eliminate the the lime vinaigrette which is used for the marinade for the chicken and can be used to dribble inside the lettuce wrap. THE VINAIGRETTE RECIPE IS INCLUDED IN THE GRILLED CHICKEN WITH SHREDDED MESCLUN SALAD; THE FIRST FIVE INGREDIENTS. GOOD LUCK. MIGHT DO PREP THE DAY BEFORE.

I agree the dressing is delish. Mind you, however, this is not a "quick & easy" recipe since there are 2 sauces to compile as well as 4 items to chop or slice into matchsticks.

We loved this recipe! I used only half the oil for the marinade, and cooked all of the marinade in the pan with the chicken. I also replaced the mayo in the dressing with greek yogurt, and it was delicious. Only thing is, the wraps are a bit hard to handle! We bought rice paper wraps for the next time we try it- I'm thinking put the lettuce inside, close it up, and use the dressing as a dip. But regardless we will definitely make this again soon.

The first time I made these exactly as the recipe reads and they were outstanding, but a bit of work. Last night I made them with the following adjustments: used shredded rotisserie chicken tossed with lime juice, leftover brown rice, and romaine lettuce because the market was out of bibb and boston. Preparation was quicker and they tasted just as good. My husband LOVES these!

Absolutely terrific, everyone loved it. Makes waaaaaay too much dressing (cut it to 1/4) and I'll double the cucumber and mango next time.

My husband went crazy over this, and I admit that they were very good. I cheated in the interest of time and effort and used bottled ginger salad dressing mixed with a little mayonnaise. When I have more time I'll try the dressing here. I stuck to the recipe on everything else though, and it was great. We liked that it was a nice light summer meal, but definitely fills you up!

My husband and parents absolutely loved this recipe. It is light and easy to make, but the "quick and easy" tag is deceiving because you have to grill the chicken, too- it ended up taking me about 1.5 - 2 hours total. I thought it was a bit bland, but the flavors do pair nicely with each other.

These wraps were incredible--a quick, easy meal that was both healthy and delicious. I skipped the mayonnaise in the dressing but didn't feel that anything was missing (in fact, I used the leftover dressing on salad and got rave reviews). I also added 1/4 cup minced pickled ginger, which gave the wraps a nice kick. The cilantro can be replaced with basil or parsely.

This is truly awesome. We love lettuce wraps, and now I'm not sure we're ever going to have to go for them again... Just to be fair, I used pea sprouts instead of cucumber because they were about to go on me. I also made the rice with some oil and shallots, but that's definitely not necessary in the future. I made the dressing & vinagrette exactly as written, and goodness. I could eat this all day long. My boyfriend, in fact, ate so many I was a little worried about him (at least there were veggies involved)! Oh, and by the way, the mango and cilantro are non-negotiable ingredients; they add that sweetness and that "something extra".

This recipe is fantastic, easy and very flavorful. I modified a couple of things. First I just sqeezed fresh lime juice on the chicken as I was grilling, also I added chipolte hummus and bean sprouts and reduced the mayo in the dressing for more of a "south beach" take. My family loved it and I am going to make it with shrimp next time.

This dish was quite yummy and fun too. The wraps were a little messy but maybe that's because we were so hungry we couldn't be neat. I have an unfortunate allergy to mangoes so I substituted figs and avocados, which was really good. My limes were bone dry so I did a last minute substitution of orange juice with champagne vinegar and I think it did the trick. The sauce was the best part-- it would be great on just about any vegetable!

I doubled this this last night for a party and it was a huge hit. Every component is delicious separately and they all work together beautifully.

In reply to the enquiry from switzerland, the nearest UK equivalents would be sold simply as "flat" or "round" lettuce - i.e a wide soft leaf. However my local chinese does serve lamb wraps in the dreaded iceberg, a contrast which only works if the filling is hottish and well-flavoured. HTH.

Switzerland, this is from the Epicurious Dictionary: "butterhead lettuce" One of two varieties of head lettuce (the other being CRISPHEAD). Butterhead lettuces have small, round, loosely formed heads with soft, buttery-textured leaves ranging from pale green on the outer leaves to pale yellow-green on the inner leaves. The flavor is sweet and succulent. Because the leaves are quite tender, they require gentle washing and handling. Boston and Bibb (also called limestone) lettuce are the two most well known of the butterhead family. The smaller Bibb is highly prized by gourmets. Both Boston and Bibb lettuce are sometimes referred to simply as "butterhead" or "butter" lettuce. See also LETTUCE
