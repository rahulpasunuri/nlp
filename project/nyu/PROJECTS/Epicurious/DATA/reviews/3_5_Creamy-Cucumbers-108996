Very good. Halved the recipe for the dressing, but used a little less than that. Also added some dried dill. Might add radishes next time.

My German mom will love this! I didn't have red onion so I substituted sweet Vadalia. Mmmmmm. Another bonus: SUPER EASY!

very easy, simple flavors, but next time I may try a few of the other suggestions.

Four forks only for this variation: 2 tsp Salt on sliced cukes and let drain for hour (can be rinsed for lower sodium diets). Use rice vinegar in place of cider vinegar. Add fresh dill weed (1/4 cup or so). I found this recipe in Vienna - it's great!!

This comes so close to what Grandma used to make! But so much better for us! I used reduced ff sour cream, sugar substitute & it was great. :)

Very simple and very good. I just made it for the second time last night. The first time I made it I used all the sour cream dressing--as the recipe implies. To me, the salad seemed overdressed. I'd suggest adding the dressing to taste rather than all at once.

Easy to make; nice variation on cucumber salad. I would serve this again.

Maybe it's a summer dish and so just somehow doesn't fit a snowy winter evening ... but this went over poorly. Added a bit of lemon zest, used combination of light sour cream and regular yogurt (what was on hand). UPDATE: these got better overnight, used leftovers on spinach salad as 'dressing'. Will definitely make again ...

Simple, tasty and a nice side dish on a hot day. What more could you want?

This is a true german dish. My family loved it. I always make something similar to this but without the red onion. The red onion was a nice compliment to it for the presentation as well as the flavor. I will definitely make this again. I served it with sauerbraten and spaetzle as well as potatoe kugel. A true german meal!
