When I read this recipe, I though, "Won't the mushrooms would disappear in the blue cheese sauce," but I read the reviews and decided to try it as written (exactly). I used a pound of fresh chanterelles from the farmer's market this morning, and... that was a waste of $9. For all practical purposes, you get a little of the mushroom texture, but not a lot of the mushroom flavor. I used a mix of French roquefort and a local goat blue cheese, but I could have prepared this with regular white mushrooms from the supermarket and not been two percent off from the more expensive wild mushroom version. That said, the dish was quite good and everyone had seconds (at least). It's a great recipe, but like many great recipes, there is a superfluous ingredient here that adds expense instead of flavor. Save the money and use any mushroom (white, crimini, portabello, oyster) from the supermarket.

This could be improved tremendously by making a hot bleu cheese sauce instead of merely mixing cold cream and crumbled bleu. It came out with a grainy, runny consistency. Be sure to use cream - half-and-half doesn't substitute well in this recipe.

Made this recipe for the first time today and everyone loved it. I used crimini mushrooms, and sauteed them with some chopped shallots and fresh garlic before adding the herbs. I also added some sherry and simmered them until all of the liquid was absorbed. I cut the cream in half, and next time, I think I would replace the cream altogether with milk, using perhaps 1.75 cups instead of 2.5. It was plenty rich due to the blue cheese. I used one of the plastic mandolins to get the potato slices super thin, and this made a big difference. Even still, I would have cooked this another 10 minutes longer just to get them extra soft and buttery tasting. The only other change is that I added a layer of kale over the mushrooms, which was delicious, and on the very top, sprinkled some parmesan which browned nicely. I would definitely recommend some kale or chard if you have some lying around, as it adds some nice texture and flavor (as well as your leafy green vitamins).

Fabulous! My husband raved. Used 1 c skim milk for 1 c cream and it was fine. Added garlic.

Very nice! Nothing is overpowering, it's very balanced and pleasent. I think I would try a bit of onion with the mushroooms next time. Also, if you do not like your mushrooms very well done I just poured some of the juice out.

I found this recipe a few years ago and it has been my go-to special occasion potato dish ever since. It's sinfully scrumptious and simple to throw together. Mmmmm, I want some right now.

Rating: 4
This was sooooo amazing!! I used a mixture of crimini, oyster and shitake mushrooms. I also threw in some chopped garlic while sauteeing the mushrooms and used a Danish blue cheese. Instead of all cream, I used 1 cup of milk, and 1 1/2 cups of cream, just to lighten it up a bit. Instead of trying to smush the cheese with a fork, I instead gently heated the milk/cream mixture on the stove, and melted the cheese into it, it's so much easier. I don't know if it was the potatoes I was using, but I found I had to bake for an extra 20 minutes than what was stated in the recipe. This is going to be a family favorite for years to come.

I've made this several times - it's fantastic. Everyone has loved it. With this recipe, you can use really stinky cheese because the combination doesn't allow the flavor of the cheese to overpower the dish. I've always used dried thyme, and this dish has always been positively wonderful. Good for potlucks, side dishes, or even a main dish if you have family willing to forego meat... just great!

I make this for many potlucks, and if there's leftovers, hooray! But there's never leftovers. Add garlic for a bit more flavor.

I've made this dish several times now for many different circles of friends, and it's consistently the table favorite. Even for the picky eaters who claim they don't like mushrooms or blue cheese, this dish is always a stunning success. I try to pair the mushroom selection to match the blue cheese. For a more subtle blue like maytag, I go for a more subtle mushroom like oysters or crimini. For a stronger blue like gorgonzola, I generally pick a bold mushroom that can stand up to such flavors, such as porcinis.

Rating: 4
So this was fantastic, and I made it the day before so flavors would meld. That was okay but the cream had a curdly consistency after reheating: next time I'll reheat more gently, just to warm. Also, I used a combination of oyster mushrooms, stemmed shiitake mushroom and black trumpet mushrooms. Although the black trumpets add good chew and a sweet little gracenote, they were a little gritty and turned the cream a little grayish. I'd probably not use portabellas for the same reason, they turn a creamy dish gray too. Stick with light colored mushrooms for great presentation.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish. Makes enough for 12- 14. Sliced potatoes w/ 1mm slicer - slices are fragile so empty processor bowl half way to avoid breakage. Don't bother peeling the potatoes if using Yukons. Used 1 c heavy cream, 1.5 c half n half. Transported well after baking and was quite forgiving in the holding pattern while everything else was being prepared. Re: Norwood MA's glass pan question - baking temps are different for glass vs. non-glass so if the recipe calls for a glass pan, the temp is usually 25 degrees lower than if it calls for a metal pan or doesn't specify. Hope that helps.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe used time and again for family get togethers. I've made this with other types of potatoes and have found that Yukons are the best hands down and the best (and most reasonably priced) mushrooms are a combination of oyster and crimini. Also, if you're looking to cut back on the fat with the whipping cream, fat-free evaporated milk is a reasonable substitute.

Rating: 4
This dish is very tasty, and I have added it to my file. It has much more flavor than a basic au gratin or scalloped potato recipe. I made it as directed using about 1/2 portobello and 1/2 crimini mushrooms. It tasted a little salty which may have been due to the type of blue cheese I used. I will only use 1/2 tsp. salt the next time I make it.

I have made this recipe several times. It is delicious. The first time I made it as is. Each time I make it I try some little changes. A always add a bit more thyme and add black pepper, try different types of blue cheese, and different types of mushrooms. I think I might try onions next. This has become a Christmas Eve tradition served with Prime Rib. Can't wait until next week to eat it again. Yum!

I made this last night for the first time exactly as written except my package of gorganzola had 6 os, not 5, so I put it all in--fantastic!! My guests were still raving and picking at the TINY bit of leftovers after the dessert had been cleared!

I didn't make this dish, but it reminds me of a side I make at my restaurant. I play this tune by ear, so use a little common sense and this recipe will definately be a keeper. Puree any leftovers with a little milk or light cream for a fabulous soup! In a 13x9x2 in. pan pour a little heavy cream, say 1/3 cup? Add one huge handful of peeled sliced potatoes of your choice (Idahos are great) and spread them evenly on bottom of dish then sprinkle....say 1/4 cup of shredded (not grated) parmesan cheese atop this, then another 1/4 cup creaqm over this. Do these layers at least 2 more times, maybe three if your pan will hold it all, ending with the top layer being cheese, then pour the heavy cream over all until it just comes up to almost brimming...say 1/4 in. shy :) Place uncovered (use drip pan) into a 350 deg F oven and bake until VERY BROWN. I mean until you get a milk chocolate colored brown overall and even darker in some spots. I make this dish in 2 in. hotel pans (#200 pans) so it takes about 2 hours for them to get done. Golden brown don't work (raw spuds). Now, you can add diced raw chicken breast to your layers, or cooked onion or mushrooms or whatever. Just make sure the veggies are cooked and the meat is raw when adding. You don't need any seasonings at all unless you wish to add a little nutmeg or black pepper. The cheese seasons everything beautifully....so use a good grade/brand. We use parm/reg or asiago.

Made for Thanksgiving to accompany prime rib. Fabulous! I didn't have Yukon golds, so used russets, sliced 1 mm. thin in the food processor. Used a mix of portobellos, shitakes, criminis, sliced thickly. I used gorgonzola and added about 3/4 cup of grated Emmentaler (Gruyere would do, too) divided between the mushroom layer and the top. Gave a crispy browned top and didn't overpower (I wouldnt' use more, though). This was very runny when it came out of the oven but thickened up perfectly as it sat for a bit. Perfect to make ahead, chill, rewarm to serve. The flavors only blend and get more developed. Great for breakfast the next day, too. This is one of my top two favorite gratins.

This was the uncontested favorite dish at my Thanksgiving dinner. I used about 3/4 pound sliced shitakes, and 1/4 pound portobello, chopped into 1/2 inch pieces (I didn't want big chunks, with their meaty texture). I used gorgonzola cheese, but next time would use something stronger. Other reviewers are right; I am not a big blue cheese fan, but you should use something pretty "stinky" in this, it can take it. I also sprinkled Parmesan on top for the last 30 minutes, which gave a nice crispy, brown top. I think the key to this is slicing the potatoes really thin; my potatoes were less than 1/8" thick, and they became extremely creamy. The Yukon Golds are also pretty essential, I think. A starchier potato would probably get pretty gunky and gross. Anyway, this was competely decadent and delicious!

We have found a new staple in our diet. I made this as a side for my wedding anniversary and it was fantastic.

Scrumdiddlyumptious!

I made this dish for my families annual cookoff competition. It won first prize! Very important to slice the Yukons as thin as possible. As much as I dislike stinky cheese, the stronger the Maytag, the more wonderful the dish. I used a variety of 'shrooms: morels, trumpet, crimini, oyster.. I don't think there is such a thing as a bad combo!

After 1 hr. of cooking, the potatoes were not cooked through and the dish was slightly dry. I sliced potatoes with 2mm Cuisinart Blade - perhaps this is too thick? I will definitely try again as this is a delicious dish and will perhaps cook the sliced potatoes in the milk/cheese sauce for a few minutes to soften them before assembling. Any suggestions?

I'm not the potato fan in the family, but this is an excellent "au gratin potato" dish. I've only made it with gorgonzola so far, but it's very mild and I don't think a bolder bleu cheese would be too much. I've made this with cream for a pot luck, but have also substituted various amounts of canned milk when I wanted to lighten it up for family. It changes the consistency somewhat, but I don't think it suffered for the change, especially if you are unwilling to make this because of the fat content. Dried mushrooms work as well as the fresh. Either way, I have never been asked for a recipe as many times as I've been asked for this one!

As everyone else is saying, this is a delicious combination of ingredients. While you can substitute with a light cream, I suggest trying it once in the original form.

This is terrific. I followed the directions exactly, no omission or additions. I used baby bella mushrooms, cooked until not watery. I think that is the reason the poatoes didn't discolor. It is rich, but then, you wouldn't eat it every day. I think it would stand on its own with a salad for a company lunch. I used Maytag crumbled blue cheese which you can buy in a plastic container.

A very tasty recipe. What's really nice is that although this dish is rich, it is not overwhelmingly heavy or difficult to digest. I had fresh sage and rosemary on hand so I used those instead of thyme and it worked very well. Due to the cost and availability of fresh wild mushrooms I bought a small bag of dried porcini mushrooms and cooked some button mushrooms in the soaking liquid (about 3/4 cup), which they of course soaked up. Next time I make this dish I will steam the potatoes for a bit because even though I cut them very finely they were still a little too crunchy. Served with a warm tomato and olive salad and a dry Reisling, YUM!

This is my favorite potato recipe; I've made it several times. Last time I made it, I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups half and half -- that works better than using milk, or even milk and half and half. I would bet this prevents the "soupiness" some people get with this recipe. I also throw in some garlic on occasion.

well I have made this at least five times with all sorts of different guests and all they want is more. I added a little more cream just so I would make sure it was moist enough.

This dish is terrific, but not for the calorie conscious (very rich)! It is VERY easy to make, very impressive, and is an unusual take on an old classic, with the added twist of the blue cheese flavor and mushrooms.

This potatoe dish is great. Tips: Make sure that all of the water has evaporated before taking the mushrooms off of the heat (to prevent a discolored, runny dish).

I used gorgonzola cheese, portobello mushrooms, and russet potatoes. I thought that with all of the other rich ingredients the mushrooms would be an overkill, but was pleasantly suprised.
