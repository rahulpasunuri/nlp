Excellent and incredibly easy... I would happily make this again. Loaf of great French bread and a salad and you're golden.

Wow, this was really good! We had no green onion, so I finely sliced a leek, and wilted it before adding the vermouth. A very special recipe, makes other steamed clam recipes blanch in comparison. I think it would be good with mussels too.

This was an awesome dish. I made it with out the red peppers though. Great with Angle Hair pasta! Just make sure you LOVE Cilantro.

We keep a bottle of vermouth around just for this dish. it's just about as simple as cooking can get, If you start off with some fresh clams (or well scrubbed mussels), I'm not sure how anyone can go wrong. When I'm putting together a dinner that has a few courses that require large time investments, this is my go to starter. Lots of bang for both the money and effort you put into it.

I have made this recipe several times and it is the best. I now use half white wine and half clam juice for the liquid. It always gets rave reviews.

I didn't have any sake so I used chicken stock and it wowrked well. The flavor was incredible! I will need to make this very often for my family!

didn't like the recipe. we made it with Vermouth and thought it was too strong of a flavor. Would have liked it with half wine half vermouth.

This is a wonderful dish. The red pepper lends a great heat, and the cilantro- as it is wont to do- adds a lovely flavor. Everyone had second helpings! We served broiled green beans tossed in olive oil and pine nuts, kosher salt and pepper on the side.

I thought the other reviewers were crazy. I love clams, but how good can steamed clams be?? These are the absolute BEST. The broth is so good I ate my entire week's limit of carbs soaking up the broth. It is so fast and simple ... you should try it!

This is a quick, easy, and delish meal anytime. Have lots of crusty bread for the buttery, spicy, sake sauce.

Oh my God! It was a dark and stormey night. I wanted steamed clams. This was not for a party or anything special, I just wanted steamed clams. I was looking for something simple, with things I had on hand. All I can say is that I'm glad I didn't make this for guests because they would have gotten none! I accidently bought 4 lbs of clams and figured I would have to use about 2lbs on something else. Ha, Ha, my wife and I ate the whole thing. There were NO leftovers. My dinner guests will never get this dish because it is too good to share! Make your own cause you can't have any of mine!

This is fabulous! I find myself making it again and again as an easy and unique appetizer for guests. Red pepper adds a great kick. I often double the sauce portion so there is extra for dipping that crusty bread in!

Loved this! I have done a similar recipe with cilantro that is just as good. I used red onion (no green in the house), and i used 1C dry white wine, 1C dry sherry and 1C fresh veggie broth i had in the fridge. About 12 garlic cloves (4 isn't nearly enough!), doubled the Worchestershire and tripled the red pepper and it still wasn't kicked up enough but nicely spiced. Next time, add some potatoes and even some sausage for a full course meal!

Very good recipe. Quick and easy to make. My picky husband loved it.

This was the last dish I prepared for dinner I planned with my family. I had to improvise quickly at the end. I didn't have the crushed red peppers but used green chili peppers instead. Thought I had enough dry vermouth stashed away, but only had about a cup or so, so I added some vegetable broth to make up the quantity. I also added some chopped onions I had left over from another recipe. My family absolutely loved it. It went pretty fast. For this reason alone, I should've given it 4 forks, but I personally felt like something was missing, though I was told otherwise. This is definitely a keeper and next time I will follow the recipe to a T.

Fast, easy, and delightuful. I must confess that I used sherry for the liquid as I did not have on hand what was called for. The juice was incredible, reguardless. Very nice results for such a minimal investment in time. Good for two or for a crowd... that is, if you can find it in your heart to share them!

I picked up a dozen littleneck clams for a snack and found this recipe to steam them. Had everything on hand, except for the cilantro. I tried it anyway with just the green onions, garlic, dry vermouth, red pepper flakes, worstershire sauce, and unsalted butter and found myself using the empty clam shells as spoons to drink the sauce. It was outstanding. Try it. You'll love it!!

I've made other clam recipes that require more work with less flavor. This one is an all-time favorite with simple ingredients and minimal prep required. You'll love the flavor if you love clams.

This was a fabulous dish and so easy to make! I actually saw this recipe on Bon Appetit (August 2003) and made it for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner. Everyone loved did and couldn't get enough of the broth --Delish!!!!

This was so easy and the flavor absolutely wonderful. Have always shyed away from steamed clams because thought it would be alot of work and difficult but this was a snap to prepare. We also dipped bread into the broth and yum. If you like cilantro, you will love this recipe.

A friend of ours had a "Clambake" last night and made this recipe. Fabulous. I can't wait to make it myself.

This dish was absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half, and it was perfect for 2-3 people. I used saki in the recipe and it gave the broth a wonderful flavor. I served the clams over spinach fettucini with a salad on the side and a bottle of pino grigio, and my guests were VERY pleased.
