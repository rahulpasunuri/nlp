Great recipe. I made this as a dessert to bring to a dinner party and received rave reviews. I was a little worried that the ginger would be too strong of a flavor, but it really mellowed in the oven. I served it with a homemade cardamom ice cream, which complimented the spices perfectly. Would definitely make this dessert again!

Gorgeous! We served this after a Chinese banquet and all the guests gobbled it up. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and chilled the pastry for longer than an hour, and actually think I will try a shorter time next time, as the pastry was cracking. It was easy to 'fix' though. the toffee mixture from the fruit kept seeping through during cooking. I also served ginger caramel sauce with the five spice cream and it was perfect. Definitely a keeper!

Not bad. But the crust is hard to work with. Rather have made a really wonderful apple tart or pie with the ginger and same whipped cream. I say use a different crust or use it in a tart pan. Ginger gives the recipes a nice kick though.

Use organic 5-spice....Morton and Bassett brand is premium if you can find it in your stores. There is great variation in flavor and quality. This one is a winner....and I have been using Chinese 5-spice for years from Chinatown. After I discovered Morton and Bassett after having it on a salad at Nora's Asia in Wash DC....I was hooked.

Wonderful. I was worried because I'm not too experienced with pastry and I added only about half the water indicated, but it turned out delicious. Ok, the crust was nasty to work with (I did leave it overnight in the fridge) and the resulting crostata was not pretty but the taste more than made up for the frustration. The five-spice whipping cream was an excellent and worthwhile finish, taking the tart beyond the ordinary. Absolutely can't wait to make this again (and we don't make desserts often!).

Wow! This is an amazing dish. I made two, one according to the recipe and another with Splenda for diabetic guests, both turned out wonderfully. I took the previous reviewers advice -- refrigerated the dough overnight and used plastic wrap in the rolling process. I had no problems with this delicate dough. Is all vegetable shortening hydrogenated oil? The stuff scares me. I'd love to hear alternatives. I plan on making just the filling (with splenda) for a healthy and easy dessert.

this is an ansolutely stellar dessert. the crust is indeed delicate, but also surprisingly amenable to patch-up work: I did kind of a rotten job with the pleating, but right before putting it in the oven I spent a few minutes plugging and smoothing and patching, and it came out beautifully. also, keep an eye on this in the oven - after only 30 minutes in the oven the crust was golden and the fruit was starting to burn.

Very delicious recipe! Will definitely make again!

WOW! This is so amazing. I loved the crust... but used all butter and no shortening. I let it chill for at least an hour and had no trouble rolling it out. I also had no pears, but plenty of apples as we had just returned from an orchard. I used a medley of apples. The whipped cream is wonderful! I had people asking "What is that flavor?" Cannot wait to do again.

This was a fabulous recipe! I substituted one golden delicious apple for the pear. It's such a delicate blend of flavors. The spiced whipped cream is not to be missed! And the cook from Austin was definitely right - the dough is much easier to work with when you roll it out between the sheets of plastic wrap.

Well received! I didn't use the whipped cream topping (no time!), and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I didn't have too much trouble with the crust - I rolled it out on a sheet of parchment, brushed off the excess flour from the parchment, filled it, and slid the whole thing onto a baking sheet. Some of the juices ran, but no mess!

You've read it before--the crust is difficult to work with, but I worked around the edge after it was filled and pinched the bottom edge a bit to make sure there were no cracks. Very good. Pears were not in season, so I used one very large and ripe peach. Excellent combination with the ginger. Served with basic, lightly sweetened whipped cream. Will be making again tonight, with peaches again. I'll try pears in the fall.

This Thanksgiving was the second year I brought this dessert - and everyone raved about it. It is light, elegant and delicious. This year I had better success with the crust by refrigerating it overnight in plastic wrap, then rolling it out between the wrap the next day. No problem this time! This will continue to be a holiday and occasion staple for me.

I made this for the dessert of a dinner I gave for my brother, who happens to be a restaurant critic. Handling the pastry dough was the single most harrowing experience I've had in the kitchen; it fell apart at every turn and I could barely get it to roll out nicely, let alone make a pleasing shape and drape. That said, it was worth the effort in every way. My brother dubbed it one of the best shortcrusts he had ever tasted, and I must agree. Well worth every excruiating minute trying to piece it together. The filling is fabulous also, but this pastry would do well with any number of fruit variations.

It was a very unique blend of fruits and spices. It was not too sweet or too heavy. An excellent end to a scrumptous meal.

This is a great dessert! The crust is NOT easy to work with! I heeded the warning from Susan from Coronado, CA and lined the baking sheet with foil. This made the clean-up a lot easier since the juices did run and burn! And I was very careful when pleating the crust over the filling! I didn't see any holes! I made some substitutions: used 2.5 Golden Delicious apples instead of Granny Smith apples and Anjou pear. I couldn't find the Chinese Five-Star Spice at my local supermakets so I made my own with ground ginger, cloves and cinnamon. It turned out fine. The next time I make this, I'll use whatever fruit I have around! And I'll try it in a tart pan.

I made this dish for a breakfast tea. I followed the recipe exactly. The crust was oh so tender and difficult to work with, but worth the extra care. This dish is attractive and very tasty. I substituded the whipping cream with non fat plain yogurt and it was just fine. Careful, the juices ran and burnt in the oven so you might want to line your baking pan. The perfect desert for 6. guests.

I made this for the restaurant I work in, and everyone who's had it (including myself) was beyond impressed. I changed it a bit by putting the filling in a simple short dough tart shell , but that was the only thing I changed. The head chef couldn't keep his fingers out of the filling long enough for me to bake the tarts! I actually had to hide the leftover filling in a container in the back of the reach-in so no one would eat it when I left. This is a real winner, I'll definitely use it over and over again.

I didn't have any pears, so I used a peach instead. It was still delicious. I also added a can of mixed fruit in light syrup (cherries, pineapples...) and everything was delicious. The only drawback is the dough. It came apart on the baking sheet, and the juices from the fruits came out on the sheet. But in the end, it tasted good, and it looked alright on the dish. Also, the whipping cream has to be used right away, otherwise, it loses its appeal and fluffiness. Do not eat the desert while it's hot, wait a little. Overall, it was very delicious. :)

I made this for a dinner party recently and received rave reviews. Overall, it is fairly easy to make. The free-form design of this pie makes it easier to handle than a regular pie crust. The crust was very flaky and buttery. For the first try, I made the filling 'as is' which was very flavorful. But in the future, you could add cranberries or raspberries. Add the spice to the whip cream - it complements the pie nicely.
