I made the relish to go with a bloody mary marinated flank steak and it was truly outstanding! I used multi color organic grape tomatoes and regular jalepeno pepper. All of the flavors blend really nicely with the steak and were also a nice garnish for the side salad. I'll make this again and again!

Wow--surprisingly good! Used flat iron steak and a fresh jalapeno, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I really enjoyed the cumin rub on the rib eye. However, the salsa is the real star here. I am going to enter this dish the next time there is a salsa contest at work - and I'm betting it will be a winner! It goes with almost anything. Superb!!

I like several of the others, made the relish but didn't actually eat it with the steak! Good recipe just the same.

This was excellent. Made the salsa with steak one day and then had leftovers on grilled bread as a variation on bruchetta the next day. It's a staple now.

My boyfriend and friends enjoyed this more than I did. They would probably give it 4 forks. I added 1/2 an anchovy to the garlic paste. We had chips out and it never made it to the steak.

What a great recipe. The relish is outstanding. I served it with grilled sirloin. Also makes a great salsa for chips. This will become one of my staple recipes.

This is the kind of recipe for which I faithfully search this website each month! It is fabulous, a complex mix of flavors, innovative. I used beef tenderloin steaks, instead of ribeyes as they are lower in fat and more tender. Other than that, the recipe was prepared as directed and it was exquisite and easy enough to do often, special enough for company. I baked a loaf of artisan french bread to go with, putting some extra relish in a ramekin for dipping....a nice addition for a casual meal.

Delicious! The relish was perfect with the steak. Will definitely make again!
