Use this recipe as a jumping off point to make your own shellfish stock for chowders, risotto, seafood pasta, etc. You can use both lobster and shrimp carcasses together. I usually use two carrots, onion, celery, etc. Roast the shellfish carcasses in a pan in a 450 oven for 15-20 mins before adding to the cooked vegetables. A little white wine can also be added at that point if you choose. A little fresh or dried thyme and/or Bay Seasoning can be used. Also,don't forget salt & pepper and some people use two tablespoons of tomato paste, but I never do unless I already have it on hand. This should be all about using staples/what you already have...not going out to purchase. Freeze in amounts that make sense for future dishes. A few "ice cubes" for shrimp pasta - a few cups for a future chowder. Ignore the previous posters.

Easier to make. This stock will be part of every lobster cookout from now on.
