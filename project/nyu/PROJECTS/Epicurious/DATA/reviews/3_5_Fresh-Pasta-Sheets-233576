You need to see a picture to get an idea if you want to make the Fresh Pasta Sheets.

My favorite recipe for pasta dough yet. I've used other recipes with fewer eggs and had a lot of trouble with consistency. Nice flavor.

This is a good recipe; I used whole wheat pasta, and ended up using about 2 cups of flour. I also added herbs de provence for a nice flavor. It is great fresh and dried.

I made this with the 'by hand' method and it was a bit messy. Next time I might try it in the food processor, or maybe try to perfect my technique (a hole developed in the side of the flour mound and the egg poured out). The results were delicious though. I used the pasta to make ravioli out of leftover ribs from the fourth and got to try out my new pasta maker. Make sure to let the dough rest, otherwise you'll have a hard time rolling it out.

The "well" method was a little challenging on the first go round, but the finished product was fantastic. Be sure to keep the pasta covered and dust the dough frequently.

First time making fresh pasta, and without a pasta machine. I found the recipe easy to follow, and it produced tasty results.

Turned out really well. I added some finely chopped fresh sage and used the dough to make ravioli. I do not have a pasta machine and it rolled out beautifully.

Fresh pasta is addictive once you get into the habit of making it. It can take as little as 15 minutes to put together and then half an hour to rest in the fridge, and another 15 minutes to roll out. I make this recipe by hand, and instead of adding water directly, I just keep wetting my hands and kneading it until it's a good consistency-- elastic and smooth, but still a tiny bit sticky. It's very satisfying, and a simple yet impressive thing to make for friends.
