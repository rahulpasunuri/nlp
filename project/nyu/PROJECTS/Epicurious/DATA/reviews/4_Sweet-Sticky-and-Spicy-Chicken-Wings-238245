I added 1 tsp. of chipotle powder and 1/4 tsp. cayenne to the mango chutney glaze. It was delicious. My family requested this recipe for superbowl night. I served it with a jalapeno cheddar cornbread.

Easy, quick and tasty. Cooking time is accurate. (For those who think chicken wings should take less time)

I made these last week and they where wonderful. I did increase the pepper both red and black. I also made rosotto. Just like they said sweet and sassy.

My family didn't like it :( Too much cinnamon. The glaze didn't win them over - I even made homemade mango chutney!!! It got eaten but I won't be making again. Too bad, it was a lot of work. Sigh.

I used ten chicken drumsticks and 1 and 1/2 times the spices. It was delicious and easy. Next time I'll try it with chicken breasts. Me encanto esta receta!

I used chicken thighs instead of wings. The recipe turned out great. My significant other said to add this to his favorites list.

Followed preparations instructions exactly, and they were delicious! Only change we made was mango salsa instead of chutney. Usually bake our wings, on the grill they were awesome!

I try to keep it healthy, but every now and then I give in to my teenage boys. This recipe keeps everybody happy by skipping the tradition deep frying of most wing recipes. I chose to prebake the wings at 400F for 25 minutes prior to glazing and baking again for 15-20 minutes more. I added a little chili-garlic sauce and 1 T of soy to the glaze and my kids devoured them.

These were so so good! I tried the recipe because no marinade was required, and I was out of time. I broiled, which worked brilliantly. Next time I'll toss in more cayenne, it could have had more kick. Fresh garlic instead of powder, and strawberry rhubarb jam instead of chutney, because that's what was in my fridge. These were fabulous!
