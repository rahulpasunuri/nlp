Amazing sauce. Better than most restaurant dishes. I can't believe it was this easy, I plan to make it again soon!

I made this dish for Valentines Day dinner and it was a big hit with my husband. I had never cooked with duck before and it was very easy and unbelievably delicious. I will definitely make this dish again! Goes great with wild rice!

I have NEVER prepared duck before and this recipe was a breeze! I looked up a you tube on scoring duck breast, bought a pound of breast and voile, I was ready. The sauce was finger-licking good. I would prepare it once a week if I could afford it!

This is an awesome recipe as written. As a working chef, I find it necessary to explain some of the steps given. The order of the recipe is correct. The duck breasts need to rest before they are cut into, or their juices will run out. Tent them with foil, as directed and make the pan sauce while they rest (they will continue to cook as they rest, as well.) Using the pan in which the duck was cooked takes full advantage of the fond (the crusty bits on the pan's bottom) to fully flavor the sauce. Merely pouring in a bit of the "drippings" will leave you with a much weaker flavored and potentially greasy sauce. If you haven't tried following the recipe as written, I highly encourage it, you will love it even more!

The sauce is boss! I absolutly loved it! I used a magnificent rioja instead of a port but, it was great! I'm so glad I found this recipe as it will be one of my go-to duck breast recipes for sure! Thanks!

WOW! This was the first recipe I googled, but I looked at 5 more before coming back to this one...and I'm glad I did. I picked this one largely because I had 90% of the ingredients already. Made this for my wife on date night and she "almost licked the plate". Yeah, it's that good. I used a quality port, added a few more cherries and used some of the cherry juice from the can. My "generic" grade A honey worked just fine. I used the more gamey Margret duck breast and didn't follow the times closely enough. Even well done this was incredible. Can't wait to make it again.Paired perfectly with 2009 Jaffurs Upslope Syrah.

This is a fantastic Duck dish. I loved it!!! Great over a parsnip puree or celery root/potato puree.

Good, but not my favorite sauce. I made the sauce first, doubled the amount and added pinch of urfa chili for smokiness, this chili is not hot. Cooking time is right on. I wouldn't hesitate to make again if I had cherries on hand that needed to be used.

I've never cooked duck breasts before so I needed to find a recipe. The reviews were positive for this one so I thought I would give it a try. The results were awesome. Followed the recipe closely except I made the sauce first as some reviewers had suggested. Added some duck drippings at the end instead of butter. Served them with a wild/brown rice mixture and a salad. Can't wait to make it again.

This is absolutely the best duck receipt I have ever eaten--ever!!

Great recipe but order of operations is mixed up! Make the sauce separately...and first so you don't have to worry about the duck getting cold. At the end you can put in a tablespoon of the duck drippings. Also you can cut off 2/3 of the skin, score the remainder and proceed. Lastly substitute currant jelly for the honey. And I used canned sour cherries because they are out of season. A home run recipe!

It is truly excellent & easy. I found the sauce a bit bland and added a tablespoon of red balsamic vinegar and a dash of smoky paprika at the very end. Gave it a very nice bite. We served it with swiss chard briased with onions and the combination was perfect. hubby licked his plate! here is the swiss chard recipe link: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Sauteed-Swiss-Chard-with-Onions-240560?mbid=ipapp

This is phenomenal. Sweet, savory, juicy, delicious. Only nitpick I have is that the shallots were overbearing once the sauce reduced so I'll cut them back a bit next time.

I am huge fan of duck breast recipes and this is by far the best. I skipped the butter for the sauteeing and I used a wok. I also poured the fat off as it cooked so the duck wouldn't be deep fried. The sauce even tastes better if it sits a little while over low heat. Try to get the duck to about 135 - 140 degrees then tent. I substituted red wine for the port and used plain honey too.

I made this recipe for a party of four. Two large duck breasts were plenty. As others have said, the reduction takes about ten minutes. Be wary when tenting the duck in aluminum foil; it will get cold if you do not insulate it enough. It might be a good idea to undercook it a bit and then stick it in the oven at a low temp to keep it warm during the sauce reduction. The port wine/cherry sauce adds a great element to the duck: the sweetness is not overpowering to the extent that the salt disrupts the flavor. Highly recommended.

I made the recipe as is (I usually do that at least the first time before I start "tinkering" with a recipe). Fresh cherries are great in the sauce, so if available use those. As "arlenemae" mentioned, this sauce is great with seared foie gras too. If you have aleppo pepper, add a pinch to the sauce to add another dimension. Aleppo pepper has moderate heat, with a fruitiness and mild, cumin-like undertones. (Available from Penzey's and The Spice House).

Exceptional. I make this dish about once a month because it is so simple and delicious. I substitute cranberries for cherries and inexpensive red wine for port, but otherwise prepare the recipe as written. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sauce takes about twice as long to reduce. Four forks!

Fantastic!!! Quick, simple and amazing! I used preserved cherries picked up at the local farmer's market and a couple teaspoons of their juice... Absolutely fantastic!!!

When I made this recipe I used dried cranberries as cherries were not in season, it turned out great. It was simple, and tasted great. I'll make it again.

We were given several duck breasts from a friend who loves duck hunting - and not quite sure what to do with them, I started scanning epi for a recipe. This one seemed simple and sounded good. My family gave big thumbs-up!!! They loved it. I forgot to buy cherries so I substituted cherry flavored prunes (had on hand) and I also used red wine instead of Port. They all thought they were eating chopped cherries. Other than those two changes I followed the recipe extactly. Very simple, very good, and I will definitely make this again. I served this with a wild rice dish.

I made this recipe and used blackberries instead of cherries. It came out very well. This is definitely one I would make again.

Great recipe. Keep a close eye on the duck as it cooks to avoid overcooking because it finishes more quickly than it appears. As for the sauce, I multipled this recipe by 5 in order to serve 10 people. Adding 5 TBSP of butter however (as suggested for the sauce) was WAY too much and totally ruined the flavor of the sauce. I made a second batch of sauce without butter and combined them, and it was much better. I suggest adding the butter to taste, versus by measurements.

I used dried tart cherries with great results. I cooked the breasts for almost 20 min, very gently over med heat in a grill pan, only turning over for the last 2 min. Crispy and wonderful skin and meat just perfect. I also made sauce before cooking meat, then just added a Tlbs of cooking fat to sauce at last minute before serving, which made a perfect thick sauce. Wild rice on the side.

Was great. Slight modification: added chopped garlic with shallots in the beginning, then a pinch of thyme after adding other ingredients. Also I had no cherries (it being fall) and used dried cranberries instead. My girlfriend really liked it. Took around 10 minutes (not 3!) to reduce the sauce. Also, duck breasts took around 15 minutes to cook in the pan.

This dish was to die for. I've never prepared duck before. This was relatively simple and tasty. The sauce was magnificent. I had this dish as a main course for my anniversary dinner but I don't think I'll wait a whole year to make it again. I'll make it even if it's not a special occasion!

Love the sauce for this recipe! Previously I've used orange-based sauces for cooking duck breast but this sauce blows duck a l'orange out of the water. The sweet sauce definitely compliments the gaminess of the duck, and reminds me of duck preparations at nice restaurants. Probably the only thing I would change would be the cooking method for the duck breast. Searing is fast and easy, but I prefer the softer texture I get from sous-vide. But the sauce is a winner! I've used the same sauce for my first course of seared duck foie gras and it went perfectly with that as well. Definitely a must-recommend.

Excellent. Could not find duck with some skin on so made it with chicken breast, skin on. Turned out to be very good. Loved the Cherries and Port Sauce. Will do it again.

Overall very nice. But it may have been the perfectly cooked fresh duck breast that we bought direct from Liberty Farms here in Sonoma County. The sauce need a lot of time to reduce properly. Begin first with the sauce as it can rest just fine while you cook the duck. Also, I wouldn't use as much shallot. Too much savory tugging at the nice fruit flavors.

Excellent! this recipe was simple and turned out perfect. We followed the recipe exactly as stated, except it took longer than 3 min for the sauce to reduce, more like 6-7 min. We could only find frozen duck breast, but turned out beautiful. Highly recommend, even if not big fan of duck.
