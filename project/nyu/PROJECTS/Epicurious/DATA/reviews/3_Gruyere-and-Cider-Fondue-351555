With the cost of gruyere you want to make sure you can taste the nutiness of the cheese. Some of the flavors overpower the cheese. Easy to make, but nothing special.

All thoroughly enjoyed. Want again soon.

My wife and I both really enjoyed this recipe. We didn't find it overly sweet like the previous reviewer. We substituted an Austrian pear/apple brandy for the Calvados since we didn't have any of the latter on-hand. Definitely agree it paired well with the kielbasa

I followed this recipe to the letter. I found it cloyingly sweet. It contrasted very nicely with the kielbasa; however, with bread it was just ok. I normally can devour a huge amount of fondue on my own (my favorite dish), and this I was ready to stop after a few bites of keilbasa. My husband prefers my other fondue recipes, so I don't think I'll be making this one again. Not bad, definitely a nice change, but not that memorable.

This was a fun recipe. Every body had a great time eating this and the Evening slowed down. This is a real treat for a small grouping and is a conversation topic alone. Poker Guys say thumbs up!
