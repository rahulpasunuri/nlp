Imbecile. You are simply re-warming the already cooked chicken. No chicken would be cooked through in ten minutes.

This is NOT rotisserie chicken. This is baked chicken. Huge difference !

As usual, I cut the chicken off the bones in chunks. I used dried cranberries instead of dried cherries. I also added 1/4 t. of cinnamon. Well, I also added more pine nuts and was generous with the broth. I warmed the sauce and chicken on the stove top. I served with rice. We expected a wow, but got just a very nice and easy dinner at home dish with lots of left-overs for us.
