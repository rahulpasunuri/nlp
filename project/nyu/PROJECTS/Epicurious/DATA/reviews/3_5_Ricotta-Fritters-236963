It's difficult to tell about a recipe with such disparate reviews, but I wanted to make this. I first made the ricotta which turned out beautiful. Made the recipe with the addition of parsley. It was absolutely tasteless. If you make this, at LEAST add garlic, but... I garnished with Marinara and the sauce was all I tasted.

ok- I figured it out... I was trying to make the fritters smaller to accomodate a larger volume for a pot luck. don't do that... and make sure the oil stays hot :) Once I got the frying method down, they turned out great. I doubled the recipe to feed more people and made some additions. I spiked the cheese mixture with about 4 oz of smoked chevre, added a clove of garlic, some crushed red pepper and about 1/4-1/3 cup fresh italian parsley. it's 10:30 and they're almost gone already...

I added Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and used supprasata sausage instead of the genoa salami. I also prefer romano to parmiggiana reggiano cheese so I made that switch. I added 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat leaved parsley to the cheese mixture and let the cheese mixture sit in the refrigerator covered for several hours before making the patties and frying them. YUM!

My mother used to make these---with spinach and without the salami -- for Friday night dinners, when no-meat was the (Catholic) tradition. I tried them w/ the salami and they are wonderful... I tried them again with the spinach, and they are even better! Delicious! Your best pasta sauce (red) is, of course, the finishing touch!

I love these and have made them many times now. Add more salami for a more intense flavor. My guests always ask for the recipe. The fresh ricotta makes a big difference.

I really liked these fritters and thought they had lots of flavor, esp. with the parm in the mixture.I used peppered salami, and that added flavor as well. I served the fritters with a salad and poached eggs for a brunch. yum!

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was very bland.
