I made the ice cream only, to go with another dish (pie). I make ice cream all the time and am always looking for exotic flavor combinations, but no sooner had I added the chili powder than I realized it was a mistake. I regretted it immediately, but it was too late. I tried to save the recipe by adding cloves, but the taste of the chili pepper was just awful. I once ate parmesan ice cream as part of a savory course in Calgary, and this was almost as bad. We wound up throwing it away. I think it would have been fine without the chili powder, though. Can't believe no one else warned me off it. I guess no one else has wanted to try it.

Love the buttermilk flavour -nice textured icecream also. A little surprised to find chilli in the ingredient list. I halved the amount of chilli, which was very adequate.

This makes a lovely ice cream. It was fun to make in my new high end ice cream freezer. The fruit compote is delicious but I found that half the recipe (made with only one 375 ml bottle of expensive sweet wine) was more than enough to serve with the ice cream.
