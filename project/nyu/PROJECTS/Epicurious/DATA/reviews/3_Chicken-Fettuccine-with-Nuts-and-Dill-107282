This was a neat new recipe, a little bit different, some nice flavor combos. Not OMG this is great, but I'll make it again. I used half-and-half and definitely didn't use 2 cups (probably between 1 and 1.5). I don't like my sauces super creamy. I also only used about half the dill and thought it was a bit strong on the dill for my taste.

I made this recipe for dinner last night and we loved it! I used linguine (just because we prefer it to fettucine), used half & half. Agree about caramelizing the onions well (I actually used 1 lg sweet onion and 1 lg leek and sliced them rather than diced.) Also used 'Better than Bouillon' which eliminated the need to open a can of chicken broth. We rated this a "keeper" and will make it again.

My family LOVES this recipe and I have been making it every since it was issued in Bon Appetit. Cayenne pepper gives a nice punch without overpowering it. And, we all thought the nuts were a creative alternative and then after some research, discovered that this is a traditional item to add to cream sauce in a particular part of Italy. Make SURE you roast the nuts! However, the majority of the time I use shrimp instead of chicken and we like that even better! A standard with my family!!

Decent recipe with some kick but lack taste pizazz. I think it looks better than it tastes.

I made this dish on the fly and only had 2% milk and sour cream. It was sufficient however it needed more flavor so I added red pepper flakes. I only used roasted pine nuts. Next time I will add the pasta to the sauce...too much pasta.

This is a very nice and unusual pasta dish. I halved the recipe, swapped out the cream for 2% milk (maybe whole milk next time), and left out the broth since with the reduced portions, 1/4 cup seemed a waste of an entire can of broth. The flavors blend together pretty smoothly, so I'd suggest adding extra dill to give it a little more spark. Very nice with roasted spring asparagus and garlic bread on the side, and I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this w/o chicken and served it alongside bbq NY's. It was very good, i replaced almonds with pine nuts just because i like those better. Carmelize the onions really well I think it takes a bit longer than the recipe says. Great dish, I will make it with chicken next time.

This meal was truely amazing, and easy to prepair. My wife thought I mastered a cooking school degree when I served this with a small salad last evening. We talked about serving this when our dinner group meets again.

I've made this recipe several times. Simple and delicious and good for company. I use only toasted walnuts and skip the almonds. Did anyone find that 3 onions are a bit much?

I thought this dish had almost no flavor, and I dont know why with all these great ingredients. I added some hot chili powder and I still found it boring. Oh well.

This recipe was great and easy to prepare! I didn't change a thing and my husband and I both enjoyed it prepared as per the instructions. I am making it again tonight and will use egg noodles instead of pasta to see how that works with the sauce.

I have made this recipe three times already. it is an excellent dish for company, easy, very tasty and if you substitute 1/2 and 1/2 or milk it is not too bad in the calorie department. It is very filling and a small serving with a tangy green salad is more than enough. i have served it with a red cabbage slaw.

This dish was wonderful, but seemed to need "something extra." I added slivered sweet red peppers and used pasta radiatore that I had on hand instead of fettucchini. It has a very nice flavor. I added a bit of extra chicken broth to stretch the sauce. My husband loved this.
