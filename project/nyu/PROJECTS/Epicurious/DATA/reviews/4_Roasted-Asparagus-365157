Wonderful and easy! I love the addition of the vinegar. I make a similar roast asparagus recipe but add an egg for a fast & healthy breakfast. I added my Roast Asparagus Breakfast Style to my blog, Spoons to Sporks in case anyone's interested

Excellent and simple recipe. Could have this almost every day and never tire of it. And to think all I ever used to do was steam fresh asparagus -- what a waste!

Delicious! I didn't have a block of Parmesan to shave so just used the shredded stuff I had. This was easy and very good.

This combination of the balsamic and the parmesan brings out a nice flavor in the asparagus. This recipe is very simple, but a good go-to for cooking asparagus as a side.

I've been roasting asparagus w olive oil and parmesan for a few years. Love this addition of the balsamic and parmesan after the cooking for a change!

Yummy...did not bother peeling the asparagus as they were thin spears to begin with. Also just left them on the baking sheet to drizzle with the balsamic and Parmesan. Came out perfectly!

Just made this recipe again. Huge success! Asparagus! Raves for Asparagus! It's easy to make. Relatively healthy (just a little olive oil coated on the aparagus). It's put asparagus in our family's rotation of vegetables.

Easy and yum. Took my husband and I about 15 minutes to roast (we made two batches) one very full cookie sheet of asparagus. Followed other reviewers suggestions and sprinkled with parm while roasting. The cheese added a great crunch to the dish. We served it with Amish noodles lightly tossed in pesto. Great light lunch, all that's required is a glass of red wine to make it sublime!

This was a really nice alternative to steamed asparagus. Like other reviewers, I found that the time was a bit long. 14 minutes did it for my fattish stalks.

Terrific & easy recipe. Found this recipe when I didn't want my husband to steam asparagus. I had everything in the house. Simple, easy & delicious.

This is not vegan if you put cheese on it.

Great way to prepare asparagus! Roasting it really keeps the flavor.

This is just so delicious! I've been buying the skinny asparagus at the farm market and roasting it for maybe 7 or 8 minutes. I've never even been that much of an asparagus fan but I cannot stop making this. Fantastic. You should make this. Today.

I agree with an earlier reviewer; 18-20 minutes is far too long. 8 -10 minutes depending upon the diameter of the asparagus. Roast it near the top of the oven for concentrated heat, also, remove it from the cooking pan immediately to avoid overcooking, and if this cooking style (which I have been using for years) is designed to bring out the vegetable's inherent "sweetness", then what is the balsamic for? Grilling, as someone else mentioned, is a similar way to consentrate the inherent robust flavors of the asparagus.

BBQ Asparagus is the best. I use Olive Oil to toss the asparagus into. Sprinkle pepper and All Season. It really tastes great. I saw another idea to keep the asparagus together is to spear the stems together with skewers. Not bad....Everything else would be just complimenting to this....

This is a classic recipe for asparagus that my family has used for years. One variation is to use grated parmesan instead of shaved. Sprinkle the cheese over the asparagus before roasting and you get a nice crispy, golden crust that adds a little extra flavor that works great with or without the balsamic vinegar.

Dito on skipping the balsalmic vinegar...Perfect without, and yes watch that cooling time at this high heat asparagus can burn fast if are too thin.

Here's a tip on aged Balsamic. If it has the Consortium stamp on the label add about ten bucks tothe price. But the following meet consortium standards for aged balsamic without the stamp: Caradini, 250 ml, $18 Cavalli, 500 ml, $33 San Geminiano Estate, 250ml, $53 Pier Luigi Sereni, 250ml, $20 Vecchia Dispensa, 250ml, $19

Depending on the size of your asparagus, I say roast no longer than 8 - 10 minutes at 425. Skip the balsamic and cheese. S&P and EVOO are all the seasoning needed!

I always grill my asparagus on the gas grill and am looking forward to the addition of balsamic and parmesean.

I love roasted asparagus. I dress it with a mixture of browned butter, balsamic vinegar and a little soy sauce. YUM!

I have not tried this recipe; but I will in a few days. However; I have made it (but) with a slight twist. If however this tastes as good as my recipe I'll let everyone know. Till then bon a'petite

I have made this many times with both thick and thin asparagus and found it delightful. To bring out its best, I have found fine old balsamic, 15 to 20 yr old, works best. Its underlying sweetness seems to work much better than young acidic balsamic, which seem better for salads. Also, I found that it is worth the effort to use fresh shaved Parmigiano rather than un-notable grocery store Parmasan. It is also a better presentation. Finally, when in a bit of a rush, I have just first grilled the asparaguys in my panini press for about 5 minutes and dressed as the roasted with great reviews.

This is about the only way I ever cook asparagus. The recipe is best when the stalks are thick. I cook mine at a higher temp, 425 for 8 - 12 minutes, depending on freshness. If you have any flavored sea salts, such as lemon or garlic, that's a nice substitution for regular salt.

So easy and delicious with a few simple ingredients - it's all about the asparagus!

Great - nice and easy. I have used PAM Olive Oil Spray in place of the Olive Oil (less calories for those that need to watch it). I have found that 10-12 minutes is enough time for the thin asparagus. My kids love asparagus served this way.

I LOVE asparagus cooked any and every way! For the same flavour result but quicker and easier, saute in a pan with oil or butter instead of roasting. TIP: serve with crispy bacon and poached eggs for the BEST breakfast!

Very simple, very good. My only critique is that my asparagus cooked much more quickly than the 18-20 minutes suggested by the recipe. I'd say that after 12 minutes, they were done... maybe even overdone... and these were thicker stalks too, so if you have very skinny stalks, be careful.. maybe cook at a lower heat. And, by all means, invest in a nice bottle of aged balsamic. I love Castello D'Este 12 year old Balsamic ... totally worth the cost.

Easy and good, though I think kosher salt would work better than the sea salt.

I like this recipe because the ingredients you add to the asparagus don't take away form the flavor of the main ingredient.. the asparagus! This is great, just simple and delicious!! Shaved Parmesan on top.. perf.

Love love love roasted asparagus! So simple and delicious. To kick it up a little more, try adding some garlic sea salt in place of regular salt. Yum!

I prepared this dish as part of our Easter Sunday dinner, and found it to be a delicious alternative to the traditional (and sometimes boring) steaming method. The roasting does bring out a bit of sweetness in the asparagus, with the balsamic providing a nice foil. One suggestion is to watch the time and temperature. If you have very slender pencil-spears of asparagus they are going to end up over-cooked if you follow the directions -- I suggest lowering the oven temp a bit and checking the spears at 12 to 15 minutes. Enjoy!
