We made this one night where I was trying to feel like I was living in Chicago again and surrounded by good Korean food. This turned out to be amazing. And really a perfect summer side dish. I cut everything a bit small last time; it tasted great, but didn't have as much crunch. I suggest cutting a bit thicker.

I love pickle recipes. These are great for an in between meal or snack especially if you are watching your weight. This is an excellent alternative to chips or other carb snacks. This is also a great side dish for roast turkey or chicken entrees.

Loved it. Very Refreshing. Excellent snack or side dish. I didn't have any ginger on hand but, it still turned out very good.

I made these pickles using cider vinegar. I was intrigued because of the red pepper threads - which I found in an Asian market. Wonderful flavor, this recipe is a keeper.

I can understand this recipe being offered as "Recipe of the Day" if it were a side to a Korean/Asian dish, but on it's own?! Friday through Sunday was a drink - neither worthy of "Recipe of the Day" title. Getting lazy Epicurious.

This made for a light and refreshing treat. Although I found the amount of ginger flavor to be a tad overwhelming, the dish was a hit with others and I will likely make it again. If you are a fan of ginger, this one belongs in your recipe box. If nothing else, the trick of salting the cucumbers and letting them rest before rinsing was a great lesson - it wilts the cucumber slices a bit and seems to prime them to absorb the flavors of the pickling solution. It also produces a pickle with just the right consistency and a touch of salty flavor.
