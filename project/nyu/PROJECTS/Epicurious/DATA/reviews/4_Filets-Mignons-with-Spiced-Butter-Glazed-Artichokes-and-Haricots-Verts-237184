This was so delicious. I used canned artichokes which made the preparation very simple. The herb butter was sensational on the steak and the vegetables. This recipe was a home run.

This one gets 3 forks because I found the spiced butter interesting, but not particularly unusual. The artichokes and haricots verts, however, were a lovely combination and a fine complement to filet. As for the filet, I undercooked them, merely kept them warm in the oven (rather than allowing them to cook in the oven), and found them to be perfectly matched to the vegetables.

Very good recipe. I even used red wine in the sauce because it was what I had. I also roasted brussel sprouts instead of the beans. It was all very good.

I skipped the veggies and just made the steaks as described. I did sub a beef broth reduction for the veal demi-glace, and cooked the steaks in the oven for 22 minutes, aiming for medium rather than medium rare. They were very, very good. Next time, I think I will omit the lemon juice from the butter, and cook the steaks for 19-20 minutes. They were a very juicy medium-well. Well worth the $22 I paid for the steaks.

A fabulous special occasion meal without taking too much time to cook. The steaks were perfect, as the other reviewers have said, and the sauce was excellent. I cheated and used canned artichoke bottoms (quartered) and frozen haricots verts from Trader Joe's, so the vegetables were super easy and very good with that amazing butter.

My husband declared this "deadly!" The filets mignon and the herb butter are amazing; you could substitute any other vegetables and be just happy. (I can imagine mashed potatoes with that fantastic herb butter.) A great special occasion dinner--champagne is a perfect accompaniment.

Browning the filets before baking them gives a very nice grill flavor and baking them keeps them tender and juicy. The spiced butter was a pleasant surprise. The butter seemed like the most time consuming part of the meal which it definitely deserved. After reading the reviews regarding the artichokes and beans, I decided to prepare them different than instructed.

This was one of the best steak dishes that I have ever had. This meal was so good, that while I was eating it - I thought how can I simplify things to make it a regular at our house. The steak nears perfection - the vegetables lack flavor or there just isn't much of a reward for the effort expended. I think most of the work comes with the artichokes....which add little if anything to the success of the dish. I agree that the green beans aren't spectucular - but an okay accompaniant when you consider that they take minimal effort beyond what you'd already do in preparing the steak.

I have to say that after the rave reviews, I was just slightly disappointed in this recipe. The filets were amazing and I loved the sauce. However, the vegetables were sub-par. I enjoy artichokes more on their own without all the fuss, as described in all the comments on the artichoke recipe. The haricots verts just tasted like green beans, even with the spiced butter. When making this again, I'd serve just a salad on the side.

The filet tasted like it was from a very expensive restaurant. The green beans and artichokes were a great complement but the artichokes were too much prep work for the result. Would make the filet again anytime but make an easier accompaniment.

This recipe is comparable to the top-tier steak houses. My wife made this for Valentine's Day and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had (at home or dining out). We plan on making this recipe many times over.

I think I'm in love with the spiced butter from the recipe. Used regular green beans since haricots verts were impossible to find, best green beans EVER. Steak was perfect, I didn't think filet could taste this good.

I made this for a romantic Valentine's Day meal. It was wonderful. The spiced butter really added a new element to an old classic. It was cooked to perfect medium rare after only 10 minutes in the oven. Easy to pull together and highly recommended.
