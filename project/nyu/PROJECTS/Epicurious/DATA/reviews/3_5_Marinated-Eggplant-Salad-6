This is the second time I've made this simple, make ahead salad. It was better the first time though. (Maybe because I used really fresh japanese eggplant? This round the eggplant had been in the fridge a while.) Anyway, I grilled mine, and pounded the basil with the garlic and some salt in a mortar and pestle so that the herb would stay green. I also used a white balsamic vinegar.

This smelled good while preparing but was not at all enjoyable. Threw out 2/3rds. No one like it.

I don't give a recipe '4 forks' very often, but this one deserves it. Wonderful, mellow flavors! My whole family loved this recipe! So nice that it can be made ahead also. Japanese eggplant might not be necessary, but that is what I used. Is that the 'secret'? I don't know, but that is what I will use when I make this, just in case!

I was underwhelmed, I must say. Maybe this has to do with having used plain eggplant instead of Japanese, but all-in-all this wasn't a recipe I would run to repeat. My husband wouldn't even try it - it smelled too strongly of balsamic vinegar for him.

I love eggplant any way at all but this one takes the cake! Everyone I've made it for absolutely loves it. It's become a standard in my house!

Just very simple and delicious. Guests were asking for more.

Super! Fast, easy, and a great way to do grilled veggies w/o making a mess on the grill (that is, w/a marinade before grilling). I've used both kinds of vinegar, and each time added a pinch of sugar to the dressing. Rather than let the whole dish stand for an hour or two before serving, I mixed the dressing 4 hours ahead of time and let that stand to blend the flavors, then tossed the eggplant w/the dressing right when it came off the grill, added salt and pepper, and served right away. Excellent, and I will definitely make again. Tips: be sure to cook the eggplant very well, till creamy inside; a nice addition is to halve Roma tomatoes, then just char them on the grill, and add them to the basil-eggplant mixture.

This recipe is a wonderful addition to an antipasto.
