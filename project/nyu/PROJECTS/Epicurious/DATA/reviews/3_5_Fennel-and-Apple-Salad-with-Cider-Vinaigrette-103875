I made the dressing and used on a salad of apple, fennel, celery and wheat berry. Very happy with results -- excellent to make ahead for the next day's lunch, stayed crunchy and though fully cooked, the wheat berries took on some of the flavor. Went beautifully with a smoked sausage. I think the dressing would work well on arugula or spinach but not plain lettuce.

Very good salad, took it to a 4th of July potluck and made it again for a book club and it was a hit both times. Once I made it with exactly the proportions called for; once I made it with much less arugula so the fennel and apple dominated. I liked the one with less arugula better. I also used only about 1/2 of the dressing amount and it was plenty; more than that would make the salad drippy. The toasted pecans add a lot. Will definitely make it again.

The combination of flavors in this simple salad was unexpectedly delicious. The fennel and the arugula are perfect together, and the dressing is quite good: sweet, but with just enough acidity to save it from being cloying. Perfect for early autumn.

nice recipe, I added some pickled onions and shrimp and it was fantastic. Pickled onions is something we just keep around and is a great way to add onion crunch and a burst of nice sourness to any dish. Just keep the juice from your next bottle of dill pickles, slice up some onions thinly and throw them in. They keep for a long time if not forever. This also works well to preserve peppers (hot or sweet).

Didn't have arugula so I used romaine cut in strips about 1/2" wide. I expected the dressing to be too sweet, but it wasn't, it was perfect. Sliced the apple and fennel by hand, paper thin. Hint: Remove outer layer of fennel before slicing. Great recipe. I'll bet the vinagrette will be good on plain green salads as well.

Great, complex flavors that compliment beautifully! My middle school students made this for our cooking class and it was enjoyed by most. We made a few changes - added carrot ribbons, baby spinach replaced arugula, granola instead of pecans, and white wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar.

Have made this several times with this spring's glut of arugula -- it's very forgiving, and softens the bitter/spiciness some people find with arugula. Have used apples, pears, a combination of both, sometimes the pecans, and sometimes some gorgonzola or goat cheese. All are great combinations with this easy, clean vinaigrette.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner. It was a last minute decision and everyone loved it, including me. Light, yet delicious!

Made this for T-day but didn't get to it. So I stashed the apple- fennel mixture in a ziploc bag with the dressing and held it till the next day. It was STILL delicious!

This vinaigrette was especially delicious and I will make it again. I loved the salad, but my family cannot seem to get into fennel. My husband refers to it as "the cabbage thing." Perhaps if I sliced it paper-thin on the mandoline I could get them to eat it. After making this, I would suggest tossing red and green apple slices in the vinaigrette and then serving them over field greens with a few pecans and some goat cheese.

Suggest cutting apple slices into a julienne - similar to that of the fennel, as the slices were unwieldy to eat! Sliced the apple right into the dressing, which kept the flesh from darkening. I used a red-skinned Honeycrisp apple and added some fennel fronds to the dressing, which made the salad more visually appealing. For Christmas, I'll use the arugula as a base, then top the apple and fennel salad mixture with candied walnuts (several recipes on this site). An ode to simplicity!

nice flavors just added a little accidental twist. I treated apples with lemon juice and it gave a little touch of citrus that was a nice addition to an already good dish.

An excellent light and interesting salad. When I first tasted dressing I didn't think it had enough flavor, however the fennel and apple balance the dressing well.

This was the first time I've had arugula. It's delicious! That and the fennel were so fresh and innexpensive at Seattle's Pike Place Market today, that I had to buy them. The salad turned out excellent. I might add a little more cider next time to up the apple flavor, but the recipe is still very good as written. It was a great accompaniment to sausage and plum tomato pizza.

I found the dressing to be a bit too acidic, although I must admit that I scaled the recipe down and I'm not sure whether that might have been responsible. Using apple juice instead of cider might help, as could substituting a sweeter apple.

Very tasty. Used a bit more apple juice in the vinaigrette for stronger taste and next time might cut the apple slices in half.

Very Light and a big hit. Next time I may go a little lighter on the fennel since it is a little strong in comparision to the other ingredients; but, overall it was delicious. This salad was a perfect appetizer salad for my meal plan: beef medallions in red wine sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, blue cheese bread, and wine. PERFECTO!
