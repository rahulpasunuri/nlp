Ooops...that's *two* half-pound lobsters. (OK, now they're sounding kinda puny to me!) Wouldn't one 1-pound crustacean be easier? Hmmmmm...

Bacon flavor overpowered lobster--agree with 1st reviewer--total waste of lobster. I think even the red pepper would be too strong a flavor. Taters were good though. I was using up "leftover"(can you imagine)lobster. Much better choice is the lobster, corn & potato salad with tarragon which I tried out previously--that was an unusual blend of flavor for me, but seemed "haute cuisine".

I had something similar to this in a local restaurant served with pan seared Hog Snapper on top of the hash. They added a Butter Rum sauce drizzed around the plate. It was WONDERFUL! I intend to try it with this recipe.

This was easy to make and very good tasting. I did leave the bacon fat out of the potatoes

I agree with the first reviewer, this is gross.

Why would anyone waste lobster meat in this fashion????
