Amen, NYC! I kept the potatoes chunky (used very little cooking water and a splash of cream) and added roasted garlic and shallots because they were handy. Added some cojack cheese, topped w/ parm and baked til hot. I've also made this in the past using bacon.

This tastes better than it looks. It sure is easy and fast to make. But if I make it again, I think I would turn the mixed mashed potatoes and ham into a small casserole dish, sprinkle some parm cheese on top and brown it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Then when you serve it, your family won't look so horrified.
