This was so easy and delicious! I made some modifications based on ingredients I had on hand: Instead of endive, I used baby greens. I used lime instead of lemon juice and olive oil instead of corn oil. I added thinly sliced granny smith apples and some barely steamed asparagus. I agree, the sesame seeds are really a great part of the recipe.

i made this using small, local shrimp, which have more flavor, and it was delicious. the shrimp and sesame go together really well.
