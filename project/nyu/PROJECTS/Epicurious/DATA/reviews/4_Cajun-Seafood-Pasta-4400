Since there are just 2 of us in the house (kids are moved out!) I pulled from what I typically keep in the freezer - shrimp, scallops and leftover snow crab (which I de-shelled). Picked up some crawfish, mussels and sausage, followed prior recommendations to forgo the pasta and served with fresh baguette - fantastic!

I was ladling the seafood and broth over the fresh linguine and thinking - "No way. This is totally not going to work". But it did. And it was very, very good. Every ingredient had it place and helped this dish rise above its rather humble looks. I'm not Cajun, so I don't know how authentic it is, and its certainly not an authentic pasta dish, but for a wet coast boy who loves his seafood, it was inspired comfort food. Not high falutin' or impressive, but just good good good nom nom nom I ate too much. +1 on whomever said its expensive. Shellfish ain't cheap these days. It cost me $30 to put together. Not including the wine. I halved the recipe. All the seafood was fresh. Subbed scallops for halibut, used spot and jumbo prawns, equal parts mussels and clams (1 lb ea). Used 4oz white wine and 4oz clam juice, and finished with a bit of creme. Put over fresh pasta - which seemed to like the broth. If I make again, I might forego to the pasta and just serve with a big spoon and a much buttered baguette and white wine.

Made this for dinner last night. It was amazing! Only one change, we replaced the fish with shrimp. Other then that we followed this easy recipe to the tee. We were a bit shocked by the amount of garlic but it was not too much at all. One bit of advice dont forget a good loaf of hearty bread&..wish we would have had some to assist with the yummy broth.

This was a good mid-week meal, lots of flavor. I too used scallops instead of halibut and added a touch of cream at the end

Good mix of flavors! I used scallops in place of halibut. My only complaints are that the sauce is thin, and that the timings are off for cooking the seafood. The clams should be added first, then the mussels later.

This was really good. Everyone really enjoyed it. I added a bit of cream and cornstarch at the end just to thicken up the sauce a bit but that was just personal preference.

Very easy and very good. As mentioned below, I substituted 2 cans of clams for the clams + clam juice. I also substituted cod for halibut and ditched the mussels. I added crab meat as well.

We didn't add the halibut. My husband is a huge seafood pasta fan and he loved it even more the next day.

This is a fantastic dish! Definitely try the scallops with it - makes it even easier and their sweetness adds to the flavors. I have also made it with hot italian sausage and it works fine. An impressive but very easy dish for a dinner party. I do everything ahead of time except add the seafood

Made this as directed. Skipped the mussels. Very good. I will make this again.

This is SUCH an easy, delicious dish! My partner does not eat dairy or pork, so I actually substituted lamb sausage (couldn't find any turkey, which would have been my first choice). I was concerned the flavours wouldn't work, but it was spectacular. I also added the white wine, as per other reviewers, and instaed of cream I added coconut cream. And I dumped in some capers. Used cod instead of halibut (a quarter of the price!). And I served it over wild rice. Truly unbelievable! My partner, who is a gourmet cook in his own right, was raving about it all night! This one's going in the "favourites" file, for sure.

My extended family loves this dish- over either pasta or rice. I usually leave out the halibut and just increase everything else accordingly. I also add just a bit of half and half at the end to thicken the sauce.

wow. so good. left out the halibut and was very generous with the mussels. unbelievably flavorful. will def. be making this again!

Ok, my faux pas. I cut the recipe in two, cooked the clams and mussels and then slipped them in to the oven Cooked the rest of the dish and served without the mussels and clams which I found in the oven when I was cleaning up and put the sautee pan in the oven to dry. They made a yummy snack while cleaning up. I can't wait to try the dish as descriped with the clams and mussels in the pasta. Grin opps! It was still an amazing dish without the mussels and clams.

I actually forgot to buy plum tomatoes when making it. I used 1 3/4 cup diced tomatoes which turned out to be more tomatoe sauce than needed. I dont enjoy mussles or clams and we dont have halibut in the town im in. I did follow everything else and I must say it was excellent. The tomatoes sauce may have over powered the clam juice but all in all it was a perferct balance. I compared the flavor of the sauce to Copelands Jambalaya.

Great versatile recipe. I could not get halibut so I planned to use crab like someone else suggested then at the last minute two of my dinner guests cancelled so I ended up making it with just the mussels and scallops (subsitiuted for the shrimp since we were having a shrimp appetizer). Serve with a 2002 Ctra Merlot

Been making this for years! Love it...and so does everyone I've ever served it too. I am a serious home cook and this dish is in my favourite recipe pile. I use a chicken andouille sausage and fry it up separately. I think it tastes better that way. Be careful with the halibut or it will break up into an unrecognizable mess.

Very Flavorful. Tastes better the second day.

I've been making this dish forever. Everyone who's had it loves it. The only thing I do differently is use a turkey based creole sausage and fry it up separately. I like it best that way. Fantastic recipe - one of the best I've had on this site.

EXCELLENT!!! i would use rice instead of pasta. omit the mushrooms and use fresh garlic and shallots. add a little cream to thickend up.

I made this dish for my boyfriend's birthday. We loved it. I started by frying half an onion in the butter before adding the sausage. I also used 1 can of jalapeno flavored stewed tomatoes for more juice and flavor. Instead of pasta, I toasted french bread with olive oil and served it on the side for dipping, so it was more like a stew than a pasta dish.

I liked this dish but was not as impressed as others. I thought it was good but not spectacular. I mean you can't really go wrong with these ingredients but I thought the flavor was just okay.

I added 1/2 cup dry white wine while cooking and served it with a mixture of spinach and egg linguini. Everyone raved.

I made this recipe without the shellfish to cut costs and still loved it. Instead I bought canned whole clams and used their juice rather than buying it separately. It was quite simple and fool-proof. I almost always use recipes from Epicurious but this is one of my favorites. It required few obscure ingredients yet still produced a more exotic flavor than many pasta dinners.

Lovely! After reading the reviews and the recipe I anticipated a little too watery sauce that wouldn't stick to the pasta. So I dusted the fish pieces (which included some tiny scallops, fish, and shrimp) in flour spiked with the cajun spice (I used paul Prudhomme's fish spice found everywhere) and fried them quickly and hotly in olive oil with a little butter (very cajun). Kept them warm then dumped them in when the recipe called for them. I also added some crab meat (to help 'thicken' the sauce. The combo of the light flour and crab created an amazing experience. As a note, we reheated the next day and it was absolutely divine!

sounds great - have not made it yet, but here in cajun country, we have very little access to clams & mussels....the rest of it sounds cajun enough!! love this site!!

Wow! I agree with the other reviewers, I think this is one of the best recipes, if not the best recipe I have ever gotten off Epicurious (and I've gotten quite a few!). One word of warning, it's not cheap. But the taste is absolutely amazing. I added some fish stock in addition to the clam juice. I also used canned plum tomatoes and poured in a little of the liquid and it was great. Also used scallops in place of hallibut. A truly amazing dish. And looks very impressive, too!

THIS RECIPE WAS INCREDIBLY EASY TO MAKE AND A DELIGHT TO EAT! I WOULD SUBSTITUTE CRAB IN PLACE OF THE HALIBUT ALSO I USED ANGEL HAIR PASTA. OTHER THAN THAT IT'S A WINNER.

Great dish! I would ajust a few things next time, I felt that it didn't have enough sauce for the amount of seafood. Also, I though the sauce was a little thin,it didn't cling to the pasta enough. Next time I would add 2 bottles of clam juice,and in the end, thicken with a little cornstarch, or a little blonde roux. All in all though, very inpressive.

My husband made this dish for me and it blew my socks off! We use the Bon Appetit recipes a lot and I think this is the best recipe we've tried yet. So tasty - just the right amount of spice and seafood flavour.

I served this delicious dish for a party of 12. Everyone raved about it. I substituted the halibut with fresh sea scallops, and added them a minute or two prior to the shrimp. Will definitely make again.

This recipe caught my eye because so many other people loved it. It is fantastic. I will make it over and over. I substituted catfish for the halibut, and it was excellent. Be sure to serve bread with this - you will want to soak up some of the sauce!

i used swordfish instead of halibut. it was great. next time, i might use a little less seafood.

Wonderful! Used 1+ tbsp of Zatarain's Creole Seasoning in place of the 2 tbsp of Cajun spices - it was a little salty so next time I am going to mix up one of Emeril's multi cajun spices and use that instead of Zatarain's. Also used a good bread for mopping up the sauce - it is so delicious! This is a real party dish and is great for a group of 6 hungry friends!

My husband repeated over and over again that this was definitely a "keeper" recipe. He is still raving about it. We cut the Cajun spice in half to accomodate our tastes. This is a dish I would serve for very special occassions and enjoy any time.

Great Seafood Pasta Dish... added some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper for a spicier flavor. Dont't have to break up garlic head into cloves, just cut top off of the garlic head, pour some olive oil on top and roast covered in foil, let cool, peel off foil away from cut head and squeeze out garlic. No need to peel!!

This recipe was excellent! I got raves at my dinner party. The only changes I made was adding a few more cloves of garlic and eliminating the mussels (not a favorite of ours). We also added some hot sauce (since it wasn't quite hot enough), but it was great. Note: this recipe has a fair amount of prep work, but the cooking time is very short. I will definitely make this again.

Wow! It is a great recipe. We used the leftover seafood to make po'boys the next day.

Quality of ingredients is the key to maximizing this recipe. We took the extra effort to peel the fresh tomatoes. My husband picked the largest garlic cloves he could find so we may have exceeded the intended quantity however he roasted them to perfection (why do so many over-roast them) so there was no excessive garlic flavor. There were no ittlenecks at the fish monger's and we substituted cockles. This dish looks marvelous when served and we have filed at away on disk to serve to guests at our next dinner party. We heartily recommend, maybe even four forks worth.
