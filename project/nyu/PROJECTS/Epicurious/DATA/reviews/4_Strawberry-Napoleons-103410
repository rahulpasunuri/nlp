First of all when i saw this recipe i mistook them for cookies( it's realy more of a dessert, if that makes sense.) This would have been ok but for the fact that i was planning on putting them in stockings.The first 4 cookies came off the pan. but the next batch had to be soaked in the tub. It was impossible to get them off any other way.I think the key is LOTS of grease.These did taste great, however i don't think i will make them again.

This is a great recipe! Great texture and flavour. I love this in the spring and summer when you can get fresh strawberries. The finished product is a great batch of cookies!!

TO DIE FOR!!!! I used on a teaspoon. Makes a pretty big cookies. I used a non stick cookie sheet and had not problem taking them off with a spatula. Wored perfect!! On the whip cream for a different spin, add some grand marnier. Kick it up a litte. Good thing I made the whole recipe, because I couldn't stop eating those cookies!! This is definitely a keeper!

Very good. The mix of texture and the freshness and brightness of the strawberries make this really tasty. Anyone who likes this should consider a twist on it that I tried. Instead of whipped cream, try 1 part cream cheese, sweetened with sugar and lightened with 2 parts whipped cream. Instead of frozen strawberries, try frozen mixed berries, like blueberries, blackberries, & raspberries, whatever mix is at your local store.

This is an AMAZING recipe and has become our strawberry-season favorite. The cookies may take a little practice, but well worth the time. I also did not add any sugar to the whipped cream as the strawberry sauce provides plenty of sweetness. Your guests will be delighted with the beauty of the recipe. A side note, the cookies can be formed into little bowls by draping them over an inverted custard cup and allowed to cool. We fill them with small scoops of mango sorbet, raspberry sorbet and pineapple-coconut ice cream. Dust with toasted coconut and fresh tropical fruits. You won't regret it!

I made this for our family and we loved it! I will definitely make this when we have company because it is so good but also because it looks great on the plates. It was all easy to make - including the cookies. I thought the sauce was going to be so sweet that I wouldn't be able to use it but I drizzled a small amount of it over the berries and whipped cream - by the way - don't sweeten the whipped cream!
