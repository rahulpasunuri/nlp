Exceptional dish!! Made it for a dinner party and everyone raved. I used a bone-in standing rib roast, turned out to be around 14 pounds. It was a little over done but no one complained. the gravy is delicious, cut up the fresh mushrooms and soak the shiitakes ahead of time. Served it with Crusty Potato Cake ( from this website) and asparagus.

First attempt at making prime rib, and the guest were oozing with compliments. The gravy was absolutely wonderful. Added crushed peppercorns to the rub per one reviewers suggestion, and subbed a splash of good port for the sherry. This will be on the Christmas menu from here on out!

Great dish and very easy. The gravy was excellent. I might use a little more rosemary next time in the rub.

Excellent way to cook the prime rib, even if you omit the gravy. A favorite holiday meal at our house.

This recipe is from the first Gourmet magazine I ever bought... I made it for Christmas that year and still make it at least once a year for special ocassions. There's a bit of last minute work, but if you plan and prep (mise en place!)it all before hand, it all falls together beautifully.

This recipe has become a staple at Christmas time replacing the traditional turkey. We look forward to this recipe and all enjoy it, even the kids! The roast is cooked to perfection and the gravy is out of this world. Make extra to enjoy the left-overs (if any!).

I found the recipe very heart worming on a cool autum evening for a family gathering. Invite a neighbor that you haven't said so much as a hello to and you might just make a new friend.

This was certainly delicious, pricey, but marvelous. I added some brandy to the mushroom sauce in the roasting pan. I skipped the arrowroot. I added a couple tablespoons of heavy cream to the mushroom sauce at the end.

This came out unbelievable! Everyone loved it! This was the first time I had ever cooked a prime rib. I ended up getting a boneless piece that was 6 ½ lbs. You could cut it with a fork. I also used hen of the forest mushrooms instead of dried ones that the receipt called for. I would definitely make this again.

We used a five rib roast and it was outstanding! We did change the recipe slightly by adding crushed peppercorns to the butter mixture on the outside for a spicer crust, and using Madeira wine instead of sherry. Our mushrooms were shiitake and portabellas. Everyone loved it! One self professed "prime rib specialist" said it was the best he had ever had. I'd have to agree, it was super tender, perfectly done but I think it was the mushroom sauce that sets it apart from other recipes. We will definately make this again!

We tried this meal at the fire station. It was so tender we cut the meat with our forks. We added crushed peppercorns to the butter mix to give it a better crust.

I served this to my family and we enjoyed it very much. I made some alterations to enhance the taste of the gravy. I used the soaking water from the shitake mushrooms combined with the beef broth,in equal parts, to total the added liquids. In addition I added some portabella mushrooms, white mushrooms, and a tsp. of dried thyme.

The sauce is the key to this dish...it is excellent. I used a 2-rib roast, which was plenty for a quiet dinner for two, but followed the shiitake pan gravy recipe completely. It was very flavorful. However, even after reducing the cooking time of the roast, the texture was just OK. I would like to try this sauce with a more tender cut of beef, maybe a tenderloin.

Yummy! Absolutely delicious if you love mushrooms. Especially shiitake mushrooms. It takes some time but it well worth it.
