A nice change to the salads full of "stuff". A simple salad with tasty herbs (and I disagree with the comment that there was too much herbs!) and the phyllo/goat cheese made it so fancy looking. I suck at following directions but this was easy to follow and make. A keeper.

I didn't like the recipe. The rich flavors of the roasted garlic didn't quite come through and competed with the basil. The taste was a bit bland and I would add a pinch of salt and pepper. This was my first time using Phyllo, and the directions were somewhat difficult to follow, however, now I've gotten over my Phyllo fears.

This was a great appetizer. I forgot the fresh basil, though, and it would have helped. I will make it again. The breadcrumbs are a good idea.

So incredibly delicious and easy to make!

This recipe was wonderful. Make sure goat cheese is soft. That will make spreading it over the phyllo easier.

IF YOU LIKE GOATCHEESE, TRY IT WITH PHYLLO. THE BREADCRUMBS ADD SUCH GREAT TEXTURE. BUT THE RECIPE SHOULD READ "WITH BABY GREENS AND LOTS-O-HERBS" i MIGHT CUT DOWN BY AT LEAST A 1/4 THE AMOUNT OF HERBS. GREAT OVERALL DISH. SHOULD PUT THIS ON MY OWN MENU!!!!!
