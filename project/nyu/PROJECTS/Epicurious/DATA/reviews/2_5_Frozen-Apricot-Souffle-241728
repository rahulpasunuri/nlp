This was fairly easy for the inexperienced cook like me; however, it lacks a certain something.... next time I will perhaps add a dash of cognac or another flavor along with the vanilla and almond, and will prepare a raspberry sauce to spoon over it as both a presentation and a flavor boost.

This was a very easy souffle, light and fresh. I would make it again.
