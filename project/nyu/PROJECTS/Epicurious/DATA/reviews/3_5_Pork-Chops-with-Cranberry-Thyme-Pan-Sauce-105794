A quick dinner as long as you have cranberry sauce. I didn't but made some since I like having it around (see my recipe on my blog Grabbing the Gusto). This will easily double if you want leftovers for another night. Aromas of autumn in the house!

We LUV this---summer so I grilled the chops and made the sauce on the stove but alas, no brown bits. Somehow I thought a minced jalepeno would add a kick---it works! Enjoyed over couscous.

I was hesitant to try this after the two previous bad reviews but my husband and I really liked this. I used a bottled cranberry/orange sauce. I added shallots to the pan after I removed the chops and once soft, deglazed with the wine. I doubled the amount of wine and cranberry sauce and reduced until nice and thick. Very tasty!

This was so easy that I felt like I was doing something wrong. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or an easy sunday night. The flavors are well blended and the recipe is very easy to double.

Simple, fast, tasty - what more could you want? I used caramelized onion in place of the green, and dried thyme, but the rest of the recipe was the same. Served with long grain and wild rice, and a green salad. Definitely goes in my weeknight "go to" box.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used thick, boneless chops and tripled the sauce and we still would've eaten more.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago, and my husband is still raving about it. I doubled the sauce, too, and it turned out perfect.

This was so easy and so delicious. I doubled the cranberry sauce (as other reviews had suggested) and added a bit more wine. Looking forward to making this over the holidays.

I had thin chops and I over cooked them, but that was not the fault of the recipe! Sauce was very good, I used shallots as others suggested and used a bit more wine and cranberry sauce for extra sauce. the sauce tasted great next day on a turkey and cream cheese sandwich too! rounded out the dinner with mashed sweet potatoes and a salad of spinach, dried cranberries, blue cheese and walnuts. all looked beautiful on the plate, and flavors really complimented each other. super quick and easy, very little clean-up, which is a big plus as we have an infant.

First time making pork chops and I picked a great recipe! I too doubled the cranberries- half canned jelly sauce and half with the whole cranberries. Everyone loved it! I served it over cous cous with a side of asparagus and a fresh salad. Yumm!

Good dish tastewise, great on presentation. Love the color with the cranberry sauce and green onions. I made this recipe exactly as written. Makes a beautiful plate, but I feel there are better tasting pork chop recipes out there. I made it with the cranberry with pinot noir and crystallized ginger recipe from here, and it was a fine pairing.

Not really bad, just not good. I would not make it again.

This recipe was amazing!! I love the fruit taste with the pork. It's fun just to play around with the recipe. I added extra thyme, just for fun. I served it with rosmary and thyme roasted potatoes with a glass of chardonnay. My husband loves it! Will do again! -new chef in st. Louis

Double cranberry sauce, substitute shallot for the green onion- flavor will be more refined. Fresh thyme is essential- this was a delicious dish we will make again. Very quick and simple, too.

I haven't made this recipe for quite a while, as I see my first review is over a year old. I made it last night and TWICE during dinner my husband said it was the best pork chop he had ever eaten, and my teen son agreed! :D :D

Based on previous reviews I used shallots instead of green onions, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I think the dish was good but I wouldn't call it fabulous -- I do agree with Chicago that it did lack some "umph". I will make this again but will double the amount of whole cranberry sauce and allow it to simmer longer to become thicker and the flavors more developed.

Big taste, little effort-my kind of recipe. I used center cut loin chops, and used shallots instead of the onions. I used a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and fresh lemon-thyme. Great results! It shall be worked into the regular rotation.

My husband has asked me to make this over and over again since I first made it. One of the best dishes I've tried in a long time. Yum! Yum!

Very good! Takes longer with bone-in pork chops, and a little more greasy. I used about 1/2 cup of chardonnay and 1/2 cup of cranberries, and two small shallots instead of green onions. Almost forgot the thyme, which would have been a bummer because it adds a great flavor. It's a keeper! Served it with Butternut Squash Gratin with Rosemary Breadcrumbs.

This was very easy to make and met with thumbs up by family. Wondering what adding bacon might do to the recipe - maybe next time.

I thought this was awful! The thyme and green onions were overpowering with the cranberry sauce. I would not feed this to my dog!!

This is the best pork chop recipe I've ever tried. Very easy to make, and the sauce complements the pork without overpowering it. I used 1 tsp of dried thyme; I'm sure it would be even better with fresh.

This was quite good. My family enjoyed it so it gets three forks. If it was just me I'd give it two.. It reminded me of a sweet and sour pork that I had in a Chinese restaurant years ago.

wow wow wow!! My family absolutely loved this dish - and they NEVER eat cranberry sauce! I didn't tell them it was cranberries until after they gobbled it up! I made 3 pork chops,and added a little olive oil to the butter, and increased the wine and whole cranberry sauce to 1/2 cup each. I also used shallots. A real keeper.

This was easy and quick to make. I had leftover freshly made cranberry suace, I used porkchops with the bone in, and dried thyme. I also used some chardonnay, instead a dry wine. It turned out very good, and would make it again in a heartbeat.

I thought this sauce was really nice with pork. Though I did not use pork chops, instead I used pork medallions and ligthtly floured them,panned fried till a golden brown served over rice. It was a hit at the resturaunt...

This was a great way to prepare pork chops. The sauce was delicious. I used shallots since I didn't have any green onions and it worked fine.

Excellent! Easy & tastes great. I had to modify it a little bit because I didnt have the exact ingredients. I used Arbor Mist Peach Chardonnay instead of the dry white wine, and I used chopped red onions instead of the green onions. It came out great. We will definitely have this again.

This recipe was fast, easy, and terrific. I doubled the cranberry sauce and added some dried cranberries as well. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes which went well with the sauce. I'm making it again this week for company.

Although very easy to make, we didn't find it outstanding. We thought it was a little bland. Nothing spectacular.

Possibly the best thing I've ever made. I used 1/2C chicken stock with a couple Tbs of apple cider vinegar instead of the wine and used about 3/4C of canned cranberry. I let it reduce until it coated the spatula. Served it with potato pancakes, which gave it a really nice savory counterpoint.

Excellent, gourmet..so simple and quick to prepare. A "keeper"...elegant enough for a dinner party. Will be on my "to impress" list! Followed the recipe to the letter...Thank you!

I made this for breaded chicken breasts. I deglazed the pan with water, a bit of chicken stock and white wine. Then tossed in enough fresh cranberries for two servings. Cooked them down a bit and added thyme, balsamic vinegar and a few tablespoons of sugar. I let it reduce and get a syrupy consistency. My husband loved it and it was super-easy to make.

This recipe was outstanding!! I made it with Cinnamon Brown Sugar Mashed Sweet potatoes and wilted spinach greens. My husband said it was one of the best dishes he has ever had!! Super fast and easy!

A great mid-week recipe, as it requires so few ingredients and is ready in a snap. I substituted rosemary for the thyme and was very pleased with the results. I used canned cranberry sauce as that was what I had on hand, but I will definately experiment with more refined sauces and chutneys. I also added about 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped cranberries, that I think gave the dish more elegance. A great, easy recipe.

This was loved by everyone in the family. Quick and easy. Love it with whole cranberries. Served it with mashed yams and a veggie. Great weeknight recipe.

Great quick and easy dish. I used my own cranberry preserves that includes citrus peel, cointreau and toasted pine nuts, substituted the wine with sherry and red onion slices. It was very flavourful and won't hesitate to make it for dinner guests.

This dish was excellent...I made it for my family one weekend, then again the next for company! They were very impressed. I did however use rosemary rather than thyme, since we prefer that spice. I also used whole berry cranberry sauce & mashed them a bit in the pan (used more than noted for extra flavor) & I added a small thinly sliced onion to cook down with the sauce. Very tasty. Would make it again for anyone...quick & easy too!

I loved this. I was looking for something that wouldnt take too long to cook and this took maybe 25 min tops. I substituted a dry sherry for the wine.

This is a very yummy recipe. We love pork and cranberries, so this is a perfect marriage. I might try the sauce with chicken breasts, too.

We loved it. The meat was tender and the sauce was a great addition. It has been several weeks since I made this dish. Tonight I'm making pork chops again, so I went to find a receipe and remembered how good this one was! This was also good the next day for lunch. All my friends were jealous!

I thought this was a great recipe for those who enjoy sweet and savory dishes. Also, very easy. I diced some shallots and sauteed them in the pan right after the pork, before the wine. I also used a little rosemary. Yum!

Made this last nite. I used shallots and since I was a little short on the cranberry sauce, I added some apricot preserves. I think it helped take out a little of the tartness of cranberries. We really enjoyed the chops and will make them again.

Although I thought that using high-quality cranberry sauce (in my case homemade) would make this recipe shine, it actually ruined the dish. The cranberries turn an unattractive brown color when they cook, and the bright flavors in my delicious cranberry-orange sauce were overwhelming when cooked this way. If I made it again I'd use storebought cranberry and shallots instead of the green onions.

Rating: 3
We loved this -- used bone-in chops and they were fine. As well, we were lucky to have some Murchie's (tea merchants in Vancouver, BC, Canada) Cranberry Preserves left-over from Christmas, and it worked very well. A great and quick dish, and one that I will add to the post-Thanksgiving collection (in Canada, Thanksgiving is in October, so we have cranberries for months!)

Rating: 1
This looked so good I made it before Thanksgiving. I always keep homemade cranberry sauce on hand. But, even with the good sauce this was not very good. I think the problem is the green onion is not very good with the cranberry sauce. I may try it again with shallots or the carmelized onion the previous reviewer mentioned.

Rating: 2
Fast, easy, and tasty, though clearly the better your cranberry sauce to start with, the better your final dish. I used 1 chopped carmelized onion in place of the scallions since I didn't have any on hand, and added the juice of half a lemon to round out the flavors at the end. Very good, overall.

Rating: 3
Very good. The chops I used were thick so I browned them and baked them in the oven in the same skillet. The sauce was very flavorful and went well with the potato pancake I made as a side dish. I rounded it out with a spinach salad that had a few dried cranberries tossed in. I will definitely make the sauce again--it would also be good on chicken.

I'm not normally a big cranberry fan but, combined with thyme and white wine, this dish was a big flavorful, aromatic winner with just the right amount of sweetness.

My husband, who hates cranberries, adored this recipe. It was simple, elegant and tasty. I doubled the recipe (not the onions,though)and served it with baked sweet potatoes with orange chipolte sauce--great easy meal. Will definitely fool that guy again!

This is an extremely easy recipe to make. My husband loved it! I used white cranberry juice in place of the wine. It came out delicious. It did take longer to cook than expected, as the chops I used were a bit thick. I would definitely make this recipe again.

This is a "keeper" recipe - easy, elegant, and delicious. I substituted cranberry chutney for the cranberry sauce,and used smoked pork chops, which cut down the cook time. If you do this for guests, pre-cook the chops, and then cut back the cooking time to about 2-3 mins a side to reheat.
