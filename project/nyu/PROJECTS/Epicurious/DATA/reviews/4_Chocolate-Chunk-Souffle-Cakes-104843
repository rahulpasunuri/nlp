Fabulous. Served as part of a dessert menu for a progressive dinner. Being able to make batter ahead was key. The molten middle gave it an oooh-ahhh from everyone. Adults and kids alike loved it. I tripled the recipe and had major volume issues! Will invest in an industrial size bowl for next time! MMMMM!

This is a tasty souffle. Just decide how you plan to serve it before you make it. If served warm, there is no "chunk" - just a molten chocolate center where the chunk used to be. If served cold (which is also delicious - try it frozen), the chunk resolidifies and there is a large hard clump in the middle of the souffle. If planning to serve cold, it is best to break the chunk into littler pieces.

Delicious, and fairly easy to make. I think they could have been baked a minute or two longer, but still very good.

Served this at a dinner party for 8 - everybody loved it and I often get asked to make it again.

I made half the recipe, and I kept forgetting that as I added ingredients.Nevertheless, it came out delish - despite all my subconscious attempts at sabotage. I used Scharfenberger 62% chocolate; next time I would go to 70%.

Delicious souffle-like dessert and I appreciate the fact that it can be prepared 1 day ahead of time. Very helpful when hosting a dinner party. Great results using Pound Plus Bittersweet Chocolate bar from Trader Joe's. Thoroughly enjoyed the "molten-like" chocolate lava produced by the inserted chunk of chocolate, in contrast to the slightly crisp outer crust. The optimal bake time using convection was 11 minutes. Next time would like to find a way to incorporate orange zest, and Grand Marnier. Simply served with a dusting of confectioners sugar, fresh raspberries, and a sprig of fresh mint following a hearty corned beef and cabbage St. Patrick's dinner.

I have been looking for the ultimate chocolate dessert recipe for chocoholics like myself and this is it! Thank you epicurious.

Incredibly delicious! Even though I accidentally let my sugar/water boil beyond the temperature specified so much so that it would not integrate well into the egg whites, it still came out beautifully and tasted wonderful! Yes, this is a dish beyond compare!

This was incredibly easy to make and delicious beyond compare. My guests were groaning. I served it with vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries. I used a stand mixer and did find that I had to decrease the amount of time to beat the egg whites after the addition of the sugar syrup to approx 1 min. 45 seconds. Other than that timing follow the directions as written and you should have a great result.

This was a wonderful recipe! Sometimes chocolate souffles are too 'cake-like' for me instead of being creamy and chocolatey. This one was just perfect. It had a beautiful creamy texture, and it was incredibly chocolatey. And being able to prepare it in advance was a huge bonus.

Divine! I made this last night for Valentine's Day and my hubby was swooning. This was my first attempt at any type of souffle so I was a bit anxious. I made two larger ones for sharing(instead of the eight individual servings) and they puffed up beautifully -- and didn't fall! A word of caution though -- don't worry if the chocolate and egg mixture seizes up (like mind did) -- it all comes out beautifully in the end!

This is by far the easiest dessert recipe I have ever made and it can be made up the night before!!! I placed it in the oven as I cleared dinner plates and set up for coffee, it was ready!!! I served with a snip of mint on top and vanilla bean icecream on the side. We were all in heaven!!!!

I made this recipe for my husband and sister-in-law both of whom are chocaholics and grew up with a mother who has mastered the art of the chocolate souffle'. I finally won the accolades I had been searching for. This recipe is not only easy, but fabulous..plus you can prepare it in advance.

This is a great recipe for a small dinner party. I made the "souffles" up in advance and put them on a cookie sheet in the refrigerator, popping them in the oven when we were about done with the main course. By the time I got the table cleared and brought out the dessert and coffee service, they were done. My guests were awed.
