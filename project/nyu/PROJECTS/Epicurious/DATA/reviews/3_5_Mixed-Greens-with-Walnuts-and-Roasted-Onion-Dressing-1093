The dressing tastes wonderful, but it's very brown. Makes it a bit unappetizing to look at when all tossed together.

VERY well received. Only regret is that I didn't double the amount of caramalized onion as it is what "makes" the dressing and extras were needed for garnishing the top of each salad for crunch. They shrink up to nothing in the oven. Used small organic vidalias with hazelnut oil on them and honey, let me tell you, it was divine. Toasted the walnuts but as per my usual, I burnt the first batch not paying attention, so I had to do toast a second pan. Why must nuts be so delicate when toasting? I must have burnt an acre of nuts in my life. Welll, better a nut burner than a nut buster I guess. Anyway do make this, you won't regret it.

I liked this recipe, but I thought that the dressing was not quite as interesting as I had thought it would be. I disagree with the people who said that the dressing was too thick. I served mine with some Gorgonzola cheese, and I think it worked well.

This had a great contrast in flavors - the only thing I would do differently is make the dressing right before serving the salad. When the dressing was made, there were lovely crunchy bits of onion floating in it - but by the time we ate the salad (several hours later) the bits had been soaking in the dressing and weren't crunchy anymore. Other than that, this was a great winter salad and would probably be a great accompaniment to a rich meat entree.

Very good, flavorful dressing. Added only 3/4 cup of walnut oil at the end which may have been the reason that the dressing was a little goopey. Or maybe I didn't blend it enough. Will try again and follow recipe exactly.

I substituted toasted almonds for the walnuts, and the salad (aspecially the dressing) was raved about by all my guests. I was asked for the recipe by quite a few people!

I found this to be very bland. It was also quite bitter.

We loved this! It's a great cold weather salad, but worth repeating any time of the year. The dressing is loaded with robust flavor.
