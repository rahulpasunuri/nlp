Used basmati and 2 tablespoons of Earth Balance butter, but otherwise followed the directions and timing. Delicious...

I have tried for years to catch the rice just before it sticks to the pan!!!! The timing of this rice is perfect! Thanks for the new tips and to no more soaking the pan overnight!

I have used this recipe since it came out and have not been disappointed once. Yes it's just rice but how many times has not-quite-right rice put a damper on a meal you have worked hard on? I do make one change being at almost 6700 feet here and 8200 at the lake. I increase the water to 4 1/4 cups here at the house and to 4 3/4 when we're cooking at the cabin. Otherwise a good solid recipe to have in your recipe box.

first jasmine rice recipe I've made that worked as promised. often times the grain is too sticky, not fluffy enough. this time it was as perfect as my favorite Thai restaurant. Thanks for saving me the money on a rice cooker!!

Four forks, though keep in mind what it is - simple rice. It did come out perfectly. Also kept very well in the fridge, did not dry out as rice often does, which is good when cooking for just a few people.

The best rice in the world is Basmatti. The best way to cook any rice is my mother's: After prepping it if necessary, such as rinsing etc., just put the rice in double the amount of water, bring to a boil on the stove, stirring occasionaly, without a lid. Once it comes to a boil, remove from heat and let stand covered for 15 or more minutes! Voila - perfect every time. This has been tested by at least a dozen friends who will never go back. It saves electricity too. Rices which take 45 minutes to cook, such as brown, or wild, need to simmer on low for 20 minutes, covered, then stir once and remove from heat for the remainder time.

I won't rate this either. There is no reason to waste your money on a rice cooker. If you follow the directions on the box of good old Uncle Ben's Rice, you get a perfect batch of rice and it's never mushy (unless you put too much water and over cooked it). Just follow the measurements EXACTLY for rice and water and you will have perfect rice. Take your money and buy a spaetzle maker instead!!

I have never cooked Thai jasmine rice before as I grey up with Uncle Ben's. Regardless, following this recipe was QUITE delicious and savory. I stir fried some top round steak with some onions, garlic, ginger, peanut oil, dried red pepper flakes, teriyaki sauce, and rice vinegar. This was a great addition to the rice.

I'm not rating this recipe since I haven't made it, but as an aside comment - I've found it very difficult to ruin Jasmine rice. Even by itself, plain, it is much more flavorful and moist than your usual Uncle Ben's.
