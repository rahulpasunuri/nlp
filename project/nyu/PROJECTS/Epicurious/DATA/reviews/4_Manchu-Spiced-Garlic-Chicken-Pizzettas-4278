I loved this recipe, but as my carmelized onions were cooling, they turned into a crispy solid mass. Any ideas?

Followed this recipe exactly and it was incredible. My leftover hating husband actually took the leftovers to his office the next day and raved that it was just as good reheated! I had never used the refrigerated pizza dough in the tube before, but I highly recommend it - tasted homemade!

Excellent! Very good with pre-baked thin crusts. Made for 3 hungry college roommates, and got nothing but compliments. Working with what I had, I substituted the cider vinegar for rice wine, and uppped the amount of swiss. I will definitely make this again.

This pizza is absolutely delicious! I've made it twice for dinners with friends and it gets rave reviews. I prepared the onions and chicken the day before to save time, and I used medium-sized, thin Boboli crusts (prebaked for about 8 minutes for a crisper crust). It's really a wonderful combination of flavors.

I accidentally boght sweet red chili sauce and it didn't have the expected bite to contrast the sweet onions. Worth trying again with hotter sauce.

Yum. We ate at Indigo in December, so when I noticed this recipe I thought it would be good. No disappointment. It was good when warm, but was one of the few pizzas that had a better flavor after it cooled down. Used a boboli - a little too much topping for just one large crust I thought. Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent recipe. Not a slice was leftover. I used a pre-made crust, but plan on making my own for a birthday meal this weekend. I gave the recipe 3 forks instead of 4 becuase of the crust. I'm sure homemade crust will even further enhance this wonderful recipe. Delicious!

This was ridiculously good! Made as written but used two 8inch boboli crusts. Will make again and again.

This pizza topping is amazing! Sweet, spicy, very flavorful and will be making these again for sure. I cut the chili sauce in half since 2 tbsp seemed like a lot and they came out just right in my opinion. The only other chage I made was to omit the provolone and just use mozarella and swiss. The provolone was not missed. It also seemed to take a lot longer than 25 mins to carmelize the onions, closer to an hour.

This is my favorite recipe on epicuroius! I make one large pizza instead of several smaller ones and use a Boboli crust. Perfect!

Truly wonderful. I have made this pizza twice now, and my roommates and boyfriend love it. I make two pizza's out of it, and bake it on stoneware, which makes a huge difference on how the crust comes out. Delicious as leftovers too. I'm planning on making for a gathering tomorrow night. The mixtures of the cheeses are just amazing.

This was terrific. The only pizza dough in the refrigerated case in Canada is a non-yeast version so I did not use that. Instead I went to my Italian Grocery Store and bought his frozen shells, they come 4 to a pack and are abour 6" across. Hubby worried it would not make enough. Ha. Ha. Two were eaten for dinner and the other two at lunch the next day. These are fabulous, and the only thing I did differently other than the dough, was that I don't like Swiss sheese so instead used equal amounts of mozzarella and provelone. And oh, yes, I had the Roma tomatoes all chopped up but discovered they wre both mushy and tasteless so I discarded them and used drained, diced, Muir Glen tomatoes instead.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I made this as one big pizza on a sheet pan, and it is extremely yummy. I followed recipe exactly. Pretty easy to put together, although I got a little impatient while I was waiting for the crust to bake. This was an excellent, yummy dinner - not dry at all. Cut into small square, it would also be excellent for parties. Look really beautiful and colorful and tastes exceptional as well. This will be a regular at our house!

So good and so simple to make! Even without a sauce it's delicious! I made this with grilled Boboli pizza crust and it was amazing! A hit among my dinner guests!

I have made this a bunch of times exactly as the recipe says and it is perfect and yummy. Others I have served this to keep requesting it when i invite them for dinner. To the person that said it was too dry, it was because you cut back on the oil and used chicken breast. It's dryer then thigh meat. It isn't meant to be healthy, but it is still good when you cut back on the fat.

I modified this a little bit to cut back on the fat--a lot less oil and I used chicken breast meat instead. I also used premade frozen pizza dough. I really liked it still, but my husband thought it was "too dry"

Terrific pizza! Followed topping recipe exactly, preparing chicken and onions about 6 hours in advance. Used own dough recipe. Will definitely make again.

I made this for our mom's club meeting last month. It was delicious! What I liked: made the onions, chicken, and shredded cheese a couple of days beforehand; then I assembled and baked the pizza at the party. I also chopped the chicken pretty finely so the pizza would be easier to eat by hand (no big chunks). I made 2 large pizzas (in quarter-sheet pans) and cut them into individual-sized squares. I used home-made dough, and I didn't pre-bake it quite long enough, so they came out a little soggy since the toppings are so heavy and moist.

The mix of the chicken, cheese, and onions is wonderful. It really isn't as much work as I thought it would be. I was really impressed with it.

This is one of my favorite recipies. It's a lot of work so I don't get it (my husband cooks) very often. The sweetness of the onions with the spicy flavors is just fantastic. We think it is best on Boboli as the sweetness of its bread adds something to all the different flavors. A definite keeper.

Had to try because of many good reviews. Thanks! Love the hot-sweet-sour-salty combo. Love the quicker method of carmelizing onions (but hi is too hi on my stove). The so called "hot" chili sauce (Kame) was very wimpy so added red pepper flakes. Also a little too sweet; will use crushed pineapple & juice instead of brown sugar. Agree that chicken needs to be cut smaller; I shredded 3/4C cooked chicken (for large pizza) & stirred into sauteed garlic-hot chili mix. Shredded texture is better to me for some reason.

I was having a make-your-own-pizza party, with homemade crusts (easy to do a day ahead) and toppings of your choice. I cut the chicken part of the filling in half, though I always make a ton of caramalized onion for these parties, so I just used my extra onion. I figured that not too many people would want this. I was wrong. It went in a big way. Not my personal favorite (I still prefer a classic cheese pizza, or caramelized onion, gorgonzola and eggplant), but I have to say that it was a hit, and insanely easy. I'll offer it again. Only change is that I diced the chicken much smaller, and I think that was a good idea as it let it be easier to spread it out.

This is a "best ever" pizza! Have made this several times now, always w/ great results. Favorite (so far) variation is to use a Regular Boboli crust (to hold all the ingrediants), spread w/ bottled garlic alfredo sauce,carmalized onions, raw red pepper slices, cilantro & chicken breast pieces sauteed in cajun spice, paprika & louisianna hot sauce. Top w/ cheeses. (Skip the tomato) My husband took leftovers to work & everyone was asking him about it. Try it, you'll LOVE it!

This is a true gourmet pizza that can be a meal or just an appetizer. I suggest you make the whole recipe even if it is just for a few of you because you will want left overs. Best I have ever tasted.

My boyfriend rated this "the best pizza he's ever tasted". I agree. I use thin-crust Boboli and low-fat versions of the cheeses. Be prepared for almost 45 min. prep time but it's well worth it!
