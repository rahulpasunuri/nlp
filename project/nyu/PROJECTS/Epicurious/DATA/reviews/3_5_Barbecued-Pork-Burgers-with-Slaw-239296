These burgers are moist and delicious, and perfect for an outdoor barbecue with young and old present if you leave out the cayenne pepper. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

One of our favorites....we enjoy this all summer long. The only change we make? Less than 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, as we have a non-spicy person at the table.

Wish I could give 3 1/2. This was really good...the burgers were so tender. The slaw was a bit bland, but went really well with the burgers. A definite keeper.

These were a big hit at my house. We are cutting back on carbs so we just ate them on the plate. What a wonderful combination of flavors.

Made this tonight because I had some ground pork in the freezer. Delicious! My husband who is very picky loved it. The burgers were juicy and the slaw added just the right crispness. Highly recommend!

Ok, this isn't "mindblowing", but its deliciousness to ease ratio is VERY high...got great feedback from the family, and it was easy to throw together after work when i found the recipe in an old wrinkled issue of gourmet in the trunk of my car-- and went directly to the grocery store. Will add this to my repertoire. Just cooked them in a nonstick skillet. To get good browning in nonstick pans, DON'T move the meat. otherwise, don't cook meat in NS pans! (cast iron grill pan would be ideal!)

This is a great mid week meal; casual yet interesting and not horribly time consuming. Get creative with what you put on the burgers. In addition to the slaw, I used blue cheese - yum!

These burgers are delish! I used a vinegar-based cole slaw recipe instead and it was superb.

Very good burgers and easy too. I also used precut coleslaw mix for ease of preparation. The addition of the sauce to the meat mixture makes a very moist and juicy patty. Yum.... will do again.

with a few slight alterations, this was really fantastic. I used pre-cut cole slaw salad mix instead of cutting my own cabbage/carrots, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I chopped a quarter of a vidalia onion and added that to the ground pork. Since we couldn't barbeque, i broiled them in the oven on low for 3.5 minutes on each side. Also served sauteed mushrooms and vidalia onions as an additional topping as well as some sharp cheddar slices. Really really tasty!!

Fabulous! Followed recipe exactly and loved the results. Fat cooks away and it's like a hamburger lite. My husband can't wait to have this meal again. "This is a company meal," he said--meaning with guests!

Very tasty. Watch the BBQ to make sure you don't overcook them.

Quick and easy. Will definitely make again and kick it up a notch or two. Got a thumbs up from all who ate.

This sounded great, but the results were pretty disappointing. The burgers had an very unappealing texture. Ground pork is a great addition to meatballs, but on its own had an odd taste. Here is a much better pork/coleslaw recipe - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/ recipe_views/views/106574

I made this tonight for dinner, along with charcoal roasted sweet potatoes and roasted onions. I drank an IPA with the meal to balance the sweetness of it. The burgers are quick, easy and very good. I will make them again.
