I know this one is simple, but the end results are fantastic. I followed the recipe closely -- only a few tweaks. Was worried about overcooking the lobsters and turning them to rubber, so I blasted them with a shower of cold water after the boiling to arrest the cooking process. I added some additional herbs to the broth right before serving -- basil, rosemary, and whatnot. The broth was exactly what I was looking for -- straightforward, tasted like seafood, and could be drank by the pail. Next time, I will definitely add some saffron and maybe some mussels to intensify the flavor, but you really don't need them.

We had this tonight for an impromptu birthday dinner. We got 3 spiny lobster tails from a very generous friend, and split them in half lengthwise before cooking. I sauteed them quickly with garlic, olive oil and butter, and then added some chopped roma tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes (flavor layering), dry white wine, chopped parsley, and basil, and steamed them in this broth for a few minutes before serving. Beautiful!! The lobster was tender and cooked after about 4 minutes. Recommended with some crusty sourdough, a nice chardonnay, and maybe some salad. And oh yeah, a nice bit of ice cream, caramel sauce, and brownies for a birthday dessert.
