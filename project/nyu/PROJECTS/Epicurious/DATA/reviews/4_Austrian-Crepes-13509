I made these for a bake sale two years ago, and they were a hit! )The first two never come out right it's okay) Using Gnutella as filling is a real time-saver, and it tastes delicious.

A very good basic crepe recipe. I like to add different jams and preserves and sprinkle with confectioners sugar.

Excellent crepe recipe that also works well with low cholesterol egg products. I've made them using unflavored grapeseed oil instead of butter to further reduce cholesterol.
