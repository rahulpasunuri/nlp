Just ok. I thought the fruity sweetness didn't do much for the flavor of the rabbit, and the rabbit was a little tough. The rabbit cacciatore here was much better liked by my family.

My family enjoyed this recipe, but I would use chicken next time. I found the rabbit too strong for my liking, and every time I bit into it, I was thinking chicken woiuld suit the flavor better.

Fantastic recipe! It's become a household standard (albeit often with chicken instead of rabbit) and despite the very distinctive flavors, we never seem to get sick of it.

Firstly, I didn't have rabbit, so I used chicken thighs. I was surprised at how tomato-y it was. I was hoping for a lighter sauce with the flavors of cinnamon and orange. I didn't really care for it, but my family really enjoyed it so I'll make it again for them. I will try using a 14oz can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic instead of the crushed to see if I get more of the flavors I want and less of the tomato.

This rabbit recipe was ok - what I found interesting was the orange zest and cinnamon and how they flavor the tomatoes. It was good but I think rabbit with prunes or rabbit in mustard sauce are better. If you can't find rabbit (or don't want to use it) you can make this with skinned chicken.

This was a wonderful way to serve rabbit. And it is quick and easy compared to some of the other ways I know to serve it. All but one of my guests loved it (he was unenthusiastic about the orange). I substitued additional wine for the water with good results. Note to those who find the idea of eating rabbit repugnant: Rabbit is commonly available in Europe and is a delicious, and notably low fat, meat. If you eat veal, lamb, etc. you should really try to get over your prejudice. Did watching "Chicken Run" make you give up chicken? I rest my case.

This method of cooking rabbit results in a moist, tender meat. I added a little fresh thyme. The sauce would be good with rice too.

WOW a new recipe for rabbit! As a boy I raised rabbits for the meat and hides. We ate the rabbits I could not sell. Yes, red stamps for meat and butter did not go too far in WW 2. Thanks for this excellent method of preparing a wonderful meat.

Sounds delicious. Rabbit is hard to find in our area but my parents raised them for food during WW11. She used to fry them in an egg-flour batter and they were extremely tender and delicious. Everyone had food stamps and not many were for meat. They also grew vegetables and canned them.
