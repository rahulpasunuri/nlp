Made this recipe for my wife Friday morning as she is a huge chocolate lover and I wanted to make something special for her since the kids were away at Grandma's. I made it with a few modifications: used french toast bread as I could not find challah or brioche at my local supermarket and did not make the raspberry sauce since I felt that was too time consuming. Instead topped with fresh raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, powdered sugar and whipped cream. We both LOVED it so much I made it again Saturday morning and we decided I'll make it for the kids (3 & 5) as a special treat when we go to Disneyland.

excellent special sunday morning brunch! I didn't strain the raspberry sauce, and I ended up with way too much. So I'll half it next time.

This recipe is amazing! I entered a raspberry dessert contest with it and won first place. If you've made it before with something other than brioche give it another try... I recommend adding a little extra sugar to the raspberry sauce, but as it says this is to taste. Superb!

This recipe is a keeper! I have made it for all of my out-of-town guests and every one of them raved. Instead of choc chips, I used a little drizzling of Nutella. That put it over the top for some. :) This is my only french toast recipe, I've thrown away all of the rest.

This was a really delicious recipe that me and my sister made for our parents for their anniversary. It was very, very, VERY good and I would very highly recommend it for any special occasion. It is TOTALLY worth making. We ended up with leftover raspberry sauce, which would be great on pund cake, ice cream...

Amazingly, this wasn't too sweet. The raspberry sauce, even with all the sugar, wasn't too sweet - was a bit tart. And I used Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate, so that wasn't very sweet (may use chocolate chips next time). I did not have the right bread on hand so used a hearty wheat. This made at least 5 - not soaked long. I didn't want the middle to be uncooked. The kids loved this. It was VERY filling. And yes, you can use the confectioner's sugar on top, since it is not very sweet overall.

I love to cook but somehow, french toast had never made it into my repertoire. This morning, however, my daughter wanted something with chocolate in it for breakfast and though that's not something I usually endorse, I decided to check Epicurious for inspiration and I came across this recipe. OH MY STARS!!!!! It was phenomenal!!! I didn't have rasperries on hand so I used some good raspberry preserves -- on the side, as I wasn't sure we'd like it. No problem there. The raspberry with the chocolate was perfection! My five year old twins loved it too and have already asked me to make this tomorrow. It's a bit too decadent for an everyday breakfast, but I will look forward to indulging in this again in the future - next time trying the raspberry sauce as well. I never knew french toast was so quick and easy to make -- even this chocolate and raspberry version -- so that was a neat discovery too!

I made this months ago for my teen daughter's sleepover. This is what the girls request EVERY TIME they come over. I now make a simplified version: Regular french toast (just eggs, milk & vanilla) spoon the chopped chocolate between the layers and top with thawed berries, lightly sugared. No need to puree and fuss. It is absolutely delicious!!!

This was just ok for me. The chocolate seemed a bit too bitter for what I was hoping. It has potential though so next time I'll try a sweeter chocolate.

I made this for guests during a blizzard weekend, and it was very well received! I served the french toast and raspberry sauce with Trader Joe's Mediterranean Cheese-Style Yogurt, which was fabulous, and added a nice creamy counterpoint to the tart raspberries and rich chocolate. Got two thumbs up from everyone!

I can't understand why there aren't more reviews of this recipe - it was DIVINE!! I did have to make some changes to the recipe (like using raspberry jam instead of making the sauce) and I used sourdough bread (it would have been even yummier with challah/brioche as the recipe says!). I'd serve this for a dessert (make before guests arrive and keep warm at a low temperature in the oven). I've seen a similar thing at a restaurant and wanted to make some at home - epicurious of course had a recipe!

Easy to make. A quick gourmet dish. I made it this morning for Mother's Day - hero for another day! I substituted white chocolate for the bittersweet and eliminated the sugar and vanilla. Ohhhhhh, my!
