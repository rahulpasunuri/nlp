I thought this recipe was great. I used cranberries and was pleased with the results. I forgot to add the lemon juice, but no one seemed to mind.

My wife (the rice pudding authority) loves this stuff. I'm not crazy about rice pudding, but it tasted pretty good to me, too. I'm not sure about the comment regarding the blandness of the pudding. I think rice pudding is rather bland by design -- though I suppose you could pep it up some with the addition of some other spices (nutmeg, mace, corriander, etc.) a small amount of liqueur or other flavoring. I used equal amounts of dried cranberries and chopped dried apricots and was very pleased with the result.

Very boring...I'd make it again just to see if the dried cherries would make a difference (I used dried cranberries)

Here are a few changes to make the pudding sing. Substitue 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg and fresh ground seed of 1 pod of cardamom for the boring cinnamon. Use arborio rice. When adding vanilla stir in 2 oz of white choclate until melted.

A word of caution - I followed instructions to "simmer until rice is very tender" and mine quickl y went from tender to mush. Watch degree of tenderness carefully. It still tasted just fine!

Sweet and creamy version of rice pudding. Very satisfying.
