Everyon has loved this tart all 3 times that I've made it. This time I frated the almond paste in the food processor which made it much easier to spread in the crust. I patted it down with a plastic bag over my fingers.

Quite good, but not excellent.

It is beautiful, but the texture is more like a candy bar than a tart. I had to make a little additional "crust" mixture to cover sufficiently; roll out the almond paste as another reviewer suggested (much easier). Everyone oo'ed and ah'ed over the presentation, but we all agreed that it was good. It just wasn't great.

This recipe was easy to make, and stunning. And it DOES taste better than it looks. I made it twice last Christmas for my family and even those who aren't chocolate lovers devoured it. They've already asked if I'm making it agaain this year. I have experiemented with crusts and the chocolate wafers taste the best. Also, I accidently left a crust in the oven a little too long and it was slightly charred. Sounds crazy, but we LOVED the somewhat bitter taste this lent the dessert. I'll be "accidentlly" burning the crust from now on.

Took the advise and rolled the almond paste.Good suggestion.I followed the recipe using using wafer cookies and wasn't pleased with the crust. I should have just used OREO wafer crumbs, added the butter, greased the tart pan, chilled for 5 minutes than baked it which is what I do with cheese cake. Did the recipe for a family luncheon. Everyone loved it. Will do it again and get the crust perfect next time. Added to my recipe box.

Pretty good, but not nearly good enough to warrant the epic calorie intake involved.

An excellent tart. I made it for dessert eaters who usually use whipped cream, but this tart needed none. Only change I would make is to roll out the almond paste instead of crumbling.

WONDERFUL!!! Made this for our end of the year aerobics class party - ironic, right! It was a crowd pleaser, looks like it came from a bakery. I love chocolate so I would probably make more ganache or use an 8" tart pan. Will definitely make this again and again!!

Exceptional. Delicious, relatively easy, make-ahead, and a perfect showcase for raspberries in season. Served to 10 people and everybody loved it. The only thing I changed was that I made a little extra of each step since I used a 10" pan.

This is a good dessert but next time I think I will bake the almond paste on top of the choc crust then cool and add ganache. I will also add a layer of whipped cream before adding the berries and almonds.

Excellent, 2nd best dessert I've made so far!! Until my mom dropped it (slippery when on a plate) After I warned her...so too bad but awesome recipe

Used 25 wafers - that was more than 1.25 cups - kept it at 5 T butter, and it was enough crumbs for the pan. Rolled out the almond paste, and that was very easy. This whole recipe was easy, and looked very impressive! More importantly, was delicious. Liked it even better the next day, and bringing it to room temperature definitely makes it taste better.

Thanks for the tip to roll out the almond paste! I can't imagine trying to press little bits into an even layer when it is so easy to roll to a nice even layer and place on top. This was the hit of our New Years Eve event and no one had a clue how absolutely simple it was to put together. Good ingredients put together simply always win!!

Made for Christmas and was great. Used Chambord in place of kirsch and for the almond paste - bought it in a tube package and rolled it out flat to fit the tart. Otherwise the recipe was great and will be a fav.

I made this for Christmas day. My husband LOVED it. It was very easy the only thing hard was find chocolate wafer cookies. However I found them. It was SOOOOO easy to make and my husband LOVES raspberries and chocolate. I loved how it could be put together early in the morning and then I could focus on everything else that I made that day. This was such a big hit I am going to make it again for Valentine's Day.

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone enjoyed it! I didn't have chocolate cookies so I made a chocolate shortbread crust. It worked out great. I grated the almond paste onto the crust and then patted it smooth with wet fingers. Worked perfectly. I highly recommend that step!

This tart tastes as good as it looks! There are, however, problems with the recipe. I agree that more chocolate wafers and more butter is needed for the crust. Also, it is possible to find spreadable almond paste (or marzipan) in cans and in tubes, but I found it more economical to buy blanched almonds and make my own (recipe on epicurious.com)! I recommend rolling the paste between two pieces of cling wrap then placing it in the crust and peeling it away from the plastic. I used Luxardo cherry liqueur and it was fantastic! Good luck...the guests will love it!

I made this for a party, and it was a big hit; wife loved it also. Very pretty. I agree with Jane Booker on the cookie crumbs; the recipe doesn't specify enough. You'll want to watch the crust during early baking to "tamp" it down (don't blow that part off figuring it is optional, as I almost did...) The almond paste is a big pain if you haven't used it before; the wet fingers is a good tip, along with pre-flattening it before placing on the crust.

I made this for a ladies lunch. It was a fantastic presentation. I used Framboise instead of Kirsh. I used one tube of almond paste, should have used two. I also would have put more jam and framboise on top for a thicker coating. It was a hit, the girls loved it.

A few things to know about this recipe. First 1 and 1/4 cup of the chocolate crumbs is not enough. I ended up using about 1 and 3/4 of a cup with about 5 tablespoons of butter melted. The almond paste comes in a tube and when it says to break it up what I think they are really saying is break off pieces and flatten in your fingers then press down to crust. Also as as side note when working with the almond paste it will stick to your fingers. Wet them with cold water and it becomes much easier to work with.
