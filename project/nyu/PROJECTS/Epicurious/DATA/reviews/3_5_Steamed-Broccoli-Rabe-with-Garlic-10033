I am suprised at the good reviews this recipe received. I thought it was awful! The broccoli rabe turned an ugly brown color from the soy sauce. It was too salty. All around nasty--my family wouldn't eat it.

This was so easy, and delicious. I made it as a simple side to a fancy meal, and it was the first thing off my fiances plate. I used pre-minced garlic so I doubled the amount as it is not as strong.

I used broccolini because the grocery store didn't have the rabe and loved how easy and delicious this dish was. Also, I used low-sodium soy sauce -- for some reason my husband thought it tasted like balsamic vinegar -- strange.

I LOVE this recipe but find I need to saute quite a while to cook out the bitterness of the rabe. To make a meal of it I add sliced munshrooms and red bell pepper the last 10 minutes of saute, top w goat or feta cheese and sprinkle w fresh lemon juice, S & P. Yum!

This is the best, most simple way to prepare broccoli rabe. It's fast, delicious and very healthy. I usually use low-sodium soy sauce, and don't add extra salt at the end -- just some fresh ground pepper.

Good recipe, I'd put less soy sauce and maybe a touch of olive oil.

If your a greens lover,this is a great treat! It was the first time I had cooked rabe........but not the last! The fresher the greens the better. This is a Weight Watchers 0 points dish. I served rape on top of swordfish with orange, honey and soy. Rice on the side.
