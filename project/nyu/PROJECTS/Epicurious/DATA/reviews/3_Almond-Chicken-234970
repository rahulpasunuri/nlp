I made this with chicken thighs, and it turned out great! To the other reviewer, perhaps your chicken pieces were too small, rather than the crust too thick? I used chopped, slivered almonds, and they adhered to the chicken perfectly. I did add salt, and didn't find it bland at all. Next time, I'll probably add some paprika for a little pizzazz and color.

This recipe sounded interesting, I like almonds and chicken, but somehow this dish didn't come together. I started with a bag of slivered almonds and 3 whole chicken breasts cut in 1-inch slices. Only 2 eggs (and that was more than enough). With no photo to go on, the slivered almonds seemed too large to make a coating, so I put about 2/3 of them in the processor for a few pulses, which might have been a mistake. Added a bit of garlic powder to the flour. The results were beautiful and the chicken was very moist, but the flavor was very bland. The coating was too thick and we ended up taking it off and just eating the chicken. Cooked the chicken for 45 minutes and still the almonds didn't have a toasted flavor. Probably should have just used the whole slivered almonds. I don't know that would help with the flavor, but the coating might be lighter.
