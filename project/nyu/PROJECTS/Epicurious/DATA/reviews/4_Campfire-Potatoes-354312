I've been doing a recipe similar to this for years, using butter instead of olive oil. Use the new non stick aluminum foil and make the packets flat and thin. The potatoes get crisp on the bottom, but don't stick. I don't chop the herbs, leaving the stems whole and removing them after cooking.

I made these tonight for my husband and son - both picky eaters. They loved them! Both plates were cleaned, which almost never happens. I used vegetable oil, parsley, oregano, S&P, garlic, onion powder and Emeril Essence. I just eyed the amount (ended up with extra) and then closed them up in the foil. I baked them with a steak in the oven at 375 and pulled them out at the same time. The only thing I'd do different is throw them on broil for the last few minutes to crisp better, but we'll be making these again, for sure!

A great recipe. The pieces that were more browned from the grill were better. Mine needed extra salt (maybe I didn't put enough in the water?) but that was no problem. Really easy and nice that the work can be done ahead. I would definitely make it again.

I've also been making a rendition of this for years, minus the rosemary (allergy), and I add chopped baby carrots.

So yummy! Everyone gobbled them up! I used a T. of rosemary and 8 garlic cloves and was not sorry. Can't wait for my next grill!

So easy to take camping I can't believe I didn't think of it before. The lemon rosemary chicken along with this article is worth it too!

Perfect side for a camping trip - easy, make-ahead, and delicious. I used 2 Tbsp. of fresh rosemary and doubled the garlic. We warmed the leftovers in the next morning's fire and they were gobbled up fast.
