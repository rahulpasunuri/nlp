I make this for Thanksgiving and it is fabulous with turkey and very unexpected!

I like spices and so I put more ginger and red hot pepper flakes than the recipe called for, my mistake; unfortunately, they overwhelmed the chutney. Still, i am very satisfied and will be making it again.

I added pineapple and raisins, and it's even better. great tasting recipe.

I made this-twice! It freezes well. I used it on grilled MahiMahi, tuna steaks, and roast pork loin. Fabulous. It took longer to cook down, like 30-40 minutes, but well worth it!

Try this in a sandwich with roast chicken slices and romaine on sourdough bread -- WOW!!!!

This was fantastic! I made as an accompaniment to some curry and we ate nearly all of it. Even better the next day. I wound up making it again the following week.

When my eccentric depression-era grandmother said I could not have any chutney on my sandwich because it was nearly 5 dollars for a tiny bottle (apparently she was saving it for when the pope came by) I said "fine, I'll make you some chutney." This was the recipe I used. Very good! I closer to 5lbs of mangoes, 1/2tsp red pepper flakes, and although I really like spicy food, this was still a little hot. I added an extra cup of brown sugar which mellowed the flavors nicely. Also, I had to simmer this MUCH longer than 15 minutes to get the liquid to thicken and reduce to an acceptable chutney viscosity. Closer to 40 minutes. Quite good...and yes, I had my sandwich.

This was delicious. I used the frozen chunks of mango,and cut them a little smaller (saves a lot of that peeling and pitting time you have with fresh mangoes). I also added quite a bit of freshly grated nutmeg. I didn't "can" this, but I will freeze it since that will work also, according to another reviewer of this recipe.

This chutney is outstanding! I made this last year and the frozen/defrosted stuff is just as good as the freshly made. I canned a few pints of it too and those also worked very well. Cutting the mango away from the pit is a pain, but well worth it!

This is a great chutney recipe...I made this without the green pepper because I didn't have one on hand. Next time I'll probably add it in.

I seem to be in a minority but did not like this at all. I tried it as accompaniment to a curry dish as well as another dish and did not like the flavor combination. I wasn't sure what the problem was: possibly too much ginger or onion, perhaps the quality of mango.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I adjusted the recipe by using mangos, pineapple, and fresh hot peppers. I mixed all the ingredients in more or less the same proportions- you really can't go wrong. Then I canned the chutney. That worked famously!!!!

I thought this recipe was a little too ginger-y at first, but the flavor really mellowed after refrigerated for a few days. I added a jalapeno pepper for an extra kick and served it over grilled pork tenderloin that was glazed with honey and soy sauce. Really good and healthy!

I love mangoes but really didn't know what to do with them other than eat them raw -- this recipe did it for me. Just by grilling some pork loins and topping this chutney made dinner quick and delicious. This recipe was so great that I've decided to learn canning just so to keep this chutney conveniently around!

This was a truly delicious recipe. We like spicy food, so used Madras curry paste (Patak's in a jar, available in Canada). A must for Xmas gifts!

Just a question--could this be put into a sterilized jar and kept for a longer period of time?

Lovely, tasty chutney. If you have a chioce of Curry powders Madras is best. Quite hot, but it suits the taste. I used white wine Vinegar, which works fine.

I made the chutney without the curry and it was excellent, although I think it would still be excellent with the curry. It went very well with grilled vegetables and pork loin.

I am a big fan of mangos and have access to them when in season, so I buy them by the bushel and freeze. I would definitely make this chutney again. It was a big hit with my husband also

Excellent - but instead of (sweet) green pepper, use seeded serrano peppers instead, omitting the pepper flakes. (If you don't like it spicy, you might as well just use grape jelly as a condiment!)

this was good, but a little spicy. probably though because i used ground red pepper instead of flakes, which i didn't have. i served it with curried chicken which it complimented very well. my guests loved it. i'll make it again, but without the pepper.
