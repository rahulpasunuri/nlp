This could be my favorite turkey burger. Do not change a thing. I would not have anticipated that this combination of flavors/ingredients would work - but it does.

Mmmmm.... maybe Im too much of a beef lover. Texture was strange and flavor...we just werent fans of this one. I had to smother it with the spicy mayo to get SOME flavor

One of the best turkey burger recipes. The Chipotle Mayo is a must.

These burgers were excellent and flavorful! The tarragon and scallions add just enough spice to take these from normal burgers to something wonderful, and I used dried tarragon. I'd imagine fresh would be that much better. I was not a fan of the chipotle mayonnaise, however. These are much better off without it.

Wow! A fantastic new burger that was easy to make and the entire family loved! I encourage the use of lettuce, tomato and the chipotle mayo. I will definitely make these again.

As another reviewer said, this is an amazingly good substitute for a good beef burger, the best I've had so far. It's still not quite as good as a really good hamburger, but it's very close. We had to use breadcrumbs as opposed to wheat germ (just because I haven't been able to find any wheat germ) and didn't bother making our own buns. I also cooked this on the stove (about 6 minutes a side over medium/medium-high heat, covered), and on the second attempt added a tablespoon of ground cumin. They came out absolutely delicious, and they make for fantastic leftovers for lunch the next day as well!

Sooooo good! I didn't miss the beef at all... the onions and Worcestershire made this so flavourful. I didn't have fresh tarragon, so I used tarragon mustard in the chipotle sauce so I wouldn't miss the flavour.

Oh my God! This was sooo good, and so good for you, which makes it even better! I ate it without a bun, and it was delicious. So full of flavour... I didn't even miss the beef!
