Ok, I was skeptical. Frozen concentrate??? I was completely skeptical but I needed a sorbet fast and I had the ingredients. Believe it or not this came out really nicely. Refreshingly tart, nice texture, people loved it! 3 people asked for the recipe -and one was a foodie who was horrified by the frozen concentrate!

This is about as good as it sounds--not very. I confess that I didn't want to waste a vanilla bean on this, so I just used vanilla, which probably added to the strange flavor.
