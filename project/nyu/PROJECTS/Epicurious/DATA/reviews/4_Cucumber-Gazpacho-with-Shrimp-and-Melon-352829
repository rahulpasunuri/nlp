I thought this might be a smash for my whole family - I love melon/cucumber soups and fresh herbs and my son is a shrimp lover, my husband likes everything. Sadly, flavorwise it was all the sad side of compromise, no one loved it. I liked it, didn't love it, and the men in the family found it too fruity and too "girly".

Good and refreshing. I tried it with garlic and without, and prefer it with garlic. I prefer without the shrimp though.

This is absolutely amazing. It is so delicious, so full of different flavors and textures. It is a little labor intensive with the chopping, but completely worth it. And it's healthy, too! This is one of my all time favorite recipes, yum, yum, yum. (The garlic can be overpowering, and I am a garlic lover. It tastes good without it, but I would maybe saute it a little before adding if you choose to include it.)

What makes this seasonal? Unless you live in Mexico, Florida, or California, there are no "seasonal" locally grown cucumbers, watermelons, or cantaloupes until June or July. Lots of useful SEASONAL inspiration can be given using asparagus, peas, radishes, scallions, strawberries, ramps, and rhubarb. The things that are abundant and local for for 4/5ths of the US & Canada.

This soup was delicious. I used basil, chives and mint. I put in the garlic even though others advised not to and it was great - maybe the mint helped offset the garlic taste. I used red watermelon and omitted shrimp because I didn't have any. I will definitely make it again.

2.5 forks. This was o.k. but there were some really funky flavors going on. I definitely recommend omitting the garlic. It adds a strange pungency that just doesn't meld well. Something also created a salty taste that was unappealing, yet I seasoned very lightly, definitely less than 3/4 teaspoon. The herbs and melon certainly saved this dish.

Have made it twice, loved it both time! Just because I am not hot on melon I switched them out for white flesh peaches, and it was wonderful!

This was okay, but I wouldn't bother to make it again. This is the first time I've tried a recipe from this site and haven't liked it very much. And we do like cold soups very much. I strongly suspect that the herbs one chooses make a major difference in how this turns out...I had chives and dill in my garden, and it just didn't work that well. I think cilantro would marry much better with the other flavors.

Mheh... it was OK... just OK... won't make it again, even though I didn't hate it... but there are better gazpacho recipes out there, and I'll look for another one.

This is a delicious soup. Those who say something is wrong with the recipe may want to considering ordering in next time...

I'm not usually a fan of cold soups, but this was surprisingly good. This will probably be even better when cucumbers are in season. I'm not sure whether I measured the pepper or just threw some in, but the pepper definitely adds to the taste of the dish. I enjoyed the leftovers much more with a bit of extra. (FYI, I made this with cantaloupe.)

I've made this recipe twice and it was delicious both times. Cool, sweet, a little tangy, and smooth. I'm surprised at the reviews that complain it is bitter--if anything it is sweet. I made it for company and someone asked for the recipe.

absolutely fantastic. i'm kind of melon-ed out right now, so instead of mixing in the melon dice, i accompanied the diced shrimp and cucumber dollop with a dollop of fresh pineapple tomatillo salsa that i made earlier today. the entire dish is stunning, flavorful, seasonal and healthy, not to mention a very inspired way to make use of an overabundance of cucumbers. Really - aside from being melon-ed out, I don't think I could eat another bite of tzaziki!

This was a winner! Next time would double the recipe and serve as the main dish for a hot summer night's meal. Used fresh basil, dill and mint for my herbs, and watermelon instead of cantalope. Really, really good!!

I didn't add the melon because I'm not a big fan of sweet, but this was lovely. Sometimes I substitute sour cream instead, and that gives it a lovely tang. The shrimp is a must. Yum!

Somethign is serioulsly wrong with this recipe. The ingredients all make sense, but the combination was inedibly bitter. I agree with one of the other comments: please do not serve this to your guests!

Earlier comment got deleted or something. Anyway, I really liked this recipe. Cucumber was great-- richer-than-expected taste. Next time I'll definitely use a mix of herbs, this time only used cilantro and it was too bitter when sprinkled on. Also might play with adding a touch of cumin or curry powder for zing. Maybe I'd dust the watermelon with the curry/cumin, because the dish (with dice sprinkled on top) is a combo of different chunks of flavor.

Please don't make this soup! It is horrible! The flavors just don't go together at all. This is the first time I've made something from this site that I couldn't eat.

Cilantro, parsley and mint are doing well in the herb garden this year so that's what went into the soup. Cool and refreshing - this is a summer staple.
