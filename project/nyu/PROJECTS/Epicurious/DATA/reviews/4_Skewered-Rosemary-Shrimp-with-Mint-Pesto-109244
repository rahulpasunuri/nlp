Marinate the shrimp in the pesto, then cook it on the grill. Fabulous flavor! If you are using the rosemary, to prevent it from scorching on the grill, just lay down strips of foil, then place the skewers on, rosemary on, shrimp off. Served with garlic crostini. Best when eaten with a little of each - pesto, shrimp, toast.

I served the pesto with cooked shrimp- delicious and a change from the usual red sauce.

I've used this pesto recipe many times but have actually never made the shrimp! Still, I come back to these pesto ingredients again and again. Makes a unique pasta, AMazing crostini, and is wonderful on any kind of fish or beef (and I'm guessing it would also be great on lamb, goat, etc.) I often add some walnuts or basil, increase the parm and decrease the oil. Overall, the proportions here are superb and work every time.

This is a wonderful way to use up a lot of the mint that runs wild through my garden. The flavors are intense, surprising, exquisite. We served it with brown rice with chopped fresh herbs. I feared it would be too many flavors, but the pesto helped to notch up the rice from a good background food, to an extraordinary dish on its own. We found the shrimp/mint pesto combination were perfectly compatible. The whole dish was a happy and delicious discovery. My 95-year old, Italian mother-in-law ate with us, and she - a grimly tough critic - gushed about it. No small feat. Try this. Follow the recipe. It's exceptional.

Love, love this recipe! Brought the shrimp dish to a dinner on Sunday and it went over well. I used the leftover pesto spread over roasted salmon. Yum.

It wasn't bad... but I just feel that basil pesto tates much better. (coming from someone who loves mint anything)

Everybody loved this when I served this during the holiday weekend. I did make substitutions, at the time, not being able to find enough mint. So, I used 1C of mint and 1C of parsley and instead of pine nuts I used walnuts. I'm telling you it was great...probably the best thing at dinner!!! The rosemary skewers were such a festive touch-I think that was my favorite part, LOL!!!

I thought that the shrimp were okay, but not exceptional. In fact, I have many shrimp recipes that I prefer. The mint pesto was so gross that no one ate it, but it may be because my mint was too potent. Overall, this recipe is not worth a repeat.

Re the pesto..... the secret ingredient of jalapeño is a winner. The only suggestion I'd make is that all the ingredients be at least room temp if not refrigerated prior.

Made this recipe with 4 pounds of large shrimp instead of 2 pounds. Used all of the pesto. It was a smash hit! Will make it again soon. Also trying the pesto on chicken.

It was sooooooo good, shrimp came out perfect! I had ALOT of pesto sauce leftover... I didn't even use 1/4 of it

This recipe is exceptionally good. I was surprised about the mint, but it's just great with the shrimp. I didn't go to the trouble of skewering them onto rosemary branches because I was doubling the batch, but they disappeared in a flash anyway. I prepared them the day before, the hardest part was shelling the shrimp. I'm thinking I'd like to try this recipe with precooked shrimp and just marinate them in the pesto overnight for an even easier production. I'll report on that later.

I love this and was asked for this recipe by multiple people after a recent cocktail party. To me the secret is to cut back on the garlic (use only 1 clove in the pesto), and instead of tossing the shrimp with the pesto (too messy!), use the pesto as a dipping sauce. I eliminated the rosemary skewers, and served the shrimp on a platter with a bowl of the pesto dipping sauce in the center.

Rating: 2
The pesto deserves the highest rating...but all together as a recipe was not good. I love the pesto and I also love shrimp but in my opinion neither did anything for the other. I will try the pesto as a topping for grilled salmon.

This was very good but nothing special. I made the pesto with mint and basil (didn't have enough mint) and it was delicious. The shrimp was very messy but the guests seemed to like it.

Fab! Took the reviewer's advice and tossed the shrimp in the pesto before broiling - yum! Also didn't skewer with rosemary (used as garnish and sprinkled a bit, though). Instead, served with crostini. Suggested to guests they spread some pesto (used the additional) on the crostini and then top with the shrimp. Not a single one left - it was the first appetizer gone at the party.

The presentation of this is great for a cocktail party--always a hit. I don't bother with the skewers when I make it for myself: I love the pesto! I use fresh jalapenos from the garden, so sometimes it ends up spicer than intended, but combined with the mint it's still refreshing. I'm not a fan of mint pestos on pasta, but i love it on the shrimp.

Rating: 2
What a disappointment. This pesto was way overhyped, and frankly, not all that original. With shrimp being such a delicate flavor, the pesto overwhelmed it and became nothing but a delivery vehicle. This would be better as a side on pasta or hearty vegitables rather than a quality shrimp product.

Rating: 3
Very positive comments at my cocktail party, with none left over...something different to do with shrimp, very pretty, great flavor. I liked the rosemary skewers - a lot of trouble but presentation was sensational. I made it 8 hours ahead, refrigerated it, and took it out to get to room temp 2 hours before serving.

Loved, loved, loved the pesto sauce. It's a nice change and didn't really taste like mint but just refreshing. I now use the sauce on grilled chicken breas, bread spreads ect. and YUM

This was amazing. I got giant prawns and it could have been a meal. I didn't use as much jalapeno as recommended, but they were still spicy. Also, woody rosemary sprigs are not easy to come by (or reasonably priced) in the Chicago area in December, so I served them with fancy toothpicks. They vanished as if by magic.

Rating: 4
This was amazingly easy, fast, and delicious (not to mention glamorous). I didn't have time to make the mint pesto, so I just used store-bought (basil) pesto, and it still tasted good. I would eliminate adding any salt to the shrimp because the pesto already has salt.

Everyone LOVED!!! Sauce was a nice change. Prepared for our Halloween party and grilled shrimp in advance, vacumned sealed and defrosted day of party. Didn't individually skewer with rosemary due to volume made, but placed on a bed of garden fresh rosemary and sprinkled some on top. Most complimented appetizer of the evening!

Oh my goodness, was this recipe delicious. The mint pesto was so good, I even put it on a sandwich! I skipped putting the shrimp on to rosemary skewers and just served in a bowl. My guests loved it.

I have made this recipe several times, and each time, it is a major hit. I do add more lemon than what the recipe calls for, but I don't change anything else. The ingredients for the shrimp are really important too. The combination of the flavors between the mint pesto and the shrimp is sensational. Definitely one of my favorite recipes.

Rating: 4
okay I tried grilling the shrimp skewered with rosemary(soaked 30 min. beforehand) and the rosemary looked like it had been through a forest fire. However, the pesto is amazing. So my suggestion is this: take toasted baguette slices and spread the pesto on the baguette.Top with the broiled shrimp and sprinkle with fresh rosemary (or my favorite), fresh parsley. Forget skewering.

This was easy and quick and the taste is perfect. So many compliments and the mint was perfect - I wondered about the combo of all those flavors but it looks and tastes fantastic. Only problem is there are never any leftovers.

Wow -- couldn't get enough of this! I used a bit more lemon juice and a bit less olive oil. I was amazed at how creamy the feta made the pesto, and how much kick the jalapeno chile gave it (I didn't even use the full amount). I had to restrain myself from eating the extra pesto straight from the bowl. I'd grill the shrimp next time -- I have a feeling the texture would be a better match with the pesto.

I was served this recipe at a dinner party last night and it was so impressive that I spent some time today looking for it online. It was fab! Elegant and tasty.

I absolutely loved this. This didn't taste like mint at all, but that could have been due to the fact it's the middle of winter and I only have access to the plastic grocery store packs that are pretty weak. However, it was still fabulous! It's much more mellow than a basil pesto, which I often find overpowering. I served it to company yesterday (sans rosemary skewers), and tonight did it again, but tossed with some angel hair. I think I'm in love.

Made only the pesto - it was an interesting change from the usual basil. The mint didn't come through as strongly as I had expected, and the feta seemed a little overwhelming, though I followed the recipe to the letter (unusual for me!). I will try it again and increase the mint slightly, and either decrease the feta or use one that is less pungent. Will be interested to try it on shrimp!

The pesto is great- I added more lemon and red pepper flakes for a little kick. It would also be good on grilled chicken. Made it twice and I can't make enough to keep up with the demand.

Served this dish twice. Once as a main dish and the other as an appetizer. I grilled the shrimp. The rosemary skewers have a dramatic presentation and interesting flavor - great for cocktail parties. A little messy to eat.

The only way this shrimp is rosemary shrimp is because the rosemary is supposed to be on the skewer with the shrimp. That's odd to me. I skipped the rosemary altogether and made the recipe as is, sans the skewer and rosemary. Tasty but too much garlic.

My guests really enjoyed this appetiser. I marinated the raw shrimp for about two hours. Then I skewered them on the rosemary spears (about 2 -3 shrimp to a skewer) and put them on the grill. The rosemary gave the shrimp a wonderful flavor that went well with the mint pesto. A bit messy eating, but well worth it!!

Marvelous! We grilled the shrimp, 3 to a skewer, on soaked rosemary skewers. The scent of the rosemary on the grill was amazing. Served this as a main course instead of an appetizer. This one is a definite keeper!

Fabulous flavor and really lovely presentation. However I changed the recipe in that I tossed the shrimp in the mint pesto PRIOR to the broiling. This provided a delicious carmellized coating and made the shrimp much more tender. Have made twice to rave reviews.

I am not used to working with shrimp and so was a little uncertain of where to place the rosemary skewer since the tail was also still there. Some of the people who ate the appetizers also seemed puzzled by the skewer. However, everyone loved it. The mint sauce could be used for many things and I plan to make it often.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best dishes I have tasted in awhile. As it turned out I didn't buy enough mint which turned out to be a good thing. I added one of the prepackaged mint containers from the grocer which was about 1/2 a cup. I think 2 cups would overwhelm it with the mint. Instead the other flavors came through.

I tossed the shrimp/pesto over pasta instead of the rosemary skewers to make it more of a meal instead of an appitizer. Only two alterations to the meal: grilled the shrimp instead of broiling and used serrano peppers instead of jalapenos for a little extra kick. Definitely a keeper!

Great!! I make a similar shrimp skewered on Rosemary and grilled -- secret is to soak the rosemary for half an hour or so before skewering shrimp and watch or cook indirect.

To the cook from Seattle: if you broil the shrimp on the rosemary sprigs they will most likely catch fire and taste very bitter and acrid.

I haven't tried this yet, but definitely plan to! I'll be sure to review it. I'm wondering why you wouldn't skewer the shrimp on the rosemary sprigs BEFORE you cook them? I'll try it and let you know. Also, it seems like this would be great on the barbecue. (I have a gas oven with the world's worst broiler!) :(

These shrimp were fabulous with the mint pesto. There is plenty of pesto for another use. I did not skewer them on the Rosemary, but sure is a cute idea. Big hit with dinner guests.EASY.
