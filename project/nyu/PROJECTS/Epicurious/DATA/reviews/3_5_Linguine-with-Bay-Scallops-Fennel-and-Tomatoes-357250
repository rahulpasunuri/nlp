Very delicious. Secret is to make it and let it sit over low heat for five -ten minutes at end to let the flavors soak into the spaghetti.

I thought this was ok. Sorry... I wanted to like it given all the positive reviews on here. But overall I found it bland. The combination of cherry tomatoes, onion and fennel did not impart an impactful flavor, as I was expecting. Nice enough overall but I won't make it again.

I followed the recipe as written and found it delicious, especially for a weeknight meal. The only change I made was to add one clove of chopped garlic along with the onion and fennel. I included the Pernod, which I happened to have in the house, and I found it didn't create too strong a licorice flavor at all. You can definitely omit it, or substitute white wine, in the event you don't have it handy. I did make one small error. Be sure and reserve some of the pasta water, as instructed. You'll probably only need a few tablespoons, but it does help give the mixture a bit more moisture. I omitted it and it was just a tad dryer than I would have liked.

It's almost not fair to say that this is a 4-fork recipe since we changed several things. But I don't think the substitutions/additions would heavily alter the overall outcome. Used white wine instead of pernod and lemon. Shallots instead of onion, plus added garlic. Large scallops instead of bay scallops. Strazzopretti instead of linguine. Excellent dish.

I added a few red pepper flakes, seasoned dish with lemon pepper and used white wine instead of pernod. Husband and teenage son loved it, as did I. next time, I will add sliced garlic.

Great, healthy week night recipe. Make it about once a month and is family favorite. I use whole wheat fettucine and sea scallops from Trader Joe's. A definite keeper.

To be fair, my husband loved this dish. I, however, am the one who writes the reviews and wasn't too impressed. I really enjoy eating scallopd and lingune, but I was not a huge fan of fennel/pernoid. Perhaps I used too much? It wasn't horribe and I will be making it again, for sure.

Cooked as written I found the recipe to be quite bland. It was a flashback to the days when healthy eating meant your food had about as much flavor as a piece of cardboard. The licorice flavor of the Pernod was overwhelming and using the pasta water washed away any flavor that may have come from the olive oil, s&p, or sauted onions. My only mistake was not reading the reviews prior to cooking. The suggestions you all have made are fantastic and I can't wait to try it again with the recommended additions and substitions.

Superb, but no rating b/c I made a bunch of changes.. I fried three slices of chopped bacon and then added the scallops to saute with the bacon and bacon fat. Also, added garlic. a dash of red pepper flakes, tarragon, and lemon zest as others suggested, and used white wine to deglaze pan. Skipped the Pernod. My biggest addition was corn -- about 1/2 cup corn kernels. I've seen other Epi recipes that combine scallops, tomatoes, and corn, so thought it would be a good match. With all these adjustments, this dish was excellent!

Really nice dish that's easy to prepare. I made some small modifications based on previous reviewers. I added garlic, crushed red pepper, and 1/3 cup of white wine (to deglaze the pan the scallops were cooked in). I also used basil instead of parsley. I'm really looking forward to making this again!

I didn't have fennel, so I added green onions in its place. I also added garlic, white wine (I didn't use the pasta water), lemon juice, and used lots of cherry tomatoes. It was healthy, easy, and very good. I look forward to making this again soon.

this recipe was a big hit and super easy to make. I took other reviewer's advice and added 2 garlic cloves and lemon zest to scallops. Will definitely make this again

I found I could really pump up the flavor by adding the following simple things: 2 minced garlic cloves to the onion and fennel mixture; 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest to the scallops while cooking; 1/2 cup dry white wine, couple of dashes of hot pepper sauce and some chopped fresh tarragon to the tomatoes. The pasta water was then not necessary. These small additions made it quite a spectacular dish that got raves from everyone around the table. Will definitely add to my repetoire.

Disappointing. Lacked flavor. I think some garlic could have been added with the onion to help add some taste. But the scallops were very bland.

Good but not great. A good change of place from our usual. i would double the tomatoes. I haven't decided if I liked the lemon. It definitely highlights the flavors. It just seemed a bit sweet. Definitely worth trying. I'll probably try it with small shrimp next time.

Great weeknight recipe. So often the low-fat dishes are flavorless and dull. Used sea scallops and shallots instead as these were on hand. Trader Joe's whole wheat fettucine gave the pasta an nice nutty quality. Would add more tomatoes next time. Don't forget the lemon. Will definitely make again.

Simple & delicious weeknight meal. We added 1/4 cup white wine to make a stronger sauce. We also used fennel seed in place of the Pernod & squeezed half a lemon at the end.

A very light and flavorful dish that even my picky kids loved.

Quite simple and light. Great with low carb or extra fiber pasta. My husband added hot pepper flakes as he does w/everything. Good for trying to cut back on calories.

delicious and quick, with the added bonus of using sustainably farmed seafood! I didn't have Pernod, so added about 1/2 tsp of fennel seed to the onion/fennel mix, and I grated some lemon rind into it at the end. Definitely going into regular rotation.

Yummy and very easy.
