Someone brought me a bag of kumquats and not knowing what to do with them, I found this recipe on epicurious. It was fabulous and I even bought a kumquat tree so that I can make it again and again!

When I chilled the chutney it hardened too much to mix in the extra kumquats and cilantro. Suggestions?

Excellent! I didn't add the extra kumquat at the end and it was still delicious. This is a keeper and I can't wait to try it with company. I've had it on crackers, with french goat cheese, over pan seared chicken and roast pork tenderloin -- all this past weekend!

I don't have crystallized ginger. Can I use fresh ginger and add more sugar?

This is SO good! I want to grab a spoon and eat the whole thing. I did not add the cilantro. I served it with fish and got raves.

To answer the question is you need to peel the kumquats -- No, never peel kumquats -- the rind and the pulp each have a unique flavor, one's sweet, the other's tart; can't remember which is which, but in any recipe always use the whole kumquat.

Finally a way to use all the kumquats from my tree! This is an excellent chutney -- great flavor and so quick and easy to make. Next time will definitely double the recipe. Used golden raisins for the dried cranberries, added some minced shallots and pinch of fresh ginger as another reviewer suggested. Used white wine (misread the recipe) and not wine vinegar -- flavor of the chutney was still great. Served the chutney with mix grill of gourment sausages -- wonderful accompaniment. The chutney would be great served with cheese.

Spectacular! One pint of kumquats made a double recipe. Served with crisp roast duck (this site) to rave reviews.

One of the best chutneys I have done in the last years. I served it with barbacued chicken breasts and instead of the curry I used garamala. Tasted great and all guests had compliments for it.

This chutney is amazing. I've just made it for the third time and my husband is eating it on toast before it cools. I will definitely double next time.

I served this with pork tenderloin that I stuffed with spicy sausage. This chutney was a perfect accompaniment and it garnered raves! I added a finely minced shallot and some fresh ginger to the recipe as well.
