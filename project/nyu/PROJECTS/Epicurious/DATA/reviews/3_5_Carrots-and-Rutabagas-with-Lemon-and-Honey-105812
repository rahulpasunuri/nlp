This was so simple and so interesting. The hardest part is making the "matchsticks". I used 1/2 the butter and added a bit of olive oil. Oh, and I didn't have any chives so I added a bit of garlic. Really delicious, definitely do this when you have fresh carrots and rutabagas!

Loved this though made a few changes. Added beets. Didn't have a lemon so used a lime. Fab! Served with spicy black bean burgers (store bought) and thought it went together very well. Will make it again soon!!

Such a simple but delicious way to deal with rutabaga. I used maple syrup instead of honey, and it worked nicely.

Always looking for a new way to do rutabagas! Very Good. Used lime, would cut back on that amount next time. Will definitely make again.

I made this with just the carrots, that was all I had on hand and it was delicious. Quick, easy and different - none of the cloying sweetness of glazed carrots. Might even try it with rutabagas if there are guests who like them (they're not one of my favs). A recipe that will go into the repertoire.

This has become one of my regular Thanksgiving sides since it was first published. I make it exactly as printed, no changes, and everybody loves it, and most of my family had never had a rutabaga before! Such a light side dish to offset the more elaborate and heavy fare. Perfection!

Our CSA box contained wonderful carrots and rutabagas this week so I tried this recipe, albeit with changes. I made the entire amount of veggies, which I chilled immediately in ice water. While they were cooking and cooling, I assembled the glaze using 1/8 C. olive oil, 1 Tbl butter, less than 1/4 C Meyer lemon juice, 1/2 tsp zest, 2 Tbl honey, dried chives (all mine froze!) and a generous pinch garlic powder. I reduced the glaze, tossed in the veggies, and gave a sprinkling of salt and pepper. So easy. Our guests loved them, too!

I have just made myself a quick lunch with this scrumpious recipe. I used virgin olive oil instead of butter and fresh coriander leaves instead of chives. I put the cooked carrots on a bed of wild rocket and served with a couple of Cornish sardine fillets. Delicious.

This is a surprising twist to good old turnip, and very attractive. Lime rather than lemon was quite fine. It's as though the vegamatic slicer was created for this recipe!

Made this dish for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. The aroma, appearance and last of all, taste, complimented our meal very well. I've been informed by the family, that it is now a regular addition to holiday dinners.

Very tasty change of pace. I am always looking for "different" veggie recipes and this one fits the bill.

Very Tasty! I added sweet potato and it was delicious, I would not change a thing, it was a great comfort food and accompanied Pork.

The lemon made this too puckery for my taste. The presentation was lovely. I would make it again w/ just butter over the veggies.

I substituted zucchini for rutabagas. Do not cook the zucchini as long as the carrots. Looked and tasted great.
