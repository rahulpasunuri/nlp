The glaze was delicious on the bacon. I used the bacon to make BLTs and the extra flavour made the sandwiches amazing!

Sooo easy and adds a twist to plain Cdn. bacon. Brunch party of 8 loved it. I used a tad more maple syrup because I love the flavor of maple. I didn't broil it - just brushed sauce on - worked out fine and was moist.

This had great flavor, and was a nice change from cooking it plain. However, it came out a bit tough, broiling it for a minute less might help.

This a very easy way to prepare Canadian bacon for a brunch. I doubled the recipe and did not boither to turn the bacon. The mustard and maple is a wonderful flavor.

Delicious part of breakfast for a Sunday meal. Enjoyed it, and added a few small pieces to Hash browns.
