Really, frozen waffles? And I am thrilled to see a wine pairing for my Eggos.

I added in a handful of rehydrated mixed exotic mushrooms, fresh portobello, sauteed onions and garlic (could just use shallot) and a bit of fresh lemon juice. Finished it with chives and took it to a Belgian waffle and beer bon voyage party!

mmmm, so good! I was using this recipe to use-up some leftovers, so I made this with turkey instead of chicken, thyme instead of tarragon, and I (sadly) didn't have any Sherry on hand. And it was still incredible. A childhood favorite!

We loved this quick and easy dinner. After reading the reviews, I added mushrooms and peas for flavor and color. Couldn't imagine waffles with the chicken, so I made buttermilk biscuits instead. Split the piping hot biscuits open and served the creamed chicken on top. This would be good with egg noodles too.

Made this tonight using 2% milk instead of cream, 1 tsp. dried tarragon, 2 cups of pre-cooked chicken, and added some minced garlic and chopped onion. My husband thought this was delicious. However, I thought it was a bit too sweet. Next time I would replace about 1/4 of the chicken with mushrooms, and cut the dried tarragon down to a scant 3/4 tsp.

Good, quick middle-of-the-week dinner. Added onion, garlic and a bit more sherry. Used the delicious Kashi "Go Lean" frozen waffles and they were great! KIMBER

Very very easy, and a good way to use leftover turkey. I agree that it "misses" something, so next time I will add some mixed vegetables for color and flavor.

This dish was wonderful!! My husband actually made the dish. It was very simple and quick. There was something missing, though. He added some fresh pressed garlic, onion salt, and basil. It was delightful. We'll definitely make this again.

This dish is very good for a quick supper, especially during the winter months. I added a bit of red pepper to the recipe, just to give the dish some color. I think that you could add a bit of onion, too, but it might compete with the tarragon.I doubled the recipe and it didn't seem to make any difference in the quality. Hope others enjoy it, also!
