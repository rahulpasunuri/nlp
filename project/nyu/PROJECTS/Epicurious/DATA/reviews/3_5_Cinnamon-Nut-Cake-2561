I've finally ended my search for a delicious coffee cake! I didn't have pecan halves, so I substituted chopped walnuts and modified the finish slightly. I reserved approximately one third of the batter, sprinkled the nuts and cinnamon sugar on the two-thirds in pan, then topped with remaining batter and sprinkled more walnuts and cinnamon sugar on top. This made a moist, cinnamon streusel-like ribbon throughout. Next time will probably cut back slightly on amount of sugar in streusel/topping.

It only became a "piece de resistance" when I added a brown sugar, butter, vanilla and pecan topping.. We loved it!

This recipe was very easy to make in a short amount of time. I enjoyed it with peaches and whipped cream.
