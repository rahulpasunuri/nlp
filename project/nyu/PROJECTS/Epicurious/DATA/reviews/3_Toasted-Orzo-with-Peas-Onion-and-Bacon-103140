I thought this was very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added frozen asparagus spears at the same time as the peas. The result was creamy and delicious, and the leftovers were great, too. I'm sure you could add other veggies, including fresh.

We really liked this recipe as a single side dish - starch and veggies. I cooked the bacon separately from the onion and poured out the fat drippings. It could use more onion and peas and a little parmesan would liven it up. Needs a fair amount of salt and pepper.

This was just okay. I might make it again if I hadn't already made better orzo pilafs.

Really enjoyed this one. Tried a bit with blue cheese, but didn't care for it. Parmesaun is perfect. Certainly not time consuming since you are cooking anyway.

I topped this with a little blue cheese..was a nice addition. Didn't have orzo so used salad macaroni (all I had) - wouldn't suggest using that although it worked fine.

I figured since it included bacon, this recipe had to be solid. But it ended up tasting like rice-a-roni, at twice the effort.

I've made this 3 times in the last 2 years, and am about to make it again. You may need more chicken stock, so have some on hand. Also, be sure that you add peas just near the end so they don't get mushy. I found frozen baby peas have a crisper texture then the regular peas.

Pretty nice. I stupidly left the peas sitting on the counter, and forgot to stir them in until everyone had been served. But, it tasted ok without the peas and quite good with them. A fair amount of effort for what you get, but it is definitely something new. Merits the 3 forks.

We loved this dish! I had been looking for a lighter orzo pilaf recipe for a long time, and this one just looked wonderful! I used extremely lean bacon and made the recipe exactly as written. Served it with breaded and baked Chicken Breasts with Feta Cheese Sauce and crusty french bread, and it made a perfect comfort meal! Very quick and easy, and the leftovers heat up perfectly for lunch! Will definitely put this in the side dish rotation. Who needs salty Rice-A-Roni!?

possibly the world's perfect comfort food - I made this with elbows instead of orzo, and omitted the toasting step. Cooked the bacon and onion, drained VERY well, and added pasta and enough stock to cover. Simmered until the pasta was just a little chalky inside, then boiled off the excess stock. Added peas at the last minute - the pasta was perfectly al dente, the peas still bright green and fresh tasting, and all the flavors worked very well together. I will make this one a LOT this winter! Perfect for watching a movie wrapped in a blanket.

Not crazy about this one. It had the essence of bacon grease even though I used center cut lean bacon.

A lot of taste for a minimum of work! I left out the peas, but this was a great side dish. I would just suggest having a decent amount of chicken stock on hand as the orzo absorbs it quickly. I've already been asked for the recipe.

easy and tasty; next time I will try it with pancetta in a bit of oil instead of bacon.

This recipe was very easy to make and was a welcome change instead of rice or potatoes. My husband says "it's a keeper."
