This was very good! I used jarred pickled beets and added chopped walnuts for crunch.

I was looking for a sour cream dressing, which I used on beets and chickpea salad and it was delicious!! I left out the onion because I was too lazy to grate one :-) Perfect creamy, tangy dressing.

This is a great simple salad dressing. I didn't make the beets, I was just looking for a sour cream based salad dressing. I substituted garlic powder for the onions and used balsamic vinigar. Fabulous!

What a lovely salad! I made this salad for my first dinner party in my new house and it was really quite easy to put together. The dressing had a great taste to it and the whole presentation looked great on the plate. I will definately make this again and again.
