This is very close to the classic recipe, and it's really not a recipe but a treatment. One should use mineral water (salt not needed, therefore) and unrefined sugar. I see some good cooks here who instinctively substitued brown sugar or the like. I know French cooks who prefer honey. If your carrots are mature, you may wish to cut them into "allumettes" (matchsticks) instead of slices. There are endless variations: try adding a tablespoon or so of Pernod, Cointreau,or sweet vermouth, or, a slight grating of fresh nutmeg or white peppercorns. Other "fines herbes", dill in particular, are also frequently substituted for the parsley. Bon appetit!

I wanted something quick and uncomplicated that would add color to the plate. Using brown sugar and chicken broth, this was the perfect choice. The meal was Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta and Olives, Smashed Baby Red Potatoes with Ancho Chiles and Dry Jack Cheese, and Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce (all on this site). Elegant and so easy. Much can be done ahead of time and I was away from the guests all of 35 minutes.

Great supporting castmember for the real stars of dinner. Simple, quick, good pedigree. It's a keeper.

Have made this twice and gotten rave reviews. But instead of using regular carrots, i bought true "baby carrots" which are smaller, under developed carrots. They do not need peeling and you can get them at whole foods. I cooked them whole as they make a nice presentation.

I was dissapointed with this recipe. I don't know if my oven is on crack or what, but I couldn't get the carrots to cook quick enough on low. IT was part of a dinner, so I had to crank the heat up to finnish in time. I used baby carrots that I sliced as directed. The flavor was good, but nothing amazing.

I think this is a fantastic recipe and have made it several times. I got it out of the original printed Gourmet, and that page is marked with many spots where it was referred to many times!

Yum--easy and tasty. Might use chicken stock next time instead of water as suggested by a previous reviewer.

Try using chicken broth or stock instead of water. It gives the dish a much needed boost of flavor.

I found another recipe for this in a french provincial cookbook. You ad just enough water to cover the carrots, and then salt the water. Cook until ALMOST all the water is absorbed. THEN add the sugar and butter, and over high heta, toss until coated and the rest of the water is gone. Then add fresh or dried dill, just a bit, and fresh parsley if you have it (if you only have dried, leave it out).

I thought this was a very tasty way to bring out the natural sweetness of the carrots, I think next time I would add just a tad more butter. The best thing about this recipe is that it is so simple to make, almost as simple as the recipe for 'Salted Boiling Water'.I would make this again, it's a keeper.

I sliced baby carrots lengthwise and cooked them in salted butter, water from a Brita filter and brown sugar. I thought it would turn out like candied carrots, but this is much more delicate. It was a good contrast to the spicier Arugula Vichyssoise I made for the same meal. Maybe a light dash of Ginger would be good in it.

These carrots came out good but nothing to jump up and down about. Like some others, I used brown sugar and that added a nice touch. Next time I would add a little more butter and maybe some salt after draining the carrots.

Even people who hate carrots love these! I use brown sugar and real Vichy water when I can find it - seriously, you should try it.

Excellent...definitely use brown sugar.

I must agree that this is a simple, yet wonderful way to prepare a side dish, but would substitute brown sugar instead of white. Enjoy!

I've cooked carrots this way for years, with one change; use light brown sugar instead. Can also shorten cooking time by cooking in a ceramic or glass covered dish. Microwave 6 min.- cut wat er amount in half, can run under broiler to carmelize.Now, these are great carrots!
