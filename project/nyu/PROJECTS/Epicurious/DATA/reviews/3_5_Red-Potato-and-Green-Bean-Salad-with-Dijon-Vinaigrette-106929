This is my go-to potato salad. Easy, delicious and best of all, no mayonnaise. I use the skinny haricots verts and they are perfect in this dish.

This is my favorite potato salad recipe. I follow the lead of many others and cut the amount of olive oil in half. I also use haricot verts if I can find them. It is always a hit.

A very nice potato/green bean salad! I took the advice of the other reviewers and halved the olive oil. This was the perfect amount. The shallots I bought were quite huge so I used half of one, which came to 2 T. chopped. This was a good amount; more would have been too much. Rather than whisk the dressing, I made it in the Cuisinart, resulting in a very thick, emulsified dressing which coated the potatoes well. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written. The textures and flavors were excellent.

This is one of my favorite potato salad recipes! Flavors are very fresh. Planning on making it for dinner tonight. I also use about 1/2 of the oil.

I made this recipe and the potatoes were swimming in oil, I had to drain it all of just to get most of it out. Still had too much. I'd suggest 1/4 cup of oil and 4 tbls. of white wine vinegar.

This is one of my favorite potato salad recipes. Fresh flavors and not a heavy mayonnaise taste. Yesterday I added sliced green onions and 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro to the mix. Great additions to the recipe. I also use about 1/2 of the oil the recipe calls for.

I made this recipe tonight with good results. I used small little Dutch potatoes, called Krieltjes, and haricot verts for green beans. I did not have vermouth so I subbed white wine. And I made sure right after draining the potatoes and green beans, to immediately pour the dressing over them and toss. It turned out very tasty. My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much. I think this would be a great side dish to serve at a barbeque.

Has anyone tried this recipe with asparagus instead of green beans? If so, what changes, if any, were made to the original recipe? Thanks.

I had some green beans about to go bad and whipped up this simple and delicious recipe. I tossed in thin-sliced red onions at the end instead of the shallots. I also omitted the vermouth (being pregnant) and squeezed the juice of one lemon onto the potatoes instead. I also added a little cayenne pepper for some heat. The key to ultimate flavor is to toss the potatoes with the vinaigrette while they're hot. Also, salt the blanching water well. I saved some time and water by reusing the bean blanching water for the potatoes. Finally, add only enough oil to the vinaigrette to taste. You can always drizzle some more in later.

I have made this recipe a few times and it always comes out great.We had a family gathering in Cape Cod and on a warm summer evening I served it with grilled cornish hens and used some of the mustard vinegarette as a dressing, my company raved! by Wendy

This recipe is perfect just the way it is - you don't have to change a thing. You could skip part of the oil but I have found it tastes way better with all of it. It's not like you eat it every day. I haven't met anyone who dosen't like this potato salad and I make up to 6X for big parties.

an easy summertime favorite. I cut down on the olive oil. Also, I when I make ahead, I don't add the green beans until right before I am going to serve. Delicious left overs!

Wonderful salad! Added a little more Vermouth on the warm potatoes and used white balsamic and cider vinegar as I was out of white wine vin. Used beans, shallots, and parsley from the garden. The dressing is awesome and held very well as I made it the evening proir.

I doubled the green beans, halved the potatoes, and eased up on the oil. It turned out well. I'd make it again.

Delicious - I had more than one recipe request. I doubled the recipe to serve at a bbq with skirt steak and made almost exactly as written. The only changes - half the olive oil (as others suggested; more than enough) and closer to 4.5 lbs of potatoes (wanted a higher green bean ratio).

This one is always a favorite at family feasts. I prefer to let the taters cool completely before dressing. It seems to help the emuslified elements stay together. I also boil the spuds in salted chicken stock which I think adds some depth. A good dijon is also important. cheers

This makes a wonderful mayonnaise-free salad. I made three batches for a party and the bowls were scraped clean.

I love this recipe. Definitely cut the oil in half. The vermouth is too strong for me - not the taste, but the smell and the feeling in the back of my nose when I taste it. I have solved that in the past by rinsing the potatoes, but today I sprinkled a scant teaspoon of sugar over, and it cut it perfectly.

Very good and simple to make. Didn't change a thing.

I cannnot tell you how good this is. And - really simple too! Made it exactly as described - my only modification is that if you don't have SMALL red potatoes, then I wld quarter them, instead of half. Gives more surface for the fabulous "dressing"! My entire family loved it (ages 9 to 53). I'm doing a cold tenderloin for a wine tasting & I think I'm going to make this for a side (I don't want to be cooking, when I can be sipping!) ONE QUESTION: Has anyone made this & then heated it to be served as a side??

This is a nice change from your ordinary potato salad and coleslaw at our last barbeque. I substituted haricot verts for more tender beans.

I was in a rush for a tailgate/picnic and this was the final dish on my list. I'm not sure what I made even qualifies as this recipe but the simplified version (sans shallot and parsley with 'accelerated' cooling and white wine for vermouth) tasted lovely. The simple vinaigrette worked well. A nice addition to a healthy, summer meal.

My very particular mother wanted this recipe from ME! That was a first!

Very nice if you reduce the oil as recommended. Because my pantry was pretty bare, I substituted russet potatoes, which wouldn't be my first choice, and used dill instead of parsley. Added black olives and artichoke hearts instead of beans (because I had them). White wine works well as a vermouth substitute. Nice mustardy, tart dressing without overpowering the vegetables.

Rating: 2
I'm sure I messed this up, so I said yes, I'll try again. I used russet potatoes because that's what was onhand, and the texture came out totally wrong. Even made two batches of them and tried to cook them less the second time, but they were still too mushy. I like the idea of this recipe though, so I'll hang on this for future reference.

This is now one of the new staples in my ecipe box and meal planning for the Summer!! I made it for a dinner party the other night and it was a big hit - so much so that I was asked for the recipe. I made this along with the cold poached salmon and a nice bottle of Sancerre. Thanks!!

one of my faorite ways to make potato salad!

I agree with those who commented that it was a bit bland, thought the flavors were pleasant. If I made it again, I'd cut the oil and increase the vinegar to make it more like a vinaigrette. I boiled some red potatoes tonight for a different purpose and used the vermouth idea and sprinkled some red wine vineger on the hot potatoes immediately after, and they had the kind of zest I'd hoped for from this recipe. All it all, it seems like a pared-down Nicoise, but could definitely use some zing.

I made this salad to go with Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary. I surrounded it with field greens which made the salad look very pretty. I liked the combination of potatoes with the green beans. For a little added color and flavor, I chopped a couple tomatoes and scattered them over the top. I will make this again, as I had 8 people eating this and they all cleaned their plates and asked for seconds.

Good, but not great. Surprisingly not as much flavor as I would have thought. I used red onion in place of shallots, which may have been the reason. But I've made better potato salad with a dressing of Ken's Lite Italian salad dressing.

What a lovely dish! Good for any time of the year. The vermouth on the hot potatoes is heavenly and makes all the difference, so do not skip this step! (Use white wine if you don't have vermouth) The shallot & mustard vinaigrette is fabulous. Highly recommend!

I've made this recipe several times now and always get requests for the recipe. One guest said, "It's the best potato salad I've ever had." The vermouth and the shallots are key ingredients, don't skimp.

I am a Catering Director at a very prestigious college. I introduced this item at last year's Welcome Back Picnic for all Faculty and Staff. Since it has been requested almost non-stop for all types of functions! It's great for outside because of not having mayo and it has a "classy" presentation with the Green Beans and Grain Mustard. A Guaranteed Winner!

Perfect for our 4th of July picnic held outside had a great tasting salad that as special for the holiday. not the same old potato salad and did not have to worry about refrigeration.

Rating: 3
Good basic recipe, good at room temp, not that different from many green bean-potato vinaigrette recipes. One key thing: if you don't have vermouth, use white wine or wine vinegar to sprinkle on the potatoes when hot (though I like the vermouth). This really helps the flavor of the final dish, so don't skip it. If I don't have vermouth, I grate a little lemon peel into the dressing.

Rating: 3
A delicious and fresh tasting dish! I used beans and potatoes from my garden which was even better. I also had to tweak it a bit as I didn't have vermouth on hand, but it was still great. We were eating it straight out of the bowl the next day.

I've made this salad many times before using other recipes, but I like this one the best. Of course, I had to tweak it slightly: I drizzled white wine instead of vermouth over the warm potatoes and I used basil and chives instead of parsley. I think it's yummy, and a great farmers market dish.

A great departure from the usual picnic salads. I didn't have vermouth on hand, but the finished product didn't seem to suffer without it.

I have made this dish several times since it was published in Bon Appetit. My husband doesn't eat potato salad, but he loves this. Definitely cut the oil..I sub roasted garlic olive oil and tarragon vinegar at times. The vermouth is nice but easily omitted. Try this with a mixture of white and blue fingerling potatoes instead of the red. I serve this at room temperature as well, but I think it works really well to make ahead. Mine doesn't seem to separate. I also like to use country dijon or creole mustard. Try sprinkling with feta for an added touch.

this is a delicious salad. only problem is that there was way too much oil in it. i put it in the fridge for a little while before dinner and the oil separated out and had to be spooned out before it was served. i will reduce the amount of oil down to maybe a 1/2 cup next time. but it was very good.

The potatoes didn't absorb any of the flavors of the dressing, perhaps because they had cooled by the time I dressed them. I did add the vermouth while they were warm but didn't notice any vermouth flavor in the potatoes.

This is the best potato salad I have ever come across. I'm sure the dressing added to the warm potatoes is the secret! I omitted the vermouth (didn't have any) and used ordinary white vinegar and a mixture of dijon and seeded mustards and it was just fabulous. My Dad won't eat any other potato salad and neither will I - definately high praise!

This was good but, like other reviewers, I would probably cut back on the oil a bit. I also think you could probably halve the dressing and still have enough to coat the salad. However, the flavors were great and this salad was easy to make. A great summer recipe to go with barbecue.

This dish was pretty yummy when I first made it. But when I served it for a potluck the next day, the tangy mustard and vinegar flavor had leeched away, leaving behind some boring potatoes and green beans. Don't make it a day ahead, unless maybe you add more mustard and vinegar in before serving.

I made this for a picnic with my Euro friends and it was devoured. I recommend using half the olive oil for a lighter dressing. Will definitely make again--it's easy for lazy people like me, the ingredients are inexpensive and you don't have any of the fancy kitchen ware!

Very good potato salad. I agree that letting it sit overnight and then bringing it to room temperature enhances the flavors. My guests seemed to love it, and the leftovers were great too. We even nuked the leftovers a bit in the microwave, which worked just fine.To me, it's better when at room temperature or slightly warm than served cold.

Great salad. Was good hot and cold. I thought the vermouth was a great touch. It added depth. Using a good olive oil is the key to flavor.

Good, but too oily. The vermouth was totally unnecessary (couldn't detect it); next time I'll substitute something on hand (white wine might work). I'd probably add some basil in addition to the parsley for extra flavor.
