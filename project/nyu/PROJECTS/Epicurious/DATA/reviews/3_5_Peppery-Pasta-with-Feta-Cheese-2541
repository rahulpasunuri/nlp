This was so easy and tasty. Used giardiniera because I had a jar. This made it even easier. No slicing and the oil added richness.

Delicious and so easy to prepare! I didn't have any pepperocini so I substituted a jalepeno, chopped. It worked so well I don't know if I will try the pepperocini.

Wonderful. I was really skeptical about pepperoncinis with pasta, but it was SO good. The only thing I would change would be to remove the bell pepper mixture before reducing the tomatoes and then adding them back at the end so they don't get overcooked. YUM!

This dish is even better if you the tomatoe content from 28 oz. to a 14.5 oz can of diced tomato. In this case less tomato is better.

This was so tasty. My husband and I both agreed that it was our new favorite tomato sauce. I didn't find it too vinegary or too spicy. It is quick and easy. Perfect for a week night.

I really enjoyed this dish! I love spicy sauces, and this is definitely that. It doesn't require a lot of prep.time, but it's a delightful change from my standby tomato sauce. The next time I make it, I'll likely use more garlic and feta, but it's very tasty as is.

I'm always looking for new pasta variations, and this one is excellent! I halved the recipe to serve two people, and it worked perfectly... although I still used three cloves of garlic, since we're garlic fiends. This dish is also very good with shrimp in it.

The vinegary taste of the peperoncini overpowered the dish, so much that I needed a lot more feta than the recipe called for. Also, it is too spicy to be a kids-friendly meal. I will not make it again.

Delicious! Just different enough from regular tomato sauce to be special. The dish turns out spicy and fresh. I added onions at the beginning because I love onions, and I cooked the sauce longer than was called for -- until the tomatoes were falling apart. Don't forget the feta cheese! I gave this four forks because it is easy, delicious, different and pretty healthy.

This is a very tasty vegetarian dish. The pepperoncini really adds a lot of flavor.
