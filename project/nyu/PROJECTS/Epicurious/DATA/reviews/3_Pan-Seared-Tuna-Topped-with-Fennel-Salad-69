Wow, I'm inclined to brand the writer of this recipe as totally incompetent.....at least as far as fresh tuna is concerned. Cooking for 6 minutes per side....and 1 1/2 inches thick! It will be not unlike a warmed tin of good-quality tuna from the supermarket.......

Usually I love the recipes from Epicurious. This one, however, left me cold. I think I wanted more orange and less oil. I felt that it lacked "punch". Perhaps adding orange segments would help. I certainly did not cook the tuna all the way to cardboard gray. I'm in the 1-2 minutes per side camp. The meal was saved by a delicious side salad from Epicurious, spinach salad with pear and avocado (#985).

excellent fennel salad, i used it with other fish as well through summer. definitely cook the tuna for less though (i just usually sear it a 1 - 2 minutes on each side )

The fennel mixture was uncommonly good! The vinaigrette worked perfectly with the fish the way it is, especially with the orange juice. However I would have grilled the fish instead of pan frying too.

Loved this recipe! The flavor of the orange juice blended wonderfully with the fennel. Will definitely make this again.

cook the tuna a tad less and on the grill lemon instead of orange juice
