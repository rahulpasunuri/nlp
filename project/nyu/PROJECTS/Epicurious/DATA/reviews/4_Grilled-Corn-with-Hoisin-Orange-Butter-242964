My favorite way to make corn on the cob. The butter is great on steamed or boiled corn too.

I have made this recipe many times because my family loves it and it's so easy. Since I couldn't find the recipe the last couple of times I just mixed up some butter, hoisen sauce and chili sauce, covered the corn with it before and during cooking, and it was wonderful!

This was FABULOUS! Easy and very very tasty. I would change nothing. Oh and I did not have flare up issues...

We were all surprised by just how tasty this was. We have made this on many occasions but the last time was when the future in-laws were visiting. They looked at me like I was insane as I slathered the corn with this brownish-orange goop as they are of the "just throw it on the bbq and serve with butter and salt" camp, but they had me giving them the recipe before we had even finished.

Great flavored corn and very easy to prepare. The butter was not overpowering and the corn turned out just like the photo. I did not have a flare up problem but it took more like 10 minutes to get the corn tender.

Outstanding and easy to prepare. The only modification - the second time we made this, we grilled the corn on rapid release aluminum foil to avoid the inevitable flair ups from the melting butter. Still achieved the same great flavor and a bit a browning - simply wonderful!

Yummy, yummy!! I brushed the corn with the sauce before grilling. Grilled it and then cut the corn off the ear. A Keeper!!

This was my first attempt at grilling corn. We had a nasty storm blow up so I had to use my indoor grill. The results were good, my corn actually looked like the photo! But I felt like the Hoisin -orange Butter covered up rather than complimented the corn. I think that this time of year when the corn is so fresh & tasty I'll stick with the basics- light butter, salt & pepper.

What a lovely surprise - we served this with fish cakes from Mark Bittman's "How to Cook Everything", and the grilled sweet potato salad on this site. We used a charcoal/wood fire, and let the coals get good and low before grilling, about 6" above the coals, giving 1/4 turns every 5 minutes. Delicious, fresh, bright flavors. Fun-yet-sophisticated on the plate.

Quite nice; we substituted fresh lemon zest for the orange peel to better compliment other meal flavors. We usually roast maize in the husk after soaking in water for an hour to keep the kernels from charring and to help steam the maize in its husk; this 'bare kernel' technique required some trial-and-error to not burn too many of the kernels. Used direct, rather than indirect, heat over lump charcoal. We'll definitely make this again .
