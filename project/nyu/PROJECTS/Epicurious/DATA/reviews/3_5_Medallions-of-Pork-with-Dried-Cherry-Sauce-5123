Outstanding recipe. I subbed white wine for the vinegar, and simply reduced in saucepan. I did not use the broth at all. I mixed butter and oil in the saute, then cooked the sliced tenderloin very gently uncovered. Covered 4 minutes, then added cherry sauce and heated on med hi until greatly reduced sufficient for a sauce. I used no spicing and it was perfect. Raves from my husband.

I tried this after receiving dried cherries as a gift. Thanks to the suggestions from the reviewer from Los Angeles, I used a 1 1/4 lb tenderloin roasted at 450 for 25 minutes. I'm sure the tenderloin would have looked better if I'd seared it but, once it was sliced, I don't think it made a difference. I reduced the sauce way beyond 2/3 cup; I reduced it for 20 minutes until it was only a few thick tablespoons. This is a recipe I will save for company because it's interestingly different and easy.

This will be a staple in my kitchen now. It is such an easy and impressive recipe that does not take much time or ingredients. I always have all three of these in my pantry. And what a great way to spruce up a grilled pork tenderloin, lamb chop or filet.

Made it with tenderloin medallions, no bones. Substituted chicken broth for water, and added a diced shallot & 1/3 cup chopped pecans. Thank you to the other reviewers for these suggestions. It's stunningly good for such an easy preparation.

Used seared/baked tenderloins, sliced into the finished sauce. Also thought it too vinegary - added 1T sugar and 1/2 C pomegranate juice. Delicious.

My husband and I love this recipe. It is easy and delicious. We have only made it with pork tenderloin, which we cook at 450 for 20-25 minutes, then tent for about 10 minutes. It comes out perfect every time. We have made this several times with cherries and it is delicious! The other day we made it with dried cranberries and we loved it. We might have even liked it better.

I made this dish using pork tenderloin, so I omitted the steps using the bones. I added more cherries and a little broth to offset the vinegar taste, since I didn't boil it as long as the recipe indicated. I also added shallots, per other reviews. Everyone loved it!

I love this recipe. I've been making it for over a year. I keep dried cherries and good balsamic vinegar in the cupboard at all times just so I can make it in a pinch. It's quick and always good. (Sometimes I use chicken breast tenderloins instead of pork....just brown them nicely and then slide them onto a plate and make the sauce, then pop the chicken back in to simmer in the sauce for a few minutes) I always add shallots though. I think it tastes better. Saute them before you add the broth. If I'm feeling fancy, a nice addition is chopped pecans! I saute them along with the shallots, then add the broth and make the rest of the sauce. Absolutely devine. My husband loves it when I make this dish. He pours the sauce all over his mashed potatoes. With the shallots and pecans, it's a 4 fork dish IMHO.

This was really good and simple to make. I did overcook the chops and will try not to do so next time.

I've made it several times. Usually add diced shallots. Have also used it as a marinade/sauce for grilled pork tenderloin

Instead of simmering over low heat for 25 minutes to reduce broth, I used high heat and reduced it in half the time. This was really tasty and fancy enough for company.

I made just the sauce as I had a pork loin. I used vegetable stock instead of the chicken stock. I had to boil it for a long time to reduce it enough---maybe by adding it to the pan after the chops (if I had gone with the chops) would have thickened it more. In the end it still wasn't "thick" but it was very good.

Delicious and pretty much foolproof. I usually make just two chops, but the full amount of sauce. To those who think it's too vinegary, maybe it's the brand of balsamic you're using. I imagine that it would be quite harsh with some of the cheaper supermarket brands. As a couple of reviewers have noted, a little butter at the end also mellows it out nicely (if you aren't worrying about fat).

Made this last night for the first time. Mmmmmm. I made it with tenderloin medallions, and my husband couldn't find dried cherries so we used cherry flavored Craisins. Weird, I know, but they use natural cherry flavor, and they were actually really good in the sauce, which was delicious. I made half again the amount of sauce, but used the original amount of vinegar, and it was perfect for our taste buds. We both loved it, and will make it often. Absolutely great flavor in the sauce!

I have to say that this dish moved me to write my first review. This dish has become a staple in our house. This is the "never-fail" dish when we have new folks over for dinner. Gush Gush. The dish as written is a fine way to go. As a note, we often use cranberries instead of cherries and it is just as good (if not better). Also, we make more sauce than is called for as it is often in high demand. The only point of caution is not to be overeager with the salt as the amount of stock you use is quite salty and you reduce it a bunch.

As did others, I used a pork tenderloin. In a small saucepan I reduced 2 cups of broth to 1 cup. Meanwhile I browned the pork in oil, removed it to a pan, then added the broth and scraped up the brown bits. I'm glad I read the negative review from Portland, Oregon on 9/26/00 which said the sauce was way too vinegary. I used about 2 tablespoons less of balsamic vinegar, and am surely glad I did. I think perhaps dried cherries (mine were very tart) and balsamic vinegars can vary in acidity. I mellowed out the sauce by adding a tablespoon of butter at the end. I needed to finish cooking the tenderloin in the oven (at quite a high heat) because the stovetop browning didn't quite do the job. I liked this dish. My dining companion loved it! Further to my earlier review, I now add a little slurry of cornstarch and water to the sauce near the end of cooking time. It thickens it up a bit and is a lot better this way.

I just found this recipe online after losing a written copy in a recent move. I searched over 450 recipes in Epicurious to find it. I have made this recipe many times for guests using the cherry sauce on a boneless pork roast stuffed with dry fruit. Always got rave reviews. Was so afraid I had lost this forever. Thank you for recipes online.

OK,OK, I KNOW I DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT. USED DRIED CRANBERRIES, THAT WERE WAY TO TART; THEN HAD TO ADD SUGAR AND CORN STARCH TO THICKEN. WILL TRY IT NEXT TIME WITH THE CHERRIES. IT WAS STILL GOOD THO'.ALSO, GRILLED A PORK TENDERLOIN TO GO WITH IT. DO YOU THINK THEY ARE STEALING OUR IDEAS OR AM I JUST PARANOID?

This was awesome! Made it with slices of pork tenderloin, so I didn't have the bones, which probably would have made it even better. I added extra cherries and extra balsamic...wonderful! Keep an eye on the sauce...once it reached a certain point it reduced REALLY quickly, and ended up almost too thick. Even the kids loved it (and the mother-in-law)!

Excellent recipe, pork turns out very moist and tender, the sauce is to die for I wouldn't make any changes to the original recipe.

I had this recipe at a friends place and I found the sauce to be excellent. I would not normally look for a recipe that has fruit in it, so I was quite suprised with the taste. It blended exceeding well with the pork. I definately would consider doing this recipe for my guests.

I didn't actully eat any of the pork--only sampled the sauce I made for this dish, because I made it for a neighbor who'd had a death in her family. She raved about it and said even her children loved it, so that's why I am giving it three forks! The pork did LOOK wonderful and moist, and the sauce tasted incredible, so very soon I will be making it for my own family--maybe then I will be qualified to give it the four forks it probably deserves!

The is escellent. My wife cravs this recipe. The trick is taking time to really reduce the sauce. Yum.

I've made this several times now and it has great flavor. I do double the sauce as well and I have made it with cherries and craisins - both are good but, although more expensive, I think the cherries win. This one is a keeper.

I originally made this recipe in March '98 when it was published. Since then I can't even count how many times I have made it. I serve it with the Butternut Squash and sage orzo. Perfect...I would not serve it any other way. I am a personal chef and can usually rope a client in with this one. It is worth the effort...and don't use craisins, use the cherries.

This is a nice way to cook pork chops and the sauce is outstanding.

I made this for a dinner party and the results were fabulous! The pork was moist and tender. I doubled the sauce and also made it in advance. It was delicious. Be sure to taste the sauce as you are cooking it down to be sure the vinegar is not too powerful. I served this over polenta which went really well the the sauce, too. Delicious!

I've made this twice using craisins instead of cherries (sounds like most of us did), and absolutely loved it. The only change I made the second time around was doubling the sauce. It's wonderful!! This is definitely one I'll make for company and for special. It's my favorite pork chop recipe (although I really like the idea of using a pork loin and adding some good wine. hmmm . . .)

I made this recipe twice. Both times, I got rave reviews. The balsamic vinegar takes longer to boil off than they say, so I finished the boiling in a glass measuring cup in the microwave so that I could reduce it the correct amount. It was hard for me to find dried cherries, and they're very expensive, so I used dried cranberries the first time and Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) the second time. I think it was better the second time because it tasted a little less salty. Definitely an easy make-again.

I cheated on this recipe and instead of browning the bones for the sauce, simply browned the chops and deglazed the pan with the chicken broth. I added the chops back in when the sauce was at about 75% of it's reduction target and simmered them the rest of the way. I'm sure the sauce has a much richer flavor when using the bones but this was really and good and very easy.

Horrible sauce. I followed the recipe to the letter and the sauce was just too vinegary. It never mellowed out. This recipe went straight to the trash -- it was awful.

This recipe lends itself well to large servings. I have used it for 12 people dinner parties without losing my mind too much. When I haven't been able to find dried cherries I have substituted dried cranberries and this works well also.

A nice way to cook pork - turns out very moist. The sauce was wonderful and making extra is a must!

DELICIOUS--HOWEVER, I didn't have the dried cherries,Soooo, I used 1/3C dried,sweetened cranberries with 1/3C Balsamic wine and added a 1/3C of fine port wine. It came out rich and smooth.especially when finished with a tablespoon of butter wisked in. A definite do-it-again!!

Ok, I varied this recipe and it still was outstanding and I think it was more simple. What I did was rubbed a pork loin with s&p and roasted it int he oven no messy cooking on the top of the stove and the sliced loin made nice presentation over a small bed or rice with sauce on top. I just purchased two cheap pork chops and cut away meat so I would have the bones to make the sauce . It was easy and delicious. I added a little butter to the sauce to make it a little richer. I DOUBLED THE SAUCE RECIPE , YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS GOOD STUFF AND IF YOU ARE SERVING OVER A SMALL BED OF RICE IT IS JUST A BONUS TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE SAUCE.

Possibly the tastiest sauce I have ever made. simmering the meat in broth made it super moist. Definitely a keeper

The cherry sauce is delicious and rich, while low in fat. It is a timely recipe but worth it. Don't overcook the pork!
