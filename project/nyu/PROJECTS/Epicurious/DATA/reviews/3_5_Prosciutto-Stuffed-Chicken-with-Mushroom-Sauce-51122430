I made half this recipe for my husband and I and we only ate one roulade. REALLY great recipe!! The sauce made it very special. I used 2 slices of prosciutto but only 1 slice of provolone per roulade. For the mushrooms, I used a combination of shiitakes and white. I didn't leave the roulades in the oven long enough to we had to nuke them.

This was pretty tasty. Even if you don't roll it perfectly it still looks fancy when you slice it into pieces. I did think it was a bit salty, perhaps because it calls for seasoning at every stage of the cooking! The prosciutto and provolone are already salty so I will remember to not overdo the seasoning next time. Also, I like the idea of adding a bit of flour or cornstarch to the sauce. My sauce never thickened so I boiled away too much of it trying. Still, the mushrooms were wonderful:)

Easy & yummy. As suggested, it's so simple to switch up the filling. I've made it as shown, and also made it w/ whatever good cheese & fresh herbs I've got on hand. This one's a keeper.

I bought aged provolone, and that wasn't necessary. Right out of the oven it was way too salty with the prosciutto and aged provolone. Next day it was rich and delicious. I also used spinach instead of basil. The sauce was easy to make and delicious.

This was a wonderful recipe, quite Northern Italian in style (we lived in Milano for many years). My entire family liked it just as it was, but I do use real prosciutto de Parma, not ersatz stuff. the mushroom sauce was great and my wife thinks its her favorite.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit with my guests. It was easy to make, I didn't have to spend my time in the kitchen, and the taste was wonderful. I paired with mushroom risotto, a salad, and some steamed vegetables.

I used fancy aged provolone and it was too salty right out of the pan, although tasted nice and rich the next day with less saltiness. I would use mile provolone and/or ham instead of proscuitto if making again. I also stuffed with spinach for winter... I might stuff with parsley next time to give it a little punch to counter the salty.

I make this all the time and the sauce really has more depth of flavor using the same pan. Just scrape out the cheese that may have oozed out--don't wipe out the pan. Keep the chicken blood to a minimum by patting the roulades dry before you start browning them. Remove them from the pan right when you take it out of the oven and start with the mushrooms right away. I keep a container of Wondra Flour close at hand if I feel it needs to be thickened a little--it depends on how much liquid is in the mushrooms. Just a sprinkle and it blends in very nicely. Sometimes a splash of heavy cream if I want something a little richer. Also, I've trained myself to keep the potholder resting on the handle of the pan when I take it out of the oven so I don't forget that the handle is hot. I've burned myself a time or two that way as well!

This is an expensive riff on the classic supreme de volailles Elisabet (sp?). The classic is any good jambon and gruyere and any mushrooms and shallots and nice wine to deglaze the pan and some cream for good measure -- so so much better. And easier just to pound out the two pieces of each half-breast and lay the cheese and ham inside; dust with flour and slide into some hot-ish butter and oil. Very very good - 3 forks!

I suppose it depends on your chicken breast's orientation-- horizontal/vertical-- but to be clear, I think they meant lengthwise, not widthwise.

I made this about a week ago and both my fiance and I thought it was pretty tasty. It also gets a thumbs-up for being quick - I was able to make this on a week night without ending up eating at 10pm. But: I'm not usually such a klutz, but managed to burn my hand quite badly on the pan handle when I started working on the sauce, because I'd forgotten that it had just come out of a 400 degree oven. What bugs me about this is that there's really no reason to make the meat and the sauce in the same pan; in fact, quite the opposite. You get the meat out of the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes, clean the pan and then take about 20 minutes to make the sauce. So you're not using any drippings, and you're better off starting the sauce while the meat is still in the oven. Just sayin'.

My husband and I love it. I make it without the sauce & the basil. We've had it a few times & I am serving again tonight. :-)

Tested this recipe out in the hopes of making it as part of a menu for 24 people for a Christmas dinner party. My husband and adult kids gave it 2 thumbs up. Used fontina instead of provolone but didn't change anything else. The sauce could probably use a little thickening (a little cornstarch maybe). One thing I like is I can make up to the point of baking ahead of time and then pop in the oven to finish it off.
