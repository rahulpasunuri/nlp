I found this recipe to be greasy and too watery.

These were very tasty but the batter comes out too heavy and thick, and does not spread easily in the pan. A crepe is supposed to have a thinner batter that moves around easier when you tilt the pan around and should easily cover the bottom with a few quick swirls. Too much flour or something. It produced a dense crepe and I like them lighter. Next time I would decrease dry ingredients. Also calls for way too much booze. I cut down severely on the liquor in both the sherry and the cognac and tasted great with a lot less, however I did not ignite it at the end. I also omitted the current jam and served with a sprinkling of powdered sugar.

I haven't tried this one, but I have tried strawberry crepes and they are fabulous. If you like strawberries than you will love these. Also it tastes even better if you add icing sugar and whipped cream on top.

I didn't make this recipe, although it looks good. I would recommend that one use a proper crepe pan, that is one that you dip into the batter and the shell forms on the surface of the pan. You then cook it lightly and peel off the crepe. This does make creating crepes very easy and uniform. Most specialty shops have crepe pans of this nature.

These were very good but intersting. It was hard flipping them in the pan. I didn't put a lot of strawberrys in them eather, but it depends on your own taste. I would eat them again but not make them. I think it does depend on your ability to make things.
