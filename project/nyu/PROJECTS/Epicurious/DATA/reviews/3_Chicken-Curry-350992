This recipe was excellent! Rich, flavorful curry was restaurant-quality. My only substitutions were: I used ground spices (except for fennel seeds) and dried lemongrass because I had these on hand. The videos were helpful. Would definitely make this again.

Not sure if we used the correct chiles but it wasn't "rich and intense", it was rather bland and disappointing for all the work. I wouldn't make this again.

Oh my god! This is sooooo good! The smell of the spices toasting is an air freshener in itself!
