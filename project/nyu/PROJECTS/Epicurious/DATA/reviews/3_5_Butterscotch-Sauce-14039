There is a Salted Carmel sauce on this site that is much better.

Made according to the recipe...excellent taste, easy to make and a very versatile sauce. A good do ahead menu item.

Great recipe! I was really craving butterscotch topping so I made this. It was so fast and easy to throw together, using ingredients that most people have in their kitchen anyway. The one change I made was I only had salted butter so I used that and omitted the pinch of salt.

This sauce is DELCIOUS!! It really dresses up ice cream and has the true flavors of buttery and rich butterscotch. Its simple and makes a great gift in a pretty jar!

To my taste it was too "gloppy" and too sweet with out other flavor notes. The texture was oily and didn't carmelize when it was hot and met the ice cream.

This is a great sauce--very rich. There's a caramel sauce on this site that I prefer, but this was very good, too. I made it for the fallen chocolate cake dessert, and it was delicious.

Very good butterscotch sauce and easy to make. I made to use on ice-cream. Watch out, if you let the color get brown (as opposed to golden) the whole sauce ends up tasting burnt.

This sauce is fabulous! For a little twist, try adding a shot of espresso in exchange for a little of the liquid and serve the coffee caramel sauce over shortcakes...it doesn't get any better!

I made this sauce for another dessert and it turned out beautifully. I would use it anytime I need this type of sauce. Watch the color; it could get too dark very easily!

This is a delicious butterscotch sauce. It takes awhile for the sugar mixture to turn a caramel color. Watch it carefully, because it turns color all at once, and if you are not careful, it will get too dark. It is great over ice cream.
