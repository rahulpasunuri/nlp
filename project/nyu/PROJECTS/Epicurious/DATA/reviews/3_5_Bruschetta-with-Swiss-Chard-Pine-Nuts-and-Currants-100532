Superb. We like garlic so I rubbed a raw garlic clove over the toasts before ladling on the chard--very yummy!

This dish was delicious, and my guests loved it. Like some other cooks, I also added the currant-soaking liquid to the pot with the chard and then covered it, letting the chard wilt in the liquid until it got really soft.

YUMMM EEE!! I made it just as the recipe states except I sprinkled freshly grated parmesan on top and put it back in the oven for a few minutes to melt. Also, I used a narrow french batard so the pieces were more 2-bite sized. I made it for a friday evening, after work, appetizer. We followed it with a home made red clam sauce and linguini. My husband loved it. I agree with the previous reviewer, it is a nice twist on the usual tomato/basil brushcetta. Very easy.

Try this -- when you add the greens, turn the heat to medium-high and add the currant soaking liquid, and let it reduce. It adds tremendous flavor. I didn't have currants or pine nuts on hand, so I substituted dried blueberries and chopped hazelnuts. I also skipped the bread and served it as a side dish instead of as bruschetta. It was fantastic!

Oh my goodness! Superb blend of sweet and savory flavors. While I wouldn't serve it at a stand-up cocktail party, I have served it to guests who were seated with cocktail napkins. Rave reviews everytime!

I liked the flavors in this recipe but the flavors didn't seem to come together. A sauce or binding agent was needed to bring the greens, currants, garlic and pine nuts together. I would add more garlic and possibly some red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar.

Nice appetizer- feels healthy, good flavour. Next time I make it, I'd reduce the amount of oil slightly.

Excellent recipe. I substituted dried cherries once when I couldn't find currants. Worked great.

This is a bizarre recipe. It is very messy. We wound up just taking the chard off the plate and eating it separately from the bread. It didn't taste bad, but I don't see the point in having this huge heap of greens on toast. Garlic bread and salad is a more normal way to eat this.

Just fabulous! I used red wine to soak the currants. Have also used this as filling for ravioli.

This dish is delicious, and hardly any effort to make. The sweetness of the currants combine with the garlic and pine nuts beautifully. A welcome change from my standard tomato-and-basil bruschetta, especially in winter.
