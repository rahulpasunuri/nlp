I didn't use carrots. I cut the cold cooked potatoes into cubes about 3/4 inch. Instead of using ham I used Proscuitto, it has more flavor is less bulky and if cut finely adds a distinct contrast to the sweetness of the peas without making the salad too hammy. Next I made a simpler vinaigrette of olive oil, 1 Meyer Lemon - juice and the grated zest. The lemon brought at out the brightness of the vegetables more.

Bleh. It would be better to cut the carrots smaller and leave them raw, and do the same for the snap peas. Simply a bit ho-hum as is. I'd also chop up some Italian parsley, to give this a fresher kick.

This is a salad I have gone back to many times over the last 10 years. It was a hit in 1998 for a baby shower and is still as delicious every time we make it. I've even made it for a St. Patrick's Day potluck, onitting the ham, layering the vegetables on top of the spinach in green, white and orange sections. The entire Easter menu from the 1998 magazine is one of the best ever.

A hearty salad with a punch-packed dressing! Maybe a little less potatoes next time? A light (and more economical) Christmas alternative.

This is a great way to prepare a ham "salad". I have made this recipe and the entire menu from the April 1998 magazine several times. It's easy, elegant and low fat. Simply delicious.

I left out the ham and served it as a side with a smoked salmon frittata. It was a hit. The boiled veggies with the shallot dressing is reminincent of german potatoe salad without the bacon. Delicious. We will definitely be having this again at our house.

I made this for Easter dinner as a side dish and eliminated the ham because ham was part of the meal. It worked great! I will use the left over ham to put with the left over salad and use it as a main dish.

I served this as a delicious side at my Oscars viewing party last night. The vinaigrette makes the dish -- it's absolutely delicious stuff! Everyone went back for seconds and thirds. Very hassle-free, I prepped the veggies earlier and just tossed it all together before my guests arrived. The only problem I encountered was the potatoes getting too starchy and gumming up the other veggies a little. Next time I make it, I'll try new potatoes that don't have to be cut up or a waxier variety.

There's a whole lotta salad going on here! Dressing was a bit dull, I'd add fresh hebs next time, but if leftovers are your thing, this will serve as a side salad or lunch for at least two or three more meals. A good weekday solution.

This was a perfect side dish for Easter! I omitted the ham in the recipie and simply served it along side our Easter ham. It was perfect since it provided not only fresh vegetables, but just the right amount of starch (thanks to the potatoes) without being too heavy. Could also make the vegetables ahead of time and didn't have to worry about timing anything for when everyone arrived. The shallot vinaigrette would be great on any salad.

A great spring main dish! One of my guests praised it as "the freshest food" she'd had all year. I used vegetables from the farmer's market and an inexpensive ham from the grocery store and managed to put together an elegant and tasty main dish for our Easter brunch.

A great dish! Even my father, who is not inclined to like "low-fat" dishes, enjoyed this one.

I served this Easter 1998 and just loved it. The flavors were great and I used a nice smoked ham. One would never guess this is a "lite" receipe
