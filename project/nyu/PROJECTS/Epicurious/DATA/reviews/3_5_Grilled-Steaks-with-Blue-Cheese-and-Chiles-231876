Ok so I cut this recipe out years ago and finally made it tonight. It was amazing! Unfortunately, I was out of white wine vinegar and only had jarred jalapenos! But I used red wine vinegar and the marinade and sauce were amazing. My husband, son and I just loved this and for sure I will make for company in the near future! I also made the Rosemary Garlic roasted potatoes on the site which really went great with this.

This recipe was fabulous! My husband and I absolutely loved it! Next time though, I will double the cheese mixture - it was that good! Thank you for such a great recipe!

We found the topping too spicy (and we really like spice) and the topping wasn't complimentary to the tenderloin. We love blue cheese topping but, this combination didn't seem to work.

Delicious! Tender and juicy! Low and slow with the 5 minutes on each side grilling. Amazing! The little pizazz of the chilies was great!

I only made the blue cheese topping part of this recipe, and it was very good on top of our beef tenderloin steaks. I followed the recipe as written. I did use a very good quatlity white wine vinegar because I had it (not sure if that made a difference or not). I made it several hours before dinner, but took it out in time for it to reach room temperature which is how it needs to be served. Guests loved it.

Didn't use the marinade but tried out the blue cheese sauce. Super easy to make and full of flavor. We loved that the blue cheese didn't overpower and the jalapenos offered just enough kick. Will definitely make again! www.adventuroustastes.com

This recipe is amazing. I've made it several times. I have made it with top sirloin steaks as well as the prescribed recipe. Every time i make it people love it.

I wasn't crazy about his, but I think it's just that I'm not into blue cheese sauces on beef, I think the sauce tasted a bit bland too. I'll skip the sauce next time, but use the marinade.

Very tasty recipe. I am not one to add anything but salt and pepper to a tenderloin, but this was a delicious change. Served it was a simple salad.

very good topping...will use leftovers to make a grilled sandwich....added some serrano to the sauce because I like it hot!

Couldn't find red jalapenos so had to settle for just green ones. No matter...we enjoyed this dish and will have it again soon.

Delicious! I used fatfree cream cheese and substituted red onion for the shallot with excellent results.

I LOVE this recipe!! I typically like to have simply steak, or steak with a red wine reduction sauce but, this topping is a wonderful treat! I wouldn't make this everytime I want steak but, it is very good and I didn't change a thing. Be sure to select fresh, crisp chiles.

I must say, I was really looking forward to this recipe, but it turned out below my expectations. One of my all-time favorites is Steak with Shallot-Gorgonzola butter (search for it) and I thought this would be a similarly good recipe. Not so. I found the sauce rather underwhelming, with all the flavors poking out individually instead of mixing.

This has become a household favorite. We prepared as is but used red and green jalepenos. Excellent. We spend our entire meal going "man, this is so good" every time I make it.

Perfect as is!

I made this for dinner this weekend and it received raves. Previous reviews were helpful for some good ideas. As a result, I used red AND green jalapenos for great color and added honey beer to the steak marinade. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly with outstanding results. This will be a repeat dish in our house!

For an outdoor concert picnic - made recipe exact, then thinly sliced the steaks and served on ciabatta rolls with a hefty smear of the cheese. Added carmelized onion, mushroom and sun dried tomato mixture - and WOW - this was awesome. Received rave reviews and will definitely make again.

Fabulous! And so easy. I substituted reg. green chiles for the jalopenos and it still tasted fantastic! Great for entertaining.

Made this for Father's Day - a perfect result. Not only was the topping tasty and out-of-the-ordinary, but the shallots and chiles also added a little crunch to every bite. Very delicious - with such little effort to make an ordinary steak into something spectacular!

I made it for my family and they all loved it. The sauce was amazing and easy to make. I baked the tenderloins at 400 and they were perfectly cooked. I served it with au-grautin potoatoes and corn. It was a great lake dinner.

It was very good-a nice added spice to the steaks. I would add more bleu chesse next time for my taste.

Outstanding! A classic with a Chile twist. The first time I cooked thesteaks, I followed the recipe the as it was written. A little soicy for my taste so I haved the chile and it was perfect the second time around.

WOW !!! If you love blue cheese this recipe is a must . It's wonderfully diffrent ..

I found the bleu cheese and peppers to be too over-powering that I couldn't taste the steak. I scrapped it off and it was still too much for my liking.

This recipe is so good and doesn't take long to put together. We have already made it 3 times since getting it in the March BA. Everyone has enjoyed it. I highly recommend using green and red chiles ~ gives nice color blend to blue cheese mix.
