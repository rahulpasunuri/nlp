I mixed in a little less anchovy paste and used it with broccoli and my kids love it.

I love anchovies and buttered radishes, so I knew I would love this recipe in advance. I actually increased the proportion of anchovy paste and left out the lemon juice, but it would have been better with the lemon. However, I agree that it looks really gray and unattractive, and it makes much more butter than you need. This is a nice snack if you make way less of the butter than is called for, but it's just not good looking enough to serve to company.

I wouldn't make this again. The taste was just OK but it did not look appetizing at all. My guests didn't even want to try it.

I suspect this would be great on a steak. But on radishes the anchovy is ovewhelming (and I like anchovies). If you're looking for a buttered radish recipe that's tweaked a bit (rather than an anchovied radish recipe), I'd start with about 1/4 as much anchovy.

Tried this one as it sounded pretty cool. It was just way too rich for our taste. However, since we had all that butter left over, we tried it with corn on the cob ... that was excellent!

Ran it through the first time using the butter. Two forks- Good. YMMV. Ran it through a second time subbing sour cream liked it more. Two and a half forks- Better. Note: Not for date night. If I keep playing with this I will have the worst smelling breath this side of the equator.
