This was by far the best chicken I've ever made or eaten! And my family and friends all agreed. I brined three chickens first, only because I always do, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. The flavor was wonderful, and the meat was very tender. Well worth the effort.

Moist, flavorful and easy... especially if you do the prep the night before. Breast meat actually had a great flavor.

My kids and husband really enjoyed this recipe. It is quick and easy. I just used thighs and drumsticks.

My husband's comment says it all, " I never had chicken until I had this chicken".

This recipe was very good and easy. I cooked the chickens for about 1 hour using the grill's rotisserie burner and one lower burner (to maintain heat). The temp stayed around 325 and the birds were juicy and flavorful.

This recipe is where food memories start. It was delicious and my husband and i are still talking about the night we had the roasted chicken on the balcony!

We used one 6-pound chicken in place of two smaller birds, and cooked it for 1 and 1/2 hours. Otherwise, we followed the recipe as written. It was so flavorful and tender - the meat fell off the bone. Fabulous!

This recipe is amazingly easy, delicate, and simple to please anyone. Being a fresh college student from the city, the idea of cooking is very challenging as well as a bit terrifying without the aid of another cook (or mom). But by easily glancing at the ingredients required in this recipe it becomes very hard to consider this meal difficult, yet the outcome is so very very delicious. The ingredients and preparations were exactly followed and copied throughout my trial with this dish. However I was unaware that this needed to marinade for around 6 hours at least, so next time I will try that but it was still very good with 2 hours. Another thing that was different as to how I've cooked my chicken was that I used my Halogen Convection Oven to cook. It's my preferred method simply because it keeps the meat moist and simple to use.

Delicious!! I thought it could use just a little less salt, but the whole family thought it was perfect. This will be a regular for us. So easy too.

Incredibly tender and wonderful. I used fresh herbs from the garden. I used a 6 lb bird and it took about 1 1/2 hours. Perfect for an early Fall evening.

This is without a doubt the easiest backyard party success material. Don't change a thing - just do it!

I think the reviewer from Marin didn't put a disposable aluminum pan under the chickens to catch the drips like it stated. Hence, flareups.

We absolutely love this recipe. I have made it about 6 times and it goes over great every time. I haven't changed anything, done it on the rotisseie and had great results with no problems really.

This was a very good basic recipe. My dinner turned out fantastic and it was very easy and yummy. I admit I did things a bit different. I decided since I had time with the chicken in advance to brine it. I used water, salt, sugar, garlic and thyme. I brined it for about 4 hours. I then drained, rinsed and patted the chicken dry. I then followed this recipe. The only changes I made to this recipe was to add a little more butter and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the butter mix. I baked the 3lb chicken in a 400 degree oven for 1 hour. It turned out perfect. Very yummy and juicy. I will not hesitate to make this lovely recipe again!

This was really delicious! I sometimes find herbes de Provence to be overwhelming, but not with this dish. Since the food should turn next to, and not over the flames, I lit just one side of my gas grill and removed the coals from the other to make room for the drip pan. My grill only has two burners, so I roasted just one chicken on the rotisserie over the drip pan on the unlit side of the grill. The darker leg end was next to the heat source to ensure an evenly cooked bird. I love roasted chicken and this was so simple to do.

Although this was very tasty, it was a nightmare to deal with if your rotisserie sits over the flames! I kept having to deal with fires the whole time is was cooking. Lisa
