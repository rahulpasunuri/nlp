I thought these were great! I had to reheat the chocolate a couple times because I moved too slowly: if you do this, be sure to only heat as much as necessary. And the oil is vital to it working out! Topped with crushed Nutter Butter cookies and crushed tortilla chips. It was fabulous! I also need to leave them on the counter for a few prior to eating, otherwise too cold for me teeth! Nom!

This was great. I melted the chocolate in a double boiler and kept the chocolate over the hot water while I was dipping the pieces of banana, so it didn't cool down too quickly. I also avoided the chocolate-on-fingers problem by using a fondue fork to swirl the pieces in the chocolate. I topped with 3 different toppings--pecans, coconut and by far the best was crushed salted pretzels. Everyone voted the pretzel ones as their favorite. Will make this again!

Absolutely delicious - I recommend waiting a little while after taking them out of the freezer to munch on them, unless you like to freeze your gums, that is! Super-easy to make, not at all time-consuming.

this is the second time I've made this. I melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second increments at 50%. Both times I didn't add oil. Does anyone know the point of the oil other than to thin it out? I wait about 10 mins for the chocolate to cool. The first 5 I make look great and then it all goes downhill and clumpy as the chocolate cools very quickly. By the end the chocolate will not stick. I think the best way to make this is definitely NOT freeze the bananas, and work in small batches of freshly melted chocolate in clean new bowls, otherwise you end up wasting a whole lot of chocolate. 4 forks for taste, 3 forks for functionality--kind of a pain to make even if it only takes about 5 mins to assemble.

My rating is based soley on preparation. What a mess! I didn't wait 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool and a good thing. After a while it became too hard to coat the bananas evenly - I think I licked more chocolate off my fingers than ended up on the bananas. Started using two spoons, but after the chocolate became stiffer and I quit altogether.

Simple, elegant, tasty appetizer. The reviewers that froze the bananas prior to dipping did not read the recipe - you freeze them AFTER dipping - no problem with the chocolate thickening that way. Use Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chips for the richest chocolate flavor.

whoever suggested freezing them...no no no! when i touch the cold banana to the chocolate, the chocolate thickened and didnt stick nicely. worked way better when just fresh bananas

Just did these and with less oil and semi frozen bananas, this was fast, easy and wonderful. I used toasted coconut, almonds, Heath bits, and pecans.

I have made these several times since it came out. This last time was very fast and easy. I found melting the chocolate in a bowl over hot water was the best. You can add a liquior if you wish to the chocolate. I too, froze the peeled bananas first. I use tongs to save the calories I would lick off my fingers.

I made these for a girls lunch I had. so much fun. One of my friends is a chef. I think she was impressed!

If you use dark chocolate and toasted nuts these will nearly qualify as health food! My family went WILD for these. One tip: Peel and freeze the bananas ahead of time in a ziploc bag. Slice the frozen bananas and then dip and roll them. When I did this on my second batch, the chocolate set up better and they were just more attractive.

It's fun, easy, and tasty. They're perfect for a casual dinner dessert. I had way more chocolate than I needed for 3 bananas, and I was trying to really glop it up! I ended up mixing all remaining toppings (peanuts, coconut, and heath bar) into the pot with the leftover chocolate and dropping it onto the pan with the other banana bites. My grandmother would have called it "summertime fudge." Tasted just as good as the bananas. ;) May experiment next time by subbing 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips for 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Who doesn't like peanut butter-chocolate-bananas?

These were great! I made them for a casual dinner party and they were a hit. Served them with ice cream and drizzled the leftover melted bittersweet chocolate over the ice cream. When I read that others had trouble getting the chocolate to stick, I decided to leave out the oil and I had no troubles at all. I used toffee, nuts and sprinkles for the kids. I started dipping and dredging but ended up sprinkling the topping on them after dipping in chocolate - less mess and looked prettier. I'll definitely make these again and again!

The recipe is yummy, but I had trouble with the chocolate not sticking to the banana. This was very messy to make and mine were not very attractive - but they tasted great!

These were very easy to make and were a huge hit. We ate 1/2 of them before they even froze all the way! I covered mine in toasted coconut. Yum!

Made these for my father since his doctor told him to get more fiber in his diet. Personally I can't stand bananas even the smell of them, so no greater love than to do this. Dad LOVES them! Used dry roasted peanuts, coconut, heath bar. Definite hit and will be making again

Easy and tasty. I made a half recipe of chocolate and had plenty for two bananas. Butterfingers and coconut were good coatings. Definitely need to let the chocolate cool a full 15 minutes to keep from making a huge mess.

Very quick and easy to make! I used chopped pecans, crushed Heath Bars, and unsweetened coconut with a little bit of sugar. The yield was closer to 24 "bites" for me.
