These were yummy! I modified a bit (crushed tortilla chips for cornmeal), ate two and stored two in the refrigerator for lunch tomorrow. I used a cast iron pan and oil (more than called for), and I had no problems with sticking.

I have made this many times, but not exactly as printed. I press the "burgers" into a little panko for added crispiness and then serve them over greens or arugula. Top with a lemon mayo made by mixing lemon juice with lowered-fat mayo and herbs to your taste. Quick, tasty and healthy. This is as good or better using canned salmon. Just make sure to get the brand with no bones.

We made this as a last minute meal the Sunday after Thanksgiving (we were needing something other than turkey). We used yellow onion an added garlic. The burgers were quite good. They were cooked on a well seasoned cast iron skillet and we didn't have problems with sticking. The consistency was like a crab cake. The whole family liked them...my 3 year old said "I really like these." My other son said "they are not too fishy."

I, too, had no green onions and substituted with finely-grated white onion. I also added the two previously-suggested garlic cloves, minced super-fine, and a quarter-teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning. But my personal "piece of resistance" was adding about 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese. Finally, I fried them in a non- stick skillet using plenty of olive oil. Wow! The patties were so good, they didn't need condiments; I ate two before I could stop myself!

I'd agree with the mixed reviews. My husband and guest quite liked the burgers, though I thought they were nominal. I used some red onion in place of some of the green onion and topped them with thin slices of mozzerella cheese along with the fresh tomatoes. While the burgers barely held together when placed on the pan, as they cooked, they browned nicely and were able to be flipped while staying in one piece. I would recommend frying them on a nonstick pan. I fried half of the burgers in a regular skillet and the other half on a nonstick pan. The nonstick pan gave a nice light brown coating as opposed to the quick-cooking dark brown of the other burgers. They were wonderfully quick to make, which is a necessity these days having a newborn to care for.

I'm always looking for meals which can be enjoyed by the whole family. My 3 year old loved these (I made smaller patties for her and served them on miniature burger buns) and hubby and I added extra seasoning to pep them up a bit. I followed the advice of other reviewers, added garlic and fresh cilantro (coriander) and they came out great. A quick weekday supper.

My wife and I thought it was just OK. Not crazy about it. A little too bland and I added garlic as suggested, too! Easy to prepare, though. If in a pinch in the future and nothing else to make, I'd possibly think about it.

Yummy! We are in Ukraine and so we had to skip some of the more exotic ingredients, using twice as much breadcrumbs instead of corn meal, and regular onions instead of green onions, and it was still really good. We added garlic automatically and wow -- what extra zip. This is a great dish. Will definitely make it again!

well for all those who found this receipe a little bland just add one or two minced garlic cloves and if you want some interesting taste once in a while add some fresh herbs (e.g. sage is really tasty, maybe time or basil... it's your choice). if you add a tbs of mayonaise, burgers will be moist, but than you add fat... so it's an exelent burger and I make it almost very week once. with a salad and side by choice it's a quick and easy dinner or lunch. to hold the patties together just press them really firm and maybe use less onion or what's mom mom does, she grates it or doesn't use it at all (just garlic!). yes, you noticed well it's allmost a family receipe now!

This is a great recipe, but it needed a little something for a more interesting flavor. I added some fresh basil and finely chopped red pepper. I used regular hamburger buns and melted cheddar on top for a rather yummy version of a tuna melt.

YUM! YUM! Wow! I did not expect this to be as good as it was - what a nice surprise! I thought that the flavor was excellent - though I did add a few more onions than it called for (but I'm an onion lover!). I think that I'll try using low-fat mayo in the mixture next time and stick with the regular for topping the bread. Bottom line: If you like tuna salad sandwiches, you'll LOVE these!

Easy to make. I made it for a friend and myself for a light lunch. We enjoyed it.....it probably wouldn't hurt to doctor it up a little.

I agree with the cook from Columbus OH that the flavor was too bland. After tasting the mixture I added a generous tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and that kicked up the flavor a good deal. Allen Sharpe, Sacramento, CA.

I prepared this for a luncheon and everyone liked it very much - asking for the recipe! It is a good one to add to low fat menus.

Something didn't quite cut it flavorwise with this recipe....plus the patties did not hold together well.
