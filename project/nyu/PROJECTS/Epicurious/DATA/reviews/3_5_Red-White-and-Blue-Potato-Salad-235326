Great recipe even for non blue cheese lovers. To the other reviewers who rated this poorly, you don't peel any of the potatoes. Mix a little of the dressing in at a time so it does not get too soupy. Have made this many times. It always gets rave reviews.

I followed the recipe and peeled then boiled the purple potatoes and as they cooked from outside in, the outside of the potatoes started molting and crumbling off. I'm going to have to find another recipe that includes the right way to cook purple potatoes.

As a potato salad connoisseur (read: I've eaten BOATLOADS of it in my lifetime), I thought it was high time I actually tried making it myself. This recipe did not disappoint--the dressing is tangy and a little bit sweet, just the right combo for a deelish potato salad that will have everyone going back for seconds. I did make some changes though: I'm a purist, so out went the blue cheese and peas, and in came about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chopped sweet pickle. Yummy.

I've made this half a dozen times to rave reviews from family and foodie coworkers alike. Have made it both with and without the addition of the blue cheese at the end, and it's yummy either way. One caveat - it is definitely better after a few hours or even the next day. Delish!

Old stand by for a potato or salad dish. Easy, fun and interesting to make.

This is the only potato salad recipe I make. I figure I'll get enough of the standard potato salad at picnics throughout the summer. This takes potato salad to a whole new level. We've made this every summer since it came out in 2006, and I'm about to make it this weekend, which is why I decided to review it. I would say if you don't like any of the ingredients, you're obviously not going to like this. I guess you have to like blue cheese. Personally, I could live off of this recipe. All the ingredients work very well together. If you cant find purple or blue potatoes, no need to worry. It's just as good without them.

I loved this potato salad and so did my guests. I only needed enough for four servings so I made half the dressing recipe. I used only small red potatoes, unpeeled. When my husband tasted it, he thought it was missing something. I added 3 slices of cooked, chopped bacon. I made it a couple hours in advance so the potatoes could absorb the dressing. Awesome! I will definately save this one to make again. Regarding the difficulty of peeling small potatoes; cook them with the skin on, the skins will slip off after being cooked.

Overall fairly decent, but really seems to be missing something. I think next time I'd experiment with some additional herbs and spices and maybe add some celery and red bell peppers for some crunch. It's good "enough", but just kind of bland despite the blue cheese.

Made thsi July 4th and everyone liked it. Be careful not to overcook the taters or it will be purple mashed potato salad. I did that and while everyone was a good sport about eating it, to me it looked ooky.

I doubled the recipe and left the dressing part as directed so their wouldn't be too much sauce and it worked out good. Peeling the little purple potatoes was a pain in the butt. I also only added like 4 oz of blue cheese so it wouldn't be overpowering. Went over very well with the family though.

I haven't tried it. It's so gorgeous, I want a plateful right now... but almost no one else in my family likes blue cheese.. and co- incidentally, they don't like feta either.. so what's a girl to do.. ?

A fun twist on potato salad, but I agree with the other reviews...use only half the amount of dressing, at most!

I have made this several times great recipe for a differant potato salad. However, the sauce almost needs 4 lbs of potates..so you have to just adapt it to taste..use a little less

Loved the salad and served it with the tenderloin and roasted veggies from the same article. Used Maytag Blue and it was a big hit.

I thought the recipe was a little heavy on the blue cheese. However, my family loved it and it was a nice change from traditional potato salads.

My family did not care for this. I think they prefer more of the crunchy vegetables of a tradition potatoe salad

I do not normally care for potatoes, but as a blue cheese fanatic, I fell in love with this potato salad! I did not add the peas and I used red onion instead of green. I served it for dinner guests and they raved about it. It was divine!

Huge BBQ hit. Different from your typical potato salad. I would add the blue cheese and dressing to taste. it is quite a lot of dressing for the amount of potatoes and the blue could be over bearing if the whole amount is used.
