Great appetizer. I added a handful of the mushroom stems (minced) to the onion step. Toasted walnuts might be a nice addition too, but it is great as is. I got almost double the stuffing for my mushrooms. I was a little worried about not pre-baking the mushroom caps to release the moisture, but the mushrooms were soggy. However, I might try it next time to see if the stuffing "sticks" to the caps a little better. Great recipe for gluten free & vegans.

What a fabulous vegan recipe! I made it without freezing and thawing the tofu and it was fine. That step would probably have made it even better. I pressed the tofu on towels between two plates with a 28-oz can on top for an hour before making the stuffing and that removed a lot of the water. Don't make the novice error of buying silken tofu - use the normal firm tofu from the refrigerated section - that crumbles pretty well. Get white miso from the Asian grocery in the refrigerated section. Also, I stuffed both small and medium mushrooms. I made these for a cocktail party and everyones favorites were the small mushrooms that you can pop in your mouth. The scallion on top gave it a little pop. Also, everyone talked about how "buttery" they were. I think this was due to those last 2 tablespoons of olive oil drizzled over top of the stuffing - so don't leave it out! As many people said, there was a LOT of stuffing - so get two containers of mushrooms at least. You'll have enough.

I actually discovered this recipe by accident. I fell into the swimming pool, and there it was! (Just kidding.) I was trying to concoct a vegan recipe that my carnivore and vegetarian friends wouldn't find too, um, boring. I just happened to have mushrooms and walnuts and tofu on hand, and when I threw all three of them into Google, this recipe emerged. I didn't have ALL of the ingredients on hand, so I substituted tahini for the miso, fresh thyme for the rosemary, and chopped red peppers for the tomato. It was delicious. Since I decided it was a "keeper," I tried it with the ingredients as written. A much better mix, mostly because the miso has a deeper flavor, and the tomatoes added moisture. Now, I usually add something spicy like a ground red pepper such as cayenne, chipotle, etc., or even chopped canned chipotles, or minced jalapenos or serrano peppers). Dry ingredients I add with the salt, and the other peppers with the onions since they need to cook down some. For a sit-down dinner, I use larger mushrooms, but if I'm bringing this dish to a party, I use smaller mushroom caps that people can pick up with a few fingers (toothpicks don't really work...). They are a HUGE hit. Always.

This is a favorite around my house and in my pot-luck happy community. Can be made as an appetizer or as a vegan/ vegetarian entree (by stuffing portabella caps!) I love to fact that the "bulk" of the stuffing is tofu rather than bread crumbs - an opinion echoed by vegan and dieting friends alike!

delicious and easy to make- just a little time consuming. followed directions- added a little more miso and tomato paste then stated. the filling is very delicious and you get more than enough for 12 mushrooms- i filled 35 mushrooms and still have about half a cup left of filling. great appetizer for both vegans/vegetarians and your carnivore friends.

My family enjoyed this recipe a lot. Especially my vegetarian 20 something children. I tweaked it though. I didn't stuff the mushrooms I chopped them and added them to the mix. Then I served it with brown rice, added some summer roasted veges as a side dish and topped it with grapes for dessert. I added a little extra walnuts & put 3 tsp of miso instead of what the recipe called for. Bonapetit!

I had a lot of letfover stuffing, but it was delicious on its own. Freezing and defrosting the tofu seemed to make it crumble nicely and have the consitency of ground meat or turkey. Delicious!

I made these for a barbecue and everyone's reaction was they're OK. Very bland. I won't make them again.

I've made this twice in a week! Once as is (really good) and once by adding four large pureed mushrooms and a diced medium carrot at the tofu stage, cooking it until the moisture had evaproated, and then adding chopped, cooked kale at the very end and turning it into a tofu struedel with some phyllo pastry- a big hit at a vegan dinner party. You could even use this as an interesting filling for ravioli! I think I'm obsessed...;-)

Great recipe. It can also be used to fill phyllo triangles - then just freeze, brush with olive oil and bake! Meat-eaters love them and the phyllo triangle provides a visual barrier so they won't ask questions.

This has got to be the best recipe. I'd rate it up there with a great steak! And the filling can even just be eaten alone. Even my 16 year old son and my husband who won't go near a mushroom said they weren't that bad and ate them without a complaint. Coming from a houseful of guys, I take that as an A "ok". You've gotta try this. I've also used the filling in the big portabella's and those are super too! The nutty taste keeps me comin' back for more!

My vegan and carnivore family loved it! You don't need to freeze and thaw the tofu if you use a better quality tofu. (I used Small Planet garlic & herb and curry tofu blocks.) Absolutely delicious. The estimated 12 mushrooms is way too low. I had enough extra filling for 15 more. (The extra filling is great with scrambled eggs in a burrito, btw!)

One of the rare good-tasting tofu recipes I have tried. Your guests won't know they're eating something that's good for them. It took me a 1.5 hours to chop all the ingredients, though, so it's not a quick recipe.

If made with portobello mushrooms, can be a delicious veggie main course for holidays (I provide these as an alternative to the turkey on Christmas). Some delicious substitutions: pine nuts for the walnuts add some fresh bread crumbs from a multigrain loaf add some riccotta cheese and/or fontina or parmesan before baking yum!!

Wonderful! My family always runs into problems with meals due to the fact my little sister is a vegan. We made this as an appetizer and it was a big hit for all of us who like mushrooms. This has a unique flavor and texture. I reccommend it for anyone who would like to impress guests.

This turned out just great for my dinner party and everyone raved. Freezing the tofu worked great, I would not suggest skipping this step because it really made the difference.
