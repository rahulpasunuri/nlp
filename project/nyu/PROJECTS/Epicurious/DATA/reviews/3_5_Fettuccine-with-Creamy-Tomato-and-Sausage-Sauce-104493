Delicious! Added freshly chopped basil and a few dashes of oregano since I didn't have sage on hand. I also blended the diced tomatoes into a smooth consistency, which I thought made it into a more of a cream sauce.

Delicious and so easy to make! My 7year old son and I made this together for our Masterchef night here at home. We left out the chili as we knew our sausage had a bit of 'heat' in it. We added a good amount of freshly grated Parmesan on top as we served it. yum!! We will make it again and again!

One of our all-time favorites. We make it with penne because the sauce/pasta distribute more evenly. We often get requests to make this dish. Am visiting family now and they insist on having it this week.

Last made this recipe in April,2001. It was delicious then, and the same now. Our version was rather spicy, probably due to the seasonings, supposedly mild, in the Italian Sausage. Rather an inexact science. Mushrooms and broccoli, as suggested by others, would seem okay. esp. the mushrooms. This recipe should be in our annual, at least, rotation. Not our decade rotation. So many recipes, so little time!

I made this one tonight & the kids loved it. Personally, I found that although I did use diced tomatoes "with Italian Seasoning" & the sage, it seemed slightly boring. Although I will likely make it again sometime, I'd suggest tossing in a some fresh basil and oregano for the last 5 minutes of cooking.. -SB http://twiturm.com/subbeat

OMG, this is so good, and so easy. I usually follow the recipes as they are, cuz, you know, that's what they are there for. my only change was I had a duck/bacon/jalipano sausage that I had to cook up. This stuff was crazy rich, but it was perfect for this sauce. Will make it again, with some sweet spicy chicken italian sausage. I also garnished it with some basil, and parsley, so yummy.

I made this recipe again, this time using half and half instead of cream. Big mistake -- stick to the cream.

Delicious and easy! I used sweet turkey italian sausage, and substituted penne pasta for the fettuccine and 2 Tbs minced fresh sage for the dried sage. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I have served this dish for friends and family on multiple occasions, always to rave reviews. Because the recipe is so simple, splurge on quality ingredients (e.g., fresh homemade pasta) since they come through so nicely. The great thing about the recipe is that it's rich (but not too rich) and super simple to make, so you're not stuck in the kitchen while you are entertaining.

I love this recipe and have been making it since 2000! I double the recipe using a pound each of sweet and hot Italian turkey sausage. I add a tablespoon of Trader Joes Italian seasoning (when on hand). Serve it in a big white ceramic pasta bowl for a family-style Italian dinner.

Made this exactly as written (which I rarely do on Epicurious). Fattening for sure, but yummy. Next time I'll probably use 1/2 and 1/2 or instead of full fat cream and mushrooms too. Guests had seconds.

This is my favorite recipe for special/romantic dinners. I use the full pound of sausage and have even used sweet italian style venison sausage with great results. I always increase the spices on my recipes a little and this one is no exception. Other than that, I follow this recipe exactly. I like to shave my parmesan cheese over the dish instead of grating it, very pretty!

Rating: 4
Wow, this is my favorite Epicurious recipe ever. It was SO delicious. We served it for friends last night, and everyone raved about it and had seconds. I couldn't believe how yummy it was! OK, here are a few modifications I made: Used two shallots, mild instead of sweet Italian sausage, 1/2 cup whipping cream, 1/2 cup milk, unseasoned canned tomatoes. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of herbs de provence and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano. I also subsitituted 3 large fresh basil leaves for the sage.I sauteed 4 crimini mushrooms and added them to the sauce at the end. I served it over paparadelle pasta, because TJ's only had whole wheat fettucine. I was hesitant about using a pound of sausage since other reviewers said it was too much, but we thought it was just right!

Rating: 4
Excellent! The only changes I made were to saute the sausage and drain it on paper towels before adding it to the shallot and garlic. I substituted Greek yogurt (full fat) for the cream, greatly reducing the fat content, stirring it on off the heat at the last minute. Wonderful good! I agree with the reviewer who suggested cutting back on the sausage. Half a pound would do it.

This was very simple and good. I did use less sausage than called for (about 1/2 a pound) and served it over penne insead of fettuccine.

This was a very nic emeal. Used half and half and part cream. Also, used home canned tomatoes, so I added some oregano to it. It seem after it sat the richer and thicker it became. Delicious..will make again!!

Meh, this was good but not great. A little too rich. I added sun-dried tomatoes and held the sausage (trying to cut back on red meat). Eventually added more tomatoes to balance the rich cream. The end result was good, but could be better. The recipe is still better than sex in Edmond, OK, apparently. [Yet another reason to be thankful I don't live in a place like Oklahoma.]

A nice weekday dinner recipe. Substituted red onion for the shallot. Used turkey sausage and substituted fatfree half-and-half to reduce calories and fat. Worked beautifully. Add the fatfree 1/2 and 1/2 last and cook just until heated through so it does not clump and/or become stringy.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish for company many times and everyone always loves it. It is very rich, but such wonderful comfort food for a cold winters night. The only change that I make is to drain off some of the grease after cooking the sausage. It's still wonderful without it and a little less guilt for me.

This is a great basic dish that is worthy of most occasions. Made it exactly as the recipe calls for and found there to be plenty of sauce. You could easily make this less fattening with turkey sausage and non-fat half and half. This is definitely a keeper.

This is a fantastic, simple meal that has become an old standby in our house. I use spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet, half and half instead of whipping cream, and I saute a large diced sweet onion at the same time as the garlic and shallots--fabulous! Even my toddler loves this meal!

This is a fantastic recipe - I have made some minor tweaks (such as using a nice penne pasta, turkey sausage, adding a bit of red wine, fat free 1/2 and 1/2) nothing too far off the orginal recipe. It always turns out great and the family and friends love it.

I meant to say that I used 1/2 lb. Sweet Italian Sausage (not Peppers). P.S. The meat is so good you can eat it as a sandwich with Italian Bread and Fresh Mozzarella. Yummy!

Rating: 3
I tailored the recipe by using 1/2 lb. of Sweet Italian Peppers and 1/2 lb. of Ground Beef (only cause that's what I had defrosted) and it still tastes really good. I didn't have fresh Basil so I used fresh Cilantro. I let the sauce thicken as well. I enjoyed it and will definately make it again. I too waited more than 15 min for the sauce to thicken but it was worth it and the meat was still juicy, not dry.

Rating: 4
I have made this many times for family and friends, and it always gets rave reviews. A variation that I have been using recently is to use frozen gnocchi from the supermarket instead of the fettuccine. It is quicker and easier and works wonderfully with this creamy sauce. Once it's cooked just plate it and pour the sauce over. (I have a friend that requests this particular dish on special occasions.) I agree with previous reviewers...restaurant quality at home! This is by far my favorite recipe from this site, and I have MANY wonderful recipes from epicurious. If you haven't tried this yet, do so without hesitation!

This was a delicious basic recipe. Added some fresh basil and simmered the tomato sauce for about 30 mins before adding the cream. This made it a thick, rich sauce. Added a few mushrooms as well. Very easy.

I thought this was a good, fast recipe. I used spicy sausages instead of sweet, and added a diced green pepper (for color and a hint of nutrients). Like other reviews have stated, it takes more than 15 minutes to thicken (which is important to note so you can time your noodles to finish at the same time); for me it was about 20 minutes. It's relatively quick for a pasta, requires only a few simple steps so even the most novice cook can make it, and even reheats well in the microwave. Plus, it's darn tasty! In my book simple+great tasting=4 forks. I rated it a 3 because my boyfriend didn't like it as much as I did so I guess it's not for everyone, but I still give it an enthusiastic thumbs up.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I added fresh parsley, basil, oregano, and garlic just because I can't imagine making sauce without fresh ingredients. Also the sauce came out a little thin possibly because I added a few extra ounces of chopped tomatoes, nothing a little tomato paste didn't remedy.

Yummy! I used fres rotini pasta and crushed tomatoes (that is what I had), added a bit of basil and oregano, I also used 1/2 spicy and 1/2 mild italian sausage. I think the chopped tomatoes would be better in terms of adding texture. Otherwise, we loved it. The flavors are great and it is so easy. I'm going to try something more low fat next time (half and half maybe?).

Not much to add to all the other reviews. My can of tomatoes was unseasoned so added some oregano, basil, marjoram,thyme and rosemary. Used fresh sage and some green pepper as they were in the house. Then tossed the whole thing over some penne (personal choice). We enjoyed it and will do it again.

Terrific. Tasty, rich, great in winter. I used half and half instead of cream and fresh sage, penne rigate instead of fettuccine. I prefer the penne for a chunky sauce such as this. I wish I had taken one previous reviewer's suggestion of draining the excess grease after cooking the sausage, as it was slightly fattier than I would have liked. Substituting turkey sausage for the pork would have solved this problem as well, which what I'll likely use the next time I make this.

This is now our favorite homemade pasta sauce. It's so quick and easy! I also added zucchini and used gourmet fat-free half and half after reading another reviewer's comments, and both worked wonderfully. Next time I might add more veggies for color.

This was an excellent, very easy and flexible recipe. It is guest-worthy, particularly in light of the simplicity. Flexible but - don't substitue the cream. I "souped" it up the second time I made it by adding a half of minced red onion and two tablespoons of chopped fresh basil. Mushrooms might go in next time....

This dish is absolutely delicious! And easy to make, too. I substituted rigatoni for the fettuccine, and it worked out just fine. I liked the big, tubular pasta to grab on to all the sausage and tomatoes.

This was a wonderful and easy dish. Because of all the cream, I wouldn't make it everyday, but a real treat. Possibly feeling guilty for all of the cream in the recipe, I only used about a half-pound of sausage and it was plenty. I'll definitely make this again.

Rating: 2
This was an interesting recipe. It was certainly creamy and aromatic but I suggest using less sage. 1 tbsp is way too much. Perhaps half would do. Also I added more dry red pepper for extra spice and I also suggest adding some more vegitables such as green and red pepper and maybe some zuccini, salt and pepper. With these changes this recipe is sure to please.

God bless the fat-free cream reviewer! My husband and I made this dish using 2 tsp of oil, fat-free half&half and fresh rosemary instead of sage. DE-licious!!!! It was perfect with the garlic bread recipe from this site and an Italian salad. Very easy and sooo tasty! I'm making it again tonight.

Rating: 4
I always try to lower the fat in a recipe as long as it does not sacrifice taste. Used sweet turkey sausage and 1 tsp. of oil. Used only 1/4 cup of heavy cream and fresh sage instead of dried. It was so creamy and delicious, great combination of flavors. I couldn't imagine how overly rich it would have been with a whole cup of heavy cream. Seems a bit excessive. There was plenty sauce from the tomatoes, especially if you leave it covered when simmering.

Rating: 3
Don't despair over the inclusion of whipping cream! Fat free half and half works very well in this and any other recipe calling for whipping cream. The BEST substitute I've found is "Gourmet Fat Free Half and Half" by Land O' Lakes. It is ultra pasteurized and has the real dairy symbol on the label(nothing artificial added, they just remove the fatty oil). I live in Florida and this product is readily available in the dairy aisle at Publix Supermarkets, Albertsons and Winn Dixie. It takes the guilt out of Penne ala Vodka, too!

This truly was a great pasta dish, pretty simple to make and lots of flavor. I made this for Valentines day, it was perfect with some salad, wine and candlelight.One thing, you'll definately want to drain the grease once you cook the sausage. This is something I will be making again soon. Yum!

This dish was very good and easy to make. I too used turkey sausage instead, only cuz they ran out of the pork sausage in the store, I thought it would make a difference in the taste, but it didn't, I substituted onions for the shallots, and added more red pepper. I also tried rosemary instead of the sage. All of these substitutes were done only because thats what I had available!!! Not that I wanted to change the recipe in any way!

This dish was very easy to prepare. We attempted to cut calories by using turkey sausage and half-and-half instead of the regular sausage and cream. We also cut out the sage and used italian seasoning. The dish came out well. It was cheap too which is nice for a quiet evening in. My girlfriend added a bit too much red pepper flakes, but if you like spicy, that wouldn't be a problem. This dish goes well with a large bottle of chianti, lots of candlelight and good conversation.

This is a recipe I make frequently. It is a great comforting dish and quite inexpensive as well. There are some nice variations such as adding cubed chicken breast (goes nicely with sweet sausage) and I most often garnish with freshly torn basil which gives it a nice fresh taste.

I have tried many recipes off of this website and have been very pleased with most. This is the only one I have chosen to review, however, as it is the absolute best one I have tried! I made it pretty much to the exact parameters, except I added a green pepper for flavor and color. If you like bold and spicy....this is for you! I used bowtie pasta and it was perfect for this sauce. I, also, didn't add the reserved liquid the recipe recommends, and let it simmer for close to 30 minutes. The consistency was perfect!

I have made this recipe many times for family and friends - the response is always the same...rave reviews! It is now my most frequently requested recipe. I tried this with the already prepared gnocchi from the grocery store's frozen food section, and I think it tastes even BETTER! My advice to anyone trying it for the first time would be to make sure that you drain the fat after cooking the sausage or your sauce will be too greasy. Also, it is better to use less than 1 lb. of Italian sausage than to go over. This is a great recipe! If you haven't tried it yet, do yourself and your guests a favor and serve it soon!

Turned out fine. I agree with rater who substituted onions for the shallots. Also, be sure to let sauce simmer for the flavors to meld - it tasted quite different - and much better - after 20 minutes on low heat.

This is a delicious new recipe to add to our dinner menu. I added mushrooms and green bell pepper, also 1/2 cup of monterey jack cheese just cuz I had it. Doesn't mix well with fettuccine, when I make it again I'll probably use bowtie pasta. I used hot italian sausage and put too much crushed red pepper...got a little too happy with that stuff. Next time I'll just put a sprinkle of it.

I have made this pasta about ten times since I first found it on this web-site and it has been loved by everyone I have served it to. It is easy to prepare and I have made the sauce a day before and reheated it while the pasta is being cooked. It may not be the most attractive looking sauce I have made but it is definitely one of our favorites. Serve a colorful salad with it to brighten up the table.P.S. I use hot Italian sausage, bow-tie pasta and only 2 teaspoons of ground sage.

This dish was great. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and found that, for kids, it's a little on the spicy side. Next time I would use 1/4 tsp. of the crushed red pepper. I also simmered my sauce with a lid on so that it wouldn't evaporate. That way, I didn't have to add the pasta cooking water to it.

This was very easy and delicious. It made a very large portion-plenty of leftovers after feeding four of us. I used hot sausage which may have been a little too spicy-I'll try the sweet next time. This would be a great "Superbowl Sunday" type of meal to serve-very filling and warm! I substituted about 1/4 cup skim milk added to 3/4 cup cream.

For those concerned about the grease and fat,I made this with Italian turkey sausage and condensed skim milk instead of cream, and it tasted great.

This is a great recipe. It is easy and everyone (children included) loves it. The leftovers are great, too. I have made this several times with ravoli and it tastes great that way, too.

I have rated this recipe 3 times, I still drool thinking about it, It is easy, fast and an absoute delight. I agree you can skip the olive oil, but do not shy away from the cream or extra parmesan. Best results have come from using hot sausage and and equal mix of hamburger, drain well (it helps the guilt) as well as penne, or bowties.

Quick, easy and fantastic! My son is a pasta lover but doesn't care too much for cream-based sauces... he couldn't get enough and can't wait for me to make it again (I had to stop him from eating the sauce from the pan before I could combine it with the pasta!). Definately a new addition to our regular menu.

Rating: 2
I made this yesterday, with the only change being a substitution for the shallots. I had a vidalia onion, and was too lazy to go get shallots! It was quite good, but I felt like the sauce remained too runny. Perhaps I should have cooked longer, but..... I certainly did not need to add any retained cooking water! Everyone ate it up, however. I think I'll try the penne recipe next, just to see if the wine cuts some of the heavy slightly greasy texture. I also like the idea of the previous reviewer, who did the sausage first, and then added the shallots and garlic, in order to save adding oil, but I wonder if I'd lose the wonderful flavor of really good olive oil?

My husband loves this recipe. It is heavier than the foods we usually eat, but it is wonderful for an occasional winter meal.

It also reheats well for a work-day lunch.

This was excellent. Very easy and very tasty. The quality of the sausage is critical to the recipe. Anyone that said it was bland may want to try another brand of Italian sausage. I get mine at a local meat market and it is fresh. This definitely is not bland if you get the right ingredients. I like it with bowtie pasta.

Rating: 3
I found this dish easy to make, and it tasted good even though I used half the olive oil, drained and pressed the fat from the cooked sausage and used 1/2&1/2. I've had similar sauces at restaurants, but the fat content was too high for my system to tolerate a larger portion. (Gall bladder - eeww.)

To some of the other reviewers - one question...When did simplicity become a sin? This is an easy pasta recipe that tastes great. Isn't that what we all love about good pasta dishes? As long as I have garlic, pasta, whipping cream, tomatoes (canned or fresh), and a premium parmesan, I can throw this sauce together with a choice of meat and/or fresh veggies and have a great meal that everyone in my family enjoys.

Made this recipe the day I received the issue, and it's been fairly common on our table since. Gotta add my own touches: I've never used fettuccine; I find penne or rigatoni work really well with it, and I usually get a hot Italian sausage and skip the red pepper flakes.

My husband gave this 4 forks but it didn't seem fair because I changed it so much: browned 1/2 lb. of sweet turkey sausage w/ 1/2 lb. of hot; added 1 whole Vidalia onion; added 1 can tomato paste; 2 cans stewed Italian tomatoes and allowed the whole thing to simmer; added some red wine and again allowed it to simmer (1 hr.); added 1 cup half and half and 1 cup defrosted frozen peas. Served with penne. Not really the same recipe but DELICIOUS anyway. Not much effort for a great dinner.

This tastes very similar to the Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage recipe, the advantage to this being that it doesn't contain wine, something I don't always have on hand. I'll probably make the penne recipe when wine is available, and this one when it isn't. I used hot sausage rather than sweet, and an extra small clove of garlic; otherwise, no changes. Very good and tasty.

Oil, sausage, cream and cheese??? Another recipe that sounds wonderful, but I'm afraid if I served it to my family and/or friends, I'd be arrested for attempted death by overindulgence. I don't understand how anyone can eat like this, even if their doctor has not told them that they have high cholesteral (sorry, I can't spell that word). Oh well, thanks for listening; I just had to get that off my chest. Understand, I love cream. I just don't buy it because I'm afraid I'd drink it straight from the carton!!!

A very tasty (but rather unhealthy)pasta dish. I liked a previous reviewer's suggestion to substitute turkey sausage, and will try it the next time. Also, I used fresh sage instead of dried (why use dry herbs if fresh are available?). Finally, I like spicy food and doubled the amount of red pepper - this was a mistake, as the pepper overpowered the dish. Will use the amount called for the next time.

I made this dish last night and my husband not only had 4 helpings then but another this morning. He has never been a real sausage lover but loved this dish! I would recommend it to anyone. I lowered the fat by using half-n-half instead of whipping cream and it turned out perfect! I also ommited the salt and pepper because my sausage gave perfect flavor! I served it with a fresh mozzerella/tomato salad ( olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, italian seasoning) for appetizer, an Italian salad, Semolini Bread, and a great Red wine! NOW THAT'S ITALIAN!

Judging from all the rave reviews, the quality must depend on the sausage. I bought supertarget sausage (hot it.) and it was awful. I really think I need to move somewhere where they have good sausage. It was darn near inedible. I have made this with pepperoni with wonderful results ( well, it is a similar recipe from 10 years or so ago). Is there a commercial brand of sausage that someone could recommend?

I followed the recipe as written and the results were excellent. I could not agree more with the reviewer who stated that the quality of the sausage was key. I bought our sausage from Johnny's Meat Market on Hertel Avenue, Buffalo, NY and it was truly the best sausage I have ever had. While my cholesteral level topped 320 after this meal, with a few hours on the stair master, I would definitely make this again.

I thought this was very easy and delicious. I added mushrooms after the sausage was browned and sauteed for a minute. I also used hot sausage and found it very flavorful and not too spicy. I used spinach fettuccine and thought this would also be good with penne or rigatoni. I also had to cook this a little longer to thicken the sauce. Tastes great the next day as the flavors meld--great for re-heating.

I thought this was a very good pasta dish. Tastes like something you'd order out. My whole family kept eating and eating! Even my 3 and 1 yr. olds! I "mopped" up extra grease in pan with paper towels after browning the sausage, and did not find the sauce greasy at all. Try it!

This dish was fantastic. I loved it. A tip for those who don't like to use so much whipping cream in their sauces. I used evaporated milk (NOT condensed) and then just a little cream, maybe 1/4 cup. The evaporated milk is much less fattening, you can even buy fat free. I loved this dish I will surely make it again.

My family found this to be a simple, delicious dinner that was simple and easy to prepare. We made the change to 2/3 sweet sausage and 1/3 hot sausage and omitted the red pepper for the sake of the kids. This gave great flavour without being overwhelming. We did drain the sausage before continuing with the cream. Being sure to simmer the cream and sausage at least 5 minutes keeps it from getting too runny later.

I have tried this twice, the first time I made it straight from the recipe (with some added tomato sauce) and it was excellent, a keeper. The second time I made it "light" with f.f. half and half and turkey sausage - it was ok, not nearly as good as the full-fat recipe.

I gave this 2 forks because we "I liked it but didn't love it". It has good flavor, not great and the sauce was a little thin. There are recipes that are better. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage - drained of fat, a combo of 1/2 & 1/2 and evap skim, and used fresh basil instead of sage. I also added extra garlic. If I do try it again it will be with the sage which just doesn't sound right to me but so many people raved about it.

Hey, what's with Bruce? I usually browse the recipes by sections and read the reviews of ones that sound good. Since I like to talk about food and exchange ideas, I was thrilled to find the constant comment section. It is a shortcut to food socializing. Bruce, if you don't like constant comment, why do you keep coming back? (that's a hint). There is no conspiracy here to manipulate our recipe choices. Most of us recipe addicts have many sources for the recipes we try, but using well reviewed recipes for a special dinner party helps avert recipe disasters.

At the risk of adding fuel to the cynics, I too thought this was great. I made it using Smart Choice Sweet Italian Sausage links, and was pleasantly suprised with the outcome. Even though I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat very many tofu/soy-based products, and had never tried this product. It turned out wonderfully, though, and even my husband liked it, who is generally quite picky and skeptical when it comes to meat-wannabes. I would definitely save my calories and fat by going this route, though, instead of substituting half and half as Mesa, AZ did. In order to appropriate balance the acidity of the tomatoes, heavy cream really is needed, and the balance between the two is just perfect - rich and flavorful, but not too heavy. Definitely a keeper.

I wasn't thrilled with this dish at all. I can't understand where all the rave reviews came from! The only thing I did differently was I used half and half instead of the cream, then at the end I added a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken it up a bit. I didn't like the sage in this recipe; didn't do a thing for me! My husband seemed to like it though. I won't be making it again - next time I'll try the other pasta/sausage/cream sauce recipe and hopefully with better results.

I made a very tasty cholesterol-free and nearly nonfat version of this using 1 T. olive oil, one 12-oz. package of Yves Italian veggie ground round, and fat-free half and half. My husband, who's really more of a breakfast guy than a dinner guy, had two and a half servings. It really isn't very pretty, though!

This was delicious and easy! I did however make a few changes, I used evaporated milk which I had on hand, added fresh sliced mushrooms and six cloves of garlic. It was a little to runny so I added 2 Tablespoon of cornstarch + 2 Tablespoons of water. Plus I cooked the sausages seperately and drained the fat off before adding it to the sauce. Will be making this again!

This is in essence the first non-instant food item I have ever cooked. It was completely awesome! I made it for a group of 6 and everyone loved it. Since then, I have made it again and again, and I would recommend it with regular whipping cream instead of heavy, but whatever you end up using, you won't regret it!

Rating: 3
Tasty and simple: i made the following changes to lighten it up a bit, even though they added a little cooking time. After sauteeing sausage, drain the fat and return meat to pay. Add 1/2 cup dry red wine of the same type you intend to drink with the meal; scrape the fond off the bottom of the pan and let the wine evaporate entirely. Add the tomatoes and 1/2 cup of unsalted chicken stock next and simmer about 15 minutes; then finish with about 1/4 cup cream to keep it much lighter. Use penne, ziti, or farfalle since the sauce will not be as creamy as the recipe indicates and fettucine will just soak it all up.

I would say that this is one of the easiest and the most delicious pasta recipes that I have made. Since I didn't have any heavy cream, I used half-and-half instead and used a bit of flour to thicken the sauce. It worked fine. Very, very good.

Substituted penne pasta (one pound) and combined it the the sauce mixture. Served it in pasta bowls with plenty of freshly shredded parmesan cheese to pass. Will go into my permanent recipe file. Next time I'll make the sauce ahead of time - another great bonus.

We thought that this dish was great. I used sweet turkey sausage and lowfat evaporated milk and thought it was plenty rich! I might add more garlic next time!

I made this dish the other night, I didn't have fettucini noodles so I used penne. It turned out great. My picky 9 year old had three helping! My husband and I fought over the leftovers the next day. Great dish to make for an informal party.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written and it was so heavy and greasy I had to skim the top. I much prefer the penne pasta, sausage and tomato cream sauce recipe. If I had to do it again, I would fry the sausage first and drain it, then put in the olive oil, onion and garlic. After they cooked, I would add the sausage. Perhaps it was the kind of diced tomatoes I used. Can anyone suggest a good brand? And it did look like dog food!

Looked like dog food, but taste was okay, not great! I would never serve this to company.

I, too, used different pasta for this dish. Campanelle worked great. I suggest using very good grade sausage. My husband also suggested leaving the crushed red pepper out.

A wonderful and different pasta dish - not a lot of ingredients, but tons of flavor. Instead of sweet sausage, I used hot which gave it a better spice.

I liked this recipe a lot. I prefer it over the other penne with sausage on the constant comment list. I made the lower fat version with the ff half and half and turkey sausage. I used half hot and half sweet sausage and I thought the sage really gave it a great taste. Don't worry about adding a whole tbsn. My husband wasn't thrilled with it, he would have preferred heavy cream in it, but I prefer it lighter, in fact, I think it would have been really heavy otherwise. I will make this again, and I might try it with the cream in the future just to see what it's like and make my husband happy. So easy and with salad and bread it's a great dinner!

Had this at a friends house -otherwise all my instincts as a cook would have screamed at me not to add all the sage;absolutely loved it & couldn't believe the fab flavors.I agree that it can be fat-modified & will do so when I make it, which will be very soon.Also not being a fan of big tomato chunks, will whir them up a bit with my hand blender.

I made this dish last night and it was good, but not amazing. I would probably make it again because it takes no time at all. But for those of you looking for a truly amazing sauce, check out the recipe for CHICKEN BREASTS WITH SUN-DRIED TOMATO-CREAM SAUCE. This would be great for pasta.

I'm a caterer, and just when I thought all great food required hard work, I found this recipe! This is a wonderful dish. Great flavors seem to defy how simple it is to make. I made the full-fat version and loved it, but next time will try the low-fat version just to experiment. YUM!

Rating: 2
My husband thought this was very good; I'm not that certain. When I make this again, I won't add as much crushed red pepper. It was way too spicy, and I used sweet sausage and less red pepper flakes than called for. Also, I used less sage, and next time would only use 1 t. All in all, it was fine, not wonderful.

Rating: 2
After reading the reviews, I thought this would be great. However, I made it tonight and would call it only OK...and totally not worth the fat and calories. I may try the lower fat version suggested (ff half & half and turkey sausage) in the future, but I won't make it as-is again.

I REALLY enjoyed this recipie. I followed the 1/2 and 1/2 suggestion and instead of 1 lb sausages, I added 1/2 lb Sweet Italian (Lean) Turkey Sausage and 1/2 lb Cremini Mushrooms. I has to thicken the sauce with a little flour and water, but it tasted wonderfully!

Our family loved my low fat version of this recipe - I used Land O Lakes no fat half and half, Turkey Sweet Italian Sausage, and only half the oil. Definitely a keeper!

Check it out, y'all, this rezipe is DA BOMB! I'm talking the big one; Dresden, Fat Man and Little Boy all rolled into one. Taste the sweet sweet Eye-talian sausage melt in yo mouth! I made this for my lady, Gina and she went and loved it. Then we went and loved it, ya know! Yeah! This kicks the stuffing out of some whack bacon and egg sandwich. And, it's 100% AMERICAN! Peace in the Paullenium!

I thought this dish had a really good flavor. As a previous reviewer suggested, I also used penne instead of fettuccini. Excellent. Will definitely make again.

A great and EASY pasta dish. I added some mushrooms that I had on hand, and will definitely do that again. The sage does not overpower the dish; do not skimp. I have a sage plant in my herb garden and may try adding some fresh sage next time.

Thank goodness, the egg sandwich is finally moving down the list. Enough! This dish was WONDERFUL. I loved the sage. I was concerned about it over powering the dish. It did not. I will make this often.

This was a great weeknight meal. I would cook the sausage first, however, and then drain it. Otherwise the dish is too oily. Also, I used half the amount of cream and it was still delicious.

I also tried it with shrimp. This was an excellent choice. The sauce is light enough to support seafood as well as heavier, stronger flavored meats. Will try it with sausage or even ham next time. Serve with steamed asparagus and a nice White Zinfandel or Pinot Noir.

Excellent! I'm always looking for new, easy pasta dishes to make for dinner and this ranks right up there with my mom's awesome spaghetti sauce. I cooked the sausage first then added the onions and then some garlic. Took the advice of a reviewer and used Land O lakes fat free half and half, cutting the amount of cream in half. Added some red bell pepper and frozen peas and had a sauce my bofriend and I couldn't get enough of. Fast, easy, wonderful! Will definitely make this again.

While I didn't think this was bad, it wasn't as good as similar recipes. The only substitution I made was to add half the amount of sage, and I still thought the sage flavor over powered the dish.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and quick. I made a couple substitutions and was quite happy. I added a fresh dried red chili pepper with the sausage, added 1/2 cup halfnhalf and 1/2 cup of cream to cut down on calories and thickness, and added fresh basil instead of sage. I have a similar recipe that I also add a couple Tablespoons of pesto at the end.

This was great! I didn't remove the casing from the sausage (I opted to just slice it up), and I grilled it first to have less grease. It's a keeper!

I tried this dish a few nights ago with a some variations. I tried a spicy sausage and substituted parsley for the sage. I also used a can of crushed tomatoes. My husband and I both really liked the result. I would certainly make this again.

This was a great dish! Very easy and the kids even ate it. I too only added 2 1/2 tsp of sage and it tasted wonderful. I like the idea of adding sauted mushrooms, think that will be the next variation.

This was a very delicious meal. I changed the recipe a bit by using 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 cream and it didn't hurt the taste at all.

I made it TWICE this week for my family. I had my extended family over tonight and even my 14 year old step-brother LOVED it, not to mention, my 22 month old son who doesn't eat much except for Malt balls and Cheerios. I recommend the whipping cream so that the sauce gets nice and thick and draining the meat (especially if you use more than one pound like I did) before adding other ingredients. This is the best dish I've made in a year!

My family loved this recipe. I did thicken the sauce a bit using cornstarch and the pasta water.

An excellent recipe. I sauted the initial ingredients in a wok and then added the fettuccine to the sauce in the wok and tossed everything together there rather than vice versa as the recipe stated. However it is prepared my wife and I would definitly have it again. Having it with wine was an added pleasure!!

This is the same as the Penne with Sausage and Cream, but the latter has wine. The recipe is also listed on Constant Comment and has gotten rave reviews for a long time. I LOVE this recipe and make it often. I use Barilla Belle Flowers (if you can find them), the sausage pieces find their way into the top of the tulips and stay nicely on the fork.

Yummy! This one is a keeper. I have made it several times and it just keeps getting better. I do have to say however, that the cream is way more then is needed. I do fine with 1/2 cup. To make it even lighter I use turkey italian sausage with the casings removed, it is just as good and easier on the thighs. Also, experiment with the pastas a nice tubular pasta like penne really soaks up all the goodies. It is sooo easy, you have got to try it!
