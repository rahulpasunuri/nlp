This recipe was great, also definitely a little time consuming! I would make it again, but probably in smaller batches to freeze for future servings. My notes are as follows: 1) Added chili powder and oregano to MX red sauce. 2) Sub'd jalapeño for red chili flakes 3) Sub'd Mexican 4 cheese blend for Parmesan 4) Used a flour/corn blend for tortillas and just toasted them on gas flame rather than fried them 5) Double all the cheese and garlic!

So good. Finally a good mexican sauce. You won't be able to eat a can of it again.

Great sauce and quick to make. We added extra jalapeno peppers for more fire, but it's delicious as written.

Very good, I used Progresso Basil Tomatos and 4 extra roma tomatos to make 32 oz. I think I would use a little less oil next time, but that's it.
