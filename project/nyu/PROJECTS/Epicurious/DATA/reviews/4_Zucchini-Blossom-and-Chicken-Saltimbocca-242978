Made this last night and it was delicious. Chicken stayed really tender. Proscuitto sometimes gets discolored and hard when you cook it but that didn't happen here. The squash blossoms were really mild in flavor. If making again I would omit salting the chicken breasts as the proscuitto really provided enough salt on its own.
