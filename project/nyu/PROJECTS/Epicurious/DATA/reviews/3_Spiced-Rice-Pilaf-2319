simple, easy to make, nice change of pace versus plain rice with butter.

Very aromatic! By itself it is a little bland but the garnishes make a big difference. I would add a bit of salt to the water. Wonderful served with Chicken with Gingered Apricot Sauce (Bon Apetit) or any curried dish.

This dish was better the second day after the spices had time to mingle.

This rice smelled wonderful as it cooked. We did, however, find it bland tasting.
