i cook a great deal & i jump from one type of cuisine to another. i was excited about trying this dish, but left feeling very disappointed. i would not recommend it again. i served it to a very receptive group of family & no one was crazy about it. can't win `em all!

This recipe was very good. The only thing I noticed is that the tamarind and the shrimp were overpowering in the flavor. The next day, however, when I reheated it the flavors had combined much better. Next time I would let the mixture sit for awhile to let the flavors combine. A second alternative would be to use less tamarind and use fresh shrimp, instead of dried, whose flavor is not so strong. I was amazed at how easy it was to make, although a bit on the messy side and whew...loads of oil!! We really enjoyed it and I definately will make it again!! :-)
