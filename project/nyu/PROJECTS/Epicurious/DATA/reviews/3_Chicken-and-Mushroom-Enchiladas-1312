These are OK enchiladas. I make them now and then with leftover chicken because they are super easy. Even my toddler will eat them.

In an attempt to make Southwestern and Tex-Mex dishes more accessible to my Canadian husband ("What's the difference between a burrito and an enchilada again?"), we have started cooking these dishes actually using recipes. Corn tortillas are traditional - a MUST when making enchiladas. Flour tortillas just don't have the right texture or flavor for this dish. As other reviewers have noted, this is a good base recipe that needs a lot of customization. Start with pulled chicken cooked with cilantro, onions, white pepper, garlic, and a little cumin. Softer, shredded chicken works a lot better than chopped or cubed chicken. With green chiles and tomatillo sauce, I like to top mine with avocado slices and jack cheese. With red sauce, the original recipe's cheddar is good, but reserve the sour cream to serve on the side. Layering rather than rolling is a good way to make sure these are still good left over - the dish becomes more dense and casserole-like when refrigerated overnight. If you prefer them rolled, wrap your tortillas in a damp kitchen towel and microwave 'em for a few seconds to soften instead of messily dipping, then filling.

A trick I learned from a Mexican neighbor--layer the ingredients in 2-3 layers in the pan, ending with sauce and cheese. Same taste, but skips the work of rolling the tortillas. Because this trick makes them SO simple, enchiladas are something I make often instead of only sometimes.

I make enchiladas often and I love mushrooms so thought this would be terrific, but found it really sort of bland.

I took the green sauce and added one jar of chicken gravy to it, That took the edge off the sauce and added a chicken flavor to the tortillas. I also grilled yellow sweet onions with the mushroome. Came out great.

I liked the flavor of this filling a lot, but felt that the recipe had too many steps. To simplify things (and to add some flavor) I poached chicken breasts in broth with 1 bay leaf, 1 chipotle and 1 jalepeno. In a seperate pan, I sauteed the mushrooms with some onions and a dash of lime juice. i combined the chicken, the mushrooms and a package of chopped frozen spinach to a bowl and then added the sour cream to incorporate everything. This made assembly easier. I had trouble with my tortillas falling apart after dipping them in the enchilda sauce, so I did the more traditional quick-fry-in-hot-oil to soften them up and keep them from breaking.

Dish was yum. But, flavour was too reliant on high fat cream and cheese. Like a reviewer before I sauted my mushrooms and chicken together with some cilantro, garlic and hot peppers to season them up. The second time I made it I left out the sour cream, used scant cheese and just garnished with avocado slices which are both yummy and a healthier fat.

Good weekday recipe. I followed except used portabello mushrooms and added carmelized onions and omitted grn. chilis as my husband doesn't like. I wish there was a substitute for enchilada sauce, I don't really care for the taste of it - any suggestions?

I made this recipe as it was written and definitely found it bland. I would check other enchilada recipes or use some of the previous suggestions - and add cumin, garlic and onions if you do decide to try this.

Good base recipe, but I omitted the canned enchilada sauce and added chicken broth and jalepenos to the sour cream. I also sauteed onions and garlic with the mushrooms. Great filling dish, very easy, reheats well.

Very tasty and easy. I didn't get the same yield as the recipe, but possibly I sauteed the mushrooms too long. I put a little extra cheese on top and would do so again.

Yackety yack....TOO bland to start out. Here's my changes: 1 onion, 2-3 cloves garlic, 3/4 tbsp cumin, 8 oz white mushrooms, 4 cups spinach, and 3 diced jalapenos. Saute all but jalapenos and throw in chicken to simmer. If you use just breast then dice chicken small to ease enchilada stuffing. Mi perro es muy macho. Adios.

The only change I made was to add white onion and minced garlic along with the mushrooms when I sauteed them. It was delicious and very easy, I will be making this again!!

A tasty recipe, with changes others have suggested, including the addition of onion, garlic and cumin to the mushroom saute. I used red sauce, because I couldn't get green sauce, and I wasn't sure if dipping the tortillas in the sauce meant getting sauce on one or both sides of each tortilla. I got sauce on both sides of the first tortilla, but then spreading sour cream evenly down the center over the sauce coated tortilla was a messy achievement. I only put sauce on one side of the tortilla for the rest (that turned out to be the outside of each enchilada). Finally, I ended up using more cheese and extra sauce.

First time enchilada maker and this is a great recipe to start with. Good basic recipe, but next time I would consider adding another vegetable, maybe onions. It was an especially big hit with my roomate Dan. He likeee.

This is an excellent enchilada dish. Try it with grilled chicken breast meat, jalapenos, lots of sour cream and hot red enchilada sauce. Makes great leftovers. Definately number one on my list of southwestern dishes!

Really good! Since I was making a batch of tomato sauce for pasta earlier in the day, I cooked the chicken (thighs) in the sauce. The result was moist and flavorful chicken. I used plain yogurt (and more of it than called for) instead of the sour cream. Halfway through the baking I noticed that the enchiladas were looking dry and I had used all of the enchilada sauce, so I spooned some of the sauce I cooked the chicken in over them. It was surprisingly good. And now, I have a sauce (flavored by the chicken) to serve over pasta for another meal.

I loved this. I used the red enchilada sauce this time, but am going to try the green next time. I also added onions while sauteeing the mushrooms. I noticed that some people used canned chicken - I think you'd like it better if you used fresh (lightly seasoned).

Rating: 3
This is an easy 'base' recipe...meaning that I too made a lot of changes (used pepperjack cheese, used preseasoned fajita chicken, used extra sauce). One addional helpful hint - my corn tortillas were breaking up a bit when folded. I found if I microwaved for 15 seconds first, the tortillas were softened and much easier to roll. They stayed together in the oven.

This was simple and delicious. It comes together in a jiffy for a busy weeknight. I did add extra cheddar cheese and some mild salsa (from a jar) over the top during baking. This kept the tortillas from getting too dried out. I also had to cook it for about 40 minutes to get it heated thoroughly. I think the recipe would be especially good with fajita-seasoned chicken!

I made this without the mushrooms and I added cheddar to the top of the dish to bake. It was great and by doubling it, we ate in for several nights and it kept getting better.

I thought these were pretty good but not outstanding. Recipe didn't specify, so I used green enchilada sauce and added a little more cheese on top. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to making because it definitely could have used more "spice" inside. Next time I will add cumin, garlic, and cayenne to punch it up a little.

I used Swanson canned chicken.3 large cans chopped it up. Used two cans of green chilis and flour and corn tortillas.Mixed the cummin,pepper,garlic salt and green chilis with the chicken. No mushrooms. I like them but not with this. Used two cans of sauce. Still could have used a touch more. Tasted pretty good. Very easy to do for a quick week night dinner.

Very good I use it as a staple in my southwestern recipe collection. I like it saucier than recipe calls for so I used the salsa recipe from this site to cover the top, and hot enchilada sauce!!! Yummmmy

This is one of my favorite things to cook, because there are so many ways to tweak it. My boyfriend isn't a mushroom fan so when I make it for him, I omit the mushrooms and substitute red,yellow and green peppers with red onion. I often use green sauce in lieu of red. A combination of pepper jack, colby and cheddar works nicely, and I layer the cheese in between the other ingredients like I'm making a lasagna. More calories that way but definitely worth it. I also season the chicken with cayenne, white pepper, cumin, a pinch of thyme, and plenty of garlic. It's a little softer when reheated in the oven, but I think it gives the flavors a chance to blend a little more. I usually make up an extra pan's worth to freeze, for a quick weeknight dinner.

I made these exactly as they are written and they turned out well. We even thought they were good the next day for lunch. Next time I'll double the sauce, my preference is a little saucier. And maybe we'll try the green sauce/white cheese combo.

I tried this recipe last night. I followed several suggestions from other reviewers. I added cumin and chili powder 1 tsp each to the chix. I sauted the mushroom in a little butter with 3 cloves of garlic. I used about 2 1/2 c of sauce. Also prefer corn tortillas to flour. I like to add the cheese at the end and on top not in the enchilada. I didn't have any sour cream. So I saved a little on the fat content. Will definately make these again w/sour cream and will use more sauce because they were pretty dry. Great flavor with the additions recipe a winner love the mushrooms in the enchiladas!

We made this recipe using suggestions from other raters adding cumin, garlic and some extra chopped jalepenos to the chicken. We also pulsed the cooked chicken mixture in the processor to make it easier to handle. In addition, we mixed the mushrooms and chopped chilies into the chicken mixture to cut down the preparation time. It is wonderful and we will definately make it again and again. Oh - also used jalepeno jack cheese instead of cheddar! Very yummy!

I added onion and zucchini, and used the green sauce as suggested, and these were pretty good, but not amazing. I thought I'd try one the next day, reheated- Big Mistake. Slimy and yucky. Eat them on day one.

Fast & good Super Bowl 2001 dish. I added the onions, garlic, wine, cumin, & cilantro suggested by others (thanks for the tips!) & served it with the Essential Chopped Tomato-Serrano Salsa to which I added olive oil, cayenne & crushed red pepper as suggested by those raters. One per person was plenty.

This has instantly become one of my repetoire dishes. I only make a handful of dishes "all the time." A BIG change I did make was to substitute GREEN ENCHILADA SAUCE (El Torito's brand, I think) for the STANDARD ENCHILADA SAUCE. It was INCREDIBLE! Oh, and I used full fat sour cream!

Rating: 3
I made this using the suggestions from other folks, adding cumin and garlic. I threw in half a chopped onion to sautee with the mushrooms as well. I forgot to purchase sour cream so I made it without, and it tasted just fine--maybe this is a good lower-fat version if used with low-fat cheese, and less of it. Overall a very good recipe, and simple to make.

I made a few substitutions. I added a clove of garlic to the mushrooms, sprinkled cumin on the chicken when I cooked it, and used jalapenos (albeit accidentally) instead of chiles, and topped the nearly finished dish (in the last 5 minutes of baking time) off with more cheese. It turned out rather yummy.

I thought that these were very tasty and fun too make . I did however take the advice of other reviews , and bought some extra sauce . I also made a couple minor adjustments , I added spinach and substituted Jack for the cheddar .

I will make this one again, but I must admit I did alot of doctoring because the basic recipe is rather bland. I sauted onions and garlic with abit of wine and cumin before adding the mushrooms. I also added cilantro to the chicken. Everyone liked this, I fed seven easily because the enchiladas are pretty large so we cut them in half to serve them.

This recipe was ok, but I have make much better enchiladas. They seemed to be missing something -needed a little more zest as I found them to be a little bland.

Although I might subsitute shredded jack for the sour cream (the sour cream broke in the oven--maybe because I used regular and not low fat), this is a terrific recipe. It's worth the mess I wound up making dipping the tortillas in the enchilada sauce. And I agree--lighten up, Chella. Those of us who have full time jobs and families as well just don't have time to make our own enchilada sauce. Let's not sneer at those of us who take a small shortcut to a tasty dinner.

This is a cop-out. Canned enchilada sauce, indeed! No self respecting Mexican would ever do this. I'll bet the same people who wrote this would also put beans and tomatoes in chili.

This was a tasty dish. Don't know if you need to warm it for the whole 30 minutes as the tortilla started to get a little dried out. But would make this again!
