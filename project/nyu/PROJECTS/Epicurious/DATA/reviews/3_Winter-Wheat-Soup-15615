Really good soup. So simple, so nutritious, so tasty.

As written, quite bland even w/ garlic stock. It improved when I added seasonings & chopped fresh greens (mustard & kale) & omitted the cilantro. I think Debora Madison does a better job w/ vegetarian soups. Will make again with substitutions because I like wheat berries and the other veggies.

My husband is a vegetarian and he loved this soup. We ate it for several days and it got better the longer it was in the fridge. I added a small pinch of white pepper and used smelt with lots of clantro. I also used 4 cans of chicken stock and 5 cups of water with 3 crushed garlic cloves thrown in. The soup has a sweet flavor.

I love the flavors of the vegetables with the heartiness of the wheatberries. And so easy to make!

This soup lends itself to the judicial use of yuou own favorite herbs and seasonings. I would like to see nutritional data printed with all these recipes.

This is a healthy, albeit slightly bland, vegan dish. It would have been better if I had not skimped on the leeks. The soup provided a surprisingly good milieu for the parsnips.
