I made a few changes to "dress up" the muffins a bit. I added 1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger powder, pinch of nutmeg. I used yogurt instead of sour cream and added 1 cup diced apples instead of raisins. I added 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten them a tad. The result is a great lightly sweet, nicely spiced, moist muffin. Perfect for a morning snack. Yum yum!

Nice texture, something a little different, not too sweet. Very good with jam. Could serve with dinner, too.

These were a little disappointing. The muffins were moist and I liked the flavor of the molasses, but over all they were fairly bland. I have made much better muffins and would not bother with these again.
