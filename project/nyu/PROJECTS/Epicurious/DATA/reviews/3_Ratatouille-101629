This is a wholesome, tasty, straightforward dish. We made it with fresh vegetables from our CSA and served it with couscous. Also, we added a teaspoon of marjoram, which we think made the difference in terms of the spices.

For the amount of time it took to prepare for this dish, I would say that it was simply "good". I thought that it was much better the next day after it was settled.

Delicious, but here are the changes I made: 2 garlic cloves added when sauteeing the onion and use only herbs de Provence to taste, plus 1 bay leaf added when vegetables are simmering. In the Provencial kitchen a "pistou" is served as a topping, garlic & parsley & you can even add basil here. I did and totally enjoyed it.

I threw in a handful of Kalamata olives too. Fabulous tastes of the August garden.

I also omitted the bay leaf and added italian seasonings to taste.

I omitted the thyme and peppers. I used 3 each yellow squash and zucchini, 2 large purple eggplants. If I was able to, I would have used 2 white eggplants too. I cooked it till the sauce thickened and then drained some off. My guests loved it.

We loved this recipe! Our first attempt at Ratatouille while living in France after two years! We made the following adjustments: added canned tomatoes (with juice), 1 hot green pepper, some red wine, and bouillon cubes (chicken) to taste. True test is on Monday, making two huge pots of Ratatouille for 4 of our French friends!

I love Rataouille, and enjoy most recipes. Like my neighbor reviewer, I cook the veggies first. I coat the vegetables with olive oil, and then but them on the grill. I used the fresh tomatoes, but I did not peal them. I, too, salted and let the eggplant slices drain for 1/2 hour before cooking. I love this dish served with Couscous.

I thought that this recipe is really easy to make but still with great taste. I am going to make again somtime soon. I highly recommend it.

This was just ok. We ate it, but still have leftovers in the fridge that I am reluctant to touch. It would taste better spiced up a bit, or used as a side dish.

I loved this receipe. It was really easy to make. I didn't have the zucchini to put it thou, so I left it out. I also used some canned tomatoes like some of the previous people said. I put mine over some couscous and it was great.

This was delicious, which surprised me a little because it is so simple. (I have never made ratatouille before). I used whole canned tomatoes as recommended by others. I prepared the eggplant as in the recipe, but cut into bigger chucks. Consistency was just right. Oh, and I used 1 poblano pepper in place of one of the greens. Perfect amount of spice.

i would definetely make again. i'd suggest using canned tomatoes instead of fresh....huge time saver and equally tasty.

I use canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh ones. I also add a hot pepper or two, sometimes a splash of red wine, sometimes a little left over tomato paste. It's hard to ruin this one.

ah Scotland - that warm country on the Mediterranean! I have been making ratatouille for years from recipes from all over and NOT ONE calls for tarragon. This is a very nice recipe - I like to use three colours of pepper to make it visually dazzling.

I used this as the vegetarian alternative for a dinner party for 40 people. Everyone liked it, but I agree with previous comments that things can easily turn to mush. I cooked everything except the eggplant the night before and let it sit in the fridge for the flavors to blend. I also lightly salted the diced eggplant, and put them in the fridge overnight, covered. On the day of, I poured off the juices exuded by the eggplant chunks, quickly sauteed them in olive oil and then a half hour before the dinner, I combined the eggplant and the other pre-cooked components and brought it to a simmer. I also spiced it up with cayenne. Even the half hour was a little long -- the vegetables were starting to mush a little, but it was still a hit and an easy thing to make for a big crowd.

I usually make a roasted veggie version, but the oven was busy at a lower temperature so I made this one. Thought it was excellent. I did add a tablespoon of tomato paste and also when I cut my purple/white eggplant, it had a lot of seeds, so I salted, rinsed and drained it before proceeding with the recipe. I also cooked it for less time, probably only for twenty minutes, covered.

I was trying to recreate the ratatouille that my grandmother and great grandmother used to make for me, but this wasn't the same thing at all. It was quite good, but after talking to my grandmother, I realized the recipe is totally different than how they make ratatouille in Belgium. Next time, I'll leave out the eggplant and add courgettes and green beans. Thyme is definitely a must, and it is usually baked with a layer of grated cheese on top (or sometimes a pastry crust) until it becomes crispy.

I thought this recipe was great - it tasted exactly as my French host mother had made it the summer I stayed in France. I do agree with the suggestion about adding the eggplant at the end; either that, or chop it into very large cubes. I wouldn't see the eggplant in mine at the end if it weren't for the purple skin.

This is one of my favorite summer dishes. It is best if it chills overnight. I like to add the juice of at least half a lemon after it reaches room temperature but before chilling. Great picnic fare!

This recipe was delicious to the point where the top was put on the pan. It would be so much better if it stopped at that point, and veggies would be chunky, not mushy.

This is a perfect summer dish, and I always use veggies from either organic shops or farmers market, where it's sure to be fresher! I am not crazy about eggplant, so I omit it and add another zucchini, and add a bit more tomatoes and added green peppers to the yellow and red. I get vine-ripened tomatoes, and the riper it is the better, but not too ripe. It is better the 2nd day, to be sure. I like adding variations, like towards the end of summer, I would add potatoes or beans to it to make it a bit more heartier, but still light!

This is a nice simple ratatouille recipe. The markets in France are full of beautiful veggies and herbs to make it, so I have tried a different recipe each week the last month or so and this is the favourite one yet. My boyfriend is Tunisian and likes things a bit spicier, so I added about a teaspoon of harissa to the recipe for some extra flava flave - works well! Other than that did not change a thing.

I thought this dish was surprisingly bland (maybe too strong a word) for the gorgeous combo of fresh vegetables and herbs it contained. It seemed to need way too much salt.

I lived in the south of france for a number of years and never once had tarragon in a ratatouille. Thyme, yes, garlic, ditto. Taragon doesn't grow in the south. And my ex-mother-in-law, and all her friends in Sigean would saute all the ingredients together, in the order in this recipe. In fact, this recipe is just the way they made it. Sometimes, the basic things are good.

I made this last night using tinned tomatoes and although everyone liked it, I agree with the writer from Southampton. It needs a bit more "oomph". Not saying that this recipe is right or wrong. I'm just talking about personal taste. I'll be using this one again but will doctor it to make it my own. Maybe I'll add tarragon ;-)

This was pretty good BUT I've definately had better...I prefer the eggplant more mashed. Overall, the dish could've been more flavorful.

I've never heard of tarragon in this recipe either, but who's to say? To punch it up you can add a small dash of cayenne, but be careful not to over do it. I've also added a pinch or more of sugar, depending upon the sweetness of the tomatoes and caramelization of the veggies. You need to season as you go and taste carefully at the end. Remember, these recipes were individual to the household, much like stews and ragu's. There's really no single recipe to be hung-up about.

Could use a few more ingr. to punch it up a bit

I lived in France for several years, and tried several different recipes for ratatouille while I was there, but this one is definitely my favorite. The others were too complicated (saute all of the vegetables separately, peel the tomatoes) and/or didn't turn out right (some vegetables were mushy, others almost crunchy). With this recipe, it turns out great every time for me. I, too, like it either hot or cold, and it is definitely one of my favorites to have for leftovers! To the reviewer who insisted authentic ratatouille must have tarragon, I have never heard of or seen any ratatouille recipe with tarragon in it--the ones I am familiar with include thyme, sometimes with basil, rosemary, and/or parsley added. I am curious to know if the recipe he speaks of from the 1920's is one that includes tarragon.

Rating: 3
Good dish. I took advice of other reviewers and substituted diced canned tomatoes. Also included tarragon rather than thyme and it turned out well. Definitely would make it again.

Rating: 2
This recipe is preposterous! Any decent ratatouille MUST contain tarragon. Ideally, each ingredient should be fried seperately before adding to the main pot. And it tastes better the second day. I'm sure this version is just fine, though. Interesting ratatouille fact: It's thought of as a traditional dish from time immemorial. In fact, the first mention of it in a cook book was in the 1920's.

I made this wonderful recipe as a side dish for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. Instead of peeling and seeding the tomatoes I used 2 28oz. cans of diced tomatoes. I had no problem with mushy or bitter eggplants as mentioned below. I used large firm eggplants and cut them in large cubes (1-inch). Follow the directions and you will have a hit!!! I made it in advance then heated to a warm temp. before serving.

We enjoyed the dish - an excellent way to use lots of veggies. I added some grated carrots and extra garlic and ended with a thick, chunky, robust meal.

I liked this recipe. I have made ratatouille before but like the larger chunks of vegetables in this version. I transferred greek olives and capers from my other recipe to this one -- gave it a nice boost!

When I made this recipe, I used only fresh vegetables purchased that morning from our local farmer's market. I would recommend peeling the tomatoes first as I found the sight of tomato skins floating around the ratatouille not particularly pleasing. Also the beautiful small eggplants that I used had a very bitter aftertaste. I am wondering whether peeling them too, or salting them and allowing them to drain would eliminate this problem. I ended up having to take out all the eggplant before I served the dish, due to this aftertaste.

I add the eggplant and the zucchini at the last 4 mins of cooking else the eggplant and the zucchini turn into mush. Hence the low rating.

Great ratatouille recipe, if a bit time-consuming. Goes well with Red Snapper Nicoise (also from this website). I used the leftovers the next day in omelettes with Swiss cheese - also excellent.

Because it is late June, vegetables at my local market are soaring in quality. With the perfectly firm eggplant, super-ripe plum tomatoes, sweet(!) garlic and fresh herbs I was able to find/use, the ratatouille produced an aroma to die for. This is why I love summertime cooking. If I made the ratatouille in winter with stale, imported veggies, the results would be far inferior. Enjoy the fresh veggies while they last! Although you can serve this dish hot, warm or cold, it is best hot because the aroma is so heavenly.

I used half of this at potluck one night - served hot. A resounding success. Served the other half cold at a potluck the following night. Good again!
