I make this every year for Christmas morning. Sometimes with rum and sometimes with Grand Marnier. Top it with fresh berries marinated in Grand Marnier and you have a winner!

Finally!!! A Drinkin' Breakfast. Seriously, this is not for children, but it's amazing. My husband and I made this today and we both LOVED it. We used slices, not sticks, of bread, used a griddle set to 375* and cooked them about four minutes per side. We added butter to each slice before we sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar. We also tried them with maple syrup and agree that it didn't add a thing. They stand alone! We used really good dark rum (Mount Gay Special Reserve) that we picked up in Barbados. Maybe that's why they were so potent and yummy!

This recipe is relatively a lot of work for French toast. Yes, the panettone makes it tasty, but the cutting, soaking, turning on all sides, and ALSO sprinkling with sugar is not worth the extra effort. Just use the panettone in slices, I would say. I also had WAY too much egg/milk mixture.

We enjoyed panettone french toast at a wonderful hotel in Seattle; I was delighted to find this recipe. We enjoy making this around the holidays.

I fed my leftover pannetone to the birds.

I would make this again if I got panettone again for a gift. I did not get the recipe from here but I had two left over panettones last year, I froze one and eventually used it all for french toast. I used Grand Marnier though. Rum sounds perfectly wonderful though! Serve it to the person who bought you the panettone. Maybe they will get the hint! I also made fresh whipped cream with orange and lemon gremolata. Pack on those calories baby!

it was delicious even without the rum.
