Made this for the first time last night, not a fan of boiled potatoes so I cut the potatoes in half, tossed in olive oil with salt and pepper and laid flat on a rimmed cookie sheet at 425 for 20 minutes and flipped for about another 15 minutes, everything else was the same except I used a regular cucumber as I couldn't find the pickling kind. I made the dish about 3 to 4 hours ahead and brought to room temp, everyone raved about them and there were no leftovers. I will definitely make again.

Yum! The dressing was satisfying and flavorful without being TOO over-the-top unhealthy. I can see this being a great potluck dish.

I made this for a family gathering this past saturday and got rave reviews. Everyone asked for the recipe. It was fast and tasted good made fresh and the next day. I didn't add the pickles and I 2.5X the recipe for a 5 pound bag of potatoes.

Too sour for my taste. Seemed a waste of ingredients.

I have made this about 5 times now...I absolutely love it! It's so easy and delicious and perfect for any occasion. The first time I used cucumbers but this it's much better without. I have added a dollop of mayo and some minced shallots and use olive oil instead of canola. Brilliant!

This was good. I was not blown away by it, but it definitely fulfilled the potato salad craving. It makes a huge amount, so if it's just you, I definitely recommend cutting in half...or more.

This is a great potato salad. Very popular when I brought it to a few barbecues and other get togethers. I like that there is no mayo in this.

This was good, but I have made better. The flavors did not intensify the way I have had in other salads. But it was good.

I thought this was great. I am a big salt fan so I added a good amount of salt to the potatoes while cooking them. My husband even liked it and he hates any kind of potato salad.

I had no rice wine vinegar and used plain unseasoned rice vinegar. I followed sevral reviewers' sugestion and used mayonnaise. It was pretty darned good, but I thought the cucumbers added nothing. My family loved this.

What a wonderful salad! I too am a Mayo fan, so I added a little less than 1/2 cup of Mayo mixed with 2 Tbs. of Canola oil. Just perfect. I was looking for a potato salad that used fresh dill and this fit the bill perfectly. I am not a big mustard fan. I added the mustard anyway and thought the mustard gave it a nice touch. I like this better than my Mom's. (Don't tell my Mom though.)

I loved it. Yes, the kids didn't but they never like potato salad. It is a light refreshing change. I added a touch more of rice vinegar and a tablespoon of minced shallots. YUM!

I think this was great I added some salt and it was terrific!I disagree with the person who in a review said that this was not for kids. I'm eleven and its great!

This is an excellent, easy to prepare recipe. Great for summer menus. I substituted 2TBL olive oil and 4TBL mayonnaise for the canola oil, which tastes MUCH better if you're not counting fat grams. Also, added some finely diced red onion - very nice. The fresh dill makes the salad, so skip this one if you don't have fresh. Enjoy!

I enjoyed the recipe but it wasn't the consensus of opinions. It's definately not a recipe for children's tastes. I agree that it's a nice side dish as an addition to a summer barbecue.

An absolutely perfect recipe for summer parties and barbecues. It's so light and refreshing. I substituted mayo for five of the six Tablespoons of canola oil, and the result was wonderful and light and creamy. Note: Use fresh dill. It makes all the difference.
