The 'finale' dessert for our wine club annual banquet- 19 years and going strong! Peaches in season were a perfect combo with the melba sauce. Assembled at the last moment and the cake looked fabulous. Sprinkled peach schnapps on the sliced peaches to marinate- added to the peachiness! Served with a Calif. Essensia dessert wine- couldn't have been a better match! Not too sweet, nor was the dessert. A light ending to a perfct summer meal! Had a likeness to 'trifle'.

I added 1/2 c balkan style yogurt and 1 c of soured milk as I did not have buttermilk on hand. Very light and moist. Agreed with a previous review and baked 30 min. Added fruit and cream at last min and did only half cake so the rest did not get soggy. Used half strawberries with the peaches. Was a huge hit with guests so I am making again tonight for another dinner party. Loved the light taste of lemon in the cake.

To the recipe's credit the lemon buttermilk cake turned out very moist, and tasted wonderful, however when the fruit and whipped cream topping is added the cake instantly turns soggy. We ended up throwing away half of this cake because we couldn't finish it right away and the cake would not have saved overnight. Also, because this cake is supposed to be layered the top half of the cake slides off very easily and creates a huge mess. I would not reccomend making this cake to anyone... Aside from the mess, the cake did not taste impressive either. Stick with the original peach melba recipe.

I made this for a pizza party at college after the instructor requested a cake 'with fruit'. What a winner!!! The plates were cleaned in record time. I didn't have peaches on hand, so I used sliced strawberries that had been sitting in sugar for a couple of hours, and the effect was spectacular. I enjoyed it so much I'm making it again this weekend for my roommates!

This is a really luscious summer dessert-- the lemon-buttermilk cake is especially nice (much more interesting than a plain yellow cake) and could be used with lots of other toppings. The raspberry sauce was a nice finisher too. A word of warning, though-- the peaches and frosting don't keep very well, so dress the cake shortly before serving and try to finish it (that won't be hard!)

The cake was moist and wonderful- could be served plain or with any fruit on top. I baked for only 30 minutes to make sure it would be moist. My super-critical relatives LOVED this cake! I used fresh picked peaches and also added homemade peach icecream and the raspberry sauce.
