I used a crusty loaf of sourdough bread, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The sandwich had a lot of flavor, and can't wait to try the aioli on asparagus and artichokes.

Quite a tasty sandwich. Really liked how crispy the pancetta became when baked in the oven. Have made the aioli a few times now and used it with chicken, fish, etc. Very tasty.

Great sandwich. I used a 3 ounce package of the pancetta for 2 sandwiches. I love crispy pancetta. The aioli turned out great but could use a little more flavor. I forgot to toast the bread and the sandwich was good but would be better with toasted bread.

Couldn't find mizuna, so used arugula instead. The aioli turned out great - used regular olive oil. All in all, much better and lighter version of typical BLT. Great for a light supper when you don't feel like cooking.

This was pretty good. I used arugula and potato bread because I couldn't find brioche that day. I think a better bread would have made the sandwich. My aioli came out fine. A better version of the BLT!

According to Shirley Corriher in Cookwise, unrefined oils such as EVOO have something in them that interferes with the emulsifiers in egg yolks. You might want to try again with a refined oil such as canola, peanut, corn or just plain olive oil

HELP! I'm wondering if anyone can help me figure out what went wrong. I made the aioli, exactly as written. I blended the garlic with the EVOO, and then folded in the mayo. It wouldn't mix properly though. I looked like it was curdled. So I figured I'd try to blend it and of course it turned to a liquid so I just threw it away. Does anyone have any idea what I did wrong?

Do you know about the food dictionary on this site? very useful for figuring out what some weird stuff is. "mizuna [mih-ZOO-nuh] Hailing from Japan, this feathery, delicate salad green can be found in farmer's markets and specialty produce markets from spring through summer. It's often found in MESCLUN, a special salad-green mix. Choose mizuna by its crisp, green leaves, avoiding any wilted or browning specimens. Refrigerate in a plastic bag for up to 5 days. Wash and thoroughly dry just before using. " http://www.epicurious.com/cooking/how_to/food_dictionary/search?query=mizuna
