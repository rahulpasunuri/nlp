I am not a paella expert, but I thought this was a great dish. Easy to prepare and lots of flavour I used Argentinian sausage and shrimp this time. Will try with chicken or different seafood another time. I did boil the shrimp shells to make a quick "stock" instead of using the chicken broth.

I have to say, I loved this recipe. It was easy and had wonderful flavors. I did add salt and red pepper to it. I also threw in some scallops a few minutes or two before the shrimp. It's also important that you reserve the 1/4 broth for the seafood/peas. Next time I might add some lemon juice or a pinch of oregano to add a little something, but it's pretty good.

Simple, and tastes like it. Not impressive.

Ugh. This is truly the most bland paella I've ever had. Commit to doing the work, find a good authentic recipe, and make the real thing!

A client of mine from Argentina told me his paella recipe and I had forgotten it by the time I wanted to make it. I knew I could find one on this site that would be similar, and this was it. The only ingredient I didn't have was the hot Spanish paprika, so I used some regular, smoked paprika, and a little cayenne. This dish was great, so flavorful! To anyone new to cooking paella, I would tell you not to worry so much about exact measurements, the rice soaks up so much of the flavor. I doubled the recipe and added some chicken. Then I kept adding more paprika and cayenne to get the flavor I wanted. I will definitely make this again! Thank you for the excellent recipe!
