Very tasty, but combination of salt before searing and the soy sauce, made it too salty. Next time would use light soy.

I've made this a couple of times now, substituting Chinese cooking wine for the sherry. I've also sprinkled sesame seeds over the finished steaks. Easy and tasty!

This receipe is such a tried and true in my household. I return to it often for dinner parties and casual meals at home since its so fast and easy. I recommend preparing the soy and sherry in advance as the hot pan dissapaites the ingredients quickly. I've added more as needed and it never tastes off.

A friend gave me a beautiful piece of ahi tuna yesterday and said I'd better eat it by the next day. I tried this simple recipe for the first time (didn't have any sesame oil so substituted olive oil instead) and I was in heaven! By far the best tasting rare-seared tuna I've ever had. I don't know if it was the simplicity of the recipe or the freshness of the fish or both but I will remember this dish and make it again and again. Amazing!!

Loved this! So quick and easy to do. Agreed with previous posters about fresh, sashimi-quality tuna a must for this dish. Tweaks: Only did about 1 1/2 minutes per side as per reviews here. Also subbed tequila for sherry, since I had it on hand. Also added cayenne pepper and ground white pepper since it was in pantry. It really gave this a quick!

Rating: 4
Have made this recipe many times for family and friends. The key for me is to cook this on med-high heat about 1.5 minutes per side rather than the 3 they call for. rare/pink in the middle. Also be sure to get the tuna close to room temp before cooking & have everything else ready to go. The faster this makes its way from the cooktop to plate the better. An all time favorite in this household!

I made this a few months ago. My husband and I loved it following the recipe. You have to like that kind of fish, half raw. I am making it tonight Its yummy!!

A wonderful dish!!! But I had little time to prepare and get ingrediants so I had to make do with what I had. Firstly I changed the oil that I was using to canola oil, I used a glaze for the soy sauce, and didnt put in any chives or green onion tops even though I regret it. Oh, and instead of using the Sherry I used taquilla. It was a perfect substitute that made it sweeter and gave it a nice lingering taste in the mouth. This is a must do recipe if you want to cook ahi

Rating: 3
Very, very tasty recipe but the key is having very good, fresh tuna. I used 1 very large tuna steak, probably 1.5-2 inches thick and it was fantastic. I think I reduced the sauce a little too much as it was borderline too salty, but I would definitely make again.

Very easy to make but a little too salty (even with low sodium soy sauce). I may try adding a little crushed ginger next time to even spice it up a bit.

I added sesame seeds to the pepper coating, which was delicious when seared. DO NOT take that comment about searing time lightly- I took my steaks out of the pan semi-raw, and a few minutes sitting on the counter had them, literally, overcooked- just by themselves.

This is a great recipe. I used Dry Rice Wine instread of the Sherry (for a more authentic flavor) and add a small handful of fresh cut Ginger sticks to the reduction sauce. My Taiwanese mother was proud...and my husband was sad I didn't make enough for leftovers!

Awesome! Another recipe that prooves one of the best things about Bon Appetit is that you can get it right the first time. THese tuna steaks are a snap to prepare (literally 7 minutes) and they are totally goumet tasting. I served with steamed gyozas, rice and broccoli...Asian style family dinner!

I have made this a number of times, and it is the best 'easy' recipe for tuna I've tried. I usually add extra sherry and use it to dress greens as well as the fish. Simple, no special ingredients needed, and a great way to present ahi tuna.

I served this on a bed of baby greens with shaved jicama (didn't have Dakon), and now my frineds think I'm some kind of chef! Really easy recipe -- if you can find it soy paste instead of sauce really thickens up the sauce w/out having to reduce....

Rating: 4
Very quick and elegant! I placed the tuna steaks on mounds of organic quinoa cooked in chicken stock. The sauce formed a delicious offset to the grain. I went a little heavy on the sherry (medium dry Amontillado) and eased up on the soy, suiting my taste. I skipped the salt too (I never use salt to cook, adding it only at the table if desired). I think the tuna would go well on beds of grated celery heart, mashed sweet potato, mashed turnip, or pilaf. Furthermore, in future I would venture to include lemon or lime juice to give a bit more of an acid sensation to compliment the saltiness of the soy sauce.

Rating: 2
A quick and simple dish for when I'm in a pinch for time. Would not serve it for company, though, unless I did a different sauce. Way to salty and my husband thought, uninteresting. Maybe the low sodium soy and ginger suggested by others would help, but then again...maybe it just needs a different sauce!

Rating: 4
For a more tasty and savory version (4 fork level), marinate steaks with a small amt of rice vinegar, chili sauce and a tad of low sodium soy sauce. Before searing the fish, rub the steaks with sesame oil, sesame seeds, a pinch or 2 of coarse salt and crushed peppercorns. If you have sushi-grade ahi, then cook only the 2 surfaces; DO NOT sear until the center is opaque - you'll ruin the texture.

I searched this site for Tuna Steaks after we bought them at Costco. I liked the simplicity of this recipe and have to tell you it was easy and had great flavors. I would definitely make this again. I used the sesame seeds as many had recommended. I used too much Sesame oil and when I added the soy and sherry it splattered...I am learning.

oy, wrong recipe.. the following post is for "Grilled Tuna with Herbed Aioli"; I've never tried this recipe. Really liked that one though, as you can probably tell

Rating: 4
It started with the aioli - it was so good I forgot about the fish for a minute and was just standing in my kitchen eating swipes of mayonnaise. I never do that. I took lots of liberties with this recipe, mostly because of last mintue (non)planning and a lack of ingredients. Doubled the garlic, made up the 2nd half of the vinegar with a balsamic/white combo, used parsley instead of tarragon. Regardless, this was the. best. fish. ever. Ever. Super delicious - I'm putting off brushing my teeth so I can continue to savor the flavor. Seriously. Thanks Epicurious, for a great recipe!

Rating: 4
WOW! so totally impressive and easy! I seared for 3 minutes each side and the tuna was "perfect" also sauteed fresh spinach with some garlic and olive oil (about one tablespoon to one bag of spinach) then served the tuna ontop of the spinach and poured the sauce over the top with chives to garnish. Totally had RAVE reviews!!! this will go in my "company quality" recipe box!!!! Thankyou epicurious! the presentation was beautiful and the taste was even better!! serve this if you want to WOW your guests! and the best part is how EASY this dish is!!

Rating: 3
So fast to make, and very delicious. I have a hard time enjoying fish at home but this was really great! I altered the recipe, increasing the sauce by adding tangerine juice, extra sherry, soy and sesame oil and adding a splash of rice wine vinegar to cut the sweetness a bit. I also added tangerine segments to the sauce while it was reducing since I had no green onions or scallions. I addition, I reduced the cooking time to about a minute on each side so it was still nice and pink in the middle. Yum! We ate it in about the amount of time it took to cook! Next time, green onions and some sesame seeds added to the pepper, and a bit of wasabi in the sauce.

Rating: 3
Wonderfully simple and delicious!This is my first time making ahi at home, but it's so easy that I will definitely make this a regular. My stove is very hot on the high setting, so I cooked the tuna for only 2 minutes. It was slightly blackened on the outside, but nice and rare on the inside. Next time I'll reduce the heat slighly to avoid blackening (was still yummy). Note to self: Make extra sauce!

Rating: 3
Thought this one was really good; definitely agree 3 min on each side is a little long - did it more like 1 1/2 on each side, but really i think you just need to watch it. sauce was yummy - we added a little cream to the sauce and drizzled it over steamed spinach and tenderstem broccoli. great!

Rating: 4
Great recipe, but I kicked it up a bit. Instead of pepper, I used roased szechuan pepper which I get at the asian market, as well as coating with sesame seeds. I also double the amount of sherry and soy sauce and add some hoisin and a dash of orange juice. Love extra sauce for veggies and rice.

This was my first attempt at preparing fresh tuna at home; I've always been too intimidated to try making it myself. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and cooked each side 1.5 minutes and it turned out to be cooked just right (for me anyway, too rare for my husband). However, that is about the best I have to say for this recipe. I did not care for the flavor of the sauce and, even with the use of low-sodium soya sauce and no added salt on the fish, WAY too salty for me. To be fair, I think I was trying to recreate the same flavor of the tuna I've had at my favorite sea food restaurant and I should have realized that I wasn't going to get that from the ingredients here.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe. Simple and quick. I made the recipe verbatim. I did not find it salty. I always scant salt in a recipe that uses soy sauce. I salted the steaks with a very small pinch.. perhaps used an 1/8 of a tsp for 4 steaks. I used Japanese Soy (Tamari) and California sherry. They worked fine. Served with lightly garlic mashed potatoes.

Rating: 3
Fantastic recipe... just make sure you remove the pan from the heat while removing the tuna, and allow it to cool a little before adding the sherry or wine (I used chardonnay) - the pan & sesame oil was too hot when I added the wine and holy smokes!!

I also would recommend rice wine or shao shing wine in lieu of the sherry.

Absolutely limit the salt as others have said. I also added a can of Wu Chung seasoned mixed mushrooms found in aisan supermarkets for a different finish and garnished with toasted sesamee seeds. With or without the mushrooms, this is a delicious dish that will impress family and friends.

I believe fresh tuna should always be treated as a red meat. This is a good starter recipie for those unfamiliar with tuna. The crushed pepper is good for one side. On the other use sea or kosher salt. The same as your basic Steak Au Poivre recipie. Omit the alchohol completley. Remove steaks. Add 5-6 fine minced shallots (no substitutuions), the larger the better, and then a few ladles of lobster stock or fumet. Bring to boil with heavy cream, reduce and finish sauce with unsalted butter. Works well with shark steaks also. Add 1/4 cup fine minced Spanish Onion with shallots.

YUMMM!! Not only delicious, but quick and easy! 2nd time I used ground pistachios for coating, mixed with ground pepper. Made a lovely crust. Can serve with wilted spinach and shallots, julienne zucchini, yellow squash and red pepper (sauteed) or rice.

I tried this twice. It's really, really salty. With the sherry and soy, it's just too much. I loved what the chives added so I made a 2nd stab using low sodium soy - still to salty for me. I think I'll try the tuna with Ginger Shiitake Cream sauce next time.

This was REALLY Wonderful. A little salty. Next time I'll use less soy or light-sodium. Tuna only needs a 1 minute and 1/2 or so to cook. I also added seseme seeds. My sauce didn't come out so great and again, added a bit of salty taste. I think it would have been fine without. Can't wait to make again!!

This Rocks! I followed the cook from Northern California's lead. After searing the Tuna I added a 1/2 cut of Sherry, a 1/2+ cup of Vegatable broth and about 2 tablespoons of Soy Sauce to the same pan. Then I cooked Baby Bok Choy in the boiling broth... wow! I aways wondered how many top rated restaurants got that flavor... now I know.

This was delicious and so easy. I peppered the tuna and then I rubbed it with a little sesame oil and covered it with a mixture of white and black sesame seeds (I just stick the seeds and tuna in a plastic bag and shake to coat). I got both the peppery flavor and the most beautiful toasted crust. I took suggestions below and added both chopped ginger and garlic to the sauce. It was fantastic, but next time I think I will also add a little chili oil or mix the soy sauce with wasabi powder to give it an extra little kick.

I used the following variations: Pepper the tuna steaks, leave out the salt. Sear the steaks in sesame oil one minute on each side (leaving the center slightly raw). Mix 1/2 c Lite Soy Sauce & 1/2 c Amontillado medium dry sherry (Harvey's or Dry Sac are best)and some diced ginger. After removing the steaks, bring the mixture to a boil. Dump in a bag of washed spinach, cover and simmer until the spinach is wilted and the liquid is somewhat reduced. Make a bed of spinach in the center of each plate, put the steaks on top, and pour remaining sauce over all. Garnish with chives, parsley, or fresh corinander (yum). The type of sherry you use makes all the difference for making this recipe truly great.

This recipe is as easy to make as they come. Took about 10-15 mins. from start to finish. I didn't have any fresh ginger, but would have added that. I did add about 1 t. fresh chopped garlic. Making it again tonight, adding a bit of wasabi. *Don't* overcook. Maybe 1 min. a side on high heat.

This is a good, quick, basic recipe. It actually takes about 10 minutes to prepare, so is great for working moms. Like everyone I cut down the cooking time, only I like my tuna rare in the center, so I only cooked it 1 minute per side. I made the sauce as written, only doubled the quantity. I agree that the dish is a little salty: next time I will omit salting the tuna before cooking and I will try low sodium soy sauce. I will also reduce the sauce a little more.

We have made this twice in as many weeks. It was so easy and tasty. The only recommendation is to cook the tuna for 1.5 minutes on each side as opposed to the 3 minutes the recipe calls for. Much tastier the second time around as it was not as dry yet it was cooked all the way through.

This recipe is great and so easy. It is a good recipe to have on hand in case you have surprise guests come over - it's quick and easy but tastes great too. Go easy on the pepper - I over peppered (probably used more than the suggested amount) and they were a little spicy - still a great dish.
