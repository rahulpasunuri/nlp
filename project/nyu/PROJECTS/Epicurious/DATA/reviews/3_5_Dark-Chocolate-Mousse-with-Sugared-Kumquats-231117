Kumquats abound in SoCal this time of year so I decided to find some recipes to use an often neglected bounty. Boy, am I glad I found this recipe. I made the mousse last night for dinner tonight with friends. The scrapings off the bowl were a good indicator of what was to come, but the kumquats and chocolate together were exquisite. My friends and I enjoyed it throughly. A definite keeper and easy to remember/ modify for variations.

This is so easy and it is VERY delicious!!! It takes no time to whip up. I leave the kumquats out and just add a bit of whip cream on top. If you don't want it to be too rich add a little less chocolate.

I love this as a light (in calories as well as texture) alternative to traditional chocolate mousse made with heavy cream. It's incredibly simple, very easy to make, and always gets kudos. It's also a good base for variations - you can add some extract or liqueur to the melted chocolate to flavor it, serve it with whipped cream or fruit, or whatever strikes your fancy. This is a regular in my dessert repertoire.

To the poster below: yes, you melt the chocolate with the water, and it works fine and doesn't sieze. This is a tasty, light mousse with a somewhat foamy texture. It won't satisfy those looking for a classic rich and creamy chocolate mousse, but it's a nice alternative when you want something lighter. I didn't make the candied kumquats, and topped it candied orange slices instead.
