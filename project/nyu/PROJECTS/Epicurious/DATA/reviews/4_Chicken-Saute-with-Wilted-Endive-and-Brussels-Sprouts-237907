Good but not great! Chicken was moist but along with the veggies was a bit bland. I also used some garlic and poured the pooled juice from the plate on the chicken.

Simple, but not exciting. I added sherry to the chicken and a touch of garlic to the veggies, which helped. If I were to make it again, it would be only with the Brussels sprouts.

super simple and great flavors. i added half a clove of garlic to the chicken before cooking and sauted the other half before adding the vegetables. also substituted white wine for the chicken broth.

This is extremely easy to make. Perfect for a weeknight meal. My husband was hesitant about the brussels sprouts, but ended up wanting seconds. Definitely have the butcher pound the breasts or buy cutlets.flavorful and yummy.

Very fresh tasting. The husband isn't fond of brussel sprouts so I substituted asparagus. Worked out great. Served with small yukon gold potatoes tossed with butter and chives. Would definitely make this again.

I will make this recipe again and again. I've already made it twice since the issue came out. The second time I served it to my visiting French friend from Paris and she loved it, even asking for the recipe. You can easily adapt this to more chicken and more vegetables. It is very fresh tasting and nice to eat crisp vegetables. Ask your butcher to flatten the breasts and life will be even easier if possible with this recipe.
