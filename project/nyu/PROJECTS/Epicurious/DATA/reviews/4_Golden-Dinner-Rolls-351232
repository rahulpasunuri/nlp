These turned out fabulously soft and with great flavor. I used yellow potatoes instead of yam because I wanted a white roll -- perfect texture. I just made a sponge starter early in the day and that was fine, no need for anything more complicated.

I agree with other reviews. The rolls are good enough, however, the direction are really involved. I am a culinary student and the yeast breads we do in bakery are less steps and just as if not more delicious then these! be prepared to commit to an all day venture with these rolls!

I agree with markhous. Also not so sure about the taste of Yam in this recipe. This isn't a keeper.

great recipe but too complex. i made them over two days. they turned out just like the picture. however, the oven temp is too high. i baked them at 350 for 11-12 min.

I hand-kneaded the dough completely and they turned out beautifully. Crispier outside- fluffy soft inside. Loved the color, wish the taste was a little less floury- maybe I'll add more honey next time. But I'll make these again.

These are some of the best dinner rolls I've ever had. I made them very small, and sprinkled a little coarse sea salt on top - our guests just RAVED.

Amazing! The raising process was a little involved, but they turned out with an incredible texture--crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. The flavor isn't noticiably sweet potato-ish, but it is very delicious. So yummy! I followed the directions, except for the baking instructions--I just baked them on a baking sheet in a preheated oven (no ice--seemed a little too complex) but they turned out great, anyway.
