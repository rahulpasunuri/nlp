Quick, easy, hearty, and delicious

Lentil soup is a favorite, but I'd tired of the traditional green-herb and onion/leek seasoning of the recipe I'd tended to make. The curry in this recipe is lovely, not forcing an overtly "Indian" flavor--just adding aromatic depth. Some 7 cups of homemade celery-heavy vegetable stock made for a brothy but still hearty base. Otherwise, I used a small can of chopped tomatoes, no celery, dry sherry, and the juice of only 1/4 lemon--maybe 2 tsp. I also added 1 1/2 cups or so of chopped kale and chard and a handful of fresh orecchiette from the freezer. Served it with simple cheese/green onion/cilantro quesadillas and a big salad. Perfect December dinner.

Excellent recipe. Added cilantro to it and a little ginger. Came out wow. Did not add carrots, celery and wine. Will try that next time.

more like just short of 3 forks. i adore lentil soup, and this was a stretch, using the curry seasonings. began as i always would, sauteeing the onions, etc. then added the curry powder. i have 5, mebbe this one wasn't the best choice..SO thought it was "hot," and wanted some yoghurt to cool it off a bit, tho' i liked it as is. followed recipe & ingredients basically, except 2 cloves garlic, extra celery, no white wine (oops! forgot!) i enjoyed it a lot, but henceforth i'm going back to my lentil soup that has evolved over, and never failed, in 20 years. i must say, tho' that the whole house has a lovely curry fragrance -- not used to that! it's certainly worth a try.

It wasn't really horrible, but the flavor didn't really do it for me. I even sauteed the veggies first (as suggested by some of the reviewers). It tasted a bit flat- there wasn't much complexity to the flavor. I served it with a dollop of yogurt, which did help somewhat.

Made 2 days ahead for a fast weeknight meal and it was wonderful. We were thrilled to have some leftovers for quick easy lunches too. It tastes so good and warm and homey, you'll forget that it is also good for you. We didn't add the wine (didn't have), no celery (someone ate it all first) and subbed some leftover tomato sauce for the tomatoes and these changes still made for an excellent soup. Actually, I used only 5&1/2 cups of broth as we prefer a thicker more stew-like texture and that's exactly what we got. I did sautee the vegs first, and when soft added the curry powder & cooked for a couple of minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also probably let the whole thing cook for about an hour.

This didn't work for me. The main problem was that the onions and celery stayed a bit crunchy and I don't like crunchy onions in my soup. Also, the curry overpowered the other flavors and I wanted to taste more of the squash. If I made it again, I think I'd saute the veggies first and leave out the curry. I make a curried lentil soup that I like, but I wanted to taste more subtle flavors in this soup.

Very delicious! A definate keeper!

I made the recipe exactly as described except that I used about 7 cups of chicken broth instead of 5. It was one carton of swanson's broth and two cans. I didn't find it too acidic at all, although I suspect I cooked it a little longer than 45 minutes, perhaps an hour? It took longer than I expected to come to a boil. However, I found that it was very delicious and quite refreshing, and I had no problem with it being too acidic. I also cooked it with the top on, although the instructions didn't specify.

This is very tasty! I did leave out the tomato (didn't have one) and lemon (since some people said it was too acidic), and since I had one carton beef stock and one of chicken, I used them both. I sauteed the onions first and then added the other ingredients in a pressure cooker and had delicious soup in 30 minutes! I used Trader Joe's Curry blend which has a delightful flavor. Almost four stars, but since it's more of an every day soup, I gave it three..I bet it would be amazing with a dollop of sour cream! That would probably make it four stars and servible to company...Yum!

I didn't like this soup at all after finishing making it, too acidic, however, it tasted much better the next day, when all the flavors had a chance to blend in.

This soup was...okay. I found it to be slightly too acidic from the lemon juice and slightly bland overall. It was, however, fantastically healthy, but it tasted more virtuous than delicious.

This was really tasty, especially after it sat for a day. I pureed it so that my picky eater daughter wouldn't see the pieces of stuff she doesn't like, and she loved this soup.

Wonderful soup for an Autumn day. I used the peel and seeds from the squash and simmered it with the stock to enhance the flavor, and garam masala (instead of curry powder) with a little ground fennel seed mixed in. Will definetly be making this again.

I loved this soup. I tried it both ways, sauteing veggies as suggested and simmering everything together. I liked it better without the extra step, just as the recipe states. More flavorful and no oil or butter. A novice with squash, though, I found no seeds in the butternut.

I omitted the wine, sauteed the onions and celery first, and added a tablespoon of garam masala. The soup was delicious, and even better the second day. I will definitely be making this regularly.

This was delicious. As suggested I sauteed the vegetables (onion, garlic, carrots and celery) first and then I added the curry powder and cooked that for a few minutes. Also as suggested I used just 5 C. of stock and that was plenty.

"Savory" is a terrific word to describe the soup!! It's wonderful, and incredibly easy to prepare. We served it with some crusty french bread and cheese, and had a delicious and healthy dinner. And it was even better the next day!

Delicious and interesting, subtle yet flavorful. Everyone loved it, including the non-vegetarians. I omitted the wine and it was still great. I would use no more than 5 cups of broth.

Great soup. I omitted the curry and it was still yummy.

I made this soup for my running club's monthly pot-luck dinner and everyone loved it. Best when made a day ahead and stored in the fridge. Omitting the wine doesn't harm this recipe at all.

This soup was absolutely lovely. I added two finely chopped sweet Italian sausage links and served buttermilk biscuits on the side. A real keeper!

This is a flavorful soup. The only thing that I did differently was that I pureed the soup once the vegetables had cooked through. It's great served with pita chips that are baked with oregano, olive oil and other seasonings. A great meal.

I thought the soup was delicious so did my husband. the texture is wonderfully creamy. The only thing I did differenly was I sauteed the vegetable first. My eight year old didn't care for it but the 18 month old liked it.
