Incredibly tasty and relatively simple, especially if you buy the pre-made oreo crust. A decadent treat.

I made this for my brother's birthday. It was quite easy to prepare and very very delicious. My only issues are as follows: the removable tart pan leaked ice cream in the first feezing. This created quite a mess and required that i add more ice cream and freeze for longer. Secondly, the white chocolate sauce bubbled up as it froze, which was very unattractive. Thankfully, this was not noticed due to copious amounts of toffee. Other than that, it was wonderful and everyone went nuts for it. Very sweet, that's for certain.

SO good - very rich - used 8 oz white chocolate and didn't experience the "sliding" off the ice cream. Also tripled the heath bar - used 3 bars on bottom and 3 on top. This dessert is easy to make but much easier if you start the night beofre due to the freezing time needed.

Everyone loved it. The white chocolate topping was challenging, very runny . The next time I'll use a deep pie dish and leave plenty of room for the topping so it doesn't run off.

This was very delicious but also very rich (the heavy cream in the topping is very intense). I agree that the more coffee flavored the ice cream is the better. I used almond toffe that was not chocolate covered and I liked it alot, added a nice saltiness to the combo. Definitely delicious but only in small amounts after that the tummy starts talking back.

When I read the recipe I thought it was going to be boring - just coffee ice cream in a chocolate crust. But WOW, it surprised all of us! The cinnamon in the crust and the white chocolate with toffee really gave this dessert some unusual flavors that transformed it beyond mere coffee ice cream. I had to feed more people so I made it a torte rather than a tart by using 1.5 quarts of ice cream! a 10" pan, 9oz of choc wafers, 1.5 times the white choc topping/toffee and cinnamon. Easy recipe as well.

Absolutely genius!!! Takes a few steps (so start it the day before) but is beyond worth it. Guests will be blown away. I ignored the measurements of toffee candy and just sprinkled as much as I wanted. Yum!

This was a huge hit for my Mom's birthday dinner. Not very difficult but start a few days in advance as there are many steps. Bought milk chocolate for topping by mistake but still tasted good. I took too long to pour the melted chocolate on top and it started to harden without being able to spread across the whole top. Did not really matter though. Did double the toffee on the crust and top as suggested.

This recipe was great! I loved the blend of crushed toffee bits and coffee ice cream. My only suggestion, leave about a 1/2 inch between the crust and white chocolate topping this way it doesn't spill over. All of my guests had second so I don't think they minded the mess.

Wow. Just coming back here to write this review makes my mouth water. Would be worth 10x the effort.

This is the best dessert recipe...plus, it's easy and can be made ahead. Use extra toffee bars on the crust and on the top. I use a 9" pie plate.

O-Ma-Gaud!!!!!! This was mind-blowing delicious! My guests raved about it! The recipe was easy but I recommend starting it the day before so you aren't praying for the freezer to SPEED things up. Enjoy!

I have made this so many times that I don't even use the recipe anymore. I use oreos because they are easier to find. I added more toffee bars on top of the crust. Terrific!

This was my father's favorite course at Christmas. He made my mother copy the recipe so he could enjoy the creamy sensation of the tart at home!

I made this dish last summer on a vacation with friends. This year, they wouldn't let me come unless I made it again. It was a smash hit both times!

I made this for father's day, it was a FABULOUS DESSERT, and got rave reviews from all!! Although it is very simple to prepare, you must plan your time accordingly because there are several steps. Next time I may add more chocolate-covered English toffee and you can easily use a whole quart of the ice cream rather than measure out 3 cups.

This tart was very, very easy to prepare. I usually screw things up so the fact that I was able to successfully prepare this speaks for itself. And the best part was that everyone loved it. I was actually asked to make it again for my brother-in-law's birthday party. I highly recommend this tart.

I made this dessert for New Year's pot-luck, and got nothing but raves. In fact, the hostess licked her plate!!!!

I served this for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews. It is a rich tasting dessert and very easy to make. It looks pretty and professionally done on the plate - I got lots of comments on that. I used a Starbucks Coffee ice cream with chocolate chunks that worked well. Very good and will make again.

I took this to a picnic and it was popular with everyone, even in its melted state. The only thing I didn't like was the white chocolate topping, mine was kind of gummy and slid off the ice cream.

This recipe was rated for the simplicity and wonderful taste. I did go the extra mile and made home made ice cream. I also use more Skor choclate crumbs just because I love toffee. The topping made it very rich, but it also made the dessert stand out from the "same old, same old" Loved that I could make it ahead of time...one last thing to worry come serving time.
