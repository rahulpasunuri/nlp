The only thing I've ever deep fried, and I'm SO GLAD I did. Flavors were amazing, and the rosemary really came through and complemented the other flavors well. It was definitely worth the time (three days) it took to make.

This received raves from my husband and I thought it was as good as my mom's best fried chicken - it was something she did quite well. I didn't do the brining in this recipe because I didn't find the recipe in time - instead I used Amanda Hesser's recipe which only took 2-3 hours in salted ice water with a little seasoning. I was glad I used the proportions of seasoning because left to myself I would have used less, and this was so very good. I reduced the recipe and used skinless chicken breasts (what I had on hand). I fried it in Crisco since you must fry chicken in Crisco according to southern authorities. I'll do it again and make a little more flour mixture since I ran short - wasn't sure how much to make for 3 pieces of chicken breast.

Excellent recipe-best I've had, could use a bit less salt. Maybe half the salt in the flour portion of the recipe.

I'm about to make this for the second time. My family ate this up VERY quickly, with my 4 year old proclaiming it to be the best chicken ever. I didn't change a thing; allowed the chicken to sit in the brine for a full 24 hours and then rinsed and let air dry for 24 hours. It took patience but it was well worth it!!!!

Excellent. Well worth the extra trouble and time involved.

Super fried chicken! I didn't bother with the third plate, just dredge all of the chicken in the seasoned flour, then through the buttermilk and back into the same plate, save on washing up! I too had darker crust than I'd have liked, but I wasn't watching my oil temp, obviously could have done with it being a little lower. Anyways, crunchy, spicy, tender, gorgeous! This is a keeper.

This was the best fried chicken ever! Tastes delicious cold too. My breading turned out very dark after frying. I followed the recipe exactly. I was wondering if this is how it should turn out...anyone?

WARNING - Please take note, the salt in the brine is Kosher salt, which is half as salty as regular table salt. For the breading, however, the recipe calls for fine sea salt, which is twice as salty as table salt. If you just use regular table salt for this recipe, your breading will be under-salted, and your meat too salty. Furthermore, a brine is for flavoring the inside flesh, not for flavoring the outside of the meat. Therefore, you should always rinse meat after it has been brined to remove the super- salinated residue of the brine.

Loved the flavor of the chicken after brining, but found the crust had too much pepper flavor to it. I'll try it again, but will cut way back on the pepper.

Can't argue with him. This is the best fried chicken I've ever made. I used wings only, cut into pieces, and they took about 7-9 minutes each. I was doing a large batch so I just tossed the finished wings into a 200 F oven as I finished them, then served from the oven. They were amazing.

Holy Smokes! This was AMAZING! I can't believe I had the patience to do this over 3 days, but it was a fantastic pay-off. The crust was ecstasy! And the flavors in the chicken were just wonderful. I am an old-school southern fryer, and believe in a slow fry, so my chicken took about 15-17 minutes per piece (I used legs and thighs only). The flavors re-heated beautifully, although if someone can tell me how I can reheat and keep that crispy crust, I'd be delighted. Will be taking this to all company events from now on.

The extreme saltiness made this chicken inedible. It was a bit heavy handed on the pepper also. I ate a couple of wings and tossed the rest. Pity. I like the technique and will continue to brine chicken and use the buttermilk/seasoned flour method, but with much less salt. The chicken was very moist and the coating nice and crunchy.

Perfect, fantastic. My cooking time was lower than stated here (about 9 minutes was perfect for me), but other than that, everything was spot-on with this recipe. It really is great fried chicken.
