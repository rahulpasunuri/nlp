This is the granola that made my husband rethink his dislike of coconut. Even he loves this stuff. It is very very sweet, almost like candy. I find it too sweet to eat with milk, but it is great on top of unsweetened yogurt.

delicious combination of flavors and textures. crunchy, sweet and salty. perhaps more of a crunch 'n' munch than a breakfast cereal. just a tad overwhelming on the molasses and definitely needs more coconut. also, i wouldn't put the raisins in til the end--mine almost burnt in those last fifteen minutes. next time, i think i'll turn this into a oatmeal ginger cookie, 1/4 molasses, 3/4 brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter and a 1/2 cup of flour should adequately coat the oats and peanuts plus a full cup of coconut and a tablespoon of shredded fresh ginger. i'll let you all know how it turns out, or if someone else tries it first, go for it.

This is really tasty, especially over yogurt. I added extra oats, and some bran (about 5 cups instead of 3) and a splash of vanilla extract. I love when you know what's in your food! I didn't find this too sticky, i lined my pan with aluminum foil first and cleanup was a breeze.

I made a few changes to this recipe and it came out really great. I substituted 1/2 cup of banana puree for the oil and water, added cinnamon (1T) and an additional 1/2 cup of oats, I also used mixed nuts in place of just peanuts. Awesome!!

A nice departure from the typical granola recipe. I used about 1/3 c white sugar (too lazy to bother with the rock-hard brown sugar) and 1/3 c dark molasses, since I'm not a fan of super sweet granola. Definitely grease the pan well... this stuff is stickier than your average granola.

I used Spanish peanuts and blackstrap molasses. Yum.
