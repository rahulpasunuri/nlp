And didn't realize my husband had already reviewed this. Still three forks, though. Maybe close to four.

Yum. Took this to a tailgate party on a snowy and windy Utah morning. We usually keep it really simple for our small group but across from us is a larger group that are the undisputed food kings of the lot. My only change was to substitute London broil for flank steak. I put the steaks on the grill cursing the wind all the way but didn't notice it was blowing their way. Their head grillmaster came walking my way, "What smells so good?" We talked for a bit and as I was flipping the meat here came the question. "Can I have your recipe?" Understand that for our group having Lufkin ask for your recipe is like getting waved over to Carson's desk. It means you nailed it. Fed about 20 people including some great guests from UCLA and everyone absolutely raved. Oh, I did make one other change. Optional melted mozzarella slices on top. Also served chimichurra on the side.

Did these for guests from UCLA at a Utah/UCLA tailgate and reviews were completely rave! Just changed a couple of things. I don't believe in reviewing unless I use the majority of the recipe. Used London Broil rather than Flank. Flank in my experience is so temperamental if you're one minute off you go from YES to shoe leather. Also we were cooking in 35 degree weather with 30 MPH winds that completely messed with the cooking. To me the marinade wasn't near enough. I followed the recipe and it was just enough to do the meat. So I did 1/2 wine, 1/2 soy for the veggies. We went through just under five pounds of meat for about 15 people. EXCELLENT!

Tried to follow the recipe exactly, except for two things: used NY steak, cooked on cast iron pan (I don't have a grill). I cooked one side of steak, then added vegetables to the pan as I flipped the steak. When the steak was done perfectly med-rare, the veggies were ready. Fabulous.

I tried this recipe for a barbecue party, with other main dishes. I used skirt steak instead because I like it better. The marinade was great - the meat turned out tender and succulent. I used a couple of francese loaves,filled them up with steak and peppers, then cut them into small sandwiches. It makes a LOT. Leftovers were great.

This is perfect for a party b/c you can make a lot and make it ahead of time. It's great at room temp or even cold the next day.

I did a search to surprise some friends who gave a longing and wistful description. I had to laugh at the 7 - 11 review! Good for you dearborn, though I still stand strong that you shouldn't rate a recipe when you've substituted ingredients, made changes and otherwised denigrated a recipe beyond recognition. I'm chuckling as I wonder if the wood was used in the recipe or as a coercion to consume the finished product!

Truly awesome! I used vidalia onions instead of red ones and used an indoor counter-top grill. These were easy to make and everyone in the family loved them!

Followed the cue on using fajitas instead of french bread. Good call. This was my first time grilling and found this recipe fool proof. On top of it being the first time I invied guest for a 4th of July celebration and used this recipe with the hope for a mexican style twist now that we live in San Antonio, TX!!! All of us thought this dish was outstanding! No other changes needed. Loved the vegitables too!!!

I have been making this dish for years and to rave reviews! Wonderful for a summer picnic by the pool...

I've been making this recipe for 10 years, but have modified how its eaten. The first time I found the bread was too much, so we serve it like fajitas ... passing tortillas, sour cream, and guacamole. It is always a great crowd pleaser and I have yet to serve it without someone asking for the recipe!

These were delicious and easy on the cook, as my husband did the grilling. I think I will try "pan grilling" the vegetables next time, just for the sake of time. Then your meat and your vegies are done at the same time (unless you have a barbeque grill larger than mine).

I made this yesterday for a Father's Day Gathering for 6 adults and 3 children. Our flank steaks totalled just under 4 lbs. I thought I would have way to much meat but I grilled it up anyway. It was so good that everyone went back for more. There were no leftovers. Very easy to make and very yummy.

I made these sandwiches for a family lunch, and everyone loved them. They are excellent with grainy mustard. I made a trial batch for my husband and I, and we thought it was a little salty, so I used reduced-sodium soy sauce. It turned out very well. The meat was very tender. I added a few chicken breasts, also, and they were good, as were the grilled peppers and onions. Great to feed a crowd!
