What do with leftover egg yolks on a rainy Sunday? This recipe! It was quick and easy to make and proved a delicious alternative to chocolate or vanilla. I used all whipping cream because I had no milk and it turned out great. Like other reviewers, I would suggest a nice sprinkle of sea salt. Yum-E!

These turned out exquisite! Probably the most important component in this recipe is making the caramel. The rule of thumb that I've found most reliable for heating caramel is to wait until the mixture turns the color of a copper penny and just begins to smoke. Cooking any less results in a caramel was less developed flavor. Cooking even briefly more results in a burned, bitter mixture. At that point, remove from the heat immediately and have the whipping cream and milk ready to pour in. If the mixture binds up as another reviewer mentioned, return the pot to the heat and stir until the caramel has fully dissolved. I also found that these were fully cooked at 55 minutes. Don't overcook these or I'm assuming they will dry out a bit. I will definitely be making these over and over again! 5 stars!

These are soooo delicious. I used all heavy cream. I needed to cook the sugar longer before it turned caramel enough, and I took it off just shy of being just right since it would keep cooking. I had to work with it a bit after adding the cream, I wonder if adding warm cream would be better than chilled, if it would bind up less. I was not wild about the foam on top, did anyone else try to take that off? It was so creamy underneath though, and we sprinkled french sea salt on top which made it perfect.

I haven't made this yet, but I was looking over it and I thought I was missing something as well. But at a closer look I think they're trying to say, "Gradually whisk in 11/2 cups cream and [1/2 cups] milk..." I hope that helps, and I'll let you know how it comes out!

I thought the caramel solution used in this recipe was way too saturated with sugar. The end product seemed extremely sweet. I think it would be better with less sugar in the caramel process, but other than that, it does look good. Mine also were completely set by 45-50 minutes in the oven.

I have made this recipe a million times & it is one of my all-time favorites (I love any custard-y desserts). However, I add an extra egg yolk & use all heavy cream- no milk. Bad for your arteries, good for your soul.

Great dessert! Rich and satisfying. I was looking for a good creme brulee or caramel dessert for my Mediterranean and Sri Lankan friends who love this type of dessert.

I liked this recipe very much. My only problem was that they baked much faster than the recipe suggested. Maybe it was my oven, but I checked them after 50 minutes and they were over-done (almost completely set). They still tasted great. Since I made them just for my husband and me, I experimented with the extras, adding a few drops of natural orange extract (from Penzeys). The ones with the orange were bettter than the plain caramel.

Very easy recipe but my guests loved it. Watch boiling so as not to burn. Although 100% whippping cream is best, I sometimes substitute with some half and half.

I would just like to comment on the previous review about the misunderstanding of the recipe. The recipe calls for 1 and 3/4 cups of cream and 1/2 cup of milk. Yes the total liquid is 2 and 1/4 cups. But in the directions, it says add in 1 and 1/2 cups of cream and milk. It should say 'and THE milk' meaning you add 1 and 1/2 of cream AND 1/2 cup of milk leaving the 1/4 cup of cream for the whipped cream on top. Yes, perhaps it is a bit ambiguous but if you read it again it should become clear. Good luck making it again. I haven't made this yet but it will be my husband's birthday dessert next month. :)

in answer to your question....it says add 11/2 c of cream....and the milk....and save 1/4 c of the cream for topping...

Sounds good, but am I missing something? There seems to be 1/2 cup of milk/cream not accounted for (there's a total of 2-1/4 cups, you initially add 1-1/2 and save 1/4 of the cream for the topping). Can anyone figure this out?
