Simple and easy to make. straining was slow, but we let the sediment settle and then tore the sides of the towel. Used Heineken and felt that the stronger beer gave it more zip. Used 2 shallots too.

Soaking for a while means overnight... on corn starch, under water... bon appetit!

Jersey shore is almost perfectly right... but a little New England secret is to let the clams hang out in corn starch (under water, of course) like making your own little beach for a while. They kick out the sand and eat the corn starch so no crunching while you eat!

User who complained of steamers being sandy--before cooking them, you need to rinse the clams in water a few times, letting them soak for a few minutes, so that they expell the sand. Two rinses, changing the water each time, should do it. The broth and butter are for flavor, not for rinsing off the sand :)

I have made this several times and it is always an outstanding hit. This is one of those can't lose, nobrainer recipes.

Made a mistake. Used pale ale NOT lager.

These were better than I expected. Used a German lager and a minced onion because it's what I had on hand. I too served the butter seperately from the broth. This would be great with a nice side salad and crusty bread for a light summer night dinner.

Very quick and great steamers dish. This is the best steamers recipe I have made. I strained the cooking liquid to use as the 'wash' for the steamers and made the butter separately because steamers have alot of fine sand inside and need 2 dunks, one in the steamer water and then in butter. Great recipe.

I don't eat sea creatures but I made these for hubby and my 7 year old son. They both claimed them to be "great!". I forgot to add the salt at the end, but it didn't seem like they missed it.

Really delicious but a little salty -- I would not add the 1/4 tsp of salt at the end again.

This was my first attempt at fresh clams. They were wonderful. I am making them for the third time tonight. My supper club couldn't get enough. More people should try this recipe. It is just delicious and so easy to prepare.

i do not like clams but i really liked these clams. the rest of the crowd, all steamer experts, loved it, too. how does the lady from folsom, ca cut back on the salt, it only calls for 1/4 tsp?

Delicious! Lots of flavor. My husband and I dewvoured them. I will cut back on the salt next time as the clams already have enough salt for me.
