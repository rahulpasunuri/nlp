Well, of course this isn't like an "authentic" Mexican tamale. It's a cornmeal tamale and, as such, is very good. You can find cornmeal tamales all over the place: Mississippi, Texas, Chicago, etc. They're a different take on tamales and good in their own right. Don't make this recipe expecting Mexican-style tamales. They're not.

Tamales are the best to make and there are so many different items you could put in them. The masa is the key to great mexican tamales.....

I don't know, but this recipe is to Tex-Mex as canned chop suey is to Chinese. Of course I am a native of San Antonio and around here corn shucks are abundant, provide a better taste and are so much easier to use rather than cutting parchment paper into strips. Also would suggest looking for Quaker Masa Harina in the store. This recipe is more like taco meat in a corn bread shell rather than a true tamale.
