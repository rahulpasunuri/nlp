These are a tasty, healthy snack and people really appreciate it when you make homemade chips. They are great with hummus and easy to put together. (sidenote to Epi-snobs: This site is great because it has recipes for the most basic preparations to the most complicated dishes. Get that stick out of there, you'll be more pleasant people.)

This makes the perfect snack. You can eat them alone or to scoop up dips. It definitely beats buying store bought pita chips when you can have flavorful warm chips whenever you want :)

The perfect appy with hummus, eggplant, or red pepper dips. Cutting the pitas appart sounds easy, but take care not to break them. I like the curry/salt topping. Excellent!

This is a tasty variation on the pita chips I usually make. I brush mine with melted butter & sprinkle with either parmesan or Queen Victoria brand "Guisti Aromi per Bruschetta". I usually have to hide them while I'm cooking the batch or I'm left with just the last pan. However, if you make them with PAM, you will have plenty of leftovers. Sorry.

It is another yummy way of personalizing your pita. The desire to make it low fat is the problem. In order to keep that quality and keep the spices on the finished product, I suggest you dampen the bread slightly, using mister or brush, before applying spices. It will need a tad more cooking but the spices should stick or embed themselves.

I don't know who is more annoying: the snobs who think recipes like this are "beneath" their culinary skills; or the idiots who have to have every recipe spelled out for them like they are children. Recipes are just guidelines (except when baking) - intended to point you in the right direction, and hopefully, inspire your imagination.

There is actually an error in this: according to the magazine, the salt, cumin and chili powder are the flavorings for different chips, made with corn tortillas. This recipe only lists the salt and Madras curry with the pita.

This is another variation of pita chips. Other ones on this site call for brushing on olive oil + seasonings. Every time I make these (or another version of these) I get asked for the recipe. Seems people like the change of the same old same old chips & salsa. I wonder how spraying on Pam would be for those watching fat. Hmm. Will give that a try next time.

I agree with the reviewer before me, it is nice to have suggestions, etc. Recipe or not, I liked the suggestion and now can make my own Pita chips when I make the chipolte hummus (from the oct. 01 bon appetit), I would browse through the store for pita chips and could never quite find one I liked very well to go with that particular hummus.

This is one that can be shared with people on Weight Watchers. It is great to see more Rx that can be used by health and/or weight conscious people. Suggestion: Try Pam or other olive oil spray to help seasonings stick before toasting.

Funny that people were so against this being a recipe... I thought it was great.. and its nice to have suggestions to go with things, I believe if you read the magazine it is listed to go along with dips... nice addition instead of plain old chips.

Using Calgary's suggestion, I brushed the pitas with water, and seasoned. They came out pretty good; and they were great with the GARBANZO BEAN-CUMIN DIP. The Rude opinions posted earlier indicate a questionable up-bringing. With regards to food, Children are typically thought two things, at least. One, always try your food before you decide you don't like it. Two, should you dislike the food on your plate, do not make rude remarks concerning it. Please, don't spoil this site with your rude behavior.

I make pita chips by brushing them with salted water then baking. The baking crips them back up and the seasoning sticks. You could do the same with the curry.

I haven't tried this yet, but def will for nibblies for a party, especially w a Houmous dip. I just wanted to tell Portland, LA and A Cook that rated this recipe blah to stop their nose from pointing upwards and actually try it. These recipes are ideas for cooks to try if they fancy it, they are not set in the 'gourmet' stone

These are tastey and quick. especially handy for unexpected company. great with hummus. needs to be brushed with a little oil to hold the seasoning. Good stuff dosn't have to be elaborate.

This is NOT a recipe! At most, it is only a serving suggestion. How did thi make the editorial cut into the Epicurious Recipe Flash email???

This just sounds yucky. Epicurious should just remove it from their website.

hard to call that a recipe for 'curry pita chips'. why not just call it pita chips and say that folks can try different things on them, like say madras curry powder...chesapeake crab seasoning...cumin, etc.
