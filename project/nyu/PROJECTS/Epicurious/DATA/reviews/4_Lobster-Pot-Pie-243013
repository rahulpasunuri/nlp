Made last night with frozen lobster tails which I defrosted quickly and then steamed just till barely done. Made the sauce as directed, except followed other reviewers tip to saute finely chopped shallot, celery and I added finely chopped red pepper. Then remaining 2T of butter, etc. I also added some Old Bay per another reviewer. Added fresh herbs to the Ritz topping. Rich but delish.

Definitely needed something a little more, so I added a shallot (didn't have an onion) and some celery to the intital cream sauce and also ended up throwing some Old Bay on the top before the crust. Most old Maine lobster recipes with sherry say to let it sit for at least 4-6 hours (some as long as 2 days!) before reheating, so I had it sit for about 8 hours. Not sure if it made a difference (I'll update this note when I make it again, if it sits shorter), but everyone loved it and it was really easy to make since I bought the meat already cooked. Also, I used whole wheat Ritz. Again, not sure if it made a huge difference, but definitely didn't seem to do any harm.

This was a huge crowd please and simple enough to make on a weekday night. I followed the modifications others noted- substituted half & half for the cream and also added 2 small potatoes and 2 handfuls of shiitake mushrooms, which added more flavor and interest. One of my guests is gluten-free, so I used frozen puff pastry (gluten free) and it was delicious.

Perfection needs to be a category for this recipe! It is so delicious that you have to try very hard not to lick the plate. I have tried it with lobster and with shrimp. And for my non fish eating daughter, I am going to try it with chicken. I think that it will be just as good. I did change it a tad, naturally. I used canned milk instead of cream and thickened it a little bit. Then I served it over brown rice. I have been making it in a casserole dish instead of the ramekins. I think that my family would have it every night.

Rich and decadent and, oh, so good. The flavors are classic and satisfying. I considered replacing the Ritz with panko and am glad to have used the crackers. Finely crushed they were not identifiable and their distinctive flavor complemented the others. I didn't have a full four cups of lobster so I added quartered baby bellas (sauted first) and boiled potatoes cut into cubes about the same size as the chunks of lobster. When I make this dish again I think I will use the potatoes and mushrooms with the lobster because they break up the over-the-top richness of the dish if it were made only with lobster. An easy, tasty indulgence (caloric)that I would serve to guests.

This was an amazing dish! I (as recommended by others) used the puff pastry instead of the cracker crumbs. I also added 8 oz. of baby bella mushrooms and shredded gruyere cheese to the lobster sauce. I will definitely make this again!

very easy good recipe for a luncheon. For the sake of reducing fat, I used half and half instead of cream and no one could tell the difference. I also used langostinos instead of lobsters, didn't have to shell, etc... I used homemade bread crumbs and didn't add the butter to it. All present asked for the recipe!

Didn't expect this dish to be so simple. I only made a couple of subs, 2 T. calvados for the sherry, and a teaspoon of Penzey's Four Spice for the nutmeg flavor. Didn't have cream, so I used a little half and half and a lot of whole milk. Cooked up just fine. Next time I'll do as others here and use the puff pastry for an elegant dinner.

I made this for a National Pie Day party this past weekend and everyone loved it. I added the following to suit my tastes: 1. 1 whole yellow onion (minced) 2. 2 stalks of celery (minced) 3. 2 small potatoes (boiled and finely chopped) This was all added to the Lobster cream sauce. For the sake of the themed party I used a ready-made pie crust instead of the ramekins and topped with puff pastry and baked accordingly!

Very easy and delicious. Like other reviewers I reduced the sherry by half and added a 1/4 cup of fish stock which did add depth (Sherry and cream is not enough). I also used pastry instead of crackers. I served this as a first course for brunch and it was the highlight of the meal. The ooohs and ahhhs were never ending! I will definitely be adding this to my entertaining repertoire.

All ingredients except the cracker topping work perfectly together. Will use pastry next time

We made this for the 1st course for Thanksgiving and this recipe upstaged the Turkey. I did however modify the sauce. I made the sauce using a cream Béchamel. I included a stock from the lobster shells, celery and onion reduced and strained. The stock adds depth of flavor. Next time I will use a bit less sherry. If you want to impress this one will do it.

This is delicious and so easy to make. I made only one change, out of necessity. Shop Rite had lobsters on sale and I had purchased two that were a little more than one pound each. I boiled them both and held the smaller one aside with the idea of making lobster salad the next day. Instead, I saw this recipe and decided to try it. I reduced the recipe to make one serving but didn't have enough lobster meat to make a cup, so I added 2 - 3 sliced baby bella mushrooms. I also opted for a puff pastry topping that was brushed with butter. All other ingredients and procedures were as shown in the recipe. I would definitely serve this to family and friends.

I used smaller ramekins and served it as a first course surrounded by greens. I also used homemade lobster butter to intensify the lobster component. I topped the dish with panko as I wanted just the lobster to shine. Very very nice.

Easy recipe and highly adaptable. I could not get lobster and instead I used lump crabmeat. I also used hot paprika, added some pea, sliced thin baby carrots and a little minced sweet onion. I also used puff pastry. At 20 mins, the pastry was golden brown and nicely puffed. If you don't like having to deal with pastry sheets, you can also use ready to bake biscuits, like Pillsbury's as your "puff pastry" cover. I will definitely make this again.

I forgot to mention that I used Puff Pastry instead of the crackers.

I made this last night for a New Years Eve dinner with good friends. Everyone absolutely loved it! I did use 2 cups of fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and only 1 cup of heavy cream. You could not tell the difference. I also took the suggestion to add Old Bay Seasoning, a generous 1/2 tsp. I also had some of the cream mixture left, so today I am making cream of mushroom soup with it. I thought it was worth the expense, and I even bought individual gratin dishes. This will stay on my "Special Occassion" list.

We loved this dish!!! I had some extra lobster meat from our usual boiled lobster meal so I made this recipe. What a wonder meal of leftovers! Sooo delicious!!!!

This recipe has some of my favorite things -- sherry, cream, lobster. I expected to love it. I made it as directed (with two very slight exceptions, I used regular 8-oz ramekins -- not sure what "shallow" ramekins are, and I made 2 with the Ritz cracker topping and 2 with puff pastry. Even though my sauce was quite thick, I had about a cup of excess sauce that would not fit in the ramekins. I did not like the Ritz cracker topping at all. It was too much. And the balance of flavors in the sauce was way off. I love sherry, but the sherry flavor was overpowering. I spent more than $50 on this recipe (!) and it was such a disappointment. I may try to play with the recipe using shrimp and scallops but no way will I waste good lobster on this.

I'm a traditionalist so I used puff pastry instead of the crumb topping. I also enhanced the flavor of the sauce by "toasting" the minute amount of paprika in the microwave for about 12 seconds--enough to warm but not burn it.

I added equal Old Bay to equal paprika, a pinch of marjoram, used cod and scallops and added a quarter cup of grated stout cheddar to the sauce. Also substituted half cup 1/2 and 1/2 and half cup 2% milk, and it was scrumptious. Decadent and kind of sexy. Serve with champagne, Piper-Heidsick, preferably.

Yummier than I expected! I added a little extra spice - onion and garlic powder - and it was delicious!
