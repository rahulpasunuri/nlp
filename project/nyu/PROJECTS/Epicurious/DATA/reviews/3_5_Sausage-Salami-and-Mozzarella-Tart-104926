This recipe is great for a winter evening. I used hard salami instead of genoa. I also used a frozen deep dish pie crust, so there was no problem with overflowing or leaking. I did follow the cook time suggestions in other reviews and baked it for 30 minutes at 400 F and then an extra 5 minutes at 350 F to get the center to set. Overall, a great dish, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

I found this to be absolutely exceptional. I have made a few tarts in my time, I used a 9" pottery tart pan and a homemade pie crust from another Epicurious recipe. The fresh basil took it over the top. Had no problems with leakage, burning, or anything else. Fantastic! Definitely can't wait to make it again.

The tart leaked, like everyone elses. Taste was okay, but not great. I felt it needed some punch - maybe sun-dried tomatoes and extra seasoning like oregano.

Made this for a baby shower - everyone was a little unsure (meat in pie form) but after one bold person tried it the rest of the tart flew away into the stomachs of happy party goers. I've made this MANY times since. Great flavor, quite rich - perfect as a host gift or holiday meal.

This quiche was perfect for brunch and quite "meaty". The flavors of the salami, sausage, cheeses and basil were very tasty. However, after 35 minutes at 400 degrees, the top of the tart and the edges of the crust were quite brown but the inside was still not cooked. At the suggestion of my guest who is a chef, I lowered the temp to 325(to cut down on continued browning) and baked it another 20 minutes until the filling had set. Next time I would definitely bake it at a lower temp for a longer time to prevent this problem.

SMASH hit at a baby shower (Italian themed brunch). The ladies loved it and the men (yep..there were men there) barely left crumbs. Everyone who left tips in their reviews on this dish really helped me out and this was one of few dishes that went off without a hitch. Very happy, very satisfied. Thanks!

Easy to make, and especially delicious. I used a 9" springform pan, which worked perfectly. I also added sliced fresh plum tomatoes on top before baking, which added some color and a little taste contrast. I will definitely make this again.

Sooo good and so easy! I've made it half a dozen times now and I've never had problems with it leaking at all. There was more egg mixture and meat mixture than needed, so I just put enough in to come up about 1/4 inch from top of crust. If you fill it too much, the egg will overflow as it expands and leak down the outside of the crust, so less is better for filling it. The last time I made this, I dropped my baked tart shell, breaking it all over the floor, 20 minutes before guests were due to arrive!! I buttered a 9" pie plate, poured the filling in, baked for 20 minutes and served it as a delicious frittata. There were no leftovers, and lots of raves. I also added sun-dried tomatoes and extra sausage. YUMMYY

This was easy and delicious. Everyone wanted the recipe. I would suggest not putting in all the filling, it will overflow. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious, I didn't have four eggs, only two, so there wasn't a problem with leaking. I would definitely make again, as a light dinner or brunch.

It actually turned out perfect thanks to all the advice in the reviews, but I found it to be just "O.K.". It would definately be most appropriate as a brunch item. It wasn't bad, but I have been spoiled by Epicurious recipes, and have come to expect only the best.

Very tasty, very easy, and quite attractive. I did wrap the tart pan in foil and was careful not to over-prick (and sort of careful not to overfill, although I could have been more diligent about that...) Definitely will make it again.

I don't like eggy things, so I don't know why I tried this. The crust leaked like a sieve the first try. I thought there was too much meat filling for my pan, so I didn't put it all in and made a second crust, but the meat does shrink so it probably would have been okay. The leaking egg mixture was gross, like scrambled egg stuck to the crust. On the second try, I lined the crust with cheese, but it didn't help. No one asked ME for the recipe!!!

VERY flavorful. I used it as a party appetizer. Be diligent that there are no holes/breaks in the crust and don't pierce the crust with a fork too many times or you'll have the egg custard ooze out and make a mess! As a precaution, I wrapped a sheet of foil under the tart pan.

This was a nice appetizer. Would be perfect for brunch. I thought a bit salty with the salami and sausage. I added a bit of sour cream for a nice texture. Guests loved it!

Taste and texture very nice.

This one was a crowd-pleaser. I used regular pie plates instead of a tart pan and just cut it in thin slices. I did not add all the custard mixture - it would have been too much. I had to make copies of the recipe to hand out before the guests left!

I had a problem with the egg mixture running right through the pie crust and out the bottom of the pan and onto the oven, so it was quite dry. (Probably from piercing the crust with a fork) and tart pans have that space between the bottom and the sides. I would either line the pan or use a large pie pan

We thought this recipe was delicious. I followed it exactly and had great results. The only problem I had was the "custard" bubbled over in the oven????

I've made many brunch quiches and tarts -- this is the best one yet. I had to cook the tart for an additional 15 minutes but it came out great! The combination of sausage, salame (I used Genoa as recommended), and fresh basil was very nice. And the fact that the recipe called for an already-made pie crust made the tart quick and easy.

Delicious, and very easy to make. Planning on making it again for a brunch.

We thought this was great - made the recipe to a "T". It's since inspired me to make other tarts and quiches.

Such an easy recipe for something so good! I used turkey sausage to cut down on the fat. It still was delicious. Perfect for brunch.
