Not a pretty dish but certainly tasty. I added a dash (or two:) of chipotle chili powder and a little less salt.

more work than it was worth for the final flavor.

Great for breakfast just have to plan ahead. I cut the onion down to 1/4 cup diced really small and it was not overpowering. I found it too salty so next time I will cut the salt in 1/2 and see. I also added a tbls grated cheese on top of each cake for the last few minutes as suggested by another reader and it added to the flavours.

Way too much onion for my liking. Followed recipe exactly and all I tasted was onion. Tried it a 2nd time with only 1/4 cup of diced onion -- much better. Cakes cooked more evenly when made in smaller size. Finally, I also reduced oven temp 400 to start, then down to 350. For the smaller cakes they were done in under 45 minutes.

Okay. Maybe it's me. Whenever I make any potato recipe from Epicurious that isn't mashed in a bowl or baked in a dish, it turns out to be a gigantic pile of mush on the baking sheet. About 5% of these held together like they were supposed to. The flavor? Potatoes and onions, simply put. :-p

While we did enjoy these potatoes, we found that they were far too salty. We will make them again but will cut down the salt.

These were supremely delicious and really easy. I made it easy on myself and after letting the potatoes rest with the salt I put them all in a clean dishtowel and squeezed out all the moisture---super-simple and super-delicious. Had them both at Thanksgiving AND Christmas.

These were really yummy, but they stuck to the pan really bad and by no fault of the recipe they turned brown because I shredded the potatoes the night before to save time on Christmas morning. When I make this again I think I will use the frozen potato shreds in the freezer isle and see how that does. I also added some shredded cheese on top before I served. It may be because I am from the South, but I have got to have cheese on my hashbrowns! :o)

Worked out well. Though I would reduce the oven temperature and not extract as much fluid next time from the potatoes which resulted in a more browned approach to this dish than was desired.

Wonderful as is, and outstanding topped with Sour Cream and Smoked Salmon!
