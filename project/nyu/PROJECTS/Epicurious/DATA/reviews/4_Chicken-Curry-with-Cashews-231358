Loved it. Overall fairly simple to make but delicious. I live in Colombia and because Cashews can be incredibly expensive here I switched to peanuts. Also I served over "cauliflower rice" - basically grated cauliflower with salt and pepper heated on a frying pan with a bit of sunflower seed oil. Great add!

I must have made this recipe 50 times in the last two years. I don't use yoghurt at all, instead I use 2 cans of coconut cream. It tastes ten times better and gives a creamy sweetness that's AMAZING :)

Delicious. No need for 1/2 stick of butter - 2 tblsp at the most. Used 1 1/2 Tblsp Garam Masala & 1 1/2 Tblsp regular curry powder. Tasted like Korma. I'll be making this over and over.

This is a great recipe. I have used either hazelnut butter or cashew butter in lieu of the cashews and it tastes great. Also one time I had no yogurt so used a can of coconut milk instead - still amazing.

This tastes good, looks disgusting so would never serve for company. Also it made me decide to never make Indian food again, instead I'll save it for eating out. Can't believe it has this many high ratings, was mediocre compared to our local restaurants.

I have lost count of how often I have made this recipe. It is one of our family's top 3 dishes. My extended family requests this often as does our church group. And the bonus is this - it fits into our "no processed food" lifestyle that we are trying to embrace.

I make this all the time and I love it! The only change I make is to add more spices but not much. LOVE THIS DISH! I hate brown rice but I serve this with brown rice because the flavor and texture hides the brown rice flavor and texture.

i've made this recipe more than ten times. it's great and foolproof! i leave out the cashews, b/c they're expensive and i think they're unnecessary, but otherwise i make it as written. it's great the night-of and makes wonderful leftovers. an amazing find!

This is my go-to curry recipe! I add a can of coconut milk along w/the tomatoes and it makes it sublime. I would definitely not like it as well w/out it. It's good w/potatoes & peas, too. I also add cilantro at the end. oh, and definitely a little brown sugar + some fesh lime juice. Yummalish.

This is great for the newbie (to curry) because all "real" curry from here on in will be better than this recipe. It only gets better from here. Judging from the large amount of 4 fork reviews there are ALOT of curry newbies out there. You are in for a TREAT cause REAL CURRY is where its at! Think cardamom, garlic, coriander, garlic, turmeric, garlic, lemongrass, garlic...you get the idea!

Fantastic. Subbed boneless skinless thighs because they are the best slow-cooked. Subbed nonfat Greek yogurt for whole-milk yogurt. The finer you can grind the cashews, the better. I make this in a Dutch oven and let it simmer in the oven for up to an hour at 375. This has become a weekly meal!

This is a really fantastic recipe but I did make some changes. I added more spices- garam masala and cumin as well as all the others used. I also substituted coconut milk for the yogurt and added it with the tomatoes and other ingredients and then simmered it together. I added the cashews at the end and then froze it and it was fantastic out of the freezer as well as fresh!

I've made this dish for years exactly as written and it's fantastic. Sometimes I substitute boneless chicken thighs or breasts. This evening I added steamed broccoli florets and sautéed zucchini and yellow squash chunks at the very end. It was a great variation and everyone said they liked it even better.

Tasty and simple curry that will be part of my regular rotation. I made it with boneless, skinless thighs instead of bone-in chicken which cut down on cooking time substantially. I would double the cayenne next time, and probably add some additional curry powder as well. I did double the garlic and used 0% greek yogurt, plus I added a little water while the chicken was braising to keep everything moist. A keeper.

I love making this dish. It tastes delicious and everyone we invite over to try it loves it. My friend who does not like curry loved it and even had a second helping of it. My boyfriend requests that I make this often. It's a keeper

Rating: 4
I don't mix meat and dairy, so instead of yogurt I added 1/2 can of lite coconut milk right after adding the tomatoes. Boneless breasts cooked too quickly and didn't absorb the flavor enough. Next time I will make the sauce, let it cool and pour it over the chicken in a baking pan. I'll let it sit a few hours in the fridge and then bake it with some fresh green beans added. Good easy curry recipe.

Wow! This recipe was amazing. I almost followed it to the t but I wanted a little more curry flavor so I increase this and I wanted a little more sauce so when I was cooking the chicken I added a little chicken stock. It took more time to reduced down but the sauce was amazing! Because it cooked longer, the chicken was fall off the bone tender and the flavors were great. My boyfriend is not normally a fan of left overs but enjoyed every time I warmed he was interested in what I was eating, and this normally does not happen. This is in my rotation or recipes!!! Oh, and I used non-fat greek yogurt and it tasted great!

Very good. I didn't have any chicken broth like some of the suggestions so I didn't use this, but I did add significantly more spices - probably 1/2 to 2/3 cup ginger, 4T curry powder, 1T garam masala, 3t cumin. I also substituted dried chili flakes for cayene. Worked well.

this dish is incredibly overrated on this site. it's good, but definitely not exceptional. for a standard evening meal? sure. entertaining for guests? not that impressive or interesting. a few notes from my experience: i used the whole-milk yogurt, but don't think you gain anything by using it. low-fat or non-fat greek yogurt would suffice. also, the ground up cashews add a grainy texture. i used a spice grinder, so the cashews were fairly fine, but if making again i would blend until as fine a powder as possible.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic & seemingly full proof recipie. I didn't have any onions around so instead I used some scallions and chives I happened to have around, I also didn't have the canned tomatoes, so I used some watered down some tomato paste. The ginger was a nice touch. This recipie is incredibly tasty wether you add the nuts and yogurt or not. Bon appetit!

Rating: 4
This had excellent flavour, I think or am guessing that those who thought it too bland, maybe to try a fresher, different curry. I used Greek Yogurt, added 1/2 l chicken broth and used olive oil instead of butter. I also added a pack of frozen Asian vegetables (the later I added along with the yogurt), heated up so that they were still just cooked. Served with whole wheat pasta, as I ran out of brown rice. Definitely a keeper.

no surprises here, great recipe. I upped the garlic, ginger, spices, added some peas and garbanzos. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. The only thing I would recommend would be adding the cashews as a garnish, not putting them in the curry, they lost their crunch and weren't noticeable.

Rating: 4
while I was making this recipe I thought it wouldn't turn out good when I found out the preparation call for adding the chicken without browning it first. Because I don't usually do a good job cutting a chicken in 10 pieces I had purchased 8 bone in chicken thighs with the skin to make this dish. At the last minute I decided to remove the skin from the thighs(surprisingly easy to do). Having chicken with skin simmering in the sauce didn't sound appealing to me. The end result was absolutely delicious. My son who is a super picky eater loved it and asked me to make this dish often.

I've been making this recipe regularly for the last couple years and it's always a big hit and SO delicious. I usually use skinless, boneless chicken thighs, but this recipe is so versatile that it's also great as a vegetable curry (tonight I made it with red and green bell peppers, sweet potato, cauliflower and chick peas). I do usually add 1 tsp. ground coriander and sometimes 1/2 tsp. garam masala along with the curry powder, cumin etc. I serve over brown rice. Overall just a great, quality, reliable recipe.

Absolutely loved this recipe but decided to slow cook it in my crock pot instead. I sauteed the onion, garlic, ginger, and added a diced red pepper, then added the spices. I put half of it into the crock pot and then quick seared the chicken breasts (which I sliced into cubes) with the rest. I then added it all to the crockpot adding the tomatoes and cilantro. I cooked it for the afternoon. Turned out amazing! The chicken was super tender and all the spices blended incredibly well. I waited to add the yogurt and cashews til the very end. This is an easy to make and delicious Indian dish. Definitely going to make again!

Excellent chicken curry. I followed some recommendations by adding extra curry and cumin, chick peas and cauliflower, and also used coconut milk (1/2 cup) instead of yogurt. It was delicious. I was worried at first that there wouldn't be enough sauce, but there was more than plenty after simmering. This is a great recipe to use as a base for chicken curry, and to experiment by adding different ingredients. I also reduced salt in recipe by only using 1/2-3/4 t of salt (instead of 2t), which was plenty.

I agree with the cook from L.A. I have made this twice and thought it was okay. The second time I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and would not recommend this. The broth diluted the intensity of the flavors which is one of the things this dish has going for it. I said I'd make it again but it would have to be a slow night.

This recipe was very good and the smell as it cooked was fantastic.My only suggestion would be to cut off any extra fat on the chicken. I had a particularly fat chicken and while not greasy, it seemed unhealthy to leave all the fat in the sauce.

If you want to make less, it's actually fine to use the same amt of sauce to less chicken (I used about 2 lbs thighs). I made jasmine rice with a little bit of chicken stock. I also added about a 1/4 cp or less chicken broth to the onions when the chicken is added-- I found the onion mix to be really dry. I also added a whole red bell pepper, 3xs garlic, 2xs ginger, 2xs cumin, and 2xs cayenne. I also mixed yogurt with coconut milk and some sour cream. I think after all is said and done, it probably doesn't really matter if you use coconut milk, sour cream or yogurt. But to be true to the dish, next time i will make it with just yogurt. The cashews I think add to the creaminess tho to leave some roughly chopped to top the dish is a nice touch.

Enjoyed this curry immensely, having followed the recipe, largely as given, the only substitution being chicken breasts for whole chicken.

Will definitely make again.

This meal is fabulous! I reduced salt to less than 1 tspn, figuring the diced tomatoes would add their own saltiness. Used plain greek yogurt (only kind sold in small quantities), added approx 1.75 lbs thin cut chicken breasts, chopping each cutlet into 4 pcs. Added additional shakes of the cay/cum/cur trio. This is soooo yummy, I had to write and rave!

I made this in the crock pot with beef instead of chicken. I tossed the beef pieces in flour before browning them in a pan with oil. Aside from the can of tomatoes, I added 10 small quartered tomatoes too. I used whole milk instead of the yogurt and added a lot of extra spice, including red pepper flakes and lime juice. I left this in the crock pot for a few hours...and it was delicious. I ended up with a cross between Indian and Thai flavors. The cashews added a LOT to the flavor and overall "restaurant" quality of the dish.

I tried this recipe today as written and was quite disappointed. My husband and I cook quite a bit of asian food and found that the spices weren't right.

I made this recipe after reading all the outstanding reviews. It was very tasty, but I did have problem with the yogurt curdling. I used Oiko greek yogurt which is non fat, but other posters had used non fat yogurts w/out a problem. Another change I made was to use less butter, and substitute some olive oil. But again other posters used olive oil and non fat yogurt and didn't mention curdling, so not sure what I did wrong. On the plus side, it had wonderful flavors, and tasted delicious with addition of some par boiled veggies. Also used skinless boneless chicken breasts cut into bit size portions, so cooking time was greatly reduced. I'd make again, but would not serve to company unless I was certain yogurt would blend and not curdle. Would using full fat yogurt have made a difference?

I made this last night (weeknight) as it seemed pretty simple and yummy. I wasn't disapointed. I did however sub. the yogourt for sour cream as the gas station store on the way home didn't have plain yogourt...it was a good choice. I also used half the amount of chicken and added potatos. The cashews were a nice touch. I will make again for a weeknight quick dinner.

I ended up with five good sized portions, two of which I froze for future use. YUM

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I read through some of the prior reviews and many doubled the tomatoes but didn't give a reason why. The dish makes its own liquid as it simmers while covered so there is no need for it unless you want a curry heavy on tomato flavor. I made a couple of changes: I used skinless thighs with bones (10 of them) and it took 40 minutes to cook. I also doubled the garlic and ginger. Lastly, I realized I only had fat free plain yogurt on hand so I used sour cream instead- no curdling issues like others had. Everything else I did as written. There was enough cayenne for a slight zing, however if you are adding in all sorts of extra liquids you will need to adjust accordingly. My suggestion to others would be use whatever chicken parts you want and double the ginger and garlic. I will make it again in the exact same manner!

This recipe is incredible! Despite the 557 other rave reviews, I signed up just to add my voice. As for the dish, I didn't have cilantro, cumin or cayenne. I also substituted ghee for butter, and coconut milk for yogurt. I added more ginger and would even add more next time. As others have commented, I didn't notice the cashew flavour when ground. Next time I will coarsely chop them for texture and taste, but the dish would be great with cashews omitted. Will definitely make for guests next time!

I took many of the recommendations from other people: upped the amount of garlic & ginger, doubled the tomatoes, and added a little coconut milk (which was good for the liquid anyway). Also, rather than a whole chicken cut up, I used 3 half chicken breasts, 3 legs, 3 thighs, mostly with skin removed (total weight ~3.75lbs); browned them in the Le Creuset and removed before I started the ginger, garlic & onions. Parboiled a bunch of veggies (3 sliced carrots, 1/2 box frozen peas, 2 diced medium red potatoes, and 1/2-3/4 cauliflower) and added them at the end. Something came up, so I ended up simmering the chicken for a lot longer, until the meat was starting to fall off the bones. One of those great fortuitous mistakes. I'll do all of that exactly the same next time! Finally, I forgot to add the cashews until we got around to seconds; didn't make that much difference.

Agree with most, best to double everything except the chicken. Best to add more vegies. Even after all that, it was not hot enough for us, so hot sauce. Also it took 50 not 40 min. to cook.

Rating: 4
This was incredible! I used two different curries- 2 tbsp of Maharajah Curry and 1 tbsp of Spicy Curry. I also cubed the chicken to make it cook faster (20 minutes, tops). Added a little extra garlic and cilantro for a kick, and served over basmati rice. Excellent dish!

Rating: 4
This dish was wonderfully flavorful. The sauce was of a great consistency. I did notice that the chicken was not cooked through after 40 minutes; it really needed an hour. I also only used half the recommended cayenne and this was plenty spicy. I probably cooked the sauce for 15 minutes after adding the yogurt until it thickened to our liking.

Yum! I really liked this mild curry, although I generally like my indian dishes to have a bit more depth. This recipe is perfect if you have never made a curry before. I doubled everything but the chicken and added some frozen peas roasted curried cauliflower. Next time I will use greek yogurt since I missed that tangy flavor.

Fantastic dish. I did 2 things differently-used bone-in chicken breasts and browned them well in separate pan before adding to rest of ingredients.

This dish was great. I try to include as many vegetables as possible with any dish while trying to stick to the integrity of the original recipe, so I did make a couple of revisions. I doubled the entire recipe except for the chicken, then added 6 small cubed par-boiled potatoes, 1 lb par-boiled peeled baby carrots and 1 lb frozen organic petite peas just before adding the tomatoes. I wil definitely make this again.

I agree with the previous reviewer, this recipe was a little bland. Needs more spice and heat...something was missing, but a good recipe for those with mild palates. This was very easy recipe to put together, so I would recommend it anyone who is looking for a mild curry recipe.

i was super excited to make this recipe, as 500+ reviewers cant be wrong! however it was extremely bland. the only changes i made, everyone else seemed to (added an extra T of curry and a 28oz can of tomatoes) Instead of adding yogurt, i added a can of coconut milk on a few people's suggestion, and it took out all the flavour. maybe i only needed the 3/4 cup to mirror the yogurt? and i added it 10-15 min from the end as well. did i mess up the order? anyway, i want to try again but if anyone has tips on how to change this, let me know!

I just made this tonight for my partner. It was easy as can be, and super tasty. I modified the recipe because we didn't need to make as much and because I didn't have all the ingredients. I cut everything in half, used almonds for cashews, fage 2% greek yogurt, ancho chile for cayenne and I didn't have any ginger or cilantro. Even with all these modifications it was super yummy, easy to make and it took way less than an hour.

superb. based on other reviews, i added 1 Tbl. extra curry powder (we like it on the hot side), 28-oz of canned tomatoes, and threw in some cauliflower and carrots towards the end.

This is a great base curry recipe. I play around with it a lot by adding the meat that I have on hand like the chicken thighs that are cooking in the sauce right now. I may add cardamom, cinnamon, coconut milk, lime - any good curry ingredient. What's great is even when none of this is added it is still good.

I only review recipes when something is unbelievably good, which it is, and in this case, I also can't believe how easy and quick it is, yet tastes as if it took all day to prepare. Used olive oil instead of butter (still delicious), half of a large packet of chicken thighs, used nonfat yogurt by mistake and added a squeeze of lemon. Outstanding!!

This is a delicious curry. For a quicker version I sauteed onions, ginger, garlic, and spices (adding a teaspoon of sugar) in olive oil until softened. Then added thinly sliced chicken breast and sauteed until just cooked through. Removed cooked chicken from skillet. Added match stick sized chopped veggies to skillet and cooked until slightly softened. I used carrots, zucchini, red pepper, fresh chopped tomato, and small broccoli florets. Added 1/2 cup beef or chix broth and 3/4 cup coconut milk and a splash of fish sauce. Cooked until sauce thickened and returned chicken to skillet until heated through. Served over basmati rice and sprinkled with finely chopped cashews and cilantro. YUM!

I love currys, and have many favorites from over the years, including another one with ground cashews. BUT, this one is just incredibly good, by far the best ever. The other recipe added the cashews at the beginning, whereas this one adds them at the end. The result is a nice sweetness that compliments the heat and other flavors. I'm very happy I tried it. Outstanding!

Here is my take: Protein, split chicken breast, boned and skined- bone saved for stock, skin reserved aromatics, extra garlic and ginger spices, extra chili made another wise in accordance with recipe. Rice brown jasmine rice, pilaf with render chicken fat from reserved skin Served with Great Lakes IPA Wife loved it try it on company next with less heat.

Yum. Easy to make and better than the Indian lunch buffet. I modified the recipe according to what I had on hand. Replaced yogurt with about 1/2 cup of cream. Added chicken broth for more sauce. Added zuchinni toward the end of the cooking time. Used only one onion. Served over basmatti rice cooked in coconut milk and topped with raisins and cilantro.

Rating: 4
This is delicious, and incredibly easy!!! I did this in the crock pot, after pre-cooking the onions/garlic/ginger. Just set it in the morning and when you get home at night the house is filled with fragrant curry and the meat is so tender. The cashews are the perfect addition.

Easy (compared to most curries) and delicious. I used boneless chicken thighs and 28oz of tomatoes instead of 14.5. Next time I will add an extra tbsp of curry powder because I thought it could use a little more curry flavor. Still, it was still amazing!

This is a wonderful recipe, easily made from non-exotic ingredients. I made a few changes: used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (like lots of sauce), upped the curry a bit to compensate for the extra tomato, added sliced carrot and small pieces of cauliflower in last 10-15 minutes, used low fat yogurt (fine). Served on basmati rice with mango salsa and extra yogurt. Yummy. Looking forward to the leftovers.

Rating: 4
Two words: Restaurant Quality! Just EXACTLY what I was looking for on a cold winter's night! A snap to make with all ingredients miraculously in my pantry! No complicated proceedures, but big flavor! My subs were using 5 chicken legs (husband's preference) and 2 boneless and skinless chicken breasts cut into big chunks (my preference). I used half butter and half canola oil. Only used half of the cayenne powder which was plenty for us. I used half of a big can of whole tomatoes and squeezed them through my hands on the way into the pot. With all the great sauce, I added three thinly sliced carrots and maybe 2 cups of leftover blanched green beans. I only wish I had added more! Added a great veggie contrast to the chicken. I also used nonfat Greek Yogurt (FAGE) which already tastes like whole fat to me. I am wondering if the cashews could be cut back or left out to save some calories. (Curry with cashews, I know!) The sauce was just so darn good even before adding those in. I could totally see making this vegetarian or with tofu, too. I know exactly what I am having for lunch tomorrow! Mmmmmm!

So freaking good. I've made it according to the recipe using chicken and yogurt, etc, but now I've had to become a vegan for health reasons, so I make a few changes and it's still just as good! I use a few tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil, whatever I have on hand. Instead of chicken, I use a can of chickpeas and I throw in some black kale. For the yogurt, I use coconut milk. It's delicious. Try it using the chickpeas for a vegetarian friend, and the coconut milk for a vegan. Even non-vegetarians/vegans will like it!

If I may, I'll answer the question I asked below about trying the recipe with shrimp instead of the chicken. I made it yesterday and it was terrific. Obviously, I didn't cook the shrimp anywhere near as long as the chicken so they didn't toughen up. And i used coconut milk (it's what I had on hand) instead of the yogurt. Delicious. It makes me appreciate what a versatile recipe this is. Another time I might try adding a touch of something sweet - pineapple chunks, for example. And or red pepper.

Rating: 3
This recipe is very punchy. I followed the recipe and it turned out well but it's very strong. This is not a mild or light curry whatsoever. Like others I would reduce the salt. Also the dish is tastier the next day, as the flavors seem to mellow and bind a bit more. It's a solid recipe, but not the best curry I've tasted.

you wanna know how good this recipe is? i don't particularly care for onions, curry or cashews and i made it 3 days in a row. i used half butter/half olive oil to cook up the first few ingredients, doubled the garlic and ginger, halved the salt and used chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces for last 10 or 15 mins and it was deeeeelicious. for a veg side, i roasted a pile of green beans with olive oil, cracked pepper & sea salt at 425 and tossed 'em on top. so freaking good!

If you like this type of food, you will like this recipe. I thought it was great! I loved the texture that came about because of the ground nuts at the end. It even tasted great without cilantro, which I love but didn't have on me. I would recommend making more sauce like others have suggested. Next time I'm going to try using the same base, but make it into a vegetable curry.

Wow. This was a huge hit, and not at all difficult. I did use greek yogurt, but it wasn't too thick.

I'm sure this recipe is adaptable to other main ingredients with minimal changes.

This was a great dish even with the substitution/omission of several key ingredients. I didn't have cashews, cilantro, fresh ginger, or yogurt, so I subbed peanuts, 1T ground ginger and sour cream.

This recipe has become a go-to for our household. Over time we've slightly modified it to suit our tastes in the following ways: (1) using fresh, instead of canned, tomatoes is much quicker and prevents any acidic, tinny taste too often accompanied by canned tomatoes and inadequate cooking time; (2) substituting cubed chicken breast for the mixed white and brown meats (reducing the cooking time to prevent drying); (3) adding either coconut milk in place of yogurt (as suggested by a previous reviewer, if I recall) or, when in a pinch, a few drops of coconut extract plus the yogurt the recipe calls for. The sweetness the coconut adds is too fantastic to miss. I've also found that any number of ground nuts will substitute nicely for cashews, if the larder so dictates.

I had to play with the recipe to get it to be up to par with good indian restaurants. For the final and best try, I used 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 yogurt, golden raisins and 1/2 madras curry, 1/2 regular curry. It's better but could use a little more boost still. Maybe using all coconut milk next time. Good enough to play around with and easy. I don't see how potatoes or other vegetables would add to it as others have done.

This is a great curry recipe! And i've made a lot of them. I used small pieces of chicken breasts without the skin and it cooked quicker.I also skipped on the butter and used olive oil instead which is by far better.I accompanied it with plain coucous and the next day with brown rice (yes...we had it two days in a row!). Will make again for sure.

Nice tastes, textures, color, leftover legs. The more clear, veggie, spiced Indian aspects would be muddled by addition of coconut milk, hence that would be something I avoid. I used raw cashews to make more lean, boneless/skinless chicken thighs as others, but would try dry roasting the cashews prior to grinding, and flash browning the chicken for a possibly richer taste profile. Definitely a keeper.

WOW! all I can say is YUMMY! I went a little lighter with this dish just b/c of personal preferance. I used 6 chicken breasts, cut down on the butter and added fresh veggies like 2 carrots, 2potatoes, and a bunch of green beans. I also did half lowfat plain yogurt and half low cal coconut milk!

I made this last night and it turned out quite well. I added some diced potatoes, but they didn't cook as quickly as I thought. Nex time I'd boil or microwave so that they're more tender. I also used diced chicken breasts which cooked faster. I used the recommended portions of spice and I thought mine had quite a bit of kick to it (runny nose as I eat the leftovers) so I may cut the cayenne in half. Only other sub was low fat coconut milk instead of yogurt, only b/c I had some in the pantry and wanted to use it. Overall, very tasty and will definitely add to my rotation.

Great! My wife and the kids loved it. Tonight I searched for a recipe to use up some frozen chicken breasts we had and I found this. It was fantastic but next time I'd go for either the whole chicken as written or else boneless thighs. In Canada we only seem to have the 28oz. size of canned tomatoes, so I used that and it was great to have the extra sauce. Also, I'm not a fan of cilantro so I left that out and it was still great. We had it with basmati. Next time I'd probably make a nice Persian tadiq, the crunchy potatoes would be perfect with this.

Sure, this recipe isn't anything out of the ordinary, but it's a snappy weeknight meal. (I think the 1.5 hour estimate is off the mark, but I brown my chicken longer so that I don't have to simmer quite so much). I serve it with raita and saffron basmati rice. A handy tip for making basmati rice: soak it for 30-60 minutes before boiling for more discretely separate grains.

We make this for great weeknight meals with boneless, skinless chicken thighs -- it is great with extra cayenne too. we keep chopped cashews in the pantry so we can get this on the table fast. it uses so many kitchen staples it is easy -- keep your ginger (whole or in chunks) in the freezer and defrost what you need.

I have made this dish several times for family and friends. It is definitely a winner. I will suggest, instead of boneless skinless breasts, use boneless skinless chicken thighs. Because of the dark meat, it actually falls apart after stewing. I also double the amount of curry power to give it an even bolder flavor.

Easy and delicious! As a personal preference, I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and because there are too many parts of a whole chicken that I don't eat, I'll use skinless chicken breasts next time. Served with mango chutney, chopped banana, diced oranges, and diced apples as condiments. YUMMY!

This is a great recipe - I've made it many times. I substituted chicken breast and used coconut milk instead of yogurt. I also added skinned eggplant in the last 15 minutes. Reduce cooking time when using chicken breast. My husband said it is the best curry he's ever had!! I think this curry will probably taste better the next day so it gives the flavours a chance to meld together.

Really good recipe! I made it for X-mas dinner and everyone loved it. Made a few changes. I baked the chicken and then shredded it, let the curry mixture simmer for about forty minutes, added carrots and used some curry paste as well as powder. I will add this recipe to my regulars for sure.

Yum! I love this recipe! I've made it different ways, and this time to make it a one pot meal w/ easy leftovers: 1.) I added carrots to the ginger, onion, garlic mix. 2.) I added two peeled, diced russet potatoes when I added the chicken. 3.) The chicken I added was actually about 1 1/2 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken breast cut into strips. 4.) Once the chicken was browned and the chicken and potatoes were coated, I threw in some fresh, chopped green beans. 5.) After I added the tomatoes and cilantro, I threw in some frozen peas and pearl onions. Other than that, I completely followed the recipe, and as always - this recipe is delicious.

I made this for the first time and I was so surprised how amazing it came out. I used fat free yogurt and I thought it was great. Next time I will try with coconut milk to compare

Wonderful. Used approximately 7 lbs of skinless, boneless chicken thighs and doubled all other ingredients. Browned the chicken ahead of time. Used McCormick hot madras curry powder so I omitted cayenne. Replaced the yogurt with a 14 oz can of coconut milk. Perfect.

This recipe is great! We made a healthier version with boneless, skinless checken breasts cut into thirds. Better for you and cooks quicker.

This is a great recipe but with one significant change. The chicken is essentially poached (there is no browning step). Poached chicken skin is not appetizing. The second time I made this I used skinless thighs rather than chicken pieces and it was much superior.

This is amazing...the wife and I both absolutely loved it! I used 3 lbs of cut up b/s breast pieces, so adjusted the spices and butter up a little. I didn't have much time, so just used a good madras curry powder. I thought this was about as good as most Indian restaurants' chicken khorma, even if it is a little less authentic.

Although my reading skills are supurb, I have both read the recipe AND made the dish and I must say that it is extremely good.

This is probably my bestest recipe, I have ever made. It is soooooo exotic without the work. Very simple and yet amazing taste. I use boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of cut up chicken. I have used almonds and pistachio nuts as well, all do the job.

I agree with the cook from LA: there are some very good pre-mixed curry powders available for when you don't have time to grind your own paste. Convenience is key sometimes. This dish is very good - I think my expectations may have been a little too high, but both my husband and I really enjoyed it (especially the next day). Maybe next time I'll save a little cilantro to add at the end - it lost its lovely bright flavor after being cooked for 40 minutes.

These reviews crack me up... I'm from India, so I have tasted and cooked some other curries before. But isn't that irrelevant ? To the point, I've made and tasted this recipe, which qualifies me to rate how much I like it. (And, I like it quite a bit! Not all curry powders are bad, you just have to use one that has the right spices for the meat you are using. (Fresh spice is always better but really, we don't all have time on a weeknight.) Just because it's not your naanii's best curry doesn't mean it can't be good. One small change: I only use thighs and drumsticks, so it was too oily. When the meat was done cooking (before adding yoghurt) I took out the chicken and chilled it and the sauce separately, and then skimmed the solidied fat off the top--I will save it to fry things. I reheated the chicken in the oven separately to make it more crispy, and the sauce still had plenty of fat left when reheated. My family loved this, and I plan to make it again! There are plenty good curries besides classic Indian ones--maybe this one can be a classic American curry.

To .. A Cook... Perhaps you should re-read my review. I've been cooking Indian Curries for many years with excellent results and 'Curry Powder' has never been an ingredient in any curry I've prepared. Curry paste would be a better choice than powder, but like I said in my previous review, there are numerous Indian websites out there with wonderful authentic curries made by roasting and grinding the seeds as needed. It may require a little more effort than opening a jar but the end result is uncomparable. My review was aimed at those who love Indian food and would love the chance to make an authentic curry. However, I think the curry powder is an excellent choice for you...enjoy!

After reading the recipe, I'm amazed that this recipe got the ratings it did. I've been cooking Indian and North African food for a number of years, with a library of over 500 cookbooks and with about 25 of those being "Indian" and "Moroccan", I can assure you that "curry powder" is not a listed ingredient in any of those cookbooks. I can understand how a person new to cooking 'Indian Cuisine' would think this recipe is great...BUT...if you really like this cuisine and want authentic recipes, there are hundreds of Indian websites out there with wonderful recipes that will amaze your palate...please give them a try!

A very tasty and unintimidating recipe. I had never cooked Indian food before, I usually stick to Italian and Mexican. Anyway, this was slightly time consuming but worth it. It came out very stew-like, which was delicious over rice. I used bone-in chicken thighs, and didn't grind the cashews all the way, I left them chunky. I will definitely make them again, I can't wait for the leftovers!

I loved this recipe. I followed it as written and it was very taste. I used hot curry to give the dish more zip. What a great idea to substitue the yogurt with coconut milk for a Thai flare. I also used boneless chicken breast and cut down the cooking time. Excellent!

Well, I am NOT a big fan of overwhelming Curry Flavor, so I halved that. I swapped out a lot too and it came out AMAZING. Ginger I used Candied, soft & Sweet. Tomato: I used a can of Sauce. Almonds instead of Cashews. Ground Chicken; so it was more Stew-Like I added Sushi Rice with candied Ginger slivers as a side.

I have made this twice. The first time I thought it was very salty, but I made it a second time because I love curry and it keeps getting great reviews. I thought maybe since I had used the end of a jar of cashews that they had been particularly salty. The second time was better, but still on the salty side. (PS: I'm not the type of person that complains about salt all the time)

While this dish smelled deliciously like curry, it neither looked nor tasted particularly appetizing. The sauce refused to thicken and the yogurt didn't blend with the chicken stock, making for a white-flecked broth. Good luck...

Great Curry - but I didn't have much liquid so I added 1/2 can coconut milk and 1 cup chicken stock. I also took another reader's suggestion and added baby carrots, sliced potatoes and green peas. Used 1/2 boneless chicken breasts and 1/2 boneless thighs, sliced. Quick, easy and Delicious. Definitely a keeper!

I made this as written except that I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into two inch chunks and I didn't have cumin so I substituted 1 tsp of garam masala. I liked it a lot. I used raw, unsalted whole cashews. I put the cashews whole into my coffee grinder but they were getting stuck under the blade. I chopped them very roughly first and then they ground up easily. Next time I would use roasted cashew pieces. I think roasted would have a bit more flavor, but I really did like the addition of the cashews and felt it added a lot of interesting texture. I would also try coconut milk instead of yogurt. I think that would be perfect.

This the first time I made curry and it was great. I used skinless drumsticks and boneless skinless thighs. I took the advice of one cook and used RF coconut milk in the sauce and used the RF yogurt to for a tomato cucunber riata. The next time I will use just skinless legs and thighs and sprinkle the chopped cashews over a seerving of chicken. I think they get lost in the sauce and really didn' thicken it up that much.

I've probably made this recipe 20 times since discovering it. I'm pretty sure it's my husband's favorite food by now. It's very flexible so sub in boneless breasts or throw in veggies as you like. Excellent and also freezes well, even with the yogurt and nuts mixed in.

Since discovering this recipe in October I have made it at least ten times. I add carrots, green beans, zucchini and potatoes. And have alternated between yogurt and coconut milk. I've used this same recipe, minus the chicken,to make an awesome vegetarian curry that gets rave reviews from my male colleagues at work.

Delicious...Terrific recipe for anyone who would like to try their hand with curry. Next time I will make some "slight" adjustments, reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon,use 1/2 the yogurt and 1/2 cup or more of coconut milk. Serve with additional chopped cilantro, fresh or sweetened grated coconut, and diced fresh banana's to be used as toppings! Enjoy!

A great and easy recipe. I tweak it by not adding the yogurt. Sometimes (when I have it in the house) I add a can of coconut milk instead. I've also added cut up steamed potatoes (a local Thai restaurant adds them to their yellow curry). And I don't include cashews. Best served over jasmine rice!

We did not think this recipe was worth the time or money to make again. It was just o.k. We prefer a spicier, more pungent curry. I have a recipe for "Fragrant Beef Curry" that I got from a google search a few years back(it calls for Major Grey Chutney -very delicious recipe) that has been the standard by which we rate all other curries. We love nuts but I think the cashews took away from this recipe. To each his/her own - not for us.

Really delicious and easy curry. I did add some water (about a cup) to the dish prior to the 40 minutes of simmering. I thought it looked a little dry.

If you have been searching for a recipe that will give you chicken curry as good as the restaurants, this is it! I've made many different curry recipes, and this one tops them all.

I've made this twice now, and it was great both times. The first time was to be for myself, with leftovers to be shared with my wife when she returned a couple of days later. I didn't have the full amount of chicken, so it ended up quite spicy, probably too hot for many people, but it was still very tasty. Even so, my wife never got to try that batch as it disappeared from the fridge! I too added a little ground coriander with the other spices, and definitely reserve the fresh coriander to be added with the yogurt and cashews, just before serving. Also, I doubled the canned tomato. A note to those who don't like nuts, you really don't notice them as they're ground, and there are enough other flavours that you don't taste them either. Really quite tasty, and as expected, the flavours develop nicely if left for a day or two.

It's a 4 forker because everybody in the family enjoyed it and the simplicity of the recipe. I used coconut milk instead of yogurt, it was what I had on hand.

I tried many curry chicken recipes when I returned from overseas last year in this is by far the easiest and best. I use jar curry chili paste which adds as much hotness as I want and sub coconut milk for yogurt and serve over rice and beans (Jamaican style) and it's wonderful. The kids like it too.

Just delicious! The best curry I have made and I love curry. But can you believe it my grocery store had no cilantro. So I used mint instead and it was great. However I would add the cilantro (or mint!) both when the recipe calls for it and again when adding the cashews and yogurt. More flavor. I also served with a wedge of lime for squeezing atop. Very GOOD!!

This is a great recipe, but I will use skinless thighs the next time I make it. Because there is no browning step the skin diminished the quality of the dish.

Yum. This recipe is to die for. Because there is always so much sauce I take 5-6 lbs of whole chicken legs trimmed of excess skin, season them with salt and pepper and brown them in olive oil, searing the seasoning into the skin. I increase the dry spices a bit because we like the heat and add a extra dollop of yogurt and serve atop Basmati rice. Perfect every time.

This was by far the best curry I've made. Granted I haven't grown up making curries, but it was really quite good. I did find it quite spicy, but not overly so. I too reserve the fresh coriander(cilantro) until the end, adding it with the yogurt. Excellent with Naan bread and some mango chutney.

I made this dish for a buffet for 65 people. I used chunks of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and made it the day before, chilled it and reheated. Excellent-- everyone wanted the recipe. Definitely do not add the cashews, cilantro or yogurt until just before service, though.

Very good recipe, similar to my Indian mother's. Instead of adding yogurt to the sauce I marinated chicken pieces in low-fat plain yogurt with some ground coriander seeds, salt, and red chili powder before adding to the skillet (classic Indian method for more tender and flavorful meat). Added fresh cilantro at the end. I don't carry pre-made curry powder so I just toasted some cumin in oil before adding the onions, garlic, and ginger to the skillet (used olive oil instead of butter). Put this on pita bread for a delicious lunch, fewer calories than rice.

I have made this twice in the last month. My boyfriend and his friends (all from India) all loved it! The only change I made was I added the yogurt to taste rather than adding it all at once and ended up using less than called for (but we like our food a bit spicy). Will make this again and again!

Tastes just like takeout. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and Fage greek yogurt. Thick, fragrant, flavorful, and perfect on top of jasmine rice. Can't wait to make it again!

Not much to add to other positive reviews. One suggestion for those who have access to Middle Eastern grocery -- labne (aka yogurt cheese) works very well in place of whole milk yogurt. It creates a very creamy consistency and never separates as yogurts sometimes can. I just cut back on the quantity a bit (as it's completely drained and thus very intense).

We simply love this dish. My husband looks forward to the cold weather just so I will make it. I always use boneless and skinless chicken breast cut into chunks. I also had roasted, peeled and cubed Yukon Gold potatoes in the fridge and added them to the sauce after the chicken cooked through. Served with a mixture of Basmati and wild rices. Outstanding and makes excellent leftovers. Enjoy!

wonderful flavors! i used fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead, and a lot less butter....and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.left them whole and then when almost finished, i cut into cubes, added the yogurt (used non-fat), and cashews to finish. i also added green beans and mushrooms. definitely not needed though. just wanted to add some veggies. delicious!!!!!!! highly recommended. if you want to make it lower-fat just use a lot less butter and non-fat greek (fage) yogurt. did not sacrifice flavor at all!

I wish there was a five fork option! Fabulous and easy....who knew ground cashews and yogurt could add such a layer of decadence and depth? I made as directed, except used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I sliced up near the end of cooking and returned to the sauce. I think using a good quality whole milk yogurt (I used Straus organic) makes a big difference. SO GOOD!!!

This is such a great recipe. I made it with saffron rice and it was delectable. I accidently used salted butter, so after adding the salt the recipe called for it was a touch on the salty side. I'll make sure next time to use unsalted butter or reduce the salt I add to the recipe. I also used fat-free yougurt and raw cashews and it was great.

This was really tasty. I used 5 thick boneless chicken breasts, forgetting that the recipe called for 3 lbs with the bone in, so it looked like it might be too much chicken, but it wasn't. I cooked them whole, and didn't cut them up until they had cooked in the liquid for 30 mins...then cut them up and shredded some pieces (i like the texture of the shredded chicken), and then let it cook another 30 mins. I doubled the tomatoes and only put in 1/3 cup ground cashews. It was delicious, but the four forks came from the fact that it was so much better the next day. Something I am already craving again.

If having 342 review in less than a year and still having a rating of 93% isn't enough to convince you I don't know what is. The only change I made was to half the cayenne pepper for my 2 1/2 year old sake and I added chili paste to mine after it was served. Basmati rice was perfect with it and I can't wait to try it with tofu for my vegetarian friends. Oh and I used roasted salted cashews and it was awesome.

A great, rich curry that I've made time & time again, for company as well as just family. I usually use a mix of boneless breasts & thighs to make it easier to eat, so I brown the chicken, then remove it and add back into the sauce for a few minutes at the end of the cooking time.

I've made this dish three times in two weeks! It is truly outstanding! A few suggested changes: I accidentally doubled the cashew quantity. Try it - it's even better. Also, try using cubed chicken breast instead of whole pieces. The cooking time is faster, and the dish is easier to eat with no bones to deal with. Also, if you use 1/2 tsp of cayenne as the recipe indicates, understand that the dish will be very hot. (3 red peppers on the menu of your local Tai restaurant.) 1/3 tsp is about right for me... Lastly, the dish is even more amazing after its had a chance to "get happy" in the 'fridge over night. Try making it the day before and adding the cashews and yogurt before serving.

Very yummy. We have never made a curry dish before so we were a little worried if it would be okay, and we loved it. We used skinless chicken breast and plain (not roasted/salted) cashews. The only complaint I had was there was too much sauce but one extra piece of chicken would take care of that problem. It's in the make again folder!

DAH-LISH! We really enjoyed this one. The kids even ate it (without the sauce!) So little work for so much bang.

Rave reviews from local happy eaters for this recipe. Didn't have cashews on hand; peanuts & apricot mango yogurt worked out very well. Dittos on ewaltrs from San Francisco, CA on 01/24/06. Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs with excellent results.

This is AWESOME. the only thing i did differently was to use boneless, skinless thighs cut into small pieces. it reduced the cooking time and i don't like bones and skin. otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

A very simple and easy dish to make! What I do to faciliate the process however, is to bake the chicken in the oven for about 15-20 minutes @ 250 degrees while I prepare the other ingredients and then, when they are ready, I take the chicken out of the oven and put them into the pot. This cuts down the overall cooking time quite dramatically for me. Cheers & Happy Eating!

As someone who grew up with authentic curry dishes (being from Fiji originally) I thought this was alright but it isn't the best I've tried. I followed the recipe with minor differences. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs as that's what I had on hand and normally use in my curry dishes. I didn't have cilantro or cashews but I did use crushed almonds which added a nice texture and taste. Instead of using cayenne, I used red hot chili pepper flakes that I brought back from my last trip to Fiji. These added a real zing to the dish. I also used Patak's Madras curry paste instead of curry powder which also added to the spiciness which I prefer. Overall, this wasn't a bad dish. I think I was just disappointed because of the overhyped ratings. My husband really enjoyed it though but he's a born and bred Canadian so his palate is a little different. I would make this again because it is a tasty dish with basmati rice, mango chutney, and tamarind chutney mixed in, but my butter chicken is way better.

Rating: 4
I've made this a dozen times. Even my kid loves it! To do it quickly, I use boneless, skinless chicken breast. A large breast makes 2 dinners for my family of three, with a little sauce left over. My curry powder is fairly kicky, so I don't need the cayenne. And I use non-fat yogurt to mitigate the high-fat cashews just a bit. I'm going to make it with tofu, too.

The cashews and whole milk yogurt were key to this yummy dish. Everyone went back for another serving.

Almost as good as my favorite Indian restaurant. I made no changes other than using boneless breasts & thighs. I think I'll just use the thighs next time as their flavor better complements the sauce.

I have made this dish three or four times and it is a hit for everyone in the house including my five year old. I made it last night using bone-in skinless chicken thighs and added two cubed yukon gold potatoes at the same time as the chicken. I also added about 1/2 cup of frozen peas when I stirred in the yogurt and cashews. I agree with the reviewer that suggests to coarsely pulse half of the cashews for texture. Outstanding!

Made this last week for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I used cut up chicken pieces but this week will do just thighs for a potluck. My husband spent a year in India and was wary of my attempt at Indian cooking...but according to him this was "very authentic."

I would give this dish 3 1/2 forks. Not quite beyond compare but very good. I also doubled the amount of tomatoes and cut back a little on the chicken, using boneless breasts. I also brown fried the onions in the traditional indian manner before adding the garlic and ginger. I used the full amount of finely ground cashews for thickening but used extra chopped for a garnish. The only thing I didn't like about this dish was the cilantro cooked into it. The flavor stood out too much. That said, this won third place in our "White Boy Curry Cookoff." YUMMY!

This is terrific! I skipped the butter in lieu of 1 Tbs. olive oil, used powdered ginger (my fresh ginger was rubbery), used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1/2 c. cashews and used creme fraiche instead of yogurt. The only thing that could've made this recipe better was leaving half of the cashews in a coarse chop for textural interest. Otherwise, this was a HIT! Serve it over rice, as the sauce is delish!

This dish is foolproof. I've made it several times and it's outstandingly flavorful every time. Might be too spicy for some tastes, but it's just right for me. For a veggie option, substitute two cans drained chickpeas and a few cut-up potatoes. It's excellent!

I made this for a dinner party and it was an absolute hit. I added cauliflower and carrots and would definitely recommend veggies of some sort. I also used the Garam Masala that others have recommended (2 tbl curry and 1 tbl Garam Masala). It was not too spicy but a definite crowd pleaser.

I made this dish without the cashews and yogurt, and added a dollop of light sour cream at serving. It was a bit hit at my house. I will try it with the cashews, but I am not sure I would want the texture any different than it was. A perfect weeknight meal.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I prepared this last night and was shocked at how great it tasted and smelled - and it was relatively easy to prepare. I substituted light sour cream for the plain yogurt. I also added a bit less garlic than called for and a bit more onion than called for. I also cut back on the curry (it called for 3 tablespoons, but since I was also feeding this to young children, I cut the curry in half so it wouldn't be too spicy for them). This satisfied the craving I had for curry - and I will most certainly be making this dish again and again... You MUST try this one.

I reserve four forks for a dish that is a religious experience. This isn't that, but it is absolutely delicious and easy. Three and a half forks!! When I first added the can of tomatoes, I was concerned there wasn't enough liquid, but within five minutes there was plenty of liquid for the chicken to stew in. I also just chopped the cashews by hand, since I don't have a food processor. It worked out great. Highly recommend!!

I made this for my husband who needed a curry fix in a hurry (should be the name of a band), and he loved it. I didn't grind up my cashews as finely as the recipe recommends because I loved the presentation of them scattered over the top of the dish. Very good over basmati rice. A good one.

This is an excllent curry. I agree with the previous reviewer and suggest using boneless, skinless chicken thighs. To those who found this dish lacking in flavor, maybe it has to do with the quality of curry powder you used. I've found I have much better results with specialty curry powders from gourmet stores than with the mass market curry powders in most grocery stores.

Yummy - and easy! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they were super tender (cut w/ a fork and no grease from the skin)... However, the dish is not that spicy - so you can easily increase the cayenne if you so desire. (I did) Overall, great for a mid-week dinner that is a twist from the norm.

Rating: 4
Excellent, even the kids loved it. Make sure you are not using a "hot" curry as your sauce will end up way to hot!!! otherwise very very good and very pretty presentation, we used Jasmine rice. I also toasted the cashews and just threw them on top of the serving bowl, that is how we prefer the nuts...definate keeper and it is company quality.

This is the best curry I've ever had. When I make it, I make enough for lefovers and my husband and I literally squabble over divvying it up. I also think this would make a fine Crock-Pot dish. To the cook in Seattle: I'm convinced that it somehow went wrong for you because this dish isn't the least bit greasy and you can't detect the cashews at all if you grind them fine like the recipe says.

This was absolutely delicious. It is definitely wise to make this a day or so ahead of time to let the flavors mingle.

This is the easiest and best curry recipe I have ever made. I used chicken thighs and cut the salt and butter in half. I could not find cashews and plain yogurt in Cabo so substituted sour cream and ground peanuts. I used 1/2 half as much of that mixture because the peanut taste is so much stronger than cashew. My husband is a huge curry fan and thought that this recipe was the best he had ever tasted. Next time I make it I will plan ahead and have the cashews and plain yogurt on hand.

Rating: 2
I really didn't like very much about this. The flavor was bland and a bit greasy from the butter, and I particularly didn't like the texture of the ground cashews. Perhaps making it in advance would help blend the flavors, but we threw out the leftovers which is a rarity at my house. Won't make again.

Wow! This turned out delicious (I just finished up the leftovers...and they were better the next day).

I'll definitely make this one again!

I made the dish with soy nuts and soy yogurt, instead of whole milk yogurt and cashews. I think it probably taste better my way, and may be slightly healthier. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!!! We accompanied it by using Couscous with nuts and spices within. It was terrific! I wonder is dried ginger powder could be a decent alternative, because we had to make a special trip to the store for fresh ginger, just for a teaspoon full.

I've made this recipe several times and love it more and more. This last time I just went veggie with potatoes and peas and more spice. I advise to please try it with the yogourt.

Made it as written 1st- thought it was good. But I liked it better when I tried it again with half the cashews, and about twelve other deviations.

My husband declared this better than curry from a restaurant! I followed other cooks' advice and substituted light coconut milk for the yogurt & used 1.5 x spices (still not too spicy). I only used 2.5 lb. bone-in skinless chicken breasts but added a can of baby corn, 1 cup baby carrots, 2 peeled diced potatoes and I reserved 1/4 cup of the whole cashews rather than grinding them all. Left overs were even better. Can't wait to make this for friends!

If I had used a milder one, I definitely would have added it, it needs the kick.

My husband and I loved this dish. If you make it with boneless skinless breast chunks like I did, it only needs to simmer about 20 min instead of 40.

I make a recipe off epicurious almost daily. It is just part of my routine. Lots of recipes I choose are good, but this one was exceptional (if you like spicy asian food). The sauce is really very good. I didn't even have yogurt. I used about 2/3 cup sour cream and topped it off with heavy cream. I generally follow a low carb diet, but tonight I brought out the rice. This was worth the splurge. The sauce requires rice. Definately will make again and will try coconut milk and yogurt as suggested.

This was a huge hit and I'll be making it again soon. I don't think I'll change a thing, but I suppose for variety some more tomotoes and a bit more spice would be fine. I will definitely skip the coconut milk suggestion. Why add an expensive and unhealthy ingredient when the recipe is already perfect? I think the yogurt does a fine job of added a sweet mellow richness to the dish.

Declicious! Just made it for the second time. I use Sun Brand Madras curry powder and find it provides almost enough heat on its own (only added less than 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne).

Wow this is good! We've made it several times, and we use only chicken thighs, since we usually have those in the house.

What a fantastic curry dish. Full of flavor, texture & color. I followed others advice and used coconut milk versus yogurt, a large can of tomatoes (preferrably Muir Glen fire roasted-for a smoky flavor), used chicken thighs, and used Pataks mild curry paste (much better than powder). I also added two poblano peppers for some color (they're not as over-powering as green peppers). I loved the addition of cashews but should have left them in the processor longer. This is an awesome dish....

I used two cans of diced tomatoes and added an extra TBSP of curry powder and used a whole tsp of cayenne. We thought the heat was perfect! I'd leave out the cashews next time as I don't feel it added to the dish, yet adds a significant amount of fat and calories. I served it over coconut rice...fantastic!! Similar to some of the curry dishes I have sampled throughout the Caribbean!

I thought this was a good chicken curry, but I did not find it terribly different from other chicken curry recipes. I used Penzey's hot curry poweder and omitted the cayenne pepper since the curry powder was already hot. I think if I made this again, I'd try it with either a milder curry powder or I'd mix the hot curry powder with a mild curry powder. I couldn't really taste the cashews and I think that might be because the heat of the curry powder overwhelmed them.

Rating: 3
I love to cook Indian, and while this isn't the most authentic curry, it's a lot more reasonable to make on a work day then the real deal. Ignore the comments about using boneless chicke -- the bones keep the meat most & add flavor. If anything, I'd suggest just using all thighs for this & save the breasts for something more delicate. I found that you can just run the yoghurt & cashews in the blender to grind them to simplify things a bit.

Super easy, super delicious. Perfect balance of spice, texture, flavor. I've made lots of different curry dishes and this is my favorite so far. I like that it doesn't use coconut milk, so it doesn't taste like a "typical" curry. I used chicken thighs & legs only for more even cooking and b/c we prefer darker meat. Used 28 oz. can of tomatoes and 1 cup of whole milk Greek yogurt. My boyfriend almost ate the entire pot, so I will need to double the recipe next time!!

I doubled the recipe for an informal dinner party - substituting cubed skinless boneless chicken breasts for the whole chicken. Despite the fact that it made a lipping dutch-oven full of curry, by the end of the night, every bit was gone! Rave reviews. I used hot curry powder, and I also tied together the cilantro sprigs with kitchen string and simmered them in the curry - took them out before adding cashews/yogurt. (most of the flavor is in the stems.)

Delicious and a cinch to prepare! I used skinless chicken breasts (cut into chunks), margerine instead of butter and lowfat yougurt. It turned out great. I found that the heat was about right before I added the yogurt and then a bit too mild after, so next time I will increase the spices.

I used skinned chicken thighs & legs (rather than a whole chicken) & hacked the pieces in half. I also substituted half canola oil for butter. The change was easier on my stomach & didn't affect the recipe. If you have Brown Cow brand in your area, it's a great whole milk yogurt & holds together nicely, even when simmered.

This was awesome! After living in Asia a number of years, we have been looking for a good curry recipe....this really fills the bill! I followed it exactly with the exception of using coconut milk instead of yogurt. Next time I will probably increase the amount of spice since we like "spicy". It was quick and tasty....all in all, a great recipe.

This is a wonderful dish. I served it with Ginger Coconut Rice (look for it on this site). We couldn't decide which we liked better - the curry or the rice. Will definitely make this for guests.

I made this recipe after work one day and it turned out really nicely. I would probably add extra spices but I like things really spicy. Also I thought that I might try adding some additional vegetables to it next time to make it a little more hearty because I forgot to make the rice. All in all, a pretty good, easy weeknight dish.

Excellent! Even picky children loved this dish. We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, decreased the butter, and increased the tomatoes and spices to make more of the luscious sauce. Was also doubled the recipe and froze the extra servings before adding the yogurt and cashews. Worked well.

i opted to "vegetarianize" this recipe because i am not that fond of chicken. i started off with low-fat land o' lakes butter(6g of fat vs. 11g with full fat), instead of chicken i used a can of chickpeas and half a head of cauliflower. i never ended up using the cashews at all and i used the yogurt as a condiment instead of mixed in. i have been trying to figure out how to make this dish i always see on indian buffets, it has cauliflower, potatoes, and chickpeas. this is very close. i was so pleased. so i totally revamped this! it was delicious

oh, this was good. Used boneless skinless breasts cut into big chunks and boneless skinless thigh chunks - the breasts overcooked a bit but thighs were perfect. Make sure the cashews are ground really fine and the ginger is minced. Used coconut milk instead of yogurt.

Don't give 4 forks very often but this was amazing! We used bone-in chicken breasts and doubled the tomatoes - was perfect. I roasted the cashews - great "secret ingredient" adds a lot to the sauce, and also used coconut milk in place of yogurt as mine had gone bad.

This is definitely better than most curries I've ever eaten at restaurants (and I'm picky about where I dine out). I tried it in a crockpot overnight with boneless/skinless breasts and it was very, very tasty, but the chicken overcooked just slightly.

Easy, delicious. Followed exactly except used 28 oz.can of tomatoes. Also used olive oil instead of butter.

I made it for 2 with 2 bone-in chicken breasts (which stayed lovely & moist), doubled the tomatoes and used light coconut milk in place of the yogurt (only because my yogurt was "off" and I had some coconut milk already anyway). Just wonderful. We will be sure to make it again and again, my husband talked about it for days.

This is amazingly good. Substituted cumin for garam masala because I had that on-hand. Used fresh tomatoes instead of can. And olive oil instead of butter (much healthier!). I'd read the original recipe from Charmaine Soloman, who said you can use either mint leaves or cilantro. I used both, and loved the exotic flavour! The only think was that because of the long simmering time, the sauce dried out quite quickly, and I had to add some water (perhaps because I was using a wok). Served it with home-made lebanese bread. My husband and I loved it!!!! An authentic Indian dish which can be made easily in the western kitchen!

This was phenomenal. I made a couple of changes, largely for health reasons: Reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon and used low fat yogurt. Also increased the tomatoes to two 14oz cans because it looked like it needed more liquid. Otherwise, just as written. Very good. Served it with roasted cauliflower with garlic, also from this site.

This was my first time cooking with these spices and this dish was wonderful. Following the advice of others, I used large cubed boneless chicken breasts and thighs. I used Muir Glen diced fire roasted tomatoes--28oz.,which vastly inproved the flavor of the sauce, and added chicken broth since I used close to 3 lbs. of chicken. I used half low-fat yogurt and half coconut milk, and served with ginger-coconut rice. One of my guests at dinner, whose sister is a chef that specializes in Indian food, said it was one of the best dishes she has ever eaten.

This dish was very, very tasty -- even though I modified it somewhat for my cholesterol-watching husband. I sauteed in vegetable oil (not butter), used skinless breast meat and used non-fat yoghurt instead of whole milk (adding a cup+ instead of 3/4 of a cup for more creaminess). Served with basmati rice (boiled with a bay leaf and turmeric added) and oven roasted cauliflower (coated with olive oil, salt and pepper). A definite winner!!

I'm going to add my kudos to the other reviews. This is an incredible meal, hearty, tasty, and relatively easy. I used drumsticks as well as boneless tenderloin pieces - and I have to say we preferred the boneless tenderloin pieces in taste and texture to the bone-in pieces of meat! Next time, I will use only boneless chicken.

Easy and great tasting. What more could you ask for? :-) I used 4 leg quarters, but there was enough sauce for 6. Make extra rice to sop up the sauce on your plate. Yum. Will make again w/ diced potatoes and maybe a touch of cocunut milk (but the coconut milk is snot needed really). Heat was just right for me as well.

This dish was fabulous. I made it with a few modifications, as I'm on Weight Watchers and wanted to reduce the calories a bit. I also decided to experiment by making this in the crockpot, and it worked wonderfully. Here are my modifications: Place butter (1-2 T only) in crock pot, along with onions, garlic, and ginger. Place 3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into 4 oz portions) on top of onions. Drain the can of tomatoes; place on top of chicken breasts. Cook in crock pot for 7-9 hours on Low. One hour before serving, add yogurt, spices (curry, salt, cumin, cayenne), and cashews. Cook another hour on Low. Serve with rice, garnish with chopped cilantro, and offer a side of mixed yogurt/lemon juice. This turned out fantastic. I think, if I continue to seek low-calorie recipes, I will omit cashews and substitute a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The cashews didn't add a lot of flavor, but they added a lot of calories and fat. But, overall, I loved this recipe.

Exceptional! Made exactly as written, except for leaving out the cayenne ( 2 year old tongues), but had a dish of chili sauce on the table for the rest of us to spice it up with. I think that the only change that I would make next time is to make it the day before to blend the flavours.

Absolutely delicious and easy. I used chicken breasts with the bone in and cut them in 1/2. Keeping the bone in prevents the chicken from getting rubbery. To reduce the fat I made a few changes: nonfat instead of whole fat yogurt (Alta Dena is the best), light olive oil instead of butter. Otherwise I made it as written and will definately make this again.

Great dish. Absolutely delicious and easy. I made the following changes to reduce the amount of fat: oil (light olive) instead of butter, nonfat yogurt (Alta Dena is the best) instead of full-fat, and skinless chicken breasts with the bone (cut in half).

This dish really doesn't need any more reviews, but I just can't resist adding accolades and suggestions. I made the recipe just as written except that I used sour cream (I am a low-carb person). I thought the spices were perfect. I know that using the whole chicken with skin and bones is more authentic and tasty, but I really did enjoy the boneless morsels. The skin got flabby and so actually became a negative thing. Next time I am going to buy chicken breasts and thighs, debone and skin them, discard the skin, retain the bones, cut the chicken into largish, bite-size pieces, and add the chicken meat and bones to the sauce. I'll remove the bones before serving. As some other reviewers have suggested, I will increase tomatoes and broth to make more fabulous sauce. I live alone, so I made the dish on Sunday night, took out enough for my supper, and refrigerated the remainder without the cashews and yogurt. On Wednesday night, when I heated up the last serving, I had run out of cashews. In their place, I added a tablespoon of Soynut Butter. It was pretty good. For my weeknight dinners, I was satisfied with a side dish of steamed broccoli and cauliflower. A glass of gewurtztraminer went very well. For company, and I do think this would be a marvelous company dish, I would add an Indian bread, a raita, a pilaf such as the spiced rice (on this site), and would punch up my cauliflower somehow. This simple, delicious recipe is a real gift to lovers of Indian food.

Really tasty!! I added some parboiled vegetables--potato, carrots, cauliflower, peas to make a one dish meal. The texture of the ground cashews made the dish a little grainy though. I might try chopping the cashews or using cashew butter next time instead.

The leftovers (even though I added the cashews and coconut milk to the curry the first night) were even better than the first time around. After the second serve and the chicken was gone, I still had lots of sauce left. So I bought a deli-cooked rotisserie chicken, shredded about half of it into the leftover sauce, and simmered this for a while. Then I made "Sloppy Joe CHICKEN Sandwiches". Delicious.

Very good, though it took longer to prepare than I expected/planned for. I used one package of boneless skinless breasts and another of thighs. I removed the skin and excess fat from the thighs, and cut the breasts through the thicker portion to help them cook through in the cooking time -- still probably a bit more chicken altogether than the recipe suggests, and might not have been covered well enough by the sauce while cooking. I also omitted the cilantro, and discovered when ready to make it that I was out of ground cumin -- I had to grind cumin seed. For us (including 6 yr old boy) it was a wee bit hot; I will probably reduce the cayenne next time. Said boy, who hates onions, didn't even notice them :-). The whole milk yogurt I buy is 1 cup, and next time I will probably use the whole cup. Very nice flavor, altogether. Was very good with jasmine rice, as someone else noted.

This was VERY GOOD, but mine did not look like the picture. I had much more sauce, and I think mine was too tomatoey (having never made this before, I'm not really sure). I divided the recipe in 1/2 to make 2 servings. Since I did not want to goof with 1/2 of a can of tomatoes, I used a small can of tomato sauce (next time I would goof with the diced). I used salted cashews and omitted any salt. Used 4 oz. of coconut milk instead of the 3/8 cup of yogurt. I had lots of sauce that I served over egg noodles. You may want to buy extra chicken if you use a 2 lb. package of Pilgrim's Pride chicken thighs with skin and bone. After I removed the skin and excess fat from the 4 thighs, I found that there was 9 oz. of waste, i.e. 28 per-cent waste. Not good, and also they were 12 per-cent injected!!! Next time I might try boneless, skinless breasts.

One of our favorite Indian dishes is Butter Chicken. This recipe is remarkably close to others I have for Butter Chicken, but simplified by using curry powder rather than having to blend my own. I used three different curry powders, Indian chili powder rather than cayenne, and cut up skinless bone-in chicken breast & skinless/boneless thigh. Excellent. Too much texture for Butter Chicken, but the taste is remarkably similar. Technically, India is in Asia.

To ChefLaurie, who wrote in on 1/19: Indian is Asian. It doesn't make sense to say that the recipe is more Asian than Indian.

I made this recipe as written except I used skinless boneless chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces. Yes the meat turned out a little dry, but I did this for ease of eating. The curry powder I used is a local blend, made here in Washington, and is quite hot and spicy on its own. I used the correct amount of cayenne and thought the heat just right. One thing I've learned about making curries is that after adding the seasonings, cook until the oil separates out. This fries the seasonings and adds more flavor. You can tell when this happens by looking and listening to your sauce. Also, I believe that this is an Asian curry, not Indian (as noted by the name the cookbook it was adapted from). I froze a portion of this dish after I added the yogurt and cashews and am eager to see how it holds up. I'm a Personal Chef and Restaurant Owner and am adding this to my menus.

A great winter dish - tasted even better after a day in the fridge. I used sour cream instead of yogurt because that was what I had on hand, and it tasted fine, but I'll get yogurt for next time because I know it's more authentic. I didn't use cilantro, but did toss in some baby spinach leaves I wanted to use up. Think this could be a very versatile recipe!

My husband I enjoyed this recipe. We eat--and cook--a lot of South Asian food, and found this to be an easy and delicious recipe. I tweaked it a bit, added some chilis, etc. My advice, try it. Oh, and don't skimp on the full fat yogurt. It makes the dish.

Even my "I don't like spicy food" 8yo went back for seconds!

Of the literally hundreds of things I've made from this site, this is without a doubt in the Top 10. I followed the recipe exactly except with boneless skinless breasts and with strained greek lowfat yogurt (all the dense, creamy richess with half the fat). To those cutting/eliminating either the butter or the cayenne-- DON'T! Butter is an essential part of the taste profile of this dish, and you need the bite of the cayenne to cut the richness of the butter/yogurt/cashews. This recipe as written is by no means 'hot', even for children. This is even better as leftovers, but as the recipe suggests, leave out the yogurt and cashews until reheating. EXTRAORDINARY!

Rating: 3
This was delicious! We both loved it. I followed the recipe as written, but I halved the butter (which was PLENTY) and halved the cayenne (my curry powder is pretty spicy, and this was the right amount of heat for us). I used boneless skinless thighs, but next time I think that I will use bone-in skinless breasts. Six thighs were not enough for the amount of sauce that I had; there was a lot of sauce leftover. Great texture to the sauce thanks to the creamy yogurt and ground cashews. I served this over basmati rice with a side of sauteed spinach, and it was a good combo.

OMG!! I just made this fabulous dish tonight also and LOVED IT!!! I basically followed the recipe but did add 1 cup chicken broth to the simmering part as I thought it needed more moisture to simmer in. Good idea, as it also created more scrumptous sauce. This was the most fresh and fabulous curry I've ever had and also can't wait to make it again for friends and/or Pot Luck. Hubby served himself a huge plate, said he didn't think he'd eat it all....he did :-) And loved it as much as I did. Definate "Do-Over"

My wife and I loved this and it was quick enough for me to make it after work. I used boneless skinless breasts cut into thirds and also used low fat yogurt. The sauce was not at all greasy but the chicken did dry out a bit as I suspected it would. I'll use boneless skinless thighs next time and will definitely make this again.

I felt that 1/2 stick butter was to much so only used 1/4. As I was making it for our family dinner with a 10 and 7 year old I halved the cayenne. Served over basmati. It was simple to make, a nice warm dish for a cold winter night. It was good but not something I will be craving or dying to make again. More spice nixt time may help.

I tasted this dish before the yogurt and cashews went in, and was thoroughly disappointed. After those two additions, the curry greatly improved. I used regular (mild) curry powder, and the required amount of cayenne, and the heat was nonexistent. Next time, might try it with boneless skinless thighs, as the curry was a bit difficult to eat and was slightly greasy. (Not sure if this was because of the skin or the result of too much butter). My instincts told me to brown the chicken pieces before throwing them in with the liquid; I didn't, but it probably would have resluted in less flabby skin. Also am very interested to tinker with the recipe and try adding chunky peanut butter (as per another review) instead of the cashews for a sweeter twist.

This dish was easy and excellent! I used hal yogurt and half coconut milk. It was very tasty!

Very quick and tasty curry dish. I left out the cayenne and cumin because I have a 4 year old. It was still very tasty. It would have tasted even better if I had used fresh tomatoes and chicken pieces with the bone-in.

Woiw! Delicious, quick and easy. I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception, I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into chunks. Wonderful served over rice and I even made Naan.

Found that next time I would only use thigh and breast pieces. The less meatier pieces are a waste of good sauce! It was just the right heat and could have been a little spicier. I used sour cream in place of the yoghurt and served it over jasmine rice. Was delicious!

i can't believe *i* made this amazing dish!! it turned out so beautifully; it's definitely a recipe i'll memorize and make often. what a show-stopper!! it was amazingly flavorful!! i made it vegetarian by adding tempeh in place of the chicken, and it worked out perfectly. this is just an incredible dish, and if i could give it more than "4 forks," i would!

This is one of the most sumptuous, richest dishes I've made from a recipe. This is the kind of recipe I'll file and eventually memorize. It's very forgiving, can be made spicier in a second, and holds and re-heats well. One key thing here is really to cook the spices in with the vegetables and the chicken pieces before adding the tomatoes. I added part of another can for a bit more liquid, as well as a couple of more cloves of garlic and plenty of ginger, given that both of these mellow out with a long cooking. And I added some lime juice at the end for another burst of flavor. I'm not surprised that some people thought this was bland. Boneless, skinless anything is bland. I used all bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, and this made for a really rich, delicious dish. The bones really help to add body to the sauce. For those who think this is too hot, more yogurt at the end would help. I'll continue to experiment, but it's a really tasty recipes as it is.

This is a delicious and fool-proof recipe! I've never had a better curry dish, even at the best Indian restaurant. It uses common ingredients, and is easy to throw together. Changes that I made: 1. I used a combination of boneless, skinless breasts & thighs, cut into large chunks. 2. I used coconut milk instead of yoghurt. 3. I added two peeled potatoes cut into 1-inch chunks, 1/2 a small cut-up cauliflower and about 3/4 cup frozen peas 20 minutes before serving. This made it less saucy, and also made it a complete meal. I served it over jasmine rice. Regarding the reviewer who felt it had too much onion, note that you usually get more than 1 cup of chopped onion per 1 onion. The recipe calls for two cups -- use that measure, not 2 onions. I do not know why some found this to be bland -- I found it to be bursting with flavor. I thought the heat factor was perfect, but then, I was using basic store-bought curry powder (Shillings), not specialty or hot curry powder. Also, I used basic cayenne pepper. If you use different spices than the recipe calls for, you will get a different result. This truly is so good I would be proud to serve it to guests or bring it to a potluck!

I made a double recipe for a potluck. Made it the day before the party, let the flavours brew overnight, reheated it at the host's house, and got rave reviews. I used Sharwood's hot curry powder, so it had a nice bite.

I made this dish because it was rated so highly, and because my husband loves curry. He loved this dish, and I did too. I used boneless thighs. I liked the creaminess the yogurt imparted. I suspect, that lots of Canadians will make this dish tonite, since it's posted on Rogers home page!

Mmm- so yummy! I have trouble replicating the flavors of restaurant Indian food at home- but this recipe really hits the mark! Like some other cooks, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks. Also, when I reheated the leftovers the next day, I added a handful of peas and simmered for a minute- also good! Many other veggies could be added if you wanted to make it a more complete meal.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic simple recipe. I used chicken on the bone, but removed the skin. Also, I used 2 Tbsp mild curry blend and 1 Tbsp hot curry from Martha Stewart spice collection. It's a good thing I cooked a little extra because it didn't live to see the morning. I can't wait to make this again!

I'm surprised this recipe has gotten such good reviews. I found it to be pretty bland. I wanted more "heat" which is easy to fix, but in my opinion it lacked real flavor as well so my search for the perfect chicken curry continues. I used grocery store variety curry powder which could be the problem but I doubt it. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and decreased the cooking time by about 15 minutes. The chicken was cooked perfectly. This would be a great curry recipe for kids as it's very mild on all fronts. I'm just not impressed.

Loved it! Preferred it w/o the yogurt, though. Will skip it next time.

My roomate made this recipe for dinner the other night and it was very good. She used chicken breasts and I would have cut them up instead of leaving them whole. I thought it could have used more heat - maybe some jalapeno or more cayenne. Also, it would be delicious with the addition of some vegetables, peas or potatoes for instance. The next day I reheated the dish for dinner and added some chopped apple that I had left over from a salad I had just made. The apple was a nice addition - gave the dish a little crunch.

Talk about hot & spicy! Wowee! My husband was shocked by the intense heat. I'm sure it was the curry powder I used. Perhaps more yogurt would have turned down the heat. The flavor was good, and with boneless skinless breasts it cooked quickly.

This dish was delicious and relatively easy to make. To cut the fat a bit I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, a little less butter, and used fat free yogurt. I don't think these modifications affected the flavor at all. I intend to make this dish again.

Wow! This sounded good, but it was even better than I expected. The only substitution I made was to use 3 lbs of boneless, skinless breasts, and cut them into chunks. Everything else exactly as written. I'm puzzled by those who said they had too much sauce, it was wonderful, and seemed just the right amount. Perhaps those who are substituting the chicken parts are using less meat than originally called for? At any rate, this will definitely reappear as an easy weekday dinner (although it was good enough for company!)

My friends and I have a weekly dinner together, and the consensus was that this was my best dish yet! This was superb. We like spicy food, and after reading comments saying it could use more spice, I doubled cayenne...very SPICY! Wouldn't add as much next time. Best home-cooked Indian ever!!!

This was easy and delicious. The only change I made was substituting about 1 1/2 lbs. chicken tenderloins for the chicken pieces (use more if serving more than 4 people). I might try the coconut milk in place of the yogurt next time as another cook suggested.

Loved this dish! It's such a simple recipe to get such simmered all day flavor. I've made a lot of curries from my Madhur Jaffrey cookbook which take a lot more prep time and cooking time, but I would say this recipe ranks right up there with the best of those.

Absolutely great! One of the best curries I've ever made and quite simple. As others have mentioned, using boneless, skiness chicken breasts cut into pieces worked well for me.

Rarely do I do an Epicurious recipe exactly as written. However, except for using boneless skinless chicken thighs and skinless breast on the bone, this one I followed to a T and it was superb. It did make a lot of sauce for the twelve pieces of chicken, so next time I may cut down on the sauce or add more chicken. Served with jasmine coconut rice (simple - use a mix of light coconut milk and water instead of just water, add toasted unsweetend coconut at the end) and a lemon-mint salad of radishes, cukes, tomatoes, onions, parsley, a bit of feta and mesclun greens. I could have eaten the sauce with a spoon - perfect!

To the cook from Arkansas - yes, curry powder and curry paste are distinctly different. This recipe calls for the powder, so you can try it with confidence using any good quality Indian curry powder.

FABULOUS! I made this using boneless, skinless, chicken thighs (trimmed of fat) and pretty much followed the rest of the directions. I located plain whole-milk yogurt at our local food co-op and had none of the "curdling" problems another reviewer mentioned. I used chopped cilantro and cashews as a garnish. The jasime rice is especially nice as it has a unique "nutty" flavor ordinary white rice does not possess. Even my picky 9-year-old loved this and has begged me to make it again! A perfect EASY dish for a cold winter night.

This dish is just okay. It was surprisingly bland. I'm actually wondering if it would have been better without the cashews. I used roasted, 50% less salt (Trader Joe's) cashews and they seemed to give the sauce a weird flavor and texture. Also, it needs more cayenne. I will probably make it again, but perhaps try it with a different curry, and maybe a bit of crunchy peanut butter instead of cashews.

This was delicious! I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and cut it into bite size pieces instead of serving pieces, which was great. As for the yogurt...I accidentally ground up the yogurt with the cashews in the blender, and added it to the sauce all together - it came out great! Flavor was wonderful, will definitely make again.

Was this ever good! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using ghee rather than butter. I also used regular curry powder rather than the hot Madras which I would normally use and with the amount of cayenne called for, the heat factor was just right. This was served with a baked fruited basmati rice (got the idea from a recipe on this site) and the Broccoli and Cauliflower with Lemon, Mustard and Chive Butter, also from this site. It was a great meal.

Two onions is about 1 1/2 too many. Very oniony tasting. We like it hot so we doubled the cayenne and it still could have used more. The surprising thing about this dish was how "saucy" it became cooking on the stovetop. We'd like this more sans onions.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, using bone-in chicken parts, skin removed. Cut the butter in half & added a little olive oil. Was pleasantly surprised that the breast pieces came out so moist. One problem I encountered was with the yogurt (Dannon Plain Lowfat)- when I stirred it in, it seemed to curdle rather than make the sauce creamy. I kept it on the stove for less than the 5 minutes called for. Any suggestions, besides substituting coconut milk? Thanks, Katrina

Better than anticipated! I love Indian food and this came out as well as any dish I've had in Indian restaurants. I used Indian curry (as opposed to a red or other kind of curry) and substituted the whole chicken for cubed breast meat. Also, when I make it again, I will reduce the cayanne or exclude it. It came out a little hotter than I prefer. If you like Indian food, this is a must make!

Delicious and easy. I used chicken thighs whith the skin removed, and I pureed the tomato before adding it, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Leftovers heated up very nicely the next day. An added bonus: it smells wonderful as it simmers. What a great smell to be welcomed by on a cold winter night!
