This recipe rocks! I'm indian, but not quite so well versed in all the dishes but getting the poories to rise isn't always as easy. I liked the little trick to add some all purpose flour. I only added about 2T worth, since we've never added it before. It definietly helped poori rise. I've never had them come out so well puffed. =) I will definitely be using it again.

Oh... my... gosh.... I seriously didn't think this was going to work, but it was fabulous! I used the whole wheat/ all purpose mix (not the special chapati flour), and butter instead of the 2T. oil, which probably made no difference, but there you are. I also didn't let it rest quite as long as it suggests (or knead it the second time...) -- I was in a hurry. But they were delicious! I was shocked that they actually puffed, but they did. I like them crispy, so I left them in the oil a little longer - maybe 30 seconds per side. We had them with a simple potato curry and a Madhur Jaffrey beet recipe. (Not the one on epicurious though... this one is hot in a sauce with tomatoes and onions.)

The instructions were very clear. The recipe made exactly 16 pooris and they turned out perfectly on the first try!

yummy! i love pooris - one of my most favorite childhood memories is of the nights my mom would make poori bhaji (pooris along with a vegetable, usually potato, accompaniment). a freshly-fried poori is one of the greatest treats ever. i haven't tried this recipe (hence i didn't rate it) but it looks pretty much spot-on. it's one of those things, though, where it's the technique that matters more than the ingredients themselves, and it's best learned by watching (a lot of watching). whether it's possible to learn via a recipe, who knows.
