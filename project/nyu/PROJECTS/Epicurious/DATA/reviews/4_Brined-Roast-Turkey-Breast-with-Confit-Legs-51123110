I was really disappointed with this dish. After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to make it for Christmas dinner. I wish I hadn't. The herbs were way too strong and the breast came out dry, even though I cooked it for less time than suggested. The legs and thighs were better than the breast, but definitely not fall-off-the-bone tender. I would not make it again.

Wonderful main dish. Not for the timid, as it requires considerable time and planning.I prepared this turkey dish for a dinner party of 8, and they were wowed. My legs and wings fell apart. Next time I will not cook in the oven as long. Great favors, a very good use of the bird.

To the cook that asks "Two different cooking processes? Why?"- I'm sorry. That's all I can say. Yes, this one is not for your average cook and takes someone a little more comfortable with a commitment like turkey confit, but it's soooooo good. If you ever question nine cups of duck fat, just move on to the next recipe. This one will make another experience next year...

Only made the breast part. Roasted a 7 lb breast and followed the recipe more or less exactly. I had to crank the oven up in the end to 475 F to get the skin crispy, because int. temp was already 150 F. After 45 min rest the meat was perfect. Highly recommended for a smaller Thanksgiving crowd ...

Also, I'm not sure why someone would rate a recipe as "would not make it again" if you have never made it in the first place...

Made the confit portion with the dark meat for thanksgiving. (Roasted the breasts using another recipe.) I used 4 lbs. of duck fat for 4 turkey thighs and legs but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was fantastic. I make a different turkey recipe each year looking for the best one and after 20 years of turkeys I have now found my go-to recipe for the dark meat. This was melt-in-your-mouth delicious with fantastic crispy skin. I already have requests to make it again next year.

It's easy to understand why this recipe hasn't been reviewed. Seems the only thing missing from the list of ingredients is the kitchen sink! NINE cups of duck fat!!?? Two different cooking processes? Why?
