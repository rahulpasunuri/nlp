The dish was good. I only added 1/4 cup of salt to the brine. I thought it was way too salty so I added a bit more nectar. I didn't grill because I just didn't feel like it so I just pan fried it. It came out really good. I will probably grill it next time.

This is a delicious recipe. We skipped the brine, but did the rub. Also, we served the glaze as a sauce instead of marinating with it. We have made this several times already.

Fabulous! I was short on time so did not do the brine. Followed everything else and based on others comments doubled the glaze. I cooked it in my steam convection oven and it came out perfect.Definitely a go to recipe going forward.

I'll add to the chorus: this was phenomenal. I was able to make the brine, rub and glaze the day before, then put the pork in the brine the morning of. Decreased salt in brine to 1/3 cup, and didn't use any in the rub and just garlic powder (not garlic salt)--it was still well-seasoned. The spicy-sweet-tangy symphony of these flavors wowed my usually finicky guests. As someone else suggested, I served this with the Green Rice recipe from NYT (which needed to cook longer than that recipe indicated, but was otherwise fab), some garlicky green beans and a simple salad with the Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette from this site (also make-ahead). Can't wait for leftover, and will make again!

We skipped the brine, and just did the rub and served the glaze as a sauce. We really enjoyed this recipe - the cilantro and lemon in the glaze gave it a hint of Mexican taste, and it balanced out the sweetness of the apricot nicely.

Just finished this and it was great. I brined for 12 hours and didn't find it overly salty - nor did the other 5 diners. I wish I would've made double the glaze, though - it's delish and there's simply not enough to do the trick. I served it with creamy corn-studded polenta (from this site), which paired really well. I expected the poletna to be firmer and more of side, but it was pretty thin, so I served the pork on top of it and it was perfect (the polenta firmed up a lot once off the heat - after 10 mins or so). This will def. be a go-to meat for a summertime crowd-pleasing meal.

Sorry to bring down the party, but I made this recipe exactly as written, except that the only salt I used was the kosher salt in the brine. Even still, I found it far too salty. If I make it again, I would cut down on the salt in the brine by a significant amount, and increase the coriandor in the final glaze because I love coriandor and because it adds some contrast and tooth to the jamminess. But I'm not sure that I would make it again - the foolproof chicken on this site with its brine and coriandor sauce, or the lamb with fig and eggplant tend to be my "go to" grill to impress recipes.

Making this again tonight! We'll serve it with Martha Rose Shulman's recipe for Green Rice from the NYT (rice cooked with cilantro & parsley) and a mixed green salad. Great meal to cook outside on a 97 degree day!

One word....HEAVENLY!! Such a delicious recipe! I ended up cooking this in the oven and it still turned out great. The glaze is beyond words...just amazing! I ended up tripling the glaze because its just so good. Followed the advice of others and left the salt out of the rub and it was plenty salty. We will definitely be making this again!

This was a fantastic recipe and easy too.We butterflied the loin to reduce the cooking time;it worked out great!I added a little cayenne to the glaze for an added zip. Yum! A keeper!

This was fabulous. Used guava nectar in the brine because I had a can in the pantry. Did everything else pretty much according to the recipe. The loin was exceptionally juicy, tender, and not too salty. I also tried the spice rub on chicken wings that I marinated for 24 hours in a mojo marinade, and they were phenomenally good!

Really good! I had to substitute strawberry preserves for the fruit and grapefruit for the citrus but it was still awesome. Took the advice of not putting salt in the rub because I let the pork sit in the brine for 24 hrs.

Used pineapple orange juice instead of apricot nectar because it was on hand. Followed all ingredients other than that. Let it marinate for 8 hours. Meat cooked pretty quickly on the grill. Only after 35 minutes did my thermometer register 140--so I removed it early. It was a little salty for me. I would omit the salt in the rub next time. The salty brine pretty much does the trick. Delish. This is a man-pleasing meal.

Wow... We made a few modifications to the recipe, based on what was in the pantry. Basically followed it, except for we didn't have apricot nectar so subsituted orange juice in the brine. For the glazed we made an orange reduction, which was super good! It gave us an opportunity to play with our smoker, so we used hickory to flavour, and it was delicious. Served it with a killer coleslaw & butternut squash - a great variety in texture.

I had a client request this dish and I'm so glad she did...it is now a fave in our household, too! It seems like a lot of fruit flavoring, but really - it's all good! And cilantro? I hate the stuff, but even that was perfect in this dish. I use pork tenders as they are quicker on the grill - and mistakenly used peach nectar for the brine - you'd never know. My 10- year old, who doesn't care for pork, cleans her plate everytime I fix it! Worth the effort.

hmm! hmm! - very good... served this for a crowd of 20 people (and not a shred left of the 10 lb. roast) - including teenagers and adults and everyone was back for seconds. Followed the recipe as written and it was great. However, i did cheat a bit - by not removing the layer of fat on the roast. Don't make that mistake because i had a flare up - didn't ruin anything but had to pay a bit more attention until the fat melted away. After that it was smooth sailing.

Oh yum, oh yum! That said, I used a roast that was 1/2 the size, and it took almost twice as long to cook using the temperature that they recommended. Anyone else have that issue? Nevertheless DELICIOUS and not dry at all. Will make again for sure!

The BEST DAMN pork loin I've ever tasted! I love epicurious and I've made half a dozen roast pork loin recipes from this site and loved them all, but this is HANDS DOWN the most delicious. Tender, juicy, meat with the depth and complexity of the rub and the glaze together....just phenomenal. I made this exactly as described and wouldn't change a thing. Except to double it, which I will do next time. Don't neglect dredging the slices of pork through the glaze just before serving, it really adds a nice touch. Unbelievable flavors, stupifyingly good. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

WOW awesome easy recipe. I used peach nectar instead of apricot turned out wonderful. Everyone loved this pork. Cilantro and apricot yum. Can't go wrong with this pork dish.

I would marry the glaze were it legal. Seriously. I used pork chops and grilled per usual on med heat and scaled back the recipe as there are only 2 of us. Otherwise, the only changes I made were apple juice instead of apricot nectar (had it on hand, worked beautifully) and I left the lemon pepper out of the rub mixture since I never use the stuff. Parsley would work fine if you are a cilantro hater but I highly rec. using the cilantro. Insanely delicious.

Delicious! The loin stayed very moist and tender. Caveats: I used a bit of a different spice mix (whatever I had on hand to approximate the given mix) and I cooked this in the oven at 250 - it took a lot longer. This will be my go-to pork recipe from here on!

this was amazing. we smoked and then finished the pork (sliced) in the oven slathered in the glaze and it was perfect.

Caveat: I had to make a few significant substitutions so I can't comment on the exact recipe but...This was the hit of yesterday's Memorial Day BBQ! My husband has an aversion to fruit on his meat so I went with a toned down apple juice for the brine and honey instead of apricot preserves for the glaze. I was also missing paprika so substituted chili powder. Coming off the grill, the spice coated pork loin looked and tasted beautiful. The sweet and savory glaze was the perfect finishing touch. We'll definitely be making this again over the summer - even if we scale it down for just the two of us.
