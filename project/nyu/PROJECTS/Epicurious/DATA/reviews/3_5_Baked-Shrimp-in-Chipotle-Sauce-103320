Tasty, and with just the right amount of heat. I purchased the "E-Z peel" variety of jumbo shrimp, which made dining a little easier, but it was still messy. Provide lots of napkins.

nola---perhaps you should look up the meaning of "inspired".

What an extremely sad attempt at the classic New Orleans BarBQ shrimp. You people should be ashamed of yourselves

3-4 forks? Really, people?! I am just so confused... I love shrimp and had a can of chipotles to use; both ingredients went to waste here. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out way too salty. And after the first bite, my boyfriend proclaimed that it tasted like hot dogs. And you know what? It did--and NOT in a good way! I gave him bread to dip in the sauce, and he got up to get oil/vinegar instead. Neither of us finished our bowls. What an awful mess. I'd give negative stars if I could.

I pretty much made one-half of this recipe last night to make 2 servings. Used a little less than what I should have for 2 servings of both the chipotle and adobo sauce, and also the salt. Used 10-1/2 oz. (after defrosting and blotting dry) of M/L shrimp (31 to 40 per lb.). Also, I did marinate the shrimp in the sauce about 1/2 hour before baking them. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. Served this with bread to sop up the juice, and a combo of frozen broccoli and corn (nuked). Hubby says MAKE THIS MANY TIMES SOON!!!

This was pretty good. Gave it 3 forks because it was so easy to make. I pureed the chiles, garlic and liquids then added to the melted butter. Used 4 chiles--which was just this side of the cusp of too much. Served over rice with stir fried sugar snap peas.

Amazing wonderful and simple recipe! Be sure to have the bread to soak up this great sauce.

My family and I love chipotle chiles and were looking forward to this dish. We thought it was just okay. It is certainly easy, but I am sure there are better, more tasty recipes mixing chipotles and shrimp out there.

This would easily be 4 forks but I messed up in the baking process - didn't read that it said to use a shallow baking dish on the low rack in the oven and I used a deep round baking dish on the top/middle rack in my oven which caused 1/3 of the shrimp to come out close to raw and the other 2/3 to come out perfect. I deveined and shelled the shrimp before cooking which causes them to come out only partly pink...not the brilliant pink color that you think of when you think of new orleans/cajun shrimp. I will definitely make this again for company (now that I've practiced on my family). The flavors are amazingly good.

I didn't change a thing and this turned out perfect! The smoky flavor is very good - and the recipe is so quick & easy to make. We served with bread and corn on the cob - excellent casual meal!

Sorry... as an addendum to my last list of hints, I also de-shell the shrimp and cut off the tails.

I have made this recipe a few times and think it is one of the best tasting and easiest to make! Even my finicky boyfriend who lives off of chips and pizza loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes spicy food - it is spicy, but has so many great flavors to it. After my initial failed attempt at preparing this dish (I misunderstood the directions and used 1 can of chilies, rather than one chili!), I have made a few small adjustments. First, I mince about three to four chilies through a garlic mincer - you really want to be sure that you don't get the seeds in it otherwise it is too hot. Second, I add a little more wine - somewhere between a fourth to a half a cup - and a bit more Worchester sauce. Third, I let the sauce cook for a few minutes on med-low heat. Fourth, I make sure not to overcook the shrimp - I don't cook for more than 8 min. Finally, this dish tastes great with bread, rice and some lemon squeezed on it to counter the spiciness.

So good and SO easy! Ingredients we almost always have on hand, which is a big plus.

My book group loved this. To the person who thought the sauce harsh, make sure that the wine you use is mellow; also cook the sauce a bit, first. I did add extra and garlic and some lime juice.

This was delicious and very simple to make. the sauce was a little runny though, did any body else find this? it would be good over rice, but i served it with cornbread, which was also good but i felt like alot of the sauce was wasted. and it was so good i didn't want to waste it!

This was very easy and went well over rice. Despite the wide variety of things I've cooked this was the first time I have used chipolte peppers in adobo sauce. I tasted them straight from the can and thought the dish would be too spicy but after mixing them with the other ingredients and cooking they became milder so I agree with the other comments - add another pepper!

I found this dish to be tasty and simple, next time I make it I will add more chipotles as we like things with a little more kick. We served with rice and frech bread.

I made this for a party and it was a hit with the folks that like spicy food! It was really easy to make and atop a bed of rice, made for a nice presentation. I forgot to warn everyone that it was spicy (and it was) so a few folks were complaining about the "burn". I told them to drink more wine and all was forgotten soon. I'll make this again but instead of baking, I'll try skewering and grilling, with the sauce on the side.

try marinating the shrimp for a few hours, then saute in an extremely hot skillet without stirring for 2-3 minutes or so, then stir and continue cooking until just pink through.

I assuke this is supposed to be somewhat like New Orleans barbecued shrimp. It is close, but no cigar. I tried it because I love chipotle chilis. I was disappointed. I usually make it using P Phrudomme's recipe. I should have stuck with the original.

This recipe was easy and delicious. However, I used already peeled and deveined shrimp because I don't like fussing with the shells, and as a result the shrimp came out a horrible gray color. They were still delicious, but too ugly to present to guests. If I made them again, I would leave the shells on.

I so looked forward to trying this but was so disappointed. The sauce was harsh in taste and not an enhancement to the shrimp... I wont make this again.

FYI: This recipe is supposed to read "a QUARTER cup of butter" (half a STICK), NOT half a CUP.

Rating: 4
Excellent and quick- definately cut down on the amount of butter and salt. I used 3 chipotles and 2 lg. cloves of garlic. Served it with roasted corn, crusty loaf of bread and a nice Pinot Noir. We liked the sauce so much that we even tried a little on the corn- great flavor combo!

Living near the gulf coast, I have a LOT of shrimp recipes. This one rates in the top five. Make sure you use only a half stick of butter, not a half cup. This is a weekly favorite at our house, and is requested anytime we attend a froup dinner or potluck. We were certainly surprised! So quick, so simple....

Rating: 4
I agree with a couple of previous reviewers...the butter amount is off...probably should 1/4 cup butter. I peeled the shrimp before baking, as it's just easier to serve them that way. This was easy and really good! I like things spicy, so made extra sauce (froze the leftover), added an extra chipotle, and served everything over rice with some chopped cilantro. Next time, I will add even more chilis, some extra garlic, and cut down on the butter a bit. Yum.....!!

Want to impress someone? This is a great recipe to do exactly that!! I used 2 peppers & no one complained of the heat. Just may sneak in another next time. Did not add the salt. No one asked for the shaker. Easy, delicious & the aroma is out of this world!! No more boiled shrimp for this cook!

Out of sight delicious! I peeled the shrimp before cooking and added no salt- otherwise didn't change a thing. The baguette to sop up juices was heavenly. We had corn on the cob and the Merlot I used in the recipe. We'll repeat this soon, for company.

Wonderful!!! I too used the Jardine's Chipotle Salsa and I cut the butter to 2 TBL. I also shelled and devined the shrimp. After it was cooked I thicken the sauce with some corn starch. It was great!!!

I had been dying to try a recipe with chipotles & decided to start with this. It was very easy & very good. Used 2 chiles with 3 tsp. of adobo (& omitted the salt as recommended by other cooks). I also peeled the shrimp beforehand & let them sit in the sauce for a few minutes before baking so they could marinate. Served it over rice, which definitely tamed the fire of the chiles, much to my disappointment. I'll definitely make this again ... w/out the rice.

GREAT RECIPE!! This is one of the easiest & best shrimp dishes I have ever had anywhere. I leftout the salt and the garlic, as the only chipotle I could find was Chipotle Salsa, which tasted great in the wine sauce. The french bread to sop up the sauce was marvelous. The Jardine's Chipotle Salsa is the best salsa I have ever found. Check out jardinefoods.com to order, if you can't find it at your store.

A NOTE OF CAUTION - A reviewer below points out that 1/2 stick of butter does not equal 1/2 butter (as stated in epicurious recipe). Recipe as written in magazine calls for 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter.

I have made this dish several times for family and friends, and it's a hit each time. However, I read the recipe wrong and thought it called for one to two CANS of the peppers. I added one. And to be honest, I don't think anyone who has tried it this way will go back to the 'right' way of making it... that is, if you like a little heat to your food. An absolutely wonder-full dish in terms of taste and preparation, as it does taste like you've spent a LOT of time making it. I highly recommend this recipe, and would cut the salt completely. Divine with rice to sop up the gravy, as well as crusty bread. Enjoy!

First, ditch the peel your own set-up! Better not to have to spend your evening fighting with spindly shrimp legs... go shell-less before you cook. Superb with yellow rice and black beans for a little Latin flavor... sweetish red wine and definitely crusty bread are a must. Light the candles, send the kids to bed and make this a romantic dinner for two! SCRUM-DELICIOUS!

Had to use dried chipotles and so I used Goya adobo seasoning, tried to make a sauce out of it, not realizing how much SALT is in that stuff.. beware the Adobo. We couldn't eat what came out but it smelled so good, the flavors were right on.

1/2 cup and 1/2 stick butter are not equal amounts. Is a correction to the recipe needed?

This dish is fantastic and easy. I'm making it again just a few days later. We love spicy food, so I added more chipotles. Didn't need to add salt. The corn with it was a great idea. Yes it's true the dish is messy, but so worth it.

When reading to my wife the raiting system, she said,"this was certainly a dish beyond compare but just shy of delicious". I love spicy foods but this one was just to hot. Maybe the recipe would be better with the beer added like many others have suggested.

Yummy! I agree with everyone, don't add extra salt. However it was a bit greasy for my taste... I also think you can do without the butter. There is plenty of oil in the can of chipotles. Go lower fat, and you'll love it.

a bit too hot for my taste..i would add beer to try to tone it down and leave out the salt....very good! especially if you love the hot stuff!

This dish was easy and fabulous---a recipe doesn't get much better in my opinion. My guests raved, and the corn on the cob and french bread to sop up the juices were perfect accompaniments. I added more garlic, chipotle and wine, though the next time, I might try cooking in beer because beer may have gone better with the meal.

I agree 100% with Kalypso's observations regarding this recipe- - -especially the extra salt; it is not needed. Being a garlic lover, I increased that amount to five (5) cloves- - -can you ever have too much garlic?- - -and I also "snuck in" an extra chipotle chili!

This recipe has a lot going for it. From frige to table it was literally less than 30 mintues. This makes the recipe very useful for a quick week night meal after work. The recipe itself is really very tasty, but might need a little tweaking to suit personal tastes. I would recommend decreasing or omitting the extra salt. The Worcestershire Sauce and adobo that the chipotle's are canned in both contain sufficient salt.
