The sauce was absolutely delicious, although I added a bit of honey to tone down the tartness. As good as the sauce was, however, it still could not cut the dryness of the turkey. I would recommend using dark meat only or perhaps substituting the turkey for duck.

Easy and delicious. I needed to use some fresh cherries and this was a great way to do it. Paired it with buttered basmati rice, and steamed grean beans with butter, sea salt, and pepper. It was a hit!

I made this last night for "Family Dinner". My kids (both grown) and their significant others, as well as hubby all raved. I used frozen sweet cherries (no fresh cherries yet) and I used a handful of organic dried cherries too. Also, took the suggestion and used chicken broth instead of water. Served it with rice & almond pilaf and steamed green beans. So easy and goes together in a flash. Thanks Epicurious!!!

I made this glaze to serve over turkey breast we roasted on the bbq (added drippings and used fresh frozen cherries). We served to our wine club on Pinot Noir night and everyone loved it - the dish and the pairing!

I made this recipe using pork cutlets instead of turkey. I loved the combination of shallots and cherries. The sauce was great on the wild rice side dish, as well. My husband thought it was just ok, but he's not a real fruit-and-meat lover. My teenaged son liked it. I'll try it again when I have fresh cherries.

I prefer this sauce with poached salmon. It's a tasty sauce, however, water adds zero flavor so substitute vegetable or chicken stock.

I loved this!! Very quick, easy and looks very pretty on a white platter. You could definitely serve this at a dinner party.

Tasty and extremely fast. No fresh cherries in the stores at the moment, but water-packed can of cherries (rinsed, as suggested) worked out just fine.

My husband and I agree that this is a dish you could serve company. He had to ask what the meat was as he wasn't sure if it was pork or turkey. I used a white balsamic vinegar to keep the sauce lighter in color so that it didn't hide the turkey, and it made a very nice presentation. I would suggest using a non-stick pan with a tsp. of olive oil for frying the cutlets and adding the Tbsp. of butter to round out the sauce before serving. Still low fat, but gives a richness to the sauce without extra calories.

I found the sauce to be too sharp, with a very strong predominance of the balsamic vinegar. Much better, in my view, is a similar sauce, also on this site, in the recipe for roast pork tenderloin with cranberry and balsamic vinegar sauce. I am going to try making that using cherries instead of cranberries to top the turkey cutlets.

Very easy. I like the combination of flavors. I served it with roasted garlic potatoes which were delicious with the sauce. My kids loved it too!

I made this dish for a small dinner party and it was a big hit. I too had difficulty finding fresh cherries and substituted the canned kind (rinsed as suggested). Also, instead of using cherry preserve, I just used 2 tbsp of cherry sauce from the can. It worked out great. The cherries were a little soft but no one seemed to mind!

This is truly delicious! Our cherry season just ended so I substituted rinsed, canned cherries (one can of pitted cherries, halved, equals one cup)and adjusted the sauce cooking time. Next time,I'll make the sauce and use it with duck breast. Easy and impressive!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year for a very small family gathering, rather than cook a whole turkey. It was a great hit! I'd make it again!

I've already made this dish twice! It's a great way to use fresh cherries. We loved it. (I found it helpful to buy a cherry pitter.)
