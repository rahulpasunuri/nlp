ingredients are everthing in this recipe. I can amagine my companion form Boston where to have the lemongrass paste now sold in better areas the results would be fastly diffrent.Paired with the jamine rice recipe (also in Epicurios.com)this is a great BBQ recipe . Baste with the paste. Enjoy a good wine with it.

instead of all the chili peppers, i used a few tablespoons of pureed chilis i have in my fridge, and i couldn't find lemongrass, so i used lemongrass oil instead of the regular oil. the dish was okay, but not as special as i hoped it would be. it was rather oily because the spice paste separates once the chicken and water is added. i wouldn't spend the time making this again when there are better recipes to use for chicken.
