I couldn't find catfish, so substituted tilapia. I misread the recipe and used 1TBs of lemon zest. This turned out to be outstanding. Very simple and quick to make. Delicious flavour and texture. I'll play around a litle with this cooking method in future, varying the topping (scallions/chilli peppers/lime, etc.).

This is the best recipe for Cat Fish that I have ever made. I use it all the time. I add cut up Kalamata olives to this dish as well as the green olives

My fish-skeptical family really enjoyed this -- I added red pepper flakes to my husband's portion (he likes spicy) and kept to the recipe for me and the kids. This is really a quick, easy, and healthy idea for dinner.

Personally, I thought this was a nice, subtle Mediterranean-style dish. I didn't think the olives overpowered the fish at all (I used Goya Manzanilla olives) and the lemon zest was perfect-although I did use a bit more than called for. My fiancee suggested adding pepper flakes, but he likes everything spicy. I also added black pepper to the topping. Served with broccoli sauteed with garlic & butter and squeezed the lemon wedges over everything.

This recipe is all that I can ever ask for. It's so flavorful, yet light, and most of all it can be prepared in under 30 minutes. I used pitted kalamtata olives instead of green pimenton stuffed green olives. Taking tips from previous reviewers I cut the amount of olives in half and the result was perfect: just enough the flavor and saltiness. I threw in some grilled vegitables drizzled with oil and vinegrar. A dash of salt, two twists of the pepper, and voila, dinner is served. Love this dish.

This is really a 2 and a half forker. I paid attention to previous reviews and put in slightly less olive, and a bit more lemon. Very tasty, goes so well with the catfish, and is as easy as falling of a log. Served it with roasted zucchini and mushrooms - the whole meal came together in less than 30 minutes and was very nice.

Excellent recipe. easy, quick and very tastyThe lemon zest on it was great. Although i would perhaps cut down on the amount of olives. My plate was full of them by the time i finished the fish. Also, dont make the same mistake we did.. make sure the olives are pitted.

I've made this recipe multiple times and have enjoyed it everytime. I find catfish to be too oily sometimes and suggest using talapia instead. The fish is much firmer and less greasy tasting. Fresh lemon zest is also a must.

My husband and I love olive and catfish. However, this dish is just so-so. There are so many better recipes for Catfish.

Easy to make. I would cut down on the olives and parsley a little and add a bit more zest.

If I made this again I would cut way down on the amount of green olives. I bought some nice locally made olives, but they were just too strong and vinegary for the fish. I would recommend cutting the amount of olives at least in half, while leaving the oil, parsley and zest about the same. Although I wasn't thrilled with the sauce, this method of cooking the fish covered with the olives, etc. made the fish so mosit and flavorful that I would definitely try it again.
