This doesn't have much liquid in it, which results in a more crumbly tart shell than what I'm used to. It's.... adequate. There are better recipes out there, but this one is uncomplicated enough to be abused and it will still turn out alright. Use this recipe only if the filling is very flavorful.

I enjoy cooking but DO NOT bake much. I found this recipe to be easy to make and very light and tasty.I placed the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap, and rolled out the dough. Placed in the oven for 10min. at 400 removed the wieghts, the baked for 10 min. more..perfect.
