Totally agree w/the reviews where the sauce is perfect for 2 chops. Used white wine, not water, but otherwise identical to recipe, and it was classic comfort food on a chilly So. Cal. night w/lemon couscous & green beans. About as good as a dish can get for this level of simplicity.

Delicious! I used capers instead of cornichons because they were already in my fridge, and some extra mustard just because. I used the full sauce recipe for 4 small chops and I think the proportions were just about right. Served with kale and mashed potatoes.

I love this sauce and will definitely make it again. I agree with other reviewers that you need a bigger ratio of sauce to chops. I halved the sauce recipe and made only two chops -- it was just enough sauce, but next time I'll make even more. I used regular dill pickle rather than cornichons, and I also brined the pork chops, which I find is usually essential to moist, flavorful chops.

This is delicious. I would definitely echo many other comments that making the full amount of sauce for two chops is just the right amount. Also we replaced the water with chicken stock which can only be a good thing. We used dill pickles instead of the cornichons because that's what we had on hand and we probably doubled the amount. It definitely doesn't take 9 minutes to finish the chops. Fantastic!

I liked this dish because it was quick and easy to make. However, I made a few modifications because of limitations in my pantry. Instead of the cornichon, I used large caperberries. They have a similar texture and are brined. I also added finely minced rosemary. However, I think that I used too much salt when preparing the chops. Next time I will used white wine and chicken stock and will only pepper chops as the capers add enough salt to the recipe.

Didn't like dill pickle taste, but used "regular" dill pickles instead of French cornichons. Putting pickles in garlic press worked well; good tip.

We made the full recipe of sauce for 2 chops and it was just enough (we like a lotta sauce). I used chix broth instead of water. Its an OK everyday sauce, very easy, but I might not make it again.

I have made this several times and the whole family really enjoys it. Not difficult to prepare and good for guests, also.

this is wonderful. Do try 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 cup white wine instead of the water. hmmmm.

The chops were done perfectly in under the 9 minutes. Very moist and tender. Based on reviews, I made the full recipe of sauce for the 2 of us and am glad I did. Although the sauce was good it wasn't a WOW! The flavors really do blend together nicely. I used wine for the 1/2 cup water. FYI - I think there is a typo because the directions say to 'add half of water' and never say to add the other half. I don't think the parsley added anything to the dish.

It was definitely easy and quick to cook, but like a few other reviewers, I found the sauce somewhat bland and skimpy. It tasted fine, due mainly to the fresh quality chops from our local butcher and a meat thermometer.

A friend made this and it was wonderful. Will be making it around Christmas for my mom. Reminded me of rouladen.

As a person coming from Burgundy, I can tell you that is a beautiful recipe where you can have in the same plate the sweet from the meat, the sour from the cornichon and the spicy from the mustard. but you need to use a real Dijon mustard!! I would like to take the opportunity to correct something on the French name of that dish. The real name is "Cote de Pork Charcutiere" and not "vigneronne". Sorry about this little correction.

Yummy! I brine my pork chops before cooking and this always helps to make pork tender and juicy. This was a quick and easy recipe - though I substituted the 1/2 cup of water for 1/4 of chicken stock & 1/4 cup white wine. I lowered the heat when I covered my skillet as well (just a bit). I made just one pork chop and used 1/2 the sauce recipe yet I would make double the recipe next time. I will make this again and putting it into rotation.

If you are looking for something quick after work this is perfect, serve with wilted spinach and honey-butter acorn squash.

This dish is fantastic! I served it for a Christmas gathering and everyone loved it. The chops were perfectly done and the sauce was popular. I guess I'm lucky to live in such a large area with "fancy" grocery stores, because the Cornishons make the dish. I also made the sauce for a pork roast for another dinner and everyone raved. I substituted chicken stock for the water and it made it a richer dish, I'd do that again, and I made more sauce than the recipe called for. Note to people who have a problem with port cooking up too "hockey pucks" - if you brine the pork first in salt water with garlic and spices (if you want them) you will never have this problem. Just remember not to salt the meat again because it picks up enough salt from the brining water. We offered for bid a dinner to raise funds for the United Way and this is the dish we are serving.

Love this - easy for weekday meal with mashed potatoes and steamed spinach. The hardest part is finding the Cornichons, but I think any small pickle would do.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent, fast meal. I made it with wilted, creamed spinach (to which I added some fresh nutmeg) as recommended. The spinach was perfect for mopping up any sauce left on the plate, and the cream from the spinach added a nice dairy finish to the sauce. The cornichons lost all hint of briny-ness when mixed with the mustard et al. While making the dish I got a few compaints about the pickles, but no one complained throughout the whole meal.

I forgot how much I loved this dish until I went rooting around in my recipe box looking for a pork chop dish to make for tonight. I made it about a month ago and it is one of the tastiest pork recipes ever. The mustard does not overpower - it is subtly savory. Delicious!

I thought this dish was terrific. Admittedly, one has to be a mustard fan to appreciate it, but I found the piquant combination of the Dijon and the cornichons to be wonderful. I felt like I was back in France.

I made this for my husband and me, using only 2 chops and the entire sauce recipe. It was great. Instead of water, I used chicken stock and white wine for the liquid. I also added another tablespoon of mustard. I wish the cornichons were a more present flavor - I'll work on that next time.

I was fairly disappointed in this recipe. The only change I made was using white wine instead of water. I thought the sauce was bland and I definitely overcooked the chops (but I blame that on me, not on the recipe -- although I did follow it.) I agree with the other reviewer who said -- this recipe was OK, but I'd rather make something else.

Rating: 3
Simple to make, and great tasting. I had trouble getting Cornichons, so I substituted Dill Pickle Relish (not the sweet kind). In order to not have the Pork Chops get overdone, after you brown them and put the cover on the pan, LOWER THE HEAT to low, or simmer. BTW - The sauce can be made on its own, and goes well with Steak, or Chicken.

This was a wonderful dish. My family loved it, even when reheated the next day, it retained its moisture.

Just so so, as the one fork rating suggests. I agree with a reviewer who said the pork and sauce didn't marry. This surprised me because pork and mustard are usually such naturals together.

I love all these ingredients and since everyone raved, I thought this would be outstanding. NOT SO! The chops were tough and the sauce gave me a stomachache- very disappointing!

This is one great recipe that is a keeper. Guests and family raved it and request for seconds. I usually cook my pork chop slow cooking and not overly cooked so that it will remain tender and juicy.

To Cook from Minneapolis: One shallot means the one single unit (which can contain 2 or 3 "cloves.") But I think it's a mistake to focus so much on exact amounts. This is not a science (nor is it baking), so exact amounts are not crucial. Happy cooking.

Rating: 0
Would someone please help me? I'm confused about shallots. When I bought them at the store, I noticed that they come like garlic, with multiple "cloves". So when a recipe calls for one shallot (but doesn't include a tablespoon equivalent like this recipe), is that one "clove" of shallot, or the whole thing? Thanks for your help!

I thought this one was really very good! The chops were tender, and I loved the sauce. I would have liked it better if it blended easier. But the flavor was truly good. If I make any changes it would be too fattening! As the recipe says: it was the Grape Growers food. Thanks Epicurious for another good recipe.

I had high hopes for this dish, but even changing the 1/2 c water to 1/4 white wine and 1/4 stock to the sauce didn't make it very exciting. It tasted nice enough, but no one raved either. And not the recipe's fault, but chops always turn out tough for me no matter how hard I try.

Very nice. I the left-over sauce and chops in the same container and threw it in the fridge for lunch the next day. It was 10 times better as left-overs.

Made this with boneless center-cut chops. I didn't care for the sauce at all, but my husband liked it. "It's different," he said. I won't be doing this one again.

Terrific and FAST!The chops cooked up tender and the sauce was fantastic. Used dry white wine in place of the water and sauteed fresh spinach with creme fraiche as a side. A keeper!

We weren't very impressed with this. While the sauce and the chops were tasty, the flavors did not marry--the sauce just kind of sat on the chops. Not bad,we'd probably just rather fix some thing else...

Great recipe. I served it with brussel sprouts and bacon... sure, I know not everyone's a fan, but they go nicely with this dish. One hint: don't over-cook the pork. Nine minutes was at least one minute too long.

Outstanding. I'm not much for meat, and shy away from pork chops--cholesterol, plus they tend to cook up as tender as hocky pucks. But these were tender, juicy, tasty. And quick! My husband absolutely loved them. Use less mustard until you taste(you can always add more later). I used apple cider instead of water. It added just a little sweet tang. Definitely a keeper.

These pork chops were excellent. I used a garlic press to "mince" the pickles...it worked wonders, and saved a lot of chopping and time. I also added a dolup of honey to the sauce, I tend to accompany sweet with pork chops.

I made this for dinner the other evening and my whole family loved it. It was an elegant Saturday night family meal, but easy and quick enough for any night of the week. We served it with sauteed cream spinach, roasted fingerling potatoes. Will definitely make it again!

This has long been one of my classics - although I tend to fry up a couple of onions first until crispy - move over to keep warm, 3/4 cloves garlic sliced a couple of shallots sliced and fry then when almost done put in the chops, when browned , a glass or two of white wine and simmer,- a good shake of herbs de provence, at this stage -then its plate up and stir the mustard ( Maille de anchien) is superb and away you go. Just make sure your partner eats the same ! Bon chance !

This is a very fast and tasty dish. I used double cut pork chops so it required more cooking time, and added a little more water at the end. I would definitely make this again.
