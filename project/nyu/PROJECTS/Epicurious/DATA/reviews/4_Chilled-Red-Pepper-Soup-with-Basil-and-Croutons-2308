This soup is a family favorite. Definitely have to broil the peppers, keep ALL of the juice and it is fabulous! The juice is absolutely full of flavor.

ps. please take time to roast your own peppers. I cut the sides of the peppers and put them skin side up on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and broiled until skins are dark. place in paper bag for 10 min and peel Very simple. Using jarred roasted peppers will impart a distinct abnormal flavor to the end product. But if time is limited, I suppose it could be done.

Wonderful flavors with a few additions. Sauteed 1/2 onion, 1/2 chopped fennel, and 2 clove of garlic then added chopped, peeled peppers. Added sprigs of thyme, then let simmer. Follow recipe w/chicken stock and crushed red pepper.Pureed and strained. added 1/3 C cream and finished w/ butter. Served warm. Omit basil. Wonderful! This has a beautiful color and is an amazing start to a meal!

This is one of our favorites. I have a couple of suggestions for the folks who think it's bland. 1. Never, ever run the peppers under water while removing the skins. It may make the job much easier, but it saps all the lovely flavor from the peppers. If needed, just keep a small bowl of water nearby for rinsing your hands. 2. Put your peppers in a plastic bag and tie them up, instead of a paper bag after charring. The peppers will produce a significant amount of juice if you let them sit a while, and this juice needs to go into your soup in the place of some of the chicken stock. A large part of the yummy charred pepper taste is in that juice. Good luck!

I made this recipe exactly as directed. The result was an okay-tasting soup - not unpleasant, but certainly nothing exciting and in fact quite bland and dull. Even my boyfriend, who usually is really quick with praise, thought it was okay at best. Then I tried to spice it up, using a couple of suggestions from other reviewers - adding adobo sauce and cream of coconut. Hardly any improvement. This soup is just basically a ho-hum puree of roasted red peppers, not worth all the effort and fuss.

great recipe but the soup need to be room temperature othewise it is too cold. Must be pureed very well too. I would make it again

This soup is delicious as is, but I roasted a head of garlic and squeezed it into the blender also. It is so simple and also SO good for you. Serve very cold. I made a nice chilled avocado soup and served them side by side in the same bowl for a gorgeous presentation. (I didn't find a super great avocado recipe here- so I just made it up.)

I didn't want to take the time to roast and peel the peppers so I just cut them up and stewed them with the onions, then put everything in the blender and strained through a food mill to remove the skins. I also mixed in a 1/4 cup of creme fraiche (could also use plain yogurt or sour cream), some white pepper instead of the pepper flakes, and a squeeze of lemon juice. I haven't made it with roasted peppers so I don't know how it compares, but it was good this way too!

Quick, easy and healthy. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. Nice and cool on a hot evening, the perfect start to dinner.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. I first made it years ago for an evening picnic. Refreshing, and full of summertime flavor!

Although my guests seemed to like this, I thought it was a tiny bit bland. I think next time I will add a little lemon juice. Also, roasting the peppers took MUCH longer than I thought. I would agree that the ones in jars make this much easier.

This dish is absolutely amazing! I served this with the chicken with tri-color salsa, also from the August 1993 Bon Appetit, and totally wowed my dinner party guests.

This is a great recipe. The major effort, which is roasting and peeling the peppers, can be avoided by buying the roasted red peppers in a jar at the grocery store. Once you do that, the recipe is really simple and is just different enough to impress. Use it for a lunch with some bread and spreads to accompany, or use it with a regular entree for a great dinner.

Simple ingredients - but a wonderful flavor. Easiest to use day old french/crusty bread for the croutons.
