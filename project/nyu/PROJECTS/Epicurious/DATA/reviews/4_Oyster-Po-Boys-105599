Love it!!! I've lived in Mobile, AL, Ocean Spring, MS and New Orleans, LA. This is as good as it gets without sitting where you can overlook the Gulf.

This recipe is a favorite at our place--my husband is gluten sensitive and I was thrilled to find a fried oyster recipe sans flour. The true flavor of oysters shines since the coating is so light. I serve a salad with lemon, olive oil, shallot and a touch of honey to start. Albarino makes a lovely accompaniment.

For me this was too heavy on the cornmeal. which is why the three forks and unfortunately I will continue on my search for a great one. I also miss the fried oysters of my youth... Fairhope rather than Mobil Al.

Good flavor. I would make these again using a fine corn meal because the regular was a bit gritty.

I've served these on hot dog buns also (my buns went stale). They are very soft and hold up well while eating.

These sandwhiches are freaking excellent!!! Incredibly fast and simple. I always make extra chipotle mayo and use it on any meat sandwhich. Also, don't skimp on the oysters! We like 3-4 medium oysters per sandwhich.

This is the second time I am making this....this time for my father-in-law at my husband's insistance. My husband is from Mobile and says these are the best "Oyster Loaves" he's had since he left the Gulf Coast. He wants his dad to enjoy a taste treat memory. By the way.... I think they are pretty darn good, too.
