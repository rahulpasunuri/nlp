I was looking for a way to use up some egg whites left over from another dish and I thought I'd give this recipe a try. Well... I might as well have just drunk the oil instead of wasting the time and cheese on this dish. This was like a greasy salt lick. I followed the directions and even took a thermometer to the oil. It was awful! Never again!!!

I'm so sad - this recipe did not turn out at all. I am sure I did something since the reviews rave about this! My batter was very liquid, almost to the point where I didn't think I should fry it. But, I tried anyways and it was a disaster. I promised I followed the directions, I just didn't have a "batter" and the crisps that did come out of the frying process were not good. Any suggestions?

I'm very pleased to find this recipe again, after having lost the original hard copy! Each time I made the puffs they were very good and a "hit" with company. Occasionally it was suggested that they would also be good made with other types of cheese. I look forward to making them again.

Wonderful,elegant and easy. I can't find a way to prepare and save them so they're best for small gatherings as a snack while preparing dinner. So wonderful with a good glass of red wine.

My three daughters, aged 4, 3 and 1, fell all over themselves gobbling these up. I thought they were a trifle salty, but very tasty. And so easy. Triple this recipe, at least.

Just too salty, salt was all we could taste. Very easy to make however.

I made these a few weeks ago & forgot to rate the recipe! I was looking for a light, appetizer, something different! I really liked these & my guests did, too!! Sooo easy.. But - like the prior review - really need to triple the recipe !

I had never done a recipe like this before and was certain that the marble sized puffs would disintegrate the moment they hit the oil, but they came out perfect and delicious. Next time, I'll double or triple the recipe.
