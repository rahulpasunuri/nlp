Here I am with my post-consumption comments... It was rather plain actually... Doesn't mean that I didn't hoover back two pieces, but hey... I've got a sweet tooth and somewhat simple requirements to get my fix. So, yes, a bit of a disappointment for the time... Again, I didn't notice it was a no-bake (don't like the whole gelatin thing), cake was kind of blah... I used coconut essence (couldn't find extract).. Don't think that made a big difference. I'm not an expert on cheesecakes so I can't say what would have made it better... more sugar/salt, more concentrated coconut flavour, baked perhaps?

Is it just me, or is there no sugar in this? I took a taste after I whipped up the filling and I was shocked. It was so flat and bland, so I tossed a small handful of sugar (approx. 1/4 cup in total). It took the bland edge off. Will report back tomorrow afternoon after I trepidatiously take it to a brunch. Also, it should also say in the title or intro that it's a "no bake"... Again, is it just me here or does all of this seem incomplete??

If you have to bake the crust, it's not something I would make. I do not turn the oven on when it's 104 out and I am paying big bucks to cool my house. You lost my interest...........

Like the previous review, if you are expecting a dense cheesecake, look elsewhere. This is a lighter, chiffon like cheesecake and was perfect after the great Thanksgiving meal we just had. Some alterations I did: Added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crust. Added about 2 T of sugar to the filling. Added zest of lemon and orange to the mango sauce -- the mango sauce, I feel, does need some "zip" to it. Overall very good, and would make it again.

This "cheese cake" is wonderfully lite and refreshing. It would make a great dessert with a slightly heavy meal. I found it more like a dense chiffon than a true cheese cake. I altered the recipe somewhat. 11 graham crakers were not enough even for the 7" spring from pan I used. I had to use 18 crackers. Using the 7" instead of a 9" still yields 8-10 slices. I made my own mango puree out of frozen mango cubes, In addition I added rum extract and fresh squeezed orange juice to the sauce to add a bit of zip. I also topped of the cake with coconut cream cheese frosting and decorated it with toasted coconut and piped dollops of the frosting on top of the coconut edging and piped a line of mango sauce in the center. I plated it in a bed of sauce with drips across the top. Made a beautiful presentation

I, too, loved this recipe. You must use the coconut extract or it will be bland. The crust really makes this delicious.

I absolutely loved this cheesecake. My son, who does not usually eat coconut, loved it! I did not make the mango sauce because I do not like sauces with cheesecake. Also, I put the shredded coconut in the food processor with the cookie crumbs because I did not want that grainy taste in the crust. I would definitely make this again.

I typically avoid recipes that appear to realy upon extracts for flavor--and I am annoyed with myself for not exercising this rule today. I live in a country surrounded by fresh coconut--and thus extract is impossible to find--and I made the recipe without it, adding in additional fresh, unsweetened coconut. The result was a bland cheescake, with barely a hint of discernible coconut flavor. Also, the mango puree is too thin to match the texture of the cheescake. This recipe is a huge waste of money and calories--skip it! If I could vote 'zero forks,' I would.

This recipe calls for "cream of coconut". But I deduced that it should be "coconut milk". And yes, there is a huge difference. I didn't figure this out until I had bought all the ingredients and had to adapt to the cream of coconut challenge. But the cake was still good. I'm thinking it would have been lighter and sweeter with the coconut milk. Will have to try again and see. To "yrr from boston" - I used frozen mango chunks and pureed them in my food processor. Worked perfectly.

where does one find frozen mango puree? is it readily available at the grocery store?
