Simple and delicious. I used chicken stock instead of water, cippolini onions and allowed the onions to caramalize a little longer than the recipe specified. They were very good, an excellent side dish to our Christmas prime rib.

Good, but added some sugar.

This dish is wonderful. Perfect for those fall and winter meals. I added a bit of sugar and used half water and half low sodium chicken stock. Better than creamed onions and better for you.

This recipe sounds too simple to be true but I must say......delicious! For a change, instead of the water, try a dry red or white wine. I made this for a dinner party with roasted leg of lamb. Try it!

These are REALLY good. I used Maui onions, sliced them and then served them on top of strip sirloin steaks. My, My!!!! I like my onions very well done, so cooked them longer in the pan. Fabulous and the flavor really enhanced the grilled steaks. Do this one!

Used large onions but sliced them first. Very good and easy.

Too often onions are looked upon as an ingredient for seasoning. But they are delicious by themselves and an important source of nutrients as well. I'm going to try this recipe with the larger onions also, and just increase the cooking time. I bet they'll be great.
