An excellent recipe for vegetarians and not only. It took several hours to make. I did some amendments for pesto, mixed parsley pesto with home made basil pesto. When cooked, lasagna had great flavors and taste. Next morning I sliced small piece of cold (room temperature) lasagne and enjoyed it with a glass of chilled New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (Cloudy Bay). That was an amazing combination of flavors!

This lasagna delicious the day it was made, and even better as leftovers! I added some fresh sliced tomatoes since some reviewers thought that it was too rich and needed some acid. While the tomatoes didn't detract, I don't think the dish really needs them at all. Serve with a green salad and vinaigrette on the side. I also used 2% milk and part-skim mozzarella with no detriment to the finished product.

I have probably made this over ten times now. Once I even made four pans at once (!) for a party, which pretty much made me want to kill myself by the end, but it was worth it, lol. Some things that make this a lot easier: 1. I have an eight cup Pyrex measuring cup, and I heat the milk up in the microwave in that. I can't imagine making a bechamel starting with cold milk; it'd take forever! 2. I hate oiling the eggplant slices. Using a pastry brush got little pieces of brush on the eggplant, ugh. One of those silicone brushes would work, I bet, but I don't have one. So I put the olive oil in a mister and use that. (Today I cheated and bought olive oil Pam....I know that probably isn't great, but it seemed to do the trick (the eggplant browned beautifully in the oven), and it really is so much easier. I just have a lot of fun making this and trying to get the layers "just so," and this really is a special dish. It tastes bright and peppery and is quite pretty. I've used pine nuts before, if I had them in my pantry. Today I had exactly one cup of pine nuts and 1/3 cup of hazlenuts, so I made the pesto with the pine nuts and I topped the lasagna with the hazlenuts. Last thing, I promise: I make the pesto as-is for the lasagna, but with the bit that I have left over, I add grated lemon zest and some lemon juice to brighten it up even further. Love it.

The bechamel tasted great. The pesto was good. The final product was extremely bland. I have most ao a pan to get rid of. Maybe the addition of tomato sauce or more cheese will help. The salt disappears in this. It definitely needs more seasoning. This was my first time using no-boil noodles. They were tasteless.

This was quite tasty but far too rich. Substitute skim milk and part skim ricotta. Also cut back on the milk a bit, it was far too soupy. I'd make it again, but with those substitutions and less milk.

Made the recipe as it states. It took awhile to get the bechamel to a boiling state. I was hesitant to use all the salt the recipe calls but it needs it. I actually thought it needed more. I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese in between layers. Next time I'd do this again with more cheese in between layers. Might add sun dried tomatoes or mushrooms as well like other reviewers suggest.

Made for an Italian themed dinner party. Everyone enjoyed the dish. Followed recipe with one exception used part skim milk and part evaporated milk because I did not have whole milk. Second time I have made this, easier second time around. Made enough pesto to freeze for another batch. Look forward to serving again.

This is amazingly good. The only alterations I did was a couple of layers of good-quality bottled tomato pasta sauce (I used President's Choice Organic) as I felt the recipe needed some acid. I also added a couple of layers of mozzarella as I felt it needed some oomph to appeal to my meat-loving husband. Hell, yes I would make it again!

This is the best lasagna i've ever made with a few changes. instead of parsley, I made the pesto with basil, instead of eggplant, I've used spinach and/or roasted bell peppers. I added some sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, it's really good with cut up chicken as well. I also cook my lasagna noodles and then bake them...

This is a very nice recipe - my entire bookclub had second helpings. I'm bemused by claims that it is time consuming. It is really no different to any other lasagne I've made. Definately not even 2hrs active kitchen time for a half organised cook. The pesto is delicious, even my picky kids are happy to eat it on their pasta, so don't hold back.

This was delicious. My only change: I used walnuts when I couldn't find hazelnuts. It took me less than 2 hours active time (plus 45 minutes in the oven). Just get your mise en place and roast the eggplant while you make the bechamel and pesto.

Way too complicated for the final result. I spent a whole day prepping bechamel,pesto, eggplant, toasting hazelnuts. The pesto was good; I'd make that again. But the bechamel sauce provided a lame base for the lasagna. It was a little tasteless.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner with a vegetarian, and everyone loved it. I used more ricotta, and made the pesto a basil/parsley pesto. Next time I am going to add spinach or broccoli to add some more substance to all the creaminess. The sauce was great (I used about twice the garlic), I used the leftover to spoon over latkes a few days later and it was lovely.The noodles were a little chewy for me also. Normally, you add water for the noodles to absorb, but since this was a cream sauce and not a marinara, I was afraid it wouldn't work properly. Next time I will just use regular noodles.

Read reviews before making this. Used bottled basil pesto instead of making parsley pesto. Was relatively simple to make (my first ever attempt at lasagna). I cooked it, cooled it, cut into pieces, froze individually, then popped all the pieces into greaseproof paper-lined Tupperware and placed in freezer. Has been easy to thaw and reheat with no loss of flavour.

This was the most popular dish at my party. Everyone adored it. I made the pesto with basil because I am not a huge parsley fan, and I added sun-dried tomatoes to a few layers. I had to make a lot so it was a time consuming process, but I was running around doing other things at the same time so it could easily be done in less time than it took me.

I made this for my family one Thanksgiving and it was gone in a few minutes (mind you, we were already sufficiently stuffed from the turkey and dressing.) It was slightly labor intensive but worth it. A fantastic dish I would make again.

An excellent recipe, one to save for the future. I don't think that it took quite as long as some reviewers have said. DEFINATELY not four hours! I'd say it took me 2 1/2 to 3 hours max. I think the key is two-fold: having everything mise-en-place when you start, and then being able to multitask. For example, while the bechamel was cooking, I was toasting the hazelnuts and chopping the parsely, with occasional breaks to whisk the bechamel. Once the bechamel was done, I could dump the prepped pesto ingredients straight into the blender and puree. While the pesto was pureeing, I set the oven to preheat for the eggplant, sliced the eggplant and got it in the oven. Then I mixed up the pesto and ricotta, and even had time to put away my ingredients. Once the eggplant was done roasting, I scooped the hot eggplant into the already-prepped lasagne dish and added the rest of the layers. Then straight back into the oven, and I even got the dirty prep dishes in the washer while the lasagne was baking and resting. You just have to be time-efficient!

I agree this lasagne is labor intensive, but worth it. I made it for a dinner party last night but did a lot of prep-work over the weekend (i.e roasted the eggplant, made the pesto and béchamel). So last night all I had to do was cook the noodles, assemble, and back. It was GREAT! Definitely a do-over.

This was soooooo worth the time and effort.

I thought this was excellent and worth the time spent preparing it (made the pesto and roasted the eggplants in the morning, did the rest before dinner) but for me, the parsley flavor was just a bit too strong and unpleasant. I think next time I would substitute half of the parsley for basil. Other than that, this was fantastic. Anyone try adding nutmeg to the bechamel? Might try that next time!

This dish is delicious! I had to omit the hazelnuts (food allergy) but it was still great without them. I saved a portion of parsley pesto in the freezer so it will be faster to make next time. I'm going to try grilling the eggplant for a summer version.

When I was done making this lasagna I was afraid to taste it. The ricotta  pesto mixture was so vibrant green it looked freaky and artificial. Everyone who saw it commented on the color  but then they commented on the flavor  they loved it!!!! I made it as a test for dinner party I am having and it received 100% approval. Do not skimp on the salt  a few people said it needed salt. Definitely try it! Louise

This lasagne is ridiculously good. It does take a while to make (about 3 and 1/2 hours), but the presentation was gorgeous and the taste was out of this world. It was loved and raved about by vegetarians and meat-lovers both. My only suggestion is to make less parsley pesto than suggested, as it's kind of hard to find a great way to use the leftover stuff.

I had higher hopes for this recipe  it was tasty but the flavors were too subtle for my liking  and all the parmesan made it saltier than I like as well.

Very rich but missing a certain something, a bit of 'oomph'. No note really stands out which makes it a good way to disguise eggplant if you have picky little ones. It's not bland, but subtle and very milky. A bit too subtle for me. It does age well and I think much better the next day. Even so, if I make this again, I'll be using less bechamel and perhaps adding some spicy sausage. Overall, it's an overwhelming 'eh'.

I made this recipe for a "dinner club" where everyone takes turns hosting and even eggplant doubters loved it. My friend hates nuts, so I was worried he wouldn't be a fan but he ate a huge piece and took leftovers! Two things I'd warn though: 1) I had a friend help me. If I did this alone, it would be a daunting project. It's an easy joint project since there are so many "components" to divide and conquer. 2) Those who said it was bland probably didn't season properly with salt and pepper as they went. I think it's important to liberally salt the eggplant before roasting.

This lasagna is excellent. I served the lasagna with a Merlot wine and included mushrooms in the layers of the lasagna (its a great addition if you enjoy mushrooms). I also sprinkled the mushrooms on the top and covered them with a generous amount of Ramanoa-Parmesan cheese. The result was excellent. Great work epicurious!

My 15 year old daughter and I made this for dinner the Friday after Thanksgiving. It was delicious and not nearly as much work as I had expected. My wife and other daughters raved about it, more so than the turkey I'd cooked the day before. I used whole wheat pasta noodles and added a bit more eggplant than the recipe called for, about 5 pounds. It was excellent. We will certainly make this recipe again.

This is a fabulous recipe, but I would hesitate to make it again, only because it is truly labor intensive. I roasted and removed the hazelnut skins and washed all of the parsley the day before, thinking I would cut down on the prep time, but it didn't seem to work according to plan. I made this for my vegetarian son, home for the holidays, but it was so wonderful every non-vegetarian I know would love this stuff. I followed the recipe exactly. Writing about it recalls memories of how good this was and I'm ready to march into the kitchen and make another batch. Forget the labor--this is worth it.

Delicious. Took me 1.5 hours to make it, and I even used purchased basil pesto (no time to make the parsley pesto). The recipe says it takes 10 minutes to reduce the bechemel sauce, but it took me more like 30. I was afraid of scalding it, but next time I'll crank up the heat to speed up the reduction (and getting it to the boil stage). Also, would try adding chicken and spinach for extra flavor. But a very wonderful lasagne as is. We all enjoyed it alot.

Excellent! Doubled the recipe, froze one without baking. Defrosted to room temp and baked later with success. Had extra bechamel & ricotta pesto mix, so roasted another eggplant and got more noodles to make a third lasagne - though it was only two layers. I used fresh pasta, as I prefer the taste and never have problems with it being chewy. Next time I probably wouldn't bother with the pesto/oil drizzle as I didn't think it added a lot, so will cut back on the pesto.

This is a little time intensive, but the result is a light, fresh and delightfully different lasagna. I substituted fresh basil for half of the pesto and added a pound of browned ground turkey to one layer. Absolutely delicious. It is so creamy and the eggplant and bechamel almost melt together. This will be a make-ahead staple from now on.

This is very labor intensive, but worth it as a filling, meatless main course for a dinner party. Definitely make it the day before and reheat. You'll need all four eggplants, so use a third cookie sheet if you need one. I didn't have hazelnuts, substituted pine nuts successfully (watch out -- they toast very quickly!) It served 8 people easily, and was enough for more than a few second helpings. Perfect for a buffet with salad and crusty bread.

This is a nice change to the regular tomato sauce lasagna recipes. We really enjoyed this one. I made a few changes but i don't think that it affected the richness of the lasagna. I used skim milk for the bechamel sauce, and i didn't have hazelnuts on hand, so i threw in some ground almond. I found it took me about an hour or so for prep work. You should really try this recipe it is a keeper...yum!

The Parsley Pesto is fantastic. I have used it for many other recipes and dips. I love eggplant and would increase the amount used in this recipe. Home made lasagne would take care of any "toughness" experienced in the cooking.

Rating: 3
Time consuming and definitely better reheated. This also helps with the chewy-pasta problem noted above. I let the bechemal be a little watery and made sure to put plenty of it near the pasta, so I didn't have a problem with chewy pasta. I had more ricotta filling than expected and until it was cooked down 1 or 2 reheatings later, the ricotta layer was too thick to be ideal. Overall, the recipe was considerably richer than we're used to eating in these days of reduced cholesterol, even though I'd used canola oil and a light tub margarine and skim milk to make the bechemal. The bechemal didn't suffer for it and I regret that I didn't use part-skim or even skim ricotta. If I do it again, it will be as an appetizer for a fancy meal or for a buffet. It's better in small doses.

Rating: 4
This was OUTRAGEOUS. And the best part is -- it's even better re-heated! So, for a casual dinner party, make the (admittedly labor-intensive) lasagne the day before, bake it, and throw it in the fridge. On the day of the party, all you have to do is re-heat it and serve it with a nice salad. Voila! Your guests will be impressed.

I made this and many other Gourmet dishes for Thanksgiving 2003. We had so much food, we didn't eat the lasagne until the next day, when we paired it with a wonderful salad. The flavors in this dish melded together perfectly -- the eggplant, hazelnuts, olive oil, parsley, and garlic. I did NOT use whole milk, as specified in the recipe. I used nonfat lactose-free milk, and the dish was perfect. Unlike many lasagne dishes, this one slices into lovely, firm servings that maintain their shape on the plate. Perfect for a casual dinner party.

I used spinach as the main ingredient for the pesto; although I still used a good handful of the parsley. The dish turned out very nice; the hazelnut really did the trick. The taste blended really well. And having the eggplant roasted with as little oil as possible, it turned out to be less soggy and helps hold a good texture even after being baked. The lasagne though, was a bit too chewy for me too. otherwise, absolutely great!

I would give this 4 forks but it was time-consuming. However, I didn't plan ahead and did the shopping and prep all the same day as the dinner. I needed 3 pans to hold all the eggplant, but all 4 eggplants were needed to complete 3 layers. I added 2 Tablespoons of olive oil to the butter and flour to get a smoother roux. But those were the only changes and otherwise cooked it exactly as directed. The no-bake noodles were outstanding and saved yet another step. The parsley pesto with hazelnuts is awesome and will become part of my repertoire. Would ground lamb or beef make it into a wonderful moussaka?

Wow this is so rich and yummy. It took more time than I realized so I ended up doing the prep and then going out to dinner. After dinner I assembled it and cooked it that evening and then reheated it the next day. It seemed that the flavors really melded well. It took about 50 minutes to reheat. My husband was actually moaning while he ate it and recommending that I make it for guests even though he doesn't usually like eggplant. The hazelnuts are really important and give this such a nice flavor.

I think this is only the 2nd dish I've rated as 4 forks on this site, but I think it deserves it. Having said that, I've made it without (yep, without) the lasagne leaves, just layered the sauces between roasted eggplant slices and grilled zucchini and it was great, and less carbs. I tried it as written also - well received by all.

This truly rates the 4-stars. People had not just seconds, but thirds. But I must confess: I went to 3 stores and could find no flat leaf parsley so I major-cheated and used fresh commercial (basil-based) pesto. It was still fabulous and would doubltless rate 5 stars if made as written. I also used fresh pasta sheets - probably an improvement.

Rating: 4
This recipes takes some time, but the end product is wonderful. My husband absolutely loved it. I took the dish to a party at work and got great reviews. I am not much of a dairy person, so I increased the amount of parsley and pepper to add more flavor. I also squeezed the oil out of the eggplant after roasting. This lessons the amount of oil left in the eggplant and also takes the itch out of the eggplant for those of us that are sensitive to it. This is definately a do again in my house.
