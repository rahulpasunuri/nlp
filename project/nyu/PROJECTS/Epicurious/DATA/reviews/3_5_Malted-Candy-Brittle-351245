This is really good. It took me only about 6 minutes on med-high heat. You can just watch to make sure it's not burning. it's easy to tell. the treat is marvelous

I think perahps I didn't cook the sugar mixture long enough. When I poured it into the cookie sheet it turned into a big soft lump. Tasted good but it was hardly brittle. I'm also wondering if brown sugar can be substituted.

This was pretty easy, made it twice (as suggested, haha)-once for trying and once for gifting. The first time I think I let the sugar get too dark because as soon as I took the pot off the heat I smelled the bitter burnt sugar. I made the second batch and took it off the heat as soon as I saw a few dark golden streaks in the pool of light amber. This smelled much better.
