My special version: use 1/2 the brown sugar - reduced fruit for about 45 minutes, buttered baking dish - for the bottom crust I used 1 broken pistachio, apricot scone from the Wedge Coop (cutting up the pistachio and apricots). Then the layer of fruit and then a raw fruit and nut (w coconut) mix that had been toasted layered on top. Warm at 350 for 10 minutes and served with vanilla rice cream. Delish!

I made these squares as written using fresh local fruit (I live in Hawaii) and enjoyed them. I made them a second time and omitted the brown sugar from the fruit & found it sweet enough for my taste. I added a cup of sweetened coconut flakes to the crust, which added a flavor dimension that complemented the tropical fruit medley perfectly. Tips for the fruit filling: It is worth doubling it. Make sure you chop the pineapple into small pieces. When the fruit cooks down it becomes like jam, and since the pineapple pieces stay intact, they need to be small. Ultimately I choose to put the fruit in a blender to make the fruit consistency more uniform. Also, I omitted the sugar for health reasons & did not miss it. Tips for the crust: I found this crust difficult to roll out. Instead I simply pressed the dough ball crust into the bottom of the pan & up the sides. For the lattice top I rolled the dough into long strips (like play dough snakes) and lay them on top. This worked well & was easy. Also, I added 1 cup of shredded sweetened coconut flakes. The result was a delicious and healthy treat that could be eaten at any time of the day.

I first saw this recipe in the August 2000 issue and have always wanted to make them. I finally got around to trying it out. Although they came out good and people enjoyed them, I'm not sure it was one of those recipes where I would say, "I'm definitely making these again." They were tasty, but for me it will not be on my "keeper" list. I've made other shortbread/fruit filling squares that I like far better. That being said, I am so glad I did make these squares as I always wanted to... you never know unless you try :)

I used guava instead of mango, as it's what I had on hand (and I wanted to use it up). Also, I did a solid top crust, rather than a lattice one. (It seemed like too much trouble for this dish.) To me, these were just okay -- something different. However, to the rest of the crowd, they were a hit! I was quite surprised they went over so incredibly well. Still, I'm only giving two forks, and it's likely I won't make them again -- at least not for myself!

I made these last night. fresh papaya, mango and canned pineapple. Came out nice but my lattice looked terrible -like a window screen after the cat has been at it trying to get out - so I covered the top with a layer of unsweetened coconut flakes and topped it wth coconut liquor. oh! wonderful

My friends loved this tart. I served it lukewarm and it was still very good even on a hot afternoon!

to the previous cook, making a compote is a good idea, especially as i'm watching the weight.

Please note that I made ONLY the fruit part of this dessert, for use as a compote to be served with yogurt. I doubled the recipe and used about 1/3 c each of orange juice and orange marmalade, and then only 1/2 c dark brown sugar. I also omitted the lemon rind. I cooked it on the stovetop for an hour, and it reduced to 4 c of delicious, fragrant, spicy-sweet sauce...which I'm enjoying as I type this review. I'll definitely make this again, and will share this with others who appreciate something different.

I made this dish for a Jamaican dinner night I had with friends. In Wisconsin we don't have access to many good exotic fresh fruits in the winter (as you can imagine!) so I substituted canned pineapple, figs, papaya and peaches for the recipie. It turned out very good! The crust was a little hard to work with, but it came out so yummy--definately worth it!

The filling is absolutely delicious. It is mango season here in Costa Rica and juicy pineapples and payayas are always available, so it was a good opportunity to try this recipe. I doubled the recipe and substituted three whole cloves instead of ground cloves. You can also jar the filling for giving away with a copy of the recipe for a nice little gift.

If you don't like papaya you will change your mind once you taste it here. I did!!!

Not worth the long time it took to make it. We all enjoyed it, but it was nothing terribly special. I was glad I also had a pina colada cake for our Carribbean dinner night!

WONDERFUL!! Everyone who tasted them raved about these squares. I made them exactly as the recipe, and they were heaven. This is a recipe to keep!

The taste buds of all around our table (seven at that moment from ages 3 years to 70 years) gave it the high five. I have one question---how does one get 4 cup of solid fruit to boil down to 1 & 1/2 cups?! Believe I got it down to 2 & 1/2 cups and it turned out divine. Instead of making pastry strips for the topping I simply crumbled the dough and dispersed it evenly on the top.
