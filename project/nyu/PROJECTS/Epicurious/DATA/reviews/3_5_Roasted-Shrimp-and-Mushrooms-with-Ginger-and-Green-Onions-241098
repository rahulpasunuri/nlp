Well, I made too little of the marinade for the anount of shrimp that I had, I had bought small shrimp and the recipe is for big, the next time I make it and there will be a next time, I will do it right because it was delicious, I wanted to eat the marinade by its self...it smelled so good. I served it with cold pasta salad and green salad.

I made this with a bag of frozen peeled large shrimp. I doubled the marinade, let the the shrimp soak in the mixture for about 15 minutes, and put the whole thing on a baking sheet. The shrimp came out so delicious! I served these with a quick vegetable stir fry seasoned with soy sauce, sherry and sesame oil, and sticky white rice. Really good, and pretty!

I love this recipe. My only change is that I take off the shells prior to cooking. It doesn't affect the cooking time.

awesome weeknight dinner when served with plain white rice and a salad. very easy and the oyster mushrooms are a nice changeup from the everyday!

I read all the reviews before making this dish. I must admit I changed the recipe slightly - utilizing Thai Basil instead of cilantro. I think if you were a cilantro fan, you would probably really enjoy this dish. It was tasty... I eyeballed and doubled the sauce/marinade because we were making more than 10 shrimp and I wanted to do the mushrooms at the same time. I marinated for about 2 hours. The dish was a little sharp - at the end, I ended up adding a little sugar and a little Golden Mountain Sauce. Probably wont make again, but still enjoyed dinner.

This was delicious! I probably doubled the green onion mixture because i used more shrimp--sorry but 5 shrimp doesn't cut it for me. I used shiitakes and I chopped up some asparagus, too. Threw it all in a bowl to marinade for 1 hour, then put on a baking sheet and put the whole thing in the oven for about 10 minutes. Super simple, super healthy and delicious. Served w jasmine rice. Will certainly make again.

I followed this recipe except did not leave the shells on when cooking and used wild bolete mushrooms that had been dried previously, reconstituted and sauteed briefly before roasting. Also, as one other reviewer mentioned, let the shrimp marinate in the seasoning for a few hours in the refrigerator. My wife and I found this very good though think it would be better as an appetizer in smaller portions due to the richness of flavors and ingredients. Served it with roasted fresh garden carrots seasoned with lemon zest, maple syrup, salt and pepper. Very good and satisfying meal. I think it would go well with white sticky rice as long as you don't expect a sauce for the rice.

This was easy, healthy and very refreshing. I made it ahead of time as a take to work lunch - loved it!

The shrimp came out perfect in just a little over 7 mins - very moist and flavorful! 3 forks is because it was such a pain to devein, remove legs and rub seasonings under the shell. I will definitely look for a work-around next time.

As another reviewer, I'm giving this four forks because it is very tasty for how incredibly fast and easy it is. I chopped the green onions, cilantro and garlic in a mini food processor (separately) and placed the shrimp, mushrooms and some asparagus onto the roasting pan together. 7 minutes, it was ready. Also, from another suggestion, I removed everything from the roasting pan when it was done and scraped the drippings into some white jasmine rice. The mushrooms needed a bit of salt & pepper, and I didnt take the legs off the shrimp (dont know why youd need to do that, but I skipped it and it came out fine) this is a keeper!

I thought this was good but gave it all 4 forks because it was so fast, easy, and healthy. I decreased the amount of oil to about 2 tablespoons and it worked great. I also had to use crimini's because my store was out of oysters. I think I liked the mushrooms even more than the shrimp.

very fresh tasting...quick to make....cannot see anyone poo poo-ing this recipe unless they did not use all of the ingredients....I used 3 tsp. of ginger instead of 2....I also used 2 large cloves of garlic...just my preference....tasted fantastic.....will make again for an app. for my next dinner party or bbq.

Nothing special. Kind of bland.

This was a very easy and super delicious recipe. I actually used only mushrooms, but did a mix of portobello, white button and oyster mushrooms. It was a really wonderful side dish. One note: definitely spread around the sauce, or it tends to clump. Still delicious, but nicer when it spreads evenly. When not cooking for a vegetarian I will definitely include the shrimp.

Quick, easy, flavorful. Skip the shell-stuffing as previously suggested & mix it all in there. I stirred in cooked rice at the end.

I made it with portobellini and put them in the oven 15 minutes before de shrimp, then added the shrimp and cooked for exactly 7 minutes; they were very good and tasty, and also healthy. Ididn´t have a messy stove afterwards. Very good!

I made this with shelled shrimp and shitakes. Marinated the shrimp for several hours and then added the mushrooms. I served it with a baguette to get all the sauce and we thought it was wonderful. Fresh ingredients are critical here and generous amounts of all. Make sure you use a big enough casserole dish so that everything is in a single layer, you don't want to overcook the shrimp. My husband said he could eat it every week!

This recipe was delicious! After heeding the advice of others this dish turned out great. I recommend using de-shelled shrimp, generous amounts of the spices, and place the meal in a baking dish so the ingredients can absorb the sauce. I also made risotto (rice) with chicken broth on the side which added a nice touch to the meal. The sauce could probably be made ahead of time.

From what I hear this is delicous...I haven't tried my hand at making this yet and missed it -- but I now have the recipe :)

This one was so-so. I removed the shells and grilled them on skewars. I won't make it again.

Oh yeah, and I used frozen shrimp, deveined shrimp. To those who thought the recipe was bland, you must have followed the recipe too closely. You've got to add more of all the good stuff that makes it yummy. Mine had incredible flavor.

I made this for some friends that aren't really into shrimp and they said it was the best shrimp they had ever had. Instead of cooking on a baking sheet, I combined the shrimp and all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and then poured the whole thing into a ceramic baking dish. After 7 minutes I stirred the shrimp and cooked another 7 minutes. Absolutely delicious, and because I baked the shrimp in all the yummy juice, I see no problem in using shelled shrimp next time. Then you don't have to get your fingers all messy while your eating...and you can eat more, faster!

This is, far and away, the worst epicurious recipe that I've made. It was incredibly bland. I suppose it could have been jazzed up somehow but it's not worth tinkering with in my opionion. There are many other good shrimp recipes on this site. Steer clear of this one.

This was just blah. Not worth trying to improve. Sorry I made it.

I used very large shrimp and removed the shells. They are easier to devein and the shrimp take on all the flavors of the herb mixture. The mushrooms rocked the casbah. This recipe is a winner.

Awesome - boyf loved this one! Easy, delicious, and a very nice looking dish to serve. I made a couple of minor changes - I used peeled shrimp, and shitakes rather than oysters. I sprinkled some of the herb mixture over the shrimp & mushrooms since there were no shells to rub the herbs under. I served it with the roasted asparagus, as suggested - boyf would have liked to have rice as a side as well.

I doubled the recipe and used deviened shrimp w/o the shells. We accompanied it w/ roasted asparagus and a lemon thai rice. This was fantastic for entertaining another couple and super quick and easy!

This was incredibly simple. My only problem with it was that I wrongfully used shimp that were too small. Use really big shrimp. The mushrooms were out of this world. I roasted some asparagus along with it also, as suggested. Will make this again.
