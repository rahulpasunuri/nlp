This was pretty good. I would make it again as it added a nice colorful side dish. I think you have to adjust the sweetness depending on your other sides. It got a little mushy on the reheating so I'll be more careful to undercook it if i pre-make it and finish prior to serving. Nice combo of flavors.

i made this for thanksgiving and it was really tasty and not overly sweet. this recipe is soo simple, but i wouldnt change a thing except to put some cinnamon in it. i used unsweetened cranberries and soaked them in orange juice. i will be making this for thanksgiving from now on.

Really liked the sweetness; I'm going to try it with a little less butter next time. Tasted even better as leftovers than it did right out of the oven.

I have been making this dish every thanksgiving since it was first introduced. It is a beautiful colorful addition to the table.

This was very good and easy. I skipped the boiling step at the beginning and roasted instead (for about 20 minutes before proceeding with the recipe as written). It just seemed like a waste of a big pot of water. Followed everything else exactly and it was yummy. Not a "dish beyond compare" but "delicious" for sure.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I had to make a second batch because my daughter and I ate half the first batch standing at the stove! Easy to do variations also. Served it on Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. The person who thought it didn't have flavor must not like yams!

I adjusted the proportions of this recipe and it was great - less yams and less butter, same amounts of the other ingredients. Not bland at all. The sweet/tart taste was really nice.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I was hoping that this would be a nice balance of yam flavor, with a touch of sweetness. What resulted instead was just blandness. The maple syrup never formed a thick glaze, despite an extended baking. I should have stuck with my mom's tried and true recipe!

After reading the reviews, I was extremely disappointed with the turn out. There was very little flavor - I even added brown sugar, more orange zest, ginger and cinnamon to help it out, but it was still pretty bland. I did mash the potatoes as some other reviewers suggested and looked much nicer.

Quick, easy, and delicious. Made this for Thanksgiving. Made it the day before and just popped it in the oven. I used both the red and white flesh sweet potatoes so the color contrast was great especially with the cranberries. Not too sweet, perfect with the turkey.

Very good side dish. The maple, orange and cranberry flavors were very complimentary to the sweet potatoes. We too baked it longer than suggested for a softer consistency -- but not overcooked or mushy! Will absolutely make again.

This tasted great! I did not mash them, but I did boil them a little longer than 3 minutes to be sure the yams were soft enough. The blend of flavors was perfect--not too sweet, not too bland. I couldn't resist sprinkling chopped pecans on top and drizzling more maple syrup over it. Fabulous and a wonderful change from the norm.

I agree with those who recommend a longer baking time; I like my potatoes baked to a softness. I do like the departure from the usual sticky-sweetness of Thanksgiving sweet potato fare. But I also like my flavors stronger... perhaps a dash of ginger next time would liven it up.

Everyone had seconds and those who typically do not like yams were converted! Made it late the night before BUT had no maple syrup so substituted a simple syrup of brown sugar. Had to literally restrain myself when it came out of the oven. Flavors blended beautifully. Only three forks because I didn't honor the recipe faithfully (left out cranberries) but will add this year. Try it!

This is fabulous! I made it for Christmas then was asked to make it again for a New Years' Party. It's been a huge hit! I mashed the sweet potatoes and the presentation is much nicer. I ran out of fresh orange so used dried lemon peel the second time and the recipe did not suffer - if anything - it was better!

A huge hit at Christmas dinner, and no one would believe that it wasn't hard to make. Even the non-cranberry folks really like this. I think the orange peel makes all of the difference. Be sure to use fresh zest (not the jarred stuff) and don't skimp!

My mother-in-law asks me to make this recipe every year, everyone loves it. I mash the yams though, it looks nicer.

Ever since I made this recipe it is requested every year at every holiday meal by my family. It is easy to make and very delicious.

I tested this recipe and the mashed yams and apples for a dinner party. I liked the complex flavour of this one and I will be using it.

This wasn't quite as tasty as I had hoped. With so many other wonderful yam recipes, this one isn't worth the effort.

Rating: 3
Don't usually like yams, but this was very good without being too sweet. Next time will make entirely all the way through, and re-heat to serve. Is MUCH better the second day. Truly a make-ahead dish. Also, mash up the yams when cooked; the texture's better and they're more eye-appealing.

This is worth making again! I am not a sweet potato lover..but it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without sweet potatoes. I made the dish the night before and added the dried cranberries, and some of the oranges juice at that time. On hour before the turkey was ready I baked it at 350* for an hour.

Easy to make and prepare ahead of time. Absolutely delicious. Everyone had seconds, even people who don't normally like yams. My only suggestion is the bake time needs to be longer, at least an hour.

This dish was easy and very good. I almost boiled the yams to long prior to baking. I thought that 3 minutes sounded to quick but I was wrong. This is a colorful dish that has a very interesing combination of flavors. This dish goes well w/ both poultry and beef.

Not being a yam lover this dish made a difference and simple to make.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it, so i'm making it again for christmas. I think the reason we all liked it was the cranberries, they give the recipe an extra zing! I'm sure this recipe will be made again and again over the years.

a hit at thanksgiving dinner. baked it longer than recommended, made it a day ahead up until before adding cranberries. basting and stirring v. important. and 1 inch pieces means 1-inch cubes, not slices !!! although my 1-inch thick yam patties turned out to be very good too !

It would have been delicious if I had remembered to put it on the table. The ones that did try it after dinner really liked it. I'll try again for Christmas.

My Thanksgiving guests loved it. Not too sweet. The cranberry and orange flavors were a wonderful combination with the yams. I cooked it longer than the recipe indicated. Basting was very important, I think.

Delicious, and very pretty.

For a greater sweet sour contrast use a bag of fresh cranberries in stead of dried ones. Olive oil lovers can substitue for the butter.
