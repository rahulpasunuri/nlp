I have made this recipe many times and it is still a favorite - especially when I have fresh cabbage coming out of the garden. I use sweet Vidalia onions, Dijon country-style mustard and extra hot horseradish. Easy and healthy.

I only had a small head of geriatric cabbage - so rather than just wilt it, I let it cook at a low simmer for longer. I added more horseradish, as suggested, and a bit of Dijon to the coarse-grained mustard for more bite. I also added the sauce to the cabbage for the last 10 or 15 minutes of cooking. It was delicious and I would certainly serve it to cabbage-loving guests - it could easily be made the day before and re-heated. It felt virtuous as well - up until we tried this recipe our favourite cabbage dish included heavy cream and bacon! a keeper.

I thought this was delicious! Simple, ingredients that I normally have on hand and not just plain ol; boring steamed cabbage. I'm not much of a cooked cabbage fan to start with, but I really liked this dish and my husband said it was excellent! I left out the flour and used a little butter at that juncture and reduced it a little; wonderful side dish!

Easy to put together recipe. I used about 1/4 cup of bottle horseradish and a couple of tablespoons of mustard. Think I will skip the flour next time and cut back to two tbs of butter.

Good twist for the bland cabbage for St. Patricks. Added horseradish and mustard to-taste - much more than what the recipe suggests.

While my husband went back for seconds, I think that was just because he was hungry. This was dull and mono-dimensional.

We devoured this! SO quick and easy. I used extra horseradish (doubled it) and napa cabbage (because that's what I had on hand). It's similar to an Indian recipe I've made before which calls for black mustard seeds, so I threw in a few of those with the onions. Delicious!

Well, I guess I wish I had read ALL the reviews before I made this to accompany corned beef for an early St. Patrick's Day dinner. Definitely ho-hum. And I happen to like cabbage, mustard and horseradish.

I don't normally like cabbage or horseradish - but this is amazing. I wish I could remember the name of the stone ground mustard I used, because it too was amazing. This is buttery, sweet and has a slight swist of sharp to it that keeps you eating, and eating and eating. Make it, use a good mustard, and you won't be sorry.

So Easy! This was delicious, even before adding the horseradish and mustard! The cabbage comes out tender and the sauce gives it just enough kick. I like my food pretty spicy, so I added more mustard and horseradish than the recipie called for.

Simple to make and calling for basic kitchen staples, this recipe is very tastey. I used a tablespoon of horseradish and two teaspoons of flour, but otherwise followed the recipe. We'll have it again next week!

Fantastic recipe! I am a vegetarian and I'm always on the make for inventive ways to use my favorite veggies, of which cabbage is one. I doubled the quantities of mustard and horseradish, and I also added capers. Yum!
