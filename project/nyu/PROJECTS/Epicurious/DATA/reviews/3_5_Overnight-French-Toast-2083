We enjoy an Easter Breakfast each year with about 25 people and they rave about this French Toast. We so enjoy it and it is very easy to make. We prepare it the night before and pop it into the oven the next morning, guest arrive to sweet smells and yummy food and there is never anything left of this recipe.

I have baked this recipe forever, and forever becomes a favorite of whoever has it for the first time. About the "crisp" issue: I bake it in a small roasting pan and after about 40 minutes it goes under the broiler with a sprinkle of cinnamon and a dusting of powder sugar. It always turns out a perfect "French toast". Some times I have sliced a couple of apples and sauteed them with a bit of butter and some brown sugar only until tender and put them between the bread slices for those who are not into syrups and want something sweet with their toast. For those who are watching their diet I usually have a bowl of sliced fruit with a touch of Grand Marnier, but also a bowl of freshly whipped cream, and at least two different kinds of syrups. Best brunch dish one could hope for either to entertain or for a quiet, relaxing Sunday at home.

Made this for the first time Christmas morning this year. We topped it with bananas and a little whipped cream. It was amazing and will be our new tradition! The next version I make, I think I will bake it a little longer and will also add a little orange zest to it. Great recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I prepared it as is and followed the directions according to the recipe. It was light and fluffy and very flavorful. I did add some cinnamon on the top. I would definitely make this again.

My husband typically doesn't like french toast but this time he said he really liked it. I prepared it as is. It is very easy to make. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top and baked it in the oven for 45 minutes as other reviewers suggested. It came out great. Oh and I forgot to make the walnut syrup. It was even good plain.

Was a great dish for "A 3rd birthday breakfast at the park I did stir in cinnamon the night before. I did cook at 375 for about 45 minutes. That seemed to brown the top a little. I did one with just putting the sliced bread not cutting it up. That dish looked prettier; tasted the same. Then lightly sprinkled powdered sugar on the top. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Used light cream for a richer texture...dish was quite good and made for a relaxed morning with my guests...will cook this many times!

This is by far the most delicious French Toast I've ever made. Leaving the bread overnight to soak up all that deliciousness makes for the most flavorful French Toast I've ever tasted. However, just baking the bread didn't put any color on it--I even tried backing it nearly twice as long as the recipe called for, and still no color. I like my French Toast to be crispy and golden brown on the outside. So I ended up heating a cast iron skillet very hot and dropping each piece of bread in (after the baking), about 15 seconds each side. The result was perfectly browned, crispy delicious French Toast!

Great recipe. Perfect when having overnight guests. To lighten it a bit, I omitted the butter and sprayed the dish which worked fine. Also, no need to flip during baking. I added a little cinnamon sugar on top before baking and baked about 20 minutes to get a crispy finish.

Made this last weekend for family and it worked really well! I made it the AM before (i.e. 24hrs before breakfast) so that I would be free. I used a white artisanal bread from my grocery store and sprinkled with some oatmeal, flax seed, blueberries and cinnamon for some colour. I also used brown sugar instead of white and actually used all LF-skim milk (that's all I had available). It went over really well! It was rich enough with the skim milk. I did end up baking for 45 min (at 350) for crispy goldenish french toast. It's a keeeper!

my brunch company loved it. Used Challah. Only change I made was replacing some of the milk with OJ for additional flavor. I think the technique is great and easy and probably can be changed around quite a bit.

Rating: 4
I followed recommendations to NOT do the overnight bread soaking. I cut sugar amount in half and used 3/4 c. half and half; 3/4 c. 2% milk. Also used cinnamon bread and dipped each slice in egg mixture before putting in butter coated pan. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes. You could bake it less depending in thickness of bread. It was crispy, flavorful and much easier than frying each piece. We loved it.

This is a great no-fuss special occasion breakfast. Based on the previous reviewer's suggestion I tried it with a pumpkin challah and it was fantastic. Delicious!

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice. The first time I used French Bread and the second time challah that I cut about an inch thick. Both times I had to cook it longer than the recipe. The first time was okay but I thought it was much better with the challah. The 2nd time I also used fresh fruit drizzled with maple syrup instead of the walnuts. Would definitely make it again but might try using a little less butter!

Rating: 4
This was fantastic made just as written. I did cook it a little longer than stated just so it would "crisp up" a little. My husband said it was the best french toast he's ever eaten and I would have to agree. I did sprinkle a little cinnamon on top just before baking.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was awful. I did use an Italian-style homemade bread instead of French bread, but I don't know if that was the difference or not. It came out of the oven gummy with no golden color at all. If I did make this again, I'd do the toast in a skillet instead of the oven.

This recipe is great and I will make it again. But I would like to ask all of you who review recipes to rate the EXACT RECIPE....not what you changed it to because that should have its own review. When I read 4 stars then I think this is a fabulous recipe I should make. If I read all the way through, I see you've changed quite a few ingredients and it's no longer the recipe I thought it was.

I made this for brunch today & it got rave reviews. I took notes from some of the other reviews. I used cinnamon swirl bread, cut the sugar in 1/2 and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes without flipping. The walnuts were a nice addition to the syrup-both in flavor & appearance. I'll definitely make it again. Yum!

VERY EASY!!! Made this for Mother's day brunch and it was an absolute hit; nothing was left over! I used challah braed instead of french bread and baked it about 12-14 min on each side for the perfect crispiness. Instead of maple syrup I made a Blueberry Compote, it was a perfect compliment to the french toast!

Rating: 4
perfect...delish. i cut and left out the bread for a day and it did not get mushy...just perfect. guests LOVED it. I left the walnuts as whole halfs and they looked and tased really great It did take me more like 30 min to bake...15 each side.

perfect recipe..so good will make again and again. I used texas toast and will try a good french bread next time. Because my texas toast was so big I had to use 2 cookie sheets (6 on each) and did 15 minutes on 1st side, flipped, then 10 more minutes and it was perfectly crisp and delicious. i want to make more right now.

Served this toast for Easter brunch, it was it huge hit. On the advice of other reviewers, I used less sugar (only about a tablespoon), and added some cinnamon to the liquid mixture. Had I used the entire amount of sugar called for in the recipe, the toast would have been much too sweet. I also increased the cooking time to 15 min. per side. Will definitely make this again since it is so convenient to pop into the oven the morning it is served, with no work required that day.

Made this recipe for Easter Brunch and it was a huge hit! I used Challah, doubled the recipe and it served 15 people. I did not turn over the bread mid way as noted - no need to. Served it with other dishes.Will definitely make it again. Everyone asked for the recipe!

Made this for a brunch with adults and kids and everyone loved it. The fact that you make it in about 5 minutes the night before makes for a stress free morning. Very rich and delicous. I sprinked it with cinnamon sugar before I baked it.

Like a few have expressed, I like my french toast a little crispy on the outside. I still baked according to the directions, but after that, I put the oven to broil for about 5 minutes and that did the trick nicely without having to dirty a frying pan. Good stuff.

Very good starting point - I had made overnight French Toast baked with all of the egg mixture before, but it was a little too much like bread pudding; like one of the other reviewers, I too like my French Toast a little crispy, so I baked mine 10-11 minutes per side on a non- stick cookie sheet sprayed with butter-flavored spray. While the toast was baking, I was able to get everything else for breakfast prepared, so breakfast was all ready at the same time, and we were able to sit down together instead of one of us cooking the French Toast while the others ate!

This was delicious. I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and I followed the recipe pretty close to as written. I used challah bread, omitted the maple syrup and subbed 1T Brown sugar instead. I also never flipped the bread (I forgot about that step-oops!) and cooked it for about 20-25 minutes instead because I like my french toast to have a nice crisp outer crust to it. I served it with powdered sugar sprinkled on top, whipped cream and berries. It turned out delicious and my kids (3 and 15 months) loved it--went back for seconds. It is a very rich and filling dish so smaller pieces work great. This was so easy and no fuss--I'm DEFINITELY going to make this every year at Christmas.

Rating: 3
I followed this recipe but didn't soak overnight, just let it soak for a few minutes before baking. I had to bake for longer than recipe calls for. After baking 1o mins, I transferred to a baking sheet and baked another 10 minutes until it was less soggy. Was a bit sweet, so I omitted the powdered sugar. Would make again, definitely.

Rating: 4
Definitely do the two-layer toast. Used good cinnamon raisin bread from a local bakery--definitely worth it! Loved the suggestion to drizzle bits of brown sugar on top before baking! A real crowd pleaser...kids and adults alike! Made this for 10- ish people and doubling the recipe (using two layers of bread) worked great! Two cups of maple syrup not necessary...maybe one, tops.

we made a few changes to this recipe. we used powered sugar instead of regular sugar in the mix (don't ask). in addition, we used almond extract instead of vanilla extract and an exotic armenian dessert wine. we also used soy milk instead of regular milk. we also used cinammon raisin bread instead of french bread.

I'm not really a fan of pancakes or waffles,but I do love a really good french toast and this is one!!I read many of the reviews before trying the recipe myself and like some of the others I "tweaked" it a little,I used a really good Challah bread,instead of milk I used Half n'Half,added a teaspoon of cinnamon and grilled it in butter (which probably defeats the purpose of the recipe since its suppose to be FREEDOM from the skillet)because I like it crispy on the outside,not soggy.It was absolutely amazing and was not too sweet for me and my family(as someone else had stated that it was OVERLY sweet and it gave her and her husband headaches,that was very comical)This recipe is great and you should defintely give it a try.

Way too sweet, I felt ill before finishing my breakfast this morning. I don't normally put sugar and maple syrup in my french toast batter so I should have suspected but I went ahead and I'm so sorry I did. My husband and I both have headaches now. Stick with regular french toast - this is terrible!

I used Trader Joe's Texa's Toast bread for this. It's an egg-based bread similar to challah, but shaped like regular bread. I cut the slices vertically in thirds so that it would be easier to serve. I had to omit the walnuts to due allergies, but nobody seemed to miss them. I also added in 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. In going whole hog for Christmas, I did 1c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. milk. Upon the suggestion of previous reviewers, I did cook it in a metal pan (All-Clad's lasagna pan - I doubled the recipe), and ultimately, I didn't have to flip the bread to brown it. The dish did, however, have to cook a good 10-15 min longer than recommended. This is beautiful for a brunch, shower or luncheon. Serve with fruit salad and you're good to go. I do suggest, however, that you warm the syrup and the plates. It makes a BIG difference in keeping the food warm.

VERY easy to make. Wouldn't call it exceptional, but it's still a good, solid recipe. I added a little cinnamon and used honey in place of maple syrup (we were out). We had to bake it about 5 minutes longer. Everything came out beautifully.

This was a perfect addition to Easter Brunch. Everyone loved it - adults and kids alike! I added a little cinnamon and had to bake it much longer than the recipe said with using a glass dish, we actually did our egg hunt while in the oven. I served it with powdered sugar and warmed plain maple syrup. Delicious and very easy! Making it again tonight for Sunday morning breakfast.

I made this French Toast when my sister and her family stayed with us for the holidays. It's wonderful. I used Panera Bread's Cinnamon Raisin Bread (ask them to slice it thick) and I only had time to soak it for 10 minutes. No matter, it was still great. It was even good as a leftover, a couple days later. My husband loves French Toast and thought this was the best ever.

wow!!! so easy to make, and delicious! i used raisin challah bread, and added a scant 1/4c of grand marnier to the mix, then baked at 400deg for 15 mins on each side. phenomenal, easy and delicious - it even impressed my critical in-laws if that says anything. ;) a definite christmas tradition from now on!

I've made this recipe twice now, with a couple modifications. As per other reviewer's suggestions, I used Challah bread. I also replaced the maple syrup with Cointreau--just about a 1/4 cup. Additionally, I added the zest and juice of one orange and elimated the vanilla. One last modification was to use 1 c of milk and 1/2 c of fat free half and half--it adds a richer flavor. Maybe I should just submit this as a new recipe?

This is an easy do-ahead recipe that works well for stale bread, but compared to other overnight french toast recipes on this site and others, this one is really just OKAY, nothing special about the taste. Needs orange liquor or eggnog or some other special flavoring to make it more worthwhile.

Made this for Christmas morning so it could bake while we opened our gifts. It was lovely and the kids loved it. I did substitute 4 tbsp of orange liquer for the 2tbsp maple syrup. And it did require baking longer too. All in all I will not hesitate to make this again. Nice do ahead breakfast.

Great breakfast treat - will become a new family tradition for Christmas morning -- or for when we have guests visit! Agree with the "cinnamon/brown sugar" and the "15 min/15 min" comments. Suggestions: slice the bread slightly at an angle/diaganol to get larger surface area/slices. Also, note that the bread expands in the dish, so don't pack too tightly. Lastly, works great with slightly old bread, since the eggs soak in and moisten the bread. So don't worry if your french bread is a little stale...

Great way to avoid messing with the griddle! Used challah bread per some suggestions. To take full advantage of the baking method, I reduced the amount of sugar and maple syrup in the egg mixture and instead sprinkled the bread with cinnamon and brown sugar just before baking for a light caramel crust on top. It definitely needs to bake beyond 10 minutes, however. Very tasty!

Definetely a 'keeper' for those occasions that you need to do alot of prep before the day. I used a pugliese style bread, added the cinnamon and nutmeg as recommended by someone else. Brilliant! Served it with the Ham and goat cheese strata, fruit kabobs and mimosa's - the guests raved. One other note: don't use glass pans - metal baking pans are required to get the proper crispness.

Everytime I make this people love it. I do this along side the "goat cheese & artichoke strata" recipe for brunch. I agree with the cook from Needham, below. The bread you use is key. If you live in the Bay Area I highly recommend Semifreddie's Cinnamon Swirl bread. It's not sliced so, slice it into thick pieces and you won't be dissapointed!

I made this recipe for a brunch and it was delicious. I did, however, make several adjustments. First of all, I made a double recipe--a two-layer french toast. I cut challah bread into strips, filled the bottom of the 9x13, poured over the egg mixture, and then repeated a second layer. I also added a tsp. of cinnamin and a heavy 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to each layer of egg mixture. I also adjusted the baking time, and kept it in the oven for 35 minutes. It was perfect! I heated up some syrup, and was good to go!

I had to cook the french toast in the oven longer than the 14 minutes the recipe called for. Even then the egg wasn't cooked. But after I took it out of the oven, I put them on a greased griddle and finished cooking them there. They were very good that way. I will make them again and do it the same way.

This recipe was absolutely yummy but I too made a couple of adjustments. I took some of the advice of the reviewers below. I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the recipe. And then I added a crunch. After letting them sit all night, I rolled the soaked french toast in crushed cornflakes. I then put them in the oven on cookie sheets. They came out soft inside and crunchy on the outside. I heated the maple syrup with toasted pecans, instead of walnuts, and topped off the french toast with carmelized bananas. It looked great and tasted even better. Yum!! And it was so easy!!

Typical french toast, nothing special about the taste. Since french toast isn't difficult to make to begin with, I really don't see the need to make this overnight recipe. This was harder since you had to mess with the temperature to get a nicely browned meal. I like regular french toast much better. Sorry!

This was very easy and delicious! I also added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. I doubled the recipe (whoops! That was a BIG loaf of Challah bread!)and it still worked great. Because the pieces need to be placed in a single layer on the pan I had to split them between a pyrex glass dish and a regular metal baking sheet with a piece of foil. I sprayed the foil with oil and buttered the glass dish. Both worked fine. Also, at 400 degrees F, the bread browned nicely in each pan. They puff beautifully and make a pretty presentation. But, of course, they sink when cooled but by then they are almost completely eaten....

I made this dish for breakfast with friends and it was delicious. Like other reviewers, I found I had to cook it longer to get it to firm up and brown. The maple syrup in the custard helps sweeten it enough that it was yummy with some powdered sugar on top. I too added cinnamon, and would have added nutmeg if I had it. I used Sweet Hawaiin bread as well as egg bread. Don't expect beautiful slices with this recipe; we used the spatula and cut it into squares to serve.

I made this Christmas Eve morning with Challah bread. It was amazing, my husband is begging for more and my guest have already used the recipe at their own gatherings.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was delicious. Everyone liked it, especially the walnut maple syryp. Since you are taking the cold pan out of the fridge and putting it in the oven it did take longer to cook.

I added cinnamon to the egg mixture (just out of french toast habit). I found it needed to cook longer than stated and I also broiled it at the end because I like some color and crunch around the edges.

Whne making this recipe be sure not to be fooled by how much egg mixture you have - even if it seems like too much, if you use more bread it will end up being dry. Also, metal pans work better than glass or ceramic.

What a great and simple idea! Also, a wonderful use for the leftovers of French or Italian bread. I had 1/2 of a loaf of stale 2-day old French bread and (I have more breadcrumbs than I can use)and made a version of this - what I thought was way too much egg mixture was allllll soaked up by the a.m. I am not a French toast lover but my Hubby and a friend loved this and I just popped it in the oven !!! Great idea - 1 pan, it's cooked through and hot. If you are serving a group, I HIGHLY recommend this as you are not slaving at the stove!

I really liked this recipe. After I poured the liquid on the bread, I didn't have any excess liquid so that the recipe was not soggy. Very flavorful.

Much ado about nothing. If I had baked the toast in the same pan that I used for soaking I would have ended up with quiche because there was so much excess liquid. I transferred the soaked bread to a nonstick cookie sheet for baking and it still stuck. The texture of the baked bread was extremely eggy and heavy. I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

Amazing recipe! Served it for brunch and everybody wanted the recipe. A few changes - Soaked it w/o buttering dish, substituted 1/2 cup milk for crean, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter; baked it on a cookie sheet like other suggestions, at 400. It took about 20-25 minutes- in perfect time as we finished our eggs.

This is the only way I make french toast anymore. It's so nice just to pop it in the oven in the morning, and the cook gets to eat it nice and hot at the same time as everyone else. I've made it many times now, sometimes with fresh peaches or canned as one cook suggested. It always comes out delicious!

This was very good french toast and making most of it the night before a big plus. After reading the previous comments, I made some changes. Instead of cooking the toast in the pan I soaked it in, I transferred it to cookie sheets (it was sticking terribly to the other pan, despite the butter). This also speeded up the cooking time, which would indeed have been longer than the recipe says. I also reduced the sugar to 1 tsp. and it was fine.

I made this for a group of 12 for a Christmas breakfast. It was wonderful! I used 24 pieces of bread and tripled everything else in the recipe. Even though it looked like there was a bit much liquid the evening I made it, the next morning it had all soaked up into the bread. I baked it at 350 degrees instead of the 400 suggested. I baked it for 45 minutes and didn't have to broil it.

Excellent! I made slits and stuffed each slice w/ 1 T mashed banana (mix w/ a splash of lemon juice so banana doesn't discolor) I also used brown sugar instead of white and added cinnamon. I agree w/ others on baking. 425 for 20-25 minutes then broiling to finish the top worked perfectly!

I made this for a group of 7 friends recently and 5 of them asked for the recipe. I served it with walnut maple syrup. It was delicious.

I loved the convenience of preparing the night before - it puffed up during the night, which gave it an appealing look. I reserve this recipe for special occasions because it's so rich. I'm thinking of cutting down on the eggs to make it lighter. I also put it under the broiler at the last minute to give it a nice toasty appearance.

I've made this recipe several times and it always turns out great! When you're having a large party over for brunch nothing is better than being able to make something the night before.

This was excellent! I always experiment alittle, so I spread the french bread with cream cheese and sprinkled with cinnamon. Then I layered the bottom of the baking dish with peaches in their syrup. It was so moist and sweet! I served it for brunch with a sliced of glazed ham! My whole family loved it!

It took much longer than the recipe suggested to cook. I made this dish after reading all the rave reviews on this site, however, although I followed the directions precisely, the result was not as good as I had hoped. I was disappointed by the result -- the french toasts were a bit on the soggy side and I think the baking (instead of pan-frying in butter) made it less authentic. I would not make this recipe again.

My mother has made this recipe for a long time at her bed and breakfast, but with a twist. She adds peaches under the bread. Its wonderful. Just take a can of sliced peaches in heavy syrup and drain about half of the syrup off. Then you put the peches in the pan and spread them out. Sprinkle some brown sugar on top or mix it in with the batter. When you have finished just pepare the rest of the recipe like it says and you will have a truley sweet breakfast.

This french toast is much better than the usual preparation. The following are correct about the baking time. I had to up the temp to 425 degrees for 15 minutes on the first side and 10-12 minutes on the other side. The recipe is also open to small variations, like the gran marnier. I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg mixture. This is too easy and delicious to pass over.

It is delicious and perfect for using old Hallach bread. I did not butter the bread, but did add half and half as part of the milk . I did take twice as long in the oven

Everyone liked this dish. In retrospect, I would dip the bread slices in the egg wash before putting them in the buttered pan. I added cinammon and cut back on the sugar considerably. The amount of liquid seemed about right, but I also baked the toast longer.

My daughter and i made this together, that was fun .We used maple nut bread,which is delicious.As far as to bake or to fry no big deal. maybe white bread is diffrent.

I cooked this about 15 minutes longer than it called for, and it still was not enough. Similar recipes call for cooking it up to 50 minutes, I think this would make it much better. When I reheated the left overs, it was execellent.

I've found this dish to be a wonderufl crowd pleaser. My toddler even loves this dish as finicky as she is. I lined the pan with aluminium foil which made the clean-up so quick and easy. I will definatly make this dish again.

I made this dish for Christmas and everyone loved it. This is now a family tradition. I added cinnamon to the egg mixture and sprinkled some on top of the bread before baking.

This recipe was very good and easy but I found I had to cook it a little longer and flip it a few times.I also just used regular syrup without adding the walnuts and it was still delicious!

I used the large, square and very thick Texas Toast for this recipe. Next time I will make another half-batch of egg/milk mixture as the bread was somewhat dry. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mixture and my guests loved it.

I made two changes to this recipe with excellent results. First, I added a shot of Grand Marnier to the egg mixture. Second, I baked the french toast at 375 degrees for 30 minutes without flipping them over. This is now a weekend staple at our house.

Very good and so easy. I was pressed for time so after cooking for 10 minutes, I broiled for about 4 minutes on one side, flipped over, then about 2 to 3 on the other side. Came out golden brown. Everyone loved it. I set my oven to Lo Broil.

I recommend this dish for Christmas morning brunch. With fruit as a side dish. Easy to prepare the day ahead and will give you more time on that special morning to spend with family.

I'll never fry french toast again. This recipe is delicious. I used a cast iron pan at 425F for 30 minutes with perfect results.

I made this for a baby shower brunch and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It was very effortless to prepare. The cooking time is a bit off - I cooked at 425 for 15 min each side and at the very end, broiled for about 2 minutes to brown the top.

After reading other reviews, I removed the dish from the refrigerator about half an hour before baking and then placed it under the broiler a few minutes after baking 15 minutes to brown lighly. I also increased the oven temp to 425 degrees. My husband and I liked it.

The bake time is wrong for non-convection ovens. It has a great presentation on a buffet table and everyone loved it.

The bake time in the recipe is all wrong. It took more than a half an hour to bake the French Toast. I think it could have used a little more time even in order to get that brownish edge. By the time it was done my guests were full, but the one person who ate it said it was delicious.
