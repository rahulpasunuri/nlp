This is delicious! I grated in a little lime zest and whizzed it all in my small food processor (attachment to my handheld mixer) and it was perfection. The lime zest really brightened up the flavors. I also stuck this in the fridge for an hour before serving and I'm glad I did.

I made this sauce with a few substitutions, only because I did not have all of the ingredients. Instead of lemon juice, I used lime juice and instead of parsley, I used cilantro. You must let this sauce sit for an hour or so in order to allow all of the flavors to meld together. I served over grilled skirt steak and it was delicious!

As an old Argentine native, I would say a few things to that are absolute true about chimichurri (with all its variation): -First and foremost, chimichurri is as popular in Buenos Aires as ketchup is in the US. Therefore, it has no fancy ingredients. - Cilantro was not known at all in Argentina until now. So any chimichurri that has cilantro is not originally Argentine. -it es never prepared with oil, let alone olive oil (olive oil is very fancy) - Although the ingredients can be many, the most common are oregano and crushed red pepper. Sometimes very little onion, raw and finely chopped, very seldom garlic, and never shallots (again, something extremely fancy) -I have never eaten chimichurri prepared with lemon; always with wine vinager AND water (chimichurri usually is thick and NOT acid) -We Argentines prepare a lot of chimichurri, and keep it NOT refrigerated for a long time (the longer the better)

This recipe is flavorful, but chimichurri is much better when you substitute vinegar for lemon juice and garlic for the shallots. If you want to kick it up a notch, try adding some minced fresh jalapeno's.

Would surely add: cilantro, fresh lemon juice and substitute fresh jalepenos for the crushed red pepper. With these additions, is superb over seared rib eyes or your steak of choice.

This was ok, I didn't find anythimg particuarily fantastic about it though, to me there just wasn't enough flavor in the parsley alone, in the future I would try adding basil as well.

This has been a big hit everytime I served it.

My boyfriend and I spent 3 months in Argentina and we sampled a lot of chimichurri sauce. This recipe is pretty close to authentic, but the ratio of acid to oil is way too high. Much better with just a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice (you can always add more). I also added some cilantro, which gave it a nice touch. Don't get me wrong, the sauce is ok following the recipe instructions, but it's better with less lemon. Not to mention that if you are serving over steak with a bottle of red wine, the wine isn't going to taste as good. If you add the extra lemon, serve it over chicken and drink something that can hold up to the acidity.

I served this with grilled sirloin steaks and it was wonderful! It could not have been easier to make, and it can be paired with just about any type of grilled meats. A great summer recipe!

made with grilled shrimp and flank steak and it was a huge hit! I added basil too since I have a ton of it in my garden. Added a nice flavor.

Not only is this easy to make, it was also a great success at our annual summer party. Served with grilled skirt steak it was a flavor explosion. This went over so well that I made it again the following weekend, by request, at another party.

This is so easy to make and very flavorful! It went well with the grilled sweetbreads recipe from the same issue, and I'm already thinking of so many other things it will go with. I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.

This is wonderful!! I've used both the flat Italian parsley as well as cilantro leaves. My family likes a real "kick", so I added more chili peppers. A neighbour substituted a jalopeno pepper and it was great!!!
