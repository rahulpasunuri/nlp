WOW! I usually feel lukewarm about bananas, but this was a tasty and quick dessert. Used brandy instead of rum, and did not have any ice cream as a housemate single-handedly killed an entire tub of breyer's. Still great by itself, but use firm bananas as the cooking softens it. Looking forward to making it again with ice cream.

I thought this was a pretty simple but tasty treat. My favorite part is that I already have all the ingredients. I ended up not packing the sugar to measure it, so the sweetness was perfect for me. I would definitely make this again.

Good, fast, but nothing spectacular. If I make it again, I'd try to double the sauce, as it didn't make very much, and that's the really good part. I don't know if I'd serve it for company, as some people might not like the texture, but it's great for a quick dessert for 1 or 2 people!

So easy! You already have the ingredients, just make it - you'll love it. I didn't have the nuts on hand, but I didn't miss them. Highly recommend this recipe.

I quadrupled the ingredients and stuck to the recipe minus the nuts, served with Bryers Vanilla Bean, delicious. Used water as stated, not OJ, do not use overripe bananas. Nice dinner party dessert b/c it's not typical. Tastes just like the flaming bananas foster.

Terrific in taste, and so very easy to make. Guests were wowed. I tripled the recipe with no problem; and used orange juice as suggested rather than water. Rum and ice cream are both key elements though.

I didn't add the nuts but otherwise followed the recipe. This was very quick, easy and delicious. Serving it with ice cream is key because the two flavors and temperatures go very well together.

I didn't like this as much as most of the other reviewers. I didn't serve with ice cream or nuts, so maybe the dish needed those extras to be really good. Also, I used Frangelico instead of rum. This was OK, but nothing I'd want to make again.

Easily impress someone with this dessert. I've made it twice, once I used rum extract (just a teaspoon) in place of rum. Came out great. It is so easy and so good. Don't use too-ripe bananas. Can't wait to make it again! I think this is one to experiment with -using different flavors and ingredients as others have suggested. I will try it.

I love to bake, but I just moved into an apartment with a broken oven, so I was looking for a dessert I could make on the stove. This was delicious... I topped it with toasted walnuts and served it with Fiordilatte ice cream, which is a plain milk-flavored type ice cream. My boyfriend ate more than 1 serving worth and is already demanding that I make it again. Next time I'll try the orange juice that others suggested.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice. Once, exactly as written. It was quite good but not quite so attractive. The second time I substitued fresh pineapple cut into chunks for the banana and let everything else as written. It was heavenly. Served on ice cream with a sprinkle of toasted coconut and macadamia nuts you feel like you are sitting on a tri\opical island with the world at your feet.

If you like bananas, this is a great easy & quick dessert recipe to make and your guests will think you slaved away at it.

I made this dessert twice this weekend. It is so impressive and soooo simple I can't wait to serve it at a dinner party. I used a combo of dark and light rums and it worked perfectly. You really have to be careful not to cook the bananas too long or they will shrink away. I served it with fresh whipped cream. This is a keeper recipe!!

Rating: 4
Oh, yum yum yum! Not pretty to look at but the flavor was outstanding. Used spiced rum instead of dark. Don't think it hurt the recipe any. Had to cook the living daylights out of it to cook out the rum (tripled the recipe) for a guest who doesn't tolerate very much alcohol. The dish was still wonderful! I loved how it was not too sweet even though there were so many sweet ingredients (sugar, bananas, ice cream). The bananas, after cooking so long, tasted a little salty, though no salt was added, which was a nice compliment to the sweetness. Used chopped, toasted pecans. Can't wait to make again! So super simple and tastes like you've spent hours on it.

For time and taste, you can't beat this dessert. I made this for an impromptu dinner party with two hours notice. I thought of the dessert, which I had had in the Dominican Republic, typed in bananas and rum, and came up with this. I picked up bananas on the way back from the gym, and after 10 minutes had the exact dessert I had hoped for. Everything should be so easy!

Rating: 4
Even without adding the ice cream, this dessert is a little bit of heaven. I made a few changes and it worked very, very well. I added a little more butter (that never hurts) and a bit more rum. After toasting the nuts I added them to the butter/rum mixture. Very quick and simple dish with a big impact.

This tasted just like mashed potatoes. I don't know what I did wrong. It needed more sugar or something. It wasn't sweet in the least. It was bitter and salty and mushy.

This dessert was excellent. My cmpany loved it. My only complaint was that there is no warning about the flambe effect when the rum is added. Yes in hindsight it made sense, but at the time I forgot. A little warning would have been appreciated.

A new favorite technique for quick but elegant dessert. I bought four lovely footed glass compotes just to accomodate this. So far, have made it as written, but served over non-fat peach frozen yogurt. Last night, had it again over Edie's Caramel Praline Crunch Yogurt and topped wth lightly toasted unsweetened coconut instead of nuts.

The best kind of dessert there is - easy to make, but looks and tastes like you slaved over it. The flavors combine perfectly (my husband asked me over and over again to tell him what went into it).

Wow! This is sooooooo easy but at the same time, impressive, elegant, and delicious. The best part of is that all of the ingredients are things I always have on hand, except for the ice cream. This will become a regular "company" dessert!

Where I come from this is Known as BANANAS FOSTER. For a Simple but Showy Dessert: Fill dessert cups with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.Chill in Freezer. Make recipe as above, but reserve Rum. Serve Ice Cream. Remove Bananas from the heat source, Pour Rum over + ignite. Serve flaming at table side. Pre-chilling ice cream cups keeps this from becoming a "gloopy mess". Plantains may be used in place of bananas, especially if available from your courtyard. Apologies to Brennan's Restaurant, New Orleans, La.

This is wonderful. Definitely flame after adding rum, and substitute orange juice for the water. The one caveat I have is be sure the bananas aren't too ripe. The flavor will be great, but the texture will be too mushy.

I loved this recipe because it was so simple and quick to make. I am usually not a big fan of nutmeg, but the cinnamon, nutmeg, and rum complimented the banana wonderfully.

Rating: 4
Easy to make, a sure-fire crowd pleaser. I made sure to use ripe bananas--that way, the sweetness comes out more with less brown sugar needed (don't add too much). Don't be bashful with the dark rum--I added more than the recipe and found the flavor stupendous. TO add flair and really caramelize those bananas, I allowed the pan to flambe after deglazing with the rum--perfect. Also, for an additional touch, I served the bananas on a plate, garnished with kiwis and strawberries (guests couldn't help dip the berries in the excess rum sauce) and added diced strawberries over top the bananas--this added natural sweetness without any more sugar.

I made this dessert last night and was very pleased. Simple, quick, and delicious. Thank you to the reviewers who suggested orange juice instead of water; the citrus was a great addition. The nutmeg-cinnamon-rum combination complemented the banana nicely. Although the recipe says one serving, this was ample for two, served with vanilla ice cream. Definitely a keeper

This recipe was a big success. I served the bananas ona crepe, folded into quarters, and decorated with chopped carmelized almonds and the vanilla ice cream. I also think doubling the sauce would be a good idea.

In answer to an earlier question, this is extremely easy to double, triple etc. for more people. I made it for six - no problem. It's 4 tbsp. of brown sugar and butter. 12 tbsp. of rum. I would not bother adding the water if making it for more people (or maybe even for just one). I think it just waters down the flavours for no reason.

Try adding the rum last after the caramel thickens, and flambe, or set alight, serve to table lit. With vanilla ice cream as a side

Here is an old bartending trick. Add a tablespooon orange juice or a squeeze of lime juice. As when making a banana Daiquiri (or any fruit Daiquiri), the citrus really brings out the banana flavor.
