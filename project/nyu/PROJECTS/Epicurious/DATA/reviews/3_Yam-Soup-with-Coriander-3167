I had no plain yoghurt, so I used honey flavoured. With the garlic, it was WONDERFUL. Also did not have enough yams, so threw in a beet and a bit of squash. I added turmeric, allspice and ginger. Yum.

This seemed too simple, but it was really delicious. And I don't even usually like yams. Roasting the yams first was a great idea and I suspect makes all the difference. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin and some cayenne pepper, and it had a great flavor.

This was pretty gross. It was bland and pasty, and I can't imagine how to fix it.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving dinner, and, other than the desserts, it was far and away the guests' favorite dish. I made it the night before, so the yogurt was completely permeated with garlic and coriander.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe, and very easy to make. I have made this soup five times, and I've gotten raves each time I've served it. I found that making the yogurt mixture several hours in advance added a much better flavor to the soup overall.

I thought this soup might be a little like cream of mushroom. I was wrong. Instead it's like a big yam milkshake. I don't know if you can imagine what that tastes like. Try if it you're really curious. But be warned. It's weird.

This was a hearty, tasty soup that was really easy to make. The garlicy yogurt was the perfect touch. I didn't have any cilantro, so I used mint in the yogurt instead, and it still worked just fine. A great soup for lunch on a brisk fall day.
