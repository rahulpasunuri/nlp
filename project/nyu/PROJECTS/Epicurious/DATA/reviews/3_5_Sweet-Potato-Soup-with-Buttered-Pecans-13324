Made for a holiday party. Was a HUGE hit. Made with veggie broth to accomodate vegetarians. Like others, eliminated the extra water. Added the maple syrup. My new favorite.

We found this to be really tasty-- a great winter soup. Based on other reviews, I didn't add the extra water, and it made a very velvety texture. If you have a stick blender, you don't have to do all the transferring and getting a second pot dirty. I added Madras Curry powder for the adults, which really spiced it up nicely. For the kids, I added some cinnamon, which worked really well. With those tweaks, I would make this again.

With veggie stock instead of chicken stock, the soup is indeed bland, although definitely edible. The sour cream was a necessity! I added maple syrup and it became FABULOUS! I also added cinnamon and nutmeg, but they aren't necessary.

I loved this recipe - no dairy and good consistency. Next time I will replace the water with orange juice and add some orange zest when serving to give it a bit more zip!

I used one cup of shallots instead of the onion & leeks, just because that is what I had on hand. After the shallots, carrot and garlic cooked, I added in a generous 3/4 cup of white wine and let it simmer for a few minutes and then followed the remainder of the recipe. I thought this was delicious, albeit mild soup. Next time I make this, I may roast the sweet potatoes first +/- adding in herbs de provence

I made the recipe as stated and it was surprisingly bland. Should I make this recipe again I would make the adjustments others have made: omitting the water, adding spices to taste (cinnamon, nutmeg & chipotle) and some heavy cream.

Rating: 3
The only thing I did differently: I added some chipotle powder to the butter when I toasted the pecans.

If you follow the recipe exactly, it makes a fantastically flavourful soup that does not need the additional spices and sugars that other reviews have suggested. Fresh ground pepper and a healthy spoonful of crème fraîche is all the accompaniment this soup needs. The only variation I ever make is skipping the water and adding extra white wine; this soup also freezes and reheats wonderfully.

This recipe was fantastic. I added about 4tbs maple syrup and 1/4c heavy whipping cream in addition to a lot of freshly ground black pepper and some salt. The sweetness from the syrup and cream really made it sing. It doesn't need the last 1 1/2 cups water.

This soup gets 4 forks for the aroma alone. It was positively heavenly! I didn't have any leeks on hand, so I subbed in more onion, probably about half the amount to account for the strength. I also had some leftover red wine that I wanted to use up (a typical Rhone blend) so I used that for the wine and the water. It was understandably potent, but the flavor was wonderful. All those delicious veggies with the potent flavor of the wine--I felt like I was making an offering to Bacchus! I'm a fan of chunky soups, but I must admit that this soup is best when fully pureed.

I made as written for Christmas, relying on good reviews here - wouldn't change a thing. Had delicious bright taste of the vegetables. Sour cream made it even yummier, so did pecans - I might consider leaving out pecans but not the sour cream. It was a great addition to the stately parade of Christmas dinner, not too heavy or rich before the Roast Beast :)

This soup was amazing - my husband was mmmmming throughout dinner. This recipe made a big enough batch that we enjoyed it for lunches & froze some as well. I added nutmeg & cinnamon when cooking & then sprinkled some apple pie spice on each bowl for a little extra & presentation. Also - I am lactose intolerant so I put in some tuffuti cream cheese instead of sour cream which was good but not necessary. There's definitely some prep work invovled with all the peeling but it's not overwhelming. I highly recommend an immersion blender! Makes the pureeing SO much easier! I would definitely make this again! Especially around the holidays. It was delicious!

I've been making this soup every year for Thanksgiving since the recipe first appeared in Gourmet in November 1992. It is a huge hit, and it is an unconditionally great recipe. If you follow it as it is written, and that means including all the ingredients, you will get a delicious soup. Don't add any of the spices that people suggest--you will be creating a whole different recipe that isn't true to the intent of this one.

Rating: 3
Its a good base recipe, but I definitely had to add a lot of extra spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, chipotle chili powder). Also followed suggestion of adding a bit of brown sugar, and extra salt. The sour cream and pecans finish it off nicely. A good recipe as long as you tweak it a little.

This soup was slightly bland. I added nutmeg, a little bit of cinnamon, and a generous amount of dried, ground thyme, plus salt with a little bit of whipping cream. Use the pecans!

Rating: 1
It was only after I was done making this soup that I realized what I'd done: I'd chosen a recipe that had no herbs or spices in it. I mean, two bay leaves and salt and pepper aren't exactly earth shattering! I added some nutmeg, cinnamon, cumin, and chipotle powder, and that almost woke this soup up, but not quite. It's not an awful recipe, but there are too many other recipes out there to try for me to waste time on correcting mediocre ones. And this would be one.

I served this as a pre-dinner soup in martini glasses on Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit!

Not at all flavorful - tried adding cream and nutmeg to boost it a bit. It helped some, but would not make it again.

It was OK --- I used all chicken broth and no wine. It really needs the cream to boost the richness of the soup It is OK to eat but I probably will not make it again

I used a red potato and did not peel it for the extra fiber. I also used Simi chardonnay for the fruitiness and drank it with the meal as well. Finished it off with fresh thyme and fresh chopped basil for a more savory flavor. I sauteed the pecans with salted butter (because that is all I had) and it was fine. Although I would like to try it with the sweet butter. The creme fraiche was a must! Paired it with a slightly sweet multi-grain bread. Delicious!

Great for cold day. I added 1 teaspoon of red curry paste when cooking the veggies. Gave a nice, subtle spice. Didn't bother with the pecans. Good on its own.

Not bad as a base soup. Remember recipes are like maps, they are there to get you to where you are going, but you can get there in different ways. Try adding some Cajun spice to the pecans and butter!! All of a sudden, blandness dissapears

Sensational. Warm and earthy and good.

I adapted this recipe to crockpot style! I onitted the bayleaf and butter. I dumped everything in the pot and cokked on high for 6 hours (or low for 10) you can't use to 4 or 8 hour setting because the sweet potato will stay crunchy (trust me on this!) it freezes very well and was fantastic on a cold day.

I made this for my boyfriend's mother and she just loved it! I even made it again the next week for another party where it was a fantastic hit! Absolutely delicious. I did do the lazy way though, with a hand-held blender. So much easier, less clean-up and no fuss. Excellent!

A delicous first course for Thanksgiving. Was even better the following day. Can't wait to make it again. I can tell this will be a favorite through the fall and winter months

Rating: 4
Very tasty soup. I added 1/2 cup orange juice and a couple of tablespoons of dark brown sugar. Don't skip the pecans and crème fraîche/sour cream as these add quite a bit to the flavor. Without them, I suspect the soup might be a little bland, but when added they compliment the existing flavors very well. I would almost go so far as to say this is the perfect Fall soup.

I thought that the soup was delicious, and I think it's a good alternative to super-sweet sweet potato recipes...However, it wsan't loved by the picky eaters at the table. Whatever they thought, it wasn't enough to turn me off to this recipe.

I've been making this recipe for thanksgiving for several years now and it's always gotten a lot of praise. Several cooks have commented about it needing sweetness...I have used a mixture of sweet potatoes and yams and find that it's just perfect.

This has become a family favorite for Thanksgiving, and all winter long, since it freezes well. The creme fraiche really makes this soup - its wonderful flavor really makes it my first choice over the sour cream. This really is a phenomenal soup!

Delicious and warming to the soul, not too sweet or heavy...works well even with canned sweet potatoes (packed without syrup)

Be prepared to do a lot of chopping for this recipe! Following the advice of some other reviewers, I added 1/2 cup of orange juice and a pinch of nutmeg. To increase the sweetness a little, I also added about about an 1/8 tspn. of brown suger. Just before serving I dropped a few small dollops of sour cream into each bowl. The sour cream went really well with the flavor of the soup and the white color looked really pretty against the bright orange. I served it with french bread. Overall, it was wonderful and I will make it again!

Thanks to the cooks/reviewers before me. Your ideas of adding orange juice and nutmeg made it a standout. I skipped the buttered pecans and did the creme fraiche. It was fantastic. Used it as a starter for an elegant dinner with the Crown Roast of Pork and Cider Gray -- awesome. The color is glorious. It kept well for days and my family was pleased over and over again.
