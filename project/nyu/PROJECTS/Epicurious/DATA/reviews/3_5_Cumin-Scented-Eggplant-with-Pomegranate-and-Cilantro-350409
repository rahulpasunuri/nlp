I loved the exotic spiciness of the dish. Taking a cue from the reviewer who found it overwhelmed the eggplant, I tried the recipe with steamed Brussels sprouts.Wow! and great colors, besides. Next up will be cauliflower.

Liked it but no more than that. It's good but I usually like better my epicurious recipies!

I was amazed at how delicious this recipe is, and so different from other dishes I prepare. I can't imagine leaving out the pomegranate molasses, that to me is what makes the dish. It doesn't take much, but just a drizzle of tangy sweet sour with the rich, warmth of creamy eggplant and spicy cayenne/cumin is quite extraordinary. I prefer to avoid raw garlic so the only thing I did differently with this recipe was to skip the raw garlic at the end. Instead, I roasted whole cloves and spread the roasted garlic on fresh flatbread, then topped with the eggplant slices and the drizzle of pomegranate plus fresh cilantro. I will definitely make this again. I am curious how it holds up if it's made in advance, because it would be great to serve at a party.

Delicious! It was such an tasty recipe to prepare - made easier by the fact it can be done ahead. The flavors were wonderful and addictive. I added a little more cayenne and chose to roast the garlic with the eggplant as suggested by one reviewer. The sweet, hot combo is so good. I plan to make it as an appetizer by cubing the eggplant and serving with long toasted crostini for a party tonight.

I liked this a lot, but there weren't any big surprises in it. I am glad to say that the pomegranate molasses did not over power the cumin, which was delicious. Anyway, I may make this again, but its a lot of effort for a dish that is good but not exceptional

When I made this it came out far too spicy for my tastes, although my boyfriend did really enjoy it and said it wasn't too spicy. I didn't have any pomegranate molasses and so left that out, which may be why the cumin and cayenne pepper flavors reached the point of being overwhelming. I think I would have preferred this with more subtle flavors. In short, it just didn't work for me.

Tasty and easy way to enjoy eggplant. I made a simplified version, following the suggestions of the previous reviewer. I sliced the eggplant (1/4 inch), brushed with oil, sprinkled with garlic salt, cumin, cayenne, and baked for 15-20 minutes. Didn't have any pomegranate seeds, so had to do without those. I mixed pomegranate molasses with yogurt, put a dollop on each slice, and sprinkled with cilantro.

The flavors of the pomegranate seeds and cilantro are perfect. I found this recipe a little late, and had to really modify so it could be ready in about 1/2 hour. With that, I wouldn't change what I did, and will store this recipe in my "Everyday File" (which doesn't exist yet, but should!) Modifications: slice eggplant brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, cumin/cayenne. Bake till soft, and some parts golden. Spread all or some slices with crushed garlic (from jar) bake a few min. Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with pomegranate seeds, and chopped cilantro. Pretend that the pomegranate juice in your fridge, is the pomegranate molasses that is called for in recipe; splash a little on top and serve:)

We loved this. Yes, cooked eggplant isn't the most attractive, and the recipe has a number of steps, but the flavors are worth it.

This dish surprised me - in a really good way. It was a series of steps to make, but it turned out to be worth it. The flavors are really different, but excellent together.

Flavor was amazing - a little bit sweet, a little bit sour, a little bit spicy - really fantastic. I wasn't sure if I loved it at first, but then I realized I kept going back for a little bit more, and a little bit more - like the recipe says, it's addictive. I have to say, I couldn't taste the eggplant at all, but then again, I guess you can't really taste the eggplant in a lot of eggplant dishes. I only cook casually, so this is not an authoritative review - and I would definitely make it again, not only because it was delicious but also because I would want to see if it was different the second time around. Also, I personally bought pomegranate molasses but I think you could probably skip it.
