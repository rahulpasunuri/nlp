Not being a sweet cornbread lover, I think this one is a great basic cornbread. I made it to go with a pot of chili. The only change I made was to omit the sage and add a couple of spoonfuls of the solids of poblano pepper I had left from making hot sauce (recipe on this site)and a half a cup or so of grated cheddar cheese (helps with the moistness. In the future when I'm all out of those solids will likely add some diced hot pepper (jalapeno, poblano etc.)

I made this recipe exactly how stated. Turned out a little dry as described in the review....however...It was perfect for my cornbread stuffing as the corn bread needed to be completely dry anyway. Will definitely use this again for stuffing.

This is the most bland tasteless cornbread I have ever made. I made a test batch to see if it was good enough to serve for Thanksgiving- needless to say that batch will NOT be served at my table. yuck!

This is an okay recipe for making stuffing or dressing, only. It is unpalatably bland and dry for serving in any other form. There are lots of other buttermilk corn bread recipes on this site that I would use before this one.

This recipe is good for eating if you do not like sweet corn bread. It tastes nice with a jalepeno jelly for added sweetness. I did not use the sage. Since I did not have unsalted butter, I decreased salt to a 1/4 tsp.

I should have stated in my review below that I did not add the sage, since I was making it to serve with black bean soup. The addition of sage would make it ideal for stuffing, but it was great plain for eating.

This is the way cornbread should taste, in my humble opinion. The only thing I changed was to add 1T of sugar. It was sturdy but not dry, formed a nice crust with soft crumb, and the counterpoint between the subtle sourness of the buttermilk and the sweetness of the corn was lovely. I ate it plain but I also went over the top and ate it with butter and honey. To die for! Next time I might put in a handful of corn kernals to give it a different look but that's not necessary.

This turned out well, but I took the advice of others and added moisture and a tad bit of sweetness. Added: 3 tbsp sugar. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1 cup non-fat yogurt and 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream. I am convinced that the extra volume of liquid (1/4 cup more than recipe calls for) added sufficient moisture without causing the bread to be heavy or greasy. I also used equal amounts of cornmeal and flour because I like a crunchier texture. Stealing from another Epicurious recipe, I added to the dry ingredients 1/4 cup frozen cranberries that I had chopped in a small food processor. Instead of sage, I used 1 teaspoon toasted fennel seeds (ground up with mortar and pestle). The flavor does not overpower the bread, but adds to it a unique taste.

For all of the reviewer who say that this is good for stuffing, I agree. However corn bread is usually made to be eaten, not as an ingredient in something else, hence the 2 forks. In my opinion it's ONLY good for making stuffing. It is very dry and bland; I would never serve this to guests.

very very moist. I don't have an ovenproof skillet so I made this in corningware and it did just fine.

Just ridiculously good!!! Made it in a cast iron pan on the grill(added 1 TBL oil and butter to pan. Put batter into a hot pan.) When finished cooking (12mins), added 4 TBL room temp butter and 1/4 cup honey. Been looking for a good corn bread recipe and have finally found it! Mmmmmm!

Finally, a cornbread recipe that does not have a truck load of sugar! No one in my clan likes sweet cornbread. I did add a splash more buttermilk. Loved it!

The four forks I gave were given because this cornbread worked great as suggested in the 'Sage Stuffing' recipe on this site {Gormet Nov. 2002, orig. nov. 1975}. I don't know how good the cornbread would have tasted to eat on its own, but it worked perfectly in this stuffing, the firm dry texture worked well in the recipe. This sage stuffing is great!! My family flipped out over it and it is part of my regualar thanksiving menue now!!

This cornbread is only good as a base for cornbread recipes like the Cornbread Dressing with Bacon & Pecans. The dry, crumbly texture is perfect for that, but would be really annoying plain.

While I think this cornbread is probably fine for stuffing, it is too dry and lacks sweetness so it is not one of the tastier cornbreads that I have made. I would only make it again for the stuffing recipe.

Perfect for crumbling and adding to stuffing! I've had better cornbread for straightforward eating, and I probably wouldn't make this recipe for a side dish alone. It's dry and not very sweet. For my purpose of adding to a Sage Corn Bread Stuffing for thanksgiving, it was the best. I made exactly as outlined, but put in a little less sage for my picky non-herb liking audience. I didn't miss a thing though. I'll be keeping this recipe around for future stuffing mixes. Very easy. Very fast.

Easy and perfect to create the topping for Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Sage Corn Bread Crust, an outstanding tenderloin recipe found on epicurious!

Good, easy cornbread recipe for serving w/ chili. I added 2 Tbsp of sugar per other reviews, and was a little generous on the buttermilk (1-2 extra Tbsp), and did not find the cornbread to be overly dry, or too sweet.

I used this recipe with some added summer savory as the basis for my stuffing for the the Thanksgiving Turkey and it turned out perfectly, no sweetness just pure savory. Not only would I make it again I will make it again.

I used this recipe to make the sage stuffing featured by Ted Allen for Thanksgiving this year. It was perfect for that because the recipe is dry. I wouldn't use it to along with soups though, it is dry and not sweet at all. Perfect for making bread crumbs for stuffing though.

This corn bread is listed as an ingredient for the Sage Stuffing recipe (also on this site) that I am making for Thanksgiving. Decided to taste it after reading other reviews--the sage is a delicious addition and the texture is coarse, but not heavy. It should not be confused with a sweet cornbread or even thought of as a complement to chili. It might be nice on its own with smoked turkey slices, but as an element in the stuffing it is just right.

As the intro states, the corn bread is dry. It was too dry for my liking. I wouldn't make it again.

This is not sweet, and it's only slightly cakey. It's not extremely "Southern" or extremely "Yankee" -- so it shouldn't offend anyone too much.

This cornbread is only okay. There was nothing not to like about it, it just doesn't have much flavor, except for the sage. Maybe increase the amount of cornmeal, and lessen the flour?

Best corn bread we've ever made. We don't like it sweet, and it wasn't at all dry. Took only 17 minutes. Used the optional sage, as we have lots in the garden. Great with chicken.

I have made a lot of cornbread in my day, and this one was the biggest hit yet. My BBQ friends finished every square. Since I like the texture of cornmeal, I used equal parts of flour and meal. I made sure to add an extra splash of buttermilk as cornmeal does add an element of dryness. I also put in 1/3 cup of sugar because, hey, who doesn't like a little sweetness in their cornbread? Next time I'm going to double the recipe!

It was pretty good. I've had better, but this one isn't bad at all, and would be excellent if you needed to crumble it (as the recipe says to do--not sure why), but it holds together well enough if you choose not to :) Per other reviews, I added 1 Tb sugar (still wasn't sweet, which is fine by me) and another 1/2 c buttermilk.

I thought this was a great recipe to serve with butter and honey. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 2T. sugar. It still was not sweet and that's the way we like it. It passed muster with my friend from Tennessee so it must be good!

A very good cornbread. I didn't find it dry; it was quite fluffy and tasty. I added a TBS of sugar for some slight sweetness.

I followed Sarah's tips and added some sugar and an extra splash of buttermilk. The recipe says this is "less moist" than others--I was expecting to have to have a glass of milk on standby to wash it down. But it was quite moist and the buttermilk really does give it a great taste. Loved it.

I added almost 1/4 c. of sugar and some extra buttermilk to the batter. It is a good cornbread and will make it again!

This was a simple recipe with a down home taste. Maybe it was the extra shaking of the buttermilk that did it. Sage is optional but please use it. It gives the corn bread an extra kick. This bread was part of my Easter dinner. It went extremely well with the glazed ham, macaroni and cheese, green beans and Aunt Rose's pound cake.
