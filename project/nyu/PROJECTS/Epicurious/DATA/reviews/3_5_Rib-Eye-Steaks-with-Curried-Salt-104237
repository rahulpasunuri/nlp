yummy in its simplicity. Did use less salt and whisked in a tiny bit of Dijon when deglazing. Hubby loved it.

DELICIOUS! An amazingly simple recipe that yields great results. I just loved it. I cut out about a quarter teaspoon of salt, and I think it was fine w/o it I also didn't make the sauce, and I don't think I missed it at all. I had this with a good cold amber beer -- excellent! A keeper!

This is a great and easy recipe. Feels like I had this recipe before in a restaurant. My husband loved this too. Highly recommend!!

I always struggle to find good recipes that can accomodate a family with one member allergic to all dairy products as well as peanuts and another allergic to onions and garlic. This one required no modifications and still was loaded with flavor. I will use it often!

These were great steaks, esp. with the roast parsnips on the side. I made them months ago, and my boyfriend still asks after the "sweet fries." The only problem was that after cooking these steaks in my apartment, the place smelled like curry for days. I mean days. I will make this again, but not until I get a bigger place!

I love to eat steak, and this made me love it even more. The rub adds so much flavor. If you're a fan of curry, you should definitely try this.
