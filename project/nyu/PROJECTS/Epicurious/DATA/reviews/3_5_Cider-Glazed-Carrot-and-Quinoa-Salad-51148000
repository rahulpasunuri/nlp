I made this for a dinner party - it was delicious and colorful, and it got rave reviews. Apple cider wasn't available at my grocery store, so I made it with apple juice, and I doubt it made any difference at all. I did overcook the quinoa a little bit (I was closer to the 15 min mark), so it ended up a little mushier than I would have liked - I'd recommend starting to taste test at 10 minutes and keeping an eye on it. I'll definitely make this again.

Made this for the first time tonight and it was perfect. It will be in my regular rotation now. The nice thing is that I can imagine it with so many other veggies: green beans, peas, cucumber, cilantro. All so yummy. And the quinoa came out just right (I followed the instructions exactly). So so sooo soo so yummy and easy. I had all the ingredients without even having to leave the house!
