Not a review - a question. Why pour the filling through a strainer if it's set? Is this like a spaghetti strainer and not a sieve? If so, what is it straining out?

Have made twice (chilling crust right now). Fabulous except crust too dry upon transferring to pan. Will try other suggestion of less flour. Very very delicious. Will probably repeat throughout summer.

For those of you who can't find creme fraiche, you should know that you can make it overnight (in the same time it would take to strain sour cream). Just combing 1 c whipping cream and ~2 TBSP buttermilk in a glass jar, cover loosely, and leave in the cupboard for 12 hours, stirring about halfway through. Mine is usually thick enough after 12 hours, but you might have to leave it up to 24 hours. Store in the refrigerator, where it will thicken up a bit as well. I find this is much better than the store-bought variety.

This was a very good dessert, although very rich and creamy. I used meyer lemons and felt that it wasn't lemony enough, so I added the juice of a small lemon to the creme fraiche mix. My lemon custard thickened way before the thermometer reached 180 degrees, maybe it was because I used a porcelain double boiler instead of a metal bowl. I didn't have time to bake a crust so I made a graham cracker crust in which I added sea salt -I was very happy with this substitution. I loved the marbled effect. I used a berry compote, but felt that the dessert didn't need it. I omitted serving with compote when eating leftovers.

This dessert is delicious, but the dough for the crust was way too heavy and crumbly. Next time I will reduce the amount of flour in the crust.

Delicious! Great lemon flavor and a nice light texture. Will definitely be making this again.

Just made this and it is a hit. It has gotten rave reviews inspite of being deceptively rich. Made according to the recipe, except that I used a cup of cream fraiche so I wouldn't have any left over and reduced tthe heavy cream accordingly. It is light and fluffy and tart. It also freezes well.

This is a great spring dessert. Its very light and so tasty. It was the perfect end to a heavy burger and sausage BBQ dinner. The lemon and the rhubarb go incredibly well together.

This is my new favorite dessert to serve! It's very refreshing and tasty after a heavy meal like cheese fondue. I skipped the rhubarb compote, due to time. It's probably good, but I don't think it's necessary.

Everyone loved when I made this! I got the best dessert award... instead of the compote I used blueberries in sugar and it was a great substitution

I made this tart for Easter lunch and everyone enjoyed it. The flavor was delicious. Very lemony. For some reason, it never firmed up enough. I might add some gelatin to the mix next time. Will definitely experiment. Also, my grocery store didn't have creme fraiche so I used sour cream that I drained in cheesecloth overnight.

Delicious and elegant. A taste of springtime. The rhubarb really sets off the richness of the lemon filling. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and it worked out just fine.

I've made this dessert twice, and both times it was a huge hit. Finally, a dessert with not only lemon flavor, but tartness as well! It's delicious with blueberry compote if you can't find rhubarb, and feel free to substitute sour cream for the creme fraiche- it works fine.

This dish is excellent. There is enough dough for an 11 inch pan. Instead of creme fraiche I used cream cheese and added extra cream to get the right consistency. Also used extra large eggs, and had plenty of filling for the larger pan. Everyone oohed and aahed as they ate!

I enjoyed this dish today at a party that featured seven desserts. It was far and away the most delicious and memorable dessert and I came home and searched for the recipe immediately. It was tangy and luscious. I will definitely make it myself soon. It makes a very attractive party dish.

I have made this several times for guests, always to rave reviews. I substitute a cardamom-ginger brown sugar crust, and I find it accents the flavors very nicely. An elegant pie for lemon lovers, and decadent without being over-heavy.

Excellent filling- the flavor of the crust was nice, but I think next time I will try a shortbread crust. My grocery store was out of rhubarb on the day I needed it, so I made a blueberry compote instead, and it was delicious! I made this for a birthday, and the whole family raved about it!

Very good. I cheated and used a jar of lemon curd, but it was still delicious. Light but satisfying.

Excellent, crust and lemon curd were pefect. The lemon peel and juice sent your taste buds to tart and sweet place. The crust slid off the tart pan. It made you fell like you were sitting on cloud on a perfect spring day.
