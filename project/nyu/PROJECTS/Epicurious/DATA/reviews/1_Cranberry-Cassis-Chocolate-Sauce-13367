I was really looking forward to tasting this recipe which sounded mouthwatering. However, it was disappointing - the combination of cranberries and chocolate was peculiar and the result rather bitter, leaving a sour taste in the mouth. In future I'll stick with either cranberry sauce or chocolate sauce!
