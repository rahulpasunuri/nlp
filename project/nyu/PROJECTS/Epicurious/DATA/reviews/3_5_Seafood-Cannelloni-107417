This was a LOT of prep work, but it was delicious! I forgot to add the heavy cream to the filling, and it was still good, so for those who want to reduce the guilt, that's one way. People raved about it being one of the greatest things they'd ever eaten. And they did think refer to them as crepes instead of cannelloni.

This recipe looks great! Just a tip for canneloni lovers. Try using fresh pasta sheets sold in the refrigerated section of your produce department. They are larger than wonton wrappers, no pre cooking, easy to use and bake up nice and tender. Just add your filling and roll.

Although time consuming, this was well worth the effort. I used my hand-blender to puree the sauce without mishap. I also used Catelli Express Oven-ready Cannoelloni. This significantly decreased the prep-time. I fill the cannelloni using a Zip-loc bag with a small hole cut in one corner; like a piping bag. My husband and I both agreed that this recipe is a keeper!

I made the recipe as written, except I substituted lobster buillion for the seafood glaze, as indicated by other reviewers, and I used half and half instead of heavy cream in an effort to cut the fat. I was a little afraid of making this on a weeknight after reading about the recipe being horribly involved, but though it did take maybe 3 hours from start to finish, it was easy. That said, it seemed that the dish lacked depth of flavor -- if I make it again, I'll add much more vegetables and garlic to the sauce; use the heavy cream the recipe calls for and add a lot of parmesan cheese.One more thing: some of the reviews compared the lasagne noodles to a crepe in this dish. I did not find this to be true at all. The lasagne noodles tasted like, well, lasagne noodles.

Made almost exactly as described except no glaze - was wonderful. Will make for New Year's Eve party. No boil lasagne did taste like crepes. A nice idea for the future.

I did not grind the shells, nor did I use heavy cream. I used fresh whole wheat lasagne noodles. The seafood tightened up and was chewy. Although I didn't follow the recipe as written, I would not attempt it again even as written. Waste of good seafood :)

Wow. Was I disappointed with this dish. While the sauce smelled and tasted great the end product was bland. Won't bother trying to jazz this up, too much work. There are other labor intensive recipes out there that actually produce worthwhile results.

This is simply fabulous. I doubled the recipe and served to a party of 10. The recipe was easy to follow it was just extremely time consuming. My husband and I worked several hours side by side. My guests couldn't say enough about how wonderful the cannelloni was. I added a lb of lobster, and better than bullion lobster base (instead of seafood glaze). Not sure if the lobster was worth it as it was pureed in the end. I too would have enjoyed extra sauce to serve with it.

I made this dish yesterday for a Christmas Luncheon and Cookie Exchange. Yes it was labor intense, but the results were well worth the time and effort. I omitted the seafood glaze, and did not use the cognac, and I don't think it made a difference in the flavor. I agree with another reviewer, use caution when blending the sauce. Mine exploded, and had I not had a towel over it, I would of been burned. Next time I will definately cool before blending.

While it was good, I can't say it was worth the effort and the clean up afterwards. Also, when it says to be careful when blending hot liquids - BE CAREFUL. Start with the lowest setting on your blender as the stock is quick to shoot to the top (and in my case, shoot out the top) because the base is so thin. Only suffered a minor burn on the wrist!

I have a question, not a review. Could this be assembled as a lasagna? Thanks

This recipe truly deserves all four forks. The shrimp stock/sauce is amazingly flavorful. I just wish it was less time intensive so that I'd make it more frequently. I will probably try to morph this into a kind of seafood pasta soup or unbaked dish in which I make the broth/sauce as it is written, but add seafood and maybe homemade noodles to it (rather than making the mousse, rolling tbe canneloni, and baking it).

This dish was well worth the time it took to make it. Guests who don't usually take second helpings couldn't resist having more of it, and they took the recipe home with them too. I added a little minced garlic to the veggies as they cooked, and I also substituted Better Than Bouillon Lobster Base for the seafood glaze. Made it ahead and put it in the oven when my guests arrived so that it would be ready to serve 45 minutes later. A crusty baguette and a salad, and we had a great meal. I'll definitely make this again.

Ummm.... Changed some things. made enough for 17 people. Used 2.5 lbs shrimp and 2 whole 1.25 lb lobsters left out the chives. served as pasta course with christmas eve dinner. WOW! Intensive long preparation but if you are looking for a meal to impress, this is it.

Just a question. Does anyone know how far in advance this dish can be prepared? Do you feel it would suffer by being assembled the night before, to be served at lunch the following day?

I haven't tried this dish, I just wanted to let you know that chives are mentioned in the "Make Seafood Filling" section "....Transfer mousse to a large bowl and stir in shrimp and scallop pieces and chives." It can be a abit misleading because it's listed at the end of the ingredients list so you would expect it to most likely be used later in the recipe. Hope that helped!

Decent basic recipe that just needs a few touches. Afer adding garlic with the vegetables in the stock stage and adding some parmesean cheese to the filling the taste seemed to be more what I was expecting. Also added a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce. You might want to try to make more than the recommended amount of sauce, I would have liked some on the side to serve with the dish.

Fantastic dinner party fare especially since it can be made ahead. One small change I made which I think enhances this dish. Pour enough of the sauce over the cannelloni to cover but reserve some of the sauce. Just before serving, heat it in a saucepan and pass at the table. Delicious!

I was very disappointed in this dish. It was good, but nowhere near "special occasion", and not worth the time involved. The sauce was similar to the one from "salmon with truffles and shrimp and cream sauce", but while that one was to die for, this one was o.k. I was hoping to wow my guests, but aggreed with their comments of "well, it's good..."

We have some very good friends who love to cook, bake and eat good food just like us. We alternate the cooking duties: our house, their house and the bar is raised each and every time so the food always has to be outstanding. Although time consuming, this dish is worth all the effort. Our friends recognized the work it took and their oohs and ahhs were worth very second. The sauce alone is to die for and I think that in the future I might make the sauce and toss with some pasta, shrimp and scallops - DELICIOUS !

I learned a lot making this recipe. I usually boil my shrimp shells, but running the stock through the blender and strainer gave it a glorious color and made a huge impact on the flavor. I had forgotten the wine at the store... rats ... so I just used water for the stock. I also used evaporated goats milk for the cream because of allergies and it all turned out great. Lots of fun.

Prepared a double recipe as a first/pasta course for a dinner party of 8 hearty eaters a couple of months ago. It was absolutely fantastic. The no-boil lasagne turns out very much like a delicate crepe. Tonight I'm hosting another dinner party for 9 - and will use this again as a pasta/first course. It's delicious and one that will be added to my reportoise for many years.

I made this dish for my husband. He loved it, i was quite surprised out of all the work involved that it didn't really appeal to me, i think it was the no-boil lasagne, i felt it didnt taste like pasta. I actually made the sauce again and made it with shrimp and scallops and threw in diced carrots to give it a little color and this was delicious! great seafood sauce!!!!!

This recipe is really great! Although, I didn't make the mousse and fill it into pasta because of a time constraint. What I did was make the sauce just like the recipe and used it as a sauce over fresh linguine. I sauteed shrimp, scallops and crawtails in wine and butter and then added to the sauce. Excellent!!

I made this for our New Year's dinner and was very happy with the results. It took quite a while but was well worth the effort. Very rich since I used every bit of fat the recipe called for; it was a special occasion, after all.

This was a wonderful dinner....a bit time consuming, but reasonable. I subbed low fat milk and half and half for the cream. Much lighter. Also champagne was a good accompaniment.

We all loved it and nick-named it "cardiac cannelloni" because it is SO rich! Allow yourself enough time to prepare this - I did the sauce, noodles and assembling and my husband did the filling, which worked out fine. It's a lot to do by yourself. Think "special occasion."

this is outstanding. It was easy to prepare. The ingredients were easy to find even here in the Midwest. I made it using homemade pasta which really made the dinner memorable. It was well received by all.

great recipe. I added crab and some parmesan cheese. A bottle of white bordeaux added to the meal!

Fabulous flavor! ...it took forever to make. It should be a simple recipe, but is VERY time consuming. It has a few steps - the sauce, filling, noodles, assemble, then bake. The steps (except boiling the noodles) need to be done in order. Anyway, the results are worth the effort. The only substitution I made was to use fat-free half and half for the cream and I forgot the chives but won't next time.

We found this dish to be wonderful - full of flavor and very rich. Could not locate the 'seafood glaze' even at one of the higher end gourmet shops & the butcher had never heard of such a thing. Flavor was still wonderful without it. Only issue that I would try to combat on the next try was that after cooking the moisture from the seafood produced some water in the bottom of the pan making the sauce a little runny & I would have preferred it to stay thick. Others in my party didn't care.
