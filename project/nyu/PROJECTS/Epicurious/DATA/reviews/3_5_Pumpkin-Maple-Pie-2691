Really good pie! I doubled the recipe overall for two pies, but I replaced 1/2 cup of the total maple syrup with brown sugar, and reduced the cream by half a cup, and tripled the spices (personal preference here) and replace the natural maple flavoring with a glug of Jack Daniels. Perfect volume for two pies, much better set up texture at the recommended baking time, and very yummy.

I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving since running across it in the BA magazine years ago. Everyone I've made it for loves it. I have never used the natural maple flavor and don't miss it. Yes, it takes forever to cook and I also put foil on the crust for a bit so it doesn't burn. But the pie finally does firm up enough to take out of the oven and is perfectly moist and delicious.

Pretty good. The maple syrup adds flavor and enough sweetness without being overwhelming. Would recommend.

Not a great pie. Our guests referred to this pie as having an "earthy" flavor. I even used 100% Maine maple syrup. I was a bit sad. I think I will stick to the Libby's Pumpkin Pie recipe for future Thanksgiving meals. I followed all the directions too.

Excellent, made this for Thanksgiving to rave rewiews. I did use a regular pastry crust rather than making the buttermilk, as a time-saver.

I'm kind of disappointed in this recipe. The texture of the pie is WAY too soft. It's possible I didn't bake it long enough (I did leave it in about 55 min) but the edges were starting to crack so I figured it had to be done. Also didn't use maple extract, as I was using the stronger-tasting B-grade maple syrup, and it ended up not tasting strongly of maple OR pumpkin. I will try this again, though, as I think it has promise, and leave out an egg, hopefully to firm up the filling, and make some other changes too. I used the crust from the Great Pumpkin Pie recipe and it turned out perfect.

This is a "4-fork" recipe with the following changes: 1) double all the spices; 2) add 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves; 3) add 2 tablespoons firmly packed golden brown sugar; and 4) substitute 1/2 tablespoon arrowroot powder for the flour. Arrowroot powder is a superior thickener for pies because unlike flour and cornstarch, it doesn't taste chalky or floury if undercooked. Like cornstarch, arrowroot cooks up clear making it a better choice for thickening fruit pies I didn't have any "natural maple flavor" but I did use maple syrup as specified, and I don't think the pie suffered at all. And, I used Epicurious' standard pastry dough recipe (type "pastry dough" in search box) which is the best recipe for pie crust, in my opinion.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I love the pumpkin-maple combination. I could eat the whole pie in one sitting (but won't). I kept the foil on the crust edges for about 1/2 hour then removed it. It came out perfect. I will be making this one again.

This was my first attempt at pumpkin pie. The texture was great, but I thought it could use more "pumpkin" flavor. I will try using fresh pumpkin next time.

This is a wonderful recipe. I didnt use the maple extract but I used grade b maple syrup which has a stronger flavor than grade a. I also substituted evaporated milk for the cream. Next time I think I will add 1/4 tsp of cloves. Great texture.

I have never baked a pumpkin pie before, but I was looking for a pumpkin pie recipe 2 days before thanksgiving. It turned out really really good and my friends loved it. They couldn't believe I made it from scratch. I also put some chopped pecans on top and it looked and tasted excellent.

I make this pie almost every Thanksgiving. It always gets rave reviews.

This pumpkin pie is delicious! The filling is richer than the average pumpkin pie and the maple adds a really great flavor. I will definitely make it again. But I cooked the pie 1 hr 10min before it was done.

I made this recipe AFTER reading everyone's reviews and noting any changes that were made. I decided to try substituting condensed milk for the whipped cream in the pie filling. Too sweet? Mine was the only pie that was finished at my family gathering of 35 people -- even the children ate it.

As a novice pie maker, I didn't realize the chilling was essential...the filling was quite mushy before that. The filling is not as solid as a regular pumpkin pie. It's ok but I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

This is similar to the one I have made for years. I add walnuts to the top. I also always use fresh pumpkin, which makes it taste much better than can. My family is spoiled and does not like any other kind.

I have been making this pie since it appear in 1991... but in 1993 I used fresh pumpkins instead of the canned and it made a remarkable difference. So each year I steam and puree the pumpkin and make extra pies because they go so quickly.

Not difficult to make. Excellent.

Delicious combination of maple and pumpkin. The whipping cream makes the filling kind of rich, you could probably substitue something lighter like evaporated milk. BTW, boiling syrup, maple flour, Mel, what recipe were YOU using??? ;)

This was a bit of trouble, with the boiling of the syrup, etc., but the maple flavor was distinct and the pie was well-received. Many maple recipes do not have a distinct maple flavor but this one was more intense. The one problem I found was with the ingredient "maple flour" What is maple flour? I couldn't find it anywhere, even though I live in L.A., where you can find most ingredients for any cuisine. I used flour instead.
