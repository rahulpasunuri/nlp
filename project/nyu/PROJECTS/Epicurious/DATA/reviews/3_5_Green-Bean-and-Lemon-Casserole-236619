I made this for Christmas Dinner 2012, and received rave reviews. The hint of lemon was perfect against the Prime Rib and Roast Potatoes. I would definitely make it again.

Yummy! Very flavorful, and very lemony.

this is a great side to serve for a holiday meal, especially where many of the other dishes are rich. it provides a nice light and healthy counterpoint that is still delicious. my guests raved about it when I served it for christmas eve dinner.

Delightful recipe, my 4 year old grandson, who eats no green, gobbled these up on Thanksgiving.

The dish had nice flavor. I added toasted pine nuts, which I would do again in the future if making this recipe. I was distracted noodling around with the lemon and over cooked the beans- no one's fault but my own!

I loved everything about this dish-- great flavor, simple, easy to make. It was the perfect side for our Christmas dinner with rib roast and roast potatoes. I par- boiled the beans ahead of time, ran them under cold water and set them aside until the last minute and it worked well. This is my new favorite green bean dish and will be our staple side for Christmas Day.

I have never given 2 forks before but this recipe just didn't work for me or my guests. Made this for a very traditional English Christmas feast. Everything was great except these green beans. The lemon was overwhelming, the lemon flesh unattractive and the dish completely lacked any subtlety. If you are looking for a green bean recipe for a special occassion, this is not it.

I made this for Christmas dinner. I used yellow beans and lime, but otherwise used the quantities directed. It was delicious, and really went well with the other richer dishes I as serving. Everyone enjoyed it.
