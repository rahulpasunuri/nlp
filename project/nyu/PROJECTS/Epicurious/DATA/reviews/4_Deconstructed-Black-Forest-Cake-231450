I used the cake portion of the recipe as a part of a traditional, two layer black forest cake...It was AMAZING! Mind you, I figured out last minute that I didn't actually have any cocoa powder left at home so I used hot chocolate mix instead and reduced the sugar by 1/3. Perhaps this is the difference between it having been rich, and other reviewers complaints that it was somewhat bland. I topped it with my own mascarpone whipped cream icing (mascarpone, whipped cream with sugar, vanilla, lemon zest and caramel tequila!) and used cherry pie filling. Everyone loved it!

This is a great presentation, but overall a bit too much chocolate, even for the chocolate lover in our dinner club. Personally, I did not care for the cake at all; a bit too cloying. Similar to other reviews, my guests did not like the kirsch either.

This is really something special. Quite a lot of preparation, but all of it fun and easy to do ahead.I doubled the chocolate in the custards. Couldn't get frozen cherries so used fresh cherries, which gave a fantastic flavour. My guests didn't like the kirsch much - the subtle flavour was overpowered by the dessert's sweetness and all you got was the alcohol. I'll try cherry brandy next time.

I used this cake recipe for a traditional 2-layered round Black Forest cake. What a disappointment! Way too dense and not very tasty--guests were visibly underwhelmed. Betty Crocker's Best Chocolate Cake recipe was an improvement the next time around--an actual cake texture that compliments the cream and cherries. The deconstruction aspect sounds trendy, but I like having contrasting elements in one slice.

I made this for a dinner party and it was by far the most successful dessert I have ever made. I found square plates that were divided into four sections so I served the four components in those and the cherry brandy (couldn't locate Kirsch) on the side. It was beautiful, fun, and tasted great!

As per an earlier suggestion, made the cake in muffin tins - I think made for nicer presentation. Doubled chocolate in fudge pots - will definitely do again. Made in 1 large bowl and served in small mound on plate. Could not get frozen cherries, so used cherry pie filling and added cherry brandy. Instead of kirsch, served cherry brandy. Great recipe that can be prepared in advance. Really fun to serve and eat.

I took this idea and made my own version of it, since I was only making it for my husband and me for Valentine's day. I made a flourless chocolate cake and chocolate pots du creme, along with the cherries and whipped cream. It looks amazing and tasted unbelieveably good. Plus, it's fun to eat, with little taste of everything. There was a bit of work upfront, but not really that much. I'll definitely do this again for a larger group sometime. Yum yum!

Wonderful presentation, excellent food. Served some friends that love to cook and they were very impressed. I used bigger ramikins, so remember to use the correct size. Loved this and will definetely make it again.

This was a fabulous cake that I made for an all-girls party. Or women, really. I unfortunately have gotten the reputation of being the dessert expert after making the red, white and blue cheesecake for my friend who moved to Texas. I put a giant star on the top and called it "The Lone Star Cake." This is my second try and this dessert has sealed the deal. I had a blast making it, but the Kirsch was horrible - as everyone else has mentioned. Wonderful presentation and the entire thing is done ahead of time. A little labor intensive.

The best thing about this recipe was the cheeries, which were wonderful. However, the cake wasn't dark and rich enough. The custard was good but not "to die for." It is impressive being served, and the guests seemed to enjoy it, but for the time and trouble it took to make it all, I would have preferred a rich, dark chocolate cake topped with cherries and whipped cream flavored with the liquour.

This was delicious even though I didn't serve it w/brandy. To make serving easier, I baked the cake in a 10" round and added roughly 10 min to the bake time - it came out very moist and tasty. I don't like time consuming desserts and this one was very time consuming - so next time I think I'll just make the cake and frost it.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. It was just so much fun to eat and all the components were truly delicious even on their own.

Quite a bit of work, but well worth it in the end. The Kirsch was horrible, but I don't think it will be missed next time when I leave it out as no one liked it:( The hot pots were so good, I may make those as a dessert to stand alone. Very good... must try.

Love this recipe. Have made the recipe as is, and also as a traditional black forest cake. It is great both ways.

Oh, my gosh, what a FABULOUS dessert! I served this at a dinner party and it was an incredible hit--people were licking their plates! Even if a person didn't care for a particular component, they still really enjoyed the dessert as a whole. The kirsch was a little strong for some, but it's the combination of a sip of this, a bite of that that makes this dessert so interesting and fun, so I would never leave it off the plate. This one is in my permanent "special" recipe file!!

This was a fun dessert that I made for my husband's birthday. Each component was delicious on its own or combined with a different flavor. Our guests loved it!

I didn't want to waste any of the cake, so instead of making a rectangle and doing cut-outs, I poured the batter into lined muffin pans. It turned out great, and took a lot less time to cool off. My family loved this!

This recipe is unbelievable. Have made it 2x, both with rave reviews! No changes to the recipe.

Loved it! Served this at a dinner party and it is so much fun to eat. Yes, the kirsch is a bit strong for some, but part of the fun is to experiment and see what combination of flavors balances the kirsch. I followed the recipe as written. I tried it out once to practice and used some awful frozen cherries from Von's. The second time around I went to a different store and bought organic frozen cherries--that made all the difference in the world. This is a personal taste thing, but I didn't want to use pie filling because it would have been too sweet with the chocolate pots and cake. The red wine in the cherries balances out the sweetness.

This was nice to look at and delicious. I cut the cake into heart shapes for Valentine's Day. We didn't like the cherries--too strong and bitter in the test version, so I used a sweeter,store-bought cherry tart filling, and we also skipped the kirsch.

This is the perfect make-ahead dessert!Once the components are made, it takes only a in minutes, and so delicious! The cake is delightfully rich (I used espresso instead of coffee), and the fudge pots were so incredible we were all literally licking the ramekins at the end to get every bit! I used half frozen dark cherries and half dried tart cherries int he compote to add a bit more texture and more complexity of flavor (cook the dried cherries in the wine/sugar first until slightly plump, then add the frozen cherries and proceed per the recipe). The only part that I didnt' like was the kirsch. That stuff is like fire water and it all went to waste since it was too strong even to sip. I think I'll lightly lace the whipped cream with kirsch next time instead.

A wonderful recipe, and so easy to make ahead for a party. Because the cake part got mixed reviews, I used the recipe for Double Chocolate Layer Cake instead, and that came out spectacular. Also, for the chocolate fudge pots, I made the specified amount for a 4-person dinner party, figuring extra never hurt, and I think the amount I ended up with would satisfy maybe 6 people. But that's mostly because it's incredibly good and people will want more.

I made this for my family Christmas dinner and it was a HUGE hit. Even my finicky 5-year old niece enjoyed this. I would not change a thing.
