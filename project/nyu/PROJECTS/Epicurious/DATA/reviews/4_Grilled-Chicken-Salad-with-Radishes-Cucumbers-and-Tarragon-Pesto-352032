39g of fat per serving!Sounds like a wonderful salad, but not very healthy.

Great recipe. It was a little time consuming to make but worth it. I marinated the chicken breast overnight with dried tarragon, olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The chicken came out flavorful and complimented the salad.

A very pretty salad! Delicious! And a big hit with company.

This recipe was not a big hit at a dinner party. I expected the tarragon pesto to be a really nice spring time dish, but it was not well-received.

My husband and I love this unusual take on chicken salad and it has become a summer stand-by for us. The only thing I change in the recipe is to use toasted pine nuts and I brine the chicken BRIEFLY instead of salting it immediately before cooking. I make extra tarragon dressing and pesto and refrigerate it until I need it.

There are so many chicken salads and they usually taste pretty much the same. This had great flavors, loved the tarragon pesto. We are growing radishes in our garden can't wait to make it again

This was quicker to make than the recipe indicates. I made the mistake of using some old oil, and it really spoilt what otherwise could have been a delicate taste. I found the pesto too bright green for my visual pleasure - maybe I food processed it too much.

Very tasty salad with easy to pull together ingredients. The pesto made with tarragon is delicious and perfect for a spring/summer one plate/bowl dinner.

I loved this recipe! I was tempted to mix the dressing and the pesto but made the recipe according to directions. The intense flavor of the pesto was exceptional. I used a tablespoon of water instead of additional oil to thin it out. I also used a little pesto on one side of the grilled bread for added flavor. I will definitely make again.

This was a beautiful and very flavorful salad. I can't believe the reviewer who said "not so tasty". We thought it was very tasty and fresh. I used a hothouse cuke. We are getting ready for a big Passover meal, so wanted something light and spring-y and this fit the bill. Will definitely make again. I don't think the dressing needs garlic.

The cafeteria at my office is making this salad this week. It is amazing! Great Spring salad. Very fresh taste.

Beautiful salad, not so tasty results. Too much lemon, salt, oil. Will not attempt to make again.

This recipe was incredible!! Now for my changes, I added garlic to the dressing. You don't need all of the dressing, I only used about half of it. Great, great, Spring flavor!

I made this with the Tarragon Pea soup. I did not make the pesto or put the pine nuts in the salad, but did use the olive oil dressing with tarragon all over...again it was a hit!

My mother always made roast chicken with tarragon (rather than thyme or rosemary), so this recipe was a real hit of nostalgia for me... besides being incredibly delicious even WITHOUT the Proustian memory!

This was an excellent salad. I live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill, so I just pan-seared some chicken breasts, which worked quite well. Light and fresh, it tastes like spring, especially with the tarragon pesto.

The recipe came out just as good as it looked on the cover of Bon Appetit. I added one clove of garlic to the pesto instead of the shallot and also made double the amount of pesto. I used the extra to brush on the chicken before grilling. My husband and I both loved this recipe and are looking forward to the leftovers tonight.
