Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is time-consuming. But I've been making this dish for 15 years, whenever a special occasion arises or I have vegetarians over for dinner, and it is ALWAYS a hit! Like almost all the other posters suggest, slack off on the cheese but not on the porcini, wine or pesto. That's what gives it such a robust flavour. I made this for a chef friend who was very impressed. He said he would never make it in his restaurant because of those 2 big hurdles (expense and time) but loved being treated to something truly unique. I'll be back for this recipe time and time again.

absolutely love this lasagne! instead of canned tomatoes, i use the provencal oven-roasted tomato sauce from epicurious that i froze earlier in the summer. this time i also used homemade pesto and added a little steamed kale to the filling. so good.

Really?? I thought this lasagna recipe was very average, even with all of the choice ingredients. I even made my own ricotta cheese, substituted various kinds of mushrooms for the 2 listed, and added more sauce (personally, I would double the sauce amount.) I decreased the amount of goat cheese (I am a goat cheese lover, and 20 ounces sounded WAY too much), and added fresh mozzarella cheese. I am disappointed in the end result.

This was easy and tasty but I have 2 issues with this recipe: 1. It's unattractive so not entertaining fare in my book. Looks pretty sloppy coming out of the oven, even gussied up with the tomato and basil. 2. It's expensive (granted I'm in Sweden where most things are) for a weeknight dinner, which is the only thing I'd make this for.

My complaint with this recipe is that the ratio of sauce to filling is too low. The sauce is delicious but we could hardly taste it because there wasn't enough of it to go around. And I followed the amounts very carefully. I'd also skip the expensive dried porcinis and use other shrooms. Couldn't even tell they were there.

This was really good, and the frozen leftovers seemed even better. I added a handful of dried gourmet mushrooms-a mix I get at the store that supplies the upscale restarants.

This was absolutely amazing and I will be making this over and over. I used portabello mushrooms instead of button, and will do so again next time. Also, the sauce for this recipe would go nicely over fettechini.

This is insanely delicious - I have made it many times, to rave reviews. I used to be a hardcore meat lasagne person, but this is so "meaty" you don't miss it. Any combination of fresh mushrooms works - but do NOT skip the porcinis. They are key to the flavour of this dish. Works well to make it, freeze it, and bake later, too.

I cannot believe the positive reviews of this recipe. I followed it to the letter, and it is without a doubt one of the worst lasagne recipes I have ever made. I will be discarding the leftovers.

This is my all time favorite lasagne recipe. My only change...I add quite a bit more wine (whole bottle, minus a glass for the cook) and let it reduce.

Excellent! I've been making this recipe regularly since it came out in 1994! The only modification that I do is to increase the volume of sauce with a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes. I served it to some friends from Italy. They couldn't believe that I was putting pesto in lasagna but as soon as they tasted it, they had to have the recipe!

Those concerned with time and expense may benefit from a few modifications I've made with great results. First, living on an island with scarce and expensive ingredients, I substituted 1-1/2 jars of purchased gourmet porcini mushroom and red wine pasta sauce in place of making the sauce. Choose a thick, not runny or "light," sauce. (Faster, cheaper, and no porcini grit). However, I made my own fresh pesto sauce for the filling, with equal parts fresh basil, mint, and cilantro, and more garlic than one might normally use for pesto. I also used only 1 container of ricotta, and 12 ounces of herbed goat cheese. The end result has been endless requests to repeat. I also agree with the reviewer who suggests cooking ahead and reheating, to allow the lasagne to firm up and be served more easily.

This is soooo good. I always scoff when people say "You won't miss the meat." But seriously, you won't. Use no-boil lasagna noodles and this is a super-easy dish. Make extra and save it.

Echoing other reviews, this is expensive to make (I spent around $55 on almost all organic ingredients). If I try this again, I will definitely follow suggestions of other reviewers: needs a lot more mushroom sauce, doesn't need as much goat cheese or ricotta, be careful about the porcini water grit.

Followed the recipe slavishly and can't imagine how you could improve on it. Sorry, it's fantastic just the way it is. Be warned, it is a fair amount of work, however, and expensive, as everyone has said.

Like the flavor, but would cut back on the rosemary, thought it was a little too strong. Took the suggestions of other and cut back on the goat chesse. Overall, was very good

Excellent. I made this about 6 months ago and forgot to rate it. Had about 3 pieces left over that went into the freezer. Just finished the last one and even frozen/reheated it is just fabulous. An absolute must try!

I doubled this recipe for the vegetarians at a party and it was devoured. I'm not a mushroom fan and couldn't believe the mounds of mushrooms that went into the sauce - and was worried it would be too much but it ended up gorgeous and loved by meat and non-meat eaters alike. And yes, it is hella expensive and I bought everything I could at Trader Joe's.

I've been making this lasanga for years. I started a catering business recently and this has been a hit. If you have the time and equipment, try it with sheets of fresh pasta. I find I need to use a 15" x 10" (4-quart) Pyrex dish to fit it all. A triple recipe fills 4 regular 9" x 13" glass dishes, and it freezes well. Who could afford a triple recipe? A nearby Italian deli has reasonable porcini mushrooms and 4-lb. tubs of whole milk ricotta. Trader Joe's has good prices on Parmesan, goat cheese, and button mushrooms. That leaves the always expensive shitakes, but this dish is worth it.

I ahve been making htis recipe for several years and I LOVE it. I do use only about half the goat cheese and I vary the mushrooms with whatever I can find in the store - though the dried porcinis are a must. Definitely worth the time and money for a special meal.

What looked to be a promising vegetarian entree turned out to be quite mediocre. I followed the recipe exactly but if I were to make it again ( unlikely because it is expensive and time consuming) I would follow some of the sugggestions to increase the sauce and decrease the goat cheese. Wonderful components, but disappointing dish.

Rating: 3
Wonderful different lasagna, surprisingly light with all the different cheese was the main comment from my family. I would add more goat cheese and pesto; I added a bit of dried oregano as well. I also found it to be expensive (around the $40 mention) but worth every penny!

I've been using this recipe for years - it is by far our favorite lasagne. I've found, however, that I have to multiply the sauce recipe by one and a half, or I run out putting the layers together. I, too, play with the mushroom permutations - using more button 'shrooms, or portobellos, whatever looks good at the store. I've also found, as someone else has warned, that making this dish is expensive; I've never gotten away with as little as 44 dollars: add the stuff for salad and you can spend 60 or 70 easily.

Like the others, I decreased the amount of goat cheese--though you can get a good price on a large amount (e.g., an 11 ounce package) at Sam's Club. Easily one of my favorite lasagna recipes!

I haven't actually made it yet... But just a warning, following the recipe I ended up with $44.23 in groceries... not counting the pesto and herbs which I already have... ouch.

I needed a recipe for a vegetarian dish and thought this one looked good. It was amazing. I think it is my favorite lasagne recipe of all time. I also decreased the goat cheese to 12 oz., but added a few oz. of finely shredded mozzarella on each layer. The next time I plan to use all of the goat cheese. It makes the dish. The pesto really added to the recipe, so I would not decrease it at all. It was a truly excellent dish!

AWESOME. Do NOT skip the goat cheese although I reduced it to 12 ounces with great success. Just don't skip it. It provides the tart contrast to the rich creamy ricotta and the smoky mushrooms and pronounced rosemary perfume of this dish. This is an EXCELLENT combination, nicely balanced. If you have access to a wholesale "membership warehouse" a.k.a Sams' Club etc you can buy a 12 ounce log of a smooth creamy montrachet for this recipe as well as a 3 lb tub of whole milk ricotta, all for a reasonable price. A luxurious recipe, but nicely balanced and well worth it.

This was delicious with the following modifications: add 1/2 pound mushrooms. Add 12 oz more of the crushed tomatoes/puree. Add 1 Tbsp. fresh parsley to the ricotta mix. Decrease pesto to 1/4 cup. Emphasize to not let "dregs" of porcini-soaked water go into the recipe. Reduce goat cheese to 8 or 10 oz. (I couldn't find Montrachet so I used feta cheese made from goat's milk) and add 1 to 1-1/2 cup mild soft cheese (I used some Danish fontina). Really excellent! Rave reviews, guests and family had second helpings. Guests asked for recipe.

Excellent combination of flavors. Very yummy!

This was good - I took the advice of previous reviewers and decreased the cheese and increased the mushrooms. It worked great. One problem though - no matter how many times I soaked and strained the dried mushrooms, they remained gritty. I ended up using just the strained soaking liquid and throwing away the mushrooms. Am I doing something wrong?

This recipe is one of those very few that make you feel like you are in another place and someone lovely made it for you. The flavours are that romantic. Wouldn't change a thing.

I don't usually bother with the goat cheese, but the wild mushroom sauce is a winner. I use it whenever I make lasagna or baked ziti, or just about any pasta with a red sauce.

Although this is a delicious recipe, it definitely does not need 20 oz. of goat cheese--I used about 15 oz. and it was still very rich. Not a dish for a crowd watching their waistlines!

Every time I make this, people LOVE it. I also add some extra tomato puree just because I like my lasagne a bit more saucy.

I made this recipe to feature some dried porcini I brought back from Italy -- it really boosted the mushroom flavor wonderfully. The adjustments I made to the recipe worked fine -- only one container of ricotta, 6 ounces of goat cheese and one egg. I topped it with some mozzarella cheese because the goat cheese didn't melt across the top the way I like. One thing I learned about lasagne when in Italy -- you should absolutely cook it ahead and let it cool ("rest" was how someone there put it.) Then when you reheat it for dinner, it will hold together when you cut it instead of sliding apart all over the place. It worked for me!

With so many of my favorite tastes included (goat cheese, porcini mushrooms, basil. . ) I expected this to be wonderful. Unfortunately, the flavors overpowered each other resulting in a good, but not great, dish.

Everyone went crazy for this with the goat cheese and pesto and all the cheese. I added another 10 ouces crushed tomatoes and a few extra ounces of mushrooms when making the sauce. So Good!!!!

Way too much ricotta for the lasagne, and nowhere near enough mushroom flavour, in spite of the fact that I added more mushrooms than the recipe called for. I found the end result rather uninspiring.

Rating: 4
The grocery stores around here are perpetually out of shitake mushrooms, so I substituted crimini and they worked out nicely. Don't skimp on the porcini, though--it's pricey but worth it. Gotta be careful reconstituting 'em though. I always err on the side of too much water. You can cook it down a bit when you're doing the onions and that seems to work pretty well--the sauce stays drier without a long cook-down time and you still get the flavor.

Rating: 3
Very good-- but very rich, all that cheese! I usually hate anything with ricotta cheese in it, but I did like this. I wish that the mushrooms were more prominent, i.e., not drowned out by the sauce. The mushrooms did make it so that you didn't feel like you were missing the meat that's usually in the lasagna. Also I made my own pesto, which I got from epicurious.com....that's a good recipe too!

This lasagne is delicious. I made it with less goat cheese though. I found that 12 oz. of goat cheese was enough. And I used less of the dried mushrooms. I was a real hit with my family. Even my two year old loved it.

This recipe makes a fantastic lasagne. Instead of a full ounce of dried porcini, I used half dried porcini and half morel (very good, but next time I'll buy enough porcini); I also used a sun-dried tomato pesto in the filling. The sauce is unbelievably good. Next time I will cook the sauce down less so that I end up with a saucier lasagne; I'm always amazed at how much the pasta absorbs sauce while baking.

We love goat cheese, pesto, mushrooms and lasagna - so this is a perfect combination. It turns out well every time. Vegetarian, but most carnivores won't even mind, it tastes so good.
