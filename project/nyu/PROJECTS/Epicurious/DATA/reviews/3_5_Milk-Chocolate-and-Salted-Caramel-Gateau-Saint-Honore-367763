Gateau is very tasty and impressive looking but the recipe is tedious and time consuming. The butter did not incorporate well into the caramel pastry cream, resulting in a curdled looking product. I doubt that I will make it again.

The recipe had tons of steps, but was worth every bit of effort. It served 11 with left overs. We didn't try to slice it, but just broke cream puffs off and put the diplomat cream by spoonfuls on dessert plates. I had a bit of trouble adding the butter to the mousseline, and had to let the chilled pastry cream come up to room temperature before the butter would mix in.
