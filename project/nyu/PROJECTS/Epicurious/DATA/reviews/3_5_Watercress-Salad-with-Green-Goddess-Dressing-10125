This was great. We're on a low-salt, low-fat diet, so I reversed the proportions of mayonnaise to yogurt, used non-fat mayonnaise, omitted the anchovy paste and blended it all in a mini-prep. Despite the changes, it was lovely.

Quite a bit for two people, even salad lovers. Would probably serve four as part of a full meal. The dressing doesn't go very far for a salad of this size, but I found that doubling the yogurt and mayo still provided a good herbal flavor, without doubling the herbs. Great use for home grown herbs.

One of the most interesting and delicious salad dressings and using watercress in combination is perfect.

A delicious dresing on any salad. Varieties I've included are: substituting sour cream for the yoghurt; added a mashed avocado, and extra freshly ground pepper. This is a delightful salad. Add some tuna or grilled chicken for a nice touch.
