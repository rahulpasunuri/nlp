I used cod (best deal at the fish counter today) and panko (had it on hand). Super simple recipe, and super tasty. Hubby said it's "a keeper". I served it with roasted beets, carrots, and green beans; last of the heirloom tomatoes and basil with EVOO drizzle; sauteed kale-shallots-garlic; and whole wheat sourdough bread.

Orange Roughy is my fav fish and I love this recipe. It's simple and doesn't overwhelm the protein. It's also super fast. Baking may take 7-10 minutes.

The crumb topping was mushy and the flavor just didn't work for me.

This is very good with less butter than called for, and spraying the dish rather than buttering it works fine. A really tasty and quick way to prepare orange roughy, which I didn't think I liked. I'll definitely fix this again.

Good and quick. Made it with Pacific snapper, panko and a touch of dill. Had to put it under the broiler for a minute to get the crumbs to crisp up. As written, it is too buttery for my taste, so next time I'll bump up the dijon and halve the butter.

I made a few modifications because of what I had on hand at home (salmon instead of orange roughy, lime instead of lemon) and I also wanted to make it in a zip & steam bag instead of in the oven, so I didn't use the butter. Still, it was fantastic and a LOT better than I expected it to be. Using the zip & steam in the microwave, it only took me a grand total of about 6 minutes start to finish to get this dish on the table. If I did it again, I would throw some veggies in with the fish (zucchini, peppers, etc) to get a full meal in one bag.

I doubled the recipe exactly and had way too much liquid - discarded some but the breadcrumbs were still soggy. I would cut the butter in half, use panko, and just use enough mixture to lightly cover the fish. I hope these modification will result in crisp breadcrumbs. Flavor is very good.

Yummy and so easy! We'll be eating fish more often now. I can't wait to try this on cod or haddock. I used stuffing mix for the bread crumbs since that's what I had on hand. To be healthier I used only half the butter. My fish might have still been a bit frozen so it took 15+ minutes to cook. Next time I'll use 1/4 the butter and then maybe NO butter to be even healthier and I'll buy panko bread crumbs.

Rating: 3
This is very good. Not beyond compare, but definitely worth making again. I used orange roughy. Mine needed about 9 minutes. Could maybe have gone 10 min. I will probably make it again though. Very easy. I served it with the Italian green beans and potatos recipe from this site.

Next time I'll try the panko that everybody else suggested. Flavor was very good but the breading I used just didn't work, it became too soggy, the texture was strange.

yummy. substituted spicy brown and a splash of white wine for the dijon. accidently doubled the lemon, but it was still great. best right out of the oven (before the bread crumbs get soggy).

A staple for us. I have made this multiple times with tilapia and roughy. Prefer the latter! Used panko mixed with toasted chopped almonds for a more refined taste. As a novice cook, I am not comfortable cooking fish but know I can't mess this one up and it always tastes good.

Fantastic weeknight meal--really fast. I cut the butter to 1/2 of what was called for and it was still very rich.

This is wonderful with any white fleshed fish, as well as with salmon. Instead of breadcrumbs, I often use crushed canned french fried onion rings--------- -adds a whole new dimension of flavor and texture.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a hit. One problem that I had (because this was the first time I made fish) was knowing how much to make. I decided to use tilapia (much cheaper than roughy). No matter what fish, ~1/2lb per person, and the recipe adjusted well for eight people. I used less dijon and used panko and breadcrumbs mixed together for the topping. I cooked for ~15min. wonderful!!

Everyone is not always right. This recipe is for people who don't really like fish, the dijon over powered my lovely snapper.

Rating: 3
Totally surprised. Figured with all the good reviews I'd give it a try. I had a nice piece of freshly caught lingcod (still green, smelled like the ocean, yum!). Thought the worcestershire and dijon together would be too much for a mild flavored fish, but of course added a bit of garlic, a dash of hot Hungarian paprika and minced fresh dill from the garden. It was pretty darn good, visually appealing and awfully easy. Fresh garden greens and brown rice were perfect with it. I'll make this one again.

Rating: 3
This was good. Used Tilapia and panko and cooked for about 11 mins. and briefly broiled to crisp up the topping (my oven runs pretty slow). The fish was cooked perfectly, which is a big stress factor for me with anything other than salmon and haddock. Clean plates all around, including the eight year old. The easy prep and simple ingredients make this a keeper.

I think they want you to put 1/2 of the mixture on each of the two fillets...

This is my new favorite fish dish. Easy to prepare and delicious, it's great for week night dinners. My 15 year old son said it's the best fish I've ever cooked. I added about 1/8 tsp habanero tabasco for zip.

I made this dish tonight for the second time. It is ridiculously simple yet amazingly delicious! The first time I made it, I used Orange Roughy and it was very, very good. Tonight, I used fresh Tilapia - served it with Roasted Potatoes with Lemon and Garlic (from this sight) and fresh green beans. Not a morsel of leftovers!

This is one of my all time favorites! It's just so easy -- whether you're cooking for one person or six -- and always a hit. I've made it at least a half dozen times in the past year!

This was yummy and so quick! I used halibut, and I also cut the butter in half by using olive oil as a substitute. The sauce was tangy and the breadcrumbs crispy, it was very satisfying. This recipe seems very versitile, so I look forward to making it again and experimenting with other fish and additonal flavors.

I wish I could give this recipe 3 1/2. The ease of preparation and good taste persuade me to mark it up instead of down. This is a dish that is convenient, easy and quick. I used Panko instead of bread crumbs. This is a great way to prepare fish when you are having dinner alone.

You can't get a better recipe for fish! Very few ingredients....and it comes out delish..everytime. I do alter this recipe at times by mixing smoked almonds (ground up) in with the bread crumbs! Wow! Even better...if you happen to have them on hand. This is a staple at our house.

I was so pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy this wonderful dish was to prepare, and the end result was just plain yummy! My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I used English toasting bread for my crumbs, and added a tiny bit extra Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice to the butter mix. I also had seasoned the fish first with sprinkled onion powder, black pepper, and lemon pepper. I baked the dish for about 20 minutes. From the first bite to the last, it was delicious! A definite keeper in my recipe file! Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good. I did not have worcestershire sauce and substituted balsamic vinegar which was good. I also cut the butter in half by substituting olive oil. And I baked the fish about 2 minutes longer than indicated.

This is a very good recipe! I didn't have fresh bread crumbs, so I used bread crumbs I had from left over french bread, and I used Talpia and it worked out wonderfully. I look forward to making this again!

Easy and delicious-you can't go wrong! I used tilapia since it was fresh at the market and instead of bread crumbs I ground up fat free croutons. The only other thing I did differently was I added chopped garlic and freshly chopped chives. Outstanding dinner! I served it with stuffed portobello mushrooms and rice. The dinner cost me under $10 and it was something you'd order from a restaurant! A keeper!!

My husband retired in January and has been learning how to cook since. I'm so proud of him. He bought white roughy on his own and we went to "epicurious" to find this recipe. It was WONDERFUL!!! He did not use the breadcrumbs (because we are not eating starch), but it still was great. We will certainly use it again - and again. Thanks!!!

When I saw the few ingredients and the simplicity, I couldn't believe this dish would be as spectacular as the other reviewers said. However, it was fantastic. I'm rating it with four forks because of the remarkable results with so few ingredients, so little time in the kitchen, and such ease of preparation. I followed the recipe except that I used homemade Italian bread crumbs. My husband loved this dish! It will be a standard in our house, and I will try it with different fish.

This has to be one of the ALL TIME BEST fish recipe's I have ever made! Where to begin? I started by chopping together pecans and Carr's Wheat Crackers, then I toasted them in the oven until golden. Then I mixed 1/2 honey mustard and 1/2 dijon for the mustard, with the lemon and butter. I used roughy for the fish. I baked it all for about 20 minutes. It was some of the best fish we have ever made. And we have made a lot of fish. It's funny how something so simple can be so unbelievably delicious.

We rarely cook fish unliss it's on the grill. This is a great (non-smelly) way to prepare indoors. I've used Vietnamese Catfish (Basa), Orange Roughy, Scrod and Tilapia with great success.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe countless times, and have never been disappointed -- it's become a standard for my family. The best thing is how "forgiving" the recipe is -- you can substitute just about any of the ingredients. I have made it with all different kinds of white fish, and even used salmon once -- all delicious. When I've run low on lemon juice, I've used a little orange juice. Ditto honey mustard to stretch my dijon supplies! I've used both italian breadcrumbs and salted butter with delicios results. Seriously -- don't be afraid to experiment with this one! Yummy!!

Rating: 4
This dish was wonderful! I love any excuse to use Dijon mustard in my cooking, and this one wasn't for naught - it's perfect for any kind of mild tasting fish. I would cook the fish a little longer than 7 minutes though. I needed about 11-12 minutes.

My boyfriend asked me to make baked fish and I agreed begrudgingly becuase I'm not a fish eater. However, we both loved this recipe. I used tilapia. I bought is frozen at Trader Joes and now keep it in the freezer for last minute meals.

A very easy and delicious recipe. I made it with cod instead of orange roughy because I got a great deal on fresh cod. I was concerned that the dijon would be overpowering but it isn't at all, it's perfect. With all of the ingredients usually on hand, this will be a frequent weeknight dinner at our house.

Very simple, very tasty. Found the recipe 10 minutes before starting dinner, and it definitely turned out better than the improv I'd planned would have. My 17-month-old ate it by the fist-full.

Since melted butter was noted, I lightly sauteed some cloves of minced garlic in the same pan. The dijon (used less than called for) had a fit and coagulated. All in all, when it had been "blended", poured, and baked, it did't show (the lemon juice sided with the dijon). The bread crumbs that I sauteed in olive oil and butter, before topping the fish, nicely crisped and finished the top. This is an especially good flavor-combo for folks who aren't seaworthy.

This was good! I used Basa instead of Orange Roughy and it turned out great. Also used roquefort-dijon (all I had) and whole wheat bread crumbs. I think this would be good with a lot of different fishes.

I have never cooked fish before. My husband came into the kitchen to try to take over (no doubt afraid of what I would do to it!) and I kicked him out.

I fixed this recipe for my mother, and she loved it! The only modification I made was to bake the fish for closer to 25 min. (She likes her fish thoroughly cooked and flaky. Even cooked at 25 min., the fish was still very moist.) I served it with steamed broccolini w/ hollandaise sauce and rice pilaf.

Dijon and orange roughy -- what an amazing combination!

Nice Fish dish. Not out of the ordinary, but everyone enjoyed it. Note to earlier reviewers: The instructions were to heat oven to 450 degrees, butter the baking dish, arrange fish in it spread prepared butter/mustard misture over, sprinkle with breadcrumbs and bake for 7 minutes (or until cooked through)- What other istructions do you need? The oven cooks it it doesn't cook itself, but the recipe does say to bake it in the oven.....DUH!

I made this dish with flounder rolled up jellyroll fashion. It was great and so simple to make. I found it took a little longer to cook since it was rolled and the bread crumb topping got a little too soggy. Next time I might add the crumbs the last few minutes of baking and broil for a minute to brown. East weeknight meal-even the kids loved it!

To Michael, thanks so much for your comment and question. Maybe I can clarify the wording. Each fillet gets half of the butter-Dijon mixture followed by half of the breadcrumbs. The ingredients are only divided so that you'll distribute them evenly between the two fish fillets. Make sense? Best regards, Betsy

Great Dish, but what are we to do with the other half of the Mustard Mixture and the other 1/2 of bread crumbs?? Michael Weber
