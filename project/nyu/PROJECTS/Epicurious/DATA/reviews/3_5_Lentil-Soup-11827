Delicious, and very easy and simple prep, went well with house burgers from the grill on an fall day.

For a vegetarian version, I substituted vegetable for chicken broth but otherwise made it according to the recipe. I liked the heartiness but thought it was a little bland with a strong butter flavor. I liked the addition of the potatoes. After tasting the finished soup, I added a little thyme and 2 T balsamic vinegar. Although it was tasty, I prefer my other lentil soup recipe and will probably not make this one again.

I added bay leaf & tyme. The soup had a bitter after taste and a lot of scum. I washed all the veggies and the lentils so don't know why it had so much scum. I might make this again omitting the bay leaf and the tyme.

I realize that Lentil Soup is generally a somewhat thick soup, but this is over the top. Very tasty, but way too many beans for my taste. Next time I'll use a half pound of beans. I'm glad I cut the vegetables nice and chunky so they could compete with all those lentils.

Great, easy recipe. I only had 4 cups of chicken broth on hand, so I added 4 cups of water. I had just regular lentils, not French, but the rest of the recipe I followed. I thought it tasted wonderful, and was easy enough to do on a weeknight. This was much thicker than I expected - more like stew than soup.

I love this soup. It's easy and tasty. Can't ask for more than that.

I gave this 3 forks because it's a great base recipe for lentil soup (I used regular lentils). Like many others have said, it requires more to really taste good. Any combo of spices and creativity will do. As for me, I thought 8 cups of chicken broth sounded like too much. Therefore, I did 4 cups water and 4 cups (with bouillon cubes) broth (does not need salt in this case) and I think that helped it not taste like chicken-lentil soup. Keeping the veggies in bigger chunks adds more substance to the soup, and even more than their quantities is suggested. Adding other kinds of veggies would be fun too. I poured in some sherry, balsamic vinegar, cayenne, thyme, a bay leaf, and 2 fresh sage leaves from the garden. Once the lentils are cooked (before 45 min - do taste checks), turn the heat down even more and cover it so the flavors can continue to marry together. Twas excellent!

Good base for a great recipe... you can really make it your own. All the other comments prove this. Season to taste and use whats available. I finished it off with EVOO that I got from Greece and had some extra chorizo left over. TASTY!

Very good, though I did add a couple of bay leaves, a splash of olive oil, and a pinch of random herbs as suggested by other reviewers. My husband who doesn't like lentils ate all of his portion.

To me, lentil soup should have somewhat of a middle eastern flavour. I skipped the potatoes and used more carrots and some baby spinach. Good olive oil instead of butter. I used a spice mixture called Morrocan Road, which is a combination of cumin, coriander, cinnamon and mint, as well as a small crushed hot red pepper I also added a bit of tomato paste and fresh lemon juice. It was amazing!

I made this a second time with margarine instead of olive oil and a bit more than 2 tablespoons - this really added something to the flavor. Also sauteed the veggies for a little longer at the start, and again used water instead of broth. Added some salt to the water, too. At the end I just added 2tbsp balsamic vinegar and it was awesome! So good... served with sauteed green beans and red potatoes, it made a great hearty winter meal.

This is a good basic recipe. I'm vegan so I used water in place of chicken broth, and added 2 bay leaves for a bit of flavor. At the end of the cook time, it was tasty but quite mild, and required some additional spices and 2 teaspoons salt. Cajun seasoning and a dash of cayenne helped to give it some more flavor. I would definitely make it again, but with some modifications.

Used veggie stock and traditional brown lentils as well as olive oil in place of butter. Had some fresh rosemary which was most welcomed, as well as a pinch of dried cloves and mint. Also doubled up on carrots and added broccoli in the last five minutes which was a great addition. Taking the advice of many here, I added balsamic, then finally topped off with some french fried onions which I had left over from Thanksgiving. This last addition made for a FANTASTIC finish, although fresh parmesan can also make for an exciting lentil soup!

Outstanding-admitedly, I haven't made this as written but I've went ahead and added rosemary, thyme, and the bay leaves as per the advice of others and they nailed it. My wife loves this and always takes it to work for her lunch. Especially great on a cold winter's day.

Oh shoot.. I forgot to add something.. The ONE TABLESPOON PER QUART OF SOUP INGREDIENT IS: SHERRY!

I use this recipe, but I do change it a bit. Normally, I don't do this, but I wanted to make it the way I like Lentil Soup. I add a whole pound of spicy sausage, (try a spicy Keilbasa, Hot Italian or even a good spicy Andouille is best if you ask me). And, I like adding 1 tablespoon per quart of soup, as well as some toasted minced garlic. You can use homemade chicken stock, or boxed stock and it will be good. Also, I will often times add some greens to the soup like swiss chard, kale, or my favorite, adding tender fresh spinach. Now, my favorite trick to this recipe is to have some very coarse ground fresh almonds that have been oven toasted to spinkle on top. But, the lentil soup is my base.. even if I should rename and call it something else!!

I had never eaten or prepared lentil soup. This soup is great, easy to make and tastes even better the next day.

Great soup! I made this using the chicken stock recipe from Gourmet magazine, which can also be found on this site. Since the stock has tons of flavor itself, I didn't add anything extra to the soup. The only change I made was to blend half of it to make it thicker.

I would say the soup is good but kind of bland. I made it almost exactly as specified. Maybe I just expected too much of lentil soup.

Since I'm a vegetarian, I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable stock. However, I made the stock inside the soup. I used water instead of stock, added chopped celery and parsley roots. I also added a spice ball with thyme, rosemary, sage, crushed all spice, bay leaves, dried porcini mushrooms and a small chili. It was excellent.

This is a good, basic recipe for a jump-off point. I made a few changes. I used water instead of stock, to make it vegetarian. I added Bragg's Liquid Amino's and a can of cut and peeled, diced tomatoes with green chili's for flavor. I blended part of the soup,added about 2 tbs balsamic vinegar, and added thyme, as others suggested. I chopped my carrots and celery larger, so they would retain their integrity. I also added 10 oz frozen spinach at the very end for brightness. Yum!!!

I added leeks, thyme and as people suggested balsamic vinegar. I also added a smoked chipotle chicken sausage. I blended a portion to thicken it up. It is hearty and great on a cold night! Yum!

It's soup: you could vary it endlessly and you won't go far wrong. I used beef broth instead of chicken and substituted a bottle of Guiness for some of the broth. I added a bay leaf and a healthy pinch of thyme. I added a cup of chopped ham at the very end. I skipped the potato since I didn't have one and added half a diced bell pepper because I did have that. It was delicious. Be aware the green lentils called for will cook faster than regular lentils, so adjust the cooking time if you're using plain ol' lentils from the grocery store. The veggies were comfortably mushy by the end of cooking time so if you like them al dente, add the carrots later in the process. When done, I stuck my giraffe into it and pureed about half which thickens it nicely if you like it more stew-like than brothy. Will make it again, though I'll bet it will never be quite the same twice in a row.

before making this version, check out the "Hearty Lentil and Ham Soup" recipe on this site! So good!!

My version of lentil soup includes 1lb of hot italian sausage, thyme, sage and bay leaf to taste - it was fantastic (I get repeat requests for this one all winter long!)...only thing I might add would be some tiny ham cubes for extra flavor. Very hearty and great as a standalone meal or a starter!

Fantastic! Just chop up some vegetables, toss 'em in a pot, then put in the lentils and broth and cook for a while. Could not be simpler. I will definitely make this again. I took the liberty of adding fresh thyme with the broth, plus a bay leaf. I liked the results.

This was a surprisingly easy and tasty basic lentil soup recipe, but needed a bit more flavor. I added 1/2 tsp rosemary and 1 tsp thyme and it did the trick.

The best lentil soup recipe I've had. I used regular green lentils, added a bit of thyme, and lemon juice. I roughly blended it with a hand blender and added balsamic vinegar to the finished product. It was tasty and warming on a chilly night.

I wanted a vegetarian soup, so I used V-8 instead of chicken broth. Thought this was pretty bland; I especially missed the thyme I usually find in lentil soup.

Good and worth making again. I also put a few cups of the soup in the blender and then mixed it back in to give a bit of a creamier texture.

This is a good basic recipe, but it was rather bland and needed some "help." First, I added a pinch of thyme and cayenne. I used olive oil to sautee the vegetables instead of butter. Olive oil contributes a lot. It only takes about 20 minutes of simmering to cook the vegetables and lentils, so 45 minutes is excessive. Lastly, after the soup was done, I stirred in a bunch of fresh spinach (stems removed) until it wilted. I also added a couple of splashes of balsamic vinegar. Now THAT soup was great!

My husband loves lentil soup. He gave this a 10! I did add some chopped mushrooms and a couple dashes of hot sauce. Took much longer than 45 minutes to cook. (Could be my fault for having heat too low.) I like to top with chopped onions and sour cream.

This soup is very easy to make and very tasty. I was surprised how much flavor it had, although no meat was used.

Added some thyme--I didn't think it bland but tasty and garlicky. Left out potatoes--too lazy to fix, but threw in a little brown rice. I used regular lentils, not those lovely delicate green ones. Also, it was done in 45 min--I guess cooking time depends on the age of the lentils. I did add a little olive oil and some lemon at the end--after all, I'm Greek. I just read in the newspaper that lentils were served at Midas's funeral--they were found in his tomb along with roasted lamb or goat.

I look forward to the return of winter so that I can make this soup again. I have made this recipe countless times since I first read the recipe in March '96 and find it quite satisfying with a good loaf of crusty bread on a cold winter night.

I felt that I should write in defense of this recipe. I too was somewhat dubious about its simplicity since we are all used to adding a ham hock or similar ingredient to deepen the flavour. This is quick and makes a lovely soup. But you MUST use lentilles du puy (as specified in the recipe). Otherwise you might find, with a previous reviewer, the result somewhat bland. I liked it very much as a everyday dish, particularly in the winter.
