The egg mixture was so good everyone ate it before I could fry the croquettes. I'm sure the croquettes and the applesauce/horesradish dip would have worked well. I used the applesauce/ horseradish dip on potato pancakes, everyone was amazed. I doubled the recipe and halved the bechamel sauce and it was plenty for 20 people with other courses.
