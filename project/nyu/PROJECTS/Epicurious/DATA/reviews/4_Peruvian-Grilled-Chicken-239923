This turned out amazingly delicious and easy to prepare. I followed the recipe almost to the T(for once!) and the only change I will make is to marinate it longer than 8 hours. I used regular paprika, but would try smoked if I had it. I did used roasted cumin, not regulary. Definitely worth a try! I prepared this with the Tacu Tacu recipe from this site (lentils and rice). Will absolutely make both again.

This is exceptional. I've made it multiple times and it's definitely best to marinate as long as possible (at least 18 hours). The flavors are spot-on and the grilling technique is perfect. Sometimes I throw in some aromatic wood for a little smokiness.

Wow. Wow. Wow. I only marinated for 8 hours, but I'm sure longer would be better. I thought the cumin was a little overpowering, so I'll probably cut it back a little bit next time I make this (which is going to be tomorrow).

This is my favorite grilled chicken recipe. I added a half a can of beer to the marinade and used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika. Grilling the chicken low and slow creates a nice brown crispy skin and keeps it moist inside.

I'm mystified by the rave reviews here. I made this and found it okay, but far from mind-blowing.

Easy and delicious. Made this last night, with bone-in, skin-on thighs. Cut back on the soy sauce a little, per other reviewers' comments (re: salt) but otherwise made as is. Going to try with wings next time. This one will be in heavy rotation come summer.

If short on time, marinate on countertop for one hour in a ziplock bag. Have marinated it for the full 24 hours in the refrigerator and the 1 hour on the countertop gives more pronounced lime and vinegar flavors. Better chicken in my opinion.

No more of that "roadside Pollo a la brasa"!!!! Great balance of savory & salt. I'll try peanut oil next time to bring a little more Asian!

This was delicious, though a little too salty for my taste. I'll make it again, but with low sodium soy sauce next time.

i'd like to try this recipe. we eat roast peruvian chicken at an upperwest side chinese peruvian restaurant. so i was wondering has anyone roasted or baked this recipe instead of grilling it??? thanks

This has become my backyard bar-b-que staple. I use chicken wings for parties. Even the finickiest eater asks for more. Marinating for 24 hrs. also cuts the cooking time.

Rating: 4
Excellent and juicy! Pts: 1) 24hr marinade is critical 2) I upped the lime juice to the juice of two whole limes. Excellent way to cut the spice for more delicate pallets. 3) Indirect heat is also a must, as the outside gets too carbonized if over the flame.

Yum! Even pleased finicky eaters. Definitely marinate x 24 hrs. Used boneless breasts, cooked 10 min each side. Would do 10min first side, 8 min second,

I have a lime tree in the backyard, so I searched for a recipe with chicken and lime. I just had to make this dish because of the passionate reviews for such a simple recipe. I regret that I did not have 24 hours to marinate the chicken...it was more like 24 minutes in a ziplock bag on the counter. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This chicken was so tasty and moist. I only have one other chicken recipe that makes such a moist chicken (with yogurt & mint). This will become a regular offering at my house, and I will plan ahead better. Now all I need are side dishes to serve with this for an authentic peruvian meal!

Duuuuuuuuude. This chicken is a religious experience. I seriously cannot describe how good this was. Just phenomenal. My husband and I were in awe of this chicken. I did make a few changes. I substitued smoked paprika for the regular paprika and used chili oil instead of the veg oil. It added so much depth and flavour. We used boneless thighs instead of a whole chicken and marinated them for 24 hours. So tender and flavourful. One note for those who are sensitive to salt, you may want to substitute half or all of the soy with a low-salt variety. Personally, I liked it as is, but can see how some might have an issue. Bottom line: You will swear this marinade was made with fairy dust and unicorn tears.....it's that good.

Excellent! I used it on boneless, skinless breasts. I let it marinate for 24 hours, and though I was a little concerned it would be overdone, it wasn't. The marinade fully infused through the meat, and was not overpowering in the slightest.

Made as outlined and cooked at same time with brined chicken that was only oiled, salted, & peppered before grilling. The brined batch was much more juicy so recommend brining the chicken before marinating, although not sure how well the marinade will penetrate if pre-brined. Both this recipe and the simple brined were good.

Love, love, LOVE this dish! It's a meal we make at least once a month rin sleet or snow.

Perfect balance of savory and sweet. Soooo easy and was a big crowd pleaser. I was a little bit afraid of the cumin as it's not my favorite spice but it was the perfect compliment to the other ingredients. Served this with the green bean and soy-almond salad as well as the rice and cucumber salad form this site- all fantastic with minimal work. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This recipe is outstanding. I served it with a spinach salad with bacon and red onion and oiled my cast iron grill pan with a little of the bacon grease. Will make again and again. If you don't have time to marinate it all day, I found leaving the chicken out in the ziploc baggie at room temperature for an hour does the trick. (And an hour isn't really enough to cause salmonella worries.) Fast and simple.

Had this last night and it was a real hit with the family. Pan fried both sides 3 mins and into oven for 20 mins - the house smelt INCREDIBLE! Will definitely add to the regular meal roster!

This was an excellent marinade, and I second the comment of the reviewer who says it is very similar to the grilled chicken served by El Pollo Rico in Northern Virginia. Doubling the black pepper to 1 tsp. should get it really, really close. Using soaked mesquite and closing the cover on the grill gave it an excellent smoke flavor.

I love this recipe. I found that reading if fully was necessary due to the 8-24 hour marinate time it calls for. I found that the chicken was further enhanced by grilling the chicken using hickory and/or mesquite. I cannot state enough the great flavor that this adds to an already great recipe. IT is an addition that should be considered if the recipe is every repeated in another addition - albeit Bon Appetite or Saveur.

Like another reader, I used bone in breasts, removed the skin and marinated for 24 hours. Baked in 450 oven for 25 minutes with a cup of water in the pan. Finished on the BBG for 10 minutes. Served with a salas of 1 part canned/drained corn, 1 part canned/drained black beans, 1 part cooked orzo and 1 part store bought pico.

Awesome flavor, better to marinate longer. Tenderizes the chicken. Absolutely will make it again

I made this last night with boneless breasts and it came out great. Got raves from my wife and daughter. Pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I divided the paprika into half regular and half hot paprika. I thought about tipping a bit of beer into the marinade like one reviewer mentioned but didn't. May try it next time. I was careful not to overcook the breasts on the grill. Did them on a low flame and closed the lid a few times to ensure they cooked through.

I made this dish in an attempt to figure out what all the fuss is over Peruvian food. To me the ingredients don't seem so different or unique. I marinated my chicken for over 24 hours and then grilled it as suggested. I even boiled the reserved marinade to use in basting the chicken as it was cooking but I found the flavor to be ordinary at best.

This dish is fantastic! I didn't alter the ingredients, but I did cut my chicken up in smaller pieces. I also marinated it for 24 hours (it turned solid brown) and I didn't pat it dry before placing it on the grill. As soon as the marinade dropped onto the hot coals I fell in love with the aroma wafting up in the smoke. The fresh lime at the end was an excellent addition. I highly recommend this dish to anyone who likes chicken. The flavors were not overpowering...just warm and wonderful.

Big, bold flavors from common ingredients found in the pantry. Looking forward to trying on chicken wings, and pork ribs. Paprika lends an eye-pleasing, appetizing color. Was a rainy day, last minute decision so only marinated for 4 hours then pre-baked drums and thighs in convection for 20 minutes, then finished on grilled to add smoky flavor.

I won't rate this because I altered the preparation... I had boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cut into 3rds, marinated for an hour, then baked them in the marinade at 375 until firm. They had great flavor even with that simplified preparation. Served with fried green plantains and avocado sour cream puree. Very good.

Peruvian chicken is all the rage in our area, where it's cooked on a rotisserie. I was thrilled to find this recipe, and when I served it to my family my 9 year old son remarked that "it tastes just like Peruvian chicken!" I wouldn't change a thing. Just be sure to marinate for 24 hours - I left it for only 8 hours once and it didn't have much flavor.

Initially I meant to grill this less than 24 hours after I prepared the marinade, but it ended up being more like 36... Still, I grilled it up and served it. My fiancee said it was the best chicken she's ever tasted. Now I just need to figure out what other dishes I can serve with it to make it an experience.

There is no shortage of soy/garlic grill marinades for chicken but this one is worth keeping. The lime and spice combination add a nice flavor and an interesting rust brown color. I grilled the chicken over direct heat for 5 minutes on each side using a gas grill, then left it to sit on indirect heat for 30 minutes. The advantage of grilling quarters is that the temperature can be measured reliably for each quarter to optimize doneness (i.e. 160 for breasts, 170 for legs/thighs). The chicken turned out browned, juicy, and flavorful.

We have a gas BBQ and my husband was not convinced about the cooking instructions so....the chicken was halved, it marinated overnight, he grilled it on the BBQ, and then finished the cooking process in the oven. Delicious!

I have made this recipe a couple of times for different groups of people. We all loved it. Besides using soy sauce I rubbed salt on chicken pieces and once used lemon juice instead of lime. Marinted chicken for three days each time which gave wonderful flavor to each piece.

Ok so I feel like a dummy, but...we tried this and it came out half raw, then had to turn the grill back on and it wound up a little dry. Does our BBQ perhaps have too many vents? Or should I just use the rotisserie and forget the grilling?

Like another reviewer, my daughter needed to make something from Peru for her class. We did the chicken wings @ her suggestion and I have heard nothing but raves! My daughter, 15, asked if I'd make this for dinner on a regular basis. Also my son was stealing the wings out of the dish that was loaded for school. Everyone in my house LOVES this, and I might add that is no easy task!

I went straight to Epicurious and found this recipe. WOW!!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly, but I added half a beer to the marinade. The beer gave it an earthy, third world grilled taste. It was just shy of being too salty, so I would either reduce the soy sauce or use low sodium soy sauce next time. And there will definitely be a next time! Fantastic!

I made this dish just recently for a dinner party and everyone just loved it! Because of the number of people, I choose to prebake the chicken in a 350 F oven for 30 min, then finished it on the grill. I even let it marinate for 2 days and it just adds more flavour. Served it with roasted potatoes and the Mache salad with avocadoes (another recipe from Epicurious) and people could not eat enough! Had it for leftovers for lunch at work and everyone was remarking how wonderful it smelled; I have been requested to no longer heat up my meals such as this one as it makes everyone hungry!!

Marinated the quartered chicken skin-on overnight then roasted in the oven. The skin should be left on as this prevents the chicken meat from drying up. When roasting's done, I soaked up the excess oil floating with kitchen towels. So easy and simply delicious, served with rice.

I tried what the cook from St. Louis did, halfed the cumin and bumped up the paprika. I used skinned chicken legs and broiled them instead of grilled. It tasted fine, although it seems to lack something (???). Next time will marinate for more than 24 hours and use the grill.

I cannot wait to try this recipe. I buy take out Puruvian Chicken all the time. I think I will take the advice of one comment and inject some of the marinade directly into the chicken. But, as a certified Food Safety Manager, I must advise the commentor below TO NEVER USE LEFTOVER MARINADE ON COOKED CHICKEN. You must discard any leftover marinade that the chicken was soaking in. Next time make a little extra and set it aside from the marinade.
