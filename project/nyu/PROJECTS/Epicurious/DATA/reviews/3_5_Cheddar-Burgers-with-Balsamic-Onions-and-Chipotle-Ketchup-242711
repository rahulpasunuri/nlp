This dish was delicious the onions were a hit, even with my one child who despises onions. I did season the meat with a burger seasoning and crushed red pepper. There was a lot of ketchup left over, next time I'll half it.

Very good & tasty -- especially the chipotle ketchup. I used only 1/3rd of the chipotle and it was still quite spicy!

Absolutely delicious! I made these burgers as sliders for a neighborhood BBQ, and they were a hit! The onions were the star of the burger.

This was delish! I didnt put the tomato or lettuce on it. Also, just carmelized the onions in a pan with the balsamic.....very good1

I give this 3 forks instead of 4 because I dont think the "all american cheeseburger" got a make over, more like a topping overload.I think regular onions and ketchup might not steal the show of the actual meat as much as the balsamic and chipolte do. Loved it on an english muffin though. Will continue to eat my cheddar burgers on english muffins, just without the extras!

Great recipe! The ketchup really makes this. Couple things I would do differently though. For starters, I agree with other reviewers that said something should be added to the burger meat before making into patties, maybe some salt, onion, and garlic. Additionally, I used onion rolls in place of the english muffins, since i find them overwhelmed by bigger burgers and the taste not that exciting. And also a word of caution - when grilling the onions they tended to separate and I lost a few rings to the charcoal below. I took them off a little early (before they all fell to the coals) and finished them with some baked fries that I had started earlier in the oven. Very good start to the grilling season, will certainly make again and use the ketchup in other ways. Made this for a dinner with guests and got rave reviews.

Delish! We've made this recipe several times for friends and family -- all with nothing but positve results. Use king size english muffins for bun to contain all the burger goodness.

This is a fantastic burger! It is so easy and all the flavors are distinct but go perfectly together. I have used a regular burger bun and many different kinds of lettuce and they all worked well.

This was a total hit with my husband and I as well as our close friends. The ketchup is so easy, yet absolutely delicious...makes you really want fries for dipping!

These burgers were fantastic. My husband and I were especially fond of the chipotle ketchup which we now keep in our fridge and use on everything from meat loaf to dip for sweet potato fries!

I have made these multiple times this summer and followed the recipe exactly and everyone has loved them! I will definitely be making them again and again.

If you like spicy burgers than this is for you-the ketchup mixture was a little too hot for us but had an interesting smoky flavor. The english muffin could not accomodate the size burger that amount of meat makes-6 burgers out of 2 1/4 pounds of beef?

I knew I should have gone with my instincts and added salt to the meat mixture instead of sprinkling it on top. The burgers were bland, but the toppings saved the day. Awesome spin on a classic meal, and will definitely make it again with my usual homemade burger method.

WOW - yummy. The sweet onions w/the spicy ketchup make for a real show stopper; especially for something as simple as a burger. Used w/grass fed free range beef. The onions were also great as leftovers the next day as a side dish.

I added finely chopped onion and spicy A1 sauce to hamburger before forming patties and used jalapeno havarti cheese instead of cheddar. My whole family loved these burgers. The grilled onions are perfect.

Excellent! Followed the recipe exactly, except we used a good foccacia from a local bakery, I can't get into the concept of English muffins used as buns, but to each their own ;-)

Made this recipe with my sister, we loved it and thought the ketchup might be too spicy so we cut down on the chipotle. Not sure why you would use spinach leaves, didn't really add to the dish, but the onions and english muffin was unbelievable. Yummy makes my mouth water just thinking about thenm.

These burgers were delicious. Served them for a 4th of July dinner party and everyone raved the onions and particularly the ketchup were awesome.

The onions will be much better if you reduce the balsamic vinegar before tossing. Add salt to taste and let them marinate overnight and they will knock your socks off. As far as I'm concerned, the English muffin is all wrong for a burger. If you want something new, try some crusty French bread toasted on the grill instead.

My family loved this recipe! My husband loves burgers so I am always ready to try a new recipe. We live in a very small town and I couldn't find chipotle chiles in adobo sauce so I had to use ground chipotle pepper. I am sure the original recipe would have been better, however, it was delicious just the same. My twelve year old son would like his grilled hamburgers served on an English Muffin from now on-that was a nice touch!

The grilled balsamic onions were outstanding, and I'll definitely make them again...we found the ketchup disappointing--guess we're purists and don't like to mess with the classics!

These were great, and the ketchup definitely made the dish -- tangy and spicy (of course, I added extra chipotle peppers!). I didn't have a grill, so carmelized the onions on the stovetop, adding the balsamic during the last 10 minutes. I spiced up the burgers a bit by adding Worcestershire, a bit of adobo sauce, and garlic. And used romaine lettuce for crunch rather than spinach. The ketchup was great on french fries too1

Burgers were a bit bland but the onions and the ketchup were awesome. English muffins are a good choice of bun as well.

Delicious! Husband said it was the best new recipe I've tried in awhile. Used lettuce instead of spinach.

I agree. These were just regular burgers. The chipotle ketchup was a nice change and the onions were great. For this, it's the toppings that make it. I followed the tips on getting the burgers not to shrink in the issue at the back and they worked so for that I was glad.

What makes this are the carmelized onions. They are to die for. Burgers themselves are ordinary. Spinach didn't really add much, but the onions were killer. Won't make a burger again without these onions!
