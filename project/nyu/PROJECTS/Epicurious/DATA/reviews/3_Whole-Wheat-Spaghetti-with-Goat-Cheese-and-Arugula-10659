I had much better luck combining all the ingredients directly into the saucepan with the onions and sauteeing briefly - otherwise, everything seemed to get cold very quickly.

I've made this a few times, with some slight variations each time. I think the onions and basil are needed to give it enough flavor - it's rather bland without them. I substitute spinach for arugula, only because I don't like arugula. This works well.

Except for the garnishes (herbs, walnuts, and red onion), I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, it turned out sort of gloppy, even after I used more pasta water. But it still tasted very good, and I would make it again, maybe reserving even more cooking water just in case.

I love every ingredient in this recipe and liked the reviews so I had high hopes for this recipe. Unfortunately I found this dish mediocre. The arugula over powered the less dominant ingredients, which surprised me because I used less than the recipe called for. I'll keep looking for the ultimate goat cheese/walnut pasta recipe.

Perfect combination of flavors--these all go well together. For a stronger flavor, try Boucheron, an aged goat cheese, and don't forget the red onion.

My husband and I found the chopped onion on top to be too much - we both had tears streaming down our face. Perhaps we had especially strong onions. We greatly enjoyed the dish sans raw onion garnish. The melted goat cheese sauce is heavenly.

I enjoyed this dish, but I will try my darndest to find arugula next time. I used rapini and found it way too bitter. I also didn't have fresh herbs so I used herbed goat cheese, which I think was an acceptable substitute. I will try this one again for sure!

I've made this for dinner twice, and though the flavors are bright, they marry well and leave you wanting more. The first time I didn't have arugula and used steamed brocolli florets instead, which I actually prefer to the arugula. Be sure to save some chopped red onion for garnish; I didn't the second time and really missed it. Goat cheese and toasted walnuts are a heavenly combination that should be used more often. This recipe is a keeper.

Quick, easy & delicious! The flavor is very assertive and best in smaller portions as an appetizer. The whole wheat pasta adds a nice "sweetness" to the sauce. I used baby spinach instead of arugula and toasted pinenuts instead of walnuts. The pasta needs to be very hot to wilt the spinach. The cheese & pasta water sauce looks thin but will be absorbed by the pasta.
