I used skinless organic bone-in breasts, so increased the olive oil (a good quality, flavorful one), fresh oregano, added about 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice and ate it with tzatziki. Yum! I agree with other reviews re the versatility of this dish for different herbs and spices.

This was a tasty change from the usual roast chicken and I particularly appreciated being able to achieve the end result so quickly using the high heat roasting. I used crushed garlic from a jar as I had that on hand and it was perfect. If I make again I will make more of the spice mixture so that I can coat the chicken a bit more liberally.

So simple, so quick, so effective. The chicken was cooked perfectly - it was tender, juicy and flavorsome. It received rave reviews from my husband. A great weekday dinner addition. I didn't bother to crush the garlic, just chopped it as small as I could.

Delicious with a bit of tweaking. I subbed dried rubbed sage for oregano and used 2 large breasts instead of 4 (more than enough for two people, with leftovers). I roasted them for about 40 minutes and they were perfect. Moist and tender inside with beautiful, crispy skin that my boyfriend described as a "flavor explosion." So easy and so tasty...I will definitely be making this again.

I made the recipe as is. I also found that 25 minutes was not quite enough for my chicken, but as someone else said, it depends on your breasts. Everyone really liked this recipe, it was extremelly quick and easy to make, quick to clean up from, and looked impressive. I'll definitely be making it again and may add some of the other ingredients suggested just for a change, but it really is nice as is.

I made this for my husband and I tonight. I thought it needed about 20 or so more minutes cook time (I used really thick boneless/skinless chicken breasts). Seasoned with a small amount of rosemary, garlic pepper, a good amount of garlic,light red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. For the last ten minutes or so I added a light coat of butter for browning and tastiness.

I'm not a fan of oregano, and only had fresh thyme - which is my go-to herb and it was extremely yummy. Also, didn't have olive oil (amazing! ran out!) so used butter a la Julia Childs, and put the whole mash under the skin as recommended by another reviewer - and which I've done for turkeys - then salted as recommended also from a reviewer. Very nice!

I made this tonight with 2 slight alterations. First, I used boneless,skinless breasts. I Couldn't imagine buying anything else, Second, in my mind nothing goes better with olive oil like freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I put in about 4 table spoons ( I did not measure it, just tossed it in with the olive oil/garlic fresh from the grater.) This was a big hit with my family. Very juicy and flavor full.

3.5 forks. Easy, delicious comfort food. Perfect for a weeknight meal. Made as directed but used fresh oregano from the garden, and cut the salt to be healthier. Also, I didn't bother to cut a pocket in the breast meat itself, but slathered the oil mixture just under the skin. 25 minutes was perfect for me, but you might have to adjust depending on the size/thickness of your breasts. Tasty and just plain lovely. =)

This recipe needs some SERIOUS modifications! First of all, it calls for 2 - 2 1/4 pound chicken. I used 2 1/2 pounds, so I figured the time would be just slightly increased. I took the chicken out after 25 minutes (the high end of the range given in the recipe) and it was raw not only in the middle but less that an inch in. The time given in the recipe is WAY underestimated. Second, as someone else said, the high temperature BURNS the garlic on the outside of the chicken. I would advise someone wanting to make this recipe to infuse the oil with the garlic and herbs, but then strain it and use the solids inside the chicken and just the oil on the outside. When my chicken was finally done, it tasted decent and was juicy but did NOT have even slightly crispy skin as promised. I'm amazed that anyone got a crispy skin from this. My normal method of roasting chicken on high heat I only use salt on the outside of the chicken, and that crisps up the skin marvellously.

My family loves garlic but we found this to be over-the-top garlicky. Maybe my cloves were too big? (They were about half the size of my thumb.) I will make it again but cut the garlic in half. I used rosemary, which did give the meat a very nice perfume. I made it early in the day and just popped it in the oven in the evening - very easy!

This is a great recipe, served over a bed of herb rice and asparagus. I did take everyone's advice as far as adding some lemon juice and rosemary. Quick and perfect meal for a weekday. Thanks for the notes.

The chicken breasts did turn out moist and perfectly cooked. However, I didn't really like the spicing combination of this recipe...the oregano was overpowering. I might use this technique again, but not the recipe.

I was anxious to try this technique, and the result of high temperature and quick cooking produced an exceptionally moist chicken breast with terrific crunchy skin. Adjust and vary the spices and seasonings as you like; this a handy, and quick, way to cook chicken breasts.

GlassQueen from Boston is right: this recipe is valuable above all for its technique. The three breasts I had were huge (between 5-6 pounds total), so I cut them crosswise in half and stuffed the pocket that presented itself when I did so. I doubled, as well as altered,the herb mixture: mashed garlic and salt, chopped fresh rosemary, oil, and about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. The chicken, being large, required a few extra minutes (not many, though). The result was moist and flavorful. I will try other variants (garlic, lemon, ginger, and peanut oil? Prepared pesto? Garlic, olive oil, lemon, mustard? Minced shallots, capers, lemon and salt?)

The technique was what caught my attention. The recipe was good; but as an extreme garlic lover, I upped the garlic 4 fold and added more oregano. The result was amazingly moist and flavorful chicken breast. I did have to increase cooking times by 20 minutes as the allotted time was insufficient; I think it was due to the thickness of the cuts I had. I will make this again for sure and will also try different combinations of flavorings.

This was a simple and delicious recipe for a weeknight. I included feta cheese inside the chicken which gave it some saltiness.

This recipe was good, if only because it was so simple. It was a somehow a little bland. The garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes do give a decent punch, yet the dish is still not well balanced--kind of boring. If I were to make this again I would incorporate some cheese with the mixture (only in the pockets, not the top!), or I would serve it with mashed potatoes or a heavy starch on the side. Definitely a good quick meal, but nothing to write home about!

Really enjoyed it as did my husband. I used a lot of garlic. Very moist Chicken, I'm ashamed to say I've never cook breasts bone-in and they are so much more moist that way! Ooh-la-la

Good but not great. I would double the spices and rub the extra spices all over the chicken.

It was good but not great. I had to adjust the cooking time to my convection oven. My husband really liked it. Next time he wants more garlic though.

I've made this twice and it has been a hit both times. I do cut the pocket almost the length of the breast to get the seasoning spread more throughout. The second time I made it I used chopped rosemary from the garden in place of the oregano and that was good too.

Made this for a quick easy dinner - really loved it. However, next time, I would either reduce the oven temp, or add the garlic to the skin of the chicken halfway through cooking - the garlic on the outside tasted a bit bitter, as burned garlic is wont to do. Otherwise - really simple and a treat..

This was delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly but I also put crumbled gorgonzola in the pocket. We LOVED it. Simple and so easy. Just make sure you have your fan on high on your stove, it creates a lot of smoke at 500 degrees.

For the few minutes this takes to prepare, it's an okay recipe. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, I agree that sage might be a yummy addition or substitute.

one other thing: to those who found this recipe bland, here's a suggestion (what i did)--rather than making just one slit in the middle, make several smaller slits all over the breasts. that way, the wonderful garlicky mash is more spread out, and hence less bland!

wonderful and easy. my husband and kids loved it.

Not as interesting as promised. I would consider "tweaking" it with some chopped fresh sage in the pocket in the breast.

this dish was surprisingly delicious! and extremely easy! i usually pick dark meat and avoid white meat, because i find white meat bland and dry, but this was full of flavor, and more moist than white meat tends to be. also, low cal--i roughly estimated the nutrition info, and one serving is 315 cal--add 1/2 cup rice, and it's 415 cal! (roughly!), and super filling given how lowcal it is. so, we will add it to our regular repertoire, happily.

It was good, but I changed it quite a bit. First, I put the chicken under the broiler for 5 minutes. Then I used 1 minced garlic clove for each breast and put it under the skin. I added some white wine and carrots to the pan and baked for about 30 minutes at 425, basting a couple times. Served with sauteed mushrooms and thought it was really good.

Yes, it is a wonderfully simple recipe. Next time for a variation -- after all, I am a New Mexican -- I might try some roasted green chili inside and sprinkle the red pepper on the outside. That goes along with our official state question -- "Red or green?" (The best answer is "Christmas!")

I had REALLY large chicken breasts--bone in with skin. Thickest part was moist & flavorable. Used as much garlic as I knew we would like. don't understand these people that like garlic & don't use as much as they would like. Of course the recipe will be bland to them. duh! Certainly not the fanciest recipe. Would serve it to everyday company. The skin was crispy & the thickest part of the breast was moist & delicious.

I made this last night for an informal and impromptu dinner. I added smoked gouda to the inside of the chicken. Although everyone complimented the dish, I think that it was still a little bland. The cheese on the inside was a good choice or maybe even some asparagus? It needed the texture on the inside. Overall it was pretty good, probably won't make it again, I like to experiment with new recipes :)

i didn't love this chicken; i made it because it sounded like it would be juicier and tastier than a plain old chicken breast... it was kind of boring actually

Entirely too much garlic -- it overwhelms the chicken -- and my husband and I both love garlic. Not sure what the solution is other than to cut the garlic in half.

Was a great technique that, like good methodology, can be adapted to different flavours. I did not feel like hot pepper, even though I sometimes do. Added chopped fresh parsley to the pocket to help keep the garlic b reath down. Try roasting some potato halves with it smeared with the same mixture. Great basis for many flavour combinations.
