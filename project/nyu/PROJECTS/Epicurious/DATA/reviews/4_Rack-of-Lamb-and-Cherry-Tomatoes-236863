Simple and delicious. Serve with a baby green salad dressed with lemon, S&P and olive oil. A satisfying light meal.

This is delicious!! I'd never prepared lamb before and cooked it for my boyfriend on valentine's day. I left mine in slightly longer because I was concerned about it being undercooked, so the tomatoes were a tad overdone but still had mouthwatering flavor. Highly recommended.

Very Good and simple (my husband did ask if there was a sauce however). I did add some minced garlic and reduced the amount of rosemary as I think it often overpowers. Cook time was a bit longer, even for medium-rare even with letting the racks come to room temperature. I was serving 5 adults so used two racks of approx 7 ribs each (a little over 2 lb total. I stand them up with ribs interlocking (church steeple style). The tomatoes were a great addition and I was amazed at the how perfectly cooked they were - I was concerned that they would be overcooked.
