I too followed this recipe to the letter even picking up all the ingredients in my local asian mega market (yes they exist in Naperville, Il). This was close to awful and I am a big time fan fo Tylers recipes. Replace the sweet potatoes with a couple shredded carrots and a little green cabbage.

I followed the recipe to the letter. This was very bland and not worth the effort. I couldn't taste the sauce, which was very thin and runny. Don't bother.

I did this recipe oven-roasted style. I needed a sweet potato dish for a Luau for about 40 guests and didn't want to serve them mashed or baked whole. I peeled and cubed 15 sweet potatoes and put them in my biggest roasting pan. I quadrupled the sauce and with the addition of pineapple chunks (for the Hawaii theme) put it in the roasting pan. I cooked them at 375 for about 1 3/4 hours, stirring frequently. The potatoes fully absorbed the sauce. Very good result.

Very tasty! I sped up the cooking time by cutting peeled sweet potatoes into med. sized cubes, wrapping them in foil and baking them for 20 minutes, when I pulled them out, I tossed them in with the sauce on the stove. I would have given three forks but the computer wouldn't let me for some reason...

I really like the way that the flavoring ingredients complemented the rich sweetness of the potatoes. By the way, check the test kitchen notes again - they now acurately assess this recipe.

What was the test kitchen making? I don't see any condensed milk (or, for that matter, filling) indicated in this recipe. Perhaps the editor needs to clarify this...............
