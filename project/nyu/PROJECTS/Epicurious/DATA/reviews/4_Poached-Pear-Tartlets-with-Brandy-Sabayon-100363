My mother made this at my request for a birthday dinner. She didn't cook the pears long enough but the taste was excellent anyway.

This was a great end to a great meal. Served with a dessert Cabernet. Loved that you could prepare ahead so that at the end of the meal, you just heat and eat!!!

All my guests loved this dessert! My husband asked if I would make it next weekend for some other guest. He liked it because it gives the impression that it is healthy, whether it is or not.

I too, find it hard to believe that more people haven't reviewed this. I have made it several times for special times when I wanted an impressive dessert. I have been tempted to to eliminate the sabayon, and replace it with a sauce made with pear brandy, but it is great just as it is!

I can't believe I'm the first to review this recipe. I made it last year for a Thanksgiving dinner for 10, and there were raves for weeks. I usually don't repeat myself with desserts, but I will with this one. It's very special!
