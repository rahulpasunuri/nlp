I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was phenomenal. I had to cook my fingerlings for a little longer than they said (about 7-10 minutes) because some of the bigger potatoes were not quite done, but I did cook them in a nonstick pan...so maybe that made a difference? The flavors are great alongside salmon or a hearty meat.

I adore this recipe! It's delicious and easy and a truly elegant way to enjoy potatoes. Fantastic in the springtime as an accompaniment to a fish dish. I have also served it underneath friend eggs with some harissa on the side.

Great, refreshing potato dish (for once!). I used small red potatoes which I boiled the night before, then briefly broiled the skillet at the end of cooking.

I really loved the combination of flavors - it's excellent with most baked chicken recipes AND makes great leftovers too. What I did though was used previously baked potatoes, sliced & then sauteed them. That is a much better way than what the recipe was calling for & much easier.

Followed the recipe exactly. Though it was good, I agree with previous readers that it would probably be improved by sautéing until potatoes are tender and caramelized. The water is not required with young potatoes.

I made this recipe without any modifications, and it was spectacular! I wasn't expecting such a smooth and subtle taste. Yum! I'm making this for a potluck tomorrow.

I definitely agree that this dish is improved by frying. You can accomplish this by letting everything cook for much longer than listed. Let the water evaporate and then keep on cooking...Really delicious. Don't skip the lemon zest.

The flavor of the potatoes were good. Next time I will fry the potatoes instead of boil them with water.

This was easy and tasty. Had a bunch left over so I fried the left overs up in a skillet the next morning for breakfast. It made an awesome breakfast potatoe recipe. The olives got a little crunchy and it was great! I like the recipe better fried!

HUGE hit at dinner party. Used green cerignola olives and a mix of fingerling and chopped-up red potatoes. Will def. make again.

This was easy, yummy and attractive. Used redskinned potatoes and as a previous reviewer noted left the skins on---looked great. Made about an hour before dinner and then just finished off while grilled lamb was resting. Very tasty and would make again.

Really good. Don't peel if you use red- skinned potatoes, as the color adds to the overall beauty of the dish. I used lime peel instead of lemon, as that's all I had. Also used black olive tapenade instead of chopped green olives, just because I had some left over and wanted to use it. Will definitely make this again.

this was very easy, quick, and delicious. i also used chicken broth instead of water, and added a sliced shallot because i needed to use it before it went bad.

This was excellent, i did however makes some changes due to the contents of my fridge. I used kalamata olives (black ones), lime instead of lemon and i had made yummy chicken stock which i substituted for the water. i also cooked it another 30 minutes uncovered to reduce the sauce.
