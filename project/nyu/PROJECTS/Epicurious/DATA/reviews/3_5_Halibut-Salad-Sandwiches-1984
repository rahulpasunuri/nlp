Good, but not great. There are tastier ways to prepare $13.99/lb. fish.

Tasty; easy; perfect. Had a fresh halibut steak and didn't know what to do with it - didn't have the red onion, so I used a white; didn't have mayo but used aioli dijon from Trader Joe's. Also substituted a lemon and it was still excellent. My 3 year-old loved it to pieces as well - it was gone quickly!

My husband thought it was just ok. I thought it was pretty tasty. Halibut is good with just about anything. The piece of halibut I used was so thick that it took a whole lot longer for it to broil than the recipe said, despite convection broil! One should also consider grilling the halibut.

Oh man oh man -- try this! We came home from Alaska with 150 lbs of halibut. Needless to say, I have perfected fish tacos (thanks to Rubio's sauce). But this is outstanding. Try adding a few drops of Tabsco's new Chipotle sauce (if you don't have the real El McCoy peppers). Use lime or lemon -- or even orange. A delicious, easy meal.

I ran out of cilantro and so used dill instead. I also added some soy sauce. It made a good afternoon lunch.

We modified this for South Beach Diet, just eating the fish and dressing on a bed of boston lettuce. It was great! You could easily cut the amount of mayo down if you wanted. We'll be making it regularly.

This was great! I used less mayonnaise and mustard and more lime juice than the recipe called for. Very refreshing.

This is THE BEST!! and I will certainly make it again. I will also try it with tuna. My husband came home from a fishing trip in Alaska and came home with lots of halibut. We have given a lot away and I always included a copy of this recipe. My friends and family love it!!

This is wonderful. I left out the cilantro (I'm one of those who can't eat it!) and it is still delicious. I used less mayo and more lime-it is light and easy and I can't wait to use it in a hot, toasted sandwich with cheese!

Nice alternative to tuna salad. Have made it twice in as many weeks. You can tweek the amount of mustard and lime juice to desired tanginess. Make sure your Halibut is fresh.

This was absolutely delicious. I did not serve "halibut sandwiches," I served it on a bed of lettuce surrounded with carrots and olives and it was very impressive looking. The flavors of lime and cilantro blended so nicely. The flavors intensified over a period of time.

Wow this is soooo good. I served it on an onion hamburger bun slightly toasted and I used the grated peel of a whole lime. I like it better with cilantro leaves in place of the lettuce. This is simple and extraordinarily delicious - will make it again and again. I can't wait to see what people serve it with.

Good! Love the lime and cilantro. I'm not as big of a fan of red onion, though, so next time I will reduce it slightly. I also think this would be great stuffed inside hollowed-out cherry tomatoes, especially with the contrast between the red and the green (lime, cilantro).

This was an excellent recipe! I used regular mayo instead of diet and it was very rich. I agree that it would probably be good on tomatos. The rolls are a bit thick to taste the flavor of the Halibut-mix.

Presently live in AK and having attempted to prepare many, many pounds of halibut, I very much appreciate new ideas like this. Excellent and easy! Served it in tomatoes instead of bread, I also think it would be marvelous with crackers or toast points. Definitely a keeper, light (with the lo-cal mayo) and delicious!

This recipe is delicious! I used canned tuna instead of halibut and it was quick, easy and incredibly tasty. All the flavors worked very well together. An excellent recipe for tuna salad and next time I'll try it with halibut!

I do very little cooking and my limit is usually weiners and beans. However, this is an easy and tasty recipie that is wonderful for my freezer full of halibut. I used sourdough buns rather than kaisers and also melted a slice of swiss cheese on each. Kids now say that I can cook any time!

70 lbs. of halibut followed my husband home from a recent Homer, Alaska fishing trip. A luncheon for 10 women friends and this recipe helped me utilize some of the catch. It is a very delicious recipe however, I steamed my fish for 15 minutes and let it rest for a few more. I prefer it served stuffed in a tomato,on a lettuce leaf or on a Wasa type crisp bread. Nice fresh flavor and texture.
