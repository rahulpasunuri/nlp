I tried these as written, but discovered a better way! Saute the shallots and scallions in a very small amout of olive oil, mix with the goat cheese and thyme. Pat the peppers dry inside and out and stuff with the cheese mix. Serve COLD with a balsamic reduction made with a little sugar, salt and pepper. Maybe not Spanish, but great! Serve with toasted rounds of baguette.

I made these for a Spanish cooking party with friends last night, maybe it was the Cava I was drinking, but I misread the recipe and mixed the scallions, shallots, sherry vinegar in with the goat cheese, I heated as per the recipe and served with fresh thyme sprinked on top. Everyone loved them, sometimes an accident has a great result! Maybe I'll follow the correct recipe next time?

You can use as appetizers! I just take toasted slices of a baguette, spread pesto sauce on top and lay the peppers over.Yummy!

Wonderful. I've made them with the sherry vinegar and reduced balsamic vinegar. Both very good. Many requests for the recipe.

These are really good! Have made them 4 times this summer already. Trader Joes has great piquillo peppers. Have had many ask for recipe and my kids love them. The only bummer is that they are not a finger food type appetizer. I've resorted to putting a knife on the platter and people slice them and enjoy them with crackers. Also add a little olive oil to dressing.

This was good as is, but even better drizzled with a balsamic reduction instead of the sherry vinegar.

We wanted to love these, but found that they were just okay. They look really pretty, but they are lacking in flavor (seems like it would be impossible with peppers and goat chees!). Served with tacos and the cilantro-ginger rice. Won't make again.

Made these for a picnic, so I made these the day before and ate a few of them hot off the platter and chilled the rest and served them chilled/room temp. They were amazing in both incarnations, and were a huge hit. Everyone loved them! Will definitely make it into the picnic and party repertoire! Amazing!

Awesome! I will make these again and again. I added olives too and it made for a very pretty platter.

These are awesome and make a great appetizer. The peppers that I bought were already marinated. I found them at the Earth Fare on their olive bar. I used garlic and herb goat cheese. Everyone loved them.
