Anything that my two "husbands" (aka roommates) say "wow, this is great" is definitely a keeper. Used powdered ginger, added some minced garlic with the onion. Deleted coconut milk (guys don't like it) in favor of more broth, thickened with cornstarch. Used less basil, deleted cilantro (guys), and used English peas instead of snow peas (guys again.)

My family liked this recipe very well. I added the 2 tsp. fish sauce as recommended, and I also measured in heaping since the notes said it was bland.

Pretty good. I added a bit of fish sauce with the coconut milk and stock and a few cloves of garlic at the beginning.

I liked this. It was really different from other curry recipes that have soy sauce, rice vinegar, etc. I actually really like this, but added some extra veggies and some fish sauce.

This curry recipe is quite good but, as everyone else has noticed, definitely lacking something. And that thing is fish sauce. Add about 2 tsp and it will improve the dish tremendously.

This came out really good though I didn't have green curry paste, I used a high quality curry powder and added some corn starch to thicken the sauce. Spicy but not too spicy. My family loved it.

With all of the green curry recipes in this world, this one is definitely not one of the better ones. My suggestion is to look elsewhere. In a nutshell.....bland!

Although green curry paste is spicy hot, this dish was somewhat bland and boring.

I didn't think this was anything special. I have better green-curry recipes I think I'll stick with instead...

Overall, this recipe was fast and easy to put together. While I'm not thrilled with it, my husband loved it, therefore it is a keeper.

I've made this recipe several times, using the changes/additions recommended by others. Instead of chicken broth, I use 1 tbsp. of powdered chicken broth so that the sauce is thicker. I also add 1 tbsp. brown sugar, and use frozen green peas instead of sugar snap peas since I always have them on hand. I also use shrimp which I saute in canola oil (not olive oil!) instead of the chicken. This is a fast, easy and delicious meal that can be made easily with stuff from the pantry and freezer...except for the basil and coriander!

Read and heed the excellent changes/additions from others. My only novel contribution is this: my fresh basil had gone south so I used homemade frozen pesto. Vegetable additions looked wierd to me in print but were needed for color if nothing else. Delicious! Served with tropical fruit salad to cool the taste buds.

Yum! I add a tablespoon or so of brown sugar to balance out the spice, a lot more ginger, water chestnuts, and roasted eggplant.

I made the recipe with several of the additions others had and still found it lacking substance. only O.K.

Easy, flavorful recipe. I made it an hour ahead of guests' arrival for a dinner party and rewarmed it during cocktails. I left out the snow peas. It is quite rich; I will try it with reduced fat coconut milk next time. Lots of basil and cilantro are key.

The sweet basil and spicy curry flavours were wonderful. I did use the chicken stock because I thought it could thin the heavy coconut, 2 tbslp green curry paste and peas out of a can. Next time: leave out peas and add tomoatoes or yellow peppers to tone out the 'green'.

I love this dish, but I've always modified it, in line with other Thai recipes. I add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar with the curry paste. I have gotten in the habit of making this with large shrimp instead of chicken, but I recently combined two pounds of shrimp and 1 pound of chicken for a party. I always add snow peas, but occasionally sliced bamboo shoots and frequently sugar snap peas, or fresh or frozen green peas. I always add more basil and cilantro and a lot more at the end, and I use Thai basil from my garden if it is in season. If served for a party it absolutely never fails to get raves for days.

This is a very good simple Thai green curry dish. I have made this dish several times and have made few minor adjustments. I use a whole can of coconut milk (14 oz), skip the broth and use 1/2 t. Better than Bullion brand concentrate - no water (prefering a thicker sauce than is traditional), increase the cilantro to 1/4 c and the curry paste to 1 1/2 T.** I have been pleased with the following substitutions: chicken/shrimp, snow peas/sugar snap peas/petite peas. ** Finally, know your curry paste, they vary quite a bit in heat and favor. I use Maesri brand from Thailand.

I thought this recipe was very good. My husband said I could make it again anytime, he really liked it. I took the advice of others and cut the curry paste to 1 tsp, and I added a little salt.

I found this dish too spicy (even though I reduced the curry to 1 tsp.) and bland. Next time I'll try the recipe on the curry jar.

This is an excellent recipe, I like it very much. I put 2 tablespoons of green curry paste, and make the taste is stronger.

I defintely agree that you have to have the fresh herbs and the fresh ginger. Never substitute ground ginger. I did decrease the green curry paste to less than a Tbs. Served over Jasmine rice with chopped fresh cilantro and white pepper. Excellent!

This was way too spicy. I wish I had paid closer attention to the reviews prior to making it. If I try again I would redeuce the green curry paste. I like spicy food but this was over the top.

While I thought this recipe was fabulous, beyond compare, my husband thought it was too spicy. The texture was smooth, the aroma scrumptous, and the favor perfectly balanced.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I added some veggies (carrots, peppers, mushrooms) as per suggestions, as well as a bit of turmeric. I used more coconut milk (the whole can) in addition to the broth. I served it with a mango cucumber salad... I can't wait to make it again!

Made this vegetarian by omitting chicken broth (just used more coconut milk) and used marinated, broiled tofu cubes. Also added more veggies and was SO good. The fresh herbs are key.

this was so good! We loved it and so easy to make. Great with the fresh basil!

We love Thai food in my house! I made several curry dishes, so when I made this one the first time, my husband said it was lacking something. The last few times I made it, I added a few of my own ingredients that I know my Thai cookbook uses in there curry dishes. I added 2 garlic cloves, crushed, 1 tsp. ground turmeric, 2 Tbsp. fish sauce, and 1/2 tsp sugar. It really does have an effect on the dish. I also add in other vegetables that I have, brocolli, red, yellow, and orange peppers, shiitake or portabella mushrooms, even spinach if I have it on hand! No complaints, just always the same, "You didn't make enough"! Now, that's what I call a successful dinner!

This was a very flavorful and fast dish. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used canola oil instead of olive oil and used all coconut milk. I also added red bell peppers and used sugar snap peas rather than snow peas. I think that any vegetables would be delicious though. I added more green curry since it was a bit mild. I would definitely make this again and I would make it for friends for a fast entree.

Very easy & very good. I didn't have any snow peas on hand so used frozen baby peas instead, with good results. This is quite a spicy curry but not unpleasantly so, & a pile of fluffy white rice balances it perfectly. Great for a quick, simple mid-week dinner & a definite make-again.

I've been making variations on this recipe for a few years and it has never let me down. It's one of those "exotic" dishes that can be whipped up by making sure you have the core (and inexpensive ingredients) on the shelf (like tineed tomatoes...). I add thinly slices carrots, different coloured peppers, and broccoli florets for colour and added texture a few minutes before serving. Use tofu for a great vegetarian dish. The key is lots of fresh basil and fresh cilantro - especially at serving time.

This recipe has a lot of potential as a great core dish in your Thai food repertoire. After my first try--good but not great--I decided to modify the recipe a bit, and it was fabulous. First, canola oil instead of olive. Eliminate the chicken broth and use a whole 13.5 fl.oz. can of coconut milk instead of one cup. Add a 1/2 tsp or slightly less of both brown sugar and salt. No pepper needed. Choose the curry carefully. The first one I used smelled like a musty basement. The Mae Ploy curry I used the second time was much better.

Made this for a friends birthday and it was a big hit. I reduced the curry paste based on some of the reviews otherwise it may of been a little to spicy. Great dish!!!

Oh this is a fabulously flavorful and easy dish--make it as spicy as you like and substitute whatever fresh veggies you have. Serve with a thai beer to cut the spiciness.

This is a very authentic and delicious green curry dish. I make it all the time and my family and I love it! I add sliced green bell peppers to it also. Try this in combination with the Thai style dumplings with corriander dipping sauce. My favorite dinner!!!

This is a delicious combination of flavors. Go easy on the green curry -- if you don't this dish can be pretty spicy. Try substituting baked tofu for the chicken for a vegetarian meal.

Excellent dish! It has become a regular on my menu at home. Use good green curry paste, and cut down the quantity if you have trouble with hot food, but do try it. It iw worth it.
