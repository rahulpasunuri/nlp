Needs salt! Also, I added some fish sauce for that umami kick! Otherwise is quite good.

Unremarkable. Needs more zing.

I make this AS IS (possibly reducing the chicken broth to 1/2 cup) and it is outstanding. I use chicken picked from a store-bought rotisserie chicken, pour on the BBQ sauce, and then couple this with the fennel and carrot vinegar slaw and it's a restaurant quality meal that really doesn't take too much time. For extra points, try the hoecake as the foundation for this masterpiece!

I used 1 package of Starbucks VIA Italian Roast, and the sauce was quite good. I simmered mine for 45 minutes, and it was still very runny; I would recommend omitting the chicken broth.
