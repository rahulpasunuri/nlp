There is no recipe for the dough part of this pie. Suggestions on what recipe to use? Or did those of you who made it buy a crust???

Terrific pumpkin pie recipe! I roasted a farmer's market sugar pumpkin for the pumpkin puree and used the pate brisee recipe from Martha Stewart's website. Everyone loved this, including the texture, spice and crunchy topping. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!!! Made this last year and will make again this year. Everyone loved the crunchy nutty topping! Great twist on an old favorite.

This is a great pumpkin pie recipe, even if you omit the nuts. The custard has a perfect blend of flavors and consistency. I made with a GF crust from Bob Mill's Flour website.

This was my first homemade pumpkin pie and although it was time consuming (took me 2 days), it was well worth it! I'm planning to make it again this week for Thanksgiving!
