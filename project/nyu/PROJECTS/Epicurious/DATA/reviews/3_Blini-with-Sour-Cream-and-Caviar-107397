This is a great and easy to make blini recipe. Having spent time in Russia, eating my weight in blini, I can say this recipe is very on the mark.

Delightfully simple to make and nothing beats fresh blinis for salty caviar or smoked salmon

Anyone who starts ou "CIA trained" is a problem. I wnet to school as well but neverl learned anything until I started working. No wonder he has no idea about yeast! CIA TRAINED HA!

To CIA trained chief, you should know that a batter made with yeast produces gas, which makes the bubbles in the batter, and that if you close of the bowl airtight, this gas has no way of escaping. So obviously you will have an explosion at some point!

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time to go with lovely caviar for New Year's Eve and this time with smoked salmon and creme fraiche for Easter brunch. Both times it was delightful. It is simple to prepare and turns out beautifully. I made the batter early on Easter morning and only used about half of the batter. I made the rest of the batter into blini last night with the intention of freezing them to use in the near future (tho' I saw a review that commented the blini didn't freeze well. Ah, well I'll give it a go anyway!) They had developed a slightly more fermented note since it had been sitting in the fridge for four days, but it's not objectionable. I didn't find buckwheat flour this time so used regular whole wheat flour that I keep in the freezer and thought it turned fine with the substitution.

now i don´t agree with Chefmissy. If you double the recipe, it´s beyond doubt that you have to double the yeast as well. Imagine making ten recipes; still use the same quantity of yeast? A trained CIA chef should know to let yeast do its job twice; the first time, than beat it up, and let it work once more....Only then your batter is ready to use. Jeroen, Rio de Janeiro

I am a CIA trained private chef and do high end events on the side. This year a client requested Caviar, I suggested that it be served traditionaly with blini's. I doubled this recipe, followed all of the steps, and put the batter into squirt bottles for easy dispersment. I covered the bottles with plastic wrap under the threaded cap to prevent them from spilling on the journey. When the party was well under way the top of the bottle exploded and blini batter went all over the ceiling of my nice new generous clients. What could I do? Moral, don't double the yeast if you double the recipe!

WOW! This adds a new dimension to caviar or salmon! If you haven't tried fresh blini before, you've got to try this recipe. It's easy too, I've made it several times now. We own a catering company and I'm embarrassed to admit that until 3 years ago when I tried this recipe, I had never had a fresh blini, only the storebought ones. I now use this frequently as an hors d'oeuvre. I use a teaspoon for the batter and cook 1 minute per side and get about 100 half dollar sized blini. Serve with a dallop of dilled creme fraiche, a bit of salmon fume' and a sprig of dill and you have a delicious, beautiful hors d'oeuvre. Oh, they don't freeze well tho. At all. All of the texture is spoiled. But you can make them 2 days in advance and store airtight at room temp.

Made this last night for traditional caviar garnished with chopped egg whites, yolks and fresh onion. These blinis were the perfect bed for a layer of caviar, much better than toast points.

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was a big hit. There was not 1 blini left over. The batter was easy to prepare, the directions were simple and clear and the blini were perfect. I served them with a dill creme fraiche sauce and salmon caviar.

Made the batter one day ahead and chilled it per Cook's Notes. The blini were perfect. Added creme fraiche, good caviar and Veuve Cliquot. Result? Sublime and oh-so decadent. Happy New Year!

Caviar is served with creme fraiche, and yes traditionally blinis are made with 1/2 buckwheat, 1/2 all-purpose flour.

Made this as an appetizer for our culinary club's "Russian" night. Was very enjoyable. Will put recipe in my permanent file to make as hor'doerves in the future.

I also made this one for New Year's Eve -- not as delicate as some blinis I've had, but a good solid recipe that received rave reviews (and every last one was consumed!) Good with chives and sour cream and caviar, or smoked salmon, or whatever combination of rich + salty you prefer...

Made this recipe for NY Eve - was very good, traditional blini taste. The trick is to use thin batter. I put it in a syrup dispenser when preparing to fry the blini and control the size. Made the blini $.50-sized and made about 50 - 60. Turned out great. Pre-made blini are $10.95 for SIX little blini in these parts, so buying buckwheat flour for $2.00 or so was a bargain!!! We had them with Tsar Nicoulai Osetra Caviar, creme fraiche, etc. Too bad for my pocketbook caviar is so addicting.

This recipe is complicated, requires buying special ingredients I may not use again (such as buckwheat flour), and was not fabulous. The blini are extremely rich, and so eating more than two ruins your appetite for anything else. I thought they would be wonderful with champagne, but they weren't so great.
