half and half has more fat, more calories and half the taste and consinctency of light cream...substitute always

Chicken Broth? Are you INSANE? You HAVE to use lobster stock here. Either make your own or buy some Better Than Bouillon Lobster Stock at your local market for four or five dollars. IT MAKES A WORLD OF DIFFERANCE!

Yummy - took the advise of another and made my own lobster stock in place of chicken. I got 1 cup of meat out a 1 lb lobster and for the stock boiled down 6 cups of water (and onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme) to about 3.5 cups. Tons of flavor. Good size serving for 4.

Really good. Had a frozen can of lobster needing to be used, and this was the perfect recipe for it. With crusty bread, this was a great meal!

Excellent! Everything I hoped it would be. Halved the recipe and used a 9 lobster tail. Tossed the shell and corn cobs in broth while simmering. I do wish there was a little more broth as well, but I hesitate to add more because I don't want to lose the flavor of everything else. I would also consider adding a little cayenne pepper in the end for a little kick. Delicious!

I can't believe how EASY, EASY this recipe is! They didn't have fresh lobster the day I went to the store,so I used fresh crabmeat and some prawns (I cut them into about 1/4 inch pieces). I do think that the ratio between broth and "substance" is off, so next time I will add more broth. I plan on making this again next week for some friends for our x-mas dinner and will sub. with turkey bacon, as one guest does not eat pork. And of course, lobster!! Definitely a great ONE POT MEAL!!!!

OMG...I had a lobster claw (huge from 4 lber) and fresh corn on the cob left over and didn't want to waste them. This is the best chowder!! It makes a substantial amount and four of us were able to make a very large dent in it!! Will make this again, soon.

With minor modification, this is now a family favorite. I would really, really suggest springing for a whole lobster so you can boil the carcass to sub lobster broth for the chicken. Like a previous reviewer said, the price per serving comes out very reasonable, and the depth of flavor is AMAZING. I had considerably less lobster than was called for because we'd had the lobsters with surf & turf the night before, and there wasn't much left. Using the lobster broth though, made the chowder taste like it was absolutely LOADED with lobster. Fresh corn is a must. Wonderful!

I made a few changes. I added half a large sweet potato and only one russet. I also added a large clove of garlic and some oregano at the end because I thought it needed something extra. Instead of lobster I used scallops. Tasty!

An excellent soup..while vacationing in Maine, pulled this off the computer. Since I had little neck clams for dinner the night before..I kept the clam broth and substituted the clam broth in place of the chicken broth..I am glad I did..actually might have added more broth then recipe called for to offset the saltiness of bacon..I might go a little lighter on the bacon next time..added NO SALT..and did half haddock and half lobster..the sherry is the finishing touch. This is an excellent chowder, no matter what sort of seafood you decide to put in it. The fresh corn is the key thing..sweet and creamy..can't imagine anyone not liking this recipe..my husband is real picky and he really liked it.

This was great. Dh raved and ate all of it. I did use shrimp instead though.

The key to this recipe is using fresh corn. Absolutely creamy and sweet. I halved the recipe and simplified the ingredients: one potato, one med onion, a green pepper works just a well. Don't measure; just chop and add. The lobster was a wonderful contrast.

Yummy and forgiving recipe. Didn't have enough lobster so substituted flounder for at least 1/2 the seafood (I'm sure ALL lobster would have been even better. Only had green pepper. Boiled lobster shells in liquid for extra flavor as recommended by others. Used regular bacon. It's a keeper.

My husband thought it was o.k. I didn't like it at all, so I probably won't be making this again.

This is a fantastic dish. What a treat in late winter with Snow predicted. Ok, a 1 3/4 lb lobster was $19 in my market - lobster is expensive in winter, even in New England. But at 8 servings it comes in at less than $3 a serving - hardly a budget buster. I did make 2 modifications: I simmered the lobster shells and carcass in the broth before cooking the potatoes. And I used heavy cream since I had it on hand. the thickness of the chowder really just depends on how much liquid you add. Mine was quite thick and rich.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving. I thought it was very tasty, but would have liked the body of the soup to be a little thicker -- more like a chowder. It's also an expensive soup if made with fresh lobster. One of the other reviews mentioned adding sherry which might be a nice touch. I will try it next time, but the soup made according to the recipe has a nice flavor.

i made this dish with crab instead of lobster and it was wonderful! i made a crab broth by simmering the shells in veggie broth and skipped the 1/2 & 1/2 - it was rich enough without.

Fabulous. I served this chowder with eight dinner guests and received rave reviews. I used canadian bacon instead of slab bacon (less fat) and added a touch of dry sherry to each serving. Fresh lobster is recommended.
