A real winner; simple and delicious. Added celery and more spinach for extra veggies, used imported Italian cannelini which I would not do again as they are too big compared to everything else, and yes to more pasta. I am not sure how much 1/2 cup elbow macaroni weighs, but I used 6+ ounces and would take it up to 1/2 a pound at least.

very good and easy. I used 5 sweet turkey italian sausages and no ground beef.

Our family loves this meal. I add sauted shredded carrots and diced peppers with the onions to get a few more vegetables in the mix. I also add ground beef in addition to the sausage and use a full box of rice pasta, which seems to thicken the ragout a bit. It's a very filling, tasty meal that freezes well.

I really enjoyed this dish. It's a great one-pot meal for the weeknight and leftovers. I took advice and increased the macaroni to 3/4 cup. I used chicken sausages with roasted red pepper and spinach in them. I increased the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and used Aleppo peppers instead. Finally, I used chopped collard greens in place of the spinach. Really fun and tasted hearty, but light too.

OK folks. This is solid family-fare, midweek or for low-expectations weekends. But let's call it for what it is: basically it's Hamburger Helper. Mighty tasty HH, I grant you. But HH it is nonetheless. Let's not go all gourmet on this one, you can keep the chianti on the shelf. It's tasty, the kids will like it, but for god's sake, keep it off the dinner menu for when the guests arrive.

Really good ragout with no changes to the recipe. Perfect for the cold snowy winter we've had in CT this year.

This was an instant hit. Made for the first time right before Christmas, and when it was done and we saw the red and green colors, we decided to call it our Christmas Ragout! I didn't have ground beef so I just used a package of the spicy Italian sausages (5 in a pack). The fresh basil really makes a difference, as does the cheese. Also used GF pasta so son with celiacs disease could enjoy. He ate ALL the leftovers!

This is a good recipe that you can do other things with.....like maybe a casserole...I made the recipe thick...didnt use chicken broth....and made the macaroni on the side and then poured the sauce over the macaroni...delicious...also I think that this is healthy....beans spinach meat cheese all natural.

This is an excellent hearty meal. I've made it many times over the last 5 years. I sometimes add a can of dark kidney beans to increase the amount. I usually add a little more crushed red pepper... LOVE the spicy flavor.

This was really good, and a perfect kid friendly (with Sweet Italian sausage at least) weekday meal. I will definitely make this again.

This is a perfect winter supper with some crusty bread and a simple green salad. I subbed sweet Italian sausage for ground beef, sometime I remove the casings, sometimes I don't, depends on the time factor. The ragout is very hearty, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food and we all love it.

Easy and reheats perfectly. I was afraid 1/2 cup pasta would be too little, so doubled it and it was a tad too much. Next time, 3/4 cup.

This really was as good as the previous reviews said - and really easy! My kids are not bean/spinach fans and they loved it. Followed directions but did drain the meat/sausage. A real keeper.

This was a really fantastic stew. Extremely hearty and also really easy! I would add another can of beans next time. I also bumped up the pasta to 3/4 of a cup. I think that you could probably do 1 full cup of pasta without increasing the liquid and it would work just fine. Definitely a keeper!

I have been making this for 5 years now. It is easily modified and I can usually make it with ingredients that I have on hand. Short on chicken stock? Add some beef broth instead. No tomatoes? Add a jar of chunky spaghetti sauce. In our house, the kids refer to this dish as "World's Best Pasta."

This meal is absolutely delicious. I made only a few changes to the recipe, only because I didn't want things to go to waste. I added fire roasted peppers and fresh mushrooms, which I had left over from another meal. I did cook the dish longer then called for in the recipe. I wanted the flavors to blend which they absolutely did. In addition to this, I just heated texas hot toast and it was perfect.

Not elegant, just delicious on a cool evening. Smells out of this world cooking. I can only imagine it will get even better the next day. No changes to recipe other than draining meat after cooking and draining the beans.

Another winner to go into my arsenal. I made this pretty much as indicated but left out the ground meat (didn't have any) and used one lb of medium sausage. I also left out the carrots and celery (not making chicken soup here). I cooked the sausage and then scooped it out and cooked the onions in the sausage fat with a bit more olive oil. Then I continued the recipe as indicated and came up with a beautiful THICK ragout that was to die for. I didn't have any elbow macarroni so I used those tiny bow ties (about 3/4 cup). The starch from the pasta was wonderful and made the broth nice and thick. It gets a big thumbs up.

Love, love, love. I make this all the time during winter months. My co-workers ask me to bring leftovers in whenever I make it. Definite staple for the winter months.

Excellent! Made with ground turkey instead of beef. Yummy and tasty!

A great and versatile soup. I eliminated the ground beef and increased the sausages to 5. Garbanzo instead of the cannellini beans worked great and, because we love pasta, I increased the chicken broth to 48 oz and used a full cup of macaroni. Also, two tablespoons of dried basil replaced the fresh. This has become a staple in my kitchen, a great "go-to". And it's even better the second day.

I found this to be quite good and very Italian. After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned about this turning out as a soup, which was not my goal. To minimize liquid, I strained off the sausage liquid once browned and strained the beans. I also almost doubled the macaroni so as to absorb more liquid, but also provide a greater amount of pasta as I though 1/2 cup seemed like a very small amount. I also boiled the mixture at a little higher heat to ensure some of the excess liquid boiled off. The results was a perfect consistency and is best served in a pasta or soup bowl. The downside to not using ground beef was that the end results was quite piquant (which most of my dinner guests preferred). Next time I think I will cut the sausage volume down by 25%, double the cannellini and increase the amount of tomatoes by 50%. I'll consider throwing in a little balsamic vinegar for a little tang. My teenage daughter called this Italian chili - maybe so! Very, very flavorful - gourmet comfort food.

This is a staple winter food at our house and I have passed it on to many family and friends. I would recommend draining the fat after cooking the meat but other than that, the recipe is perfectly delicious!

I really enjoyed this. I used 2 cans of beans instead of pasta and used all Italian sausage and no ground beef. I also let it cook down a lot longer than the recipe indicates and added the spinach (about 10 oz) slowly at the end.

The family loved this one -- great fresh winter dish. Don't forget to spoon out most of the fat after browning the sausage!

I made this the day before I served it per recommendations, but it wasn't *great*. This dish is good, but not the fantastic flavor I expected from the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly: fresh basil, fresh romano, added extra garlic and still found the dish good, not great. I'd recommend doing only italian sausage and no ground beef, I think that would have kicked up the flavor. I should have seasoned a lot more before I served it, but really wanted to try the dish as written.

Use garbanzo beans (which I normally dislike). The texture and flavor are phenomenal. Don't worry if you don't have fresh basil--I use about 2 T of dry. You can season your own tomatoes, too. This is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and so comforting! Serve a salad and garlic bread, or just eat this alone. Wonderful flavor.

This was easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except right before I added the cheese, I added 3 tablespoons of butter. I would recomend this step to anyone- it helps the sauce come together nicely.

I made the receipe exactly as instructed and it was a real success, my family ate multiple bowls. The first night it was great with crusty bread and was pretty much a soup. The leftovers were more like a think stew and were 10 times better than the night before. Next time I will make this a day ahead of time, it's a keeper.

Very tasty and easy, great leftovers for weeknight meals. Lots of ingredients, but all stuff you can have in the pantry, except for fresh basil and spinach. I usually use parmesan, but liked the more pungent romano cheese here. Crusty bread is a great accompaniment.
