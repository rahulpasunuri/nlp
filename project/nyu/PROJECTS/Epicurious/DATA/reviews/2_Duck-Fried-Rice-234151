Forget everything but the tamirind sauce. It is outstanding. Great for dipping sauce for egg rolls, pot stickers, etc., as well as for chicken. Everyone loves it; one of my most asked for recipes. My asian grocery carries the candy.

Dull on first try. So tonight I bought fried rice from the local Chinese takeout, and added it to the duck, leeks, carrots, mushrooms, and pea sprouts. My guests loved it.

Went to five stores trying to find tamarind candy; wound up substituting Pad Thai sauce. Couldn't find pea shoots. Two of the three tasters liked the recipe, but I found it to be bland and thought the brown rice was rather heavy. Wouldn't make again.

The tamarind sauce is an excellent chicken marinade. I marinated boneless skinless pounded chicken breasts overnight and grilled. The flavor was subtle but very nice. My husband wants this chicken again.

This recipe was just fair and certainly not worth the labor. I found the candy in the Asian market and had I thought of it, I would have purchased roast duck at the same place. Since I didn't, I spent way too much money on a frozen cooked duck breast that was so mediocre I can't imagine anyone buying it. The sauce was delicious and I had a lot left over. The recipe says use the sauce over chicken or fish and I am going to try that out tonight. I am marinating chicken breast in the sauce and will grill them. I'll keep you posted.

This recipe is a pain in the neck. I looked for tamarind candy all over with no luck. Finally found a "Tangy Citrus Stir Fry Sauce" at 4.99 a jar. I looked for cooked duck all over. Finally found fresh boneless duck breasts on sale and cooked my own duck. And pea shoots? Forget it! Followed the recipe exactly except I used the "Tangy Stir Fry" sauce in place of the tamarind candy, and omitted the pea shoots, because they don't exist in my universe. Result? After all that work, the finished dish was underwhelming. I have plenty left over, if anyone wants a taste.
