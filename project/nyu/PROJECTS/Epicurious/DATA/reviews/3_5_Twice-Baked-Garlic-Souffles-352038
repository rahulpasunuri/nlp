It was good but if I were to make it again, I would whip the heavy cream and fold it into the souffle with the nutmeg and parmesan and bake it all. Why bake it a second time with the cream on the outside?

OMG are these fantastic. Had in my recipe box for months and then paired with the roast tenderloin with port sauce recipe on this site and a green salad. Outstanding mates and delicious satisfying dinner.

I found this dish relatively simple to prepare. Just measure/chop everything ahead of time and it's easy. We served it as an app for a dinner party for 6. Everyone loved it. Don't be shy with the garlic. The cream on top does make it flatten, but overall they came out well shaped and golden. Very savory dish. We made the souffles one day ahead. For another fantastic souffle, try "Goat Cheese Souffle" and serve them with a side of roasted beets. We served these for a dinner party and all 6 people loved them.

I love garlic. In fact, I wanted a recipe where there was a strong garlic flavor and this just wasn't it. That said, I also did something wrong because the souffle came out of the ramekins in many pieces and made a huge mess. Putting them all into a larger dish & covering with the cream sauce made for a slushy eggy dish. Obviously I did something wrong but even if I had done that part right, the garlic taste seemed very washed out. If anyone can point me to a garlic dish where I can use some incredibly delicious fresh garlic bought at the famous Saugerties Garlic Festival, please show me.

I really enjoyed the preparation. I used fresh garlic picked from my garden just before I made it. The second cooking instruction was a bit unclear as to whether the cream mixture should have been cooked down in the oven (they looked great coming out, but were wet from the cream making me think I should have cooked them longer than 10-15 minutes; or I added too much cream). The flavor was great. It presented very well. I used 1/2 C Creme Brulee bowls as the individual serving. I will definitly do the recipe again.

These were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Yes they took some time, but it was well worth it. I've made some pretty complicated desserts before, so this wasn't too tough. Prepping things ahead of time made it go more smoothly. I refrigerated them, took them to a party, poured the cream over and baked them there. They were devoured in less than 10 mins. ...will have to double the recipe next time.

I want to try this but I don't understand the re-heating directions. Help anyone?

Okay, here's the thing: this recipe will have you on your knees begging the kitchen gods for mercy when you're making it, but the outcome is well worth it. Can say as a very experienced cook that this is one of the most complicated things I've ever made. Just when you think you've gotten somewhere, there's another step, and then another... However, I will make it again. Guests were swooning. As the souffles were devoured, they were the topic of conversation for a good ten minutes or so as everyone wondered what was in them, how they were made, etc. Hunker down when you are seriously in the mood to cook, and make a batch. Then pop them in the freezer. The confit is very easy to make, and can also be done ahead. You will then have an elite level dish ready to go: all that's left is to thaw them, whip up the quick and easy cream sauce, bake, and garnish.

Wow...these were wonderful and oh so rich! I do have to admit that I ran out of time and therefore didn't bake them in cream. They were still great though.

Very good recipe. It is complicated and time consuming, That is a SOUFFLE I added a splash of cointreau for a little bit of citrus. Also you can add very small amounts of tarragon or dill if you like a fresh vibe that works well with seafood. The recipe is fine as is and invent as you see fit please dont be negative if you have never done the original recipe. Always do that first then make an adjustment. You may be surprised.

Actually, what you buy in your supermarket is what they refer to as "dried" garlic. They dry it in the sun to make it last longer. Here's a link with a good explanation of the difference: http://www.waitrose.com/food/cookingandrecipes/cookinglibraries/glossary/glossary.aspx?type=0&id=150

It says "makes 6 individual souffles" so you need 6 ramekins. 1 head of fresh garlic is what you buy in your local supermarket.

I would love to try this recipe, but I have no idea how many ramekins I'm supposed to be filling. Also, is the fresh garlic mentioned different from the garlic I can by at the store?
