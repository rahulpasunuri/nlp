This started out well enough, but when I took them out of the oven after 65 minutes, they were bubbling away, leaving me pretty worried that they were overcooked. (I was not watching them closely like I should have, just set the timer and watched Project Runway.) So, I was surprised when the texture actually came out smooth, creamy, and with a nice consistency. I understand that creme brulee is supposed to be a sweet dessert, but this recipe bordered on too sweet for me. Not sure if I'd make again, still looking for something that tops the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee on this site.

This was hands down the best creme brûlée I've ever had! I halved the recipe to make 4 instead of 8 and used ground coffee instead of beans. The caramel did get hard but I heated the cream and kept stirring until it melted, which was a pain but didn't' affect the flavor at all. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic. Perfectly smooth custard, with rich flavors. It's pretty sweet, but well-balanced and not "too sweet." I made a half-recipe, and filled seven 2-ounce ramekins. That is the perfect size, in my opinion, because it's 8-10 spoonfuls, and there is brulee in every bite. Plus, at Christmas, it's nice to have a smaller taste so you can have it with cookies! I can't wait to make this again.

Here is a great wine pairing with this- I had a 2006 Chateauneuf du Pape which was a bit peppery, and at the point in the meal when we had the Creme Brulee, it mellowed out the pepperiness and let the fruit shine thru! Highly recommend, may even want to try a Cabernet or spicy Merlot. The beefier the better! (Main course of bison steaks though, so a bit heavy). Cleansed palate with peppermint ice cream between courses. My second time to make this recipe. I love it and it is for special occasions, so am happy when we get to add it to the menu! First time I did the from scratch caramel, it was awesome, just labor intensive. This last time, I just used Nestle' Dulce con leche caramel and it actually turned out awesome and much easier. The only thing I would caution is the Dulce has agar which will likely change the texture some, but not really noticeable. Was still creamy!

Tasted great, but took way more time than I initially planned. Make sure when you add the cream to the sugar/water mixture that you are stirring like crazy, otherwise you will have a huge lump of caramel that will take forever to stir back in. My guests really liked it, just not sure I would go to the trouble of making the caramel again. I would make it again, but just not do the caramel part, increasing the sugar in the main part of the recipe.

In general, the recipe was pretty easy to follow, but it does require a little bit of skill and faith. I ended up overcooking my brulees, but they were still delicious. I steeped my cream with some crushed espresso beans and they had a delicious coffee flavor. I would definitely make again for a special occasion.

I made this exactly as the original recipe was written, and it was delicious - tasted like a caramel machiato creme brulee. It did take the full 75 minutes in my oven. The only thing I would do differently is when I poured the creme mixture into the ramekins, I would not let the foam go in also. This made 8 servings.

This was my first attempt at making Crème Brulee, so I followed the directions as suggested but using Crème Brulee dishes instead of the ramekins, so the end result were four dishes instead of eight. It took a bit longer to prepare than I anticipated, nevertheless, it was well worth the work  the texture was perfect and I used a culinary torch instead of the broiler, my daughter said it had too much of a coffee flavor, however she does not drink coffee, but I do and I think that it was muy bueno!

Oh my! Delicious. Did not change a thing. I happened to overcook them a bit but they still were wonderful.

240ml in a cup, 224 grams to a cup (28 grams = 1 fluid ounce, 8 ounces to a cup) and "c" should mean cup (always has when I've run across it)

totally easy, I freaked out when I poured the crean in and all of the sugar hardened then the sugar began to dissolve and it was great. Not too much coffee flavor like the other posts stated.I paired it with a nice orange muscat went perfect

Could someone tell me the measurements: how many ml in a cup and also how many grams in a cup please, usually, I think its 250 gms/mls in a cup but, it seems too much. Please help! Also, what is a 'c'. I live in Australia and I haven't heard of this type of measure. Thank you all

This was fabulous. I tried it a few times prior to serving it for a holiday meal. I was out of half and half so used a substitution of 1/3 skim milk to 2/3 cream (also can be 1/2 whole milk to 1/2 cream) for my first try. I found that the steeping of the beans, although tasty, wasn't worth the work. The second time, I had half and half, and found the texture was off. It was also slightly overcooked this time, so I wasn't sure if The half and half ws to blame or not. I also switched to instant coffee dissolced in the cream. The third time which was for the actual holiday and made for 10 people, I went back to the skim milk and cream substitution, Added instant espresso to the instant coffee (wasn't enough flavor in my previous try). Slight warning... the larger your recipe, the longer it will take to redisolve the caramel after you add the cream... next time I will try to add just a bit at a time to see if it can avoid the hard mass of caramel. Also the timing is very crucial. If you are planning on doing this for an occasion, try it a few days before first. I did larger dishes (my family is BIG on deserts) and increased the recipe significantly, so my timing won't work for others, but through my trials, I found that 4 or 5 minutes over or under can make a crucial difference. Even the difference in peoples ovens will change it. Test it first. This is VERY worth the effort. My sister has told me that she never wants another birthdays cake... from now on she wants this. Now I just have to figure out how to put on a candle without damaging the brulee crust. By the way.. I had never before made a creme brulee... my closest was a boxed mix for flan (which are NOT good) This recipe tastes just like a caramel cappuchino... move over Starbucks.

I am a big creme brulee fan and this is one of the best I have tasted/made. I prepared it for dessert last night and followed the recipe as given. Very tasty and very creamy/smooth. It is a little lighter than many other brulees due to the use of half and half I suspect. It was a winner all the way.

My first attempt at creme brulee and the result was excellent! The coffee and caramel flavors were perfect together and the texture was very creamy and decadent--restaurant quality. I made it as written and would do the same next time. My only hang-up was making the caramel--it turns from deep amber to burned smelling in a matter of seconds. I started over 3 times to get it perfect.I finally took the pan off the heat right before it was done to account for residual heat and added the cream right away to cool it fast. I didnt have a torch so I used the broiler with good results---but have since purchased a torch and cant wait to make it again!

I agree with the previous comment, this was way too sweet. I do like the flavors, however, and I plan on making it again with less sugar.

I made this for a friend's birthday. He LOVES creme caramel. Our guests are great cooks and pronounced it 'delicious'! I made it exactly as written, including steeping times and baking the creme caramels. It takes time to put it together, but the end is worth it. I did make it 2 days ahead,not one,and it kept very well. I will definitely make it again!

Really did NOT like this! WAY too sweet!also, after 40 mins I checked it and it had split, so i threw it out and started again, this time I only left it in for 30 minutes, it could have maybe done with another 5, the centre was a bit runny.

Good creme brulee. Texture was lovely. VERY strong coffee flavor, but not a huge caramel flavor. If that might be an issue for you, I would suggest either steeping the beans for a shorter period of time(10 min?) or using fewer beans to begin with. Also, this recipe does not suggest tempering the eggs -- I did so and had no problems. (Before adding the egg yolk mixture to the cream, add a small amount (1/2 c.) of the warm cream to the yolk mixture and mix. Then slowly add the eggs to the cream. If you add them too quickly you'll scramble the eggs.)
