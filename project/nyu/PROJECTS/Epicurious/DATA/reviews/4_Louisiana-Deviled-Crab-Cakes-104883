Made these last night and will definitely make them again! Fabulous! The "holy trinity" of Cajun and the delicious warmth of the Cayenne and mustard are perfect. Wouldn't change anything.

A successful dish for a New Year's Day brunch. Excellent base recipe with room for dabbling. I did a mash-up of this recipe, a similar one from Paula Deen and my own substitutions. For example: bell pepper and celery from this recipe and the mayo and scallions' tops and bottoms from Paula's. My substitutions: -- 1 tsp TJ's Garlic Aioli Mustard Sauce instead of dry mustard -- A few drops of Taste of Thai Chili Garlic Sauce for cayenne -- 1 tbsp Vegenaise for Sour Cream (Paula used regular mayo) -- TJ's Social Snackers crackers instead of saltines. Paula had suggested Ritz. Important: must pulse crackers in food processor and make ultra fine crumbs. I formed mini-size crab cakes (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and placed one side down in crumbs then turned over and coated other side of cake. I placed the cakes on sprayed foil-lined cookie sheets and put in refrigerator overnight. I baked them in preheated 400 degree oven about five minutes each side. To do over I'd re-spray the foil with non-stick spray or prepare a new sheet of foil before baking because some of the cakes stuck. And then I had to eat the sticky parts that got left behind. Hmmm... maybe I wouldn't change a thing!

I made these for my husband. He thought they were very tasty, but too spicy (even though I only used 1/4th tsp. cayenne) and not crabby enough. I'd make them again with less cayenne and more crab.

I just made these again, guess I do it about twice a year. Fantastic. I use panko and red peppers since I don't like green. It is very forgiving, I really don't measure much. Just eye ball it. Can't eat crab cakes at some national chains because I know how good ours are. Explore and have fun with it.

I love, love, love this recipe. I have made it several times since I first reviewed it last year and it remains a favorite. I really believe that using saltines is so much better than any other bread product. I tried panko and freshly made bread crumbs but the saltines add a bit of my Louisiana childhood that cannot be denied! Great recipe and very easy. I know the cakes are a little lousy-goosey but if you are patient and let the liquid absorb into the cracker crumbs, they will hold. Be gentle.

Good recipe for inspiration but extremely salty and maybe too spicy for some. My suggestion is to taste your mix before adding in your expensive crab. I'm glad I did as I started over got a mix that was good combo of salty, spicy, savory then added crab and fried up. End result was delicious and my house guests devoured them. I also used Panko and it worked great. Do NOT use a non-stick pan otherwise you will not get a good crust necessary to hold cakes together. Good luck.

The best! I use panko instead of saltines. I also found that refrigerating them for 30 minutes before cooking helps keep them intact. I've also used mayonnaise instead of sour cream with fine results.

Good flavor, but they absolutely fell apart on me. Tried more panko, then more egg, but nothing would help them form a patty that would hold up to frying, so baked them. A little too spicy for me, but my boyfriend loved them.

Rating: 3
Well, what didn't I do to this recipe? First, I used haddock. Then, plain bread crumbs. Then more bread crumbs because the mix was so hard to handle. Next, I spritzed each patty with oil and then baked them in a 400 over. Guess what? Still great! A little hot for my personal taste so I'll dial done the cayenne next time. It's like Tom Collicho says, cooking is about technique and this is a good one.

Tried this recipe for a personal shower and got rave reviews. Recipe held up very well in the 'fridge for a day (uncooked) as well as the leftover cakes themselves. I had to use a couple tablespoons of prepared brown mustard as I was out of the dry and the recipe still turned out very well. Used fresh chives rather than scallions too. Panko rather than Saltines was terrific! I do not think I will go back to my "old" crab cake recipe. This one is excellent!

These crab cakes are sublime! It has become an office ritual to have a birthday luncheon..there are only 6 employees. Our boss requested crab cakes for her birthday so I scoured all of my usual sources for recipes. After reading quite a few I decided on this crab cake recipe. Took advantage of some of the reviewer suggestions...fresh ingredients, panko crumbs, chilling the cakes. I also seared them as suggested and finished them off in the oven. Served them with a remoulade recipe from Food Network..awesome results! This recipe should lend itself well to other seafood options, I think I'll need to do some experimenting.

My mouth has been watering for crab cakes for about two weeks. I had seen something on television, and it spurred me to want to make them. This was my first ever attempt at crab cakes, but I wanted to make them and see how good they were in case I wanted to make them for guests. Absolutely delicious! I substituted mayo for the sour cream, and used white crab meat instead of lump. I also added imitation crabmeat as filler. I substituted cormflake crumbs for the saltines. I have passed this recipe out to all of my girlfirends, and told them they must try this recipe. Wonderful! It deserves 5 forks!

I have been looking for a deviled crab recipe and found this and loved it. Made it twice, once with leftover fish (combination of halibut and salmon) and both were well received. I used remoulade sauce when made with crab and basil aioli when I did as fish cakes. My husband was very pleased because I hadn't found a successful recipe for leftover fish and this worked out great. My grandma lived in NOLA back in the day and these take me home to her kitchen.

Several months ago, my wife developed a fondness for crab cakes. I've searched more than a hundred recipes, but this one she proclaimed "best ever." I substituted panko, but otherwise stuck to the recipe, and served them over the 'herb salad' recipe also found on this website (substituting sesame oil in the vinaigrette). These cakes have more breadcrumbs than other recipes, but they are wonderful & can be beautifully served.

I followed this recipe as written, with the exception of using Panko instead of traditional bread crumbs. I also refrigerated cakes for about 30 minutes. This made them much easier to handle. Delicious. I will definitely be making these again.Great for a hot summer night!

I am always experimenting with new recipes for crab cakes, but this has become a regular in the rotation. They have a nice kick and fresh taste. They definitely need to be chilled for a bit before cooking since they can be kind of soft and crumbly. Try these yummy little cakes!

Having Southern Blood running through my veins I was anxious to try a "Louisianna" recipe. These crab cakes are gerat! Living in PA, good, fresh crab cakes are hard to come by in restaurants... but these were excellent! This has been one of the few recipes my husband actually requests I make. I followed the recipe, using the Panko suggestion. This is a recipe I need to memorize!

I have tried so many crab cake recipes and none can even compare to how delicious this one is...my 3 year old daughter has been asking for them since she tried them last week. I substitued mayo for the sour cream and added less cayenne pepper. I also used red bell peppers instead of green. The panko suggestion was right on and gave the cakes a nice crunchy texture. My cakes did fall apart while attempting to put them in the pan and I will try refrigerating them for a while as also suggested. Only a minor inconvenience for such a delectable treat!

Rating: 4
I thank all who made suggestions on preparation and cooking. I found very helpful the following: refrigerate uncooked cakes for 30 minutes before frying, mayonaise substitution for sour cream, cayenne to taste and my favorite is Panko crumbs. I discovered that I could press together and form the cakes with a little more pressure. The ingredients are very forgiving for this process and the cakes remain light and airy. All who ate them enjoyed the Cajun "attitude" of the cakes.

I too must add how great this recipe is!!! I used the panko and halved the cayenne and it was really delicious.

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made. I've made it since it first came out in Gourmet and everyone who has it absolutely raves! They are better than restaurant crab cakes because they have so much real crab meat and the perfect balance of ingredients. After all this time, I have found that two things help to make this dish perfect every time: 1. Refrigerate the mixture for a half an hour to let it set before frying. 2. Use a cookie scoop with a spring release to make even sized cakes which also prevent your hands from becoming a doughy mess. I take a scoop of the mixture and drop it into a plate of cracker crumbs. I then add some crumbs to the top and then flatten them out into a cake with a spatula. Sounds pretty easy but it took me several tries to come up with this!

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Even good if you don't have certain ingredients. I made it without pepper, celery, and scallions. For a low-fat take, use miracle whip instead of sour cream and fat-free cooking sray instead of butter. In adition, I also used Ritz Crackers instead of Saltines. I served with tartar sauce. It came out great! My co-workers loved it so much, I made it twice for them in one week.

Used canned crab claw imported from the Philippines... couldn't detect a quality difference from fresh crab once the cakes were cooked. Didn't rinse the meat, just dumped the whole can in the bowl as is. Used panko as well. Very good, all around crab cake recipe.

Recipe sounds heavenly and am planning to try it soon. Question--if using canned crabmeat, should I rinse it or use it as is from the can.

A great recipe, but next time I'll add the cayenne 'to taste', as I felt that the heat overwhelmed the crab too much. I also used Panko in lieu of crackers & mayo rather than sour cream & I refrigerated the mix before making the cakes - as several other cooks had mentioned before me - all of which worked out very well. AND, I baked them at 375 for 30 mins. I greased a cookie sheet & plopped down a 1/2 cup of the mix, which was the perfect size!

Rating: 4
The Real Deal! The Key is using fresh ingredients and fresh crab. Assemble as directed (Panko breadcrumbs are great) and refrigerate on parchment paper for 15-20 minutes before cooking. This helps set up the crab cakes and infuse the spices. Quick 3 min. sear on both sides in skillet and finish in a 350 oven for 2 to 3 min. Do Not use a non-stick skillet for cooking the crab cakes. Excellent! Add choice of sauce for topping.

I had trouble getting the cakes to hold together with the recommended amount of cracker, but the end result was, so what if we have some leftover "crab hash", these are fantastic! Like many other reviewers, I have only had crabcakes this good once before. Wow.

This was delicious, and we had to use canned crab and cream crackers! We live on an island nation, and struggle to get good seafood, go figure. Saltines aren't readily available here, I could see Panko working very well. Really quite tasty, and easy enough for my 'I hate cooking' wife to prepare on her own. A note; following the recipe, they are not very spicy.

I made this last night for myself and my boyfriend; he said they were the second best crabcakes he's ever had (a high compliment coming from him). I subsituted red bell pepper for the celery since I didn't have any and I thought the color added a nice contrast to the dish. I also made a quick sauce of dijon mustard, mayo, lemon juice, and a little sugar which worked really well with the cakes. Delicious.

This was delicious and quick to make. I substituted mayonnaise only because I made this on the spur of the moment and didn't have the sour cream. Also, I reduced the cayenne and the salt to 1/2 t. each. 'The dish was still nice and spicy without being painful.

Good, but was actually a little bit disappointed in the spiciness after reading the reviews. I did double the recipe and based on other reviews did not double the cayenne but did add some Old Bay seasoning. For my taste next time I would need to up the seasonings.

I made two batches: one as written and one with panko as recommended. Panko is definitely the way to go, far more crab flavor and a nice little crunch when you bite into the cake. It's a little expensive, for everyday; but when I told my guests I couldn't afford to make these for a cocktail party, they brought cans of crabmeat and demanded that I make more cakes. How's that for a showstopper dish?

Also substituted panko crumbs and used imitation crab meat (fresh is quite expensive in Canada). Even with these substitutions the cakes were moist inside and crisp outside, and held their shape well. Browned in clarified butter and finished in the oven. Great served with a spicy remoulade sauce!

In all fairness to this recipe it may be that I simply am not a fan of crab cakes. I have had them in several different settings and my reaction has always been, "eh, they're ok". If you do like crab cakes this is probably a good recipe to try. I made it as written with a little less cayenne as I like to TASTE my food instead of feel it. Probably would be really good with a super sauce.

Looking for a departure from my usual favorite crab cake recipe last night (a standout from the Four Seasons in Boston), I prepared a double recipe of this for a quick dinner. We always keep a 1-lb. tin of Bird's Crab meat on hand. Very pleased with the result, with only a few minor adjustments. I prefer to use Panko breadcrumbs in lieu of the saltines, and also, lacking any fresh peppers , added some chopped roasted red peppers to the mixture. Also, despite doubling the recipe, I used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne - just enough punch to delight our palates. Served with a large mesclun salad, a dipping sauce of mayo mixed with romesco, and ginger peach iced-tea. Perfect for a balmy night.

Best crab cake recipe I've found - even better than what's in many restaurants around here! I did make a few substitutions--I replaced part of the green bell pepper with a little bit of red bell pepper (about half of the total), and I used red onion instead of white or yellow onion; and to finish I used bread crumbs instead of ground crackers (since I didn't have the crackers).

I have been making another crab cake recipe from a Williams-Sonoma cookbook that I thought was good. But this is OUTSTANDING! It's easy to make and tastes better than any crab cakes that I have ordered in a restaurant. The only change I made was to double the recipe and halve the amount of cayenne called for. It was perfectly complimented by an anchovy/chipotle mayonnaise.

We really enjoyed these I used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne and was glad I did, I just realized I left out the butter and they were still great. I baked them at 350, flipped them halfway, but couldn't tell you a time I just kept an eye on them. Can't wait to try again with the butter this time! I took advice of another reviewer and used Basil Aioli, and a remoulade we liked both.

Rating: 3
Very good! As fresh crabmeat is quite expensive in this part of the country, I substituted canned, and used a light hand with the dry mustard, cayenne and Worcestershire so as not to totally overwhelm the flavor of the crabmeat. Used Keebler Club crackers instead of saltines, as that was all I had on hand. Made the cakes silver dollar-sized and served with a blend of mayo and chili sauce alongside. With cheese biscuits and sweet potato chips alongside, these made for a great "finger food" meal. My five-year-old pronounced these "crabby patties" to be great!

These are absolutely wonderful. Just served them as our Easter appetizer along with sauce shown on this site for "Crab Cakes with Chipotle Sauce."

Have made these several times for numerous people with a a variety of palates and they never disappoint. You need to tinker with the cayenne to get just the right amount of heat.

What I haven't found is the perfect sauce to serve with these if preparing as an hors d'ouevre...anyone with ideas?

This was so easy to make, and so delicious! I used a little more crab than the recipe called for and I made a simple red pepper puree sauce to drizzle over the cakes for some color. Not too spicy for me, but those of you who fear too much heat may want to add a little less cayenne pepper. This will be among my favorite things to make.

These crab cakes are amazing!!! I served them for a birthday lunch to RAVE reviews. I doubled the recipe and threw in a little more crab than called for (using 1/2 lb. lump and about 3/4 lb backfin - i like it CRABBY!) and ended up with 14 smallish cakes. I recommend making more and making them smaller because they flip much easier than larger ones. I also shaped the cakes the night before I cooked them and I think this helped hold them together. This is the perfect blend of crab to other ingredients (of course I added extra crab) and the flavor is just phenomenal. Will DEFINITELY make these again. I want them again now!!!

These were wonderful! I halved the recipe since I was only making them for myself and still had enough for two meals (four large crab cakes in total). I used fresh breadcrumbs instead of the Saltines and nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and they still turned out flavorful and moist and held together very well. I am looking forward to making them again.

Gotta agree with the consensus, these are phenomenal... the spice combination makes them about five steps beyond the typical bland crab cake. The only change I made was adding a tad more saltines.... the mixture seemed too wet and didn't seem like it would hold together in the saute pan.

Now this recipe my Maryland born husband loved! Unlike the mini-crab cakes (made with, if you can believe, Cornflakes!) Probably because they were not trying to be a poor substitute for the real thing. These were spicy, the flavor was well blended so you could still taste the crab and had a great texture. I, like another reviewer, baked them on just a lightly oiled cookie sheet. The outsides were nice and crunchy with out all extra grease. You could also make these "mini" for party if you wanted to but I like them full size and could have easily eaten 2 or 3. Yummy!!

I made this for a dinner party-- doubled the recipe and used the full amount of cayenne. I used fat free sour cream and fat free saltines. The cakes didn't hold together very well-- make sure you let them cook for AT LEAST 4 minutes before you flip them-- if you flip them too soon you'll have scrambled crab cakes. Even so, they tasted great and were well worth the efort. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again.

These crab cakes turn out delicious without changing any of the ingredients. I made them for a crowd and only one person thought they were a little too hot with the cayenne. I love them just they way they are. **However, I send this question out to anyone who has made these: Do you know any tips on how to form them into cakes without making such a huge mess on your hands?? I find that the crackers get stuck to my hands and make a doughy mess which makes it hard to form the cakes.**

Very nice recipe - holds together so long as you have a light touch and use a good nonstick skillet. I changed it slightly by adding a little Old Bay Seasoning, substituting plain yoghurt for the sour cream, and panko for the saltines. Served with a remoulade sauce - very nice!

Based upon an earlier review, I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/4 t. but will probably try 1/2 t. next time.

Will make this one again - tonight in fact.

These were great. I used imitation crab and it worked very well in this dish. Also, I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp, and they were PLENTY spicy... I would recommend starting with this amount and then tasting it (after all you can always add more, but you can't subtract it once it's in there) and then adjust to your liking. I can't even imagine how spicy they would have been with the full 3/4 tsp. of cayenne (and I'm no wimp either -- I lived in Louisiana for ten years) but if great balls of fire is what you're looking for, then by all means...

I consider myself a crab cake "purist," as I only use a few simple ingredients to hold the crabmeat. But this looked so good, I couldn't resist trying it. I was glad that I did.

This was a wonderful dish. I doubled the recipe and made them into bite sized cakes to serve at a cocktail party. They were the only thing to be completely devoured.

This was such a hit. I cant wait to make it again!!!! Also, I added more cracker crumbs.
