Tasty cake - don't overbake. Frosting is delish and not overly sweet, though the recipe makes a lot. Personal preference though, I would cut the lemon in half. Definitely a do-again for my family!

I made the recipe exactly as described. I made the cake a day ahead and wrapped and bagged it. I have been advised not to refrigerate cakes because it causes drying (freezing is ok)so I left it bagged on counter top (uncut). Icing was also made the day before. This was a big hit with everyone. The icing is NOT too sweet which is often a problem with cream cheese icing. Also, there was just the right amount. The cake was not dry or hard to handle (be sure to watch the size of the eggs-need large). The spices were a good combination-I try to grind as many on the day of use to make sure they are not old. I am not sure why others had problems-easy and worked well for me.

This cake is really good, one of the best I've made. Although I did not have the frosting it still tasted amazing. It would defiantly work well as muffins too though.

I've made this cake both as a layer cake and as cupcakes and it was a crowd favorite both times. I don't agree that it's dry. If there's any complaint, it's that the frosting is super SWEET, I choose to deal with this by going more conservative when I frost it.

This cake gets a "good" rating because it is drier than I would have liked. It is surprising that this cake is even slightly dry, given the amount of wet ingredients. There are definitely better spice cake recipes out there.

This cake is too dry. Good as a coffee cake but doesn't compare to any other cake i've made

I would say that I would have to try to make this cake one more time to see if I can make the consistency better, but this cake is just not worth trying again. I'll have to consult with my favorite baking friend who trained with a famous french pastry chef, but I think this recipe is doomed. The recipe contained a myriad of spices that one would think would go together nicely, but there was no overwhelming deliciousness -- like gingerbread as an example, it was just white cake with a light back flavor - not the least bit distinctive or interesting. The layers did not rise nearly enough to be sliced horizontally -- I'm sure it was not my baking powder, or soda as I recently used both without issue. The frosting was also disappointing. It whipped up beautifully and looked the part, but again, there was a lack of intense flavor. And finally, on cutting the cake, the crumb was too small and did not hold together. The cake fell apart like flour. Did I sift my flour too much? I will have to consult with my baking friend. . . but regardless, this cake is off my to-do-again list. Too much time was invested in this flop.

This cake is incredibly easy to make and is quite delicious. It's a bit tricky applying chopped pecans on the side of the cake, but with a bit of practice, it will look stunning. I make this every Easter now and it's always a hit.

Moist, light and easy to make. I doubled this recipe to make 2 x 14 inch round cakes for a crowd. I didn't halve each layer and stuck to a two layer cake. I did not find the cake too fragile and had no problem assembling and frosting it ( I did omit the pecans). I would recommend making this cake the day before; leaving it at room temperature over night (covered, of course) allows the spice flavours to blend and develop. The cream cheese frosting was no different from myriad other cream- cheese frostings out there- my only complaint about it is that it required far more confectioners sugar than the recipe called for to reach spreading consistency. I would definetely make this cake again; if I was making it for a smaller, less varied crowd I would leave in the pecans and double the spices.

OMG this was goood! And even better the next day. I was paranoid with all the reviews and only baked for 25-28 minutes. That was too little and I had to put it back for another 10 mins - very moist. If you're using cake flour, as the recipe calls for, the recipe's time is fine. Also, you can put far more than 3/4 cup of icing on the layers. I ended up with lots of leftover frosting. DELICIOUS!

I live in Ecuador and couldn't get 2 things...pecans and all spice. So instead I used a little ground mice and pumkin spice and instead I used walnuts (baked with margerine).

To those that mentioned the lemon juice in the icing making no sense... in my own cream-cheese frosting recipe, I always use lemon juice (though not always zest) for 3 reasons: it brings out the tang of the cream-cheese, prevents the icing from being over-sweet, and it also helps to keep the frosting a bit thicker and easier to spread, as the acid reacts to the protein in the cream-cheese. If you want a super- creamy, totally non-grainy frosting, try this: instead of powdered sugar, add REGULAR cane sugar to the softened, room-temp cream cheese, a bit at a time, stirring with icing spatula or knife after each addition, until dissolved and to taste. (As you stir, the sugar WILL dissolve.) Once it has dissolved, add the butter, then flavoring & lemon juice. Let stand for a few minutes before using. You will have a VERY smooth and creamy frosting. It requires a bit more patience, but is worth the cleaner taste and improved texture. The one thing I had always detested about regular cream-cheese frosting was its cloying sweetness. Without having to rely on powdered sugar to thicken the frosting to spreading consistency, you can control the amount of sweetness in the frosting!

Tomorrow I will be making this cake for the fourth time, the third time my son has requested it for his birthday. It has always turned out moist and delicious. I either follow the recipe as written, or substitute all purpose flour, making the appropriate adjustments. Never failed!

I accidentally put Chinese Five Spice in instead of allspice, then I added the allspice as well but it was still delicious!

I made this recipe as written with one exception, I baked it a few minutes less as several reviewers stated their cakes were dry. My cake was very moist yet easy to split and everyone wanted seconds. There were also several reviews that commented on the use of lemon in the frosting for this cake as a negative....I thought the lemon added just the right touch of the unexpected and worked beautifully. Delicious!

Made this for a birthday cake for someone that is allergic to chocolate. It was really delicious. I used cake flour and it was not at all dry. The layers were firm and very easy to split and there is plenty of frosting to cover it all. It took a little time to assemble it all as I ground many of my own spices but everyone raved about it. I will definitely make it again.

To all the bakers who complained that this cake was too dry, please make sure that you don't make unacceptable substitutions, that is, substituting bread flour for cake flour. In this recipe the only acceptable flour substitute would be pastry flour as it has a low gluten count. If you used all-purpose flour, you would have had to "reduce" the amount of all- purpose by at least 1/4 cup, perhaps more. I don't use cake flour because the flour has been "chemically bleached" and as such is unhealthy. Additionally, you should always prep your pans, have your dry ingredients sifted and set aside, and your wet ingredients measured and at room temperature BEFORE you begin to assemble. The longer the time you allow for these details, the leavening ingredients will have exhausted themselves and will leave you with a drier cake.

For the cake recipe I added 3 whole eggs, even though it failed to say so. I also doubled the spices. I added a little nutmeg to the frosting, mainly for color and it was quite good. I do suggest cutting this cake into 4 layers so the cake stays moist.

Dry and boring and that is after I doubled the spices. I agree w/ the review that says the lemon makes no sense. There are WAY better cakes out there waiting to be made!

This dessert was such a huge hit with my whole family last night that I logged on first thing to review it. First, no need for 9x2" pans; standard 9x1.5" are fine. But I checked the cakes at 25 minutes and they were done. The presentation is impressive and the finished cake slices beautifully. Definitely 4 stars from a usually tough critic.

I made the last year, when the recipe came out, and was well pleased with the result. The frosting is worth 4 forks; I have used it since for cupcakes, it's yummy and not cloyingly sweet.

I made this cake for dessert on Easter. Cutting down the recommended baking time seems to have helped some with dryness issues. I would recommend this recipe if you want to serve a straightfoward, but not altogether exciting, cake.

I agree that the cake was too dry. The frosting made up for that a bit, but next time, I'll add some oil or buttermilk instead of sour cream.

no, no, no! While this cake is quite beautiful, you can get the exact same looking cake with the carrot cake recipe also on this website. This cake was dry, boring and the lemon in the cream cheese icing didn't make sense and didn't do anything or it. Don't waste your ingredients and your time on this one.

when I modified this for thanksgiving I added a cup and a half of pumpkin puree to solve the dryness problem. For the frosting I used orange zest and, juice instead of lemon for a softer taste. I think a little apple sauce would also make it moist and give an extra diminsion.

I cut the cooking time to exactly 29 minutes, before an inserted toothpick came out clean. It was not dry. With the four layers of frosting it was well balanced. I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole milk for a 1/2 cup of the sour cream.

Rating: 3
Careful...this cake, though lovely, can come out a little dry. I recommend adding a bit more sour cream than is suggested. Also, the lemon in the frosting was not an unanimous crowd pleaser. I will leave it out next time. Other than that, a lot of work, but well worth it.

I have NEVER baked a cake from scratch before, and these negative reviews had me really afraid to try! The photo so looked luscious that I ignored everyone & gave it a try. This cake was not just good, but incredible. Beginners luck? I did find that I enjoyed the cake more when it was cold.

I really wish I'd read everyone else's reviews before making this cake for my daughter's thirteenth birthday yesterday: the flavour of both the cake and the icing was lovely but the cake was terribly dry. I will make it again however I will shorten the baking time by at least five minutes and reduce the flour by 1/4 cup and substitute 1/2 cup of buttermilk for an equivalent amount of the sour cream. I might also add some raisins pre-soaked in a good bourbon, rum or Giffard's "Ginger of the Indies" Liqueur to attempt to remedy the extreme dryness. Better luck to my fellow bakers! Better luck to other bakers!

I adjusted the baking time to 28 minutes as suggested by a reviewer below to avoid producing a dry cake. I also added rum to the frosting, but do no think that it added anything to the taste. According to a friend of mine who has had spice cake for his last 30 birthdays, this was the best spice cake yet! I personally think that the triple layer carrot cake on this site offers a similar spicy taste, but is moister and more textured given the addition of fresh carrots.

This is a delicious cake - delicate spice, beautiful texture and yes, a little dry. After reading some other reviews describing the cake dry, I lowerd the temp in the oven by 25 degrees but then it took longer to bake. Loved the perfect frosting! I will bake this cake again and maybe try substituting buttermilk instead of sour cream.

I sent a piece to my neighbor who commented that this cake is "drop-dead-delicious"! It was one of the best I've made. It had the perfect blend of spices. The cake is not overly sweet, but is complemented by the sweet creaminess of the frosting. I found that when I was cooling the layers, the cakes cracked a bit too much, so I did not cut the layers in two, I just left it a two-layer cake as opposed to four. It still looked beautiful and impressive. I'm still dreaming about it!

I normally bake my cakes less than a recipe requires as my oven is little fast- it came out moist and delicious. I also turned the frosting up a notch by adding a Tablespoon of rum. I "eye-balled" the confectioner's sugar to make up for the extra liquid until I had the consistency I wanted.

This was was very tasty. After reading others reviews of the cake being dry, I was very careful monitoring the cake as it was cooking. I only cooked it about 25-28 minutes, not the time recommended. I inserted a toothpick in the middle and it came out clean. The cake came out moist and delicious. I really think that the recommended time to bake it is too long, that is why the cake is coming out dry. The frosting and nuts were delicious.

My husband LOVED this cake, but I just thought it was ok. Baked it in my convection oven, and I thought I had overbaked it, but the cake remained moist. I thought the frosting could have been a tad sweeter. The nuts were what made the cake.

My mother isn't known for her cooking skill, but when she remarked on the cover recipe and pilfered my magazine in order to make this cake herself, I was dubious about the outcome. No more! This cake is delicious; not overly heavy as a spice cake usually is, nor too dry or sweet. The icing was also wonderful. More importantly, my mom's baking skills are vindicated.
