Amazing! I cut down the cream to about 2/3 cup to have a more solid ganache. Very nice results. Premium chocolate is a must!

Great brownies! I didn't feel the need for the ganache, so skipped it. I think this is a case of "the better the quality of your ingredients = the better the finished product will be -- so bring out your better quality chocolate to use!!!

Great recipe! My husband is a chocoholic and he loved this, as did the other guests to whom I served it. Reading others' reports about the ganache not setting, I reduced the amount of cream to somewhere just shy of 2/3 c. I also let it cool before topping the brownies. Then I put it in the fridge. No problem with it running. I didn't have a metal 9 x 9 pan so I baked it in a 9" round metal cake pan and sliced the brownies into wedges after I presented the dessert to the guests. Terrific with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

These are delicious. Very uncomplicated for something that turns out so fancy. My only issue was that the ganache didn't really set all the way, even after leaving the pan on the steps for an hour in the middle of winter. That said, gooey chocolate isn't really a problem. I highly reccomend!

I've made these brownies time and time again. They are everything you ever wanted the perfect brownie to be: crispy on the edges, dense and chewy inside with that perfect crunch of walnut. The ganache takes it above and beyond the next level by added another dimension of creamy cholocately decadence. I hate when a classic recipe is botched and turned into some modern food that isn't good and isn't anything like the original. This is the best brownie I've ever had. My go to.

Very good, easy, quick to make and rich. I ran out of bittersweet, so added the 6 oz topping with semisweet chips. The ganache never hardened so they were a bit messy to eat. I like a crunch, but not nuts, so added raspberry swirl chocolate chips. It needs a bit more salt to balance it. Not the best brownie ever, but still good.

Excellent. Was worried they would be too sweet/rich, so cut in small cubes and they were a HIT. Only change? Used pecans since I didn't have walnuts.

These are GREAT! I've made them several times and they are so rich. Perfect bite of chocolate. Cut them in small squares!

I made these yesterday, and they are unbelievably insanely good. I made them with 64% Valrohna bittersweet chocolate. The best brownies I have ever made, hands down, bar none, without a doubt. This recipe will be my go-to from now on!

I've made them twice - both times they were a huge hit. In a word: decadent.

These are stupendous. I made the following changes: add 1 T. Chambord to brownie dough, and 1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam spread on top and cut in with a butter knife before baking. I also added a swig of chambord to ganache but that was probably irrelevant. I baked it in a 9x12" pan, so they were thinner (and more of them!) and the ganache was also thinner. It was about 1/4" thick and sufficiently rich that it could have been thinner yet; next time I'll only use 1/2 c. cream. But wow! these are really really good. I rarely find a brownie recipe that I like, but this gets 5 forks.

Best brownies ever. Kept them covered, in pan, overnight and then cut them up the next day. Came out of the pan easily and cut beautifully.

This is a stop-dead-in-your-tracks-take- no-prisoner brownie. Seriously, if you are looking for a show-stopper brownie, this is it. I would not hesitate to serve this as dessert for a dinner party. Easy and delicious. What could be better?

I made the recipe as it is written and thought the brownies were excellent. The only thing I did differently was to refrigerate the brownies to speed up the cooling time which worked out fine. The ganache set up perfectly. I've made many brownie recipes and I thought these were really fudgy and delicious.

I was not impressed with this. I have a giant sweet tooth and didn't fine the brownies sweet enough for me. The concept is good though.

These were delicious, but make sure you leave enough time. I was going to take these to a potluck, and the topping was still way too soft. My husband and I had to eat them all ourselves (over many days).

Great brownie recipe! I used a glass pan and reduced the heat 20 degrees. They were perfect at 26 minutes.

Decadent & delicious! What more could you ask for in a brownie? I cooked them in a convection toaster/oven, and they were done after 28 minutes. And I live at 7000', where baking can be problematic. To help counter the altitude I pre-heated the oven to 375, and then turned it down immediately to 350 when I put the brownies in. That might not be a bad idea for regular ovens/regular altitude if the brownies seem to need a tad more cooking time.

If you love chocolate, these are to die for. (I skipped the nuts.) I did have to cook them longer than directed though (5-7 min).

I'll make these again but will definitely bake them longer than the suggested baking time. I made the mistake of baking 28 min without checking for doneness and cooled, then poured ganache over after about 3 hours and let set for a few more hours. There was quite a bit of uncooked batter left in the center-I imagine another 5-10 minutes of baking would still have resulted in fudgy brownies without the loose uncooked batter in the center. My mistake. But either way, yum!

I am sure this recipe is good normally but I have a close friend with tons of allergies so I tried to make these vegan. Does anyone know if you use less vegan non hydrogenated margarine? It still seemed soupy after almost 45 minutes. I used egg re-placer as well which is tapioca powder mainly....
