I used Birrittella's fresh pizza dough to save time and couldnt imagine it being more delicious. I'll probably use more rosemary next time.

We were looking for a way to use up the last of 10 pounds of peaches and this was a perfect last recipe. I fussed with it a bit and loved the results. First, I rendered the prosciutto in a hot pan to crisp it up. After removing the prosciutto, I fired the peach slices in the same pan. After removing the peaches, I took some rosemary branches and smoked them in the same pan for just a few minutes. I chopped the rosemary and added it to the olive oil with a few cloves of chopped garlic. I brushed the dough (purchased at Trader Joe's with the rosemary garlic oil and then added the rest of the ingredients. The play between the salty-crispy prosciutto and the peaches was amazing and the goat cheese and herbs rounded out the flavoring well. I would make this again! I used Trader Joe's pizza dough

I like the concept more than the finished product. I just didn't feel there was any real depth of flavors in this dish.

I tried my best to ruin this recipe, but it still tasted great- fresh and light and tasty. I used refrigerated pizza crust, canned peaches, dried rosemary, Hillshire FArms brown sugar ham, but I did manage to spring for real goat cheese. Yummy and easty!

I used Trader Joe's pizza dough and canned peaches. Make sure to use the whole can--I didn't because I thought there were too many and I should have used them all. I also used about 1.5x the goat cheese.

Absolutely delicious recipe! If there are any recommendations I can think of, I'd say maybe a tad bit more of the rosemary and for a bit more of an herb-like push. But otherwise I've got nothign to say - TOP NOTCH RECIPE!

This is a good recipe. I offer a few thoughts based on several attempts: 1.) I highly recommend roasting the peaches before adding them to the pizza. 2.) Substitutions such as apricots for the peaches, or thyme in lieu of the rosemary work well 3.) Our preference is to make the pizza on the grill, using either a pizza stone or a perforated pizza pan 4.) I personally prefer the pizza without the red onions, but it doesn't surprise me that several disagree. Enjoy.

Delicious! I made this for my supper club as an appetizer. I used pre-made crust to save time and cut out with biscuit cutter for appetizer portion. Rosemary was fabulous with the goat cheese and peaches. I added thinly sliced red onion as other reviewers suggested - great addition - I will continue to make it with red onion. Will be even better with my homemade pizza dough, but worked well with pre-made if you need to same time.

I agree that this is really great. I used pre-made crust and more goat cheese than was called for - I loved the combination of flavours!

Delicious! I first spread a layer of goat cheese and then prosciutto, peaches, sliced red onion and rosemary. I used a purchased pizza dough to cut time. Great flavor -- I will definitely make this again. Pretty enough for company.

Layered prosciutto and fanned fresh peaches on top, like a tart. Used a ready made crust and cooked on the BBQ. Elegant looking and DELICIOUS! Will definately do again!

This is a delicious recipe. Each ingredient comes through, and they combine beautifully. I don't have a baker's peel, which would have been nice because it's a little tricky getting the pizzas off a surface and onto the pizza stone, since the toppings are so heavy. Also, I saved some of the dough and made a pizza later with pizza sauce and mozarella--not nearly as delicious as the peaches, et al. So, I think this dough recipe is particularly suited to the indicated toppings.

We thought it was yummy, and the friends we made it for actually said it was the best piza they'd ever had!

This pizza is so delicious! I added the red onion and thyme as suggested by other cooks. I also cheated a bit and used ready-made pizza crust as well as canned peaches (drained, rinsed and cut into thinner pieces). It was still wonderful and even better, faster to make.

Maybe it was me, but I expected the flavors to dance off the pie crust......lol. I must admit, I did use a ready made dough and peaches from a can. Maybe, that made the difference. This pizza was tasty, but I was not bowled over by the flavors. Hopefully, other pizza recipes from this site will get my more of my attention.

The flavor combination of this pizza is terrific! The peaches almost melt into sauce while baking, making a perfect summer dish.

I wasn't sure before trying this recipe, but it was wonderful. The different flavors combined just beautifully. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added some thinly sliced red onion and a bit of thyme. The peaches, goat cheese and prosciutto would make a wonderful grilled panini on rosemary bread, too.

I am an assistant manager at one of the top 50 independant pizzerias in the US. (Pizza a Fetta) I got an idea for one of our pies based on this yummy recipie. I added red onions and almonds to the pie and thyme as additional seasoning to bring out the flavor of the fruit. It worked wonderfully. Thanks for the great idea!

This is so easy and very fresh tasting. I used a basic pizza dough recipe that I had in the freezer and added more peaches. Very yummy!

The flavors blended so nicely together. I'd definately make it again!

Terrific combination of flavors. Has become a standby and we make it with store-bought dough and have even donie it once with canned peaches!

This is a FABULOUS combination that would not normally have jumped out at me from the magazine, but I recently discovered peaches roasted with rosemary in a restaurant (Emma in San Francisco's San Remo Hotel -- highly recommended!). I made this as a larger single pizza with a slightly different crust recipe. Don't skimp on the prosciutto: it will more than cover the pizza, but it shrinks when it cooks. A light touch with the goat cheese and rosemary will keep the peaches from being overpowered. Served it with a side wilted spinach & toasted pine nuts, which provided a good contrasting earthy-bitter flavor.
