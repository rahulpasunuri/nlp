I made only the scallop part and served it as an entrée alongside roasted sweet potatoes and a green salad with cucumbers. So easy and delicious! We found ourselves sopping up the glaze with the sweet potatoes  great combination! The only change I made was to substitute coconut oil for the butter, and I used only half as much oil altogether.

Never made the celery salad but this is one of my favorite ways to make scallops. It's pretty fast/easy and has a nice balance of spicy and sweet. I've served it over pureed celery root and that's very good.

We made this dish for the first time last night and loved it!!! It is so light and fresh and the flavors compliment each other really well. We did change the red pepper for a cup of cherry tomotoes which we halved and we added some olive oil to apple cider vinegar dressing, other than that we followed the recipe as it is here. This has been added to our favorites and we will be serving it to our friends when they come to dinner next weekend.

This recipe is a winner. I had no lime peel, so I just used 4 tsp. of lemon peel. I used 1 teaspoon of sambal ulek for the hot chili sauce, but I think it might be too strong for company, so in the future I will only use 1/2 tsp. 1/2 tsp. I substituted Oliva for the butter and olive oil, and it was still delicious!

This is fabulous. Easy, quick, and really delicious. I didn't have celery, so substituted red onion in the salad and then skipped the chives. Yum. Great for a dinner party. You can prep most of it in advance.

Fast easy and fresh. Had leftover glaze and will try it with chicken breast. Don't be afraid of the hot chili sauce. I will add more next time because it's really not that spicy in the glaze.

Fantastic! I was wary of the ingredient mix but the butter brings together the sweet/hot/citrus beautifully, so as not to overpower the scallops. I forgot the garlic and would probably skip it next time it was so good. Used Mexican chili sauce for the spice. Very simple, quick recipe, easy to prep ahead and then takes less than 5 minutes when ready to dine (great for entertaining).

Excellent! Used 1/2 of sriracha & plenty tasty. On another occasion, substituted chicken for scallops and still excellent!

This was very tasty made a perfect appetizer portion for four people. For the salad I substituted a spicy vinegarette for the apple cider vinegar - this complimented the glaze on the scallops. I served them in individual sized scallop-shaped baking dishes. Wow - the presentation was as good as the taste. This is a keeper!
