This was amazing and a hit at our Pasta Fest last night! I proofed the yeast for 15 minutes - 5 didn't seem long enough. I also added the herbs (thyme, rosemary & oregano) to the dough while mixing it. I was lazy and didn't want the flour clean up, so I added more flour to the bowl and kneaded it in the bowl. Then after letting it rise, I halved it, putting it in 2 10" baking pans and spread it around the pan with my fingers. It worked perfectly and no mess! Before baking, I added fresh tomato & Parmesan to one and Parmesan & fresh cracked pepper to the other. This is a great foundation recipe that I will definitely make again.

This is a great focaccia. Rather than two 13x9, I make one loaf in a 15x10 cookie sheet. Also, I add thyme, rosemary and a couple cloves of crushed garlic during the initial knead in the mixer. Top with parm, salt and pepper and plenty of olive oil just before baking. Comes out golden and delicious everytime. Perfect for spagetti dinner or for sandwiches.

I fully agree with treeshar (post on 6/12/11). It was fine for a focaccia-like bread, and it was made quickly, but the bread itself was really insipid. It didn't matter how much olive oil, salt, and rosemary/parmesan/thyme I put on top- the bread taste itself was flat. Have made it twice now and followed the recipe exactly. I will be looking on Epi for better recipes.

This is pretty so-so. It's fine for an easy home baked focaccia, but it just isn't the complex aromatic focaccia that you find in very good restaurants and bakeries. I followed the recipe exactly for the thyme loaf, and made a rosemary loaf instead of the parm. Both were meh. I think something with a preferment or sourdough starter would be orders of magnitude better even if more time consuming.

Made the Parmesan focaccia only. Used bread machine at dough setting, substituting 1/2 of flour w/bread flour. Rolled out dough and refrigerated to bake just prior to guests arriving (smell of fresh bread can't be beat). Returned bread to room temp and let rise (took about 3 hours) and continued recipe as written. It is amazing and simple.

This was my first attempt at focaccia and it turned out great! I had a bunch of fresh herbs to use so I made both loaves with thyme, rosemary, and sage and topped both with parmesan cheese. I served it with lasagna and salad, but it was also great to use for sandwiches during the week!

I made a half recipe, preparing the parmesan focaccia only. The great thing about this recipe is how quickly you can produce a really nice pan of focaccia. Very tender. I only sprinkled with pepper (no salt); the parmesan is plenty salty.

This was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S and I say "was delicious" as it didn't last longer than a few hours after coming out of the oven. Everyone devoured this and was immediately asking me to make another one which I am doing right now. I studded the top of the focaccia with basil, sliced tomatoes, roasted garlic, parmesan and a good drizzle of olive oil. I may also try a variation with bacon, green onions and cheddar. Great base bread recipe.

Oh my word! I'm holding on to a fluffy, crisp piping hot corner of bread even as I type. I'm always nervous when I make bread - but this recipe is easy to follow and gets the job done beautifully! I studded one with tomatoes and basil and the other with olives and sundried tomato. Divine!

Absolutely marvelous recipe. Very much like the focaccia we baked at an Italian bistro in Seattle. I omitted the thyme, batched the whole recipe together, topped it with chopped sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and parsley, and then baked it in a 16-inch paella pan. The result was a perfect focaccia round that could be sliced through the middle (creating top and bottom halves) and cut into wedges for Panini sandwiches.

I never seem to have the right touch for making bread, but this was easy and excellent. I halved the recipe and baked it on a pizza stone. It was nice and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Try topping it with carmelized onions, roasted garlic and parmesan. Sensational right out of the oven, and for making sandwiches.

I'm a pretty regular bread baker, but I'm not the biggest fan of focaccia. Needing some bread in the house in a hurry, I decided to make some anyway and I went with this recipe. I was quite impressed. I didn't have any fresh thyme on hand, so I substituted the same amount of herbs de provence. For the other loaf I used shaved parmesan (with a vegetable peeler) instead of grating it since I prefer the appearance and density of shaved parm over grated for pretty much anything. I also kneaded most of the cheese into the dough and sprinkled some on top before baking. The parmesan one was good but nothing special. I use a lot of thyme in my cooking and I'm sure that would have been good but I strongly recommend trying out herbs de provence in this recipe if you want something a little more complex. The fragrance and flavor were just amazing. (For those of you in NY, I used Fresh Direct's proprietary HdP blend).

Made 1/2 the recipe, omitted the sugar and substituted the parm and thyme with garlic and rosemary. It wasn't the most beautiful creation, but the flavor was fantastic and the moistness and texture were wonderful. Even my husband, who grew up in Italy, said it was fabulous! I've tried other focaccia recipes and they've always turned out less than stellar - this one is my new go-to recipe and it's soooo easy, too.

I used Herbs de Provence as a topping, simply to use up some of that expensive jar, and the result was delightful.

Delicious, great every time. I add carmelized onions and garlic ( 1 large onion, 3 cloves garlic) to the wet mixture, makes the bread extra moist, and use rosemary instead of thyme, and put parmesan on top. Always rave reviews.

I thought this focaccia was great--one of the better ones I've made. And, for some reason, it seemed easier than others. I made the parmesean bread and mixed the cheese in while kneading. It turned out great. I froze the other half, so I'll try topping it per the instructions, with cheese, to see which I like better. Definitely a winner.

sooooo good! first of all, i halved the recipe thinking i only wanted 1 loaf, and then halfway through i realized that it was 1 parmesan and 1 thyme bread, not 1 bread with both things. well, i made it with both things anyway and it was GREAT! the dough was so sticky, that it worried me but i added quite a bit of extra flour during the kneading. baked it with lots of parm on top and it was fab. next time i want to add some sundried tomatoes to the top!

Results were good, but nothing outstanding. But if I want a quick & easy recipe, I'd definitely bake again.

Very good! Next time I will add a bit more salt and parmesan. I sliced fresh garden tomatoes and baked on top. Fresh mozarella would probably be yummy.

This recipe was straightforward and pretty much "fail-proof". People, don't panick and automatically add more flour to the mix if the dough seems sticky after the first kneading. Simply flour your board moderately and knead in enough flour until you reach the desired consistency. To ensure the proper rise, remember to check the expiration date on your jar of yeast and replace if needed, (I did)! Used both fresh thyme and oregano from my garden. Baked the entire batch on a 18 x 13 sheet pan. Used the focaccia for the Tuscan-style Grilled Chicken Sandwich, with a side of Pasta Salad w/ Mozzarella, Sun-dried Tomatoes and Olives (both on this site also). Wonderful summer meal served with a ice cold Pellegrino.

Great recipe and open for variations. I use this constantly as a base and wing the herbs, etc. to experiment. I don't think I've ever stuck strickly to the recipe. :) The focaccia makes a great pizza and a superb twist on any sandwich.

Have made this about 10 times now, it's easy and delicious!!! Great texture, fine with dried herbs as well. Am putting this on my top ten list for best reliable discoveries for 2002.

Very good, I thought, the parmesan was outstanding. I simply used the wrong pan for the thyme so it wasn't as crispy-crusted. Next time I'll just bake them on a cookie sheet or side by side in a large jelly-roll pan. I'll skip the thyme next time and punch it up a little with tomatoes/olives or the like. I definitely used more than 6 cups of flour...too sticky at 5.5 cups. enjoy!

Great focaccia recipe. I've tried many including the one I used while cooking in an Italian restaurant and this one is near perfect.

Can I give this a ZERO???? I raised my eyebrow at 1/3 cup of oil but used it anyhow. I thought this was soooo doughy and gummy. I usually make focaccia with just yeast salt flour water then just before it goes into the oven I brush extra virgen olive oil on the top and sprinkle with coarse salt fresh ground pepper and herbs then bake. Thought I'd try a "real recipe" I am sticking with my own inventions

A great recipe! The dough, which you will need to adjust as to amount of flour, is smooth and supple. The bread is fragrant and golden. I used both Parmesan and fresh herbs; next time I will liberally top it with the traditional olive oil.

I was very unsure how this recipe would turn out. I was not sure how much flour to add during the kneading process, but I think the recipe is fairly forgiving. The result was fabulous. I am going to try either the olives or the sundried tomatoes next time. I had a question for the reader who added sundried tomatoes. Did you use dried sundried tomatoes or the ones packed in oil?

I just made half a recipe--one loaf--of the parmesan, but added sundried tomatoes and kalamata olives pressed into the dough. Marvelous! Took it to a potluck, and it disappeared before the brownies--lots of people took seconds.

This bread is excellent, even if you use dried oregano in place of the thyme. Be aware that the parmesan can get too brown in the oven, so I sometimes add it after baking the bread a bit.

I´ve baked this bread several times and it always turns out divine! Just a suggestion: as with every yeast-based bread, the water´s temperature is very important for it to turn out fluffy, so make sure your water is NOT boiling (just warm) when you combine it with the yeast...I served it filled with gorgonzola cheese, roasted bell peppers and black olives...mmmm good!

I didn't have a heavy-duty mixer, so I made the dough completely by hand. When baking, it browned too quickly on the bottom and left the top not quite golden in most places. But it had a great flavor, so I gave it new life as a pizza crust. I wasn't planning to make it again, but my husband (who had the thyme focaccia topped with his favorite combination of pepperoni and pineapple) said, "This is great pizza. When are you going to make it again?"

I recommend using fresh herbs! I had dried and it still turned out quite well, even the kids enjoyed it.

I've made this several times now, first to serve with herb infused olive oil and then as pizza crust. I mixed the parmasan and italian herbs to taste in with the flour then shaped into personal size pizza crusts and baked as directed. When ready to make a pizza or two simply top and put under the broiler for 7 min. or so (If using sausage, make sure it is pre cooked- besides being safer you get rid of a lot of fat.) The kids love making the pizzas themselves and everyone gets what they want.

I liked this bread alot. It filled the house with a fragant aroma of thyme and parmesan. It had a wonderful flavor
