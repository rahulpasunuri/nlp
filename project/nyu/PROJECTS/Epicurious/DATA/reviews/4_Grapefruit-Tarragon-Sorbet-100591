Fabulous! Love the grapefruit tarragon combination. Used 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, might use a little more next time. Didn't freeze as well as many sorbets, but did freeze.

This is a lovely sorbet! The grapefruit and tarragon complement each other perfectly. We had it after buffalo burgers and it proved to be a perfect and refreshing end to the meal.This is a keeper!(though probably will make in double batches as it's quite small.)

I didn't have any tarragon on hand but I desperately needed to use thE grapefruits that were accumulating so I made this anyway and used a bay leaf instead. Absolutely delicious!

Like others, I agree that this was really exceptional. I used dried tarragon. I think if I was to have used fresh, I wouldn't have boiled it (this reconstitutes the dry), but just added it before putting it into the ice cream maker. I did put the mixture in the refrigerator to cool as I do with all ice creams and sorbets, so that it freezes well in the ice cream maker.

This Was So Good! Used fresh pink grapefruit. After freezing put in blender and texture was perfect! Will make again.

Delicious and light. I used a few stalks of fresh tarragon in the syrup but wish I'd used more. Maybe chopping them up would have allowed more of the tarragon flavor to seep in. It didn't freeze after an entire cycle in the ice cream maker so I just froze it in covered plastic containers and then scraped it up using a large spoon to make it the right consistency for sorbet, left it in the freezer and it was perfect when time to serve.

WOW, this is a great recipe. Four forks. The sorbet is very light and refreshing. I made it for our tea group the "Bag Ladies" on 1/28/06. Two of the Bag Ladies are diabetic so I used Splenda. Everyone loved it! I highly recommend this recipe for tea and light refreshments. Bag Lady having fun with food in Iowa.

This was a wonderful palate cleanser during our annual 13 course New Year's Eve dinner. The grapefruit that I had was rather tart, so I added sugar to taste. The tarragon adds a wonderful complexity to the sorbet,however I used fresh tarragon as a garnish, and found that the two fresh flavors together were so outstanding that I will try adding more fresh tarragon, and less dried next time. This was a hug hit, and our guests ate the leftovers for with breakfast the next morning!

Very good and easy -- used dried tarragon since market was out of fresh and used bottled "fresh squuezed" juice; some guests didn't care for the flavor combination but it did the job of palate cleansing!! refreshing as a between course and recommended.

Like others, I did not make the candied strips, rather solely the sorbet. I also doubled the recipe. Several comments: 1.) I used a generous amount of fresh tarragon. I thought this flavor was a marvelous addition to grapefruit 2.) I found it difficult to achieve our preferred consistency, despite the sorbet spending abundant time in the ice-cream maker. There's simply too much liquid in this recipe 3.) I'm always suspicious of sorbets without a few tablespoons of lite corn syrup, which provides a velvety mouth-feel. Several tbsps of corn syrup would have helped. 4.) Despite my qualms, this was served to roughly 20 people who thought it most-refreshing on a midJune evening. Enjoy.

Loved this. Did not make the candied grapefruit but it was really tasty and refreshing. I even used 1/2 Splenda instead of sugar and the sugar users did not even know.

Easy and elegant. My husband requested a grapefruit sorbet for Valentine's Day, so I made this one and it was an instant hit. He says it's a definite repeater. Very refreshing and satisfying. This is a more sensible way to end a meal than a heavy fat laden pie or cake. I'm making it agian tonight for my dinner guests. I'm sure they'll enjoy it.

This sorbet is awesome. I prepared the liquid the day before to allow the flavors to infuse. I have no doubt this will be a big hit with my guests this evening.

I have made this sorbet many, many times. It is even better if you use fresh tarragon (lots). I just chop the tarragon, add it to the simmering sugar base, steep, then sieve out the tarragon. I use pink grapefruits, and just a tiny drop of red food coloring; garnish with tarragon springs and serve with small cookies. (I have even "cheated" and used freshly squeezed juice from the supermarket, and it turned out fabulous.) I find that people appreciate having something light like this for dessert, as opposed to heavy pies, cakes, etc.

Quick, easy and very good. I also just froze it, stirring it occasionally. I served between courses.

I used this as a palate cleanser between lobster and veal loin. The flavors were absolutely wonderful together and intrigued the guests. I will definitely make this again. By the way, my ice cream maker didn't freeze it well enough so I just put it in the freezer and mixed it a few times - more like a granita, but marvelous nevertheless.

A friend and I had this sorbet as a palate-cleanser for Christmas Eve dinner. Exquisite and unusual flavor! Added an incomparable accent to a lovely meal.

This was easy and was a big hit. The tarragon was an interesting twist. I served it in the empty half grapefruit and it looked great. I skipped the candied grapefruit stuff.
