A real favorite. Sometimes I increase the amount of shallots, and I always start with 12 oz crimini mushrooms. Calvados Brandy adds a nice depth of flavor.

I made this to bring to Pinot Noir wine tasting party, and it was the best accompaniment at the party, with just a crumb left. It does take quite a bit of time to put it together, between the crust, the mushrooms, and chopping fresh herbs (rosemary/thyme). I have another recipe for a mushroom tart which uses only porcini mushrooms (no cremini), with beef broth and red onions, which has a richer mushroom taste, but this was a close second.

This was absolutely delicious - it lived up to the hype in the reviews. Very "mushroomy," simple, and tasty! It disappeared off an hors d'oeuvres spread with a lot of other great food. If I make it again for this type of party I'd use a rectangular tart pan and cut into thin slices.

Perfect AS IS ..do not change anything...you will be happy. Used herb mixture suggested by other...Rosemary and Thyme. I sometime enhance after the first test.but this needs NO improvement

This is fabulous AS WRITTEN...used herbs suggested by others, Rosemary and Thyme. I sometimes look to enhance recipes after trying once...not this ..just perfect and all guest agree. Enjoy

Rich, delicious, savory. If you don't have dried porcinis, don't worry about it. I used shitaki and crimini which worked really well. I probably used a 1/2 cup of cheese on the crust and about 1/3-1/2 cup of cheese on the top. Perfect.

I made this as an appetizer, and used mini filo cups. It was good, but a lot more work than necessary for a yummy mushroom appetizer. Also, the custard overwhelmed/cooked over the top of most of the fill cups, so it wasn't very attractive. Next time, if I used this as a base for an appetizer, I would just sauté the mushrooms with the aromatics and add a bit of heavy cream, then after cooling would add shredded cheese before filling the cups. Having said that, I will definitely make the actual full sized tart, as the flavors here were wonderful.

I didn't have the porcini mushrooms so I had to wing that portion of the recipe, but it turned out well regardless of that exclusion. I think I would reduce the amount of Gruyere and possibly increase the custard mixture next time to give the other flavors in the tart a better chance to stand up to such a strong cheese. I'll definitely make this again.

This was really good though took a bit of time. Really rich and flavorful. Made as written except I don't like eggs, so made custard with milk, cheese and flour. making it for the third time today.

There are severalother Wild Mushroom tarts on this site and other but THIS one is outstanding. Make exactly as stated and use fresh rosemary and thyme as suggested. Doesn't get better than this. I have friends asking me to make it over and over. The BEST every time.

This got rave reviews. I used a mix of fresh chanterelles and crimini. I subbed about 5oz of the chanterelles for the dried porcini. Rosemary and thyme were excellent in the tart. I cooked the crust for about 25 minutes to golden but still needed to pop back in the oven once the pie weights were out to cook the bottom more (another 10).

I made this as an experiment for a vegetarian Thanksgiving dish. It is so beautiful and delicate. Chunks of mushrooms stick up above the nutty Gruyere custard. It will be a hit with your friends and family!

Insanely good. My dinner guests were very happy with this one. I did have to blind bake the crust about 10 minutes longer than the recipe indicates before it turned golden brown.

I must add my vote, this is great and like many other I made just as written. For herbs used rosemary and thyme also. Perfect in every way..tecture, flavor, uniqueness. I've served as lunch with salad, along side cold salads on a buffet at room tempurture and enoyed the few leftovers (not often). You'll be happy you made this.

I made this last night for a first course with small amount of greens on the side. Excellent. The flavors were outstanding. As other, I used rosemary and thyme. Couldn't ask for a better result. Would make again for lunch or light dinner with salad. Make vegetarian friends very happy. Also, made as written,no changes..used crimini. Will slice them thinner next time. Having leftovers for dinner tonight.

Dang it, this is a winner! I double up on the mushrooms and cheese....both of which you can never have enough.

Bake small phyllo pastry cups and add the mixture and bake. For herbs, I used rosemary and thyme. Put grated gruyere on the bottom of the cup, add the mushroom mixture, and top with more cheese.Serve at room temperature as an appetizer over butter lettuce with a very light dressing (I used a cherry balsamic vinegar drizzled over the lettuce.) My guests wanted more :-)

sounds good, I'll try with dried cepes, shitake and portobello. Sub truffle oil for butter and use phyllo dough.

Absolutely divine! Made no changes to the recipe, and like most other reviewers went with 2 (heaping) tbsps of very finely chopped rosemary and thyme- perfect! Remembered to butter and lightly flour the tart pan, the tart came out without a problem. Served as a starter for six, unfortunately for me no leftovers!!

LOVED this recipe. Although I would forgot to butter my tart pan ahead of time and so could not remove it from the pan. The herbs I used were some leftover rosemary, thyme and basil - it came out wonderfully!

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe ever since I first saw it in Gourmet over 10 years ago. It is always a big hit - rich and earthy. I prefer the tart to have more filling so I double the crimini mushrooms and double or tripple the porcini. Also it is very important that all the liquid be absorbed or cooked out of the mushrooms, so take your time. I find that this takes much more than the 3 minutes noted in the recipe. If you do not cook all of this liquid out the tart will be soupy and will not set properly. If you don't have fresh herbs available a nice dash of herbs de province (added at the same time as the porcini liquid to give them time to hydrate) works very well.

Rating: 4
For hors d'oeuvres--use pre-made phyllo dough cups from your market. I pre-bake the cups for a few minutes so they don't get soggy, fill them, pop them in the oven. Voila! Perfection. I have also used a varety of mushooms. The onions, cheese and mushrooms make a lot of room for play. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Very simple and very flavorful dish. I was pressed for time and used a pre-made crust. Although the crust wasn't bad, I will make my own in the future. I used fresh thyme and rosemary as the herbs. Wondering how fresh marjoram and blewits would work the next time? My wife and her best friend raved about it. Leftovers were finished by noon the next day. I used a more aged Gruyère which added a stronger and nuttier flavor. Excellent!

This was great. I used this filling but used the pastry from Leek & Pancetta Tartlets on this site and made in mini muffin pans for a New Years hors d'ouvres. My husband loved them. Couldn't really taste the cheese so I think it could be left out. Am planning to try freezing a batch.

I follow the recipe to the T, and used a disposable foil round cake tin instead of a tart pan. After the tart cooled, I inverted a plate over it and flipped. It came out perfectly. I took the tart to a candle party, and it was a hit. I really couldn't taste the cheese, so I think it would be safe to omit it. I used fresh crimini and dried porcinis, so the flavor was very mushroomy, and very custard like. I especially liked the fresh rosemary and the sweetness the cognac added. There was a lot of depth to the flavors, the crust came out flaky. This is a great recipe. If I make it again (it's a bit pricey), I would cut the butter in half as my tart was just on the edge of being greasy (I had an open stick of butter, so I used about 6.5 tbls.). Had this with a zinfadel sangria, which complimented it well.

I liked (but not loved) this but my boyfriend was less of a fan. Changes: Pastry: increased water to at least 1/4 c 2) did not fold over edges to double as I don't like thick crust 1) rinsed porcini multiple times 2) used scant 7 oz. loose mushies (instead of 10) and was plenty mushroomy 3) replaced shallot with 1 leek on hand (nice) 4) 3 T brandy 5) for herbs used 1.5 T rosemary -next time try 1 T rosemary + 1 T thyme 6) for cheese used 1/3 c gruyere + 1/3 c emmenthaler - next time use a tiny bit less cheese as well as milk instead of cream 7) only used 2/3 c of reserved mush water. 8) reduced til almost no liquid at all Would be good served with strong flavored meat.

Delicious! I've made this a number of times, and it never disappoints. I use thyme and rosemary for the herbs, and often use swiss emanthal--much cheaper. I've also used this method of preparing the mushrooms to make a mushroom risotto, which was very good.

Tart was delicous. I didn't have congnac on hand, so used sherry instead. Used fresh ake s instead of porcini. I used less butter and sauteed some minced shallots, green onions and garlic together prior to adding . Also used half and half instead of cream

I made this for brunch when we had overnight guests and it got rave reviews! I used a mix of wild mushrooms that included shitake, crimini and oyster, plus the dried porcini. Definitely follow other reviewers advice and rinse those porcini several times. The leftovers were just as good the next day. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Have made this many, many times already. I've found that the Gruyere overpowers the delicate flavor of any exotic mushrooms, so I always use buttons and save the fancy ones for dishes you can taste them in. Works as a brunch entree and as an appetizer for dinner. Rave reviews from guests, including my in-laws, who are notoriously suspicioius of anything remotely unfamiliar. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
Blissfully good--easy to make, and a sensory treat from the heady aromas as the mushrooms saute to the wonderfully complex flavors of the finished product. And gorgeous to boot. Try leaving it in the oven a little longer than you'd think till the cheese on top is nicely browned and you'll get the consistency you like, be sure too to cook the mushrooms down till almost no liquid is left after adding the porcini broth. Rinse the porcinis in a couple extra changes of water as suggested(only save the first one)to get out all the grit, don't be afraid to squeeze them out, the little guys are tough when re-hydrated. Serve to your very best friends!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe twice now--both times to rave reviews (including at Thanksgiving as a main course for vegetarians). Once I skipped the Cognac because I didn't have it on hand. Definitely use it if you have it, as the Cognac adds a depth to the flavor. I've increased the Gruyere cheese and used a mix of mushrooms. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
very good-I have made a couple times and always tastes good. I use only thyme as the "fresh herb" and emmental swiss instead of gruyere to cut back on the price but the sharp flavor is still there. Does anyone know what the final consistency is supposed to be like? In my mind, if it tastes good, who cares! But I was just curious...my consistency is always not as firm as like a quiche kind of mushy....hmmmm...

I have made many, many recipes found on this site, and this is one of the best! I served it for Christmas dinner with beef tenderloin and stuffed tomatoes, and it was spectacular. Guests called later and asked for the recipe. I have to admit that I cheated and used Pillsbury pie crust, as they make a better product than I have ever been able to (must be the lard.) Otherwise, the recipe is a bit lax about cleaning the porcini. I have found that it is usually necessary to rinse the reconstituted porcini in up to three changes of water to get rid of the grit that clings to them. It is also a good idea to pour the soaking liquid through a strainer lined with two paper towels to catch suspended grit that doesn't all stay in the bottom of the bowl. It would be terrible to have this terrific tart be ruined by renegade grit, which is a lesson about porcini mushrooms I learned the hard way.

This recipe results in a restaurant-quality product! It was absolutely delicious, though a bit more quiche-like than I was expecting (not a problem if you're a quiche lover like me though). I did use shitakes and criminis, as well as some reconstituted morels because I didn't have porcinis on hand, but I think almost any earthy-flavored mushrooms would work just as well. Also had to increase the baking time by about 3-4 minutes. One more thing: it's worth it to make the crust instead of using a frozen one. But either way it's guaranteed to impress.

MMM! My husband made this, an herb-crusted tenderloin, and molten chocolate cakes (both reviewed on epi as well) for my birthday, and aah, this was so wonderful. I think the leftovers were even better than the original, as I sink into it a second time. We used the porcinis, 6 oz of crimini, and 4 of shiitake, and they all tasted superb. Get the porcinis if you can (Melissa's at Super Wal-Mart was our brand and place). Their broth is an amazing aromatic contributor. We added some sage to the crust to give it a little more zip, and it was great. As for herbs, we went a little untraditional and did dill weed, chives, and a tiny bit of tarragon--tiny. They were beautifully captured in the filling. The inlaws, after getting a sample the next day, wanted an entire one for themselves. Make extra--it goes fast!!!

Not for the skim-milk, non fat crowd that is for sure. When asked "What is in it?", the answer is -whatever it takes. This tart is outstanding. I served three of these tarts at the large dinner party and it vanished within 5 minutes. I believe "devoured" is the proper word. I added little bit of balsamic roasted onions and served it with a light mushroom lemon sauce and some mushrooms and greens as garnish. Summary: Another hearty ol'french recipe worth all the time and effort.
