This pork was wonderful. We served it with a pinot noir and the pairing was superb. I decided to make both the flan and the marmalade that was suggested. The marmalade was wonderful and added a great deal to the dish. The flan was not as big a hit. No one could figure out why it was on the plate. I have had better tasting corn flans as well. Next time I plan to serve it with a wide rice noodle.

I used similar substitutions as Toronto, and I did make the corn flan (aka bread pudding) and the marmalade. I can't imagine the pork without these beautiful additions. The combination of flavors work harmoniously and really set this dish apart. I used a 9lb bone-in pork butt, steamed for 5 hours...heavenly! Every one of my 14 guests agreed. I served an Asian Napa Cabbage slaw to accompany. A good time was had by all.

All right then, if you insist, I'll be first. But let me lay my cards on the table. I did not use pork belly (I'm pretty convinced Susur Lee has better access to this than I do) and I didn't manage to find dried tangerine peel. OK, I didn't try. I used a 4-lb pork shoulder, and a strip of fresh tangerine peel, and Japanese sake. I know the substitution police will visit me in the night, but that's the way it is. (Did *you* make this recipe?) When I finally have kitchen staff, I will make the corn flan and marmalade. As it happens, I steamed some rice and corn kernels and mixed in some chopped coriander, and flavored with a bit of dark sesame oil. If you're still with me after these caveats, this pork was delicious. Be sure to use the dark soy (not, for example, health-food store shoyu or tamari). And do the steaming thing - it creates a melting, succulent texture. I used a stainless steel bowl over a stockpot. Leftovers rule.
