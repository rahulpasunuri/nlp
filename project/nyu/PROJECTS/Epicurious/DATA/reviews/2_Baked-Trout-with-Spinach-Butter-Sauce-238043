Not very tasty. Kind of flavorness. Would not make it again.

The fish was fine. The sauce was too heavy (and I consider fat a food group) and flavorless. There are many better recipes out there.

I made this as part of a St. Patty's day dinner (for those vegetarians that didn't eat the corned beef) and it was spectacular. There wasn't that much juice from the fish to add to the sauce so I just added some broth. The sauce sounds very heavy but you just need a little to sprinkle over the fish and it's perfect. Don't overcook the fish and you will have one of the best fish dinner's ever. Super easy too.
