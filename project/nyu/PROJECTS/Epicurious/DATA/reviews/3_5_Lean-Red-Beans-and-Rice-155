It was pretty good. I used parts of other recipes that I think perked it up. I used beer instead of water, added cumin and oregano and used chicken andouille.

I made a quick and easy vegetarian version. I used canned beans with some extra water, substituted veggie sausage, and added chopped, roasted sweet potatoes. It was very tasty!

I made this as written and loved it. I have also made it subbing smoked sausage or kielbasa for the smoked pork and we really loved it. I always make it with brown rice. Great weeknight meal!

Easy and scrumptious. I also make a vegetarian version of this dish, leaving out the pork and sausage and adding lots of cumin, which works really well.

I make this recipe on a fairly regular basis. I'm sure there are better red beans and rice recipes out there, but this one stands out because it's relatively healthy, which is important for every night cooking. We serve it with brown rice, which tastes great. It lends itself well to spice experimentation, and I usually add something different every time I make it. It also freezes well.

I cut this recipe in half and didn't exactly make it "lean." I substituted the 6 oz. boneless smoked pork chops with 2 ham hocks. But, for the andouille sausage, I substituted spicy andouille chicken sausage. I added lots of extra cayenne and it was so yummy and spicy. I will definitely make this again!

I give this recipe four forks because it's healthy, supremely easy, and tastes terrific. My only deviation is that I use smoked ham hock sections (one or two) in place of the pork chops. Perfect for cold weekend afternoons--you can put this on the stove with minimal effort and let it simmer most of the afternoon, and it makes the house smell inviting too!

I used brown rice to increase the healthful nature of the dish. It was really good. I did use some chopped onion and cucumber with which to garnish the servings. Two questions...When using the andouille sausage does the nutrition information remain the same...ie, 5 gms. fat?...Does the nutritional information include the rice?

creole is a more refined "fancier" cooking, more city syle, cajun is a more rustic "country cooking"

Pretty good! I substituted a a large, meaty ham hock for the pork chops, and instead of the thyme and cayenne, used 1T of Emeril's creole seasoning. I topped it with something I learned from a friend from Louisiana: finely grated and squeezed cucumber, sliced scallion tops, vinegar and a pinch of salt. Stir together & refrigerate, and top hot beans and rice with a dollop. It really "finishes" it. By the way, as a novice to southern cooking, can someone please tell me the difference between (don't laugh) Creole and Cajun? Thanks.
