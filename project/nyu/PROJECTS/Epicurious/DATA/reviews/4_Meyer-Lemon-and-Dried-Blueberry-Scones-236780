4 forks seems an understatement in this case. These scones are by far the best ones I've ever made and the easiest as well. First time I followed recipe to,the letter, second time I used half bluebs and half dried cherries and they were amazing both ways.

I've made this recipe a couple times now. I always just make my own self rising flour and I use fresh blueberries. Always turns out amazing. They look nicer if you bake them in a round and then cut apart after it's baked.

Thx for the tip on turning regular flour in to self rising. It worked great. I thought these scones were delicious. Mine only needed 20minutes. Keep an eye on them!

This was an easy recipe. After reading other reviewers' comments about the amount of flour called for, I "tweeked" it for my use: In addition to using all the zest from one whole Meyer Lemon (the ones on my tree are Huge, so that's about 2 Tbs), I also substituted the buttermilk with "sour cream": The seeded segments of the Meyer Lemon placed in a 1 C. measure and enough whipping cream to equal 1 C. of liquid. This was added to the flour mixture in the processor and pulsed several times until it all started to come together. I followed the rest of the instructions from there. I did also trade blueberries for cranberries as I had those on hand. My family really liked these.

Followed the recipe as is and had no problems. These were fantastic! Used Meyer lemons and dried cranberries - delicious.

Oh my goodness, are these ever good! And so easy! My first time making scones, and I don't see the need to try any other recipes. As other reviewers suggested, I increased the lemon zest to 2 Tbsp., used regular flour plus 4.5 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt, and baked 20 min. As other reviewers noted, the dough is alarmingly dry at first, but once you knead it it's fine.

These were wonderful! Great suggestion from reviewers below on only baking for 20 minutes. Dough did seem overly dry at first, but kneading brought it together. Scones were crisp on the outside, flaky on the inside. Got rave reviews from my family. Will definitely make again!

Made this spur of the moment after buying some Meyer Lemons. I put maybe 1/2 again as much zest into the mix because we love lemon in this family. These were easy easy especially since I used the food processor to handle the dough. Very tasty!

Love this easy recipe. I mixed the dry ingredients and cut up the butter the night before, so I further decreased my morning prep time. I was skeptical that these would turn out ok, since the dough seemed REALLY dry--like there was flour that wouldn't mix in--but once I folded it a few times per the recipe's instructions, it came together fine. My discerning friends were delighted with the scones' light texture. I used regular lemons, rounded my measurement for the lemon zest as others suggested, and didn't have buttermilk so I mixed 1 tablespoon lemon juice in 1 cup milk and let sit while I mixed the butter into the dry ingredients. Having made these with dried regular and dried wild blueberries, I will say the smaller berries are preferable because you get more evenly dispersed berry flavor (and, just to be clear, I don't normally care for "mini" anything").

I love scones and couldn't wait to try this recipe. Unfortunatelly, the results were awful. I wonder if the amout of flour should been 2 cups instead of 3. My scone came out extremely dry and I would be very resitant to try the recipe again until I know for sure that the mesurements called for are correct.

Dear To Whom it may Concern, This morning while waiting for a 8:45 train, my friend enjoyed a lovely blueberry scone from Starbucks and I question whether this friend, who is in fact my dear wife (our anniversary is in October), would be able to use this recipe to replicate those scones found at starbucks. Thanks.

ok, so the reason this recipe turns out so flat is that it only contains baking powder (in the self rising flour) and ANYTIME a recipe contains an acid like buttermilk it needs baking soda. Who was this recipe writer, certainly not a professional,

I was super excited to make these scones per the reviews and my first time ever making scones. I'm going wedding dress shopping tomorrow morning and heading out in the AM and wanted a little treat to give to the Mom's and my friends. I am my own toughest critic, but I think they are a tad dry (had to sample one)- and lacked any hints of lemon- even though I added more as other reviewers had advised. Maybe I over kneaded? The cooking time should definitely fall on the shorter side vs. longer. 21 minutes was a tad long- I think 20 is more accurate. Dependent upon my tasting audiences reviews I may make some adjustments.

Rating: 4
These were delicious! I made a few adjustments:fresh bluberries, doubled the lemon as recommended by another reviewer, adjusted the flour since I didn't have self rising flour, and cut the baking time to 20 minutes. All the changes were on point, except for the lemon. I hardly tasted the lemon, but my husband said he would prefer less lemon to let the blueberry taste really shine, which makes sense. Next time I won't add as much. Nevertheless, these were easy to make even without the self rising flour and will become a family staple, I'm sure.

Excellent but I did change things up a bit. I did not have Self Rising flour so I used all purpose but added in 4.75 tsp baking powder and 3/4 tsp salt to make my own self rising flour ;) I also like things to be more lemony so instead of just 1.5 Tbsp of zest I used the zest from an entire lemon, in my case it was closer to 2 Tbsp I didn't measure. I also used a bit of the lemon juice from the lemon (about 1 Tbsp) to give it a slightly more intense lemon kick and about 1/4 tsp of lemon extract as well, to the wet ingredients. End result was delicious, light and airy with a distinct but not overpowering lemon flavour. I use a variety of different fruits in this (dried cranberries/cherries etc) but also have it with no fruit at all as just a stand alone lemon scone ... One of my favourite recipes.

The scones were absolutely perfect. They were picture perfect and not too sweet-just the way I like them. I did skip the sugar on top though and brushed them with honey for a little touch.

Delicious, quite possible my favorite scone recipe. The scones were light and fluffy and had just the right amount of sweetness. I has fresh blueberries on hand so I used those. The scones were still good, but I will try it with dried fruit in the future.

Great recipe! I made them with fresh blueberries and they were yummy. Will try again with other fruit.

I've made these scones twice in the last week. The first time I used frozen blueberries (as some reviewers also did) and the second time I used the dried ones as the recipe indicates. While they were delicious both times, their appearance was more attractive with the dried blueberries (they kept their shape and browned better), and the texture was more scone-like -- crusty outside with a flaky center. The frozen blueberries made the dough wetter and resulted in a more muffin-like scone that also spread more when baked, so they ran into each other a bit in the pan. I really liked these scones and will make them again, but my favorite recipe is still the Cinnamon, Pecan and Currant Cream Scones which is also on Epicurious - although they use less butter they are so flaky and buttery!

Rating: 4
Absolutely fab! I think I overcooked a little as they were a little dry, but I should have read review below first...they were still delicious. Can't wait to make again but I will cook fro a little less time. They had rave reviews from those who ate them at my house!

Super easy and amazing. I make scones regularly and this is the best recipe I've come across. The full recipe does make a lot of scones. I've made both the full and half recipes with no problem. People commented on how "picture perfect" they are and how good they taste. I pulse the dry ingredients and the butter in the food processor instead of by hand. I then mix the dry and wet in large bowl to get most of the loose flour incorporated. Then I kneed on a cutting board.

I used fresh blueberries and chopped up some "lemon essence" prunes (by Sunsweet) with a fantastic result. Cook 15-20 minutes only. The 26 minute stated baking time on this recipe is too long.

These were fantastic. The following formula for self-rising flour worked perfectly: 1 cup all purpose flour with 1 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt.

Delicious! I made the scones with fresh blueberries and the scones turned out fantastic. Not dry and very crispy on the edges. Cooking time was about 20 min. I made the scones with white whole wheat flour + 1 1/2 baking soda per cup of flour + 1/8 salt per cup of flour.

Fantastic! Super easy and quick, and my husband loved them. I made them exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent recipe, easy to make. I questioned the lack of baking soda in the recipe, but clearly it was not necessary. They rose beatifully, and were tender and flaky. I did not brush with milk/sugar before baking, but did glaze them right out of the oven with lemon juice/powdered sugar mixture.

My first time making scones and these proved themselves fool-proof, despite the fact that I forgot to add the dried blueberries and had to take my scones off the sheet to remix them in and reform and recut. They came out fantastic anyway. I made my self-rising flour using 1-1/2 tsp baking powder per cup of flour, plus 1/2 tsp of salt in total. Then I remeasured my flour and used the rest to flour my work surface as needed. Loved these and plan to make again with other dried fruit and citrus combos.

Used fresh blueberries instead of dried. These scones were delicious. Next time I will add more lemon zest.

I hate to be one of those reviewers who writes about a recipe while subbing ingredients, BUT, with that caveat, I made these with currants instead of blueberries and salted butter instead of unsalted and with the regular lemon peel variation, and they were banging. we even burned the bottoms on one pan of them, and they were fine. we just lopped off the burned part and ate anyway and they were great. so easy and delicious. possibly a little toooo easy -- I am not sure I want such ready access to scones this good.

Very easy, very good; I made with cranberries instead of blueberries. I mixed my own self-rising flour (for every cup, add 1+1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt) and they tasted a bit salty, but I think this is probably my fault. Also, I did these as lumps rather than cut disks.

Rating: 4
Fabulous. I cannot wait to use lemons from my mom's tree. If you cannot find blueberries... cranberries, apricots, or other dried fruits work well. Absolutely follow the directions on placement in the oven. The first time I made them the bottoms overcooked because the rack was too low.

These are wonderful scones!!! I make them pretty often. I will regularly sub. orange zest for the lemon if I don't have one in the house. I have also found that lowering temp. and cooking time is better. Great with Lemon Curd!

My husband and I didn't care for these. Seemed like way too many blueberries, and the overall taste was dry and bland.

Rating: 4
These are the best! I make them gluten-free and nobody can tell. I use my own AP flour mix, plus 1.5t Salt and 4.5t Baking Powder, and I decrease the butter slightly to 11T. Also really good is 7oz chopped dry mission figs (about 1.25C), 1/2C chopped walnuts, and replace 1/3 Cup of the buttermilk with honey (for flavor, not as a sweetener). Add 1/2t. Allspice to the dry ingredients and follow the rest of the recipe as written. I've also tried dried organic mango, unsweeteded coconut, margarine and coconut milk for a dairy-free client. The texture is very slightly different, but the flavor is also a keeper.

Easy and very tasty. Here's a recipe for self-rising flour from about.com website (halved for this recipe): 3 cups of flour, 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder, 1/2 tablespoon salt. Either sift together or mix with a wire whisk until well combined.

This is one of the better scone recipies I have tried, and I'll definitely make them again. The texture is perfect, the lemon and blueberry go together well (I used a regular lemon), and the buttermilk glaze gives the outside an appealing crustiness. Like the other reviewer, I don't keep self-rising flour on hand, so added baking powder to all-pupose flour. I also added about a half-teaspoon salt. I think the flavor may have been a little flat without that.

I have made this recipe twice and will continue to so. Although, I make a few substitutions- I use orange zest instead of the meyer lemon and fresh blueberries. I recently served this as part of brunch. It worked out well and everyone seemed to love them.

Very good! I don't keep self-rising flour around, so I used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder per cup of all-purpose flour (for a total of 4 1/2 tsp for the recipe). It worked out fine.
