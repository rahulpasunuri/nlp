I have not been able to eat this yet because it is STILL cooking after 4 and 1/2 hours! I use a lot of epicurious recipes because it seems that the quality control is very high, but not in this case. Braising at 300 would take far too many hours. After 2 hours in my Meile oven set to convection Roast and a copper roasting pan, it was barely cooked. It certainly did not fit the definition of braised, meaning that it is succulent and falling off the bone. So I put it in an ADDITIONAL 2 hours and it is barely loosening. Now I have increased the temperature to 350 on convection and maybe, just MAYBE we will eat tonight. Someone really missed the mark with this one. I will write later and let you know how it tastes but I am not holding much hope given that the simple braising instructions are so woefully off.

this recipe is excellant. My sister unexpectantly dropped in when I was making it and loved it. When she came back she specifically requested that I make it again. There were 5 of us and everyone loved it (including owner of 4 star restaurant).

We REALLY like braised duck legs, but this recipe did absolutely nothing for us. This took a lot of time, and there are A LOT better duck leg recipes out there.
