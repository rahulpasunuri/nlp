I'm not the most experienced cook out there by any means, and I did not find these difficult to make at all. Just keep your eyes on them like you should with anything that you're frying in this manner. They're going to cook fairly quickly, but at the same time, I had them frying for more than thirty seconds on each side like the recipe suggests. Also, they're fried. Obviously they'll make you sick if you eat too much! Just because they have kale inside doesn't make them good for you.

I didn't try this recipe but just reading it kind of made me laugh. It's combine the two extemes of the health spectrum. It's like a really desperate attempt to get people to eat a vegetable.

No need to let the batter sit for an hour if you don't use a cold beer. It turned out pretty well, and was tasty but as my husband put it, it's "just an excuse to eat fried batter." Makes a lot of batter, BTW, I used the rest to fry up some shrimp. If you don't have a suitable thermometer, dip the corner of a piece of stale bread in the oil; if it "fizzes" the oil is hot enough.

I had to add another review since if you buy a very cheap thermometer to fry at the correct temperature, which you should own in order to fry things well anyway, this recipe was quite tasty and definitely deserves a try. Squeeze some lemon over the leaves before serving.

Kids! Please don't try this at home! Do it professionally! It's soooo greasy and hard to control the temperature of the oil, the kale leaf gets burned so easily! the batter is very tasty and compliments the kale lovely, but it's really just too too greasy. i had about 5, and i feel sick!
