This salad was a major hit. I would only cut the amount of oil used.

I don't think this works as watermelon is mean't to be, well, watery. I give it a big yucko.

This recipe was just published in the July, 2011 issue of Bon Appetit. I was a little hesitant to grill watermelon, but the taste is both unique and delicious. I was unable to find watercress, so I substituted arugula. The peppery taste combined well with the queso fresco and pumpkins seeds. The pickled radishes were tart and unusual and I used a mandolin to create matchstick pieces. This salad is delicious and presents beautifully. I did chill the cut and trimmed watermelon pieces on individual salad plates. This is a definite keeper!!!
