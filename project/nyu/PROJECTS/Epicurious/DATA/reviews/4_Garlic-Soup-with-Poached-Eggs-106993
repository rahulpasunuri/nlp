Yummmmm.. This has become one of my go-to comfort recipes, as I almost always have homemade chicken stock and leftover sliced baguettes in the freezer. I like to use lots of garlic and let it cook in the stock a good long time over low heat, with a parmesan heel thrown in if i have one. When ready I toast the bread in a hot cast iron skillet with a bit of oil until brown and crunchy. Then I crack the egg in the soup bowl over the toast and cover with the hot hot broth, as the egg cooks the toast soaks up the broth. Break up the egg and grind some pepper. Mmmmm... Use good bread and good broth!

I think this is essentially Portuguese bread soup from the Alentejo region of Portugal. Made this while my husband and I are fighting colds as suggested by the other reviewers and they were right on the money. It was perfect. Easy enough for a sick person to make and so restorative. We'll probsbly be having this for dinner tomorrow night too.

I made this based on the rave reviews and was let down. The soup itself was so bland. You're better off just making yourself a poached egg and toast. Skip the garlic soup.

This soup is easy and delicious enough to make once a week all winter. We love it as written, although we've made it a few times with bouillon, which is fine (broth is better). The recipe serves two people (not four) as a main course. The bread is amazing once it soaks up broth, and the gooey egg yolk is key. All the ingredients work together so well.

This is THE soup to have when it's cold outside/you're not feeling so great. The garlic and the heat make your throat feel good, the hot pepper cleans out your sinuses...it's great. I made with veg stock, and I think it really needs the chicken flavor. The poached eggs were great, also sneaky protein. I loved the baguette at the bottom of the bowl - I made extra pieces to re-drown. I think this could use maybe a little bit of vinegar or something to add zip.

This was wonderful on a rainy night (while fighting a cold). Doubled the garlic and used fresh chilis and YUM.

Very simple, surprisingly good and rather filling. It took no time to make which was a real plus. I served the garlic toast on the side as suggested by others. I also make one and a half times the recipe to serve four and that was a good choice as there was none left. I broke the yolk of the poached egg in my bowl, and it changed the broth to a nice golden opaque. I also added a squeeze of a lime slice to my bowl and I loved the acidity that brightest it added. My husband and friends really enjoyed.

I used 4 heads of green garlic sliced thin instead of mature cloves.. wonderful.

I came home late and hungry, so looked in my fridge then searched epicurious for a dish with the ingredients I had. Found this and whipped it up in a matter of minutes. Delicious, comfort food, totally hit the spot! Didn't have lime so used lemon, and no cilantro. Vegetarian, so used veggie broth. Definitely a keeper!

Wow!! I was only persuaded to make this because of the reviews: frankly, "garlic soup"- and poached egg??- just didn't sound like it would do much for me. I just made this and am still feeling wonderful: I think this is a true restorative! And right: no way does this make four servings- I'd do 1.5 times all of this.

Absolutely delicious. Took about 10% as long as I thought it would to slice that whole head of garlic, so don't be deterred! I also added some poached and shredded chicken to make it a full meal.

So quick and easy. I skipped the toasting step and just put out some hearty bread to dip. I added a handful of shitake's I had lying around and went light on the red pepper flakes (it was still plenty hot.) Simple, quick, and delicious. Just the thing for a cold evening. And if you felt a cold coming on, I'd bet this would chase it away pretty quick. Oh, and the poached eggs make this meal. Don't skip them.

i cut the recipe in half, since i was only making it for two, then wished i hadn't! used homemade garlic olive oil for an added layer of garlic . also followed other reviewers' suggestion to serve toasts on the side, rather than in the broth. fantastic flavors! can't wait to make this again!!

So easy to make and so yummy. I agree with reviewer who said it was too spicy. I like spicy food, but the peppers were a littl overbearing here. Cilantro is a must - it make the dish so much better! Used brioche instead of baguette, which was delicious.

Awesome soup! great with a grilled sandwich or salad. The bread was very tasty, should have left it out of the soup though for dipping. Made only for two, we ate almost all of it and dipped the extra bread slices into the soup. Didn't use the lime.

Eating this soup was the highlight of my weekend. I added extra garlic -- thinly sliced about half a head and then plunked a whole head of garlic into the pot as well, with only the very tops of the cloves sliced off. I added a sliced up potato and didn't bother with toasting the bread and all that... this a beautiful, simple recipe, and the combination of garlic and poached eggs is not to be missed.

Really nice simple garlic soup - I didn't find the lime added much, but the cilantro was great. Waaaay too spicy though... I'm sensitive to spicy, but my boyfriend isn't especially, and we both were sort of choking on it. We'll make it again with less red pepper to really enjoy it.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it exceeded my expectations. Its cheap, healthy, and uses things that I ususally keep around the kitchen. I splurged on the cage-free eggs and omitted the lime. Garnishing with cilantro and fresh parmesan was key. Next time I might throw in a cheese rind.

to preserve the crispiness of the bread, i either do not add the bread until it is time to eat or i tell my family to just dip the bread as they like instead of leaving it in the soup.

ive made this 3 times. my family love this! the last time, i didn't have cilantro so i also used a little bit of dried thyme. i also added thinly sliced green bell pepper for garnish. also forgot the lime but it was still fantastic! it is important not to burn the garlic to avoid getting a bitter taste.

An simple to make dish that is both elegant and packed with flavor. This went over big in my house and will definitely go on my "Frequently Made" recipe list.

I used 6 bulbs of elephant garlic (had on hand), thyme instead of cilantro and eliminated the lime Made for 3 and poached 3 eggs in broth simultaneously, then served.

Ditto to the comments below. I didn't have any cilantro, but it was still very tasty.

A gift of free-range eggs caused me to go looking for a recipe that would do them justice. Mon Dieu! This is superb. The next time I made it, I made my own chicken stock. Wow! The garlic is smooth with no bite and the peper flakes add a lovely zing to it. We have this regularly and are thankful free-range, fresh eggs are so abundant in our area.

I LOVE this recipe! It is so simple and incredibly delicious. I made the full amount but with just bread and eggs for two - we kept pouring the rest of the broth into our bowls until we were done. It's a perfect fall/winter lunch or light supper meal.

There seemed to be a major clash of flavors happening here. The garlic, chicken broth, toast, and egg were on one side of the battle, with the cilantro and lime on the other. There was no winner, but there sure was a loser. I felt like I spent the better part of an hour (even with one of those rubber garlic peelers it takes me quite a while to peel and slice a whole head) preparing something that was really pretty awful.
