This shows up in back to school recipes. Come on editors. Really, a gin recipe in the back to school recipe section???

I loved this. It was not too sweet and really did smell like the forest - blueberries and pine trees. I served this with blueberry ice cream which overpowered the berries in gin syrup. They were better all by themselves.

Since the Blueberries in Gin were initially too sweet to my taste (tho my husband thought they were just fine) I looked for a way to incorporate them in something else,and the Nectarine & Blueberry Clafouti (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/NECTARINE-AND-BLUEBERRY-CLAFOUTI-101667) was perfect, so I think this was a nice way to use them, as I think cooking blueberries always gives you a sum greater than the parts in flavour ;-) Also, because what we had on hand were apricots, they worked great in place of nectarines.
