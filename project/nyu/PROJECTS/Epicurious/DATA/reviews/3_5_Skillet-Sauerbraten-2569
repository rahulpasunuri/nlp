This was easy to make, all ingredients were on hand, and my family liked it. I will definitely make it again.

This was easy and tasty - pretty much a nod to sauerbraten but I'd make it again!

This is a shoddy recipe that does not deserve the name 'sauerbraten.' It's as close to sauerbraten as a Twinkie is to wedding cake. The creator of this recipe should be embarassed.

Easy to make when you don't have time to marinate a roast for days. Very flavorful. Serve with homemade spaetzle.

Only so-so -- I'm not fond of onions and this had a strong onion flavor...

This was a great dish. I cheated and used a little corn starch to thicken the sauce but the ginger snaps give it a great flavour. I prepared this with the braised red cabbage on this website and they work very well together.

I used thinly sliced rib-eye and doubled the recipe. Served w/red cabbage cooked w/vinegar, onions & apple and potatoe latkes. Very,very good!

My wife may want to reduce the amount of vinegar a little but I thought it was great.
