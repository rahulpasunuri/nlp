This is INCREDIBLY delicious! I have been asked to make it over and over, to rave reviews every time. Like another reviewer, I made it to go with barbecued ribs, and made it again recently to go with grilled pork tenderloin. Last night, because the grill was not available, we just ate the marinated pineapple without grilling it, jokingly calling the recipe "drunken pineapple!"

This is absolutely delicious! I made it recently for a birthday luau (served with barbecued ribs; my own sauce recipe) and not only have I received multiple requests for the recipe but I've been asked to bring it to another party this weekend. Very easy - and yummy!

I didn't give this recipe four forks because I think it is just the beginning of a four fork recipe. I have made the roasted pineapple twice and used it in two different recipes, both which are four-forkers. One: In ice cream sundays, using vanilla bean and coconut ice cream. I reduced the marinade and swirled in some butter for a sauce (as another reviewer suggested) and topped it off with toasted coconut flakes. My only regret is I wish I'd doubled the sauce for my dessert for 12. Two: I used the pineapple in a trifle, with sauteed bananas and whip cream. I doubled the sauce this time, dipped slices of angel food cake in the sauce, and layered, cake, fruit and whip cream, topping it all off with toasted coconut. Both got rave reviews. The second time I roasted the pineapple at 425 for 20 minutes instead of grilling. Roasting works, but grilling is better and faster.

Yum! Didn't bother with the skewers, but did crescent shaped pieces. Only used 1/3 of the liquid to baste while cooking and reduced the other 2/3's over med-med/high with butter. Put the Ben & Jerry's pinapple/coconut ice cream in middle of plate and one piece of pineapple on each side and then drizzled with reduced sauce. Impressive, easy and super good!

Really simple and really good! I also used large wedges of pineapple instead of skewer-sized bites and reduced the leftover glaze to make a warm, buttery sauce. Yum!

Wow!! Delicious. I served with Hagen Das Pineapple- Coconut Ice Cream. I had extra glaze so I made it into carmel sauce by reducing it and wisking in some butter. You really can't beat tequila carmel. I garnished with some toasted coconut. This was an incredible dessert!

I used Meyer's Dark Rum instead of tequila, and didn't bother to thread the chunks, I just cut them on the large side and grilled them on the upper shelf-rack of the grill. They turned golden-brownish and were quite tasty. My big complaint was that you could really taste the booze! It was a strong, but not overly off-putting taste. Guests enjoyed the pineapple with vanilla ice cream served over it. If I were to make this again, I'd make it with less liqueur, or use one with a milder flavor. By the way, this does wonders for a sub-par (less than perfectly ripe) pineapple.

My family loved it, including the 14 and 17 year old.

This is an excellent grilled fruit dessert. Cored pineapple and cut thick slices rather than skewered, made for easier cooking. Served with a good vanilla ice cream.

This dish was easy and very tasty. I chose to follow the recommendations of another reviewer and made an extra recipe of the marinade for a reduction to drizzle over the pineapple. We served it with small almond cookies. Next time I would add a sprinkle of toasted coconut on top. We will definitely make it again.

Very good. Nice richness with the combination of rum and pineapple. The grilling creates a smoothness to the finished product. Everyone raved-make extra-great served by itself or with ice cream.

This is a staple in my dessert file. I add a pinch of lime zest to brighten it a bit, and 1/8 tsp ground cardamom. Also, I marinate the pineapple chunks (use a very ripe one) for several hours or overnight, and reduce the leftover marinade until slightly thick. The pineapple gets served over ginger ice cream, and topped with the reduction. Raves all around, always.

microwave pineapple 2-3 minutes before grilling

Not only did we love it, but a friend of mine begged for the recipe so it could be served at a large party. Small group or large, this is the best marinade ever. Try it with peaches as well as the pineapple and get ready for the raves!

This was great. Just be careful not to burn your hands off when you are basting with the tequila glaze.

2 forks. I followed the advice of the Pittsburgh cook below, using dark rum instead of tequila, and marinating the pineapple chunks for a few hours before skewering and grilling them. But I did get the comment that the marinade tasted very strong and did not blend with the pineapple. I wonder if tequila would blend better, and I'm sure that marinating for a few hours made the flavor too strong. Next time, I will follow the recipe as written, and then I will go ahead and enter an actual rating. Sorry, Pittsburgh cook... even though you are my own sister! :)

I've never cooked with fresh, whole pineapple before, but this dish convinced me that it's easy and worthwhile. The result was refreshing and delicious, and I'm looking forward to repeating this in the broiler and adding the pineapple to other recipes. I also used dark rum rather than tequila, and I would recommend marinating the pineapple chunks in the sauce for a few hours before skewering and grilling them.

I agree with the reviewer below who used dark rum. It's delicious! I've actually never tried it with tequila. This dish is a huge hit at barbecues, and at a dollar a pound pineapple is one of the cheapest grillables around.

Easy to make and can be prepared ahead of time. I served it for dessert with vanilla ice cream.

I didn't like the flavor - too much tequila. I'd rather eat plain pineapple.

excellant, especially when paired with chili spiced shrimp.
