I used a mix of ground beef, pork and veal, replaced the potatoes with cooked ditalini at the very end, and added chopped escarole. Excellent.

Good.You can call a recipe good if it is adaptable to your liking. I used 1/2 & 1/2 ground beef and pork and a touch of garlic paste made with the salt for the meatballs. I made meatballs no bigger than 3/4- inch diameter and dropped them in one by one so they did not stick together or drop straight to the bottom. I replaced potatoes with ditalini that I cooked just shy of al dente and then mixed in about 8- 10 mins. before serving. A little fresh escarole chopped and thrown in at the very end. Delicious.

This was a nice twist on the same old ground beef soup I had been making for years. It improved as leftovers the next day.

Wonderful! I read the recipe to my husband, and he didn't want me to make it, but we both loved it! I substituted cilantro for the parsley, and added garlic powder to the meatballs. I only had three potatoes, so I added one sweet potato. I also had fresh rosemary on hand and used that instead. I also added a little zucchini. YUM!! I'll keep this with my favorites.

I also modified the meatball recipe to add more spices and an egg white. I added a cup of red wine to the soup recipe and everything came out de-lish.

I used a different meatball recipe, based on other's comments about the meatballs. I also fried them in olive oil before putting them in the soup.

I added 3 cups of red wine to the broth and added Parmesan to each serving. Delicious,hearty and easy to make. Serves 6 to 8.

What a hearty, filling soup this is! It wasn't at all bland,though the tomatoes were kind of strong. I used dried breadcrumbs and added a little white pepper to the meatballs. They were nicely flavored.I also used Yukon gold potatoes and added some homemade garlic croutons.

the last time i made this, i used low salt chicken broth. i would not recommend this tactic! from now on i'll only use regular vegetable or chicken broth (not beef), and make sure i season the meatballs enough (didn't do that this time either.) all the other times i've made it it's been great.

The way the vegetables get prepared here tended to make mine turn out bitter. I rarely make a bad soup, but this was the exception. Also, the meatballs (despite a lot of attempts using worcestchire sauce and fresh herbs mixed in) lost any zip using the method described in this recipe.

Meatballs are bland as is. Try using flavored dry breadcrumbs and adding a couple cloves minced garlic and some more salt & pepper. Oh, and double the amount you make and freeze the rest for the next time. Also, I like to add some pasta - spirals are nice. I also add celery & zucchini. A little white wine is nice and enough broth to cover it all. Yum, yum, yum. It's become a staple at our house.

Delicious!! Added bottle of sherry cooking wine the last half hour, great flavor. Also added bow ties. Everone loved it!!!

This is a winner! I sweat the veggies first for 20 mins, then add them to the broth (I used chicken broth homemade)and meatballs (which I cook on a cookie sheet in the oven). Be sure that you have the bread crumbs small enough. I threw some cheese on top before serving

I turned this into a meatball stew by cutting veggies larger and thickening the broth afterward with flour and water. (Adds about 5 minutes onto the total cooking time to accomodate the larger pieces.) Other changes I made included: adding 1 teaspoon of basil the last few minutes of cooking, adding 1 egg and 1 additional teasp. of oregano to meatball mixture, and I used whole canned tomatoes, cut up with kitchen shears instead of chopped tomatoes. We just loved this dish.

Very good, but calls for too much thyme to blend in the cooking time suggested. I cooked this and left it sitting overnight and reheated it and the flavour was much nicer.

I decided to try this recipe after reading all the great reviews. I was dissapointed. The meatballs were pretty good, but the soup itself was just blah. My husband thought the same. Edible, but blah. I would not make it again.

This was so tasty. I had never boiled meatballs before, so I was a little apprehensive. But it all turned out great. I cut back on the potato and added another can of beef broth. My husband and I agree that this is a keeper!

We absolutely loved it...I am not a big cheese eater, so I didn't add it to the meatballs. Instead, I used a portion of an egg white. My boyfriend simply added cheese at the end. I tasted his, and it was fantastic. I added an eztra can of broth because I like it a little thinner, and I would recommend that addition-- the flavor was out of this world! I made a picky man, oh, so very happy!

I made this on a rainy day instead of the usual meatloaf, etc. I added a lot more spice (garlic pepper, italian seasonings, garlic) to my meatballs. The dish turned out to be quite tasty. Next time, I would probably add elbow macaroni!

We all liked this recipe and my 3 year old especially liked the meatballs. I added appx. 1 teaspoon minced bottled garlic to the meatball mixture and they were very flavorful. Next time I would double the recipe for meatballs as I ended up with tomato soup. I also added 1 extra can of beef broth and 1 bunch chopped fresh basil. The soup had to many tomatoes and 1/2 the called for amount would be more than enough.

I was sick in bed and my neighbor made this for me. It was delicious except the meatballs were a bit bland. I'd add more oregano, salt and pepper into the meat mixture. I did ask her for the recipe though because my husband snitched some and loved it too.

Absolutely delicous! I took a few suggestions and added more meatballs and elbow pasta.This soup is a meal in itself,even better the second day! Next time I will add an extra can of broth to balance out the extra meatballs and pasta.

Delicious! I made it twice, first time was exactly per recipe, second time, I added 1 can chicken broth and green beans. Just as delicious! Who knows what I'll do next time.

I made a half recipe of this soup last night for my husband and myself and thought that the soup was quite good. I added fresh tomatoes and a little more broth (chicken instead of beef). I took another reviewers suggestion and added some string beans along with celery and thought that the vegetables remained firm and retained their flavor well throughout the cooking. My only problem with the recipe was that I thought that the meatballs verged on tasteless. Possible next time I would add some more salt to the meat mixture.

Very good! My kids loved it! Next time I will 2x the meatballs b/c they ate them all out b4 I got home. Also added 1 extra can of broth, more oregano, basil, some Italian green beans and lots of pepper. We loved it!

Very easy to make. The meatballs were real good. First time I cooked meatballs in broth. I also added some elbow pasta (for the kids). Everyone loved it.

Fantastic dish! I made it first for the family, who raved about it. Then, in a fit of stupidity, I made it for a family reunion gathering, five-timesing (is there such a word?) the recipe. That's 30 carrots, 20 potatoes, and 10 onions to peel and chop up and a hundred or more meatballs to make. What a task. It was worth it, however, because everyone loved it. It was major hit. I get requests for it all the time. (I followed the recipe exactly--I'm compulsive about such things.)

A tasty and easy to assemble dish that the entire family will like. It's even better the next day, providing you have any left !

A very flavorful soup, despite the fact that my meatballs crumbled (the broth was probably boiling too rapidly)!

This recipe is easy to make and great for serving on chilly days. Best of all, Jerry likes it.
