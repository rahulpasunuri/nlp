Very simple and very yummy. I improvised (due to lack of ingredients) and it came out lovely anyway.

This is now a standard side dish with turkey in our family. It was just a little too sweet the first time I made it, so I cut out the sugar. Next time, I kept the sugar, but used fresh cooked yams. And I've used sweet potatoes. It works every which way. Doesn't always puff out as much but its still excellent .
