I love this recipe so much that I bought the large heart shape mold and four small ones.You can get them at Sur La Table or order online.You definitely need the dishes with the holes. The recipe is so easy and can be done ahead. It's nice to be able to duplicate a little of The Inn in your own home.

Very delicious and it has a definite WOW factor. I marinated the whole raspberries used for garnish in framboise liqueur and a little sugar which made it a bit more elegant. Next time I will try adding a bit of the framboise to the sauce as well.

Excellent, I have been making coeur a la creme for Easter for over 35 years. Decided to look for another recipe. Have made this two times in the last month and will make it for Easter.I used a package of frozen raspberries for the sauce then added fresh berries around the mold.

Easy to make and delicious! Have made it often and always use the perforated mold. For the "Cook From Ottawa" these dishes are available at the Domus store downtown for a very reasonable price. I now use a raspberry sauce by The Black Bear Fruit Company made here in B.C. and available at Loblaws stores,etc. Certainly saves that tedious step of straining the seeds in the raspberry sauce. This recipe from Epicurious is excellent. A friend's recipe substitutes the Mascarpone Cheese with a mixture of cottage cheese and cream cheese whipped together but I prefer the taste and texture of the Mascarpone which is available at Farm Boy Stores here in Ottawa..less expensive than other stores. I have traveled with this dessert in a cooler for hours, unmolding it when dinner is served later that day.

I loved the taste of this but had major problems with it setting - I chilled it overnight and it still didn't set enough to even remotely hold shape. I even went and bought less expensive (i.e. more porous) cheesecloth, but this didn't work either - does anyone have any troubleshooting tips? I followed the recipe exactly, and the only thing I can think of is that the cheese/sugar mixture only chilled for about five minutes while I whipped the cream. Please help, I would love to make this again the right way!

i made this for valentine's dinner. presenation was nice, flavor was okay. i didn't think it was anything particularly spectacular. you definitely need some sort of fruit sauce to go with it, that was what saved the dish for me. i dipped several pieces of fruit into mixture that was left over and personally thought this was better than the dessert itself. if i make this again i will put fruit in the mold.

This was a delicious and simple recipe. A perforated mold is actually not necessary. Just strain the mixture, wrapped in cheesecloth, over a bowl. Afterwards you can spread it into any mold you like. Also, sour cream in place of most of the heavy cream cuts through some of the heaviness. I will definately make this again.

This is fantastic! It's been a hit every time.

For the cook from Canada. These molds (and all kinds of other great things) can be found at fantes.com.

Where in Canada can you get coeur a la creme molds? I have also searched for them in the U.S. and U.K. with no luck. Any suggestions?

Once I figured out how to compensate for not having the correct molds (small holes punched in disposable individual tart pans) this recipe went very well. I found it to be a wonderful, yet elegant dessert. The raspberry sauce is a must, the tartness compliments the creme perfectly (but secretly, my husband enjoyed it better with caramel sauce drizzled over it!)

Wow! How nice of the Inn to share this. We dont have mascarpone here but cream cheese with a bit of yogurt worked well. I suggest adding a bit more lemon/vanilla and a bit of lemon zest for more flavor. AMAZING!

Made this for V-day with flourless chocolate cake. Couldn't find a mold in time, so spread it over cheesecloth the night before, then froze it briefly to firm up enough to cut with heart-shaped mini cookie cutters. It worked really well and the serving size wound up being about 1/4 cup- perfect as accompaniment to cake. The raspberry sauce was delicious and made a beautiful presentation.

Oh my goodness! If it can be made in small molds or cookie cutters, this sounds like a wonderful and decorative addition to a plate with a slice of flourless chocolate cake!!!!

I was a little intimidated to try this one because it looked so involved. Truthfully, it's very impressive with very minimal effort. They set up beautifully, and my fiancee was stunned at the presentation. (Do use this sauce or some sort of berry puree--it really needs the color and the tartness.) These are actually much less effort than baking a cake, and your guests will be in awe...

We all thought this had an elegance that mainstream desserts don't always have. We used a blueberry topping, but I am sure the raspberry sauce is great also.

I've made this recipe twice recently for groups and it was a complete hit - it even won the best recipe award at work for Valentine's Day lunch. It is actually pretty easy to make also - another benefit!

This was delicious. A couple of changes. I didn't have the fancy moulds, so I just used large heart-shaped cookie cutters. I laid the cheese cloth in there, spooned the mixture in over, folded the extra cheesecloth over, and pressed down to ensure it filled into all the corners evenly. Also -- I melted semi-sweet chocolate, added sweetened condensed milk (can use cream, too.) And used squirt bottles to decorate the plate and heart with raspberry and hot-fudge sauce. Excellent with champagne, followed up with coffee with a dash of chambrod.

What a perfect, sensuous dessert for Valentine's Day (or any special occasion). It was really easy to make and looked fantastic. However, even though I chilled it in the mold for 24 hrs, it started to melt a bit fairly soon after serving. The raspberry sauce is a must to serve with the coeur.

This was an incredibly delicious dessert I recently served to my very fussy in-laws following a formal seafood dinner on my husband's birthday. I used a large, free form mold with the cheesecloth and it turned out beautifully! My mother-in-law was actually caught having seconds! The chessecloth is essential--I experimented not using it and things got a bit wet, still delicious, but mushy. If you need to impress the in-laws or the boss, this is a winner!
