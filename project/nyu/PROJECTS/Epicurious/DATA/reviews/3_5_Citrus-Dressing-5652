This was a very refreshing dressing. I used fresh orange juice instead of concentrate. However, I added a few drops of organic essential oil of orange. This gave the dressing a nice flavour. An enthousiastic cook from Oakville, Ontario, Canada

This was a nice light alternative than the usual dressings. I, of course, changed this a bit. I substituted cider vinegar for the white wine vinegar and regular orange juice and olive oil rather than vegetable. This was wonderful.

I thought this was a very nice change from the usual vinegarettes. Very light...I added alittle extra o.j. concentrate. A keeper.
