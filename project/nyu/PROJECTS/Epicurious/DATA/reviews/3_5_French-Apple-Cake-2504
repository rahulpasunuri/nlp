So good! Crust of the cake is exceedingly tasty. I used 4 large Granny Smith apples (which still weighed only 1.75 pounds). I also put a generous slug of Calvados in with the apples as they were cooking down. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. The batter did not spill over my cake pan, even with the extra apples, although it came perilously close.

outstanding cake! Do use more apples, and choose very tart ones (northern spy is excellent) because the cake is very sweet. I used two huge Northern spies and two medium Stymans, had almost layers of apples on the bottom of my cake pan and it was absolutely perfect for the amount of batter. The topping is really good, and the cake itself is exceptional. I was a little concerned about it turning out too eggy , what with the three egg yolks, but it just makes a very rich, satisfying, flavourful cake. Used golden rum. Made vanilla sugar with old empty vanilla pods (ran out of regular vanilla). The sugar really added to the flavour. The rum taste went well with the apples. Maybe a little too sweet. Will try reducing the sugar in the cake to 2/3 cup next time. Otherwise a perfect fall cake. Definitely a keeper.

I made this with Better Batter gluten-free all-purpose flour and it came out really nicely. I'd make a few changes in addition to cutting the sugar, which was recommended already. The Better Batter needs 1 1/4 cups of sugar to get the right cake consistency. Next time I make this - and I will because it was really yummy, very beautiful, and pretty easy - I'll make almost double the apples/caramel and keep the cake portion the same. We wanted more apples, which are fabulous in this! I used a blend of white and brown sugar for the caramel and next time I'll use all brown sugar for a richer caramel. But overall this makes a really nice, easily executable and elegant gluten-free dessert.

I follow the recipe as written with the following modifications: I don't coat the pan entirely with sugar after buttering it, rather I coat it with flour. I short the sugar in both the apple mixture and the cake mixture, maybe 1/4 cup between the two. I find that each reduces the sweetness of the cake, but it is still delicious!

YUM! this was sure tasty. I reduced the amount of sugar in the syrup by 1/4 cup, so I decreased the water a little. I decreased the amount of sugar in the cake by half a cup. the cake still was quite sweet but perfect. I also cut the butter in the cake in half. I can tell it really didn't need it! I somehow forgot to add vanilla, which normally I add more to things but it was alright. I chopped up apples and mixed them in with the cake before pouring in to the pan.

Rating: 3
My only real complaint is I thought it could have used more apples. I used 4 Gala apples with only a tablespoon of sugar, more than enough. I would have liked a solid layer of apples instead of laying them out one by one. I didn't have the brandy and while it was still delicious I think it would have been much better with it. Or some kind of substitute for more flavor, ground ginger or...

I have made this cake several times and my honey loves it. Some tips I follow. I know some say it's too sweet..but i think it depends on who you treat the caramel. I use 5 apples (either granny smith or golden delicious). I peel them and use an apple corer/slicer thing on them. I then cut each wedge into thirds. I double the recipe for the apple cooking liquid and I add 3-4 tablespoons of calvados to it. I do let the apples cool and then place them in concentric circles. After all the apples are placed I put the caramel back on the stove and cook it until it's very thick, at least soft ball stage. I then pour it on the apples and follow the rest of the recipe to the "T". I use a springform pan wrapped in aluminum and have never had issues with it sticking. I love this cake and have been making it for over 10 years.

I have served this French Apple cake twice now and both times there was none left after the evening was over. I added fresh cranberries to the apples as I sauteed them for Thanksgiving. I served it with fresh whipped cream with cinnamon and nutmeg whipped in.

A great and easy cake that can be made with what's normally in my pantry. I used less sugar (about half of what was called for) and used the same spices I use for apple pie with less cinnamon (ginger, allspice, a tiny bit of clove.) For the cook from Devon, never scrape a pan with caramel, just soak it. It's sugar; it'll dissolve.

Was a very simple quick recipe. I followed some suggestions. I used eggs at room temp, 3 and 1 yolk, next time I will try 2 with 2 tbsp milk. I beat eggs before adding sugar, etc. I let apples and syrup cool before dumping in pan, and I reduced sugar to less than 3/4 cup for both cake and syrup and next time I will reduce even more. I will also use more apples next time, by request of my husband (this time I used 4 small ones). Delicious!!!! Hubby loved it!!!

Rating: 4
Really great cake. But for the love of dogs, DO NOT USE A SPRINGFORM PAN! I did, and the caramel made the two parts adhere together - I feared permanently. Gouged some of the pan's finish in removing the caramel and separating the side from the bottom. A nightmare - one that you can avoid by using another type of cake pan. I'd also use less sugar, as others have mentioned.

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness is this delicious! I left out the Calvados and didn't replace it with anything and I used Gala apples instead of Granny Smith (reducing the 3/4 c. sugar by 2 tbsp. since Galas are sweeter). It was so yummy! The only thing I'll do different next time is reduce the 3/4 c. sugar to 1/2 c. since it was still to sweet with the Galas. (In other words, base the amount of sugar you use on your apples' sweetness if you don't have Granny Smiths on hand). The syrup from the apples forms a really nice caramel-ly crust around the edges. The texture of the cake is positively divine. I used a 9" round springform.

I made this yesterday to use up some apples. Like others, I made a few adjustments, including a bit of cloves with the cinnamon in the topping and a little nutmeg in the dough. I also used 3 eggs and 1 yolk. I didn't have brandy, but didn't miss it. Overall, it was very good and one I would make again. Like another reviewer, I advise cooling the apples before placing them in the pan (I used a springform pan). Overall, great comfort food.

This is such a great cake (husband's new fave) and it looks fantastic (I use an 8" square pan) Crisp on the edges with a moist beatiful crumb...really superb. The first time I made it with apples and everyone loved it. The next time I simplified it: I coated the bottom of the pan with melted butter (maybe 10-12 tablespoons) then a layer of light brown sugar, then put halved plums (seasonal) face down and covered with the batter. It turned out BEAUTIFULLY and the acidity from the plums is perfect with the richness of the cake, and really beautiful to look at. I also made another batch in 1/2 cup ramekins which turned out perfect fancy little cakes great for a dinner party with unsweetened whipped cream or creme fraiche. I will keep the cake recipe and use it for whatever fruits are in season...cranberries are next! Might be a good idea (esp. with smaller fruits) to put a layer of parchment on the bottom so that none of the fruit sticks.

This is an amazing apple cake which I have made for the last few years. This week I wanted two different cakes at a dinner party. I made the apple cake. Then I experimented and made almost the same recipe using red pears and fresh pomegranate seeds instead of apples. I added the pomegranate seeds right at the end of briefly cooking the pears. I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon. I used 2 Tablespoons Benedictine instead of Calvados in the cake. The pear & pomegranate cake was different but just as delcious and beautiful as the apple cake. I made no changes to the cake recipe except for the Benedictine, and they took a similar amount of time to bake.

I love this cake! Absolutely gorgeous and super delicious! It was easy easy to make. -- I wrote about it on my blog: http://tinyurl.com/2eqk 8b ---- Key changes: I made this in my 10" springform pan (sitting on a pizza pan.) No spillage, easier to turn out. I used Macoun apples - I peeled them and sliced them with an apple slicer (uniform size, but I had to cook a little longer.) I removed the apples from the cooking pan with a slotted spoon and let them cool COMPLETELY. I didn't have any brandy, it would have added a nice little touch, but it didn't hurt the cake at all. I used 3 eggs and one yolk. (I'm a rebel.) I will make this cake again very soon.

My mother-in-law was a wonderful hungarian cook who made everything without recipes. This recipe reminds me of one of her regular cakes...perfect, baked in a rectangular pan so she could cut it into squares. I remembered that she sprinkled ground nuts on the bottom of the pan, closely placed slices of raw apples in a single layer and then poured on the batter. So, I made the batter from this recipe and did not cook the apples. The cake was outstanding. I'm sure it is also good if you follow it precisely but I don't see the need to pre-cook the apples if you use quarter inch slices.

It's a perfectly fine uncomplicated afternoon tea kind of cake. Nothing spectacular or pretencious, just nice comfort food.

I made this cake for our family Christmas Day dessert -- I followed/combined previous tips -- William from NJ wisely suggests to cool the apples before arranging and before reducing the syrup, as well as a good beating of the eggs before adding sugar etc. I also followed the cook from Sacramento's suggestion of 2 eggs and 2 Tbsp of milk -- This is one of the best desserts I have ever served- raves from all. I whipped creme freshe with a bit of sugur for the topping and it was a perfect finish. Just sweet enough, but not so much. I will most certainly make this cake again and again! A warning though - it can spill over the edges of a 2" pan with the apples and reduced sauce etc. , so to be safe, put the pan on a cookie sheet.

Rating: 4
This is a very nice cake. I have a few problems with the way the method is layed out, and have adjusted it so: 1. When buttering the pan, the butter should be the consistency of cold cream; do not use melted butter. 2. Make sure that you allow the cooked apples to cool before you arrange them in the bottom of the prepared pan, otherwise the heat from the apples will melt the butter/sugar coating. 3. Do not boil the syrup until you have arranged the apples in the pan. 4. As with most cakes, make sure the eggs are at room temperature. 5. Begin whipping the eggs BEFORE adding the sugar. You want the eggs to provide a bit of rise to the cake, and whipping them first, then slowly adding the sugar as they whip will ensure a better mix. Then add the vanilla and Calvados. 6. Make sure the melted butter is cool before adding it to the cake mixture. Of course, as with all recipes, it is important to read through the directions at least twice before beginning. Doing so, in this recipe, will tell you that the apples are not cooked in 1.75 cups of sugar! I've made this cake five times using the method I decribe above and it has turned out perfectly each time.

I just made it last night and it was a real hit with my family. I would give four forks with the adjustment I made: reduce sugar to 3/4 cup for the cake, cream butter and sugar first and then beat in the eggs one at a time until pale white. I used 3 eggs and omitted all the egg yorks. The result was a pound-cake-like cake topped with delicious apples and caramel sauce. Mmmmmm...this recipe is a keeper!

A cold, rainy spring morning enticed me to make this recipe. I followed it almost to the letter, other than throwing in a couple of extra apples. I think it is perfectly wonderful.

This cake is amazing! I always read reviews and thought about changing this recipe but I didn't end up changing it as much as other reviewers. I didn't use cinnamon as it detracts from the true apple flavour (as per Steingarten). I did use 4 or 5 Gala apples and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the caramel. I didn't have any brandy so I used a total of 1 tbsp of excellent organic vanilla. I wanted to make 2 small cakes and ended up baking this in 2-6" springform pans set on parchment paper on a sheet pan. Baked 35-40 mins. Wow! A wonderful way to use up apples that are past their prime! Make it today...don't delay!

Good, but not what I hoped. Following other suggestions I put in 2 eggs & 2 Tbls milk, and cut the sugar in the cake by 1/2 cup. The topping was too sweet, the cake dense.

This recipe can be good but I gave it only 2 forks because of the way it is written.

Why separate some of the ingredients but not all of them?

This was a big hit with my husband! I changed it quite a bit though, I confess. I used Bosc pears instead of apples (I am allergic to apple). I cut down on the sugar in the caramel and used splenda in the cake. I didn't use cinnamon (I agree with the one reviewer's comment about cinnamon not being particularly French .. Have never tasted anything in France made with cinnamon - it was an alien spice to my mother.) Instead I spiced the pear mixture with mace, nutmeg, and ginger. Yum yum yum.

How is this a FRENCH apple cake?? It's more like an AMERICAN to me... (What's this obsession about always having to use a ton of cinnamon for every apple recipe??) If you omit the cinnamon and use golden delicious apples instead, it would be more like an authentic French version.

I did not read any reviews before I made this, and it was very good. I do agree though with some reviews about cutting down the sugar. I thought that the cake would be to "egg-y" but it was fine and quite light textured. I did not have a problem with that. I'll make it again with less sugar...

This cake is divine, but only if you modify the ingredients for the cake base, which is very rubbery and somewhat dry. One my second try, I reduced the number of eggs to 2 large eggs, and added 2 tablespoons of milk. I also used the mixing technique from "The Cake Bible": I added softened butter (not melted) plus the milk and Calvados to the dry ingredients, beat for 1-1/2 minutes, then added the eggs and vanilla in two parts. Both times I made the cake it baked in 40 minutes (not 45).

I made this a few years ago, but just made it again a few evenings ago to take to my in-laws' for dessert. The cake was moist, the apples smelled delicious while cooking, and not too fussy to make. I made half a batch more, as I used a 10 inch springform pan. Also added in a half tsp. of Ground Ginger to the cake mix and baking apples, added about 1/4 c. pressed brown sugar to the apples while cooking, and used Cream Sherry, as I didn't have any Brandy.

Like the other reviewer, I tried in the springform pan. You need the foil to catch the drippings. But I was not impressed with the flavor. It tasted like semi-sweet cornbread over applesauce. I would think the apple crisp being talked about in this listing would be much better.

Don't bother trying to arrange the hot apple slices into an attractive pattern. They will look just fine, covered with a wonderful melted sugar patina, so long as you just distribute them around the pan more or less evenly. (And you won't have to burn your fingers!) This was a very easy and tasty recipe. The cake itself is plain and not at all rich, so it goes well with a bit of whipped cream or ice cream. I made it in a pie pan and it was easy to release and invert onto a plate for serving. I didn't have any calvados around so I used kirsch, which worked out just fine. I think that it probably would have come out just as well with almost any kind of sweet liqueur or with rum, or in a pinch, plain old vanilla.

Fabulous cake! I made the recipe exactly - the scent of vanilla and Calvados in the cake is heavenly and the touch of cinnamon in the apples is enough to complement them without becoming the dominant flavour. I used a 9" springform pan, and put some foil underneath it, as suggested by another reviewer. This is necessary as some of the juice did seep out and was caught by the foil. It looks soooo pretty made in a round pan - impressive for company, but 3 of us ate half the cake for a bedtime snack!

This was great. It had a delicious caramel topping and a nice moist cake layer. I used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon in the syrup, and a pretty generous sprinkling of sugar on the bottom of the pan. If you use a springform pan, be sure to put a cookie sheet or aluminum foil under it, because a small amount of the syrup may ooze out from the bottom. It came out of the pan perfectly, and makes a very pretty presentation.

I also used the review's suggestions to reduce fat and sugar. The applesauce was a great suggestion. I think you need to carmalize the sugar/butter sauce at the end (like the recipe says to do) of the apple sauteing to hold them together. This cake has great PRESENTATION!

Like the previous reviewer, I reduced both the sugar and the fat content of the cake, and it was still absolutely delicious. For the cake part, I used equal parts butter and unsweetened applesauce (1/4 cup each). Replacing butter with applesauce is a good trick for many baked goods recipes, including other cakes and brownies

Delicious cake. However, I cut down on the fat content by reducing the egg yolks by one and cutting the butter in the batter portion to 1/4 cup. I also did not pour the buttery syrup over the apples. The cake was delicious with these changes and not as rich. I also cut down the sugar by about 1/4 cup overall.

This recipe is fabulous!! I baked it for Gourmet Night at a local Dance studio. It won me some free dance lessons. I'll certainly use this recipe frequently.

I have been making this cake for a few years. I always receive rave reviews. It is easy, yet people think you've slaved. I've used ordinary Brandy sometimes. Now I prefer the Calvados and I use more apples than it says. I slice them about an inch thick and cook them a little longer.

My family did not like this cake because it tasted like eggs. My whole house smelled like eggs.

This is an extremely version of a French classic--not cloyingly sweet and where all the ingredients have distinct an individual flavorings. I've made it several times to rave reviews (including a test on some very culinarily fussy French friends)and friends who begged for the recipe and tried it themselves had similar triumphs at table. I substituted native Northern Spys for the Granny Smiths.
