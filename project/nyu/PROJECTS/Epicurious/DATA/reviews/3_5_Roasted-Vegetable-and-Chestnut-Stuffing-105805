My 16 oz loaf of sourdough bread only made about 11 cups of stuffing. Anyone else notice this and have any ideas? Should I get more bread or should I go by the ounce measurement? Thanks.

I used vegie broth to respect the vegetarian diners, and much more broth than originally called for. I added more parsley but i'm not sure if it did anything. It has a delicate flavor and might be overwhelmed if drowned in gravy.

I tried this out last week and thought it was pretty tasty. I couldn't find chestnuts and add some chopped up pumpkin with the roasted veggies. I think a few more spices would definately make it more exciting. I look forward to adding it to my Thanksgiving repertoire.

Used French Chestnuts in jar, used white mushrooms, left out the red peppers, used a lot more broth, baked both in turkey as well as in a casarole dish and it was a real hit. It does make a lot of stuffing - next year will cut recipe in half, but it will be on the menu next year.

I use french chestnuts in a jar. Mild flavor. My family loves all the flavor and there is not too much bread.

I use "French" chestnuts in a jar from Williams Sonoma. My family loves it and I make it whenever a stuffing would add to a meal. One nice thing..... Not too much bread.

Used "French" chestnuts in a jar from Williams Sonoma and did not have any flavor issues. My whole family loves it and I now serve it every Thanksgi ving and Christmas.

I omitted the chestnuts and added lots of extra chicken broth to make it moist. It was absolutely delicious! Everyone in my family has now insisted that I make this stuffing every year!

Made this for Thanksgiving... tasted good but too many flavors all at once and it turned out a little dry (baked outside the bird) Maybe next time no chestnuts and some more moisture while baking...? But, the family liked it (except the chestnuts looked like "brains") the rosemary tasted great...

The ingredients sounded great but the taste was rather bland. It took awhile to prepare and did not have the consistency of stuffing I usually like. Did not go over well with guests at Thansgiving. Also, this recipe states it's for 10-12 but it could be for 15-20. Ingredients could be reduced.
