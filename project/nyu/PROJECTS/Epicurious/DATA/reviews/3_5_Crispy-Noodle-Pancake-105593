I had a ton of ramen I needed to get rid of (long story...) and figured this would be a good way to use it. I was right! I used olive oil for mixing with the noodles, and cooked these in butter (since I didn't have vegetable or sesame oil in the house). They still turned out great! Really crispy, surprisingly flavorful, and a good side for a vegetable stirfry.

This is a very good basic recipe, I cut the boiing time on the noodles a little to make sure they don't over cook. depending on my audience I may toss them with a little hot oil for flavor! These are great with cashew chicken over them!

This wasn't bad, and I could see making it again, but for its "premiere" in my kitchen, it accompanied some rather dry, barbequed Oriental-inspired shrimp -- and that kind of combo doesn't work. This recipe would seem an ideal match for a Chinese dish with a rich brown sauce to sop up the noodles. Also, this recipe is strange in that it calls for "fresh" chow mein noodles. I've heard of fresh Italian-style pasta, but what are we supposed to do in this case -- cut wonton wrappers into matchsticks?? Fuggetaboudit. I used packaged yellow Chinese noodles meant to cook for 5 minutes and they served the current purposes well.

I made this dish with leftover Thai rice noodles, which stuck horribly to the pan (even in a non-stick teflon pan) and fell apart when I tried to flip the pancake. Next time I will stay with chow mein noodles as called for, or leftover semolina like a previous reviewer suggested - I think these both have are starchy enough to hold together better. In any case, the recipe has great potential.

What a GREAT way to use up left over noodles (spaghetti, included)! I added some soy sauce, sesame oil, few red pepper flakes, powdered garlic to some left over spaghetti. Fried in a bit of peanut oil. :)

It was easy to make and had great flavor. I loved the crunch. The Scallop Stir Fry that it accompanies was just so-so.

This recipe goes with the scallop stir fry in the book "B.A. Everyday." The noodle pancakes were wonderful--chewy and flavorful. The scallop stir fry, which I made with a reasonable substitute--shrimp--was average. In fact, out of the five or so recipes that we have tried from this new B.A. cookbook, this noodle pancake recipe is the most likely to be repeated in our house.
