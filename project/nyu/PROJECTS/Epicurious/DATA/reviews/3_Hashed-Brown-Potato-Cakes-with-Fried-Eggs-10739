I love making breakfast on the weekends and was looking for something outside my normal line up. This was just what I was looking for! Cooking times were just right.

I saved time - very necessary at breakfast - and used frozen hashbrowns that I left out to thaw overnight. Much faster!

Was very good as written. For variety, add two cloves of minced garlic and about 6 chopped Monterey mushrooms; top with a teaspoon of picante sauce and/or a little shredded cheese for more color variety and flavor. Here in NM adding green chile to taste is a must.
