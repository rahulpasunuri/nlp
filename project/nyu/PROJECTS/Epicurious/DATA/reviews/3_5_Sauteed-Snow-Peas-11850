Superb technique for these flavorful veggies. Experiment with them. Loved the sesame oil suggestion.

Try using sesame oil for the final saute and finish with toasted sesame seeds. Adds a nice twist and still keeps it really simple.

Too bad this helpful how-to is stuck at a low would-makethis-again percentage because a coupla smartasses thought it was silly. It's along the lines of Mark Bittman's bestseller "How to Cook Everything"--not rocket science, but so helpful when you don't have time to experiment and you want something to turn out well on the first try. There are a lot of ways to prepare veggies, and they're easy to overcook. This "recipe" is helpful for getting that just-right crisp-tender outcome.

This is way better than the oil from the Mars invasion vehicle I had previously used...cool!
