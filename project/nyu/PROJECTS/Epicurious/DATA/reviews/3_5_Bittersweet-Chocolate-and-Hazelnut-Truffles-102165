to A Cook from MN Chocolate truffles are named so because they resemble truffles found on the ground. Because of that, I think it's charming when they don't come out perfectly round. Besides, if they taste good, who cares what they look like? Just my humble opinion.

After 2 hours in the refrigerator the chocolate was hard and impossible to form into balls. But I let it sit out and eventually was able to form them into lopsided balls. After they were all formed I rolled them in the hazelnuts which helped disguise their imperfections. Next time I make it (if I do which is unlikely) I would make it as fudge and cut into squares, pressing the hazelnuts on top.

this just SOUNDS like four forks - I will make this week. Can the recipe be doubled? I want to make sure there is enough to go around. . .

When the ganache firms up it got nearly impossible to handle for me (too firm) even after leaving it at room temperature for awhile. Maybe because I skipped the brandy (and just used a bit more vanilla). Otherwise, these were quite delicious. I also coated some in milk chocolate. Fabulous. Also, be sure to finely chop the hazelnuts for the coating.

I made these without the hazelnuts in the truffle itself because I prefer the pure creaminess of the chocolate. I rolled half in chopped hazelnuts and half in unsweetened cocoa. Great look. Also try a coffee liquer instead of the brandy for a different flavor.

excellent truffle recipe. I think I improved it by substituting the brandy with2 tablespoons of Kahlua. The final product could only be described as addictive.

Yum - yum!! If you are looking for an easy way to impress, this is it!!! I also chopped up all of the hazelnuts the second time I made these!

I screwed up at the supermarket when I bought the chocolate, I didn't buy enough. I had some semi-sweet chocolate on hand and mixed that with the bittersweet and these still came out just fine.

These were wonderful and very easy.

These truffles just melt in your mouth. My only suggestion would be to grind all of the hazelnuts.
