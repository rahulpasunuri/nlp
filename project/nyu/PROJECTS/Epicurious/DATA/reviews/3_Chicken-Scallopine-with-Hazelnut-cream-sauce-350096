After reading the reviews, I sprinkled smoked onion spice mix on the chicken and used apple cider in place of the wine. Delicious! The hazelnuts must be toasted to get the great flavor and texture they add to the sauce.

I made this recipe using soy creamer and Gardein chick'n. The meat and the sauce were very good. However, the hazelnuts just didn't lend a lot to the dish, to my surprise. I think something creamier in texture would have helped, maybe some mushrooms instead of the hazelnuts?

Seems bad to give something only one fork but it stands for okay which is what this recipe was-I agree with other reviewers that this was easy but bland-wish I had read the other reviews beforehand-might have added leeks or onions to give it more flavor

Although this was an easy dish to prepare, I didn't find anything special about it. In fact, I thought it was a little bland. I won't be making it again.

This was very good, and very easy to make. The Madeira gives it great flavor, and the hazelnuts give it a nice texture. http://megan- deliciousdishings.blogspot.com/2008/1 1/chicken-scallopine-with-hazelnut- cream.html

I would have gone 3 forks, but my husband raved. Sure, this seems simple. Play with it! Add onion and leeks to the shallot. Drop in some Green Tabasco. Use sherry instead of madeira. The hazelnut/chicken combination is the basis for delicious experimentation. Go!

We enjoyed this a lot - and of course it comes together easily. I didn't have Madeira on hand, so I substituted Marsala. I'm sure this changed the flavor quite a bit, but we enjoyed it this way.

I thought the recipe was OK, nothing exceptional. My husband hated it. This isn't something I'll make again.

I loved this, husband thought it could use a little more depth of flavor.
