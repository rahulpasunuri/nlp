Good but not the best thing I've ever made from Epicurious recipes. (My dinner guests liked it more than I did) I prepared it exactly as directed and everything was fine. I splurged on a high quality sheep/goat blend feta which was a good idea given it's such a main part of this dish.

Very tasty and my husband loved it too (it's hard to find dishes we both like). I used low fat cheeses and it was still delicious. 30 minutes wasn't enough time to melt the cheese on top and the center of the shells were barely warm. It took more like 45-55 minutes to bake, but maybe my oven is off. I made the sauce the day before and that definitely cuts the prep time. Definitely an easy, tasty dish, and I will be putting this in the meal rotation.

Initially, I thought the sauce was a little "over-basiled" (I never thought such a thing was possible before), but it mellowed and balanced itself after a day in the fridge. The filling is great, with just the creamy cheesiness you'd expect from this kind of dish. We've found that the entire recipe, as written (12 shells) does go a long way...we've been eating it for going on four days now...

The sauce came very good - I sauted onions in butter til clear, seasoned with the crushed red pepper, added garlic (4 cloves) and then followed recipe for the rest of the ingriedents and directions. The filling is good. I added some grated lucatelli cheese to mine, which gives it a bit of sharpness. Lastly, I did half with shells and half with manicotti shells. Everyone seemed to like the texture of the manicotti better, as did I. Enjoy!

Very good recipe. I made a half batch, but made some slight changes prompted by reading the other reviews. I used 3 cloves of garlic in the sauce and 1 clove of garlic in the filling. I also added some Italian seasoning just after I added the red pepper. I chopped the tomatoes and then uses a potato masher on them to leave them as medium size pieces. I also added 1/4 t. sugar to the sauce. The recipe turned out excellent. I made it for a dinner party and a guest asked for the recipe. It is worth making.

Easy and delicious. I made the sauce withon 1 28 oz. whole can tomatoes and kept the rest of the sauce ingred. the same and cut in half the pasta and filling amount. Absolute wonderful.

I stuffed manicotti shells instead of jumbo pasta shells, because that's what I had in the pantry. It turned out great.

This was such a delightful meal! Easy to make and delicious, even re-heated for lunch a few days later. I added more red peppers than the recipe called for since I favor spicy sauces. I even tried my own variation and diced some sauteed shrimp and added to the stuffing.

This was a very delightful, tasteful dish. I also used the crushed tomatoes as I don't have a food processor. I used fat-free feta cheese and a low fat ricotta however and I think regular feta would have been a little tastier. Overall, would make again as my hubby liked this.

These are delicious. I just used crushed tomatoes, instead of chopping up whole. It makes a lot of stuffing.

I selected this recipe solely b/c I had ricotta, feta, fresh basil, green onions and a half-jar of spaghetti sauce in the fridge needing to be disposed of. The result was delightfully surprising! Since I had sauce on hand, I did not use the recipe here but I plan to do so next time. Also, I substituted my green onions for the chives. Hubby said this was great, good enough for company and he's a little on the stingy side when it comes to complimenting meals.

Mmm, mmm, mmm. These shells are terrific. I took them to a potluck recently, and at the end of the evening the pan looked like it had been licked clean. One of the guests (an older woman) told me these were the best stuffed shells she had ever had. Another guest (a runner with a big appetite) went back for seconds, thirds, and fourths! I really liked that the meal was separated into two 9x13s, so I had another entire pan to serve for dinner at home. I also had enough basil left over to make just the sauce, which I froze and served later over pasta--the sauce is very basic and simple, but very good. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was very delish! It turned out really well. The only modification I made was that I threw in some pine nuts and I used the canned chopped tomatos b/c I don't have a food processor. It was easy to make, although it took a while and made a pretty big mess in the kitchen. A good recipe to make ahead of time.

This was sooo good! Everyone LOVED it. I used 1 tsp crushed peppers, 1/4 tsp chilli powder and 2-3 tsp minced garlic. I also had to simmer for close to 2 hours before it boiled down enough. (Made sauce day ahead)

Great, quick recipe. Leftovers were tasty, too!

I also changed the sauce slightly by adding Italian Seasoning and salt. I made this dish for a large dinner party (40 people)and got rave reviews.

Great & simple! I cooked the sauce on Sunday, so I could come home & make the rest Monday evening. I cut the recipe in half for two of us and still had enough left for 2 luches tomorrow.

Made this for a graduation dinner with tons of other food, but this by far got the most compliments. The sauce is very unique -- it tasted MUCH better on the second day, worlds away from when it was first made. Follow other reviewer's advice on added spices for it. I can't wait to make this again.

My inlaws are italian- and they said this was the best they had had! couple changes i made though: coook 1.5 lg onion in some butted in sauce pan till clear. about 1/4tsp red pepper, dash of turmeric, and then add garlic. i used 3-4 cloves...i think. cook well and add italian seasoning. THEN add all other sauce ingrediants. I was told that the sauce was what separated the taste from all other shells. Also, after you have added the pureed plum tomatoes, add 1/2 tsp of sugar, then salt. (cant remember how much salt. id say close to size of a quarter.). veyr good but very heavy. this is a keeper!

We tried this last night as a possibility for our Christmas dinner which must be both vegetarian and appeal to all ages. It was excellent. As suggested we used more garlic and added some to the filling along with some oregano. Since it will be for a holiday I used Whole Foods fresh ricotta and their goat feta. I put the tomatoes through the coarse plate of my food mill and was very pleased with the texture of the sauce. One note on the recipe: it would be better if the feta measurements were either weight or volume rather than both and it should be noted in the ingredient listing that it is "divided."

A good, comforting dish on one of our first cold fall nights! I pepped up the sauce with a little more crushed red pepper. Also made this with nonfat ricotta and low-fat feta. It was still quite good. This is a great dish to make ahead, too.

This is nice and simple. A good vegetarian option or great as a potluck dish. I agree with the other reviews that it needs more garlic (double it!) and low fat ricotta works well.

We made this last night (cut it in 1/3 for 2 people, or 10 shells) and it was quite good. We used 3 cloves of garlic for 2 servings and that was great for us. We suggest adding one minced clove of garlic to the filling as well. Probably making this ahead of time enables the flavors to really develop. We'll make it again. Very good, about 2 3/4 forks, not great, but an enjoyable dinner.

Ate one, froze one. Great flavor that loses nothing by freezing, and the extra pan is handy to have when you want a delicious meal but don't want to cook.

This recipe was DELICIOSO!!! Growing up in the Italian restaurant business, I know what GOOD Italian food should taste like. The flavors of this dish are very fresh, a pleasure to the pallet!

Fairly easy to make, which is good. I also used 4 cloves of garlic in the sauce and added thin sliced mushrooms and olives to it. Skipped the chives in the filling but added extra spices. We found it to be a very flavorful, and filling, meal. My husband says it "needs meat" but I think he'll survive ;) Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is awesome. I added some garlic to the sauce, which added a lot more flavor. The filling seems a little bland at first, but if you play with different spices (oregeno, salt, pepper, cayenne), it becomes wonderful.

I made this for a potluck and was very disappointed. The sauce and the cheese filling lacked a lot of flavor-very bland dish-nothing spectacular. I always double the garlic and that didn't even help.

I was unsure on how the feta cheese would be with this but I was extremely pleased. This is an excellent dish. I used low-fat ricotta cheese and it tasted grrrreat! I served it with french bread w/ balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I will definitely be making this meal again very soon!

Excellent! As suggested by earlier reviewers, I cooked the onion less and chopped the tomatoes by hand. The texture was fine. I also cut the recipe in half. I do have a question: Has anyone used low-fat ricotta cheese?

Rating: 4
This dish is outstanding!. I used 4 cloves in the sauce and chopped the tomatoes by hand, which yielded a chunkier sauce to offset the lack of texture. This is a great dish to make for a crowd or for leftovers. It tastes even better the second day.

Excellent recipe! I froze the second dish before cooking and it it was as good as the first, fresh basil is a must.

VERY nice...however, a little lacking in texture. Maybe letting the onions cook less? Still delicious.

I first made this recipe when it came out in Bon Appetit. It played to rave reviews and is a frequent request when the weather is cool. This is a standby, a family favorite, and easy to make.

I agree with Maya from NY. I have made this many times and always awesome. I use 1% cottage cheese instead of ricotta and lighten by using only egg whites in the filling and reducing oil in the sauce. Fresh basil is the secret. I discovered the recipe while looking for a way to use up a large supply and what a find!

While this was a bit time consuming it turned out to be quite delicious. I added extra chili flakes and basil to my sauce. I served this with cubed melons marinated in Port/mint and chewy bread. Yum!

If I could give this a dozen forks I would. I have made this since it first appeared in the magazine. Everyone I have made it for swoons and inevitablely asks for the recipe. In fact, maybe I should keep this recipe to myself as my little secret...
