Made the lamb chops only (not the veg). Ok but unremarkable. Was hoping for spicier.

My sister, Mary, had a little lamb, a little beef, a little pork, a little cheese, a little fish, I'm glad she had a little fork.

Lamb is difficult to prepare (without falsifying it's basic taste), but this recipe rates very well. Beef dishes usually need no great adjustments to it's basics, but the "other meats" - quail, ostrich, lamb, game (and others) sometimes well-prepared recipes like this to bring out their true flavor.

Just one word, yuck. We typically enjoy Indian flavored food but this dish had little taste. The expression on my husband's face when he took the first bite made it clear that this was not a recipe we would be trying again.

My husband and I had this for dinner last night, I followed the recipe exactly and we thought it was very good. It is certainly not the greatest lamb recipe I've ever made but worth a try. What I like is that it is a complete meal. The marinade was easy but didn't give the lamb much flavor. The vegetables were wonderful. The Red Bell Pepper Sauce was the weakest part of the menu - quite bland. I had a jar of roasted red pepper sauce which had more flavor so I mixed them. The sauce really does tie the meal together.

The marinade was lovely; quick and easy to make. I marinaded lamb chops and pork chops, both were enhanced by the marinade. To increase the flavour, I took the suggestions of one of the reviewers and added ginger, garlic and curry spices. However the vegetables were bland and lacking in flavour. English swede is quite large and dominated the vegetables. I had a good third of the vegetables left-over. For all the work required to cut-up the vegetables, I would not make this again. I would repeat a similar marinade again.

Madhur Jaffrey's marinade sounds good, will you share the recipe?

The marinade in this recipe is quite similar to one I used last night for lamb kebabs. It came from Madhur Jaffrey's "Indian Cooking." Her marinade uses the same proportion of ingredients, but calls for much less (for example, I used 1/2 cup yogurt for 2 lbs. of boneless lamb), and also includes garlic and finely minced ginger, and ground coriander instead of cardamom. I also used a good quality fat-free yogurt, so am dubious about the need for whole-milk yogurt in this version. This marinade sounds like a good variation on the theme, and worth trying with either the chops or kebabs.
