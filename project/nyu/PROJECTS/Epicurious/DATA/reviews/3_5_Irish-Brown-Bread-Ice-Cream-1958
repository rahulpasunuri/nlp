I served this tonight as part of an all-Irish meal, it was by far the star of the party. Delicious! I used 1 tsp. vanilla extract instead of a bean, and crumbled the soda bread by hand, keeping the crumbs pea-sized.

I made this icecream just as written and it was great. This was a nice dessert for my St Patrick's day dinner.

I made this twice each time using fat free whipped topping and low calorie brown bread. It came out delicious and got rave reviews. Certainly is different than most ice creams.
