Very good. I used 4 thighs and 1 breast (bone in)removed the skin before cooking. Most grocery stores have dried anchos in the produce section.

Followed as written, except added more cilantro b/c we love it. Did not see how toasting the chilies helped them much, they were still hard as rocks so I took another cook's suggestion and put them in some warm water to soften them up before putting them into the food processor. Husband said it's the best new recipe I've made in over a year, and I make a lot of new ones :)

Terrific Chili! well received by my diners. I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of using Ancho Chili Powder in place of whole dried Anchos and Pimenton Dulce in place of regular Chili Powder (Pimenton Dulce added smokiness without adding heat). I served it Cincinnati style over elbow macaroni with sour cream, raw red onions and grated White Cheddar as condiments. Mmmmmmm!

Very good. I just used canned adobe chilis, added 1 c more stock, Extra garlic, and can of hot red kidney beans. To save time, used roasted chicken. Put pepper cheese and sour cream on top!

Rating: 4
The anchos give this a smoky flavor, the cashews & chocolate make it satiny & rich. I omit the kidney beans (I have to avoid them) and it is still delicious. I double the recipe and freeze a portion of it. Perfect results.

Delicious chili. I have made this twice so far and plan to make it many more times. Following the recipe exactly yielded good results, however, I haven't been able to discern much 'kick' in the ancho chillies so next time I will use some chipotle chilies.

Rating: 4
What a terrific recipe. The only thing I would change: next time I will blend the cashews more finely. A suggestion: after toasting/seeding the ancho chilis, I suggest soaking them in hot water for 10 minutes prior to blending them. It makes it much easier!

I feel the need to remind everyone that the point of a chili cookoff is to enter an ORIGINAL recipe. It's pretty much cheating to use something you found online. Even if it is as delicious as this one.

Meh. Didn't find this recipe to be as spectacular as others seem to have. I followed the recipe with the exception of the chilis. I couldn't find dried anchos so used dried habaneros (not knowing much about relative spicyness of peppers). After cutting them up and blending them with the cashews and broth, I accidentally touched my nose which then essentially lit on fire. This caused me to second-guess my choice of peppers. I had to salvage the recipe since I had committed to a pot-luck cook-off. So I only used half of the puree. I'm glad I did because the level of spice is perfect. Otherwise, the chili is pretty boring. I expected the ingredients would result in a complex and layered flavour (chocolate? How could that not be good?). The chicken looked awesome when I shredded it off the bones. I feel like the cumin is overpowering and I would cut back on it next time. (Otherwise, I find it hard to believe that halving the puree could result in such a difference in flavour from what other cooks have experienced.) Who knows, I may have to re-post if I for some reason win the competition!

Corrections to last review. I meant drumsticks and thighs and actually Bell and Evans chicken.

Well received by my entire family. I would not go with canned chilies. That would make it a different recipe and risks being too spicy for many people. Any dried medium hot large chili pods will do. Also I do not get all the fuss over the chicken. 1.5 lbs or even a little more of Allen Brothers legs and thighs and be done with it!

When my husband read the recipe his comment was "well, we'll see". After tasting it he was more on the level of man, is this good! I did like some others and used chipolte chilis in adobo. We like spicy food and I used two whole chilis. It was almost too spicy. Next time I'm going to cut that back to 1 1/2. This is going to be a keeper. Delicious and easy!

I've made a LOT of chili recipes (the official state dish of Texas!)and my fiance is usually strongly against putting beans in any chili, but even he absolutely LOVED this one with black beans and chicken! It's such a great variation on traditional chili con carne, it's unique and just superbly delicious. The puree of chiles and cashews was amazing in this recipe. I used a few more chiles than called for just because we like it extra spicy, and I always run the pureed chiles through a food mill or sieve first to remove unblended skin and seeds, then I put that back in the blender to puree with the cashews and broth. Can't wait to make this again, it's easy and fun to make and absolutely outstanding.

I made this again for my school's chili cookoff and won 1st prize. For all you saying it's a hard, time consuming recipe, here are some time savers I use. Use canned chipotles in adobo and dump them into the blender with the broth and cashews. No cooking. Buy roasted chicken from the store and just debone it, throw the meat in after the spices. It is just throwing things in and letting them cook after that. My family loves this recipe, even my picky kids. Nice on a crisp fall day!

This has been a terrific go to recipe. My entire family devours this chili. I think it's because the kids found out it had chocolate. I have yet to find fresh coriander sprigs, but have found the recipe doesn't lack if it's not included. Like other readers, I tried a can of adobo chilis...way too hot for my family. This time, I'm going to try 1/4 can for a little heat, but more flavor. I am a pretty straightforward, simple cook and putting gloves on for the dried anchos is not my idea of fun. I would most likely end up with chili in my eyes instead of the chili...canned for me! This chili also freezes tremendously well. I do not add the last cashews to the frozen batch. Some may find the beans a bit soft after freezing and want to add them after thawing. I have found that they tend to combine with the overall flavor and adds to the taste in a way that compensates for a less pleasing texture.

Rating: 4
Exceptional. Kept the heat minimal & went for smokiness with the addition of smoked paprika. Skipped the chocolate, used pink & black beans-- most of which I blended in to decrease the brothy texture & achieve more of a stew consistency--& only had dried coriander on hand but still reached a sublime result.

I've reviewed once before, but I had to review again. The first time I made this chili I used chipotle chilis in adobo instead of the anchos. The second time, I used the anchos and followed the recipe exactly. It was SO much better with the anchos. If you are going to make this, I suggest taking the time to find and use the anchos. Love this chili!

This was really delicious! I changed it a bit b/c I couldn't easily find Ancho chilis. I used chipotle chilis in adobo. I also had roasted a chicken a few days ago, so I just used the meat from that. In all, it took about 45 minutes of prep/cooking time! I'm already looking forward to the leftovers!

I had high hopes for this dish when I read the recipe. Alas, it was too fussy to make and I couldn't get it hot enough for my liking with the ancho chilies. I did add other peppers but still couldn't get it hot. Back to my amazing Turkey Chili recipe (also from Epicurious).

In place of the anchos, I used pablano chilis from my garden, roasted and stored in my freezer. Excellent recipe. My family is begging me to make it again already.

This was a delicious, unique chili. The flavors melded together really well. I took the advice of the others, and followed this recipe very closely. My changes: I tripled all ingredients (except the chicken) as I needed a large amount for a chili cook-off. To give you an idea of the yield, it made enough to fill my 5.5 qt. crock pot. I subbed Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce for the Anchos - they provided a nice smoky flavor and made this dish spicy! I used about 3.5 lbs. of skinned, bone- in legs, thighs and breasts for the chicken, and I used black beans instead of kidney. Those with a daring pallete really liked this, as did I. Alas, I did not win the competition, but I will be making this again.

Rating: 4
So, I decided to make this chili after seeing my (awesome) vegetarian chili fall out of chili cook-off contention year after year due to a pervasive prejudice against vegetarian chili. And, my friends, I don't mind telling you that this recipe finally netted me my long-coveted blue ribbon. I added honey, coffee, cocoa powder and about 20 oz. of stout. Also worth noting: I used roasted poblanos in the puree and subbed canned adobo-marinated chipotle peppers for chili powder.

Rating: 4
Made this twice. Recipe is excellent as-is; however, for me it's a little too time consuming for what's typically a "one pot" meal. Also, finding ancho chilies isn't always easy. Second time, I made a more simple version which we thought was equally as good. I used ground turkey, and canned 'Chipotle Peppers in Adobo'-- something I can find easily at the regular grocery. The chipotle's smokey flavor blends well with the chocolate and cashews. I blended one pepper at a time with the cashews and broth until I got the heat I wanted.

Rating: 4
I made this for a chili cook-off & won 3rd place. I am fairly competitive, so 3rd isn't great in my opinion, but I had some stiff competition. I made a double-batch & followed the recipe with a few exceptions. 1. I used a 7oz can of chipotles in adobo sauce as well as a small can of fire-roasted green chilis in the puree. 2. I substituted beer for half of the chicken stock volume. 3. I skinned my bone-in chicken breasts/thighs before cooking them. 4. I used 1 can of white beans & 1 can of black beans rather than kidney for color variation. 5. I did not add cashew pieces at the end - all the cashews went into the puree. I loved this chili! It was pretty labor-intensive so when I make it again, I will make at least a quadruple batch.

I'd been looking for a different chili recipe than my usual, and thought this sounded intriguing. It was really delicious. For ease, I substituted 1 chipotle chili from a can for the ancho in the puree with great results. Since my husband and I are "spice-wimps", I would cut down the chipotle amount by half next time, but that's just our taste. I used skinless, boneless chicken thigh cutlets and substituted black beans for the kidney beans. The only ingredient I did not use was the 1/2 cup of cashews at the end -- by the time the recipe called for them to be added, I felt the chili didn't need them due to its consistency. I added about 3/4 cup of additional chicken broth at the end because the chili was getting too thick, and that made the consistency perfect. Added a dollop of sour cream and chopped fresh cilantro to each serving and served with cornbread on the side.Because I used boneless chicken, it was super fast beginning to end -- a great last minute meal for after work on a weekday or even a weekend football game. Definitely my new go-to chili recipe for awhile!

After making this recipe I was actually compelled to write my first comment. I made this exactly as written (substituting a chipotle chili for the ancho), even using measuring spoons for the spices and weighing the chicken. I used roasted/salted cashews, and rinsed them to remove some salt before pureeing. I added more cashews a few minutes before serving, lightly chopping so they weren't whole, but they were still nice big chunks. The only flaw with this recipe is that there were no leftovers. The flavors are rich and complex, and yet worked so nicely together. The chicken cooked in the puree is saturated with flavor. So many recipes are 'a nice starting point' as long as the cook uses some creativity to add some spunk. But this recipe is the whole package. Sure, you can add some spunk if it suits you, but this recipe can respectably stand on its own. There it is. My first review.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I used chipotle chilis in adobo sauce for the puree (about half a can) and also added in some minced green chilis. Used 28 oz of diced tomatoes and chicken thighs. I found it needed sugar and salt at the end.

I made a Vegan version of this and it was AMAZING, not very spicy, but wonderful flavor. Just sub 1 package shredded seitan for the chicken, and use veg broth. I used 1 can pinto and 1 can black beans instead of kidney. And I didn't have the chilies, so I used 1 tsp Piment Fort. Lastly, i did not have the canned tomatoes, so I used 3 shopped fresh tomatoes. This made 4 large servings which I offered with tortilla chips. Tasted much like Red Bones White Chicken Chili, without the cheese of course!

I made this last weekend and also won a chili cookoff with it. Since I live in Kinshasa in the Congo, I had to do some substitutions, but it was a really fine chili. It strikes me that the cashew paste used is an Indian curry technique. Whoever put this recipe together brought together a number of traditions blended from world cuisines. It's works, it's complex, it's rich, it's satisfying, it's unique. I'll be making it again.

I'm liking this a lot, especially the simple technnique. I used a sparing tablespoon of chilis in adobo for the puree and would use more next time. Also added lots of corn and plan on garnishing with lime slices. I love reading the variations and can tell this will be fun to play with.

I made this chili for a chili cookoff contest at work. It tied for first place against a more traditional beef, red bean chili. We had the leftovers for dinner with friends and they all loved it too. I would definitely make this again and I am a die hard beef chili fan.

I've seen this online a bunch of times, but finally decided to make it tonight. It was really good! I will make again -- and soon.

I made this chili this past weekend and won a chili cookoff with it. I did make some changes...used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added roasted corn (frozen corn roasted on the grill) two cans of tomatoes, about a cup of beer, a little wine, adobe chiles and sauce instead of the chilis they called for and jalapeno chilis as well, along with various dashes of tabasco and other hot sauces and liquid smoke that I had on hand. I think the corn really added to it and make sure you add the cashews at the very end - I doubled the amount called for, esp if made ahead because otherwise the cashews get soft(I let it "sit" for 2 days and then re- evaluated what needed to be added to make it better). For extra smokey flavor I put it in a heavy duty pan and let it sit on a charcoal grill with hickory chips for about an hour. This really is a great recipe with some "doctoring up".

Oh, sweet Chicken Cashew Chili, it's been far too long since my last experience and review. Folks, this is a great chili. It looks like hell. But the flavour combinations are aboslutely great. This time, I made it exactly as instructed (although I threw in the whole 28oz can of tomatoes, and I used a guadalijio chile instead of ancho), and it is great. What an awesome dish.

I've made this probably ten times and counting in maybe 2 years. It's so good. Usually I double the recipe, use a whole can of chipotle chilis in adobo for the puree (instead of the dried ancho chilis or the suggested sub of red bell pepper) with chicken stock (or beer, sometimes) and that's it, then add a bunch of cashews at the end instead of in the puree too. I also have used every variety of beans imaginable and they're all good. Oh, I've quadrupled the recipe, too, to freeze for later. Yummy, yum. Fantastic recipe.

Was it Freud who said, "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar." Well, so it is with chili.

Nothing more, nothing less.

Outstanding! I was a little hesitant about a chili with cashews and chocolate, but that turned out to be one of those flavor combinations that just really works. Anchos, cashews and hot chicken broth blended together in my blender came out with the most enticing texture and aroma I've seen on a chili. I used black beans and increased the proportion of white meat. Served piping hot with corn bread muffins and blanched fresh broccoli. Just too bad there was no beer in the house!

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe and it still wasn't enough for 7 adults. All the chefs in the family asked for the recipe. I found this recipe on another site and followed its quantity/ingredient list.

All hail the chocolate! I couldn't find dried ancho chilies but found other dried chilies - very small (less than 1/4 inch long) - and decided to go with five of them. Also added potatoes, because I felt like the dish needed a little more on the vegetable side. The result: awesome! The blend of flavours - the cumin/chili powder along with the chili/chocolate/cilantro mix is perfect. If only it presented better! (it turns out looking a little like a dog's breakfast - shredded meat + stock/cashew blend does not look like the sort of thing you'd serve your boss. Still, for a winter night at home - to die for!)

I've rated this recipe before and found it a tad bland, but I tried it again, with ground beef, and no cashews or beans. I meant to put cashews in the paste, however, but didn't have any so I used raw almonds instead, and it worked out great. This time around, it was MUCH better, my husband said it didn't even taste like the same recipe, and it was MUCH easier to make. Definitely a keeper with these variations. To echo others' sentiments...it is not that spice, so add your favorite hot spice.

And i would not cheat and use boneless/skinless, because it tasted so great done exactly as written (although i did accidentally use only half the chocolate because i doubled the recipie and forgot to double the chocolate. it seemed plenty chocolaty to me...)

I have been makin this recipe since it was published and it is a standard. It is great for a party since it is not super spicy but has a rich flavor. My toddler loved it.

Made this with all the spices, plus chipotles and added some of the adobo sauce, plus I doubled the spices, and for some reason it still wasnt spicy!

I made this for the second time recently and just had some leftovers for lunch. The first time I made it, I only had chicken breasts, which came out fine. This time, I used skinless legs and thighs, which also came out very tasty. I also like slightly more heat in my chili than this recipe provides (though I was using the roasted red pepper and crushed pepper substitution) so I added about 1/2 t of Cayenne while it was cooking. I thought the recipe made well over two servings even though we're generous-portion eaters.

LOVED this w/couple of exceptions to the recipe: used chicken breast only, boiled first & shredded. Also, I thought the cashews in the puree were plenty & didn't add the chopped to the chili--thought it would be cashew overkill. It's VERY spicy at first but the addition of the chocolate mellows it. Also added white beans instead of kidney. And more garlic. Try this!

I've made this recipe at least four or five times a year for the last five years. It's fantastic. Be careful multiplying the ingredients - you don't need that much chicken broth. I suggest adding some canned chipotle peppers or red pepper flakes to improve the spiciness. This one is perfect for chilly fall days.

I was surprised that I didn't care much for this recipe. It was nothing special and the cashews didn't add much, at least on day one. After sitting for a day, the cashews mellowed in texture and got much more interesting. But for all the trouble it was, I probably won't bother again.

What did I do wrong? After all the good reviews, I thought this would be great. But it was just awful! It had a very muddy taste, the cashews (not the ones in the chili paste) added nothing and ended up with a funky texture, and it was just way too greasy, even after I skimmed what grease I could off the top. I would reccommend to anyone making this recipe to take the skin off the chicken before you add it in.

One word for this recipe - YUMMMMMY. I changed a couple of things because of sales at the market. I used savory organic chicken sausage, and black-eyed peas instead of kidney beans. It was a hit.

This is a Sunday night staple in our house. We have made it again and again and it is always tasty. Sometimes I use toasted pumpkin seeds instead of the cashews for a change. Make sure to use bone in chicken--don't try any shortcuts!

A definite keeper, this dish really "wowed" us. I served it with sour cream, cilantro, and extra cashews on the side--the selection of condiments made this a fun dinner. I threw some chipotle peppers into the purée just for fun, and the results were great.

This was really good, but not quite "wow." I think my modifications made a difference. I used only boneless chicken breasts (and cut the amount back by about 25%, which was a good idea), and I think this made the dish less rich & flavorful. I'll use the darker & bone-in meat next time (but I'm not sure I could bring myself to let the skin cook along with everything else--I have a grease phobia!). I also couldn't find ancho chilis but did find fresh poblano...so I dried them in the oven, and they may have lost some flavor through my inexpert methods. I also think I might use crushed tomatoes next time instead of the diced for more of an intense tomato flavor disbursed throughout the dish. But it was good anyway; I just wanted more of an intensity of flavor.

We all liked this but found it different from our usual chili recipes. Much milder in taste. I agree with the reviewer who suggested a little less chicken. Had difficulty finding ancho chiles and drove to a town about 25 miles away to a little Mexican grocer to get them. The cashews added a nice flavor.

Absolutely wonderful alternative to a typical chili. Served with warm tortillas. Primo stuff

One of the best recipes I have ever had. I serve heated tortillas with it.

Excellent!! Very different, but absolutely fantastic. I heeded advice from other reviewers and cut back on the chicken--a very good idea. (Actually I doubled everything else except the chicken.) I served over corn bread with sour cream. Super.

Wow! This was really good! I made it with bonless skinless chicken breasts,red beans instead of kidney(I detest kidney beans), and left out the chili powder because I couldn't find the huge freakin' jar of it I have somewhere in this house......even my 4 and 5 yr olds ate it, and that's saying something! Thick, rich and delicious.

Not traditional but excellent nonetheless. Used white beans instead of kidney.

I love this recipe! I've made it numerous times, and every time I serve it to my friends they go crazy over it. To me it's like a blending of curry sauce and mole. I usually double up on the chili powder, and serve it with rice.

This dish was excellent, although, I think chili is a misnomber. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and shredded them into larger pieces than called for. I also doubled the chocolate. I think this has more of the taste of a mole than a chili. Served with warm tortillas.

This was an okay recipe. I used chicken breast for the meat. I may have used too much, it was very thick. My kids liked it the second day wrapped in flour tortilla shells. I like my traditional chili recipe, so don't know if I'll make this one again

I can't imagine what people were thinking when they expressed their pleasure in this recipe. My family thought this was a disgusting concoction. The first bite seems ok, then as you proceed through the dish, your taste buds let you know that this is not something you really want to eat. This is the worst of all the recipes I have tried on Epicurious. My first recipe from here that makes my NEVER MAKE THIS AGAIN list. Awful! I'll continue using my own chili recipe in the future.

I won 3rd place in our annual family chili cookoff with this excellent recipe. I made it two days ahead and should have waited to add the cashews until just before serving as they were soft. Otherwise, it was perfect.

This was delicious - especially the next day. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and unsalted roasted cashews. Spiced it up a little with some hot sauce and served with sour cream and biscuits.

This chili looked absolutely unappetizing. HOWEVER! It was also the most incredible tasting chicken chili i have ever tried and made. My boyfriend took one step in to my apartment and had to stop and moan over the fantastic smell of cooking chili. I doubled the recipe and did not have enough to feed 6 hungry men at a poker party. I will definitely be making this again. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, about 3 lbs. Could not find ancho chilis so did the red bell pepper and crushed red pepper substitute and used pinto beans. Thick, rich and yummee!

The skeptics were blown away with this fantastic one-pot dinner. Double the chicken for the meat lovers and add lots of cashew pieces (they're cheaper) for texture. I doubled the recipe for a crowd of 15 and did not have enough.

Excellent. I have made this several times and the flavours are wonderful. I buy boneless thighs with skin on. I remove the skin but don't bother shredding the meat. It's less chili-like this way, but we prefer the texture of the meat.

excellent

Delicious, with a few slight alterations... black beans instead of kidney beans, fire roasted tomatoes, 2T. of Dean and Deluca's Chili Powder Blend instead of 1 tsp. chili powder, and 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper to kick up the heat a little more, all served on white California long grain rice.

This is a great dish. Wonderful flavor. Spicy and not too hot. Easy to make, not too time consuming. I would use de-boned chicken in the future to make it easier. I did use pintos instead of kidney beans. Personal preferance. It goes into my file for future dinner parties.

Excellent. Pretty easy to make, and very tasty. I didn't add the beans, and we felt nothing was missing. I made the version with the red bell pepper, and it was quite wonderful. Definitely will make again!

The flavors mixed with subtle, spicy elegance. Wow your friends during the next potluck. I did, and handed the recipe to three people. Perfect!

This was pretty good even when it was made with all white meat. I will make it again.

Wow - what a great dish! I did change a few things, some out of necessity, others for preference...I used 11/2-2 # of ckn breasts, on the bone and essentially doubled all the spice ingredients, including the choholate(for a richness), and also the beans. I added a few shots (1-2 T) of Dave's Insanity Taco Sauce, to add some flavored heat. YUM! This wil definitley become a regular here at our house.

Excellent recipe - my husband loved it. I doubled the recipe and it made at least six servings. The only thing that's a bit tedious is removing the chicken meat from the bones and shredding it, but it was worth it.

I have made this recipe several times. It is just as good with white meat chicken as with dark meat and it is also good with other meats. This is one that is in my permanent recipe box.

The chicken cashew chili is delicious by itself or served over rice. I add extra chili peppers to make it even spicier. This is a great dish to make ahead of time and reheat.

I doubt if I will make regular ground beef chili ever again! A superb combination. I used chicken thighs (skinned) and tomato juice instead of tinned tomatoes and served it garnished with sour cream and cornbread on the side. My husband is inviting his chili fanatics so he can get it served up again!

This chili is wonderful. You can use boneless breasts to cut fat, but the bones add so much flavor. I serve it on a bed of hot steaming Texmati rice. A simple plate of sliced oranges, cools the chili.

awsome, drizzle with a line of habanero sauce, and garnich wih some fresh chopped cilantro. Perfect for a cozy evening at home with that extra special someone.
