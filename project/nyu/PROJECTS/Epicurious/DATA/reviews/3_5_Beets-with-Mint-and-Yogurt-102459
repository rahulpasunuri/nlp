A great, simple recipe! I love it with cilantro instead of mint, and eat it with pita chips/bread or alongside Indian dishes. Warning: do NOT think you will "save time" by putting everything in the food processor and giving it a whirl. Doing so makes the mixture too watery. We think the color is awesome!

Delicious, if an alarming color. One of my favorite beet recipes. Sometimes I substitute cilantro for mint. Goes well with Indian curries.

My husband and I love beets and we think this is really delicious! I guess the only issue I have is, what do you eat it with?

I used greek yogurt and added pine nuts for texture, and skipped the garlic/oil thing - all which gave it a more mediterranean feel than Indian. I was hesitant about the cayenne but it absolutely makes the dish - gives it a flavor you can't quite identify. I would definitely make it again this way.

I used lowfat water buffalo yogurt and beets from the farmer's market and added a pinch of ground milk thistle seed with the pepper. My housemate and I both thought it was delicious! Sweeter than I would have imagined. I set out to make something nice and light, yet this dish tasted very rich.

I love beets but, but I didn't really care for this recipe. My husband thought it was good, but too sweet to accompany curry. Maybe it would be better to use yellow beets, like one of the reviewers mentioned. This recipe was worth the try though.

We very much like Madhur Jaffrey's recipes and own one of her cookbooks. But this recipe is not good--neither of us could eat it. The color was the least of the problem.

Might I suggest trying golden beets -- you can sometimes find them at farmers markets.

I have made this dish a number of times and find it goes beautifully with any Indian meal (for which a yogurt dish is an essential accompaniment). Some of my friends have had adverse reactions to it, but these are mainly people who do not love beets. Those who love beets tend to love this dish.

This is really delicious, but here's the caveat: it will polarize your eating companions like nothing else. For some, it's the color, for others, the mint. I've made this for several groups where I'm the only person who likes it. I keep making it, though...

I'm not the most passionate beet-eater in the world, but this is absolutely delicious. Madhur Jaffrey's recipes have completely won me over to Indian cooking!

I thought this tasted fine, although the color really is off-putting. My husband ate quite a bit and then told me not to make it again. I think if it had been an edible looking color he probably would have like it fine.
