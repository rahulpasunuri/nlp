My first attempt with soybean sprouts. I wasn't too sure if I liked it at first, but once the flavors married, it was delicious. I like to combine these sprouts with other vegetables. Very satisfying.

Great banchan or salad garnish, and quick to make! I started with 1 tsp each of the salt and sesame oil (dark) and found that was enough, particularly because I roasted my own sesame seeds and that brought out a nice flavor. Korean chili powder (or possibly Japanese togarashi as another reader mentioned) is the only way to go. Yum.

For the third recipe, instead of this one it seems to be better to introduce pan-fried "Jeon." I miss "Tok-gook".

I didn't have chili oil or Thai basil so I used ground chili powder and fresh Genoa basil instead. It worked out well, I would definitely make it again.

The way my family has always made this dish is: remove the root from the sprouts, rinse, drain, put it in a pot, cover it, and turn the stove on around medium. Don't add any additional water, the water from the rinsing as well as the water in the bean sprouts is enough to steam it. Pay attention to it, don't take the cover off until you start to smell it cooking. That's probably the point it's done. Take it off the heat, taste for doneness, definitely don't want to burn it. Throw in fresh garlic (if this is too intense you can slice garlic and throw it in before steaming), scallion, sesame, salt, crushed Korean red pepper flakes (not cayenne, not the kind on pizzas), and sesame oil. Yum!

A little bland. I used crushed chilies and added a dash of rice vinegar to liven it up a bit.

Good but make sure you're not using the mexican-style chile powder, which contains cumin and oregano. You want to use a pure chile for a bit of heat--cayenne pepper, korean hot pepper, or Japanese Togarashi. The imprecision in the recipe could make a BIG mess!
