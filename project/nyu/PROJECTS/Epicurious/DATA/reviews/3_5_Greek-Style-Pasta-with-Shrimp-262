This was tastier than I expected. So easy, so delicious. I added 1 tsp red pepper chili flakes and reduced the amount of cheese a little. Will keep as a staple recipe.

This was middle-of-the-road for me. Perfectly fine and easy to throw together, but unmemorable. I added some salt-cured black olives to pump up the flavor a little bit, but it still felt like it was missing something. Probably won't revisit this one.

I didn't add any salt because of a sodium restriction and I like spicy so I added crushed red paper. I also added mint as suggested by one reviewer. This was fast, fresh, and very tasty. I also think this would ben excellent chilled.

So simple and delish. Did not add the artichock hearts, as I didn't have any on hand but the results were great. Perfect served chilled or room temp on a hot evening.

Served the Pasta and Shrimp to the Poker Guys and most of them said it needed more olives and or more tomato. We remade it and added more of the Olive oil, Tomato, and Olives, and it worked a bit better. All in all a great party dish and or a light dinner plate.

Good. Nice combination of flavors. Very easy to prepare. The shrimp cooked a little too long in this recipe. If I make this again, I'll remove the shrimp after thirty or forty seconds of cooking, and add them back in after the feta has melted. I'd make the "sauce" smoother--less grainy feeling--if I could, but I don't know how to do that with all that feta in there. I'll try this again.

This is absolutely fabulous. Easy. Pretty. Worthy of a dinner party. I will make it again, definitely!!

This was a delicious and easy recipe. A little "mis en place" really helped...having all the ingredients prepped and lined up was important because everything, including the angelhair, cooks so quickly. The feta I had planned to use was past its prime, so I substituted goat cheese, which gave it creamier texture.

This was fantastic. I will definitely try this again with more vegies! We served it without the shrimp, even though I desperately wanted to, and it was sublime. The cheese broke up nicely and the addition of milk with less oil made it very smooth. Thank you!

Very good, but next time I will add 1 cup of tomatoes instead of the 1/2 suggested, as well as some Greek olives. Finally, make sure you cook the pasta ahead of time or the mixture gets a little gooey.

excellent and easy. i only used 1/2 feta and added it last. this is exceptional

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this very much. It was so easy to make after a long day at work, I appreciate that it comes together so fast. I followed the advice of a previous cook and added about 1/4 chicken broth to make it a little saucier. I also used only a tablespoon of olive oil. I served this over whole wheat pasta, leaving out the feta until the dish was on the table.

Rating: 4
I added about a cup of asparagus, cut into 1" lengths; doubled the tomatoes; and added about 1/2 cup of cream right before tossing. Next time I'll barely cook the shrimp, then remove it and put it back at the very end. It was overcooked. Otherwise this was incredibly good.

Husband said he didn't like artichokes- but he loved this dish. Only change I made was throwing in some frozen spinach and extra tomato. Can't wait to make it this summer with fresh tomatoes. A definite keeper!

Rating: 4
I added the black olives and the crushed red pepper, but in order to get more of a sauce I added white wine and chicken stock (instead of cream to keep the calories down). Next time I would not seed the tomatoes, in order to add more juice to the mix. I would also add the shrimp in last, I found them to be overcooked. Overall GREAT dish!!! PS. You can make this dish with pretty much any fish, shellfish, and even chicken.

Fab recipe. BUT, needs zest of one lemon to up flavor without tartness and up to 1 & 1/2 cup milk or cream or chicken stock. Feta does not melt well and needs LOTS more liquid to stay creamy. You will LOVE this recipe.

Great, easy dish. Doubling the recipe for my larger crowd produced too much pasta and it was hard to blend the pasta with the other ingredients. Next time, I would either make two batches or just increase the non-pasta ingredients.

I have made this recipe twice - once almost as written (I used marinated artichokes instead of canned) and then a second time. Most recently I used the canned artichokes, increased the garlic, used canned diced tomatoes with juice instead of the fresh, added 2 t. oregano and 1 t. basil, and added 2 T. of capers. These changes made it more flavorful and created more sauce for the pasta. And the recipe remained an easy weeknight dish that is good enough for company.

This was really nice, a great spring\summer pasta recipe. I used penne and extra galic, with a splash of cream at the end just to make it a tad more saucy. I really like sauce.

I having been using this site for the past 2 months now with wonderful results. This recipe looked great and the reviews were excellent, but unless I did something really wrong it was one of the worst I have tried. I usually try new recipes when there is just my husband and I, but I tried this one with company because all of the other recipes have been so good. Also I followed some the advice of the other reviewers(adding extra tomatoes). Not sure what happened. Sorry for making my first review so long.

This was just the ticket for a tasty dinner to whip up in 30 min. The only addition I made was Half a red onion. Also I put only half the feta in to cook with the shrimp, it melts into a wonderful creamy sauce. I put the remaining half on top to serve. Delicious. I almost always have these ingredients on hand and just LOVE greek food so I'm sure I'll be making this again.

My husband, friend & I loved this dish. I was repeatedly complimented on this dish. It is so easy too! I do recommend that the feta is rinced to reduce the salt level. I used Marjoram instead of oregano and doubled the tomatoes. I plan to make this again soon and often.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic, and easy to make. I followed the recipe pretty close, however I did use dried parsley & oregano, and penne pasta. My husband loved it! He even thanked me again in the morning for making such a great dinner. Next time I make it I will use an extra tablespoon of lemon juice for extra zip and try the suggested fettucine noodles. The penne was great, but I don't think the sauce coated it as well as it would with fettucine. I used canned artichokes in water. Reading some past reviews I think others have used the ones marinated in oil, which might throw the flavor off (and fat content). This recipe is definetly a keeper. I can't understand how some people found it bland. Feta, garlic and lemon - how could you go wrong?

Rating: 4
OUTSTANDING! I followed the recipe exactly. This is an attractive, easy to prepare dish with a lot of interesting odors and flavors.

This dish was quick and easy. I used slightly less feta than called for in the recipe and I didn't find it to heavy or salty. In addition, I increased the amount of garlic and garnished with a few kalamata olives, which lent a nice flavor. I served it with a Greek salad, French bread and some Greek wine and had store-bought baklava for desert. A great weeknight meal!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and everyone loved it (once for a luncheon with my mother and visiting aunties, and if THEY approved, it must be good). I loved it too, until I was stricken with a stomach virus the day after I had this for dinner and eversince I've had an aversion to feta cheese and artichokes! So sad... I really liked this recipe too. Oh well, I can't eat it, but I do pass the recipe on.

This dish is very tasty and would make a good "company" meal. Easy enough to do on an everyday basis, though. I used about half the amount of artichokes, and added some roasted red pepper. Also added white wine. Garnished with a little parm and extra feta (just a little). Good stuff.

This dish is so so. I found it a little bland, like something was missing. I added some green onions and mushrooms, which improved it slightly, but not enough to make it again.

Beautiful and delicious. The only changes I made were to use just a tad less garlic (I live in a small apartment and can often smell my dinner 3 days after I cook it), 3/4 c. of the small grape tomatoes, fresh feta and pasta, and only 1 c. of the artichokes, just because I didn't want to open the second jar. Next time I will use the full amount of artichokes. This pasta was absolutely wonderful, just how I like to eat in the summer. Served it with the baby green salad with strawberry dressing, also great and also on this site. My mom and my BF loved it as well, and it was great cold for lunch with my boss the next day. It is recipes like this that keep me coming back to Epicurious!

I picked this recipe to make for a friend who loves artichokes, and he says it's now his favorite. I've made it twice now, with excellent results both times. The first time I used a French goat's milk feta which worked really well -- kind of halfway between chêvre and feta. Also, tossing individual servings works _much_ better than tossing it all at once.

I love this recipe. Only had slightly more than one cup of feta on hand. My only problem was that the angel hair quickly soaked up any juices and was slightly dry. Next time will try linguine or less angel hair for same amount of ingredients and take the suggestion of doubling tomato. Over all, this is a delicious, fast and easy recipe.
