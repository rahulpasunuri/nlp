Very good but very labor intensive. I'm glad to hear it freezes well. Mine wasn't salty at all; I had to add quite a bit...maybe it depends on the ham. I left out the mustard greens and watercress and doubled the spinach. I'll try all the greens next time.

Not as good as I expected. A bunch of hot sauce helped, but just not a lot of depth of flavor.

This was very good and not too much work using bagged pre-washed greens. I needed to add more broth (maybe because I only made 1/4 recipe). The rice was surprisingly flavorful - I would use the rice recipe again for other occasions.

On the good side, this is pretty tasty and I assume it's healthy, but man, it takes so much time and effort to make. Also, it's super salty - I don't know if I did something wrong, but assuming I didn't, I would suggest that that you use low sodium broth to make it.

A winter staple at our house. Labor intensive, yes, but it makes a lot and it freezes beautifully. We cooked, minced ham hock meat and some cooked, crumbled Italian sausage. Any smokey meat diced fine would do the trick.

Used cubed ham, rich soup but very heart warming on a winter day. With the rice and ham it is definitely a full meal. Everyone took seconds!

We really enjoyed this dish, but I drastically underestimated the prep time I'd need to make it. All of the greens used in this recipe are the sort that you need to rinse MANY times to remove all traces of sand and grit. Given the quantity of greens needed, this took MUCH longer than I planned for. Given this, it is well worth it to make the full recipe and have some to freeze! It's a bit labor intensive, but I'd do it all over again...just with a bit better planning. :)

A nice change of pace from regular gumbo! I've seen this type of gumbo before but never tried it. Asked my deli person to cut me a chunk of smoked turkey and cubed it instead of the ham as we don't eat pork. Omitted the file powder as my Whole Foods surprisingly didn't have it & I didn't have time to go elsewhere. This makes a LOT, I froze quite a bit. Didn't bother with the perfect rice; seems like overkill given how nice regular rice is as a foil to the full flavors of the soup. The brilliance here is pureeing the greens. Other recipes (eg Commander's Palace) have you boil the greens and then add them to a roux sauteed w/ onions, celery, and green peppers. I think that would not go over well w/ my family. Overall, hearty and warming yet lighter than a traditional gumbo, plus you have to feel virtuous eating all those greens! Excellent, and a definite make again.
