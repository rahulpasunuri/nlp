This is a healthful and relatively simple dish to make. It is a bit bland as written, but has true potential without much fuss. Made it as directed, with just the following changes: double the black pepper, nearly double the salt,and add a drizzle of olive oil and juice of one lemon at the end, then use an equivalent amount of parm on top. The lemon juice brightens and brings out the earthier & green flavors, while complementing the caramelized onion.

For me the flavors didn't blend. And, aside from the onion, there wasn't much flavor to begin with.

Ehhh....left a lot to be desired flavor-wise. I wouldn't make it again without making some modifications. I would reduce the onions for a start.

BOOOOOOORING. Little flavor, even though I added more garlic and cheese.

I really liked this recipe b/c it had more spinach and lentils compared to versions I've ordered in restaurants but it was just as fresh tasting. I had about 6C of onions in total and it took about 10min covered and 30min uncovered to finally get them brown. I did as a previous reviewer suggested and added salt (1/2t) with the onions to make them sweat faster. Next time I'm going to cook uncovered the whole time and maybe use a higher heat. Other than that, I followed the recipe except I added 1/4t of salt with the lentils and I didn't need the pasta water for the spinach. They were a bit wet from washing and the lentils/pasta add some water as well.

I made this for dinner tonight and am already looking forward to making it a second time. Next time, I will cut back on the onions by half, and add a few extra handfuls of spinach. I may also substitute toasted pine nuts for the cheese to make it vegan.

The ingredients reminded me of a mid-East recipe (mujuddara - caramelized onions with bulgur wheat and lentils), so I added some crumbled felafel. Awesome! Make sure you caramelize the onions so they are a medium brown (keep stirring over medium high heat, and add water to deglaze the pan). I added the spinach, lentils and 6 crumbled felafel patties (size of a meatball) to the onions, then stirred that into the cooked pasta. Add the cheese (I used an aged provolone - less salty than the feta. My husband loved it and is looking forward to the leftovers! This is definitely a keeper. BTW, we had a Barolo (Nebbiola grapes) with this and it totally rocked.

This was fantastic! A small sprinkle of Parm. definitely brings out all the flavors. Next time I make it though (and there will be MANY next times) I will time it so that the pasta is done cooking after all the other ingredients are ready; I think this is the key to getting the spinach wilted. I must say, even though I love feta I don't think I would add it to this dish. It might overwhelm the balance of flavors.

Good call on the feta. I added some in my bowl. I didn't use baby spinach but leaves that were exceptionally big and thick, almost like chard, so I wilted them after removing the onion from the pan. I can see this becoming a mainstay and a great side dish pot luck item.

This recipe has real potential, but it's not there yet, not even with the red pepper. I found it a little bland, but it's very close to being wonderful. Excellent texture, healthy, easy. I'd love to hear more ideas on additions, while keeping it vegetarian.

I really like this, and it made a ton, which is great for lunches. I think I would cut back on the onion, maybe use 2 instead of 3 onions. Also, I crumbled feta on top (in addition to the parm), which was DELICIOUS.

I tried the onion/spinach/pasta mixture on its own and thought, "Hmm, fine, but unremarkable." But THEN! I added the lentils. Ohhh the lentils. It was like all the other ingredients were at a party, and it was fun, but then, The Lentils showed up and everyone was like, "The Lentils are here!!!" and all the flavors woke up and partied. I'm going to invite The Lentils to many more of my parties, those people bring the delicious.

I found that adding the cup of pasta water did not wilt the spinach. The next time I made it I sauteed the spinach and olive oil to wilt it, and that came out better. Even my husband likes this one!

This is incredibly good. Admittedly, I am a fan of spinach, lentils, and caramelized onions.....but couldn't have imagined how good they all tasted together. I served this to a bunch of veggie friends who all loved it!!! Definitely give it a try. I use more onions than called for and cook them a lot longer than suggested. i also add extra garlic. This is yummmmmmmy!

This was delicious. I did not have orecchiette, so I substituted penne. I added a bayleaf to the regular brown lentils I had on hand and added an extra 1/4 cup of cheese and two extra cloves of garlic. Chopped the spinach, which came from the farmer's market and was closer to a pound in weight than 10 oz. This is the kind of vegetarian dish that doesn't wow you with its exotic flavors, but tastes nourishing and comforting. Don't expect fireworks - it's a simple and healthy dish, and on those terms, very satisfying.

Rating: 3
Yum! I'm not familiar with this Italian dish, so I don't know how the onions are normally cooked, but I cooked mine for a lot longer than the recipe suggested, until they were brown and super sweet - I don't like the raw onion taste at all. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it was great. I would recommend that you REALLY like onions if you're going to make this dish, because there are a lot of them.

I had a lot of baby spinach to use up, so I tried this recipe. I wasn't disappointed! I love carmelized onions, but never thought of having them with lentils until now. A very earthy and satisfying dish.

This has been a staple one dish meal for us ever since it was published in Gourmet some years back. Very easy and very tasty. The leftovers are tasty, too. It's key to use the little green/blue lentils---the larger brown lentils turn mushy.

I only had rotini on hand, but it worked well because the lentils got caught in the spirals. I might try kale, chard or even collards next time...yup, another CSA-type who's always looking for a new way to use greens!

Very earthy, and subtle. A nice hearty winter dish, which if you really want to, you can enrich or liven up with either Pancetta, or something spicy. I only added a little broth, and a little more garlic, and it was very enjoyable with some ciabatta and a medium bodied Nebbiolo. I highly recommned the orecchiette shape, they capture little pockets of lentil beautifully.

Rating: 4
OMG - delicious!!! i only used 2 onions, but added 1/4 c. chopped pancetta about 5 minutes before the onions were done. only used 1 bag of spinach - it was plenty. when i tossed the pasta together, i added a 1/4 cup of ricotta with the pasta water & it was fabulous. will definetely make this part of my repetoire.

I haven't made this yet but adding some salt as the onions are carmelizing would probably boost the flavor of the onions. It will help release some of the moisture in the onions, deepening the carmelized flavor. It's a tip I got from Cook's Illustrated.

Rating: 3
I love the textural combination of the orechiette, green lentils and spinach. That plus the fact that there were abundant leftovers makes this a keeper, though I do feel that something was missing tastewise. We doubled the garlic (as recommended by another reviewer) but next time I think I will also add some crumbled sausage as well as some sage and oregano. Any other suggestions from fans of this recipe?

Rating: 3
Very easy, satisfying and healthy! I only had "regular brown lentils" and they were fine. Orecchiette provide the best texture (pasta/lentil ratio makes the "bite" great!). Add a bay leaf to the lentils, be patient with those onions, salt and pepper liberally and make enough for left overs as this is even better the next day!

Rating: 4
We loved this recipe. I made several changes, though. First, I uncovered the onions after they had softened, raised the heat to evaporate all the liquid that had seeped from them, and then let them brown uncovered. Second, I added the spinach to the hot pasta water to let it wilt before adding it to the other ingredients. Third, I used only 1/2 pound pasta so the sauce would be more concentrated. It was fabulous!

I started making this dish on New Years Eve 2004 and everyone loved it. It satisfies our tradition of Lentils on New Year's to bring good luck and it tastes great. My friends don't think its New YEar's Eve with out it and I don't think any of them had ever eaten lentils before they ate this. Its really great reheated too!

This dish has become a staple in our home. We halve the recipe, and occasionally substitute fusilli for orecchiette, though the later is my preference. Also, I use 3 bay leafs with both the onions and the lentils. I also add a couple dashes of cayenne pepper to the onions. I've never needed to use the reserved pasta water.

i also doubled the garlic, used 2 onions, and added 2 bay leaves to both the lentils and the onions. the key is caramelizing the onions until sweet and adding a bit more salt.

I had to give this four forks because so many people left mediocre reviews. My husband and I thought it was delicious. I think the secret is definitely carmelizing the onions and using plenty of them. Also, I cooked the bay leaf with the lentils instead of the onions. And because previous commenters had said how much this makes, I only cooked half the box of orrechiette and we still have leftovers. Hearty and simple, we will definitely be making this again soon.

This dish was simple, tasty, and healthy, 3 elements I always look for. I like the fact that I can cook the pasta, lentils, and onions at the same time to economize overall cooking time (more pots to clean, though). The flavors are understated, yet pleasant, so don't expect a big bang.

Rating: 3
This dish is about subtlety. Not every dish should be "bang" in your mouth. The bay leaf is your first clue. I used whole wheat pasta, regular spinach, and canned lentils. The cooking of the onions is probably the most important part - carmelizing them to release their sweetness is the base of the "sauce". The lentils are there for health, the spinach for colour (and health). the garlic gives a bite and the salt & pepper should be added near the end for the lift, along with fresh parmesan. My wife had just picked up a block from costco (I was in heaven). Plus I added a dab of butter with the bit of pasta water for thickening. I have had (and you can make) a similar dish with pepperoncini (hot peppers) to give it a kick. Or add herbs as recommended by others (I had fresh Rosemary, but it dominates and I didn't want to add it for the first time.)

this is an established item in our menu reperatory because it is easy, tasty and HEALTHY. i make this dish with a variety of onions for richer flavor. i never use pasta ears because they mold onto each other instead of mixing evenly through the dish.

Great - with these modifications: 1. this recipe requires some stock - homemade chicken broth is my preference. i think that canned or boxed broth is just a bad idea all around, so if you don't have good home made or frozen broth, skip this step. 2. pancetta or some prosciutto is needed. 3. fresh herbs - forget about the bay leaves and substitute finely chopped fresh rosemary or sage, a bit of thyme, and fresh parsley to finish. 4. proportions seem out of balance. to make four servings i used 1 onion plus a couple of shallots, 1/3 cup lentils, 1/3 lb orechiette, and a few handfuls of arugula instead of the spinach. 5. as previous reviewers suggest, good grated cheese is an absolute necessity. pecorino was my choice.

Rating: 2
Not a bad recipe overall, but definitely nothing exciting. I added hot pancetta to the oil before frying the onions, and that addded nice flavour. It definitely needs more, though. It seemed to have gotten a bit more flavourful as it sat and cooled. We'll see how the leftovers are tomorrow...And it's a shame that the recipe uses 3 pans to cook!

this dish is one of our favorite weeknight dinners. It's delicious and nutricious. Be sure and cook the onions as long as required by the recipe; the flavor is intensified. And I agree with the writer who advises using good cheese. A keeper.

Wow what a waste. I took all of the suggestions to heart and tried to add more flavor to this dish i.e. vegetable stock, some red pepper flakes, more garlic, the kalamata olives. The end result was still so disappointing. Hearty sure but dullsville.

I was satisfied with this recipe. I cut the spinach a bit (epicurious recipes tend to be spinach-heavy when it's called for) and only had brown lentils on hand. Even though it was a 3-pot recipe, everything came together easily to make a tasty, hearty dish. Incidently, I loved all the onions! Do use good cheese!

I would make this dish again but less onions. I also added finely chopped celery and carrots which added another layer of flavor. I would add the lentils to the carrots, celery and onion mixture and spice before adding to pasta. When it all came together it was a fair dish needing a bit more flavor. The timing worked very well. French lenils are key to the final flavor

I have to comment on this recipe simply because it is very similiar to my family's favourite dish that we affectionately refer to in an abbreviated form as just, "lentils." The recipe that we use came from Naples, Italy with my great-grandparents. We have modified it though by using broth to cook everything (which for us is lentils, chick peas, rapini, carrots, onion and celery)in, and using olive oil only for the garlic (we use at least 3-4 cloves, at least!), and then mixing the garlic/olive oil in with the cooked pasta before adding the broth/lentils etc. and then top with some reggiano. Highly recommended.

This dish is very similar to one that my Sicilian grandmother made all the time! Absolutely filling and really delicious! I had to smile at the review from Dallas, though. Sour Cream? That would be the quickest way to ruin the flavor of the "expensive cheese".

I would give this a 3 with the following modification. I pre-cooked my lentils with a LOT of garlic cloves, an onion and bay leave in BROTH. Once they were cooked, drained and let cool. Then prepared the pasta. Meanwhile in a pan, I sauted 1 onion,4 slices of finely chopped bacon some crushed garlic salt, pepper and red pepper. I added the spinached and the cooked pasta and lentils to the pan. aDded a little more beef broth. Once incorporated added to bowl and add the cheese. VEry tasty, my husband liked it too. Add the bacon gives the lentils the kick they need. I used regular genric brown lentils

Such a good weeknight pasta recipe. I used regular brown lentils and it turned out wonderful. I had to use slightly more pasta water than called for to thoroughly wilt the spinach to my taste. I also halved the amount onions thinking they would be overpowering, but next time I will use all of it.

This sounded good, but in light of the prior review, I reduced the onions to 1, added lots of garlic, salt & pepper, 1 bag of spinach. In addition to the other ingredients, I added some grilled chicken and crumbled some feta cheese. It was delicious & quick.

We did not care for this dish. It was somewhat bland even with the expensive cheese. It helped a lot to add a generous dollop of sour cream to each serving. Tip: The recipe will make REALLY HUGE portions if you are only serving six. (I actually wonder if the recipe was kitchen tested.)
