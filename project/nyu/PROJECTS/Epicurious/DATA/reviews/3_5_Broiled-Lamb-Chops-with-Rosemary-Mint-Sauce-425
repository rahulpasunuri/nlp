Quick and easy lamb recipe. Try using golden mint jelly, champagne vinegar and fresh rosemary for an excellent sauce. I thought that was the original recipe a few years ago when I first made it, but I guess not...

Ok, the lamb itself was great, but I must have messed up on the sauce, because it turned out to be a sticky mess. I followed the recipe, and let it boil until it was thick. Then...a couple minutes after I spooned it on the lamb, it hardened into something like glue or taffy. My husband and I were picking it out of our teeth and it will be a huge mess to wash our dishes.

Easy recipe...subsituted apricot jelly instead of mint and added fresh mint...a sweetened version...

Very good. Lost alittle sweetness during the reduction so I just added some brown sugar. The second time I did aju/demi instead of vinager. It was very good as well. Will make again.

I made this for my husband's birthday. He loved it! I followed the directions as is without substitutions. It is very easy---I will make this again for special occasions or for company.

This was an easy, good dish. I served it with rosemary lemon orzo pilaf and sauteed swiss chard as suggested--both recipes are also on this site. I put the lamb chops in a grill pan and put them directly under the broiler for @ 6 min each side. Would definitely make again

An excellent lamb recipe. Definately a keeper. The mint sauce is a very nice compliment and it is so easy to make. If you buy your loin chops thick, I recommend cooking about 6 - 7 minutes per side. Bravo!

I had to use lamb shoulder chops, since my market was out of the loin chops and it turned out well save for the cut of meat being more fatty and such. I would prefer the loin chops, I'm sure, and this is such a simple recipe I will happily try it again. Some suggestions: Get the best quality mint jelly you can find, otherwise it may be too sweet/artificial tasting. Also, use fresh Rosemary if possible.

Fabulous dinner!! I made the sauce too thick, then thinned it too much, but the result was still fantastic. It will be revisited!

Delicious & very easy! The mint jelly sauce is more like a glaze, but excellent nonetheless!
