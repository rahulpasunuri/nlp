My friends loved this, but I made some modifications. I more than doubled the amount of cheese (close to 8 cups). I used 2 large fresh jalepenos. (Next time I would use 3-4, to make it hotter). I used a 16 oz can of tomatoes with jalepenos, and only 3 1/2 cups of milk.

I was looking for a gooey mac'n cheese, this is not it but still good.

Tasty and easy! Used 2 Tbs canned green chili and all cheddar cheese with good results. Half recipe easily serves 4.

We love this recipe and have made it at least 15x. It is excellent as written and also modified by adding fresh jalapeno, mexican spiced tomatoes and pasta shells.

I absolutely love this recipe, I have made it over and over and it is always a hit! I've had people tell me that it is what they crave for thanksgiving or any special dinner. You can always modify this recipe by changing the cheeses and it will still be a hit. I recommend you follow the portions, otherwise you'll have a mess in the oven!

I also accidentally let the sauce boil and it curdled which gave it a grainy texture. But it tasted great, my kids and husband still ate two helpings each. Will definitely make again more carefully. Doubled the jalapenos, don't think the pamesan added much except for drying it up a bit, may experiment with cheeses. I also used light butter and skim milk, still very rich.

Took this to a family picnic today and many were asking for the recipe. The addition of tomatoes was nice; I used fresh hot peppers from my garden; used cayenne. Definitely will make again.

We enjoyed this recipe. We used a fresh jalapeno and crushed saltines to top. Next time we'd make it a little spicer. Overall, a yummy treat!

Perfect for a cold, snowy day because this dish warms you up. I added more garlic and jalapeno because we like the flavors. Used pepper jack cheese instead of plain montery jack cheese and Panko bread crumbs instead of fresh.

I dream of this recipe on cold days. I use one whole fresh jalapeno to kick up the heat a little bit. I also add one pound of chicken andouille sausage to make it heartier for my hungry boy-toy. Delicious!

This wasn't such a great recipe- tasted like cumin flavored pasta and was generally bland, despite the jalapeno. 4 cups of milk seems like way too much in retrospect. Also, I only cooked the pasta for 5 minutes, as suggested, and it was still mushy after baking. I won't bother with this one again- there are much better mac and cheese recipes on this site. Try the one with gruyere and prosciutto.

I was disappointed by this recipe. It was really bland - I even used twice the recommended amount of jalepenos. Plus, I agree, too much topping! I didn't use it all - but it helped the dish be even more bland and kind of dry. Will eat my leftovers with some salsa or marinara - which goes against the intention of making mac and cheese as a solo dish in the first place.

tried this looking for a different mac and cheese variant and was very happy with it. i just used a colby jack cheese (it was on sale) and some cheddar with the breadcrumbs instead of parmesean (too expensive round here) i had a ham steak in the freezer so that was diced and tossed in as well to make it a one dish supper. taste is amazing and it really works well as an all in one casserole for those of us on a shoe string!

I love this recipe. I have been making it ever since it first appeared in Gourmet Magazine in 1991. It really has a kick to it, so if you like spicy things, this is a must try.

Delicious. Cooked 1 lb of lean ground turkey before hand and added it to the recipe. Also, I used 1% milk in order to be more health conscious. I was thinking next time doubling the tomatoes, using whole wheat pasta and reduced fat cheese. I think this would come out equally delicious, but perhaps less fat. Also, I was very generous with the cayenne pepper - it was nice and spicy!

Modified this recipe just a bit by adding some sweet sausage and white wine. This is a real crowd pleaser.

Heart-stopping! A great variation on the regular old bechamel-based cheese sauce. My husband has been a Kraft devotee for years (!!!) and has rejected all prior attempts to convert him to "from-scratch" -- but this did the trick. Served it to a crowd at an Oscar party, and plan to do the same this year.

I am a huge fan of this recipe. I usually top it with crushed cornflakes or crushed jalapeno potato chips instead of bread crumbs, which adds a little more crunch to it. Also, one time my grocery store was out of jalapeno's so I added a generous portion of salsa instead (about 4-5 tbsps)and it worked out perfectly. Someone said it doesn't make good leftovers, but I totally disagree. I like it as much if not more re-heated the next day.

I thought this recipe was very good. It was nice and easy and I put it together a few hours before I baked it, so I increased the bakeing time 10-15 minutes. I also used jalapeno cornbread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs which gave it and extra twist. An extra bonus... my 2 year old son thought it was great too!

I've made this several times, and I love it! Heat the milk gradually, and don't let it boil completely or the sauce will curdle (which is what happened to me the first time I made the dish). Yes, the amount of jalapenos called for may not result in the spiciest mac & cheese for some people (I use double the amount myself)... but folks, you should feel free to taste and add as you go along until you reach the desired heat level. I also add a teaspoon of chili powder for extra flavor.

I really liked this recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving which complimented the marchino cherry/chipotle flavored ham. It was a hit. I would definitely do it again. It does not however taste well as a leftover dish.

My husband (a vegetarian) printed this out and hinted that I should make it. The store I visited didn't have pickled jalapeños so I chose to use one fresh jalapeños and it was fine (probably cheaper). Moreover, I accidentally left the flour out (that didn't make any difference). The dish makes quite a lot: It lasted it us for 3 - 4 days. We enjoyed every bite though!

This brings an old favorite up to date. For those who like some spice in comfort foods this will do it. It gets requested often in our house. I sometimes add kielbasa to change it up some

This was just okay. It tasted like decent (ie not great) mac and cheese. But defninitley not SPICY! The tomatos made it just a little bit interesting. It needed more kick in general. I added some Worcestishre (how to spell...) sauce and hot sauce at the end.

I've had much better. I was really disappointed in it. With "spicy" in the title...i was surprised this was bland, bland, bland

This dish is a great guideline for mac and cheese as a main course. I don't usually mess with recipes this much but I was working from what I had on hand. I added ground turkey and sweet red pepper to make it more substantial, decreased the amount of cheese ( was a mixture of cheddar, parm and provalone) and used a thick salsa instead of tomatoes (because I didn't have any). I also used a bit less milk than it called for. It still turned out very rich and very cheesy. I also ommitted the breadcrumbs because I don't like them on mac and cheese. The husband's quote: "make it anytime you want!" Oh, and definitely add the cayenne.

I really liked this dish. Too hot for the kids in my house, but the adults loved it. I have to mention that 20 minutes was NOT enough time for this to get thoroughly hot and bubbly and I have a quick oven. I would increase the time to 35 - 40 minutes. But very easy and tasty!

This recipe was very tasty. I omitted the cayenne and used an 1/8 less cumin than the original recipe called for. The amount of topping that this recipe called for was WAY TOO MUCH. In my books, bread crumbs are filler. Next time I make this dish I will halve the topping and try adding the cayenne. Any ideas as to how much cayenne one would use.

This was really a nice change from traditional mac and cheese (though I still love that as well!). I used 8 ounces of Jack and 8 ounces of Cheddar instead of 6 because it comes packaged that way and it is easier to use it up at one time instead of letting 2 leftover ounces turn to mold in the refrig! Anyway, it came out wonderfully and you can adjust the level of spiciness according to your tastes. My husband likes it spicy so I used more of the jalepanoes than called for. Warms you up on a cold winter night!

I LOVE mac & cheese and have tried many different recipes. This one is positively delicious and I will definately make it again and again. I added a little more of the jalapenos and some extra cheese. I also thought the topping was just right and wouldn't change it. A mac & cheese classic.

I served this to relatives with great reviews. Next time I will try fresh tomatoes. Did not mind the extra breadcrumb topping.

Oh, the joy of experimenting with recipes! I have used this recipe twice within the past two months and added my own touches: mixing the cheese in with the 'tomato mixture' before mixing it all together. I also added andoullie sausage. Add a freshly baked side of sweet cornbread....what a meal!

Different from the ordinary mac and cheese. I add more cheese and milk to make it creamier. We had lost his recipe (threw away all old Gourmet's when we moved). Thrilled to find it on epicurious.com.

I modified the recipe a bit- omitted the tomatoes, added extra jalapenos, reduced fat cheese, julienned slices of ham, corn, obeyed the others by reducing the breadcrumb topping-- and it was FABULOUS. The ultimate comfort food, and I will definitely make it again and again! Great 1 dish meal for anytime of the year.

After making this dish a couple of times I decided to jazz it up by using an entire 4oz can of jalapeno chilies and 1-1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Not a morsel was left. Multiplied this recipe and fed 50 of my classmates (along with other dishes, of course), all to rave reviews.

I don't like traditional Macaroni and Cheese, but with the addition of the herbs, spices and tomatoes it added a nice flavor to the dish. I agree with the other posters that the topping was too much. I made only half the amount and thought it was just enough. But, I did use more cheese than the recipe called for---you can never use have too much cheese!

This was a hit with my fussy family. I halved the topping and used what cheese I had (all Cheddar) instead of the M. Jack - still delicious. Was good for lunches the next day. I would add a bit more Cummin and Coriander next time and a few more Jalapenos.

Not a difficult recipe to make and it has a good flavor, just a little spicy. Reheats well.

I didn't like this one at all. Usually when I find a rating of 100% on your site I am very satisfied with the results. This was weak on flavor and utterly disappointing.

Very well received at a New Year's party featuring 4 kinds of mac and cheese. Skipped the bread crumbs altogether. I always add a little extra seasonings.

Great! I happen to like a lot of topping, so I went for the full amount. I put my casserole into a shallow 11" x 13" baking dish, so the crumbs really spread out. This stuff has fantastic flavor, and it makes a lot. A keeper!

Rating: 3
Different and delicious -- got good reviews from my crowd. Instead of adding jalapenos separately, I shredded monterey jack cheese that comes with jalapenos in it. I agree with the one reviewer who said that the topping recipe makes too much topping -- cut in half and you will have adequate.

Rating: 3
A tasty dish but it calls for WAY too much topping. Next time I'll half the amount of bread crumbs so they don't interfere with the tasty, cheesy pasta. The tomatoes are a nice touch. Overall, fairly easy and very tasty.
