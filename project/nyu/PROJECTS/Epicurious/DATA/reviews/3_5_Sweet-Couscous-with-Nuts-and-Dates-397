I omitted the oil. Used slivered almonds, pine nuts, peacans, dissicated coconut & raisins and a drop of vanilla essence. No additional sugar. Very easy to make. It tasted ok. Nothing spectacular. However, I think it makes a good protein breakfast. I don't think I'll make it again. Only if desparate!

I made this with whole wheat couscous from Trader Joe's. I toasted sliced almonds and chopped raw pistachios. I also used whole dates that I chopped, unsweetened flaked coconut, and chopped dried cherries. I put the milk and sugar in before baking. Totally delicious!

I, too, skipped the baking step. Also used only dates, no nuts. I added cold milk to the hot coscous and that was great, a good variation from something like oatmeal. Did not need to add extra sugar. I had it for breakfast; bit heavy for a snack IMO. Should keep well, so long as you add the milk only when you eat the serving.

This is absolutely delicious! I've made it twice. The first time I followed through with baking it, the second time without. The end result is so similar that I wouldn't recommend the baking step. I've added raisins, apricots, almonds and pine nuts with the dates and they made a great combination. Also, don't skip on the milk - it really gives the couscous a good consistency.

I thought that this dish was really good. I added raisins with the dates just because I love raisins. Will be making again and again.

This made for a very tasty breakfast dish this morning. I took the advice of other reviewers, and omitted the oil and sugar. I also addded saffron, cardamon powder, and a drop or two of rose essence to the water before boiling, which added a lovely fragrance to the dish. Definitely will make this again.

Lovely comfort food when served with warm milk. As stated by previous reviewers, it's best to leave out the sugar and even the oil.

Definitely a perfect breakfast or snack. Like the others, I made some substitutions that worked really well, and my roommates loved it!

Too sweet! But otherwise delicious. As the previous reviewer stated, no sugar needed.

This couscous recipe was absolutely the best that I have ever eaten. I made a few changes, which improved it's flavor from the sample that I made a week before my dinner party. For the dinner party, I added about 1 cup of milk after the couscous was done cooking, also added butter to the water and oil. Lastly, I added spiced almonds, slivered almonds, pecans, 2 different kinds of raisens, and dried cherries. Several people commented that it was better than the couscous served at Greens restaurant here in San Francisco. Greens is a famous vegitarian place that is renound. You'll love this recipe.

I improvised around this recipe and it's wonderful. Subbed butter for oil, used handfulls of dried apricots, cranberries and golden raisins instead of dates, and assorted mixed nuts. Very easy and delicious! You can make this however you like. Truthfully it doesn't even have to be baked. Just mix and eat. Have fun with it.

Loved the recipe! Although it would help to have a portion size. "Serves 8" of what portion? I would also suggest using chopped dates. It would save time and make the preparation less messy

It's good. It's really, really good. Did I mention it's good? And (reasonably) good for you.

Made this for brunch after an all-night midwinter vigil and it was the hit of the meal. We got "creative" and it ended up with more dried fruit (dates, cranberries and sultanas) and nuts (pistachios, almonds, and hazelnuts) than the recipe called for. No need for extra sugar - it's rich enough!
