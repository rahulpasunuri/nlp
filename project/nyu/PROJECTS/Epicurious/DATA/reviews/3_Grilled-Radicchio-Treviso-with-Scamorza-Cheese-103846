I get this dish everytime I visit Treviso. The KEY is getting Treviso radicchio which is very difficult to find outside of this region. The treviso radicchio is long almost like endive, where as in the US radicchio is a ball. Scamorza cheese is also key to making this and should not be subsituted with anything else. I also never put the vinegar on the dish. It is fine without.

It seemed to lack flavour. It could have been that the radicchio was'nt that fresh but the whole recipe was a let down.
