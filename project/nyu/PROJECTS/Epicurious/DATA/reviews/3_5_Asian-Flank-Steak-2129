I have been using this recipe for several years because it is always requested. I do add twice as much cilantro in the marinade and then toss fresh sprigs onto the finished streak.

This recipe has been in my arsenal since it was printed in Bon Appetit. It is very simple, yet the flavors are outstanding! I serve it with brown rice (with the left over marinade boiled as a sauce) and roasted peppers (tossed in olive oil and minced garlic, with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.) Guests request this flank steak when coming to my house.

I followed marinating directions and added one clove garlic to it. Let steak marinate for 4 hours. Pan seared and cooked it. Fantastic. Amazing flavor and texture.

This tasted really good, and was simple to make as well, served with a side of broccoli for a good meal.

This is a staple summer BBQ recipe for us and has been a total hit every time. It's super simple and you can't go wrong. On occasion we serve this with a horseradish cream sauce on the side, and sometimes add green onions to the marinade. Another option is for a bit of sesame oil. There are several other similar recipes to this one on Epicurious, too.

Had this for a weeknight meal, and it was delicious. Very easy and stress-free. I added a bit of garlic and upped the ginger, which was a good idea. It gives the marinade a special something extra. Served with baked potatoes, which is a must. They're perfect for soaking up the sauce. Would be good with flank or sirloin (not the thin-cut I used, it just couldn't do the marinade justice).

This is the kind of dish you remember a couple of weeks later and want to make again. The meat was tenderized beautifully...and the sauce was excellent. I did poke the flank with a fork to help the marinade do its worked. It was great with garlic mashed potatoes. (I didn't grill, but broiled. Summer was over.)

Great as a marinade for salmon too! Makes more than needed for just the steak. Used Delmonico steaks (what a splurge). Would consider grating the ginger.

Very good. Cut down on worchestershire sauce a little, used thyme instead of cilantro, will try with rosemary next time. Marinated 48 hours, grilled, no leftovers.

This was so good and easy! The marinade tenderized and flavored the beef fabulously. Might try this marinade with other cuts of beef.

Simple to make, very flavorful, and delicious. I marinated it over night and broiled it the next day. It was a warm, so I opted to serve it over a mixed green salad instead of rice.

I like this recipe very much, and I've made it three or four times. Yes its just flank steak, but heating the marinade to use later as a sauce is the difference. Use low-sodium soy sauce, is the only change I'd make. Simple and delicious, a perfect quick supper.

I loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as written the first time and was so pleased. I made it again with boneless chicken breasts because I can't make beef every night and it was good but of course not nearly as good as the flank steak. I plan to make this dish on a regular basis.

We always serve 2 flank steaks: one with this marinade and one with red wine and garlic.

I added extra garlic, but I still thought this was fairly bland. I'll stick with my usual flank steak marinade recipe of 1 bottle beer/stout, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon chopped Siamese Ginger (Galanga) and tons of garlic.

My whole family (the extended one) loves this dish. We normally add a few cloves of crushed garlic to the marinade. Also, we thaw the meat slightly in the microwave before marinating it and letting the it sit in the Ziploc bag for about 24 hours. Add cornstarch to the juice on the stove for a thicker sauce for the rice.

This was delicious. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added garlic, cut back on the Worcestershire and used low sodium soy sauce. The results were fantastic. I thought my husband was going to lick the plate!! A definate keeper.

LOVE THIS! served it for the 4th of July and got raves, but no leftovers :( The addition of garlic is a must but otherwise perfect. fortunately my husband slices VERY thin and everyone age 4 to 60 cleaned their plates. served with sesame stir fried asparagus(from this site)& Roasted potatoes(my secret shake & bake with onion soup mix)

A Total Crowd Pleaser at my outdoor grill party! This is the 2nd time I've made this and I marinated the flank steak for 5 hours since I didn't plan ahead and marinate it overnight. Grilled the steak 10 min on each side and the steak was juicy and not tough. You have to make sure you cut the meat against the grain. This is one of my favorite recipes.

An absolute must! I have been searching the Internet all afternoon trying to find this recipe. And I am glad that I did! I made it last summer with great success and I'll be making it tommorrow. I highly recommend this recipe. The only thing that I do is add some crushed garlic and it just makes it better!

It's amazing how the addition of soy sauce and ginger automatically allows a dish to be dubbed "Asian."

I too added garlic and although the final results were very tasty, it was still tough. Flank steak is flank steak - period.

It was so easy to make since there are so few ingredients but I think it was a bit heavy on the Wortershire sauce. Maybe next time I'll add garlic to the marinade but my friends and my husband loved it and want me to make it for them again.

The marinade for this flank steak is amazing! I made this around Christmas for the entire family and they loved it. I have made it on numerous occassions since then, both as an entree and as a h'orsdeuvre. Each time, I made a lots of extra in hopes of having leftovers but that never happened. I found that the serving size is too small for the entree. I recommend 1.5 - 2 times that amount. I added lots of garlic like other critics mentioned. Marinading it for 3-5 hours is just as good as marinading it overnight.

Rating: 3
I liked this recipe but would try adding garlic the next time as previous readers suggest. I would also try cutting back on the worcesteshire sauce as it was slightly overpowering in this dish. I used reduced-sodium soy sauce which may have been why. Flank steak is very tender when it is marinated. I put the dish in the broiler using a oven-safe grill pan to give it the char lines. overall, this dish was pretty good and very easy to make.

i have made this dish twice already one of which was for guests, and it has been so well received nothing is left for leftovers! i, too, have to add garlic and a tad more cilantro because we love the combination. thanks for such an array of choices....psst, this site is even better than (dare i say it?) martha stewart's. i simply love it here.

So easy and so good! Seared it in a grill pan, then tossed it in the oven for a bit. Augmented the marinade a bit, but the gist was the same. Cooking down the marinade to make a sauce makes it superb!

This is a staple at our house. So easy and so good. If you start in the morning, you can have it that night, the flavors of the marinade will still shine through. I always add several cloves of chopped garlic. Yummy!

We actually marinated the steak for 48 hrs and only grilled 4 minutes per side. It turned out to be medium rare, which is how we like our steaks. Next time we plan on adding some red wine to the marinade. This recipe is easy to prepare and grill--delicious!!

This was a great recipe. The sauce poured over the steak really jazzed it up. I thickened it with a little whipping cream and that was also very good!

We have made this recipe for years...it is always a hit, especially with men. We usually use a London broil, rather than flank steak. I've found that it does make a difference in the brands of Worcestershire Sauce used; we think Lea & Perrins gives the best flavor for the least salt. A summertime standard in our house!

Simple, elegant, versatile. IF there is any leftover, we use the beef in a variety of ways i.e wrapped around pear slices, served w/glass noodle salad, and even as Asian beef sandwiches. Unfortunately, with my children, I make 4 every time as they enjoy it so well.

Delicious! Easy! Impressive! This is a wonderful recipe for summer grilling. I've made it several times and not just in summer. I also tried using skirt steak instead of flank steak and the results were superb. Skirt steak resembles flank steak but is much more tender. I only make it with skirt steak now (sometims flank steak can be a little chewy). I serve it with mashed potatoes with carmelized onions, and asparagus drizzled with butter and a litte sesame oil. Everyone loves this dish and can't get enough. There are never any leftovers!

I don't like over salty foods but I love this dish! I didn't find it over salty at all, but then again I always use a low sodium soya sauce in my all recipes. I also add fresh garlic and use a larger piece of Flank Steak because my boyfriend loves this dish so much too! definately one of our favorites!

After I reading the "salty" reviews, I was a little hesitant to make this recipe (even though I really like salty foods), but I tried it anyway. It came out REALLY tasty! To combat the salty taste, I added a little bit of sugar to the marinade. For the sauce, I also added some anti-salt ingredients: chopped sweet, onion, dry sherry, and thyme. I boiled that down a bit and it made a really nice sauce.

My girlfriend who is an excellent cook made me this dish. I have to say that although it was lovingly prepared, the dish was not good. The combination of the salt, worcestershire sauce and lemon made this dish overpoweringly salty and none of the meaty goodness of the steak comes through. The dish also does not taste "Asian" despite the ginger and soy sauce. I cannot recommend this receipe and give it a big thumbs down.

Rating: 3
A tasty way to make flank steak. I didn't have any lemons so I just substituted a bit of vinegar, and it turned out great. I found I didn't need to use any of the marinade as a sauce-after 1 1/2hours of marinating, the meat had a delicious flavor just by itself. The sauce would have overpowered it.
