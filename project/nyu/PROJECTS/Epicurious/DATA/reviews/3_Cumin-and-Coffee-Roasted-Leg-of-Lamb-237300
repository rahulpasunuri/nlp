I'm a huge fan of lamb, but this one just didn't hit the mark at all. If you're looking for a winner, try the "Spice-Rubbed Butterflied Leg of Lamb" on this website instead. Happy Eating!

This was the first time I'd ever cooked lamb and I thought it was delicious. It came out so moist and flavorful. I would definitely consider trying this again.

We've made this recipe three times already! Our guests loved it too. We increased the amount of cumin, coffee and cloves ... but we like strong flavors. Lamb stays really moist!

We made this recipe exactly as written (assuming typo was 1/8th tsp clove), and while we would make it again, it was only good not great. We love the lamb coffee combination and have previously enjoyed the redeye lamb shanks, but this dish really was overwhelmingly flavored by cumin. The coffee was undetectable. On the plus side, the dish is quick and easy with great lamb flavor. Suggestions: We feel this dish would benefit from much more coffee, we plan on doubling the amount and marinating in coffee as well. Although clove can be overpowering at times, this is one instance where maybe more than the 1/8th tsp we used would better complement the coffee. We were not sure cumin was the best pairing and had other ideas such as chili powder, paprika, or unsweetened cocoa. We enjoyed this with a side of lentils fortified with the excess lamb fat.
