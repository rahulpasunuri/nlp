i thought this was a very tasty recipe- its the first time i have ever made gravy from scratch. i didn't think that the gravy would turn out very well - i kept tasting it and fretting. until i added the balsamic. that completely changed the flavor profile. substitutions: chicken breasts only onions for shallots chicken stock only -- no beef broth (didn't have any) added rosemary to gravy while cooking it does require more time than i have when making dinner but i will certainly make it again.

this was pretty good, especially after a few changes. i made the balsamic sauce as stated and it was a tad boring and soupy. i added a little white wine, more balsamic vinegar and some figs and reduced further and it was lovely. also, after reading reviews about needing something to sop up the sauce with, i decided to do roasted garlic and rosemary mashed potatoes instead, which was perfect with this dish!

The sauce was too sweet for me and I couldn't even taste the pepper. It was eatable, but I will probably not make it again. If I do I will increase the flour for a thicker sauce and increase the pepper.

Made this for a party of 12 with a few fussy eaters who all really liked it. Had a little trouble with the sauce, came out much too thin at first and ended up having to reduce it again and added a touch more balsamic and also some brown sugar which deepened the flavor. It ended up tasting delicious and the chicken was really juicy. Although like other reviewers, the potatoes took significantly longer to cook.

This dish was tasty, but not bursting with flavor. Browning the chicken before roasting was a nice touch. I love the sauce, but reducing to 1 and 1/2 cups was more a soup than a sauce. I reduced to half a cup. The potatoes need a touch more oil, and I will definitely toss some salt in next time. Good but not great; but since the flavor isn't overwhelming, it's good for kids. Will do again someday.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and frankly don't see what all the fuss is about. In fact, I don't think the flavors work at all. I much preferred the shallot-thyme reduction prior to the addition of the balsamic vinegar and would make that as an all-purpose gravy for chicken, meat or mashed potatoes, which I do think go better with this dish too. The roasted potatoes are good, but not unique. Oven-roasted potatoes with rosemary and garlic?? People, that's basic. Plus they don't sop up the gravy in that state. Some of the parts are worth doing, but as a total dish, it doesn't work for me.

I'd rather have just done my fall back roast. the saute did not add anything, and unlike the other reviewers, I did not think the sauce was all that. Not terrible, but I'll only make again if I'm in a time crunch.

This was so simple and very flavorful. To another reviewer who had problem with the chicken sticking to the pan - it is very important that when you put your chicken into the hot oil in the pan that you do not touch, move, jiggle, peek or disturb the chicken for the full 15 minutes. When it gets a beautiful golden brown coating, it will release itself from the pan. Just make sure that the burner is not too hot to cause the oil to smoke and the chicken to burn. I didn't have any thyme, so just used rosemary for the sauce and halved the amount of sauce and still had way too much. My potatoes were done about 15 minutes before the chicken was, so I tossed baby squash with olive oil and salt and roasted that for the final 15 minutes with the chicken. So good. My children loved it and hubby was glad there weren't too many dishes to clean up!

Gets my highest rating for combining ease of preparation with sophisticated flavour - the sauce is fabulous. Be careful not to boil it after adding the balsamic vinegar. Everyone remarked about how good the chicken and potatoes smelled while baking and were waiting at the table even before dinner was announced. Good winter comfort food - but suitable for company. Started with a salad of arugula and shaved parmesan with a balsamic dressing. Worked well.

I fixed this for our New Years Eve dinner (since we couldn't actually go to the Rainbow Room). The sauce and potatoes were great, but the chicken was tough. I did use chicken breasts instead of a whole fryer, which might have been the problem. I did everything else per the recipe.

Rating: 3
I made this years ago and while the chicken part of it was acrobatic (it stuck to the pan, I burned myself etc) the sauce was AMAZING and I use it all the time as a gravy. It's super easy, easily adaptable and can be made with stuff you already have in your pantry.

Okay, am I the only one that had problems with the chicken skin sticking to the pan? The sauce turned out great. The chicken looked sad. I followed the directions to the tea, used large Calphalon pan with plenty of olive oil.... sigh... all this happened just before my dinner party. I renamed it Fall-Out-Chicken.

This recipe was GREAT!! I did not have shallots so I used finely chopped onions which worked just fine. I had some left over roasted garlic cloves which I added and let simmer with the sauce - that turned out to be the best part. The garlic gave it a very nice flavour. I agree with the other reviewers about the time - it took 45 minutes to get to the right consistency. As suggested by another reviewer, I marinated the chicken overnight in balsamic vinegar, garlic and a dash of worchester sauce and then grilled the chicken. I much prefer grilled chicken and you save yourself 6 tbsp of oil (I used skinless chicken as well). My last usggestion is that you do not need to add any extra salt to the chicken or sauce as it is already quite salty even with the low salt broth. The potatoes were great and I've already had a request to make them again this week. This recipe is definately a keeper.

If you enjoy simple bistro style food, this is a must. Definetly made the "Must have again" catagory. And the reviews were right about the reduction time ... 45 min, not 20. An outstanding dish.

This was great...I made the gravy in a deep saute pan and it did not take as long to reduce...around 25-30 minutes. The potatoes are a must...will defintely make again.

I made this recipe for a big family dinner party. I like to make as much of the meal in advance and adapted this recipe. Instead of roasting the chicken, I used breast tenders. I find that my family don't like huge chunks of chicken breast especially the oversized ones that seem to be the norm when you buy supermarket packs of boneless breasts. I marinated the tenders in balsamic vinegar, crushed garlic, salt and pepper for a few hours. I then lightly grilled the tenders on the barbecue ensuring they did not dry out. I had made the sauce ahead of time following tips about using low salt broth and doubled the amount of balsamic vinegar.I poured the premade sauce over the tenders and baked it all in the sauce for about 20 minutes.It was outstanding. Everybody raved about it and came back for more. I will definitely be adding this to my list of great entertaining meals.

I found that the sauce was very difficult to make. Took much longer to reduce than indicated in the recipe or reviews. Did not find the final result to be worth the effort.

Rating: 3
If simplicity is what you are looking for because its going to be your first attempt at gourmet cooking to impress friend or family, I suggest this recipe as an anaugeral feast. I roasted an entire chicken instead of breast, May I also suggest Quail or pheasent as the entre, after all I think the sauce is the key to this culinary favorite. P.S. Use unsalted broth, and yes it does take a little longer to render down.... unless your cooking at 15,000ft.

Rating: 3
The flavor of this recipe is wonderful. To save time and energy I made it with chicken hindquarters and it worked beautifully. I agree with other reviewers, the sauce takes quite longer to reduce than the recipe suggests. If I were to do it again I would either reduce it for the 45 minutes baking time and make the reduction into a traditional gravy or reduce it in a stock pot to (hopefully) have the increased area help it reduce faster.

Rating: 3
Ab fab! Rice flavour and tender, juicy chicken. I agree that I'd use low salt chicken broth next time - might be better to reduce sauce about 30 minutes (I reduced for 45) so the salt doesn't come through so much. But I got huge compliments!

I served this dish at a dinner party the other night and, after all the compliments, finally had the chance to taste it for myself. People weren't just being nice! It was delicious. (The kids ate it too) The only reason I don't give this recipe four forks is because I made a huge mess while browning the chicken!

The dish had a very nice flavor. It was great to make the sauce ahead of time since it takes about an hour to reduce. I had a friend here from Chicago and she really enjoyed it.

I will definitely cook this meal again!! I roasted the chicken whole after I made pockets in the breasts & thighs, then stuffed them with a blend of Boccocini(?)cheese,fresh basil and garlic. I served the chicken on a bed of mashed swede, potato, yoghurt & garlic with roast vegetables and the sauce and garnished with crispy carrot & parsnip shavings. It was great!!

Outstanding, everyone loved it and I am not a huge fan of Balsamic, the only thing I did different is I used only chicken broth because I didnt feel like running to the store, came out great, but the beef broth would of given it a darker, richer colour and flavor, will make it again for sure.

I make this dish for dinner parties all the time. I think it's great. I use a whole cut up chicken and think the browing process is essential. Make sure you use chicken with the skin on- it will get too dry without that fat barrier.

The sauce took too long to reduce, almost an hour rather than the twenty minutes as stated in recipe. Too much effort for the results. I needed to add cream to the sauce to thicken it and round it out. It was not as good as expected especially with all the good reviews. I would'nt make this again.

This dish is yummy! I made a mistake and did not use low sodium broth, which made it a bit salty. Next time I will add mushrooms to the gravy. I did cut the gravy in half, but wished I had made the whole amount, as it is so tasty. And I used breasts. This is very simple, and great for a person with small children, but tastes like you spent some time on it. If you like mashed potatoes, they would go great with the chicken. Oh, and if you do have small kids, you might want to cut down on the pepper as it coud make it a little hot for them. Quick and good...just what I love!!

I thought this recipe was delicious, and so did my guests. I cut up two chickens into pieces instead of one chicken cut into halves, and we all used the sauce on our potatoes too, so there wasn't too much sauce left after all.

The mention of balsamic-black pepper sauce is what made me decide to try this recipe. I substituted a 7 lb. roasting chicken for the fryer. It was definetly worth it. Increase the cooking time by 30 mins. The sauce is what made the standard roast chicken and potatoes into something special. Be sure to carmelize the shallots to get a nice brown sauce. The next time I prepare this dish I will add more thyme but the amounts of balsamic vinegar and black pepper were right on. I'll add this to me repertoire.
