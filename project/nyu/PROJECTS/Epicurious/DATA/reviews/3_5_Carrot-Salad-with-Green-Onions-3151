We loved this recipe. A little sweet, a little tart and light in flavor. It makes a great make-ahead recipe and keeps well.

This was so simple and delicious. A really easy accompaniment to any meal. I did not use the cabbage leaves as suggested as they are more about presentation than eating.

This is good and low cal too! I substituted fresh mint for the parsley which I think added a lot more zip. I also had to add more dressing to add flavor.

I made this recipe as a side dish with Beef Wellington because I wanted something light, vegetably and different. I made it using a bag of pre-julienned carrots, and I added julienned jicama too. On the dressing, I didn't have parsley so I used dill instead. Also, I used red wine vinegar instead of white. I know these are a lot of changes, but it is very good, and I'm sure the recipe as written is excellent too. Using the bagged carrots, this probably took a total of 10 minutes - easy!

Very good, crisp, fresh, and easy! Will definitely make this again because it's fast, it's still good 4 days later, and it's a change in the taste you've had for years and years. More like a crunchy slaw. Great with beef roast, maybe even adding to top individual servings, ...or adding hot, shredded beef roast OVER it, slightly "cooking" the carrots a bit. ADDED fresh dill, and omitted the red cabbage leaf bed. (If I HAD used, I'd have julienned the red cabbage and mixed with, or "bedded" carrot on cabbage or vice versa to make it easier to eat.) Also, good tailgate/picnic food. And nutritious!
