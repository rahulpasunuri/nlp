I loved this salad. It was exactly what I had been craving. The recipe is a fantastic starting point to customize for your own taste. Since I didn't use the brown sugar, there was no reason to heat the dressing. Just blend, adding a dash more of this or that until it's lip-smacking good. I blanched the cabbage for a moment to soften the fibers a tiny bit. I also added the juice of one lime, toasted sesame seeds (at the recommendation of another reviewer), chopped cilantro, bite-sized pieces of green beans from the garden, and ginger juice, rather than minced ginger. Another ingredient I would add again was chipotle powder, just enough to hint at heat and smokiness, nothing overbearing. I will make this again and again!

Pretty good not great. It does taste better the next day but more liquid pools in the slaw.

I might make it again but I'd add way more carrot and cucumber. My slaw was very wet and there was too much cabbage to carrot and cucumber. I'd also cut the vinegar down a bit. It was too wet at the bottom.

The first time I made it I added asparagus & cut down on the sugar a bit, fantastic... The second time a few days later (we really liked it) a friend suggested toasted sesame seeds, a big YES! We all found it refreshing and I think it will become a regular salad during summer.

Found this to be an interesting twist on slaw. Although I did not make it as part of the menu, it sounds like a great meal for simple, summertime entertaining.

Not great. Looks pretty but not that tasty. Probably won't make it again.
