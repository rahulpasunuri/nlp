so messy but so good. an easy dessert to make. i made it for girls ages 7,6, and 3 and it was too much sugar for them to eat a whole half. i never met a kid who said something had too much sugar but my boyfriend and i love them.

Way too rich. And that was with using regular whole wheat bread and a bit of marshmallow creme.

I made this for my mom and I one night during the summer, we both loved it. I made it with strawberries and marshmallow cream. It totally hits the spot for a sweet treat.

This was a great snack! Instead of using chocolate chips, we used a Hershey bar. Also, we used marshmallow creme and bananas. Next time we'll add peanut butter -- not that it needs improvement; we just love peanut butter. Delicious! It was kinda messy, but to us that was a bonus. Chicka Chicka Yeah!

Made for a kids birthday party but were gobbled up by adults. Those babies were gooey, sweet, crunchy, messy, and fun to eat. Just don't indulge everyday or you'll be buying the next size up.

My husband who is a sweet freaky loved it! Believe it or not my 4 year old who loves chocolate wouldn't touch it!

I left out the bananas because by the time I made it they were all gone and it was still sticky sweet. My son loved it. Now I wonder if adding the bananas would be too much.

While this is in no way an "adult" dish, my roommates and I like it as a midnight snack, and my younger brothers love it as well. To cut down on the sweetness, use marshmallow creme instead. Make sure it is very soft, and spread it thinly on the bread. Focus more on the bananas, as use fewer chocolate chips. Yum!

yummee! so indulgent!! made this for a crowd, and for ease of assembly replaced the toasted marshmallows with marshmallow fluff. they were a huge hit - couldn't fry 'em up fast enough! there seems to be great potential for peanut butter in here somewhere, too. also, the sandwich could easily be fitted for Pie Irons at a campsite, too.

I thought this sounded good, but it was just too sweet. Kind of disgusting, actually.

This is a snack only a stoner could enjoy...

This was so sweet my kids wouldn't eat it. It had all the things they love in it, but when we brought it all together and they took a bite they said "Yuck!" Just a sickly sweet mess.

This recipe should resurrect Elvis! I'm sure he would rate it a 4.

Oh this is a oohy-chewy goodness! :-) And also, I'm really tired of people just typing comments in about recipes such as "diabetics couldn't go near them." Well, no, they wouldn't. So why post that? Fattening foods are a treat -- this is a TREAT -- this is not every day food. Please, if you don't have anything useful, don't post. Keep your comments to the lean foods you actually DO cook and I'll look forward to the helpful suggestions made there.

This was sinful!!! I ate one whole sandwich and half of another!! If my 3 year old hadn't already eaten half I probably would have chowed that down too! OINK!
