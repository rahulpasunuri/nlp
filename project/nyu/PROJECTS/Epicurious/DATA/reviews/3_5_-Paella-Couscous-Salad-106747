Made this for Easter mostly following the recipe. I make my own shrimp broth using the pumpkin and shrimp bisque recipe from this site. I used Italian turkey sausage and roasted red peppers. I also added about 4oz of pancetta crumbled. The meal was a hit.

Made this for a dinner party - was a big hit. Used chicken chorizo (it was all I could find at my local supermarket). I expect this will be my go-to summer salad or light entree - delicious at room temperature, re-heated or served cold on lettuce.

Just served this for a couple's bridal shower and got rave reviews. It's delicious.

I used chicken andouille instead of chorizo, but other than that followed the recipe as stated. Good overall, but the reviewer who said the success of the recipe depends on the seafood used is right! The dish would have been waaaaay better with fresh shrimp and scallops. The flavor of the couscous and dressing is pretty good but next time I will use more shallots and omit the parsley. My boyfriend gave it the thumbs up.

One of my few four forks!! Truly delicious, easy and fast. I too left out the chorizo, first because I couldn't find it, and second time because it was so good without it why bother. I don't let it sit 30 minutes: I love the warm scallop/shrimp taste.

There are not enough forks for this delicious recipe - I couldnt get chorizo, (next time), I just used seafood on hand: scallops, crab meat, prawns and mussles. Incredible dish - make this dish!!

Not a chorizo fan so omitted that and suggest the following other changes: double quantitiy of couscous and liquid, saute red pepper briefly, omit olives, and nuke peas briefly. Makes a more delicate lemony-seafood dish.

Excellant recipe! I added some sauteed chicken breast & left out olives. Also, instead using salad dressing, I just added all components shortly after adding broth mix to couscous. my kids enjoyed this too!!

I made this for a friend who is a caterer and she loved it. It is the perfect summer meal because it is easy to prepare ahead. It is also easy to adjust according to the ingredients you have on hand.

I thought this was a really good recipe. Definitely different than when you use rice. I did double the recipe because my family consists of 6 adults (the kids always come back)! I did have some leftover but it was just as delicious the second day just needing to add a little liquid for the couscous. Absolutely make it again! Give it a try if you like couscous.

I made this dish for 4 adults and everyone had thirds. There was hardly anything left. Used Chorizo Bilbao from La Espanola Market in Harbor City, CA (they mail order) and it was excellent. Omitted the oil and cooked the chorizo for a few minutes in a non-stick skillet before adding the shallots. The chorizo had enough fat in it that no oil was needed. Excellent summer dish!

Sure did not do anything for my taste buds. Company kept mumbling that it was good. Think they were pulling my leg. The next day I fished out the sea food & made a garlic/olive oil base & served it on spaghetti. Found out I don't like the texture of couscous. It's like sawdust. :( Oh--and it would have fed 8 with what I had left over.

Excellent recipe! I omitted the olives and scallops, but left everything else as is. I'll definitely make it again. The recipes serves about 4 people, not 6.

I made this salad for a gourmet group. It recieved excellent reviews. Great presentation with all of the bright colors. I made the recipe as is and it was perfect.

this was excelent and since i used a cuisinart for chopping, did not take long at all. reading the reviews, i noted the confusion that i had about what is chorizo? by butcher also recommended andouille sausage but since i didn't see in the recipe where to cook sausage, i thought they meant the hard chorizo that looks like pepperoni. i found this in the mexican market and diced it up and just added it. so i wonder what it would be like with andouille. i guess you just cook it first, drain fat and slice it up?

Fabulous! As with any seafood dish it's success is reliant on the high quality and freshness of the seafood used. Easy to prepare, easier to serve for special occassions or a do ahead dinner. We absolutely loved it especially as we live on the gulf coast of Texas. With easy access to fresh seafood and easier access to high temperatures most of the year, this was an absolute winner.

This is a great recipe, and can also be made substituting rice for the couscous. However, the garlic in the dressing is too much, so it is best to cut down on it quite a bit. (and I usually use a lot of garlic) I have also used this recipe with out the seafood, with just a chicken broth/wine base, and it is a good side dish--people are always impressed with it.

Unlike most of the reviewers I made this recipe (reduced for 2) as written. It has wonderful flavor and as much as I thought the olives were odd they really make the flavors interesting. The butcher recommended Andouille for the Spanish Chorizo. My experience with chorizo is that it very crumbly so the Andouille was perfect and a little spicy. Given the next opportunity I will serve this at a luncheon or light summer dinner for friends.

I made this for a cookout just recently and it was very good. I do feel the dressing could have used a little more cayenne to give it a little more seasoning. Maybe a little more salt and pepper is all that was needed. I will make this again and it makes quite a bit and it is not your typical same old salad.

I made this for a dinner party of about 10 people, and every person thought it was delicious. I omitted the chorizo so as to make it a seafood salad, and it wasnt missed. It took a lot of preparation, but I will use the recipe again, without doubt.

I made this with cracked wheat instead of couscous and andouille and served it to company. Delicious, got raves all around Great summer all in one meal. It is one of theose prepare in advance and enjoy your company dishes It went well with a Zinfindel. One review said it seemed to be a lot of work, I didn't think so for a group of 8-10.

I also substituted dark meat chicken for the chorizo. It was a last minute meal and I wasn't in the mood to track chorizo down. :) It made me and my guests very happy. Easy and I would highly recommend. BTW, I went a little easier on the salt.

I made this dish with just seafod (shrimp, squid and clams) but otherwise followed all instructions, and it was delicious. The lemon and olives add interesting flavor, I don't usually add either to paella but the dish turned out great.

This was absolutely delicious. A wonderful one-dish meal, and only gets better as leftovers. I am putting this in my list of favorite recipes of all time. If you like seafood, please try this! The olives and chorizo make a great balance for the seafood and lemon, the couscous is an easy alternative to rice, and I found it quite easy to prepare, only really 1 hr from start to finish with fairly minimal chopping (relatively speaking). I will make this again (and again...)

The chorizo I *knew* we had had mysteriously vanished (oops - should've checked before making my shopping trip!), so I went ahead without it. The salad was delicious, but I'm sure it would have been even better with the sausage. Anyway, this was a scrumptious and very pretty dish. Easy to make but a bit time consuming with all the chopping -- worth it, though!

I've made this recipe twice now and I'll be making it again...loved it! The only thing that I changed was the olives; I used kalamata.

Rating: 4
Good recipe. Instead or on top of the scallops, it is closer to paella with some chicken (legs, cut in pieces with the bone). If instad of mixing the salad and the couscous, the couscous goes into a shallow pan and the salad is put on top, it gets more handsome. And, again, closer to the paella, an extremely attractive dish to the eye.

I doubled this recipe for a party recently and it was a tremendous hit!!!! We even ate the leftovers (I'm sure if it was the only salad Ierved there wouldn't have been any left!!) several days later and it still tasted great (if not better). I'm sure I will be making this dish for years to come!!!! p.s. i added artichokes and substituted spanish cava for the poaching liquid.

If you expect paella or couscous you are wrong. Its an hybrid that tastes ....

Loved it. The only things I did differently were to use Aidell's excellent Andouille sausage instead of chorizo and good quality olives--there are so many to choose from, nicoise, cerignola, kalamata, etc. that would be more interesting than jarred pimiento-stuffed green olives.

This was really quite good-- not to hard to make, with complex flavors, and not heavy. I left out the pimento-stuffed olives because they make me and everyone in my family gag, but otherwise...it's a keeper.

Great recipe with a wide variety of flavors, all well balanced. It's colorful, quick and can be made ahead. Leftovers even taste good after a couple of days. A real keeper.
