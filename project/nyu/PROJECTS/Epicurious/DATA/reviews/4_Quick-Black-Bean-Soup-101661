So, the morning of the day we got hit by Hurricane Sandy, I decided I better make some good meal-like soups - along with a Pea Soup and a Carrot soup (also on this site), I made this one. UNBELIEVABLY good. I made them all with home made vegie broths that were in the freezer. a husband who was indifferent to black beans loves it. 2 small changes: I had cans of Hunt's fire roasted tomatoes which added a nice smokey flavor, and I toasted the ground cumin before adding it. If you're facing a weather apocolypse, remember this soup!

This recipe for black bean soup was so quick and easy. It truly is an easy weeknight recipe. This one will be a regular in my kitchen.

I make this all the time. I use the exact ingredients, BUT I don't blend anything. I keep the pot going until its nice and thick, all the water has evaporated. Then I eat it as a black bean side, and blend the left overs for a black bean dip. I can't tell you how many times I've been asked for this recipe

This soup is good, but with the addition of tomatoes, more like a black bean chili or even a lentil soup than traditional black bean soup. I added 1/2 a large green pepper to the onion saute and used only 2 large garlic cloves as I was making this for my 1 year old too. I also used organic canned black beans, which seem creamier to me than conventional. I simmered the soup 40 minutes uncovered and it still was rather thin. I pureed two cups of the soup and added back in to achieve a bit more thickness. Overall, an acceptable and quick meal.

Before simmering the soup, use a motor boat hand blender to puree a portion of the soup right in the pot. The starch of the beans will be released and will take on the liquid flavor even more. Simmer slowly to be sure the starch in the whole beans is set and then let it set for an hour. The taste ramps up every minute it sits there. If you CAN, put it in a covered container and refrigerate overnight. NOW you have soup ! !

Really easy weekday soup. I served it with cornbread on the side. Easy to add some veggies you have on hand -- we had red pepper, celery. This soup is very easy and yummy. I am not so sure about pureeing though - but maybe that's just a tactical preference.

I love this recipe, and I always make it to impress company. HOWEVER, I don't make it as a soup. I actually cook it for an hour to an hour and a half until the liquid has reduced, and serve it as just plain black beans.

Especially nice with fresh plump farmers' market tomatoes and my own black beans. I did not use broth but a little water and organic veggie juice. I also did not puree as I added whole kernel corn as well. I like the rusticity of it.

As per my previous review: I substitute the chipotle for the hot sauce!

Excellent and easy recipe. Have made this a few times and have always substituted a teaspoon or so of chipotle in adobe sauce. I freeze the rest of the chipotles & sauce in tablespoon size portions for other uses or to have on hand for this soup. Gives a nice smokey flavor.

I combined this soup and the spicy black bean soup and modified per reviewers. I liked the soup, but my guests loved it. Sauteed red onion in olive oil, used fresh tomatoes, and added diced green chiles. Topped with avocado as well as greek yogurt and cilantro. Fairly simple and hearty. Could easily add chicken for a more substantial meal.

I make this all the time. It is perfect as written but is also wonderful with slight improvisations. I have used dried beans using the quick cook method and also often add some cooked brown rice at the end. Best with sour cream for sure but find the cilantro to be optional depending upon availability.

This is even better with some slices of thick cut smoked bacon and kale.

I made the beans from dried beans and cooked them with fresh thyme and a bay leaf. Perfect!

Rating: 4
This recipe was a good starting point for experimentation. For first batch, I used dry beans, soaked overnight, instead of canned. Added 1/2 tsp. oregano and juice of 1/4 lime. Had to cook for 3 hours to get beans soft, and needed 4-6 oz. more water. Did not puree, as I like the beans to be whole. Long cooking time dissolved the onions completely and most of the tomatoes as well. Will use fresh diced tomatoes next time, plus 2 bay leaves, and perhaps more oregano and lime juice. When I get spices/proportions right, will try it in a slow cooker. Thanks to Ms. Vaughan, and to all who suggested changes.

I had to make a few changes because of ingredients I did or didn't have. I used fresh plum tomatoes, veggie broth, and chili powder. I also used an immersion blender as others have. Then I put 1/2 cup of rice in the bowl and ladled soup on top. It was very hearty. I would make this again.

This recipe is very quick and easy, and it makes an excellent, warming winter soup. I substitute vegetable broth, puree it with an immersion blender right in the pot (keeps it a little chunkier) and add a little more hot sauce and cumin than recommended. Then, I top it with a dollop of sour cream. Really, really good!

Yummy, yummy! I didn't have 3 cans of black beans in the house so I used a can of Northern white beans and it still tasted wonderful. I also used one 14 oz can of Mexican style chopped tomatoes with jalapenos and one 14 oz can of regular chopped tomatoes and omitted the pepper sauce. My husband loved it, but I couldn't convince my kids to even try it. Of course, that's typical.

I have just prepared this fabulous soup for the second time in the past two weeks. It has been a big hit with all my family, they not only loved it, but, they came back for seconds. It was really easy to prepare. I cooked my own beans and after pureeing the 2 1/2 cups in the blender as the recipe dictated, I added an additional can of beans. We prefer more whole beans in our soup. I will definitely keep this soup recipe as one of my family's favorites.

Thank you Mary Vaughan! This recipe is sooo tasty! I substituted half of the diced tomatoes with Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes as suggested below. Used regular chicken broth (not low sodium -) and it finished perfectly seasoned.

This is a very easy recipe to tweak. Have made it many times, and always add what veggies I have on hand. Today, I used 2 leaks I had on hand, instead of the onionsand used fresh tomatoes. I also use more cumin. Very heart healthy recipe too.

Terrific soup! Super fast and easy, (no soaking beans required). I skipped the chicken broth and added a chicken boulion cube w/ 2 cups of water. I omitted the blending as well, I love the thickness and chunkiness of it. Also added chooped up Goya pimiento and a splash of balsamic vineger - Amazing!!

I'm not even finished cooking it yet and I have to say: YUMMY! Like other reviewers suggested, I used chipolte peppers in adobo sauce instead of hot sauce; it definately brings some depth and smokiness to the dish. I also added 1 small red pepper, half a green pepper, and used red onion. I blended about half and kept the rest chunky. I also cut out a lot of the broth because I like thick soups. The last change was a half a package of frozen corn after blending, and a splash of lime juice. I know this is a lot of changes, but well worth it! I can't wait to sit down for dinner :)

This soup is in my "every month or so" catagory. It's awesome and easy. I've made it for several occasions and always get raves. Suggestion: don't reserve any liquid--it just makes for more dishes to wash, you end up dumping it all into the soup, anyway. Just pour all 3 cans directly into the pot. Also, I alway use fresh tomatoes (husband swears he can tell the difference...) and occasionally add cheddar and/ or sour cream on top. Yum!

used "better than bullion" instead of chicken broth and added 2 tsp of Salsa Lizano from Costa Rica for more depth of flavor. also used fresh tomatoes b/c the hubby used my last can of tom yesterday. i did not blend. even with all of these alterations this soup was great! next time i will skip the 1 c of bean juice, i like a chunky soup.

Wonderful soup for how easy it is. I have tried other black bean chillis and soups and this is my fav so far. Definitely add frozen corn; the sweetness and crispness are a perfect accompanyment. Left out the hot sauce (cuz I am a wimp) but served it on the side, along with cheese and sour cream.

This soup was great. I used a sauteed pablano pepper, and three small, diced and sauteed pork chops. I also used a red onion. We served it with warm, tortillas. It didn't need anything else. I left out one can of broth and put in whole stewed tomatoes crushed with my hand instead of the type of tomato the recipe calls for. To break up the taste I will add fresh diced tomatoes after I puree the soup next time. (I pureed most of the soup all of the way and left about three cups partially pureed). If I serve it for guests I would serve bowls with sauteed pieces of pork and pablano peppers at the bottom of the dish and pour the soup into the dish for each guest as they are sitting at their place. :) I would have sour cream available at the table for those who want it.

This is a staple for my husband and I -very easy to make. For a heartier Northwest meal my husband and I also add some Polska Kielbasa (cut into 1/2 inch disks). We simply sauté it up with the onions and garlic. Also, after reducing the heat to a simmer we add 2-3 pieces of chopped carrots and celery (1/2" to 1" sized pieces) to add more veggies to the meal. We have taken the numerous suggestions from past reviews and also like to add cheddar cheese, cilantro, and sour cream to taste at the end. We blend about 1/2 of the soup to have a mix of big chunks and thicker soup. Yum!

Not only is this is the EASIEST thing in the world to make, it is also really, really good. Even my picky kids liked it, and they are pretty hard to please. I added a teaspoon or so of adobo sauce from a can of chipoltes, and that gave it a nice smokey flavor, then pureed the whole batch with a stick blender (worked great!!). Topped it with sour cream, cilantro, and shredded cheddar. I topped the kids' bowls with crushed tostitos and cheese; they were calling it "taco soup"!

Like some other folks mentioned, I have made a few substitutions here and there based on what I've had on hand when the black bean soup craving hits. I have loved each incarnation,however! Makes a great weeknight meal, topped with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream, scallions, salsa and grated mexican cheese. I also like to serve it with some baked tortilla "chips": tortillas I've cut into wedges, spritzed with oil spray, and baked at 425 or so for a few minutes, until browned and crispy. YUMMY!

This is a great soup. I did a few things different, but judging from everyone's reviews it seems like it's great as is, too. I didn't have thyme, so I omitted it. I didn't have low sodium chicken broth, so I used the powder but I will reduce it to less than 2 cans since it was a bit thin. And, I used pureed tomatoes instead of the chopped. All in all, a great soup!

Rating: 3
This soup was tasy and very easy to make. I like really thick black bean soup, so this was too thin for my tastes. Following the advice of previous reviewers, I added only 1 and a half cans of broth, but it was still thiner than I like it. Also, the canned diced tomatoes I used were pre-mixed with lime juice, chiles, and cilantro, which gave the soup a nice spicy flavor. Not hot at all, so serve with Cholula on the side for guests who like it hot.

This was delicious. Much better than some restaurant versions I've had. I added sour cream, cilantro, lime and monterey jack as garnish. Was a little loose - next time I will add less chicken broth.

Delicious! I accidentally pureed the whole soup the first time I made it --and it was really good, so I did it again deliberately the second time. I also pureed a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and used 2 teaspoons of that as my hot sauce. I LOVE the smoky taste of chipotles, and it goes really well with this soup. I also took the tip from some other cooks here and added the lime juice - 1/2 lime is just enough to add some tang without it tasting lime-y. One last tip - I also used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of just plain tomatoes. I find these to be more flavorful. Takes a little longer than 45 minutes for me to make it, but maybe I'm just a slow cook... and the extra pureeing I did probably added some time.

This recipe was so easy to make and really tasted fabulous! Some tips to improve on it: use more spice (jalapenos, hot sauce, garlic), definitely go with low salt chicken broth, and serve with sharp cheddar and sour cream. Also, while it tasted great, I might try to thicken it up more next time...

Good hearty soup. I find much less oil is needed and I like to reserve some beans and mix them into the puree for texture.

I halved this recipe made this soup in the slow cooker (crock pot). I browned the onions and garlic first, then added them to everything in the cooker. About 2 hours on high, then I pureed part of it, and added 1/2 pound of smoked ham. Another hour on low and it was done. I didn't decrease the cumin or hot sauce though, and thought it came out great! Being in the slow cooker, it was more soupy than stewy as one person reported in a previous review. Added a little fresh lime on top when served, too. Although slow cooking it makes it take longer, I found it easier to not be in front of the stove, especially with a toddler at home!
