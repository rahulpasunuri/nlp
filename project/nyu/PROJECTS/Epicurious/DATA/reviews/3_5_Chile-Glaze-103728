Fantastic with copper river salmon done in a pepper and fennel topping. Took a bit of work to find the tamarind paste, but well worth it. Turns out a beautiful color.

I used dried red chiles and since I could not find tamarind paste, I substituted tandoori paste since the first ingredient was tamarinds. Good glaze, but REALLY hot.

The glaze is time consuming but well worth it. I made a double batch of glaze and froze the remainder in small containers for one of those "dinner in a hurry" moments. The salsa was a nice contrast to the heat of the glaze.

One word HOT!!!!!! very HOT!!!!! so be very carefull if you are not a spicy food lover, just lower the amount of chiles and DO NOT ADD ALL THE SEEDS! another option is add more tamarind pulp and honey! Great with chicken!

My entire family loved this dish, despite the fact they're not crazy about salmon. The fennel seeds add a nice touch, and the orange salsa was a welcome break from tomatoes. I prepared the asparagus with arugula mayonnaise dish with this one. What a hit!
