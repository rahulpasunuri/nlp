I have to say, this is a great dish! I made it on the grill, and it was such a refreshing take on a burger. I found that mine didn't fall apart, but then I followed the recipe to a T.

Didn't have any mint on hand so used up some mint jelly instead. Added an egg to help everything stick together, however it all still fell apart on the grill. Even though they were absolutely delicious and will make again and again. Great way to use up left over roast lamb.

Absolutely wonderful; I grind my own lamb from a boneless leg so I can make it very lean. Just fine without the eggplant, too. Friends will beg for this one!

This was great! I made it on my George Foreman grill, and also added onion, garlic and cilantro to the lamb. I served it with lebanese bread salad (Fattoush) (lettuce, tomatoes, cukes, scallions, mint, cilantro, lemon juice and oil and toasted pita bread). My family has requested it be added to our regular menu.

A very yummy and different burger. I have not used lamb -- I am sure it is fantastic, but I have issues, so I have made it with ground turkey. It may not be the best substitution, but it makes a very good burger. I will continue to make this when we are in the mood for something a little more exciting.
