Wow, high fat but delish. Didn't have enough tomato paste so used some canned tomatoes as well. Nice to have the tomaotoes in there, will do again next time. Next time will probably use pancetta instead of bacon. Consider cooking bacon first and draining out the fat.

I made this dish and absolutely loved it! I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1 1/2 lbs Italian sausage, 3/4 lb ground beef, and 3/4 lb thickly sliced bacon. I served it with the Arugula Salad with Balsamic Onions, Goat Cheese, and Candied Walnuts.

This is a different bolognese not very tomatoey but it was still a healthy meal. I did not use spicy sausage or antelope. I did use bacon, beef, and sausage the results were quite tastey. My husband loved it, especially with some semolina bread. Very heavy, alittle goes a long way.

I have been making Bolognese sauce for many years. While there are amny recipes, this one strays too far and is missing some important features. First: itlaina sausage is form the South and loaded with fennel- not a spice used in bolognese sauce! Second: The key spices of nutmeg and cloves are missing! Third: Way way too much milk! Fourth:NO tamoato paste! Tomato sauce is used and only about 8oz This may be an interesting and tasty sauce, but it is NOT Bolognese!

Meaty and tasty but very very very heavy. I prefer a lighter bolognese and one with more tomato to it-- this only has paste and it has too much meat for my taste.

I made this dinner on a Sunday when I had nothing to do. I scaled it down to half of what was originally called for and there was still enough to feed an army. The pasta was delicious and the Bolognese was fantastic. I used a spicy Italian sausage and pancetta in lieu of the antelope and bacon. Everything about it was great.

Being somewhat pressed for time and not having antelope sausages on hand, I used the spicy Italian sausage. The kids loved the result and devoured it - my husband and I agreed that it tasted almost exactly like the American chop suey we remembered from school cafeteria lunches. Very bland and completely lacking the rich earthiness of a traditional Bolognese. The combination of the milk and tomato paste produced a sauce that resembled nothing so much as canned tomato soup.

We made this bolognese for a dinner party, and it was a big hit! Much more tasty than your traditional bolognese. We used 2lbs organic, 85% lean beef, 1lb hot Italian sausage, and a little over 3/4 lb each of venison and bacon. (There was no antelope sausage at the meat market, and the elk sausage they had had berries and wouldn't have worked with this sauce.) Otherwise we followed the sauce recipe exactly. We didn't use this pasta recipe - used Jamie Oliver's with 1 cup bread flour, 2-1/2 cups semolina flour, 10 yolks and 2 whole eggs, and it was delicious! Having a hand-crank pasta machine was key!
