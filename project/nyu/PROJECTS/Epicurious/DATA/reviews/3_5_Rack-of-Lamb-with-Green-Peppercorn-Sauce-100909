I wasn't sure about the sauce when I tasted it as I was cooking, but when paired with the lamb, it was delicious! A nice change from the herb & crumb crust, easy enough for a weeknight dinner.

This was a wonderful recipe. I rubbed the lamb with kosher salt, fresh pepper, thyme and a little bit of olive oil and put it in the oven for 15 minutes and it was perfect. I served it with a parsnip, carrot, potato soup.

Boy, only 67% would make this recipe?!? I loved it and have made it several times. (After my rave rating of 4 forks and a resounding YES I see that the rating has gone up to 75%...hopefully more people will try it now.)

I used this recipe for cooking the lamb only, as we normally cook it on the grill. I baked the lamb for 20 min. and let it sit for 10. It was medium, a bit overdone for us, but still good.

Recipe delicious. However, the cooking time was way off. We cooked ours for eighteen minutes and did not let the lamb sit. It was well done.
