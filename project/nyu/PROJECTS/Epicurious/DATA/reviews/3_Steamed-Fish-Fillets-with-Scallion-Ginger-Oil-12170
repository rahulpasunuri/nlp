This was a great way to serve a healthy meal when time is of the essence. I skipped the veg oil, and subbed garlic (3 small cloves) for the scallions. I grated the ginger, and added some rice wine vinegar and soy to make an adequate amount of sauce. I used frozen baramundi that I had in the freezer, and this sauce was perfect.

Actually I do not object to cooking in the microwave, however, to steam fish, I prefer using my Bamboo Steamer. It comes out fabulous!!!

Like others, I didn't like the idea of microwaving. Haven't used the micro to cook since college, and then it was a bad idea. However, I poached the fish in Trader Joe's ginger soy broth with added ginger and sesame oil. I used fresh wild escolar filets. Great flavor and texture, super easy weeknight dinner. :-)

I substituted the ingredients for the sauce from The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook, by Gloria Bley Miller, possibly the best chinese cookbook ever! Turned a 3* recipe into a 4* one. Use 1 Tbsp. cooking sherry; 2 Tbsp. soy sauce; 1/2 tsp. sugar; 1/2 salt; 1 tsp. peanut oil; 2 slices ginger root, shredded; and 1-2 scallions, cut in 1/2-inch sections.

We liked this fish, made it with very fresh sea trout filets, but to avoid any toughening by the microwaving, we baked it in the sauce (with vinegar & soy sauce) and it came out great.

I thought this dish was just OK. My fish turned out a bit on the tough side. Next time I will try baking it and see if it works better.

Ed obviously never met a busy family or a college student! Microwaves are wonderful, and you can even buy microwave skillets and such.

Microwaving is my favourite method of cooking any fish that needs poaching or steaming. This recipe works well. I have a m/w which cooks by sensor so cannot over cook; I would use mor seasoning and prehaps marinate the fish in soy and ginger before cooking to increase the flavour.

Martha Stewart and others may not care for microwaves, but this dish is a timesaver for busy working folks. We enjoyed it tonight with butternut squash and napa cabbage slaw and will definitely make it again. Very easy and quick to prepare and cook; and the ginger root and hot sesame oil gave the fish the snap we loved. Soy sauce and vinegar were nice additions, too!

Anyone that would micro-wave anything other than to reheat leftovers should be hung by thier thumbnails. Ed Abel
