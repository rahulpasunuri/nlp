I'm on a chickpea kick. I made this with some peas I soaked overnight and cooked in the morning, I did not know what I was going to do with them until I saw this recipe. It was saucy and delicious with eggs for dinner. I am sure the bread you use affects the thickness. I left it out completely and thicked with mashed chickpeas. Be generous with the vinegar.

This was a lot more like a soup. Maybe I should have drained the chickpeas before adding the spinach and bread paste. Not sensational.
