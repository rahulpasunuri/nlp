Quite easy and tasty. Good to have the tip of less butter from other reviews. Was surprised how well the ginger and lime embedded itself into the overall flavor of the shrimp. Will make this dish for company as it is a no-stress recipe.

Very quick and simple recipe. I didn't change the recipe but grilled the shrimp on the BBQ. I left the shells on as I used 8 count shrimp which take a little longer to cook and the flesh doesn't char if you leave the shells on.

We really enjoyed this one. After reading the other reviews, I added more lime juice and peel and used less butter. Like the cook from Royal Oak, MI, I served this with rice mixed with pine nuts and parsley. Also served with a broccoli and orange salad. Yummy meal!

I love this recipe. Its easy and everyone always loves it. I serve it with jasmine rice and steamed brocolli. I drizzle a bit of sesame oil over the top of the brocolli. My parents use the same recipe but substitute tilapia for the shrimp sometimes

This recipe was very tasty and really easy. I'm sure I put more ginger and lime then it called for because I usually don't measure and just add based on taste. This would be really easy and good to make for a dinner party.

I can't believe the raves about this recipe. I thought it very bland, other than the cayenne (which is the only thing I liked about it). Could not taste the ginger or lime. The Lemon Garlic Baked Shrimp on this site is much better ... more flavor and less work.

Very quick and easy recipe to make. I substituted olive oil for the butter making the dish a little lighter, and server it with cauliflower, carrotts and snow peas. Yum!

after reading the reviews i opted to cut out 1T of butter & replace it w/ 1/4c of stock & 1t of soy sauce, up the ginger by 1/2T and up the lime juice by one whole lime. then i seeded & chopped one small green chilli and threw it in the roasting pan w/ the shrimp. served w/ jasmine rice & asparagus... mmmmm... the perfect amount of flavor and i've made it for spice lovers and phobics alike. so fast & yummy will definitely throw together again.

This came out really well. I added a little brown sugar to the butter & brushed it on before AND after grilling. We were VERY happy with the results & I've made it again for my boyfriend's family at a barbeque...

Simple and tasty. Definitely less butter and more spices. Sprinkled w/ paprika before serving.

Good concept, but to buttery. Next time I will use less butter and more spices. I also cooked the shrimp on the grill.

I served this for a dinner party. The dish was very simple and also got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe. I also used a little more cayenne, plenty of fresh ground pepper plus I added a tablespoon of Teriyaki. Steamed snow peas were a hit with it as well.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this. As most of the other reviewers found there was too much butter and very litlle taste of ginger and lime. I did them under my preheated broiler and at about two minutes a side they were not even slightly browned but they were a bit overcooked.

I'm glad I read the other reviews before making this recipe! I took your advice and decreased the butter while increasing the cayenne (I used powder vs. red pepper flakes for extra punch), increasing the lime juice (and sprinkling some on top when done) and increasing the ginger. I broiled the shrimp, and must say it was delicious. I served it with rice mixed with parsley, chives and pine nuts. I'll definitely make this again.

This dish was easy to make. I used olive oil instead of butter, skewered and grilled rather than broil. Simply served over rice pilaf it was a hit with my sometimes picky family.

I was also dissappointed with the dish. I grilled the prawns on skewers and that definately made the dish. But it was too much butter, and the ginger and lime didn't give it enough kick.

I thought this recipe was great - good and spicy with a great mixing of flavors. I used good-quality fresh cayenne and that made all the difference. With rice pilaf and snow peas, this has entered the repertoire of my regular recipes.

I was surprised that this recipe didn't pack more of a flavor punch--I didn't find it spicy, and the ginger and lime couldn't cut through all the butter. If I made it again, I would definitely grill the shrimp instead of broiling them, and I'd up the amount of cayenne. I also might dribble a little fresh lime juice over it just before serving.
