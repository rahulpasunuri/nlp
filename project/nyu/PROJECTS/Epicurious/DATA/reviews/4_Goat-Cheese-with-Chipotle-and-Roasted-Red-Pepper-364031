Definitely a keeper. Next time I would wait until ready to serve before adding the pepper mixture. It was a bit messy with the oil running onto the plate.....but still was a hit.

This dish is always a hit when I bring it to parties. Rather than rolling out the goat cheese, I just leave the red pepper mixture in a bowl with a log of goat cheese and some crackers alongside. It isn't as pretty, but it still tastes just as good! If you have leftovers, the pepper/goat cheese mixture is nice in quesadillas or on top of pasta.

I found this sauce odd. People ate it, it wasn`t a horrendous flop, but I would try a different combination with the goat cheese next time.

This is so delicious and also visually gorgeous. I'm making it again this afternoon for a wine tasting party. I do use the pepitas and I think it makes a difference. The only change I make is to use half peppers and half kalamata olives, chopped. Easy and addicting!

So good and so easy to make! Will definitely make again! I also made the topping ahead of time but kept it separate and just spread it on top of the cheese before serving (and sprinkled with pepitas that I had also toasted beforehand). Made as written except only used about 1 TBSP olive oil instead of 1/4 cup and I don't think it was missed at all.

I made this for our Christmas Eve and it got RAVE reviews from everyone who tasted it. It is easy to make and a crowd pleaser. I followed the recipe as directed.

I have made this appetizer several times and get rave reveiws each time. It is a somewhat surprising mix of ingredients that create flavores you can't get enough of. The cumin can be a bit strong for some, so I use a little less sometimes.

This was really, really very good! I made the goat cheese log hours ahead and refrigerated it. The topping I kept out at room temperature.I let the goat cheese sit out for an hour before serving it with crostini and crackers. The pepitas are a must for me. This is visually exciting and the guests were wowed. My only change was using ground cumin instead of seeds.You will love this one!

Quick, straightforward and tasty. We served on fresh ciabatta bread, lightly toasted and omitted the pumpkin seeds.

Awesome sooo easy to make. Still fabulous without the pumpkin seeds. Everytime I take it to a get together I get asked for the recipe. Definitely keeping in the retinue to use again and again.

I have made this 3 times now and loved it each time. I did use a whole chipotle and diced it for more flavor. I also chopped the pumpkin seeds. Love it.

Amazing appetizer! Served it the other night to a big group and it got rave reviews. They all loved it, ate almost every morsel, and asked for the recipe. Was THAT good. Also very easy and pretty. Will make again for sure.

This is a super easy appetizer...and tasty. I could not find pepitas and it still tasted great. I added additional chipolte since it wasn't hot enough for my taste. Will definitely make this again.
