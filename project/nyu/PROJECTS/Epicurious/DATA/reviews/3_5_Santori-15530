I've made this cake every Roshashana since it was first published in Gourmet. It's really delicious. Just this weekend, the New York Times published an old recipe for a Hugenot cake which is built on the same principal. Lots of sugar creates a chewy interior.Plus, it's a cinch to make. This year, I'm using the first crop of honeycrisps.

I have made this every year since I first saw it in Gourmet. This year I'm making it on Christmas, with half apples and half cranberries. I have always used three cups of sugar. I think with the cranberries I'll keep it the same and see how that works.

I have an apple tree in my front yard which yields many, many tart (not sweet!) apples. I try to find suitable recipes for them and this one is my hands down favorite. I have made four batches so far this year , it is quick, easy and yes, very much like an apple blondie. It is *not* a typical apple cake to be sure, but for those of us facing endless apple dishes every year - it's a welcome and delicious departure.

I wish I could say I agree with the hubbub. This was not what I was hoping for at all. More like a weird apple brownie. And it got soggy after one day, so it doesn't save well. I found it too sweet, which makes sense since the sugar and flour amounts are equal--3 cups! It wins a half point for ease of preparation, but I won't be making it again.

The cake they sell at the Pasta & Co stores is baked in a large loaf pan and served by the slice. I would prefer this to the 9 by 13 pan in this recipe, but am unsure how to adjust the baking time or temperature. Any advice?

This recipe was very easy to make. Its a very unique cake in taste; unlike any other cake I have made. I liked the way the crunchy top contrasted with the moist interior. I also liked the fact that it wasn't overly sweet and that there was no need to frost the cake. Will definitely put this recipe in with my keepers.

I brought this cake to my office once and not a crumb was left over. I make it every autumn. It's sweet yet sophisticated. I like it hot with vanilla ice cream. It's also superb for breakfast with coffee.

Clipped this out of the magazine years ago and finally got around to making it. The requestor said "this is the most wonderful cake I have ever eaten"-- which probably set my expectations too high. Nice chewy & crunchy cake that took almost no time to prepare, but not exactly to die for.....

delicious and thankfully easy, too. i like my desserts sweet, and the 2 1/3 cups of sugar that i used was plenty. this may have been helped by the fuji apples i used instead of a tart variety -the fuji became soft and creamy by the time the cake was done. (i actually prefer this to firm apple pieces in cake.) so yes yes this is great - very tasty and MOIST, with a crunchy sugar crust for contrasting texture.

Although this tasted very good, my cake turned out grayish colored so not pretty for company. The cake also freezes well. But honestly, I'm switching to the Apple-Walnut Cake (Feb96) recipe, which I like better since it also comparably tastes great and browns prettily.

How can we spread the word?? This is the MOST delicious apple cake (and possibly cake, period) I have ever had. People always devour it in minutes and beg me for the recipe. I use 2.5 cups of sugar but after reading the other reviews, I might switch down to 2 cups. I also use some combination of apples and pears, and it might be interesting to try a pears-only cake sometime. (I'll have to use a tart pear, however, so it survives the 2 hours of baking.) I also always omit walnuts, personal choice. Last thing -- I cook this cake in a bundt pan, lining with parchment as much as possible (previously before lining, I'd have to pry it out of the pan with a spoon), and spraying oil on each side of the parchment. Then, the cake slides out, and I peel off the parchment, and the shape of the cake makes for pretty presentation. I'm considering an angel food cake pan, too. And it's always easy to sprinkle with powdered sugar if the surface of the cake isn't perfect. Have fun with it -- it's a find, this cake.

A very simple yet tasty dessert. I agree on the 2 cups of sugar and the ice cream on the side.

I have to agree with Mary Lehane. Your house smells great when the cake is baking. I gave to my classmates as a Christmas gift and they loved! I made only two adjustments: put only 2 cups of sugar and used a baking sheet instead of a glass baking dish and it works well.

This is a delicious cake, almost addictive. I really liked it best just plain at room temperature. It forms a crust that almost appears caramelized. An added bonus - the house smells wonderful as the cake is baking.

This is a fabulous cake. But, IMO, the best garnish is a caramel sauce. YUM. I agree, works as coffee cake or dessert.

this recipe is easy to make,has simple ingeredients but tastes wonderful!Though I made a few adjustments like cutting the amount of sugar in half, because we don't like it too sweet. The vanilla ice cream is a great accompaniment and adds a pleasant contrast to the cake.

This recipe creates a great product that could be used either as a dessert or a coffee cake.
