Not bad, but not wow. I wouldn't bother boiling the beans next time. I like them more crisp.

The water step is unnecessary and acually damages the great fresh texture and smell that the dish has prior to that point (makes it more like boiled cabbage). It's good, but would be much better just searing the brussels and warming the beans at the end.

This turned out really well. I used fresh mint and the flavor of the mint and the red pepper flakes were very complimentary.

Very good, but I sauted garlic w/the oil and pepper, and added a little lemon juice when sauteing the green beans and sprouts. Definitely would make it again.

This ended up delicious. But I added butter to the oil before i sauteed the Brussels sprouts. Also this dish required quite a bit more seasoning than the recipe said to add. I added Mrs. Dash, pepper, more salt, and bay leaves to get the flavor i wanted. Really made the difference.

This was a great way to serve vegetables to suit a variety of tastes. Those who don't like brussel spouts can have the beans but we found that everyone tried the brussel sprouts and some of the picky eaters actually found that they liked them. I used 1 lb. brussel sprouts to 2 lbs of green beans and there were leftovers from 10 people.

I thought these were a good, delicious way to serve Brussel sprouts. Although, I think it was missing a little acid.
