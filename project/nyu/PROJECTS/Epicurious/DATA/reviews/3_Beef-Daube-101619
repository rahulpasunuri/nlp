Just a bit of advise, flour can completely alter the flavor of any sauce. Omit flour all together, do everything else as directed and thicken at the end with corn starch. much better

The critical ingredients missing here are balsamic vinegar and anchovies. I've made daube de boeuf for years with a 3:1 proportion of red wine to balsamic vinegar, anchovies help add complexity too. The cubed meat should be tossed with herbs de provence and olive oil, covered, and allowed to sit in the refrigerator overnight. Daube is also meant to simmer for hours in a heavy dutch oven, four hours or more is best. Leave the vegetation for a side dish or pull out the carrots when serving. Use less flour, approximately 1 tablespoon and add it just before serving or not at all as the sauce has reduced and thickened itself.

I made this with lamb shoulders and assort pieces from a lamb we bought. instead of beef. This recipe takes short cuts. What I did was simmer the lamb bones in the beef stock to be added. The meat chucks need to be cut 2". I cooked it down seperated the meat and the sauce. skimmed the sauce and then cooked aadditional onions and garlic and added that to the sauce. Daube requires slow warm up and simmering. I did not need to add any flour. As is this recipe did not stand up to big red wines. With these changes it was fabulous.

Glue. And does not taste right. There was too much flour and the carrots would have distinegrated if I did not follow others' advice. Wont do this again.

I wouldn't exactly follow the recipe, but I would make it using a smaller amount of orange peel, a milder wine, and adding some tomatoes. Every other daube recipe I've made calls for tomatoes, and I think they really make the meal.

I'm with KiKi's review on this one. Yuck! Maybe I royally messed up on this one. If not, double YUCK!

Braved a blizzard to get the ingredients for this dish yesterday since I knew I'd be snowed in, and it was definitely worth it! The house smelled amazing! Used boneless extra-lean beef chuck ribs and didn't have to skim any fat off the top. Also cut the carrots into slightly bigger chunks so they wouldn't disintegrate and left them in. I *loved* the wine flavor in the meat, and will probably marinate even longer next time for more flavor. Perfect served over wide egg noodles!

I have made this several times, and my family keeps on requesting it.

This is one of my favorite recipes and fairly close to one that I used to make a French restaurant. I would suggest leaving out the flour until the end. The wine will reduce a lot so you want to control the thickness of the sauce. Thicken at the end with a brown roux or a little corn starch dissolved in water. If you're really motivated make a reduced brown veal stock and cook the dish with the wine AND veal stock. Serve it over garlic mash potatos. It'll be well worth the effort.

The Joy of Cooking has a fantastic Beef Daube recipe. I made it for a dinner party of 6 and it was incredible. Some of the ingredients are different and the wine is white. I followed the directions exactly and it was the best dish I have made (and tasted). My cooking is average and nothing to brag about usually! I also do a shorter version of this, which is tasty. Just brown onions and garlic, then brown meat. Then cover with can of fat free, low sodium beef broth and can of diced tomatoes. (Could add wine). Simmer for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Add carrots (and sometimes small red potatoes). Simmer for another 1/2 hour with lid on. Uncover and reduce sauce to thicken (simmer-boil for another 1/4 hour).

I'm not sure what this was supposed to taste like, but I can't imagine that my results were right. I followed the recipe, but ended up with a thick, gooey dish. The taste was merely OK--the orange flavor came out very strong, and the wine too, of course. Considering the time and the expense of making this recipe, I was very disappointed and definitely would not make it again! I'm just glad I didn't make it for company!

I made this after my husband had some daube de boeuf at a French restaurant that specializes in the cuisine of Provence and told me that it was one of the best things he had ever tasted. This rendition was perfectly okay, but nothing to get excited about, a sentiment we shared. It is missing something, anchovies, perhaps? It certainly is easy enough, but I think I am going to pull out my Julia Child cookbooks and see if I can find a recipe for the real thing.

I ruined some boneless beef ribs on the barbeque pit last week. I kept the meat thinking I could use it for something. I found this recipe and it made awful, tough meat extremely tender. Wow, this was good, although the "smoked" taste took away from it, I think. I can't wait to have some leftovers and try it in a tortilla!

We love this recipe. I have no idea how it compares to authentic Daube, but for me, it works!

About half the effort of Julia Child's Beef Bourguignon and just as tasty.

I used to have a personal chef business for 5 years. I made this recipe for numerous clients, who asked for it again and again. My family raves about it. It is the ultimate comfort food.

I really like this dish. I took the veggies out as the recipe directed. After all, they were quite mushy. I followed this recipe precisely and I was very pleased with the results. I also agree that this is very nice with the Wild Mushroom Saute.

Wonderful recipe! I served it for dinner last night over wide egg noodles and with roasted vegies which were a nice compliment. I cubed the meat smaller than suggested (2" sounded so big) and coated the meat with flour before sauteeing and found the meat to be fork tender and the sauce thick enough to eliminate the last 45 minutes of cooking. I took the advice of other reviewers and left the vegies in the sauce.

I agree as others have said that this recipe took alot of time. I thought it was worth the effort. Can't wait to order it someday in Provence! I also left in the vegetables. Excellent overall. A wonderful comfort meal.

An excellent recipe, which takes time but is well worth the effort! I substituted a bottom round roast instead of chuck and used dried thyme instead of fresh. Using a good bottle of red wine is key. I left the vegetables in because they were difficult to get out, and they tasted great. This dish was a hit at my dinner party! And it feeds an army!

This recipe turned a Chuck roast into a "Sir Charles" roast. Good wine is key - we used a Shiraz and marinated the beef for 24 hours - it enhanced the complexity of the flavors.

I amde this recipe shortly before visiting Provence this year. Once there, naturally I had to try this specialty dish at a restaurant. Mine wasn't exactly the same, but it was a pretty darn good reproduction of something made in Avignon. Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious and easy but takes time. Well worth every minute. The orange flavors are amazing!

I have served this twice to company and had rave reviews. Best if it is made 2 days ahead. I served it with the WILD MUSHROOM SAUTE, May, 1999 and asparagus for color. It is a real crowd pleaser. It calls for a hearty red wine, a cool evening and candlelight!
