Yum! Can't believe how easy and tasty this was. It feels very naughty, but rather this than a KFC any day.

Another good recipe - the chicken stayed really moist and tasty, and it was far healthier than buying a similar thing to eat out. Yum!

This was really good (husband gave it a "10"). After reading the other reviews, I changed the quantities of some items, halving the butter and increasing the mustard. I also doubled the curry powder and added a bit of cumin. Plus, cutting the skinless chicken breast into smaller pieces (credit card sized or so), cut the cooking time down to 20 min. Moist, crunchy, and super easy to make. Perfect with the rice, bean and corn salad!

I totally understood the mixed reviews once I made this. It tasted ok with boneless skinless chicken breasts (all my Husband will eat) but fabulous with drumsticks. I used whole wheat bread instead of white and took the other reviewers sugestions and added more dijon mustard, curry and added cumin. This recipe definitely needs chicken with skin on for the added flavor.

I use panko, too, for this recipe, like other reviewers. I have used Penzey's Italian Dressing Spice combo for the herbs. It's a great recipe and works well with pounded chicken breast for really quick dinners.

I used drumsticks for this recipe and they came out juicy and flavorful. As others complained about the lack of flavor I decided to add a little more dijon mustard and a little less butter and also doubled the curry amount and added a little cumin as well. I would make this again in a heartbeat as it is fast, easy and delicous!

YUM...and super easy....Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned the corn flakes....i now use all corn flake crumbs, i also incr. the curry to 1/4 tsp. i only use chicken breast cutlets, they cook up in 15 min @ 400 deg. Such an easy weeknight dish!!!

My husband and I liked this very much. Great weekday easy dinner,not gourmet. I modified by using a combination of plain bread crumbs & Corn Flake crumbs. The mayo/mustard coating w/a hint of curry made the chicken moist and slightly different than other oven-fried recipes.

Very nice flavor. Like the texture of the breading. Kid friendly recipe.

Shake and bake is better and less work! No one in my family tasted the spices, mayo, mustard, or butter I put in.

Used store bought bread crumbs. Made this as a quick idea for dinner. It is good for just that, quick easy dinner for the family. Nothing to write home about but a decent recipe.

I make this all the time, but instead of the breadcrumbs, I use (don't laugh) Oven Fry for chicken. It is so crunchy and delicious. I usually cut the chicken into small pieces too. Oh, I also omit the butter for fat sake and add a splash of water to the mixture to thin it up. Excellent!

Don't even bother with this recipe. Even Shake n Bake is easier and tastier than this. Both my husband and I agreed that it was so bland and tasteless. As one other reviewer said if you want to take the time to totally rewrite this recipe you might have something, but why just find another recipe that works?

I always think it's funny when people review a recipe and say "this is a great recipe!" and then describe how they totally changed it. Well, I have finally broken down and mutated a recipe but it turned out pretty good. I used 1/2 breadcrumbs, 1/2 Panco breadcrumbs. Used sweet / hot mustard and, believe it or not, orange juice instead of lemon juice. It turned out pretty good and definitely interesting. Kids (9 & 7) ate the meat before the rice for once!

Tasty, simple and quick. I used Honey Panko (packaged breadcrumbs) and cut the recipe in half (using one chicken breast) for a solo-lunch, used a more mustard than mayo, and more pepper than salt.

Great recipe! I used seasoned bread crumbs and cut out the salt and pepper. I also used chili powder instead of curry. My whole family loved this.

What a wonderful dish, and so simple and delicious. I used chili powder also, instead of curry powder. I added some garlic and horseradish. Then rolled chicken in Progresso flavored bread crumbs. I cooked on the baking stone for exactly 40 mins. As you can tell, my husband and I like spices. Recommend everyone to try this dish. Nice and easy for company too!!!

I thought this was great. It was so easy to make and it had great flavor and stayed juicy. I used store bought bread crumbs since I wanted something quick. I agree about the comment of not making a proportionate amount of bread crumb mixture to increase serving size. I doubled it and had way too much. The bread crumb mixture quantities are plenty for four servings. I used chili powder instead of curry and cooked it on a baking stone - this avoided any issues with sticking and left the chicken crispy. Delicious!

This is a definite remake and I give it 3 forks. I used chicken tenders flattened which cuts time down to about 7 minutes a side, depending on your oven. I'm trying it with shrimp. mmm--

Re: the bread crumb controversy, i didn't bother making my own, just used store-bought plain ones. It was not browning on top when I peeked, so I turned it over. big mistake. the skin stuck to the pan so i had to eat the crispy bits out of the pan with a fork. oh well. have done this before. Did anyone else have trouble re: failure to brown, or sticking? It had a great flavor, probably helped by fresh natural chix. also, i didn't have Dijon mustard, so used Polish mustard. I will make this again, greasing the pan next time. oh, one more thing: it was plenty for a whole quartered chicken. Unless that was my problem, not using enough gunk.

Very good!!!

Because i did not have enough store-bought crumbs, i had to make the recipe as stated. The crumbs did turn out crunchy on the finished chicken. It was very juicy and tender, and not at all greasy because i cooked it on a broiler pan in the oven. I look forward to trying this recipe again with veal or chicken parmigiana.

It has been a great help knowing this recipe. It is easy and fast. Thank you,

This is the best chicken I've ever cooked. It tastes great. But I must believe it is awful for you. First you cover it in butter; then all the oil that would have dripped out on to the pan gets absorbed by the bread crumbs. I completely agree with those who said to use ready-made bread crumbs. If you make a large batch of this stuff (recipe is for one serving only), don't use a proportional amount of butter and bread crumb mixture: it's too much and you'll throw most of it out.

Don't bother with the "homemade" bread crumbs in this recipe. An earlier cook was right in saying they don't brown well. Use store bought bread crumbs (preferably flavored with herbs) or panko. This recipe is very adaptable to tweaking. Use the herbs and spices you like. Chicken can also be used aa a base for another recipe, such as chicken parm, etc, without the frying involved. Very quick and easy for a weeknight meal, but I wouldn't serve it to company, unless it was a bunch of five year olds.

My family absolutely loves this recipe and I have made it several times already! It is a keeper.

I could not get the bread to darken, it was still very moist. I had to bake it an extra 10 minutes to have it be done. But my children loved it, so I will make it again.

This tasted mainly of mustard. I could not even detect the curry taste and I used a hot curry. Instead of bread crumbs, I used panko as I like the crunchiness, but still not very exciting recipe.

I thought this recipe was terrific! My partner wasn't as impressed, however. The chicken was juicy and the flavor was just right. Next time I will take the chicken skin off to make the recipe more healthy.

My husband and I were disappointed with this dish. The butter-mustard mix was mostly bland. The dominant taste was of mustard, and I even used less than the recipe called for. I added some chili pepper and red pepper, but even that did not improve it enough. The trouble might be that I used three boneless skinless breasts rather than a variety of pieces with skin. Maybe the skin and extra fat are what make this recipe sing. I doubt it, though. What a waste of home-made bread crumbs. There are better recipes out there. Heck, Shake N Bake might be better.

Fanatastic! I made the recipe with chicken breasts and pan fried before baking in the oven. I also added cumin to the wet mix. I'll definately make it again.
