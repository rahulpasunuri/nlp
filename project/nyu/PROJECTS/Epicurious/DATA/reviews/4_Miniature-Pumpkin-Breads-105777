Excellent recipe. One-half the recipe made 2 medium loaves. I used the pumpkin seeds and found that the texture was quite good in the bread. Definitely not an unsweet bread but not as sweet as some dessert breads. Only change I made was using dried ground ginger and amping it up a bit (about 1/2 -1 tsp ground for 1/2 recipe). I imagine it is wonderful with fresh ginger too.

I made this for the first time last night and love it. I combined some of the suggestions from other posters and used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups white, greek yogurt in place of the buttermilk, and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesuace in place of 1/2 cup of oil. I increased all the spices, using 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tbsp of grated fresh ginger. I also added 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I used 1 scant cup of white sugar and 1 scant cup of drak brown sugar. I did not use the pumpkin seeds. I baked this in two full size silicone loaf pans and it turned out beautifully moist and delicious. Next time I make it, I will try reducing the white sugar to 1/2 cup and maybe add some grated orange peel and chopped nuts.

This is an incredibly tasty recipe. I have made it on multiple occasions and it has always been a hit. I use it for gifts, not only for family, but for my law firm clients as well. I have been asked to share said recipe many times. I did make a few changes after the first baking though. I omit the pumpkin seeds and I use dark brown sugar instead of golden light. I also bump up the amount of ginger to 1 tablespoon and I grate the ginger instead - it gets incorporated into the batter better. I have also found that when I bake in Wilton mini loaf pans, I have WAY more batter than will fit in 6 pans. However, the recommended disposable tin pans are larger and the batter fits perfectly into 6 pans.

I never made this recipe as is, so do not feel comfortable rating it. Substitutions I made: 1c apple sauce replaced the oil (which kept it moist yet really cut the calories; 3/4c greek yogurt replaced the buttermilk (which added protein and a minute hint of tanginess); added 1/4t ground cloves; reduced brown sugar by 1/2c; used turbinado (raw) sugar instead of white. I think these substitutions yeilded very flavorful, slightly sweet, very moist muffins.

I have made this recipe 10 + times and it is a family favorite!! I never include the pumpkin seeds, and sometimes I vary it in a couple very yummy ways: -add mini chocolate chips -use batter in mini cupcake pan and put cream cheese frosting on top (great for parties)

I omitted the pepitas, subbed 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1.5 teaspoons ground ginger for the fresh. The recipe made two regular loaf pans and 6 large muffins. The flavor and texture is lovely, just sweet enough, moist and fluffy. I would amp up some of the spices next time and maybe try some cardamom and cloves... Raisins would also be nice.

The overall flavor was very good and with a few little changes it will be a recipe I will make again. The one BIG problem I had was the ground pepitas. They made for the most unpleasant texture! I had thought about leaving it out, but after reading the reviews I just went ahead with them. I'll skip that step next time!

A fantastic recipe. Don't understand comments about it not being sweet enough. Thought it was precut sweetness. Agree that cooking time can be shorter.

Fantastic recipe, even without ginger (which turns out I didn't have). Only note is that muffins cooked in about 20 minutes and loaves were done in 45 minutes.

Yummy! I made this exactly like the recipe said and it was excellent! My husband requested that I leave out the pumpkin seeds next time but I liked them. Added an earthy flavor to balance the sweetness. I don't like sweet things so this was perfect!

The best pumpkin bread ever. I used a real cheese pumpkin (roasted & pureed) and made regular bread sizes. Very moist, not too spicy.

I made this recipe into muffins for my daughter's autumn festival bake sale. I wound up with 24 regular-sized muffins plus 12 mini muffins. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour for the white flour. They were very moist with a nice spicy (but not too spicy) pumpkin flavor. My kids loved them. I was afraid this recipe had too much oil but I guess that's why they are so moist! (I left out the pepitas too).

Like nearly everyone esle, I omitted the pumpkin seeds. I made one-third of the recipe to yield a single 8x4- inch loaf. I agree with those whose said the bread is not sweet. For my taste, I would either add 25-50% more sugar and/or add chocolate chips - although I doubt I'll make it again as the bread is only ok and I rarely keep buttermilk in the house.

To make this a little healthier, I made a couple of substitutions: replaced 1.5 cups of the AP flour with whole wheat; replaced half of the vegetable oil with olive oil. For a little extra flavor, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves. My husband, who generally does not like pumpkin bread, really liked this recipe. Co-workers also enjoyed. Next time, I will sprinkle a little crystalized ginger on the tops, along with the pepitas.

This bread came out very moist and just sweet enough with a good flavor. I omitted the seeds and topped with walnuts. Next time I might sub out a cup of flour for whole wheat flour and add some ground flax seed for more texture and to make this recipe a little healthier for breakfast.

I just made this today. I halved the recipe, omitted the pumpkin seeds entirely, used regular skim milk, added a bit of vanilla, and alspice, and then added 1 cup of 60% cacao chips after the last incorporation of dry ingredients. Next time, I'm adding a cup and a half. The bread itself is not too sweet, but the chocolate really adds a sweetness that would have been too much if the batter had been sweet to begin with. Now, I just need some cream cheese to finish it off! This halved recipe made 4 mini loaves when filled 1/2 to 3/4 full before backing (about 1 cup of batter per pan). I used my convection toaster oven moving the pans around a couple of times, and it took right at 30 minutes to bake them.

Help! I want to make this recipe today but don't have the seeds. Did anyone substitute extra flour for the seeds or completely omit them? It seems it would be 2 1/2 cups of seeds in the batter and that's a lot to omit without substituting something. Thanks for any input!

I made these yesterday and they turned out wonderful! I didnt use the pumpkin seeds, but they still turned out great. I had never made pumpkin bread before but i will be using this recipe from now on! These would make great little gifts for the holidays as well :)

Made this bread with pecans and butterscotch chips. Make sure you put the chips on top of the batter, then lightly dunk them under the dough. I skipped the seeds but might try that next time. This is so delicious and it is replacing my old pumpkin bread recipe.

Very nice flavor. Skipped the pumpkin seeds and went with the chocolate chips. Made them into muffins. Took about 45 minutes to cook.

We've made this before as bread, and it's the best pumpkin bread, imo. So when yesterday our friend who loves pumpkin had his birthday, we made this for him as a cake (without the pumpkin seeds). It worked really well -- we greased two 9x13 pans and poured the batter in those, baking for 35-45 minutes. Whipped up a batch of cream cheese frosting and made a layer cake! It was excellent -- but made A LOT of cake!

Love this! My son is enamored with pumpkin bread and I was using a trader joe's box for convenience. They ran out around thanksgiving so I gave this a whirl. It makes a ton, I used 5 minature tins and a regular loaf pan. It is always gobbled up! We gave some as gifts for christmas this year too. Oh- I skip the pepita part too.

I skipped the pumpkin seeds, too, but added chocolate chips to the batter. Delicious!

My family loves this recipe. I make it with fresh pumpkin that I roast from pie pumpkins and then mash. We skip the pepitas or pumpkin seeds and have it plain and it's great with a bit of butter on the slice! Works great for breakfast and for snacks in my daughter's school backpack. Lisa

What a great recipe~ I had some cooked pumpkin left over from Thanksgiving and used that, but was out of brown sugar and only had 1/2 c. canola oil. A little less white sugar and some olive oil and melted butter filled in the blanks. I also used powdered instead of fresh ginger. Result was a really moist and yummy cakelike bread. I think it would be good with orange zest and an orange glaze as well.

I didn't use pumpkin seeds and used small muffin sized molds instead of loaf pans and took these to Thanksgiving dinner. The whole family loved them. Nice texture, not too sweet, and very pretty.

Made these as Christmas gifts. Couldn't find raw pumpkin seeds but was fine w/o it. Everyone gobbled it up. I one-and-halved the recipe and got 9 miniloaves, even without the seeds.

I made a half recipe of muffins instead. Kinda eyeballed the proportions and they came out great. I made 2 dozen but only because I ran out of muffin papers. If you like 'em big 2 dozen is the perfect number for a half recipe. I baked at 325 for about 17 minutes. At 20 minutes the bottoms started to burn but not bad enough to be inedible. I was really worried I would screw something up because I'm a terrible cook but this recipe is pretty idiot-proof.

I made these for Christmas gifts and kept one back for myself. I added softened parnoosh dates and doubled the spices and this bread was fantastic. Moist, flavorful and very nice looking with the pepitas on top.

This is the best pumpkin bread I've ever made, plus I think it's a bit healthier than most other pumpkin breads, too. I half the recipe and make it as muffins. I also substitute ground pecans for the pepitas and powdered ginger for fresh (easier and just as good, if not better -I always singe the pepitas!)

Very nice for quick gifts, ie teachers friends etc. Used 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 teaspoon cinn. Added 3/4 c dried cranberries and same amount of toasted walnuts. We got seven small loaves. Ate a couple, gave a couple away and froze a couple. Great recipe.

i didn't like the pumpkin bread because of it's lack of sweetness. i also like breads that have a more distinctive pumpkin flavor. personal choice i guess.

I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the plain flour, and applesauce for the oil. Really great pumpkin bread, not too sweet!

I did not do any of the pumpkin seed stuff, but added chopped walnuts to the batter. I got 7 very generous baby loaves, and they were fully done is about 45 minutes. I would expect a regular size loaf to be baked in 1 hour, so a miniature one would never require that amount of time. They look and taste great, but not hugely different from many other pumpkin breads.

It might seem cumbersome to make 6 mini loaves, but this yummy bread will disappear if you take it to a function or to work to share. I omitted the seeds and ended up with a great moist texture. After baking for an hour, I still had some wet spots and the remaining 5 loaves went back in for another 15 minutes. The bread really isn't sweet though, so I brushed on a simple glaze made with confectioner's sugar and let it soak in overnight.

I have already been invited back for thanksgiving next year, as long as I bring these!!! I tripled the recipe (for 20 people) It came out fine. I also omitted the ground pumpkin seeds and only used them for garnish.

I thought the flavor of the breads were very moist,tasty and deffiently a must to make.The only thing that i thought was to much were the seeds that was on the top was to much.i would delete the seeds next time.I thought the bread was very tasty with out the extra texture.

Outstanding recipe!! I tried 5 different pumpkin breads before I came to this one. I substituted crystalized ginger for the fresh ginger. I also added some ground cloves and ground ginger. It could more accurately be called pumpkin ginger bread, but EVERYONE who tried it, loved it. I ended up using it as a base for an excellent dessert. I cut the pumpkin bread into thick diamond shapes, bruleed the top, put carmelized apples on top and then some creme fraiche with sugar and vanilla added. The pumpkin bread is outstanding on its own, but it also leant itself well to this more formal dessert.

I have made a similar recipe before. What made the bread adaptable was that is was NOT so sweet, as one reviewer stated. I improvised with an addition of groud cayenne pepper (can't remember amount) but it gave the bread a top note and a slight punch.

We loved this, especially while it was still warm. I used half the oil and added a little more milk and it was great. I also just used the while 29 oz. can of pumpkin puree. Yum!

What a wonderful recipe that everyone raves about! A real keeper! I have made the recipe several times with a few minor changes. I increased the pumpkin to 1 29 oz. can, increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp.,increased the nutmeg to 1 tsp., added 2 tsp. vanilla and added 2 cups dried cranberries. The result is an even more tasty, moist bread.
