Wouldn't change a thing! The basil was a great flavor to add to the grilled corn.

Creamed corn? I don't think so. After reading the reviews, I added a couple tablespoons of milk and then some light sour cream and that gave this recipe a hint of creamed corn. The result was great.

I like a bit thicker consistency to creamed corn, so I used heavy cream in place of the milk - calories be damned, and boy was it good!!

This was an awesome recipe! Very easy to do, and the basil is a really great addition!! Way better (taste wise and health wise) than traditional creamed corn.

This is a great recipe. The carmamelized corn and the basil are perfect together. I make it time and again. And it's not really that hard, especially if you are already grilling. Just throw on a couple ears of corn and presto, you're done.

I did not even use grilled corn........just left over corn on the cob which had been boiled. Our family loved it. The basil added a great flavor and it was a great way to use left over corn. I will be making this again and again.

I did not think this was relaly creamed corn either. It had a pleasant taste with the basil and the carmelized corn kernals, but the "cream" was quite runny. It was a little bit of effort and I'm not sure it was worth it or not

I would hardly consider this recipe 'creamed.' The corn had a wonderful taste to begin with and I don't think the basil nor milk added much.
