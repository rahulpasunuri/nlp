Love this recipe. I use bnls rib- end chops. Like it both with and w/o the addition of garlic. I've been making extra and then portioning and freezing the chops (with marinade) in fzr bags (after marinading). Works great. Just take them out of the fzr in the morning, thaw in the fridge and they are basically ready to grill that evening.

The only problem with this was that there wasn't enough! My 18-month old ate a whole pork chop and my 4 year old had two. Next time I'll have to double up.

This is a meal that my husband and I actually both love! The Teriyaki sauce was amazing and the chops were really moist.

YUM! YUM! YUM! We loved the combination of flavors. Ginger really put these chops over the top.

Not a good marinade for me. Too much soy sauce I think. I wasn't impressed at all.

Great way to prepare pork chops. The first time we made them and they didn't dry out on the grill. I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, used ponzo instread of reg. soy sauce and added lemon zest. Marinate overnight and you can't go wrong!

A definite keeper! This is my kind of recipe -- a great dish with very little effort. I made a few modifications to suit our tastes, like adding garlic and increasing the sugar; also used regular soy sauce, not low sodium. My chops were a bit thicker than 1", which worked out great on the grill. A great entree for adults and kids alike; will make these the next time I have company.

This was a very tasty way to prepare pork chops. I had fairly thin ones, but marinaded them overnight as directed, and they cooked on the grill in no time. My spouse, who is not a fan of anything involving bones, knives or chewing, ate two, the first time I have seen him do so in more than 20 years of cooking for him. I served them with blanched snow peas stir fried in garlic-infused vegetable and sesame oil. Rounding out the plate were soba noodles from the "spicy buckwheat noodles with chicken" recipe on this site, except minus the chicken. Dessert was grapefruit ginger sherbet. Yum!

An excellent recipe.

Very good teriyaki sauce!! Be sure to marinade the pork chops overnight. I used a little more fresh ginger than was called for (about 3 Tablespoons). I read some of the earlier reviews about the marinade tasting too hoppy so I used a cheap beer (Budweiser) and it turned out great. My boyfriend who is rather particular about teriyaki sauce after living in Japan complimented this recipe. We will use this marinade again and may even try it with beef!

My husband and I both loved this marinade. I used the sherry, and oops, an entire can of beer. Thought it might turn out too "beery", but I did use light beer, and once reduced down, it didn't matter. I did thicken it with cornstarch as one of the reviewers and it made excellent glaze. Especially since I marinaded for a couple of hours, so I think the thicker glaze was the ticket. It is really a nice teriyaki flavor as sometimes teriyaki can be too sweet. Would definitely make again, and use marinade for other dishes.

Fantastic! Except for using a pork tenderloin rather than chops, made this exactly as written and it doesn't need any changes. Served it with Sauteed Spinach and Peanuts (on this site) and it was a great week night meal.

EXCELLENT marinade. I made it with pork tenderloin and it worked perfectly. I added cornstarch/cold water (@2 tbspn each mixed together) to the marinade during the boiling time at the end to thicken the sauce. We all loved the sauce and the pork was excellent.

I made this for dinner tonight for my husband and 19-year-old daughter. We all loved it! I didn't have fresh ginger root, so used ground ginger. Didn't have low-sodium soy sauce so it was just a tad too salty----definitely use the low-sodium kind! I just marinated it for 1 1/2 hours. After cooking, I sliced the meat thin and served over angel hair pasta, with extra marinade on the side. Also made the Sesame Asparagus on this site. Wonderful (and quick) summer meal!

I was a little worried based on the ratings, but this was quite a nice marinade. I did spice it up a bit with extra ginger and a basil chili paste I picked up in Chinatown, but it was a very good base to begin with. Also, I did this on the grill with a pork tenderloin instead of chops because it looked better at the market.

I searched the website looking for an Asian-style pork chop recipe. After seeing the low percentage of how many people would cook this again, I wasn't so sure about it. But I read the reviews and the ingredients sounded great, so I decided to give it a try. This marinade was wonderful and the pork chops were full of flavor. We also grilled some vegetables (broccoli, snow peas, carrots) in the teriyaki sauce - it was a great combination. Also, I did take the advice and added the garlic - great suggestion! I would definitely recommend this marinade and will make it again.

this was really easy to make and really tasty. i didn't have the time to marinade overnight (only gave it 1 1/2 hours) and it was still delicious. worked much better with a thicker cut pork chop with a little fat (i tried a leaner cut as well). I agree, add some minced garlic to the marinade, it adds a lot to the flavor!

As the last few reviewers have said, this is a very good recipe (depite the 60-something approval rating). I used boneless butterfly pork chops, marinated them overnight, and cooked them under the broiler. I didn't baste tham and they turned out very juicy and yummy. Served with homemade applesauce and mashed potatoes. (Well, ain't that America!) The only deviation I made to the beer-teriyaki marinade was adding one minced clove of garlic. The combination of flavors was delish. Will make again.

This is a very good teriyaki marinade and unlike some of the other reviews I did not taste the beer in the recipe. I did however add a couple of cloves of garlic to the recipe. I always use garlic in my teriyaki to me it adds flavor. I also did not use the marinade to baste. The flavor was strong enough without it.

I actually really liked this. We used Gordon Biersch Pilsner as the beer. Low Sodium Soy Sauce. It was very good. Picky 5 year old had 2 helpings. It goes in the keeper box.

This was a good recipe. We enjoyed it and would definatly make it again. I had to use dry sherry and that didn't seem to be a problem. The sauce turned out great despite.

I used Sam Adams Pale Ale and this marinade was awesome. The beer added a touch that really enhanced the teriyaki marinade. I do think the choice in beer makes a difference and pale ales aren't too hoppy or malty. This is going into the rotation!

This is a good and easy recipe. Works best with thick (1.5+ in) boneless pork chops and on the grill.

This was a big disappointment. It tasted very yeasty and strange. Besides, like the other reviewer said, without the bizarre and unpleasant flavor from the beer, it just would have been another teriyaki sauce. Don't bother with this one.

Kind of disappointing. While it makes a perfectly nice teryaki pork chop, it just wasn't significantly different or interesting. I don't think I'll bother with it again, just because it didn't seem worth the extra effort.
