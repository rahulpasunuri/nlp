After cleaning and rinsing the shrimp, I patted them dry, tossed them in a plastic bag with some olive oil and pepper and marinated for 30 minutes. Everyone loved this, and the presentation on the rock salt was a nice touch.

Haven't made it yet - can't find rock salt. Can kosher salt substitute?

Made this for a New Years appetizer and it was gobbled up. The shrimp were so tender and the presentation was fun.

Loved the salt roasted shrimp. Perfect texture. However, thought the entire dish was too salty, especially when you consider the shrimp is roasted on salt. Would recommend using unsalted butter, then add salt to dip as necessary.

I made this exactly as written (except for burning the first batch of sauce and having to start over!) and it was very easy and wonderful. Everyone loved it. I used the "easy peel" shrimp, which has the shell on, but has been deveined.

Excellent, the shrimp was cooked perfectly. I have never roasted shrimp before. The texture was amazing. I did cut down the back and removed the vein prior to cooking but left the shell intact. Perfect way to cook a lot of shrimp. I plan on using this as an appetizer with each person having their individual plate of shrimp ontop of a salt bed with thier own dipping sauce bowl.

A delicious entree for serving to groups. Unlike traditional Scampi recipes, the sauce doesn't get too thin when making large quantities. Next time I'll try a little less lemon, but this is strictly a personal preference. A perfect dish for seafood loving guests.

If there were 5 forks, I'd give this 5! My girlfriend Liz made this for us & IT IS TO DIE FOR! You simply must make it!

It was a beautiful presentation on the bed of salt! The dip was very tasty and I thought it was a very quick and simple recipe with elegant results. We made it for our cooking group and nobody felt they were too salty. Perfect!

Great presentation and the scampi dipping sauce was wonderful. I made them in a paeia pan and just served them in it.

This is a perfect way to cook a large quantity of shrimp (more than a pound) as you don't need to turn them for all-around doneness. Roasting keeps the shrimp moist and tender, and we didn't taste any saltiness at all. Delicious!

The dip and the shrimp were yummy, but the cooked shrimp were dreadfully hard to peel. Did I do something wrong? Perhaps it was the shrimp I used? Any suggestions, anyone?

My husband and I cooked this for an at-home date night, and were both convinced that we would not have had a better meal at a 5 star restaurant! We used large wild shrimp (and peel AFTER cooking).

To the cook from Lombard - if you are using shell on shrimp, the salt crusts to the shell, just seasoning the shrimp. Perhaps you used peeled shrimp? Anyway, a classic, exceptional way to cook shrimp, or fish for that matter. Loved everything about it.

Too much salt. Overwhelming. you would really have to like salt, and i do but cooking the shrimp, the salt crusts on it... the sauce was a nice simple garlic lemon dipping sauce though. I think just mildly salting the shrimp and grilling them would be good. Or maybe add some tarragon to the sauce?
