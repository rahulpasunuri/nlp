It's very quick and easy to make. Tastes good but I'm not a slaw-lover so that's why I'm not terribly excitied. However, it's very good for these last minute nibbles, for buffet or even serve as part of an impromptu dinner party.

Had Miracle Whip in the house, so used it instead of mayo. Don't do it! Came out cloyingly sweet and heavy. May be a great recipe, but impossible to tell the way I made it.

I'm not a slaw fan, but I was in need of a no-cook, quick, ingredients-on-hand recipe to take to a barbeque. This hit the spot. My husband and our hosts both loved it (and I was asked for the recipe--a sure sign that they really did like it). Even I enjoyed it.
