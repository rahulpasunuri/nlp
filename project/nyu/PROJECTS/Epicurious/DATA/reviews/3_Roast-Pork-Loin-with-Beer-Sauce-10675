Eh. This was good, not great. The meat was tender and juicy but the sauce needed a bit of help. I added garlic per others suggestion but in the end it needed something more. I ended up adding a bit of white balsamic which helped. Husband liked it better than I but he agreed it isn't on the " can't wait to have it again" list.

The pork stayed moist and tasted delicious. Unfortunately the sauces and fat in the roasting pan burned too thoroughly to be incorporated into the deglaze. I compensated by leaving out that step and boiling and straining the reserve marinade. Guests commented on how much they could taste the beer in the sauce (which was OK because I like beer).

I used a much smaller pork tenderloin and thought the flavor of the meat was very good but the gravy had a strange sourness as did the outside of the meat. I believe this is from using MGD instead of a higher quality german beer. I will definitely make this again but with better beer and if I use the smaller tenderloin again I will not marinade 24 hrs. I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the marinade and thought it added another flavor element.

Fantastic. This was the feature dish of Christmas Day dinner, and everyone loved it. I followed the directions exactly, using Spaten beer in the marinade. That particular German brew gave the sauce really nice flavor, and we drank the rest with dinner. This is now in my basket of special recipes for special occasions.

This is delicious. I love the beer sauce. I made mine with 2 cans of light lager, and that seemed to give it a nice flavor. I followed the advice of a previous cook and skipped the browning part, roasted it first at 450 for 15 minutes, and then at 375 until done. Also, I didn't do the butter at the end, the sauce didn't seem lacking because of that.

This looked like an interesting recipe to try for our non-traditional Thanksgiving dinner. I was so disappointed. The meat tasted ok but the sauce (marinade) had an odd smell to it. It was not at all to my liking. My husband ate it but after the first try, I decided to forgo any more of the sauce. There are far better recipes than this.

I was able to marinate for a full 24 hours. That is a must. I used Heine for Beer. I tossed in three cloves of garlic (must be the Italian) And inbetween the netting on the tenderloin, I must have poked it 60 times with my meat thermometer prior to marinating. All sides everywhere had places for the marinade to go. It was excellant.

I made this dish after searching the site for a main course for our dinner club - the theme was German Night, and the result was a definite hit. It's easy to make and the sauce/gravy was excellent. I used two bottles of Heineken Beer for the marinade, and marinated the pork for the upper end of the time recommended. I did brown the loin first and used the beurre manie to thicken the sauce. One of our guests brought a sour red cabbage dish to the pot luck, and it went very well with the pork loin. I've added this dish to my recipe box and I will assuredly make it again. It's a winner!

I really liked this recipe. It was easy since I skipped having to strain the sauce by not blending it in the first place...it was a hit.

I've made this dish several times and each time it is fantastic! I use brown ale (Newcastle) which gives a nice rich flavor. I don't really worry too much about scraping the pan a whole lot...that may be why some say it has a funny flavor.

What a disappointment and a waste of a 3.5 pound loin from the butcher shop. In order to save as much as possible, I put the rest of the pork loin to simmering in the crockpot with some Mississippi Hot and Spicy Barbecue sauce. The roast came out rather underdone, even though my thermometer registered 155 degrees when inserted halfway into the roast. I let it rest the fifteen minutes, too, which should have brought the temp up by at least 5 degrees. The sauce was oddly flavored, I used Grolsch beer--seemed too fruity and onion-y. Just an odd mix, I think. I'll stick to my favorite braised pork loin with sage and apple topping recipe.

This is a super easy & delicious recipe! I never received so many complements on a pork dish! I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup cider vinegar to the marinade..FANTASTIC!

I rate this recipe according to my boyfriend's taste. He flipped over the taste of the sauce. I being pregnant thought it smelled pretty bad. I made it for a pork tenderloin and cooked it 25 min at 375.

Holy Cow! Or pig rather, this recipe was fabulous! It was not as difficult as the recipe reads, so please try it. This will become one of my 'fall-back' recipes for big crowds as you can easily scale it up with more pork loins and sauce ingredients (well, maybe with a little less beer due to chef consumption!). Get a bottle of big red wine for this one. Delicious!

Grest recipe. I did a spice rub before marinating which did add flavor. I also grilled the pork for no more than 30 minutes tuning often. Made it for a dinner party and had one say it was beeter than a pork loin he recently had at a five star resturant. Serve it with Orzo Risotto.

This was wonderful. I didn't feel like taking the extra step of browning the meat so I started it in the oven at 450 degrees for 15 minutes, then lowered the heat to 350. The meat was fork tender, and very flavorful.

I used the slow cooker for this and the meat turned out so tender, my guests loved it.

The pork turned out tender & tasty, but I didn't like the sauce (I didn't even serve it). There's definitely better roast pork recipes on this site.

Family, guests, neighbors--all have loved this recipe. I use a heavy roasting pan placed in the middle of the oven to prevent the marinade from browning too much, and I baste often. I worried the first time I made it that the sauce was getting too brown, but found this only added to the flavor. The sauce is incredible, and this recipe has become one of my favorites. The whole Oktoberfest menu in this issue is wonderful.

The outcome on this was crowd pleasing. The sauce was delicious as well as the well flavored pork. The marinade was perfect. All are still talking about this meal.

I tried in my crock pot with 1 1/2 mgd's (lites)on low for 8 hours. Layer meat on top.Could'nt have been more moist and tender than if I'd stayed home and fussed with it all day. Perfect for SNAGS* like me. * Sensative New Age Guys ps Have some good red wine and sour dough bread ready and have at it.

was lacking something. Maybe it could use some spices. Might try again my version.

I'm not really a meat eater but, was fixing Christmas dinner & had to have a main coarse and this looked easy. I seared off the pork & roasted it, it was just so easy and the best part is, everyone liked it. I served the left overs with sauteed mushrooms and it was even better. Thanks, BAE.

Pork was tasty and moist. As for the sauce lots of bother for so so results. The sauce was unappealing in appearance and just okay taste. I have tried many more tasty and appealing recipes for pork loin than this one.

It was tasty, but I made a real mess of my kitchen! I ended up preparing some bbq pork with my leftovers and I think that was even better.

I actually cooked this dish on the barbecue-- seared it for about 2 minutes all over, then put the top down and let it cook for a about 50 minutes. I used a 9 pound slab of meat, cut in half, and doubled the recipe. Instead of the zip lock bag I just let the meat soak in a lobster pot. I also used non-alcoholic beer instead of the real stuff, cause we have some non-drinkers in the family. Doesthat make sense?

I've made this countless times, always to RAVES. Never a problem (although an earlier reviewer is correct about blending the marinade after it cools -- I burned myself rather badly!). I had one guest who went back for thirds AFTER dessert! The meat is so tender, and the sauce is great sopped up with a crusty bread.

The meat itself was pretty good but the sauce/gravy was not well received. The pork did turn out very tender and moist but I had a problem with the marinade burning during the roasting. I solved it by adding some water to the pan. We liked the meat but the sauce/gravy went down the sink.

I don't think I can rate this recipe with any fairness. A family emergency resulted in the meat being marinated for 48 hours, not 24! When I opened the ziplock bag, it smelled yeasty and sort of fermented. I don't know ... maybe that's how it would have smelled after just 24 hours. Well, we were game to try it anyway. The meat was tender and had a nice flavor. I simmered the sauce for awhile to kill the "yeastiness" and it tasted kind of sweet and a little weird. My boyfriend loved it, though! Anything with beer ...

I doubled the recipe and had no troubles. My guests didn't leave a piece of roast or a drop of sauce.

This is an easy and delicious recipe, but wait for the marinade to cool a bit before you puree to avoid getting hurt.
