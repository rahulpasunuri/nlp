Recipe is for one layer. I make this every year for my daughter's birthday but triple everything. We dye the frosting pink and cut 5 minutes from baking time. Very tasty!

This was as the other reviews indicated, a pancake cake. The taste was pretty good but this recipe should be removed from this Site!This is a site to go to for GOOD recipes..this one is NOT.

I found this recipe to be easy and quite yummy when finished. I figured that the recipe for the cake layers was referring to one layer at a time so this came out beautifully for me.

recipe is either for a 5 inch cake or is half recipe, I doubled it up, and even then, I ended up with thin cakes. I have yet to make the icing... let's hope it tastes good. Quite disappointing. Please ensure, whoever posted this, that the recipe is exact... and maybe that the actual photo is shown. Quite misleading.

it seems to be a half recipe, which I had to make twice, as I did not read the previous review... I am crossing my fingers it comes out ok, it's for my mom's birthday... Aye aye, obviously not from Gourmet mag... should have noticed.

What the &*&(???? I couldn't even give this one fork. It made 1 (not two) pancake-like 9 in cake if you even can call it that. I double and triple checked that I got the recipe correct. Something must be missing in the recipe. It was hard as a rock and about 1 inch thick. Luckily I had a back-up box cake to add to the layer. Definately won't make this again.
