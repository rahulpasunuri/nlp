An easier, fresher-tasting version of this : Puree four large tomatillos (raw) with one clove garlic and one jalapeno, until smooth. Add one large avocado and a 1/4 tsp salt and puree until thick and smooth.

I agree with others here -- this recipe needs more spice. I will definitely make it again but just spice it up a little bit.

Okay, but it's not worthy of the work.

This dip is okay, but it tasted like an ordinary guacamole--and one that wasn't very spicy at that! I wanted the tomatillos to give it a much more distinct flavor, but they didn't. I will continue to look for a good dip made with tomatillos. In the meantime, if I want plain guacomole, I will make a standard recipe, any of which are better than this.

Loved it! Took this to a party and was asked for the recipe by several people. I followed the amounts, but next time I think I'll spice it up a bit...I just happen to like things with alittle fire! It's definitely a KEEPER!

I was never a guacamole fan until I made this! I roasted a jalapeno pepper with the tomatillos and garlic.
