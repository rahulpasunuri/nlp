This makes a wonderful light dessert with a couple of caveats: 1 medium mango is not enough for 4 people, and 1 teaspoon matcha powder is too mildly flavored relative to the chocolate. I suggest at least 2 tablespoons of matcha. You can also cut the sugar out of macerating the fruit and use less sugar to mix with matcha, since the mango and white chocolate are already quite sweet. Otherwise, it is surprising and delicious.
