Excellent. As rjlink suggested, everything should be salted: the beans (not until half-way through cooking), the water for the green beans, the water for the barley, and the dressing. I too sauteed the onions briefly. And I threw in some halved cherry tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious, and I'll make this all summer long. Half a recipe easily feeds 4-6.

Very simple and delicious, IF you salt it properly. As others have noted, the recipe as written makes a lot, probably enough to feed more like 10 to 12 rather than 6 to 8. You could probably do this with kidney or pinto beans in place of the black beans. I'm going to cook the red onion in a little olive oil before adding it to the salad next time, because I find raw onion really nasty.

This is delicious! I ate it warm, as soon as I finished cooking, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not have Dijon mustard, so I used mustard powder instead and used the other reviewer's suggestion and added marjoram & tarragon. I will definitely make this again- as a chilled summer salad, and as a warm winter vegetarian dish.

This recipe definitely serves about 20 (not 6-8). It was rather bland. I added some rice vinegar, but it didn't help much. A friend suggested chopped cilantro, I will try that next time.

This salad is FANTASTIC! It is great served chilled, but room temp isn't that bad. It would make a great summer BBQ dish. Honestly, I couldn't get enough of this one! Fortunately the recipe makes a lot! The mix of Dijon and lemon is GREAT with the beans! A definite must! Enjoy!

There's only 2 of us, so I cut the recipe dramatically. After reading the previous review, I changed just about all the dressing ingredients and made it more 'French' using Dijon mustard, tarragon, a splash of white wine vinegar. It came out pretty good!

This bland side salad was rather disappointing. It also took a long time to prepare. It makes a huge quantity.
