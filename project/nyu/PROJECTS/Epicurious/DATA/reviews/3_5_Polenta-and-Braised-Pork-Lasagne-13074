I have made variations on this dish for catering as well as for home. I suggest grilling the polenta before service. Also, adding some Parmesan to the polenta right before pouring it on a sheet is a good idea. You need far more Béchamel than the recipe states. I'd go to James Beard of Julia for that one. Use some sherry also. I finish with smoked Gouda. It does not melt as well, but it does provide a nice flavor. This recipe is a good base. You can tart it up however you want. It freezes well. I agree with SF, use country ribs. They are far easier. However, this is a good recipe to use an inexpensive cut of pork. Works well with chicken and beef also, if you were curious.

We found this recipe a little disappointing. The braised pork and the bechamel sauce are wonderful together however, when combined with the polenta layers, seem to get lost. We spent the remainder of the meal discussing what other ways we could combine the pork and bechamel sauce. Since we doubled the pork and the sauce recipes (based on prior reviews) we used the leftovers to stuff pasilla chiles. Excellent!

I loved this dish. Usually I have to tamper with the recipes in here but this one was fine as written! It was so simple to make, too. Only changes I made were to add two egg yolks, a large pinch of cayenne pepper and some nutmeg to the bechamel and actually almost doubled the amount. I also doubled the amount of cheese and put some in the middle layer. I also used boneless pork ribs--a lot easier. I will make this again soon.

My husband and I thought this dish was great. I made the polenta after the pork began to simmer. Then I transferred it to a baking dish to cool and form. Made the bechamel next. After an hour and a half of simmering I put it all together and popped it in the oven. I used boneless pork ribs-eliminates a step and shreds easily with a fork. This dish took a long time to make, but I am fairly certain that the pork mixture could me made up in large batches ahead of time and frozen. Also to save time, one can buy tubes of premixed polenta-much quicker, but costly and not better than from scratch. At any rate, I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe and made the polenta from scratch. Long time stirring! The recipe was very good and I questioned whether I would have enough polenta to cover the pork. It was close, but sufficient. The tast of the pork was great and removing all of the fat is a key to making country ribs tasty and edible. This recipe does it very well.
