Wonderful dinner! It took longer to cook than 10 minutes but the onions got nice and crispy. In addition to the relish and rice, I served it with plain steamed spinach.

The second time I cooked this with vanilla yogurt and marinated the lamb in yogurt mixture for an hour before cooking. The sweetness of the vanilla yogurt worked well and was as good as the original recipe. Onions cooked very unevenly, but I'll blame my oven.

This was a great meal! As recommended, we made up basmati and a relish with cucumber and red bell pepper with a splash of vinegar and it was excellent. Very quick and easy.

As an Englishman living in Albuquerque, I've found the Indian food scene here depressing. When my partner moved from Boston, I wanted to make her something special to welcome her. This dish was perfectly simple and good. I made Biryani rice to go with, and it was excellent!

Someone else could make this 4 forks - my lamb was of inferior quality and leftover leg of lamb. I increased all the marinating ingredients and added garlic. It really was delicious despite my cautions - we had it served on curried rice. The crispy onions were delicious. You could do the lamb separately on the grill and make it even better, I think.
