Because I pair this dessert with a lot of cheese-heavy entrees, I have been utilizing shortcakes and vanilla ice cream instead of artisanal cheeses. Vanilla Bean ice cream really gives this dish an apple pie a la mode feel. I love this dessert and how simple it is to prepare!

Holy crap this is good. We had D'Anjou pears, so we went with goat cheese. Also, no pine nuts on hand so we used walnuts instead. My boyfriend is not a big dessert guy, but the savory salty-sweet aspect of this dish won him over. I just went ahead and served this alongside dinner. Much easier that way, and I am not afraid to have dessert first.

Absolutely amazing. Served this for a group and got rave reviews. A tangy chevre is the perfect combination with the sweet, caramelized pears. I ended up toasting walnuts instead of using the pine nuts because I didn't have them. They were excellent! Also, its super easy. One of those things that you can whip up without getting the kitchen all steamy.

I thought this was just ok and would probably not make it again. The only exception would be to give it one more shot to see if perhaps I did something wrong and could improve my preparation. I made it with humboldt fog, my favorite cheese, and there was something strange about how the saltiness of the cheese went with the pears. Also, the carmel hardened within a few minutes into something so hard that you couldn't really eat it with the pears using a fork.

This was the most surprisingly tasty and easy dessert. I will absolutely make this again and again. I used maple syrup instead of honey and did not use any nuts. An absolute treat!

I have made this dish twice. Once with good, not great, pears and once with awful pears. The first time with brie as a recommendation by the cheese monger. Would have been so much better with a stronger cheese. I think even a cambozola would be really good. Anyway, it didn't seem like it took 20 minutes. I was able to pop in and out while it cooked and then presented the whole thing on a platter which everyone ate from. I do suggest letting the caramel cool off a little before pouring over the cheese. Mine melted into a pile of salty, sweet, crunch, luscious good. Not bad, but not what I had in mind. Guests loved it.

I have made this recipe for a couple of multi-course wine dinners. It has met with rave reviews. I didn't change anything but I don't measure religiously. Always nice to be able to make a dessert that doesn't require strict measurements. I used Humbolt Fog Cheese and paired the dessert with an ice wine. Easy do-ahead and hold dessert. Seconds to finish and plate. PS.. NOT TOO SWEET! A great dessert bonus

I found the recipe a bit dull. There is too much butter and not enough taste. Caramel can be made differently. Goat cheese did not go well with it at all. It must be blue cheese. Hard to make for dinner party b/c you need to disappear from the table for 20 minutes while you prepare it. So hard to make ahead (other than peeling the pears). The combination of ingredients is exciting, but somehow, it didn't work for me. This is not a keeper.
