If you hate almonds why would you make this dessert. That's not a review it's a negative comment and I don't believe it belongs in reviews. I'm going to make this week and have no doubt it will be great. Why wouldn't it be!

Made this for my family Christmas dinner. It was a LOT of work & I wondered why I didn't use vanilla extract instead of paying over $4. for the vanilla bean. I didn't have time to make the ice cream so cheated and went to an Italian ice cream store which only makes sorbet and gelato. The owner said she often makes Baked Alaska & convinced me I needed gelato, not sorbet. I bought Cookies and Cream for the grandchildren, Chocolate Fudge for the adults. (If you change flavors, put a toothpick in the meringue for i.d.). It was a lot of work and expensive. Would I make it again? You bet!!! Everyone raved about it, excellent presentation, fabulous flavor. Whew!!! until next year......

This is a perfect dinner party dessert. All the prep is done beforehand, and you just whip it out of the freezer and into the oven just before serving. A definite "wow" dessert that really impressed my guests. I would certainly make it again

Followed directions all turned out great! Cook egg whites on waxed paper or parchment, NOT foil.
