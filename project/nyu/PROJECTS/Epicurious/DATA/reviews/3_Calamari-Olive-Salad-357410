A simple basic recipe with lots of room for variation of ingredients to suit your personal tastes. Most importantly cook calamari according to instruction (don't overcook) and, for best results, use a good quality extra virgin olive oil.

I really loved this recipe; it tasted amazing!! I first want to mention that the salad looked much better in reality than in the provided picture. The salad was very tasty, beautiful, and light. The only changes I would suggest is 1/2 cup of finely chopped olives instead of a heaping 1/3 cup, and making the 1/3 cup of celery a heaping 1/3. The lemon really added a nice flavor to this. I would be very proud to serve this due to flavor and aesthetics.

Unpalatable. Bland. Not going to impress company.
