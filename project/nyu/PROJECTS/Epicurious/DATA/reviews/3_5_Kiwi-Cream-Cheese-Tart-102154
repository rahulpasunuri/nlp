I'm trying this for the first time and think it will turn out well - was wondering if everyone actually rolled the dough onto surface before putting in springform - seems it could be a wasted step? Guess I'll find out!

I made this using a graham cracker crust from No Bake Blueberry Cheescake recipe on the site. It was wonderful. I cut the pie into wedges and froze them so that I wouldn't be tempted to eat the whole thing in one sitting!

I made this without alteration. The crust was delicious - great texture and flavor due to the macadamia nuts. It looked beautiful too. I found the filling to taste a bit too much of cream cheese, but still quite good. My husband who does not like cheesecake was not too fond of this either. Next time I will try marscarpone like another reviewer suggested.

I have made this for 3 dinner parties and it is always a hit~! I substituted sugar with splenda (16 pkts.) and nobody knew the difference until I told. I found it keeps a couple of days in the 'fridge.

This is a fantastic Summer dessert! I also added strawberries on top, very colorful. Macademia nuts are expensive here so I used ground hazelnuts, which were great. By the way, I used low-fat cream cheese and it tasted just wonderful. I recommend reducing the sugar for the filling a little.

Very light yet scrumptious dessert. Has a key lime pie taste. The crust is wonderful! Will do again, especially with summer coming, and the dinner parties!

I've made this recipe several times. The 2nd time I used lemon & lime juice and grapefruit zest, and the result was wonderful. The third time I switched to marscapone and that was fabulous too. The last time I made it for a picnic. I baked the crust on a cookie sheet in little bars, cooled & wrapped them, made the filling as usual but folded in the fruit (chopped, put in a tupperware bowl, and took it in a cooler. We dipped & double dipped! It turned out great and was a big hit.

Sensational! The finished product makes any baker look like a star! Tart, sweet, crunchy, creamy--it's all there in one luscious tart. Easy recipe: sit back and bask in the compliments.

I made this for a tropical party I had. It was a nice, summery, light dessert. However, I would recommend cutting down on the sugar; I found it to be too sweet. The next time I make it, I'll probably reduce the sugar by half.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe! The crust was cookie-like and the filling is rich and creamy! I've made it several times in the last couple of months and have gotten many requests for the recipe!C

This is a easy and delicious dessert. One that I would not hesitate to serve to guests. As a necessity, I did alter the recipe using bottled key lime juice...didn't have a single lime in the house. Very bad move! While it was nice, I felt the lime zing just wasn't there. I can't wait to try it with fresh limes.

This recipe is fantastic! The crust was a beautiful diversion from the usual graham. I threw out all of my key lime pie recipes and replaced them with this one!! Perfect end to a meal.

I didn't have a dish with a removable bottom so I used a regular ceramic one. Bad idea. It stuck and I realized I should have at least buttered the dish. One of the best things about this tart is it's beautiful presentation. I'm not usually good at making food look pretty but somehow the unique-looking kiwi slices make it easy to fake the look of something very difficult. I tastes great to, although quite rich.
