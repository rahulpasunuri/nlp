I made this for a dinner party along with the roast beef with dijon-caper sauce. It was a hit and was easy to prep ahead of time. Did have a little bit of a problem getting it out of the pan without falling apart but would make it again.

Overall pretty good, I loved the turnips and potatoes however the Celery root i wouldn't add unless you are a fan of it. Didn't have a skillet that could go into the oven so I kinda cheated out and tried to just bake it which didn't work out too well, but I'll know better for next time.

the combination of these vegetables isn't nearly as good as just doing a potato gratin or a turnip gratin by itself. Barefoot Contessa has an excellent turnip gratin recipe that far surpasses this. Plus I don't think I like celery root that much, so maybe it's just me.

Why use butter? Olive oil is much healthier, and that is what I used. It improves the dish, I think. It is not an overwhelmingly taste-laden dish, but a good solid veggie side. Experiment with other herbs. I added parley and garlic.

Leaving out the turnip would definately make this dish taste a little dull...I thought that they really gave it a nice 'zing'.....it was beautiful. I eased up on the butter a bit, and would use even less the next time I make it so that it's not quite so greasy/rich. My husband devoured this dish and it was a great alternative to scalloped potatoes.

I thought this was a little boring. I did leave out the turnip as I am not a fan of that vegetable. I added more potato instead. It looked lovely when finished.
