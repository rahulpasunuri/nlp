while it is nice to have the softened gorgonzola, the flavor of the figs, and the way they complement the prosciutto, is far superior unbroiled--I think next time I will try without broiling.

I have used dates instead of figs. Stuffing cheese into half a date was easy. Pecans work well too. To make it a little more elegant I made a red wine reduction syrup and glazed the little gems once they came out of the oven. SUBLIME! This is now on my regular rotation for pot lucks and in house dinners.

Simple, yet decadent. The layers of flavors -- the sweetness of the fig, the saltiness of the prosciutto,the creaminess of the gorgonzola and the crunch of the walnut -- were the perfect combination. This was absolutely delish! I would definitely make this again.

can't go wrong with these flavors. but there's actually two great recipes hiding here. prosciutto-wrapped figs are amazing in their own right. OR, if you're not a big fan of fig texture - layering gorgonzola (or any blue cheese) then topping with toasted walnuts or pecans on high quality dried apricots is an excellent and super easy app.

Made these as part of an antipasti. I loved that they could be put together ahead of time and heated at the last minute. They were a big hit!

I just wasn't that impressed with this recipe. I followed it to the nose, but the fresh figs I used were mushy after baking... The flavors all melded nicely together, but I just couldn't get over the strange texture of the figs. I might try this again with dried fruit.

This was an easy, impressive starter. My husband ate most of them, but the ones I tried at room temperature, with the Gorgonzola having slightly melted, were fantastic! Will definitely make these again.

I made this as an appetizer for a party. The flavors were bold, although you really should use fresh figs. It was a hit, and very easy.

Love this combination - we sometimes prepare as directed, sometimes wrap all the ingredients inside the prosciutto & warm briefly. Can also make bite-sized by using fig jam instead of fresh figs. Great with Champagne!

I did some catering for a friend who had won a wine tasting package at an auction. I made these along with other canapes. I was a bit apprehensive about these so I didnt make as many as the others. Guests were waiting with me at the oven to gobble them up as soon as possible!

I loved the salty sweet contrast. Somehow i forgot the walnuts and only broiled the prociutto wrapped figs on one side and still thought it was great!

We loved the mix of flavors. I used fresh figs and my guests are picky eaters!

I wasn't able to find figs, so I used dried dates. The appetizer what a hit at my dinner party. The three distinct flavors were perfect. And it was delicious hot and cold.

I agree with the last reviewer and one other early review... I wasn't so thrilled with these. There are too many competitive strong flavors and odd textures. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't knock-your-socks-off super either.

i was so excited about this recipe - the different flavors together sounded great! fortunately i tried the recipe out before serving it to my guests! unfortunately, i disagree with everyone else here. i hated it! maybe it was the figs - dried mission. maybe it was the stilton - though i love stilton! whatever, i won't be making this again. everyone else, enjoy! that's what makes the world go 'round!

We LOVE these. I don't cook them, just leave them the way they are. Also, I cut the figs into quarters or sixths, depending on how big they are. They make smaller bites and therefore are easy to pop in your mouth. A real treat!

Loved the combination of flavors and what a nice change to serve figs. Easy to prepare. My guests asked for extras, always a good sign

Sophisticated and delicious. Everyone loved these even though I think they could have been better had I been more selective about the cheese-I just grabbed a domestic gorgonzola. I like the suggestion to use Stilton-maybe next time.

Absolutely fabulous ~ such a simple combination but the flavor can't be beat. A staple in my recipe book!

Love these. I've made several times & have substituted Stilton for the Gorgonzola & pecans for the walnuts. Yum!

This is a wonderful starter for any occasion. I used the fresh figs and they were excellent. I ran out of gorgonzola so I used cream cheese instead and it was divine!

This was delicious. I have never bought figs or cooked with them. The assembly is easy and they were gone fast!

We had this as an appetizer at a party. They were quite tasty. Although, you must watch them during cooking as the broiler will burn them if you aren't careful. Note: They do not taste good the next day so eat up.

Not as breathtaking as the other reviews said. The texture was a little off; perhaps the figs I used were too ripe? My dining companions found the combination of flavors a bit too overwhelming - the fig and prosciutto and cheese and walnuts competed with each other.

Excellent! Made these as a wonderful appetizer with a crisp bubbly. The next day, I used the leftover ingredients on a thin pizza crust brushed with balsamic dressing - yummy!

This was incredible, and similar to a dish at our favorite restaurant, Frascati, in San Francisco. The restaurant includes a warm balsalmic reduction drizzled over the top of the figs as well: melt sugar, add butter, chicken stock and balsalmic vinegar; reduce. Delicious!

Great taste, easy, and impressive. I forgot to toast the walnuts, so after adding the gorgonzola and walnut, I broiled again for about 45 seconds. This worked well to melt the cheese and toast the walnut.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. This is an old but classic way of preparing figs and now that they are easy so easy to find they make a wonderful addition to a late summer barbecue on the patio. The combination of the sweetness from the figs, salty prosciutto, and tangy gorgonzola is so tasty and very sophisticated!
