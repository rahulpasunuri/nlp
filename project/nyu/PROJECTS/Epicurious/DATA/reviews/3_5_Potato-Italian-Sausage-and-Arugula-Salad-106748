My husband and my two 12 year olds enjoys this recipe. All the different flavors just comes together. Recommend grilling the red onion and the sausage. Sometimes I have used chicken sausage that I picked up from Trader Joe's. I also use red potatoes, bottled Red Wine Vinaigrette, and a bag of baby spinach. This is a nice & easy entree that I also serve to guests.

highly recommended! mild sausage works well, and a bag of precooked potato cubes makes the recipe exceptionally easy. i was pleasantly surprised by the flavors created from so few and so simple of ingredients.

A hot summer night hit! Holding a glass of chilled wine and chatting with friends, I grilled the sausages and the red pepper while the potatoes simmered. It took only a few minutes to chop everything and toss with the arugula. Everyone loved it!

Absolutely fantastic dish! Very easy to make and very tasty. I used green onions instead of red called for in recipe (I did not soak the green onions), and salad still turned out wonderful.

This is a tasty, satisfying, super easy to make dish. I've made for a sunday lunch for several people or a quick dinner for my husband and me. A much more elaborate version of this recipe appeared in another magazine, which I tried before this one was published. This is vastly superior and twice as easy.

We loved this! I made several changes including carmelizing the onion when cooking the sausage.I also used raw red peppers instead of a jar of roasted. Finally I added an artichoke sauce I had, made of chopped artichoke hearts,garlic,red pepper flakes mustard & olive oil.

Interesting blend of flavors, but not something I'd bother to make again. At least not without enough changes to make it unrecognizable.

Full of flavor that is well balanced. The dressing was wonderful -- neither too oily or vinegary. Will definitely make this one again.

This dish was fantastic!! I made it for a family gathering on the 4th of July, and it won rave reviews. I've even had to give the recipe to several of the women that were there. It doesn't take that long to make, and is well worth it.

Everybody raved about this one. I did not particularly care for the sweet sausage. May use mild next time, but still I did like the way it turned out.

Great hit at our Memorial Day picnic! Had many requests for the recipe. I grilled the sausage which added a bit of a smokey flavor.

I served this at a family party, and people went wild! One thing I learned-if you are preping things in advance, do all but adding dressing in advance. The vinegar wilts the lettuce if done in advance.

This is a great recipe, Next time I will leave the salt water alone.
