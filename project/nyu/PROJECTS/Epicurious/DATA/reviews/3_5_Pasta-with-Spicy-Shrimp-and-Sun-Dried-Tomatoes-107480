A definite keeper. We had to sub black olives for the kalamata, as that was what we had on hand, but the flavors were still delicious! Super easy to make. A great weekend meal with plenty of leftovers.

I was looking today foe a pasta dish with shrimp and decided to make this one. It was delicious and my husband said this too after he finished his. I followed it exactly and suggest that you do too. I make the pasta al dented knowing I will finish it in the pan with the shrimp and tomatoes. Because I drained most of the liquid from the can tomatoes I needed toad a little of the pasta water when tossing everything together which is what the chefs do anyway. Sophisticated and good, worthy of company or a weeknight meal.

This recipe is simply delicious! It would be my favorite meal at my favorite restaurant and now I can make it myself! The blend of sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, lemon and red pepper create the perfect taste with shrimp (I skipped the shallots for personal reasons and used oregano because I prefer it to basil). I will make this one again and again for the most discriminating guests and just for myself and my hubby - YUM!!!!

Loved the recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly except I used goat cheese with my serving and my husband used parmesan. When I ate leftovers, I used feta...you can't go wrong with either. The feta does make it saltier, but it goes so great with the kalamata olives! A keeper!!

This is one of my "impress the guests" with little effort recipes. But, truth be told, I don't use black olives, I use stuffed green ones, and if I get the ones from the market that are already swimming in crushed red pepper, I save a step and eliminate the crushed red pepper. Often I will assemble my ingredients in advance and throw this together as I enjoy appetizers and wine with my guests. Add a salad and Italian bread and the meal is complete - and pretty colorful too!

ive made this dish three times and its always flavorful and delicious. i serve it with some freshly grated parmesan instead of feta.

Excellent! Could serve it without shrimp to make it vegetarian. Used half of the chili peppers because my husband likes mild flavors, but I could have used the amt the recipe called for.

Normally any recipe that includes sundried tomatoes and feta (two of my favorites) is a hit with me. But I thought this recipe was just ok. I didn't think the sliced shallots really worked with the tomatoes and linguine; I thought it detracted from the dish, and I would skip it next time. I thought the regular tomotoes overshadowed the sun-dried tomatoes; next time I would only use the half the amount of regular tomatoes. I would add 50% more crushed red pepper and basil.

Served this to company the 2nd time last night and, as before, very well received. Used frozen shrimp (who knew?) and had to omit the lemon peel because here in Mexico one can't always find yellow lemons (lemon here is a lime). Otherwise, exactly as written and it's a real keeper. Wonderful combination of flavors.

I made this last night and it was fantastic. I loved the flavors. I used squid ink pasta which gave it such great color. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. A quick, easy go-to delicious recipe.

This was absolutely delicious! I made a couple of changes - added about 2 T. of capers because I didn't have brined olives. I also add a couple T. of creole seasoning and upped the red pepper flakes a bit. I also added scallops to the shrimp. This is a "keeper."

Excellent recipe. Made the following changes added anchovy, no salt added. Great taste, loved the lemon zest.

This recipe was fantastic. I will definitely make it again. Good quality kalamata olives are key. The lemon zest brings out the shrimp flavors, and the fresh basil was wonderful. I used some fresh cherry tomatoes in addition to the canned and sundried ones. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. No need to add salt -- the olives and feta add enough salt. I used whole wheat pasta. Yum!

Excellent! Try with left-over chicken or tofu, since sauce flavors are strong enough to carry the recipe. I add 1/4 cup wine to sauce, toward the end of prep, if liquid is needed.

Great Recipe. I made it for Father's day and we all enjoyed it. I don't think you need the feta for the top, makes it a little salty

I read a lot of the reviews before I decided to post one. It seems that everyone who didn't rate this dish well changed it and did not follow the recipe. I cooked this dish exactly as it is written with two exceptions that did not totally change the dish. I seasoned my shrimp with a Bookbinders shellfish seasoning and I forgot to slice the sun dried tomatoes. Everyone that tried it really enjoyed the dish and asked for the recipe. I may try the artichokes or possibly drained diced tomatoes and mushrooms, but I think that the others that didn't enjoy it so much should give it a try as written before modifying the recipe.

Acceptable-this recipe is good-just not great, however, we don't like olives so used capers instead (at another reviewers recommendation)-if you have the ingredients, it is good to do in a pinch

Oh so wonderful. Used 1/2 pound of shrimp, 1 jar marinated artichoke hearts, fresh market linguine, and skipped the olives. Absolutely delightful, simple dish that has already been added to our regular rotation.

An ideal weeknight dinner - quick, easy and delicious. My only modification was to add the tomatoes with their juice as I felt that there would not be sufficient sauce.

I skipped the shrimp and olives on this dish and added artichoke hearts marinated in garlic and olive oil as well as mushrooms. I'm not a vegetarian but it came out as a delicious vegetarian dish. I also used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and artichokes instead of plain olive oil. My picky carnivorous husband and I loved all the wonderful flavors that came from this dish. I will definitely make it again!

This a delicious, easy dish. I love making this for company or a romantic night in. I add a few more tomatoes so I have a little more sauce. I highly reccomend.

A good recipe that lends itself to modification. My boyfriend hates olives, so I substituted them for artichoke hearts. Didn't add the lemon since that sounded weird to me. I did add the feta even though I thought that sounded odd also. When it was all mixed up it was really nice. I also used frozen cooked shrimp. Thawed and peeled them, then added them at the end. I also used the oil from the sundried tomatoes and the juice from the marinated artichoke hearts to saute everything. Pretty easy and tasty. If you don't happen to have shallots, don't bother to buy them. I don't think they added anything to this that an onion wouldn't.

I thought this dish was excellent, very easy, not alot of work involved and I agree with adding other ingredients like mushrooms, olives, etc. I would certainly add this to my pasta favorites.

Rating: 2
Having everything on hand, I decided to give this recipe a try. I took advice of others and added the drained tomato juice, and went with my own instinct and used less of the sun-dried tomatoes and kalamata olives. The sauce still had far too strong a flavor for the shrimp- their taste was lost. I might try the sauce again on its own, but lighten it up with more canned tomato and olive oil. There is a complexity of taste here that is worth exploring- it just doesn't quite live up to the ingredients yet. Some tweaking is in order.

This was delicious, so versatile. These are ingredients I always have on hand. I did use roasted garden roma tomatoes for the canned...

This was a delicious recipe - I made it for company and everyone had seconds. It was also really easy to get things assembled ahead of time, so that the cooking time is really quick. I doubled the amount of red pepper, deglazed the pan w/ some white wine before adding the tomatoes, and stirred in about half a cup of half and half right at the end to give it a little bit of a creamy consistency. Also used crushed tomatoes. Will definitely make this again!

This was a last minute selection because I had the ingredients. Excellent! It has a very complex flavor. Had to use dried basil. Can only imagine how much better fresh will make this. Also used sun-dried tomatoes and home canned tomatoes. This is fast and easy to make yet flavor is very intense.

Fantastic! I increased the amount of garlic and crushed pepper as others did, and it was just the right amount of spice. The feta and olives are really nice complements to the smoother taste of the shrimp. Easy to make, and I'd make this for friends.

This is a simple recipe, quick and easy to make, but there is something missing to the taste of it, as someone else mentioned. As a little advice, hold off adding the salt until the end, the tomatoes in the can often have salt. I have also added a bit of 15% cream at the end... which helped to make the sauce smoother. I think next time I will use pureed tomatoes instead of diced, as I didn't like the tomatoes seeds in the sauce. Overall, I though it was quick and simple, definitely for a weekday dinner, but I wouldn't serve this to my guests.

Rating: 4
I made this with only half the canned tomatoes, and only 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes; I had only 12 oz of shrimp. This made the sauce a lot more concentrated, but it was excellent. I made lemon risotto (from this site) to go with it, which was a perfect accompaniment. I put some of my extra lemon juice from the risotto into the tomato sauce, which really enhanced it. Relatively quick to make, too.

So simle ingredients and such a great result! I also used tomatoes with juice and otherwise kept the recipe exactly. Quick and easy, but fancy enough for company.

Like others, I added the juice from the tomatoes. I took it a step further though and added some chopped oven-roasted yellow tomatoes and some halved grape tomatoes. The depth of flavor from all the different types was incredible!! Also added just a splash of good chardonnay, and instead of linguine, I used orzo -it was fabulous!!!! My boyfriend raved....

Loved this recipe. To save time and the smell of cooking shrimp, I used frozen cooked shrimp that I defrosted and added on the last step to warm it up but not overcook it. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added the tomatoes juice and all. The leftovers were fantastic the next day too. This will go in my keeper file as I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Rating: 3
I found this too lemony. My husband and I liked it better the next day, too, after the flavors had settled a little. I would make it again just using half of the stated lemon peel or even just squeezing a lemon half over the sauce while it's cooking. BTW we used goat cheese instead of feta - i just like it better - and it worked well.

We love this dish! Definitely don't drain the tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. - If you have everything prepped beforehand, you just need 10 minutes in the kitchen to quickly saute the dish. My guests raved!

A wonderful dish. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil available and substituted the bagged variety. I cut the tomatoes into quarters and added boiling water to soften them (about 10-15 minutes). I added this mixture (including the liquid) to the other ingredients as specified. I used a little more crushed pepper than the recipe asked for and it worked out beautifully. I added virtually no other spices since the flavor was already perfectly balanced. I do agree that it is not a dish you want to make when you are crunched for time. Mainly because of the peeling and deveining of the shrimp.

All of us loved this. We did think we'd like more cheese on it and maybe some more crushed red pepper, but it was really, really, good. I used extra shrimp since the whole family loves it. It did crack me up, however, that this recipe is in the "Too busy to cook?" section. Peeling and deveining those shrimp and chopping up all the garlic, shallots, basil, and olives, took quite a long time.

Came across this recipe this weekend when weeding out my old Bon Appetite's. Luckily had everything on hand & was pleasantly surprised.

Great combination of tastes (to Beth: yes, olives do help). Chewing each mouthful gave a nice explosion of tastes as you chewed into a dried tomato sliver or sliced olive (I used canned sliced olives) or cheese, and I don't consider myself a fan of feta cheese or olives. It's a very mediterranean taste. I'd agree w/ the other reviewers...I'll add more of the tomato juice from the diced tomatoes next time. I also used a full box of 16oz linguine which is a bit too much pasta for the ingredients listed. Use the 12oz as specified for a better pasta to sauce ratio. Makes about 5 hearty lunches if you use a 16oz box of linguine, so 12oz will give you a nice 4 servings.

We loved this easy pasta dish! It was a winner mainly because everything we needed was in our pantry or freezer! My husband loved it and we'll make it again. My only adjustment may be adding more of the juice from the tomatoes. Thanks!

Made as written, but should have followed my instincts, (and another reviewer's suggestion), and added liquid to the recipe. Easy enough to do by either not draining the tomatoes, or adding wine, pasta cooking water, etc. The flavors were very good, but way too dry for my taste. Will definitely make again with minor adjustments.

Perhaps it was because I didn't put the olives in, but with everything else strictly by the recipe, I was VERY disappointed with the results. Not nearly enough flavour with all the ingredients and time it took. There are MUCH better uses for shrimp, IMHO. My husband and I ate a minimal portion each, and the rest went in the trash. I think it was the consistency of the sauce, which wasn't really sauce at all. Terrible waste of good shrimp.

This dish was easy to prepare on a weeknight and tasted good. I bought a bag of frozen shrimp, used canned sliced black olives and chopped up the tomatoes in the food processor. I also used angel hair pasta, so everything cooked up quickly. My husband preferred grated Parmesan instead of the feta but I thought both tasted good.
