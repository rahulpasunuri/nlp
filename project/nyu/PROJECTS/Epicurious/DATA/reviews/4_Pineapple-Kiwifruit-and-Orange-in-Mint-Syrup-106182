We just used pineapple. The sauce is simple, quick, and surprisingly good. A bit of a throwback to the old days of fruit cup, but given how easy and tasty it is, who cares? Will make it again tomorrow.

You can use other types of fruit as well, such as bluebarries, grapefruit, strawberries... This dessert was delicious and very refreshing, ideal for summertime or after big meal.

This recipe is refreshing and delicious--not too sweet and not too tart. It's also very simple to make (always a plus). It works equally well as a great addition to a brunch spread, a twist on the usual plain fruit salad for a party or BBQ, or a fantastic light dessert. I sometimes add mango to the mix as well. Yum!

I am a mint lover and I delighted in this easy to make mint syrup over fruit. However, I did not stop there - I made the Ricotta Orange Fritters (recipe also found on this site) and put the two desserts together in a bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely decadent yet not too rich. Wonderful!

Delicious as it is written, though my favorite substitution is mango instead of oranges. Very tropical. I served this at my son's birthday party, and even non fruit eaters were diving in.

This is a great salad - easy to make, and everyone loves it. The second time I made it I substituted cenned mandarin oranges - worked wonderfully, and made it even easier. If you are making this in hot weather, make extra mint syrup for your ice tea.
