This was one of the biggest hits of Thanksgiving. I didn't use it as a stuffing, but as a stand alone side dish. I made some modifications - instead of the brown rice I used wheat berries. Also, I didn't use any butter, just olive oil. And, I didn't use the chile. It was fantastic. Made it a day ahead in the dutch oven, warmed it up on the stovetop with a little chicken broth to keep it moist. It was equally delicious as a leftover the next day. Definitely a Thanksgiving staple, if not a regular dish for us to enjoy year-round!

Followed this recipe to a tee for the first time and am surprised at what's missing to make this worthy of being in a Bon Appetit issue. Don't forget the basics. ie. Season mushrooms and rice as you cook them. This recipe states to add 1 tsp towards the end and season to taste at the end. Not the right way to cook the dish... turned out bland. Also, the rice to mushroom ratio is way too high. The second time I cooked this i used half of the recommended rice and added some grated Parm-Reg cheese at the end and a couple spoons of truffle oil to jazz it up.

The dried chili adds a nice heat to the recipe. Looks complicated with the number of steps but actaully quite straight forward to make assuming you have prepped accordingly. Was well received by the Thanksgiving crowd
