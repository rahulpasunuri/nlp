Easy and good. I make this often and guests love it. Add whatever fresh herbs are in the garden. Grill with chicken breasts pesto: Take largest chicken breasts available. Marinate a few hours with fresh basil and purchases Italian salad dressing and olive oil (marinating is optional). Coat with olive oil if not marinated. Grill for 5-8 minutes each side. Spread immediately with pesto (be generous), then slice as though for sandwiches. Serve on a bed of arugula, olive oil, lemon juice, and shaved parmesan. Put a dollop of pesto mayo on the side. Or offer as sandwiches. Fantastico.

Excellent grill side dish! I added dijon mustard and a little cayenne pepper for a kick to the oil mixture. Put everything in a grilling basket and it turned out great. Key is to make sure that the potatoes are 80% cooked and fairly tender before you put them on the grill.

We love this, although I've made a few modifications. I toss the potatoes with the herbs and parmesan prior to grilling it. I've also made this in the broiler. I've made the recipe with the herbs it calls for, as well as with sage, mint, rosemary, and thyme. All combinations of herbs have been great. This is a wonderful addition to BBQ'd meats.

Fantastic potato recipe to use when grilling.I did cut down on the garlic because I was afraid it would be too strong. Easy and everyone loved it!

Love this recipe. Who knew there was a new way to make potatoes? These are now in my summer rotation.

Loved this recipe. It is so easy and the flavor is fabulous. I did not drizzle with oil after grilling. I would not recommend the tinfoil method either. The grill flavor and crispness of the outside makes this special along with the grill marks..

Excellent exactly as written. I DO NOT recommend putting the potatoes in foil packets. The potatoes get wonderfully crispy cooked directly on the grill grate. The fresh herbs combined with the grilled flavor are fantastic.

Excellent combination of flavors. I took the advice of previous reviewers and put the cooled, sliced potatoes in tin foil before placing them on the grill. I served these with the grilled tuna with herbed aioli, also on this site, and a simple mixed greens salad. A wonderful way to enjoy this temperate August weather.

Made this many, many times - excellent! I do not use the barbecue - I put them in the oven at 350 degrees instead.

This was an excellent recipe. I followed the advice of a previous poster and created a tray out of tinfoil, put the quartered, cooled potato pieces in that 'tray' with the other ingredients, then grilled it together for 25 minutes. Pefect!

These potatoes were a big hit at my last dinner party! I didn't have fresh oregano so I used dry but it still turned out fabulous! I kept them whole, instead of boiling them, I nuked the potatoes for about 8 minutes, then roasted them in the oven @ 375F for about 40 minutes. A 4-forker!

I thought these potatoes were good, but my guests loved them & fought each other for them. I also thought they were a considerable amount of trouble - cooking them twice and all, a few rolled off the grill.

Unbelievable simple and delicious! I have made these about ten times. I, rare for me, didn't alter one thing in the recipe. It's perfect as is! Quick, easy, delicious!

I've made this a couple of times for guests and everyone absolutely loves them. I've modified this recipe a little bit...when the potatoes are done boiling and cut into bite size pieces, I place them on a sheet of foil and roll the edges a little bit to create a "pan". Drizzle olive oil on top, some salt and pepper and the rest of the ingredients. Put on top of grill (or oven if no room on grill) for about 20 to 30 minutes to let everything meld. Shifted the foil packet on top of a cookie sheet...easy cleanup for outdoor dining too.

Although this recipe takes a little more time to prepare and cook than it seems, I recommend it. My only suggestion is to add more olive oil after the potatoes come off the grill, so the greens stick better to the potatoes and the salad is less dry.

We did not like this recipe. It wasn't that flavorful..it was dry. It's an easy recipe to make, so I don't think I made it incorrectly. I don't recommend this one, especially if you're having guests.

Excellent potato dish! I reduced the oil to 3 T and increased the parmesan to 8 T, also roasted in the oven as the barbeque was full of yummy Jerk Chicken. After I added the cheese/herb/onion mixture, I returned to the oven for a few minutes to melt the parmesan, then gently tossed before serving - worked beautifully. This is destined to become a new favorite!

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice now, and agree that the recipe is perfect as is, however, I used a combination of shallots and green onions (out of necessity), and was generous with the parmesan cheese. Adults and (older) kids all loved it. A keeper.

Quick and easy. They were wonderful with the steak I grilled. Even my 3 year old, who will not eat potatoes liked them.

This dish was delicious. Our grill is on the fritz so I broiled them in the oven and they turned out beautifully. Make sure to put the potatoes in the onion/herb mix when they are still hot so the cheese will melt. And yes,the oil is essential to the success of this recipe, although I didn't use 4 TBS, I used 3 with perfect results. Oh, and I used ALL the garlic! Mmmmmmm!

I wonder if the cook from Boston/NY/LA omitted most or all of the oil. The oil is needed to make the seasonings stick. Sometimes you can cut out the oil with no ill effects. This isn't one of those times.

These were amazing. I grilled for longer than recommended, until the potatoes were browned. I also used a little more parmesan than the recipe called for.

Served this dish to rave reviews. It's perfect to serve beside a robust steak and grilled corn on the cob. Have all the ingredients in a bowl ready to toss when the potatoes come off the grill.

I wasn't at all happy with this dish--the potatoes cooked fine, but the seasonings didn't cling to them, so I had bland unseasoned potatoes sitting atop a bowlful of herb-cheese mixture. Strangely, my husband liked it, and he normally hates potatoes. I would use the method again but season the par-cooked potatoes (maybe oil and garlic and salt or paprika or rosemary or something) before putting them on the grill.

Wonderful recipe--tasted like restaurant quality potatoes! I changed this recipe a little cooking-wise. I boiled the potatoes, then put them in foil packets on the grill with the onion, garlic, herbs, cheese and drizzled olive oil over all of it. I added a little extra garlic also. Turned out awesome!!! Definitely a keeper!

Very good contrast with Fiery Skewered Shrimp. Definitely use the new potatoes... I had to use 1/2 new, and 1/2 russet. The new are much tastier. Also, I sprayed Pam on the sliced potatoes for the grill and added cilantro to the herb mix.

This is receiving a rare "4 forks" because of its versatility and ease of preparation. You can make whatever combination of fresh herbs you like - I used oregano and thyme. Plus you can use your favorite cheese - I used romano. I only added 1 clove of garlic since 3 is overwhelming when added raw. White new potatoes were just as delicious and this makes a fabulous picnic/bbq side dish and will impress guests!

Is it just me, or was the uncooked garlic in this recipe just way too much? My guests ate it all, but I could still taste the garlic the next day. I will make it again, but lighter on the garlic.

This dish was great!!! It's a great side to anything else you can think of. I broiled the potatoes, instead of grilling them, and they came out so delicious. Broiling took longer than grilling would've taken, but the taste was impecable. Would definitely do it again!

Very tasty. Grilling the potatoes gives them wonderful flavor. Don't overdo it though, or they can become dry. The onion/herb mixture is delicious, although since the garlic is raw I decided to use one large clove. It was plenty.
