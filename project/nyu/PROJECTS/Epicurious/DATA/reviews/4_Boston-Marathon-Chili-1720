This came out absolutely delicious. Everyone liked it. It makes a lot so I froze it. It tastes just as good when defrosted. I modified the recipe by using red peppers instead of green (I don't like green), 3 large onions instead of 2. I also thought it needed more garlic so I used closer to 10 gloves. I added another tblsp of cumin so used 3 in total instead of 2. I also added a tblsp on dried oregano and cilantro. I think the recipe could also use anohter can of black beans, using 2 instead of 1. It is delicious.

Pretty good start The Meat needs to be corse ground and leave out the Black beans. If you must have beans use Pinto's. jalapeno's can be undependable so determine how hot the pepper is before adding it same with the chili powder. Chopped raw Onions on the chili Guarentee Gas

I never review recipies but I always read the reviews... I really need to write about this one...I followed the advice of many reviewers and used the modifications suggested by A cook from Melbourn Fl. OMG the best ever chili - I omitted the jalepenos so our 16mos old would eat it (actually all of of my kids loved it) and a few dashes of green tabasco gave it the heat it was lacking - but it did not lack flavour! I've copied her review below so you don't have to dig through to find it (it is four pages back from here if you want to see the full comment) ---- From A Cook From Melbourn FL... Here is the "master" :) recipe: Include 2 t oregano, 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t red pepper, 1/4 t cayenne, 1 ounce semi-sweet chocolate, 2-3 T tom paste, 1 t ground coriander, 2 t brown sugar. As others noted, I too added another DRAINED 28 ounce can of tomatoes this one w/o juice, can of kidney beans, dropped the chili powder to 1/4 of cup (Spice Island brand of course), cumin to 1 T and upped garlic to 5 cloves.

I too have yet to find a go-to chili recipe that wows me but believe with this one Im close to it. Because I never used a couple of ingredients in any chili I made before and ones the cook from Melbourne, FL suggests we all add to this recipe, I went with her version using ALL top grade beef I ground, omitting the use of beans because the family prefers their chili w/o them. I questioned the use of cinnamon from the get go and should have went with my instincts. While I only used ½ tsp. it was the very ingredient that gave this chili an off flavor and will next time omit it entirely, staying with the 2T of cumin originally stated. I prefer the sweeter red to green bells and given the sweetness from the amount of onions used, found the addition of brown sugar unnecessary. When served with corn bread which has a fair amount of sugar in it, off-sets and compliments the heat of the spices nicely. I really liked the use of chocolate preferring bittersweet to semi-sweet that gave a distinct element of depth as opposed again to a sweet flavor I assumed I was going to taste. I have to admit that I totally overlooked the use of wine but liked the fact that this chili is thick and not soupy. Given the additions, it really isnt fair to give a rating but when I think of it, should have given four forks since Mom who is in her eighties (given the amount of spices) not only had some for lunch despite what I said about the cinnamon, asked for another scoop to eat with her chicken dinner. Now how can I counter that?????

This was a great recipe. I omitted the jalapeno and found that the chili had the right amount of heat. I also followed some of the suggestions for additional spices that were mentioned by others. I made this with 2# of coarse ground beef and 1# of pork cubes. The different textures were a great variation. Will definitely repeat.

So I altered this recipe for the slow cooker and it was a HUGE success. Heres what I did: sauteed the onions, peppers, and garlic (5 cloves) as per directions. Then added them to the crock pot. Then browned the meat and added that too. I then added to the pot: an extra can of tomatos w/out liquid, 3 tbs tomato paste, and 2 chopped chipotle peppers and added about a tsp of the adobo sauce. Next time, I'll add 3, this had a little heat but wasn't spicy. I was too chicken to add the chocolate, but definitely will next time. I left it on low for 8 hours, then added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans for the last 20 minutes. It was phenomenal and the meat came apart at the slightest suggestion of a nudge from my spoon. I'll definitely be making it again!

Rating: 4
Again, I used the additions from FL (kudos - you rock FL) but in addition substituted molasses for the brown sugar, chipotle jalapenos for the jalapenos, added Negro Modelo, some beef stock and about a handfull of red pepper chili flakes (sorry, not good at measuring, I throw some in and taste as I go). Simmered it for a total of eight hours hours (over two days) and just won first place at a fundraising chili cookoff on the base.

Rating: 4
Well, its 2011 and FL cooks adjustments are still being applied lol. I've done many many different chili recipes just like her and I must say I agree with her adjustments - though some I've always used (chocolate)and occasionally I add golden raisins (my own touch and it works for white chili also). Still a great chili recipe!

I made this on a Friday night and we ate it on a Sunday. It was fantastic! I followed the suggetions from the Melbourne, FL reviewer. I used beef and pork spare ribs. I started it on the stove and then moved it to my crockpot to simmer for several hours. I moved it back to the stove on Sunday to reduce/thicken the sauce. The meat fell apart and the flavor was great. The only thing I would do differently is eliminate the cinnamon.

Had high hopes for this recipe, especially with the stew meat and the pork. The flavor was good, but WAY too spicy for my family- unexpected in a chili from Boston! But I will make it again, adjusting down the chili powder.

Made this for the Packer game last weekend, and even though the game didn't have a happy ending, this chili saved our blue mood. It was great. I cooked it in the crockpot and took the Berkeley, CA reviewer's advise of adding cinnamon and semi-sweet chocolate. Served with corn bread and a big-ole salad. Fabulous!

This is THE chili that I have been looking for for an eternity. Everyone who tastes it must have seconds, and the toppings are not to be skipped, especially the cilantro. I followed the additions/changes of a reviewer from Melbourne, FL and wouldn't make this without her adjustments, so it's worth copying into another review, as follows: "Include 2 t oregano, 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t red pepper, 1/4 t cayenne, 1 ounce semi-sweet chocolate, 2-3 T tom paste, 1 t ground coriander, 2 t brown sugar. As others noted, I too added another DRAINED 28 ounce can of tomatoes this one w/o juice, can of kidney beans, dropped the chili powder to 1/4 of cup (Spice Island brand of course), cumin to 1 T and upped garlic to 5 cloves. I simmered for around 2 - 2 1/2 hours"

I made this chili recipe for a chili cook off among friends, and won first place. I used pork loin in place of the spareribs, and sirloin steak in place of the stew meat. I made the day before, up to the point where you add the beans and wine. I let the chili simmer alot longer than called for in the recipe.

I have been making Halftime Chili for several years now and the whole family loves it. I was looking for a chunky meat recipe. This one makes a very tasty chili. I followed the recipe ingredients as written and added some more mainly because the liquid amount called for in the original is nowhere near enough. I kept the same amount of meat, chopped faily small, added some oregano & thyme. 2 cans of tomatoes (28 oz each- 1 crushed & 1 petite diced) 2 cans of beans, 1 cup of chicken broth & 1 cup of red wine. Really good!

Rating: 3
This was so tasty! I did change a couple of things - red peppers instead of green, 2 chopped chipolte peppers in adobo sauce instead of jalapenos and I omitted the wine. I also cooked it about a half hour longer than the recipe stated for more tender meat. Husband loved it!

I've been using this site for 4 years, and only after eating this delicious(and slightly modified) recipe, did I dash to my computer to rate it. My partner and I were astounded by the rich flavours with what seemed likely to produce an okay dinner. Our modifications: Red (not green) peppers. More garlic. I added some chopped fresh oregano and thyme (cuz they were on hand) . We had ancho chili powder which we mixed with store-bought chili powder...I think this helped. We used canned chipotles (3 seeded) instead of jalepenos. On serving, we had chopped scallions, cilantro and queso fresco mixed with sharp cheddar as toppings. wow. Plus egg noodles for balance. Finally, after perusing the reviews, we will adopt some of Melbourne Fl's ideas next time. Thanks to all.

I also have been making this recipe for a couple of years. I did try the additions from Melbourne, FL, with the substitution of black olives instead of the beans. It definitely gives it a hearty more southern taste. Thought the chili was good before and now it's even better.

To the cook from MI, I'm sorry to hear. However, hopefully others will still give it a try being that the only extra "work" in my changes were a couple extra spices. It seems maybe you just prefer the ground beef version and to each their own as the story goes.

FINALLY!! I have made about every chili recipe on this site and beyond. Unfortunately after all the work I am just satisfied. NOT this time. I did incorporate other recipes which I think is key! (I usually hate when others totally change a recipe but you MUST try this!)

I made this recipe for the first time about a year ago, and have made it numerous times since. And on a day like today, when it is 30 below not including the wind chill, there is nothing better. Surprisingly, my husband and I agree that it is better with 2Ibs pork and 1 of the beef.

The secret to making this chili is to add semi sweet or bitterweet chocolate to taste( 1 or 2 oz) It has a mole flavor then and it makes all the difference. Also, the cheese, cilantro, onions and sour cream on the side are a must.

I guess I'm the voice of dissent, but I thought this chili was bland and lacked any depth of flavor. I doubled the beans and tomatoes as per other recommendations, but it still only had the flavor of chili and cumin. Usually my chili has other herbs and seasonings, I guess I just like that better. On the plus side though I really liked the pork for tenderness and will be adding that to my other chili recipes.

Made this particular chili for today's Patriots playoff game. We've renamed it Redemption Chili, as I have a history of making bad chili every January. The streak is now broken!!! This chili is just spicy enough, the pork/beef combo is great for flavor/tenderness. I used double beans and tomatoes also, and would do it again.

My family LOVED this and asked that I make it again for an upcoming dinner. I substituted cayenne powder for the chili powder and tossed in some basil and thyme instead of the cumin (didn't have any). I added an extra can of tomatoes. This recipe served 3 adults and 2 kids (10 & 6) with a bowl left over for me for lunch. My granddaughter said, "Grandma, this GREAT!". I told her it was a 4 forker! Indeed, it is.

I thought this recipe was awesome. First I made it exactly as the recipe stated, (which was fantastic, but a little salty) then I added 2 cups of Merlo and a can of Rotel Chili Fixins, 2 cans of black beans and 1 lb. hamburger.

Having made the chili, I definitely agree about the all pork and more beans (I added some other colored beans for contrast). The one thing I decided while reading this recipe, use a salt-free chili powder. It is a bit harder to find, but given the amount of chili powder requested, it made sense.

I've made this chili several times and think it's great. It's easy to make, flavorful, and not too spicy. It's also an attractive dish. After you ladle the chili into a bowl, you garnish it with green cilantro, orange cheddar, red onions, and white sour cream--a colorful and delicious dish!

This is a basic but terrific recipe. I used the exact spices and liquid called for and it was perfect. I agree with those who suggest 2 or 3 time the beans, however, as you need something for all that great sauce. I also used a bit more jalapena peppers than called for (but without the veins) and it was very flavorful but not at all hot. Next time, I, too, might use all pork. The beef tastes good, but the pork just melts in your mouth.

We love this chili! The first time we made it, we used half beef and and half pork. All subsequent versions have been made will all pork -- it gets so tender! We also increase the beans, using both black and chili beans, to make it a bit healthier. Wonderful stuff.

This chili is premium -- I'll never use ground meat ever again! The meat is so tender, and the flavor is not to be outdone. I've made this recipe many times, and it's great, no matter how many slight modifications I've tried. This is so good that I can't seem to move on to any other chili recipes.

This was my first experience making chili with cubed meat, and it was wonderful. I did increase the tomatoes and beans, and simmered the chili for about six hours - the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. I did mess up and forget the wine, but it was still fantastic. Now, however, at my house we'll be calling this "Superbowl Chili".

This was a great alternative to the standard ground beef chili. I am not a bean fan so I left them out. Used 2 pounds of beef and 1 pound of pork, cut into very small pieces. I made this the day before I planned to serve it, adding the red wine during reheating. Even a few kids in our crowd liked this. Very, very good.

I also used only stew beef, increased the beans (I used kidney and pinto), increased the tomatoes a bit and cooked it for 3 hours. The result was a very flavorful chili with very tender pieces of meat (I cut the stew meat into 1/2" pieces too). I think that cooking it for only 1 1/2 hours just isn't enough time for the flavors to blend and the meat to be tender.

Bon Appetite thank you for keeping the recipe in your files. It's definitely a keeper in this household.

I've made many types of chili in the past, but this was one of the best. I loved the combination of pork and beef. The only modifications I made was to add one can of kidney beans along with the black beans and cut the cubes of meat about 1/2". My husband loves spicey food, so we put a total of 4 Jalapeno peppers minced towards the end. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was great chili! I also skipped the pork and used all stew beef. I doubled the tomatoes and beans and used two chipolte chilies instead of the jalapeno. It was just spicy enough. I made it for a superbowl party and it was gone before half-time! I'll definately double the recipe next time!

We made this for New Year's Day bowl-game watching, and it was lauded by all. My vision was for the meat to sort of fall apart in shreds into the chili, the way I remember my Dad's doing...that didn't happen, despite two days of simmering, but it still tasted good.

This is a dish well worth the time, although it isn't all that laborious to prepare. I had no bell peppers, but to balance the recipe out I used canned tomatoes with italian herbs and roasted garlic, whatever I had on hand. It turned out great.

I made this chili today for the Superbowl and shared it with a few guests, including 2 teenagers. It was a big success! All ingredients were easy to shop for, already had most on hand. The supermarket had pork and beef already cubed. I had it ready by the time the game started--very easy to prepare. The meat was tender and the flavors were terrific. I especially liked guests being able to add the toppings to suit individual tastes. The cilantro was surprisingly pleasing. We give the chili--and the Broncos--a big thumbs-up!
