I thought this was fabulous! I followed the recipe essentially to a T; the only sub was a portobello/regular mushroom mix instead of the oysters (which made the flavors more robust, I would think). The sauce is DIVINE - a sophisticated, subtle mix of classic Mexican and French (!!) that makes you want to lick your plate. Awesome with mashed potatoes.

I used a frenched rib roast of pork. I used mixed dried mushroom, reconst.in stock/chardonnay mixture. I pan roasted the cumin and s&p rubbed pork, after I had caramelized the side the roast. I used homemade chicken stock, unsalted. I built up a pan sauce, deglacing with shallots and thicken with stock and corn starch slurry. I plated with carrots dressed with tarragon butter, Red skin potato boiled and riced, big slices of pork with a some lovely sauce.

Yummy Yum! Big hit with my husband. The roast came out perfect ~ juicy and tender. I roasted at 375 convection and roast browned nicely. The gravy was excellent. I did a few substitutes which I will continue with when making again: I used 1# baby bellas each cut in thirds. I didn't have sherry so used port. I omitted the cilantro. I served with yukon mashed potatoes and green steamed beans. And of course had an excellent bottle of vino with it.

loved the flavors of the sauce - It was delicious. I added water and wine to the roasting pan to add moisture. The pork was tender and flavorful. Only changes I made were to make a rub of chili powder, salt, pepper and cumin and let the roast sit for a few hours. I browned the roast and cooked for 40 mins with 2 onions under the rack. The onions add a lot and were delicious on their own served with the pork. I did not add the jalapeno because I did not have any. It was not missed, but it might be nice to try for next time. I would definitely make this again - especially for company.

Loved this one, super flavors. I used pork loin instead and they turned out great. The garlic mashed potatoes were a perfect match. You know it's a success when all dinner guests ask for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I followed the recipe except for the following: I used 14 oz of baby bella mushrooms, fresh lemon oregano from my garden(different than Italian), and I forgot to add the last teaspoon of cumin. We could taste the cumin from the roast, but I'll add the additional teaspoon of cumin next time. All the flavors blended together wonderfully.

fabulous. a definate keeper. i would like to say i made as written because i like to do that the first time, but sometimes things just happen. my sub was the 'shrums - used 5-6 oz dried morel and 5-6 oz dried shitake, reconstituted for a few hours in the broth, plus a handful of fresh baby bellas near the end. scrumptios. also, corn starch for the flour and white onion for the shallots. we like heat so might try 2 jal pprs next time. also, if stovetop space allows, could just make the sauce in the roasting pan to save washing an extra pot. yum yum yum.

Recipe has potential, but not good as is. 2 tbsps is not nearly enough flour to thicken the sauce, pork should be browned first to avoid drying out, and cumin with oregano is a terrible combination. Ital-Mex fusion does not work well in this dish. Next time, I will use a tsp of corriander and some green chiles in lieu of the oregano.

Excellent recipe, served it for a Sunday family dinner. Even the grand kids were asking for seconds on the gravy. Made it as is and it turned out perfect.

I just found this recipe and decided to make it for company. Outstanding! The sauce really makes the dish. I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and encouraged our guests to use the sauce on their potatoes as well as their meat. Truly impressive! I would love to try it again with crimini mushrooms for some extra mushroom flavor.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, as-is. Some heat, but less than you might think if you deseed them (as I did - I won't next time - we like heat). PERFECT amount of sauce (most recipes underestimate). I will skip the cilantro next time (too tex-mex), and use cornstarch instead of flour for a better sauce consistancy.

I've made this dish a dozen times, and it's never disappointed me. I always use sliced white/portobella/crimin, as I like the meatier flavors. Goes great with a bitterish green crunchy vegetable, and sweet potatoes.

Fabulous! Bought mushrooms 1st at Farmers Market and were looking for what to do with. Already had pork in mind so were delighted to find this recipe. Enjoyed on back porch via candlelight on this 1st of October eve. Served with butternut squash recipe also obtained through Epicurious...once again you made our dinner party a success!

This was delicious, but perhaps I didn't prepare the oyster mushrooms correctly (what is meant by "halved?"), as I left the stems on and that made the sauce a little "stringy." Think I'll definitely cut the stems next time, otherwise very flavorful and great with mashed potatoes.

We loved the recipe. I also added a combination of mushrooms (shitake and button.) I do agree with 'A Cook from SF Bay Area on 03/12/03' that the jalapeno will overpower the sauce if you are not a 'spicy food' person. I suggest compromising for a small can of diced green chilies. It adds a hint of spice that almost anyone can tolerate and still gives it the pepper flavor that it needs. We also served it with jerk pork and smashed potatoes. Great combination!

This recipe was delicious. I had to make a few subs (long hot green pepper, dried herbs, dry red wine) and the result was still very good. Will definitely make again, especially looking forward to using fresh herbs.

i've made this dish several times and highly recommend it. great company dish as it is easy to prepare and is sure to impress. this most recent time i made it with baby bellas (pre-sliced - wonderfuly easy!), omitted the jalapenos (wasn't sure if our company could handle the heat), and the fresh oregano and it was still great. i even had to improvise with the gravy because i didn't use a roasting pan. the recipe is very forgiving. our guests raved!

This pork dish is the best I have yet to make. The sauce is unbelievably good, I actually substituted a boneless pork roast for the loin - delicious! I will make it for guests next time around!

What a wonderful dish! The pork was moist and tender; the sauce superb! I used Baby Bellas and it turned out fine. Next time I'll try a mixture of different mushrooms. I didn't think the jalapeno overpowered the dish. I loved the flavor of the cumin and pork together.

Jalapeno seemed to overpower the sauce. Not much flavor beyond the "hot."

Sorry..can't go with the consensus on this one. Neither one of us liked the flavor of this...

The havled oyster mushrooms provide large "sheets" of mushroom in the sauce. If you use a substitute, try slicing them thinly no thicker than 1/4-inch. Also, taste the sauce as you boil to thicken. You may find you should add more sherry if it tastes too floury, Use ground white pepper to season sause. Use roasted whole cumin seeds, then grind for richer cumin flavor.

This recipe was easy to make and very, very tasty! I definitely will make it again. Everyone raved about it! I used an exotic mushroom blend since I couldn't find fresh oyster mushrooms. Highly recommend this dish for anytime and especially for company! Served it with wild rice ( a great accompaniement) and veggies. A big hit! Try it! You won't be disappointed!

This recipe was wonderful! It was one of the best new recipes I have tried lately. This pork loin makes great next-day leftovers, even more flavorful than the day before.

I was hurried to prepare, so I substituted button mushrooms for the oyster mushrooms, and Chardonnay for the Sherry. Turned out well as an alternative to the all too common pork lion roast that is typically served with applesauce.

This sauce is excellent and very easy to prepare. My fiance moaned in Epicurian delight when he first tasted this dish. Served it for Valentine's Day with wild rice and grilled red peppers. What a hit!

Finding oyster mushrooms isn't my problem, being willing to pay for them is. I used 3.5 oz. of oysters and buttons for the rest. The gravy deserves the oysters and is divine. I added some lemon pepper to the pork and no salt and that, too, was moist and delicious. I served this with wasabi mashed potatoes, and baby carrots sauteed in olive oil, then sprinkled with water and braised, then a little dried dill and lemon pepper. My finicky daughter went back for more!

Excellent! Did not have oyster mushrooms, so I substituted portobellos, coarsely chopped. Baked sweet potatoes along side the pork. Really delicious!

Excellent... I put tamarind chutney (it could be juice or paste) in the sauce and some lime juice to lift a bit the taste and cut the fatty taste of pork. It was an excellent sauce.

This was the first roast, of any kind, I have ever made, and it was very easy and delicious. I cooked it at a lower temperature (about 350 degrees) for longer, until it reached 160 degrees per the meat thermometer. It took about 1-1/2 hours and was very moist. Also, mixed shitake mushrooms with the oysters.

A last minute decision to make this for Christmas dinner meant that we couldn't track down the oyster mushrooms at our local supermarket, so I used shitakes and buttons. It was still excellent and the complexity of oyster mushrooms must make it even better.

Excellent dish with accurate and easy-to-follow directions. The sauce matched well with sweet mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. We capped off dinner with pumpkin pie, always a good thing. Any leftover pork plus a cranberry relish would go great on a sandwich.

If you dont have fresh oregano and need to use dried, be sure to reduce it by half. Also I would suggest mixing up the mushrooms with some buttons, shitake and oyster. The sauce over garlic mashed potatoes is unbelievable.
