I've made this a couple of times and it's a good basic recipe. It needs some zip so I think I will add just a little of prepared pesto, since I always keep some around, that should do the trick. Good, healthy side dish.

I was surprised how much my husband liked this. It was a nice change from rice or pasta and really added some interest to an ordinary week night meal.

Pretty good, but not outstanding. It's a good side dish and I will make it again. It's healthy and has some kick to it.

This is a really nice side dish. I added baby spinach leaves at the end - just stir into hot barley and they wilt.

Very good side dish; I served it with lemon-glazed chicken breasts and spinach for a healthy, quick dinner.

Surprisingly good. The lemon zest really finishes it nicely. Made it with the mustard-berry salmon from the same issue.

I tweaked this recipe by using yellow squash and zucchini instead of carrot and red pepper, no bay leaf. It was very tasty and light with the lemon flavor. I've used barley in soups before but I wanted to venture and try something new with it. Will use this recipe again for sure.

As barley lovers, this was a great alternative side dish!

We made this with the veal chops from the March 2004 of Bob Appetit. While the veal wasn't a huge hit, we both enjoyed the pilaf recipe. I made it without the bayleaf (just didn't have one on hand) but it was still tasty -- a nice change of pace from rice or pasta!
