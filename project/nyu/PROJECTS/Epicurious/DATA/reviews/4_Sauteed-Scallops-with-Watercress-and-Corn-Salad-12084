I loved this. Easy to make and just seemed like a perfect summer dinner. I used fresh corn straight from the farmers market and added some nice ripe tomato. I subbed romaine for the watercress but otherwise followed the recipe.

I love this recipe. I make more sauce than is specified, because the dressing is fabulous.

The salad was delicious, but the scallops were nice, but very bland. I would add a little paprika perhaps.

An excellent salad. I used bay scallops and spring salad mix instead of sea scallops and watercress. Use fresh sweet corn if possible as it makes a great contrast to the mustard. My spouse urged me to make it.

Made this for dinner last night, hubby couldn't stop saying how good it was. Followed the recipe's ingredients exactly except used a 50/50 blend of spring greens and baby spinach instead of watercress. Used fresh corn and rather than cooking it separately, I added it to the shallots after they softened along with the scallops. Will make again soon!

I have made this salad a number of times. It is easy and fast, and tastes like a million bucks. It serves like an expensive saled at a fine restaurant. The only changes I make are I omit the corn and I use baby greens instead of watercress. I always serve this salad with a Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc which has a nice crispness to it to balance out the basalmic and complements the scallops.

Really tasty- even when made in the middle of the winter when there is no fresh corn in sight. I absolutely recommend doubling the dressing- and the amount of scallops- half a pound is no where near enough for two people if you're serving as a main course.

Elegant, light, easy. I used mixed baby greens rather than watercress because that is what I had in the 'fridge. I agree with another reviewer that fresh summer corn is essential to the success of this dish.

Yum. I made this for my husband, whom I am weaning off pasta and onto fish! We loved it. I used fresh corn, but I'm sure frozen would be fine. Next time I might try to mix another green in with the watercress, but it's really great just as it is.

We loved this dish...it is a great weeknight dinner or a wonderful first course for a dinner party. Very easy. I did only use a bit of watercress, and then added some arugula & mixed greens. I also used fresh corn, which I think makes a difference. This would also be delicious with shrimp. Looking forward to making this again soon!

A very good dish that probably should only be made when sweet, fresh corn is in season. The preparation takes a bit of time but assembling it at the end, including sauteing the scallops, is a snap. My wife thinks it deserves 4 forks; maybe she's right.

I have made this recipe several times - the scallops are wonderful. It always gets rave reviews! I usually double the dressing recipe because everyone seems to want more, and leftovers are always used up quickly. I have also made the salads more elaborate depending on the time I have.
