I have been using recipes from Epicurious for years and this is the first review I have written (although many have been deserving). I am a serious cook (spend 2-4 hours in the kitchen every day) and prepared this recipe on Christmas day was one of the best meals I have ever made! I made it almost exactly as written with the exception that I increased the creole mustard sauce. Made the dirty rice a day ahead and brought both the rice and the gravy to room temp before combining. I had to stop my husband and kids from eating all of the dirty rice before it was even cooked! What an impressive meal...I will definitely make again and again!

I prepared this dish for Thanksgiving dinner at our open farm picnic and it was a big hit. I made a much larger amount of dirty rice and presented the crown roast with the rice in and under the roast. I kept the amount of sauce the same and I didn't change anything in the ingredients, so this review is untainted.

Husband, who is not a big rice fan, said it was so unbelieveable that he had multiple helpings, best he ever had. Pork was incredibly tender, beautiful presentation, and DOUBLE THE SAUCE. Everyone raved about it.

The rice stuffing and sauce are beyond compare, but the pork is so-so. This was my first time preparing a crown roast and will be my last. I found it dry and unremarkable compared to other pork roast cuts. There's a lot of the chop exposed on this cut of roast which seemed to have made it easier for it to dry out. Brining might help that, as would cooking it to about 155 (instead of 160) before letting it rest. I won't hesitate to make the rice and sauce again, just with a different cut of pork.

We made this for our gourmet club when we were hosting the dinner at our house. It turned out fabulous. We used the giblets to make the gravy but put italian sausage in the actual rice. Be careful when adding the gravy to the rice to ensure you get the consistency desired. Since we had made this earlier to see if we liked it we used more rice (2 cups) then all the gravy was used. The rice is alot of work but it helps that you can make it the night before. A definate keeper.

This dish is worth all the work! On the advise of one of the reviews, I used Italian Sausage rather than liver, and would recommend the substitution. The rice was wonderful, but the best part was the mustard sauce. Next time I have to find a way to make extra mustard sauce - everyone loved it and it went fast.

The dish that turned me into a pork lover. I did not make the stuffing, so I can not comment on that, but the meat was incredibly tender and flavorful and the sauce was the PERFECT complement.

The pork was a ton of work but worth it for a dinner party or special occasion. I too substituted italian sausage for the chicken livers in the rice and it. worked out just fine. I will have to say that the rice dish was more work than it was worth. I would look for an easier rice dish that has more "splash" to use with the roast.

The CROWN ROAST OF PORK WITH DIRTY RICE STUFFING AND CREOLE MUSTARD SAUCE was our first meal of January 2000 - what a delicious start to a new year. My children still rave about the meal-especially the DIRTY RICE. The pork roast was superb. One word - Delicious!! Now we are searching for this New Year's dinner menu. Thanks for the great variety of menus and recipes. The reviews are very helpful too!

Superb stuffing and really goes well with the pork even though it has giblet. My only suggestion is to make the stuffing ahead of time. It's a lot of time for the day of the dinner if you don't. Cooked Pork to 165F and it was perfect. I also cooked it in an oven bag and it cut the cooking time by 30 min.

DELICIOUS, IMPRESSIVE & EASY! This would be a great recipe for a holiday dinner. The stuffing requires a little time & planning (you can substitute ground pork if your family isn't fond on chicken giblets) but the flavor is marvelous. Makes quite an impressive presentation.
