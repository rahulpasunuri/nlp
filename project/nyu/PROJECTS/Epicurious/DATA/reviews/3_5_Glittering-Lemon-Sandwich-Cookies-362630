They weren't spectacular. I followed the recipe and added some lemon but they turned out all chalky. Threw out the batch.

These are very pretty and a freshing dessert to have along with another mini dessert. I agree that you should flatten the balls slightly or it's very hard to make them stand up when you make the sandwich. The lemon filling is VERY good so make extra. There's barely enough with this recipe.

these were very tasty! However, the round shape was a bit heavy and the icing was a little thin, so they didn't stay together. Next time, i will probably flatten and make disks, and add more confectioners sugar to make filling thicker. They are very festive. Since you can use any color sprinkles, could be made for any holiday/season

These are good but not great. I read the reviews before making them. To avoid running filling, I skipped putting the corn syrup in. They are cute and a nice additional to a cookie tray.

I followed many of the recommendations about adding extra lemon and refrigerating the icing and they looked wonderful, however in the end I wasn't happy with them because they turned out dry. They definitely didn't melt in my mouth like I had hoped.

I made over 700 of these cookies for a company's new year gifts so I am an expert on this recipe. Don't change any of the ingredients but you may need to change your utensils. These cookies are hand rolled, use dusting sugar and then you still have to frost them but they are so cute and delicious they are worth it. Be liberal with the lemon. Thicken your frosting with extra pow sugar if they will be sitting longer. Use a metal (no airbake) cookie sheets and roll them small. People will love!

I finally made these, after saving the recipe for almost a year. After reading several of these reviews (& being in a heat wave in Houston at the time), I used only 1/2 the butter suggested for the filling and it all came together beautifully. I will make these again, probably using a rosewater filling and substituting vanilla bean for lemon zest in the cookie. They'll make a great valentine's day giveaway.

The flavor was awesome in both the cookie and icing. I did use 1/2 tsp lemon extract in the cookie and 1 tsp in the icing. I had the same problem that everyone else had that the icing just melted off the cookie. I also think that the ratio of cookie to icing could have used a little more icing. They were delicious, but I wish there was a way to get the icing a little less melty.

FABULOUS COOKIE, very pretty and great taste. Claristotle's review was very helpful. Make the filling in advance and chill it. I used a teaspoon ice cream scoop that was perfect for forming the balls (the suggestion of a mellon baller would work too, but the scoop pops them out easily). You get a nice round top and flat bottom. No need to sugar the bottoms. I chilled the dough and put the formed "balls" on the cookie sheets in the freezer for 5+ minutes and they held their shape. The cookies have to be chilled after filling, the filling does "melt" when it gets to room temperature. I will experiment with the frosting next time to see if I can get a consistency that will hold up better to room temperature. These are very pretty cookies and worth the effort.

Dallas is going through a heat wave, so I ensured a non-melting cookie by substituting 1/4 cup crisco for some of the butter in the cookie, and using crisco alone in the filling. The cookie turned out perfectly. I used the small side of a melon baller and sugared every cookie. I used oil-extracted lemon 1.5 tsp, and .5 tsp vanilla extract in the cookie dough, and added .5 tsp lemon extract to the filling. I colored the filling yellow, but left the cookie natural with normal white sugar. These turned out very bright and happy for the baby shower I attended. They are definitely adult cookies, as they are not overly sweet, but were a huge hit. The filling would have been better with butter, but it was a necessary sacrifice.

It was difficult to see when the cookies were ready. I had them in my convection oven for easily 35 min. rather than the 12-15 it said it should. I took them out at 15min and they just crumbled when touched. I just kept checking every 5 min after that. The filling is grainy and either melts since it's mostly butter, or really hard if you keep them cooled (but, the lemon flavor was really nice). The cookies tasted good, but I would never serve them the way they melt or for that matter bother making them again. Taste wise, if you don't mind the mess they are not bad. I might consider using just the filling for a sponge cake topping or something....

Gorgeous cookies. I used Claristotle's suggestions, which really helped. I also inadvertently tested regular v. air-insulated cookie sheets. The ones baked on the air-insulated sheets turned out MUCH better, perfectly round and plump, than the ones on regular cookie sheets, which spread. I was expecting more of a citrus bite. Next time, I'll increase the lemon zest and maybe add a little lemon oil.

These were really delicious. I agree about chilling the frosting, I didn't chill it and it was frustratingly runny. They have a delicious shortbread texture and the lemon frosting gives the delicate cookie a nice citrus punch.

Yummy cookie! Before I made these cookies, I read all the reviews from this recipe and the identical 2008 recipe (which had more negative reviews). Here are some tips: First, make the filling well in advance and chill. I chilled my frosting 2 hours before starting the cookies, and it was firm and easy to work with. However, it softens up pretty quickly, but never gets runny. Second, make sure to use the SCANT teaspoon when rolling the cookies. Any bigger and they just look weird. Third, press down each ball slightly. After the cookies are done cooking, they will look like the picture: round on top with a flat bottom. You won't have to worry about dumbbell-looking cookies :) Follow these tips, and your cookie will end up looking like the picture. Out of all the cookies I made during the holiday season, this was the crowd favorite. A note about the cornstarch in the cookie: I advise not altering the amount of cornstarch you put in the cookie. If you taste the cookie dough, you will get an overwhelming cornstarchy taste. After it cooks, however, the cornstarch taste is less prevalent. I personally enjoy the slight starch/lemon combo; they work perfectly together. And these cookies are not soft by any means. They can't if you want them to stay put together. But they do melt in your mouth and the contrast of the firm cookie and soft filling in phenomenal. Don't skip these cookies because of the bad reviews! Make them and you won't be sorry!

Looooved this cookie... didnt have the sanding sugar so i used regular sugar and coloured it with regular coloring... didnt look as fabulous.. but i would still make em again.. will try it with coconut next time

These are yum, but didn't pack as much punch as I was expecting (given that they are so pretty). I agree with pbmi that the cornstarch does dry out the cookie giving it a "crunch" but also allowing it to not fall apart during icing. I dolloped balls onto my cookies pans and they did not flatten out much as in the pics included and so my cookies look more like little barbells rather than sandwiches...i will flatten them a bit next time!

These are tasty. I didn't measure the scant teaspoon of dough and mine ended up being too big. The smaller the dough ball the better. Very fun to make and tasty.

Easy and worth trying. However, the corn starch amount leads to a very dry cookie. I will probably try this again and change the ratio of corn starch and flour a little bit. A little too dry for me although the flavor is good. I flattened my second pan a bit as putting two of the cooked rounded balls together leads to a pretty tall cookie.

We had so much fun making these this afternoon. I spent a small fortune on colored sugars and had 6 bowls of them for the cookies. My mother and I measured out the dough and shaped it into balls and my 3-year-old had a blast rolling them in the different colors. I counted the cookies when they went into the oven, and it was enough for about 48 sandwiches, but it sure didn't look like that many when they were done. I did chill the shaped cookies for about half an hour, as recommended in other reviews, and they held their shape well. I skipped the corn syrup in the filling, too. They look phenomenal and taste good, too.

I was on the phone when I tested this cookie, and the person on the other line thought something was wrong, because I just kept saying "Oh my God" over and over again. THey are amazing! I had no lemon zest on hand, so I just used lemon juice instead of vanilla in the cookie. Still great.

I gave up on this recipe in the middle of frosting the cookies. The cookies were really fragile and seemed dry. I gave up mainly because I couldn't keep the top cookie from sliding off the bottom cookie after it was frosted. Overall not impressed at all even after tasting 3 of the frosted cookies, especially with the time commitment it took to complete the recipe.

Sanding sugars are large crystal sugars most often used to decorate cookies and other pastries. They come in many colors. William Sonoma has a lot. Most places that sell decorating supplies should have them.

What are sanding sugars, and where can I find them?

Fantastic cookies - I make them every year for Christmas and they always get rave reviews. I'm shocked that there aren't more reviews. Also, these hold up really well for up to a week, and are sturdy enough to ship, AND you can freeze the dough. Great cookies!

These cookies are the single most delicious things in the entire world. Seriously. When they say they melt in your mouth, they mean it. They LITERALLY melt, but like, not in a gross way. They're ridiculously easy to make, absolutely adorable, a little time consuming, but generally fantastic. The only really bad part about them is that you'll want to eat them before they're assembled. The urge to abandon this review to eat more of them is almost overwhelming. Seriously fantastic.
