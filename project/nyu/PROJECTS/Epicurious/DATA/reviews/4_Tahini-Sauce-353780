For a real tahini add 1 small minced garlic clove and use cold water - it makes it whiter. You can make red tahini by blending it in a food processor with 1 tomato and reduce the lemon juice. You can make a green one with parsley (in a food processor).

very similar to my recipe except my measurements are a half cup of each in the blender - one big component is missing, however...a clove of garlic - dear lord, but is ever yummy and addictive - perfect in a pita wrap with grilled chicken or beef sandwich or blended with chickpeas for a great hummus
