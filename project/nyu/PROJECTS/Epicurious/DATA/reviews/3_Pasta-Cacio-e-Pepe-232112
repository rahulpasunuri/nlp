I made the version based on the review from the cook in Rome -- no olive oil or arugula. It was fast and oh, so delicious. Just like I had in Roma.

I thought this was a great, extremely simple dish. I skipped the extra step with the heated bowl. After the pasta was drained I returned it to the pot it was cooked in and added the oil and arugla there. I used the entire thing of Arugula. If you enjoy the tangy taste of Arugula use much more than a cup of it. I added cheese and pepper right on top as I served instead of mixing. It was perfect. I will make this again as an easy week night meal.

Agree with Laugizzi. Drop the arugula and the oil. Otherwise, this recipe is fool-proof and delicious. Get good-quality pecorino though.

I have to agree with laugizzi from Rome. While I was in Rome in March, I enjoyed every bite of a plate of Spaghetti Cacio Pepe (spaghetti with cheese and black pepper - simply put!) It was lucious and absolutely no arugula!

Just made this tonight after seeing Lydia Bastianich's version (spaghetti, no oil, no arugula) on TV. Couldn't believe how simple and delicious this dish was, and made with ingredients I had on hand. I used whole grain cappellini and it turned out great. The key is keeping the pasta warm and using enough pasta water to make the cheese melt and get saucy. Also, the peppercorns must be very coarsely crushed to give the best flavor. Give it a try!

BLASFEMOUS!!! Cacio and Pepe does not require neither arugula or Olive Oil!!! Cacio and pepe ingredients are: Spaghetti (Ideally Bucatini) Water Salt (for the water) Pepper Pecorino Cheese This is how to cook it. Pour the spaghetti into the salted boiling water. Cook them for as long as they need When you drain the pasta, keep some of the cooking water aside.. Then put the pasta back on the pot where you boiled it and add a bit of water, a bit of Pecorino cheese and then stir& Then add some black ground pepper and keep stirring& Then add the some more pecorino cheese and keep stirring& Etc... The pasta will be ready once the cheese, the cooking water, and the ground pepper have amalgamated together forming a creamish sauce. You may add some olive oil into the boiling water to prevent pasta from sticking together (This is one of the oldest trick in the book), but do not add it together with the sauce!!!

This is now on my "make regularly" list. I had it twice in Rome this spring, and fell in love with it. I use Parmesan cheese, since we don't like Peccorino Romano on its own. Guests like it, and it's so easy. It's good without the arugula, as it's served in Italy. Pronounce the first word as: catch-o.

Highly recommended. Brings up the flavors of each ingredient in an elemental way. We found that 2 tbs oil makes a better balance. (We are using 2 cups dry penne regate, which may or may not amount to the same quantity as 6oz, but is perfect for our 2 servings.)

Just made this for lunch on Saturday - I loved it. I didn't have shaved pecorino but I used grated instead... I also added some parmesan reggiano since the pecorino's a little strong for my taste. It was delicious... the arugula was a little too wilted the next day as leftovers but it was still good.
