Followed the directions to the letter, and I was almost finished when I realized that the soup was suppose to be served chilled. Well, it's November in the Sierra Nevada mountains and chilled soup isn't very appealing so I pureed soup, did not strain it, and served it hot. Very one liked so it works as a "hot" winter soup, too.

This soup is great. Tasty, sweet and warm. I will cook this again. Leaves a wonderful aroma, too.

I have made this soup over and over for large groups and small, and each time, it is a huge hit - more than one person has said "it is the best soup I've ever had." Always multiple requests for the recipe. I make a few slight changes - always use more garlic, I grate ginger (keep my bulbs frozen) into the first mix, and add cinnamon along with the curry. Also, I substitute salsa for the tomato. I always make my own chicken stock, and shred chicken from that into the warm soup at the end. Serve Major Grey's chutney and chopped cilantro as garnish.

Great soup. I served it hot and everybody loved it. I think it would be great cold with a dollop of Creme Fraiche.

Souper well received summer soup. A tasty foil for bbqs. Forgiving, versatile and easy.

A delicious summer soup, even when made low fat with fat-free half & half instead of cream.

I use Epicurious all the time and this is by far the best recipe I have gotten on this site. Always make this for Thanksgiving (it tastes like a super version of squash/curry soup). This past Thanksgiving all 4 women guests asked for the recipe. A few tips: I use an immersion blender instead of a blender, I serve it hot, not cold, and if I don't expect the whple thing to be eaten in one night I add the cream to each bowl instead of the whole pot, as I don't like to refrigerate then reheat cream.

I tried some with chutney and some with chicken. It was fair. Does not improve overnight.

I loved this soup. Really tasty and flavorful. My husband prefered the chilled, blended form. I prefered it hot and unblended.

A great recipe. I prefer not to puree it, and to serve it over rice. On occasion, I've substituted dried cranberries for raisins, and half and half for the heavy cream. My friends love this soup!

I have been preparing this soup since it first appeared in Gourmet. It is terrific, and a family favorite.

Delicious, silky. A complex flavor. Not crazy about the color the curry produces, but once you taste it -- delightful. Maybe a garnish of chives would spruce it up a bit.

This soup is wonderful - the chutney is a great addition. I worked at '21' in the Eighties - they definitely used more cream then!

Added 2 cups frozen petite peas (as in another recipe I made years ago) before cooking mixture. Also increased cream to 1 cup and added after pureeing. It was a hit.
