I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and I pull it out every fall when I have zucchini in the garden. It IS more of a muffin as others have stated, but it's delicious and people cant eat just one. I generally do not top them with frosting as they can stand alone without the extra sugar. I have substituted the olive oil for coconut oil (virgin or otherwise) completely or split 1/2 and 1/2 with olive oil or canola-turns out great regardless of the fat you use. If I don't have a orange I use 5 drops of Orange Essential Oil. I love the crystallized ginger in the muffin - a nice zing and the kids even like them! I rough chop the ginger to about 1/2" pcs then I put in the food processor WITH the flour, this keeps it from sticking together so much when you pulse to try to get into smaller pieces. Some crystallized ginger is harder and some is really soft and fresh. I also add MORE zucchini without it effecting the recipe-up to 1/2 cup more. I find that mine are done at about 20 min and any more is just overcooking and dries them out. I like to do mini muffins and they take about 10 min, tops. In Utah, we have this altitude thing when baking, so I add 1 T of water to assist with the rise of the dough. Sometimes I add a pinch of nutmeg or cardamom for fun. I love this recipe - I'd give it a 10 if I could.

This is a really good recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce and it turned out beautifully. A tasty recipe for zucchini cupcakes!

Modified the recipe slightly to make as breakfast muffins: -fresh ginger (not crystallized), used a bit less, finely chopped -used 284g whole wheat + unbleached AP flour mixture -added nutmeg -used lemon zest in place of orange (I have a bountiful lemon tree) -used a bit less honey

I'm uncertain what I did, but the outcome for me was light as a feather. These were certainly not dense. I'd have appreciated a bit more body, in fact. The flavour reviews were good, but I agree the frosting could be skipped. Somehow they did remind me more of muffins than cupcakes, regardless of the lack of density.

These are most definitely NOT cupcakes! I'd say that they are a decent muffin, at best, and the frosting only helps because it lightens the incredible density. I made as written, and will not repeat this. They are dense and the texture and flavor do not help. I'll stick to zucchini bread, and if I want cupcakes that are "reminiscent of carrot cake", I'll make them using my carrot cake recipe.

Based on other reviews, I substituted canola for olive oil and reduced to 1/2C, and used fresh ginger (about 1/8th cup). I did not frost as I was looking for a breakfast muffin. These came out fairly tasty - great texture/moisture, good flavor. They were still rather gingery, and they aren't sweet at all. Good, but not the zucchini muffin fix I was looking for - they are more a delivery system for the ginger.

Rating: 3
very yummy, only the ginger clumped together in the food processor and i had to break it up with a knife. ended up with a few dry patches in the muffins, a little too much frosting, but that's all nit-picking, they were very good

I did not frost these and they were just great. I tried to pulse the ginger but, it was a waste of time. As suggested, I just rough chopped double the amount of ginger, omitted the vanilla and used organic cane sugar rather than honey, only because I was out of both. I will be making these again!

I would really like to give this 3.5 forks, but that's not an option, so 3 forks it is. Easy and delicious, very light, but definitely more like muffins than cupcakes. I only had about 2 T of crystallized ginger so I added 1 T of fresh grated ginger and it was still fairly subtle. The recipe says it makes 12, but I nearly filled my standard muffin cups and there was about 2 cupcakes worth leftover so I baked it in a ramekin and made a mini-cake. Once they were done I saw how beautifully they had crowned and realized I could have filled the cups right to the top without danger of them overflowing. Next time I won't bother with the frosting as I think they will be wonderful with just a smear of butter.

This recipe is great, really delicious. I substituted tofu cream cheese in the frosting, which didn't change the flavor. It was still tangy and delicious. Prep time is longer than the indicated 15 minutes, more like 25 minutes. And, the ginger flavor was more subtle than you might expect, so don't hold back. Also, people tended to refer to these as "muffins" rather than "cupcakes" but ate them up all the same!

I made cake from this this recipe and it is delicious. It's a little dense but tastes good. I replaced the crystallized ginger with fresh ginger (but less of it). I spiced it up with 1/2 tsp each of cardamom, nutmeg, crushed cloves, chili pepper and cayenne pepper (and 1 Tbsp of cocoa). The icing is good but I exchanged the vanilla with blood orange juice to give it some color and forgo-ed the cinnamon and zest.

I also just used chopped crystallized ginger (rather than pulverizing it into oblivion). Williams-Sonoma has excellent crystallized ginger (tender and not fibrous) that actually is well priced. Very nice crumb - it does not have the rubbery texture some zucchini breads have. I used a squash that kind of looked like a big round zucchini, but was something different, and it worked very well. The frosting, though nice, is optional. I think if one increased the spices and threw in some nuts, this would make a very nice unfrosted muffin for breakfast.

I made this using two 8 inch rounds, baking for 25-30 minutes, and I couldn't find crystallized ginger so I used the same amount of minced fresh ginger. The cake turned out great! Moist and fluffy cake, not too sweet, with some rich and indulgent cream cheese frosting, mmm! I too had to use more like 2 cups of powdered sugar, and I still felt that the consistency was too runny, but I was out of powdered sugar at that point. Still tasted great. My roommate was thrilled with the results as well.

Agree to skip the food processer and just mince the ginger. Used grapeseed oil - not olive. Baked well in a flexi- rubber muffin "tin" lined with papers. Excess batter made good muffinheads for breakfast.

I had some leftover fresh ginger that I wanted to use up, and read from another reviewer that they had substituted it for the crystallized ginger. This was the first time using my food processor, so once I figured out how to what I was doing, this recipe was pretty simple. I ended up substituting the ginger, lemon zest for the orange, canola oil for the olive oil, and used half whole wheat flour and mixed with half white. And they turned out better than I imagined! They were very moist (I ended up using a fork to eat mine) and my anti-health food family even had seconds. Will definitely be making these again.

Thses are good but they did not WOW me... I must admitt that I didn't makie the frosting b/c the muffins were just good... I would makew these again if the crystallized ginger wasn't so expensive ($10)...it took an entire container and don't think they are even think the ginger is a dominate flavorin them. Next time I will try with fresh grated giner...

Wow, I think these might be the best cupcakes I've ever tasted. Definitely don't skip making the frosting. I used the light variety of cream cheese. I used a bit less honey as well. And fresh ginger instead of ground.

I made these following the recipe exactly (with frosting) and they were fabulous. Very much like carrot cake. But I've also used this recipe and subbed in whole wheat flour and flax seeds for the white flour and cut down on the honey to make great muffins. I also used canola oil to save money. Good taste and still fairly health.

Yeah, the olive oil I used was much to flavorful for the muffins. The consistency was good so I'll try them again.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. I cut the oil to a quarter cup, and only coarsely chopped the crystallized ginger. I really liked biting into a chuck of ginger every few bites. I skipped the icing and served these as breakfast muffins. I took a batch to work for a team breakfast, and was still hearing rave reviews three days later. I'll definitely make them again.

These cupcakes were so good -- they taste like gingerbread. I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and substituted brown sugar and they turned out really good.

Wonderful recipe! The food procosser was broken so I just chopped the ginger. This is not overly sweet and very mild. An easy and delicious recipe.

These were very good cupcakes, but the texture was a little gooey. I didn't have ingredients for the frosting, but I think it will be worth it to run out and get them before guests come over tonight. I will probably make these again in the summer!

Baked in 8x8 pan 35 min, cut into 16. Yum! Used 1/2 cup oil, coarsely chopped ginger bits (used fork to mix), and threw in some raisins. No frosting necessary unless for guests!

These have excellent texture, and that saved mine. I left out the eggs (for a vegan freind) and they came out..okay. I had to use fresh ginger and it was so strong that even my mother (who loves ginger) had a hard time eating two. Though they are good besides, and better with frosting.

These were fail- proof! For many reasons, these should have flopped. First, I only had 1/2 c of honey, so I added 1/4 c of brown sugar. Then, the zucchini I had was rock hard, and I had to substitute half with shredded apple. Finally, I don't have a food processor, and only minced the ginger. These came out fantastic, and I am probably making them again today.

I LOVE this. I made in place of my usual zucchini bread, and the ginger is a delightful addition. I was glad to have a recipe made for olive oil, rather than just substituting it, and I really like how it worked, though I did reduce to 1/2 cup. I will definitely make this again, and though I served with optional frosting, I prefer toasted with butter.

This isnt a great recipe, just OK. There are so many wonderful ways to use ginger, it didnt really shine in these cupcakes. I also added about 2c total powdered sugar instead of the 1/2c called for in the frosting.

As a dietitian I am always looking for tasty, healtheir dessert and snack options using things like zucchini and carrots and whole grains. I actually made this for some coworkers (also all dietians) and it was a big hit. The flavors are delicious together and I highly recommend it!

I thought theses cupcakes were delicious. I modified the recipe slightly because I didn't have crystallized ginger or ground ginger. I used a tbsp of fresh grated ginger instead. Also I didn't use ginger in the icing and I thought the flavours were great. Very moist, mild, pleasing ginger taste to them. This recipe is a keeper

Because I was making these for my toddler to enjoy, I omitted ground ginger, used a bit less crys ginger than called for, increased honey to nearly 1 cup and halved oil to 1/2 cup. (I used a mix of EVOO and Canola because I thought the EVOO might be too strong.) In any case, these muffins are delicious and very moist. I will definitely make them again. Didn't bother with the frosting. I'm sure it would make them even more delicious. But they certainly don't need it.

these were very moist and yummy cupcakes or muffins (whatever the right terminology is). I actually loved, and so did the friends for whom I made them. I am not into frosting, so skipped on that. as recommended by the other reviewers, I decreased the oil to 1/2 c and increased the honey to 1c. I would recommend to skip the food processor and just mix the dry components with a fork cos the processor almost pulverized the ginger bits. and I woudl definitely chop them coarse, cos mine were too little and nothing is nicer than biting onto a ginger bit.

Just finished making these cupcakes. I tried them with and without the frosting and they are awesome both ways! I had just enough frosting and good thing for me because I don't like them too sweet. It did taste and look more like a muffin but either way they were great!! Definitely a keeper!

I actually really liked these cupcakes. But: warning! The recipe for the frosting is wrong. It requires MUCH MORE confectioner's sugar than called for (1/2 cup?). It's a typo or just an unchecked recipe. However, when I added the right amount (probably 1 & 1/2 lb) it was the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. The combo of ingredients: perfection. Another warning: friends and family didn't feel as strong about these as I did -- but who cares?

i didn't really like the flavor of these. i used yellow squash instead of zucchini & applesauce instead of the oil so not sure if that made a big difference in the taste or not. they were very moist. i would rather make pumpkin muffins instead of these.

These are awful. Cupcakes they're not. They are more like muffins that someone left the sugar out of. It is the consensus that these are not "too sweet," but I say they are not sweet enough, particularly since they are so loaded with spices that need to be mellowed and balanced with plenty of sugar. These gave me instant heartburn from just tasting a bite, and I don't remember the last time I had heartburn--probably when I was pregnant 5 years ago. I tried another bite 8 hours later, just to make sure, and the exact same thing happened, so the heartburn was definitely caused by the "cupcake". I let these go to waste rather than serving them to my family. The only thing about this recipe that I liked was the cream cheese spread, called "frosting" here. Frosting it's not, but it is tasty, and probably would be great spread on a really sweet type of muffin or maybe even a bagel.

Rating: 3
Excellent & easy. I forgo the icing and just serve still hot sliced in half with grilled Grafton Cheddar on top. My 2 year old loves these for an afternoon snack. I agree, the second time I baked these I minused one tablespoon of oil from the recipe and they were just as moist.

This was not a difficult recipe to make although it is not light. I used fat free cream cheese and light butter in the frosting and no one could tell the difference. I might try replacing the oil with applesauce next time.

These are a bit of work, and I'm generally not crazy about any recipe that requires messing with both the processor and the mixer, but the cupcakes are very good. As a bonus, they smell fantastic when baking. I agree they aren't too sweet...my tasters preferred as a breakfast muffin.

I really enjoyed these cupcakes; the cakes themselves are tender and moist, and not overly sweet, which is a nice complement to the rich cream cheese frosting - which is wonderful. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe, and found the end result to be wonderful.
