Absolutely scrumtuous!! The first batch I made I dipped in white chocolate and this last batch in dark chocolate. The chocolate and the orange complement each other. The guys at work kept making trips to my office for more!

Delicious. I put this in the oven and foung the cashews still on my board. I quickly added them on top. It turned out great. My guests raved.

This was the first biscotti recipe that I ever tried. Even given my inexperience, I could tell the recipe needed more flour. That notwithstanding, this has been a very versatile, low fat standard in my kitchen since Gourmet published it. Great with almonds, pecans, and walnuts as well as the cashews - this one is a keeper.

These cookies are delicious--light and perfect for dessert w/some fruit and coffee. As to other reviewers' comments about the dough's stickiness: yes, it is sticky, but if you use two spoons to shape the loaves and pat them down with a butter knife, you'll be fine. I used almonds instead of cashews and the cookies were delicious. Very crunchy!

I added a teaspoon of orange extract to help boost the orange flavour, added a bit of butter and increased the flour measures. Added a handful of dried cranberries and used toasted almonds ... it was good but I have a much more consistant basic biscotti base that I will continue to use.

Warning! The suggested amount of flour is off -- leaves dough gummy and unworkable. Requires about 2 3/4 c flour. I used extra orange zest and added chopped, dried apricots, cut down a bit on the cashews. Very good results. Makes about 40 biscotti, not sixty, even with the extra flour. Will perhaps add a tablespoon of butter, more zest and apricots next time.

This is the best biscotti recipe that I have made yet, I've made about 10 biscotti recipes on this site! I did substitute a lot of things, I used all whole wheat flour, and used toasted almonds instead of the cashews. I never would have noticed that there was no butter, and the whole wheat flour worked great. Definitely will make again!

I made this with more orange zest than the recipe called for and substituted almonds for the cashews. The aroma in my house while these were cooking was amazing. Unfortunately, the flavor didn't live up to the aroma. I found these kind of bland and my family didn't care for them too much either, so I took them to work. My search for new and exciting Biscotti continues!

These are nice and light, though they barely taste like orange with the recommended amount of zest. Use a tablespoon and half or even two tablespoons to give them more of an orange flavor.

These were OK. Not a lot of flavor. I used salted cashews, so maybe that was the problem. I did, however, make the red-wine macerated fruit and these were the perfect accompaniment. I just don't think they make it on their own.

I didn't like this at all. I found it bitter, I tried to make it better by drizzling some chocolate on it. That saved the cookies, but just barely.

These are OK, not great. I think the complete lack of butter gave them a different texture than most biscotti I have made. I did add more orange zest and used pistashios instead of cashews.

The dough is really sticky - but I guess that is half the fun. I used double quantities of Orange and they were fab. I also use this as the basis to all other biscotti I make. Try dried cranberries and pistachio - great for the holidays.

I thought these were great. I added two teaspoons orange flower water to give them more orange flavor. They are nice and crispy and have stayed that way. I thought it was nice to make them with cashews which I really enjoyed.

People loved these biscotti at the restaurant where I work. I had added 3/4 cup of mixed dried fruit and some cracker crumbs. I also baked at 350 degrees for 18 minutes, cooled, cut, and baked for 13 minutes more. I used pistachios and cashews. I would omit dried fruit and not chop nuts as finely next time I make. 1 tbs of orange zest made the biscotti surprisingly orangey. An overall pleasant taste received better than the traditional almond anise biscotti.

I have made biscotti many times before and this recipe was not only bland but had a really unusual unappealing texture. I would not prepare this recipe again.

My husband liked these (not loved) and my two young children loved them to snack on like cookies.

I used a food processor to stir the dough which made it easier to mix. I followed the recipe ingredient-wise but after the initial 50 mins. baking time, I baked the sliced biscotti for 15 mins. then flipped them over and baked them for an additional 15 mins. so they came out nice and crunchy. The next time I make these I would add either more orange zest or substitute Grand Marnier for the water for a stronger orange flavour instead of the egg wash which gives it a distinct eggy flavour.

Delicious. I didn't have any of the nuts suggested, so I improvised and used some walnuts that were on hand. The biscotti turned out great. I replaced the teaspoon of water in the egg wash with Grand Marnier to give the orange flavor a boost, and drizzled some on top as well, just before popping it into the oven. Great recipe-- the results suggested the biscotti had been purchased from a high end bakery.

Horror! Horror! Why did my mixture turned out to be sticky and gooey (definitely not something you can shape to form into a log.I did not goof up on the measurement. I doublechecked it again and nothing was wrong. So, What went wrong?!?

Oh so delicious and extremely easy to make. I served this at a baby shower and everybody thought that they were from a bakery.

Good biscotti, but not the best I've made. I made a bunch of "modifications" to this recipe. I ended up preparing the dough ahead of time and about a week passed before I got the chance to bake the biscotti, so I expected it to be a lost cause, but the biscotti came out remarkably well anyway-- I wouldn't exactly recommend making the dough ahead of time, but it says something that the final product was still good. I used Sucanat (evaporated cane juice, in natural foods stores) in place of the white sugar and noticed no negative effects for the additional nutrients. I added a dash of orange juice, too, to boost the orange flavor, and I rolled the dough into bigger loaves for bigger biscotti, and it worked just fine. I'd recommend drying the cut biscotti in the oven on BOTH sides, not just one as the recipe states (about 10 minutes on the first side, and 5 minutes on the other side) at a higher temperature, to give the biscotti adequate crunch.

I didn't have cashews, so I used hazelnuts. They were delicious.
