I used Jose Cuervo Oranjo, premium because I couldn't find the others and it turned out just PERFECT we ate it with skillet cooked salmon and seafood nachos, and grapes. It was delicious!

Following the previous reviewer's advice, I substituted rum for the tequila and it came out marvelous! I made this as a garnish for Vanilla Lime Flan, which made a great combination of flavors. My only regret is that I didn't cook up the entire pineapple, because my husband nibbled up most of it before I could get the dessert plates assembled!

I've cooked this a couple of times and it's worked perfectly each time. I have substituted rum for tequila, which works well, and also used some Grand Marnier with the Tequila, to make 'Baked Margherita Pineapple'. Served with lime sorbet it is delicious.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo, however I was busy so I made it and let it macerate for about 4 hours, since I had to be away from home. I baked as instructed, I set the timer, and took a nap, and it came out perfectly carmelized. I will make it again, and again.

This was an ok recipe, but eating raw pinapple soaked in the tequila would have been more rewarding. The fruit didn't really caramelize, the lime/tequila flavours were very subdued and didn't wow us. Maybe adding butter to the sugar would make it brown/caramelize better? Since the marinade smelled so tropical, I'll just forget about cooking the pineapple next time.
