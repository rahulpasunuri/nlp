After spending 3 years in Barbados I'd gotten quite used to having fishcakes as a snack with drinks. This recipe doesn't bring about any result even close to what I'm used to. It's not bad, but the flavour just isn't right. The sauce was very "raw" in flavour..I prefer a much sweeter, smoother sauce...we dumped this one in favour of good old Thousand Island dressing. I've taken my search for good ole Bajan fishcakes to AOLs members!

Pan fry these in butter just before serving... treat it as you would a crab cake. Alot less greasy that way! Great with the sauce.

It is not a good idea to fry this dish in advance. It becomes greasy and indigestible (help, get the Alka-Seltzer !). It is to be made just before serving and goes very well with before-dinner drinks as nibbles instead of boring old peanuts, tortilla chips and guacamole !!!
