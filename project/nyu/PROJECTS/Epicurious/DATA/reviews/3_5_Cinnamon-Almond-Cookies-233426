A lovely twist on a shortbread type cookie. The addition of cinnamon and almonds is a hit. We slice ours a little thicker than stated and it makes for a nice soft cookie. Would recommend making this cookie!

Agree that the cinnamon needs to be increased. Also a warning if they don't look really golden at 12 minutes resist the urge to cook much longer, 14 minutes at the most or they will be too crispy when completely cooled. Very popular.

Outrageously easy to make, but double or triple the cinnamon/spices you use. I found the spice flavor way too subtle even after adding a bit more than the recipe called for. I very much like that their sweetness is mild, not overpowering. Mostly they have a buttery, shortbread flavor. Another thing: when I tasted the cookies on the day they came out of the oven, I wasn't all that impressed. But these cookies get better after a day or two. So don't serve them right away. Give them a day, at least, after they've been baked to mellow. Then, suddenly, they become addictive. They're exactly what you want with that morning cup of tea, coffee or hot cocoa. As said in some other review, almost like a biscotti as they're so crispy.

These are great easy and QUICK, with the exception of freezer time. I love recipes that I can make with stuff I have to clear out the pantry!

I made these to go with the Mexican chocolate mousse, and they went over well. They definitely need to be on the golden side - probably 14-15 minutes if the dough is right from the fridge. I rolled them in waxed paper instead of plastic and that worked fine. Taste-wise, they're pretty subtle - good for a supporting role.

This is a delicious and fairly easy recipe! I made them as dessert for a dinner party and even made gift bags for all the couples with these cookies in them. Several couples said they arrived home with no more cookies! Every time I make these, people ask for the recipe. When I make a batch, I usually make a double batch and freeze the rest to slice up whenever I need them.

These were OK, but not great. They were easy to make, but the flavor didi not really stand out.

These were very easy to put together and tasted wonderful. I am keeping some in the freezer for quick desserts.

Delicious!!! Made it for a dinner party. Doubled the recipe and made it into a trifle layering it with the whipped cream, and ending with the whipped cream. For garnish toasted sliced almonds and grated unsweetened chocolate. With some of the cookies, I put it around the inside of the bowl,on an angle, standing on end. Put the trifle on a larger glass plate and put the rest of the cookies around it. Also, since some of our company had soy allergies, I used 3-10oz. bags of semi-sweet chocolate without the soy lecithin and almost 2-4oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate with approx. 3 drops of cinnamon oil. Would have loved to taste it with Mexican chocolate. If it tasted soooo delicious this way I know it would with the Mexican chocolate!! Will definitely make this again....and with Mexican chocolate!!!!

i agree with the previous poster. these cookies are delicious with the mexican chocolate mousse...AND without it. I also agree that the cinnamon could be bumped up a bit, but that really depends on personal preference. this is a nice dough to have in the freezer over the holidays.

These are great cookies and perfect complement to the Mexican chocolate mousse. The cookies baked nicely. The flavor is mild - so you could choose to use more cinnamon. But they're nicely subtle and a great addition to something richer just as is.
