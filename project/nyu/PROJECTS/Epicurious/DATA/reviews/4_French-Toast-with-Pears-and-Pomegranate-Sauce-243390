As stated in someone else's review, the bread gets really soggy so I would suggest using a sturdier bread such as whole grain wheat. Also, my roommate and I used all spice instead of cardamom (on accident), which turned out great! We didn't have the same problem with the sauce as some of the other reviewers here. We put the sauce on high heat for a few minutes to let it boil while stirring it, and then turned the heat lower. Good luck!

Recipe was easy and delicious. It's worth noting that not having pears and pomegranate juice on hand, I made a suace with Organes, Orange juice, brown sugar and butter - was divine. Must remove pith and seeds though. I imagine Granny Apples would work as well.

I've made this on several mornings and it is just awesome, it tastes like being on vacation. I did try it with cinnamon, it is okay, but if you have a few extra bucks and can find cardamom, it makes the dish much more lovely and exotic. I found the same thing with reducing the syrup--it takes forever! In the end I have settled for a much less syrupy quality syrup. You can wait for it to thicken as it cools, but who wants cool syrup?

I loved this recipie. I didn't have any cardamom so I subsituted cinnamon instead. The sauce took a really long time to reduce to a syrup consistency. Have to really be patient. I did a triple batch for a party and it took almost 45 min for that much syrup to reduce

There was too much cardamom in this recipe. Also, if you soak the break for 10 minutes, it's still pretty soggy - i even cooked them 4 minutes a side (1 min per side longer than suggested.) no one really cared for this recipe.

the sauce was a little sweet for me, so i might cut down on the brown sugar. also, the sauce will thicken slightly if you let it sit for a few minutes before putting over the toast. i didn't use the pom juice, but the langer's pomegranate juice. also, soaking the bread for 10 minutes was just too long for my tastes! but this is a great recipe and everyone loved it... i would just change that bit before i serve it again!

Everybody love it! I used Chinese five spice instead of cardamon. Also, I used pomagrante seeds as garnish over the sauted pears. I did not prepare the sauce.

My husband and I made this on vacation and since we have been back we have made it 3 times! This is great. I am going on a Girls Weekend Trip and I am surprising them with this for Sunday Breakfast.

Made this for weekend guests and everyone loved it. And to the reviewer shellks from wichita, ks...for such a picky eater, you better stick to "your french toast" with Sandhill Plum jelly.

I made this for me and my husband one morning and it was really good. I will say that the pom mixture never would thicken as I thought it should (like syrup), but it was so yummy that the consistency didn't matter. Would recommend to anyone as this was easy and has a great flavor.

This was delicious and very easy to make. I made it as a special birthday breakfast for my fiance and he made me promise to save the recipe!

This sounds pretty okay...I have a couple of reservations that maybe you all could help me with. I've not used cardamom with french toast. I always use cinnamon and vanilla. My family loves it, but I do not deal with cinnamon well. Is the cardamom a substitute they could deal with, too? Pom. juice....The only time I've ever had it was a tasting at a Sam's club. It was horrible. I spit it back into the little cup and headed for a water fountain. I see teas and juices with pom. juice in it and am scared to try it. The "Naked Juice" sounds great, but I'm not paying that much for something that taste like the dirt- filled tartness of the pom. juice. I guess my question is, is there a good combination of juices to use here? Or would I just need to add more sweetener? I'm not a fan of sugar or maple syrup. I always eat my french toast with Sandhill Plum jelly--minus the cinnamon! YUM!

Never have I been so annoyed on this site as when I read mkatz2m's review. I do not care if he/she would make this recipe as written. This is a delicious treat, deserves 4 forks.

I would not make this as written. It is extremely unhealthy with the bad kind of fat.

I would give it 5 forks if that was an option. This was so delicious. I loved every bite. I used cranberry-pomegranate juice. The cardamom was divine.

Best french toast ever! I agree with the previous cook, you can use more bread, there is enough sauce.

We loved the flavours of this dish - especially the sauce - and will definitely make this again. I had a large amount of leftover sauce though, so next time I would either use more bread or would make half the amount of sauce. This would be great with other fruit as well.
