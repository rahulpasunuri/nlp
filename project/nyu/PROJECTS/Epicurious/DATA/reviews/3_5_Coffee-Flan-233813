If anyone could tell me where I went wrong with this, I'd be ever so grateful: Made the recipe as written, but after an hour and 45 minutes, it still hadn't set. At all. I"m sure it was my error but can't figure out how I went wrong.

The texture of this flan was excellent, the flavor very good. My only complaint would be that the caramel was a little too liquidy... but I'll work on that the next time I make it. My roommates fought over the leftovers!

I'm a flan lover and this one is the best. Made exactly as written. It fed 12 people who were full from dinner with a little bit left over for the next day.

This is a great recipe, but as others have commented, a huge amount. Here are proportions worked out for a small (9 ounce) can of condensed milk, and using mostly egg yolks rather than whole eggs to reduce the "eggy" flavor a bit. It still serves 6 to 8! 1/2 cup sugar for the caramel 2/1/2 cups whole milk (or 2 cups skim and 1/2 cup heavy cream), warmed in microwave. 3 tsp. espresso powder 1 9-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 1 egg and 4 egg yolks 1/2 tsp. vanilla pinch of salt Dissolve the espresso powder in warmed milk. Mix well with remaining ingredients and pour through a fine strainer into prepared baking dish -- no need to use blender.

Great recipes! It is a large recipes though, so be prepared to halve the ingredients, especially the vanilla, if you don't need too much flan. I also used instant espresso and it was great! Easy to make too!

I used 2 tsp of instant expresso and 2 tsp of powdered dutch chocolate. It was wonderful. Nice texture and delicious flavor - not overly sweet and very silky (yum). I did not try the instant coffee granules - didn't sound as appealing to me. Also, This is a huge recp. I served this in individual servings (Pyrex 4oz) I made 8 and probably threw 4 more away.

Awesome! So easy to make and eat. I didn't have instant-coffee granules, so instead I used instant espresso powder. This produced a nice coffee flavor, not nuanced nor overly assertive, that we enjoyed.

Really really really good! The only change I made was substituting 2 tsp. instant espresso for the coffee because that's what I had. Silky smooth texture, great flavor, a winner all around.

This was delicious. I took it to a party for dessert and everyone loved it, even my friend who normally doesn't like flan, and another guest who is not a fan of coffee. It took a little longer to cook than the recipe specified.

Incredibly easy - it is basically divided into three easy steps: carmelize the sugar, blend remaining ingredients and bake in a hot water bath. This was the first time attempting a flan recipe and thankfully was met with very high praise from family and friends. This will be a recipe I will try again and again.
