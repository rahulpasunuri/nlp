Thought this was awfully bland, and the mix of sherry and soy sauce was not good together. Next time, I'll remember to read the reviews before I decide to make something new.

I practically grew up on this dish, my good friends own a chinese resturant made excelent sesame chicken. I was not very happy with this recipe but i will try again, adding afew things here and there.

This lacked the bold flavor I expect from Chinese dishes, so I was disappointed. I served it with soy sauce and chili paste with garlic to kick it up.

As an Asian dish, I was disappointed in this. The sauce of sherry with soya didn't really mix well, along with the broth.

At first glance, I thought this would be bland, but it was delicious! I "kicked it up a notch" by using about 1 Tbsp of garlic chile sauce, and extra garlic and scallions. It was terrific!

Easy and tasty! I forgot the Water Chestnuts and I used fresh bean spouts instead of canned. I think it actually serves 2 or 3 rather than 4 so I will double it next time.

Excellent version of Sesame Chicken. Easy to prepare and cook. And so delicious. I'm sharing this recipe with all of my friends. Just adjust the chili paste for more or less spicy.
