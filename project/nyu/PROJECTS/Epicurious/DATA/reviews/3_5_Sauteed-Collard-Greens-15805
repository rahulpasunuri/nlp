I wanted to make collards differently for my NEW YEARS DAY family meal; so I tried this recipe out. I was amazed. This is so good, better than the way I usually fix it. The only thing I did differently was I used a kitchen towel to squeeze out excess water before sautéing and it turned out beautifully. I'm fixing collards this way for now on!!

Having never cooked or eaten collard greens, I decided to follow this recipe. However, after 6 minutes, the collards were tender and still bright green so I stopped boiling them and continued on with the recipe. It is WONDERFUL and I will use collards as a substitute for spinach any time.

Delicious. Collards are not very popular here, so I had no clue how to cook them. I boiled them for almost 10 minutes (instead of 15), substituted vegan margarine for butter, and voila. They were amazing. Will make again.

Delicious! I've never liked collard greens (I have only ever had them with tons of bacon grease). Finally! A healthy, yummy alternative! A staple for me now, especially since I always get collards in my CSA box. (Note: I also tried a vegan version but it really did not come out as well, the greens started to wither. Next time I will reduce the heat)

These are the most delicious collard greens. I followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing.

I made this pretty much as written, except that I had about half the amount and as others suggested, boiled the greens for a little less than 10 minutes. They were melt-in-your-mouth tender and totally delicious. I have shared this with a couple friends who were looking for a healthy way to cook collard greens. This certainly fits the bill!

Wow - shockingly great! I could not believe how I loved this. I did not even add the lemon. I ate the whole thing myself. I did boil the greens for the whole 15 min and they did not turn green. It made them very tender.

I wish my mother was still alive to tell her I prepared and LOVED this recipe! I have been a notoriously finicky eater since childhood and still would have turned up my nose at collard greens if I had not just planted some in my garden. (There's not much at the nursery in January, and I was desperate to plant something, despite never having tasted collards.) I wish I had made more of this for dinner!

With a few modifications, this recipe was quick and delicious. Instead of boiling, we blanched the greens for 2 minutes. We also used meyer lemon olive oil instead of adding lemon juice at the end. The greens were wonderful paired with "buttery cornbread" epicurious recipe and black eyed peas.

Our first time eating collard greens and we will be cooking them regularly after this. I didn't read all the reviews first, and still enjoyed them. Next time I will try less boiling. The KISS theory obviously works with collards!

I agree with previous reviewers - DO NOT boil for the recommended 15 minutes! You will have brown collard greens and green water. I boiled mine for 6 minutes and even that was a little much for my taste. Otherwise? This stuff is amazing! Also, I ramped up the garlic (haha, no pun intended!) and was not disappointed. I will totally make this again, despite having to de-stem the collards (maybe I won't next time?).

Definately don't boil for more than 5-7 minutes! I added a bit of cajun seasoning instead of the lemon and it was delicious.

I meant to give this 2 forks not four in my review previous to this one, I can't seem to change it now that I have submited it, sorry.

This was a 'good' but not great. I would make it again. It's a healthy side and quick to make. I only give it a 'good' because it is not very exciting.

Easy and much healthier way to prepare collards. Absolutely delicious! Served with Pesto Stuffed Chicken.

This is tasty but my greens turned out pretty darn soggy from the 15 minutes of boiling. I shortened it to 5 minutes this last time and I found them to be crisp yet cooked through. After sauteing they were perfect.

Delicious! I made for New Years, using the recipe as shown and added Chipole Pepper Flakes to the olive oil for a nice smokey spice.

Not only is this more nutritious than a traditional preparation, it's quite good too. I've shared this recipe with several family members already. If you want some of that good pork flavor, just substitute rendered pork fat for the olive oil and pepper sauce for the lemon juice.

Delicious. Doubled the garlic, skipped the lemon. Even the kids wanted seconds. I will have to double the recipe next time.

I was raised in the south where I was subjected to traditionally cooked greens at a very young age. Just the smell of greens made me gag most of my life. So, I was very skeptical trying this recipe. What a pleasant suprise! I found 15 minutes to be the perfect amount cooking time.

Super easy but still excellent!! I didn't boil the greens because I like to retain the vitamins, and it still finished well. Perfect side dish.

This was very good and a pleasant change from the usual way of cooking collards. The only change I might make is to put a dried chili pepper in the water for the pre-cooking of the collards.

This dish was quick and tasty. I would like to try traditional long-cooked southern greens, but right now didn't want the fat or salt from the ham, and didn't have the time. 15 mins. of boiling was plenty, and no need to remove the center rib from the collards -- saves time. My husband and I had this with pan-fried walleye. I'l like to try it with other types of greens (mustard, turnip) to see how the flavors differ. Economical, too!

After eating collard greens at Shirley's Diner just outside St Pete, I began my hunt for the recipe and this is the closest I've come! Shirley probably boils hers a bit longer, but this recipe is just fine as is. Yum! It's so simple that you might think there's nothing special here, but there is!! I've made it 6 or 7 times already.

I was skeptical, because I always like my greens (and veggies in general) very crisp. These collards retained their texture nicely and were extremely flavorful. I would make these again anytime!

These were simple and tasty - I could have eaten the whole recipe, but I had to share with guests!

I feel kind of silly giving 4 forks to a simple collard greens recipe but sometimes simple is best. I'm new to collard greens and have made this recipe twice. The first time I boiled the greens longer as suggested in some of the other reviews and thought the greens were pretty dreary and bland. The second time I followed the recipe exactly and oh the flavor! The greens were perfectly tender bit still had a bit of texture which I loved, and had a wonderful flavor. I served this recipe for a dinner party and by the time I served everyone and had a chance to sit down, I noticed that the gentleman next to me didn't have any on his plate and I thought I had forgotten to serve him some collard greens. He replied that they were so good he ate the whole serving before I had a chance to sit down!

This was my first time preaparing and eating collards, and i was thoroughly impressed. The simple garlic and lemon juice method brought out and complimented the vegetable flavour perfectly.

Rating: 4
The best collard recipe I've found. I agree that it could use more garlic. I've even used garlic powder along with the cloves. I haven't used the lemon juice yet but the greens are still very tasty without it.

Fabulous! These are some of the best collard greens I've ever had. A fantastic vegetarian recipe!

This recipe works well if you steam the collards for 12 minutes then saute it in lots of garlic for 5 more minutes. Add a little pepper you will enjoy it this way.

I agree that the greens require more than 15 minutes of cooking. 20 minutes was good. I like this cooking method. It cooks the greens through and they stay tender. I may try it with kale or brocolli rabe.

This is the perfect recipe for collard greens. I did, however, boil them for about 25 minutes and they were still not very soft. I found this to be the perfect texture. I have a new vegetable side dish!!!!!

I have had collard greens cooked many different ways in the past, usually boiled until they are very tender so I was a bit apprehensive about trying this receipe. My family and I were pleasantly surprised. This ones a keeper.
