I made a lot of modifications so I feel uncomfortable rating this recipe, but thought I'd share my story. I added pancetta, artichoke hearts, capers and mushrooms. The sauce tasted great with pasta and was very light. Would be great for summer. It was good. Not great. May tinker around with it one more time, but not something I'd turn to again and again.

The turkey cutlets were tough. I won't make it again.

We tried this recipe, following the instructions except we added more oil as 2 tsp. seemed like a minimal amount of oil. The overall taste was nothing to write home about. All in all, a disappointing recipe. We will not try it again.

My husband and I loved this dish. Didn't give it 4 forks because I don't believe that it is "beyond compare", but it was truly delicious and easy. I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used canned and it was still great. I will definitly make this again!

I doubled the recipe and turned this into a stew-type dish (I didn't want to spend any time pounding the meat!) by dusting the meat pieces in flour and browning them, then after deglazing with the wine, added 2 cups of turkey stock and a slurry; added the basil right before serving and also tossed in some artichoke hearts. It didn't need quite so much stock, but I'll make it again.

Not only did it taste good but it was a eye pleasing dish too. I served it with pasta flavored with lemon zest, lemon juice chopped chives and parmesean cheese. I would definately serve this for a company meal

I followed this recipe with no substitutions and we felt that it needed something to give it more flavor. Next time I'll add a few red pepper flakes and some good olives. Otherwise it was an easy, healthy recipe.

This is a very tasty one pan dish. I used chicken instead of turkey. I would have liked more of a sauce. Next time, I will double the liquid ingredients to make more sauce.
