My sister and I made this the day before for Thanksgiving, but accidentally fully cooked the potatoes in the first boiling. Not a problem, though! We drained & cooled, added about 1/3 cup whiskey to the syrup, put all the ingredients together to "marinade", and stored overnight in the fridge. Then we heated it in the oven for the feast. It was delicious, and will grace my Christmas table.

I made these yesterday for T-giving and they were pretty good, but I over cooked the sweet potatoes so they got pretty mushy. I have a lot of leftovers and I think I might just puree them and then heat it up. It was good, but next time, I'll watch how soft they get while boiling. Tasty though!

As a caterer I have made this dish on several occasions, to great reviews, even converting some long time haters of the sweet potato.

I love this recipe! I made it in 1999 when it was published and it has been made every year since (Thanksgiving is usually at my mom's and she started using the recipe too - rare for her to want one of MY recipes instead of her own).

Loved this dish, will definitly make again. Was a nice change of pace from the usual sweet potato recipes. Not too sweet, not too tart.

I have made this almost every year for the past 3 years and it is always a big hit! Just loggin on to print it again for tomorrow. I like it when everything has a chance to sit together and the potatoes get some really good flavor to them.

i've made this every year since pulling it out of the magazine when first published. i use real vermont maple syrup instead of brown sugar, and adjust the cider amount to help compensate for the extra liquid. i use organic foods to make this dish... cider, sweet potatoes, butter, green onions... i believe that this is what creates the fantastic flavor of this dish. and, as with most comfort foods, it's much better the next day. it's requested every thanksgiving!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and am making it again by popular demand. The only thing I did was add a bit of chipotle chile to give it a kick.

I have made this recipe so many times I have lost count. I love the fact that it is done on the stove top - oven space is precious in my house. I get rave reviews from everyone who has tried it.

I made this last night to accompany a pork chop entree for my husband and I. We rated it "just okay". Not very flavorful and not worth a repeat.

Me being an amateur cook, this recipie was perfect for my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner. It was easy, fast, looked beautiful, and tasted great. I reduced the amount of sugar slightly and added a little orange juice for a bite. The juice and cranberries complemented the potatoes so well, and the warm feeling it left me stayed with me. It's definitely a repeat!

I really liked these, even though mine were a little mushy due to a turkey that refused to get done on time. I added some leftover applejack brandy and reduced it with the sauce. My whole family loved it.

Great dish for us on Christmas with our ham. Very nice flavor and so easy to prepare. We are big fans of sweet potatoes in almost any way and the cranberries make it festive too. So this will be a favorite and regular item for us.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this dish was way too sweet. I served it at Thanksgiving and no one would eat it. next time it'll be simple, baked sweet potatoes with unsalted butter at my table!

This is not one of those candy sweet recipes which always seemed too sweet and rich for our group. The other great thing is how easy it was to prepare. Definately a bonus.

A good, slightly different, sweet potato recipe. And not sickeningly sweet like so many recipes. Don't get me wrong. The cider and brown sugar definitely add sweetness. But I didn't feel like I needed to brush my teeth afterwards!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was enjoyed by all. As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this dish was very flavorful without being too sweet.

This is an excellent recipe -- not too sweet, great flavors! Take note of the tip to boil potatoes a day ahead, it saves time on The day, as well as saves oven space by finishing them on top of the stove. Highly recommended!
