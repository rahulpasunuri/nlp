Yummy and super easy. Had fresh hedgehogs and marsala instead of sherry. Also, I didn't have any beef broth only chicken stock, so I seared my flank steak in skillet first then added the ingredients for the sauce and scraped up the meat bits for the beef flavor. Delish! Will definitely make this one again.

Saute onions and garlic on medium high for 15 minutes? Are you out of your mind?

I have made this as written which was great and have made adjustments as well. I think it is a really good base. This time I used vermouth b/c I didn't have Marsala, I used shallots and garlic minus onion and bellas and white shrooms and skipped porcini. Good as written and good to play with!

Terrific sauce. Used mixed fresh wild mushrooms sauteed a bit instead of porcini. Not THE best sauce we've had but very, very good.

Cook from Cumming ,GA Great minds think a like. I was looking for a recipe with mushrooms to serve with polenta! When I saw the flour, I questioned it...thanks for the confirmation! Sounds like this could be a winner.

This was AWESOME. I made a roasted pork tenderloin and served this on top. We had barley pilaf on the side and used extra sauce to pour over top. Will defnitely make again.

Amazing. This tastes restaurant quality. I will make this again, many times.

Excellent recipe! Wonderful on baked potatoes, bangers and mash, chicken, or even noodles. Use fresh baby portabella mushrooms to speed up the process.

A terrific recipe, easy to double. I used a combination of dried shiitakes and porcinis, and fresh criminis and the sauce was great over pasta. Next morning, we reheated the leftover sauce and put a few tablespoons over scrambled eggs, divine!

Delicious sauce! I was looking for a sauce to make with morels and this worked out very well. I substituted the porcini with morels and served it over pan-fried pork cutlets. This sauce would be great made with any mushrooms. Definitely a keeper and fun experimenting with unfamiliar mushrooms.

Absolutely amazing! as everyone said, intense, rich, earthy flavours. beautiful. i didn't have marsala, so used 1:1 dry vermouth and port as a subsitute, along with the white wine. wouldn't change a thing.

Gets raves every time I make it. This sauce is almost unbelievably tasty. I've made it with the dried porcinis and with dried shitakes -- it's delicious either way.

I didn't have Marsala, so I used sherry. And because my family is finicky about rosemary, I improvised with sweet basil, oregano and parsley. I served it over veal scallopine seasoned with only a pinch of salt and cracked black pepper. It was a hit.

Wow, this was very good and easy. Served it over a pork loin roast. The only modification I made to the dish was to use a mushroom broth (Better than Buillion makes a good one). I think it really enhances the mushroom flavor.

Wow! Intense flavor . . . served with leg-of-lamb. Followed recipe, however, I found the sauce thicker than preferred. I will admit flour next time. I need to try this with polenta.

Cook from Olema, CA, how can you possibly give this dish 2 forks when you did not follow the list of ingrediets? In the future please follow a recipe as written before you give it an unfair review.

Simple to make and very tasty; excellent over grilled steak.

This is a great sauce for steaks but it did not go so well with roast chicken.

this was just sort of mediocre, but i think it's because I used sweet marsala and the wine wasn't very dry either. The flavor was wonderful but it just came out too sweet. I served it with some soft polenta that I cooked with milk which made the polenta sweet s the whole dish overall was too sweet. I will make it again but with dry marsala and dry wine. I also used mushroom broth since we are vegetarian. Next time I may try it over pasta or in risoto and may add a touch of salt. The flavors were really intese though, and I bet this dish is WONDERFUL when done properly. I hate to give it two forks, but when I make it again, i'll return to re-rate it. Happy cooking!

Excellent rich sauce. We served to a group of twelve for new years eve and it saved a rather boring prok loin! People raved, and I will definately make this again.

If you like intense, rich mushroom flavor, then this recipe is for you! I served this over soft polenta and it was delicious! Tonight, it's being paired with grilled NY strip steaks. Can't wait!

I have made this dish again and again! My husband doesn't like Rosemary - so I used Thyme. There are so many unusual and tasty fresh mushrooms available in the market today - I have tried several. They are all wonderful!!! This sauce works well with beef, veal and chicken.

Fantastic! Served this with grilled Chateaubriand, but it would enhance almost any type of meat, even chicken or pork. Even my boyfriend who describes himself as "not a sauce person" couldn't get enough.

the absolute ultimate sauce to go with fine cuts of beef or lamb. We make it with a pesto mustard crusted rack of lamb and it is just a sensational match. Look no further!

This the most hearty and flavorful mushroom sauce I have tasted. I will definitely make this over and over again!

I used a combo of shitake, oyster and porcini & portabella (all fresh). It was extremely ugly looking but all 12 dinner guests loved it.

One of the best mushroom sauces I have tried.

The best mushroom sauce I have made. Served over an herbed pork tenderloin, simply the best! Also used both porcini and shitake mushrooms. It will become a staple to use w/ pork, chicken or steak.

I used a giant portobello mushroom instead of porcini. The sauce turned out incredible! Rave reviews from 3 picky eaters.

I tried this recipe with the shitakes that I had at home. It rivals the best restaurant sauces for steak that I have had. I did double the recipe and thus it took about 1-1.25 hours to make but it was worth the effort.

I have been making "mushroom sauces" forever, and this is the best I've tasted. I must admit I did make some changes; I didn't have the porcinis so I used dried shiitakes and also added fresh chopped portabellos. It was fabulous! Even my mother, who doesn't really care for mushrooms had seconds.

Outstanding, and not all that tough. Wanted a good mushroom sauce to go with my husband's grilled standing rib roast and this fit the bill! Had it with the garlic-herbed mashed potatoes and it all went very well together. I did make a few changes, although I'm sure the recipee is fine as is. I mixed the porcini's with dried oyster mushrooms and added fresh button mushrooms. I didn't have fresh rosemary, but dried worked fine. A keeper.
