I was disappointed with the flavoring of the ribs. The spiciness was overwhelming -- I would definitely cut down on the chili sauce to 1 tablespoon.

This was a big hit and I have done the ribs in advance and the sauce and frozen them to have on hand. A definite hit!

I would make this again. It was easy and very tasty. I made it exactly according to the recipe.
