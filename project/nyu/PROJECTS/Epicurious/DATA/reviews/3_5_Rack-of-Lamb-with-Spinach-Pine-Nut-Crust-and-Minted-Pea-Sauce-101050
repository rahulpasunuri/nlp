Couldn't have been more pleased with the results. Super fantastic! Made our Easter dinner! The only odd thing was that the crust mixture was twice the amount needed.

This is an outstanding dish that makes a beautiful presentation. It was surprisingly easy to prepare, too. And the sauce that accompanies it is sublime.

While this was very tasty, my crumb topping fell off while slicing the chops, so I did not feel it was worth all the effort of making the topping. The minted pea sauce was a hit and so easy.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it! Tip: If you make the crust a day ahead, make sure it doesn't dry out in the refrigerator.

Just one word "Amazing". The preparation was very easy and it came out delicious. I served it for Easter and would definately serve it again. It also re-heated very well the next couple of days.
