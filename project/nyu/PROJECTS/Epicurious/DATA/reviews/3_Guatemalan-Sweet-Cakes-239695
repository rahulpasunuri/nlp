These quezadillas are street foods also. They are a regional food that is very popular mostly in the Zacapa area, not Guatemala City. This may be the reason why the other reviewer may not know about them (though it is hard to think a Guatemalan would not know this!). The quezadillas are delicious especially when they are steaming hot. The rice fluor makes a difference in the taste and it is what distinguishes them. I wish I knew where to find it in the US. As a Guatemalan, I am glad to see our recipes making their way into the US consciousness as Guatemalan recipes, not Mexican. By the way, there is also a recipe for Guatemalan Corn Bread. This version is very moist, almost but not quite like a cake. It is simply delicious.

I've never had these before so I was a little unsure of what they'd wind up tasting like. They wound up tasting kind of like a sweet cornbread, which was nice since I was taking them to a gathering of Guatemalan adoptive families... the kids gobbled them up. Full disclosure: I used regular self-rising flour and shredded cheddar cheese.

Made these. Extremely easy. Big hit at our South American EMBABY Dinner Club. Expected it to be cheesy, which it wasn't.

I'm also Guatemalan and I know for a fact that these sweet cake, quesadillas, are incredibly popular in the capital and the Zacapa region. I'm so glad they suggested farmer's cheese. It really is the closest thing to fresh Guatemalan cheese here in the states. Kudos on the recipe!
