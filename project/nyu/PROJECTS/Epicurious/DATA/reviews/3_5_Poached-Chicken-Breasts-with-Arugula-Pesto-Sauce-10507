Thanks to the reviews I also added half basil/half arugula and it was still a bit too bitter although my boyfriend LOVED it. It's now one of his favorite recipes. I also found the chicken a bit too dry, but most likely because I used halved chicken breasts, not full. Will definitely do this one again.

I made only the pesto from this recipe. Based on other reviews, I added some basil (it was about 1 cup basil and 2 cups arugula). I think it has a wonderful flavor and both the basil and arugula flavors really come through. So easy to make and everyone really enjoyed it. Not bitter at all! Definitely a keeper!

Cutting the Arugula in 1/2 and adding two bunches of Basil - helps on the bitterness factor. Definitely add about 1 to 2 teaspoons of sugar. Highly recommend using chicken stock instead of hot water to "make sauce". Finally - when you're poaching the chicken - throw a leek, 1/2 carrot and 1 stalk of celery (all chopped up into uniform pieces) and use 1/2 bottle of white and chicken stock and h20 to poach the chicken. You'd be surprised how much that adds to the poach.

I made the sauce with slivered almonds instead and added a dice of ginger. Very good but I agree it was a bit too strong on the taste. The chicken breast came out perfect.

I think the pesto could use a dash of sugar, but otherwise, it was very tasty. I made roasted seassoned new potatoes to go along with it, and put some of the pesto on those. Very very good. Very easy to make

Terrible. bitter.

This was an interesting dish, perhaps a little too strong on the arugula. I would try it again. Also, the poached chicken breasts are nicer whole.

What a great quick to prepare recipe. I upped the chicken broth to 2 cans (about 3 2/3 cups) and added white wine for the balance. The pesto recipe alone is a keeper. We had leftover breasts on garlic bread with the pesto spread. Yeah baby! that's what I'm talking about!! Highly Recommended

Very simple receipe that I made in the afternoon as a sandwich. Just smeared the arugula sauce on some toast slices, added some tomatoes, the chicken and a dab of chicken broth... badda bing baddo boom and presto! The sauce was a little strong and nutty as Cook from SF said, but I added an extra tang of fresh lemon juice which made it really fantastic. Would highly recommend adding just a little for flavor to zest up and lighten the flavors.

Needed a recipe for some leftover basil and parsley pesto sauce. The poached chicken breasts were perfect. I will try the arugula pesto next time.

Wonderful, wonderful, and again, wonderful. This works well as a chicken and sauce dish, or you can skip the chicken and serve the arugula pesto on angel hair pasta. Delicious! A great way to use the arugula that seems to have sprung up overnight in our garden.

I've been dieting and eating a lot of poached chicken. The peppery taste of the arugula was delicious with the mild chicken. A real keeper!

We didn't love it - the sauce was overpowering. You need to really, really love arugula to like this dish.

I love rocket/arugula, and although I haven't yet made the recipe, I can rate it by just reading it. The rocket pesto is a brilliant idea, but I would definitely flatten the breasts with a mallet first, and if I decided to poach, not use so much liquid. This can draw out too much flavour. In fact, I'd prefer to lightly fry the (flattened) fillets. As I have lots of arugula (grows like a weed) I''d definitely use this recipe.

I like the idea of arrugula instead of the traditional basil as always used. It gives the pesto a different twist.Good job!
