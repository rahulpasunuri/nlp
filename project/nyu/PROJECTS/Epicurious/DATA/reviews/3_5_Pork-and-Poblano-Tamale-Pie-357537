Delicious result, but takes 3-4 hours to make (much of which is active time or occasional stirring of the pot). Brown the pork and the other vegetables while roasting the peppers to cut down on total cooking time.

I followed this recipe to the letter, without any substitutions whatsoever, but I really didn't like the taste, and neither did anyone else in my family. The filling is essentially a chili verde, and we like chili verde, just not this version. It wasn't horrible, but I don't think any of us will want to eat the leftovers, and I don't plan to make this recipe again.

This sounded good, and was better than I expected. I didn't bother roasting the mix of peppers, I just used some roasted red peppers from a jar I had. It was delicious!

Too much work. wa wa waaaaaa. Debby Downer on this one.

Very tasty, but probably not worth the amount of work involved. It took me an hour alone to char, steam, skin, seed, and chop the peppers. It's also not a terribly pretty dish, the crust has a dull rusty color. If you do make this, give yourself a lot of time to prepare everything.

Well worth the trouble! Hubby charred the chiles and the red (not green) pepper to perfection. I made the filling using ground pork shoulder and my own tomatillo salsa. Made the crust tonight with Bob's Red Mill corn meal and served the dish to good friends. We are all unanimous in voting this four forks.

I made this for the first time yesterday and next time I would do it in two stages, making the pork filling one day and then the assembly/cornmeal topping the next. It was excellent!

Molly Steven"s name alone on a recipe gives me confidence that the outcome will be delicious...This Tamale Pie was no exception! I've tried many versions of tamale pie. James Beard's 'Great Tamale Pie' has been my favorite, but now it's a distant second to Molly's Pablano Tamale Pie. MOST DELICIOUS! I'm not sure about the presentation in a cast iron skillet. Next time I will go back to my "red wing" pottery. My husband loved everything about Molly's recipe, including the corn bread topping. (Bob's Red Mill stone ground cornmeal) Fanny Farmers corn meal topping is probably STILL my favorite. Her addition of 1/2 cup butter adds magic...even if it does take another 40 minutes to cook! Personally I would not change a thing about the filling. My husband would include olives.

Really great recipe, not as much work as some of the other reviewers make it sound like. Takes awhile but not all constant attention. I simmered the pork for only and hour and it was great. Next time I might throw some black beans in. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was great, my family ate all of the leftovers in just two days. The filling was tasty, the pork gets really tender and I liked the spice from the jalepeno. The cornbread topping is amazing! I couldn't find the specific cut of pork specified by the recipe so I just bought some cheaper pork loin and cubed it. Worked great!

An excellent recipe. Very flavorful and easy to follow. Family loved the dish and everyone requested for it to be made again in the near future.

This recipe is aggravating, as it's more complicated than it needs to be. But the result is really very good. I used pork shoulder instead of the recommended spare ribs, and 6 roasted poblanos rather then 4+1 bell pepper (?). And instead of store bought (seemed like a sin) salsa verde I used 2 chopped tomatillos with the juice of half a lime. The dinner companion said WOW 21 times - no lie I counted. Do finish in a cast iron skillet, as that makes a difference. Leave yourself 5 hours, and go for it. I've since made tamales using this recipe for filling and dough, with the same WOW result.

The best part of this recipe is the fact it's a great way to use leftover pork in place of the ribs. Second best part is the prep time is cut down even more if you use spices already ground and canned green chilies.

I loved this recipie! I doubled the jalapeno, and the heat was just right. I also ended up using a shot of tequila to deglaze the pan instead of chicken stock (I had it on hand). There is a lot of work involved, but it made a great Sunday dinner! This one is going in my favorites.

This was fantastic. I made it for a my husband and a couple of friends and everyone raved about it. I converted it to be vegetarian by using 8 oz of beef-style seitan and a few cups of black beans in lieu of the pork. Based on the other reviews about it needing more spice, I put some of the jalapeno seeds in the dish. I could have left them out - my poblanos had enough heat to spice the dish nicely. I cut down on the cooking time for the filling by sauteeing the onion and seitan (which of course didn't need further cooking) together, and then simmered all of the remaining filling ingredients for about half an hour.

This recipe turned our really, really tasty, and all the guys at dinner raved about it. I had a couple modifications that really helped cut down on the prep time-- Instead of simmering the filling and then cooking the cornbread on top, I cooked the cornbread separate in a pie pan (9in worked perfectly) at the same time as I simmered, then dumped it on top of the filling after everything was done. The cornbread took only 20 min to cook in the pie pan, and I only simmered the pork for about 1hr 15min total, as opposed to 1hr 45min. Also, I used a red pepper instead of green (had it in my fridge), which turned out great because it added color and a little sweetness. Lastly, I think its important to use GOOD salsa verde (I like Herdez) with a little kick...

Yum! It was really good. Don't be afraid to enhance the spiciness--I'm usually deliberately careless about letting some chili seeds remain in. I was heavy-handed with the jalapenos, and I substituted anaheim chilies for the bell pepper, which is pretty much habit for me. BUT. A lot of work. I'll definitely make it again, but it will be when I'm in the mood for a cooking project.

Labor Intensive - yes! I found the dish to be quite tasty. There was a ton of filling with my preparation and felt the peppers (green and poblano) were a nice touch. There really is nothing I would change to make this recipe better. The Cornbread Topping was fabulous. I would definitely make this dish again - even though it does take quite a bit of time (it is not a weekday-after work-dish).

This was good, but probably not good enough to rate the amount of effort that went into it. The recipe also makes a fairly scanty amount of filling; I had extra pork ribs and doubled the recipe, intending to freeze half for later, but I wound up using the entire amount. It fed five with none left over.

Okay, if a little bland and pretty labor intensive. Needs more heat. I agree that the green pepper, in addition to the poblano peppers, can be omitted as it brings nothing special to the mix. The cornbread topping was quite good.

My wife made this for me tonight, and we all loved it. New favorite, can't wait to make it again.

the whole time i was eating this, i was thinking it would be so much better with carnitas, than chunks of pork. i would think that if you take the time to make carnitas, then you could cut down on the simmer time. to me the green bell pepper adds nothing, next time i'll just add another poblano. and if i'm going to take the time to make carnitas, then i'm also going to make my own salsa verde. very tasty and comforting on a cold winter night.

Time consuming but incredibly tasty - this dish has so much flavor and my family devoured it. I followed the recipe exactly, with only one exception: after adding the corn puree & peppers to the pork, I only simmered for about 45 minutes (I think the filling would have dried out too much if I left it on the heat longer). It came out perfectly and the pork was very tender. Will definitely make again.
