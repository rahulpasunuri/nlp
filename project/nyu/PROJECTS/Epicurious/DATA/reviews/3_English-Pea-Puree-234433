Ohhhh gosh! I should've known it's English. How do you serve this muck.... on the Union Jack? Nevertheless this pre-digested dish tasted 3 forks worth but you cannot feed it to people who take cuisine to an art form...like the Japanese. It was tasty with Foccacia bread a fusion...British and Italian.

Pureed peas never sounded good to me, but we were looking for a new way to prepare vegetables. This recipe was an instant hit! Delicious and very attractive on the plate. So easy to fix. We served it with a Balsamic glazed trout and it was was very good combo. This recipe will also go nicely with lamb or beef. We'll definately do it again.

I used frozen peas - not sure if that affected the texture as it made the cooking time a little longer. Instead of removing the mint springs, I sauteed 4 springs of mint, removing the stems, and subsituted a pinch of chili flakes . Then at the end, I added another tbs of butter and a splash of cream to smooth out the texture. A touch of lemon juice brightened it up. Who knew baby food could taste this good?
