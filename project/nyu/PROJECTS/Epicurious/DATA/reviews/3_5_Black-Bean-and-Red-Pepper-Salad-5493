This is definitely a keeper, although I made a couple of changes due to necessity. I had no oranges so I used lemon zest and I used 5 or 6 cloves of roasted garlic instead of fresh... WOW!I also doubled the recipe and used a can of red beans with the black beans. The lemon zest really gives it a fresh light flavor.

Perfect summer salad. I paired it with the Fresh Tuna Tacos on this site. Added fresh lime juice for a little more pop and fresh cooked corn.

Very fresh tasting and healthy side dish. I squeezed some fresh orange juice in as well, a nice contrast to the vinegar. Also added a bit more olive oil. Served with apricot-mustard glazed chicken for a nice summer meal.

I added just a dash of cinnamon and about a half tsp. of cumin - the cinnamon flavor was awesome.

What a colorful salad. I added two ears of fresh corn to the mix and a minced jalapeno pepper. I found that the fresh basil and orange peel made all the difference. Makes for a nice vegetarian dinner when pared with yellow rice, flour tortillas and a dollop of sour cream. The salad did require more oil and vinegar, but that's easy to adjust.

One of my summer staples - it's even better if you add fresh corn when it's in season.

This was fast, easy, pretty, healthy and tasty. You can't ask a whole lot more of a salad than that!

I,ve been serving this since it was printed and really enjoy it. Imagine my surprise to be served this same salad in a small restaurant in Nevada.

Very fast and easy salad. Served with crab fritters. Used leftovers for quesadillas the next night, mixed in some cheese, great!

A very easy dish to serve at summer barbecues. Be sure to double it, as left- overs vanish. The orange makes it.
