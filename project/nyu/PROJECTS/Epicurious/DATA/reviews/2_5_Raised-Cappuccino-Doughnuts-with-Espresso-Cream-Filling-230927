I much prefer the Warm Miniature Doughnuts recipe on this site to this one. The pastry cream in this one was a nice touch, but it didn't really make the doughnuts much better. I also thought the topping was completely unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the total experience.

Super delicious, if you love coffee. Looked great, fairly easy to make, filling the doughnuts is a bit of a pain, but well worth the final results!
