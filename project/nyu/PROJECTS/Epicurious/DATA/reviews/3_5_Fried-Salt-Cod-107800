If your on the fence- just make this. I didn't soak the cod, short on time so I didn't get the saltiness others spoke of but it was still soo good. I also tried for a pancake batter consistency and it was my first succusful fry ever! it was missing something so i made the hot sauce from another recipe on this site (onion, mayo, hot chili paste , harissa in this case) yumz!

Delicious, I love fish and chips. I have always made it with frozen cod never with salt cod. I loved it. The only change I made was to add lots of black pepper and a bit of cayenne to the batter. And I did add a little more water. A friend from England told me once that a fish batter should be like pancake batter. Not too thick and not too thin.

This recipe was problematic - the batter was way too thick (more like dough), and had to be thinned out, and then it didn't stick when we fried the fish. I tasted good but looked terrible.

Great Dish - very salty!

I found this recipe an absolute delight to prepare and serve. The taste of the salt combined with that of the fish combined woth that of the oil and unpredictably mixed with the taste of the oil was exquisite. I found I only needed to soak the fish for one day though. This may be because I used saltier cod or because my water here in the mountains has a magical "faster working" power. Whatever the reason, I approve heartily of this recipe and laugh the same way too.
