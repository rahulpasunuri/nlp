Everyone loved this turkey on Christmas Eve. Claimed it was the best they had ever had. That was after several bottles of champagne. I did two turkeys. Some notes: 1) Both turkeys (around 11 pounds) were done in less than 1.5 hours. 2) When the thighs were reading 165-170 degrees, the breast was in the 140's. I removed the legs (easy when it's already butterflied) and cooked the breasts another 10 minutes 'till they hit 165. 3) Hard to maintain a grill at 350 when its in the 20's. First 20 minutes were around 300, then the next 30 were at 400. Finished at 350. 4) The stuffing was a LOT of prep. Plan accordingly. 5) Made the mushroom gravy as recommended and it was delicious.

Made this 3 years ago, and now it's "Our Turkey." The stuffing is amazing, and the spice mix is beyond delicious (I have begun using it on chicken as well)! My husband grills the turkey on charcoal. The best turkey I've had in many years. And less clean-up inside!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and cannot wait to make it again. Super delicious. Rave reviews all around. It was not as difficult as I thought it would be to butterfly the turkey. Cooking shears did the trick. I had enough stuffing to put some in a separate dish to cook along side of the stuffed bird.

In addition to a standard roast turkey stuffed with traditional dressing, I made this recipe last year for Thanksgiving and it turned out perfectly. Raves from all 24 guests regarding the moist, butterflied, grilled turkey. Yesterday, I emailed our children asking for Thanksgiving menu requests, and my 19 year old daughter said, " you've got to make that stuffing and grilled turkey again. It's the best I've ever tasted". Enough said -- it will be on our table again this year!

Wonderful way to eat a turkey! Turkey breast was super moist and the stuffing was sooo good! Also it was done pretty fast and recipe is practically goof proof. Give it a try if you're contemplating it, you won't be sorry!

This is an awesome recipe. I did it. It was pretty easy and turned out great. Use fresh ricotta if you can get it.

I butterflied and grilled the turkey. It looked beautiful and grilled as long as directions said (and we were very careful to keep the temperature at a constant level), but it was raw when we cut into it and needed to be finished in the oven. That said, it was delicious when cooked through and the stuffing was really yummy. Made mixed mushroom and tarragon gravy to go with it and it was superb.

My 18 lbs. turkey cooked in less than 3 hours. I laid it over fennel, onions and lemons and used my mothers stuffing recipe. It was fabulous (moist and tender) and I will never cook a turkey any other way! Next time I will remove all the stuffing before carving - it was a mess trying to carve with the stuffing.

1). Previous experience convinced me that butterfly/spatchcock is THE only way to go with turkey. 2). Mahogany skin = start of a beautiful presentation. 3). Attention to broth/juices in pan during cooking will prevent "burned" pan. 4). Stuffing--for the first time ever-- disappeared down the family hatch asap. 5)Gravy was exceptional.

i really liked the butterfly technique! i will definitely use it again. 11 lb. turkey cooked just right in 2.5 hours. great pan drippings for gravy, too. [i did a simple salt, pepper, olive oil, butter, sage-parsley-thyme rub/stuffing instead of that posted due to a family member's dietary restrictions.]

I made the stuffing recipe as a side dish instead of using it to stuff under the skin. I prepared the stuffing recipe as directed except instead of crumbs, I used a 16 oz. loaf of whole grain french bread which I cubed and toasted. I baked it in a 9 x 13 bake dish at 350 for approx. 30 min. It got rave reviews; my brother in law called it "gourmet". I did not butterfly the turkey; I mixed the fennel seeds, rosemary, salt and pepper with butter and rubbed the mixture under the loosened skin of the turkey then baked it in a bag as directed. It was moist and tender. The herb mixture distributed throughout the turkey as it was sliced and added a nice flavor.

Instead of the ricotta stuffing I made my favorite New England Sausage Apple stuffing (with cornbread) on Epicurious. I followed the rest of this recipe and it was perfect. We removed the stuffing from the turkey before we carved. The meat was very moist and full of flavor. From now on I will always butterfly my turkey.

This worked very well. I used my own stuffing recipe but followed the prep and grilling instructions closely. My 14 lb turkey was done in 90 minutes - not 105 as suggested. Also pan juices were burned and not usable. But all in all a good way to get juicy, flavorful turkey in a short time.

Great flavor, moist meat. My butcher didn't remove the backbone..said that would be wasteful. It worked fine just cutting it and he scored the back of the breastbone so it would lie flat. I don't like fennel, so I substituted celery. I also used an oven bag and it cooked a little sooner and wasn't as brown as in the photo, but the meat was perfect.

I tried this out as an early Thanksgiving. I was intrigued with the way it was cooked and the fennel/sausage stuffing. I followed the recipe exactly, so I dont really know what happened. During cooking all my stuffing slid to the bottom of the pan instead of staying under the skin. This was obviously disappointing. It tasted nice, however the stuffing was just too moist and mushy. I dont think I would bother again.

Is this recipe missing a step? Do you leave the stuffing under the kin when you carve? Remove it? I'm going to try this recipe next week, we'll see how it turns out.

I have a question. The recipe says 2 cups bread crumbs. Crumbs? Or cubed bread?

I was intrigued at stuffing the Turkey under the skin, I have used spices and rubs in this way but never stuffing. What a great way to cook! The turkey was extremely moist and delicious. I do have to agree with the prior review that although the stuffing was good it was not great. The flavors melded together and there was not a bright note that really called it out. I actually grilled my bird on a Big Green Egg over indirect heat at about 325 dome temperature. Cooked for about 3 hours. The directions talk about have your butcher remove the back bone but I did not find this to be a problem and just used a heavy Chef's knife for the job. Over all a very good recipe and method of cooking a turkey and I will use it again.

I made this stuffing as a trial run before Thanksgiving. I thought it was very good but all I could really taste was the sausage which was too bad given all the other delicious ingredients. Don't know that I'd like garlic in a dish at Thanksgiving either, but I would certainly use this with a roast chicken on another occasion.
