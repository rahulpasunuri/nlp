Very nice, simple, could serve as an evening light meal.

The best part of this salad was the stilton used to garnish it. The dressing was flat and there certainly wasn't enough of it to dress the salad properly.

This is a light tasting, pleasant salad. It may have been my chives (fresh from the garden) but they didn't add anything but color. Next time, I'll try scallion greens.

We really enjoyed this salad. I made it for a dinner party and I went by the reviews and they were right this slad is easy and delicious. I also used scallions instead of chives, which worked out well and I added some roasted pecans.

I loved this recipe. It is really one of the best "different" salads I have made. You can make this one for a crowd knowing that it will turn out beautifully. Good blue cheese is a must.

Trying adding walnuts to enhance the taste of the blue cheese.

I have made this salad several times in the past few months, and everyone has liked it. It is definitely a keeper. If you don't use a good blue cheese, you probably won't like it!

I added kalamata olives. GREAT

Very refreshing. As another reviewer noted, good-quality blue cheese is critical (I use Maytag). Would also be good with a handful of toasted walnuts or pecans.

A very simple yet elegant salad. Very light and refreshing. Life is too short not to use high quality blue cheese!

I prepared this salad for our last dinner party and everyone raved over it. The dressing is the crowning touch. Will definitly make this again.

I used more dijon and it was too much. I used red onions instead of shallots and green onions instead of chives and it was delicious except for the extra dijon. I don't usually like salads, and I enjoyed this one.

I thought it was a nice, light salad and a good accompaniment for a pasta main course.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because we didn't make it "as is". I just wanted to offer my variation in case anyone is interested. We didn't have chives in the house, so we used a lesser qty of green onions. We also used apple slices, pine nuts, and a very good quality stilton (make sure to use an excellent quality blue cheese). As another reviewer recommended, we increased the Dijon in the dressing. The salad was absolutely delicious.

This got great reviews at our Easter dinner. I added about a third of a teaspoon more dijon. Otherwise I liked the simplicity... and it was very pretty with the two greens and the white(ish) cheese.

A simple, but very good salad--perfect for family dinner. Added a little avocado, since I had some I needed to use and they were a nice touch.

I made this for a family dinner and no one even mentioned it. The blue cheese and chives were a good combo but the dressing was missing something.
