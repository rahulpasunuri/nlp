Sadly, I was NOT impressed with this dessert last night. I didn't like the crust and the white chocolate/rhubarb combo was disappointing too. If you're looking for a rhubarb only recipe (no strawberries) make this one instead. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Rhubarb-Tart-with-Brown-Butter-Streusel-109094

I made this for Xmas last year. It is impressive to look at and very tasty. It needed a side serve of cream to tone down the flavours a bit. I found the pastry to be a bit heavy and hard -maybe I just didn't do it right. It took a while to make. I don't think I would go through all the hassle to make it again -but it's worth a go if you haven't tried it.

We were delightfully surprised. Used frozen rhubarb, which had a lot of water but boiled down in the syrup. I agree that the whiskey flavor is subtle at best. Unlike other reviewers, no one in our house found it too sweet, in fact the tart rhubarb contrasted particularly well with the white chocolate. I did have some trouble with the crust. To be fair, I didn't have an egg so substituted some cream. The crust browned far too much, the cooking times may be a little off(?), then I noticed that I used a 10" tart pan rather than 9". It still seems like a long pre-bake before 50 minutes with the filling. The glaze on the top of the tart browned too much, next time I will add it only for the last 15 minutes of cooking. Fresh whipped cream was worth the effort, it soothes the tart rhubarb. Overall, it was a big hit and even the kids liked it.

Seeing how I am from Wisconsin, we have lots of rhubarb. Thought this was a good way to use it. I like the crust, very firm on the bottom. Definitely a great combination of white chocolate and rhubarb. I did go light on the sugar with the white chocolate being on the bottom, but I typically don't like things too sweet. I got rave reviews and will make this again for a camping trip!

I didn't have high expectations for this dessert because between the time that I bought the white chocolate (it was a while ago) and the time that I got around to making the tart, I came to really hate white chocolate. Despite my weird predilections, this tart was delicious. The crust was one of the best tart crusts I've ever used, and I may begin to substitute it in other tart recipes. The filling was delicious and didn't really taste like white chocolate (which has nothing to do with chocolate), just sweetness. The sweetness was rather tooth-rotting and overwhelming, however, so I think that I'll cut back on the sugar next time.

Best Rhubarb Dessert Recipe I have ever come across - deserves 3½ forks really. I used my own recipe pastry, frozen rhubarb and used icing sugar to thicken up. Put in a good slosh of whisky much more than stated. The kitchen smelled like a brewery but was very surprised on eating pie that you couldn't even taste it. I'll add more next time. The white chocolate was the secret ingredient here and was a fantastic accompaniment to the rhubarb. Even the kids liked it !!

I made this in the summer and although I had to use frozen rhubarb, it came out delicious. Even my skeptical English friend who doesn't like sweets and didn't trust rhubarb loved it. Or at least he said he did. Maybe it was just English manners, but he didn't leave any crumbs.

Mmmm...I think this really rates 3 1/2 forks. I made this tart for my family's Memorial Day gathering and everybody loved it. The white chocolate adds a nice sweetness to the filling. My rhubarb seemed to be quite juicy and I had a little bit of a problem with the juices spilling over. You may want to slip a baking sheet underneath the pie to catch drips as it bakes (and to make it easier to lift the pan). Please note that 10 Tbsp. of butter is actually 1 1/4 stick!

The crust complemented the tartness of the rhubard. Added a hand full of strawberries to the rhubarb mix.
