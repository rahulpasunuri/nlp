I made this again last night and we all loved it! Roasting really brings out the flavors of the veggies. I made the recipe as written, except that I used dried thyme leaves and cooked the zucchini and tomato on opposite ends of the same cookie sheet (to save washing an extra pan-this recipe produces a lot of dishes to be washed).

Rating: 2
It smelled so good in the house, but the result was a complete let down, it definitely lacks something and was bland. Although it is easy to make, the ratio time to flavor is too high as already mentioned by other reviewers. I tried to serve this as a main course with bread and salad, but I think it is really a side dish.

Roasting the vegetables took a while, but it was worth it! I cooked up some italian sausage and added it to the rice. Will definitely make it again.

This was a surprisingly good side dish. I used brown rice and loved it's hearty texture with the veggies and cheese. Also after some other reviews I was a little concerned it might be bland so I mixed in a couple of tablespoons of pesto with the rice mixture. I grilled my zucchini as well.Served with italian style country pork ribs, but it could really stand alone. Hearty, rich without being too heavy, and all in all better than the sum of its parts.

Like other reviewers, I used brown rice and more of it. I also caramelized the onions, and used canned roasted tomatoes. (If I were to roast the tomatoes myself, I think I'd slow-roast them, and use more.) I mixed the rice and onions, then added enough packaged egg white ("ReddiEgg") to make the mixture drippy moist. I don't think you need the extra tablespoon of oil. All in all, this was a very nice thing to serve for a weekday supper along with a green salad. It's also great for the next day's lunch.

I grilled my zucchini and used fire roasted canned tomatoes. It was delicious.

I think this recipe was very flavorful and is a great way to use some of the prolific zucchini from the garden. Keeping to the recipe ratio, I used 1 C of leftover long grain brown rice. The recipe reads to cook the onions until tender, but I cooked them until they were caramelized. This added much flavor to the dish. I also used fresh picked Sungold cherry tomatoes (I roasted them whole). The fresh thyme was also delicious! I also like how it was not heavy on the rice so the taste and seasoning of the vegetables came through. It didn't seem terribly time consuming as many of the steps could be done simultaneously (and as for dishes, lining the roasting pans with parchment cuts down on clean-up!) It's a nice keeper recipe for our summer produce!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used brown rice. I liked it, but I did find it lacking in flavor for a main dish. Yet, I really loved the combination of the zucchini and roasted tomatoes. Next time I will also use more veggies and less rice, as well as follow the advice of a reviewer and add mustard powder and Worchester sauce. I didn't find it overly time-consuming. I roasted the zucchini and tomatoes together and took out the tomatoes halfway through when I turned the zucchini. In general, I recommend it as an interesting and healthy side dish.

I made this dish for a pot luck dinner today and am pleased with the results. I hate to read reviews of cooks who make so many substitutions that the original recipe is lost, but after I read the reviews on this dish, I decided I should increase the spices. I love to grill so I drizzled olive oil over sliced zucchini and yellow squash and sprinkled with garlic powder then grilled them for about 15 minutes on a gas grill (turned them at least 3 times during that time) which made nice seared marks on each slice. After the squash slices were grilled, I added them to the pan with the sauteed onions and garlic, added the rice, 1 egg, cheese and 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic. I added about 2 tsp of fresh minced basil to the mixture then poured the entire mixture into a baking pan, sprinkled extra cheese on top and baked for about 20 minutes. I was considering substituting feta cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano; maybe next time!

Rating: 3
The ingredients are fairly simple and the end result was very good. However, it requires many pots, so it's not a great option for a weeknight or if you're just looking to put something together quickly. Not sure I'll make it again given the labor (washing a bunch of pots and pans)-to-flavor quotient.

Rating: 3
Using brown rice and adding a can a cannellini beans, this was an excellent and very filling one-dish vegetarian meal. Easy enough to do on a week night although I did not layer like the recipe said.

Made this dish tonight. I followed the recipe, except I doubled the rice and used regular parm cheese, rather than parm-reggiano. I really enjoyed it as a vegetarian main dish. My boyfriend had it with a pork roast and that devout carnivore went back for seconds. I didn't think the dish was all that time-consuming or difficult. Cooking with fresh ingredients usually involves some chopping. I enjoyed the rich, simple flavors. My only suggestion would be to double the tomatoes. The dish could use a little more tomato-ey goodness.

THis recipe is great as written, and makes for a great casserole on the lighter side, but still filling. The only change I made was using a less- aged cheese which was also fine.

Very impressed with this recipe. I'm not a huge fan of roasted tomatoes, so I used sun dried instead.. great substitution. I also added some sliced mushrooms in the onion/garlic mix. Great for a main dish or side dish.

Rating: 1
Was quite lacking in flavor and that's with some extra jazzing up. A little labor intensive for not being more tasty. I would attempt something like this again with much more flavoring - I had added a spoon of Dijon & Worcestershire, as well as a little smoked Gouda but it still needed much more. Maybe cooking the rice in broth, not just water could help. Also felt like too much egg.

Rating: 3
Made this again after following the recipe almost exactly first time around. This time around I again used 1/2 cup of rice (easier to calculate how much water to use) and I added a teaspoon of mustard powder, a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce and a two teaspoons of finely chopped fresh rosemary (from garden) to the rice mixture. This time I got excited exclamations of "Wow! This is great! Make this more often!" Next time I might sprinkle freshly chopped basil over the top. I like the low ratio of rice to vegetables in this dish - it's more like having a little rice with your vegetables then some vegetables in your rice. That works for me perfectly.

Rating: 3
I made this with 1/2 cup of rice instead of 1/3 because calculating the amount of water to use to cook 1/3 cup of rice was making my eyes cross. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Everyone really enjoyed it but I can see the other commentators points about it being a bit on the bland side. The suggested additions of fresh basil or some mustard powder mixed into the rice sound good.

This turned out wonderfully, but after reading others' reviews, I made some changes. Basically, I doubled everything except the oil and veggies.

Second time I've made this dish. My husband "likes it a lot!" Like others, I used more rice than what was called for and used brown rice instead of white. Also added 1/2 cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes and smoked fontina cheese to the rice mixture. Delish.

Rating: 2
Cooked it once as is and it was... bland, but seemed to have potential. Like everyone else suggested, the second time, I doubled the rice. Along with it I doubled the thyme and cheese. Much better the second go but still needs a little something.

This recipe is easy to make and not time-consuming, despite what the commenters say, but I found it lacked a lot of flavor. If I made it again, I would do a mix of parm-reg with another sharper cheese, increase the salt, and maybe add some sharp mustard to the rice mixture. Needs a lot of adjustments. I also used fresh basil instead of thyme...

I made this again, but this time I was in a hurry so I baked the zucchini and tomatoes together, and then simply mixed the rice etc. into the same pan before baking again. Much less work and mess, for almost exactly the same dish.

Really, really great - a perfect way to use zucchini. My one complaint is that 1/3 cup of rice is not enough. I made it with 1/2 cup instead which was good, and 2/3 probably would have been even better.

I love veggies and wanted to love this dish. I did enjoy the roasted zucchini and tomatoes but the egg in the rice created a texture that I did not like. Because of the amount of work, I wouldn't make again.

Changes: I agree that the dish needs more rice. I cooked 1 cup of rice and used about 3/4 of that (about 2 cups worth of cooked rice). I also found that 1.5 lbs of zucchini seemed a bit much, and at the grocery store 4 zucchini stalks equaled 1.25 lbs. I found that I could have even used a little less zucchini than 1.25 lbs...maybe 1 lb. I added more cheese (of course adding more cheese makes everything taste better). There was no Parmigiano-Reggiano so I used Pectorino-Romano cheese and it still tasted fabulous! With those changes, this recipe was excellent. My husband and I agreed this will become a regular. From start to finish I believe it took me 1.5 hours.

This was awful, is the 1/3 cup of rice a misprint? I halved the recipe and used 1/3 of a cup and there still didn't seem to be enough rice. Beyond that it just plain tasted bad, I'll never attempt this dish again.

We loved this. I'm with the reviewer who suggested canned roasted tomatoes. That would eliminate a pan. Also used 1/2 cup brown rice and cut down on the oil...didn't add to the rice mixture and used only a light drizzle on top.

Great way of cooking zucchini. Everyone liked it and I didn't even do the tomatoes. Next time I'll want to do that. I used someone's suggestion of cooking the rice in the onions and garlic and that worked out well. So I sauted the onion and garlic, then I added the rice and water to let it all cook the remaining 20 minutes with the rice.

This is so much better than just a sum of it's parts. Absolutely delicious! I've made it for many people and everyone loves it, even those that thought they didn't like zucchini. I've also made it with roasted peppers (Yellow look prettiest) and brown rice. Surprisingly rich tasting yet pretty healthy.

Made this last week to use up the last of the zucchini & tomatoes from the garden. I increased the rice(brown) to 1/2 cup & increased the tomatoes slightly & added some red & orange sweet peppers that I roasted with the tomatoes. It was delicious! It made plenty, so we enjoyed leftovers the next night. Yum! I didn't think it took all that long to make, & I sauteed the onion & garlic & then cooked the rice with them in the same pan.

So I read all the previous reviews, and thought: This recipe can't possibly take THAT long, I'll use my food processor....Even with the food processor slicing away...It took FOREVER!!! But it was absolutely delicious. I substituted brown rice and tarragon and it turned out wonderfully.

I wanted to make this recipe a little more healthful and made the following changes: 1) I used 2/3 cups of brown rice boiled in chicken broth. 2) I increased the tomatoes to one pound and the zucchini to 2 pounds. 3) I used pecorino-romano cheese and added an extra 1/4 cup on top. The gratin was superlative.

Oh my. Delicious! I am not even a huge zucchini fan and this is a dish I would certainly make again. I had to use whole canned plum tomatoes, but they were still lovely in it. Also, I made my own bread crumbs (pan-friend cubes of bread in olive oil) and put them on top before the final baking. They added the perfect crispiness to the dish!

This dish was yummy but to me not enough for a light supper. I served it as a side dish with roasted salmon. I prepared the recipe as written and found there was barely enough rice to make the 2 layers. It was delicious, but next time I'll use 1/2 cup of rice and more cheese. It does dirty an awful lot of pans!

I made this as a light supper, and liked the flavors of the roasted zucchini and tomato with the almost risotto-like consistency of the rice, onions and eggs.

Overall, I enjoyed the recipe and the flavors and will make this again.

I've made this several times and made some adaptations. To reduce clean up I cook the onions and garlic and then add the uncooked rice, add water, and simmer until done. I also substituted artichoke hearts for zucchini, using thawed frozen artichoke hearts. I roasted them with olive oil at 450 for 15 minutes. Really good.

I would give this 3 1/2 forks if I could. I thought that the recipe was excellent, and my meat-loving family devoured the whole thing. I used 1/2 a cup of rice, which I thought worked well. I agree with other people when they said that it was more of a veggie dish than a rice dish, but I thought that it was still plenty filing. At the time I was wondering if it was really necessary to roast the veggies before assembling them, but I've decided that it did give it a little something extra (I've made other recipes where you just throw it all together, and I think that this was better). If you wrap your baking sheets in foil the clean-up is really not bad, and it's really just passive time while the veggies are in the oven. I topped mine with a little bit of basil, which was nice. Overall, I think that this is a great summer side.

This is a great side dish. I made it as directed, except I went easy on the oil and added bread crumbs to the cheese on top. It seemed like there was not enough rice when I was assembling it, but once it baked, it was fine. The rice/egg layers are very thin, but help bind the whole thing together. It was very easy to cut and serve. This is more of a vegetable dish with a little rice, as opposed to a rice dish with vegetables. It didn't absolutely blow me away, but it was very good and I'll make it again. My fiance liked it. It's a great way to use up zucchini from the garden.

This was delicious! I've made the recipe as stated, but I've also made it with modifications. I substituted herb de Provence for the thyme, and vodka sauce for the roasted tomatoes.

This is an okay side dish but not very exciting, and certainly not a good main course. With changes it could be very nice, though. I think the reviewer who doubled the rice had the right idea, and using a little stock to cook the rice would have helped, too. Roasting the veggies was a great idea, but I could have gone for some more variety besides just zucchini.

This is one of the best rice dishes I have ever had! The steps were easy despite being time-consuming. I used about 2/3 cup of rice because there didn't seem to be enough with just 1/3 cup, and I cooked it in water with some chicken stock (no butter or oil) to amp up the flavor. I also omitted the oil at the end and didn't use any thyme. I used 1/2 cup of the cheese in the rice mixture and then grated some more over the top of the dish just before putting in the oven, which resulted in a really delicious, cheesy rice mixture. Everyone loved it and the dish was completely cleaned...so yummy!!!!

Followed the recipe as written. Thought it was very good right out of the oven, but not as great reheated as a leftover. Next time I will cut the tomatoes thicker (1/2- inch) because they shrivel significantly after roasting . Also agree that the final oil drizzling on top of the casserole is not necessary. Great side dish...will definitely make again.

I made this recipe with a few changes that made it easier and healthier. I substituted brown rice for the white and cooked it in veggie stock for more flavor. I cooked the zuchinni as described but skipped cooking the tomatoes. I tossed the tomatoes in the oil and salt and topped the dish with them. They roasted beautifully during baking. I omitted the final oil on top of the casserole, it did not seem necessary. Everyone loved it

Try roasting all the vegetables (including onion and garlic) together in one large pan or baking dish--just keep everything in a single layer. This eliminates two extra pans and helps the flavors to blend as they roast.

I have made gratin from another recipe in the past which called for gruyere, so I substituted that cheese (which I think has a smokier flavor) for the parmesan. I made for a group of friends, everyone thought it tasted delicious, however in the plating process, the dish crumbled a lot and lost the beauty it had while I prepared it. When I placed it on the plates it looked like a mush of risotto with roasted vegetables strewn into it; it looked appetizing, but didn't maintain the density that I have seen in previous gratin. Rich flavors, and I think worth another shot.

This is similar to one of my husband's family's recipes they've been making for years, though theirs is less "gourmet". I like this version (mainly for the roasted vegetables), but as it takes so much time, I'll stick with the family one in the future. Butter the dish. Add cooked rice (or uncooked instant rice with 3/4 of the water added) to the pan. Add chopped tomatoes, onions, and garlic topped with sliced or grated zucchini, all fresh. Sprinkle on salt, pepper, and oregano or thyme (be sparing if using dried herbs). Top with a smooth melting grated cheese, bake at 375 for 40 minutes. Can add some chopped bacon or ham to the top before baking if you're using it as a main course. Easy, fast family fare.

While the end result is really really yummy, I have some quibbles with this recipe. 1. So much oil! I think it could be decreased by at least 1 tbs when you put the gratin together, maybe more. 2. For a simple tasting dish, it sure uses up a cupboardful of dishes. Finally, don't salt the rice water--there's plenty of salt in the recipe itself. Learn from my mistake.
