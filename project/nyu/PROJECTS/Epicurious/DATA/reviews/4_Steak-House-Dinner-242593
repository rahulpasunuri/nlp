Really yummy. The only things I did differently was that I used leeks instead of shallots (because I had a lot of leeks) and added some mushrooms to the spinach. It took all of 20 minutes to cook and that included cooking a packaged risotto to go with it. Definitely a great work day dinner.

This is definitely a keeper. Twenty minutes from the time I walked in the kitchen to the time I set the plates down on the table. Doubled the meat for me and my husband but kept all other ingredients the same. Really good!

Really great, EASY recipe, spinach has a lot of flavor and tang. Easy to double or triple the recipe. I was not careful with measurements, just dumped in approximate amounts. Made it twice this way, perfect both times, very forgiving.

I found this recipe looking to use some spinach I had in the fridge and it was great. I used no cream and added blue cheese to taste and it came out really well. Also the 20 minute preparation time is no lie!

Yes, you can use less butter and fat with great results.

I made this tonight for two of us. The spinach is amazing - I doubled everything, but would use a bit less cream next time, just to save a few hundred calories. That said, I wouldn't skimp on the cheese. Did I mention the spinach is divine?!

Outstanding recipe. It has a great blend of ingredients and it was really simple to make. It is written up for a single person dinner, but with a large enough skillet you can easily accommodate 4 or more doing 2 at a time... The steak came out perfectly.

This was delicious and my husband loved it. Normally I don't like cooked spinach on its own but with the shallots and blue cheese I could not get enough.

This was fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and it turned out to be a home run! Highly recommended a very classic set of flavors

My husband is not a fan of the ingredients individually however he LOVED this! I actually heard nothing but how good dinner was the rest of the night.. I used half n half in place of the heavy cream and just eyeballed how much i used, it was delicious! I will be making this on a regular basis

We really the combination of flavors here. I used more blue cheese , and managed to forget the lemon juice and it was still great.

This was sooo good. When my boyfriend made it we used about 1/2 the spinage and made creamy horseradish mashed potatoes too. All the flavors played so well with each other- I have been giving this recipie to everyone I know. We are having it again tonight!

This was yummy, but my creamed spinach was too watery, and I ended up having to kind of fish the spinach out of the sauce, drizzle a little extra on, and dump the rest. It could be my fault for reducing the amount of cream, though. That said, even with a lot of the cream sauce tossed, it was very flavorful and rich, so I actually liked how it turned out. I think it would be too heavy with the amount of cream called for.
