Made this for Thanksgiving. The shallots were great (if a little sweet, I would cut down on the sugar the next time), but the mashed potatoes an utter disaster. Followed the recipe, but ended up with a bowl of wallpaper paste. Used Yukons, but the 1/2 cup of milk was not enough. Not sure what happened. Maybe by baking them too much of the starch is left in (as opposed to boiling them in water), which made them goop up? I ended up throwing the goop out and my guy made a batch of his always awesome mashed potatoes. Luckily we had extra potatoes and enough time :)

In a word: fantastic. Deceptively easy to make, smells wonderful and tastes as good or better than it smells.

First, I loved it because it was a "make ahead" dish for Thanksgiving. Rave reviews from our guests, who are pretty much gourmands. Didn't change much, except that I pulled the leaves off the thyme and left them in the potatoes. And I used a smaller skillet, which helped with reducing the time on carmelizing the shallots and also didn't cook them too quickly. GORGEOUS DISH!

I did not cover the shallots, having tried to make them a few days ahead. Do steps 1 and 2, then add whole shallots, thyme and cook, uncovered at a low heat. They will not need additional moisture and will be gorgeous and declicious! BTW, also reduce olive oil by one-half......PERFECTION.

Outstanding! From now on we will make this potato recipe for Thanksgiving. After years and years of using another recipe, this one is so great, we are making a switch.

Good recipe - nice variation on traditional mashed potatoes. I peeled and boiled the potatoes though to get the right consistency. Shallots did take much longer to cararmelize than recipe stated. Worth waiting for. When serving, I just mounded on top and did not mix into potatoes.

Great recipe, highly recommend cooking the shallots a day or two ahead since they are alittle time consuming. Everyone loved them.

Amendment to review...should have used a smaller skillet to slow roast shallots, which was not called out in the recipe, my mistake.

Would make these again for a special occasion, but I think we still prefer roasted garlic and horseradish sour cream mashed potatoes (Tyler Florence) to these. Note that the shallots took a long time and I probably added up to a cup of water, although my pan was larger than the one called for in the recipe.

I do not know about others but combined with perfect mashed potatoes, these are the best mashed potatoes ever. I always get rave reviews and never have a problem cooking!

This was a huge disappointment. The shallots caramelized and burned within 15 minutes even at low. It gave the dish a brown color that was unappetizing and we couldn't eat the potatoes due to taste anyway. However, I managed to salvage the dish by turning it into mashed potato pancakes. What a waste of homegrown shallots and potatoes.

I had problems getting the potatoes the right consistency, but the combination of the potatoes & theshallots was toatally a winner!!
