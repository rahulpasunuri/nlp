Excellent the first serving. Leftovers are not as good so I'll make for company instead of just my husband and me.

Yum! I have made this a lot -- when I can't think of what else to have for dinner. Tonight, I made it with a traditional white sauce -- my two-year old chowed down, and she is super picky! I would have given this four stars, but I can't -- that goes to the chef at the Hoenzollern Festung in Salzburg! My husband and I split it on a beautiful October day while on our honeymoon. Add in a Radler or Spezi and you really have a perfect meal!

This dish was delicious. It was so simple and easy to make. I didn't even have to go out and buy any ingredients. I used the italian-style breadcrumbs that I had leftover from Christmas. I waited 30 minutes and didn't chill it and it still came out perfect!! This is definitely a keeper.

This is one of the best fried chicken recipes I have ever tasted. The preparation is perfect for excellent results. i am looking forward to making it again soon.

It is important to prepare the chicken when your guests have arrived. I mix some poultry seasoning (sage, rosemary, thyme, majoran, white ground pepper, salt and some cayenne) with the flour. One can also marinate the chicken in lemon juice for a few hours (this tip comes from a friend living in Styria). The best sidedish is sliced tomatoes with white wine vinegar, chives and pumpkin seed oil (salt and pepper, too).

I prepared this dish for company. Unfortunately, they arrived late and the breading became rather soggy (I had covered the serving dish with foil to keep it warm). My husband, however, thought it was great - and he's hard to please when it comes to chicken.

In desperation to find a recipe for a quick chicken meal, I discovered the Australian-fried chicken recipe. Worked out beautifully. Not being a good cook, or someone who is knowledgable around the kitchen, I was very happy with the results as was the good woman for whom I was attempting to please. I called it Cooking tips for dummies.

I have been making chicken like this for years. One tip that I recently learned was if using chicken breasts, soak the pieces overnite in buttermilk and then rinse the next day before breading. The buttermilk makes the chicken so moist - it's simply wonderful!!!!
