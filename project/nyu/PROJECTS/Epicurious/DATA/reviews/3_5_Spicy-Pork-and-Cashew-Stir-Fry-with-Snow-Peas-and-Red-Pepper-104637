Really great! I added more ginger and red pepper flakes and it could have used a little more "sauce" of some sort-- a little dry over rice, but still wonderful and fast. In regular rotation here on weeknights!

This is a fairly easy recipe and tastes like you are eating in your favorite Asian restaurant. Works every time. I have cooked it with pork or chicken. I like to add mushrooms (shiitake or button. Tonight I'm making it with chicken and baby portobellos. I'm out of bean sprouts but we'll top it with fresh cilantro (coriander) from the backyard garden.

My husband over the phone asked that I please do not make a stirfry. Well I made this one with chicken. Cut the breasts up in small slivers. Thought it was incredible! My husband said he would eat it every night. Wow. This is a great EASY recipe.

This was excellent. My picky husband kept giving it the thumbs up throughout the meal. I prepared it as described except for doubling the sauce ingredients and serving couscous on the side instead of rice. Huge success and a keeper. Once you have the mise en place done, it cooks up in no time.

good basic recipe. for variety i made some changes....i used hoisin sauce instead of the sweetened soy sauce and substituted sliced portobello mushrooms and fresh asparagus which i roll cut on the diagonal instead of the snow peas.i used boneless pork cutlets which i put in the freezer for about 20 min. for easier slicing.i did the pork first which turned out very tender and the veggies came out perfectly tender/ crisp. however, i had to clean the wok between the pork and the veggies as the corn starch coated the pan from the pork. if you do veggies first this isn't a problem.i served this dish with white rice and cucumbers which i marinated in sugar rice vinegar soy sauce and sesame oil which is a good accompaniment.

This is really very tasty, but I agree with a prior reviewer that vegetables should be cooked last. Also, I know that fresh is best, but frankly garlic powder and ginger add the needed kick without the added preparation.

Rating: 4
Overall, this was a very good stir fry. It was very, very flavorful and fairly easy to make. I basically followed the recipe with just a few changes. I doubled the amount of both sauces as most people recommended (both the marinade for the meat as well as the amount of soy sauce w/ sugar). I used pork tenderloin and added water chestnuts and baby corn (one can of each). I'm not a huge ginger fan so I only used it when I cooked the veggies (about 1 teaspoon total). I used a bit more garlic than the recipe calls for. I also added a couple of minutes to the cooking times (I added a couple of minutes when cooking the veggies and again when I cooked the meat).

I doubled the sweet soy and added broccoli too. Overall loved this dish. Even my boyfriend did and he is a hard pleasure. Nice and simple, sometimes the best combination!

Rating: 2
I am only giving this recipe 2 stars because the preparation instructions need major improvement. The meat should be very quickly stir-fried (and removed) before the veggies instead of doing the veggies first and having to reheat them, thereby making them soggy and overcooked. I added a single, large crown of broccoli (broken into florets and nuked for a few minutes in a little water) because there were just not enough vegetables. I also used a fresh chile pepper instead of flakes, Shaoxing wine instead of the sherry (vastly better), roasted sesame oil (Kadoya brand is excellent). To make adequate sauce, I added a cup of chicken broth w/ a bit more cornstarch. I also recommend brown instead of plain sugar. With these improvements, the entrée is much better. I served mine over long-grain brown rice. I'd make it again but only with the same revisions.

YUMM! I just got up from the table to write how good this recipe is. Fantastic fare for a weekday meal. I used frozen stir-fry veggies that I had in the freezer instead of the peas and peppers. The result was just fine. I did increase the garlic and ginger. This is a keeper.

Great recipe; a keeper. I made it exactly as written and it was great. Only quibble; I use a non-stick electric wok and I thought there was too much oil in the recipe. I used less, and when I make it again I will use still less. Otherwise, fabulous!

I tried this basic recipe with left over roast chicken. It worked very well. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding the small pieces of chicken to the vegetable mix and stir-frying it for about one minute to warm meat.

Although I think there is a step missing here (eg. the reference to 'sweetened soy sauce' does not make sense) this was great. I made it with peanuts instead of cashews, and my mother raved about it all night long. It's a keeper!

Great, and best of all, very quick--it took us just under half an hour from starting the preparation to eating. The only changes I made were to nearly double the garlic and to add a bit more pepper flakes. One of the best stir-fry's I have ever done and will definitely make again and again.

Very easy, very tasty, very colorful. Next time I'll use pork tenderloin instead of pork loin and cut down a little (not a lot) on the cashews.

Rating: 3
I loved the different flavors (and colors!) of this dish. I actually prepared it with chicken breasts and thought the cashews were great - just don't add too many and they won't be so bold in the dish.

Rating: 2
This had nice flavour, but I thought the salted cashews made the dish way too salty . I'll make this again, but with unsalted nuts. I might also leave out or reduce the cornstarch - there is so little liquid in this dish that I ended up with a sort of gummy coating on the pork. I added a little water, and that improved the texture. I'ld give this 3 forks for its potential, but not for the recipe as written!

Rating: 3
This was a really good and very easy weeknight meal. I made with 1/2 lb pork tenderloin, reduced some of the other ingredients a bit and it was great. I also forgot to stir fry the garlic, etc before the pork (just left it there in the little bowl--oops) and it was not quite spicy enough. Next time I will remember.

To the cook from Houston: I had the same thought. Luckilly, I read the other reviews, and a cook from NY gave those needed instructions (thank you!): stir the sherry, the crnstch, 1T soy sauce and sesame oil, then marinate the pork for 10 min (or so); stir together the sugar and other 2T of soy sauce, then continue with the recipe. Voila!

Yum! This is sooo good! Red pepper adds flavor without being hot. I added a bit of chick stock and covered the dish to let it cook more, my peppers and pork were in 1" chunks. Upped the garlic/ginger. Also threw in some chopped scallion at end. Don't expect this to feed four people as a main course - two of us almost decimated the whole dish one sitting!

This dish is absolutely delicious. Just discovered it about a month ago when I bought a big bag of snow peas that I didn't want to go bad. We have already had it 3 or 4 times, serving it to company on 2 occasions to rave reviews. I have made it with chicken instead of pork and I add quite a bit of broccoli. I made it with powered ginger the first couple of times and it was delicious, but there is definitely a difference with the fresh ginger. I use red wine in place of the sherry and use some pepper sauce instead of the red pepper flakes... it gives flavor without the real heat. I have young children who don't like the heat in pepper flakes. I serve this over the frozen sticky rice that they sell at Costco (microwave for 5 minutes, perfect sticky rice). One of our family's favorites.

I made this for my family last night, eliminating the spicy red pepper flakes, as my husband is not a spicy fan. It was fantastic, and he even agreed to try it a little spicy next time. It was easy to prepare, and I even added in some brocolli for my son.

When this recipe was put on the web, they left out the first 2 paragraphs. 1. Stir together Sherry, cornstarch, and 1 T soy sauce, then stir in sesame oil. Add pork, stirring to coat well, and let stand 10 minutes. 2. Stir together sugar and remaining 2 T soy sauce. Continue as noted on the recipe. It's a delicious dish and well worth making. The marinade is an excellent base for any stir fry and I have made it countless ways. Enjoy!

Very tasty even though I left out the pepper since my husband doesn't generally like spicy stir fry. Note that the instructions never mention what you're supposed to do with the first four ingredients. I assumed stirring them together to become the "sweetened soy sauce" was my best bet. It appeared to work.

I made this last night. It was excellent. Now that the asparagus season is starting I substituted asparagus for the snow peas. This was pretty much fool proof, especially with the extra directions. I did cut down on the oil a little bit and added more hot pepper flakes. My boyfriend said it was better than our favorite dish from the local chinese restaurant!!

Three forks, BUT........the dish was MUCH to oily for our liking. We would limit the number of tsp of oil to 2-3 tops (versus the 5 that the recipe calls for). Additionally, we would add more red pepper flakes (personal preferences), as well as more veggies (broccoli, maybe some bok choy). Overall, a very repeateable dish given the modifications noted above.

The dish turned out to be pretty good - but, the recipe left a little to be desired. The recipe did not specify what to do with the sherry, the corn starch, soy sauce,and the sesame oil. It referred to "sweetened soy sauce," so presumably these ingredients may have had something to do with that aspect. As I stated, the dish turned out okay, no thanks to the proofreader for Gourmet Magazine.

Made this tonight with no changes execpt I used pork tenderloin instead of the loin and it was really, really good. My only complaint is in the way the ingredients are listed and this is just a pet peeve of mine. Wouldn't it be easier to follow if they put the word "divided" after the garlic, ginger & red pepper since the amounts are used seperately in the recipe? Or why not tell you to combine those ingredients and then use half when you saute the veggies and the other half when you saute the meat? More than once I have quickly rechecked my ingredient list in a recipe and added the whole amount listed when it should have been divided and used seperately. Minor point I know but worth mentioning.
