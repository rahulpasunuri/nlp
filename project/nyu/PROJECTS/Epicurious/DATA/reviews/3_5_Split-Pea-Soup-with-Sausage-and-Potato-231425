Easy, easy, easy! Great cold weather fare. I've made it with both hot links and kielbasa. Both are very good.

This is a good winter soup and very filling. I used red potatoes to increase the tartness and substituted meat sausage for veggie sausage (Japanese dried and crushed chili pepper used for spiciness). The soup should cook for about 70 minutes to avoid overly firm peas. The soup had a medium thickness when hot, but firmed very quickly as the soup cooled.

I love this and look forward to making it every winter!

Pleasant enough, certainly comfort food, but I was looking for something with a little more flavor. This just struck me as a wee bland. To be fair, I used equal parts hot and sweet Italian sausages (what I had on hand), a decidedly average home-made broth that was more vegetable than chicken and four sprigs of dried rosemary reconstituted in said broth for a few hours then minced. I don't doubt I'll make it again, but this is a dish I would make for myself when looking for something hearty, rather than serving to guests.

We really liked the flavor of this one - nothing fancy, just great comfort food. We used 2 Kielbasa links, and that was perfect for us. Added some sliced carrots for a little extra flavor and color. We'll definitely make this one again - perfect for when it's chilly outside. Leftovers were extremely thick - might keep a little chicken broth to dilute it next time.

Better if you cook the peas about half way in the stock first, then add the sauteed sausage, onions and potatoes. Otherwise I found the potatoes too mushy and the sausage overrcooked. I also added a jalapeno for spice and used my own unsalted stock and did not add any salt. The liguica I used was salty enough for the whole pot. Absolutely delicious.

I used fresh Chorizo. It was delicious.

Really good, and easy. The rosemary definitely permeates everything, but that's fine - just be prepared. It gets VERY thick as a left-over, though - bring a fork!

Great but not stellar. I added a few extras as suggested, like carrots, celery, thyme, garlic and white pepper, but you can only dress-up split pea soup so much. I would make this warm, homey soup for myself any day, but it wasn't "wow" enough for company.

This is absolutely the BEST! Simple and quick prep with ingredients always in my cupboard...Fresh rosemary is a great twist to a cold-day-comfort-soup. VERY satisfying! I wouldn't change a thing!!!

This is easy and delicious. Makes a good amount that i then freeze in indivudual servings and take to work! Last time i made it i ladled out the sausage (Organic chicken from Trader Joe's) and used a hand blender to puree some of the potatoes and peas, made it slightly creamy and a nicer presentation. I have now made this 3 times and it's one of my husbands favs!! No more progresso split pea soup for us!!

You can't go wrong with soup on a snowy day. Using this recipe as inspiration, I doubled it with a full pound of linguica, a pound of split yellow & green peas, and 7 cups of broth. Borrowing from other recipes on the site, I added thyme, bay leaf, garlic, chopped celery and carrots. My tongue is still burning, but boy, was this good. A meal in itself.

This was WONDERFUL. I used 3 Hillshire Farm Beef Hot Links that weighed 7 oz. (1/2 package). I followed the recipe with 3 exceptions: subbed 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary, added the potatoes at the same time as the peas, and added 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes to give it some ZING. Mine turned out somewhat watery, so I reduced it a bit at the end by simmering it, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Next time I would replace a little of the broth with water, as it did taste a bit salty. DO try this--it SURE beats Healthy Choice.

Very good and so easy and quick to prepare. I used jalapeno/habanero (sp) sausage to kick up the spice. I put the onion and potatoes with the sausage in more of a large sautee pan as that made the browning easier than my soup pot and mine is narrow and tall. Don't be afraid of trying this as it is not like the awful stuff I have had as a kid.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe and didn't change a thing. The spicy sausage gave it just enough heat. Next time I'll double the recipe so I have leftovers to freeze!

This is a delicious soup. So simple, yet all the ingredients compliment each other. Love the rosemary. Didn't change a thing except we liked quite a bit fresh ground pepper added. Very hearty supper.

This is definitely a keeper! It was very easy to make, hearty and yummy. My substitutions: chicken andouille sausage, sweet potato and low sodium vegetable broth. For my taste buds, I did not need additional salt or pepper. Although, I did need to add another 1½ cups of water to pot to make it more soupy. Next time: I will use only 1 or 2 sausages. That is more than enough for me. I like the idea of shredding the potato and I will try that. Also, I agree that the potatoes should be added with the peas.

Yum,yum,yum. This soup is awsome. Other than the spicy sausage, my wife even liked it, and she does not like pea soup. I took the advice of another cook and added chorizo. Real simple. Real good.

I used thyme instead of rosemary and grated the potato. Also used turkey stock I had frozen from Christmas. Delicious.

I didn't want to drown out the pea flavour, so I found Aidell's Chicken Apple sausage, a wee bit less pronounced than andouille.I also traded out the rosemary (a bit too woody)for 1/4 t bay leaf, powdered. I served it to my friends, and a good time was had by all.

A good alternative to classic pea soup. If sausage is salty, be careful how much salt you add.

Great split pea soup. Instructions specified sauting onions, potatoes and chopped rosemary. Onions yes but other items seemed silly so I just put them in the pot with the peas. Cooked it a little longer cuz the peas were not done.
