I made this as an appetizer for Christmas and it was a huge hit. Even my 7 year old granddaughter loved it. I made it a couple of days ahead and we have been having leftovers every day since and it is still great. Served it with thin sliced baguette.

My husband has made this many times. It's one of our favorites. We think it needs cornichons, along with the dijon and baguette slices.

am listing it down as one of december 2005 christmas giveaways, (and will start making little pots on my pottery wheel!)

One of my guests said it perfectly: "It's everything a pate should be." Yup, that about covers it. I found this a little labor-intensive, but well worth the effort. Will be making this again. PS: Because of the lack of fat, this doesn't last in the refrigeratorpast a day, so eat it up in one meal.

Have made this many times. A wonderful fireside supper; a wonderful before-the-symphony supper!

This was so good! I love liver, but have the same problem with other cook who thinks preparing them leaves the stomach queasy. Once I get past that part, then I'm fine. Wonderful, flavorful dish. I like it room temp.

Fantastic! I've made this recipe a couple of times now and it is definitely a favorite. Easy, low in fat -- a winner. When I didn't have a baguette, I used a slice of oatmeal bread instead -- no problems.

If you like pate, you will enjoy this one very much! It definitely is better after being chilled, overnight if possible, and I like it chilled more than at room temperature. Easy preparation, unusual in flavors and makes an elegant presentation.

I agree this is a wonderful dish and no time consuming. I will definitively make it again. I only warn other cooks they will need a hard stomach to prepare this pate. I had never cooked chicken livers before and while preparing they are disgusting.

I used regular white mushrooms and turkey ham. I felt the ham was not even necessary. the recipe is fantastic!! I made it for a gourmet group and everyone raved about it.

to caroline: i usesd raw turkey. it cooks in the terrine and adds flavour and moisture to the terrine. this is a great recipe! easy and inexpensive. i'd give it a 4+ but that's not an option.

okay, dumb question...is the ground turkey supposed to be *cooked* turkey, which is subsequently ground, or is it raw ground turkey?

Most low fat fakes of real food recipes taste like exactly that... valient attempts but not more. I had my doubts but this is really delicious! The texture is good, too. It was not difficult or time-consuming to make. I will definitly make it again for company. The only change would be that my personal taste prefers just a tad less salt.
