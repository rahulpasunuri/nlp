Just okay. The chops had no special flavor and the onion mixture was too tart for my taste.

Simple and delicious! I made the sauce together with the lamb, and as the vinegar concentrates down, it leaves a delightful sweetness with the lamb. The mixture was perfect.

This is a nasty way to treat perfectly lovely lamb chops. The sauce would be better applied to dry old pork chops. My lover left me after I served this which was the only bonus.

The balsamic vinegar and onion combination was far too harsh for the lamb. Something more subtle is needed to bring out the natural flavors of the lamb itself.

Saw this open on the 'puter. I drank the whole bottle of wine. Wife was gonna make this recipe with it. Terrible cook. Better I drank it first.

I cooked the onions first and eliminated the rosemary. I used loin lamb chops and they were absolutely delicious. The sauce reduced just enough to thicken a little and added marvelous flavor. I think adding mushrooms would further enhance this dish. With the leftover chops, I made a lamb stew that was sensational!

This is an easy, DELICIOUS recipe. You won't be disappointed. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved. The sauce has so many great flavors!

I found the sauce in this recipe to be greasy and bland. If I make this dish again, I will cook the onions separately from the lamb chop, in a saucepan. I will then add the garlic and vinegar, saving the wine for last, using it to deglaze the pan. That should help the greasiness problem. If there is still not enough oomph to the sauce, I will play with the wine and balsamic vinegar levels.

Good, tasty there's just something about rosemary that whenever I use it I wished I used less. Sauce doesn't complement the lamb it overpowers. And I usually love A LOT of sauce!

This was quick, easy, and delish! I used turkey chops (yes TURKEY chops! Shady Brook makes them) instead of lamb chops and it came out wonderful! I'll definitely add this to my repetoire.

Fast and good--a nice, different way to make lamb chops. Watch carefully to be sure the onions don't burn. I used regular raisins and balsamic vinegar in this dish, and added several thickly sliced cremini mushrooms when I added the garlic. I would definitely make this again.

This was an easy and relatively quick recipe with quality results. I reduced the liquid but not to a glaze next time I'll follow the directions.

I think that the person who made the first comment must have made a mistake - unless lamb can swim !!!
