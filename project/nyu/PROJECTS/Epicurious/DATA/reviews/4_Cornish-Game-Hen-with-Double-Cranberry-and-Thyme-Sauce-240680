The hen was delicious. I brined it for two hours before hand and it came out really perfectly cooked and tender. But had a problem with sauce. It was so unbelievably tart! I I subbed in white wine for the white grape like everyone said, but I think where I went wrong was in the cranberry juice. I couldn't find the frozen concentrate, so I boiled down some cranberry juice from concentrate until it got thick....think this is why it was too tart? No on else seems to say the sauce was tart, so don't do as I did!

Worth making again! My husband and I tested this recipe for an upcoming dinner party. We brined the birds for about 4 hours before cooking in kosher salt and fresh thyme. Next time we will brine for about 12 hours to allow more absorption of flavors. We burned the birds a bit while searing, although I think the heat on it was a bit too high. Next time I'll use a medium high heat and keep a closer eye on birds instead of following the 4 minute directions. I had no problems slathering the butter mixture on the birds, but I did make sure the birds were good and dry and the butter nice and soft. For the sauce I substituted white wine for the grape juice and I couldnt find the cranberry concentrate so I boiled down 100% cranberry juice which came out fine. The sauce was very good and the flavors with the birds were delicious. We are glad we tested the recipe first and plan to make it for our dinner party.

Where to start? The main entree in our annual Valentine's Day dinner, the one where we go all out. Brined the birds in water, white wine, salt, brown sugar, allspice and pepper for 24 hours before cooking. While searing off the birds I had to go in two batches. Probably would either go medium heat or less time or maybe a combo of butter and canola oil as there were several burned bits rather than brown. I'll have to experiment as I'd definitely do this recipe again. This recipe is for two and we had eight coming so I quadrupled it. Found that I didn't really need to for the sauce ingredients. Doubling it to serve 8 would have been fine and it was a long boil down process for the sauce. Also subbed a pinot gris for the grape juice more because I had one open than any other reason. Good, not great the way I fixed it pretty well following the recipe. Just need to find the right searing time. Otherwise the recipe is good as written.

What a great recipe! I made it for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I used wine instead of juice, as suggested, and cut down on the sugar a bit, and used bottled juice concentrate. Make sure to ask the your store or butcher to half and debone. Tons easier!!

An explosion of flavor in my mouth. So moist and tender. I made this as an alternative to Turkey and Ham for this Thanksgiving. I also made it kosher for my guests. I am not an experienced chef but I found the recipe easy to follow and learned a lot of tricks to making things taste like a restaurant (butter). My suggested modifications: Served 6 with 3 hens and doubling the recipe. White Wine instead of grape juice Corn Starch instead of Flower Margarine instead of butter (rubbed under the skin makes it stick better) Will probably make the sauce and try it on other dishes.

I found this recipe while looking for a way to use up some leftover cranberry juice and fresh cranberries. I admit I had to deviate from the recipe to achieve my goal but the result was excellent. I reduced 3 cups of unsweetened cranberry juice to substitute for the cocktail concentrate, added whole fresh cranberries and sugar while boiling, and used wine instead of grape juice. I still added the dried cranberries as instructed. The thyme butter for the hens was amazing and the sauce was extraordinarily rich and flavorful. Served with mushroom rice pilaf, shallot haricot vert and sautéed fingerling potatoes it got rave reviews from a surprise dinner guest. Ill make again for the holidays.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner with wild mushroom risotto, and ginger cashew green beans (all from Epicurious!). Dinner was a hit and so were my little chickens! I found that there was a lot more sauce than I needed for one hen, so I will probably half the sauce next time. This recipe would be great on chicken breasts as well, which my boyfriend has already requested!

This was delicious and the meat was cooked perfectly--tender but not pink. I substituted the wine for the grape juice per suggestions from others. I did use flour, but found I had to add cornstarch anyway, as others had suggested, in order to get the sauce to thicken enough to serve.

This recipe was easy to make. Used wine instead of the grape juice. And I used real cranberries, smashed them, instead of dried. Turned out really fabulous. I think I seared it longer than recipe called for. I made the sauce like my mom's gravy but I think next time I'll adhere to the recipe a bit more on that piece.

I enjoyed this dish. I did have trouble with the butter sticking to the hen. However, I decided to place the butter on the pan, let it melt, place the hens skin down and rub them with the melted butter....it turned out perfect. The sauce was delicious not too tart not too sweet, I did use wine instead of grape juice. Hens were juicy and cooked in the 20 minutes, I covered them and rested for another 20 or so to finish cooking.

I thought this was very good. I tripled the sauce for three hens and had leftovers. I used the flour to thicken and it worked just fine. Also used white wine instead of the grape jusice.I thought it was a little too sweet and might add balsamic vinegar next time. Added some to the leftovers and it seemed to cut the sweetness.

Made this for New Years and it is excellent. Used white wine instead of grape juice and cornstarch instead of flour. Wonderful sauce. Made for eight people, which was a bit messy during the searing. Definately use a splatter screen!! Will make again for sure.

I doubled this dish and made it for 4. It was really excellent. The only change I made was to add a few splashes of dry white wine. It took a few minutes more to reduce it but that was no problem. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is a wonderful holiday dish...showy and tastes delicious. I will definitely be making it again.

A very sofisticated and delicious departure from a traditional turkey dinner (and it is fast and easy!) for a small group. Added some white wine to the sauce in place of some of the grape juice to cut some of the sweetness.

This dish is simply sublime. The sauce is out of this world. I read all the reviews and made the following adjustments, all of which worked very well: 1. Cornstarch instead of flour for the sauce. 2. White wine instead of grape juice for the sauce. 3. Tripled, rather than quadruple, the sauce ingredients for 4 hens, and that was plenty. 4. Let the butter reach room temp before mixing the ingredients to spread on the hens. That made the process very easy. Be patient in reducing the sauce, it will get there.

I made this for a dinner party about a week ago. It was my first experience using cornish game hens but it was so delicious and easy to make that I will definitely be cooking with them again. Our guests commented that this would be a perfect recipe to use for a holiday meal when only two people will be dining together. I especially liked the quick cooking time. The only downside is that they are a bit messy to eat, however, that was a minor issue compared to the easy prep and delicious flavor.

I substituted regular grape juice for white and it turned out great. My only issue was that the butter mixture was hard to apply to the game hen. Other then that it the flavors were out of this world.

EXCELLENT. Super juicy and the sauce was delicious. I put a lemon inside as recommended by another reviewer and both birds came out gorgeously...don't hesitate on this one - simple ingredients and very straightforward directions, I'm a huge huge fan!!

made these hens last night for valentine's day, and we were totally satisfied...I used white wine instead of grape juice as someone had suggested and a bit more of the flour/butter combo to thicken the sauce...it could not have been better! Served with potato gnocchis with three cheeses (goat, ricotta and grated romano mixed with about a teaspoon of thyme and lots of black pepper) and asparagus steamed with red onion and garlic, then topped with rice wine vinagrette, crumbled roquefort cheese and diced fresh tomato -- beautiful and delicious!!! This recipe is a definite keeper.

Made this with a 7lb chicken instead of Cornish hens, in order to serve more people. Still, the sauce is scrumptious - not too sweet, and super easy. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

This was a good and easy recipe. I differed it by serving the hens whole and simply spooning the sauce over them for presentation. It made the prep a lot easier. The cranberries plumped up more than expected while cooking.

Quadrupled this recipe to serve eight for Thanksgiving. Everyone raved, Added about a quarter cup of sherry to the sauce. This will become a staple for fall and winter entertaining.

OMG!!! I've made this 3 times now and it continues to be a crowd pleaser. This time, I figured out the secret to thickening the sauce: I used Cornstarch instead of flour. I also took a reviewers idea and served the hen OVER polenta (with 4oz. of goat cheese added). WOW! The goat cheese complimented the cranberry sauce perfectly...add green beans with Shitaki mushrooms and you have a Bon Appetit style main course. This plates up BEAUTIFULLY!!!! It somehow seemed Rustic Italian with the Polenta and a fine Italian red wine.....

My husband says this is the best recipe for game hen we have ever tried. I would allow more time for prep than was given for the recipe. Gulfport, MS

Excellent and elegant. Also economical - - I bought 2 smalls hens at the grocery store for $6.00. This recipe is so good, I would recommend uping the serving size - - my husband and I easily ate 1 hen apeice. It took a little longer than 4 minutes to brown in the skillet and I only baked them in the oven for 15 minutes. The sauce did take longer than stated to reduce. The sweet tartness of the cranberries was perfect. The skin was also nice and crisp. I served this with the 'creamy polenta' recipe and steamed French green beans. My husband remarked that it was another gourmet meal.

I made this for our New Year's day dinner and boy was it a hit. My husband asked if we could have this instead of Chicken all of the time. The sauce takes a little longer to cook down than the recipe indicates. Next time I will make ahead and reheat. Enjoy!

My family loved this meal! I used raspberry flavored cranberries in the sauce. I served the hens with an herbed rice and green beans. They thought I was in the kitchen forever. This was an easy meal and very elegant to serve.

I also had a hard time keeping the butter mixture on the skin (I did substitute chicken breasts for cornish hens). Suggestions anyone? I'm thinking the skin needs to be totally dry?? Otherwise, an easy dish. I also substituted grape juice for apple and it was fine.

Most Excellent! Made it for Christmas dinner for my family. My only problem was getting the butter/sugar/thyme mixture to "rub-on and stay-on" the hens. I ended up just putting the mixture in the pan to melt and then adding the hens to brown. A "thumbs up" in my house!

I increased the butter mixture by 50% because I used 2--2 lb. boneless pork sirloin roasts. Only other thing I changed was the roasting time--roasted them for 45 minutes at 400 degrees. TOTALLY SCRUMPTIOUS with mashed potatoes and a salad as a very simple Christmas dinner.

I just made this for Christmas dinner and it was AMAZING! I cooked for the whole family, so I ended up making 5 hens and quadrupling the butter/sugar/thyme mixture. I doubled the sauce recipe because it seemed like a recipe for one hen wouldn't cut it; it really would have. We only used about 1/2 of the sauce. The hens came out tender and delicious. There is really nothing that I would change -- I thought it was phenomenal.

Excellent recipe and easy to make.Even my husband, who thinks Cornish game hens are a waste of time, loved this.I served it with Mashed Potato and Goat Cheese Gratin from the December 2000 Bon Appetit issue, and with the Spinach Salad with Apples, Avocado and Bacon from this site - a great meal.

Delicious. Made exactly according to the recipe. Never had cooked cornish hens and it was surprisingly easy - after pan searing them they do look dark, but after roasting they were very moist. Plated up beautifully, served atop goat cheese polenta and wilted swiss chard with pancetta.

Phenomenal. I usually don't substitute the first time I make a recipe, but I made this with quail as there was no Cornish hen to be had the day I went shopping. It was so good!

This was my first time cooking game hens. Made this last night for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I used 4 whole hens for a larger party and cooked them whole for fear that they'd be too dry. Seared both the breast side and backs, then baked them for 35 min at 450 and they were VERY moist. I split the hens through the bones once they rested and they halved very easily with just a knife. Looked fancy but was very easy to make.

We liked the sauce but not a big fan of game hens. They tend to be a little dry. Would love to try it with other meat. You really need all the brown bits after searing to make the sauce taste good.
