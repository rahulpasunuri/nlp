Loved it. It was bright and tangy and gorgeous to look at. It's also one of the few dips that work with a holiday health plan. I will definitely make it again.

I didn't like the consistency of this dip and added mayo to make it creamier and cut the sweetness. People ate it but no one raved. I wouldn't make it again.

Nothing special although I didnt use it with bread where I think it will work best. Terrible with vegetables!!!

Made 3 times in 1 week. Didn't have molasses (we don't have it here) so I used 3 Tbs of pomegranate syrup which is as common here as molasses is in the States. Thought it was delicious. I roasted the peppers on my gas grill and it was ready in no time.
