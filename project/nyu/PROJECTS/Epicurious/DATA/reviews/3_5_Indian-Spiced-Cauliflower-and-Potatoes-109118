Did this without the potatoes and it came out well.

This was delicious even with a number of missing ingredients. I didn't have potatoes, jalapeno or cumin seeds and I substituted coconut oil. Otherwise I made the recipe as written and it was wonderfully flavourful and spicy enough for my palate. Very simple and will definitely make again!

This was an excellent and easy recipe. I did increase the jalapeno since I like it spicy and I highly highly recommend subbing chicken broth for the water. I also think the lemon adds a lot to the dish so I would definitely include it.

Delicious! I used sweet potatoes and added a can of chickpeas to the mix and served it over quinoa seasoned with lemon. Great meal!

This was terrific, as others stated. I used sweet potatoes and kept the spices as written. (I would have increased them if I read the reviews first, since I like spicy food, but it's definitely not necessary.) My only change would be to CUT THE OIL. 5 T in four servings is pretty heavy. I think I'll spray the veggies next time with cooking spray and maybe cut back the oil in the pan by half.

I have tried a number of different recipes for this dish over the years and none were quite right. This one was amazing.

This is delicious. Spicy and good. I used a serrano pepper rather than a jalapeno as it was all I had on hand. Also forgot to preheat the roasting pan, so ended up roasting the cauliflower and potato for an extra 5 minutes. Came out great. Served as a vegetarian meal with a poached egg on top. Can't wait to make it again.

Wow - very pleasantly surprised by the wonder flavor. The potatoes really compliment the cauliflower. Would make again!

This turned about to be a fabulous dish. We made the recipe as instructed and had enough for 3 meals (a side for 2 people) and did not tire of it. The only thing I did different was use russet potatoes and a whole jalapeno which may have been a little more than 2 tsp. It was worth the effort of roasting the vegetables and pulling together all the spices.

This is so delicious. It rivals the alu kauli I can find at the local Indian restaurants. Makes an amazing accompaniment to any Indian-style dinner. Don't forget to really get those onions nice and deeply caramelized, and try to not burn your veggies, and you will be a happy camper. I also highly suggest toasting your own spices and grinding them yourself.

I eyeballed the spices as so many others, definitely used more than called for. Also added some coconut milk and canned diced tomatoes - just seemed that it would be better with some liquid. Served with basmati rice.Very tasty.

I made this recipe, but by chopping everything and roasting it all together, without the water and half of the recipe. It still turned out delicious. If you want to be lazy like me, just mix it all together in a roasting dish, and roast it for about 30 minutes.

Excellent! Good flavor, very hearty. I used a medium-sized cauliflower, and it yielded much more than 4 servings...closer to 8, I would say. I also added peas at the end for a little color and sweetness.

I made this dish last night for my g/friends along with a butter chicken (found at another site) and cilantro coconut rice and they raved about everything. My one guest said she didn't think cauliflower could taste so good. I made the recipe as is and found the flavours perfect.

All I have to say is...SCRUMPTIOUS!! I will make this dish over and over again! I added a bit of yogurt to the to and some fresh parsley. DO, try this recipe. You wont be disappointed!

This was perfectly spiced. I used regular baking potatoes insted of Yukon Gold, so the baking time took about 5 minutes longer than the recipe specified. I did everything else as directed. I served it with curried cod from another site and whole wheat parathas.

Oh this was delicious. Cooked up perfectly and all the spices were a beautiful combination. I did use extra as some other reviewers suggested. I would make this again - definitely!

I had high hopes for this recipe and was sadly disappointed. I would be giving 2.5 forks if possible...I'm used to Indian food having such exciting flavors that this paled in comparison to just about every other Indian dish I've made/ordered. I made exactly as the recipe stated but I should have listened to the other reviewers and doubled the spices because it turned out so bland despite looking so fabulous. It has potential so I will be making again with a few changes: 1) Nuke the potatoes for a few minutes before roasting so they finish at the same time as the cauliflower (or omit them all together), 2) Double the spices...maybe add the first half as directed and the second half when I add the roast veggies to the onion mixture, 3) I added peas to the final few minutes to add a pop of color and they were a great addition; will keep those next time. Hopefully the next round will be better.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Like many vegetarian dishes, it tends toward the bland. Have extra spices and flavorful things on hand to give it some life. I made it with the potatoes, and I thought the potatoes were important. One tip: Make sure you cut the potatoes small enough so that they cook thoroughly. Better to have the potatoes overcooked than undercooked in this recipe, as biting into an undercooked potato chunk is not pleasant.

Made this recipe tonight, and it was delicious (albeit it took longer than 30 minutes from start to finish!). I also used ground cumin in place of seeds and added a sprinkling of mustard seeds to the cauliflower and potatoes before roasting. Served with basmati rice, it makes a filling (and economical) side.

I made this last night and it was AMAZING. I forgot to buy ginger, unfortunately, so it may have thrown the intended flavor off a bit, but it was still really really really good. I think I'll be making this on a regular basis.

Delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. Note that start to finish time does not seem to include the about 15-20 mins it takes to chop all of the vegetables.

This is a good recipe. However, I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices which I think was unnecessary - the flavors were too strong. Next time I'll follow the recipe as is.

Recipe is a bit off. Cook potatoes and cauliflower 5-10 min longer in oven. Good spice mixture tho. I'll try a different but similar recipe next time.

I love indian food and this was very good. I added mustard seeds before the onions and took the advice of the cook from Minnesota and added & dbl'd the spices after the oninos had started to become translucent. I think it would be quite bland as written. We had it with Trader Joes garlic naan it was so so.

This is one of my favorite Indian side dishes. I love the caramelized flavors that roasting the veggies brings. I do agree with some reviewers that the level of spice is too timid. I double all of the spices and the garlic, ginger and jalapeno as well. Even with that the spice level is less than what you would find with this same dish in an Indian restaurant. I disagree with the instructions to cook the garlic, ginger and jalapeno with the onions 8 to 10 min. The garlic gets too bitter and browns much faster than the onion. I like to cook the onions in the oil until they are starting to get golden and then I add the garlic, ginger and jalapeno for the last 2-3 minutes. I also like to add some peas before covering and cooking the last 5 minutes.

Just had a dinner party and my friend made this dish. It was so delicious I decided to make it tonight. I used ginger garlic paste along with some fresh garlic - very very good! :)

This is an awesome recipe! I don't know why someone said it was too boring for them...My husband said it was the best cauliflower he ever tasted and he doesn't normally like indian food that much!! Ha! I didn't have fresh jalopenos so I diced some canned, and I didn't have fresh ginger so I used a tablespoon of puree. YUM!

This is a great recipe! I used Russet potatoes rather than Yukon Gold, 1/2 teaspoon of dried cumin instead of cumin seeds, chicken stock in place of water, and probably only a total of 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil. I served it with spicey honey chicken wings and jasmine rice. I think this would go very well with basmati rice and naan. Yummy!

We were "assigned" this recipe as part of our gourmet dinner group and weren't so sure about it! It was really delicious. We skipped the cumin seeds and just added 1/2 tsp of ground cumin in its place which worked out fine. Very, very good!

Used sesame oil and red skinned potatoes. Wonderful aroma, delicious.

My husband loved this dish - paired it with basmati rice and tandoori chicken (chicken breast marinated with plain yogurt garam masala and tandoori spice mix from indian market). I used chicken broth instead of water and salted throughout for more taste.

Very good the way it's written and not tough to do. We doubled it and had as our main course. I might add a handful of chopped, dried apricots, cilantro and a squeeze of lemon at the end--but otherwise, great.

Have made this tasty dish many times with combinations of cauliflower, potatoes, yams, & onions. It's not too spicy, but it's not bland at all- very flavorful. Reheats beutifully & maybe better the next day.

This was a great way to make vegetables. I made it in conjunction with the baked rice on this site. With the rice dish I wanted to go without the potatoes in this recipe. I substituted the potatoes for butternut squash and it was super good. I would recommend everyone try it this way. Enjoy

I made this nearly exactly as written (the only change I made was to use Sriracha chili sauce instead of fresh chile because I didn't have one), and it was excellent. Nice full, deep flavors, and gorgeous color. Pretty easy to make as well. I made this to go along mussels in thai red curry for a casual pan-Asian dinner party. Loved by all.

I would make this again, but with a few changes. I think the recipe callled for too much oil - I might even use sesame oil instead of vegatable, and use half the recommended amount. I also would add chicken broth instead of water at the end of the recipe. But over all it was very good, and a wonderful accompaniment to the tandoori leg of lamb on this site.

This was going to accompany tandoori chicken, but time was short, so I used it as an omelette filling. Delicious. Served it with whole grain bread, a salad of diced tomatoes, cucumbers and mint, and apricot chutney. Lovely.

I made this recipe as written, except I added salt to taste at every step. It was fantastic. The potatoes were creamy and perfectly cooked through, the cauliflower tender with just the right amount of browning, and the entire dish was well spiced, balanced, and not overwhelming. Next time I might try to use less oil, but really, it was great as written.

I tried this recipe today. I (like the rest of the country am doing the low-carb thing) left out the potatoes decreased the oil by 1 tbsp when roasting the cauliflower. I added 1/2 tbsp of lime juice feeling that would bring the rest of the flavors through. The jury is still out on that. I'm going to serve this dish as a side when I try another epicurious recipe moroccan chix with lentils. I will definately make this again.

I followed this recipe nearly exactly as written. I did however cook potatoes and cauliflower on separate sheets because they never seem to roast to perfection in the same length of time. The recipe lacked flavor and the visual appeal was less than ideal. I'd really only consider this recipe if I was in a pinch for what to do with cauliflower.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe stated (hey, first time for everything) and I loved it. Maybe add a little bit more jalapeno next time.

Since our head of cauliflower weighed almost twice what was called for, we also went with the low-carb option and it tasted great. (It was served as a side to Sheila Lukins' Luscious Chopped Steak from this site, which was also excellent!)

I have always wondered how to make stuff like this, but never really tried a recipe. I made this last night and threw in only one potato and brussel sprouts to cut the carbs. I love spice, so I also added a tsp of curry. It is great! I couldn't stop eating it! Can't wait to have leftovers at lunch.

Rating: 4
This was super easy to make and really only took the 30 min that the recipe claims it will take. Usually, I spend at least twice as much time making a meal as the recipe says I will. I didn't have fresh jalapenos or ginger, so I used jalapeno sauce and dried ginger, and bought naan from a local restaurant. It was terrific. I will definitely be making this more often.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe but omitted the potatoes and didn't have the cumin seeds. Be careful opening your oven door, lots of steam.

Wonderful! I omitted the potatoes, and used 1 large head of cauliflower. Mixed all of the ingredients (cut back on the oil to 1-2 TB) except the water and cooked about 20 mins, then added the water (a little less than called for) at the very end. My husband and I polished off all of it!! Beautiful color, too. Will definately make again.

It's a bit spicier than what I would normally eat but I'd say that the heat is on par for most Indian dishes. I used an Asian hot sauce instead of the jalapeno and next time I make it I'll probably cut it back by half. A different and good way to prepare cauliflower.

I loved this recipe! i made it without the potatoes though (because of the carbs), but added green beans to the sauce and had it as a main course with nan bread. It was a lot of work making it though, because of all the mincing involved.

I have been improvising a version of this recipe all winter, using cauliflower and brussels sprouts - no potatoes - and just cannot get enough of it. Yes, as other reviewers state, the sweetness and nuttiness that comes from roasting these vegetables is a total transformation that delights the palate. I toss the vegetables with olive oil and all the other ingredients and roast them that way - no second step involved.

Rating: 3
This dish is really quite wonderful. I've roasted practically every other vegetable before, but hadn't tried roasting cauliflower since I've never been a huge fan. Like brussels sprouts, raosting changes the nature of this vegetable completely, bringing out a delicate nuttiness and sweetness that you'd never guess is there. The only change I made was cutting back on the cayenne slightly, and using more cauliflower, but no potatoes, just b/c I wanted to see what the cauliflower was like just by itself. My friend Julie who is Indian says this is authentically Indian, but not Southern Indian.

Can one person really eat a whole head of cauliflower plus potatoes and all that other stuff?? Yes, she can and she did and it was good. Just now I am finishing up some golden bits of potato and onion redolent with curry flavors and a bit hot (jalapeno pepper WITH the seeds).
