Interesting concept, but it didn't quite work for me. I wanted to like it, but it was too much chili in my dessert. If it followed just the right main course, it might be just the thing for a summer dessert, but here it is October. It got me thinking that I might like this raspberry/ancho chili combo in a salad dressing if I could work out how to do it. And trying to peel the skin from the ancho was not worth the effort. I didn't settle on a workable technique before I gave up. Even though I don't rate it highly, it certainly is different.
