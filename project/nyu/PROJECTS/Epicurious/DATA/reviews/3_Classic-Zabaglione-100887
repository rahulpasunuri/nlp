awful! the measurements are completely off. had to start over and use marcella hazan's recipe -- 4 yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup (yes believe me) dry marsala.

I'm , giving this 3 forks because I made it with Grand Marnier, not marsala, but it was very delicious... and soooooo rich! (And since I'm allergic to dairyit was nice finding a good custard with no milk.) I served over some berries cooked with sugar, vanilla, Grand Marnier and tapioca -- the zabaglione was so rich I'll try it next time over fresh fruit, though, so guests don't collapse *too* helplessly at the table.

Turned out very well. I didn't have Marsala so I subbed some expensive LBV port. Thought it would have too much sugar but all worked out well. Forget the 140 degree part, just do it for 5-6 mintues and it should turn out fine. Very easy.

We and our guests loved this. I served it over a mixture of strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, marinated in a little marsala. A delicious light dessert. But don't you mean 4-5 minutes preparation time? That's about right.

Try this variation: blend zabaglione with unsweet whipped cream; layer chocolate cake soaked in espresso with zabaglione/whip cream mix in a trifle dish (you can vary the ratio of espresso-soaked cake with zabaglione/whip cream to your own taste), and serve. The Marsala taste is no longer too strong, as it's tempered by the chocolate and espresso.

This recipe looked nice while I was cooking it, but it never made it to 140 degrees by my thermometer. I finally gave up and served it. I thought it was too sweet and tasted too much of Marsala. I think next time I will fold in an equal amount of unsweetened whipped cream.

Delicieux! Loved it. I found cooking it to 140 to be a bit tricky... that's pretty hot and some of it started sticking to the sides of the bowl...anyway, it is definitely a lovely sauce on strawberries. Yum!

Saw Ishbel make this on TV last week. Looked simple and a natural to complement the fresh fruit for our dessert. Not only is this an easy sauce to make, it's incredibly quick to prepare and complimentary to the fresh berries over which I poured it. I had this done in about 6 minutes. Try it. You'll like it, I gar-on-tee.
