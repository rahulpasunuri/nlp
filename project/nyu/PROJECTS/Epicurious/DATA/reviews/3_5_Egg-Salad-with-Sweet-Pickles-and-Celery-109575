Loved this, and I don't particularly like egg salad usually. I made this to try to get my son to eat some protein. The tarragon and sweet pickles were great together! Confession: I used all the egg yolks and used regular mayo, so your results may vary a bit.

This recipe has great ingredients, but I'm amazed no one seems to know this trick my Mom taught me to make egg salad creamier: http://imunchie.com/food-art/munchies/classic-egg-salad

This egg salad is delicious. My husband doesn't even like egg salad and he ate this for dinner and took it for lunch the next day. The sweet of the pickles with the sharper onion flavors and the tarragon work great together. We are not dijon mustard fans so I used regular and it was great. Highly recommended, quick, easy, and vegetarian! Served it on pretzel batards with just a slice of romaine. A great summer sandwich with corn on the cob on the side and heirloom tomatoes!

Absolutely delicious! I added a little bit of chipotle tabasco sauce and it really went well with the creamy egg salad. Fantastic!

Great, easy recipe. I used pickle relish instead of sweet pickles and added a pinch of paprika.

Although I liked the taste of all the vegetables, I thought it was a little overpowering. I would use half the celery and only one of the onions.

This was a wonderful dish. Like some of the others, I did not have tarragon so I omitted that. I added some chopped cilatro, mint and a dash of cyanne for a little kick. My family loved it!

we loved this dish we added about a half a teaspoon of fresh garlic and put basil instead of taragon because we didnt have any but it was really really great.

Used regular Hellman's mayo & left all egg yolks in. Used dried tarragon. Forgot the green onions & tasted good but when added egg salad was even better. Excellent recipe which went into my collection.

This was delicious. I left out the tarragon because I didn't have any. It was great without it.

Loved this recipe. We found it light and delicious. Omitted the sweet pickles. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe, but I also would leave in all the egg yolks.

This was a good egg salad recipe. I've been tossing out egg yolks for years and didn't miss them in this recipe. For those that might be sensitive to cholesterol or (like me) not like the texture of cooked yolks, a good substitute (I've found) is to mash up chickpeas. Chickpeas + yogurt + garlic + spices is a fantastic deviled egg filler, by the way.

Sounded interesting, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I did not delete a portion of the egg yolks - used 7 whole eggs. My husband is the egg salad afficionado here, and turned up his nose. Our usual dressing is low fat mayo, a bit of Dijon, celery seed, parsley, a pinch of curry powder, s&p.
