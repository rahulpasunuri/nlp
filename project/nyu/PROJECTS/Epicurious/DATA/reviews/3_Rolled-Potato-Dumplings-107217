First I must say that I'm disappointed that anyone rated these a gnocchi! It's a false reduction in the ratings, which will prevent others from trying these. Secondly, these are wonderful, incredibly easy German dumplings! Follow the recipe exactly (even down to the amount of water/salt for poaching), and they'll come out beautifully. After poaching, they keep well in the refrigerator if you want to reheat and brown in butter later.

To all who call these gnocchi - they're not. German dumplings (or czech knedliky, as I call them) are different than gnocchi and are meant to be served w/ heavy roasted meats. but your gnocchi recipe looks great, nonethelss - I think I'll try it next time I try to make them.

If these are too heavy for you using the Artochokes review, try replacing the potatoes with ricotta cheese.

To Artochokes: Few people on this website don't know what gnocchi is, and instant potatoes....are you kidding?? I have decided the perfect gnocchi are learned, not described in a recipe. I am still trying. These were a tad heavy for my taste, but the kids loved them, so I'll do them again. The best gnocchi in the US are at Biba in Sacramento; wish I could get it right like her. I also think the refridgeration perod was nothing but hype.

My family calls these potato dumplings "gnocchi", (pronounced NYAW'-kee). I'll give you my EASY tried and true version because I feel I owe the folks at this site a great yet simple recipe. Here it is: In a large soup pan, heat 3 CUPS OF FILTERED WATER and 2 AND 1/2 TEASPOONS OF SALT. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add 1 AND 1/3 CUPS INSTANT POTATO FLAKES. Stir in 6 CUPS OF FLOUR. Then turn out of the pan and knead for a few minutes. Be careful. The dough will be warm at first, but cools very quickly as you work with it. Shape the dough into an oval loaf. Slice a piece of dough from the end of loaf and roll into a snake shape. With a knife dipped in flour every now and then, cut into pillow shapes about an inch long. Sprinkle a little flour off to the side of your working surface, and slide finished dumplings onto the flour to keep them from sticking. That's it! You've made them. (These pillows can be shaped into ghocchi if desired, by using the tongs of a fork to roll them or by using your index and middle fingers to drag the pieces of dough into a different shape.) Drop these gnocchi all at once into boiling, salted water. Stir so that they don't stick. When water returns to a boil, lower to a simmer. They're done cooking when they begin to float. Drain by pouring into a colander. Serve immediately with any type of pasta sauce or butter and plenty of FRESHLY GRATED ROMANO CHEESE. Or, fry in butter and onions until lightly browned and top with a sharp cheese. This makes enough for 3 entrees. It is fast, and only one pan gets used. This is one of my all time favorite recipes for flavor, ease and satisfaction.

I have done this 2 seperate times now. And I prefer no refrigeration. With the second time I did a little alteration to the recipe... I used a can of *Del Monte Whole New Potatoes. With this it was less time consuming and tasted just as great. And I needed no 4 hour refrigeration process.

I expected this to be quite tough and it was. First of all I don't see how one large potato can be enough for 4 people - I thought it hardly enough for two. Secondly, I did cool the potato for 4 hours, but after that it was quite difficult to mash; it remained a bit lumpy, so I had to use a substantial amount of flour, resulting in a floury taste. A pity, yet I'm going to try it again (with 2 potatoes) in the hope of a better result. The recipe in itself seems quite good to me.

I have made lots of potatoe dumplings in my years and I feel this is the lightest dumpling I have ever made. I decided to use my left over mashed potatoes and this recipe worked very nicely. I thought the dumplings were very light, and soft with a nice crispness on the outside. This will become my standard dumpling recipe from now on!
