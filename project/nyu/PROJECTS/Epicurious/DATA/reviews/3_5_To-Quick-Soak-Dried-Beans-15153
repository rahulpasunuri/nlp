I think hollyepic may have misunderstood this "recipe." Quick soaking is NOT a way to cook dried beans, but rather a technique for getting them READY to cook. Often dried beans are soaked in water overnight to soften them a bit before cooking. The quick-soak method does the same thing, but faster. It's particularly handy when you've forgotten to soak the beans overnight (as my wife did today), or when you decide at the last minute to make something using dried beans. Regardless of which way you do it, the beans still require about an hour of simmering (sometimes more, especially if they're old) to be completely cooked and soft enough to enjoy.

Certainly did not work for me using dried red kidney beans. I didn't even keep track of how long it took, but I kept giving it another 15 minutes, anotehr 15 minutes, another 15 minutes. My husband agreed with me that they still weren't done. I don't see how beans could possibly be considered done after only the hour that this recipe suggests.

Unable to read it as "IN RESOURCES" orange box covers half of it... Can you fix that?

This recipe is very good. It is easy to prepare, which is important to me. It can be used as a vegetarian recipe. My daughter is vegetarian and this is an important issue for me. The taste is quite nice and smooth. I would make this again often. Goes nice with salad and crusty bread.

This is an ok technique, but I generally do this AND soak over night(The beans that is). Depending on the beans the levelof success will vary.
