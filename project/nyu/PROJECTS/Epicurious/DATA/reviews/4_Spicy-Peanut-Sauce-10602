This, along with the herb spring rolls, is one of the things my daughter always wants me to make for her when she's home from college. I leave the tomato paste out completely cause it sounded gross to me, and I have reduced the amount of oil as well, since PB is pretty oily anyway. I have yet to serve this to someone who didn't like it.

I forgot to mention, having tried several brands of pre-made hoisin sauce, that Lee Kum Kee is the best tasting one available from my grocer (and has the best ingredient listing). I've also made hoisin from scratch in the past for other recipes and it is a million times better, but for this type of recipe, the jar is just fine.

Really yummy - served it as a dipping sauce with summer rolls. I took some of the advice of other reviewers - subbed coconut milk for water and chili-garlic sauce for tomato paste; I also used more peanut butter. This does make a LOT of sauce and I kind of regret doubling it, but I'm sure I can water it down a bit to make a sauce for rice noodles and steamed broccoli or something. Beware that using coconut milk results in a VERY thick sauce, esp when cooled, so you may need to add some more water if you make this substitution.

YUM! This is a great simple sauce that transforms a meal. I've made it multiple times. I'm not totally sure how necessary the sugar and amount of vegetable oil is needed, I've adjusted these amounts somewhat with favorable results. Regardless, fabulous- my fiance loves it!

Fantastic! The best I've ever made. Followed suggestions for garlic chili sauce instead of the tomato paste. No hot pepper flakes. I did not add sugar. Oh and I followed suggestion of coconut milk instead of water which is what I think was the tipping point from good to fantastic!

Very tasty. Since my peanut butter was plain (just ground peanuts) I added a pinch of salt and and extra 1/2 tsp of sugar.

From review below I also added 2 tsp of grated ginger. TIP: I SAW A TIP ONLINE TO PEEL FRESH GINGER AND FREEZE IT AND IT GRATES REALLY EASILY!

I used this as a base for a peanut sauce. I used 4 garlic cloves, replaced the pepper flakes and tomato paste with almost a tbsp of chilli paste. I didn't have hoisin sauce (sadly) so I used soy sauce to taste, 2-3 tbsp. I used honey instead of sugar and added water to thickness desired. I only used about 1/4 c. I also added a squeeze of fresh lime juice, Everyone loved it and was defnitely spicy.

Easy, super quick....I used almond butter instead of peanut butter and skipped the sugar. Also added a dollop of black bean garlic sauce inspired from the reviews....tossed it with soba noodles and broccoli. Delish!

Recipe is good for a basic peanut sauce, but I agree with the other cooks, you need to add a little extra zing. I added Indian red chili powder. Also I didn't have hoisin sauce so I just used soy sauce, and instead of tomato paste used a spicy/sweet ketchup from the Indian store called "Sweet Devil".

Wonderful. Recipe made just enough for 8 spring rolls. I'll probably double it in the future so that we don't have to ration it. Also, I added a little srirracha for some extra heat and depth.

Substitute chili garlic sauce for the tomato paste and you have a winner. This is my standard peanut sauce recipe. Everyone loves it - just the right amount of kick.

I made this exactly as described except I used grapeseed oil instead of vegetable. I doubled the recipe as per a reviewer's suggestion in the herb salad spring rolls review. I had a _lot_ of sauce leftover. Nice if you're looking for leftovers, but if not, one batch is sufficient. A great recipe. I'll make it again and again.

yuk--the only people who liked this made substitutions. Smart! Flavors are so wrong together. I'm throwing it out and making similar w/chili sauce, less hoisin, more peanut and whatever else it takes to tweak it.

Delicious. Left out the tomato paste entirely and added the chili-garlic sauce sold in Asian markets. Chilled and served with fresh veggies on a tray.

Wanted to thank all the previous cooks for their input and comments on this recipe. I had to make this last-minute when I didn't have the right ingredients on hand for the peanut sauce I'd originally planned to make. This one worked wonderfully well and I also added a little more peanut butter and used chili garlic sauce instead of tomato paste. i couldn't find chili garlic paste but the sauce is probably the same thing. I cut back on the red pepper flakes because of the chili garlic sauce and it was perfect.

The garlic flavor in this recipe was a bit overwhelming so I added a bit more peanut butter. Delicious!

I made it as specified except I did use the chili garlic paste as several reviewers recommended. The first time I made it, it seemed a little sweet for my taste so I tried to cut down the sweetness by whisking in dark sesame oil. Disaster! The sauce broke and it ruined the consistency (although the flavor was fine). It was so easy to make though that I immediately tried again, following the recipe more closely (with the exception mentioned above substituting the garlic chili paste for the tomato paste). This time it was perfect. I did use extra peanut butter and slightly reduced the sugar, Easy and excellent peanut sauce!

Absolutely simple to make yet very tasty, this was a hit with us when tossed with rice noodles and a vegetable mix. The one variation I did was that I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I found it slightly on the mild side, though, as I tend to prefer sauces with a little more heat to them. Next time I make this, I will probably substitute chili oil.

I made the recipe as written (but did not reduce) and poured it over angel hair pasta, carrots, veggies and shrimp. Baked in the oven until shrimp were done. Yummm

Perfect! I had to substitute katsup for the tomato paste, as I was out, so I eliminated the sugar, added extra katsup (it is thinner), and reduced the water a bit. I could make it while holding my daughter in one arm!

I only used 2 tbls of housan suace. I also added 1 tbls of Vietnamese garlic chili sauce (in addition to the tomatoe paste). This added some nice heat. I wanted something different to bring to a picnic this summer so I took fresh green beans, cooked very crisp then shocked to chill (drain and dry with paper towels) and sweet onion sliced paper thin. I then tossed them with this sauce and garnished with unsalted dryroasted peanuts. It was a huge hit!

This is so easy and so yummy as is! Love it! I put it on long noodles with lightly sauteed broccoli, carrots, and celery. Perfect with chicken, too. I've also used crunchy peanut butter for texture and it works great. I'm intrigued by the lime and chili sauce additions, I might have to try them!

As is, it was a tad bit "hoisin-y" so I added more peanut butter. Will definitely make again, but cut hoisin a bit at the start.

Years ago I fell in love with a pricey peanut sauce from an exclusive kitchen shop. This recipe yields a sauce equal if not superior, especially since I don't have to run to the mall and shell out lots of cash. Tonight I tossed it with pasta and lightly sauteed veggies; next time I'll use it on salad with mandarin oranges and pineapple slices. I substituted the chili garlic paste as others suggested, and I think I will add just a dash rather than 1/4 tsp of red flakes next time - my adventuresome 6-year-old thought this was a tad too spicy for his palate. Otherwise, fabulous and versatile!

I loved this recipe. I used chile paste with garlic instead of the tomato paste. I served the sauce with chicken satays. The sauce was also great on jasmine rice.

I made this without modifications and loved it. I tossed it with angel hair, ground peanuts and cilantro. It would be a great dipping sauce for spring rolls.

I cannot believe this recipe received such rave reviews....after all, nobody made the ACTUAL RECIPE!

This was unbelievable! The only reason that it didn't get four forks in my book was because I substitued the chili garlic sauce for the tomato paste as per some of the previous reviews.

This is a great recipe to accompany spring roles. With a couple modification, I think we have perfected it. Use the garlic with dark sesame oil (don't overcook), substitute chili galic sauce (Lee Kum Kee) for the tomato paste, cut the peanut butter to 1 tbsp (use natural). Increase hoisin to 6 tbsp, water to 1 1/2 cup and add some corstarch to thicken by bringing to boil.

Awesome thai-peanut sauce! I've been searching forever for one, and this one is the best yet. After seeing comments, I added 1 cup of chicken broth to thin it a little, and then 1 tbsp of a Szechuan stir fry sauce, to spice it to my taste.

This peanut sauce was delicious and simple. I left out the tomato paste and added thai red curry paste instead. Perfect with the herb salad spring rolls. My brother dipped apple slices in the sauce for a totally different taste!

This is a F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C recipe. It's easy, takes very little ingredients and it tastes phenomenal (sigh, just like mom used to make). However, I did find it a bit too thick so I thinned it out with a bit of chicken stock and instead of the dried chile I used the asian brand hot sauce Spiracha (found in the asian section of any supermarket).

I thought this recipe was quite good. I also added a little bit of fresh lime juice to give it more of a kick. Very fast and easy to make.

Tasty and fast. I personally like it with Chinese chile paste instead of the hot pepper flakes, and for a spicy, interesting variant, I've substituted 1/4 cup crushed peanuts and a tablespoon or two of sesame oil for the peanut butter.

I've made all kinds of South Asian peanut sauces and some require a great deal of work. For the almost effortless preparation, this sauce is great. A real find for someone who loves satay. I made it with the accompanying Spring Rolls, and find that every time I serve the two, my guests are ecstatic and demand the recipe.

I made this recipe to go with the herb spring rolls and loved it. Soon after I went to a Vietnemese Restaraunt where a similar sauce was served with rice vermicelli noodles, mint, deep-fried tofu and grated carrots. It was a great combination.
