Great recipe! It could handle a lot more heat than suggested. I would recommend adding a teaspoon of Sriracha paste with the rest of the sauces at the end. Instead of sugar used honey. It worked out quite nicely.

Didn't go to the Asian market. So fresh tangerine, thai chilis and siracha were substituted. I cut the beef about 1/2" thick to give my self a little leeway in keeping the meat rare, worked perfectly. Was very good, but would have been better without the subs. Lots of Prep

The recipe is a little involved and takes some prep, but it's so, so worth it. Still eating my first bites and had to stop to tell everyone here how amazing it is!

I simplified the recipe and it was still great. Omitted cornstarch, chili bean starch, sugar, peppercorns & hoisin sauce. I substituted Yakisoba sauce for the hoisin sauce and added partly steamed broccoli rabe with the green onion. We loved it!

Excellent dish! My family chowed it right down! I highly recommend doubling the recipe; my family of two adults and one toddler ate nearly the whole doubled recipe with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Other alterations: I added a clove of garlic to the beef marinade, and since I didn't have rice wine, I used one part brown rice vinegar and three parts red wine. Also, I omitted the chile and chili bean sauce and used regular black pepper. The results were fantastic! :-)

Great dish with tasty flavors, but the recipe doesn't tell you whether you need to cut the tangerine peel after you've rehydrated it. Rather than adding the tangerine peels whole, I sliced them into slivers (as you do the orange peel). I served the beef with a side of rice and steamed broccoli.
