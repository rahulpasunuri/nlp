I tried this recipe last night and it's definitely a keeper! I used chili black bean sauce instead of the fermented black beans because that's what I had on hand and it was still quite tasty. I will have to try it with the fermented black beans next time. I look forward to making this recipe again soon.

I had to substitute Black Bean Sauce with Garlic - used about 2 tablespoons. We stirfried some broccoli to cook with the chicken. Though it ended up tasting yummy, it took longer to cook the wings than 15 minutes, so the broccoli ended up almost melting into the sauce. Kinda ugly, but very tasty!

It was really good and easy. I used a little Hoisin sauce instead of the black bean sauce as none was handy Will make again.
