This is worth every minute of the time and effort. I made it exactly as presented in the recipe here. Delicious and an impressive presentation!

I have been making this recipe for years - but with a few variations. The first time I made it I was going to school and prepping for exams - while trying to make it - so ver distracted. Mixed all of the filling together instead of 2 layers, added 4 more ounces of bitter chocolate along with 4 tablespoons of liquid espresso reduction - basically 1/2 cup of espresso put in a large cup and microwave for 10 minutes in 2 intervals. I missed that this was a 2 tiered cheese cake but friends love it and I kept it as is winning numerous awards. Also keep in mind that eggs go in last and should be room temperature.

This was my first cheesecake attempt ever, and everyone agreed that it was quite spectacular. Some cheescakes I've tasted can be a bit dry, but this one reminded me a bit of the fluffy insides of a decadent truffle... When I took it out of the oven, it wiggled a bit much for my comfort, and I thought for sure it would be underdone, but it turned out great, with just a few slight cracks around the edge. I thought the presentation was quite pretty, both pre-and post-slice; there was a thin layer of the sour cream topping (lightest brown) followed by a darker layer of the Kahlua/chocolate mixture(dark brown), followed by a layer of just the Kahlua mixture (medium brown). The crust, of course, was the darkest brown. The trick to keeping the layers distinct is when adding both the Kahlua/chocolate mixture and then the sour cream topping, pour it in several different places and then lightly connect and smooth them with a spatula. If you pour all of each mixture in just one spot and then spread, they will run together for a marbled look. Rather than "guilding the lily" with whipped cream and chocolate-covered espresso beans, I grated a bit of the leftover chocolate atop the sour cream frosting, which created a light/dark speckled effect.

This was my first cheesecake attempt. It was so delicious I was asked to make it again for the following holiday party. I used Teddy Grahams for the crust but other than that followed the recipe to the letter. Of course it's extremely rich but if you run ten miles after consuming a slice then it should all even out.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as the instructions state, and it was fab. Rave reviews and lots of requests for the recipe.

This is a staple in my dessert collection but here is the trick...the first time I made this I got sidetracked and instead of doing this in layers, I mixed it all up - the coffee and the chocolate part - everyone loved it and I have been making it that way ever since!

I made this cake and everybody loved it! It was very rich and a good cake to make for special occasions. I used chopped milk chocolate for the decorative garnish and served with coffee. I did not top with the sour cream frosting but did a mocha whipped cream instead. I will definitely make this again.

I never thought I'd say this, but it was a bit too chocolatey for me, too rich. However, my husband raved about it (he'd give it 3.5 stars) and our other guests who like coffee desserts also liked it.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this cheesecake since finding the recipe in the magazine in 1991. It's so easy to make and ALWAYS receives top reviews, even from finicky palates and accomplished cooks. Definitely best made at least a day ahead, and often does better with a water bath. Just a fabulous recipe.

Excellent cheesecake, easy to make, looks great and tastes better than it looks.

I have only made this once, shared it with my husband's co-workers and our Deacon and his wife and have already had 3 requests for the recipe! It is soooo good. I made it exactly according to the recipe. I don't think anything could improve it!!

This recipe is fine and I will probably make it again. I was, however, a little disappointed in the consistency of the cake--it was much less dense than a traditional cheesecake. Next time, I may decrease the number of eggs in the filling in order to maintain the density and flavor of the cream cheese. Also, I could not find chocholate wafer cookies so I used chocolate graham crackers instead and the crust turned out fine--it was actually my favorite part of the cake. Finally, in the interest of simplifying the recipe, one could definitely eliminate the sour cream topping and just make whip cream to spread across the entire top of the cake. I didnt think the sour cream topping added much to the flavor of the cake.

I think I agree with the person who found the coffee a little overwhelming so for all the work I was a little disappointed. In all fairness however I ended up not having everything because I incorrectly to added up the amounts of things needed for the various parts. So my complaint is with the organization of the recipe. I didn't have enough bittersweet chocolate so had to substitute cocoa & oil for some parts, and so on. It would be very helpful for someone disorganized like me to have one list of everything to avoid having to add the 4 parts up, then add wrong & not have what I need. And I'm not sure why the directions are listed in reverse order of how you will actually make them. I'll probably try again, but right now I agree the pumpkin one is better.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever had or ever made. I got raves on this at my holiday party.

this dessert is beautiful and delicious! i piped sweetened whipped cream around the top and center then shaved some chocolate over the top. next time i'll drizzle some "DOVE" dark chocolate ice cream topping over the top instead of the melted chocolate. it looked very professional!

YUM! this is my favorite cheesecake! when I made it, it turned out super ugly, but it looked fastastic after I topped it with sour cream to fill the enormous crater in the middle and put chocolate shaving and chocolate-covered espresso beans on top!

Disappointing in light of all the other reviews. I found the coffee taste WAY too overwhelming.I served this to 6 people, some total coffee fanatics. No one was wowed. Some found the sour cream topping "too tangy". I myself didn't love it and I love both coffee flavor and cheesecake. I got better feedback from the pumpkin cheesecake recipe. I will admit, the texture and crust were delicious. Will definitely make the chocolate crust again, will use the same sugar/cream cheese/egg porportions, but will change the kahlua/espresso/sour cream part.

Lucky you... You've discovered one of my "secret" recipes. I've been making this recipe since 1992 (the May 1992 issue is a keeper!!) and people literally beg me to bring it to parties. One New Year's Eve people were standing around it eating it with their fingers!! I have one tip.... Double the recipe for the crust The original is too thin. This recipe should be kept as one of your "secrets" too. ....

This recipe is excellent! Warning: It is extremely time consuming but well worth the effort. The layered look of coffee & chocolate, the sour cream, the chocolate drizzled on top will have everyone oohing and awing and it only gets better when they taste it! It is also expensive (I had to go out and buy instant coffee, quality chocolate, sour cream, chocolate cookies etc. The result is an elegant, professional looking masterpiece. That even a non-cheescake lover devoured! I will save this one for that extra special occasion!

Scrumptious and rich. I found that Baileys Irish Cream works well in place of the Kahlua, and that General Foods powdered International coffee (I used French Vanilla) woks well in place of the espresso powder. The coffee flavor still comes through. Enjoy!

This cheesecake will win you praise and accolades at every turn! I personally don't eat cheesecake, but made it for a friend's wedding rehearsal dinner and people practically knocked me over at the wedding to say how good it was. I also made it for a party and people couldn't get over how gorgeous it looks and how delicious it tastes. Too bad I don't like coffee or cheesecake! hee heee

Thank you for publishing this recipe! It is the absolute best of all my cheesecake recipes. I should note it is time-consuming to prepare, but the results are well worth the effort. I have never had a better cheesecake, either commercial, or homemade. Outstanding!

I made this for a potluck dinner and everyone raved about it! My only problem was removing the cake from the bottom of the springform pan. It broke, but I was able to cover up the problem by using chocolate ganache (thanks for the suggestion, Jennifer!) If any others have had this problem with this or any other cheesecake, I'd appreciate knowing what you did about it.

I have made this recipe over and over and is always a success! This is my favorite cheesecake recipe. I use Godiva Liquor instead of the coffee liquor and its wonderful. This is full of cafeine, so beware if you are a decaf drinker. Enjoy!

This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made. I didn't have a coffee liqueur available and instead used a chocolate liqueur I found in the house (Mozart) -- everyone raved about it! I'll be saving this recipe for special occasions though -- as it's a bit too rich for weekends.

Excellent! And I agree with another reviewer that the even the crust is especially good! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake. This is the first one that I'm definitely going to make over and over.

This cheesecake was devine. I would definetly make it many more times. The only thing I didn't like was how the sour cream topping looked after it was baked the 10 minutes. It was brownish and unattractive. I made chocolate ganache and spread it over the top after the cake cooled slightly and let it drizzle down the sides. Much better. This is a must try recipe.

Peggy S. from Kingston,PA This was the most delicious cheesecake I ever made! I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream and had excellent results. Also used decaf instant coffee to make it suitable for evening. It goes way beyond 4 forks! I just made this a second time with the full fat cream cheese and again it was a show stopper! The very best creamy cheesecake ever!

I made this cheesecake last Christmas and it was the best dessert ever. Everyone loved it! I've had numerous requests to make it again this year and plan to do so. It's heavenly.

Very easy and delicious. I get rave reviews from guests everytime...even the first time, when I forgot to read the directions closely, and poured the second layer on top of the first before it had baked at all...it was just as delicious, though not as beautiful as it could have been. The crust recipe is, in itself, a keeper. I've used it with other cheesecakes. Finally, not being a chocoholic, I used a little less chocolate, which seemed to satisfy me AND my chocoholic guests.

Unbelieveably good....I always make twice the amount of crust, it seems more appropriate for the hefty filling. This will easily feed 12-15 people as a small sliver is more than enough!! I'm known for this cheesecake so I don't give out the recipe.

I have also been making this cheesecake for years. It is absolutely amazing! Save it for special occasions though because it is expensive to make and takes awhile! I have had good luck using light cream cheese and sour cream. It still tastes wonderful!

I have made this recipe many, many times, and it never fails to impress. This cheesecake is the absolute best coffee-flavored cheesecake recipe I've had (and I've made lots of them). A word of warning, though....don't plan to go to sleep immediately after consuming it!
