Everyone loved this recipe but, the one I served was quite different from the recipe. I made the recipe ahead of time and couldn't get it out of the pan! I simply made the recipe according to the traditional recipe on the bag substituting 1/2 the water with wine and adding the Pom molasses and basil at the end. Did not think the cilantro and mint were worth the bother.

Be careful not to do what I did. In the reducing stage, it boiled too high and made a candy with a burnt edge to it. I was going to toss it but I pushed through and added the cranberries anyway, which took care of the stickiness. Good and tart--but with a burnt aftertaste (which is why I'm not rating it).Just wanted to pass along the warning. Also, wouldn't this be interesting with white cranberries and white wine? If I can find some white cranberries somewhere, I'll give it a go and let you all know. Maybe a dash of white balsamic instead of molasses? Could be good on a turkey sandwich with a bit of gorgonzola or brie?

Very good sauce! A close runner-up to the dried cherry cranberry sauce of BA from years ago. I could not find the molasses, but I did a quick internet search and found a recipe...for the 1/2c: use 2c POM juice, 1 1/2t sugar, and 3/4t lemon juice...on med or med/low reduce around 70-75 minutes until THICK...you have to go past the syrup stage to get molasses, but be careful towards the end esp to not burn it (and your pot)...i made this a few days ahead and stored covered in frig...its easy.

This cranberry sauce is AMAZING! I wish I could give it 5 forks! It really balanced out the flavors of my Thanksgiving feast. I thought the pomegranate molasses was an essential component. I used a pomegranate "paste" I found at Whole Foods. It seemed thicker than the molasses. On it's own it has a deep, rich, complex flavor that greatly contributed to the sauce as a whole. Along with the cilantro, and especially the mint, it just knocked my socks off.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving table - a 'keeper' as labeled by my daughter, Kerry. A deep and unique flavor that really compliments the turkey. Fabulous!

This was excellent! We were lucky to find the pomegranate molasses at Whole Foods. Total agreement with others that the mint and cilantro makes this recipe. A nice change from the lovable orange and cranberry mix.

I found this recipe too late to get the pomegranite molasses. I substituted a homemade pomegranite simple syrup, and that worked well. The flavor combination of the cilantro and mint was absolutely delightful! A definite repeat.

I couldn't find pomegranate molasses, so I used regular molasses and threw in the seeds from half a pomegranate and simmered for 5 more minutes - it was excellent!

This was a nice variation on traditional cranberry sauce. Our pomegranate molasses wasn't bitter-- maybe it depends on the brand. I followed the suggestion elsewhere in the magazine to add a pinch of salt.

Made this per recipe, and it turned out great. The cilantro & mint compliment it very nice. I used the pomegranate molasses, which is quite bitter not sweet. Personally, I wouldn't even use it if you don't already have it.
