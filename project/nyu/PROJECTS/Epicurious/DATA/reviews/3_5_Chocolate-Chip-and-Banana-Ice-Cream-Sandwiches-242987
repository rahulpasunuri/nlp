My family said this was the best dessert I've ever made--which is saying a lot. I give it 3 forks cuz it is tricky to make. I used a Betty Crocker Chocolate Chip Cookie bag mix for the cookies. I used plain vanilla ice cream bc it's much cheaper and I didn't want people to suffer from banana overload. I also did not scrape the edges of the sandwiches after they froze for an hour. I wanted to minimize digging around in my freezer and creating more mess with melting icecream, chocolate drippings, and toffee bits falling off. DO NOT use the oil in the melted chocolate--so not necessary. The sandwiches looked beautiful, but there is a lot of prep time and you have to move quickly to minimize melting and dripping with the ice cream and the chocolate sauce.

I made this over the weekend, but did not follow the recipe completely. First off, NO BANANAS PLEASE! I ended up using the Toll House Ultimates as they are premeasured and delicious, then Breyer's French Vanilla Ice cream. I also dunked 3/4 of the cookie in the chocolate dip and still had plenty left over if I wanted to do a second batch. These flew out of my freezer like crazy they were sooo delicious!

This was OK - nothing special. I won't be wasting my time on making this again.

Sorry i didn't see the other "reviews" before I posted. I doubt the cook from NE will revisit this recipe; too bad. I read the recipe in the magazine and did purchase the dough in the tube just in case I got unexpected company and could whip this out in no time, instead of spending time baking and cleaning my mess. Glad I did. Also learned a lesson about forks, if something looks intreresting read the reviews in case (as it was here) no one before me had actually tried making it!

I didn't have any bananas and no ripe ones at the store, but I found a Banana's foster ice cream by Perry's and this combo is to die for. It had the toffee in the ice cream so I omiited that part, but if I used straight banana ice cream I would use the toffee bits as it added great flavor. Very Rich

Cookie dough from tubes? How can they even consider that a recipe? This is a special trip to the store to purchase an overpriced product.

I have not made this particular recipe, but you can omit the oil when you melt the chocolate. I have done this countless times with ice cream sandwiches, and it has worked great (and saves a few calories/fat).

i havent tried this yet, but by the looks of it you should add peanutbutter at the same time as you add the icecream. or maybe even use peanutbutter cookies instead of chocolatechip?
