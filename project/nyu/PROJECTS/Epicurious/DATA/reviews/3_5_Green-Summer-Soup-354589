How fresh and wonderful! This is the taste of summer. I also added olive oil, salt and pepper. And I doubled the mint.

I made this for the first time tonight: it was ok. Basically what you'd expect out of blended peas with some spices. I did add EVOO and extra salt and pepper. I was looking for a chilled easy soup to make on an unusually hot night in San Francisco (this rarely happens!) so I found the perfect recipe for that. But all in all, it's just ok. It's blended peas. With a fresh herb (I used the mint as suggested). I didn't cook it and I have lots left for tomorrow. Maybe the flavors will blend together better. Curious: what's with the direction to eat it out of a bowl? I get the sense this is a "side bar" recipe written by a non-cook for novelty.

Excellent, simple recipe! I did add a bit of evoo as well as salt & pepper to taste, and mixed the slighted frozen peas with other ingredients in my blender. Thanks for a keeper!

the main reason I am reviewing is for the fact that this looks like a nice recipie and also to add, What the heck Westchester?! could you possibly portray yourself in a more selfish and rude way? I think not!

Thanks for nothing, Westchester. If you can't review the dish in question, zip it.

Really, really good. I loved how easy it was, and it came out amazing. Very fresh and summery. :-) I added fresh basil instead of mint, and it was still very good.

I wasn't as impressed with this as the other reviewers. The flavor was really pleasant but it was way too thin in consistency. My suggestion would be to start with one cup of broth and add more more mint and little salt and pepper.

This recipe is phenomenal- refreshing and soul quenching... I used basil instead of mint from the garden- and "just-thawed" frozen peas. I didn't cook the soup at all, just blended it, sprinled with extra- virgin olive oil, sprinkled with Kosher Salt and freshly ground black pepper. Perfect for spring and summer- light, satiating- and keeps the integrity of each of the ingredients.
