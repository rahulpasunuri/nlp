really enjoyed this recipe just the way it is... didn't even have much time to marinate it the night we made it and it was still delicious

Best halibut I've ever had. I used bone-in steaks. You can cut the sauce in half and still have plenty left over. Served with roasted aspargus and grilled corn, with the individual molten chocolate cakes for dessert. Scrumptious and very easy!

Delicious. I used 1 inch thick halibut fillets, rather than steaks, and it still turned out very well. The fennel tsatsiki really made the dish. We were basically eating it with a spoon out of the bowl, even the next day. The guests were very pleased, and at least one made the dish for another group of friends.

Made marinade only - it was easy and delicious. Shared the recipe widely. I usually use a little less oil than recipes call for and that worked just fine.

I, too, only did the marinade and not the sauce. This was my first time cooking halibut and I thought it was outstanding. The fennel seeds went slightly nutty after toasting and just complemented the fish so well. It was super easy and quick, and I will definitely make again!

I only prepared the marinade and not the sauce. We really liked Halibut this way so I'll be sure to repeat this effortless, tasty recipe. I served it with organic stir-fried Russian red kale, buttered brown rice w/ turmeric & a chiffonade of Thai basil, and a very pleasant Vigonier.

I replaced celery seeds for the fennel seeds (don't really care for fennel). The flavour and texture was gorgeous, the tzatziki sauce complimented the dish. Oh yeah, will make this again.

This was very nice. The fennel was a delicious addition to the fish. I served it with the tsatsiki; some people liked it plain and some liked the sauce.

My husband caught a 138 pound halibut, and I was looking for recipes. I've made this one several times, and it's my favorite. I'd suggest 5 minutes max for the marinade. Another good sauce is cucumber, or chilpolte ranch.

Made this last night for me and my husband. I'm glad I tried it before making it for guests. I also made the fennel tsatsiki. The fresh fennel is overpowering and I am a fan of fennel. I realize now that I probably prefer my fennel cooked. Will not make this receipe again.

Made this last week whilst on holiday. Couldn't get halibut at the local grocery so used grouper instead. Wonderful and SO easy! Will definitely make it again.

Very light and tasty, allowing the taste of the halibut to predominate.

I thought the fennel overpowered the whole dish. Not impressed.

I've made this a couple times and we LOVE it each time - it's hard to not like Halibut, but the fennel in this dish certainly enhances and compliments the flavor of this wonderful fish! Cannot find tsatsiki however!

The marinade enhanced the flavor of the halibut without overpowering it. The fish was moist and delicious and I will definitely make it again -- soon. I allowed the halibut to marinate for approximately 30 minute which seemed to be the right amount of time.

This is the best grilled halibut recipe I have tried. The fennel marinade adds just the right flavor without overpowering the fish. Try it with the fennel tsatsiki.

I've been a halibut lover for years, and this recipe is a winner! I prefer filets rather than steaks. I've made this several times, and ithas never failed me. The flavors are quite subtle and delicate but are enough to bring out the flavor of the halibut. Don't overcook.

Not one of our favorites. But quick and easy. A decent everyday recipe.

Living in Homer, Alaska, the "Halibut Capital of the World", I'm always looking for new ways to prepare this versitile fish. I marinated the fillets, with skin attached on one side, for about 1 hour. I put them directly on a hot grill, skin down. The marinate gave the fish just enough flavor without overwhelming it. I will prepare this recipe for company next time.

We bought one large halibut fillet and cooked it in a tinfoil boat on 400 for about 20-25 minutes instead. Very moist and flakey. This is a really easy recipe to prepare and it'll knock your socks off how scrumptious the marinade makes the fish!

Very easy, inexpensive, quick and tasty. A definite keeper.

Who in the right mind grills a dlicate white fish like halibut?!

The best halibut recipe I know. I love it with the sauce, but it really is flavourful and moist enough that you don't need it.

The marinade was quick and flavorful. I liked it that the flavors did not mask the great flavor of halibut. I also skipped the tsatsiki, and didn't miss a thing.

I made this with fillets instead of steaks and it was great. I also skipped the tsatsiki. This marinade is easy and wonderful. Definitely do not substitute fine grain salt for the coarse.

Incredibly flavorful and moist. But don't marinate the fish longer than about 1/2 hour -- the lemon juice will start to "cook" the fish and will make the final result dry and chewy. Great recipe -- and wonderful with the fennel tsatsiki.

I made this without the sauce, and it was PHENOMENOL! An easy, flavorful recipe...

This may be the best grilled halibut recipe that I've made. The combination of fennel and garlic gives the halibut an extraordinary flavor.

Made this without the sauce, marinading for almost an hour. Marinade has nice flavor, but next time I would marinate it longer...don't see why the recipe says not to exceed an hour.

This was delicious without the sauce. The blend of flavors complements rather than dominates the fish.
