They came out excellent, but I cheated a bit. I used 2 tbsp less butter, substituted some Ralston wheat cereal for some of the oats, added 3 tbsp of amaretto, and 1/2 cups of sliced almonds, and used 3/4 tsp of salt.

My family love this variation on cc cookies. I add chopped candied ginger and pecans for additional flavor. Quick and easy.

Correction to below substitutions: I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter not the 1 stick I previously mentioned.

I wanted to make a more nutritious version of this recipe. Instead of two sticks of butter, I beat in 3/4 cup ground flaxseed to only one stick of softened butter, one cup of firmly packed brown sugar plus the two eggs. I also substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white flour. Lastly, I cut the oatmeal to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. While the dough seemed a bit dry, the cookies came out fluffy and very flavorful and a lot less greasy. They were crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy inside. I also used the convection feature of the oven so I wouldn't have to turn them. My family loved them...a keeper!

These were too salty for my taste. I thought the amount (1 t) was too much, and I should have reduced it.

If you're looking for a real oat-y oatmeal cookie, this isn't it, but they're still super good. I didn't have enough cherry or chips but the proportions were fine. I think I had like 3/4c each. I also threw in handful of walnut pieces, nice addition, and used wheat flour, which made no difference. Cooked at 7 minutes a side seemed like the max, a second longer and they would have been too dark. I just used Pam on the sheets because I ran out of parchment and I only have one silicon sheet. Worked fine. Next time I don't think I'll chop up all the oats.

I made a number of changes to this recipe, and the cookies turned out very well. I cut down on the white sugar by half. I substituted chopped walnuts for dried tart cherries; and I added 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon, ground cloves, and freshly-ground nutmeg. Could have gone up to 1/2 tsp on the cinnamon. Will try that next time. Delish.

The best cookie recipe I've tried in a long while, especially good if you use high quality chocolate chips.

Wow, I'm really surprised by all the great reviews. I'm an accomplished cook and a more than proficient baker, and while I didn't have a problem with spreading and the resulting cookies had a pleasant taste, they were hard, leaden things, possibly suitable for dunking in coffee but not a candidate for guests. I may try again using my stand mixer instead of a food processor.

I thought these were wonderful! I made them a few days before I needed them and froze them. Not sure if this helped witht the spreading but they were nice bite sized cookies with great flavor. Made a nice quantity too. Great recipe!

This was a pretty easy recipe with a good result. I cut the butter by about a quarter and they did not spread. I substituted dried cranberries which gave the recipe more of a fall feel. The cookies needed a mere 8 minutes in my convection oven.

Wow! These are wonderful - everyone loved them and were SO surprised by the punch the cherries gave them. I did cut some of the bigger cherries but not all. I will be THE BEST GRANDMA EVER.

Excellent oatmeal cookie recipe, except I firmly believe oatmeal cookies need spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) otherwise they are glorified chocolate chip cookies. I did use other reviewer's advice and reduced the butter by 2T. Cookies were perfectly OK, and spread nicely. More would have made them greasy. I used white whole wheat flour and couldn't tell the difference. I also used dried cranberries (I was out of cherries) and it was just as delish. I'm now making a second batch as the family mowed through the first batch in just a couple of days.

I was so surprised to see the negative comments about this recipe. These cookies are a brilliant combination of flavors and texture. I have made this this recipe twice without making any changes to the ingredients. However, I did not use the food processor except to coarsely chop the oats. I used my stand mixer to to cream the butter and sugar, beat in the eggs and then mix in the dry ingredients. I used a well-rounded one- tablespoon cookie scoop and baked them on non-stick cookie sheets rather than parchment. They were golden brown and perfectly baked in 14 to 15 minutes and spread only moderately, maintaining a nice shape. I know it is a conflict for many cooks who try to create balance due to health concerns, but I don't make desserts on a regular basis and when I do, I want to go "all the way!" This recipe will go into my permanent file for guilty pleasures.

I have no idea why this recipe calls for 2 sticks of butter: I used 1.5 and the cookies baked up perfectly without spreading all over the place. I will increase the amount of cherries next time,as the flavor was not quite as intense as I would like. The saltiness is terrific. The flavor is very, very good.

I loved the flavors and thought the recipe was so easy. As other reviewers say, the stated cooking time in the recipe is WAY too long. The cookies turned out perfect when they spent 5 min on top rack and 4 min on bottom rack. They were a little overdone when it was reversed (5 min on bottom, then 4 on top) but, not ruined. The oatmeal cookie base is wonderful and a much simplier way to make vs. processing the oats first. Loved the texture and saltiness.

Delicious cookies! Adjusted some things based on the reviews for a cookie texture that was more to my personal taste. Cut dried cherries in half, cut butter down by 2 tablespoons, refrigerated dough for just about 30 minutes, used a small scooper to make balls, cooked a total of 9-10 minutes, and left plenty of space in between cookies. Looked and tasted wonderful!

I love these cookies! Definitely be careful about burning the bottom. Parchment paper works well to avoid that. You might try subtracting a tablespoon of butter or two so the cookies aren't quite so greasy and melty when put in the over. Also, it could stand more cherries, because they definitely make this cookie unique!

The flavours in this are brilliant and everyone at work loved them. After reading the other reviews, i thought it would be good to put the dough in the refrigerator for about an hour and then form into balls and bake. As a result, they did not collapse as much as others described. I used a couple of bars of organic chocolate- milk and a 70%, that i cut into small chunks. I might add a little more flour next time, as i prefer that style of cookie.

These cookies were super yummy. I love how the processor smooths out the oatmeal and gives a great consistency. The only change would be to reduce the cooking time to 10 mins total (5 mins on each level). I overcooked the first set, but they were still great!

The cookies didn't spread enough and burned on a silicone mat and turned out perfectly fine on parchment. The baking time is too long by at least 2-3 minutes. I don't care for both chocolate chips and oatmeal in a cookie (which I just learned), but if you like that combination, you should like these.

This cookie is one of my all-time favorites. I pair it with a powdered sugar/kirsch drizzle... If you don't have dried tart cherries on hand, you can also use dried cranberries.

My rating: Unsatisfactory. The dough melted into a flat mass on the cookie sheet. It was a disaster, a waste of good ingredients.I have never had a cookie recipe fail like this one. Don't bother. Is there a typo somewhere?
