I made the chicken and vegetables - I did not use prunes or make the sauce. I thought this was a very easy and delicious way to cook chicken breasts with the bone in. I will cook chicken this way often!

As an occasional cook, I found it easy to make. Had to subsitute dried cherries for the prunes, and a rather sweet white wine rather than dry. Still, an eye-appealing tasty dish. Mine could have used a bit more salt. Accompanied steamed broccoli with lemon-butter sauce, The lemon-lemon combination was quite ok.

Great quick weekday meal; couscous is a nice accompaniment. I would recommend going a little light on the lemon at least the first time you make it - a little went a long way for me.

This dish is very flavorful, and very pleasing to the eye. We didn't find the lemon overwhelming at all. I added cut up parsnips to the pan. I used 1 cup of broth, and 2 tsp of flour, so we had extra gravy. A keeper!

A delicious meal in one pan. Use a good quality chicken.

The lemon overpowered everything else. I wouldn't make it again.

Very good. This is a great weekday winter dish. Next time I might add/substitue other vegetables like parsnips, potatoes, etc.

This recipe was easy to make but a bit bland. It is a good recipe for a family dinner.

Delicious! I used deboned chicken breasts - no skin - and the recipe turned out well. Very easy to make.
