My only reason to consider making this again is ease, healthfulness, and handy ingredients. Otherwise, I would only use it as a base that needs a lot of help - more curry, other spices, etc. We added some red pepper dip (Ajar), which did help.

My dinner guests loved the soup. I froze it, partially thawed it and put it into a blender to serve "smoothie" style.
