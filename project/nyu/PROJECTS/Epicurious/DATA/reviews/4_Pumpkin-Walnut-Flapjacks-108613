I made these pancakes for breakfast this weekend and was not disappointed. I followed many suggestions of the other reviews (substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour and used regular white flour; reduced sugar and used less butter). The flavor was great but next time I will double the spice. I also added finely chopped walnuts to the batter. My husband loved these and we will make these when our kids come home from college for the holidays. This recipe will become part of our family favorites

These are absolutely delicious! I'm not a huge nut fan so I just left those out. My only complaint, which really isn't a huge deal at all, is how un-workable these are. They are seriously messy, I wound up making more pancake batter omelettes than actual pancakes. I don't know if anyone else had that problem but I have only had this issue with this recipe and not any others. Don't really know why that was. Still, it wasn't a huge issue. It made for some laughs with the family. Fantastic flavour, though. Will be making these again.

I found these to be delicious when following the recipe exactly. I also changed the recipe to exchange the cake flour for whole wheat flour and the sugar for brown sugar. They were still delicious, and you couldn't even taste the whole wheat flour because of the pumpkin flavor. Healthy and yummy!

These were probable the most difficult pancakes I have ever made but 100% worth it. All 4 people loved them.

I loved this recipe. Based on other reviews, I halved the sugar and followed the spice amounts posted on 11/19/08 from the cook in Michigan. I always use syrup so reducing the sugar was a no brainer; the syrup adds enough sweetness. I also added the walnuts right to the batter as I didn't feel like fooling with them later. This was a perfect fall breakfast and one I will make again.

These were pretty good, but a fair amount of work (and 3 different mixing bowls). I followed the advice and put in only 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 the butter. The pancakes were indeed light and fluffy, but were a little bland for me -- I think I will add more pumpkin pie spice next time. I also added the walnuts to the batter instead of sprinkling on top.

This was a surpisingly good pancake recipe. Pumpkin pancakes can often be heavy and dense. These are airy an delicous. We would definately try these again. If you like pumpkin recipes try the Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Carmel Sauce on this site. It has some of the higheset review rates I have seen.

This is one of my favorite recipes from Epicurious. My five-year-old son begs to help me make "those yummy pumpkin pancakes." I have made them with regular milk and all purpose flour (ran out of cake flour) and they are still amazing. Light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. We love these with sliced bananas and toasted pecans.

These are amazing! They seem to melt in your mouth. I've made them with regular milk since we didn't have any buttermilk. I also used less sugar and butter and they are still awesome.

Superb! These were outstanding pancakes! A perfect recipe! (I made no substitutions nor omitted anything).

The best pancake recipe I've ever tried! I halved the sugar and butter amounts as others have suggested. These are moist yet fluffy and so delicious! My family has pancakes almost every Saturday and this recipe tops all others. We love them and will definitely have them again.

These were very good. I liked the flavors of pumpkin and maple together. I was looking for ways to use pumpkin. I used half the sugar and left out the butter as suggested by other cooks. If you use maple syrup you get enough sugar anyway. My husband liked them too. I halved the recipe and still had some left over to freeze. I will make these again.

Wow! These are spectacular! I followed the advice of other reviewers and omitted the butter and halfed the sugar. Also, we are trying to cut down on dairy so I used almond milk instead of the buttermilk. Made my own pumpkin pie spice, too. Will be making these over the holidays for sure!

DeLLICCious! Perfectly fluffy, moist (more so than normal) and almost custardy interior. They raise very high and survive freezing beautifully. The recipe was quick to put together and is even entirely manageable completely by hand. HOWEVER, be SURE to replace the amount of pumpkin pie spice with 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp. ground ginger, 3/8 tsp. ground cloves, and 1/4-1/2 t. freshly grated nutmeg. I found this ratio and amount to be practically perfect. Enjoy!

Wonderful flavor!!! I'm always looking for something different to do with pancakes - We liked it with or without the nuts!

Very tasty. I did not have pumpkin pie spice so I used apple pie spice. Still great!!!

I'd been looking for a good pumpkin pancake recipe for ages, and when I saw this one I decided I had to try it. I followed reviewer suggestions and put less sugar, used milk instead of buttermilk coz that's all I had, and omitted the butter as so many said it wasn't needed. I also sprinkled walnuts onto the pancakes while cooking so that they'd be inside the pancake instead of on top - i just sprinkled a few on top to look pretty. My bf is not a pancake fan, and was disappointed when I reminded him I was making these for breakfast on Sunday - but after he tried a bite, he wolfed them down! What's more, the following weekend, when I asked him what he wanted for breakfast, my bf shocked me by asking if I could make the pumpkin pancakes again! This recipe is definitely a keeper, and will be making these again.

Great! Thumbs up all around. Suggestion: a nonstick pan without butter will create a much more attractive finish, the browned butter ruins the overall color.

Truly supreme flapjack. I was surprised they were so delicious as I don't care for pumpkin cakes or muffins. Make these and enjoy the feast.

I found this recipe about a year ago. I made it for an open house we had. Everyone went crazy over them. I also take my griddle and the batter to work when I have goody day. Everyone loves them.

This was awesome! I followed the suggestions of others and lightened it by using whole grain flour, splenda, 1/2 the butter, skim milk...and it was still fabulous! I did add extra pumpkin spice! Everyone is asking for them for Christmas morning!

Ever since I found this recipe, which was before Thanksgiving, I have made them EVERY weekend, plus I double the recipe so we can reheat them during the week. I use whole wheat flour instead of cake flour, extra virgin coconut oil instead of butter, and cut the sugar in half. They are excellent!

flapjacks were light and delicious. I made them for a Thanksgiving brunch and they were a huge hit.

Excellent! Made this for a brunch, and they were a big hit. Light, very moist, described by friends as "pumpkin pie in a pancake!" Two changes: it certainly doesn't need so much butter--tastes plenty rich with just a tablespoon. Also, I halved the sugar. The pumpkin is naturally sweet, and once you add syrup, 1/4c of sugar is way too much.

These are "OH MY GOD DELICIOUS" ... best pancakes I ever had. I didn't have buttermilk and used regular milk instead and they were YUM! I followed recipe exactly other than the milk. Will toast walnuts next time just because I think all nuts taste richer toasted. Must make these again ... they are the absolute best, definitely worth the work. I'm going to print the recipe, package it up with the ingredients, and give them out as gifts to folks for Thanksgiving breakfast! They are 'share the joy' yummylicious.

Awesome!!! We've made these numerous times...one of our favorite.

I used whole wheat flour and splenda to make these and topped with cranberries, bananas, and pecans. Also used half the amount of butter as suggested. They were good but could have used more pumpkin and spices using this flour. Next time I will add some syrup to the batter. Definitely recommend the recipe.

I had wonderful pumpkin pancakes in a restaurant once and wanted to recreate them at home. These pancakes surpassed my expectations. As everyone else said, light and fluffy... pumpkin, but not too pumpkin. I too left out the butter. Excellent and just as easy as out of a box.

Everyone comments on how light and airy these are. I guess so. They are a mass of leavening. Baking powder, baking soda AND beaten egg whites. So then you use cake flour which leads to a lighter product, too. I'm with the guy who thought that they have too much sugar and I find the vanilla flavor cloying but to each his own. My children liked them and my students loved them. Next time, with all of this leavening power, I'm going with whole wheat flour. Then I'm replacing the sugar and vanilla with two tablespoons of maple syrup in the batter. I'll report back.

Wow! Great recipe! The pumpkin isn't overwhelming..it's just right. I will try them next time without the butter as the other cook suggested. And I will pass this recipe on to friends and family.

Fabulous! I'm not a huge pumpkin fan, but these sounded so right for Thanksgiving morning, and everyone (including me) loved them! These are the most fluffy, moist pancakes. We reheated a couple of them the next day, and they still tasted great--not too pumpkin tasting, but definitely very holiday tasting. Yum!

A positive fluke! I made this recipe with great expectations, following carefully the recipe, while at the same time adding a flourish of spice and a great heaping handful of walnuts (perhaps too much at the end of the batch!). At the end I had very very fluffy, extremely light and delicious pancakes! Then, making them again with my sister, I noticed I had completely forgotten the butter the first time I made them! We made them again, still without the butter and they didn't turn out as good. Why? YOU MUST BEAT THE EGG WHITES as directed!! Otherwise they're flat and too dense and don't cook well (Bleh!). I recommend making them without the butter, and with only a small handful of walnuts tossed in the batter. Believe me, you won't notice the absence of butter! They will be light and fluffy and you won't feel as guilty when eating them.

I enjoyed these very much, They were light, fluffy and flavorful. However, my husband did not like them and said that pumpkin in pancakes was not a good combination. So, keep in mind that less adventuresome eater may not appreciate the unique flavor.

I absolutely love these flapjacks! My husband raved about them all week. I did all the prep the night before and they were a breeze to prepare the next morning. I don't care for walnuts so I used pecans instead. Drizzled with warm pure maple syrup they are wonderful!

These are excellent! I have tried many pumpkin pancake recipes and this is by far the best. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the cake flour (because I don't like cakes that are too light and airy) and I omitted the walnuts. I served these with cranberry syrup and they were incredible. My kids loved them too.

My wife and I love these.. we leave out the nuts though... Light, fluffy and very tasty.... We have made them several times and have tried leaving out the sugar and use half of the butter and they didn't lose their taste.. but are a bit healthier. Also great as a dessert topped with some carmelized apples and/or ice cream!!!

These pancakes are so light and fluffy. The spice is just right. I served them with toasted pecans rather than the walnuts and also topped them with sliced bananas. A wonderful autumn breakfast!
