This recipe was very simple and easy to do for a nice summer dish. We added cracked pepper, and it was great. We happen to have too much arugula and fava beans in the garden at the moment, so the recipe was perfect! We used the pecorino cheese. I bought both, and thought that this would go better once I tried them.

Really good! The more cheese the better, in my opinion.

Delicious! Blanching fava beans for a 3-5 minutes makes it easy to take them out of the pods. If the pod isn't soft after blanching, toss the bean... it's no good. I added a bit of raw garlic and toasted pepitas and used a different hard italian cheese called piave stravecchio (it was just a shot in the dark when shopping at Whole Foods). Simple, healthy and absolutely delicious!!!

So to utilize all the CSA goods this seemed like perfect fit - Maybe I'm a bit dim but really went with all those who thought this was as a whole so much more than the parts. Really weak even with fab Parmesan. And to beat the dead horse I needed a way bigger bang for my buck for the fava work.

I agree, so simple and beautifully balanced. Though the fava beans were a pain ;o) May try edamame next time.

It might seem like there's nothing to this recipe. But, simple ingredients and preparation means you need to pay attention to the individual parts to make the dish sing as a whole. I used fresh fava beans, a fruity olive oil, and grada padano parmesan. The sweet and nutty fava bean, the bitter arugula, crisp asparagus, the sweet balsamic vinegar, and salty shaved cheese made a it a perfectly balanced salad.

Excellent, got rave reviews from everyone at my dinner party. I was surprised at how good it was given the simplicity of the dressing. I made it with pecorino, that added a lot of flavor and complimented the arugula. Went very well with rack of lamb. I have to say, the fava beans are a major pain-- I actually ended up with only about a fourth of the amount of fava beans called for and it was still delicious, so I'm not sure how important they are. I may try it again with edamames.

Lived on this salad last spring. Made it again this one now that fresh fava beans are in the Farmer's Market. This is the BEST spring salad!

So so good. Shaving the pecorino with a peeler worked great. Also, funny story: I couldn't find arugula in the market so I guessed at a substitute and bought rocket, which I learned later is another name for . . . arugula.

Easy and terrific, refreshing like spring. Only surprise was shelling fava beans twice, once out of the pod and then again after blanching to take off the skins.

A taste of spring on the plate. Yes, it's trouble dealing with the fava beans, and slicing the asparagus so finely. But, the reward of the final product makes it all worthwhile. Aged balsamic and pecorino add a special touch.

This is an absurdly good salad. We grow our own asparagus, so it's ten minutes from garden to table. It's so fresh and sweet, I don't have to blanch the asparagus tips. It's an incredible combination of some of my favorite foods. Good ingredients are a must. For folks who think the favas are too much trouble, I suggest sitting down outside with a glass of wine and just getting into the Zen of it. (Do wine and Zen go together?) As with most things, the task is easier if it's shared.

The prep for the fava beans was way too much trouble. The final result was way too salty (should have tasted it first before adding). Maybe it will be better as leftovers added to pasta for lunch tomorrow.

Raw asparagus?? Blanched fava beans?? It sounded too bizarre, but I tried it anyway. Wonderful. Get the freshest asparagus possible. I managed to get some "just picked" asparagus, and thinly sliced the stalks. As others have noted, this makes an elegant presentation. Just scatter the beans and asparagus on a plate; top with arugula; and shave pecorino on top. Pass the pecorino at the table for those who want more. Nice, simple, the fava beans are a pain, but worth it. Nice, unusual salad.

Absolutely Delicious!! Very elegant looking. Pecorino is a must - accept no substitutes. I substituted mixed spring greens for arugula, with good results. Extra-virgin olive oil and aged balsamic worked well. Go easy with the salt/pepper....Let your guests add to taste.

What a fantastic salad! I used edamame instead of favas...it was easy and impressive!

I felt like a professional chef when I served this. WOW. Delicate, beautiful and yummy. Don't skimp on the Parmesan - it makes the whole thing. I roasted the asparagus tips instead of blanching them, 400° for 3 - 4 minutes. The fava beans take awhile to shell and peel so I like to talk on the phone it makes the whole thing go faster.

I came across this recipe while wondering what to do with fresh fava beans from the garden. I have made this dish six times since, both for family and for guests. Excellent, and easy to make. Have substituted mixed greens for the arugula, and fresh shaved parmesan for the cheese, both with success.

I don't have to even try this to know it excellant. I will make it tonight, easy and delightful flavors., I really like the pairing up soy beans with asparagus..Nice idea...If at all possible splurge and buy the very best Balsamic you can, it is the differnce between skim milk and triple cream, really. Two drops a portion will prove incredible, it goes a long wonderful way !!!

I served this last weeked for a back tie birthday dinnner party and received many compliments. I used shelled frozen edamame in lieu of fava. Simple, easy to prepare. Don't forget the salt and pepper and use high quality balsamic vinegar, becuase it makes the salad. As far as technique, I didn't bother with a vegetable peeler for the percorino, a small sharp knife works just as well.
