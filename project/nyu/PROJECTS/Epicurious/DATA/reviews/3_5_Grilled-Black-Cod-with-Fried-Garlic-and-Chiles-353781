This didn't go so well, but perhaps others can learn from my mistakes. As the others have mentioned, this fish falls apart easily. Where he says to lightly oil your fish basket, how about you oil the daylights out of it. Also, I'd recommend having the garlic oil ready when the fish comes off the grill, and have your guests ready to eat. It got cold and sort of unpleasant really quickly.

I've made this recipe several times and each time I love it! The fish is delicate so make sure you oil the grill before you put the fish down. Enjoy!

Good and easy. Be careful not to overcook garlic. I can also see why a fish basket would be helpful - the fish is a little delicate on the grill.
