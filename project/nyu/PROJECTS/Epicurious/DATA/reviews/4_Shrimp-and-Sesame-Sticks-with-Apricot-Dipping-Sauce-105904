One of my favorites and anyone who tastes them. My friends and family request them all the time especially for the holidays. One tip I would like to share, put the shrimp mixture into a pastry bag and pipe it onto the filo dough. Cuts the prep time tremendously.

I make these almost every Christmas season and am never disappointed. They are absolutely delicious and always a hit. In fact the December, 2001 Gourmet is one of the best issues ever. My copy is ragged and stained from so much use.

WOW, Great, are there more? That's what I am asked when I make them for a outing of any kind. My friends beg me to make them over and over again. I now make two batches at a time and freeze what I am not using and pull out what I need anytime. One of the best so far.

I normally do not review things, but this recipe has quickly become one of my favorites! The flavors accompany each other well, and I wouldn't change a thing about it!

One word: Fabulous!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, baked them the night before, refrigerated them and brought them back to room temperature before serving. The sauce is delicious, with just the right contrast of sweet and sour to counter the flavor of the shrimp filling. Phyllo can be tricky. Be sure to cover the top sheet with either plastic wrap or waxed paper to keep in the proper amount of moisture. And don't despair if the sheets tear slightly. They mend very easily and are very forgiving. Tears or imperfections don't show after they're baked. I wouldn't make any changes nor can I suggest anything to improve this recipe. They're fairly straightforward to make, taste great, and everyone loved them!

I made this with ground turkey breast because i was already serving several seafood appetizers. Using the turkey made this very easy to prepare and mold into a roll. I also made these a week ahead and froze them after rolling and cutting. I was worried the filling may not be cooked through in the time it took for the phyllo to get golden brown, but they cooked up beautifully.

I served these at a party last night and people raved about them. Personally, I found them good, but not great - a little fiddly but fairly straightforward. I used Sesame chili oil because that's all I had - otherwise I think they would have been little bland.

Great recipe that is a request from my family and friends for occasions from birthdays to holidays. To the cook who wondered if the shrimp should be raw or cooked...raw!

I had the caterer make these for the cocktail hour at my wedding reception and they were very popular. Easy to eat while mingling and a nice change from typical hors d'oeuvres. Good with a crisp white wine.

I made these again for a Christmas Eve party and they were gone soon after they came out of the oven. I do recommend a pastry bag or a large zip lock fashioned like a pastry bag (as I did). I cut a hole in the corner to allow about 1/2 inch diameter then squeezed the filling onto the phyllo. Be sure to fill close to the end of the pastry. It worked perfectly for me and they actually came out looking like the ones in the picture!

Made these for our annual Christmas party and they disappeared! Everyone loved them. I found it difficult to form the raw shrimp mixture into a 'rope', as it was messy to handle. So next time I will try and squeeze it out of a pastry bag. In any case, there will definately be a next time.

These are great finger food for a party. Pureeing the shrimp is a little bit gross, and my sticks did not look nearly as neat as the ones in the picture - the filling leaked out the sides. Still, they were a big hit and really yummy.

I'm wondering if most people are making this with raw shrimp or cooked? I feel a little silly for wondering, but the recipe doesn't specify and it seems easier to use cooked, but it might come out better with raw?

I have made this twice and both times I'd wished that I had made more. Everyone RAVED about them. Fairly easy to make beforehand and pop in the oven as another reviewer said, and the sauce can keep for several days. Mmmmmm.

A big hit at my holiday party. People were impressed, but these were fairly easy to make and could be made ahead and popped in the oven at the last minute. Using a pastry bag to pipe the shrimp mixture definitely a good idea. Also, I used my new kitchen shears to snip the logs into the individual rolls--much easier and cleaner than using a knife.

I've made this several times and everyone loves them! I like to cut the phyllo into manageable strips before rolling - it makes it easier.

The first to go! Friends love these. Not as easy and quick as I wished, but worth the effort.

These are a wonderful appetizer!! I have made these twice and everyone loves them. The second time I made them I wrapped them individually instead of a long log that I needed to cut and I brushed them with butter and then sprinkled the sesame seeds on top. Much better and crispier.

How did they get so many sesame seeds to stick for the picture - glue them on afterwards for the photo shoot? If you use up all of the shrimp filling on just eight rolls, you will have thicker rolls than the picture suggests - you can easily make ten rolls if you'd like and a pastry bag makes it go more quickly - the shrimp mixture is quite sticky. Use a silpat mat and it goes more smoothly.

These were the hit of my cocktail party and I'm looking for another occasion to make them again! I used my silpat mats to avoid sticking issues.

The shrimp sticks were suprisingly easy to prepare and very delicious. I found the sauce to be too sweet, I would probably make them with a different dipping sauce next time. I also found that the shrimp sticks stuck to the pan and were difficult to use, next time I would definatly use a silpat liner.

Fun to make. Had a bit of difficulty trying to chop shrimp in regular blender. The apricot sauce is a necessary compliment to the slightly pungent fishiness of the rolls. Perfect finger food.

Great Dish! I mixed & rolled and then froze. Didn't even need to be thawed before cooking. Excellent.

These were absolutely wonderful! I found that 3 tabls. of filling per stick was too little -- I used more like 1/2 cup. I served these at an hors d-oeuvres cocktail party with many other treats; these were a favorite, but best warm.

A very good recipe. Dipping sauce is a must (recipe can be halved and still be enough). Black sesame seeds add a nice contrast.

Once you get the hang of handling phyllo dough, this goes pretty fast! They were a major success at a recent party. DEFINITELY recommend using a pastry bag...delicious hot, but become medicore and limp as they cool.

This is a fabulous hors d'oeuvres. Love the idea of using a pastry bag as it can get pretty messy trying to form the narrow rope of shrimp paste. I made them for a pot luck and they flew off the plate. They were wonderful.

Excellent appetizer - just out of this world. Made over the weekend for a dinner party... I halfed the recipe and it was just perfect for four people. We really enjoyed the apricot dipping sauce - wonderful. Everything was just so delicious & so easy!!! Will be making this again & again - rave reviews from the guests !

Incredibly delicious! Has the right amount and combination of spices to make it to-die-for! Only change I'll make is to make use and extra sheet of phyllo dough. The dipping sauce is perfect with it too.

Terrific appetizer. Added a little more ginger and garlic. Next time I make I'll use a pastry bag with a large tip to make the shrimp ropes. It will save a lot of time and mess.

I made these for Christmas and New Year's and it was a big hit. I have frozen them for 2 weeks and then thawed & baked with no alteration in taste. I wrapped them airtight in wax paper and then sealed in a freezer plastic bag.

These are quite wonderful. The phyllo dough is much less intimidating to work with than I usually fear. I plan to make another batch and freeze them in anticipation of a champagne tasting party we are hosting

A big hit at my party this last weekend. I doubled the dipping recipe and was very glad that I did. Made sticks the night before and was unsure how I was suppose to "cover" them. Used waxed paper and a damp cloth and they turned out well. Very good! 3 1/2 forks!

It is an easy hors d'oeuvres to make. Working with phyllo dough may scare some people but it is quite easy and quick. I was wondering if anybody has freezed these uncooked and tried baking them?

Wow, I made these for New Year's Eve, along with several other appetizers, and they were the biggest hit! The flavor is fabulous and worth the hassle. Next time I'd follow a previous reviewer's suggestion and cut them smaller to make them bite-sized, but other than that, I wouldn't change ANYTHING in the shrimp sticks themselves. The dipping sauce, however, was too sweet for my taste. I added more lime juice and mustard and then it was really, really good.

Made this for Christmas eve, got such good response had to make them again next day for Christmas dinner (apps). Didn't have or couldnot find Apricot,so used Orange Marmalade which was great. Also try shrimp with cilantro (grilled app with sim. sauce rav reviews also if you like this.

These were a huge hit as the starter for a dinner party I had during the holidays. I made the rolls up the night before and then cut and seasoned them right before baking. The sauce was so easy, and ended up being used for several other items I served. They were delicious and well worth the hassle of working with the phylo dough!

Served this recently at a dinner party and it was wonderful. Great to prepare in advance and just stick in the oven when guests arrived. Froze extra before baking and they were wonderful a week later with leftover sauce. Impressive looking and tasting

Received great reviews from all who tried these at a recent party. I used cooked shrimp but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Had no trouble with mine sticking to the sheets and the cooking time was just right. Will make again and again!

These rolls were a big hit at our Christmas party. They are very professional in appearance and, if you're comfortable working with phyllo dough, very easy to prepare. We cut each roll into 6 pieces instead of 4 and each serving was still a very generous portion. We prepared the rolls in advance and then froze them. During the party we simply brushed them with the egg wash and extended the cooking time. We left out the sesame and salt topping, but the rolls and the dipping sauce were still delicious.

I made these ahead to bring to a party. Everyone loved them, although during the baking I panicked because they took much longer to cook and brown nicely (almost an extra 20 minutes). I also had a bit of a problem with them sticking to the baking sheet but during the second batch I generously buttered the baking sheet and it worked much better. Because I was in a rush, I served them with real plum sauce (made with real plums instead of pumpkin) which I had in the cupboard and which I had bought at a chinese grocery store. I found that while assembling them it was helpful to work on a tea towel so that they didn't move around too much. I served them with the chinese pot stickers also found on this site. An absolute hit!

These were a big hit! Everyone loved them with or without the dipping sauce. They're definitely best served warm. I did have trouble with them sticking to the baking sheets, but other than that they were a snap to make -- easier than I'd expected from reading the recipe.

A real crowd pleaser...from adults to children. The shrimp sticks were light and flavorful. The apricot sauce a must, it really completed the flavors. A keeper!!

Absolutely terrific. The combination asian spices with the sweet dipping sauce was a great combination. I made the individual rolls larger than the recipe called for so they had to cook for an additional 15 minutes.
