My husband and I found this dinner light and tasty. I found it easy to prepare and had most of the ingredients on hand.

Great weeknight dinner, so easy! I liked the addition of chili paste, it gave it a nice kick. I cut the tofu into four slices and drizzled with canola oil and some salt and pepper and baked it at 375 for 40 minutes instead of frying it (less mess and a lot less oil). We also had some mushrooms and green peppers on hand which were a nice addition. My husband and I were both big fan!

The subtle flavors of this dish are delicious. The mirin makes the recipe and perfectly complements the tofu.

This is an excellent starter recipe... I would add fresh cilantro at the end (just put on top as a garnish) and be sure to also add a table spoon of chinese chili paste (this give the recipe some zing).

to the person who found it disspointing.tofu by itself is bland and tasteless.But it absorbs any flavour you wish so I would suggestyou soak the tofu in a light marinade of your choice for a couple of hours before proceeding with the recipe.Maybe water, a bit of soya sauce, a dash of hot chinese chilli sauce,and grated onion and garlic which you boil to cook the last two ingredients.drain and then fry the cubes.hope you like this suggestion.

Just turned vegetarian and was looking for a good recipe. Major disapointment, this was pretty gross! Made this without the green onion. Tofu came out very bland, acidity of tomatoes and viniger was overpowering and much too sour. Will avoid this recipe at all costs.

The tomatoes in this dish are outstanding! Make sure to cook the tofu at the recommended degree. I didn't have mirin and used rice vinegar instead. Still fantastic and light - quite a treat!
