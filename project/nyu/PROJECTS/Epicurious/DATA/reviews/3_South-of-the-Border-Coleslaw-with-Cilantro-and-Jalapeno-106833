I didn't have (and don't like) bell pepper, so omitted it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Other than needing salt, we loved it, and it was delicious on grilled fish tacos. Super easy.

We made this for friends just this week and everyone loved it! It was fresh and lively, and turned out to be the perfect salad with the rotisserie chicken my husband made. I doubled the vegies and tripled the sauce. Since I didn't have enough cumin (oversite on my part) I used about half of what I should have. I also used whole cumin seed which I dry roasted for a few minutes in a fry pan on the stove top to bring out its flavor better. Initially, I was underwhelmed by the results, but after an hour or so in the frige, the slaw was very yummy indeed. My friends liked it so much they asked for the recipe.

Made this with pulled pork sandwiches. My family thought it was delicious, but we like jalapenos and cilantro. I also added 2 tablespoons cider vinegar which gave it some extra twang!

Omit the cumin!!, and add some sugar...IMO.

This was a waste of time to make. Very few of my dinner guests liked it and I ended up with so much leftover I had to throw it out. It lacked flavour and interest.

This is so delicious. I also love cilantro and prefer non-mayo coleslaw. I used a serrano pepper because it was what I had on hand and it worked beautifully. I liked the idea of adding corn, but I did not use mexican style. I sweetened the dressing with a bit of sugar. Honey would be good, too. This is a great change of pace from the Asian slaw that my family is addicted to.

First off I love cilantro and hate creamy coleslaws so this was right up my alley. But I did use Chili Pepper oil instead of olive oil and that might have helped other issues people had with flavor. It is a great fresh, light and summery side - the flavors worked really well together. i would almost double the dressing and definitely let it have at least 2 hours tossed in the fridge. I served it with a honey tequila lime chicken recipe!

This is an okay recipe (which is not bad) but it made us realize that we like creamy coleslaw.

Very strong flavor. if you don't like cilantro, don't make this.

This was very refreshing. Works well with many foods. Make sure you add some salt to the dish.

I like a little creaminess to my slaw, so I added a couple tbsps of low fat mayo. It added a great dimension to the slaw.

I had a variation of this last night. It was so refreshing, I had to find the recipie. The salad that I had included all of these ingredients, however there was 1 cup of canned mexican corn and 1 cup finely grated cheddar cheese. Very good!

Very good. Great with Mexican food.

I do understand a lot of the mixed reviews regarding this recipe. But it is simple in taste and prep, improves with time and makes a good side with Mexican and BBQd meats. I like it. It tastes clean and fresh compared to mayo based coleslaw.

It wasn't out of this world, but it was a nice light tangy accompaniment to Mexican fare. It is definitely better the next day, so if you can get it made the night before, it's worth it.

Served this to friends with chicken mole. It was a great change of pace from the ordinary salad I usually serve with Mexican food. It was also yummy two days later! But I think I will add more dressing next time.

This coleslaw wasn't a big hit in my house- there wasn't enough dressing to make it a real coleslaw and there was barely any heat to it. I won't be making this again.

This has become a staple salad in our house. A perfect compliment to any grilled meat and most Mexican dishes. I made it first to go with carne asada for 12 (doubled the recipe) and there were no leftovers. It makes a great fish taco topper if it marinates for a day or so.

I was actually looking for a recipe that was similiar to this but much better it appeared in the July (I believe) 1993 issue of Bon Appetit can anyone help me find this one. Thank you

I like all of these flavors individually but they just tasted strange together.

I feel so strongly about this recipe I had to write a review to save others the time of making it. This is terrible-the flavors just don't meld. My family all said it was a no !!

Warning: spicier than you'd expect. Try cutting the jalapeno down to half. Delicious with the Black Bean Cakes on this website.

Very pretty. I like it but it was missing something-needs a kick(Perhaps a TBL of chopped calamata olives?.

i quadrupled the recipe. there were no leftovers. many guests were asking what the dish was and wanted to know the ingredients. one person even said they would never eat regular coleslaw again. this was a hit! i will make again.

Very yummy coleslaw. For best results, I suggest letting it marinate for at least a couple hours before eating. Mine marinated in the fridge overnight and was absolutely delicious.

This was definitely easy to make on a weeknight. And, if you don't like spicy, take it easy on the jalapeno. It definitely adds a big kick. We like spicy and I only added 1/2 of a larger jalapeno. I also think you need a bit more olive oil and lime juice, I thought it was a bit dry.

I wasn't thrilled. The jalepeno made it way too spicy. I threw out almost entire batch

this is very good, refreshing in the heat of summer. I added about two tablespoons or more of chopped salad olives.

I liked this recipe a lot but my husband thought it was so-so. I took it to a BBQ and everyone seemed to like it a lot. I love cilantro so I added a little extra. This slaw was a nice change from the ordinary.

Delicious! Served with Halibut and Red Pepper Skewers with Chili-Lime Sauce from "The Flavors of Bon Appeptit" 2002

I love this recipe. It's a nice flavorful alternative to regular boring coleslaw. It goes great with almost any grilled meat. Any leftovers are great also.

I always increase the cumin in recipes, but don't be tempted to do that in this one. It's just right. This goes well with the Mexican-Style Chicken Sandwich on this site.
