This was one of the best dishes I've made. I really couldn't believe how good it was, and can't wait to make it again!

This recipe sounded very likable and I wanted to like it. However I didn't and neither did my family. I made it exactly as written. It wasn't terrible, just not very good. Baked turkey tenderloins get a little rubbery (cooked them to exacly 160) and turkey and pesto don't do anything for each other. The flavors don't work together and end up tasting like somewhat bland turkey with well..pesto on it. Despite closing them tightly and putting the cut side up, all the cheese melts out and ends up in the pan, which is the best part - melted crispy cheese with pesto in it. It looks beautiful though.

Wish I could give it 2.5 forks! This was very good, a perfect mid-week meal as it took less than 15 minutes to make. The paired flavors of the pesto and provolone were very tasty. Even though I secured the breasts with toothpicks, the cheese still managed to ooze out of the chicken. No matter, though, as it pooled around the chicken breast and browned in a lacy pattern, and I was able to lift the cheese and the breast together with a spatula. It looked like I had done it on purpose, tasted great and was quite pretty. I also topped the breasts w/ a half slice of cheese in the last 5 minutes. This will definitely go into the rotation!

Fabulous make ahead dish! I like to add sun dried tomato or roasted red pepper for added zing and color. serve it with spinach topped tomatoes, beautiful combination.

This recipe was very easy to make! While this is cooking, I kept opening the oven and spooning the oil back on to the meat. It's full of flavor and if you get the right kind of pesto, you don't need to do much in seasonings. One suggestion I have is that it should probably stay in the oven for more than 20 minutes.

This is really, really good. I was skeptical because I wasn't wild about the pesto that I had, but the combination with the cheese was perfect. This is really rich and I find I can't eat it too often, once every couple of months.

This was so good and so easy! The hardest part was finding a way to keep all the pesto and cheese in, but, as another reveiew suggested, we just propped the tenderloin against the side of the pan and it worked just fine.

This is a delicious combination of flavors and SOOO easy! I used shredded Italian cheese (provolone, mozzarella, parmesan, romano) and it was fabulous. A wonderful weeknight dinner but good enough to serve to company. I will definitely make this again (starting this weekend!)

Awesome dish! Increased the pesto and served it over pasta, to die for. Next time may substitute fresh mozarella for the provolone.

When I brought turkey tenderloins home from the marked-down section at my supermarket, I came to epicurious.com to see what I might do with them. OH MY GOSH, this was THE answer! DELICIOUS, and so very easy (unless you count that I never quite got the hang of skewering the sides together with toothpicks. So I cooked them in a casserole dish tilted up a bit so all the cheese and pesto wouldn't run out.) NOTES: I did cook a bit longer to get the temp up to 160. And I subbed Jarlsberg for Provolone. I debated on 4 forks, so don't be let down by my "3" rating! Served with stuffed tomatoes, and steamed veggies (grn bns, crookneck squash, onions). Would serve to company for my most elegant of meals!

Good, and very easy to whip up. Surprisingly low fat content. Less than I would have thought...

Could this be any easier?! I make this during the week with chicken when I want a 'decent' meal without much prep. Wonderful!

Excellent! I used a homemade pesto that I had in the freezer, and it came out great.

Delicious--a great weeknight dinner for a busy cook! I agree with Bay Harbor Islands though--watch carefully for overcooking. A couple of the smaller tenderloins got a little dry. I fixed this by melting another provolone slice on top of the dryer pieces in the microwave. I think this is destined to be a staple for us.

Even if you are having a bad cooking day, this is awesome!

It's quick. It's easy. And if you have home made pesto lying about in the freezer, it's even better!

I loved it. It's easy to make and my whole family loved it. I served it with couscous and a ceaser salad.

This is a fast dinner. It was ready in no time. Don't over cook the turkey. You can even put the dish together the night before and just pop it in the oven when you get home in the evening. I served this with the broccoli with garlic and lemon. Hmmmm good
