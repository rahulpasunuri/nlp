Excellent results, and others did, I used the carcass and skin from a 4lb chicken (organic, from Trader Joe's) I had roasted the day before. Since the meat portion was decreased so much, I halved all the remaining ingredients and simmered it uncovered for about two hours. It made 5 cups of delicious stock.

Agree with most reviewers. I used the chicken carcass from a Sams Rotisserie Chicken and less water. No need to waste the chicken! We do not like dark meat, so it was an excellent way to turn lemons into lemonade. Also aded some Spring greens that were likely to spoil. Tip: Store in zip lock bags flat. After frozen, you can stack them (like a folder) in your Freezer door shelves.

Made with leftover turkey - threw in carrots, celery, onion, green onion, brussels sprouts, and garlic - since thats what I had on hand. This was delicious! Easy, just let it go at a rolling simmer for a few hours. Then turned it into a spicy kale & turkey soup!!

This stock is well worth the time. It's simple, and when you make it the whole house fills up with a delicious chicken stock smell. Instead of a whole chicken, I roast a chicken, then use the carcass. Then, I make chicken soup with the stock and leftover meat from the roasted chicken. Best chicken soup ever. The unpeeled onions make a nice golden stock.

Best stock recipe I have found...and I have been looking. I also add a couple of garlic cloves. One variation I do when schedule dictates is to pile all the incredients into my crock pot and cook it overnight on low (8hrs). Doesn't seem to change the taste or consistency. And, my biggest trip is to freeze the stock in a couple of ice cube trays. Once they set up, I pop them out and put them in a freezer bag. Can pull out as much or as little as I need...great to add a cube to mashed potatoes or stir fry.

This is a great recipe I've used for years and years. One tip I would add is to freeze it in zip-loc bags, 2 c. each. Stacks perfectly in the freezer with all the soups that I've stored the same way. To thaw, simply put it in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes.

This is a fantastic stock. I've made stock before, but this was the most flavorful! However, I did alter the recipe based on what was in my kitchen: 2 thawed chicken carcasses, 2 large onions, 5+ small garlic cloves (the ones that are so tiny you don't want to futz with them), carrots, cilantro stems, 5 oldish mushrooms, some cumin seed. Didn't have any celery because I hate it in anything. Think I used 20 cups of water to cover everything. So then it all came to a boil for a second and then simmered very low for about 4 hours. From that it made about 8 cups of stock that was very condensed and i added a couple of cups of water after straining and then made some really excellent chicken and lime (instead of lemon) soup, based on the soup mentioned by the reviewer below. Tres bon!

Made this for the first time tonight, and it was fabulous. So much flavor. I did make sure to skim the fat off as it simmered, as we made a turkey broth a few weeks ago where I didn't skim it off and it was WAY to oily for leftovers. I used the broth as a starter for the Chicken Soup with Orrechette and Lemon recipe from this site. Excellent.

Consistently excellent. Like the reviewer from New Jersey, we prepare a quantity and freeze it in plastic containers for later use. It is important not to bring it to a rolling boil lest the fat and stock emulsify, making the stock cloudy and oily. Better to bring it initially to a very gentle boil and then reduce the heat to low and simmer for a long time.

This recipe first appeared in Gourmet October 1989. I've been making it since then using my left over over stuffer roasters and chicken parts. It is far beyond compared to the canned chicken broth in the store. I freeze it in plastic containers and i always have chicken stock on hand.
