This made a bit more dressing than the vegetables needed, but I added half a head of radicchio and enjoyed it all the more.

I've made this many times and every time I do I get asked for the recipe! I never eat plain green beans any more :-) A great dish for summer parties and cookouts as it can sit at room temp and is still tasty. I find that making it too far ahead ahead dulls the flavor though - no more than a couple of hours.

Very easy and a great change to the typical green salad. I thought this was very tasty. I let it chill for about an hour with the dressing on and it was great.

After tasting the dressing I wasn;t sure about it, so I served it on the side. I shouldn't have worried. The sweetness compliments the salted beans and tart radishes, and this salad is refreshing, tasty, and aesthetically pleasing. I did use less balsamic vinegar than called for though.

This was a nice change from your ordinary salads. Crisp and cool (I liked it chilled), plus I used the leftover dressing I had for my green salad - very good.
