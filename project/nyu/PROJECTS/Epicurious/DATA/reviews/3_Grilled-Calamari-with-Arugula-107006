Not sure why, but we needed to cook this much longer than described. It was very nice when eaten with the salad, but I guess it wasn't quite what we were expecting.

Used smaller squid on a grill pan. Regret opening the tubes, because they curled up on the grill pan anyway (too small to skewer). Recommend keeping the squid "calamari style" by cutting the tubes into rings. Pretty tasty but a definitely requiring some practice determining when squid is done. In fear of creating rubber bands, had a few undercooked, yuck!

This is quick but yields ok results. I've tried this twice on a grill pan (in a city kitchenette) without the skewers. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The calamari is a little tough and the arugala excessive. This recipe isn't quite good enough to make it into the rotation.

Very good. I didn't want to use the smaller squid so I had the fishmonger tenderize a calamari steak (scored and pounded thin). I BBQ the steak for just a few minutes and then sliced. It was excellent and no chewiness.

I'm not a big salad fan, so I omitted the arugula. I did the calamari on my George Foreman grill, which is fantastic, because it keeps them flat enough that you don't need to bother with skewers. I mixed a can of sardines with the cooked calamari, and it was fabulous!

Tried this b/c I find arugula and squid are addictive . Excellent results with the only negative being that it was quite time consuming if made for a group of 10 like I made it for. Next time I will use common sense keeping the group smaller. It really is a great combination of flavors. Also, the scoring process of the squid really helps to tenderize it.

Excellent, easy, and fresh way to prepare squid. I used frozen squid which I have never bought before and found it was just as good and tender. I thought the marinade was just right for the squid, but too "lemony" for the arugula dressing. Will omit the salad next time - love the squid on it's own too - or prepare a simple olive oil and lemon dressing for the arugula.

A great, simple recipe.

Delicious and easy! I first made it quite like the recipe - but - squid have such a delicate flavor that I would recommend simply grilling them on a high heat grill pan seasoned lightly with salt and pepper, and tossing the dressing over arugula. The squid have a nice char-grill flavor that way, it's easier, the grill doesn't go juicy, and the sauce is still distinctive on the salad. Fabulous non-fried way to enjoy squidlies.

I made this on an indoor, stovetop grill and it was still great. The lemon really added a lot of flavor.

This one is a classic. Its always an inexpensive crowd pleaser.

This is a winner. I made this for a light summer dinner with crusty bread and a wine. I doubled the garlic, threw in a tablespoon or so of oregano and let the calamari marinate for about an hour. Cooking time of 3 minutes over hot coals was perfect. This would be an outstanding first course salad/appetizer.
