Great flavor! I actually didn't have any cream on hand so had to substitute fat free evaporated milk (I hear the groans!). Believe it or not, it was still delicious. I can only imagine how good it would have been with the cream; I probably would've given it 4 forks.

Lovely and very easy. I also added garlic, and used sole instead (as that was all I could find at the store that day).

We loved it so much that we served it at a dinner party with steaks for the meat-eaters and red snapper for the fish-eaters and it was equally tasty with both steak and fish. My only change was adding 3 minced cloves of garlic. I think garlic improves everything.

I used shallots instead of the onion. It was tasty for a weeknight dinner, but not so special as to serve to friends.

REally delicious and easy to make, although I changed the red snapper for sole and the sherry for dry red wine. I will definetely make it again!
