Doesn't need the mayo. I also grew up with this, which was usually on the table at "covered dish suppers" (aka potlucks) next to Lime Jello Cottage Cheese Marshmallow Surprise (there's a great song on this one) and some Glorified Rice. Once a year or so this stuff is still fun.

Can't believe the food snobs.......I had never eaten this till I visited my Aunt's mid western hotel and this was the hot item on the buffet every Sunday afternoon. Shared space with prime rib. She called it Millionairs Salad. I loved every spoonful and still do. Actually my very LA daughter asked for the recipe when she was home for Christmas. Said they just can't make it out there as she remembered it. to each his/her own........

My mother made a similar salad for every holiday, one handed down through her family. In hers, mayo was the only dressing and she used one fresh apple, a fresh orange, a grapefruit, a can of mixed fruit and celery for the crunch. This salad isn't for everyone, but for those of us who grew up eating it in all its many variations, it's fantastic!

My mother-in-law makes this. Just horrible. And probably part of the reason why my father-in-law needed coronary bypass surgery!

I bet it's called "icy" because just reading the list of ingredients give you the shivers...

I have made this with sour cream, no cool whip, no whipped cream. Loved it the way I made it. We call it 24 Hour Mandarin Fruit Salad, but I have heard it called Ambrosia, even though the "real" Ambrosia is orange or grapefruit sections with coconut. A co-worker makes this dish this way without the mayo. I don't think people should knock it without trying it first.

i am only replying cause i was reading this recipe before i think i know why some of the ingerents in it floop. even though i didn't make it yet. i think sometimes if you used mayo in it and with sweet stuff the taste balance may be a little off too some taste buds.

disgusting. totally inedible. if you wouldn't eat it as a child, maybe you should have stuck with that.

I can't believe it! Someone brought this drek to a potluck at work and said that she got the recipe from Epicurious and here it is! It was sickening sweet, tasted tinny and had a greasy mouth-feel. This is NOT the Ambrosia recipe I got from my very southern grandmother! Her recipe has freshly sectioned oranges, fresh pineapple and fresh grated coconut. I add honey, Grand Marnier and Morello cherries. When done right - this dish is truly ambrosial.

I am considered one of the best cooks around and yes, I can master just about any recipe given to me to try. I am disgusted by the snooty food-snobs who won't even give this recipe a try. It is sweet, creamy comfort food at it's best. It's all right if you don't want to try it but why put those of us who are TRULY good cooks (because we don't turn our nose up at something before tasting it) down? I'm betting a bunch of you guys will try it when nobody's around.... like my ex-sister-in-law who requested a low fat pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving but was caught sneaking a big old piece of pecan pie when she thought nobody was looking! Hysterical!!!!

This frozen fruit salad is served at family reunions all over the South. If you want to taste one very small piece of the South, make this for your family. But make sure you give it time to start to melt so you can scoop up the run off. It's delicious. While looking up this Southern dish, I was much more entertained with all of the reviews. If the recipe sounds "nausiating," don't make it. And what moron wastes everyone's time leaving a comment when they haven't even tried it? PS: MAYO goes into all Southern creamy "salads."

I'd like to think that I've grown out of liking this stuff. it's the kind of thing you pass on until everyone has gone home and you're all alone with it...

I agree with all of the negative reviews - you have to have been raised on this (and I suspect will be lowered in it too - sugar, fat - yuck!) and therefore presumably know the "recipe" already. Make sure you know your guests' tastes before inflicting this on them.

All told, I grew up in the south (north Florida) and I put REAL mayo in every salad I know of... including ambrosia and waldorf!!!!

Well, I agree with the person who said that the true Southern recipe calls for sour cream instead of mayonnaise. As for the rude comment made about this recipe and the lack of taste on the part of Epicurious editors all I have to say is don't knock it until you've tried it!

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed reading these comments. Especially the bad ones from people who haven't even tried the stuff. Don't knock it until you try it! Sure, it's not a "gourmet" recipe like most of us are used to making, but for many of us proud Yankees and Southerner's alike, it's a great reminder of our childhoods.

saw it before on here. made it for a party, people loved, i just kinda liked it but it was easy to make so i will make it again.

The problem with this recipe is the mayo. This is actually a recipe for a favorite southern dish - Ambrosia. However, I don't know a single southern cook who makes Ambrosia with mayonnaise. That said, skip the mayo and use 1/3 to 1/2 cup sour cream instead, as a chef below suggested. It adds a nice, balancing depth to the dish.

while looking for a healthy salad to serve lunchtime guests, I stumbled upon this thing. (Doesn't Epicurious have some editing power? This sounds nausiating and isn't what I would expect to find as representative of Gourmet and Bon Appetit Magazine!)

Instead of the fattening and cholesterol loaded mayonnaise and Cool Whip the original recipe called for, I used non-fat vanilla yoghurt. Delicious. My yoghurt was pretty firm - but if it had been watery I would have drained it in a fine sieve. I also used pineapple and mandarin oranges in juice (not syrup). So I ended up with a delightfully creamy and crispy-crunchy dessert. Those of you who are squeamish should try the yoghurt substitution. Also I didn't add the maraschino cherries. I'd only ever had this dish in school cafeterias but had always liked it. I'm going home to whip some up tonight - my appetite for it has been whetted.

Oh come on! This is great stuff and definitely has its place. I prefer to leave out the coconut (interupts the creamy consistency) and use sour cream in place of the mayo. I could eat buckets! Don't let it sit too long, though. The marshmallows will eventually disappear.

Not going to try this one. Nothing like edible oil products and red dye #2 to ruin some reasonably good ingredients. It's amazing what you pull up when searching for fruit salad.

My (very southern)mom has made this for years -- minus the mayo/Miracle Whip. We kids simply referred to it as "Pink Stuff" (as opposed to the "Orange stuff" that she made as a dip for seafood.) It always brings holidays and hot summer days to mind for me -- great memories of the "good old days."

Salad, dessert, snack, breakfast, whatever...this is great! We grew up calling this type of thing Glop, and we lived throughout this country and a couple of others, making Glop converts. Our roots are definately Southern, but this recipe 'travelled' better than grits or fried okra. Come on, people, what's not to like?

I have made this wild mess for years.. my children's brains are brilliantly contributing to our country fed each and every winter holiday on it! I don't use mayo.. I use the cool whip and sour cream! And.. the secret is.. I sneak bits and bites of it as long as it lasts while putting my haughty cuisined noise in the air and trip off to Jano's in Tucson! LOL

Coming from a family who loves this stuff, I thought it was pretty good, though the friends I served it to didn't take to it. An acquired taste, I guess.

In my northern British Columbia home, this dish was greeted with cries of delight. My mother called it "Ambrosia Salad", and made it in a gallon bucket. I still have wonderful memories of the meals that included, what to us, was an all-to-rare treat.

I'm so glad to see that I'm not the only person who couldn't stomach this horrible dessert. My boyfriend's family loves it and they look at me like I've grown a third head when I turn it down!

I was lucky enough not be subjected to this as a child but my mother-in-law makes something very similar. It has canned mandarin & pineapple, almonds, marshmallow, sour cream & coconut. I am quite happy to avoid it at family get-togethers. A friend of mine remembers that her mother used to make it and they called it Heavenly Hash.

My mom made this during the holidays, too! I loathed it....still do! You are absolutely right about it being *pink* and too full of fruit cocktail. However, I'm the only one in the family who won't eat it!!
