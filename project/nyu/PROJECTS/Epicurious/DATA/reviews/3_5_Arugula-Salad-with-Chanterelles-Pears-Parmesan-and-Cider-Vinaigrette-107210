This was easy and excellent. The dressing is delicious. You can use a Granny Smith apple in place of the pear too.

This salad is so easy yet looks so elegant and tastes phenomenal! Make sure to add the salt and pepper to taste- 1/2 t in the mushrooms might be a bit much.

What it's missing is bacon! Seriously. I added just once slice of carefully cooked, crispy, nitrate free bacon to each plate and the flavors picked up enormously. The extra richness and saltiness helps balance the other elements. I've made it with both chanterelles and shitakes and prefer shitakes as their plumpness makes for a better textural contrast. I also like to do a traditional radicchio, arugula, endive mix for color. I also sometimes substitute high quality sherry vinegar in the dressing.

A great recipe with a very specific taste. I added some cayenne pepper to the dressing and the mushrooms to give it a kick.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. The flavors work wonderfully together. Baby Bellas or Cremini mushrooms work just fine, you don't need the Chanterelles. The only thing you should be careful of is the amount of salt and pepper added to the mushrooms. I cut the salt a tiny bit.

I served this alongside the roasted tomato soup on this website. What a great cool-weather combo. No chanterelles at my local mushroom mongers, so I used 1/2 lb fresh oyster mushrooms and 1/2 lb fresh shiitake. My wife and daughter thought it was ambrosia. It was so-so for me (where's the beef?).

Pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind. Would give it 2 1/2 if I could. I made this twice. The second time I was in a hurry so I just used the chantarelles raw (I don't think I'd try that with any other wild mushroom). It was still pretty good, but of course much lighter and less complex. Really good Parmesan might be the key to this one; it gave a really nice salty/nutty contast to the pears.

This was big hit; the flavors work perfectly together. I used shitake mushrooms as they were easier to find.

The salad was nice - I generally favor a dressing that is not "too sweet", but this dressing was found to be a little bitter. Might add a touch more honey next time.

While a nice salad, nothing spectacular...thought the dressing was very blah..it needs something to make it more exciting

The salad was great, but I agree that it wouldn't be so special without the chanterelles. That said, I do still question whether the expense was worth the result.

Surprisingly nice dressing- not overly sweet as I feared.

This salad was a smash with all my dinner guests. Next time I will make double the portion due to its overwhelming success. It was the perfect touch to a fall meal.

The chanterelles make the dish, although make it quite expensive. Otherwise it's boring. The combo has been done too often...Pears and Parm becomes a cliche. This version however is quite good.
