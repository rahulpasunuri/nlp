I made it exactly as written, served it at a dinner party, and it was absolutely fantastic... can't wait to make it again!

I'm not going to rate this recipe as I changed it quite a bit. I mixed oil, garlic, onion, tomatoes, and spinach in a pan over moderately high heat until wilted. I then brushed mixture of salt, garlic, and olive oil over focaccia bread and on one side put parmesan cheese and broiled for a few minutes. Took out the bread and put the veggie mixture on and had an adorable little sandwich. EXCELLENTE!

Nothing special...even with the sun dried tomatoes.

I made this over the weekend. It was wonderful! I used the suggestion of adding sun-dried tomato pesto and it make it even better. There was nothing left at the end of the evening...darn it!

Allthough I am only 13 I love cooking. This dish is delicious. I eat it all the time and my family loves it.

I made this to accompany a soup dinner. My husband didn't care for them. I used both arugula and spinach and added a little extra garlic & cheese. In general, they weren't very flavorful.

We used spinach instead of the arugala, and used "smoked Gouda" for the cheese. That was great right there, but then we added two small fresh tomatoes and that makes it about perfect! Just smelling the garlic, sauteed spinach and smoked gouda is enough to make my mouth water for it now! In the last two weeks, we've already made this three times!

Very nice. Tastes exactly like you would expect it to from reading the recipe. Just keep in mind that the arugala will cook down a lot, so it will not make as much as you might initially expect.

this was amazing! i am a garlic freak, so this was absolutely heavenly. i used spinach instead of arugula and added even MORE garlic. i also spread some sun-dried tomato pesto on the toast before serving--it added a nice sweetness!! i have already made this twice and would not hesitate to do so again...

I made this on a large crusty italian loaf which was a bad idea. When broiling, the edges crisped up too much and the rest didn't get hot at all. A great alternative tho is to make this dish with spinach and instead of putting in on the toasts, put it in a wrap, broil and serve. Extremely good.

Wonderful! I also added sundried tomatoes and loved the effect. My husband truly enjoyed them and normally hates greens. Definitely a success.

Excellent and fairly quick and easy! Definitely a keeper! I added chopped fresh tomatoes and it really made a wonderful hors d'ouerve.

I modified this recipe a little bit... in that I prepared the toasts and spinache as directed but I used those elements to go with a "tapas" kind of platter I like to prepare at least once each summer. I'll have goat cheese, olives and roasted red peppers all to spread on bruchetta with the garlic sauteed spinache! Yummy! And we also had cold veal with tuna sauce... great! Very much reminded me of a lunch we had in Rome last summer when we let the waiter bring us whatever the restaurant did best! No regrets at all!!

A great version of bruschetta. I've also tried it with chopped, sauted tomatoes, and basil instead of the greens. Very good with basil stuffed chicken.

I thought it was very good. WARNING: You must love garlic. I made it for a company party and got rave reviews. For an added ingredient I put in chopped sundried tomatoes. I'd like to know what others thought of it!
