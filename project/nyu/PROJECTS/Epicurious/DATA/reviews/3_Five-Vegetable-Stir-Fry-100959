An OK dish but not everyones favorite and not one they would hate....I'd make it again when I don't what to serve I always have these ingredients in fridge.

Loved this dish. Very simple to make. I had no mint in the house but it was still very tasty. Tanya

I've made this recipe and I love it. I didn't find it bland at all with the mint and homemade chicken broth. It's a fantastic accompaniment to a spicy chinese or thai dish, esp. in winter.

When I reviewed the ingredients for this recipe, it didn't sound very flavorful, (no ginger hot pepper sauce...) but after reading the 2 cooks' reviews, I thought I'd try it..... Well, BLANDSVILLE is exactly what my husband called it. There's no taste to it at all. Its just a bunch of vegetables in chicken broth. Very very disappointing....especially after all of that chopping..........

I made this last Sunday for the wife and kids to rave reviews. I added 20 minutes to the cook time as suggested and a can of water chestnuts near the end. Threw in 3 legs and a back of some left over BBQ chicken. GREAT! Served on top of a bed of our house fried dragonfly brand rice (best fluff) and it was wonderfull. By the way, the secret to GREAT TWICE FRIED "HOUSE" RICE is in the use of stale rice. Thats right, 24 hours old rice! (I leave it in my cubbord the night before). Try it, it makes a huge difference in the consistency and taste. Best kept Asian secret ever,'till now of course. Enjoy. Stefano

Just Loved It, were pretty leary aafter putting in the mint, but much to our surprise, was delicious. Would make an excellent side dish to any chinese dish. Would recommend you cook twice as long as it calls for.
