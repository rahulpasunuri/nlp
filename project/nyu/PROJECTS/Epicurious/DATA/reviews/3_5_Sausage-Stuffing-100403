With a few changes, this recipe turned out fabulous. The whole family enjoyed and how it is requested at every holiday meal. My changes include: pecans instead of chestnuts, added dried cherries, reduced the chicken stock by half to increase flavor and tripled the amount added to the stuffing (I started with 3 cups of quality broth, reduced it to 1.5 cups and added the entire amount to the stuffing). Dont ask me why, but half cup of broth left the stuffing very dry.

This is the perfect staple stuffing recipe. Instead of chestnuts, I use toasted pecans. I also love the tangy sweet chew of a handful of dried cranberries thrown in. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram to round out the spice mixture. The key is in the broth...use plain canned broth and you get a dull bread dish; use good stock that has been reduced down by 1/2 simmered with fresh herbs and veggies and you get outstanding stuffing. Enjoy! (As a vegetarian, I use Gimme Lean veggie sausage with incredible results...no one knows it is not the real thing).

I made this for my parents on Thanksgiving, and they thought it was fantastic! Instead of steamed chestnuts, I bought dried chestnuts and rehydrated them in a bowl of water overnight. Worked like a dream. I will definitely make again!

It sounds delicious and I would love to prepare this for Thanksgiving but I cannot find steamed chestnuts, only whole in a bag. Has anyone else had a hard time finding these? Even Williams-Sonoma only has them peeled in a jar not steamed. I do not have any experience with chestnuts so Im afraid to make my own substitutions especially on Thanksgiving!

We're fortunate to have a butcher in town who makes a fabulous maple sausage stuffing - and it adds an even richer flavor to this already great stuffing. So - this is now the official family stuffing and accompanies Thanksgiving turkey as well as the wonderful crown roast at Christmas.

Great, great recipe, even though I didn't follow exactly. As I had one of those 16oz jars of Williams-Sonoma chestnuts, I just HAD to use the whole thing. Substituted challah cubes (leftover from the Pumpkin Bread Pudding) and Pepperidge Farm original stuffing crumbs for the french bread crumbs, added more sausage and onion but only the required amount of sage & thyme as the PF stuffing already had spices. Wow! My first attempt at chestnut stuffing was a hit - a definite keeper. A new tradition on my holiday table.

I added coarsley ground pecans to this at it was outstanding. Also, I cut back on the sage because the sausage had enough flavor in it. Great

This stuffing was a hit at Christmas dinner. I used maple sausage stuffing and added chopped celery to the onion saute. I cheated a bit and used the pre-packaged herb stuffing cubes so cut back on the additional herbs. Definitely a keeper!

As a kid I remember my mother making Sausage Stuffing ( But not as good as this one ) I can't wait for Thanks Giving to try this one out on Mom and the rest of the family.
