While out picking the zucchini and herbs to go into this dish (parsley, oregano, and thyme), I decided to go with a suggestion from another reviewer and add some spinach. What a delicious dish! It's not the fanciest meal in the whole world but it certainly made for an exceptional Tuesday night meal.

This is so good... and easy! The best comparison I can think of is Mac n Cheese for epicurean adults. I took the suggestions here and added some lemon juice. Also, I used whole-wheat penne and it worked just fine.

Definitely delicious. I suggest adding a bit of lemon zest and juice, which was a lovely compliment to the herbs (for me: parsley, chives, and thyme).

A perfect weeknight recipe as most of the ingredients were already on hand. I used some chives, thyme, and parsley from the garden and doubled the garlic. I also added some frozen peas and jarred red bell pepper along with the zest of one lemon to brighten it up a bit. It was a big hit served with a green salad, and the leftovers were great as a cold lunch.

Quick, easy, fresh and full of flavor. Perfect recipe for your veggie friends. The goat cheese should be whole and not "goat cheese crumbles". If you get the cheese really cold, use dental floss to cut into pieces and add, the distribution of cheese around dish should hold up.

We thought this was pretty good. But I've already got a similar recipe in my collection (bow ties with zucchini), which I think is much better, so I don't think I'll make this again.

Zucks take some time to brown. Use a large pan to fry them because although they shrink a lot, in the beginning it's quite difficult to stir. Fry the zuck mixture (garlic & herbs) more than 1'. It gives time to the garlic to develop its flavour and loose its sharpness. Don't hold back on the seasoning with salt & pepper. Goat's cheese isn't enough to get it as salty. I used cilandro & parsley for the herb part. Oh, and I did put more garlic... I use 3 cloves. Not terribly quick dinner but reasonably easy to make with mimimal prep.

LOVE this. The ingredients are easy to get a hold of, it's super-easy, fairly healthy and delicious. Must husband actually lights up when I suggest it.

I thought this was a fabulous weekday meal, quick and easy and very tasty. I doubled the recipe, used fresh thyme, oregano and basil, but halved the pasta water. It was very creamy and yummy, and everyone gobbled it up. Next time I make it, I may try additional veggies (mushrooms? spinach?) or some cooked shredded chicken.

Do not attempt this dish if you do not have the freshest ingredients! It is BEST when made with FRESH herbs and zucchini. It is also served best hot.. right off the stove. Delicious!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish, but it needs a bit of color. Adding some sun-dried tomatoes would probably be the perfect touch. I put toasted pine nuts on top which added a nice crunch.

I've got to agree with the cook from Florida. My husband and daughter couldn't even finish it. I was pretty disappointed with it myself. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly it needed but it certainly lacked something.

This dish was O.K. It was just missing something, even with the flavor of goat cheese it still seemed bland.I would not make it again.

This is your basic easy dinner. It's quick, delicious and even relatively low-calorie. I will definitely be making this again!
