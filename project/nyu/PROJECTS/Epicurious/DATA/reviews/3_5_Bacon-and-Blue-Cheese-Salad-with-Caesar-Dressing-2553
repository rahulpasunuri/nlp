Bacon and blue cheese -- hard to go wrong!

Excellent! Instead of using the Worcestershire sauce, I used 1 tbsp. of a Thai Fish Sauce. The dressing was tasty, but not overwhelmingly salty like most Ceasar's salad dressings.

This was very good...my children (who do not usually eat salad) had seconds! I decreased the lemon juice to 2T, and added in 1T dijon mustard. I also threw in a handful of craisins.

I love this salad! It's one of my go-to salads. Tonight I subbed proscuitto instead as I had some proscuitto I needed to use. It was wonderful!

Used store bought croutons. Salad is delicious and the dressing is so easy!

Since I was looking for a traditional recipe and this was very bland, I added 1 egg yolk, 1 teaspoon of dijon, 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard, 3 tablespoons of lemon instead of 4 and 3 anchovies. Now we're talking ceasar dressing! Everyone's tips were helpful. Thanks!

Cutting back the lemon juice and adding a dollop of dijon mustard were key. Great homemade caesar taste without the raw eggs or anchovies, which I never seem to have on hand. And, MMMMMM, bacon.

Rating: 4
For a more classic taste I added 2 smashed anchovies & 1 egg yolk (in place of the extra 4T. of oil)as well as the recommended dijon and I think the dressing is perfect. The richness of the yolk balances the lemon beautifully. Very easy, flavorful dressing.

Wanted to serve Frisee salad and lardons (this site) but could not get frisee so I made this salad instead. I chose to use two pre-packaged romaine/other green lettuce/carrots mix as I agree this is not a classic caesar preparation. The dressing was wonderful indeed! I did heed others warnings and decreased the lemon juice to about 3 tablespoons, plus added a big teaspoon of dijon. Got rave reviews and requests to make it again soon.

This dressing is unbelievably easy and so good. I used slightly less lemon & still found it too strong, so I added some sugar and it was perfect.

I LOVE this salad, so did everyone I've made it for. Some readers said there was too much lemon so added more oil. Try adding some diced pear or apple, or dried cranberries.

If you don't like the lemon juice amount, add some diced pear, apple or dried cranberry. I LOVE this salad and so does everyone else I've made it for.

YUMMY!!!! This is a delicious sald. Caesar dressing YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!! HOWEVER, 1/4 lemon maybe a bit too much for everyone. Cut down a bit and if you want to add more then you can after you taste. Better safe than sorry. but YUMMY!!!!!!!!!! Will make LOTS more

Not only is this salad great, but I now make the dressing and croutons all the time. Even when I don't make the salad.

I guess the main attraction was the bacon and blue cheese.....not so great after-all....BUT the CAESAR SALAD WITH HOMEMADE CROUTONS & BALSAMIC DRESSING in the June 05 issue is absolutely wonderful..certainly with the freshly made croutons....this has become our favorite between these two. Enjoy! God Bless!

Easy and Excellent!! It was the hit of the meal, I will say the crutons were fabulous, I made them with whole wheat bread and also added a touch of garlic salt. REALLY good.

I, too, as another reviewer stated, sort of pride myself on my own Caesar dressing, but thought this sounded so easy and the reveiws were so good, I thought I'd give it a go. And I must agree, this is really good and so easy to make. Will absolutely use this again.

I never had such raves about a salad before! The croutons were also so yummy! Everyone wants me to make it again for the Fourth of July picnic.

This recipe was just exelent. i made it with grilled chicken breast`s, but without bluecheese. it was one of the best sallad`s i`ve ever tasted.

Took this to a dinner party last week. Raves all the way around. For the croutons, I used a multi grain french bread whith seeds in it. Once toasted, the croutons had a nutty flavor that blended nicely.

Oh my goodness! Delicious! I've made Caesar dressing before with the traditional egg and anchovies but this recipe was so much better. Used about half the lemon juice. Everyone I serve it to just love it -- even my finicky sister who usually only eats salads with Italian dressing. I've also made it with some diced chicken breast on top for a heartier dish.

Excellent! We live in the heart of cajun country where food is the center of everything. This salad was a major hit. The second time I made it I used a little less lemon juice and add a bit more garlic (like I said we are in cajun country!) Overall, a great and easy salad!

This was excellent. I served it as a first course. My son, who is not a salad eater, has already asked me to make it again. I did cut back on the lemon juice a bit having read other reviewer's comments but otherwise made exactly as written. The garlic is yummy.

I am just getting around to writing a review of this even though I have made it at least a dozen times. I make the exact recipe-it is FANTASTIC.

Everyone loved this dressing, definitely a hit! The croutons were excellent, they were missing a little bit. I made this twice, and the second time was smart enough to double the dressing. Add a little extra garlic, and a little less lemon...refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. I also found it easier to use pre-washed and cut lettuce in the package. This was the highlight of the meal, and the dressing can be used to spice up the simplest salads.

i thought this was a very good recipe.i use this with a lot of my meals.my company compared it to a fine dinning restuarant recipe.i added a few anchovies for extra flavor.

Found the dressing to be a bit tart...added a bit more oil...still too tart so I put in dab of poupon...Now it is just fine...Will try again when I make the complete salad...I just wanted for the dressing..So for those who wish only the dressing...watch the lemon...

This is fabulous!! It tastes like a fancy resturant salad. The dressing is incredible, and the croutons are worth the effort! I highly recommend this salad. It will be a staple for dinner parties from now on.

This was delicious, although, I think I should have put more dressing on the salad, but I didn't want to soak it since there was so much dressing to work with. I too added some parsley to the croutons, and added grape tomatoes and grilled chicken to make a total meal. Delicious!

This recipe was GREAT!! I made this recipe for four hungry people, so I doubled the recipe. I also tried it with some chicken on top. It was absolutely delicious!!! The Caesar Dressing was the best I ever tasted.

Liked it alot... After my lab ate my 1/2 pound of Maytag Blue, which I had a heck of a time finding in my suburbia location, I had to use Stilton instead which was okay. Still bummed about loosing all that cheese :) Will make again!

I am known for my caesar salad and this dressing was way better than mine. The second time I made it, I added anchovy paste, but it wasn't as good for some reason. I also added a little fresh parsley to the crouton mixture which I think is nice.

To increase the ease of this recpie, I used purchased caesar dressing and some croutons that I had already made. I also added some cherry tomatoes. I love romaine because it keeps so well. However, if I ever have spinach that I need to use, I will consider this recipe because I think it would work well.

I give this four forks because it's just about identical to the Maggiano's Salad at the local Maggiano's restaurants here in town, and I adore that salad. As the restuarant does, I used turkey bacon to get a well-done taste and added sliced red onions. Just delicious! I served this with a beef tenderloin with red wine and porcini sauce. It made for a nice summer evening meal.

It was very good and easy to make, my family loved it, however, unless you really love garlic, cut the amount in half

The bacon blue cheese salad was delicious,however the dressing was alittle too thick and salty for my taste. When I make it again I will decrease the amount of parmesan and add a little more olive oil than the recipe calls for.

All the components came together to form a very yummy caesar salad. I added olives as well. I used to use a traditional caesar dressing recipe from Betty Crocker, but I'm switching to this one. It has a creamier, more robust taste. Very easy to make too!

I made this salad for my family in 1991 when the recipe was first published. We still make it today! A family favorite!
