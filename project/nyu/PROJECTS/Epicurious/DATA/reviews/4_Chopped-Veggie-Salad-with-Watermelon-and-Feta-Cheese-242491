I made this salad for my girlfriends on a hot Saturday afternoon with white wine and some other snacks. It was light and refreshing and everyone couldn't get enough of it! I made it ahead of time and poured the dressing on top at the time of serving it, it looked terrific!

Loved the flavors in this salad. Refreshing for summer. But as other reviewers noted, this is very runny even when I took their advice and drained tomatoes and watermelon beforehand. When I added the dressing (and I only added 3/4 of the thick dressing... seeemed like enough) it just started producing all this liquid! Definitely drain some before bringing to the table. Would have been 4 stars if not for the runniness.

This is/was--cause we ate it all and with delight--what I call a "double yum". After driving 7 hours in 103 degree EST coast temperature, this salad was crisp, delicious, interesting, and worth every chop. Thanks and I will have it again in less trying circumstances.

I am not a vegetarian but I do enjoy my servings of fruit and vegetables every day that I can with a good variety of everything. The watermelon adds something very special to this salad along with the cucumber and green pepper that give a pleasant crunch in every bite. I would probably leave out the tomatoes next time and enjoy the pleasant flavor blends that make this salad a winner for a summer delight in the late evening.

Nice combo of textures, but this was missing something - hot I think. If I were to make again I think I'd add diced jalapeno - or throw some sriracha into the dressing. Not sure. Definitely need quite a bit of salt - even with the feta I had to add more than I would have ordinarily thought.

Absolutely fabulous and enjoyed by everyone. Have made 6 times since. Will be with me for the rest of my life. A great way to use feta and surprisingly delicious.

Wow - this was delicious on a late summer evening. As suggested, I let the tomatoes and watermelon drain in a colander while I was chopping the other ingredients. Despite some trepidation about how all the ingredients would meld together, I stuck to the recipe, used every last ingredient including the oregano, and was glad I did. I only mixed in half the dressing (honestly, it looked pretty good without the dressing.) Next time I might go easy on the feta, but I will definitely make this again.

This is a great summer salad. I left out the mint and skipped the yogart. The olive oil was suffient dressing. I also used the smallest melon baller tool on the watermelon instead of cutting it up this kept some of the water out of the salad. Everyone raved about it.

We used dried dill instead of fresh mint and it turned out great.

Although I don't eat bell pepper, I thought this salad sounded good. There were green Kumato tomatoes (to substitute for the bell pepper AND tomato) and a small container of cubed watermelon at the market yesterday, so when I came home I immediately started chopping. There can be something very relaxing about chopping. Had the chopped tomatoes resting on paper towels before I dumped them in. As the name implies, there is water in watermelon, so there was no point in trying to drain that. And I ignored the mint, yogurt and oregano part! No dressing. Didn't miss it. Ate more for breakfast with a boiled egg and feel very healthful and noble, because I've started the day with vegetables and fruit.

Living with several girls in college, this was the most craved and raved about dish we ever made. We would typically skip the bell pepper and include as much watermelon and feta as possible. Honestly, the whole thing would be gone in a matter of an hour. LOVE!!

I thought this lacked punch. I added lime juice which was helpful. I have better watermelon salad recipes and would not bother with this again. The combination of all the ingredients did not meld together well.

To reduce the liquid, I chopped all the solid ingredients into a sieve, covered the sieve with plastic wrap, set it over a bowl in the refrigerator until I was ready to serve. Then I put the contents into the serving bowl, mixed the dressing in and served. Wasn't watery until the last spoonful. This was delicious!

it's um a chopped salad... with watermelon. i really liked it. the watermelon was elusive--every once in a bite, you'd get a soft crunch and sweetness. very subtle, very good. i left out the dried oregano. it'd be musty and nasty.

I love feta cheese!!! Excellent little recipe, so tasty! Try momskitchenrecipes.com for a great variety of recipes like this :)

I made this for a Memorial Day party and it was well-received. I plan to make it again when friends come in from out of town later this month, but will delete the radishes (too sharp) and will probably cut back on the scallions. I have traveled extensively in the Middle East, and this is indeed a part of breakfast (though not always mixed together as a salad). I don't think I ate one meal without watermelon and eggplant! Thank goodness, I love both!

Delicious salad. I served it as part of an appetizer spread before a BBQ. I followed the recipe and drained some yogurt in the fridge over night. Using the thickened yogurt, my salad was not at all runny. I drained a whole quart of yogurt but have found that the remaining thickened yogurt comes in handy for all sorts of recipes. Several Turkish recipes use the thickened yogurt.

Watermelon, feta and vegetables -- who knew? Delicious. Ate it alongside chicken Gyros.

The only reason I don't give it 4 is that the rest of people in my party didn't find it as good as I thought. I reduced the cheese and the mint the second time and liked the bit milder taste that resulted. I also left out the green onion from the salad but what belonged in the dressing.

I'm addicted to this salad even if there is alot of chopping. Wanting to keep the mixture for a day or two, I added a bit of oil and dressing as I wanted to eat it put 1 T of oil in the dressing and all the feta in the salad.

I made this salad without using any yogurt and without mixing anything in the food processor. Instead,I tossed everything together and left in the fridge for an hour before serving. The salad was wonderful, it wasn't runny at all. Very refreshing.

Very tasty salad, but as pointed out, very runny. We made this with only half the suggested cheese which we thought was plenty. Next time we make this we will not mix the dressing with the salad ahead of time (the salad is so pretty with the reds and greens but turns ugly beige with the dressing) and will give the salad a final 'drain' before bringing it to the table. Perfect with a grilled chiken breast or turkey breast cutlet

This was good, but I'm not sure it was worth all the work. Despite draining EVERYTHING for a good long time before assembling, it got very watery. When that happened, the dressing turned a "thousand island" color, which was pretty unappealing. It definitely does not resemble the photo. Not sure it was worth skipping my manicure to do all this chopping.

omitted the radishes and green pepper, served with slotted spoon. The dressing would be a good raita to be served with naan.

I made two changes to minimize how watery this is, based on reading the other reviews: 1. Substituted grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes. 2. Did not use olive oil. When I pureed the feta, mint, oregano, yogurt, it had the consistency of cream cheese. I drained the watermelon/vegetable mixture twice before adding the dressing, but still by the time I served it, it was watery. We served using a slotted spoon and everyone enjoyed it!!!

After reading the other reviews and comments I made two changes to minimize the watery nature: 1. Substituted grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes 2. Pureed the feta, mint, oregano, yogurt but did not use any olive oil. The feta, mint, etc had the consistency of cream cheese. Before adding the dressing, I drained the vegetables/watermelon mixture, but it was still watery. However, we used a slotted spoon to serve and everyone loved it!!!

This salad is very similar to one I eat everyday. It sounds absolutely delicious.

Great salad but as so many have said, very watery. I would recommend chopping the tomatoes and watermelon in advance and draining as this seems to be what generates most of the water.

I used grape tomatoes and did not bother to chop. I did not have green peppers or radishes on hand so added about a quarter thinly sliced sweet onion to add extra crunch and spice. I completely omitted olive oil, used regular fat free yogurt and just mashed together the dressing instead of blending. When eating the leftovers, I drained off any accumulated juices. Whole family enjoyed it - very good and the flavors were quite harmonious. I had the leftovers for breakfast!

I noted how many reviews had "watery" in them so I sqeezed the yogurt thru cheesecloth first. Drained all the veggies. It was fabulous. I also cooked some minced garlic in the olive oil & added that.

One of the best summer salads that I have made from epicurious! Perfect as is. I didn't mix the dressing in the food processor to keep it less watery. Would definitely make again.

I've made hundreds of recipes from Epicurious over the years and this is by far the worst. Yuck, double yuck. As most said it was very runny. I did drain the tomatoes and watermelon as suggested. It does take a long while to chop and the flavor or lack there of in the end is not worth the time.

Lovely combination of flavors. This was a hit on a lovely Summer afternoon and was easy to make for a large group. I used substantially less greek yogurt than the recipe stated and just stirred it in with the fruit and vegetables at the last minute so I didn't have the water issues that some had. Also, I let the watermelon and tomatoes drain for a while before mixing everything together. You can play with any combination of the vegetables depending on your taste, it always works. This is a keeper.

Perfect for a steamy night. I added lots of extra green onions (mine were small) and mint. I also used dannon nonfat yogurt, and did not mix it up in the food processor. The watermelon and tomatoes, even drained gave off a lot of juice - the thicker, non processed dressing kept it from being too runny.

Perfect for a hot day when you don't want to turn the oven/stove on. It's plenty hearty. My husband was suspicious at first but he loved it. The dressing would also be good on a regular old leaf salad!

very very runny .... I maybe had watery watermelon recommend cutting everything up first and letting it drain but super flavours and I agree don't need as much dressing

This salad was a fresh and interesting combination of flavors. It was a little bland, but I blame that on the tasteless tomatoes and not-quite ripe enough watermelon. Also the salad got watery after sitting in the refrigerator for a few hours -- recommend to mix in the dressing immediately before serving.

Salad was great! Perfect for a really hot summer day. Husband could not get enough. I used an entire cucumber and just 7oz. of cheese because that is the package that the store has. When I make this again, I will make a little less dressing.

This is going to be even better when tomatoes and watermelons are in season! That said, this is a really good, unique recipe and was a big hit at my memorial day BBQ.

This dish is excellent! I just made it this afternoon - and even my foodie husband thinks its great! Quick tip: Chop everything beforehand! This requires about 30 min of chopping.

I had some extra time today after having a 1/2 day at work, so I thought I would make this salad. I just fished it, and my husband and I are eating it and it is wonderful!!! The flavors are just beautiful - we're actually eating it with spoons because the sauce is to good. I actually forgot to buy green onions, so it would probably be even better with those...but I highly recommend it! A tip: chop everything beforehand!! This is about 45 min of chopping :-)
