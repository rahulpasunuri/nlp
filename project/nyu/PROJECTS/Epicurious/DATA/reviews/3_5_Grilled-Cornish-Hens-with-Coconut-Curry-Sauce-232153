The sauce is awesome. I made the same sauce with chunks of chicken breasts, red peppers and snow peas. I served it over Jasmine rice. Delish!

I love this recipe. I do it for a crowd while on vacation and use chicken breast , legs and thighs. I bake first then throw on the bbq. Lisa Wee Marin County

After I convinced my boyfriend to grill on a rainy Seattle November evening, I found that Cornish game hens are a pain to eat, I see. This was the first time I've tried them. I also agree with other reviewers that marinating didn't make much of a difference as far as I could tell. Even so, the sauce was pretty good and simple to make. Nice and spicy. I think if you took cooked chicken and shredded it into the sauce and then put it all over a plate of rice, it would be more satisfying.

I made this dish last evening and thoyght it was delicious. I willl make this sauce again, maybe next time with saefood. It reminds me of a dish we had at a Thai resturant in Vancouver.

I did not care for the sauce, though my husband liked it. I bought my cornish hens at our local farmer's market which made all the difference in the meatiness of the hens--these were far superior to those in grocery stores. The method produced a wonderfully brown and juicy bird--I did them in the oven and will keep that part of the recipe, but the sauce won't be a repeat.

Excellent sauce. Cornish hens not my favorite (too much trouble and not much meat), so use chicken breasts or thighs. Have had many requests for this one!

I agree with the previous reviewer. The sauce is really quite tasty on it's own, but it does not penetrate the meat at all. (I also used chicken breasts). That being said, it was a good recipe. I love curry (green or red) with coconut... but there are better recipes out there that can capture that taste.

We made the sauce/marinade exactly as per the recipe, but used chicken breasts instead of the hens, cooking them on a gas grill. We were really disappointed, especially after reading all the rave reviews. The flavours of the marinade didn't really seem to penetrate the meat all that well. So the end result was perfectly ok, but the flavour quotient was pretty low for all that effort.

this is almost identical to Thai-Curried game hens also on Epicurious, but after having made both, I think Thai Curried game hens recipe is MUCH BETTER and MUCH EASIER (don't have to reduce the sauce).

This recipe was delicious. I cooked the hens using indirect heat on our gas grill. I will try the sauce with fish and as the last cook suggested using pork sounds great too.

The coconut curry sauce is outstanding! It has a lot of heat, but it also packs complex flavors. It worked perfectly with the hens, but it would also be good with chicken or even pork. I am looking forward to making this many times in the years ahead.

Instead of fish sauce you may also use sea salt if you prefer. But a better approach may be to look for a high quality fish sauce, i.e. not one from the local supermarket. Look for an authentic Thai fish sauce like Golden Boy brand or Scale brand.

This recipe is delicious as written. The game hens provide a "meatier" quality (compared to, say, chicken breasts) that is complemented by the spiciness and richness of the sauce. The advance preparation is also a plus.

This is a wonderful dish, if you like the Asian ingredients. If you don't then don't comment and move on.

Sorry - I just had to respond (I reviewed the recipe favorably a couple of days ago..) If you don't like fish sauce (Nam Pla) then don't make the recipe. Come on...that's like saying, "I don't like tomatoes so can I make the marinara sauce with kumquats?" There are 1000's of recipes on this site. Use the "advanced search" and find a recipe more suited to your tastes. At some point people have to make the recipe AS WRITTEN and comment on that. Thanks for listening!

Great Recipe.Want thicker coconut milk? Buy coconut cream! Comes in a can and is usually found in Oriental food markets and it is terrific. Enjoy

Terrific recipe, great for company because of all the do-ahead-ability Happy to help vindicate this yummy recipe!

Haven't made this dish but the ingredients look good (having made other curry and Thai dishes.) I am going to make it with chicken breast, too much effort for the reward on cornish hens. To the prior reviewer, I know how awful a dish can be with too much fish sauce. I recommend half soy and half fish sauce, or just half the fish sauce. Soy only does not render the same flavor.

Okay people, with all of your idol chit chatting you've managed to downgrade a terrific recipe from 3.5 forks to 2. If you're not going to rate the recipe, don't type in comments.

Okay people, due to all of your whiny chit chat, I almost passed up on a delicious recipe. Out of the 9 reviews prior to mine, only there were only 4 ratings which should have averaged out to over 3.5 forks. Those of you who did not provide a rating only served to downgrade a fabulous dish to 2 forks. Knock it off!

I'd like to try this but avoid any recipes with fish sauce as it once rendered a meal inedible from my family's point of view. Can anyone recommend a substitute or should I just skip for this and other recipes?

Well, okay, I didn't make it. But I am still going to review it. My gourmet group hosts did though, and I ate it! They did the whole menu Gourmet recommended, and it was wonderful! No one thought they ate too much! I am sure the curry sauce would be wonderful with the shrimp too, but the Game Hen was terrific!

These were terrific. Adjust the curry paste for more or less heat - I used more and it gave the birds a nice "zing". The "sauce" takes on the same heat - and a little goes a looong way (be careful!).

Like the previous reviewer I did not make this recipe. I made a flank steak, it was delicious.

to the person objecting to a review by someone who didn't make the recipe - lighten up. The person did make the sauce and thought it was great on fish. I object to people objecting just for the sake of it.

To the "reviewer" from FLA: The review of the sauce is very relevant. Everyone can imagine what a plain grilled cornish hen tastes like. What I can't stand is all the sniping that we have to wade through to read the relevant stuff, and I hate to add to it, but felt that your comment to the previous reviewer was unjustified.

Absolutely devine - I've used this marinade on cut up chicken. Thai red curry is one of my favorite flavors. You can also add some chopped red bell pepper while you saute the shallots, and when the sauce is almost done, throw in some large raw shrimp and fresh basil leaves and poach the shrimp until done. Serve over hot jasmine rice. Thai heaven!

I'm not rating this recipe, because I didn't quite make it. I did take the previous reviewer's advice: I used this marinade on grilled mahi mahi, and it was absolutely delicious. I also sauteed some eggplant chunks, red onion and red bell pepper and used them to soak up the rest of the sauce. Garnished with Thai basil, served over jasmine rice -- divine! If you're using this marinade for fish you can get away with halving the recipe, and obviously it doesn't need to soak nearly as long. Can't wait to try this recipe as written.

This was so good. My husband devoured the sauce. The sauce would be a wonderful marinade for fish as well. He's already asked me to make it again!
