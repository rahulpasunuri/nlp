So easy to make! Ginger over powered the recipe- next time I will up the cardamom slightly. Also will follow previous posters advice and bake longer.

I've made these bars a few times, sometimes baking them for the time indicated in the recipe, in which case them turn out chewy, sometimes letting them bake longer, in which case they harden and are great with a hot drink. Either way, they're met with swooning. These bars go particularly well with an Indian meal.

These have a distinctive taste that people are going either to love or . . . not. I made these for a temple dessert buffet, and think they worked very well there, as a complement to the inevitable surfeit of chocolate desserts. This was not as easy to make as I thought it would be, because I doubled the recipe. That made it too voluminous to fit in the food processor, so I used hand beaters. What a mess! There is so little liquid in the recipe that I had flour dust and butter chunks flying all over the kitchen. I think that sticking to the original proportions, and using the closed food processor, would work fine.

I had these baked by a friend who'd kept the recipe from the magazine all these years! She followed the original recipe and it is now safely on my computer Delicious! And yes, it would be quite different with nutmeg!

Very nice. Spicy, buttery, and just a bit chewy. Addictive! I haven't fed these to anyone else yet, but I adore ginger and love these. I wasn't familiar with cardamom before, but it's great. I'd like to try substituting nutmeg for the cardamom next time as another reviewer did, because I love nutmeg too.

Wow - a lovely change of pace from all the chocolate desserts that everyone loves. I'm rather new to using cardamom and the first thing I made with it (the cardamom pistachio cake here) tasted very strange to me. The pistachio-cilantro pesto with chicken which used cardamom was great and so I was willing try using the spice in a dessert where the flavor would be noticeable. I loved these bars, even my 9-month old daughter did too (I know, she's too young for sweets). I'm already looking for occasions when I can serve them

Very good - I'm a huge fan of the candied ginger - I can eat it all by itself. This turned out well even with whole grain flour, 1/2 cup butter, less sugar, and plain yogurt for moistness (instead of butter and egg). They're extremely good and don't taste like they've been 'tampered' with!

Just a $$ tip for buying cardamom, I have found it very reasonably priced at local Indian grocery stores (much less than $12 a bottle!), or you might try an asian grocery store. I would imagine also that it's likely to be fresher at these stores as well.

While the flavor was very nice and unusual, the texture - sort of like marzipan - took some getting used to. Overall, a nice change of pace.

These bars were extremely good--BUT I substituted nutmeg for the very expensive cardamom --up to $12 for a small bottle. So, I chanced it and topped it with slivered almonds and everyone was drooling, especially me.

This recipe is really easy, good and unusual. It got good reviews from my husband who doesn't really like cardamom or candied ginger (some of my favorites). It was also well received by friends.

This recipe was fairly easy since you could do everything including chop the ginger in the food processor. I took it to a holiday party and it was all gone--everyone thought it was delicious. It is different from other sweets with the bite of ginger but my family thought it was tasty.
