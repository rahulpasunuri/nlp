Generally when a recipe receive 4 forks it awesome but i have to say this was not a great meal. I think it might be because buffalo is a less flavorul meat and gets overpowered by the gorgonzola and rosemary.(We even used nice steaks from whole foods!) We may try this recipe again but with a more flavorful beef steak!

The gorgonzola butter was perfect, but I will agree that it's an overwhelming amount of rosemary. Still fabulous and the best recipe I've seen for buffalo.

This recipe is just the best. Have made it for Christmas dinner for several years, and now it is the dinner that "means" Christmas in our house. I have had great results with beef and venison tenderloins too--All simply fantastic!

Very good--my first time using buffalo, and I was pleased with the result. I would go easy on the rosemary--it overwhelmed the other flavors and tasted just a touch too pine-needle-y when roasted. Otherwise, it was tender and delicious.

This recipe is very tasty! It fills your mouth with wonderfully rich flavors. Also, very easy to make. It took me less than 30 minutes from start to finish. I also substituted the buffalo with prime top sirloin which worked out great. The secret is in the searing. Make sure to sear on high heat to seal in the juices. Awesome!

So wonderful - flavorful and easy to make. We've made this with buffalo and elk and it turned out fabulous both times. If you make the gorgonzola butter ahead of time, the meal takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish. Perfect for weekdays (simple preparation) and perfect for entertaining (fabulous taste & presentation

Fantastic! This is one of the first things I ever made from Gourmet Magazine (back in 1995!) and it is excellent. I have made it for just about everyone I know since. I have always substituted Beef Tenderloin because it was cheaper and I was told I wouldn't notice a difference in the taste. I love Gorgonzola so I didn't find the taste of it too strong or offensive in this dish. I couldn't imagine it without it! It pairs so nicely with the rosemary. I served it with parsley leaf potatoes, broccoil w/ pickled red onions & whole grain mustard pan rolls (all from the same issue in '95). Mmmmm delish!!! Four forks for sure!!

Delicious, but these flavors are very very strong. I would even recommend omitting the gorgonzola butter. The small and taste of strong gorgonzola about knocks you over! Not for the faint of heart. To compliment these strong flavors, I served with Morel mushrooms, sauteed in olive oil with garlic, parsley, and ground coriander...perfect.
