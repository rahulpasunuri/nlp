Had a dinner party and bought a 7lb chuck roast. After searing it very well, deglazing the pan per instructions, I transferred it to a roasting pan. Roasted at 300 degrees for 5 hours, then turned the oven to 350, added vegetables and roasted another 1.5 hours. Perfect. Tender. Yummy. Vegetables were perfect, too ...not overcooked. I strained the liquid to make a gravy, which I thought the gravy was too sweet, by the way. All people commented very graciously how delicious it was. I would make it again, though I am not a fan of the tomatoes. I was afraid to not add the tomatoes, thinking that perhaps they had another function other than taste ...tenderizer??

Absolutely fabulous. I made the dish but halfway through realized I was without Worcestershire sauce. I was able to add about 1/4 cup white vinegar and it turned out perfectly. I also omitted the carrots in favor of more parsnips and turnips with great success. They lost quite a bit of volume, I would recommend a very large chop on those for future. Excellent, a total crowd pleaser.

I've never been a huge traditional pot roast fan. Always found the flavors dull. THIS IS FABULOUS. And, even the family members who are not bored by traditional pot roast couldn't stop eating it. So happy I found a recipe that transforms an ordinary cut of meat into the sensational.

Fantastic recipe. I made only 1 small change. When the roast was ready, I moved to a cutting board. I then removed the veggies with a slotted spoon. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil for about 5 mind, until reduced by 1/3 and slightly thickened. Season, as needed with salt and pepper. Then, instead of a cornstarch slurry, I thickened with a beurre manie- about 4 TBSP each unsalted butter and flour combined into a paste, whisked into the gravy until thickened. Return the veggies to the gravy and serve.

4 forks should only be awarded once in a blue moon. And when my family tasted this delightful dish we all agreed. The voting was by what was NOT left. We devoured it all and used bread to soak up the gravy. Yes folks, IT IS THAT GOOD!

This is my "go to" pot roast recipe, though I have to admit I don't add the turnips. Very complex flavors.

I love this recipe. I normally use an English cut roast, around 4 lbs, which comes with a slice through the rib bones for nice deep flavor and body. I don't mince the ginger root, but peel it and leave it whole, but making a lot of cuts in it. This makes it easy to fish out later. I have made it with the port, using all red wine, keeping the liquid from the can of tomatoes, you name it. It's hard to make this taste bad. Braised beef...yummmmmm. It's crucial to brown the meat first, though.

I have probably made more pot roasts than most cooks out there - I'm 80 years old, love to cook, and give regular dinner parties for 8-10 guests. This is absolutely the BEST pot roast I ever made!! Ignore the non-cooks who do not follow the recipe. This is the one to stick with from now on!! Thanks, Gordon, whoever you are!!

Made this for a holiday dinner and it was a tremendous hit. Made as written with the exception of leaving out the brown sugar (we tried it with the sugar in a test run, but it was just too sweet). Recipe was enormously adaptable. Made 3x the recipe (big crowd!), making some in the crock pot and some in the oven. The oven version was pretty much done within the allotted 3 hours or so (at 325F). The crockpot version needs an extra few hours, even on high, but it comes out done perfectly. This is a definite keeper. Simple to make, reheats beautifully. Drew raves as an entree for entertaining.

Any pot roast recipe that calls for a quarter cup of minced fresh ginger root must be tested! I didn't even have any, so a quick trip to the grocery was a must. This recipe elevates pot roast to "great for entertaining" status. It is outstanding. Even if you skip other ingredients or make substitutions, go get the ginger. It's worth it.

Rating: 4
Really good. I used more liquid - more broth and more red wine. I didn't have port so I just used the wine. I used more onion (1 really large) and of course more garlic. I let the onions cook for a really long time - probably 40 minutes. I didn't use turnips just because I was feeling lazy. This was a big hit with the family. will definitely make it again.

I've made this many times leaving out the root veggies. Tried it this time with the veggies and it turned out great. I don't always use port, most of the time, I use whatever Cabernet Sauvignon I have on hand. Prepared Polanta as the side carb. instead of mashed potatoes.

I adore this recipe, and along with the wine-baked halibut steaks from 2001, this is my other all-time favorite recipe from epicurious. It is time-consuming to make (which I further complicate by finishing on slow-cook in a crockpot), but so utterly worth it. Every time I've made it, the household salivates all day, pestering to know when it will be done. Great recipe to bake some fresh bread to go with. I frankly dream of this recipe often, wishing I could make it more frequently. The core recipe is so good that it is easy and fun to tinker with -- I've varied the recipe in innumerable ways and it is always a winner. Don't miss trying this recipe once -- because you'll want to try it twice.

Very delicious I have made this recipe twice! The only thing I change is I don't cook the vegetables with the roast. I roast them in the oven then toss with the gravy and serve with the roast. This is now my go to pot roast recipe!

I've made this recipe many times and it has never failed to diappear, no matter how much of it I make. I use a beef demi-glace instead of stock. I use a ruby port instead of the tawney; I don't use the parsnips and turnips. Serve over garlic-horseradish mashed potatoes!

I'm giving it two forks because Mom loved it and Dad did not (parents are 80 and 78 respectively). I liked it and would eat it again, but it was a lot of trouble to make. Only changes I made were by necessity; I didn't have any Port, and the Market did not have parsnips, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. If I do make it again, I will be sure to have all ingredients, and I'll use beef broth instead of chicken broth. I used portabella mushrooms, they were delish! So were the other veggies--not mushy at all.

This is an unusual list of ingredients which is what drew me to it in the first place. We like complex flavors in our house and this recipe didn't disapoint. My boyfriend's mom's pot roast is pretty good but this blew his socks off. Here are my cooking notes: Searing the meat on all sides is crucial. Takes about 30 minutes to do it right. I used a 1.5 lb lean chuck roast. I doubled the garlic and added one large potato and cut all veggies large. They were still intact after 3 hours of cooking. I didn't have port so I used high quality cooking sherry. I can't wait to try port the next time. At 3 hours the meat broke apart and the sauce was delightfully thick so it never needed the cornstarch. This turned into stew and was awesome.

Recipe Had a lot of ingredients which may be daunting to some but each one adds to the complexity of the roast. Some work goes into combining everything and getting the meal on it's way into the oven, but the results are well worth it.

I was looking for flavoring agents to enhance my Christmas pot roast and came across Gordon's recipe and the ensuing reviews. I was (be)amused by the comments from the gentleman from Portage, WI. A cram course of gastronomy 98 might help this chap. Safe money stays away from that bet however...

i've made this many times and it's always been wonderful... other root veggies work just fine if you're not a fan of parsnips or turnips.... i'm more writing this because i'm confused by the chef's review from portage, wi.... he claims the recipe is awful, and yet the chef volunteers that he didn't follow the recipe-- different port, no brown sugar, powdered ginger, and also skipped over that step where you MIX the cornstarch with water before adding it..... soapbox time.... i guess in general i would caution folks from reviewing if you've decided to sub a bunch of ingredients..... gets kinda tiresome-- "i made the hot dogs, but instead of the meat i used string cheese and instead of the bun i used an old shoe i found in my closet.... it was awful....."

really yummy. My husband, who is not a big fan of meat, loved it. I used buffalo rump roast. I, too, poured the sauce into another pan and reduced it for a thicker sauce. I didn't have any port so I used sherry and it was still great. the next time I will use port. Very very good.

Really great pot roast. I used Bufalo rump roast. I thought it was a little dry, but with the yummy sauce it was great! I didn't have any port on hand so I used sherry...worked well but I'll use port next time. My husband, a very honest eater, loved it. Put potatoes in instead of parsnips and turnips in the last 1 1/2 hrs of cooking and worked perfectly. Really good

I have made this recipe countless times and love it. We don't particularly care for the turnips and parsnips, so I use only potatoes and carrots. The fresh ginger is CRITICAL. We leave out the cornstarch and instead I ladle about 1/2 the liquid into a separate saucepan and reduce it for about 20 minutes or so. The best gravy ever. We have family coming in from NYC and they've specially requested it!

Rating: 4
This was excellent. The large amount of ginger really makes it interesting. Great gravy. The only change I made was to use a pound of turnips and no parsnips because I live in the south and fresh turnips are what we have plenty of in the winter. Also used a 28-oz can of diced tomatoes and did not drain. Why throw away all that good juice?

Rating: 1
Was quite disappointed with this recipe after the great reviews. For some reason, the turnips seemed to concentrate all the vinegar taste from the acid of the wine and were incredibly nasty. I used a red Port; don't know if that was too acidic. The corn starch formed one big glob and disguised itself as a vegetable and was a hideous discovery. I used powdered ginger rather than whole since I forgot to buy it. The smell was NOT wonderful as I was hoping, but rather off-putting - very sweet-sour, which I don't like. I knew when I put the Worcestershire sauce in that it was the wrong thing, and it gave it a sweet taste. I left out the brown sugar as recommended by some. The meat itself was okay. The parsnips good. Oh, and none of the vegetables fell apart as in reviews. I also used two pint jars of home canned tomatoes. For me, other pot roast recipes are far superior.

Rating: 4
This was major delicious. I followed the advice of others and pureed the overcooked veggies with an immersion blender. It does make quite a bit of sauce. I shredded the left over roast and mixed it in w/the leftover sauce to freeze for what may be a great soup!

Wow. I've always hated pot roast but I really like this one -- very nice complex flavors. I don't use the turnips (can't imagine that they wouldn't be overwhelming [and I can't stand them...]) and use potatoes instead. I also add the veggies later than the recipe calls for. Haven't gone as far as to use cornstarch and make a thicker sauce but it would probably be very good.

Rating: 4
Over the past few years, this has become my only pot roast recipe. My family devours it, and on the rare occasion that there are leftovers, the meat makes yummy sandwiches and shepherd's pie. I find it very forgiving -- don't have parsnips/turnips, use potatoes. I've substituted sherry for port without a problem. Just love the combination of flavors -- ginger, Worcestershire, brown sugar and herbs. Like it better with beef broth than with chicken broth. It smells divine while cooking and the meat and sauce are very flavorful. The veggies are essentially mush by the time it's finished, and the proportion of veggies to meat is too small -- but they're very good if you use an immersion blender or food processor and puree some of them into the sauce. I recommend roasting additional root vegetables separately with olive oil and fresh herbs while the roast is in the pot (more delicious smells!).

Rating: 4
just excellent. I roasted the veggies seperately. I used the trimmings from the veggies as a mirepoix after I browned the meat. After everything was done I took out the meat, spooned off some fat, pureed the sauce with my wand and strained. It was like liquid velvet. I added the roasted veggies into the sauce to rewarm/coat.

While I thought this was very tasty and I will make it again, it didn't blow me away like I thought it would. Given the interesting ingredients (ginger, port wine, brown sugar) I was expecting a more complex taste. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added the vegetables during the last 1.5 hrs of cooking. I ended up with way too much liquid so next time I will add less wine and stock.

I made this recipe for New Years Day supper and it was a huge hit. I followed the advice of other reviewers and roasted my vegetables in the oven and added them for the last hour of cooking. I didn't have any port, so I used 1.5 cups of chianti and it came out wonderfully. My butcher suggested an 'english cut' roast, which includes some cut rib bones (I believe). The bones made the gravy extra rich so it did not need any additional thickening. Great dish!

I added the vegetables for the last hour of cooking time - they were perfectly tender and not at all mushy. The "gravy" was so flavorful and complex. I got rave reviews from my guests and two thumbs up from my husband - not your average pot roast kind of guy. I served it with challah rolls - not the usual crusty bread and it worked out well - the softness of the bread really soaked up the sauce. Next time however, I'll use a crusty baguette. I will definitely be making this again - the house smelled so good all afternoon while it was cooking, and being a one pot dish, the clean up was quick.

Excellent pot roast! Certainly not your mother's recipe. Used a rump roast for this dish and kept everything basically the same except I did not use the ginger root. I did add a pinch of ginger powder. I also cut the vegetables in bigger chunks so that there was no issue with them dissolving in the broth. Cooking time was 4 hours plus. Leftovers were even better the next day!

I have never made a pot roast nor do I cook very often (my husband is the chef!!) but this was recipe was easy, and so good. I made some alterations as well. I made my brown stock from some classic reduced brown stock. I roasted my parsnips, potatoes and carrots first in olive oil, seasoned w/ salt and pepper for about 40 minutes. I waited to put them in the roast until the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking time. I didn't have gingeroot, or some of the spices, so I used herbs de province, a pinch of garlic salt, pinch of ground clove and generous salt and pepper. I used tawny port and red wine as recommended and simmered for a while longer than suggested. I didn't need to add the cornstarch as my sauce was perfect. The roast fell apart due to it's tenderness, the veggies were so delicious and the flavor of the sauce was fabulous. My husband,who is all gourmet,raved about it for days and days. He is begging me to make it again and has requested it for the family christmas meal.

I've been making this dish for years, and everyone LOVES it. A few changes: replaced the parsnips and turnips with Yukon gold potatoes, used (2) 14 oz cans diced tomatoes instead of whole, elimnated the port and sugar, and upped the wine to 1 cup. Use bottom round rump roast--truly oustanding! Add veggies for the last hour, prevents overcooking. Remove the roast and veggies from pot, cook the sauce down 'till thickened. You'll love it, and the house smells wonderful!

I'm with Cape May (see below). You can doctor this up and make it palatable, but IMO the recipe is awful. The oregano & tomatoes are overpowering- it's more tomato sauce than pot roast. Simmering time is much too short- I had to simmer the entire day. I followed the recipe exactly, but after 3 hours & an undercooked roast, remade the sauce (w/o tomatoes & oregano, uppping the garlic and wine) & added to the original concoction. It was better but not worth suffering through again. A great disappointment.

Rating: 4
It was fabulous. I made it as shown, except I baked in a big clay pot at 275 for 5 hours instead of stovetop. I left out the mushrooms because my kid has a thing about mushrooms, and I was a bit short of Port, and I used 3 parsnips because parsnips are soooo sweet in a stew but aside from that I did it exactly as shown. Oh, and I added a few halved small potatoes. I served it with mashed Yukon Gold and a nice loaf of old fashioned white crusty bread

I followed the instructions to the "T." The meat was outstanding but the vegetables (and I did use the parsnips, turnips, carrots, mushrooms) tasted odd. Metallic or something like that. I'm not sure if it was the ginger or the tomatoes or what. Perhaps it was the combination of it all. As the others wrote, though, the house did smell intoxicating while it cooked. I'm not a big meat fan so I was hoping the veggies would have been as outstanding as the meat. Oh well. Live and learn.

My teenage son made this while I was at work. He did forget to put in the garlic, but it was still tasty. I will use the garlic next time. Getting home with late buses and missed transfers, with snow blowing in my face, it was a treat to come in the door and smell this. It tastes wonderful, and was perfect for a cold winter day. It was even better with the leftover veggies heated up the next day for lunch.

Loved reading reviews on this recipe,that's what made me try it--is all that has been said! I've made it twice, followed recipe to the "t" first time, 2nd time cooked at someone elses' house and didn't include bay leaf or the Port. Following to the "t" is better.Enjoy this recipe, once you start it on the stove, you're done, it will fill the house with great fragrance, so enjoy the assembly steps--long list, but it's not hard and you will be rewarded. Admittedly, that was the closest I have ever come to a turnip (and, it's a good thing that parsnips were labeled on the bag!), it is all wonderful. Served garlic mashed Yukon potatoes on the side, couldn't have fit another thing in the dutch oven (amazed that a reviewer used sweet potatoes, must have used an enormous pot). Very pleasant winter dish, shows very well on a super big colorful platter.

I've made this dish several times, and I'm sure it's the best pot roast recipe I've ever used. No matter how big a chuck roast I use, it always disappears fast. I've omitted the parsnips and turnips, and added peeled, large-dice Yukon Gold potatoes for the last 1.5 hour of cooking, which doesn't seem to detract. I've tried it with and without port -- the flavor is much better if you use it. The ginger is the "secret ingredient" that makes the flavor special, so don't omit it. I like the ginger flavor to be a bit more subtle, so I cut the quantity of ginger to 1/2 or 1/3 of what's called for in the recipe. That might help the the reviewer who didn't like the odd aftertaste.

Great recipe! My first pot roast ever! I used potatoes & sweet potatoes & celery, instead of parsnips, turnips! Like other reveiws, i added the veggies during the last 1.5 hrs. The sweet potatoes were amazing!!! I used 1.5 cups Merlot, no Port. To save time bought "diced" tomatoes and added the juice too! I used my Le Crueset 6qt pot, and roasted in oven at 350 degrees for 3 hrs! Will make again soon!!!

From Chicago on a brutally cold day...this was GREAT. The whole family loved it. I used oven roasted tomatoes that I had saved in the freezer,also added marjoram. Also substituted some roasted garlic, about two large cloves. I didn't add the vegetables until the roast had already simmered for two hours. In the meantime I oven roasted the parsnips and carrots to increase the depth of flavor. After the two hours I added some celery and tiny baby white potatoes. When they were tender I added the carrots and parsnips, and cremini mushrooms that I had sauteed in a skillet. Right before service I added a little chopped parsley and chopped celery leaves. More work but I think these extra steps paid off. (I didn't use any cornstarch since I had tossed in the roast with a little flour as well as salt and pepper prior to browning.)

While I'm not a huge pot roast fan myself, my husband loved it! And he's really the judge on this one. Have to admit that even for me it was flavorful. We did a more basic version, omitting parsnips, turnips, ginger, tomatoes, and port. Did use a good Merlot per recipe. Used "better than bouillon" beef broth. A pleasant meal--all the spices add a nice flavor. Next time would probably add a bit more salt and pepper--I did use on roast before before cooking but maybe not enough. Could also be that the broth wasn't as salty as canned.

I'm not a gourmet or even a solid home cook. I made this and couldn't stop wanting it until it was gone. If you make it once = i promise 2 weeks won't go by before you're tempted to make it again I didn't have the herbs on hand but threw in my own mix. worked great.

What a fabulous pot roast recipe. I love the slight variation from traditional pot roast (ginger, brown sugar, port), as the flavors meld beautifully and mellow with the hours of cooking. I used slightly different veggies for personal taste preference reasons (baby red potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots and crimini mushrooms), and I didn't add them until the last hour of simmering because I was afraid they would get too soft and mushy. It was divine, and a much more elegant, rich and tasty pot roast than the more traditional recipes. This was perfect for a cold, rainy October night in Connecticut, and I can't wait to serve it for dinner parties all fall and winter. Enjoy!

Wow, wow, wow! This is an excellent recipe for pot roast (my husband's favorite meal). I bought a boneless beef chuck roast from an organic farmer and it was beautifully marbled. I did not use mushrooms because my husband hates them (what, is he crazy?!?) and imagine if using them, the depth of flavor would just intensify that much more, but oh well. Instead of using water to make the cornstarch slurry, I used the juice from the canned tomatoes. I served with roasted garlic/horseradish mashed potatoes (starch heaven) and homemade baguettes.

I made this last night...and it rocked the party! I didn't have every ingredient called for in the house at the time, so I made a few minor tweaks...I didn't have parsnips, turnips, mushrooms, canned tomatoes or ginger on hand, so I used 5 carrots, 1 stalk of celery, and 1T. of tomato paste. I also didn't have any port, so I used an English double-chocolate stout instead, increased the brown sugar to 1/4C. and used 1T. each of fresh herbs instead of 1t. dried...I cooked it at 350 in the oven in a large Le Creuset dutch oven...and it was BY FAR the best pot roast I ever made...and SO DAMN EASY!!

I made this recpe last night for my husband. I was very suspicious of the ingredients (1/4 cup of freshly minced ginger sounded like way too much!). But we LOVED this roast. Follow the recipe, don't worry about the amount of ginger or that it seems odd to use brown sugar. Just make it and your house will smell soooo glorious. Your reward is the absolute tenderest roast I have ever made. A few suggestions: skim fat from the broth every hour or so. As others have said earlier, add the vegetables during the last hour of cooking. I seved it over couscous, whcih soaked up all of the yummy broth. We can't wait have the leftovers tonight!

This was delicious & got rave reviews from my dinner guests.

The meat was fall apart tender and delicious. The ginger and port yield great flavor. You should definitely get more than 3 lbs of meat, however!

Well...uh, my mother used to tell me, "If you can't say anything nice, then don't say anything at all." That about sums it up. I would, however, make this again if I were in a turnip, carrot, parsnip, ginger, and bay leaf cookoff. What are the odds of THAT happening?

Not into putting tomatoes in pot roast, but really loved this. It gets one of my very rare 4 fork reviews. I used a sirloin tip roast which is not usually a recommended pot roast. It came out so tender in the wine sauce and kept the fat content in the sauce to a minimum. I did almost double the vegetables and served with egg noodles.

Tried it, loved it. It came out great. Interesting combination of flavors, the port really helps it along.

This was like a kicked up version of a dish my family used to make. I haven't had pot roast in ages. The only change I made was to use all wine instead of half wine half tawny port. The next time I will make a larger roast. There were 4 of us and it was gone in the blink of an eye. This was a perfect homey dish for a 3 degree February day.

Followed the recipe to a T, but wasn't afraid of deviating from the main ingredients. Added in combination with the broth, some soy sauce. Soy sauce is the future. Threw in some rosemary and fresh sage for complexity and let simmer. I let it sit in some Marsala wine and it turned out excellent. Worth repeating. (just a footnote, those who want to bicker about methods in a childish way, take it to a chatroom) Ciao

I've never been a big fan of pot roast - I decided to make this for my husband. I substituted potatoes for the parships & turnips, and used dried gingerroot since I had no fresh on hand. The gravy from this is just divine although I might cut back on the brown sugar and increase the mushooms the next time. I'll never be a huge pot roast fan, but I will make this again. Great flavors!

To Angel- Good Lord, maybe you need to slow down on the red meat there, sister. You're a little cranky & backed up, it seems like. No one attacked YOU personally, why the need to attack someone making an innocent comment about pot roast? Please seek immediate anger management therapy or just drink the bottle of port you bought for this dish

I have made this recipe probably six times, including for company. It is excellent, garnishes rave reviews and guests often ask for and leave with a copy of the recipe. I make it exactly but for ease I have marked off the bowl numbers on my printout, e.g. bowl 3 has carrots, parsnips, turnips and mushrooms etc. I don't have to dirty as many bowls during mise en place.

This is to the loser @ Suffolk, VA- If you could not make pot roast, which even a monkey can do! This is a variation of flavors, of which blend perfectly If your boyfriend didn't like the pot roast then He's not dealing with the real issue which is YOU honey deal with it! NO ONE can REALLY mess up pot roast even if you did not add anything but salt and pepper! Don't blame Gorden for YOUR ineptness!

A good springboard recipe to add your own flair. Don't sweat any one missing ingredient like ginger or port. I used crushed tomatoes for a less chunky sauce and have subbed sweet sherry or ruby port for the tawny port with good results. Really nice in "bread bowls" or over egg noodles or polenta.

POT ROASR EVERY OTHER SUNDAY FOR 18 YEARS. dAD SAID "SON, THIS IS SIMPLE AND TASTES GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE GRAVY!" (SAUCE WAS NOT A COMMON WORD IN MONTANA IN 1967) 1/2 PEELED SPUDS REQUIRE (THE BROWN) ONIONS NO SMALLER THAN QUARTERED, CELERY AN CARROTS BIG CHUNKS, SPICES SALT AND PPER THICKEN GRAVEY WITH BUTTER AND FLOUR MIX. HATE TO BE A RED NECK BUT THE FLAVOR FROM AN AGED 7-BONE (CHUCK) ROAST NEEDS NOTHING OTHER THAN A LITTLE TAWNEY PORT OR SHERRY. OTHERWISE GOOD RECIPE

This recipe was okay. The ginger taste was very mild, but the ginger aroma is what made this dish not so appealing to me. I threw in uncooked egg noodles in the last half hour, they soaked up the excess liquid and were quite good.

I don't know about this one....I have always had great success with the recipes on this site, but I wasn't wild about this roast. After reading the reviews, I figured it would be awesome, but the flavors seemed a bit off. The meat was tender, and my husband liked it, although he said he could live without it, too. Go figure!

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe. Don't be turned off by either the ginger or the port wine. I used a sweet sherry 'cause I didn't have the port in the house; result: delicious. One thing though, and it's common sense, DO use S&P when you put the veggies in (I agree with other cooks, add veggies during last 45-60 mins of cooking time). Taste the sauce after straining out meat and veggies; correct for S&P again. The woman whose relationships were damaged by a potroast--that was a joke right? Takes all kinds, I guess.

Delicious...I made this for my boyfriend's freezer...I tripled the mushrooms add small red potatoes instead of the parsnips and added the veggies for the last 45 minutes. Once done I removed the meat and veggies and used my immersion blender to smooth out the sauce, then reduced and thickened. There is a lot of sauce in this recipe, so when I packaged it up to freeze I put it over wide egg noodles. As it turns out, last night was the big "Blackout of 2003" and the boyfriend and his housemate were stuck in the dark, with no hope of takeout or delivery!! Fortunately they have a gas stove and popped a pan of the pot roast and noodles into the oven...they loved it!!! As a personal chef, I'll be making this in the future for my clients!

I've been married for 22 years and I've never been able to make a pot roast worth eating until I discovered this recipe. Wow! I love the wonderful flavor and don't even bother trying other recipes now. I'm glad I never gave up my search for the perfect pot roast.

Rating: 3
We love this dish. I usually increase the vegtables, especially the mushrooms. I add the turnips, shrooms, carrots and parsnips during the last hour of cooking time, so they don't get mushy. Beware the wine you use- if it isn't great for drinking, it won't be good for cooking!

Boy, this is one delicious recipe! Gave it 3 forks only because meat was a little dry, could have been the cut. The sauce was AWESOME!! Followed the advice of other reviewers: doubled the ginger and garlic, just a pinch of sugar. No port on hand, used 1 c. Shiraz. Added potatoes in lieu of parsnips and turnips, but only for last hr w/ carrots and mushrooms. Sauce was a little thin, so removed the veggies and cooked it down for about 20 mins. Lots of leftover sauce but the meat was gone in an instant -- 3 kids, ages 5-12 scarfed it! Will definitely make again.

We loved it. Of course, we do like our meat dishes fairly sweet (my Asian influences). The only difference I might make next time is to either add red potatoes or substitute some of the other vegetables for red potatoes.

I made this post roast this past Sunday, and let it sit overnight...had it on Monday night. It really is the best Pot Roast I have made. Like others, I altered the recipe a bit. ie. didn't add the brown sugar, more garlic, chunkier cut of onion. Had lots of liquid left over that went into a soup I was making. Wonderful comfort food for a cold evening.

This was the best pot roast I have ever made. Deeply satisfying on a cold winter night in Maine. I've been trying different recipes as a beef stew substitute to avoid the tedium of browning individual cubes. This is the same cut of meat, and the meat was very flavorful & tender and the sauce was delicious. I used 2 onions (diced only roughly rather than minced was fine) and more garlic, and took the earlier suggestions and used just a splash of port and 1 c. zinfandel, and chicken stock & a pinch of brown sugar, put some carrots in at the beginning and the rest later 1/2 way through cooking w/ turnips & mushrooms. I cooked it in the oven for 3-1/2 hours after bringing to a simmer at 325 deg. I ended up with too much liquid. Other than that, an excellent dish!

This is a wonderful recipe for pot roast-- the best I've made! I took the recommendation of 2 reviewers who suggested adding more ginger. I didn't have any port so I just doubled the wine amt. I used peeled red potatoes instead of parsnips and they didn't get mushy.I also used 2 T of flour with water to thicken the sauce slightly. I would leave out the brown sugar next time. It doesn't need it.This is a very tasty recipe which can be put in the crock pot and forgotten. Thank you all for your comments and suggestions.

This is the first pot roast I have served to my partner where the meat texture resembled his grandmother's cooking! Consistent with the other reviewers, add vegetables during the last 45 minutes of cooking. Ginger ....a crucial ingredient, next time I will use more than the required 3 inches The vast amount of liquid seemed contrary to other pot roast recipes, but the end product and the delicious sauce was a success and well worth repeating and passing on to my family and friends.

Gordon should keep his roast in his own pot and get his mind out of the gutter because thats where it was when he made this recipe. Seriously nobody wants dessert for dinner. Too sweet and soggy. I invited guests over for dinner to enjoy this(embarrassing) and since then the few that actually do call me call to leave obscenities and threatening messages on my machine. My boyfriend broke up with me because he was so humiliated and when I offered it to my dog he turned around and sat on it. since then Ive had bad luck. I even gave some to my two year old who spit it out and declared " Bad Mommy"! This pot roast is not worth losing friends, relationships and families seriously people DO NOT MAKE IT Take me as an example and learn from my mistakes Go to your mother and get her trusty recipe and serve your dessert on the side. Ive since then repaired my relationship with my daughter and my boyfriend and I got back together. My friends however no longer trust me but I'll be okay. Its day by day.

I thought the recipe was fabulous as is. My guests, however, thought I could have cooked the meat longer to add to tenderness (I cooked it for 4 hours!). Could have been my cut of meat, though (used top sirloin roast). All the flavors were superb. I had never cooked with parsnips or turnips. The vegetables really add to the overall flavor of the dish. A side of mashed potatoes or baked "those potatoes" with fresh rosemary, thyme, and garlic complete this great dish. Also, the gravy is a must on top of the beef.

Best roast-will not make a roast any other way in the future. Was skeptical about the ginger/brown sugar, but it turned out delicious. Here's what I did: no port, mushrooms, parsnips or turnips. Used peeled, quartered Yukon Gold potatoes and baby carrots in bottom of crockpot. Browned 2 1/2 pound chuck roast in oil and made sauce according to recipe except used 1 1/2 cups cheap red cooking wine, then added sauce to crockpot, topped with meat. Cooked from 9am to 7pm on low in crockpot, then removed meat and vegetables, covered with foil, to 200 degree oven to stay warm. Removed bay leaves, and pureed what remained (mainly tomato & ginger pieces) in crock with a hand blender until very smooth. Poured this somewhat thin (at this point) sauce into saucepan on stove and reduced by 1/2 over medium heat. Seasoned with salt & pepper. No cornstarch/ water mixture was necessary. Resulted in very flavorful, wonderful consistency, absolutely smooth sauce for meat and vegetables. Meat was so tender and vegetables were cooked perfectly.

This pot roast was very tasty. However, the vegetables were over cooked in the 3 hours of braising. I would probably recommend adding the vegetables later in the cooking time. Overall, this pot roast was very good.

Rating: 2
OK I thought this tasted good-- but it was pretty sweet- I would probably eliminate the brown sugar and cut the port in half and add more cabernet. Another problem was that the veggies were unidentifiable. I would probably add them half way through the cooking. Also- the last stage- sauce thickening...is not necessary. Overall it was pretty tasty.

I have made this recipe many times and it always gets raves! It is the best pot roast recipe I have ever tried. I skip the port and red wine. I use beef consume instead of broth. The sauce does not have to be thickened because I use less liquid.

I was rather hesitant about using red wine and port for something as humble as pot roast (I usually use port for things like duck). Yes, Gordon's pot roast turned out tasty and tender, but I've tried other recipes using less expensive ingredients that still resulted in a great pot roast.

Needed a pot roast recipe using a Cuck roast. Found this one and looked good. I used Turnips, Carrots and celery. The darn store was out of parsnips (I love those). Used a 10 yr old port and a very good bottle of Cabernet (drinking some right now) and followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. Man o man was that a GREAT roast. Served with mashed potatoes and a nice salad with Blue cheese. Would definitely do this one again. Next time I am going to find parsnips as that is an awesome veg. Scott

This is truly a wonderful pot roast! I substituted a cross-rib pot roast (with a bone) and the meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork!

I made this dish this evening and received confirmation on what other reviewers had said: this is a very good pot roast. The only alteration that I made was browning six slices of chopped bacon first, and then browning the chuck roast in the bacon drippings and adding the bacon bits along with the roast to simmer. I had never cooked with turnips or parsnips before but was delighted with their flavor as an alternative root vegetable. This is a time-consuming recipe, but once the prep work is done, it just takes time to cook. I served this with garlic, chive mashers and fresh green beans. --An altogether great main course.

I was very excited to try this recipe based on the overwhelming good reviews and I'm happy to say it exceeded expectations. I made this with a 2.5 lb piece of chuck roast - it was perfectly cooked in about 2.5 hours - I did an hour on the stove top, and the rest in the oven at 350 degrees. I only added carrots as a vegetable, big chunks. The dish went down a huge hit with the family - the gravy/sauce was absolutely fantastic. I strained it before adding the cornstarch which makes for a better presentation. We'll be keeping and using this recipe for years to come - amazing!!

Without a doubt THE BEST pot roast recipe ever! I have made it four times and had great success. Even my mom asked for the recipe :) The vegetables can all be interchanged for whatever you have in your fridge, but the ginger and wine are what makes this dish. Don't skimp on them! I actually went and bought a nice bottle of port just to use for this pot roast. If you are on the fence about whether to make this or not- try it!!!

Great job Gordon! We don't know who you are, but you created a great pot roast recipe! This was a big hit with the whole table. Wasn't sure the pot roast would be enough for our group, so I added a couple of short ribs to the pot. They came out great too. The only thing I would change next time would be to add only 1 TBSP of corn starch, as we all thought the sauce came out a little too thick. Sooo tasty though.

Truly wonderful. Added the vegetables--parsnips and carrots--only during the last hour. They absorbed the terrific blend of flavors of the sauce and were crisp-tender.

I read this recipe, the BASIC POT ROAST, and the POT AU FEU and decided to combine parts of them. CHANGES: 1 T chopped ginger 1 T chopped garlic 1/2 lb red potatoes, rinsed and quartered (not parsnips) 1 lb turnips 1 10oz can tomato puree 2 small cans beef broth paprika cinamon I rubbed the meat with garlic salt, pepper, cinamon, thyme, oregano and paprika and let stand before browning. After browning, I removed the meat and sauted the onions until golden brown. I added all the broth, wine, tomato paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and combined until hot. I added the beef to the sauce. I added a little more water and then simmered for 3 hours. I then removed the meat, and cooked the vegies. I removed the vegies and set aside. I then reduced the sauce to a little less than half and thickened with cornstartch. This meal was much more than a Pot Roast.

I did change a few things - first of all, put it all in a crock pot and cooked on high 3 hours, used baby carrots and portabello mushrooms, used 1/3 c. chopped ginger, used all beef stock, but I think I will cut down on the tomatoes a bit and use a little more wine. Didn't have port last time, but will try a burgundy/marsala combo for kicks next time, and try patting the roast w/ flour before browning! Definitely try this - WONDERFUL AND EASY!!!

I normally do not give 4 forks on this website for anything - but this certainly deserves 4 forks!! Absolutely delicious. I used 2001 Beringer Nouveau in place of the dry red wine. I didn't change ANYTHING else in the recipe.... you really need to make this with the parsnips, turnips & definitely add the ginger.. wouldn't taste the same without it. I did add a little demi-glaze to the sauce (after I removed the beef).. that's the only thing I did do that the recipe didn't call for!! The best pot roast I've ever tasted!! My husband loved it. We are having our leftover's tonight!! I served with buttermilk mashed potatoes! What a great recipe!!!!

This was great! Everyone in the family loved it! I substitued a bordeaux wine, carrots, potatoes and celery along with the mushrooms.

It was worth the wait, so start early!

Great recipe for a hardy meal. I usually don't like pot roasts, but this recipe gave me a new view on how to cook this piece of beef. I read the reviews of the many cooks who varied their opinions from very high to very low on Gordon's Roast. I believe not using the vegetables that are called for in this recipe, would be a mistake in preparing this meal. The only variance I took was to remove the meat and the "vegetables" at the end of the recipe. This left just the cooking broth in the pot, which I reduced by about half over very high heat,leaving an intensly hardy cooking stock to pour over the vegetables and sliced roast. The rich stock added a wonderful flavor to the meat and vegetables, which were not cooked away in the final step of preparation. This was really a delicious meal. I not only recommend it, but will make it again and again. Make sure you have a crusty bread to absorb the tasty stock left on your plate.

I hesitated to make this dish, because I didn't want pot roast in a tomato sauce. The overwhelmingly positive reviews convinced me to give it a try. The sauce is rich and dark and not at all dominated by tomatoes. My family liked this much more then traditional pot roast. It would make a great dish for company, as it smells and looks good and as if it was much harder to make! Great with noodles or mashed potatoes.

I didn't have parsnips and turnips in season, so substituted carrots and potatoes. I followed the advice of one rater and slow cooked it in the crock pot, but found mine had to cook longer. More like one hour on high and 8-9 on low. I too added more salt and pepper and corn starch as a thickener. We had a late, but delicious meal.

I cooked mine in a crock pot on high for an hour and then on low for 6-7 hours. It was wonderful.

Everyone raved. I also used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the whole. It made the sauce nice and thick.

I'm not a potroast fan, but my daughter and husband loved this recipe. I found it pretty good, but not over the "top". Cooked for 3 hours and meat was very tender. Cannot taste ginger in the sauce, which I was concerned with. Good flavor will make it again for family.

Made this last night without the parsnips and turnips, added potatoes instead. It was wonderful. My house smelled sinfully delicious! My husband loved it, but the kids didn't. If it's not pizza or mac and cheese they don't like it. Will make this again.

I have always disliked pot roast (bland & boring) but this recipe sounded unique so I gave it a try. I did not add the port, and I substituted baby potatoes for the mushrooms, parsnips and turnips. I also added some tobasco and red chili pepper. Terrific!!! My boyfriend, who normally despises pot roast, has requested this again and again. It has become a regular meal at my house.

Mavervelous!!! Substitute four large veal shanks (osso bucco) for beef. Makes the best I've ever served.Even better after freezing and re-heating.

This is fabulous - - the only pot roast recipe you'll ever need! I've served it to friends and family alike and it always earns rave reviews.

My husband enjoys this pot roast. It has a lot of flavor. I don't always have the port, and have substituted marsala or other heavy red wine. It always seems to taste great.

This recipe was a lot of work and not worth the effort compared to a regular pot roast recipe. Maybe it was the cut of meat I used, but it was not very tender and overall the dish lacked taste.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Definitely add the vegetables in the last hour of cooking and serve it with mashed potatoes, to enjoy the gravy. My husband said he didn't like pot roast, but loved this. It's easy and tasty enough to serve guests.

Very good. This was the first pot roast I have made and it was a winner. I added a dollop of HP Sauce (A1 would work as well) that gave a bit more depth to the sauce.

Superb, however I add chopped celery and a package of onion soup

Best pot roast I've ever had - my guests felt the same. I did take the advice of prior reviews and added the veggies, including potatoes, during the last 50 minutes.

I don't even like pot roast, but this was terrific and I have made it several times for guests. It is great. Really delicious comfort food.

For all my Italian friends, this was a refreshing change from our regular Sunday dinner which usually consists of some sort of pasta and chicken. My 87 year old dad even enjoyed this all american dinner. It was tasty and very tender.

This recipe was good but even better the next day. I substituted potatoes for the turnips because I don't care for them. Also didn't add the veggies until the last 40 mins. of cooking. One thing that I would change next time is to process the tomatoes in the food processor to improve the consistency of the sauce. I seasoned, then lightly floured the roast before browning. That eliminated the need to add the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. I served a side of crunchy garlic bread to complete the meal.

I had no port or red wine on hand, so I used Madeira and champagne. It was delicious! I did not notice the sweetness others have written about, but rather a nice complexity of flavours. Definately a dish which will be made often!

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding recipe. Though there is no potato in the recipe, there is an abundance of flavor provided by the other incredients that also provide plenty of substance, as well. I recommend finding the best possible cut of Prime Chuck Roast available for this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was very good, easy to follow and forgiving if you lack some ingredients. The resulting sauce is the star of the dish. The taste was so clean and lifting you might find yourself drinking the stuff. Mash Potatoes work best as the side.

I served this to my family last night and my husband and 3 sons ages 17-23 all agreed it was the best pot roast they'd ever had. And so did I! I cooked the veggies 1/2 the time and added potatoes. Next time I wouldn't put them in till the last 45-50 minutes, they were too soft. Otherwise, a FANTASTIC recipe. And since you can get jars of grated ginger it's easy too.

Rating: 2
The flavor was rich and delicious but the vegetables need a little help for a 3-fork rating. Next time I'll add large chunks of parsnip, carrot and turnip to enhance the broth during the first stage of cooking, but will remove and add smaller pieces during the last 30-45 minutes. Three hours on the stove turned everything but the beef to mush. Added extra garlic and ginger!

Rating: 3
I gave it 3 forks because it was very good, but I think I will keep searching for the perfect pot roast recipe. It was very tasty, but I missed potatoes. I served this with mashed potatoes, but I think I prefer potatoes IN the stew. The flavoring was good, but maybe I'm not a ginger fanatic.

Fantastic...best pot roast I ever made! Omitted parsnips so that I could serve pureed parsnips and potatoes to accompany the delightfully tasty & tender beef. Bravo Gordon!!!!

I loved seeing all of your suggestions. I followed the recipe generally - leaving in all the ginger - and it was a huge hit. Served it with soft polenta. I did not cook down the vegetables and liquid much... had added extra vegetables, too. On the second night, served the vegetables over orzo.

A nice change to the old fashioned pot roast that all our mothers taught us to make. Just discoverd parsnips and ooooo......baby they were good in this recipe. I didn't have the ginger root so I used ground ginger instead. Bet it would taste better with fresh... next time!

I made this tonight for dinner and thought it was great. After reading the other comments I watched for sweetness, I didn't measure but found the ginger alittle sweet, although I don't even think I added 1/4 . I cut it with extra juice from stewed tomatoes, added 5-6 cloves garlic. I thought this was a great recipe, served it with bow-ties/

Hard to go wrong with this one. All will enjoy. I doubled up on the mushrooms with no complaints too. Served with rice pilaf and a nice red wine.

I thought this was a wonderful pot roast recipe. I've made it a number of times, playing with the vegetable component to match what I have on hand. I usually thicken the sauce with a beurre manie just before serving. Hats off to Gordon!

This was a very flavorful dish, but in my opinion needs a bit of revising. The veggies were cooked way too long and should be in bigger pieces and added the last hour of cooking. Also I found it a little SWEET and would eliminate the brown sugar the next time around, but it was a great hit with my mother, age 82, who loves good, old fashioned pot roasts like her mother used to make.

Well, here we are getting the recipe again! We love the ginger/turnip-parsnip/port combination of tastes.

Fabulous! I also add ruttabagga (sorry spelling), what we call swede in the UK. I always make tons as my family insist that reheating makes it even richer! Serve with lashings of mashed potatoes to soak up the wonderful gravy!

This is perhaps the best pot roast we have ever eaten. It will become a family classic.

I read the reviews, and I must say that I disagree with them. I followed the recipe to the letter as well (a are enough occasion for me) and enjoyed it tremendously. Admittedly, I go through "palate cycles", and my current one seems be a tug-of-war between tangy and sweet flavors. I found it easy to make, and my dinner guests enoyed it, to ther point that I had no leftovers. I's like to try it next ewith venison or other game, as was suggested by another.

I agree with Mary Ellen; the flavors just weren't right (at least for us). While I didn't hate it, I would try another recipe before making this again. On the other hand, my Mother loved it and wants the recipe, thus we give it 2 forks.

Sorry...usually I can rely on these reviews, but in this case I disagree. The only modification I made was to omit the turnips/parsnips.Otherwise, followed it to the letter. I'm sure it turned out well, we just did not enjoy the flavors. maybe i'm too used to the old family standard, browning the beef & adding horseradish as it bakes slowly.

I admit I've never made this with beef, but it makes an outstanding venison, antelope or elk roast. The leftovers are flavorful and tender and work well for sandwiches, pot pies, etc.

Oddly, I've been making pot roast like this for a long time. I used potatoes, no parsnips or turnips. I didn't thicken sauce, I cooked it down so that it was kind of thick. All in all a good pot roast recipe.

This was excellent. I added some potatoes, what's a potroast without them? My 17 month old loved the meat. So tender.

Simply superb. The flavor the of sauce permeates the meat and tastes delicious. Since I didn't have port, I used Manischewitz Cream Blackberry wine left over from Passover. It did the job with verve. Definitely will make this one again.

This is to die for. I used portobello mushrooms. Be sure to buy a good bottle of port or the taste will not be as good. Definitely a winner.

Very good. Will definitely make this again. I omitted the parsnip and turnip.
