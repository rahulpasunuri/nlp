I made this for a fall wine pairing dinner where I wanted to have a dessert wine and something a bit unusual and of restaurant quality. Those goals were met as well as the ability to make this a day in advance. I did think the ice cream was missing a flavoring agent such as vanilla? and I added a bit more brandy to the pears. The walnut cake reminded me of a European confection -- very nutty, moist, and not overly sweet. I used a biscuit cutter to make 2 1/2" rounds of cake to serve, otherwise, there would have been too much cake per serving. Overall the flavors of all the components blended very well but I don't think I would make this dessert again. Our guests felt the concept and presentation were 5 stars but perhaps not their favorite as a dessert.

This dessert went over very well. I could make it in advance and the contrast in flavours was very complementary. I would make two changes for next time. First, I'd only serve half the amount of cake per person, given how sweet it is and how much else is going on. Second, rather than serving the pecorino on the side (people were a bit confused about what to do with it), I'd crumble the flaked cheese into the chilled ice cream custard before freezing to bring together the salt and pepper directly.

I just made the ice cream which was fantastic. I added about an extra teaspoon of whole pepper and a teaspoon of cracked pepper as I'm a bit of a pepper freak. Flavor is great though and it tastes great.

I made this last night for friends who liked it but didn't love it. I think it was the cake that seemed a weak link. The ice cream, cheese and pears were great; the cake was just ok. Another thought: all the colors are pretty creamy, so think about a colorful plate to make it look more interesting.

Fabulous dessert. I doubled peppercorns as I made a test batch of ice cream and could not taste any pepper. Doubled the pear liquor. Sauted pears in AM, then reheated just before assembly. Walnut cake is light and perfect. The cheese is a wonderful compliment. Everyone raved about this dessert.

I made this dessert for a salt and pepper themed dinner party. It received rave reviews, including "this is the best dessert I've ever had". The blend of flavors was amazing. I think it's important to use all elements (cake, pears, cheese and ice cream) to achieve the true compliment of this dessert. Fun and very different! I wouldn't change a thing.

Made it because it certainly sounds odd. Surprisingly good. Further, the cake, the ice cream, and the pears with cheese are good by themselves. Mix and match.
