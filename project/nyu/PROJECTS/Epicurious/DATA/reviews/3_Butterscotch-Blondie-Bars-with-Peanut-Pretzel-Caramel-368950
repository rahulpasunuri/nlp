I've made this twice with success. Last year I couldn't get the caramelized sugar to brown but didn't let it boil down to crystals just used it and it was delicious. This year I made 1.5 of the recipe and divided it into two pans to caramelize the sugar. I got it to brown much more easily in one pan over the other so cookware and the heat distribution of your utensils is important. Use a solid heavy bottom pan that will distribute heat evenly. Also once I had the sugar all nicely dissolved it is important to turn up the heat and watch carefully! Essentially you want the sugar to just start to burn so don't be afraid to crank it a bit. I agree that there is probably too many peanuts and will reduce in the future. I mix the peanut (please don't use salted too much salt!) and pretzels with the caramel but sprinkle a little fleur de sel on top. This takes it over the top. These are delicious regardless and so rich that when I serve them I cut them up into tiny little 1/2 inch squares. A BIG hit where ever I take them.

Made these bars for a holiday cookie exchange and they were a huge hit. Followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced peanuts to 2.5 cups; sprinkled the pretzels on top rather than mixing into caramel and then topped with the caramel. Did not have problems with the caramel as other reviewers. It takes time, patience, and attentiveness to get caramel just right. Definitely use a wet pastry brush to push down the crystalized sugar. I will make again.

This did not turn out... blondies and caramel turned out okay, but too many peanuts and pretzels and not enough caramel, so now I have bars with peanuts rolling around on top. nice.

Ugh! Way to sweet for me, and I have a huge sweet tooth! Couldn't get the topping right, though I did use maple syrup instead of honey due to my son's reaction...anyway it wouldn't stick to the Blondie, and just tasted like melted sugar with maple. Too much effort and mess for a disappointing result.

I had to do a review since so many were negative and I simply don't understand. I made thise for a party I hosted this weekend and by far, this was the most loved (adored? worshipped?) dish I offered. Caramel isn't too bad if you stay right over it. It always takes longer than I think it should, but it can turn fast. I even used the wrong kind of pan (my others were occupied) and the edges on the blondie were oddly shaped, but it turned out this offered more delicious edges to enjoy! I do admit, when I took out the blondies, they were HUGE and then sunk like a souffle gone awry. That I didn't expect, but the flavor wasn't affected and it was SO Yummy I didn't care at all. In sum, I WILL make this again without doubt and I will use the proper pan to make them prettier.

I followed the caramel directions, and spent over an hour trying to get a deep amber caramel. All I got was slightly brown, crusty layer of sugar. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I definitely won't bother trying to make these again.

This came out terriable. I did not find the directions hard so that was NOT the problem. The carmel over hardened and didn't adhere to the blondie so its two seperate s=desserts.

I'm not sure what went wrong for me, but I had a difficult time with the caramel. I almost always struggle with caramel, but usually because I burn it. Not this time. The water evaporated from the sugar leaving a crusty, bumpy layer of crystallized sugar in the pan. On the third try, I realized I could remelt this layer and it would turn into caramel. According to the directions, this wasn't really the proper chain of events. I must have been doing something wrong, but I'm not sure what it was (I was swirling, not stirring). Anyway, my caramel layer was way too hard and very sticky. I didn't serve them to anyone because I was afraid I would be responsible for sending them to the dentist with a broken tooth. This problem may have to do with how I reached my caramel. The blondie is very good, and I liked the flavors in the bars. I froze half of them, and I think I will break them up into a crumble for a topping of some sort.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I think there may have been a little too much going on at once. They're definitely good, and I'll probably make them again, but only if I have ample time.

These bars are incredibly good. After making the recipe, I left them uncut in the fridge for a few days since I knew I was saving them for company. Easy to cut, and they look cute too. I did read reviews before making them and put in fewer peanuts (about 2.5 cups) and more pretzels. People love the pretzels, so don't skimp. I'll definitely be making them again!

I really wanted to love these because I adore the salty-sweet combination. Based on previous reviews I reduced the amount of sugar and even so these were very sweet. I also cut the amount of peanuts in half and there were still too many. I didn't care for the honey in the caramel either. The blondie bottom was delicious and if I make this again I will probably make a different caramel topping.

I agree with the reviews that state this recipe is WAY too sweet. I used salted peanuts hoping that they would balance the copious amount of sugar in the bars and the caramel. That being said they've gotten raves from friends and family, so if you have a serious sweet-tooth I recommend the recipe.

These were fabulous, but I'll have to say we did not include the pretzels. We bought raw shelled peanuts, roasted them and then added some kosher salt to them before tossing with the caramel which provided the salt and sweet. Brought them to work and folks kept coming back for more.

Was really disappointed with this recipe. I was hoping for salty-sweet and ended up with overwhelming, cloying SWEET. I also felt like there wasn't enough of a distinction in the flavor of the bars and the topping.

These were amazing.....you eat one and you want another and another. I think they are best in the first couple of days of making them. Maybe you could freeze the blondie bars in a couple of pans and make 2 half-batches of the caramel when you want to serve them. I cut them inot one inch bars.

I baked these for a christmas party and I got great reviews. I think the problem other people had with this recipe was that caramel can be hard to get right. It took me two tries and then they turned out perfect. Definitely leave time to cool properly or else it won't work out. I would also suggest sprinkling the pretzels over the topping after you pour it on the blondie as all the salt dissolved off the pretzels when I stirred them in the caramel. I'm giving this recipe a 3 instead of a 4 because they were overly sweet I for myself. But the nuts were a pretty good balance.

Every year we bake 25-30 different types of cookies, giving mixed bags as gifts. Every year I try a few new ones, and retire some of the less stellar varieties. These have made it to the permanent list, they are wonderful! I found no problems with the recipe. However, if you've never made caramel before, follow the directions exactly or it can get grainy and not setup correctly. You must line the pan and turn it half way through so the blondie crust bakes evenly. I also poured on the caramel, popped in the fridge and forgot about it until the next morning. I let it sit on the counter 15 minutes, pulled the liner out of the pan and then cut it. It takes a bit of heft to cut through the top layer, but with a long, slicing blade and some pressure, they slice fine. I would not recommend trying to slice these in the pan. Caramel is tricky, so if this is your first attempt, some practice might be necessary.

blondies have been in the oven for 35 mins. oven temp holding at 350. Im so confused. I have made many brownies and blondies before but never had this issue. will give them another 5 mins and take out and let cool maybe this is how they are to be? any one out there have this issue?

The star of this recipe is the blondie base. The caramel peanut topping takes it over the top. I did not have any issues when cutting the bars, especially since I allowed the bars to chill in the fridge for 30-45 minutes before cutting. I think the amount of peanuts could be reduced, but the picture featured with the recipe accurately captures the thickness of the peanut layer.

Thought these were terrific! Though they are a little time consuming, they are simple to prepare. I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the peanuts to 2 1/2 cups, but wish I had increased the amount of pretzel by just a bit. I loved the salty crunch of the pretzels in that sweet mess of caramel. They were difficult to cut directly out of the fridge so let them sit out before slicing.

I agree with the poster who wrote that there was too much topping .... it totally overwhelmed the blondie base. I ended up having to throw many away. That said, the blondie itself is delicious with the browned butter. I will make it again, perhaps doing 1.5x the ingredients or in a 9x9 square to get a thicker blondie. I also used the topping as inspiration for peanut brittle, adding pretzels to the peanuts.

These are AMAZING. I am always a sucker for the salty sweet combo and these cookies are no exception. That said, I did find them very hard to cut when chilled so I chilled them for a bit to let the caramel harden and then stored at room temperature. Additionally, I used about 2 1/2 cups of toasted almonds instead of peanuts. Next time I might try hazelnuts or walnuts (not a big peanut fan) and leave out the honey.

I have already made two batches and they are divine. I followed the directions with no problem at all... but I did add about a half a cup of chocolate chips to the top just after pouring on the caramel mixture. Too sweet?? NEVER! I already have to send the recipe to tons of friends.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! I baked it for a cookie exchange and it received rave reviews from everyone; including my husband who doesn't like sweets and who ate 2 of them and then came in to tell me how awesome they were. Only changes I made were in using 3 cups of roasted, salted peanuts (because that was the size of bag and type that I could get from Trader Joes) and in using Trader Joes whole grain pretzel nuggets instead of the pretzel twists which are loaded with corn syrup. Will definitely make this again, it's like a decadent blondie with an awesome, homemade cracker jack flavor topping.

I followed the directions as written. They were not a sticky mess. I put them in the fridge right after I put the topping on and cut them the next morning. I sent them to my husbands office and three people requested the recipe. I gave them three forks because I felt they were very rich but they got rave reviews and looked great.

The candy topping was too hard to eat next to the soft blondie. Would try again with half the topping.

These worked perfectly. I only used about 2 1/2 cups of peanuts and it was plenty. The recipe tells you to store them in the fridge and you should. The caramel gets soft and a little runny at room temperature but the topping stays put. I made them for a Christmas party Saturday night and I pre cut them the day before. They looked great on the platter and tasted even better.

Another sticky mess. These don't hold their shape when cut and stick together horribly. They taste fine, but you might want to store them in the fridge.

The blondie is delicious and the topping is pretty good, but I wasn't much of a fan of the final result. First, it was WAY too much topping - especially the peanuts! The topping was thicker than the blondie; and I used at least 2 cups less peanut/pretzel mixture than called for. Also, the carmel became grainy as it cooled so my topping is more like a loose praline scattered over a blondie. It broke apart as soon as I cut it and now I have a mess. A tasty mess...but not something I want to present on a platter. Also, while you would expect it to be sweet, it's almost too sweet. I would make the blondie again, but would experiment with the top.

Rating: 4
Really easy and tasty. I made a half recipe and it was perfect. Next time I might use a little less peanuts as there were plenty and leave the pretzels a little more intact.

Yum yum yum!. I loved the blondie on its own. It has a great texture and a slight saltiness. But the caramel, peanuts and pretzles take this bar over the top. Love it!
