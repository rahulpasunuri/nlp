oops nevermind about the paprika and cayenne in my review below- that was for the sweet potato recipe. I AM tired.

This was really good with a few caveats.. The recipe for the corn bread at the link seems to be wrong- It calls for too much of the dry ingredients for the amount of wet. It came out like wheat bread dough. No way it could 'pour' into the pan. Another recipe on this site was very similar, except had 1/2 cup less flour.. that recipe was perfect. Like other reviewers I increased the paprika and cayenne by more than double. I used only half the aperitif and used chicken broth for the other half. The batch cooked in the turkey was moist and flavorful and wonderful. The batch cooked separately even with added broth and egg was too dry.

Four-fork rating. Enough said. Everyone who's ever tried this when I made it raved.

This was just OK for me. It is very licorice tasting, which I like, but felt it was too overpowering. I will try again and use store-bought corn bread instead of homemade, The homemade was a little too mushy, even though I dried it overnight.

This stuffing is amazingly good! We have made it every year for Thanksgiving since I discovered it in 1999. The cornbread adds a bit of sweetness, the fennel gives it a good crunch, and the flavors are delicious together. I have always stuffed inside the bird, and the stuffing comes out moist and wonderful. I have learned to double the recipe, since I make it ahead and my husband and I can't help stealing a spoonful or two (alright, MANY spoonfuls) before Thanksgiving morning arrives! Delicious -- you can't go wrong!

By far the best stuffing recipe we have ever had. the first time I made it I was afraid that the sausage flavor would be too strong. It isn't! THis is a sweet, savory stuffing that is perfect. I once suggested that we try something different and the family almost killed me for even suggesting it.

I dream of this stuffing year round. The Pernod, sausage and fennel really complement each other well. I do usually add a bit of chicken broth and sometimes and egg to it to get it to hold a bit better.

Please disregard the previous reviewer. This dressing is unbelieveable. I've made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas the last 3 years. Forget visions of sugar plums-I dream about this dressing. YumYum!

Too bad you didn't give the option of zero forks. This recipe was a dud. Speaking as one who loves fennel, anise, Pernod, Good&Plenty, and all things licorice, I found this stuffing recipe to be a Thanksgiving loser. Perhaps it has to do with my personal preference re: the ratio of bread/starch to other ingredients. I should have read the recipe more closely. Five cups of cornbread to 4.5 cups of diced fennel, plus fennel seeds plus Pernod plus 1 lb of crumbled sweet Italian sausage (which is scented with fennel) should have tipped me off that this dressing would be more like something you'd use to pack into mushroom caps. Even then, I think the fennel would have been too much. I tried to doctor the recipe up at the last minute by adding an extra cup of cornbread (that's all I had left after making a pan from scratch), but it disppeared under the weight of the sausage. Ugh. The family all said, "Oh, this isn't so bad." But nobody asked for seconds, and in today's fridge, the biggest leftover container is the one with the stuffing.

This stuffing is phenominally good! The fennel and wild rice and sausage form a marriage made in heaven. My gal is Jewish, so I couldn't do the Italian Sausage...but I found Italian CHICKEN Sausage...which I'd never seen before, and used that... What can I say? I licked the spoon...the bowl....and everything else that touched this dish.

Delicious, especially using my husband's fabulous cornbread. However, this is a rather dry stuffing, so the second time I made it, I soaked the cornbread cubes in heavy cream, then moistened the stuffing with chicken stock. Very good!

This was excellent! Instead of stuffing the turkey, I added some eggs to the mixture to bind it together and stuffed halves of red and orange bell peppers. Also topped with a bit of grated Grana Padano. The peppers made for a lovely, colorful Thanksgiving presentation and all were gone in minutes! Next time I'll make more per person. HUGE HIT with everyone.

The fennel flavor in this dish is just right...not overpowering...and is a nice complement to the sausage. My cornbread ended up a little dry. I tried to doctor it up with some chix broth, but it still came out of the oven on the dry side. I baked this in casserole dish, not inside of the turkey (which I think would have helped with the moistness). The flavor was very, very good, and I'll definitely try in again (with better corn bread). A nice change from the traditional Tgiving stuffing.

Have been making this since the recipe first came out in 1995! It is perfect with the madiera gravy & turkey. This stuffing has spoiled us!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe -- We have made it four times and we're making it again for this Thanksgiving. We use half sweet and half hot Italian sausage and it's perfect. Also, we, like other reviewers, always add some chicken broth because it looks as if it needs a little moisture. Add what feels right and you have a delicious, unusual, perfect stuffing! Don't hesitate -- make it!

I've made this stuffing for the past 2 Thanksgivings - both times to rave reviews. Last year the Pernod was not available, but no one at the table missed it. Really a great dish. My husband asks for it long after Thanksgiving is over. It also goes very well with the apple cider-maple syrup and herb rub.

Outstanding! Smooth, definitive fennel flavor, without being too strong. Me and my guests loved it.

I am very picky about stuffing but honestly this was amazing. I added an egg and a little broth to moisten the mixture just because I am used to a certain consistency. If you do not have Pernod you can use Sambuca which is a licorice or Anise flavor apertif. The alcohol cooks away immediately. Just really good!

Rating: 3
Wow! Really good! I took the suggestion of adding an egg for a more solid consistency, but changed nothing else. It was great...not dry at all, a little sweet from the corn bread, and a perfect complement to the rest of the meal. I will make this again!

I like to try new stuffings year to year. This was pretty good. Not a fabulous stuffing, but not bad either. very easy to prepare..might do it again sometime.

I don't understand. Previous reviews say add a little more stock, but the recipe has no stock in it??? Haven't made it yet, because ist seems it would be too dry? Am i missing something?

Rating: 3
Very well received! I also added a cup of extra turkey broth and cooked it inside the turkey. I thought the extra cooked outside the turkey was a little dry and will doctor it up for leftovers.

I really enjoyed this recipe and thought it was very good and very unique and will definitely make it again. The flavor of the anise which can be pretty strong, was mellow enough that it didn't get in the way. I had to try a few snorts of Pernod while I was making the stuffing and I wasn't motivated to pour any more on, maybe I'll strip some paint with it later. Very good but maybe a little too funky for my Grandma and the Thanksgiving stuffing.

This recipe has become a perennial favorite in my home. I make it every year to rave reviews. I just add a little more stock to keep it from drying.

Very good recipe. Add a little additional stock to keep it nice and moist.

The best stuffing ever. I had to make some changes to the recipe but it really was the BEST stuffing my family and I have ever had. I used more butter (a few reviewers recommended that), no pernod (I couldn't find it) so I threw some red wine in with the sausage and onions. I doubled the recipe and made it the night before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving day I stuffed the turkey and put the remaining in a large baking pan. I used the leftover turkey juices to baste the stuffing lightly before baking. It was SOOOOO good!

This is absolutely my favorite stuffing recipe. I made it last Thanksgiving for the first time, and we couldn't get enough of it. I made it again for Christmas. And I can't wait to make it again this year. It is moist, flavorful and subtantial and I recommend it highly.

This was very flavorful and everyone liked it. However, I did add about 1 cup additional chicken broth and 1 egg beaten to the mixture before baking to give it a more solid consistency.

My boyfriend and I both thought this stuffing was a little dry. Granted, we cooked it apart from the bird, which would have made it more moist, but we were afraid of bacteria. Next time, we'll take our chances. If you do want to cook it apart from the bird, I'd use A LOT of butter in your cornbread recipe--more than it calls for. Otherwise it's just too dry. But the fennel and sausage flavor together is just delicious.

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition in my home. The flavors work beautifully together.

Simply fantastic!! Make sure to make with the corn bread as in the recipe. I used a coarse ground cornmeal that I feel was the key (Bob's Red Mill medium grind cornmeal). A great blend of flavors!

Based on earlier reviews, I also made this stuffing for Thanksgiving, and found it so delightful that I'm making it again for Christmas Dinner. It seemed a little drier than I've been used to but everyone raved about it.

I was afraid that with all the licorice flavored ingredients that this would be too strong. But not at all. Even though this calls for fennel, pernod, and fennel seeds, it turns out to have a mild fennel taste. I prepared it for thanksgiving dinner outside of the bird and we all loved it.

Rating: 4
Wow- made this for the 1st time for T-giving. Really delicious- I actually prefered the stuffing cooked outside the bird, because I liked the crunch the top developed. I used crusty italian bread instead of corn bread and it worked just fine. This is the best dressing I've made in years. I will make it again! and probably before next Thanksgiving!

This is very flavorful. We tried it as a holiday recipe and it became a regular. We love to take this to potlucks because nobody every brings stuffing and it's always devoured.
