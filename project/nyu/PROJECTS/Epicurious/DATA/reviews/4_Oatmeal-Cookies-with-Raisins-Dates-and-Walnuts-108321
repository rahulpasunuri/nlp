Cutting out the white sugar, using maple syrup rather than honey and skipping the dates made these wonderful in the European manner-no sugar loading. I also used coconut oil for the shortening and this too added a touch of greatness. 4 fours it would be if the site let me!

This cookie is fantastic. I used only the brown sugar and honey, and the cookies were still sweet. Love the hint of cinnamon and honey that you taste in the cookie, so yummy, love crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside cookies. I think next time I'll substitute the raisins for dried cranberries. If you like oatmeal cookies, you'll definitely love this.

Rating: 4
After reviewing many of the recipes I settled on this one. With a few changes I found it to be a great treat! I substituted dry cranberries for all of the fruit and changed the honey to agave nectar. Baking time is really 12 minutes. Yields a soft center with a slightly crisp exterior. I am a chef and teach baking. I will include this in my students packet.

I ditched the raisins, dates & walnuts and sub'd black mission figs & pecan---amazing...absolutely amazing. Good: cause everyone loves them. Bad: cause I now have to make them all the time!

I'm not forking because I made changes. (I would give 3 forks though.) These cookies are not too sweet... it's a cookie recipe for goodness sake! It's supposed to be sweet. I didn't cut the sugar like other reviewers. I didn't toast the walnuts like other reviewers. However, I didn't use the shortning... I just made up the difference with butter. The cookies didn't run all over the pan like an earlier reviewer suggested they would -- however they didn't have that plastic shortening sheen they would have had either. (I'm not a fan of shortning.) I substituted ground vanilla for the extract and I used granulated maple sugar instead of brown sugar (but I've tested that substitution on countless other recipes and it doesn't change the flavor). Every thing else I did by the book. These are tasty cookies. The dough was tasty too!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I had to chuckle at the posts. Everyone who liked this recipe created their own version of it. So, the one person who posted that they don't understand the four fork ratings is actually right - no one seemed to like the recipe in it's original form. Kudos to creativity!

Great recipe, easy to do with the kids and the results are fantastic! Only used 1/2 the sugar and they are great... why sooo much sugar??? The dates and the honey provide natural sweetness that doesn't hype up the kids.

Cannot understand all the four-forkers here. This cookie is unbearably sweet! I followed some reviewers' suggestions omitting the 1 cup white sugar and doubling the salt. I also substituted craisins for the raisins (more tart). Still too sweet - and I'm sure that the texture suffered. Perhaps also omit the honey? No, I think I'll just keep looking for a good recipe.

These cookies taste exactly the way you expect them to. I made a few adjustments.Used spelt flour which is interchangeable with white and/or whole wheat flour. Used 1c. butter no shortening...and no problem with spreading, quite the opposite actually. Added 1 tsp. gr.cloves and dash gr. nutmeg. Toasted the walnuts - tasted and smelled great.And I used only 1 cup of Sucanat in place of the sugar. These were most certainly sweet enough...would not want them ANY sweeter.

...And yes, definitely toast the walnuts.

My all time favorite oatmeal cookies with the following alterations: Decrease white sugar by half. Add extra spices (nutmeg, allspice, ginger)with the cinnamon. Use all butter rather than shortening. Sometimes I switch out the dates and raisins with dried cranberry and coconut, or dark chocolate with dried cherries to change things up, since I make these cookies so often. They are my fiancé's favorite too.

Rating: 4
These are excellent Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. No, they don't need chocolate chips, no they don't need cocoa powder - that would be a different recipe now wouldn't it?! I followed recommendations to toast and cool walnuts and the roasted nut flavour really comes through in the cookies. Didn't have enough dates so substituted 1/3 cup craisins and 1/3 cup goji (wolf) berries. They do spread out and crisp up nicely from leaving them on the cookie sheet to cool. Used parchment paper on the cookie sheets instead of foil

Rating: 4
My two cents on this recipe: it has the right proportions of butter/sugar and dry ingredients. Some recipes have way too much butter and are sort of greasy. The solid vegetable shortening helps to give the cookies some shape. With all butter they would really spread out. 1/4 cup for the whole recipe isn't so bad. they weren't too sweet for me but it probably woulldn't hurt the end result to reduce the sugar. I love dates but didn't have any so I used raisins, cranberries, cherries. I did cook them longer - 14 minutes - so they would get nice and brown. They are still moist and chewy. Also added a 4-oz bar of dark choc cut up. What's a dessert without chocolate?

Rating: 3
Very good. For curiosity sake I'm going to try them again without the cup of white sugar and see what happens. Has anyone else done this? I think they may end up really chewy and maybe easier (sugar-content wise) on my munchkin's teeth. :)

I made these cookies for Christmas. Other than adding a drizzle of icing once the cookies cooled, I didn't modify anything. They were a big hit, nice and chewy, and not too sweet. The dates are a nice touch.

Rating: 4
I agree with other reviewers that this recipe benefits from slightly less sugar. Also, I toasted and cooled the nuts before adding them to the batter. Lastly, I made some cinnamon buttercream frosting and turned some of the treats into sandwich cookies. I documented the whole thing including the slightly modified recipe with photos of the final cookies on my website, if you want to check it out. http://makinglifedelicious.com/2010/11/03/oatmeal-raisin-date-cookies-with-toasted-walnuts/

Very unique oatmeal cookie recipe. The cookies had a special sweet fragrance that lingered in your mouth after eating them. I didn't have dates on hand, so I used all raisins instead. But I'll try to get some dates next time, just to see how it will change the flavor.

I made these cookies for a party and they were a huge hit! However, they took me a very long time to make, so the next time I baked oatmeal cookies I used a quicker, simpler recipe. For really special oatmeal cookies, though, I would use this recipe again.

I followed reviewers suggestions and eliminated the white sugar. I used all dates, no raisins. Even though I like sweet cookies this was sweet enough, I might even reduce the sugar further, or use fewer dates and more nuts. A good recipe, but my all time favorite is still the apricot pistachio oatmeal cookie on this sight which I make without alteration.

Rating: 4
I made a few substitutions (as most seem to have done). I cut the flour by one cup and added an extra cup of oats. This probably made their shapes less cookie-like but taste and health are improved. I doubled the honey and skipped the white sugar altogether. Instead of vegetable shortening, I used 1/2 cup sunflower seed butter (or peanut butter). You can add more to cut down on butter. Not having dates or raisins I doubled the walnuts. Also I added a teaspoon of nutmeg. Measurements are approximate, but my housemate claims they were the best cookies ever.

Rating: 3
Recipe was overall very good, however, I modified to make it a bit more healthy (my husband eats a flax cookie or veg/fruit muffin in the morning--objective was to make a tasty sub). As most have done, cut the white sugar completely out and used only 1 cup of brown sugar, and substituted Steens Cane syrup for the honey. Increased the oats and cut back the flour each by 1/2 C. Put fresh grated nutmeg & cinnamon. Added coconut (unsweetened)instead of dates. You can also sub one cup of 60% cocoa semi swt dark chocolate. Always looking for ways to cut back on the sugar and did not miss it. Had good "mouth feel" with the coconut, raisins, more oats & nuts.

Rating: 3
These are really toothsome -- WITH the modifications below, many of which I cadged from others' suggestions. Replaced 1/2 cup of the white flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Decreased overall sugar by eliminating the white sugar altogether. Left in the 1 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey (by the way, I don't think you can reduce the honey unless you increase some other liquid in the recipe). I INCREASED the salt to 1 tsp (from 1/2 tsp) and that brought out the flavors better; don't worry, this won't make the cookies "salty" in the slightest. I toasted the walnuts before adding them into the recipe. They add a richness to the cookie that wouldn't have been there without the toasting.

The cookies were too sweet and very bland.

Absolutely delicious!! and healthy. I was craving oatmeal raisin and walnut.. added apples too. My new favorite. I did alter the recipe a bit. Cut white and brown sugar in half..used splenda brown sugar and half splenda/half white sugar. also used half "white whole wheat flour' and half white flour. Diced up a Gala Apple instead of using dates. baked for about 15-20 min instead of 10. and only had butter so all butter.

These cookies are excellent and easy to make. I substituted one egg by a small container of banana yogurt and did not use the 1 cup of white sugar. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. They were not too sweet and even friends who eat only "healthy" ate them. M. Dextras

Yum. Halved the recipe and it turned out just fine -- at the suggestion of other reviewers I did cut the sugars in half. I thought the batter tasted too much of honey, but the finished cookie was just right. Didn't have any dates on hand, but didn't miss them at all.

Rating: 3
Modifications: 1/2 c white sugar 3/4 c brown sugar 1 1/2 c white raisins 1 1/2 c chopped walnuts No dates Soft and chewy on inside, nuts came out tasting good (probably because of how much butter and shortening is used!). Only complaint was that the cookies were almost *too* sweet and chewy -- a bit sickening. I'd suggest even less sugar than I used. The white raisins and extra nuts went very well.

Rating: 2
I made these with a few minor changes per others' suggestions: subbed 1/2 c. flour w/ 1/2 c. whole wheat flour; reduced white sugar to 1/4 c.; used assorted large raisins instead of raisin/date combo. These cookies have a nice texture, although they are pretty bland. Also, the walnuts are barely detectable. I think I'll use a more basic recipe (minus honey, shortening, etc.) next time. Expectations were high due to the 4-fork rating -- these are just "meh."

This recipe is exactly what I was hoping for...chewy, flavorful, easy. I did use 1 1/2 cups of dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, which seemed to make the recipe even more flavorful.

I only had one egg so I added a half cup of 1% milkfat organic yogurt. Based on other oatmeal cookie recipes I made in the past I thought the cookies would be bland w/o more spice. So I added a 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Didn't have enough dates so to my 1/4 cup dates I added 1 and 3/4 cups raisins, apricots and cranberries and chocolate chips. I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 a cup and the brown to 3/4 cups. Amazing results. Everyone keeps asking me for the recipe.

Really good oatmeal raisin cookies- soft texture and nice crunch. I substituted 1/2 c. wheat flour for white flour, only put in 1/2 c. white sugar and 3/4 c. brown sugar, used 1/2 golden raisins/dark raisins, and soaked all dried fruit in hot water before draining/adding to dough. Yum!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and subbed in WW flour and cut down on the sugar--this worked great! But then I made a change that I can only blame on being pregnant and being helped by two preschoolers: I left out the oatmeal!! Even without the main ingredient, these cookies still rocked!! :)

Delicious! I read many of the other reviewers comments and followed their advice. I halved the recipe and got 2 trays of cookies. I didn't have brown sugar, honey or dates, so I used 1 cup white sugar plus a couple tsp molasses, and substituted chocolate chips for the dates. They were chewy and moist. Next time, I'll reduce sugar even more.

I didn't have dates on hand both times I made it, and I used currants instead of raisins, but these are spicy and chewy and delicious. I like shaping the dough into a log and slicing them after putting them in the fridge overnight. They become almost florentine-like in texture, thin and caramelly, which I love.

Excellent!! Normally I follow the recipe as is the first time, even though I'll read all the suggestions. However when everyone remarked that the cookies were too sweet and half a cup of wheat flour was a good idea, I decided to follow suit and cut the sugars back and use the half cup ww flour. I also divided the recipe in half and made one half with the raisens/dates, the other with cherries/cho chips as one writer suggested. I don't know which was best- -just make them and watch them disappear!

This is a perfect basic oatmeal cookie recipe - the honey & cinammon really make it.

They were heaven - my husband said they were the best cookie he ever had.

Delicious cookies! I left out the dates and added a few more walnuts. The smooth walnut flavor balances the cookie's sweetness.

My husband dislikes oatmeal cookies with a passion and, yet, LOVED this cookie. I followed all the amounts, only substituting half the flour with white whole wheat(King Arthur), using all butter, and adding a touch of nutmeg and cloves to balance the sweet with some heartiness and spice. Turned out GREAT! BTW, if you use pre-chopped dates, you can skip the "flouring" and soaking the raisins first will give them more flavor and plumpness, or simply use baking raisins. I may add more nuts next time for a bit more crunch and earthiness. Amazingly good cookie!

I made oatmeal cookies tonight (not this recipe) and they didn't come out as I had hoped. So now I too am looking for the *perfect* chewy oatmeal cookie recipe. I have read many of the reviews of several recipes on this site and will soon try them all and rate them. I think it is fascinating that people from all over the WORLD are on this same quest. Who would've ever thought the simple oatmeal cookie would get so much attention? And now I'm one of those people who say things about recipes they haven't tried...sorry! :)

Wonderful recipe but just a bit too sweet, as other reviewers said. Next time, I'll cut back on the white sugar. Still, they came out nice and sort of flat like store-bought oatmeal cookies, not puffy like those from other recipes. I didn't put in the walnuts, and I didn't have foil, so I just buttered the cookie sheet and it was fine.

Rating: 3
Like everyone said, really sweet - even when I reduced the sugar in half. Will eliminate all together and just use the honey. That gives them lovely moisture. I used quick oats and they were soft and chewy. Will add a little more on the dates and raisins sides as I do not include walnuts. And definitely will take a previous reviewer's advice to flour the dates first. I tried doing it with the oats, but that wasn't enough. Am making them again as I write this!

I have made these cookies many times, and they are always fabulous. I always cut back on the sugars, often substitute agave nectar for some of the sugar, and always use all butter, instead of shortening. My favorite change is to use dried sour cherries instead of the raisins and add some chocolate chips. The combo of cherry/chocolate is to die for. My 3 sons who all live on their own can't wait for me to drop by with these!

I made a healthy version of this cookie and it turned out so delicious...perfect blend of spices...and the honey made a nice, subtle difference from everyday oatmeal cookies. I just subsituted whole wheat flour, used Splenda (both kinds), soy flour plus water for the eggs, and Smart Balance for the butter. The result is a great snack, where you don't feel guilty! Although they're so good, you may be tempted to eat more than one!

Rating: 3
I made the Splenda substitutions suggested by the 2/28/06 reviewer from Midwest USA. I also substituted toasted, chopped pecans from Trader Joe's for the walnuts. I found that because the Medjool dates that I chopped were quite sticky and tended to clump together once chopped, sifting some flour over the chopped dates and then separating them before mixing them into the cookie dough was an easy, foolproof way to not have them clump within the dough mixture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. These cookies received raves and will become one of my standbys.

These cookies were fine, I suppose. They were just a tad on the sweet side. I didn't have dark brown sugar on hand so I added a bit of molasses.

After reading previous reviews, I made the exact recipe (using home grown dates that I dried) except for these changes. Cut back the white and brown sugar to 2/3 c. each.

These cookies are fabulous. For those of you stating that they are too sweet because of the dates, are you using store-bought diced dates or are you dicing whole dates? Store-bought diced dates have dextrose (sugar) added to them so they won't stick together....which adds to the sweetness. I've made the recipe using 1/2 c. white Splenda, 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar Splenda (for all of the brown sugar - you use 1/2 of the amount the recipe requires for the brown sugar Splenda)....the results were terrific - crisp and chewy! It does help to press the dough down a little (maybe 5/8 of an inch high) but not too much. I do not add the raisins (taste preference).

Excellent biscuit! Nice combination of crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside. Substitutions: I used all butter (220 grams) and only 3/4 of a cup of each of the sugars, and dried apricots instead of the raisins.

These cookies were great but too sweet. I made them for my three-year-old daughter after the doctor ordered more fiber into her diet. I made the recipe exactly but next time will try leaving out the white sugar entirely and then adding back a little at a time if that doesn't work. Also, this is the first time a recipe has yielded MORE cookies than promised. I used my rounded TBS measuring spoon and made nice heaping balls and still ended up with 5 dozen and a few extras.

Okay, I monkeyed with this one to make it low-fat, low-sugar. Cut out the white sugar entirely, and only one cube of butter. Use apple sauce instead of the extra fat. Then put in lots of chopped, dried fruit: apricots, cherries, raisins, dates, and plenty of nuts. They're still totally delicious cookies and carry far less guilt.

Again, another great recipe to inspire one's creativity. For a while, I'd been looking to replicate the oatmeal/coconut/dried fruit cookes found in the Wild Oats Market. This recipe, with modifications, became even better than the original. Like the other reviewers, I used all butter. I substituted spelt flour for all purpose, 1.5 cups sweetened shredded coconut for the white sugar, dried cranberries for the dates, and 2 cups lightly toasted pecans for the walnuts. I quickly pulsed the oats, coconut, nuts, cranberries, and raisins thru my food processor to give the cookes a less ragged texure. Twenty-four hours after baking (I'm surprised they've lasted that long - I must have eaten about half last night), the cookies are nice and chewy, but with a crisp exterior. I credit the honey in the recipe for that. GREAT recipe!!
