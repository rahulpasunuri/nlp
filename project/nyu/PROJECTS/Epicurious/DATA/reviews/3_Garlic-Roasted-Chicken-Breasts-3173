I took the garlic, peeled it and threw it in a foil pouch with olive oil and seasoning and roasted it in the toaster oven (350 f), turning and checking it frequently. It was so flavorful and delicious. Who in their right mind BOILS garlic? I made it with a "mashed potatoes with crimini mushrooms" recipe I found on this site. The roasted garlic sauce made a FANTASTIC gravy. My fiance raved!

Used roasted garlic instead of boiled, and added chopped up roasted red pepper. Once the garlic was done roasting I threw a handful of oregano into the leftover garlic, shut off the oven, and let it infuse the oil. I used the oil to saute the chicken and added the oregano to the chicken at the garlic step. Delicious. There was LOTS of flavor! I made this recipe once as it and it was BLAND, especially considering it used an ENTIRE head of garlic!

We really enjoyed this dish. Even our 5 year old daughter who generally hates chicken breast dishes gave it a good review (and ate it too!). I made a few changes . . . I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and chicken was tender and juicy. I added a pinch or two of flour to thicken the wine sauce. Really delicious, I always know its a good one if my husband refrains from adding red pepper flakes!

I also found this to be quite bland. I had added tomatoes into the pan prior to finishing it in the oven. Will maybe throw some fresh time sprigs in the wine sauce next time to add flavor.

After making this once, I decided to try it again with roasted garlic and a bit more wine for the sauce. It was Delicious!! I recommend it with the chipotle cheese mashed potatoes from this site, a spinach salad, and garlic cheese toast made w/the roasted garlic! Mmmmmm

I also cooked this on the stove-top instead of baking. The chicken came out great and juicy. I added Thyme and French Herbes de Province as well as the sage. This combination gave the chicken a nice flavor. I added more white wine then was called for which gave me more sauce at the end but cut the garlic taste some. Next time I think I will add some cream to thicken instead of wine. All in all a good (not great) dish... My boyfriend loved it.

This was one of the blandest chicken recipes I have ever experienced. What a waste of an entire head of garlic.

Made this dish several weeks ago, and we enjoyed it then, the only change I made was to roast the garlic instead of boiling it, I feel it gave a richer flavor to the dish, we will continue to make it this way. Delicious!!!!

One more thing - the flavor of the boiled garlic was fine. Actually it was a good balance - too strong for my boyfriend, while I could have it stronger. I am glad I learned that trick of boiling the garlic and will use that for other meals in the future.

Even with all my mistakes (peeled garlic *before* boiling, forgot to cover chicken until end, needed to transfer to a baking dish because I used a non-ovenproof skillet, and used half a bottle of wine by mistake) it still came out great. I would probably only give it 2 forks, but it was so easy, resistant to my poor recipe-following skills, and above all, my boyfriend thought it was really great. I'dm definitely try it again. Hopefully peeling the garlic after it's been boiled will make it even easier too. (and less stinky!)

I love easy recipes and this is definitely easy. I used skinless chicken breasts and added some thyme as someone suggested and it was delish. My only complaint is boiling the garlic. I thought it deadened the garlic flavor. I will oven roast them next time.

We enjoyed it very much. But I oven roasted the garlic instead of boiling it. I thought it would give it a richer flavor. We will makw it again just the same way

Wonderful! Made as directed except for tucking some fresh bay leafs under skin and using bone-in breasts (which actually made the cooking time correct!) and could not have been happier.

Yum! This recipe was excellent! I took the advise of one of the chefs on here and stuffed the chicken with the oregano butter from another recipe and it was great. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and they came out tender and juicy. I made this dish for company and they were amazed. I will certainly make this one again.

My husband and I make this dish regularally. Simle, tasty and fast. I don't boil my garlic, just peel it and toss it in with onions while i am browning the chicken. Sometimes when making the sause i add cream and use my stick blender to macerate the garlic and onions. YUM.

I made this for company, and everyone loved it. One of the children claimed it was the best chicken he'd ever eaten. The chicken was very moist.

This recipe is so incredibly tasty for so little effort! Be sure to use plenty of dried sage (enough to coat the chicken breasts). Can be made using skin-on or skinless chicken breasts--tastes great both ways! I've made this many, many time and am always pleasantly surprised by how wonderful it is--especially served with basmati rice and steamed broccoli.

I was excited to try this recipe after all the rave reviews - however - it did not have as much flavor as I anticipated. It was so-so. May make it again but will defintiely do some modifications to add flavor.

This was great! The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the whole thing was easy to prepare. My only problem was the sauce--there really wasn't enough of it to warrant the final step of the recipe. Still, this is an easy winner.

Very delicious. Tastes almost identical to Chicken with 40 cloves of garlic, but on a smaller scale. The garlic is sweet and subtle so even my kids love it!

This is a wonderful dish. Very easy and tasty. The sage adds a great flavor and appearance, and the chicken is juicy and tender. I would double the wine next time because it didn't make a lot of sauce, and roast the garlic first instead of boiling (roasted leaves much more flavor).

Two problems I had with the completion of the recipe: I couldn't get the breasts to brown, even though I had patted the breasts dry before I put them in the olive oil. The breasts were from my local butcher, so I don't think they had a salt solution pumped into them which might have prevented browning. The other problem: I oversalted with kosher salt. I'm sensitive to salt, the older I get, so I need to be more careful. Delicious and so simple to make!

EXCELLENT DISH WELL WORTH THE LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA WORK.

This is similar to a dish I've made for years, but without the several tablespoons of butter and chicken broth of the first one. The addition of sage and the lower fat content make this a winner. We served with warm Kalamata foccacia, and spread the soft garlic cloves on the bread and dipped in the garlic sauce--it was truly delicious! Probably more of a family meal than for guests, but a definite keeper!

Lacking sage, I used parsley flakes instead. My boyfriend actually told me that this was the best-tasting meal I ever cooked! I'm definitely making this again!

This was a delicious dish. I made it last night, but substituted thyme for the sage. It worked out well. I agree in using more wine and oil next time to make more sauce... it was so good. Made it w/ mashed potatoes, a very good match. It's a pretty easy recipe, too. Only minus is that it kind of used a lot of dishes (incl. the mashed potatoes, that is)

This dish was a big hit with my family. We loved the sage flavor. Next time I will increase the wine and oil to have more sauce.

Fantastic, fast and easy. Substituted rosemary for the sage, and roasted the garlic in olive oil rather than boil. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and a spinach salad. Wonderful dish. Took advice of others and didn't cooks as long. Came out perfect. I didn't use breasts with skin on either.

This was delicious, I also made it on the stove top instead of baking and it turned out just fine. Thanks!

I made this with chicken thighs and it was really delicious. I think I would have roasted the garlic alone in the oven until it was almost tender and then add it to the chicken. The sauce was scrumptious. I also used French herbes de province which made it even better. I added roasted red bell peppers to the sauce. This is definitely a keeper!

Very easy and the dish has wonderful flavors. I added a pinch of rosemary to the sage and deglazed with the white wine. Watch the chicken though; mine was a tad dry. I will definitely puree the sauce next time.

The sauce is lovely; I puree it as well. Easy to double recipe. I'm going to try this sauce with a large roasted chicken breast however, as sauteing and handling all the individual pieces can be a bit much.

I have been making this recipe since it was first published. It is a wonderfully simple dish. I have never baked the chicken as the recipe calls for, I always make it all on the stove top. Saute the chicken breasts for about 5 minutes per side, then remove them from the pan as you reduce the sauce. When the sauce is almost finished, use a hand blender to emulsify it a bit more. It will turn out much creamier than if you leave it alone. Add the chicken breasts at the end to rewarm them. BEWARE: you will smell like garlic for about 24 hours after eating this, but it's worth it!

I thought this recipe was wonderful, easy and delicious. I made a few adjustments though. To make the sauce after the chicken was cooked, I pureed the roasted garlic and wine sauce and then thickened. I also added some chopped mushrooms. Yummy!

This recipe is definitely simple to make and worth the effort. I added some heavy cream to the sauce when boiling to make a creamy sauce, that and a bit of flour to thicken. Overall, the chicken was very tender and tasty.

Tasty and fast. Instead of adding whole garlic cloves to the dish, I roasted the garlic, then added it to the dish. Further, I added sauteed mushrooms to the finished product.

The sage and garlic flavors are well balanced in this easy chicken dish. I have varied the amount of sage and added extra garlic and nothing seems to hurt it. It's fail-proof. My husband loves it. Use a nice white wine for a more powerful taste. But I've used regular white cooking wine and that works fine, too.

Quite tasty. A few revisions. Before reducing the sauce, I removed the garlic and roasted it off (on a baking sheet sprayed with olive oil cooking spray)in the oven for about 5 minutes (425 degrees or so). I then seved the garlic as an additional accompaniment/garlic with the chicken. Also, as I was reducing the sauce I added some low salt chicken stock.
