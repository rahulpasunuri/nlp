This was easy, tasty, and different. Thanks to reviewers, I roasted the hens whole and didn't precook the bacon: 425 for 40 min then 450 for 10 min to brown tops and crisp bacon. I used a 13oz jar of raspberry jam with seeds with the 1/2 cup vinegar and simmered it for almost 30 minutes (because I got distracted) and the glaze was lovely and thick and stayed put. My only challenge was that the little organic hens gave off a lot of liquid, about 2 inches deep it would have been, and it seemed a good idea to drain that from the roasting pan, which was awkward.

I felt like a culinary goddess after preparing this. I cooked the hens whole and wrapped them with bacon and tucked under to look like an "X" across the chest. Served with zucchini pasta (mandolin sliced) and it looked absolutely gorgeous on the plate. Absolutely agree with ginger and red pepper flakes. I juiced the ginger and kept adding to my glaze as I basted during the whole hour of cooking at 375. Kept the glaze from getting to clumpy and spread better. Did tuck honeybell orange slices under the breasts and back of each hen. EVERYONE commented on how moist and juicy the meal was. I couldn't believe myself. Absolutely devine!

I would have given this 4 forks but the glaze was a problem. It says to reduce it to 1/2 cup but doing so creates a gloppy, sticky mess that doesn't want to 'spread' as others have noted. That being said the result was fantastic. The flavor of the bacon with the glaze is to die for. I think the reason that people noted the flavor doesn't permeate the meat is probably because we all take the skin off this days. To make again, I will not reduce the glaze as much and put it under the skin of the hen. Then while roasting brushing the glaze on as written. Mine looked just like the photo.

OMG! I thought this was exceptional! On my top 10 list of chicken recipes. Did add a little bit of grated fresh ginger but don't think it needed it. Would be a great dinner for a crowd as you could get everything ready ahead of time and then roast. Served wild rice and green beans that were blanched and then sauteed with a small amount of the bacon grease.

This was a last minute Thanks Giving dinner decision for my visiting son so when I did not have the appropriate Balsamic Vinegar and Seedless Raspberry Jam I substituted a reduction of a nice tart red wine and jellied cranberries. The reduction was just beautiful and fit the occasion. The glaze was crimson and gorgeous! The remaining juices were perfect for my yams leaving them sweet and tender. Would definitely repeat.

Wow. I've never done hens but after all the great reviews I decided to give it a shot - good choice! Boyfriend was blown away. I used powdered ginger & red pepper flakes in glaze. Only had 4 pieces of bacon so criss-crossed them over the top of the hens. Biggest addition was to add slices of orange under the skin - the citrus was great with the rest of the flavors. Nice presentation & oh so gooey! Will be making these for guests!

this is an excellent recipe. I also did not pre-cook the bacon, set the oven at 400 and at 450 for the last 5-10 mins to crisp the bacon. I also added ginger and pepper flakes. Also to make the glaze thicker, I suggest using balsalmic glaze instead of vinegar. I had some raspberry balsalmic glaze so I used about 1/2 regular balsalmic glaze and 1/2 raspberry. It was delicious!

Delicious! What more needs to be said?

This dish was totally delicious! I read all of the previous reviews and made the following changes--added some ginger and red pepper to the glaze; had some fresh raspberries on hand so threw those in too; did not cook the bacon before wrapping the hens with it. But the biggest change that I found was the amount of time that it took to reduce the glaze. I didn't time it but I think it was more like 20-25 minutes instead of 8. Too bad that recipe was incorrect in this estimate.

I'm going to be one of the few dissenters here. I thought this was just OK (although everyone I served it to really liked it). I had the sauce on the stove for a really long time--I don't think it ever reduced to 1/2 cup (there's no way that could have happened in 8 minutes!). My glaze had body, but wasn't as thick as I'd expected, and the result was that the chicken had the flavor of the glaze but the skin didn't crisp up as I'd expected. I just don't think this dish lived up to the expectation.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious and easy too. I reduced glaze to about 3/4 cup and baked hens for about 45 minutes as they were compact in my roaster. Got rave reviews. Will definately make again - can't wait.

Absolutely fantastic! The flavors were wonderful. I did add ginger to the glaze and doubled the sauce as was suggested below. I will make the hens again and again. I served them with Balsamic Sweet Potatoes (beyond yummy) and popovers.

I added some fresh thyme sprigs under the bacon, which I did not pre-cook. Despite the fact that they refer to this as a summer dish, I think its flavors are more suited to Autumn/Winter, in addition to the fact that it requires oven roasting.

I don't quite understand the mixed reviews on this dish. I followed the directions for the most part, adding more raspberries (frozen) to the glaze and a tiny bit of ginger and red pepper flakes. I had no problem at all getting the glaze to stick. I wonder if those who had the problem of the glaze sliding off perhaps did not let the sauce reduce enough; mine was quite thick. I also made mine with chicken breasts and leg pieces. One person who had it said it was the "best dinner" he's ever had--that good, eh? It was good. We're going to try it again for Easter--same thing, with just the bit of ginger (and I mean a tiny bit) and pepper flakes. One change I do want to make: I'll make my own jam this time, because the Smuckers I bought has--gasp--high fructose corn syrup, which is a disgusting and horribly unhealthy sugar alternative (and my family is cutting out of our diets completely--just ddin't read this label before hand and believed Smuckers about the "all natural" jam--how do they get away with it!? We had this with brown basmati rice and the green beans and roasted red onions from this site. Very good, elegant dinner. Oh--I didn't cook my bacon ahead of time either--based on advice here, and was glad I did it like that. The bacon was perfectly cooked. We liked this very much.

This was excellent on a late summer's night with rose prosecco and a roasted ratatouille. I bought the smallest hens I could find, did not split them, and served them as (very generous) single portions. The sauce is an excellent compliment to the sweetness and tenderness of the hen meat, and the bacon adds a welcome smoky richness.

Great. I added ginger and doubled the sauce.

made this recipe with thin boneless skinless chicken breasts and wrapped the bacon without cooking it first and did them on the grill - they turned out teriffic! You can try thick cut bacon if you use regular size chicken breasts.

I have made these three times, twice for just my husband and I and recently for three of us. I use only two hens but find I still need to make the entire recipe of sauce. I have made these with the bacon and without. Sounds like from other reviews like they would still work without completely cooking the bacon. This summer we are going to try theseon the grill. I think the sauce tastes great and ususally use a little more raspberry jelly.

I didn't use the bacon but just basted with the glaze. I've made these three or four times as everyone finds them absolutely delicious and I'm making them again tonight for my seder.

Not especially of bacon-wrapped meats, but this was lovely. Husband declared it the best cornish hen he'd ever had.

I really liked this recipe and thought hens looked as if you spent a lot of time on them. The only thing I did differently is that I did not cook bacon first I put uncooked bacon on hens before putting in oven. Will make again.

This was an OK recipe - easy to make. I've had better bacon wrapped game hens before. The sauce was bland.

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews I decided to cook the hens at 400 degrees and NOT pre-cook the bacon. They were done in 40 minutes and the bacon was perfect. I made sure I reduced the glaze and let it cool sufficiently before using so I didn't have the same problems with it as others did. I did notice that the raspberry flavor was alittle lacking, but I will make this again-maybe use more glaze.

We also had trouble with this recipe. The minute i took it out of the oven, I knew what I, and probably others who wrote in a review, had done wrong. The glzae did not stay on my hens either and ran into the pan and mixed with the hen juices to end up with a thin sauce. So here are the mistakes i made: 1) I was running late so I did not boil down the glaze completely, 2) I did not cool the glaze enough before putting on the hens so it reached the melting point and came off the hens after just a little while in the oven, 3) I used a deep baking pan instead of a shallow roasting pan so the hens baked rather than roasted and the skin and glaze did not crisp., 4) my pan was too small and the hens were crowded in, not leaving room for heat to circulate. Easy to figure out after the fact. The hens were very juice and tasty anyway but I will try this again and do it correctly. The orzo was great especially with a few fresh taspberries thrown in.

This was great. The hens were very juicy and the flavors were just what I wanted. Definetly a winner.

This dish was impressive when served to my guests while being deceptively easy. It was also delicious. I used quail instead of cornish hens (they were on sale at my market) and it worked perfectly - just cut back the roasting time. Served it with a potato galette seasoned with rosemary that complimented it nicely. And bordeau is a must! PS I agree the pre.cooking the bacon is not needed.

Made this for my kids yesteray. I kept hens whole, except for one. Got lazy and didn't halve the rest. Since i was afraid the bacon would overcook, I put the hens in for 15 mins. @ 450, cause the glaze didn't reduce fast enough. Took them out. To the glaze I added minced ginger. To the hens I added garlic and tarragon. I glazed them, wrapped in bacon, cooked an additional 15 mins. @ 450, then dropped to 375, maybe 20 mins. Bacon was very cooked, but edible. I don't think I would precook bacon again. Had left over, so I gave to my neighbors. They loved it, even reheated. Very juicy and moist

Rating: 3
A quick and easy game hen recipe. I would try not pre-cooking the bacon at all next time as only the part tucked under was edible, the rest was burnt to a crisp, but flavored the hen nicely. Agree the high temp is important to keep the meat nice and juicy especially when the hens are halved. Next time I may try them whole on the rotisserie which is our old stand by for juicy, succulent game hens with no pans to clean!

Rating: 1
I was not impressed. I read the other negative feedback and I totally agree. I added some fresh raspberries and also a touch of liquid smoke but still no overall improvement in the sauce or outcome. Watery and little flavor - not a recipe worth making again. Plain lemon and rosemary would have been better on the hens than this.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed with this - the picture looked delicious. The juices from the hens made the sauce thin and watery, and the bacon burned black and was inedible. Maybe I overcrowded the pan, maybe I didn't watch the temp closely enough. I may try again.

Rating: 4
Thought this was great. Everyone raved about it. Do not think you should lower the temperature - 450 kept the meat juicy expecially if using game hens. They were done in 30 minutes and definately not burned. I will make extra glaze when making again - it was just delicious. I agree with foil to line. It would make cleanup easier.

Rating: 4
I don't understand the poor reviews of this recipe. I loved it for it was both easy to make and flavorful. I did add a touch of fresh rosemary to the glaze. Roasted in a corningware dish, and the clean-up was easy as pie. No need for foil lined pans. Will make this again, perhaps for company.

Rating: 3
I was happy with the flavor of the hens but not certain I would use the sauce again. I did however modify the use of the bacon. Instead of cooking as per recipe, I loosened the skin of the hen and slid the bacon underneath. This makes for a smokey flavor and moist meat. Prosciutto also works well this way.

Rating: 2
Despite the mixed reviews, I've wanted to make this for a while. It really sounds good. It was certainly easy enough (I just microwaved the bacon in some paper towels for a couple of minutes to soften--one less pan to wash!), but the flavor of the glaze/bacon just didn't seem to permeate the meat very well. My husband says it was the best cornish hen he'd ever had, but he's really not that big a fan of them! I might try it again, and reduce the glaze slightly less, and then marinate in that overnight. There's potential here, but it's not quite right as written. I do agree with the high temp. roasting, however, it produces great poultry results.

Aside from the fact that it looked nothing like the picture, I found the taste a little lacking as well. This was ok, but not worth trying again.

Agree with cook using 350 oven Temp. (45 - 55 Min.) & cook using foil to line pan. All else as recipe directed. Will reserve (before using tool back & forth to baste poultry) some glaze next time to use on completion. Found half of a hen adequate for each of us seniors, especially with salad & bread. Health nuts can toss bacon & hen skin.

I used chicken breasts to make this dish. It was great! I wrapped each of the breasts with 3 bacon strips and other than that stuck with the recipe

The glaze was easy to make, but kept falling off during basting and ended up at the bottom of the baking dish. I substituted chicken breasts for the game hens and it came out fine. A good recipe, but not a great one.

Great recipe. I also used the applewood bacon, but I used a whole cornish hen instead of cutting them in half. Just increase the cooking time. Bacon turns dark do to the glaze but has an excellent flavor.

I made this for friends the other night and everyone loved it-i used applewood smoked bacon instead of regular bacon and cut the srips in half using two cut stips per half hen-this gave the dish alot of flavor.

I absolutely LOVE cornish hens, and this recipe was great. The hens were tender and tasty. Yes, they are a little trouble to eat, but the flavor is worth it! (That's just how cornish hens are).

My family liked the glaze and the bacon, but it did not flavor the hens very well. Also, cornish hens are a lot of work either with or without eating utensils. Not enough meat for the effort. I know I won't make this again.

We liked the flavor of this, but I would use chicken breast next time or a chicken leg. Cornish game hens are just a little small and a bit of work for your diners.

Be sure to line your baking pan with heavy foil, or you will have a horrific clean-up job. If I make this again, I will cook it in a moderate oven, not a hot oven. The glaze ran off the hens and burned in the bottom of the pan. The bacon got nearly black, although it still tasted okay.

This is my first time to rate a recipe - thought this was great! Based on the last reviewer's thoughts, I did add about 3/4 of a chipotle pepper as well as some frozen raspberries I had in the freezer - gave the glaze a little more zing... (Also, used chicken breasts as no one else in the house likes small hens other than me...)

Easy to make, but a little boring. Everybody loved the bacon, but we thought the glaze lacked oomph. Maybe some chipotle chiles would make it more interesting.

This was very yummy.. I followed the recipe to the letter only I halved it. I would definately make this again. My advice: when you cut the glaze in half it tends to set up rather quickly!.. I had to rewarm mine to loosen it up, but with no negative results.

This dish was easy to make and really excellent. I used beef fry instead of bacon, and served it with a wild and long grain rice pilaf with toasted pecans. Guests raved. A simple yet impressive dish.
