Fun recipe for a traditional holiday side. I used popover pans rather than a larger pan, cooking time was slightly reduced but the flavors were great!

I was trying to make a quick bread to go along with soup and remembered this. It's great, even with modifications that should've made it bland & boring. I used 2% milk, skipped the bacon and sage and used about a Tbs. of bacon grease and about 3 Tbs. of butter. I used a slightly rounded tsp. of kosher salt and followed the rest of the directions (I know, what's the point w/o the bacon, right?). A happy byproduct? It was fun for all of us to marvel at how HUGELY it raised in the oven -- like a science experiment! :-) It was delicious, super easy and so quick; there is NO reason to not become a hero in your family's eyes by making this.

Delicious! Took a few minutes longer than it said to get all the way done, but a perfect addition to our Christmas Day standing rib roast.

I never had Yoorkshire pudding before. I really like this one and was very easy to follow the recipe. I like the sage and came out very crispy and puffy. Good.

This recipe is absolutely a family favorite!! No need to divide the sage - use any herbs you'd like - and toss everything in all together! It comes out absolutely gorgeous (tall and tasty)!

I loved the flavor of this dish. Also, I made it with skim milk, and it turned out just fine. However, I found the bacon fat made it too heavy for a traditional Yorkshire pudding, even though the flavor it imparted was excellent. I'm not sure how to fix this--maybe use butter in place of the bacon fat, and add just a little bit of bacon fat for taste. Also, the sage was a bit overpowering; I'll probably halve it next time I make it.

This recipe was easy to make. But I was slightly disappointed because I expected to be astounded by how delicious the pudding would be...I thought that it was good, but not fantastic. Chiefly, the bacon is slightly distracting--in flavour and texture. Next time, I would cut the bacon in smaller pieces. And I wouldn't make this recipe with roast beef, but roast chicken. Also, I wouldn't bother reserving some of the sage and bacon to crumble on top. Just dump it all in to cook! I also used 2% milk and the recipe was still good. And for salt-aholics like me, I would suggest adding a rounded teaspoon of salt if the bacon you use is not that salty.

This was such a hit with my family that I had to make a double recipe to go with the left overs.

What did I do wrong? Mine was very FLAT...was more like a savory fried dough than a poofy yorkshire pudding. It was such a simple, straightforward recipe I can't imagine what I could have done incorrectly. I loved the flavor anyway, and it was great with a pot roast I made...we just put the meat on top of the flat crispy YP and enjoyed it that way.

Have never been a huge fan of Yorkshire Pudding, but this was excellent and super-easy to make! Everything is better with bacon, isn't it?

Wow- we had our doubts when we made this dish but it was amazing! Full of flavor and an interesting addition to any meal. You could even use it for breakfast. A big hit at our table for New Years Eve!

Made exactly to recipe except used muffin tin instead of larger dish. Came out wonderfully puffy and brown and looked lovely on the plate. Only thing I'll do different next time is add more chopped sage in with the batter and maybe a little black pepper as well.

Yum! This is the best yorkshire pudding I've ever had. The bacon and sage gave it a nice boost of flavor. I'll never make plain yorkshire pudding again.

This is the best Yorkshire pudding I have ever made. Comes out beautifully golden brown and puffy. The bacon gives it a great flavor. Will definitely make it again.
