I don't know anything about "authentic" guacamole, but I just prefer avocado with lime juice, garlic, salt, and maybe some cilantro.

So many recipes put too much stuff in the guacamol--they turn it into a barbarion form of salsa. I like this recipe because it brings out the natural taste of the avocado. I add the juice of one lime and 1 teaspoon finely minced, rinsed and dried white onion. Then it's good to go.

This recipe may be "authentic," but it certainly should be entitled a "boring version" of an old, respected,and most favored recipe, if one can ever find a boring avacado application. There are many varientions that have greater appeal. The avacado is, of and by itself, that magnificent, marvelous creation that is both healthful, and delicious. In addition, it makes one feel indulent, no matter how it is eaten. Incidently, it is also a great additive in various health and beauty products.

Avacado, or as it is called where my wife is from, Palta is best when kept simple. The fruit, finely diced onion,a little chile, a tiny bit of tomato and a little squeze of limon. To my friends that have differing opinions I must remind you that the one of the most interesting aspects of foods from Latin America are the variations from different countries, regions and homes. The most wonderful aspect of this is is falling in love with a dish and then finding variation that is just as good, just different.

Guacamole is completely dependent on the quality of the avocado. It must stay on the tree until almost ripe and then ripen fully (avocados will increase in sweetness and fat content as they ripen, unlike other fruits) on your counter. Mexican avocados are quite wonderful, but well chosen American ones are also. Cilantro is a must, but is to taste. Chiles are also. Chiles now seem to have no scoville rating. More chiles might have to be added, but oxmoronically some chiles now have a "raw" vegetal taste that is off-putting. It is best to buy a variety of chiles unless you know your source. Tomato is also required. As is onion. But, the primary flavor is the avocado. It is best to make this and serve immediately. Pits and plastic wrap do not help with oxidation. Lime will. But then you are making a different version of guacamole. In Guatamala (transplanted to LA) one would add lots of lime and toasted Mexican oregano. What is nice about this recipe is that is true to the ingredients. Garlic, water, other sauces are quite disgusting. If you want that then go to your local chain restaurant and eat the 7-layer dip. Or maybe 7-Eleven and get some taquitos. Choose your fruits carefully and it will be a wonderful taste.

Guacamole is, basically, mashed aguacates. You can add, as in almost every recipe, whatever you like or dismiss what you dislike. Aguacate, like chocolate, tomate, are originally from Mexico. In Mexico the most common recipe for Guacamole has avocados, chopped onions, Serrano chiles, and, always, fresh coriander leaves. Some people put some lime drops to it to avoid it getting dark to soon(oxidization from the air). This can be fairly avoided if you put the avocado pits to the guacamole and seal the container with plastic wrap. Something that you never see in guacamole in Mexico is cream. To our dear friend from Guatemala, I would like to point out, that, to start with, there is no avocados in your Country. What you call aguacate is the same fruit that we have in the Mayan part of Mexico, which we call "pagüa" and is a sweet, blunt, unpleasant consistency, large, yellowish fruit.

If this is authentic Mexican guacamol, so what? I can offer you a better recipe of Guatemalan authentic guacamol. Why waist your time with this tasteless dish. I fell sorry for you guys who get so excited at anything that is mexican while turning your back to better recipes from other parts of latin America. Where can I send my recipe for guacamol?

Well I, personally, have always added some mayonaise to it. It gives it a more creamy taste and appeal. But it has to be mayo, no substitutes, like miraclewhip. Well, my Mexican family seems to love it!

add chopped onion,cilantro and lime juice and now we are talking about real guac (por lo menos en Guerrero,Mex) Buen provecho!

The TRUE secret to authentic guacamole is the creamy, rich avocados found only in Mexico. There is nothing to compare in the U.S., unfortunately.

I agree with the cook from San Francisco. Good guacamole is purely a matter of taste, so even though this authentic recipe is vastly different from my "gringa" recipe, it appeals to me nonetheless. I personally add grated onion, lime juice, salt, cayenne, a dollop of sour cream, and cumin to my guac. When people can deal with minced cilantro, I add that as well. And when people want it polluted with tomatoes, I'll throw those in. But the basic recipe remains the same. Happy eating!

Making the best Guac is like making the best pizza - it's all good but personal taste will determine greatness. In the end guac is about avocados. If they're fresh and flavorful, all the preferences shown by readers will come out well. ...As long as you don't overwhelm the flavor of the avocado. All that said, this is a great recipe for the purist with the only risk being controlling the peppers' heat. Eat it right away - no citric acid means a brown bowl develops faster.

Hey everyone. You don't need to add all of that extra stuff. Just enjoy it as it is meant to be eaten in this recipe. I am a chef from Canada with many South American friends and I have discussed this with them in great detail. And with everything else there is no actual known/proven origin of the dish. So the way you prepare it,is the way you prepare it. Thanks happy eating

I just returned from vaca. in Acapulco and, although I have not tried this particular recipe, I read over the ingredients and comments from other reviewers. Guacamole is one of the best treats in MX. I must say that, in all of my experiences in many different restaurants, it was coarsely prepared, but creamy, and usually contained small amounts of finely diced onion, finely chopped tomato, minced jalapeno, garlic and lime juice. When served as an appetizer along with their fresh but simple tomato salsa (chopped tomatoes, chopped cilantro, diced jalapeno peppers, diced onion)and a basket of warm, freshly prepared tortilla chips, you'd think you died and went to heaven!...especially if washed down with a GOOD Marguerita!!

I agree with the others that this would be better with lime juice, onion, garlic, and tomatoes. If you seed the tomatoes well and let them drain a while, they don't make the guacamole watery. I think they are more for looks than flavor. I just add a few on top for the contrast of red and green. This is also very good if you use garlic that you roast on the grill.

Unveiled Myths of Guacamole! Guacamole must include lemon juice, onion, red tomatoes, serrano chiles and cilantro, and of course salt and pepper. That's the basic recipe. Ingredients are cut in small pieces, even chopped, but NOT smashed. And then gently mixed. Serves with chicharron (of course kosher can skip this suggestion) and fresh cheese, like panela or ranch styles, but never feta nor any goat milk cheese. Of course there is also the poor people recipe, of an avocado sauce, also called guacamole, which has green tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic and chile. All blended with some water to produce a thick sauce. This sauce is used to serve tacos. For the first recipe for those who said that so much ingredients could not let you enjoy the avocado flavor, eat only the avocado so you can taste it! Lemon juice is used not only to add flavor, but to prevent avocado to turn black, and you may (and should) also leave some avocado seeds on the serving bowl to preserve freshness, but try always to mix all ingredients at the very last minute, although you can have them cut ahead, except for the avocado. And for better results try the Michoacan region avocados (yes, we export them!)which are flavorful fruits. To avoid a peculiar unpleasant tomatoes flavor use fresh ones, and take the seed off. Do not use the over maduration period ones, but firm red ones. Cummin is used for pork recipes, not for all Mexican and Cuban recipes, so try not to overuse including it in all recipes. Don't miss the next unveiled myths of... !

okay--i agree with the others. guac MUST have lime juice, garlic, and onions. just add that to the recipe and it will be wonderful!

EAsy fellas!!!! Some people are purists, some like more complex flavors. But to be honest, guac SHOULD NEVER have TOMATOES!! It waters it down too much and doesn't add flavor to speak of. By the way, its not feta that goes on the guacamole in Mexico. I beleive it's cotija.

AUTHENTIC???? Where??? On Mars??? The Houston guy is right, this "recipe" sucks. Where are the tomatoes??? Guacamole without lime juice?? Why even bother?? Might as well just eat the avacado right off the pit. Take it from Texans....we know guacamole (except for the Feta cheese thing.......I have no idea where the heck that came from). Here's another "great" recipe for you guys. Take a bowl, pour cereal and milk in it. True AUTHENTIC American food, no?

Now I know why my past attempts at guacamole were such failures -- I added so many ingredients I could hardly taste the avocado! Aside from adding some finely chopped white onion, this recipe is perfect. Definitely a keeper!

I'd rate this recipe as a zero if that were an option. How can you make guacamole without the basic ingredient of fresh lime juice? NOT even worth trying. Instead, select a minimum of 2 black avacados, ripe. Peel, seed and chunk into a medium-sized bowl. Mash with a fork, leaving chuncky. Add LOTS of freshly squeezed lime juice, diced red onion, fresh garlic, cumin, fresh black pepper, chiles and/or jalepenos, diced tomatoes-seeded, chopped cilantro. Stir together. Top with crumbled feta cheese. chill. Dig in! Nothing tastes better - THIS is how they make guacamole in Mexico!

Really lovely - a very pure guacamole that's particularly good with unctuously ripe Hass avocados. Easy and delicious, especially if you're looking for something creamy and simple to serve alongside something fiery.

So easy. So very tasty. A key ingredient this recipe is missing is: One small, finely-diced white onion. This lends some texture, and white onions are a bit sharper in flavor than the sweet yellow/brown variety ... A nice contrast to the creamy avocado. Try a coarse-ground salt (I use sea salt), & add extra serranos for snap. This is a fantastic beginner's recipe ... you can't blow this one. (One drawback (I suppose) is that it doesn't keep well at all, so you'd better eat it ALL while its fresh!)

My aunt gave me her original recipe for guacamole. She used fresh lime juice, salt and pepper to taste, tabasco to taste and chopped scallions. Omitting any of the above makes for a bland version.
