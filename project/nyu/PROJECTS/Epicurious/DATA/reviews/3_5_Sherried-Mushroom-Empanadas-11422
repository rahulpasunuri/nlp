Fabulous. Followed recipe. I did a test run for a party and tried 1/2 the recipe in individual empanadas the second one as a tart. If you serve in the tart form, they need to be eaten with a fork. If you want finger foods, go with individual empanadas. I used a round cookie cutter.

I've made this 3 times now (twice with cooking clubs) and it continues to be a winner. Just a few comments: 1) 6 tablespoons of butter is excessive; 2) It doesn't work very well cutting these in circles and making individual empanadas; too much pastry and not enough filling; and 3) I serve this with a side of chive/sour cream. Otherwise, this is simple to make and very, very good.

These were delicious! I used one large onion and almost thought it would be too much but perfect! Although the mushrooms did take quite a while to reduce, they were quite simple to make I made 18 small empanadas using the puff pastry sheets rather than 2 large, there was quite a bit of leftover mixture.

These are delicious, but I found making the filling to be way more time consuming than I anticpated. It takes a very long time for the mushrooms to reduce so while it is really delicious... be sure to budget your time accordingly. Also, I did not do the puff pastry bit but rather, made individual empanadas with another type of dough, so I can't comment on how that part of the recipe fares.

We've served these many, many times and unfortunately have never had any leftovers. I have found that sometimes I really need to add a lot more salt than I would expect (since the prosciutto lends such saltiness) but sampling it as it is cooking makes it easy and the extra salt really enhances the flavors. Making small empanadas can be time-consuming, but they make for very attractive hors d'oevres when served that way. Regardless of the presentation, these are delicious.

I had a friend who HATES mushrooms beg me to make more of these. I omitted the ham, and wrapped the filling in wonton wrappers, which I then fried. It FLEW off the plates and was a huge hit at our Halloween party.

Always a hit. I use spicy salami (good quality). I make them in miniture with pie crust & biscuit cutters, stuffed and folded over. The perfect finger food.

Made to rave reviews at a party. Made them up the week before, then just popped them in the freezer covered in Saran Wrap. Took them out before the party, and they came out heavenly. Not a crumb left.

I've made these several times now and never have any left over. I've used black forest ham and bacon. They are savory and truly delicious.

I have made this (with great success) about a dozen times in the past 3-4 years. I have used the filling in phyllo cups, made it "as is", and made individual empenadas. I add some hot red pepper flakes, or cayenne. I also add some freshly grated nutmeg. The first time I made it I thought the filling was a bit "wet" so now I also add about 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. This recipe is really a keeper!

I made individual empanadas for a cocktail party. Not difficult and they look pretty, but the flavor is very plain. If you want something simple and mushroomy, this is fine, but it is nothing special.

It went over very well at my tapas party....did take a bit of time but I made individual empanadas so I think if made as directed would save a lot of time. I will try it that way next time.....the filling is really good! I preferred it immensely to the butternut and mushroom empanadas on this site which I have also made....

This took a lot of effort, but it was worth it! I think the key to this is making sure to use a good quality pastry sheet. The Pepperidge Farm one worked really well where as the other one I used (can't recall the name) was very dry and didn't puff up as well. This was a big hit at my tapas holiday party.

This was a big hit at our wine tasting party. However, it is very time consuming. I made individual empanadas. Take extra time pressing the edges together with a fork dipped in egg to seal each empanada tightly. I made them earlier in the day, refrigerated and then reheated at 375 for 8 minutes.

This was really disappointing for me. Based on the reviews I read, I was expecting something fantastic. But it was not at all worth the time it took to make. The filling wasn't as impressive as people said it was. If anything, I think individual empanadas would have been better.

These truly are worth the hours and hours it took to make them. I considered leaving out the ham because I never touch the stuff but I'm so glad I didn't because it added a beauteous smokey, Spanish flavor. I just had a sample and left the rest for my guests who gobbled up every last bite.

This was very good. The recipe is easy to follow but there is a fair amount of chopping to do so it does take some time. Be warned - take the frozen puff pastry dough out of the freezer at least 2 hrs before you need to use it. I followed the instructions on the package for thawing (30 minutes) and the dough was still very frozen. I had to improvise and thaw it in the microwave and then it was too doughy. Overall though, the recipe is outstanding and it looks very pretty.

Made these as individual turnovers and even though I rolled the puff pastry as thin as I could, I think that the pastry overwhelmed the filling. I'm guessing that this recipe is much better if you follow the directions and serve slices of one large empanada. Filling was really good.

I chose to make these as individual turnovers and served them at room temp. They were quite a hit. Get 2 packages of puff pastry for individual turnovers.

I am a real loser at using puff pastry, but I managed to roll up the filling in a cigar shape and bake them like that. The filling was good, maybe even could have been a little spicer for me, but my guests like it.

i made this for my boyfriend as part of a tapas-themed dinner i whipped up for his birthday. he picked this creation as, hands down, his favorite. this recipe is incredibly easy to prepare ahead of time. i made the filling the night before so the only real work left for the next day was assembling the pastry. a breeze of a recipe with tasty results!

Made this for a tapas party for 10 and it was a hit. I made the filling the night before and assembled the empanadas the day of the party. Baked ahead and reheated for 7 or 8 minutes when guests arrived. Not too difficult to make, either. I followed the recipe except that being vegetarian I omitted the ham and put in a few extra mushrooms. Didn't seem as if it was missing a thing. Leftovers (the couple scraps there were!) were great reheated the next day. I sliced one as directed but it was awkward to handle. The other, I cut lengthwise, then into squares. Worked better that way.

I made this for our Super Bowl party and it was wonderful! We reheated the leftovers the next day and it was still yummy. I will surely make this again.

I prepared the empanadas a few days ahead and froze them. I baked them for roughly the same cooking time the day of the party, let them cool, and then sliced them. The slices wind up being fairly large for a cocktail party - next time will make individual hors d'oeuvres.

Took a little while but worth the extra effort. I served it at a wine and cheese party and there was none left.

I made it as a strudel and served slices plated as a starter (chopped roasted red pepper garnish) with a Spanish cava. - great set up for a special meal. Making it for vegetarians I didn't use the ham but it was plenty rich and didn't need extra salt.

Made this for a bridal shower which was catered by a well known Spanish restaurant - everyone thought it came from them and there was not a morsel left. I would make it again and again

start to finish - it takes awhile to prepare, but its worth it. I left out the ham to make them vegetarian (not vegan), they were great. This is great to take to someone else's house it travels well if you leave it on the baking sheet. Note: Cream Sherry is Harvey's Bristol Cream.

Lots of work but worth the effort for a special occasion. The next day I had leftover filling and served it in a nice bowl with crackers and bread on the side.

I made this for a tapas party and it got great reviews. Takes a little time, but well worth it. I used a mix of different types of mushrooms for variety and added a little more seasoning.

I amde the recipe exactly the way it is presented. I thought it was bland and too mushy. I think I would have preferred more dough taste. I will make it again but use more ham, garlic, and other seasonings.

Excellent. All my guests wanted the recipe. I had southern cured ham on hand, so I used it.

Good choice for a party. Nothing was lost by making the day before and then just reheating. Even though not as attractive once they are cut compared to making individual empanadas, I agree with an earlier reviewer that making individual empanadas distracts from the taste of the filling because there is too much dough. I find that when making individual hors d'oeuvres using puff pastry or phyllo dough, they don't go as quickly, and I suspect it is because of the too much dough aspect.

Wonderful addition to my 40th birthday tapas party. I catered my birthday party having many special delicious finger foods. (Recipe Search- Curried Scallop Cakes... WOW!) This recipe was a great addition. I was running out of time preparing the food for this party and wrapped the mushroom filling in dumpling wrappers that I purchased at an oriental market. I realize that it tranforms this recipe from a traditional empanada dough,but it was well worth the time saving tip! I baked the half mooned treat and wowed my guests.

I was cooking for a crowd, so made 1 1/2 recipes into three logs and froze them a week ahead of time. I really liked the taste of the sherried mushrooms (I couldn't find the serrano ham so subbed proscuitto). My guests ate them, too.

As another reviewer suggested, I made these in individual pieces using a biscuit cutter, filling and folding. A reminder with this method - watch the cook time as it is less. But, I cannot recommend making making the individual pieces. So much less of the wonderful filling is tasted as this becomes more about the puff pastry than the mushrooms. Serving with sour cream was a great idea!

So easy and so impressive! I used a biscuit cutter to make little rounds and folded them over for tiny individual snacks. I've also made long strips, baked, then sliced at the table for a more elegant presentation...will make it again for my family's Christmas dinner appetizer buffet. Say "Yummers!"

This recipe is fantastic. I would cut down on the butter next time; other than that, it's superb.

I made the filling exactly as described above, however, I used ready-made pastry squares in order to make individual triagles. I brushed the tops with egg-whites and then baked them in the oven. I served these as an appetizer with sour cream on the side. My guest went crazy over these empanadas!! They were definitely the hit of the party.
