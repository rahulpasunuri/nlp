I was so excited about making this dish, and found it to be so ho-hum! I had to add some Tabasco to liven it up a bit, and a decent amount of lemon juice, too. But several of my guests really liked it...however, my house--my menu (ha ha!), and I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was an excellent and unusual recipe. I did find it a little flat, so I added a half lemon which brightened the spread up a lot. A nice change from the typical cream cheese spread.

All I have to say is that this is a delicious recipe.

This is a delicious and unusual spread! A little goes a long way though - I served this on individual bruscettas at my last cocktail party with chopped roma tomatoes and everyone loved them!

Is this a spread to put on bread or do you serve this as an acomploment to your meats, in your main course?? Tony
