Needing a late-night dessert but limited by having few ingredients, I needed a recipe that included cashews, white chocolate chips, no brown sugar, and no more than 1/4 cup butter. I quartered the recipe, added a few extra chips and nuts, freshly grated the nutmeg, and was surprised to find tasty 4-star cookies that I'll definitely make again. We were only able to save 4 for breakfast. Also, no need to chill the dough. Don't let the 2-star rating fool you!

I made this recipe but substituted brown sugar for the molasses and it turned out fantastic. We also used a gourmet white chocolate and 1 cup instead, which made it much tastier.

Great cookies I loved them

There wasn't much flavor to these cookies. May be better with toasted mixed nuts (minus peanuts) as the cashews didn't add much flavor. A good choice for a holiday cookie tray.

I made this recipe because I happened to have white chocolate chips and cashews in the house. I was really dissappointed. They were dry and almost flavorless. And the batter was really hard to mix!

The cookies had a cakelike texture with a strange flavor due to the addition of molasses. I wound up throwing the whole batch away. The flavor would be greatly improved if both white and chocolate chips were used in addition to the cashews but instead of molasses, a simple cookie batter could be used with the addition of honey.

I really like the molassas flavor in it, but the texture is dry and cake-like. I prefer that half-baked texture. I substituted macademia nuts too, which was tasty. I would have like to try hazlenuts, though.
