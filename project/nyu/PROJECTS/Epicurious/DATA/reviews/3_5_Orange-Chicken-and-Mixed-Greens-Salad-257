I agree with the other reviewers...what do you do with the reduced marinade? We just basted the chicken with it, but because it is reduced I think the chicken is supposed to be served on its own with the reduction, and the salad is a side. We, instead, cut the chicken into bite size slices and served it with the salad. The flavor was good, not great (but I did marinate for only 6 hours). If you are looking for a quicker marinade I suggest adding a little splash of tequila. As we ate this dish I thought it could use a contrast to all the orange flavor, so maybe a touch of cayenne or chipotle powder or even some sliced pickled jalapenos in the marinade. All in all this was an okay dish, nothing spectacular, not enough flavor to serve to company. I might make it again with some heat.

What happens to the reduced marinade? Couldn't find the answer in the recipe but added it to the dressing... Think it would be better with nuts or crunch of some kind-somewhat sweet but yet very garlicky

To the cook who said the chicken caught fire on the grill, you might try using corn syrup instead of honey. It's far less likely to blacken or burn, and I find you don't lose anything taste-wise.

Boring. The chicken on its own in the marinade was fine and very tender, but nothing spectacular. All the rest of it was too much work for an unimpressive result. I was disappointed.

This got rave reviews. It looks beautiful and it's delicious. And it's quick. Especially if you put the chicken in the marinade the night before, there's not much left to do to get it on the table. I peeled my oranges with a knife which exposes the nice bright orange color, then sliced cross-wise into discs. This was a lot less work than cutting away the membrane of each individual section. There was a bit too much dressing for my taste, so you may want to use half, then toss, then see if you need more. I also cut the chicken breasts cross-wise into quarter inch slices, which makes it easier for people to serve themselves the amount they want rather than everyone taking a whole breast. It also makes it easier to eat since you could cut the sections with a fork. Fork and knife dishes are tricky at informal events where people might be standing up or eating with plates in their laps. I love the idea of adding almonds and will do that next time. I can see making this again and again.

This was a very nice dish for a large cookout we had. Everyone enjoyed it. I will be making it again for my husband's birthday get together. It looks very nice on the platter. I am making the green bean and fingerling potato salad to go with it, as I did the first time. The greens and dressing are already part of the chicken recipe. I'm making the old fashioned chocolate cake for his birthday cake/desert.

My husband burnt the chicken (and it dried out), and he claimed the marinade caused it to catch fire. My husband and son didn't like it much. Not bad, but not worth the effort - so I won't make it again.

Loved this! Apart from the salad, it's an excellent and healthy orange chicken marinade. Will definitely be keeping this on standby.

Wow! I intended to grill the chicken, but steady rain forced a change in plans. Broiled instead. Still, a beautiful presentation with yellow and orange peppers, and the orange sections and greens. I didn't find cutting up the oranges to be such a hassle. Much better than canned mandarins, I think. This dish got wows all around at my dinner party.

Sounds like a silly question, but what is ultimately done with the chicken. Does it simply get sliced and placed on top of the salad? Do you remove the skin? Thanks.

This was fabulous and presents beautifully. I made it twice in a week using chicken drumettes the second time around. I also blanched asparagus to add to the salad. We had leftover breasts so I sliced it up and for a salad to take to work the next day, packing the dressing separately. My reduced marinade was chunky so I didn't use being the chicken was already flavorful. I did take one chef's advice here and used rice wine vinegar. I love its taste in dressings...

I've been preparing this recipe for happy, grateful people since it was first published. Just came back to print another copy. For a nice alternative, marinate jumbo shrimp instead (for 15 minutes), skewer and grill. (Note to TX, the reduced marinade gets drizzled over the sliced chicken.)

What do you do with the reduced marinade? Is this added to the dressing? So many reviews and no one mentioned this, what am I missing?

Great new chicken dish! Easy to make. Used mandarin oranges and rice wine vinegar. Will try it again with pork tenderloin.

I made this for a baby shower and my guests loved it. It is quite sweet so you might want to balance it with a savory herb bread. I also used canned mandarin oranges to save time.

I have made this recipe several times - love it, love it! And so does everyone else. I lost the recipe about 2 years ago! I am so happy to find it on the website

We liked this. I used green, red and yellow peppers plus some fresh mandarine oranges - easier to prepare than fussing with oranges; but I did squeeze fresh orange juice. Instead of the white-wine vinegar I used one of the new citrus vinegars. And, I cut up the chicken breasts and removed the skin when I marinated them. Next time, I will add some finely minced hot pepper. Quick and easy dish. Yum.

Delicious and easy. The dressing was tangy and the marinade was sweet and fragrant with the taste of oranges.

I agree with previous review. This was very good, but as my husband said, "It's the kind of recipe that says 1 serving of it is enough." I guess you just need to serve it in the right setting (showers, luncheon, no big hungry men).

This was very nice, but not the excitement I expected from all the previous raves. I like ROASTED CHICKEN, BELL PEPPER AND ONION SALAD better. Perhaps because I really like rosemary.

Very nice flavor. Would be even better if it had some toasted pecans in it. Overall a nice light summer salad.

This recipe does provide a pretty presentation. I sprinkled the salad with edible flowers, and garnished the chicken with sliced oranges and sprinkled with fresh thyme.

I've made the chicken from this dish several times. It is a very easy dinner choice for a summer weekday. Just marinate the chicken before work, and put the chicken on the grill when you come home.
