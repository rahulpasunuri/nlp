great - used milk/water. add slowly to feel out the consistency you want. great way to use up cottage cheese.

What, only one review? This is good with just a salad. I used lettuce & spinach. Instead of buttermilk & water, I substituted milk & being a bleu cheese fan, I crumbled more on it after. Yum!

Delicious dressing - doesn't taste low fat at all. I used chive cottage cheese for a little more flavor, and also added some garlic. My husband loves bleu cheese and I love fruit in salads, so this was a perfect combination!
