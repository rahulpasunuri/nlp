Exquisite flavors that are enhanced by the leeks and mushrooms. I used an array of wild mushrooms that worked well to give it more of a "forest" flavor. Probably used too much cheese as it was a bit greasy after all was said and done. A step up from the normal au gratin.

Made this for a family lunch today, and palates of all types enjoyed it. It's rich--I wouldn't make it a regular staple, but it's definitely a solid recipe, good for company. I made it by the book, except used a little less EVOO and heavy whipping cream.

We made this for Christmas dinner with Beef Tenderloin and it was amazing. Great presentation and taste. And compared to other potato gratin recipes, it as not difficult. Highly recommend.

Excellent! I made this the day before, cooking it completely, then rewarming while the roast rested. Perfect.

I have made this recipe for the last two thanksgivings... to say it was a hit would be modest. last year I made an extra half batch, made more of the leek/mushroom mixture, and layered it like lasagna (mix,cheese,potatoes... so on). That worked really well. I'll be making it again

Excellent! My supermarket doesn't stock good mushrooms, so I used baby bella and button, and they were fine. They also only had baby yukon gold potatoes, which worked perfectly. The cream barely covered the potatoes to parboil, so keep an eye on the cooking so they don't burn. I added more cheese than the recipe called for as well. The dish is a little labor intensive because of the chopping, but overall not difficult at all, and a beginner cook really could shine serving this! Definite WIN.

Delicious! I can't possibly show up for Thanksgiving or Christmas without this dish in tow.

after reading some of the reviews, i amped up both the salt and pepper and used extra cheese. i also added about 1 teaspoon of paprika to the milk mixture before parboiling the potatoes. all in all, with the above "modifications", this dish went over very well on father's day! will definitely make it again. when i have a LOT of time on my hands. four forks!

This is a wonderful dish as in all cooking it is merely a road map you can add what floats your boat.. I added nutmeg and extra salt and pepper always taste as you prepare.I also thew in some Swiss and Muenster cheese in to the cream as it heated then I added the potatoes. It was a major hit!!.

Made this to the letter. Wasn't disappointed but not elated either. Lacked seasoning despite what felt like robust amounts of salt & pepper added on 2 different occasions during the cooking process. Also wasn't made clear in the recipe whether the thickened milk fats in the boiled potatoes were meant to be worked into he slices layered in the final trays for baking. I used half of that liquid on a lark. Were I to make it again. I'd probably include something intended to brighten it up it a bike, like crisp-tender chopped fennel or lemon zest, nutmeg or whatever anyone would like to suggest here.

Truly delicious. As others have said make sure to salt and pepper sufficiently. This was one of those dishes that reheated very nicely and actually tasted better 2 days later so next time I would make and fully cook it the day prior if I needed and just reheat in the oven.

exceptional, don't skimp on the salt and pepper! The par boiling of the potatoes is also critical. texture and taste is wonderful, fabulous special occasion dish

Modified this as I couldn't see using cream. So I cooked the sliced potatoes in organic chicken broth and followed the rest of the recipe, substituting fontina for the gruyere. Delicious! Will definitely make this again often.

My family is a little rough around the edges, so I was a little worried about feeding them vegetables and cheese they'd never heard of, but to my chagrin it was the most talked about dish at Christmas dinner. People couldn't stop raving about it!

almost forgot...added roasted garlic to the veggies. (3 heads of garlic cut in half, with a little salt and olive oil, wrapped in foil, 375 oven for 45 min).

I've made this recipe twice now, and it's dellicious. Not difficult, just a little work, but worth it. I ommited the mushrooms this time, and adde half onion to the leeks. with or without mushroom, it's always a hit. Recommend this to anyone who wants to impress.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point for one of the best potato dishes I've ever made! Instead of leeks and mushrooms, I caramelized shallots and garlic and layered that mixture with the potatoes (I used half and half since it's what I had but otherwise followed the method here). Added a little more cheese than called for and put a layer of it in with the shallots. I needed a bit more liquid than what is called for here. Silky, cheesy, delicious potatoes - will make again and again!

Oh my goodness, this was amazing! It will definitely be a go-to dish in the future. I changed a few things though, partly based on what I had available. When preparing the mushroom mixture, I added celery and a splash of balsamic and wine once the veggies were browned, as well as a handful of spinach to up the veggie factor. I didn't have milk or cream on hand, so I used coconut 'milk', the kind made to go over cereal which worked fine and made it feel much less like a guilty pleasure. I also used a combo of sweet potato and regular.

Meh - I like my mom's version with American cheese more than this. It was oily, and with all the cream very fatty. Won't be making again.

Does anyone know how well this freezes? I'm thinking of ading crunbled sausage and storing it in individual containers for quick lunches and dinners. Thank you!

This was delicious. Definitely company-worthy. I was slightly short on the mushrooms, but it didn't seem to matter. Leftovers also reheated well.

This is super easy and you can have so much variety with this... change the cheese up to Danish Blue or Gorgonzola, add smoked bacon or even some truffle oil as well. It's lovely!

Excellant fragrance with just the hint of garlic. Amiable texture with sweet potatoes that melted in my mouth. Reminiscent of a 1950's style homemade american meal. Just like mom used to make!

If I came across this as a side in a very fancy restaurant, I would likely exclaim "wow this is good" and rave about it to my friends. If I was served this all by itself as a light lunch at a friends house, I would sing his praises to the moon. However, in serving this with a cider brined pork chop, the whole meal became too heavy, too savoury and the potato left lots of leavings. My own fault. This really is good. I used smoked gruyere which was fine. Next time though, I'll look for regular gruyere and serve this with fish. It's far too expensive to waste in the wings.

I made it last night for my family. While the dish had a bit too much oil bubbling when it first came out, it was very tasty and filling. My children were at first glance wary of the mushrooms, but came around when it came time to taste. I'll be making this again for extended family soon.

Absolutely fantastic. I didn't cook too long on stove top . . . not enough liquid to cover potatoes but I don't think that impacted a thing. I used crimini and baby bella mushrooms. Just delicious and everyone raved. They were yummy leftover for breakfast the next morning too. I served with Herb Crusted Pork Tenderloin from this site (1998)

I made this Christmas Eve along with beef tender au poivre and a Caesar salad. It was fabulous, but really served more people than the recipe says. I doubled the recipe to serve 18 and had a lot left over. Does anyone know how well it will freeze? It would break my heart to throw any of it away. I also made it a day shead, keeping the potatoes separate from the leeks and mushrooms, and assembled it a couple of hours before dinner.

The family raved about this recipe. My father-in-law, who is an devout mushroom hater, had seconds! I doubled the recipe to feed many. To facilitate even cooking, I prepared the cream and potato mixture in two batches. Also, I added a bay leaf and fresh thyme sprigs to the cream mixture to add flavor. Then, I discarded the leaf and sprigs before putting the potatoes in my prepared dish. My family loves cheese, so some cheese was added to the mushroom layer as well as the top. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this dish for a Christmas gathering and it was a big hit. Guests loved it and wanted the recipe. Would definitely make it again.

I made this the last 2 weekends for large dinner parties, and LOVE it. I put a portion of 2% milk this last time, and it was still very yummy and rich. The second time, it came together very simply, and I completely assembled the dish the day before, and baked it the day of the party. Since the potatoes are basically cooked already in the cream, they didn't brown at all, and it was DELICIOUS!!

I was initially hesitant to make this dish because I was worried that it would be bland and that the mushrooms would make it watery. The reviews were so good that I finally decided to give it a try, though, and WOW - so glad I did! Really delicious, worthy of four stars. Made it for a dinner party and everyone raved and ate seconds (and thirds)! Try it - it's worth the effort.

This was the biggest hit of our Thanksgiving Dinner with people going back for seconds and even thirds of this dish. It is definitely a very rich dish and for that reason, I would probably only make it for a holiday dinner such as this one but I will be making it again. It was excellent.

Rating: 4
Terrific. I think this was the real star of our Thanksgiving yesterday. I didn't change anything except I added some Gruyere to the mushroom/leek layer and more on top than the recipe called for. Delicious and reheats beautifully. I will definitely add this to my regular repertoire, not just save it for holidays!

FANTASTIC!! I plan to try making a day ahead - keeping mushroom mixture and potato mixture separate and finishing the second day. It was truly wonderful. I used fresh chanterelles, hens of the woods, and oyster mushrooms.

I made this recipe one night because it was seasonal and sounded delicious. It was such a hit I was asked it make it again three nights later for the "boys wine and steak night". I increased the portions and not a drop was left. I've also experimented with adding similar cheese mixes with the gruyere (emmenthal, appenzeller, similar fondue mixes) with continued success! Great dish for entertaining.

This is very rich and hearty with a wonderful flavor! Made it just as written--very good. I also served the appetizer Baked Brie w/Mushrooms from this site. Both paired well with a hearty wine and steak au poivre.
