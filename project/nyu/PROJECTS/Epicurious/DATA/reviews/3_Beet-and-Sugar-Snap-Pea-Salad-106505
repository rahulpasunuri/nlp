This was simple and tasty. I omitted the salt and added crumbled goat cheese (which is salty). My rice vinegar was seasoned, but it turned out fine.

I used scallions instead of red onion, 8 oz of snap peas and only 1 tbs of oil and it was wonderful. I love beets and this is a great way to eat them.

It's great and beautiful and uses all my favourite ingredients, but SO SO salty! I just don't like salt that much... I would half the salt next time, or maybe even less. I also made it with green beans for convenience and they were good too. I'm also not sure what soaking the onions does, but I may not do that next time and see if they come through better - or I'll just add more onion. Finally, I'd be interested to see what happens if I substitute some of the corriander seed for cumin. Maybe I'll try that next time too.

I guess I wasn't paying attention and did'nt realize this was going to be pickled beets. But pickled beets with a wonderful flair. Served on a bed of Romaine, it looked great and tasted better. My guests were raving. To save a step I bought canned cut up beets.

This is a refreshing colorful salad to have at the summer table, or even when you just want a taste of summer. Guests rave about it.

A great recipe! Such a change from "greens". And it does compliment most any meat dish for a nice light meal. It's a winner.
