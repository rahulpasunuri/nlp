Quick, easy and delicious! Only change was to use fresh garlic instead of shallot as a previous reviewer had (and that was only because I had the garlic and not the shallot). Will make this again.

Super easy and really tasty! Used Vadalia in place of shallot. Used chicken broth in place of beef broth. Used 1/4 cup more broth.

This way to prepare mushrooms is so simple and so incredibly delicious. I've made them to top any steak and chicken, I will make this again and again.

The sauce was very good. I substituted garlic for shallots and didn't have a great quality balsamic, but even still it came out very nice. We used rib steaks.

Very good and very easy. I'm not a big red meat fan but i ended up making this twice in two weeks. Be careful not to overcook the sauce. If it starts to thicken too much, take it off the heat. The reduction makes the flavors too intense and you loose the delicacy of it.

This made an amazing dinner - the sauce is intricate and flavorful, complimenting the meat and mushrooms beautifully. I was a little wary of the blade steak as I haven't used this cut of meat before, but it had great texture and flavor. Definitely will make again.

i personally think this is an amazing dish.. cooked in under half hour n def a pleaser when u hv one to entertain. I did make a slight change of adding more than a tablespoon of chopped shallots n added alil garlic as well. Taste superb..

I had the ingredients on hand, and even though the mix seemed sort of nothing, I made the dish anyway. Unfortunately, my instincts were right on. I'm a better cook than this even when I'm too sick to stand. Don't waste your time, mushrooms or good balsamic.

Rich flavors, easy cut of meat to find and it went together easily. I didn't have a shallot so used a leek. This goes in the "family file." Could be served to most "company" folks, too. Delicious!

This was a great recipe. Wonderful flavor and easy to prepare. I used NY Strip steaks instead of the chuck steaks.

The sauce was delicious!! We grilled strip steaks and I just made the sauce on the stove. It was super easy and wonderful. I also added a sprinkle of crumbled gorgonzola on top.

The flavor in this recipe is intense and absolutely DELICIOUS! Served with mashed potatoes and doubled the sauce and it made a fantastic addition as a sauce for the potatoes also! Used tenderloin steaks rather than blade steaks and it makes a meal elegant enough for a dinner party as all ingredients can be chopped and stored in fridge and it comes together quickly and smells WONDERFUL while being prepared.

I had a one inch thick shoulder blade veal steak and attempted to use this recipe for the this cut of veal. I added some fresh taragon to the gravy liquid while reducing and seared the meat on high for about 7 to 8 minutes because of the thickness of the meat. I wanted a rare to medium rare steak when done and this seemed to work just fine. What did not work was cut of meat was not real tender and the recipe gravy or broth did not seem to help or enhance the flavor of the steak. I really think my major problem was the shoulder blade cut cooked in this manner. Worth trying, but not more than once.

The combination of flavors in the mushroom sauce is wonderful. It's a great weeknight dinner for two or an entire family and really easy to make!

I used tenderloin instead of blade and my family called it "awesome". Great recipe!

Delicious! I used a mix of lion's mane, oyster, giant oyster and criminis when I made this. This is an amazingly easy and wonderful recipe.

I thought this was really good and I used a ribeye instead and it was probably the best one I have ever had.

I thought this was delicious - the sauce was a great compliment to the beef, and I just used more cornstarch to thicken it a little more. I will try a different cut of meat next time, though, I'm not a huge fan of blade steaks.

very simple and very good; great for quick weeknight dinners. sauce is slightly runny, but otherwise easy and satisfying.

Made this as stated, except subsituted filets for blade steak. Very nice weeknight supper, and also good enough for casual company.

This is a very tasty, easy and rather elegant dish to make with on hand ingredients. The balsamic vinegar and soy sauce combination provides just the right (slightly acidic/salty) balance to the steak. I'll definitely make this again.

Thanks to all who came before- I added a little more than half of the balsamic called for. It was really tasty, served it on tenderloins. I would even consider adding a little more balsamic next time. (You must use quality stuff though)

The basalmic is a bit strong and is probably better used as a marinade instead of a gravy. I wouldn't make it again this way.

My husband an I just loved this! I would definitely make this again.

Sorry, I gotta tell you this was awful. The sauce was much too vinegary.

I didn't use the cut of beef I was supposed to but I still think it turned out great overall, definent make again

Simple, quick & good! Blade steaks are apparently the same as flat iron steaks. Might try marinating the steaks in the soy sauce/balsamic next time - the flavor was good as a sauce but might be better as a marinade, too (even though the recipe is supposed to be a quick one).
