We made this recently and it was one of the BEST recipes we've tried. A little goes a long way so serve in small scoops. We are making it again for our Supper Club this weekend. A winner recipe and such a treat.

Delicious! I added an extra 2 tablespoons of lime juice since I prefer a tarter flavor, and the result was wonderful!

Recently was craving key lime pie and with the weather warming up, this sounded perfect. I tried it and it did not disappoint. It was fantastic! I did however tweak it just a bit. I didn't want just graham crackers in it, I wanted graham crack crust. So I baked a graham cracker crust, because it's so simple to do, and I broke that up to fold in. Delicious!

Wow. I have made this three times in the last week and a half. Usually I'm partial to chocolate or coffee ice creams, but I'm won over completely by this. Very, very creamy, and the graham cracker makes for a very nice crunch. I didn't use key limes (could only find regular limes), and added about two extra tablespoons. Delicious.

Made this wonderful recipe. However, I double it and still it was not enough to serve 4 people. The taste is just great and just made another batch for later in the week.......4 X........and came out great! It is a keeper!

Cook from Ione, CA these are the ingredients to add to the PLAIN BASE. Sounds yummy, I'll have to try it out after I try the caramel frozen custard one from yesterday.

A note to the last reviewer "A Cook from Ione", you should read the whole recipe. You make a plain base then add the lime juice, zest, etc. to it, and freeze. Just a thought. I have saved it in my recipe box and will get around to making it eventually. If it is anything like the lemon curd ice cream I make it should be excellent and refreshing at the same time.

I doubt that the proportions listed in the recipe (3 Tbsp.) would yield a quart! I wouldn't waste my time and money on it.

bought this at Target the other day when on sale and it is really good. it's like key lime pie in a ice cream form. Truly great, one of my new favorites.

Now that Summer is here and almost everybody in the family is clamoring for something cold. Well, here is something that I have tried as it has been kind of hot lately. Amazing, it is so refreshing! Thank you for this recipe :)
