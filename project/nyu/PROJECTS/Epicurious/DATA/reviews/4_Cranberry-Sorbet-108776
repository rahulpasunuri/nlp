We use this sorbet in our Thanksgiving welcome toast - a small scoop paired with champagne. Yummy!! A great holiday cocktail. (For the kids, use ginger ale)

Great palate cleanser or light dessert! I made this for a dinner party and served it before the main course and everybody loved it. Will make again for sure!

This sorbet is delicious! It highlights the flavor of the cranberries, has just the right amount of sweetness, and leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It is a perfect cool treat on hot days, or as a light desert after a heavy thanksgiving meal. Although this recipe makes more liquid than my 1.5 quart ice cream maker can hold (it makes about 2 quarts total).

This rating is in anticipation of an approximation of a similar recipe from my mother's hand in my childhood. I cannot think of Thanksgiving and Christmas without her heavenly tart dessert on the palate. Love ya, mutter. I do wonder how it would taste with the addition of fresh mint and/or fresh grated or ground ginger.

Excellent flavor! Terrific palate cleanser! I found it just the right touch at the end of a rich Thanksgiving meal.

A huge hit on Christmas. I served it as a palate cleanser served in demitasse cups between dinner and dessert. You will have to cut the recipe because it's too much for most ice cream makers. I left the suger alone and it was not too sweet.

I made this last night for Christmas. It was the perfect light dessert for a large dinner. I also reduced the sugar but not by much. The sorbet ended up being just a little tart and sweet at the same time. I also added a dash of Cointreau (not too much so that it would still freeze properly). It was a lovely colour with festive ingredients. I halved the recipe and I still had to make it in 2 batches in my 1 pint Ice Cream Maker. I will make this again.

Excellent sorbet recipe. I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut the recipe in half to fit my ice cream maker, and also took the sugar down a bit (1 cup instead of 1 and 1/4 cups). I also added a few tablespoons each of lemon zest and orange zest. Nice and tart - not too sweet. I will make this again!

Makes too much for one batch in most ice cream freezers -- needed to do it in two. Lovely color and flavor -- a great break in a heavy, holiday dinner.

A very "clear" taste, but a bit too sweet. To save time, I completed both steps and chilled cranberry mixture with syrup and juices. Next time: less syrup, and maybe some bits of orange and/or lemon zest for extra bite.

We loved the tartness of this refreshing sorbet. I did not use all of the simple syrup called for in the recipe because we love tart! I would use a finer food mill disc because there was pulp and seeds that fit through the meduim size and I would like it a little smoother. A keeper!
