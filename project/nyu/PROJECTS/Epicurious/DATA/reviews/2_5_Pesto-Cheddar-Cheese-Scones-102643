i own a cafe and have tried many recipes for scones ....i must say this one is the best ....all my customers love them. i do replace cheddar and pesto with blueberry scones with a 1/4 cup sugar added

This sounded good...but I was disappointed with the result since the pesto flavour didn't come through. It's a waste of good ingredients and I think something this fattening should taste better.

The previous review puzzles me--3-plus cups dry and 1-plus cup liquid is the standard bread recipe, and this certainly wasn't runny. I found it needed salt, but I used homemade pesto & maybe storebought is saltier. These were good, but a little goes a long way--use mini biscuit cutters and freeze half for later.

Danger! Danger! Stay away! This recipe has some major problems. Baking relies on formulas, and the formula here is deeply flawed. There is too much liquid:dry mixture and consequently, you end up with pesto-cheese pancake batter. That might, actually, be something worth eating... I checked the magazine to see if there was a transcription error but there wasn't. I did find out that the author of this recipe is a high-school sophomore who most definitely needed her math checked before Bon Appetit went ahead and printed it. Beware..not all recipes are tested beforehand. But I guess that's half the "fun" of cooking, right? Especially when you have company coming.

These were easy to make, but the results were disappointing. The pesto and cheddar flavors did not really come through. Also, they required longer than 20 minutes to bake completely.
