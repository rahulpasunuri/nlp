The ice cream cups are very impressive when served and look like you slaved for hours. You do have to work quickly so the dough doesn't dry out. I would also recommend going very lightly with the vegetable spray as too much will burn and cause a bitter taste. You also have to watch the cups as they burn easily, especially the edges. I would also recommend a little more honey in the honey/butter combo and suggest sprinkling the edges of the cups with cinnamon/sugar to add a little more sweetness. I filled mine with a Kir/Rasberry Sorbet and fresh berries which made it a very colorful dessert.
