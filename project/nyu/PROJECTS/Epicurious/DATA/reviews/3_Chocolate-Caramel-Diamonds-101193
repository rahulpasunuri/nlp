These were very good--kind of like little brownie truffles. The ganache is delicious and has a lot of depth from the caramel base. Like others indicated, the caramel topping will melt in the heat, so this may be best served in colder months. My cake stuck to the pan. I'm not sure why, but the ganache poured on top hid the cracks that resulted from the cake being stuck.

This is an awesome dessert. I have made it several times with varying levels of success. I'm not sure what I have done differently each time, but the results are always good...sometimes great!

I've made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. I'm VERY surprised that some people were disappointed in it. The trick to the caramel is to crush it and keep it in an airtight container and then to sprinkle it just before serving. It will melt if it sits for several hours (and more quickly in hot weather).

An absolutely awesome dessert. Everyone who tried it thought it was the best chocolate dessert they've tasted. Oh and the trick with caramel is to melt the sugar slowly.

I was hoping this would be more interesting as a nice part of a dessert buffet, but was dissapointed. The sparkling candy on top was neat but it fell off when you picked it up, otherwise it had good flavor and texture.

With regard to cooking caramel: After years of making caramel for flan, here are my suggestions: 1) Don't use anything but a chopstick to stir it; 2) Start the sugar over a cold burner, then turn to high; 3) Make sure you have your stove fan on, as cooking caramel can smoke; 4)As it melts, every 20-30 seconds take it off the heat for 5 seconds -- this controls the melt, means you're less likely to burn it and get that unpleasant taste. I made these for a baby shower, and as suggested below, sprinkled the caramel on as I plated them, reserving the rest for the replacements. Also, I'd suggest not doing the caramel on a humid day, as it will melt even faster on the "diamonds".

I made these for a party and was very impressed--so much so that I will be making them for a New Years Eve party tomorrow. Excellent!

I've made these several times and always to rave reviews. The base is really more like a flourless cake, very dense and not overly sweet--definitely cook less than recommended time. The ganache is a bit complicated, but I'm no expert, so I think all it really takes is patience. Adding the cream to the melted sugar and getting all the caramel to melt takes a while--just keep it simmering and keep stirring (and breaking up the pieces). It's worth it!

Seems easy, but too complicated. The cake base tastes like a brownie and not a cake. I made the caramel 2 times and both times it melted unevenly causing problems. Adding the chocolate AFTER stirring in the cream caused the chocolate to seize. In the end, it tastes like a caramel brownie. Why serve that at a dinner party?

Made these several times for party's and they are a sure thing. Very rich so cut them into bite size pieces. Also do not crush the caramel until the last minute and sprinkle on brownies immediately before cutting or they will soak in and the dish loses its pretty presentation.

Great recipe! A suggestion, though: A wooden spoon is the best utensil to use when cooking sugar. You should also mark your spoon "Sugar" so that you don't use it to cook anything else.

I've made these several times since the recipe first appeared in Gourmet, and each time it gets a bit easier. Even a pastry chef friend wanted the recipe. For the cake part, I cook it about 3-5 minutes less than recommended, taking it out when the tester is not quite clean in the center, and it is superb. And don't skimp on the quality of your chocolate. I had trouble with the caramel in the beginning, too, then realized that the last thing you ever want to do is stir the sugar while it melts! With a FORK, of all things?!? For the ganache (where, yes, would be easier to use a straight ganache...)once the sugar is melted, mix in the cream and chocolate with something like a heat-resistant spatula (Williams-Sonoma has great ones). Forget the fork idea - what a mess. Lastly on the caramel - if you sprinkle the crumbly caramel on them all, it turns to gooey liquid within several hours, esp. if you cover them. Better to sprinkle it on only the ones that you plan to set out to serve. Set aside the rest for later.

I made these for a New Year's Eve party and they were fabulous; I got rave reviews. I'd make them again in a heartbeat. I don't remember them being particularly difficult, beyond the fact that nything that starts with making your own caramel can be time consuming. I hope that the St Louis cook will try again. Maybe a different chocolate -- I used Callebaut -- or maybe the caramel needed to cool just a little before adding the chocolate. Anyway I thought that they were top notch!

What a mess!! Fortunately, this was not too much work. The cake was like a poorly made brownie. It turned out dry and crummy. It was still wet after 20 minutes, and the cake tester came out clean only after another 10 minutes. I'm thinking for a moister cake, it should have been taken out even though the tester was not clean. I don't know. The ganache seized up on me- I wish the directions would have been more precise. And the caramelized sugar crunch was terrible. Turbinado sugar would have tasted better and been much easier. My husband said this was gross and told me never to make anything from the epicurious site again. The only saving grace is that my children will eat anything that contains sugar! Oh well, maybe I need ganache lessons! Better luck to future bakers.
