Although this is not my favorite guacamole recipe I love the different flavor that the basil adds. I have served this at several cookouts and somebody always asks me for the recipe. I prefer to serve it with pita rather than tortilla chips.

Good but certainly nothing special.

This is absolutely the best. Stacks up well against traditional guacamole recipes. Easy and refreshing. I've served to many people and everyone loves it.

As with others, I was unsure about the basil flavor. But I had basil and some avocado that needed using. Super easy and super delicious.

Super Yum and easy! I wasn't sure how it would taste being that we love regular guac, but this was REALLLY good.

Quick, easy and tasty! I didn't have any shallots, so I substituted in some leftover roasted onion (chopped) and garlic and it was so delicious!

Loved it! Used dried basil because I didn't have fresh, but it was still yummy. Will make this one regularly.

E-A-S-Y! I used fresh, prepared ingredients from the grocery store and in five minutes I was done. For the exception of the bread, it's very good for the health conscious person. As a matter of fact, I'm making it again this weekend!

I made this for a birthday celebration appetizer and it was a hit for 3 generations (ages 1-67 years)! Plus it was a healthy appetizer. Nice Italian twist to a yummy Mexican mainstay.

This was inexpensive and took me all of 10 minutes to make, but what a hit it was! The basil and shallots add a tasty new spin to basic guacamole. I will make it for many gatherings to come.

Simple, quick and very healthy. I love the taste of basil in the guac.
