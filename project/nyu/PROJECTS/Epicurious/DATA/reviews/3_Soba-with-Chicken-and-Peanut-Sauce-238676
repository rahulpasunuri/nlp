The sauce was very thick and had way too much peanut butter. I would cut the peanut butter in half.

I just made this for a pot luck tonight, made a couple additions-- snow peas and bean sprouts. I poached the chicken in a coconut and ginger broth (College inn brand)and then cut in small strips. When I tasted I thought, WOW, this is great. The flavors all compliment each other very well.

My hubs and I really enjoyed this- it's a quick, easy recipe and works fine with udon noodles (thought I had soba but was mistaken). I also added snow peas because I wanted some extra veggies in there. Definitely has a kick to it! I didn't find it salty and I thought it was complex enough. We used Tamari instead of soy sauce.

This was very easy and tasted fine, but I won't make it again. There's nothing wrong with it, it just isn't very interesting. I've made better peanut sauces with not much more work using other recipes (I like one from Pham's "Best of Vietnamese and Thai Cooking").

We really like this recipe -- great to make and have ready for weekday lunches to take to work. (Doubly nice because I enjoy it cold, so saves the need to microwave.) The sauce is plenty salty, so stick with the plain chicken. Firm tofu is also a good substitute. We like it spicy, and usually heap in the chili sauce. We've also used natural peanut butter with no problem. The scallions are a must. Persian cucumbers are excellent with this dish.

I love this recipe and it's become an easy go-to on busy nights because it's easy to cook. I don't know why they say not to use natural peanut butter. I used natural and it came out fine. Not salty at all. I have a thing for spicy foods so I added red pepper flakes. Cooks quickly, so make sure to prep all food beforehand. Also, I saute some veggies such as onion, snap peas and bok choi to throw into the mix. I will be making this again and again.

I use bottled peanut sauce "San-J Thai Peanut" no corn syrup and used a little more than 1/2 cup added sesame oil and sirachi as well as few drops of chili oil extra tbsp organic pb (I like it hot). Only used about 1/3 of hot water and some lime zest also ground up some roasted peanuts to put on top and only used 1/2 lb package of soba noodle. I added carrots too. Easy only took about 30 minutes to prepare all I had to do was slice chicken and cucumber and mini prep some dry roasted peanuts. It's tasty and will be good tomorrow as cold salad for lunch after marinating all night....not so much a dinner entree. I might even slice some mango on top for lunch

I made this for my "meat & potatoes" husband and our 22-month old and it was a hit all around. The only annoying part to me was removing the chicken after cooking it because I didn't have a big enough slotted spoon. Next time I will leave the chicken in bigger pieces for cooking and cut afterwards. I added shredded carrots on top with the cucumber & scallion. I also used low-sodium soy sauce. Yummy & easy.

To be honest, this is not a recipe I would ever make again. The sauce was far too sticky and thick and extremely salty.

This recipe is simple and quick to make. If you prefer it spicy, I would add more chili garlic paste. It's a bit heavy so I would suggest going a little easier on the sauce and peanut butter.

This is a GREAT recipe, especially if you like spicy food. I use frozen mixed vegetables instead of the cucumber. My family calls this my "specialty" now.

That's so funny adonahue I made the same note to myself for next time. Way too many noodles - half should be great.

This was really easy and quick to make. It's a simple, satisfying meal. I used 10 oz udon noodles and it came out great.

This was good, but next time I would use half the noodles. 1 lb. was way too much.
