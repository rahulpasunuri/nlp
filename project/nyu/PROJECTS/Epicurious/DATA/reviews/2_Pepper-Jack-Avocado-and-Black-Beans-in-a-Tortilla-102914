Another incredibly difficult 5 ingredient recipe. ;-) It's called a quesadilla as noted below and there is much that should be added by way of seasoning etc. This should really be on a website for those who have just mastered boiling water.

Pretty bland. It could be improved by seasoning the black beans with some cumin, garlic, peppers, etc., but straight out of the can, they didn't taste very good. Even the pepper jack cheese didn't provide enough kick for me. Definitely a simple thing to throw together, but I've had much better quesadillas than this.
