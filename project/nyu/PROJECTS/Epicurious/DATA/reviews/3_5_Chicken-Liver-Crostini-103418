Great flavors, the anchovy and white wine are key. But way too much liquid in this recipe. Add liquid slowly to desired consistency. P.S. I didn't have a food processor so I tried this in my Waring blender and it started smoking. It didn't break though!

Great flavors, the anchovy and white wine are key. But way too much liquid. I recommend removing the livers once they are done, then reduce the liquid to 1/4 of original. Also, slowly add liquid in food processor to get the right consistency. I had to puree until smooth and refrigerate overnight to get it to thicken enough. I would have preferred a rougher texture. It is very similar to a dish at "MOZZA," Mario Batali's restaurant in LA. P.S. I didn't have a food processor so I tried this in my Waring blender and it started smoking. It didn't break though!

Very nice. For the right consistency, be sure not to reduce the stock more than half. I served this with a balsamic-fig chutney, a terrific match.

D-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! Very easy recipe and excellent of taste. Raving reactions from my guests. Have made it three times already and it was even devoured by someone who usually doesn't eat liver.

Like many of the other reviewers, I made a few adjustments of my own. I used half onions and half shallots. I also had a little bit of brandy taking up space in a cabinet so used that with a bit of wine. Next time I'll try all brandy or go for some sherry. I also added a bit of dried parsley. When I make this recipe again (and I will!), I will season it with truffle salt. I had already seasoned the chicken livers with salt so it was too late this time. Conte's has the best truffle salt with tons of truffle chunks (tuscanyflavors.com)

Really, really good. Reminds me of a pate I had in Sienna. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will bump up the sage. !Yum

For the cooks who had a problem with excess liquid: I reduced the stock to 2/3 cup, but if you use a large saut pan (like, 12 or 14 ") and reduce the liquic on high heat, the recipe works very well.

I am a huge fan of chicken liver everything and this is the most delicious chopped liver that I've ever had. Four Israelis were drooling for more and the rest of the partygoers gobbled it up quickly. The recipe is flawed because it does have way too much liquid but this is easy to remedy as the other reviewer notes. Remove the livers when cooked and reduce the liquid separately. Then add it back in the processor for the right consistency. Very easy to prep the ingredients the night before and doesn't take long to make.

Excellent! I didn't have onion, white wine, anchovies or lemon zest on hand and it still came out great with a little more chicken broth for liquid. Highly recommended.

Excellent! It is delicious and has subtle but worthwhile flavors (anchovies, sage, lemon). I made it for a dinner party. Just had to drain the extra liquid after it cooked.

I've been making the curried chicken pate, also on this site, for several years. This is better. My guests thought so also. This has a more complex flavor.

This is sooo good & so easy, I made it for my mother & she loved it so much she ended up having it for dinner as she did not want anything else!Tried using dry sage once as i did'nt have fresh & fresh is all I use now,it definitely makes a difference,as does the lemon zest. Serve with fresh baguette,yummy!!!

I had leftover chicken livers from a Jacques Pepin country pate that I made. Regretably, I did not have anchovies on hand but the result was excellent nonetheless, though I doubt I converted anyone who does not care for chicken livers. Quick, easy, and interesting.

Finally! A liver dish even my 7-year-old will eat! I used about half the amount of liver and same amount of liquid, so instead of pate, I got a sort of wonderful topping for rice, noodles or baked potatoe that my husband thought was delicious.

I made this for our wine club's board members. I had very little time and this went together quickly and flawlessly. I thought it was an excellent pate. I have made it a permanent item in my recipe box.

This was a huge hit with all the guest at my Passover Seder (some of which thought they would hate chicken livers). I served it on Matzo crackers. I doubled the amount of fresh sage and added a bit more lemon peel but kept the liquid amounts exactly to the recipe.

This recipe is flawless! I've made it at least 5 times, and it's heavenly!!!

This had great flavor, but despite the fact that I made it a day in advance and refrigerated it, it was still very liquidy. Next time I'll use 1/2 the chicken stock and slightly less wine. Also, the baguette slices baked for less than 15 minutes, but were very easy to do using an olive oil sprayer such as a "Misto."

reduce it on the liquid side,a day in the fridge it thickens it substantialy.

I've made a lot of chicken liver pate recipes and this is my favorite. The additions of anchovy, sage and especially the lemon zest are amazing. I did make one modification however. I substituted/added some heavy cream for some of the other liquids. I think it added a necessary ceaminess.

This was very good. I think I like the chicken liver pate from the December 1996 issue of Bon Appetit slightly more, but this is a better match for an italian or tuscan menu. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted regular broth for the low-salt broth. I had never made crostini before, but would definitely make this again to use as an alternative to bread or crackers. Also, you may find that people tend to eat more of this than the serving size that is recommended, but isn't that the case with most good recipes. ;->
