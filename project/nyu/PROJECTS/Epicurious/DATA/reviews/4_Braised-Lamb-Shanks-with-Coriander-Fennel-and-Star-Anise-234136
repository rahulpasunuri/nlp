Like others, the broth did not reduce sufficiently and was rather watery despite additional cooking time. Flavorful but alot of work for the result.

The spice blend is really what makes this dish...I highly recommend toasting and grinding the whole spices as it adds a depth of flavor that ground spices would lack. I did the bouquet garni as others have recommended (thank you!) and also added some cubed lamb stew meat along with the 2 lamb shanks I had on hand. Will try this on a leg of lamb next and can imagine it will work well with beef. This dish is very rich and creamy polenta might be too much with it. I made a nice parsnip and cauliflower mash to go alongside and a spinach salad with a lemon vinagrette, shaved fennel and grapefruit. Have been eating the leftovers in dome form or another for the last week. Today I made a stir fry with some lentil pilaf, basmati rice, broccoli, leeks and the remaining lamb. Yummy.

This dish is absolutely delicious. So good, in fact, that my husband immediately excitedly declared on tasting it that we'll be making it for Passover next year.

I found the flavor a bit too cloyingly sweet for my taste. Perhaps it had to do with the inexpensive Port I used; will try again with another. This is a fairly simple recipe. I didn't bother grinding my own spices from whole since I buy them newly ground from a spice store. I did, however, cut down on the amount of black pepper in the spice rub. It is a very rich dish, taken IMO in small amounts. For those concerned with sauce reduction, puree the onions and leeks into the gravy, after removing the carrots (keep whole). You get a marvelous thick gravy, especially if done the next day after skimming off the fat. Next time I'm going to keep the celery in a big piece for removal as it doesn't puree well and I find it rather offensive. Good recipe overall. I give this recipe more like 3-1/2 forks.

For those of you concerned about the the amount of time it takes to reduce liquid, don't be so literal with the recipe. Consider that Suzanne Tracht may be using a stove that has 25K BTUs and your stove only has 12K. Of course, it will take twice as long under those circumstances. The size of the pot also is a factor in how long it takes to reduce, smaller openings require more time than larger openings. Go by the amount of liquid you need as an end result, not the amount of time it takes to do it in.

The flavors of this were really wonderful. I made it as written except I used homemade lamb stock I had on hand instead of the beef and chicken, and I halved the recipe for a dinner for two. It didn't take a really long time to reduce the liquid, but of course I had half the liquid and I wasn't really watching the clock. (I think sometimes these chef recipes are not written for people with regular stoves.) This is what I would do differently: I don't know if I would bother toasting and grinding the whole spices next time, especially since you sear the meat with the spices on it. I think I would also change up the veggies a little--smaller celery and onions to melt away, more carrots, maybe some parsnips too, for the more present chunks of veg. All told, a very happy meal with some creamy parm. polenta, mache, and a Napa Syrah.

I am planning on making this with a slow cooker. I was trying to figure out how to adopt it. If anyone out there has a suggestion please post it. In the meantime here is what I am planning: basically do most but not all of the reduction (so there it enough liquid to cover the shanks in the slow cooker). Then cook overnight on low, maybe 7 hours or so. Remove the shanks and take the sauce and reduce it to a gravy like consistency. Then, serve over wilted spinach or something like that.

Rating: 3
...after reviewing some of the posts here is what I would recommend based on my experience: (1) DO ensure you only have the requisite amount of liquid, and not more, before putting in the oven; (2) DO leave this in the oven for an extra 30-60 minutes, if you want lamb to fall off the bone.

I followed this recipe to the letter, including the time spend reducing the port and broths. My problem was that this time did not allow for a reduction to the levels specified in the recipe. Since alot of reviewers did not seem fussed about the need to reduce, I was not fussed either. The result was lamb shanks that sat in a juice/broth of liquid - in no way looked like the photo. It was good, but this soupiness took away from the final result. I will try this recipe one more time, just to see if I can achieve the result shown on the photo. Not sure what I did wrong!!

Love this so much I'm giving the recipe with a bottle of port and baggie of pre-mixed spices as my holiday presents. While it is fabulous as is, I have found it is still an exceptional recipe when pressed for time to not reduce the port (i.e. use total amount of liquid after reduction, by substituting port for some of the broth), and have also used a crock pot instead of the oven for conveniece.

Made this on Christmas day last year and planning to do so this year. Made the spice mixture the day before I left on Holiday. At the rented cabin, I browned and spiced the shanks and put it into a roasting pan with ALL of the liquid. Now get this...I did not reduce a drop. I put the lid on the roasting pan , put it into a 250F degree oven and then went out x country skiing, 3 hours later we had a rich beautiful gravy and fall off the bone lamb. Don't remember if I had tinfoil under the lid. It's Heavenly.

I am not an experienced or skilled cook. I simply followed the recipe as closely as I could. I could not find fennel anywhere so I left it out and I used cayenne pepper instead of dried red pepper (maybe its the same thing?). I only had 2 cups of of Port in my cupboard. I used a lot less liquid broth than in the recipe because i made the dish in a pressure cooker. I cooked the shanks for 40 minutes then released steam and added carrots and squash and cooked for a further 7 minutes. The sauce needed reducing for quite a while afterwards before it was thick enough. I served it with brown rice. It was absolutely delicious and everyone wanted more. The meat was, if anything, too loose on the bone so it was hard to pick up the whole shank for serving. I did not use a bouquet garni which was a mistake because the reduced sauce is fantastic and it would save having to pick out the star anise, cloves etc. Highly recommended.

A luxurious balance of sweet, savory, heat and lamb shanky unctuousness. We served it with plain, creamy polenta roast cauliflower, a marvelous compliment of flavors and textures (threw in a little chopped flat leaf parsley for some color). I usually follow recipes exactly the first time I try them, but I got distracted and ended up with burnt caramel instead of the port reduction. I had too little port left but some madiera, and then I realized I didn't have enough stock in the pantry either. With no time to go back to the store, then, I winged it with the reduced measurement of each unreduced liquid (i.e. port+madiera, and stock). The end result was so amazing that I plan to make it many more times this way, and save us the time and the calories.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe was very easy and tasted amazing. The only change I had to make was to leave out the beef broth because I didn't have any. The spices go so well together and the Port adds such a rich flavor. I loved this recipe and wished I had made more. I might try this with a chuck roast next time.

WOW. Even without the star anise, excellent rich deep flavor with exotic spices. Served it with simple mash potatoes and tomato salad w/ feta cheese, we were all transported to an Island off the North Africa coast. Since then I get requests to make it over and over again.

Excellent, and very easy to do the day before. I couldn't find 1.25 lb lamb shanks, but found that 5 shanks at .75lb each were more than enough. Great flavor!

Some major modifications but still a nice twist on basic stew. I used venison steaks instead of lamb and a combo of very good sherry with a tablespoon of hoisin sauce and sugar instead of the Port. It's pretty fast prep and the reduction went in 30+ min. The venison was tender and not dried out. Next time I would cut the pepper in 1/2, this is extremely spicy.

This is truly lovely. I made it the night before, just as written (though,rounded measurements of spices) and removed the fat from the chilled mix the next day. This will certainly be in my repertoire.

My husband said this meal was "EPIC", and I agree. Delicious. I made the mistake of making it for 8 people. It was a lot of work to use 2 pots and double everything, but still a wonderful rewarding meal. Made with Quinoa Moroccan Butternut Squash & Carrot Stew on the side.

This recipe is as good as everyone says! The meat falls off the bone and the unique spices marry well with the gamy flavor of the meat. Definitely serve with a fruity bold wine.

Absolutely divine! This recipe got raves from everyone. My daughter didn't want her stove top splattered, so I grilled the lamb shanks rather than browning them in a pan.

This is wonderful! And easy. I made it with beef (chuck roast cut for stewing), and it worked really well. The best of a classic stew (nice stringy meat,intense sauce created by the wine and tomatoes), with rather exotic flavors. The amount of black pepper used gives it quite a bite. Didn't have star anise but the fennel took care of that, I think.

Have made this several times always with people raving and wanting more - even the "I don't like lamb" people. Takes a long time to prepare but with patience and fun with friends in the kitchen it is great - especially on cold winter nights. I add more veggies and ensure I get really meaty shanks. Otherwise, the spices do it all.

This is the best lamb recipe I have ever made, and I've made a lot of them. The only change I made was to eliminate the red pepper flakes: the sauce was peppery enough even before the spices went in, and I feared that the chili would overwhelm the other flavors.

This recipe was an absolute Christmas favorite! If cooking for more than 4 people I highly recommend preparing the dish a day ahead of time (it took me over 2 hours to reduce the broth / port). Lamb shanks spent a total of 3.5 hours in the oven and the meat almost fell off the bone.

Rating: 4
This is now a signature dish with many of my guests (10 or 12 occasions to date). The combination of toasted coriander, anise, cloves and a Port reduction, produces a wonderfully rich and aromatic sauce. It works well with frozen shanks (New Zeland produced and purchased in a local supermarket), or when available, fresh Ontario lamb from a local market. I bundle the spices (cloves, anise etc.) into a bouquet garni. I often choose other side dishes, such as buttered polenta (neutral taste, great texture and generously drizzled with the main dishs rich sauce). Butter-rich and cheesy mashed potatoes, when in a truly decadent mood, was also popular. A keeper!

Delicious! This may be the best lamb shank recipe I have ever tried and believe you me, I have tried many! Just look at all the hobbled sheep out there! Seriously though, this goes to the top of my favorite recipes list. One note; I did the final reduction with the lamb shanks in the pot due to time constraints and it came out perfect.

I've made this four times with success. Didn't think about the cheesecloth but good idea. The last time I prepared this I used both lamb shanks and leg of lamb. Superb!!!

Pretty good, but not great. The broth takes almost an hour to reduce. Perhaps if I had made it a day ahead of time, or reduced the broth even more, it would have had a more intense taste. As prepared, it was on the bland and watery side, albeit with a subtle complex spice to it. I served it with the butternut squash risotto on this site, plated on top of a small amount of warmed baby spinach leaves.

Rating: 4
As everyone else says, fantastic! Definitely use the cheesecloth or a metal tea pod to contain the whole spices. Instead of port, I used mulled wine. Also made it with a whole leg of lamb and it is truly delicious. Making it for my parents for Xmas this year.

This was a fantastic recipe, just a little outside the usual red-wine-stew type of slow-cooked lamb dish. I'm on this site 3x a day, but never review unless it's really warranted and I have a really good tip for followers. I suggest finding grass-fed lambs shanks if you can, as they reduce the "greasy" quality of the dish. They make it possible for the spices to really shine through in this one in a way that fattier shanks don't, I think, and make it a good choice for a spring lamb meal - I served these with a green risotto and they were unforgettable.

I've made this twice now, and it was delicious both times. The spices interact so wonderfully to create a subtle but gorgeous taste. It is a dish that smells divine. I cooked this dish the day before, and, after refrigerating it overnight, skimmed the fat before reheating. Even better, I used the remaining sauce and vegetables the next day (after refrigerating them overnight) to cook a batch of lentils, which took up all the flavours and were absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
Pretty impressive, this dish. Our table of 6 all commented on the multi-faceted flavors. I liked the previous tip about tying the anise and cloves in a cheesecloth, as I now can't imagine that it would have been good to get full bites of those in our meal. A word of caution about the chili flakes: I barely put in a fraction of the 1/2 tsp. called for, and it was still bordering the too-spicy scale. The original recipe paired it with pea tendrils, which I couldn't find, but side dishes of plain boiled red potatoes and cream spinach were excellent. Topped it all off with a chocolate chip mint ice cream sandwich cake with Irish coffees, a very classy St. Patrick's eve event!

Outstanding. I bought six lamb shanks instead of four, and they still didn't come up to the five pounds called for. These smaller shanks are still large portions though, and because the dish is rich, I can't imagine you'd want to eat more. Two notes: put the whole spices in a tea sac or cheesecloth and don't expect the reheating to take 20 minutes (as the recipe says), it's more like an hour.

Excellent recipe. MAKE THIS DISH! Similar to a Chinese five spice. Worth the effort. I had some veal demiglace and it made the sauce deep and velvety.

I haven't been moved to rate a recipe here for a long time. This one got me off my a**! My husband and I had a few cocktails while this was cooking. It had to cook for a long time so we were starving and tipsy when it was ready. I used a Saveur recipe for jerusalem artichokes with thyme as a side. The lamb was amazing! Succulent, tender, and absolutely delicious. We ended up eating all four shanks that night and had no leftovers. Wow. I'm making the recipe again for guests this weekend.

Outstanding and FOOL PROOF! Despite my best efforts, I manage to bungle many of the top-rated recipes on this site. Not so here! Time-consuming but simple, this was melt-in-your-mouth lamb you can eat with a spoon, with an amazing rich and aromatic sauce. Do take the time to reduce the wine and broth - takes much longer than indicated. I did add 50% more veggies and substituted caraway for fennel seeds. Also used the 5-spice powder in the rub since I had no star anise. Served with Gorgonzola Polenta and the Orange with Spiced Walnuts Salad from this site for a perfect marriage of flavors, colors and textures. If serving for guests, make the day before: I reheated and reduced the sauce even more, turning into a divine caramel! Out of this world!

This is absolutely delicious - made only one slight change. Used half port and half red wine. It was amazing. Even a lamb-hater licked his plate. I didn't find the sauce too fatty, but if you are really worried about it you could make in advance as the other reviewers suggest and skim the fat from the top. It is very easy as well. Long cooking time but for most of it you can be doing other things.

This recipe is superb! I think the sauce is one of the best I've ever tasted. I listened to the comments of some others who said the sauce was missing something and added about 1 T of salt to the ground spice mixture, as there is not salt at all called forin the recipe. I also could not fine whole coriander in time for my dinner party, so I added ground to the ground spices as well. The recipe takes much much longer than the times given, but it is worth every minute spent, just allow the better part of the day to prepare, and don't serve until the following day so you can lift the fat from the sauce. FABULOSO!

Served this for a dinner party of 4 at Easter and got rave reviews from my guests. Made a few minor adjustments such as trimming the fat before seasoning the meat (the sauce is less fatty); no star anise on hand so I omitted it; after grinding, didn't use all of the spice mix and omitted the red pepper flakes. Very satisfying results overall and the left over shank was tastier the next day. This will definitely be on my menu for years to come.

To the cook from Cambridge: One technique that I have used to reduce the oil in braised dishes is to make it ahead and refrigerate it overnight. The fat will congeal on the top of the dish, making it easy to remove. Making it ahead also increases the intensity of the flavors in the dish, by allowing them to marry.

Rating: 4
This was truly excellent. You need hours at home, but it's really easy as long as you're around. The meat was tender and the sauce was yummy. I served it with cous cous and asparagus dressed with lemon and olive oil and it was a great dinner party dinner, especially since it's fine if your guests are late! I wish I could have made the sauce a little less oily (any suggestions?) and I wished the veggies were more noticeable (they were a bit mushy by the end of cooking and melted in with the sauce.)
