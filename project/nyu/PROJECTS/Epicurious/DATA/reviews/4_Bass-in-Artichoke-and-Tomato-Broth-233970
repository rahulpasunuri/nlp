This is great!

This was a delicious recipe and I would definitely make it again. Just make sure everyone at your table likes strong flavors, like the kalamatas. The orange olive oil really added a subtle and delicious flavor.

Very delicious. Served on a platter, this dish makes a great presentation for a dinner party. Disappointed that the recipe doesn't include oven temperature. If you like this recipe, try Snapper Veracruz style for a slightly different flavored sauce.

Surprisingly flavorful for such simple ingredients, and healthfulness. Definitely give this a try. I always use halibut because bass is too expensive.

Made this for a quick Monday night dinner with a bulgar pilaf. My fish counter did not have bass but this worked quite well with Haddock. Pay attention to the sodium content of the canned tomatoes, I noticed after that mine (delmonte) had over 1000 mcg for the 14.5 oz can. This recipe is delish.

I make the sauce without the water and use a jar of artichoke hearts instead of frozen. I've made this with halibut, dover sole, and cod. Wonderful base for many fish. My husband loves it so it's definately a keeper. Delicious!

Really good. My husband usually doesn't like any kind of white fish, but he enjoyed this a lot. Will make again!

Great flavors and easy to prepare. The orange drizzle really elevated the dish.

Delicious and really easy. I used tilapia and accidentally forgot the 2/3 c. water. It tasted great and looked nice enough for company. Served it with roasted potatoes and summer squash, all prepared in the oven at 425. I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious. Made with halibut and fish melts in your mouth. My family loved it. May try it with tilapia if I can't find halibut (my local fish store never has bass).

Excellent! I've made it twice now, once with orange roughy aned once with tilapia (maybe someday soon with sea bass). Both times I've added a can of cannellini beans for additional fiber and good flavor. Canned artichoke hearts work as well as frozen and the first time I used substituted black olive tapenade for the Kalamata's because I had it. Leftovers are as good, if not better than the first eating (a pretty unusual thing for a fish dish)- so double anytime! I did omit the butter and orange zest - but sure it would be a good addition.

I would give it 3 1/2 if I could. This was quick, easy and delicious. I used chilean sea bass instead. You could use any rich-tasting fish for this recipe with excellent results.

My husband's response to this dish was, "We HAVE to have this again." Absolutely delicious and so light! Like another reviewer, I made this with tilapia b/c our store didn't have bass, and it was wonderful. I did skip the orange zest as I'm not a citrus fan, and I clearly didn't feel that the dish lacked anything.

The oven temp listed in the magazine is 425 degrees F, preheated and oven rack in middle position.

My in-laws, husband and a nephew who doesn't eat fish love this dish. I am very lucky because I live in Hawaii and we have the greatest fresh fish. The fish mongchong made this great recipe, greater. I must say it was very easy to make and the orange oil was a nice touch to the final product. I used canned artichoke instead of frozen and used fresh mushrooms instead of olives (only because my husband hates olives) I will definetely make this recipe again.

I made this using tilapia as my market did not have bass at all. It was easy and very tasty. I loved the 'orange oil' drizzle as a finish - great flavoring! I use 375 as a roasting temperature; and roasted this dish about7 minutes - that worked well with the Tilapia fillets I used. Will make again for sure

Sooooo good. All my favorite ingredients in one dish. I didn't use the orange sauce though. My boyfriend loved it.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!I used halibut, baked it at 350 for 18 minutes, and skipped the water in the broth which produced a MUCH richer flavor. Also used a can of artichoke hearts instead of frozen. YUM!

This looks wonderful! Does anyone know the oven temperature for the roasting?

this dish was outstanding - easy to make - not time consuming. could not find sea bass, so I substituted orange roughy filets. will definately make again.
