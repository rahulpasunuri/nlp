I made this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. She's not much of a dessert person but she absolutely loved this recipe and so did the rest of us! I used a bit more strawberry for the filling, two full cups of sliced berries. I also did not use kirsch so for a touch of extra juice I added a bit more sugar and a bit more lemon. The result was a very fresh-tasting filling, and combined with the genoise sheet it was absolutely delightful - so light and yet so fresh, terrific served cold. I think the chocolate genoise with this filling would be terrific as well, though I think I'd skip the meringue as it could be a bit much with the chocolate flavor. The presentation was quite elegant even though my meringue refused to color. Definitely making this one again and again!
