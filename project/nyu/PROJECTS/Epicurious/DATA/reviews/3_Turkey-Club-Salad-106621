We had this for dinner last night; it was a snap to prepare and was absolutely wolfed down by the "menfolk". I confess to making my own croutons because (a) I could do it in the time it took to fry my own bacon ("pre-cooked bacon"??), and (b) store-bought croutons are crap.

Very good and very easy!

You can make this as easy or as complicated as you want. I LIKE making bacon, so I opted not to use ready-to-serve bacon, and I used leftover turkey breast I'd grilled a couple of days earlier. As the cook from Arlington did, I mixed all the ingredients but the greens and allowed the mixture to chill before spooning it onto the baby spinach. Definitely a keeper!

My husband loves this salad and is always delighted when I tell him we're having it for dinner. Very easy to make, especially if you buy bagged salad greens. It's good with a light Caesar salad dressing, too.

Very easy and good recipe. I used the coleslaw dressing instead of the ranch. They are quite different in flavor so use the one you like the best.

My bridge group loved this salad. I mixed everything but the greens together, chilled it, and served it on top of the baby spinach. A winner.

This took about 2 minutes to prepare. Beautiful colors, great (light) taste!

Great recipe - fast, satisfying, no cooking required, and really tasty. I substituted soy-based "salad crunchies" for the bacon (my teenage daughter won't touch bacon) without missing a thing. Perfect for a weeknight.
