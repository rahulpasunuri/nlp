I love olives. And I love egg salad. Followed the recipe exactly and neither me nor my boyfriend cared for it.

I have been making these for years. Had them again tonight. So good with just a cold, fresh, cut-up orange.

I agree with the person who did not like this recipe. This was a bland taste and thought the olives should really not be there. This is not the best-ever and I think those words should be taken out.

This is a very refreshing change of pace from standard egg salad. I used it as a salad rather than a sandwich and integrated the bacon into the mixture by chopping it coarsley and adding it to the bowl. I think the next time I will add a few capers just for kicks but, definately, there will be a next time!

This is a great recipe - my husband loves it! The addition of bacon, olives, and Dijon mustard is what really makes it terrific!

I love this recipe! The first time I made it from the recipe and loved it. This time (3rd) I added red and green onion and pecans. Love it!

Very good egg salad - a bit salty with bacon and the olives. This is definitely one of my husband's favorites. I prefer whole wheat bread and often use arugula instead of red leaf lettuce.

I was just looking for a good egg salad recipe, I just got a craving for one and wanted to take one for lunch tomorrow. Found this recipe and IT IS TO DIE FOR!!! Absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it will be a standard in my home. The dijon adds the perfect flavor and goes so well with everything else. For those that don't like olives, they are so subtle in taste, but a very necessary ingredient. I would definitely just give it a try. Thank you again.

I chopped and added the bacon directly into the salad for a great taste. Make sure to season with salt and pepper to bring out the flavors.

This is really the best I have had since childhood. Added in finely minced vidalia onion and some garlic powder. When I make it next time, I'll add in some chopped dill and replace the dijon mustard with dried Colman's mustard powder - 2 tsps.

I'm a big egg salad fan, but I didn't think this recipe was worth the extra effort of chopping celery, chopping olives, and cooking bacon. I'll stick with plain ol' egg salad, although I might add a touch of Dijon from now on.

This has quickly become a family favorite - egg salad jazzed up for adults. I usually use only two slices bacon per sandwich since the olives and mustard can be a bit salty.

I'm really surprised that this got such great reviews. I followed it exactly and felt that the Dijon was a bit too strong and the olives didn't quite work. I'm an olive AND mustard fanatic. I just did not think these melded well.

These really ARE the best ever! Because I don't like celery, I've made the salad with and without it...it's very good both ways. My family will never be happy with simple egg-and- mayonnaise sandwiches again.

I made these for a work lunch and I still get requests from it! Absolutely the very best!

Made this last night, and, in comparison to other egg salad sandwiches, this rates 4 forks. Used Manzanilla stuffed olives, multi-grain bread, plain iceberg lettuce, and generously peppered the chopped eggs. Added no salt or any additional pepper. They were WONDERBAR, if perhaps a bit heavy on the bacon. Next time I may only put 3 pieces (one and one-half slices) on each sandwich. Served them with tomato slices and tortilla chips. DO TRY THESE SANDWICHES!!!

It's the pimento-stuffed green olives that make this the best-ever in my book. I don't usually even bother with the bacon. Four forks!

I added the bacon to the eggs and left out the olives. I put it on a plain whole wheat bread (untoasted) and took it to share with a few co- workers. Everyone said it was indeed the best-ever.

This recipe would be much better without the bacon. It overpowers all of the other flavors.

I've made this as is and it's quite tasty. It's also very good made with 1/3 C. low-fat mayo, turkey bacon and 4 yolks and 8 whites. YUM!

Good egg salad, but not the best. The addition of olives was unique and tasty. I like basic egg salad with addition of lemon juice . Always let make ahead to ensure the blending of flavors.

delicious!!! i used the reviewers' advice and used romaine, and the beef bacon (i eat kosher) was crumbled into the salad. i can already imagine using the egg salad and some smoked salmon for phyllo pastry parcels. ths will definitely be a staple sandwich for years to come!

Very very good. I also subbed Red onions in instead of Olives. Yum.

This is also very good mixed with pasta for a cold salad luncheon dish.

This was so good it was worth the extra time on the treadmill needed to combat the fat and calorie content. Added chopped red onions and scallions to the mix. Even better the next day after the flavors had a chance to combine.

I didn't care for the recipe in the form that it was, however, with a couple of tweaks it's edible. The 2nd time I made it I substituted some chopped red onion for the olives and romaine lettuce for the red leaf. This improved the taste and texture considerably.

I guess I'm alone here. I was greatly underwhelmed by these sandwiches. I found that toasting the bread made them too dry. I probably make egg salad more than other people, so maybe standards are higher! Nothing about these sandwiches stood out for me.

Let me start by writing that I didn't like egg salad before I had this. My sister recommended this recipe and now I am adicted! I love the olives.

This really IS the BEST egg salad EVER! I made it eggsactly(!) to the recipe's specifications, and it was completely perfect. I also tried the salad with bacon chopped up in it as another reviewer suggested, but I liked it better without. (It was still fabulous with the bacon, though.) This really is the perfect egg salad. Don't change a thing.

Very good. The olives gave it a unique taste and added a little kick. Didn't change anything in the recipe and it turned out great.

Yum! Bacon and egg salad -- perfect together. I omitted the olives because I'm not a fan, but the celery adds a nice crunch, the lettuce a fresh component -- and I changed my bread to toasted pumpernickel -- it was great. I cut each of mine up in to two small crust-off tea sandwiches. Great!

I left out the celery because I'm not a fan of it, but I really like this recipe.

This is a great recipe! Like another reviewer, I also crumbled the bacon into the egg salad. My only suggestion to someone doing the same is to use low sodium bacon. I found the bacon made the salad quite salty. I threw in the other four eggs I hard boiled (and some more mayo) to see if it would help dilute the salt, but it didn't do the trick.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe for a traditional sandwich with a new twist. The bacon and olives were a great surprise. I cumbled the bacon up into the egg salad and added all the mayo at once because I had to have this made the day before and it worked great. I served the bread separately and untoasted.
