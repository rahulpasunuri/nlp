Used the suggested Kumomotos, but made a number of other substitutions. Used stock instead of water, and heavy cream. Didnt have leeks so used green onion for soup and carmelised onion for garnish. Used black pepper and nutmeg instead of cayenne. Gives it a richer taste, I think. Also added some salt. Very good and quite easy.

Use the freshest of oysters and you can't go wrong with this recipe! Play around with it, too. (Instead of Russet potatoes, I used farmer market fresh, organic Yukon Golds. Substituted the druggery of rinsing & cleaning well fresh leeks with Trader Joe's fresh frozen leeks.) Used a piece of Jalapeño pepper (without vein or seeds) instead of Cayenne. Nixed the fried leeks and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, based on previous comments. Threw some chopped chives and toasted, buttered croutons on top, for garnish.

This was wonderful! I made a few alterations. For the 3 1/2 cups water, I used 3 1/2 cups chicken broth and omitted the half and half altogether, and I used Fleur de Sel. Per another comment, I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. To me the recipe was confusing re: how many leeks to put in with the potatoes, so I just chopped two leeks and added them to the potatoes, and I totally omitted the fried leeks as a topping.

Halved for smaller group (I don't think oyster soup reheats well)and it was very good. I was buying oysters several days in advance so opted for larger pre-shuked in liquor and we didn't find the soup too briny at all-I may have used a bit more potato, but at least two people added salt at the table. Stick blender works well to purée the soup and reduces clean up. Skipped the leeks this time because it was just family lunch!!

This recipe is simple and delicious. I know I will make it again. The only thing I think it needs is a little lemon and then it's perfect.

We have oyster stew every December and have access to great, shucked, yearlings from Oregon Triangle Oyster Co. in Winchester Bay Oregon. Past years product was always too thin. Adding the pureed vegetables was well worth the effort!-

This dish is both very special and very delicious. I expanded it for a dinner party, and took the time and trouble to shuck 100 oysters, which left my hands more raw than the bivalves. Since they are the main driver of flavor in this dish, the quality of the oyster was key, and these Hog Island Sweetwaters from tomales bay were exceptional. I botched the frizzled (aka deep fried) leeks somewhat, primarily because they did not store well overnight. No one seemed to notice they were a bit limp, and the overall dish got rave reviews from all 11 diners.
