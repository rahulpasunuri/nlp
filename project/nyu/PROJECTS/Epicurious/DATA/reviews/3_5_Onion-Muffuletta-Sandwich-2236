you can find italian bottled relishes and what not in stores if you don;t have time or wanna quicker, cleaner prep. Make sure to give enough time for everything to pack and soak down into the bread

I made this for the second time last night, and it was even better than the first time!! (This time I did use sweet onion, but still had no capers, so I added some bottled Maggie Hot Chile Sauce to the relish.) I divided the recipe in half to serve two. For my 1/2 recipe I used a 3 oz. combo of meats from a package of Hillshire Farms Deli Select Sub Sandwich Variety Pack and 3 oz. of Provolone cheese. Also didn't have baguette-type bread so I improvised--used about a 9-inch piece of regular French bread. Then, horizontally, I cut a large piece out of the center of the bread, so that the shape resembled a baguette. Didn't use a food processor--not necessary if you chop the veggies very fine, and then stir the relish ingredients periodically for that hour that they sit in a bowl (less cleanup, and also we like the crunch of the onions). For a VERY simple and quick meat/cheese sandwich, DO TRY THIS--YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!

I made the relish then used it on a sandwich with slices of a non-descript leftover pork roast. I also added some good swiss cheese and french bread and grilled the sandwiches. My husband and I loved it. We absolutely will make this sandwich again. I'd even offer the relish as a dressing for sandwiches at a picnic in addition to the standard mayo and mustard.

I added anchovy paste and extra olive oil to counteract the strong onion flavor. It was great the first day but even better the second!

Wow! I made this for a party and everyone loved it. It's even better the next day. I used genoa,smoked turkey and ham,provalone and mozzorella cheese.

Delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter and had a delightful and LARGE sandwich. It got better and better, day by day. (It lasted, since it was so large and since we cut it into small pieces.) The onion muffuletta relish is out of this world! I used 1/4 lb. provolone cheese, 1/4 lb. sliced roast beef and 1/4 lb. ham for my sandwich, which was great.

I will probably mix black olives with the green next time, and gently heat the meat and cheeses in the microwave first. The sandwich went over very well and was totally consumed.
