I really liked this over a bed of rice. I used balsamic vinegar and several tsp of brown sugar. I added mushrooms and no pine nuts. I really wanted to do something w the lovely rainbow chard. I think this is a versatile recipe. take and add veggies and spices as you like.

Excellent side dish for roasted salmon. I substituted authentic balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar for a sweeter touch.

lots of healthy food in there but definitely needs something to cut the bitterness- I added a little brown sugar like a previous chef recommended but if I made it again I would definitely add more!

I made this recipe without the radicchio since my local market did not have it. I also eyeballed the currants (I used dried, found next to raisins in the supermarket) and probably used about twice as much as the recipe called for. I found the to be extremely tasty and plan on making it again for a dinner party this week!

I made this for a potluck last night, and followed the recipe with a couple of modifications. I doubled the pine nuts (who doesn't love pine nuts), and added about 2T brown sugar at the end with the salt and pepper. It was just too bitter/acidic and needed something to balance it out (yes, I did use the currants, too). I thought it was tasty, but didn't get any rave reviews from my friends. I think this is a recipe best made for casual, healthy home dining, not entertaining.
