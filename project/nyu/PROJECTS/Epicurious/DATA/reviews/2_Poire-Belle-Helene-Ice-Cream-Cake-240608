This was a bit of a disappointment. Given the expensive, high quality ingredients of the chocolate and the Poire William, I was expecting a sophisticated dessert. Unfortunately, the flavor of the ice cream overwhelmed everything else, and it was only so-so. Note to self: next time sample the ice cream first! The pound cake pretty much disappeared amid the avalanche of ice cream, and the chocolate sauce, despite the $20 per pound Schaffen Bergen, was nothing to get excited about.
