I made two minor changes: I substituted ground mustard for the seeds and canned corn for the red pepper. Having read that people had trouble getting them to stay together, I decided to squeeze water from the shredded sweet potato in a cheesecloth. We made them thick, and they were a little delicate, but didn't fall apart. Quite good! Zero resemblance to a latke, though.

Great Latkes! Mine held together very well. I made bigger ones and smaller ones. Of course the smaller were more crispy but the big ones were just as good. I finished in a convection over with lower heat and I think that helped dry the oil out of them a bit. Don't leave them into long though.

I'm surprised that there haven't been more reviews for this recipe. It was really delicious. Nicely flavoured, and I loved the way the mustard seeds pop when you chew them. I made it as directed, but with a lot less oil, and they held together really well. I'm making them again tonight to take to a party!

My sister is a vegetarian, so this was a good option for Thanksgiving--it is an interesting alternative to normal yam dishes but also can serve as a main course for vegetarians.

I made it like the earlier commenter, in a quiche pan. I also added a tablespoon of olive oil to the chickpea mixture as I blended it, and found it made it a little fluffier. Turned out quite nice both times I made it

These are incredible - they taste a bit like somosas! And I figured out how to make them so they don't fall apart. Keep the chickpea mixture in the food processor. Blend in cilantro, etc. Then add in yam mixture, 1/2 at a time, pulsing each time until just mixed in. Cook in nonstick skillet. Amazingly, they held together better after there was no oil in the pan. So try cooking without oil!

This is a fabulous dish -- although having read the previous comments, I didn't actually make latkes. I put the mixture in a lightly oiled quiche pan and baked it for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Served it in wedges. Easier and absorbs less oil than trying to make latkes. The dish was big hit and I'll be making it often.

They taste great, but they do fall apart. I made one batch using two eggs, which didn't help much. I made another batch using half sweet potato and half ordinary potato, which held together much better.

Very nice flavour, but they tend to fall apart.

Loved this recipe. My boyfriend (meateater) and I (vegetarian) have problems finding dishes we can agree on--but this one will remain in our repetoire for a long time I feel. More time-consuming to make than you would first expect, but now that we have it down should be easier next time!

I made these latkes for a dinner party, and they were a big hit! They have a really nice flavor ... not too spicy, not too anything. The suggested yogurt and chutney (mango, in my case) are essential sides to serve with them. Really tasty!

I've made these in addition to the traditional latkes. These are delicious but be careful they burn easily and don't hold together as well as white potatoes.
