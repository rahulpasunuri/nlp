I did not have beans so made without and it still came out great! Thanks for the recipe. It is so good, I may try try it with another vegetable I don't have.

How do I get the water to boil?

Time consuming but well worth the effort. I'd make the again, even for company!

I was disappointed. I similarly had high hopes, particularly given the reference by the prior reviewer with the Salted Water recipe (a timeless classic). But ultimately, this recipe disappoints. Next time, I will substitute green beans for lobster, and put them directly in the water rather than steaming. Wish me luck!

This is the first recipe I've tried since I experimented with the Salted Water recipe (now a tried & true.) I feel like this was a real breakout moment to a new technique, and I am now cooking in French! We have many uses for the flavored water, but we don't know what to do with the greenbeans that are left. We're currently composting them, but we'd like to find a better use since they are expensive. The cat does not like them. --thanks, Jeanne

After steaming, finish by sauteing in butter with minced shallots and a bit of olive oil. Sprinkle with salt.

Oh come on, raters. There's no need to be sarcastic. Steaming fresh green beans, with a little butter at the end, is about as good as it gets. So you knew how to do it already. Next?

SOOOOOOOOOOO easy! Could have used a few tips on the proper way to boil my water, though. Next time might try a few seasonings but hey - why mess with a good thing?

Awesome! This dish was so easy to prepare. My guests raved! Once, I substituted broccoli and it came out perfect too! Carrots or asparagus might work too. PUULEEZE!
