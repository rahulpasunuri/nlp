We have been on a salad kick. I adapted this to be more healthy-made a grilled Jerk chicken breast instead. Didn't have some ingredients so substituted lettuce for the cabbage and addedmore onions. Also added a little bacon.

I was skeptical of this recipe also, spinach and cabbage sounded unappetizing. I was banking on the fact that 100% would make this dish again. It was very good. I wanted grilled chicken, so I used grilled rather than fried, with my own spices. I also added bacon. It was good without but even better with bacon.

I was skeptical about this recipe but have found the fork rating system to be quite reliable so I gave it a try. I was really impressed - a really nice light supper, especially if you make your own breaded chicken and add a bit of cold, cooked pasta to the salad.

This is a delicious salad. I didn't use frozen fried chicken, I fried boneless skinless chicken breast. The dressing is delicious too. This is a recipe that I'll make many more times. My husband ask me to give the recipe to his mother, he doesn't ask that often.

this is delicious and quick- and the presentation is nice. the only thing is that the dressing a little sweet- but that was completely a personal prefernce- i have made this several times; it is a keeper.
