Great recipe, but I would suggest adding some onion powder and a little garlic powder to rev up the flavor. With these two extra components I think it made a big difference in the overall taste of the fish

added some Old Bay seasoning to the crumb mixture and some Herbamare. Used rice crumbs to make it gluten free.Served with cauliflower and asian-style slaw. yummy.

I did not have cornmeal on hand, so substituted panko crumbs for the bread crumbs and cornmeal. I didn't double dip, as the panko are quite crispy on their own. Based on other reviews, I seasoned the crumbs well with Old Bay and some other spices, as well as fresh dill. The mystery bag of fish that I had thawed turned out to be halibut cheeks instead of cod, so I simply browned gently in the skillet and did not finish in the oven. Will definitely make again.

My family thought this was quite tasty. An earlier recommendation to double dip the fillets in egg and batter makes for a lovely thick crust. The key is seasoning the crumb mixture well and with herbs & spices that you like. Our cod turned out very to be flavourful and I have already been asked when I am going to make this next.

I was really pleased with how this turned out. So crunchy...it really was like it was deep fried. I did really amp up the seasonings in the coating. I added a lot more paprika and some Emeril's Essence and it tasted great! I think this would also be good with chicken tenderloins.

I have two people at home who don't like fish unless it is coated and crispy - and even then, it's hit or miss. I tried this one but modified it for taste. I used whole wheat flour instead of bread crumbs, increased the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon, added 1/4 tsp of New Mexico chili powder, added 1 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp ground coriander (couldn't hurt, right?). I did everything else as the recipe states and it was crispy and good. Will definitely make this again, and will experiment with different types of fish.

This recipe is a great take on fish and chips. The fish was very flaky and tasty. Next time I will probably add more spices to give some more flavor.

Simple to prepare and delicious! I used white cornmeal and lightolive oil because that's what I had on hand. Didn't leave an odor in the house either!

We substituted 3/4 cup crushed ritz crackers for the bread crumbs. Also, we double dipped the fish- egg, crumbs, egg, then crumbs again. Was absolutely delicious...tasted like the deep fried fish and chips when you eat out but much healthier! Would make an excellent fish taco too. We will definitely be making this one often.

This makes great fish sandwiches! The cod is crispy but retains its moist, flaky, delicate flavor. Great Friday-night Lenten meal!

I was searching for monkfish recipes and came across this one. Since we're dieting I liked the idea of oven frying instead of actually using oil and since my husband is not a fish lover I thought I could sneak this one through. Made a lemon wine sauce and offered that on the side for dipping, he loved it.

I started making this recipe when I bought Cod by accident one day at the supermarket. I asked for catfish and lo and behold when I opened the package at home I had Cod. I was dissapointed..I never liked Cod very much. So I decided to make the best of it and try to find a recipe that would make it palatable for me and the family. Well, we loved it and like the reveiwer from Bethesda, MD the kids can't get enough of it. They actually ask me for more and tonight before my daughter went to bed she wanted a snack. She had just had a full dinner and candy for dessert so I said, "Fine," and to call her bluff, I told her she could have either fish or vegetables. She actually wanted the fish and ate it up like it was candy, for the second time tonight. This is a very nice, simple recipe that seems to please the whole family.

Isn't cod what McD's uses in its fillet-o-fish? The only reason I wouldn't make this again is because of the cod. I might try another fish (flounder?) and season the flour/cornmeal mixture a bit more aggressively

A great new recipe for cod for us. Short of a deep frier for fish 'n chips this is a great way to prepare cod. Malt vinegar is a nice condiment for this recipe if you want to avoid the cholesterol of tartar sauce.

I made 1/2 of this recipe and customized it. I lined a small cookie sheet with foil and then put 1-1/2 Tbs. of oil on it. For the cornmeal mixture, on a paper plate, I mixed 1/4 cup of each Italian bread crumbs and cornmeal, a sprinkle of salt, 3/8 tsp. of cayenne, and a generous sprinkle of garlic powder. I coated each piece of fish with this mixture, dipped each piece in the eggs, and then coated each piece with crushed corn flakes (used about 1/2 cup) before I put them on the cookie sheet. Baked them at 500 degrees for 10 minutes, and they were REALLY CRUNCHY. This eliminated any plastic bags and frying on top of the stove. The fish flavor was mild, but not bland. A long time ago a reviewer from Chicago said that cod was a cheap fish. That particular individual will have fits if he/she knew that I used defrosted Pollack fillets ($0.99/lb. on sale), and it was delicious!!! (P.S. I am very familiar with Oak Park, IL)

Really good. It isn't anything fancy, but if you just want something fishy and crunchy, this will do it. I added quite a bit more cayenne, cut the cod pieces in half lengthwise, and cooked it in a teflon pan. No problems at all - nice and crispy and very good. Only needed about 3 minutes in my oven.

Use less oil - I only used 3 tablespoons, and it was fine - and to those who think it is bland - do not overcook!

I used boneless cod portions and cut them in half lengthwise, making two rough "sticks" of cod from each portion. By doing so, they cooked fully on the stovetop and I didn't need to turn on the oven. I also didn't seem to need the additional oil after turning. I used the coating ingredients as listed. These were fast, easy, and very tasty with a spritz of lemon and a little homemade tartar sauce on the side.

Great way to have Fish & Chips without a Deepfryer. This method will work with any white, flakey fish. Instead of Cayenne, I went wimpy and used Old Bay Seasoning.

I shallow fried the cod. The crust was quite nice. Unfortunately, I used frozen cod and it turned out a little dry inside. Use fresh fish!

Great reciepe that has become a favorite. I get a better crust with more bread crumbs and less cornmeal. Also discovered it is much much easier and less oily to cook the filets for six or seven minutes at 300 degrees in my deep fryer in peanut oil.

I had a container of Emeril's "Rustic Rub" (see foodtv.com) left over from one of his recipes. Since that has cayenne (as well as paprika, oregano, garlic and onion powders, thyme, pepper), I used 1.5 tbsp in place of the 1/4 tsp of cayenne. It came out pretty good and went well with the cornmeal crust. I might go with 1 tbsp next time, though.

My inlaws were over while I was fixing this for my family and just loved it. They stayed for lunch...a rare treat.

Being from Maine, we eat alot of very fresh cod and haddock. It is obvious that the person from Chicago either does not get fresh fish or does not know and appreciate what cod is supposed to taste like. I must admit, however, that haddock would be a better choice for this dish.

This turned out very well. I added quite a bit more cayenne, salt and pepper to liven it up. Pretty tasty, and it paired well with the "fries" suggested here. I also served it with peas and plenty of malt vinegar.

I loved this recipe, although I must admit I increased the spices and served it with a cream-based homemade tartar sauce. Being a Newfoundlander, I was offended by the comment from the cook from Chicago who said, "Cod is a cheap fish that is too bland." Cod is, hands down, my favourite fish. When it's very fresh it falls apart into juicy flakes and the meat is delicate and sweet like no other. Unfortunately, the cod species is in decline and really fresh fish are much more difficult to obtain, but I think the Chicago cook would change his or her mind if making this dish with cod caught the same morning.

I have made this recipe with halibut and cod. The halibut is tastier but if economy is important use cod, up the spices and serve with lemon. Also make sure you use fine ground cornmeal. Will make again because its easy and healthier then deep fryed fish.

Blahh. Wouldn't make again... I think I will stick to tilapia or halibut-- something with quality. Cod is a cheap fish that is too bland.

The comments about the lack of taste and the need to double the cayenne made me wonder if fresher spices would help. I recently started paying more attention to how long spices sit in my cupboards, and replacing more often (and buying in smaller quantities). Check out Penzeys.com

Holy Wow, that was bland. It was a good dish for those who are sort of "scared" of white fish, since it was truly crispy on the outside and well-cooked on the inside. But it really needed something zesty on the side or on top, like some homemade tartar or salsa of some sort. I'd also triple the cayenne, since you couldnt taste it at all.

This dish was very good. My family and I ate it all. I used a stainless steel saute pan, because my cast iron skillet is not big enough, and the dish was crunchy and done. I like this method because it makes a favorite dish possible on low fat diets. I also used egg whites only, and decreased the amount of oil to 1 tbs for each side.

I've made this recipe twice, and was pleased both times. However, I didn't care much for the cornmeal flavor the first time, so next time I used plain crumbs and was very happy with the results. If you find the recipe too bland, try serving it with egg-and-caper sauce Gribiche---a perfect complement to the fish, I think.

Enjoyed this recipe but have others that are as tasty and easier to make. I used seasoned bread crumbs and added 1 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash in lieu of salt and cayenne. Also used only 3T olive oil which was plenty. Would make again, but may not be real soon.

I thought this recipe was terrific! It wasn't soggy one bit and it was full of flavor and very crispy. I did, however, heed the advice of other reviews and doubled the amount of cayenne and I added a 1/2 teaspoon dried mustard to the bread crumb mixture. Be careful not to over cook with this recipe, it's very easy to do.

I found the fish very crispy and I do not use a cast iron pan. I tried it with Emeril's essence in lieu of the cayenne and it was excellent. I think the trick in having it crisp is in the initial sauteing at the beginning.

I used the cast iron fry pan. It didn't help. I thought the fish was pretty bland. I like my oven baked cornflaked fish much better. Just as easy, but 100% better. Crushed cornflakes, seasoned oil with whatever. Dip in oil, let excess drip off, roll in crushed flakes. Bake at 500 for 10 minutes.

I, too, reduced the oil by half, added more cayenne, and used seasoned bread crumbs. Additionally, our local fish market didn't have cod so I substituted haddock - and it was excellent!
