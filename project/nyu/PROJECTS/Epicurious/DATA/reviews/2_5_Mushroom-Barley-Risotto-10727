I like this recipe just the way it is. I'm surprised by the low reviews. I've made it several times and think it's a great way to make a side dish of barley.

I was looking at this recipe to see how it compared to the one in the Joy of Cooking, and for those of you who thought this was bland, you need to try the Joy of Cooking barley risotto. There was nothing about that recipe that was bland, although it was not fast.

This is SO delicious and SO easy. My 10-month-old baby LOVES it, too! I do not add extra garlic. I skip the parsley altogether (because I read that parsley may decrease a breastfeeding mom's milk supply). I use mushrooms from a jar to make it even easier. I add extra butter. I also add extra water (half a cup extra) so that it won't be so "al dente" but this requires a longer cooking time.

This dish was interesting. It was really easy to prepare, but it was not satisfying at all. There's no flavor, and it reminds me of porridge. I'll pass on this recipe.

I've made this twice and have been pleased both times, but I used half button mushrooms and half baby portobellas, and I doubled the garlic. It's fast and easy, and the barley is much cheaper than the arborio rice.

This dish makes a regular appearance in our kitchen, a favourite with young and old alike and so easy to prepare.

I really expected more from this dish. While it was simple to make, the garlic flavoring was far too weak, and the parsley overwhelmed the mushroom taste.
