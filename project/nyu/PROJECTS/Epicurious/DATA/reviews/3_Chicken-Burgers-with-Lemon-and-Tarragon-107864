Excellent! Nice & tasty. The lemon-oil sauce gives it zest!

I have made this dish at least 15 times it's such an establishment for us. I've made it with panko and tempura, I've made it with Italian breadcrumbs, I've made it sauce and with no sauce. Our favorite is a little cornbread mixed with tempura minus the celery plus the sauce. I think that's the winner. :)

p.s. - I made 4 large patties instead of 8 small ones, and even though I made them relatively thin - it took longer to cook through; so I threw a foil tent over while cooking to help speed the process.

I added all the cornbread stuffing mix to the meat mixture instead of 'breading it' and for the sauce I added a few tablespoons of dry sherry and a teaspoon or two of dijon mustard - it made the sauce really POP! A new favorite in our house, my picky 4 year old loved it.

I have made this twice and making it again for dinner this week. My fella who is the chief cook in the house absolutely loves this recipe and would not change a thing. I used dried tarragon in the winter but can use the fresh as it is now growing. The lemon sauce at the end finishes the dish beautifully along with the zest in the actual burger.

I used fresh dill and bread crumbs, worked out well. Don't overcook otherwise they will be dry. Also for a "sauce" I used sour cream. Very tasty. Even my picky 3 year old ate it.

My two cents....... I used Dill instead of tarragon.......a good choice! Added 1/4 chicken broth to deglaze then added the lemon and additional dill. This provide a bit more sauce for the patties. But the best tip for this recipe is topping each burger with a ringlet of orange bell pepper. Looks colorful and ohhhhh so delicious as a garnish! Would surely makes this again!!

This is tasty but not memorable. I've made this twice and would make it again. Didn't make the sauce. Served with a romaine salad and vinaigrette. My 18-mos. old loved it!

I held off on the sauce. The burgers have enough lemon in them. This is definitely something different than your usual burger or meatloaf. We ate it over a salad of musclun greens. Something refreshing in the summer. I think kids would like it.

these became an instant hit in our house and are requested frequently. i add a bit more lemon zest and skip the sauce, instead serving the burgers with a mango salsa. yum!

Very, very good. Had a few difficulties with it, though...I could not find fresh tarragon (or marjoram for another Bon Appetit recipe, for that matter) to save my life here in Fort Walton Beach. Guess that's the price you pay for living in a small town! Never had a problem with the grocery stores in Anchorage, Alaska! Anyhoo, inspite of my not being able to find the fresh herb, I grabbed my bottle of dried tarragon, and forgot to add it to the mix! I just decided to sprinkle it on the burgers prior to cooking, and they turned out great! I would, however, tone down on the lemon juice by a tablespoon next time, though, even though I used bottled. I'll be making these again, that's for sure! Serve with a nice chilled garden salad, and you're good to go!

A wonderful, light alternative to hamburgers, and great for a weeknight dinner or weekend lunch. The stuffing(I had plain and not seasoned) and veggies give the burgers a nice texture. My husband didn't care for them as much, refering to them as "veggie burgers". I did not have fresh tarragon and used dried which worked fine. I also skipped the lemon zest, and used much less olive oil(maybe no more than a couple of tablespoons), and thus, did w/out the sauce. I served them on whole wheat buns accompanied by herbed, roasted potatoes. A very healthy, satisfying meal!

I thought this recipe was quite good. I only had lemon juice so did not put in the lemon zest. The lemon flavor was quite mild. Grilled the burgers and did not make the sauce. With grilled asparagus and corn bread it made a great, quick meal on a hot night.

We thought this recipe was very good. Nice change for a burger. Easy too. Just don't overcook.

I used half of the lemon zest in the recipe, and it was still too lemony! The chicken breast meat is too dry even with the olive oil mixed in (the 2 1/2 minute cooking time may have also contributed-only need 2 min per side). The saving grace is the corn bread stuffing - I used Butterball Cornbread stuffing which has alot of flavor - this added a lovely crunchy "crust" to the burgers. If I make this again, I will used ground turkey (not breast), double up on the stuffing for the outside of the burgers & omit the lemon peel!

I made the recipe exactly as described, both the chicken and tarragon version and the turkey and dill variation, and found them both really good. They are very lemony and are a nice change from a regular burger.

Loved the lemon flavor with the tarragon. I didn't bother making the sauce - just popped the burgers under the broiler and served them on toasted buns with lettuce. Very yummy and a nice light dinner for a warm South Florida weeknight. Give them a try for sure!

This recipes sounds better than it tastes. I was very disappointed. I wish I would have spent my time (and money) making something else.
