In terms of flavor, easily 4 stars. (With a tablespoon of your favorite orange liqueur. Sublime!) But the consistency... more like 2. It's like cold, dense fudge. Sort of. But it's *SO* close to being like actual mousse, in spite taking 5 minutes in a blender instead of 20 - 40 on the stove with a thermometer to get the temp just right... I'm tempted to fool with it to see whether I can get it perfect. Maybe folding in a half cup of beaten cream before pouring into the bowls?

Set up fine for me in ~2hrs, even with transport (4 portions in glass). Tasty but not special in flavor/texture. Just extremely fast and easy. Added bubbling water and blended immediately, added egg whites unbeaten and blended for a good 60sec on liquify.

Fortunately, we had other plans for Valentine's Day, as this dessert was a dismal, regular failure. The flavor was okay, and it was easy...but that's about it. The mousse chilled for several hours, but did not set up at all. I followed the recipe exactly, other than whisking the egg whites before adding them to the blender, but it didn't help. It reminded me of what you find at the bottom of a mug of hot cocoa - a runny chocolate mess.

Hmm. Not sure if I was doing something wrong or my expectations of chocolate mousse are different from other people's but I wasn't thrilled with this. I followed the recipe precisely I thought, I liked the idea of just blending everything rather than melting chocolate in a bane marie as I normally would. It was all fine but after leaving it in the fridge for an hour I pulled out something very solid that was little different than the bar of chocolate I melted. I didn't expect to have to cut it out with a knife and fork! I tried remelting it and adding some cream which helped a little. Maybe if I whisked the egg whites beforehand that would help. Not as good as other recipes I have tried, though I liked the lemon cream with it.

soooooo good and easy. It is very rich and dark (a plus in our books). The only change I made was folding some sugar into the lemon cream. It was so easy (and it set perfectly in 2 hours for me)and yummmmy. Even my 2 year old loved it.

Everyone loved this light and flavorful dessert. Truly 10 mins. to make. Set up perfectly. The only change was I slightly frothed the egg whites before adding to the Ghirardelli chocolate 1/2 &1/2 semi-sweet and bitter sweet. That may have made the difference. I'll make this a hundred times more.

Really yummy! I have made this twice now and serve it with assorted cookies. Simple, easy (about 30 minutes), gourmet. I will warn you, the second time I made it, it took FOREVER to set up, and did not like traveling. I finally froze it and it was a yummy save.

This dessert is very easy to make, and has a delicious flavor, I found that it did not firm up satisfactorily after two hours or after eight hours. The top of the mousse was firm enough, but the mousse in the lower portion of the bowl was almost a liquid consistency. There are too many other good recipes for chocolate mousse to bother with this one.

A super-easy recipe that has great texture and taste. I added the whites as the recipe said, but I could see how whisking them separately could help with the volume of the mousse. I made the recipe in the morning, and let it sit in the fridge for almost 14 hours and it was still great. (Just wanted to put that in, because I was wondering myself if this would affect it prior to making the recipe)

excellent -- tastes light and refreshing and the lemon cream elevates both the taste and the presentation. It doesn't taste like something that is so easy to make.

This is one of the best desserts for chocolate mousse lovers. It is so light and lovely, much better than the average whipping cream mouse. I highly recommend this. I did make some changes as well; I used a chocolate crumb crust, grand marnier and contreu as well as orange zest. YUMMY~~Plus I added some cocoa powder and the taste was out of this world!

Hello? This recipe is made with RAW egg whites! Be sure to use pasteurized eggs such as Davidson's, which are readily available at Jewel and Dominick's stores and other outlets (NOT Egg Beaters). While the risk of salmonella is small, do you really want to chance it with your family and guests?

WOW - I haven't ever made a dessert so easily. It really is just stick it all in the blender and go. Make sure to let it chill for enough time. It is superb.

I've made this twice so far, and it turned out perfect both times. I use half bittersweet and half semisweet. If you double the recipe, it fills 12 cupcake tins perfectly. I use the heavy-duty foil liners and serve them in those. I also froze one, and when I thawed it a week later, it was still perfect.

Just a note to those of you who might be trying variations using milk instead of coffee. After my first batch I couldn't get the mousse to firm up again. Finally I discovered that the milk needed to be warm. Don't know if this was perhaps also the issue with the cook who tried other types of chip flavors. I'm wanting to experiment now too!

This was wonderful and so easy! I did not whip the egg whites separately and thought the texture was delightful. I don't like coffee at all so substituted the coffee/water for milk (ff, lactose free, specifically). That worked out very nicely, though in the future I will eliminate the sugar. I used semisweet chips and that provided plenty of sweetness.

The magic of this recipe is what differentiates it from other very good chocolate mousse desserts in that the egg whites need not be whipped. I used grated orange peel and fresh orange juice. Next time I will use Grand Marnier in the whipping cream or may try it in the chocolate. A truly lovely dessert!

Still awesome - but does not work with white chocolate morsels! Nor does it work with butterscotch - the mousse solidifies only with chocolate morsels (in my experience, at least!). Have no idea why....

I have made this fantastic dessert so many times - quick and easy. I use leftover coffee and even omit the sugar. Fresh fruit as a garnish to top it off Low cal and delicious

This recipe was great! So quick and simple, I did follow others advice and whipped the egg whites separately, then folded them in. The texture was great. The lemon cream and dark chocolate was a delicious combination.

Rating: 4
Absolutely divine and so easy to make. It was a little sweet with the semisweet chocolate, so maybe I would use bittersweet next time. And instead of lemon, I used orange, which was really good. It's also a very forgiving recipe.

Loved it. Have made it a couple of times now. So easy and quick; going to try it with white chocolate tonight!

very rich and tasty, and very easy to make! I topped the mousse with fresh raspberries instead of the cream and it was a perfect combination.

overall this recipe was easy and yielded a nice result. as another reviewer recommended, i beat the egg whites separately and folded them in to get a light, airy mousse. i would recommend using confectioner's sugar in the lemon cream, instead of granulated sugar. i might try a different kind of whipped cream topping too, maybe using calvados or another liquer instead of the lemon flavoring, though it is nice.

Really enjoyed this mousse. While the recipe didn't look delicious to me - I tried it just because it was simple. Oranges with chocolate I'd heard of, lemon I hadn't. I was wrong. It was outstanding. Husband loved it. I loved it. Easy and great tasting. A real winner.

This was just delicious and incredibly easy to make. I followed the previous reviewer suggestion and beat the eggs separately then folded them into the chocolate mixture. Used bittersweet chocolate. Fantastic!

Not the real deal, but SOOO easy to make. My blender didn't produce a light enough texture, but that would be my only complaint. Next time I will try beating the egg whites separately and fold them in. It was still delicious!

Loved this recipe!! as did my discerning husband and teenage daughter. My Belgian mom, who made the authentic version and have rearely tasted one that rivalled hers, would have loved it too. I must admit though I used callebaut chocolate (darK) and substitued the 3/4 c. of water and instant coffee for 3/4 c. of espresso from our espresso maker but will definitley make this again and again!

My Belgian mom made "the" best authentic mousse au chocolat and I've been trying to find one that came close ~ THIS one has! Even my discerning husband and teenage daughter loved it. The consistency and flavour are excellent (and 10 x easier to make than the "home version"). I must admit though I used chopped up dark callebaut chocolate and we have an espresso maker by which I substituted the 3/4 c. water and instant coffee for 3/4 c. of espresso. Will definitely make this again and again (and will try it the original way too :)
