I agree with the first reviewer. The pastry is not great. I had this desert in Argentina and it was to die for and I am determined to re-create it. Does anyone have a suggestion regarding the pastry and how to improve it? I know the heart of this is the Dulce-de- Leche but I would like the pastry to taste less like cardboard:)

I must have done something wrong regarding the pastry... I thought I followed the instructions pretty well, but it came out dense and not very tasty. I'm letting it sit with the dulce de leche in hopes that the caramel goodness will out-weigh the disappointing pastry. Maybe I'll try it again....
