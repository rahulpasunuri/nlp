I made this for my Pittsburgh based in-law family at Thanksgiving. My family is originally from Baltimore, so was a great opportunity to mix Italian and German traditions. This turned out to be a milder sauerkraut than what I am used to, but was perfect for introducing sauerkraut to the Thanksgiving table.

I made this recipe for our Christmas Eve smorgasbord dinner. We served Swedish meatballs, poached salmon, and a variety of side dishes. This was a very tasty variation for saukerkraut, and it was easy to make. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I moved to Annapolis, MD about 8 years ago and heard the natives talking about serving sauerkraut with their tradional Thanksgiving dinner. I never really thought much about it until I read the article that accompanies this recipe. I just had to try it! It was wonderful, went well with turkey and everyone loved it. I will definately make this again next year.

An unusual recipe, that's for sure -- I told my husband to think of it as a sauerkraut martini as he watched it simmering. I absolutely loved the final product, but recommend you serve it to people who already know they like sauerkraut. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving (minus the butter). I just wanted to say how much I loved the article in this month's magazine. I'm from Baltimore, have always had sauerkraut at Thanksgiving and distinctly remember my "Everybody doesn't have sauerkraut??" moment.
