Another hit for epicurious! We absolutely love this salad. It is so refreshing, I make it over and over again until I can't find blood oranges. It has become our family favorite.

So delicious! I made this with ruby grapefruit, navel oranges, and sliced starfruit. It was as beautiful as it was tasty. The star anise is a must.

So simple and delicious! I couldn't find any blood oranges, so I used navel oranges and it was great. The syrup just added that little something special to dress up the bright citrus of the season. Will definitely make this again and again.

This is great! I used pink grapefruit and oranges, much less than the recipe called for so there was more syrup; I wanted it to be a little bit sweeter. Great for brunch and the leftovers were even better.

This is AWESOME. I didn't have grapefruit, so I used oranges and canned pineapple. If I do this again, I'd use slightly less sugar- I think the pineapple makes it much sweeter than if I'd used grapefruit. However, it was incredibly easy, cheap, and a million times better than any boxed or prepared dessert I've ever tried.

My mother made this recipe and it was fabulous. It is better the next day. The whole family loved it. I have also made it with Mandarin oranges and it's wonderful. I didn't have any star anise on hand so I used anise seed and a pinch of allspice. Not the same but still great.

Wasn't able to find the star anise, but even using a simple syrup, this was a great inclusion for the Xmas brunch.

I made this twice his season, and it's lovely. I substituted mandarin oranges for blood oranges, but will try again when I find them. I'll bet you could vary the citrus used. The anise flavor spiced up the fruit nicely, though I did add a touch of anise extract the second time to up the flavor.
