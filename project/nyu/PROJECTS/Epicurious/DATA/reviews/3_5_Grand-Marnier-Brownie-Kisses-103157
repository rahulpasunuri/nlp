I have made these numerous times. Everyone loves them.Decadent. They freeze well too.

These are wonderful, with a nice balance of orange flavor. Not too overwhelming, and the chocolate not too dark...but then again, I used semisweet chocolate in the ganache. Best when left at a comfortable room temperature for about an hour. However, I found nothing "brownie-like" about these. They were more of a tort-like consistency, so if you're looking for a fluffy-fudgy brownie, this probably wouldn't be it.

These are very good, extremely dense & rich. I'm not sure I'd call these brownies - they are more like a chocolate torte. I didn't have an 8X8 metal pan, so I used a heavy 9" round metal pan to get the same area. They were done in 30 minutes. These would be good with a dab of whipped cream or creme anglaise on the side.

Excellent brownie! Taste almost like a truffle. Adults love these. Children don't seem to like these.

Very sweet, but delicious and easy. I melt my chocolate in the microwave on 50% power; do people still use the double boiler method? (Serious question, because I would like to know if there is something I am missing.) I ended up not making the ganache, because I still had frosting left over from the orange- buttercream devil's food cake from this site that I made a week ago. Was perfect!

Yum! Fudgy with a great orange flavor. I doubled the recipe and it turned out just fine (though I kept the Grand Marnier at 5 tablespoons rather than 6).

5 out of 5 physios agree...these are great! And I think I added a little less GM than the recipe called for. They were still delish. And easy!

Truly sophisticated and excellent.

Easy and excellent! Used unsweetened choc in the brownie and semi-sweet in the frosting. I cut them into bite-sized squares - people couldn't get enough! Will definitely be making these again.

These are the BEST gourmet brownies! They are rich and wonderful (even full of Grand Marnier flavor) which is why they are served in a "kiss" size serving. A friend even mentioned they are more like a truffle rather than a brownie. Have a cigarette ready after you eat one of these.

I hosted a dessert buffet and made several mini desserts. The day of the party I decided to make one more dessert and made these brownies - they ended up being everyone's favorite dessert! A tiny piece is all you need for a choco fix - so deliciously rich! This is a keeper!

I love cooking...besides the simplicity of this recipe it was not that great one I had hoped for. And as for the taste test factor....only 2 out of 10 of my guests liked it! YIKES!!

It was extremely fudgy and the recipe suggest using bittersweet or semisweet. So depending on one's tase one can decide. I am one for sweets so I chose to use the semisweet chocolate and it was delicious. I took them to a party and they were a hit. They were even successful with my friend's five years old daughter who is an extremely picky eater.

There was too much Grand Marnier in the frosting. Also, I used bittersweet chocolate and it was VERY bitter with the orange and Grand Marnier. The brownie was good but I would change the frosting.

The combination of flavors was good, but the brownie was more cake like (rather than fudgy). Probably won't make again

Chocolate and orange together are to die for and these brownies are the ULTIMATE! Made these for an office party and they disappered within minutes! They earned rave reviews from the group. The only change that I would make is to add butter to the topping to add a sheen to the chocolate. Just to let you know that the recipe doubles very nicely. A single batch won't last!

A friend of mine made these at a dinner party and they were wonderful! A great combination of chocolate, orange and grand marnier. As soon as I got home I copies the recipe off epicurious to make in the future. They were a nice change from the "typical" brownie!

These brownies are VERY rich. I love the combo of chocolate and orange, but even for someone who loves sweets and can handle pretty rich things, they were a bit much.

I thought these were yummy. They seemed to be a big hit at the meeting to which I took them, but one person did say they were too chocolatey for his taste. I personally don't think there is any such thing.
