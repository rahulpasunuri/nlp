This recipe would be just great with a spicy cocktail sauce- and it's a little healthier than the remoulade.

This recipe mimics almost exactly the flavour of the boiled shrimp at Summer Shack. If you love those (as I do), try this recipe. If you can get Stonington shrimp, be careful to not overcook them, as they are already red and don't change colour when you steam them.

Such a lovely, simple dish. I used Red Stripe beer, and it was great- not too overpowering, but a bit more complex and even a bit sweeter than your typical American lager. It took no time at all. We had it with spinach, sauteed with garlic, shallots, olive oil and another splash of Red Stripe. My husband loved it and found it filling, which is great because this is so healthy and light. Would be a great, casual meal to enjoy with friends who don't mind rolling up their sleeves and peeling some shrimp.

Incredibly good...reminded me of a marinated shrimp recipe (served chilled) that was made with similar ingredients. Don't worry about making too much...it is even better the next day cold! I would almost even consider making it and chilling it for a summer meal.

I made the shrimp for our Academy Awards dinner tonight, and they are super good. I used Bass Ale to steam them in and left out the Old Bay seasoning and bay leaf because I didn't have them.Very delicious, nonetheless. I had to restrain myself from eating them in advance! I didn't use the remoulade sauce recipe because I already have one. I wish I could think of a use for the beer/vinegar liquid they were cooked in. Any ideas?

This is one of my favorite recipes. I have made it many times for different parties and this is always a favorite. The rémoulade is great and didn't taste like 1000 island dressing at all. I will continue to make this recipe over and over. It is very popular in our family and with our friends.

Shrimp had nice flavor, but they were a little bland and I learned that my husband and son don't like eating shrimp with shells. The shrimp looked professional. I agree with the prior reviewer that said that the remoulade tasted a lot like Thousand Island dressing. Based on the preceding (and the fact that I have a number of other shrimp recipes that we far prefer), I won't be making this recipe again.

We loved this recipe!! Didn't change a thing. Do try the Remoulade sauce - we thought it was perfect for the shrimp!

I have made this recipe several times, and gotten raves each and every time. It is simple and very flavorful, and fun to eat. The folks at my house actually do like the remoulade sauce.

This dish would have been good had I not used the remoulade sauce. The sauce tasted like thousand island dressing, my husband agreed. If I ever make this dish again I will skip the sauce and simply put the shrimp over rice, and add a few broccoli florets. I also added ginger to the shrimp marinade which gave it a nice zip.
