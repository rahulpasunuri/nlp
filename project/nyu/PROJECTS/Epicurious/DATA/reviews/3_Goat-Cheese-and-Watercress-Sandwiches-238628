Friends made this for my bridal shower. I admit, I was a little skeptical because, well... the walnut-coated edges sounded a bit weird (I'm not a huge walnut fan) and I was afraid that it could be a messy affair to try to assemble and eat. Turns out, these were delicious. Far more delicious than the typical cucumber/dill/cream cheese tea sandwiches that are served for tea. There were a couple of changes made to the ingredients: 1) cinnamon-raisin bread; 2) candied walnuts. If I make these myself, I'd probably add more watercress since I like the way it tastes, and would offset the candied walnuts, but overall, tasty!

Sounds delish, but, um, make sure the chevre is pasteurized, as non-pasteurized cheese is verboten for pregnant women. Kimberly, it's in very poor taste to poison the guests of honor.
