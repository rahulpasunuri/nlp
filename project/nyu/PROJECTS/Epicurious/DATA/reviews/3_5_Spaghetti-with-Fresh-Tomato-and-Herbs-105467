I was fully intending to follow this recipe exactly, but then I found that I didn't have any ricotta left. So I increase the pasrmesan a bit. I also used healthy whole wheat spaghetti, and it turned out fantastic. Even my children, who are not into the healthy food craze, loved it.

Really disappointing, and I followed the directions exactly except had no fresh marjoram. I don't like the consistency or the flavor of the ricotta salata.

Very easy to make and a nice change from traditional spaghetti! This will be added to our family's summer rotation.

I was a bit short on ingredients so I used dry Herbs and Mozzarella instead of Riccota. Still turned out delicious. For some reason I really enjoyed peeling the tomatoes??

Used tomatoes and herbs straight from the garden. Be sure to use the mint as it gives interest. This dish was yummy and received rave reviews from my family.

Didn't deseed or skin the tomatoes why bother. Loved this dish espcially the ricotta salada cheese never tried it before loved it. Used Basil, thyme and rosemary

Although this recipe was a little more labor intensive than I had anticipated, it was worth the effort. I used Italian oregano, marjoram and basil for the herbs. Wonderful and fresh tasting! I would give this recipe 3 and a half forks!

Delicious and easy. What a great way to use your herb garden! Instead of spearmint and tarragon I used basil, marjoram, oregano and soft thyme. Truly yummy. 'Nuff said. Will definitely make again.
