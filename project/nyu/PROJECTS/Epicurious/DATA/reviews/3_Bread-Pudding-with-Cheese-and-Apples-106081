I'm not sure I understand the most recent review. I don't find milk in this recipe. I think it would have been much better if it had milk & eggs, however. As it was, the bread was just a soggy mess. The flavor was o.k., but neither my husband nor I liked the texture.

I used eggnog instead of milk & vanilla (I had some Silk Nog on hand), and substituted an apple for the raisins. Splendid.

I served this warm and topped it with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream for the last course of a 4th of July brunch. Rave reviews. Next time, however, I will trim the crusts from the bread. I will also add an additional 5 minutes to the bake time.

We had this for brunch on Christmas day and it was fantastic. It made a wonderful change to a meal that has been the same for years. I recommend it for any brunch.
