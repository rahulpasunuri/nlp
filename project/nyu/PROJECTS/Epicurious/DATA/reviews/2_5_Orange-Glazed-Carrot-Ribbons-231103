These are beautiful. Skip the first step of cooking the carrots. Just cook them in the sauce and they turn out perfectly. Yes, it takes time to peel them, but if you want a different presentation, it's worth it.

Cutting the carrots this way took 500 man hours to complete and then it tasted terrible. Two thumbs down.

I think this is close to a 4 forker. I never cook the carrots first. Instead I cook them in the OJ mixture. The presentation is beautiful and they taste delicious!

This was an awful dish. I loved cook carrots but the sauce was so overwhleming and sweet that it made the carrots taste horrible. I even reduced the amount of sauce per suggestions from others. Will definitely not ruin carrots again by making this dish.

This is a beautiful and tasty side dish. Perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. It is better if you can get pretty fat carrots for a nice looking ribbon. Be careful not to overcook the carrots, you want them softened but still with a little crunch.

My family and I loved this. I did cut down on the OJ and it was perfect. Am doing again for a dinner party next week.

I cut the blanching time to about one minute, then stopped the cooking process by plunging into ice water, draining and gently patting dry. Stored in the fridge until ready to put into the sauce. I did not have a mandolin to make the slices, so I used a little gadget sort of like a pencil sharpener and made spirals. They kept their shape, were crisp and a real hit. I am using them again this year for a formal sit down dinner.

What is this? My peeler actually worked out pretty well, but after the boiling process - Mush. I also used fresh orange juice but in the end it was extremely over powering and it took forever for me to cut it. Most of the reviews say how pretty this is. I guess if you can get it pretty, and pretty is what you're going for, this would be for you.

I liked the flavors of these carrots. However, there was too much liquid in the bottom of my pan that the carrots just dripped when taken out of the pan. Next time, either double the amount of carrots for that amount of OJ or half the amount of OJ for the same amount of carrots.

I agree with the mandoline advice! I just cut into diagonal slices and checked for fork-tender when boiling. Used olive oil in lieu of butter. Omitted chives without problem. Really good dish!

Made this dish at Christmas and even the "gourmands" in the family loved it. I've made it 2 times - once with a mandoline and once with the peeler. Both ways worked well!

I think I would reduce the sauce down even more next time. There seemed to be a lot of extra in the bottom of the bowl. I like the idea of adding ginger as well.

While a visually appealing dish, there wasn't much flavor. Try adding .5t ground ginger and 1.5t grated lemon peel, or instead, a little Tabasco.

Shaving the carrots with a potato peeler was difficult and it took a lot of time for something that turned into mush. But it was very tasty mush.

WOnderful and more interesting way to serve the ole' carrot fare. I used fresh sqeezed orange juice in the recipe, although, I don't think you have to go to the trouble to get the same results. One suggestion, use a wide peeler, and find the largest carrots you can for a 'fatter' ribbon. It was just a beautiful dish. All our Thanksgiving guested loved them!

Not terrible, but it didn't complement our Thanksgiving turkey well, and the leftovers haven't gone well with anything we've tried them with.

I think these are great. I loved the presentation, and I agree, experiment with the juice flavor.

Vegetable peeler didn't do the job. Had to use the mandoline. All my guests enjoyed them, but I found it a bit too much trouble for the end result.

I've made this a couple of times to great reviews. The guests at our last dinner party were raving about it. Couple of suggestions: I used a mandoline instead of a peeler to speed up the process. You can try substituting more exotic juices, as I did. The color is perfect for fall meals.

I made this forfor 22 people and used a mandolin rather than a vegetable peeler. I first precooked them as said, but found they were too mushy. I just cooked them in a syrup made with all the ingredients. I tied one strand into a knot and garnished it with a spring of parsley. Very pretty and tasty,
