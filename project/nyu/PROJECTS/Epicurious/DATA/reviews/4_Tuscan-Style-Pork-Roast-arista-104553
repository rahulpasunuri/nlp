I have had a similar dish in Florence and in Waltham MA at the Tuscan Grill. This dish is delicious - I do cut the salt by 1/2 tsp from what Ina suggests. I don't find that the amount Ina suggests is inedible I just prefer it to taste a little less salty.

My roast was 6 lbs, and I could have easily doubled, and perhaps tripled the amount of salt and rosemary. I think a little olive oil is a good addition to the mix as well.

I used a 6# boneless loin and added 2 more garlic cloves and a handful of currants. Served 20 people for a holiday dinner. Beautiful, delicious, easy, and economical.

This has become our favorite preparation for roast pork. Simple to make and very flavorful it's a winner every time!

I have made this recipe three or four times before and it was always delicious. This time I marinated the roast overnight and it was sublime! I start the roast at 450ºF for 15 minutes and finish at 350ºF. A 6lb roast takes about 90 minutes to reach 160ºF

This was fantastic; and so simple. I added some onions and peppers in the pan with a little oil and wine for cooking and that added some extra flavor as well. Great at dinner as well as a good sandwich with the cooked onions.

An excellent and easy recipe, it also works well with quality loin chops and less marinading. Also good to cook with an assortment of vegetables (japanese turnip, chard, carrots, etc) in the same pan - make more marinade and drizzle over the vegetables.

Added 1/4 C red wine to the fresh rosemary and garlic cloves to process in the mini blender instead of mincing. Tucked the leftovers inside and came out exquisite. Will try overnight prep next time.

This is absolutely fantastic. It looks like, and is, a VERY simple recipe, but it is definitely worth trying. My husband and I honeymooned in Italy and while in Florence went to a little place called Coco Lezone. I got the roasted pork and this recipe remindes me EXACTLY of that meal. Make this recipe. Your family and friends will thank you.

Really delicious. I marinated the pork overnight and it turned out amazing. The garlic inside the meat was a bit raw, but no one complained.

Lovely recipe. I have made this a few times and vary spices and herbs. Also lovely as a leftover -cold cut with some good cheese and chutney. My tip: Mix some good djon mustard maybe even with estragon to the mixture and marinate over night. To give it a nice colour I quickly char the meat from all sides in a cast iron pot on a high heat before transferring it into the oven to finish on a low heat. Tip if you stuff garlic into your roast: Bake the whole garlic onion with the top of the onion cut of and drizzled with some olive oil in the oven on 180C for about 20 min. beforehand. The soft garlic mush will have a almost sweet taste and will work fantastic inside the roast mixed with herbs.

I used an inexpensive shoulder cut for this & added the mixture to the middle. I also added mustard on the top of the meat which was from other recipes --- This is unbelievably delicious.... Highly recommended recipe.

Excellent meal for the whole family. I used a little water and white cooking wine to make a nice sauce for the pork with the onions and potatoes that roasted with the pork. Whole house smelled delicious...

add 1-1/2T coarse fresh ground pepper in food processor. Also cover entire roast with mixture. Brown top in skillet or roaster on gas grill. 2-1/2 lb roast took 1:45 H to get to 160F. Grill temp was reading 425F. I used a 12" skillet with a round rack. After browning roast and placing on rack I put 8oz. diced onion under roast and covered with three cups of apple cider as needed to create "gravy" YYYYYUUUMMM!

I made this with a boneless roast since I already had one in my refrigerator. The pork was wonderful and there was nice rosemary flavor throughout ( I marinated it for 6 hours). One problem, I found that the garlic in the stuffing was still raw when I cut into the pork. In the future, maybe I'll saute the garlic slightly before making the stuffing mixture.

Very simple and excellent recipe. The only thing I chaged was to add a little olive oil to the marinade. I did not remove the rib bones. Instead, I generously rubbed the marinade in between the rib bones. After roasting, I simply cut the bones away and in addition to the loin, we ate the ribs too. They were sublime. I suggest if you find the rosemary and garlic a bit too strong in the quantities suggested, try briefly sauteeing them so that the flavors soften. I used coarse sea salt and thought the amount was perfect. I also added fingerling potatoes to the bottom of the pan in the last 40 minutes and they were heavenly. I usually brine pork roasts, but with this method, found that it was juicy, tender and really flavorful.

I've made this a number of times now and it is always fantastic - you can increase the amount easily, just plan on one rib per person. I also sear the meat briefly before i roast it, but I wait to rub the outisde with the garlic mixture until I'm done searing it so that I don't burn the garlic. I do stuff it before I sear it, though.

I made it with a two and a half pound roast (5 ribs)and it was perfectly done in an hour and a half. For those who found it too salty, bear in mind that the recipe calls for sea salt. Sea salt doesn't taste as salty as table salt. I have made this roast using fennel seeds (about 1 Tb) instead of rosemary and it is equally delicious.

I'm going to try this recipe again and do it exactly as written because I think it *could be* a terrific way to prepare pork. However, I used only 1 teaspoon of salt because I was worried about the reviews that said the roast was too salty. For my tastes, a teaspoon just wasn't enough, and the pork (although quite juicy) was somewhat bland. Will try with the full amount of salt the next time.

My wife prepared this recipe tonight and it was absolutely awesome. She took a pork rib roast, bone-in, and didn't bother with having a butcher bone the roast, and then reassemble it with the meat and tie it up. But she did make a slit through the center of the loin and stuff it with rosemary, garlic and she added minced shallot. She said it was relatively easy, and that if she could do it, anybody could do it. Making the slit seemed daunting but turned out to be not as difficult as one might imagine. I made a homemade gravy from the drippings with a little flour-and-cold-water mixture, beer and chicken broth. We drizzled that over the pork and served it with Mashed Potato, Cheese and Chive Gratin (also on this site), corn on the cob and grilled vegetables and the dinner was deluxe. We would definitely do this one again.

We served this to dinner guests and it was excellent. A tad salty, though.

Really good. Added an anchovy to the rosemary, garlic & salt. mixture. Scored the top of the roast & pressed some of the rosemary mixture into the crosshatching. Browned in a heavy pan before roasting it in the same pan. Added a half cup of white wine to the pan a half hour before serving. Served with roast Acorn Squash & Roast Cauliflower. Very good! will absolutely do this one again.

I made it without bones for a large party, couldn't afford the space. I used less salt per recommendations which allowed me to put the juices that accumulated in the pan to work as a sauce. Pork was exquisitely juicy and flavorful, served with the Tuscan beans!!! I will most definitely make it again.

My husband and I found this *very* salty, both the crust and internally because of the stuffing. We don't tend to cook with a lot of salt, so maybe that is why we noticed it when other reviewers haven't mentioned it. Next time I would use half as much salt and mix the rosemary and garlic and salt with olive oil for the top; I used a boneless pork roast, so there's not much fat and the spices started to burn until I oiled the roast. Worth trying again.

Made this as the main course for a Mediterranean themed dinner party with a fig chutney and it was a huge success. It was so simple to prepare but was delicious. It was excellent served the next day on garlic bread for lunch.

Made this for my favorite group of recipe guinea pigs and they adored it! I ran out of rosemary and made up the remainder with Italian herb mix, used Kosher salt and increased the amount. Served it with mashed potatoes and a green salad. Roast came out suculent and flavorful. Definitly my new standard way of cooking pork roast!

This is one of my favorite ways to cook a Pork Roast. I usually use some fennel seed ground with the herb stuffing, tho, for a more authentic "Arista"

This was fabulous and simple. I had to use an end section but it was still tender and the filling is a perfect compliment. I'll be making this again in a week for a formal dinner party.

The simplicity of the preparation and flavor of this recipe make it a perfect answer for serving groups of 6 or more because the recipe increases quite easily. Just keep an close eye on the temperature of the meat to know when it is done, not the timer! I would however, recommend, browning the roast in a pan on the stove prior to putting them in the oven. Getting the outside to a golden brown in spots helps to seal in some of the juices and keep the roast moist, something that is not always so easy with pork!

Killer pork roast recipe! Very succulent, aromatic, juicy, and tender. I cut back on the fresh rosemary to one TBS, and it was just right for my family.

Very delicious recipe. I grilled my roast for 5 min. on each side on high heat. Then used the oven for the rest of the cooking...had it with Chilean Viña Montes Malbec 2000.

Everyone enjoyed this dish. We used a somewhat heavy hand with the herbs and roasted it in the oven. It was quick,easy and delicious and the 15 year old's favorite part of the meal. We'll make this again.

Yet another great recipe for pork roast. I made this entree in the oven on July 4, given that it was pretty cold outside. (Here in Oregon, that happens.) It took about 45 minutes longer to reach 155. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and a nice tuscan vino rosso, it was wonderful.

This was fabulous.....and so easy! I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and had the butcher crack the ribs leaving the meat attached, but I cooked it in the oven. My 10 dinner guests (I did two pork loins) gave this rave reviews. And it smelled wonderful while it was cooking. Definitely a repeater.

Fantastic recipe, although I did vary the prep a little bit. I had my butcher crack all the ribs so that I could cut through them, but left the meat attached. That way, I could serve each diner an entire, bone-in chop. I then brined the pork roast in 1 gallon water, 1 cup salt, 1 cup brown sugar, bay leaves and peppercorns for about 3 hours. Dried well, and prepared according to recipe. The I cooked the roast in my gas weber grill at 425* for two hours, creating some smoke with soaked wood chips wrapped in foil. Let rest 15 minutes. What flavor! I highly recommend the grill method to create a truly different taste.
