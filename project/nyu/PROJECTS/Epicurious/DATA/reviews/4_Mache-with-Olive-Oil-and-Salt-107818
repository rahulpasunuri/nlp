Yum! I used just baby spinach. What a wonderful salad! This recipe is a keeper and will be a standard for me from now on.

I also like this with just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice after I have tossed the mache with the olive oil.

Delicate and quite wonderful. Perfect as a last course for a French meal. Trader Joe's carries the lamb's lettuce in convenient bags.
