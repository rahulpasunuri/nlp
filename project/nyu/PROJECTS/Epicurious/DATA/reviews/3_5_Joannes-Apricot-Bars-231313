I have been making this recipe exactly as written ever since it was first published. I always get rave reviews and every last crumb is devoured. Love it!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, so I'm not giving this a fork rating. I made a gingersnap cookie crust instead of shortbread, but otherwise followed the recipe. I chopped each apricot into 6 pieces, but I think they were too big - I'd chop them much smaller next time. Otherwise, these were simple and tasty, but not particularly memorable.

I agree with previous reviewers that 1) The apricots should not be boiled, and I minced them rather than halved them. 2) That a layer of jam, I used raspberry, should be spread between the shortbread layer and the apricot layer. 3) I used a 7 x 11 pan (the 8 x 8 pan produced very thick pieces), lined it with parchment, and left enough on each end so I could lift it out of the pan. 4) Wait until it's completely cooled before you cut it. 5) I added the chopped walnuts on top of the apricot layer rather than mixing them into the apricot layer. Will definitely be making this again.

Very easy to make, the short bread base required less cooking than the recipe stated, but very yummy! I always line my tins with baking parchment so no problems with sticking and they sliced really well.

As suggested, I baked the shortbread for the minimum amount of time, until it was barely browning. After it cooled a bit, I covered it with a ginger marmalade, then the apricot mixture. I was able to get the whole thing out of the 8x8 metal pan I baked it in, with just one edge sticking. It was tough to cut evenly, however, because of the sticky apricots (which I had boiled in triple sec). I agree that this needs a little something more between the layers. The flavors are pleasant.

these came out very nicely. i baked them in a metal pan instead, and that was fine. also, i cooked the apricots in the microwave with a shot of brandy added to the water. i used slightly less brown sugar, more like 3/4 cups packed, but i think i can go up to 1 cup. i used a bit more salt, to bring out the flavor. i just threw the crust in the food processor, put it in the pan, and then put all the other ingredients in the food processor, because i'm lazy, and it came out fine. i pureed the apricots with the mixture, instead of leaving it in chunks. instead of toasting the walnuts, i just placed them on top of the mixture so they toast on their own and form a crust on the top. other than those minor changes ... ;) ... i followed the recipe and my husband loves them even though he's not a fan of apricots or dried apricots in particular

To make the bars more tangy, I spread a thin layer of apricot jam on top while they were still warm. Next time, I think I might put the jam over the shortbread crust before adding the cake layer. I also would not boil the apricots next time because the ones I used were very soft to begin with, and I think the boiling destroyed some of their flavor. I might also double the nuts as well since I always like more.

I found the exact same recipe for these apricot bars over 4 years ago on marthastewart.com. They're always a big hit whenever I make them. Even though my oven is calibrated correctly, 35 minutes is to long to bake the filling. The filling is usually set in 20-25 minutes.

Have made these twice, first time in an 8x11 dish and second time in an 8x8 dish. Turned out very well both times, though of course even better with the 8x8 dish. Neither time did they look anything like the picture, but they were still beautiful to look at once cut into bars with their cracked crust showing the gooey filling underneath. I used whole wheat flour the second time and they were just delicious. I am usually a chocoholic and would not make a "fruity" recipe but they are just SO good. Sweet in a fruity way as opposed to straight sugar sweet.

I used dried mangoes instead of apricots and the flavor was very good but I only give it two forks because it was very unappealing to look at, it was crumbly, and it stuck to the pan. I wonder if it would be better to line the pan with tin foil to alleviate that problem, however, it is still not appealing enough to put out on a dessert tray.

Fantastic! I made this for a party and got rave reviews. A definite do-again!

This was an awesome dish! A little bit gooey in the middle, but no complaints! I substituted dried mango and added some cashews to the shortbread and it turned out great!

These are wonderful! I made them for an event and everybody loved them, Do wait until they cool totally before you cut them-much easier!

Excellent! Very easy to make!

These are wonderful! Very easy to make and delicious. Tend to be crumbly when you cut them, particularly in the middle, but very edible!

This is a versatile recipe and would be great as a part of a dessert buffet. Would work with a variety of fruit. Made with a mix of dried apricots and peaches, and for the holidays made with dried sweetened cranberries and cherries, and plumped up by simmering in rum. I added finely chopped toasted pecans to the shortbread layer. While the kids were going for the chocolate choices, the adults liked this one.
