My wife and I were in Wellfleet and dug our own clams for this recipe. The clams had just come out of the bay and straight into the pot, so we had high hopes and were very disappointed. Simple, yes, but also flavorless and boring. Salt with a hint of green pepper, parsley and celery, that is what you taste in a watery one-dimensional broth. Of course, the clams themselves were delicious, but what a waste of good clams. Save them for wine, garlic or a better a Manhattan clam chowder recipe. But if you want to salvage this recipe, add more potatoes, carrots, bay leaves, anything to add more body, sweetness for balance and interest.

Really excellent. Even though I cheated a little. Substituted some smoked clams for bacon for a meatless soup -- sauteed vegetables in olive oil and juice from the smoked clams and added in the clams themselves just long enough before serving to heat through. A huge hit. Will definitely make again.

I loved this. Yes, you better not reheat this or you will get tough and chewy clams. I may experiment with adding a bit of other veggies as some readers suggest. And a dash of fish sauce. But really, this is great as is.

Superb. Better not add too much pepper though

What? No carrots? I make this recipe with a few small carrots. I used Italian seasoning insted of parsley. I like my trinity/mirepoix browned so I cooked it with the bacon. Since I used turkey bacon, I added some olive oil and left out the potato.

Excellent! Really the perfect Manhattan chowder. I was raised by a New Englander, but I always preferred a tomato-based chowder (which is not to say I dislike the creamy variety). I increase the amounts by about 50% and it makes two BIG bowls, great for a really hearty lunch. For a slightly sweeter flavor, you can sub in red bell pepper and shallot for the green pepper and onion; this is my preferred method. Also delicious with mussels, and a splash of sherry added just before you put the liquids in.

Can substitute olive oil for bacon if you're a pescaterian/European vegetarian. I found that a shot of fish sauce was really helpful in giving that extra savory kick.

This came out excellently. I made part of it ahead as outlined. I wouldn't recommend making more than can be eaten in one sitting because it does not keep well, but it was delicious.

Quick, easy and delish! A nice change from New England clam chowder, which is what's predominant here. Will definitely make again.

Excellent! Only change that I made was to add a tsp. of red chili pepper flakes with the veggies for some spice!

Fast, delicious and healthy. I quadrupled most of the ingredients to make a family-sized serving, but I only tripled the amount of clam juice and added two small chopped cans (6 1/2 oz size) with its juice. I also kept the quantity of clams to about 2 lbs which seemed to be enough.

VERY GOOD. With a little extra potatoes, extra tomatoes, and celery-it's big enough for two. The recipe the way it is, is way too big for one! (depending on how big the person is, I guess)

Lovey!! Fast and easy. I spiced it up a bit with some cumin and rosemary and jalapeño sauteed along with the onion. And I added a splash of red wine and balsamic vinegar during the cooking. I had it by myself on a cold, lonely winter night. Now I'm eager to share it!

Actually it is worth and a half forks. I made this recipe and my family went nuts over it. The only thing I changed was instead of bacon I used chorizo, and added a little crushed red pepper. What I don't understand is why they would put out a recipe for just one serving though.

Easy to make and delicious. I used oven roasted tomatoes in addition to canned and the flavor was great. I will make this again for sure.

I made it once using the bacon, and didn't like the aftertaste the bacon added. I wouldn't make it with bacon again. However, the next time I made it I substituted proscuitto, and loved it! That made the recipe a real winner!

really very superb soup. i tripled the recipe (everything but the clams, which i doubled), thinking i could feed four, and i could have fed a small army, so do not be fooled by "dinner for one"-- this recipe yields quite a bit. that was fine for me tho, bc i got leftovers! i was surprised and delighted with the outcome.

I made this for my wife and I. I tripled the celery and bell pepper while doubling all else. Additionaly I added 1/2 tbs of garlic powder and a bit of tabasco. My wife who does not like Manhattan clam chowder loved this and took the left overs to work for her lunch. This was GREAT!!
