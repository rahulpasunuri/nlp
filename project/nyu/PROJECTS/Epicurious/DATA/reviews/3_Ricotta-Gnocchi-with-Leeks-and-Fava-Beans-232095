I took advantage of what we had in the farmers' market and added swiss chard instead of leeks. I also prefer not using so much butter so cooked the fava in olive oil instead. We thought it was very tasty!

Delicious! Added mint and some proscuitto on top.

This was OK. It just felt like something was missing - the leeks cried out for potatoes, the ricotta cried out for tomatoes, the fava beans hung around. I will try adding the leeks to potato gnocchi and have high hopes.

Delicious! I made this recipe to use up some of the ingredients that I had in the refrigerator. Wow, what a nice surprise, the sage butter is a bit greasy but very yummie. I did find that I had to increase and add some spices to compliment my taste buds but other than that it was a nice mid week dinner that I served with a Fennel gratin soup.

I made a double recipe for a dinner party about a month ago, it was lovely; although I think the butter saute finish was a litle greasy (even though I only used half the butter it called for and I am a butterholic). I saved some of the gnocchi mix to fill and cook a day and a half later for a lunch - it tasted fine but had turned a rather ghastly shade of grey. So don't make the paste too far ahead. All in all: good flavor, texture, my guests loved it and it was easy to make a few hours ahead (peeling favas, rolling gnocchi), leaving just a few minutes of you in the kitchen away from the guests.
