Pretty good. Ever used five spices before...has an interesting flavor to it. I sautéed the pork for about five minutes then placed in oven at 350 for 20 mins. Used a Thai chili sauce instead of preserves...added a 1/4 tablespoon of hot sesame oil to kick up the heat...overall pretty tasty. Served over steamed rice.

An even faster but tasty way to prepare for a weeknight dinner- marinate overnight (I changed the soy to tamari and reduced it to 1 tbsp for less salt). Brown both sides of entire lion in a bit of oil, roast in oven @400 until int temp is 145 (15-20min). Boil marinate in saucepan until thickened and serve sliced w/sauce!

Left the tenderloin whole and didn't dredge in flour. Seared it and then finished it in the oven while I prepared the sauce. Served with basmati rice and company loved it.

This is really great. I marinated the pork overnight and it was superb. The only thing I changed was Sicilian orange preserves instead of the apricot, it made more sense to me and was De-LISH. Definitely will make again - for company.

I used the ingredients as listed but grilled the pork tenderloins over charcoal, basting with some of the marinade as it cooked. I made the mushroom sauce seperately, sliced the tenderloins and served the sauce over it. My guests raved!

I was very hesitant of making this dish because of some of the previous reviews, but I'm sure glad I did. I used chinese plum sauce (which is common to usualy use when eating chinese roast duck) instead of the apricot preserves. At first, my husband and I both tried the pork prior to adding the 1/3 c plum sauce and we both concluded that this dish tasted altogether much better with the addition of the sauce.

Have been making this recipe for years, exactly as written. It is wonderful.

I love this recipe. The marinade is great. For the sauce I usually leave out the preserves and maybe use a splash of milk instead of cream. Otherwise, it is a delicious and fast way to prepare pork tenderloin.

My husband and I loved this recipe - its also good with chicken. I didn't have any 5 spice powder but I added about a tablespoon of ginger to the recipe. I would definitely make this recipe again - great for the bbq.

Fantastic when tweaked. Halved the soy sauce and added 2 tablespoons of vinegar, grated orange peel and coriander to marinade, no chili spice used. Seared tenderloin whole and baked until done. Sliced and served with apricot-brandy reduction (no mushrooms) as a sauce. Served with a Pinot Noir, although the Sancerre I served with my appetizer was a better match with the slightly sweet apricot sauce.

We agree with Nebraska - very good, really easy but not a dish we'll dream about later. We tried it since we wanted a pork tenderloin dish that did not need to marinate very long, and we both really like Asian flavours. Flavour was actually better than I expected but on the whole I found it a bit rich. Next time I'd see what could be done about that. But we work shifts and don't get too many dinners at home so with so many other recipes in the world (and so little time) I'm not sure whether there'll be a "next time" for this one.

Easy to make, pretty good - but not mind blowingly delicious. I was expecting more 'wow' from the reviews I read.

Tried this recipe out on my husband. We both loved it! Didn't have five spice and I threw some freshly chopped ginger in the marinade. Also saved time by slicing before marinading. Wonderful dish!

I'm quite a novice when it comes to the kitchen, but I've managed to navigate my way through this recipe twice. The first time, I thought it was delicious - the second time, I couldn't believe I had actually cooked a dish so incredible! To be honest, I'm not even sure what I did differently the second time. But I couldn't get enough of it, and neither could my Mom (which is saying A LOT). A fantastic recipe!

This recipe got high marks at my dinner party last night; however, I made an important modification. Kept the marinade and the sauce as written, but used Sheila Lukins "Tender Pork Tenderloin" recipe found on this site to sear and roast the pork. VERY tender and juicy!

Eight years ago I had been married less than a year and had ample time in my new home(Stockholm) to experiment with cooking ideas that had been on the back burner. I looked this recipe up today to show my daughter who is 7. I never thought it would be here. For those who liked the recipe, I'm pleased and for those who did not, I have learned some things to improve upon. Thank you for your feedback. Susan J. Fallon

It was delicious. I changed a few things based on what was available in my kitchen (no cream, different chinese spices, and bottled apricots instead of preserves) but it came out great. Very easy to make.

I am SHOCKED to hear that someone does not like this dish. Since I discovered it, about 5 years ago, it has become a favorite with friends and family. I always rely on it when looking for "oohs" and "aahs". So what if Asian cooking isn't "supposed to have" cream...it works in this one! Although I have learned to doctor it up a bit over the years it has never failed to satisfy. Hope you will give it a try, it is worth the work.

Is zero forks and option? This recipe was terible. The marinade may have even been okay on its own, but the sauce made my senses revolt. It wasn't even the cloying sweetness, which was sickening by the way, that I disagreed with so much, but the richness of the cream that I simply couldn't get over. It was totally inconsistent with the Asian origins of the recipe. Tell me...when was the last time you were in an Asian restaurant of any type and saw any type of dish that had any type of dairy product in it, much less a cream sauce. Even the French wouldn't put up with this.

I thought this was horrible--what a waste of nice pork and shiitakes! The jam was _way_ too sweet in here, and the cream didn't work at all! Also, even though I marinated for the full time, I couldn't taste any of the flavors in the marinade (which, btw, contains _five_-spice powder, not _Thai_ spices as the previous reviewer thought). Weird and a waste.

Rating: 4
Easy and excellent -- I'm still craving it, but of course there were no leftovers! I had to substitue portabellas for the shitakes because they were not available. I used leftover pork tenderloin, so I added the Thai spices to the sauce instead of the marinade.

My 10 year old son thought this wasn't just good, it was great. I made it without the mushrooms and had to use duck sauce instead of the apricot preserves. It was easy, delicious and very tender. Great dish for family and company. I think the oyster sauce is the key to the marinade.

WE've been making this dish since it first appeared in print, and the photocopy we've since made is pretty dog eared with perpetual use. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, so half the time we make it without, and it is still wonderful. The marinade is so good that we'll often cut up the tenderloin before marinating so as to expose more of it to the marinade.

This recipe was wonderful. The blend of flavors seems odd on paper, but is excellent on the table. I did not use the cream and it was still wonderful. Guests loved it. When preparing this disk for company, I would recommend browning the meat first and keeping it in the oven in a covered dish. The last bit of sauce preparation and reheating the medallions can be done at the last minute. Supurb!!

Absolutely succulent!!! The sauce is divine. Had no fresh oranges, but Tropicana did marvels! I cut down a bit on the cooking time, cause I like my tenderloin moist and tender, but the whole "palette" of flavours was superb. Thanks!

Good flavor. Loved the portabellas.

Mmmmm, this was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly (substituting chopped onion for the shallot) and thought it was perfect. The guest count increased the day of dinner, so I added thin sliced chops about 2 hours before cooking to the tenderloin that had already been marinating overnight and all were wonderful. Served it with jasmine rice and roasted asparagus. Smelled so good while cooking that neighbors actually asked what I had made!!

It was delicious!! I marinated the pork for about 4 hrs and it was long enough. The sauce was one of the best I have made. Served it with Risotto with Green Onions and Peas. Very nice meal.

When marinating, I use pineapple juice instead of orange. The tenderloin is cut into medallions, and marinated for several hours. I skip the browning step and place meat and marinate in a baking dish. When they are done, I use sauce sauce over steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. My 3 and 5 year old clean their plates. AND, we don't have the "clean your plate" rule in our house!

This was an excellent recipe! I served it with white rice and steamed green beans. I didn't cook it in the oven as previous reviewers had, I followed the recipe exactly as listed. Mangia!

We usually cook just for our family but I will plan a dinner party so that I can serve this dish. I was hesitant about the marinade because of the strong flavors but I followed the recipe to the teaspoon and it turned out a "perfection". Highly recommended to all with discriminating palates.

Very tasty dish. I marinated the pork overnight in a ziploc bag and it came out quite flavorful and incredibly tender. It does take time to saute the pork slices, so next time I would follow one cook and sear the meat and bake it in the oven. I only added 1 T. of apricot, but next time will add more. Needs to be sweeter to complement the pork flavor. Also, I thought the five-spice was a bit too strong so I will reduce that next time (I'm not a big fan of this spice, so others may like it the way it is). Steamed rice is a perfect side.

This recipe is very good, but very sweet. I'll make it again, but I will significantly reduce the amount of apricot preserves -- probably down to 1 tablespoon. The cream sauce works very well with the pork. This dish smells delicious when it is cooking!

This is a great recipe for a special night at home. We've made it several times for ourselves and for company and it's always wonderful. Be careful to buy five spice powder instead of five spice soup, a mistake we ALMOST made once. Overall, it's a hit with us!

This recipe was great. I made it for a dinner party. Although, I didn't want to be at the stove while the guests were arriving so I decided to leave the tenderloin whole. I seared it on the stove then baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes. I sliced it and served with the sauce. Great.
