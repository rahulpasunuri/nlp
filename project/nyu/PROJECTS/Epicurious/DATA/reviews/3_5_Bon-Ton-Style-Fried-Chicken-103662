I needed to cut this recipe in half since I was feeding only three people. For the marinade, I used approximately half the water but the full amount of the other ingredients which was a mistake since the chicken turned out a bit too salty. I also marinaded for 48 hours which I think was a good idea. I used nothing but thighs and had the meat-counter guy cut those in half since they were rather large, so the frying went really well. You don't need as much oil as the recipe calls for but you do need quite a lot. Use a large cast-iron skillet and put about 1½ inch of oil in it.

This was really excellent fried chicken! Moist, flavorful, and crispy. I reduced the cayenne in the coating because my kids don't like things very spicy, but the marinade gave it plenty of flavor and a hint of spice, so it was just perfect for all of us. This will be my standard fried chicken recipe from now on.

This fried chicken recipe never ceases to amaze me! The final product is great out of the oil and eaten fresh and hot, and it is just as delicious served cold the next day for a picnic! I do the recipe exactly as it is stated and it works. So many times, reviwers take a recipe and add to it, or subtract from it, or change it somehow. This is a recipe that does BEST if you do it per the original recipe!!

This fried chicken is so great. The only two recommendations I have is to not add the salt in the marinade and to pound the chicken so it fries more evenly. Everyone loved it. It has become a favorite at our home.

This chicken is juicy and delicious

The recipe is simply perfect. Slightly spicy, very crispy and so juicy (make sure to marinade for the 24 hours). I used the Accent and the chicken had great flavor and was not too salty. My friends gobbled it up. It was so good that I didn't even miss my usual marinade -- buttermilk.

This was great. I used 1 1/2 teaspoon salt for the flour and it was just right.Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I think I can hear my arteries hardening but delicious!

The most amazing fried chicken I have ever eaten. We have it once a month but, it is also great for making chicken wings. Once fried, simply sauce with a butter and hot sauce dressing!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The marinade was great. But I added some cumin,coriader and chilli powder to the flour mix to add a bit more zing. Being health and diet conscious, I baked it in the oven. The skin was crispy and the flesh tender, with HALF the FAT. Will definately do again

A little on the salty side for me, so I'll ease up on that next time. Otherwise, it was juicy, full of flavor and crispy enough to more than satiate my discriminating taste & appetite.

I've never in 16 years seen my wife eat fried chicken, but she gobbled this down! The crust (batter) is what makes this. Very light and crispy. However we marinated the chicken for 24 hours and it really didn't have that much taste. I'd suggest adding some tequila and lime to the mix, marinate for at least 24 hours and then follow the recipe. All in all, it's pretty good!

Have not tried the recipe,but in response to the requests for "Southern Secrets" for fried chicken, here goes. 1. You MUST have a seasoned, black iron skillet. I haven't had to try the new "preseasoned" Lodge skillets, but they might be worth a try. For real, you need the skillet. 2. Gasp, cover your face and heart. Fry the chicken in a mixture of bacon grease and butter. Don't fuss at me, just don't do it often, and do it right. 3. Soak the chicken in buttermilk. 4. Taste the flour mixture before you use it; make sure it's salty enough and add anything else you want to. 5. You only want the fat to come about half way up the chicken pieces. Crowding the pieces a little bit is fine; otherwise, the flour bits/fat will burn. 6. Don't cook too fast or too slowly. You want the fat to bubble around the chicken pretty merrily, but, again, you don't want it to burn. 7. Do not cover. If you do, moisture condenses and when you lift the lid, YOU will be burned.8.No space. Drain well. This is from my Mama.

This was really great fried chicken - and extremely juicy. The marinade was great - different but very delicious. The flavor and chicken texture come out great when marinade for the full 24 hours though so prepare the chicken a day or two before you're going to eat it.

The chicken was tender, juicy and crispy but I didn't care for the flavor the marinate left in the chicken. I'm going to stick to my good old fried chicken recipe. I don't fry chicken often and when I do, I want it to be a treat we really enjoy.

The best fried chicken....EVER! Be sure to take your time w/the marinade. IT is worth it!!!

Wonderful recipe. The chicken is extremely moist and the coating is crisp and flavorful. I fry the pieces carefully, a few at a time, at the recommended temperature and they all come out perfectly. ( I don't use the Accent) There are a lot of fried chicken recipes out there claiming to be the best - this one is as close as they come. Try it!

I love fried chicken, so when I saw this recipe I just had to try it. The only thing I did differently was I marinaded it for 48 hours. It was a hit with all my friends at work. I'll keep looking for more fried chicken recipies, but this one is fantastic.

My Family's Recipe from GEORGIA)has similar ingredients... pieces of chicken sold separately are just too big, have the butcher cut up 2 fryers for smaller, more manageable pieces. We use 1/4 coarse salt + 1 Quart Buttermilk + 1/4 cup Tabasco for the marinade (24 hours)...add 2TBS. Baking Powder to the Flour/Seasoning mix, and dredge. The baking powder is what makes the crust good! We use the drippings from 1/2 Lb. of bacon and the rest Wesson Oil. The oil MUST be hot (370) and you MUST let the dredged pieces sit 5 minutes to rest before frying.It's a great OLD SOUTHERN recipe!Always delicious!

I love to make fried chicken, and I also love Asian fried chicken recipes. This was just average. Kind of salty, not a good balance of flavors, and the batter was thin. I'm sticking to regular fried chicken: egg wash, flour seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne. Marinate chicken in salt water brine for several hours before dipping in egg wash, then seasoned flour. Use hot oil then turn down heat immediately, cover, fry 5 min each side low heat covered, then remove cover and fry at med/med hi heat until golden brown.

Two forks, with a caveat. On the one, this ain't much more than the same old, same old for fried chix; on the other, the recipe leaves room for creativity. For the marinade, I'd add oregano, a dash of Magyar Paprika, definitely go with the fresh chopped garlic, other fresh herbs (rosemary); add some white distilled vinegar; and make sure to add some veg oil. Marinate for 24-36. For the dredge, use your imagination. On the down side, we all know that real fried chix needs buttermilk. Calling all Sudners! Bottom line: fine, as spicy as you want, but not anything special. For the real thing, go Dixie.

Sometimes you want food that's good for your soul, rather than your heart-- and this counts. I agree with the New England cook-- lots of buttery mashed potatoes to go along with it. This dish was a hit at our house-- though I replaced the cayenne with chipotle for a smoky flavour, left out the salt, and used fresh garlic. It was awesome

Rating: 3
I never plan long enough in advance to marinate anything 24 hours, however one or two hours is just fine here. The chicken was great, and not too much crust but very crispy. Have made frequently for the family and the kids love it. I freeze the fat after frying and use it again next time.

I grew up in the South and this recipe is as good or better than any fried chicken I have ever had. Could use a little less salt if you're not marinating as many chicken pieces as the recipe calls for. Very crisy, tender and juicy. Will definitely make many more times. Everyone raved over it!

I made this recipe for my family first and they raved over it. My four kids don't always like my sophisticated taste for recipes but this fried chicken was gone in seconds. I also made it for a family party and was asked for the recipe by almost everyone there. This is a repeat recipe in my files.

I made this recipe again tonight. Wow! Yes it is not a diet food, but if you want the best fried chicken, do it! Served it with mounds of buttered mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and buttermilk bisquits. Visiting child licked her plate clean and my own child, who still bears a grudge on the habenero jerk chicken (sorry kid, therapy will help) was surprised to learn that this recipe contained so much cayenne. All food was consumed, and everyone was delighted. I'll keep trying recipes as ones like this make it all worthwhile.

This chicken is almost excellent. The great thing is that you can do what you want with the basic recipe if you don't like all the ingredients. I used freshly crushed garlic instead of garlic powder and freshly ground black pepper instead of white. I've made it several times and my family loves it.

i have to admit we follow recipes in our home, but only occasionally and not TOO closely. having made this several times now, every variation we've made has been top notch. i recommend experimenting to your tastes, add the things you LIKE to the marinade. and my texan husband says to tell you you only need about a quarter of an inch of oil to fry *perfect* chicken. (i always let him fry he is the BEST!)

I followed Tim Culhane's suggestion of rotissering the marinated chicken and my family LOVED it. The chicken was moist and tasty. I didn't use accent and the salt could be reduced to 1 1/2 Tbsp. I can't comment on the fried version, but it sounds good. I'm originally from WI and I, too, would like to know what constitutes good fried chicken to some people south of the Mason-Dixon line?

SENSATIONAL! Moist, crispy, flavorful, and not too greasy. I've tried countless fried chicken recipes, but this was the best. I didn't use the accent either and it was plenty salty. Twelve cups of oil for frying is excessive. The chicken was beautifully golden and uniformly crispy. I can't wait to make it again!

Had to try this despite the mixed reviews - the comment about it being "orgasmic" swayed my doubts. I didn't think it was quite that good, but its definitely worth making again. Based on the comments about the coating being bland, i dredged the chicken in plain flour, let it get "doughy" and then sprinkled on a mixture of the salt, garlic powder, cayenne and white pepper (sort of emeril style) and it turned out well.

I did my own version of this recipe by taking off the skin of the chicken, coating it as per recipe and then browning it well in a small amount of oil in a skillet. I then stacked it in a roaster with the chicken breasts on bottom and the remaining parts on top. I baked it for about an hour at 350 with the lid on. It was devoured!

Having lived in the deep South all of my life and having grown up with the most delicious fried chicken one has ever tasted, this recipe is REVOLTING. The taste is wretched and does indeed leave a horrible after taste in one's mouth.When I reread all the rave reviews, I did note all but one are from reviewers far removed from the land of milk and honey south of the Mason-Dixon line. If you ever get to any small town in Ga. or Ala., taste the fried chicken there. It is heaven on earth. This recipe is going in the garbage can immediately. YUK!!!

My review of this recipe is mixed. I found the meat to be quite juicy and tasty. However, I didn't like the coating much--it was rather bland. Also, something left a bit of a strange aftertaste. I might try this recipe again by marinading the chicken as the recipe instructs, but try something else for the crust.

Rating: 1
I hate to be the lone voice of dissent but this recipe was one of the blandest ones for chicken I have ever tried. If I had to use one adjective to describe it, I would use "uninteresting." The noun would be "disappointment," given all of the favorable reviews. Frankly, it tasted like something you would expect the Boston Market to offer. Sorry, but I have far better ways to fry chicken.

I tried the Bon Ton fried chicken for the first time about a week ago and found it to be great. I made a couple of small modifications to our own liking. Added more cayene and just a touch of corn meal to the seasoned flour. I deep fried it for about 20 minutes. I did some boneless and skinless chicked breast strips and had them for a picnic the next day. Worked out just great.

I have never succeeded at making really delicious, juicy fried chicken until now. We were all gnawing the bones to get every last tasty bit! I followed the recipe exactly - the amounts and cooking time were perfect. If it wasn't so fattening, I'd make it at least once a week!

DELICIOUS! The marinade was wonderful. I dredged the pieces a second time after they had had a chance to "get doughy." I shared with neighbors, and one who isn't a chicken lover thought this was GREAT. The only thing I didn't like is a hazard of any fried food--the lingering greasy odor! Next time I will try baking it with a little oil in the oven rather than frying.

At the risk of being the sole negative review, I must say I didn't like this chicken. The marinade made the chicken seem somewhat "bloated" to me, not to my taste...my husband's family has a tried and true fried chicken recipe that I enjoy far more than this. I was disappointed in this recipe especially after reading all the rave reviews.
