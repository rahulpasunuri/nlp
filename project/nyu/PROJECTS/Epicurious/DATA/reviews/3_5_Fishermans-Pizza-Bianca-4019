Yikes spiteful people! Gentle, gentle, it is only pizza after all. Having written that, looking forward to some tasty, economical pizza.

As a clam and garlic fan, I couldn't be happier with this recipe. It was so fresh but so rich at the same time.

excellent! I used the bread machine pizza dough from this site and freshly grated imported parmesan - this was so easy and tasty

I have had this pizza in New Haven, Ct. and looked every where for the recipe. It's wonderful!!!! Thanks ever so much.

I thought this was a great in-a-pinch meal. How easy is it to have some pizza dough (store bought or homemade) in your freezer and a few cans of clams in the pantry? I did as suggested and rolled out my dough as thin as possible. So delish. I live in New Englad now and strive to make some dishes that aren't so "land-loving" as my native Colorado fare. Simply delish. Bring on the unexpected guests and wow them!

Excellent. I cheated and used the toppings on a Boboli, and also the Speedy Pizza (tortilla cooked on the stovetop - also this website) with very pleasing results. To the cook "from Beyond", how can you make the statement about "not judge others, their shortcomings, and mistakes, or criticize their points of view"? By doing so, are you not guilty of the same?

OK, here's an honest review. This pizza is WONDERFUL! Clam pizza was invented in New Haven, CT (where I live) at the famous pizza restaurants on Wooster Street. We'd howl with laughter if anyone around here called it "pizza bianca!" When I make it, I use fresh shucked clams--widely available here--and real reggiano cheese. I don't use the parsely or red pepper flakes, but I certainly don't object to the idea. The key to this dish--along with quality ingredients--is restraint. Just a little EV olive oil, a bare scattering of clams, garlic and cheese. I also make my own pizza dough, which should be rolled very thin if you're looking for authenticity. Also, turn your oven as high as it will go and heat the stone on the lowest rack for an hour before you bake.

Surely wish I could get some more "real" reviews (only 1 exists). This sounds like a pizza I used to get in New York...it was incredible. Would hate to be disappointed after expending the effort.

Bravo cook from Seattle, WA on 07/01/02! You were the only reviewer out of six to honestly review only the recipe (the matter at hand) and not judge others, their shortcomings, and mistakes, or criticize their points of view.

I haven't tried this recipe either but intend to soon. Before criticizing the person from Melbourne the "cook on 12/11/99" should learn how to spell "background". Before criticizing the person from Melbourne the "cook from New York, New York" should learn to spell "can". It's quite easy since it only contains three letters. You should also not assume that the person from Melbourne is a woman.

My family LOVES this pizza! I make my own basic pizza dough and add a bit more cheese and some spaghetti seasoning that I bought in Rome (has crushed red pepper flakes already in it). What a great recipe that produces an amazingly simple and delectable pizza! Can't wait to make it again and again!

although i have not yet had the chance to make this recipe - i have had the chance to get terribly annoyed with the "cook" from melborne - if one wants to get so technical you van say that italians don't look on the web for recipes - they ask their grandmothers. I don't feel this way but just could not (as a good italian) allow this person her opinion

although I have not yet tried his recipe, I have two points to make to the cook from melbourne:1)whether italians measure in ounces or not isn't the matter, the fact is that the recipe is directed to ANYONE, not solely people of italian backround. 2) although I see 'bianca' in the title, I do not see 'Italian' or 'authentic'. judge the recipe by taste, rather than by nit-picking criticism, please. thank you.
