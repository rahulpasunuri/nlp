Excellent! I'll be making it again for a large (100 person) buffet. I plan on steaming it instead of roasting and cutting the spears on the diagonal for 2-3 inch slices for ease of eating with just a fork. I will also use mandarin oranges for ease of prep. Cashews instead of peanuts. Very pretty and the dressing has a lot of zip. The freshly grated orange peel and fresh juice make a real difference. Don't sub on this.

This dish is a complete brunch all-star! Extremely colorful with bright flavors. I used combo seasonal oranges including blood oranges. My only gripe was how watery the sauce was on its own. I whisked in some honey mustard and honey to emulsify the sauce and was much happier with the texture. I also substituted chopped raw almonds for the peanuts only because peanuts dont impress me much. good stuff!

I think this is a fantastic recipe. Interesting to note - I have made it for two potlucks. Though the plate is cleaned down to the last drops of dressing, and people praise the dish, no one has requested the recipe. Careful not to over- cook the asparagus. Thinner asparagus cooks faster than thicker asparagus.

The dressing is fantastic...I used tangerines and blood oranges. Looked gorgeous, tasted gorgeous.

A great way to use extra asparagus. I like to get ots of asparagus when it's in season and this is a great idea for leftover asparagus since it's best not to re-heat it. I used tomatoes instead of oranges and they really soaked up the dressing. Tangy!

This salad was a delightful spring meal. We made it with asparagus from the farmer's market and the entire green onion (not just the tops). I also substituted almonds for the peanuts. This is most certainly going to be made again before asparagus season comes to an end.

This was fantastic with fresh Michigan asparagus. I used oranges because that's what I had and followed the recipe exactly. It was easy to prepare and a beautiful presentation. I served it as a side with grilled salmon. My husband, who usually eats about two or three spears of asparagus, had a generous serving and asked me to make this again. This would be a great dish for entertaining, especially since you can do it ahead of time.

Simple and delicious. I made a light meal out of it by cutting the asparagus into ~1.5 in lengths (after roasting) and adding lightly sauteed shrimp then tossing the whole thing with mixed baby greens. An easy, healthy, lovely spring dinner.

All my guests LOVED this recipe, and there were no leftovers! They kept going on about how good the asparagus was, so I guess they'd give it 4 forks. I'm giving it 3 because, even though I thought it was good, I found it slightly bitter. I'd still make it again though and perhaps use a little less ginger.

I made this as part of a pot-luck buffet. Very quick and easy with beautiful colors. A refreshing, light side. I received many compliments on the dish. I did substitute dry-roasted cashews in place of the peanuts as that was what I had in the cupboard. This dish would be beautiful with grilled fish.

This is a wonderful dish! Very elegant and so good. The dressing is delicious and I didn't find it too sweet at all. I may have added a half tsp more of vinegar. Can't wait to make it again!!

I loved this! my hubby isn't a great veggie lover, but he ate it (which means it's pretty good). i used apple juice instead of orange because it's what i had and decided that the dressing was incredible. can't wait to try it with tangerines. . .

Great taste!!!! I just made this for lunch. I love Thai inspired dishes with roasted peanuts and green onions. I did not have any oragnes, so I had to leave them out as well as the zest. I used hot sesame oil instead of regular. I can't wait to try it with the orange segments, but you don't really need them.

great whether you roast or grill the asparagus!

This is the first time I've felt strongly enough to rate a recipe after getting hundreds from Epicurious. My guests raved about the asparagus. Soaking them first keeps them from drying out. I've both roasted them and grilled them and with this dressing, you can't go wrong!

I didn't like this recipe, and niether did my boyfriend. I think the dressing was too sweet for my liking, and the sesame oil tasted confusing. I added red onions to it, and I still didn't eat it. In my personal opinion, it was a waste of great roasted asparagus.

This was a great salad for a girl's brunch. I topped it with French chevre and toasted almonds. It was delicious! Served with spinach and mushroom crepes, for a nice light meal.

I made this with orange-ginger swordfish and the combination was great. Both are highly worthwhile and very healthy.

This a great recipe. Roasting the asparagus is the only way to go. The dressing is very tasty.

The tangerine dressing was very good. I thought it strange that the recipe had no greens, so I followed the recipe exactly but served it with mixed baby greens. It will make a great salad to serve on the patio this summer.

The dressing is SO good. I used the dressing on baby spinach topped with crumbled blue cheese, toasted pecans, and slices (thin) of Gala apple. I look forward to making the entire recipe in the near future.

This was great! I'll never steam asparagus again - there's nothing like roasting. I used tangerine sections and peel, but used fresh orange juice for the liquid. I also substituted chopped toasted pecans for the peanuts.

Roasting is now the only way I make asparagus. This recipe is delicious. I've tried it with orange juice and with fresh tangerine juice. I definitely recommend the fresh tangerine juice. This is a wonderful side dish for just about any main course.

Everyone loved this one! The roasting imparts a lovely flavor and crisp texture to the asparagus. Only change I made was to use toasted sesame seeds since I was already using peanuts in another dish. A really elegant, simple salad.
