I've made these many times because they're great. Always a hit. Have to agree with some of the previous reviewers that the baking time is less than 20 min, or whatever it is that you must watch closely because they can burn in matter of minutes.

Don't be stupid like me and try to roll out from "log" position; turn to "candle" position so that strips will be 1" - 2" wide and the 12" or so long. Mine only took about 10 minutes total. Took me between 3 - 4 hours to make these.

Splendid crackers, and they're good keepers in an airtight bin, too!

My rating is *slightly* more optimistic than I actuallyf feel about this recipe. These are really really time consuming -- it seemed like they just took way too long for the end product. Also, I'd suggest only making half the glaze -- I ended up tossing most of it -- you're only brushing it on -- it's too much! These were tasty -- so are Carr's crackers. They're really not that healthy with all the butter -- it was fun to do once, but I'm unsure whether it was worth the time to do again with fairly decent alternatives out there...

I wanted a healthy alternative to commercial crackers. I made the dough with i cup whole wheat flour substituted which gave the crackers a nice dimension. I did find I had to roll them quite thin or else the mid section wasn't crispy enoughNext I plan to make them using olive oil instead of butter- will let you know!

these were fun to make. I used the suggestions from scooterams and ran them through the pasta machine and I only used about half that amount of sesame seeds. He was also right on about the timing, we baked them for no more than 15 minutes. Also the glaze recipe makes way more than you need. Reducing it by half would work fine. I left them in fairly long irregular strips and stood them up in a basket. They looked and tasted GREAT. I willl definately do this again

These crackers make a great hors d'ouvre when spread with chive cream cheese and topped with a little smoked salmon.

So I took this recipe and made an italien version that was delightful. In the glaze instead of soy sauce and sugar I put some balsamic vinager. Then I topped it with fresh rosemary and romano cheese. It was fantastic.

i'm a student at the culinary institute of america and i needed a recipe for sesame crackers for my garde manger class. we tried this one and it came out really well. here are a few tips, though... you might want to chill it for more than 10 minutes. the dough is very wet and gooey, and is hard to work with when warm. we chilled it in the fridge for 20 -30 minutes. if you have a pasta machine, try rolling this dough out with it. again, you'll have to chill it well and maybe add a little flour to it so it won't stick. if you use a pasta machine, don't put the sesame seeds into the dough. just sprinkle them on top after you've glazed it. the glaze can turn from golden to burnt-as-hell in just a couple of minutes (because of the sugar), so you really have to watch them. also, it didn't take 20 minutes to bake. more like just under 15 minutes.
