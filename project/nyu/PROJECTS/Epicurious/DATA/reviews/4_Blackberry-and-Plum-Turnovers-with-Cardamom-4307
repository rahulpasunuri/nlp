Taste of the fruit filling and almond paste were exceptional!! Cooked very well on silpat; did need more than the recommended cook time. ***My biggest difficulty was trying to seal these with the designated 1/4 cup fruit inside. What a mess. A good seal is essential to prevent leaking, so try ....... A) a plan to use excess delicious fruit B) buy addtl puff pastry and make more turnovers or C) considerably less fruit at the outset.

My husband who seldom compliments my cooking actually exclaimed over this recipe! It was a big hit with everyone!!! I followed the directions exactly, but I imagine the recipe could be made without the almond paste/whipping cream (in order to save money--almond paste is expensive), and it would probably be a B+ at least.

These are wonderful and very large. One is big enough for two people but, once you taste it you will make a pig of yourself and eat the whole thing! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Do NOT bake in a standard oven both sheets at once. They do not rise as well and the pastry does not rise as flakey. I have done it both ways and taking the extra twenty minutes to do them one tray at a time is well worth the minimal effort. I had extra fruit filling left that I am going to use on banana splits this weekend!! yum!
