Super yum with a hunk of bread for sopping purposes. I too had to add a little more hot sauce (I used Frank's Hot Sauce for the marinade and added Tabasco to the soup to taste). Very easy, one-pot meal, great to make during the week and eat on it for a few days.

Easy, quick & delicious. I just used a 14 oz can of tomatoes, because it was almost the same amount. I drained the juice & used it to replace an equivalent amount of the chicken broth. Because others had recommended increasing the spice level, I used fire roasted tomatoes with green chiles. I also added about a teaspoon of smoked paprika.

This was great. I added some freshly grated ginger and a little extra peanut butter. Easy meal in a bowl. This one goes into my recipe box.

i've been looking for a recipe like this for a while. it was great! i took the advice of others and used more hot sauce to marinate the chicken - maybe 3 tablespoons. I also added more to the soup as it cooked. It wasn't overly spicy, just helped it be zingy. I followed the recipe generally, but I did add a white sweet potato and red pepper because I wanted more veggies. I added coconut milk as someone else suggested and it worked well. I added a can, but would cut it back to a half can next time. The cooking time and simmering time just seems a bit off for chicken and to mingle the flavors, so I just let it simmer longer and it was super. Will make again!

I made it true to recipe --- It was OK ---- I have plenty of great soup recipes so will not probably make again. But this was interesting flavor and worth trying

I would give this 3.5 forks. I was worried this would not have enough flavor so I added sweet potatoes, used lots of sriracha for the hot sauce, replaced some of the broth with a can of coconut milk, and topped with fresh cilantro. I served it over rice. Delicious! Only doesn't get 4 forks because I made so many changes to the recipe.

Tasty easy weeknight dinner. I added more peanut butter and spice as recommended by others. And I used carrots, celery and onion. The celery complemented the rich peanut flavor very nicely.

Got rave reviews! Used 3 tbsp. of peruvian yellow aji sauce and marinated the chicken for about 2 hrs. Threw in whatever veggies I had on hand: string beans, carrots, broccoli. No zucchini. Didn't have canned tomato, so I seeded & chopped fresh tomato. Used 1/2 C. creamy peanut butter. Mixed shallots with onions and served over white rice. Delicious!

I didn't think this was great, although my guests liked it, and my friend who travels to Africa frequently loved it -- she said it tasted just like some of the sauces from West Africa. I added more hot sauce, and I think that helped.

After reading several of the reviews, I elected to increase the hot sauce a little as some people felt it wasn't flavorful enough-my mistake-unless you want "spicy!" just follow the recipe-it is enough...I also increased the peanut butter like others which was a good idea. I probably will crush peanuts next time to give it more of a thai flavor. All in all-good soup!

This was easy, fast and very good tasting. I added a sweet potato and a Yukon Gold, both cut into chunks, and used red peppers instead of zucchini. Other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely. I think you could cut the butter down to 2 tblspoons.

I took a few previous reviewers suggestions and added 3/4 C peanut butter instead of 1/3, a whole can of diced tomatoes (no tomato paste)and a little extra butter and flower to make a thicker soup. I did everything else the same because I was cooking for someone who doesn't like super spicy food, but next time I would also double the hot sauce and add some red pepper flakes for an extra kick. I also added toasted peanuts as a garnish, which gave it a nice crunch. Served over white rice, but would also be good with brown or on its own.

Delicious! A "10" on a scale of 1 to 10. I, too, used 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of 1/3 cup. I doubled the hot sauce. I used carrots and broccoli instead of zucchini. I skipped the tomato paste and added 1 tsp sugar. I used a whole stick of butter instead of 5 tbsp. Excellent!!

This yummy soup was like a soup version of two of my favorites: peanut sauce or groundnut stew. I made a few adjustments suggested by others and to suit what was in my pantry. I doubled the hot sauce and added several shakes of red pepper flakes to the sauteeing veggies. I didn't have zucchini, so I used carrots and broccoli instead. I also used a whole can of tomatoes, including the juice (instead of tomato paste). The result was delightful so I think you could use up any type of vegetable really, as long as you adjust the cooking time. I simmered the soup for 15 minutes, b/c I don't think 5 min is really enough time to meld flavors cook partially raw chicken. A longer simmer also helps thicken the soup. I also added a tsp of sugar since I didn't use the tomato paste. I couldn't get the (natural, chunky) peanut butter to mix into the broth, but once it was plopped into the hot soup, it melted into a harmonious whole. I like a thicker textured soup so I only added 3 cups of broth and pulsed a few times with an immersion blender. I would actually add 1/2 cup to 1 cup more liquid next time b/c the soup thickens quite a bit upon sitting. All in all, very yummy and forgiving. Hard to mess up. I prefer natural peanut butter in savory recipes and I think this works just as well with natural. Not sure why this recipe specifies emulsified creamy, but don't worry about it if you don't have it.

definitely needed more peanut butter and the hot sauce but was a yummy winter dinner with wild rice. added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice, mushrooms, used olive oil instead of butter (which was fine), and tossed in some rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own. also blended it (though left a bit chunky) with an immersion blender, which really helped the texture and pulled it together. will make it again.

This is definitely a solid, although not amazing recipe. I wound up adding an extra tablespoon or two of hot sauce, but I like things spicy. This was a good meal, but I don't know if I would make it again.

I made this recipe and it was fabulous. I did make a couple adjustments. Like others, I boosted the hot sauce and added a little more peanut butter. I omitted the zucchini and added collard greens instead. I served it over mashed yams (like I had it in a Ghanaian restaurant).

The first time I made this soup, I followed the recipe exactly, and while it was hearty, it was blander than I would have liked. So I've modified it thusly: Instead of 1 TBSP of hot sauce, I use 3 TBSP, and add red pepper flakes to the chicken; I add 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of 1/3 cup to give it more rich peanut flavor; I use a whole can of petite diced tomatoes with either mild green chilies or zesty jalapeños (either is good) instead of 1 cup. Once, I inadvertently used a whole stick of butter instead of 5 TBSP, and while it came out more caloric, I have to admit it was tastier, so now I use a whole stick all the time. These alterations are definitely not low-cal, however my guests raved over the alterations I made! Oh, and once I couldn't find decent zucchini, so I added a couple diced red bell peppers instead. Delicious!

This was a pretty good weeknight meal. I added green peppers and carrots which I think made the soup more interesting.

We LOVE this recipe. Ive made it a few times now and the first time I exactly followed the recipe to rave reviews. We like spicy food and so I go a little heavy on the hot sauce and let the chicken marinade for ½ hour. The zucchini adds the perfect texture!

This is a wonderful soup that comes together quick. I've made it a few times now and it is always a hit. We like spicy food so I always up the hot sauce. A great quick meal!

Very tasty - i had to substitute cremini mushrooms for the zuchini. Also I only had crunchy natural peanut butter but it was fine. The peanut butter was a little curdled but in the end it was pretty smooth and tasted great.

I made this for dinner tonight and was overly delighted. I used chicken I had marinated and cooked last week, which I think took care of the bland issues other users mentioned. I also used creamy *natural* peanut butter -- blatantly breaking the rule and I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of a cup. Beyond that I used benecol spread instead of butter and added spinach and squash for a wonderfully pleasing delicious result. In the future I'll probably use more hot sauce for a little more bite.

This turned out ok. I added some lime and cilantro at the table which gave it a little zing. I think I will add a little cooking wine to the veggies and chicken next time.

I cut the butter to 3T, used Sriracha for its garlic content, and kept the zucchini. I don't care for zucchini on its own, but it was the perfect addition to this soup, adding plenty of texture without interfering with the peanut flavor. I found I missed the hint of vinegar a traditional hot sauce would have supplied, so added a splash of red wine vinegar to compensate. My husband and I really enjoyed this.

wow, this was amazing. i only used 2 tbsp butter, added some siracha to the chicken, let the chicken marinate for a while to give it more flavor, used yellow bell pepper instead of zuchini, added cayenne, red pepper flakes, and some cornstarch to thicken it up. served over jasmine rice. it had just the right amount of kick, i will definitely make this again.

Made this for dinner for my family was pleasently surprised as to how thick it was. Great flavor, would go heavier on the hot sauce next and add mushrooms.

I forgot to get zucchini, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. I thought that it was tasty but a little bland, so I upped the heat with some cayenne and then finished it with a big handful of chopped cilantro at the end. With these additions it was really yummy and I will make it again.

This was okay, but a bit bland, despite the addition of chopped chipotles in adobo sauce and a bit of the sauce as well. Not a bad soup, but given the name, you'd expect a bit more kick and flavour.

Made this tonight because I needed something easy, quick and delicious, and this soup turned out absolutely wonderful. Creamy and smooth with just the right hint of peanut butter and the hot sauce gives the soup real zing. Next time I think I'll add just a bit less chicken and more zucchini. I used petite diced tomatoes and those worked great. I changed none of the ingredients and we will definitely make this again. The temps will be in the teens tonight and this warm, tasty soup hit the spot.

I made the long version of this, cooking chicken for hours in a mixture of broth and water to make my own basic soup, then followed the recipe. This is a delicious soup! Even better as leftovers. Adding some cooked quinoa when reheating the next makes it a sort of stew. Very satisfying.

Really easy to make. Peanut sauce is one of my favorite things, so I used a little bit more peanut butter and a dash more tabasco. The next day I heated it up and poured it over basmati rice - DELICIOUS!

This is the kind of recipe I dream of: quick, easy, delicious, and different. We used Siracha to add spice and tomato sauce took the place of paste (didn't have any). Served over brown rice, this is gonna be a staple recipe at our house. Tastes like a lot more work than it is! ;) Life all stews, even better the next day!

Received with great anticipation that it would be delicious...yes it is. Made it just as is printed. If only Gourmet could get the recipe that Ellicottville Brew Pub makes, E'ville,NY. There's just something in it we crave every ski season we get there. Joanne and John Armstrong

This recipe stood out to me for its unique addition of peanut butter. To further the uniqueness, I added chopped peanuts. I really found no use for any butter or flour. It was a great recipe though and a new favorite!

I wasn't sure about this when I was making it... it's not everyday that I whisk chicken broth, peanut butter, and tomatoes! But I'm glad I stuck with it because I found it unique and tasty. I only gave three forks though because my husband didn't like it quite as much as I did, and the next day it tasted a little bland. Not sure why... But, I just added some more hot sauce and was good to go! One more thing--I think it was nice on its own. I don't think I'd put it with rice or anything.

I made this soup the other day and thought it was delicious. I didn't have zucchini, so I used a yellow bell pepper. Instead of diced tomatoes, I substituted a can of Rotel (with green chiles). It was nice and spicy. The flour definitely helped to thicken it up. I garnished with a dallop of peanut butter before serving. Delicious and easy!

Really tasty. I had no tomato paste so I used some mango salsa I had and it added to the kick.

Interesting recipe. I used chopped red pepper instead of zucchini. I would have used less butter, I really don't think you need 5 tablespoons. My biggest concern was that it didn't thicken as much as I thought it would. But the flavors were tasty and unique, and I can see how it would be good with brown rice (we ate it with good whole wheat bread). I wasn't crazy about it overall but my boyfriend raved, so maybe it just depends on your preference.

Made this last night. It was a waste of time and material. Too greasy for one and tasteless for another. Maybe if I'd added rice it might have been better. It was very bland.

It's good that the recipe showed up here, because the authentic Ghanaian "groundnut soup" is a winner that more people should know about. The peanut butter taste disappears in this blend and yields a hearty, tasty soup. But cut up real tomatoes instead of adding canned paste. Use small, hot chili peppers, to taste, rather than a prepared and vinegary hot sauce. And zucchini wouldn't be used traditionally; "fufu" in a big glob would sit in the middle of the soup pot or individual bowl as a glutinous, bland, neutral-tasting starch to make the hot soup more user-friendly -- and fill the belly. We can make a pounded paste of plaintain, or easier, soften in the hot soup some dried Japanese mochi, which yields the same result.

I've made a very similar soup with two substitutions--peppers instead of zucchini and added lite coconut milk--it's great served over whole wheat linguine or brown rice

Delicioius as written. But, I like it even better with some adobo and chicken thighs. I've tried it with both commercial and natural peanut butter. It is just a little creamier and sweeter with the commercial. So, I added a little honey when I used the natural.

Thought this recipe was rather unusual... made it for lunch today and forgot the flour. Thickened at the end with a little cornstarch and water and added an extra dollop of peanut butter... because it's gluten free without the flour, will be making for my friends with celiac. Delicious!

Made this last night, but left out the zucchini as we didn't have any. Didn't miss it at all, and probably wouldn't use it next time either. This soup was absolutely delicious! I thought it needed more heat so I added a tablespoon more Tabasco and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne...perfect! Very quick and easy. Highly recommended for an autumn weeknight meal. Can't wait to try the leftovers!

Great recipe--good and fast. It's smooth and very filling. Added some cooked rice to it, too. I only had natural peanut butter, which worked fine--I added about 1.5 tablespoons of sugar to make it resemble commercial peanut butter more, but that was the only change I made. My husband loved it, and it makes great leftovers for lunch, too.
