Loved this! I added lemon zest and juice instead of vinegar and it was wonderful. I waited to salt the dish until after adding the olives and that turned out to be a good thing. Any additional salt would have been too much. I also used quinoa pasta and it was very good but soaked up the mayo, so if you decide to do this use the low cal stuff and or mix with low cal sour cream like previous reviewers suggested, I will do this next time. It was very well received at the Officer Spouses meeting I took it to!

this is a good, easy recipe. It's way too much mayo for my family. I keep the vinegar the same but put in only 1/3-1/2 cup. I also tend to use cherry tomato halves and more red onion.

Easy and tasty. Was a little liquid but next day was perfect and even better. I would recommend making the day before and letting the flavors meld.

Love this stuff! It's requested for every potluck and goes quickly. I use extra shrimp, substitute a little sour cream for some of the mayo and sometimes use cherry tomato halves. I love fresh dill, but find this to be too much. It keeps well for several days in the fridge...but rarely lasts that long:-) A definite keeper.

too much mayo and i didn;t use all that it called for. i thought it was a little heavy for a summer salad.

The prep for this dish was pretty labor intensive, but it paid off with a delicious salad. It's especially good when chilled well. I used more shrimp, probably double what's called for, and would use a bit less dill next time. I used the amount of mayo called for, but since I increased the amt. of shrimp and pasta, it makes me think I would use less if following the recipe exactly. The salad was quite well coated with the given amt. of mayo.

A perfect summer salad! I made this as part of our picnic lunch out in the wine country. It was the perfect complement to the brick-pressed sandwich and corn-black bean salad. I followed the advice of other epicureans and sauteed the shrimp in Chesapeake Bay seasoning from Penzey's. I love olives but since they were also in the sandwich, I decided not to include. I also added caper and lots and lots of dill. Light mayo works great. I also "healthed" it up a bit more by using higher fiber pasta. My father who is healthy-food "phobic" couldn't even tell the difference.

Definitely a keeper. I modified the recipe a tad: Used only a dash of white wine vineger and substituted lemon juice plus the zest of one lemon instead. I also substituted red paprika for the olives to make it more kid-friendly. Other tips: I think lots of very finely chopped FRESH dill is a must and I also used plenty of small, cold water shrimp. I would say this was 3 forks but I got such rave reviews and people ate so much that I just had to give it 4. Really, I couldn't believe my eyes it disappeared so quickly. Even all four kids at the party ate second helpings!

Sorry to be a wet blanket, but this wasn't particularly good. I doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly. There was way too much dressing! Perhaps fresh dill would have added flavor; dried dill just didn't taste like anything. The ratio of shrimp to pasta was pretty skimpy, too. This was disappointing.

This was delicious and very easy...following suggestions of other cooks, I made the following changes/additions: diced red bell peppers, celery, capers, fresh basil. Used about 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo and a splash of white balsamic vinegar. I did not have cucumber or dill, so left that out. Also, used black olives, as we find them less salty than kalmata. Oh, and did not use tomatoes. So, don't chide me for not following the recipe exactly. This worked, and was very tasty and made for a light dinner on the patio. Served over a bed of mixed greens with some crusty bread and a glass of sauvignon blanc. Summertime!

Very good. And refreshing for dinner for a hot evening. I made it the evening before. Added capers, grape tomatoes & celery. Sauted the shrimp in olive oil, butter, sprinkled with Old Bay & sea salt. Combined mayo with sour cream. I will add red pepper strips next time for color. The idea of adding tomato wedges on top is a good one. The grape tomatoes add good burst of flavor, but the color got lost in the mayo. Think next time I'll sprinkle them on top. With a sprinkle of parsley or cilantro. Would make a much more attractive presentation. I served on top of a bed chopped greens.

Great! I substituted tomatoes for red peppers and omitted the olives. Prepared shrimp like previous reviewers (butter, garlic and cajun seasoning). Used fusili pasta. Very refreshing and tasty.

Great easy recipe. Thanks for the tips. I added red pepper in place of the tomato. Also added old bay seasoning (which is a must). I topped the dish with wedges of tomatoes - which made for a nice presentation.

This is my summer salad - I love it! I keep making it - can't help myself. I add other things to the mix - like radishes, green pepper, parlsey - instead of dill and some caynenne pepper.

This recipe is fantastic. The red onion is probably what makes it special. I used cooked frozen shrimp and I peeled as well as seeded the tomato. Were it not for its appearance, I'd have given it four forks.

Not fabulous, but good enough that I'd probably make it at least one more time. Used penne as that's all I had in the house. I boiled the shrimp with a generous dose of Old Bay and salt, and like another reviewer, subbed sour cream for much of the mayonnaise to lighten the flavor a bit. I agree that it needs red bell pepper and/or celery for color and crunch. I found the olives a little odd, so I'd leave them out next time, and I might use sun-dried tomatoes in addition to fresh for more zing. I also would cut back on the amount of mayo/sour cream - it was a little goopy for my taste.

Buy raw shrimp. Cook it using garlic, butter, and cajun seasoning. Follow recipe.

Delicious. I chopped the shrimp, used fresh basil instead of dill, and light mayo. Lovely pasta salad.

I served this pasta salad for a group of 75 people and it was a big hit. The only changes I made were 1) used canned diced tomatoes (drained), 2) omitted the olives since some people dislike them, and 3) added some Old Bay Seasoning (a must for pasta salad in Maryland). I think the cucumbers and dill make this dish extra-special.

This recipe is a wonderful foundation for pasta salad. I made it several years ago with rave reviews from everyone who ate it, but I didn't remember how I made it since I seldom follow the recipe for anything or make it the same way twice. This time, I quadrupled the shrimp and pasta, using penne instead of shells. I also added chopped sun-dried tomatoes, celery, spicy green olives, green onions, red bell peppers and a few chopped capers. When sauteing the shrimp, I added cajan seasoning and the little liquid crab boil for flavor and spice. I poured the little liquid from cooking the shrimp over the dried tomatoes and let it set while the pasta and shrimp cooled, then added the remaining vegetables and some mayo before stirring in the shrimp and pasta. My luncheon guests are going to love this salad if I can keep my family out of it until they arrive. Will be wonderful with chicken too!

After reading all the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try this. As other reviewers suggested, I substituted red pepper for the tomatoes and used peas instead of cucumber. Otherwise, followed the recipe. I agree with the cook from Franklin, MA. It was very bland. I added more dill, but it was still bland. Eventualy, I added more fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and Cajun seasoning. Finally, it had some flavor. I would only make it again with several modifications to improve flavor. Even with my additions, family felt it was just OK.

Delicious - I substituted crabmeat from some frozen King Crab legs that I had for the shrimp, used kalamata olives as suggested by other reviewers, and doubled amount of dressing as I used a little over a pound of dry pasta. My company loved it!

After searching Epicurious for a shrimp and pasta salad, I selected this one because the recipe sounded simple, but tasty, and the rating was high. I made it for 40 people and it was loved by all. I used 16-20 count shrimp and sliced them longways, to make 2 even halves. It will go in my recipe box.

Yummy! I think it needs something extra like diced red peppers for color and sweetness. Good with or without dill, and didn't use olives because I don't like them, will certainly make this again (maybe next time with chicken?) Enjoy!

This was very good. I would suggest chilling it for more than 2 hours. My husband and I finished it the next day and we thought it was even better! So it could be easily made well in advance for a party. I also used Kalamata olives as was suggested by other reviewers. So good!! Thanks!

This is terrific. I used cooked jumbo shrimp sliced in 3 sections, and pitted kalamata olives. Also used dried basil (into the mayo) instead of any dill, and a little fresh lemon juice along with the wine vinegar to thin out the mayo. The kalamata olives add a wonderful contrast.

This recipe is great! I followed another's idea of substituting red pepper for tomato, and it's great. My BF, who hates mayo, LOVED this recipe. I highly recommend it.

Modified the recipe a bit to make just a shrimp salad without the pasta. Added chopped celery, lemon juice and omitted the olives. It turned out really great. Will try with the pasta next time.

We substituted half the mayo with sour cream to give it a lighter flavor, and didn't use as much dill. It was a pleasant side dish, but nothing spectacular.

Nice pasta salad for a hot summer evening. I added a couple of tablespoons to the mayo/vinegar mixture to "freshen" the taste. Be sure to use smaller pasta shells, as medium-sized are too overwhelming for the shrimp.

I substituted fresh lime juice for the vinegar and red bell pepper for the tomato. I also added a bit of sugar. Delicious on a bed of spinach or salad greens.

This dish was absolutely delicious.! Fresh dill is vital I think. I used Kalamata olives that added a tangy, salty flavor that was a good compliment to the other ingredients. After I made this, my husband was spoiled. The next pasta dish I made soon after didn't compare to this one for him. I doubled the recipe when I made it in order to have leftovers, but my husband ate almost all that I didn't eat.
