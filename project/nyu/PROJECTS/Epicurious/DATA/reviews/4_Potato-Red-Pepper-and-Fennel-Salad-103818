This is fabulous! I can't wait to take it to a picnic or dinner party. It reminds me a lot of a potato salad I had in Colmar, France. I'll make this again and again.

Excellent, tasty potato salad--more along the lines of French potato salad than the traditional American version with mayonnaise. Have made it twice in 2 weeks.

The flavours explode (in a good way). Love the juxtaposition of the crunchy/sweet fennel/peppers vs. the savory/softer potatoes. Only change would be that would cut back on oil.

We looked up and decided to make this dish because our pantry was pretty bare save for a bulb of fennel. It turned out okay--pretty crunchy. We like fennel a lot, but almost never eat it rare so it was unusual. We used a green bell pepper instead of a red one, but I don't think it made a huge difference. Easy to make, though I wouldn't recommend it for kids/picky eaters!

There is an excellent combination between the starch of the potato and the snap of the pepper, and more so it is complimented very well by the anise flavor of the fennel. A great summer dish to take advantage of the seasonal ripeness and light flavors of the main ingredients. The sweeter the pepper and the stronger the fennel is all the better, so be choosy when shopping for ingredients. This is a simple dish so the quality of the produce is really on display. Speaking of simple, it is VERY easy to prepare, so this should become a recipe to be memorized as a quick solution to the boredom of traditional summer potato salads.
