YUM! Wow...these are good, time consuming but delicious. Made with russet potatoes...otherwise stuck to the recipe.

A very pleasant side with steak. I had only russets, so used them and it was fine.

These were really delicious. We didn't have half & half on hand, so we used 1% milk instead. I'm sure they would have been even creamier with the half & half, but they were just as tasty with the milk. We paired them with grilled blackened chicken and grilled corn on the cob.

Delicious! Just please use organic half and half, many toxins in non-organic animal fat. And don't worry about eating the cream/butter, you're not having them every day...btw the human brain is over 60% fat so if you think a low fat diet is good for you, think again!

My new favorite mashed potato recipe! Delicious! I used a handheld mixer, and the consistency was great.

Used fat free half and half but otherwise followed recipe exactly for a great New Year's Eve Dinner for 9. Rave reviews. Made with Beef Roast with orange balsamic glaze (oh my!) and the roasted carrots and parsnips - all from the same issue of Gourmet. Next time, I am doing the beet salad too!

Usually halve the recipe and use Yukon Gold potatoes. A hand masher works fine for us.

Heating the milk and butter and garlic makes the potatoes.....YUM. I pared this with the Mahogany beef stew and it was perfect

A great, subtle twist on mashed potatoes that fancies them up. FYI - I did not peal the potatoes which have them a rustic look. I served these to my mother who does not like horseradish and she adored them.

I like horseradish, and I like mashed potatoes, but this combination gave the potatoes an odd flavor I was not overly fond of. They are not bad, but I guess I just prefer the good old-fashioned buttermilk mashed potatoes.

Wow, these are the best potatoes I have ever had. I added a small amount of nutmeg and whipped with a hand beater. I have tried them with the potato ricer, but prefer my potatoes with more texture.

Rating: 4
An easy to make staple. The horseradish is barely noticeable, just adds a little bit of tanginess.

We like our mashed potatoes lumpy, so we just boiled, drained, and added the rest of the ingredients into the pot and mashed it all up. Very good, not too hot.

Wonderful side to Prime Rib. I almost followed the recipe exactly and we all enjoyed it. I don't have a potato ricer so I used a mixer and whipped them. Still turned out delicious!

This is the absolute best! Guests ask for the recipe and leftovers cook up well the next morning as potato pancakes. I make it completely fat free using fat free half-and-half and substituting butter buds for the butter. I add the fat free half and half last and cook just until heated through so it does not become stringy. I whip the potatoes with a hand held mixer and sprinkle the top with chopped chives from my garden. Fantastic!

For those who love horseradish I suggest using the spicy prepared or add fresh grated right into the potatoes. I leave at least some of the potato skin on as well. For those of you who have grown up with super creamy potatoes this may take some getting used to but is a nice added texture to many meals. (even more so with grated horseradish!)

Rating: 2
I expected the comparable intensity of flavor in these horseradish mashed potatoes as in garlic mashed potatoes, but was disappointed even when I doubled the amount of horseradish called for! I will try again sometime...with even more horseradish! In response to a previous reviewer, horseradish is found in the refrigerator section of the grocery store, or you could always just ask where it is.

Where does one find bottled horseradish? I looked everywhere. I found horseradish root, creamed horseradish, horseradish sauce...I finally made it with the creamed horseradish, but I want the texture! It was good none-the-less.

I have made theses several times. My guests have always raved. More often than not, they call me back for the recipe. I'm not one to get hung up on the "light and fluffy" aspect of mashed potatoes (my grandmother is rolling over in her grave right now). I have made them "rustic" (with peels and lumps)and they are just as good or better.

Rating: 4
I served this with the salt crusted roast and they were a HUGE hit. They were creamy with a really nice finish of horseradish. I'm sure I could have made them much lower in fat but I recommend having them occassionally and going full force with the butter and the half and half. They were heavenly!!

Excellent, I have made this several times each with great success. Mashed potatoes taste wonderful with a beef entre.

A gourmet dish that every family could afford. Healthy and delicious. For those conscious of eating cream, substitute Free-Range Chicken Broth for a postion of the half-half. Beef broth is a wonderful compliment of the horseradish - the beef broth will color the potatoes a bit, but can be smothered with a brown sauce [gravy]. I enjoy using equal portions of whipping cream and Free-Range Chicken Broth. It's OK, my family is like having company [guests] everyday. For some, a smattering of green peas and a dolop of sourcream are a welcome change.

I substituted an equal amount of creamy horse radish sauce for the drained horse radish. Mixed in 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives just before serving. Excellent!

My whole family loved this receipe. The horseradish MADE it. I served Filets Mignons with Port Wine Glaze(from this web site) over them and drizzled the filets and potatoes with the glaze. Just great!!!

People: There is no reason on earth to add horse radish to mashed potatoes. The flavor while spicy is too over powering. Do the recipe again omit the horse radish and substitute some crushed garlic to taste. I was so grossed out by this recipe I couldnt sleep for days and had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. My 11 year old son had trust issues with me after eating these and refuses to hug me. For the sake of family DO NOT MAKE THESE POTATOES. Yes its that deep.

One word: Nummers. I'd cut the fat next time I make it though. It was a little heavy.

AWESOME potatoes! These made our holidays a little more jolly! Will definitely be making these well into the new year!

You can cut the fat content substantially by substituting Land o' Lakes fat free half-and-half for the real thing. This is the only fat free product I know of that actually tastes and acts like the original in cooking.

To the cook from Gwynedd Valley: vanilla soymilk? You've got to be kidding!

At a wonderful resturant in East Glouster, Mass., horseradish potatoes were the base for a delightful dish. Pan seared sea bass was placed on the potatoes with a light caper cream sauce drizzled over it. Delicious!! Ever since than my husband has requested horseradish in his mashed potatoes.

Rating: 3
This is a nice recipe but it becomes great and goes to 4 forks by substituting dry wasabi (generously) for the horseradish. It also can be made vegan by using vanilla soymilk and extra virgin olive oil for the dairy components.

I paired this w/Filet Mignon w/Green Peppercorn Cream Sauce as part of our Xmas feast - it was a huge hit w/happy plates from all in a matter of minutes! We made the potatoes the night before which seemed to really enhance the flavor. Don't be initimidated by need for a the rice mill - I used my KitchenAid Mixmaster at high speed and the consistency was perfect!

I have been making mashed potatoes w/ horseradish for years, and this recipe is pretty much how I do it, except that I use salted butter... It a great accompaniment to salmon. Delish!!
