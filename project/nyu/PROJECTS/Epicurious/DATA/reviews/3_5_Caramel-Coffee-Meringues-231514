I must have done something wrong as my meringues separated after baking and made their own syrup in the dishes. As for the coffee syrup, I found it way too sweet, since the meringues were also very sweet. For a coffee dessert, I much prefer the turkish coffee pudding recipe on this site.

This was light, pleasant-tasting and easy. Unfortunately, reviews from those who never tried it have brought down the ratings. It could also be done in cappuccino cups,and next time I would drizzle the syrup over the whipped cream.

What a delectable little treat! I wish all desserts were this easy to make. I made this for a wine tasting last weekend; it proved to be the perfect closure to a night of hedonistic pleasures!

I made this for a party and everyone raved. The combination of texture (very light) and flavor (quite saturated) was the perfect finale to a rich meal. I served it with a Muscat de Rivesaltes with the explanation: Coffee to eat and dessert to drink.

NOT a brazilian recipe. Brazilians do no like coffee-based deserts. Although we drink coffee all day long, it is NEVER used in any type of food. A true brazilian desert would be something like a caramel custard desert.

To the cook in Toronto - I agree with the cook from Tex, you should make it first.

I just really do not think that you should review a recipe without making it as it is written.

A comment as I haven't made this recipe as yet. I've made Irish Coffee Meringues from Bon Appétit - May 1996 and they are wonderful. I will make the 1996 recipe for meringues and will serve with the caramel sauce which sounds yummy.I don't like the idea of a soft meringue with the sauce sounds a bit too gooey.
