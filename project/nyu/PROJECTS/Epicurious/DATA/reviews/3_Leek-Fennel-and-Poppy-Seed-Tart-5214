I agree, tasty but a tiny bit bland. a bit more salt perhaps. I am going to revert back to my usual using just fennel, creme fraiche, ready to use puff pastry and pecorino romano, which is saltier than parmigiana. Link here - http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2013/03/ingredient-spotlight-fennel-savory.html The result is mellow, flavorful and rich but not too heavy. Crust is not soggy either because it bakes quite hot and for 40 min,

I found this very good the first time I made it, but I added red wine to the vegetable mix. The second time I made it I added a lot of garlic, the red wine and it was even better. I plan on making this again, it made a great lunch for work and is good cold.

nothing special about this one, rather run-of-the-mill - pretty boring, actually, There are better uses for leeks and fennel.

This was very good, although the crust was a bit soggy. Next time I will try placing the tart pan on a baking stone. I wanted to cut this into small squares to serve as an hors d'oeuvre, but it was a little too messy for that - definitely needs a fork. This would be nice for brunch or lunch served with salad.

This dish was very easy to make. However, I found it to be a bit bland even though I added a dash of dry white wine and a pinch of nutmeg to the butter and flour base. I see this recipe as having a lot of potential, though. I think I'll try using goat cheese next time I make this.

I've made this twice, and haven't tried adding wine but I will next time. Very very good with soup and a salad. I make this with a quiche pastry recipe from this site, the one for "Queen Elizabeth's Favorite Quiche" - a perfect crust.

I've made this tart many times, and I think it is very good. It benefits greatly from a splash of white wine added to the sauce - it's a bit bland without it. I find that if time is a problem, instead of roasting the vegetables, one can blanch the fennel in lightly salted water, and gently sautee the leeks in butter, and continue as in the recipe. It doesn't change the taste, and it's faster...

This leek tart is really good. I substituted the puff pastry by a simple tart dough (flour, butter, egg and water) in order to reduce total fat. The result was so good that two other cooks asked me for the recipe. The parmezan on top makes a lovely crust on it.
