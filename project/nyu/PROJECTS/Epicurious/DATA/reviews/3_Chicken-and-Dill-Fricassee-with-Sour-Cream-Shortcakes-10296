We liked this, however my family is not a fan of dill so I had to make few changes. I used lima beans instead of peas and used bay leaves instead of dill. And I made the shortcakes with a bit of rosemary and thyme instead of dill. Nice dinner on a chilly night.

This was very good. I took another reviewers advise about it being too "dilly" and cut back using 1 teaspoon dried dillweed for the biscuits and 1 teaspoons for the fricassee. Also halved the cream with evaporated milk. All in all it was delicious and I'll surely be making again...

To be honest, I only made the delicious biscuits using fresh thyme and black pepper in place of dill. However, I look forward to making the entire recipe someday as it sounds great.

Mmmmmm. Very good. I followed the recipe exactly. Very satisfying and warm. It turns out great and freezes well, too.

This was delicious, even though I made a few short cuts. I didn't add the ham and I used plain nonfat yogurt this time in the biscuits since I didn't have any sour cream. They were good, but next time I'll use the sour cream. Rich and satisfying on a blustery night.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and keep thinking about it--itwas delicious and satisfying. I did make a few changes: left out the ham and added some diced squash, zucchini, and red pepper. The biscuits were easy and addictive. I am making the whole recipe again tonight!

I would describe this as "comfort" food. Everyone loved it and it would be a good way to use leftover turkey (substitute for the chicken).

I've been making this dish for 10 years, altering it to have less fat over the years. Everyone always loves it, it can be made ahead and the biscuits are terrific. Regular buttermilk biscuits with dill are less fatty and very good. It's a good buffet dish, and (leaving out the peas) it freezes well.
