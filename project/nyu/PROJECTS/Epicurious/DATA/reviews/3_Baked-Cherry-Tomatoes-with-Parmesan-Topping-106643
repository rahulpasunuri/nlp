Excellent! Easy to make and has a nice presentation. A keeper.

This is a wonderful side dish and really compliments red meat or fish dishes. Great especially for company. One suggestion, don't add the parmesan until after you bake the tomatoes and then put it under the broiler (or you can serve without doing that step either) This is also a great dish if you add a very small amount of garlic! I make this dish often especially when I have company as it just looks beautiful on the table and tastes good too, plus it is so easy!

For some reason the tomatoes and the parmesean part really separated. I had really salty parmesean crust at the bottom and tomatoes that were too sweet. Maybe I should have cut the tomatoes?? Wierd. Just couldn't get it to taste quite right.

A definite keeper in the "I am tired of salad or rice as a side dish...what else should I serve?" category. Very good, easy and tasty. I used grape tomatoes cut in half and added basil. We will definitely add this into our rotation.

We really enjoyed this dish. It has an elegant look and tastes great. I added basil and used grape tomatoes (cut in half). This will definitely be in the rotation of side dishes in the future. It is too tasty, easy and different not to add it.

I enjoy this rating system. The choices are very good for describing recipes. In this case, yes, I liked the dish! No, I didn't love it. A nice simple way to treat cherry tomatoes though, especially if you would like to serve them with a more stongly-flavored entree.

A good basic recipe for cherry tomatoes. I'll make this again, but next time with some several changes to the recipe.

I have made this many times as well, adding garlic, assorted herbs and occasionaly homemade bread crumbs. I use grape tomatoes -- and it's especially pretty when you mix red and yellow ones!

Have made this many times and it is always well received and an attractive side dish. Over time, I have made a few changes to the topping: 1/4 cup fine bread crumbs, 1/2 cup best quality freshly grated parmesan, 2 cloves finely minced garlic, 3 tbsp. finely minced onion, fresh minced parsley and/or basil, lots of fresh coarsely ground pepper. Mix topping thoroughly, then evenly sprinkle over tomatoes and bake/broil as directed. Garnish with fresh snipped chives. The resulting dish is bursting with flavour and is a novel way to serve these little tomato gems. Have even partially "smashed" the finished tomatoes, then mixed into cooked pasta and added a little light cream if not "saucy" enough. Quick, easy and delicious!

I took the advice of previous reviewers and used grape tomatoes cut in half. My guests loved them as so flavorful and colorful. An easy and fast accompaniment to salmon with herbed crust, scalloped potatoes, asparagus with dill sauce, and shrimp caesar salad. Very successful dinner.

Not the world's best recipe but a tasty simple side dish that seems to please every one who's tried it. My review is a carbon copy of the one from Toronto in May of 2003.

I thought this recipe was very good. I used basil infused olive oil. Very simple and delicious!

Terrific and easy. I used Basil infused olive oil which turned out great especially since I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand. I also took previous reviewers advice and added some bread crumbs and omitted the salt. Will definately make this again.

Great!! I used garlic flavored olive oil and added some basil in addition to the parsley. Very easy and a welcome change. Would definitely recommend and make again.

I liked this with the parsley although I could certain see doing it with basil and possibly adding a hit of garlic. Otherwise, a nice, simple way to serve cherry tomatos.

This was good but I accidentally broiled it too long !

Used this recipe as a starting place. Instead of parm. cheese used fresh chopped basil,garlic and italian parsly. Tossed together with oil, then topped lightly with bread crumbs. Cooked the same way as original recipe. Found grape toms. skin too tough, cherry toms. were better. When I made for Thanksgiving, used large hothouse toms., thickly sliced. Handled in the same way as small whole toms. Everyone loved it. Looked nice as well as being a light side dish.

I took advice from another review, and halved the tomatoes. I do think I will use grape tomatoes next time, although these were excellent. I doubled the amount of cheese, so it looked a little more 'together', like a loose caserole. The tomatoes just burst in your mouth, and so much flavor!! I will make this again, for sure.

This recipe is even better with the small grape tomatoes. I can't make enough and it goes with everything.

I used basil instead of parsley. Very good!

My husband and I thought this recipe was very tasty... a great way to serve cherry tomatoes as a veggie side dish! Because the tomatoes are served whole, they don't really "hold" the parmesan and olive oil. I may cut them in half the next time I make this, and then toss them a bit after they come out of the oven. Fresh basil and oregano may be a great addition too!

Edible, but lacking flavor.

This was okay but nothing special. It was quick and easy to make which is a plus. I have leftovers and will add some garlic and toss them with pasta. Perhaps that will improve my opinion.

Have made this dish twice and our family just loves it. What a wonderful use for Cherry Tomatoes and it is so simple.

I guess I must be the first to say Ho Hum -- nothing special. I thought it lacked flavor -- may try it again but add my own touch.

SALTY!!! Great flavor combination, but the tsp of salt is completly unnecessary. I would make this again, without the extra salt next time.
