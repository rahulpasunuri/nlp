I liked the idea of cooking the quinoa and then steaming it to get rid of the extra moisture but, honestly, it was a lot of extra work for a side dish. I also felt it needed more flavor -- definitely some salt at least!

I used Tricolor quinoa added a minced garlic clove and changed the thyme to parsley. My whole family enjoyed it considering I have two pickey eaters I'd make this again.

Great basic quinoa recipe - all you could want in a simply prepared quinoa side dish.

I give this one 2.5 forks. I find quinoa to be bland, so I spiced this one up by cooking the scallions with fresh thyme and chopped garlic. I then threw in the quinoa, followed by raisins and toasted pumpkin seeds. A splash of salt and pepper made it great!

I am a newbie to quinoa and it did take a little longer to steam correctly, I loved the texture but the recipe, written this way, not good. Doctored it to tolerable but will continue to look for that fantastic go to quinoa recipe.

This recipe cooks the quinoa perfectly. I would give it 4 forks, but I felt it needed more jazz. I add little pieces of goat cheese. Delicious.

this was quite bland, even with the addition of grated carrot and some chopped celery and minced garlic. i like quinoa, but this recipe wasn't a good one for it.

One good thing this recipe did was teach me that quinoa is delicious. I will definatly make quinoa again. My problem was with the recipe. I rinsed and steamed it exactly as directed but after steaming for twice as long as the recipe suggested it was still crunchy like uncooked pasta. So I took my half steamed quinoa put it in a sauce pan and cooked it like risotto adding a little liquid at a time until it was cooked through but still fluffy, not mushy at all. That turned out to be a delicious cooking method. Next time I will try it with stock instead of water as suggested by others.

I am convinced! I have had this bag of quinoa for nearly 8 months, and tonight I decided to take the plunge! I am quite glad I did, because my children even ate it! I passed it off as rice, and they didn't know the difference. I would say that it reminds me more of pasta, but, whatever. It definitely needs to be rinsed because it had a strong grain smell, but it doesn't taste like that once cooked! I am impressed with it's fantastic health benefits as well. See Ya rice!

Yes, I will make it again, with the following changes. Quinoa only needs to be rinsed (set in a bowl of water) for an hour, then put it in a seive, rinse it a quick bit more, and that's all. The rinse takes the natural bitter coating from it(the bad tasting coating keeps the birds from consuming it in it's natural environment). I like to throw it in the pan while the onions and garlic are wilting. Add your favorite broth, and other flavors(minced jalepeno,or grated cheese,or bacon, and with no doubt, beans. Red kidney, black, chick peas....chopped fresh spinach too!)Quinoa rules!

I have made quinoa many times; three rubbings/water changes is enough, these days most of the outer "husk" with bitter saponin is already removed. Also, why bother with the two-step cooking method? Just boil for 15-20 minutes, drain and be done. I haven't found it to be mushy when simply boiled as long as you don't over-cook.

My first time making quinoa. Not too labor intensive. I'd add a few more vegetables to jazz it up. Julienned carrots, red onion or leeks and mint instead of thyme may do the trick. I made this with barbecued salmon and a caesar salad.
