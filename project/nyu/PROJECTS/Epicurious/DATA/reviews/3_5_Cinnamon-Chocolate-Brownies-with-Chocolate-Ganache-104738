My roommate discovered these brownies about eight years ago and I begged her for the recipe; I've made them several times a year since then and am always begged for the recipe. Follow the instructions carefully, folding in the hot chocolate mixture gently so as to not disturb the beaten eggs too much. When done correctly the texture here is divine: both fluffy and dense, and even better after sitting 24 hours. The cinnamon adds a nice dimension to the intense chocolate flavor--I don't know how they could be more delicious. They are decadent even without the ganache, but the ganache makes them really special--be sure to use high quality chocolate, especially if you are making the ganache.

I made this for family dinner, and there were no leftovers at all. They were easy to make and didn't take much time at all. Definitely great for chocolate lovers!

For those who have had trouble with the ganache coming off while cutting: place a piece of aluminum foil in the pan, long enough on each end to make a little handle, butter and flour it before pouring the batter in. Bake. After cooling the brownies and pouring the ganache on, refrigerate for a couple of hours. Then, using the foil handles lift them out whole. Place on a cutting board and simply push the knife straight down and carefully remove it. Do not move it back and forth as you usually would. Keeping the knife a little wet will also help. I have not tried this recipe, but I certainly intend to add a little cinnamon to my triple chocolate brownies the next time I bake them.

I melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave, used 1 tsp cinnamon and cooked at 17 min. I forgot about the vanilla until the end. The crust is very crispy and the brownie turned out very tasty but EXTREMELY dry and crumbly. It's not cool yet, but I'm afraid it might not even be cut-able. Also mountains rose out of the brownie, large air-pockets that never really fell back down. I don't think the recipe is bad but this is my first time making brownies and I am fairly disappointed. Maybe someone can give me some helpful advice as to baking in general?

Easy, consistently good brownie recipe with a kick. The texture on these is right between the dense fudgy brownies and the light cakey ones - moist, but not heavy. I skipped the ganache because I found them plenty sweet, and everyone loved the little crust that forms and cracks on the top.

Rating: 0
I made these, but changed them slightly.. when adding the chocolate into the recipe, I used half of what they called for, and 6 oz of ganache I had made the night before with chocolate, butter, and heavy cream. My brownies had to bake 10 minutes longer than called for, and the FIRST night, the brownies taste was... debatable. The result was ultimately delicious. Let them rest one night after baking before eating, and you'll see its worth the wait. The ultra-cinnamon flavor of the 1st night subsides overnight, & the fudginess improves.

Cinnamon and chocolate is my fave combo. These brownies are to die for. Allergic to walnuts, so hazelnuts or macadamias or even plain are all heavenly.

Rating: 4
Absolutely amazing. I've made these with and without the walnuts and both versions are superb. The best part is the ganache "frosting". I make sure to use higher quality choclate (e.g. Ghiradelli), as I think it makes a difference in the flavor. Also, keep an eye on the time when baking, so as not to dry out the brownies too much. These are such a treat!

Rating: 3
The taste was wonderful, but am I the only one for whom an 8 by 8 pan seemed too small? They formed a lovely crust, which rose to the very edge of the pan, and while it did fall after cooling, the crust still left little room for the ganache. As I was bringing them (by train) to a dinner party, I found it inconvenient for the pan to be so full. I wonder if it would work to make them in a 9 by 9 and reduce baking time.

Good chocolate is the key to this recipe, especially for the ganache -- I use Ghirardelli or even Valrhona. It's divine!

While moist, these were surprisingly light and fluffy for a brownie recipe with so little flour in it-- disappointing to anyone who prefers a chewy rather than a cakey brownie. The cinnamon is a nice touch, but overall they were a little too sweet while not being quite chocolately enough.

Rating: 3
Fabulous brownies with an unexpected texture very pleasing to the tongue. I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate, so I used unsweetened chocolate and added one half cup of sugar, and only used one teaspoon of cinnamon. I did not use the ganache which I think would be wonderful because I wanted to top them with vanilla ice cream and sweetened raspberries which were soaked with broken cinnamon sticks and a touch of creme de cassis. This recipe and especially its texure caused silence at the table after the first MMMMMMM's from my guests. They were too busy enjoying to talk.

These were wonderful! I added one ounce of unsweetened chocolate to the semisweet because I like really dark chocolate. They stayed moist for the 5 days it took to finish them. This will be my new favorite brownie recipe!

Very nice. Moist and another dimension with the cinnamon. Will make again. Be careful to not overbake. The brownie acutally forms a crust when baking, actually lifting off the brownie base. Will fall when cooling. Make these as recipe states-forget modification for less fat, etc. These are great!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a crowd pleaser. After cooling, I cut the brownies into 1 inch squares and generously hand dip them in the ganache.

Unbelievable. I love chocolate and cinnamon, and these were heavenly. I tried to make truffles and somehow messed up the recipe - cheap choclate perhaps. Anyway, I used the truffle mixture as the ganache and made the brownie recipe as written. They are beyond compare to any other brownies I've made. They won't last long, and neither will my waistline.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13. I accidentally baked them a bit too long, so they were a little crumbly, but still very good.

Rating: 4
Definitely a more "dressed up", adult version of brownies. My husband especially liked them, and they were very easy to make. The cinnamon gave them a little extra "something"; then again, I am partial to cinnamon. The secret to good ganache (which is NOT the same thing as frosting, BTW...) is to let it set before cutting the brownies. You'll still have a bit of fudgy bits sticking to the knife, but the ganache will stay on.

I was so thrilled to find this recipe. When I first received it in my bon appetit in 2001 I made them several times then for some reason I lost that particular copy of the magazine. Though it has been a couple of years since I have made these, I remember them being absolutely divine! I loved the dense, moist texture created from using so little flour, and the cinnamon added a great twist to traditional brownie flavor. My grandma will also be thrilled I have found this recipe as she has asked me several times if I ever found that lost issue so she could have some of those brownies. Thank You epicurious for carrying back recipes from Bon Appetit!

I thought this was different enough to warrent a test and I wasn't disappointed. The cinnamon was perfect, and I love the ganache. The kids would have prefered brownie from a box, no nuts, but I loved everything! love the idea of making them petit fours, though without the nuts....I'd have to tweak the icing, but will give it a try as the flavor is fab.

It was just OK. I'm at altitude, so I don't know if it caused the brownies to be drier than we're used to and crumbly. The taste was a bit odd and the ganache didn't stick.

Rating: 3
I think the secret to this recipe is underbaking the batter by about 8 minutes and to use the correct pan size. Also I tweaked the ganache by using 1/4 c. heavy cream instead of 3 tbsp. It makes the ganache frosting more pliable and gooey. I also left out the walnuts and decorated the top with whole roasted hazelnuts. Delish.

My brownies turned out more like a very moist cake. I'm not sure what went wrong. The cinnamon was a little strong for me, but my friend said she could barely taste it. So I guess that is personal preference. I liked the taste, but was disappointed in texture. Any tips on how to make these more chewy?

We've made these 3 or 4 times now and they are always super yummy. My husband has a hard time waiting for the brownies and ganache to cool before he digs in! One of our favorite brownie recipes!

A group of us worked with this recipe, but we didn't make the ganache, seeing as how we couldn't find all of the necessary ingredients in the closest store. We also didn't use any walnuts in the recipe. The brownies, themselves, were amazing. Cinnamon makes everything better, and this recipe was no exception to that rule. We had to convert the oven temperature to Celsius, but we found that the brownies took close to 50 minutes to bake, though we checked them periodically. We made hot fudge for the topping, which ended up working very very well! Everyone who tried some of the final product loved the result (the most common response was, "That was gorgeous.") This is definitely going in my recipe box!

Loved the flavor of these brownies. They were highly admired at a Valentines Party. I did have a problem when I went to cut the brownies. The ganache became separated from the brownie. Maybe it was too thick. Would love to know how to prevent that from happening next time.

These are delicious! I omitted the nuts, actually forgot to buy them and sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on them. Served them at a Christmas party I catered....Everyone loved them. I had also made a second dessert that had a mixed berry sauce & noticed a lot of guests also put the sauce on the brownies. The berry sauce recipe can be found here too, called "Individual Cheesecakes with Mixed Berry Sauce" Another good recipe!

These brownies are wonderful. I made a batch to take to work as a treat to my staff. I received many compliments on them and two requests for the recipe. The only way I varied from the recipe was to use light cream and I baked it for 15-20 longer than it called for.

After reading the reviews, I took a chance and made this as one of our Christmas dinner desserts. They came out of the oven looking more cake-y than the photo. However, they tasted wonderful. I am a chocolate and sugar freak--while these were rich, I didn't think they were too sweet--actually, they could have been much sweeter for me. The mild cinnamon flavor was great, and I don't consider myself a cinnamon fan. To prevent the cold topping from cracking, I let the brownies sit at room temp for an hour before cutting. While I wouldn't make these for my kids to nibble on, I would certainly make these for a group of adults to enjoy. If someone else had made these, I'd have been terribly impressed!

As brownies go, I just wasn't impressed. They were just too heavy, too rich, too something - I haven't really been able to put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong - none of my guests turned them away, but there are countless better recipes out there.

I'm sorry, but I did not like this recipe. The brownies were cake-like, not fudgy. The walnuts also clashed with the cinnamon. I will, however, look for a fudgy brownie recipe and add the cinnamon, that part I loved! Has anyone come accross a good fudgy, chewy brownie recipe?

My friend and I had a brownie bake-off where we made five different types of brownies and submitted our products for the ultimate judgement (I brought them to work).

This is a great recipe. I left out the cinnamon completely - too many young kids in my house. Do not overbake, and I echo the reviewer who recommended cutting into squares while still slightly soft - the ganache tends to crack and pull away from the brownie when really cold.

I always regret it when I put a ganache or icing on brownies & I wouldn't make these again. The brownie layer was OK, not great. I guess I just don't like cinnamon in my brownies that much. I agree 100% with the reviewer who recommmended the Que Sera Sara brownies from the Nantucket 'Open House' cookbook by Sara Leah Chase. If the reviewer from so cal tried these, his/her search for the perfect brownie would end abruptly. These are, without doubt, the best brownies I have ever made or tasted. Unfortunately, a convection oven is a 'must' & you must think ahead when making them as they need to rest in the fridge for a minimum of 6 hours or preferably overnight before you can slice them. Entirely worth the wait. I make these a couple of times a year only, when my daughters' pleading wears me down - so rich and delicious you need to schedule an angioplasty for the next day. A word of caution - I never add chocolate to the mix when still warm. According to the 'Joy of Cooking recipe for "Brownies Cockaigne' (another great brownie recipe) this makes the brownies dry & tough. I've found that to be true.

I thought the cinnamon/chocolate ratio was perfect; didn't try the ganache (ran out of chocolate!), but plan to do so next time. As always, using high-quality chocolate makes all the difference. I used a 9X9 pan as well, but I would definitely stick with the 8X8 if you can... it really does make a big difference. Also, as previous reviewers mentioned, you definitely should start checking at around 30 minutes (if not before). It is very easy to overbake these, and 35 minutes is way too long.

I made these to bring to work, and they were a hit. Everyone loves the ganache. The cinnamon is very, very subtle. I used ghiradelli chocolate chips. I'm making them again this weekend to take to a friend's house. They're very easy to make. I used a 9x9 stone dish and only cooked them for about 30 minutes and they are perfect.

This recipe looks very similar to Que Sera Sarah Brownies (which are baked in a convection oven & beating the eggs for 10 min. on high speed) or a version of Palm Beach Brownies. I made these brownies in Abington,VA at The General Store. If you have a convection oven do try them. They are out-of-this-world brownies. Never put frosting on them as they were so perfect without it. A COMBINATION OF WAFER THIN CRUST AND DENSE FUDGE-LIKE INTERIOR. They MUST be baked in a convection oven at 350 about 18 to 20 min.and left refrigerated at least 6 hrs before cutting and serving. Hope somebody tries them and lets us know.

I made these when the recipe first came out in the magazine -- I'm on a lifetime quest for the perfect brownie -- and this could be it. I only used half the cinnamon called for so it would be more subtly cinnamon-y for my 10-year-old; also used the Ghiardelli chocolate chips. Great recipe.

Rating: 3
It's key to not overbake these. The first time I checked them, they were too gooey. The 2nd time (2 minutes later) there were no moist crumbs. So, lesson learned. Also, I recommend cutting them when ganache is still soft, yet set. Waiting too long to cut resulted in frosting separating from brownie. If you keep them in the fridge, just pop one in the microwave for a few seconds and it will be very moist and the topping soft. Yum!
