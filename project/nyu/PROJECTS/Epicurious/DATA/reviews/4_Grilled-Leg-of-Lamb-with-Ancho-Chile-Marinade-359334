This recipe has so much flavor for so little effort, how could one not love it? My husband thought the marinade would be excellent on chicken or steak, as well.

This recipe is wonderful, however, it is spicy! I made it for a large family party, the teenager and adult guests loved it although we couldn't give it to the younger children. You must serve a taziki sauce with it as a compliment and to break the spice.

This a delicious and easy to prepare dish, especially in the summer over a charcoal BBQ.

This has become my standard big gathering dinner. It is simple to prepare, packs huge flavor and wow factor. I get request for it from returning guests. But the best part is my mom, who is not a fan of eating lamb, LOVES this dish.

Outstanding result for a dish that was very easy to make. Everyone LOVED it even though it only marinated 4 hours. It had a wonderful and unusual flavor without being too hot - even for the 6 year old. I'm making it again for another family gathering but this time will let it marinate overnight.

Very interesting set of flavors. Made with 1 Tbsp. of chopped ancho pepper and adobo sauce instead of the powder, which gave it plenty of spiciness without overpowering. Then broiled in the oven, and worked just as well. Served with butternut squash and wilted spinach. Yum.

I'm making this today, but was thinking of throwing in some Chipotle spice as well but have no idea if this will be awesome or terrible. Advice?

Of all the grilled lamb recipes I tried this was the least appealing. Somehow ancho chile powder does not go well with lamb, IMO. Not bad, but I'll continue using the herb-based marinade recipes.

This was amazing! Definitely marinate for the full 24 hours. The flavor is delicious and the aroma divine. It didn't have as much heat as I was expecting so I will add more ancho chile next time.

I used this marinade/rub on a 4-lb pork roast for a spring picnic. It was terrific, and got raves. Brought cold sliced pork, pitas, tzatiki, spring mix greens, etc., to make sandwiches - enough for 3 sandwiches per person - and had no leftovers on the pork and only one pita left. (We had an array of salads - green, Israeli couscous, fruit - to go with it, and peach-raspberry cobbler for dessert.) I tried a bit of the pork hot when I made it, and will definitely serve it that way sometime. Seriously yummy.

Great lamb recipe. Raw marinade is spicier than how it tastes after cooked. Up the ancho chile powder if you want more heat. Used a butterflied leg of lamb. Served with grilled Mediterranean flat bread, humus and taboule. Easily serves 10 -12.

Fabulous. My husband and teenage son loved this. Overnight marinating made it juicy and tasty. I appreciated not having to chop the garlic or the oregano. Just threw it all in the processor and I was done. Great entertaining dish, since everything but the grilling can be done ahead. I will definitely make this for guests.

Absolutely delicious!! I was only cooking for two, so I sliced the raw leg of lamb into steaks, froze most of it, and marinated two servings for my husband and I in a generous amount of the ancho marinade. I only marinated it for 3 hours, but it had TONS of flavor due to the thinner pieces. One of the best lamb recipes I've ever made, and I make lamb OFTEN. I served it w/ epicurious' "Southwest rice and corn salad w/ lemon dressing" and grilled broccoli. FOUR STARS!

I served this to family members, some of who love lamb and others who had never had lamb. This is a crowd definitely pleaser, to be sure...... and easy too!

Really lovely. Tender, flavourful, and easy to prepare. Was a big hit with my family, and I'll pull this recipe out again when we have company for dinner.

I made this for a dinner party last night. I couldn't get to the store the day before to purchase the lamb, so it marinated for a mere three hours instead of overnight. My guests raved anyway. I could tell that the flavor would have been much stronger had the meat marinated overnight. It was very easy to prepare and I'm looking forward to making it again.

Best leg of lamb recipe ever! So tender and jucy.. perfect amount of spice. Over night marinade a must.
