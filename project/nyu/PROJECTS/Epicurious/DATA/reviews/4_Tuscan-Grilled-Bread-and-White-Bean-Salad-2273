made a balsamic + vinegar + honey + splash of bottled-italian dressing. It was great. I also served it bruschetta-style, instead of mixing the bread in. I used the oven's broiler throughout. Looking forward to making it again.

Forget the bottled dressing...make your own. I'm not a tomato eater, but the beefsteaks were tempting and I tried this recipe. It was wonderful with a grilled flatiron steak (okay, that was marinated in Newman's Own Balsamic Dressing). Definitely will be making it again next time I fire up the grill!

This was great the first day, but even better the second day.

This was fantastic. I was lucky enough to be able to use some homemade sourdough and I left out the bell pepper. I cooked everything on an indoor grill pan. My boyfriend liked it as well. As a side dish, this made more than 2 servings. The most amazing part was that the leftovers didn't get soggy and flavorless!

This is the perfect hearty picnic salad and also works for the no-meat crowd. Toss grilled veggies & beans together the night before, add bread, basil and a splash of dressing just before serving. I added grilled eggplant too. DELICIOUS!!!

Wow, this is great & easy! Used the Parmesan Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe from this site, which was super. Didn't have peppers on hand -- great without. Sprinkled more olive oil on top, and a bit of Parmesan. Will definitely keep this in my regular recipe file.

This was delicious. During the grilling part, I charred the green peppers on the grill and peeled their black skins before adding to the salad bowl. I think adding a red bell pepper to the grilling process would be great. I used a homemade red wine vinegar vinaigrette with Dijon and olive oil and a bit of Good Seasons Italian Dressing seasoning packet (horrors!). Also, last part of recipe calls for mixing the cannellini with the vinaigrette and basil. Do this first to let flavors infuse beans. After salt and pepper to taste, I would recommend spinkling with additional red wine vinegar if you prefer it tangy, or more vinaigrette if it seems dry.

This recipe is the best! So easy to put together and so tasty. We make it at least once every other week during the summer. If you can get the Caesar Salad Splash dressing from the Silver Palate it's so perfect for this recipe. Newton's Own Caesar dressing is really great, too. Can't believe that I'm the first to rate this - we've been making it for a couple of years to rave reviews!
