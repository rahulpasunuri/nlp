Fantastic! I was having flashbacks to the '70s, but it was super good. Easy to make. The mushrooms and onions were great. Also added a little extra sour cream.

Very good stuffed potatoes. I made these the day before and refrigerated half, and froze the other half to use later. Turned out perfect - not dry at all as some seem to be.

I have been making this recipe for years now and it's always good. Great presentation and wonderful flavor always gets rave reviews. Also leftover are just as good the next day. If I have bacon on hand I'll crumble some bacon into it as well.

Man, were these good! I added a little crumbled bacon to mine but forgot the cream cheese and they were STILL delicious. I will be making these again and again.

I've been making these OFTEN ever since the recipe first appeared and always to rave reviews. I don't change a thing. Making them again tonight :)

Absolutely incredible! I did add a bit more sour cream as I was making them the day before and didnt want them to dry out, SO good. I served with Filet with Merlot sauce from this sight, WOW!

My family doesn't like mushrooms and I did not have green onions on hand, so I modified the recipe by adding minced spanish onion and added a teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder, and some freshly grated black pepper. I also added an extra ounce of cream cheese. My family went 'bananas'! My sister and my cousin insisted on having the recipe. Definitely another winner here! Thank you Epicurious! Regards, Ruth

These are aways a hit at dinner parties. I usually assemble them a day in advance and let them sit on the counter until they reach room temp. I cover them with paper towels and then plastic wrap prior to putting them in the fridge. I find that the paper towels will hold any condensation that may develope when refigerated.

Excellent! I agree that garlic is a must. I also added a splash of white wine. I did not use sour cream and thinned mixture (was quite stiff) with some milk. Keep watch when baking: a few minutes too much and they flatten.

Rating: 4
I've made many times - always a hit. Usually requires a triple batch. Try small potatoes for a passed appetizer. The melting cheese helps the consistency. Over-baked and they flatten. Forgot the sour cream once and it wasn't missed. Sprinkle skins lightly with salt before filling for those who eat them whole. Try black diamond cheddar for something special.

Rave reviews all the way around. My only additions were to add 2 Tablespoons jarred minced garlic to the saute along with alittle salt. When adding the cream cheese/sour cream and butter if the mixture doesn't appear creamy enough, feel free to add more of each of those ingredients until you achieve the desired consistency or they will bake up dry. Next time before I cut the potatoes in half after baking I will rub the skins with melted butter for those who love to eat the WHOLE POTATO. Really a great recipe!

Rating: 4
One additional note: Many people like to eat the entire potato skin and all, so I would carefully rub the outside of the potato with some melted butter or olive oil before putting the mashed potato mixture into the shell and then return to the oven for the final baking.

Rating: 4
Absolute agreement all the way around the table! Wonderful dish. The only change I made was to add a couple tablespoons jarred minced garlic during the saute of the mushrooms. When you mash the sour cream, cream cheese and butter in pay attention to the texture. If it is too stiff (not very creamy)your final product will be a bit dry. Add additional sour cream and or cream cheese and or butter until you acheive the consistency you desire. Even with fewer mushrooms these potatoes are fabulous and will become a regular on my menu, as I operate a non-profit retreat center.

Made this for supper tonight, I had it alone and my husband ate it as a side. It was fantastic, full of flavor and very easy to make. Maybe next time I may add some chopped cooked bacon.

These potatoes were amazing! Not only did they taste incredibly good, they were so easy to make. I used extra sharp Vermont white cheddar cheese and Gruyere, and added one large portabella mushroom to the mix. I'm not usually an onion fan, but I think it could have actually used a bit more green onion than was recommended. These will definitley be a new addition to my cooking repertoire. Yum!

I followed the recipe and they turned out perfectly. Next time I will experiment with other cheeses and spices just for a different taste.

Very yummy! served as a veg. dinner with sauteed spinach and some fresh bread. I omitted the cream cheese and substituted smoked gouda for the cheddar - gave it a great flavor. Also - don't forget salt and freshly ground pepper on the mushrooms - recipe doesn't mention it, but that seems obvious.

Made this last night using Horseradish Cheddar and grated Romano, which gave it a nice bite. Adding garlic to the mushroom mixture is a must. I made the mistake of baking the potatoes in foil, which made the skins too soft. They fell apart after I scooped out the flesh, but I put everything in a casserole dish and baked it with some extra cheese on top. It was still awesome.

I substituted gruyere cheese,used baby portabellos, and added fresh minced garlic to the vegetable mixture with great results. It really complimented the bourbon marinated grilled steaks.

I didn't use the sour cream, as i thought this would be rich enough. I also added a tin of wild Sockeye salmon to the mixture. Perhaps that's a different recipe, but it was very good and still very tasty the next day cold.

I have made this recipe several times so far and it has been delicious each time. Since you can make it ahead, it's convienant for dinner parties and always gets rave reviews.

I consider myself a connaisseur of potatoes..and this recipe is one of the best twice baked potatoe recipies I have ever tasted. I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream and added some garlic butter that I had left over. I used Montery Jack cheese because I had no cheddar on hand. They were incredible!!!

Our guests just moan when we serve this recipe. It's a keeper. Also good adding baked garlic.

Excellent! I agree that you need to add a lot of salt and pepper before putting the filling back in the the potatoes, but SO good.

I served these potatoes at a dinner party last night. They were delicious! I used sharp cheddar cheese and a bag of assorted frozen mushrooms from Trader Joes. They went perfectly with mozzarella burgers and the green beans with blue cheese and toasted pecans also from this website. I got rave reviews on these potatoes from my guests.

Made these for a dinner party tonight and was pleased with the results. Good dish to make ahead of time. Much better than simply baking potatoes. I did use cheddar instead of white cheddar because that's what I had on hand. I have made similar stuffed potatoes with the addition of artichoke hearts - very good too.

Very good recipie made it for my wife and father-in-law and they both liked it. I will definitely make it again!!

This was fabulous. I added alittle more cream cheese and used sharp cheddar cheese. Remember to taste the stuffing first before putting it back in the potatoes. Adjust the salt and pepper otherwise it will taste bland. Happy cooking!

These potatoes were served to me at a dinner party..I thought they were good but not great. When I made them at home, I used the brown mushrooms, Crimini, as they have a stronger taste than the white mushrooms and I used sharp cheddar cheese and added Parmesan cheese for more taste. I make the entire recipe and freeze the leftovers and pull them out as needed. They freeze well.

Rating: 2
I don't know about this one - rather bland and almost had a sticky texture - perhaps due to the yellow banana potatoes I used. Think would be much better with russet potatoes. But, something seemed to be missing - maybe some garlic or regular onions instead of green onions or even some crumbled cooked bacon or diced ham would liven this up. The jury is still out on this one.

these potatoes are wonderful. i used portobello mushrooms. make sure all liquid is absorbed and they freeze beautiful. i also reheat them on the bbq

I thought these were good, but they missed the "wow" factor. They do need some zip to them. The nice thing about these potatoes, though, is they would be a complement to a lot of other interesting flavors.

A delicious recipe; I don't think they need anything else added to them. They reheat well, and I suspect that they would freeze nicely, too.

Rating: 2
These were good, but not great my family and I thought- they seemed to need a little extra kick (maybe the garlic as other reviewers posted would be good). I also had some troubles keeping them to stand up straight- they tipped over a few times during baking. Other then that they were a nice change from the usual baked potatoes or even mashed.

These were very good. Easy to prepare ahead of time... had some extra's for the next day - they re-heat fairly well ! My guests really liked them, too! Can't go wrong with these !

This recipe is fabulous and it is a real bonus that they can be made ahead. I made them for guests last night and everyone loved them. I used bakers and used one half per serving which was more than plenty. I used light cream cheese and sour cream and only 3 tablespoons of butter total.

Great!!! Easy, too. As for serving size, we used 2 big 'ol baking size potatoes, and my husband ate both halves with a salad for dinner. One half with a salad was good for me. They are full of rich ingredients, but they really aren't too heavy in texture. This recipe is a find!

Excellent. I made these for Father's Day for my in-laws and they received rave reviews!!! One half per person was plenty, and the left overs were great the next day.

Made these for just two of us for a casual dinner and were they ever good! Used usual cheddar as didn't have any white on hand. Next time will add some garlic. Really liked the mushroom flavour.

By far the best stuffed potatoes I have ever made. I am always looking for new recipes for potatoes and this one just went to the top of my all time favorite list. I disagree with the cook who said that two halves was too big of a serving. Once I finished the first half, I dove right in for the second half. Hungry or not, these are delicious.

You MUST try these potatoes! Intended to make for a Memorial Day BBQ that was cancelled. Since I had all of the ingredients, made them tonight for just my husband and myself. They are by far the very best stuffed potatoes I have ever tasted. I added a clove of minced garlic to the mushroom/green onion saute for a garlic kick and they turned out scrumptious. I've had success freezing stuffed potatoes in the past so I wrapped four halves for the freezer. Can't wait to have them again.

These were easy and so incredibly good I can't wait to have them again. I served with Beef Tenderloin with Roasted Shaloots, Bacon and Port and baked asparagus to 16 people and had rave reviews.

This is the first twice baked potato recipe I've made that really worked out significantly better than a regular baked potato. Made them for Mother's Day and my mom felt that two halves (the suggested serving size) was more than a person should be expected to eat...they are pretty rich.

These are really delicious. Made them with Grilled steaks for dinner this evening. Okay, I did change something, I had some leftover Boursin Cheese (Fine Herbes and Garlic) and used it instead of cream cheese, also used light sour cream. They were so rich and creamy, will definitely make them again. The Boursin was so good, will probably use it again also.

I made a lot of substitutions in this recipe- used Brie instead of cream cheese, and light sour cream instead of regular. The flavor was incredible, but I think the brie made the filling a bit too soft. I would add more mushrooms next time.

Since everyone in my family is on diets, I cut a few of the calories by halving the cream cheese, cutting down a little on the amount of cheese and used 1% milk instead of the cream in the mashed potatoes. They were still creamy and delicious and got raves from the family. It definitely goes in the 'to make again' category.

Tasted wonderful, I was generous with the grated cheese topping so they browned up nicely too. Made a perfect dinner with the "Peppercorn Steaks with Bourbon Sauce" recipe and the "Strawberry-Strawberry Cheesecake" for dessert. Nothing but ooohs and aaaahs from all.
