I made the chili powder with guajillo and pasilla chili peppers. Marinated for 6 hours. I liked the chili flavor nitially but it completely overwhelmed the wonderful, natural flavor of the beef. I think a rub or any seasoning should compliment not take over. I didn't enjoy it and neither did my husband.We felt that it might have been better (maybe) if it were not so heavy handed. It wasn't so bad that we had to order pizza and throw out dinner, but it just wasn't good enough to try again.

I have made this many times. I serve it with chimichurri and a friend dubbed it "epic."

Reminiscent of a fabulous dinner that I had at The House of Tricks restaurant in Tempe, AZ. I purchased 1/2# each of ancho, and guajilo chilies at a local Mexican mercado. I knew that the chili powder would be wonderful based on the pungent, jammy aromas of the peppers. If possible buy loose bulk chilies rather than the pre-packaged ones to ensure freshness and flavor. After roasting the peppers I portioned out the 1/4c. and proceeded with the recipe. Used a sweet, smoky paprika also purchased from the mercado, and kosher salt. With only 3 hours to marinate and unrelenting steady rain and wind threatening outside, we conceeded to use our indoor grill on our Wolfe range. As delicious as they turned out, we look forward to grilling them next time. Served with cilantro mashed sweet potatoes, and a red pepper coulis sauce. Our chili powder was mild, so it must be the pasilla chilies that are spicy. Might experiment by adding brown sugar, and cumin next time.

I love this recipe, but you have to like spicy things to agree. I've made it for many people and most everyone gives it rave reviews.

This wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either. If you buy good quality meat there is no need to drown it in chili powder. There are plenty of better ways to cook rib eyes. Don't waste your time with this one.

Succulent! I have made this recipe many times and friends are amazed by how good it is. Don't worry if you can't make the chili powder! Minced fresh jalapenos work, too....it will taste a bit less smokey, but excellent all the same. I don't know what's up with the person who said "Ick". If you love grilled meat, try this. It will leave you craving for more. Oh, and the mashed potatoes and onion strings recipes are super good, too.

This is a classic BBQ. Use fresh ingredients and rub plenty of spice on the steaks. I've used this rub for filets and New York strips, but it is truly exquisite on the ribeyes due to the extra fat content from the steak. Slice the steaks into 1/2" slabs after grilling and let your guests help themselves. I guarantee they'll go for seconds. And don't forget the Pico de Gallo - it is the perfect foil for the dense, rich steak.

This was just plain bad. Both my wife and I didn't like it at all. Two perfectly good steaks went into the trash after a few bites. I won't bother with this ever again. Ick.

This recipe was great!I barbqed the steak on a charcoal grill with mesquite chips and served with Pico De Gallo as directed. I cooked my steaks medium well and served them with baked potato & fresh corn on the cob cooked on the grill wrapped in tinfoil seasoned with butter, horseradish, dijoin mustard, and salt & pepper. This turned out to be a meal to remember on our camping trip.. :)

i have used this over and over - it is fabulous! i serve it with the garlic mashed pots w/corn and is wonderful! always get rave reviews - i do serve a very simple cucumber dill salad as the onions rings are just over the top - some of us still want room for desert!

Stephen Pyles is the head chef at Star Canyon, one of the best restaurants in Dallas. So, being a Texan fond of steak, when I saw his name on this recipe I had to try it. It does not disappoint. Excellent flavor and will definitely grill again. (BTW, dried peppers are not easily available in Utah, so I substituted store-bought Chili Powder - worked out fine.)

We've impressed many friends with this delicious recipe, despite having had to barbecue in the rain, as we live in England. We would make it again, and again and again - with any cut of beef. The sweetcorn mashies is THE perfect accompaniment. Beth & Richard Wood, the keenest barbecuers in England.

GREAT!! Be sure to use plenty of rub, it won't make your steaks too spicy. I've used the same rub on lamb tenderloin and that also worked very well. The rub is a great combination of spicy and sweet.

We liked this whole dinner. Thought the pico de gallo was excellent with the steak--the spice and texture complemented the taste of the steak nicely. Also thought the red chili onion rings and garlic mashed potatoes with corn combined to make this one of our best dinners ever.

Excellent rub! So simple.I didn't read the recipe directions in advance and due to time constraints only chilled it 1hour and the steaks were VERY flavorful and moist. This will be a great standby recipe and it's definitely good enough for company. I served it with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Corn and a layered spinach salad.

On our list to make again for guests - a great rub, a sweeter taste than we had expected, but not disappointing at all. Our dinner guests raved about them! One of the best rubs we've used. Would make the whole menu again (garlic mashed potatoes with saffron corn) except red chili onion rings were disappointing.

Excellent, zippy without being too pungent, while still being pungent enough. We actually had a spare steak that we BBQ'd the next day and it was even better. Though, I wouldn't recommend letting these babies going too long given the salt in the rub.

I don't know if it was the rub, but the meat was really tender and the rub did make it tasty.
