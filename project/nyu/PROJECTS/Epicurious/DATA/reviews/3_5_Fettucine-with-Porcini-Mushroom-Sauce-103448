Enchanting flavor as is. My Italian grandmother made a similar sauce--just add some minced garlic to the shallots and stir in some gorgonzola dolce at the end--for the nights when you want something indulgent and cozy.

Very tasty and lovely comfort food. My 3 year old loved it (but he'll eat anything with mushrooms in it)

An excellent flavorful sauce. I often find dried porcini mushrooms sandy. What I do (and for shitake and other like mushrooms) is to soak the mushrooms in water and then strain the soaking liquid through cheesecloth or a coffee filter to use the flavorful soaking liquid.

This is a wonderful recipe, the best I've tried. As written I'd give it 3 1/2 forks. Next time I make it I will use less butter, it was a little greasy. Great flavor otherwise.

this was a great recipe. next time i make it i will change a couple things though. the porcini's i used were a bit sandy and it was offputting to eat a bite with little bits of sand. so next time I'll soak the porcini's briefly to let the sand settle before putting into the sauce. I used half-and-half instead and finished with cream to thicken. i let my sauce reduce a little too much, so next time i'll add some liquid.

Simple and indulgent - so its great for a cold winter night when you just need easy to prepare comfort food. We added additional fresh mushrooms to give it more substance, and also some sweet marsala wine for added depth. We substituted half and half as well for the whip. Served it with a side of oven roasted broccoli and it was a great complement to the dish. Very enjoyable!

I followed this recipe nearly exactly, with the exceptions of half & half, Smart Balance instead of butter (though why bother!), and homemade pappardelle instead of fettucine. It was delicious! I sent this recipe to everyone I know!

This is very rich. It has loads of flavor but could be overwhelming if a guest were not a big fan of earthy flavors. Easy to make.

I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday - he loves meat, I am a vegetarian! But the porcinis mimicked a meat very well, we both loved it!! Easy to prepare and sooo delicious!

I wanted a recipe to showcase some dried porcinis I brought back from a recent trip to Italy and this did not dissapoint. Per other suggestions, I added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of red wine. I also used chicken better than bouillon w/ a little less water than the recipe calls for to make the sauce thicker. Rich, exceptional and definitely something to serve for company, especially if you can get your hands on some good porcinis.

When I made this recipe for the first time it turned out great! When I made this recipe again I used chanterelles instead of the porcini. I tried morels with this dish and loved it more than the porcini. The morels have more flavour and make this dish earthy. DELICIOUS!

Simple and delicious. Added crimini because they were on hand. Tossed with fresh store-bought ravioli and blanched asparagus made a meal. A keeper!

JenTen had the right idea, the recommendations for portobello in onion was great (as was the cream) use a little red wine to degalze, a strong australian or chilean, gives a great boost

Yum. I took great liberties with this recipe, using it as more inspiration than rule. I used fresh shrooms, half and half and added a little thyme. Also served over cheese ravioli and topped with a little parm. Served with a peppery arugula salad and was perfect.

Hey there- just some feedback on this recipe- first- it turned out fabulous even though I did not make exactly as stated in the recipe. I browned mushrooms (only had fresh portabellos) with onions in the butter. Next I added the cream (a full cup) with -gasp- a chicken buillion cube. I simmered for about 5 minutes (maybe a bit less) and then added about 2 or 3 ounces of parm cheese. I then added some of the pasta and cooked for about a minute to thicken further. I put this over spinich and regular fettucine. It was absolutely delicious. Way easy and way too good for just a few minutes of cooking. WOuld do this for a dinner party! Really a wonderful dish. For those who scoff at not following directly- I can say that I learned italian cooking from my grandmother who used what she had, and what was in season. That's what learning to cook, in my opinion is really about. Buon Appetito and Eet smaakilijk!

I am making this tonight but for the cooks that thought it was too runny - how about a bit of parm or romano instead of flour to thicken? yes more calories, but at this pint with all the cram- who really is counting??? will detail how this works out.

Excellent and too easy! Used baby bella's and porcini's. When you are simmering the sauce do not cover it or it will be too runny.

This was a great, easy recipe. I made it to take to a friend's house for dinner, and it was a hit. Note to future cooks: The sauce was quite runny (and yes, I used dried mushrooms) so I got nervous that it would not taste good ~ it was perfect!

I am so lucky to have porcini mushrooms growing in my yard! I dry my own. Does anyone know how much dried mushrooms equal 1 ounce? (1/4 cup?, etc.)

This is such an amazing recipe - tasty very luxurious. I didn't have dried mushrooms in the fridge so instead I used regular fresh mushrooms (can't imagine how better it will be with shitaki/cremini etc. Only thing that I think is a bit off is that there is WAY too much liquid. I used an 8oz container of mushrooms with only 1 cup broth and 1/2 cup cream and even after reducing it by half had to still add a little flour. But then - ahh, divine. Main recommendation - buy a bottle of refreshing white wine to drink with this meal!! It just screams for wine!! And maybe finish it off with a couple of oranges sliced with grand marnier poured over and a little cinnamon sprinkled on top!! Bon appetite!

this is the best - quick, easy and very tasty. I really like that you don't have to re-hydrate the mushrooms first. I've been looking for a good mushroom pasta recipe, and I found it. I have made it several times, and will defintely add it to my regular meals

My husband and I both loved this dish. Quite easy to make although I do agree with the sauce being a bit too thin. I used half and half rather than the heavy cream perhaps that's why. Next time around, I also think the addition of sundried tomatoes would be nice. Excellent dish!!!Definitely a keeper!!!

This is my first review. I'm a novice cook and didn't get the sauce to thicken up, but still was really good. Made a directed (shocker, I know!). Would recommend it to anyone. Next time, I'm going to try some black-pepper fettucine instead of plain.

To Reno, I haven't made this dish yet, but looking at the recipe I can see how it could turn out watery. First, I think you can probably cut down on some of the broth/cream and also, you prob have to simmer for longer than 5 minutes uncovered to get it to reduce enough. If that doesn't work, you can aways add some flour/cornstarch to thicken it up at the end (dissolve it in liquid first, though). Hope this helps.

This was magically delicious. (Do you suppose it's because of all that cream and butter? Nah!) I added about about 4 sliced sundried tomatoes, which worked out well. Surprisingly, the pasta tasted even better the next day.

We tried this recipe as an alternative to the usual "sunday gravy", complete with homemade fettucine. Unfornately, we were left with very disappointed taste buds. Bland and uninspired, it definitely needs something, but what? An entire salt-lick wasn't enough.

Because I have had problems in the past with sauce consistency, I read all the reviews and carefully followed the instructions for this recipe. To no avail, my sauce still turned out like a thin soup. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Does anyone have any suggestions? My family still loved the flavor so I would like to try this one again.

Good, but didn't have the "fettucine" flavor my son likes so much.

I found this recipe easy and tasty. Instead of chicken broth I used the broth from the porcini mushroom. I also used both fresh criminis and dried porcini. Lots of salt and pepper are a good suggestion too. I used egg noodles (tagliatelle) for the pasta. It turned out very well and my vegetarian friend was very happy. I also didn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

A wonderful dinner . . . I added roasted peppers right before the cream and it gave the sauce added color and flavor. Accompany with some garlic bread and it's a great meal.

This was absolutely the most incredible pasta dish we've ever had, but to be fair - I had the distinct advantage of fresh porcinis (thanks to Martha by Mail). It was absolutely divine. I'm sure it would also be wonderful as written - rehydrating the dried variety - but having the flavor and texture of fresh porcinis was just out of this world. I cooked the mushrooms just til tender, then added the liquids and allowed them to cook for another ten minutes or so until the reduced to a nice sauce consistency. Great recipe as is, but its worth every penny of the exorbitant cost of fresh porcinis if you can find them!

To cut some of the sat.fat and bump up mushroom flavor, I used half the butter required, and added olive oil to fill in; could double the mushrooms but strongly recommend soaking first, not only to clean but also used remaining (l cup) mushroom "broth" (after straining through cloth) in lieu of chicken broth; used half-n-half instead of whipping cream; added handful of chopped basil to sauce near end of cooking. Really good, adults and kids gave 2 thumbs up!

Good and rich and so quick to make. Don't make this if you are on a diet, though! When boiled down just right it tastes like the fettuccini is wonderfully caramelized.

I was looking for a porcini mushroom sauce like one that I had in Rome, and this was it! I only used about 1/2 the butter that the recipe called for and I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream, and it still came out very rich and delicious. I will definitely make this one again.

To my tastes, this recipe is very rich and very good. A few changes - some fresh chopped basil added before serving is a great addition. I can't imagine the recipe without it. Also I didn't have shallots so I used a mixture of a couple of cloves of fresh garlic, 5-6 cloves of roasted garlic, and about a quarter of an onion. The leftover sauce was even better the next day - the porcini mushroom taste was stellar. Use good fresh pasta - it's worth it.

This dish is rich but not overly so. Dried porcini have a delightful, almost sweet aroma and flavor when they are cooked in this way, and this inspired me to add a dash (1/8 tsp.) of nutmeg and somewhat less curry powder -- I often use curry powder to enhance the flavor of mushrooms, and it was effective here as well. I seasoned with red pepper as well as black. Very comforting food. N.B.: Take the warning to rinse the dried mushrooms quite seriously; if they're sandy, you won't know by looking at them, but you will know when you bite into one. Rinsing the mushrooms is a simple matter of submerging the mushrooms in some cold water, swirling them around, and drying them on paper towels until they're needed. This also starts the rehydration process and helps the mushrooms take up flavor from the stock and other ingredients.

My brother and I made this dish for our family of fairly "picky" eaters and they all loved it! I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent and easy. You can add chicken and sundried tomatoes.
