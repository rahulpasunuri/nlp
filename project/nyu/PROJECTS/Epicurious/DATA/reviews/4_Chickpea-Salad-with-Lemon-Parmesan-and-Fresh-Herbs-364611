This was a nice and light side dish for Easter dinner. I served the cheese on the side as we had a few vegans dining with us, and it was still good when I forgot to put the cheese on my own serving.

I made this to bring to a dinner party and it was DELICIOUS. As is, the recipe only serves two so I doubled it and added baby arugula and cherry tomatoes to increase the number of servings. I also added lemon zest--I figured why not since I was squeezing it anyway! I also decreased the olive oil by a tad. I try to keep my salt low, but the coarse salt here is crucial. This recipe is so simple, but tastes incredible. This will definitely be one of my regulars!

Delicious! To be upfront, I substituted feta for the parmesan as some other reviews suggested. This is a very tasty and very easy salad to make and I will make this again for sure.

This was delicious, tangy and fresh! I didn't have any fresh herbs, so used dried basil and ignored the parsley. It was still good enough that I've made it several times since. SUPER easy and fast to make. This recipe's a keeper.

My wife and I are big fans of chickpeas and we loved this recipe as written but especially with the addition of some finely chopped red onion and sriracha sauce. Easy and delicious.

I really liked this recipe. I did take some other reviewers advice and add additional herbs. I also added Basile Tomato Feta cheese along with cherry tomatoes. This recipe is definately better after it sits awhile. I especially loved it the next day! I will be making this again.

I've made this several times and family and friends love it. I think that unless you double or triple the fresh herbs as well as the lemon juice, it could come across as a bit blah. I also add the zest of the lemons to the salad as well. Definitely easy to make and if you cut back on the oil, fairly healthy.

I have made this recipe many, many times since finding it in Bon Appétit last year. I always add chopped or small-leaf arugula to the salad because it adds that wonderful peppery taste which works so well with the other ingredients, as well as some healthy greens. I think that those of you who found this bland will like the addition.

Just ok. I'm not a big fan of hummus and don't use chickpeas much, but I was excited about this recipie. I love beans and it looked fast fresh and easy. The beans were too al dente (canned, organic) and the flavor, while good, was a little one dimensional. I made as is plus siracha as suggested (definitely a plus). Might whip it up again if the ingredients are on hand, but otherwise, meh.

After reading Molly's article, I HAD to try this. Chickpeas were for hummas or a garnish in a salad...my son kept telling me to try other dishes - this is it. Wow, what a refreshing and wonderful way to serve chickpeas. This is great, I can't tell you how many people have asked for the recipe. I have served this as a side at a summer picnic, an appetiser with crackers/tostito chips or just a mid- day snack. Well worth trying just as written and then you can squeak with other hints the next time. Certainly try it as described, the fresh basil, parsley and lemon are so vibrant, it's very good! Thanks Molly, I will keep this one. Great first made, refridgerated or left at room temp. Ummmmmm

One of my favorite chickpea recipe. I make it all the time since I first tried it!

I absolutely love this recipe. It makes an excellent lunch to go - I prep everything except the lemon juice and basil. (I just stick a lemon wedge and a few basil leaves in whole with the salad to prep before lunchtime.) Try a dash of cayenne pepper for a little extra kick!

Wowsers! This is wonderful! This is a perfect work lunch because the longer it sits, the better it gets. I doubled the amount of lemon and added the zest from the lemon as well. The recipe was a breeze to double (or triple for next time). I'll definitely add some siracha or pepper flakes next time. I also skipped the cheese to vegan it up. A little couscous and some arugula on the side and this a perfect lunch. This will definitely be on my regular lunch rotation from now on.

Nice summer salad, made as written, but added 1 more tbsp of basil...yum. To make it a complete meal, made a bed of arugula, salad, and added tuna, grape tomatoes,and pitted kalamata olives. Colorful and good. A bread stick and dry white French wine completed the meal.

Amazing salad! I'm not a huge fan of chickpeas but this will be my go-to recipe. I did add red bell pepper for color and crunch as well as adding extra herbs.

Rating: 3
I had my doubts that such a simple salad could be very exciting - but I was wrong. The tangy lemon, pungent herbs and salty parmigiana are a perfect foil to the mealy earthiness of the chickpeas. I added a few handfuls of torn arugula for added punch. The salad is a breeze to make and it keeps very well, which makes it great for a picnic lunch. I'll definitely make it again.

I used cilantro, red onion, feta and lots of lime. I whisked the lime, garlic, olive oil and salt together as a vinaigrette before I mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients and it turned out great. It'd be nice as a topping on grilled chicken or fish.

Simple, cool and great tasting. I made this a few weeks ago and will be making it again tonight. The first time I made it, I didn't have any fresh lemon juice, but I did have fresh oranges. We liked the orange juice, so I'll be using that again tonight. The only other change I'll be making is that I'll use about twice as much of the quantity of herbs than the recipe calls for.

Made a modified version with what I had on hand: chickpeas, lemon juice, olive oil, fresh garlic clove, dried herbs, and Asiago cheese. The dish just felt like it needed something else with it. Fresh chopped bell pepper? Kalamata olives? This recipe tossed with some fresh cooked pasta and some fish for more of a main course?

I like this simple salad. It is best made with dried garbanzos that you soak and cook. Their texture is better and don't have the canned taste. Make sure to put enough lemon juice.

I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers--this recipe was a little bland. But that is easily remedied by adding more of the herbs. The parmesan and the chickpeas worked really well together, and I enjoyed the cold protein source for the summer months.

To meet a dietary restriction, I used no-salt-added garbanzo beans and did not add any kosher salt. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. This salad still had tons of flavor, and was salty enough to be good thanks to the parmesan cheese. It was DELICIOUS! The only bad thing was that I wanted to eat the entire thing in one sitting :) I will definitely make this again and again.

I served this as my main course one night for dinner and really loved it. I did reduce the liquids to 1 tbsp of lemon juice and 3 tsp of olive oil because I don't like having a lot of extra dressing at the bottom. Also, because I don't really enjoy parsley, I simply omitted it and the basil was still enough flavor for both.

I took this to a pot luck, and there was not a single morsel left in the bowl. As the introduction suggested, I used feta and cilantro instead of parmesan, basil, and parsley.

I am so glad I tried this recipe! Even after I read the article in Bon Appetit, I was still skeptical. I've made many a chickpea salad, with all sorts of fancy ingredients, and have always been underwhelmed. How could something with such basic ingredients be any better? Well, thank you for reviewing, fellow epicureans, because of your high ratings, I decided to give it a try. This is definitely a great chick pea salad (bf tried it and declared "This is the best chick pea dish you've ever made!"). I'm not sure what makes it so special... probably the garlic and the parmesan, but it's definitely good. We eat a lot of vegetarian meals, but I'm not sure this salad would stand up on its own for a dinner (maybe a light dinner on a bed of arugula, as suggested by others). We've been enjoying it as a side to some chicken or fish dishes (replacing rice or pasta... a great way to add more beans!). As a side dish, we still eat the full two servings. If this were your main course, 1 can of chick peas for two people would probably not cut it (I usually double this and we take the leftovers for lunch the next day). Awesome that something so delicious and healthy can be made so quickly and easily using things I almost always have on hand!

So glad I tried this! I was skeptical because chickpeas can be so bland, but the article in Bon Appetit peaked my interested - Wow! Simple and delish! Don't skip the garlic; it is the perfect kick. I was making this with intentions to eat it for a couple lunches, but I finished it all off! I added tomatoes halfway through eating it and recommend it. Nice and fresh. Tuna would probably be good too, maybe even some cucumber. It's very versatile. On a mommy side-note: Even my toddler ate this up! Great way to get a little extra veg in his tummy.

Honestly, I was totally unaware that such an easy, spartan recipe could turn out so delicious. This is superb--I'll definitely be making my own variations on it in the future! I cut back on the parsely, mainly because I have strong preference for the taste of basil.
