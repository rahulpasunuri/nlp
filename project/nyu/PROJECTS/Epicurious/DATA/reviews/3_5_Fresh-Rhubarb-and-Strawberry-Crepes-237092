As an avid rhubarb fan, this was very disappointing. The star anise seemed to overpower all the other flavors, and "if" I were to try this recipe again, I would definitely omit it. In fact, the omission of all the spices would be advised.

I too didn't make the crepes and instead put the sauce over corn bread. It was wonderful!! Substitutions: I used orange juice instead of water and cut the sugar. Left out the liquior.

So delicious and simple! I confess I didn't make the crepes but I did use some shortcakes that I'd made and frozen earlier this year. Instead of the orange liqueur I substituted the peel of one orange during the cooking of the rhubarb. The flavor of this dish was sublime! My guests were blown away at being served such a dessert on a week night, but it was really so simple actually. The little bit of leftover strawberry rhubarb was delicious on my oatmeal the next day, and the leftover syrup is begging to be added to some lemonade! Will definitely become part of my spring/early summer repertoire. I look forward to trying with crepes.

Very tasty. I will make two adjustments in the future. One: watch the simmering time closely on the rhubarb. The 10 minutes suggested was too long and the rhubarb didn't maintain much shape. Two: I reduced the rhubarb syrup to improve the consistancy andto develop a more intense flavor and color. My guests loved this dessert as a reminder that spring is coming.

I made this using frozen fruit and it was great. I'll make it again once I can get fresh. It's a recipe I'm sure I will make again and again.

This recipe sounds devine; I will make it as soon as I can find rhubarb this time of year.
