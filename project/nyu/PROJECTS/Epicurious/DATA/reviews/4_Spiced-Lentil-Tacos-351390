This was great! Even my meat-loving husband loved them and asked for them again. The adobo-sour cream was amazing and definitely made the dish.

My family loves this recipe. It is really good with crispy taco shells, though we have used flour tortillas, which are good too. I do think the recipe as written is way too salty. I have cut the sodium in the past by either using sodium free broth, omitting the added salt, or using 40% reduced sodium taco seasoning.

I made just the lentil part of the meal and it was good, but nothing special. I added a fresh jalapeno and extra spices, and at the suggestion of prior ppl, some thinly sliced kale. It was a nice healthy meal, but not out of the ordinary.

I was sceptical of this but all the glowing reviews were correct. My husband said he would be fine eating this from now on instead of ground beef tacos. Now THAT'S saying something!! My mom tried it and also raved. This goes in my regular recipe collection.

These were painfully salty! I had to dump the whole mixture into a sieve and rinse it off. After that, it was fine, but next time I'd use my own seasonings rather than a packaged taco mix. You never know what you'll get with those. Also watch the sodium content on your veggie broth or, better yet, make your own. We're not low sodium people by any means, but as prepared, this recipe was waaay too salty!

These were interesting, but for vegetarian tacos I prefer using the faux ground beef crumbles that are found in the freezer section at most grocery stores. WARNING: I found the ratio of sour cream to adobo sauce to be waaay off, and I like spicy food. I only used a QUARTER of the adobo sauce and the sour cream came out VERY spicy. I can only imagine that there must be a typo.

I made these for dinner last night -yummy and so quick! My husband and I loved these. I served them with homemade guacamole and corn tortillas! Easy and a great way to get fiber and protein! Had a little left over that I plan to use to make lentil soup.

This is a great way to make tacos vegetarian and healthy! My family raved about these tacos. I also made quesadillas with the lentils, and they were great too. I make my own taco seasoning though, it's much better than the packaged stuff.

This recipe is one of our standard go-to recipes; it's perfect for when you have nothing in the fridge because most of the components keep in the pantry. One comment though, and maybe someone can help me out with this, is that it takes MUCH longer than the recipe states to cook the lentils and I end up using twice the broth that the recipe calls for. Again, I have made this at least a dozen times, but it takes at least 40 minutes for the lentils to cook and I end up using 4 or so cups of broth. Other than that, it's a great method. The leftovers keep very well for a few days in the refrigerator, perfect for a lunch or quick snack. I don't normally bother with the chipotle sour cream, but do occasionally throw a chipotle into the lentils as they cook to get the flavor into the dish. (When I only use one or two from a can, I throw the rest in the freezer, to these are always on hand as well).

This is an excellent, tasty, vegeterian, main course which even the non-veg's in my family enjoyed. I followed the recipe as written, aside from the fact I had only red lentils on hand so used them instead of the brown variety. The next day, I used the leftover filling and sauce in a soft tortilla which I grilled and that was wonderful, too. This is a keeper and I will be making it again soon. You should try it, too!

surprisingly delicious! I made with chili powder, cumin and toasted coriander seeds as recommended by other reviewers. This worked well. My 4 and 6 year olds loved it! Highly recommended. Definitely try it.

I really love this recipe, but have made a few changes to suite my palette. I don't use packaged taco seasoning - too salty. Instead I use cumin, coriander and chili powder. Also, I don't make the sauce - just use canned salsa verde. Love it, love it, love it!

I don't eat meat, but my husband does - and he'd been craving tacos, so I thought I'd give these a try. They were great! Definitely do as other reviewers have suggested and make your own taco seasoning and omit the extra salt - otherwise you're looking at VERY salty tacos. We also used no-salt-added vegan vegetable bouillon instead of veggie broth to cut the salt. Besides lowering the sodium in the recipe, we also used full fat extra sharp cheddar (not a fan of reduced fat cheese) and regular sour cream. Overall a delicious, nutritious, very inexpensive meal that I'll definitely make again!

Fantastic. Some important modifications: Skip extra salt. 2 chipotles makes decent picante heat. Our lentils needed more like 2 hours and ~5 cups of liquid to get soft. Garnish with cilantro, lettuce, tomato, and the sour cream. Delish.

I'm a wanna be vegetarian and this is one of those recipes that makes me think I can do it. My 10 year old boy loves them and my 6 year old is good with them. Easy and delicious, this recipe has become a regular with us. I did make my own taco spices for the recipe - I think I got that recipe on epicurious too.

I love this recipe! Yummy and easy to make. I used my own spices - cumin, chili powder, oregano, etc. instead of packaged. Not as salty. Also, I used salsa verde for the sauce. Just delicious!

My roommate and I loved these! They remind me of the tacos my parents made for us kids, but better! I had black lentils in the cupboard and used those, which worked great. They held their shape really well. This was so easy for a weeknight meal, too. Between the two of us, we only spent about 15 minutes apiece cooking. Perfect!

I don't use the taco seasoning but just add my own spices including cumin, dried chili peppers and chili powder - besides that I follow the recipe pretty closely except I use a higher fat cheese. (I don't think they even make 2% cheddar cheese in Canada.) It's a seriously delicious, fast, cheap and nutritious recipe that might make meat tacos a thing of the past.

These are awesome. I mostly followed the "idea" of the recipe - cooked the lentils in salted water, then sauteed onion, added chili powder and then sauteed the lentils with the onions (less salt than original recipe). And I made the chopped tomatoes into a quick pico (added lime juice, cilantro and garlic). SO GOOD. The chipotle sour cream is fabulous and the lentils are so delicious you'll forget that beef tacos even exist.

I'm a meat-eater but have been really turned off by the smell of meat during pregnancy. These were good but nothing to write home about. Best of all, they don't smell like cooking meat!

This was ridiculously good! We made our own taco seasoning and used French lentils rather than the brown. Since the French lentils hold their shape better, the texture of the final product was very hearty. This will certainly be made again and again in our house.

Great way to easily incorporate lentils into your diet. I was a bit skeptical that it would taste like Taco Bell but it was really good. I used less taco seasoning (as I didn't have the full 2.25 oz) and more chipotles in adobo (because I love them). Turned out great. Not a huge mess in the kitchen either!

This is a great recipe and is on our regular rotation. It is much tastier than the veggie taco mix in stores. I do give the lentils a bit more seasoning than the recipe calls for.

Absolutely delicious. I used green lentils and boiled for around 45 minutes. Used white wine instead of broth. Also used fresh seasoning (paprika, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and oregano) instead of taco mix. Simply topped with yogurt. So so good.

Delicious and satisfying. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2 large carrots and about 1/2 pound of kale when I added the lentils. I incresed the broth accordingly. I also about tripled the spices with chili, cumin and a dash of cayenne; no pre packaged spices. I just topped it with plain Greek yogurt because I dont have adobo sauce. A great recipe and very easy.

I never use a taco seasoning packet anymore so I just used the same combo of spices I normally put on ground turkey tacos (paprika, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, oregano). Very tasty. I had somewhere to be and only cooked for 25mins, they ended up being a little firm. I didn't mind though once they were in a taco shell. I don't do sour cream so instead I topped with pepper jack cheese. mmm, spicy goodness.

we used green French lentils, added extra garlic and seasoning, plus some tomato paste and finely chopped carrots and kale in the first few minutes of lentil cooking. didn't go with the sour cream and chipotle sauce, and made it into a dip with chips (stirred in the cheese and added a little Tapatillo sauce, fresh chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime), and it was delicious. the lentils really make a good substitute for veggie ground round, and i'm sure it would be good as described too--just maybe up the seasoning (and use your own cumin, cayenne, and garlic instead of the taco seasoning).

I think this recipe has potential but as published there is enough salt in this to render it inedible. Next time I'll not add any salt and 1/2 the taco seasoning.

Spiced Lentil Tacos, where have you been all my life? Seriously, this is a vegetarian Mexican food lover's dream. I'm gonna make my own taco seasoning next time (all the packaged ones seem to have too much salt and fake ingredients), but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is by far the best taco recipe - and it is so easy I can make it any weeknight. I have been using diced green chiles or diced jalapenos and habanero hot sauce in the sour cream since my regular market doesn't carry chipotle chiles with or without adobo. ckennedy315 - I don't prefer to mash the lentils, but some people might.

These were excellent! I substituted two tablespoons chile powder, one teaspoon garlic powder, one teaspoon cumin, and a dash salt for the taco seasoning and Greek yogurt for the sour cream. This will be a new staple in my kitchen!

I love this recipe. I use canned lentils instead of dried to cut down on cooking time. I can't find chipotle chiles in adobo sauce anywhere so I use dried chipotle peppers, soak them in hot water to soften, then chop and mix into the sour cream. I prefer these to any meat tacos hands down.

Absolutely addictive! I've already made these twice in two weeks and can't get enough of them! The filling is just as delicious on its own, on top of brown rice, or on a salad...though it makes the most fabulous, filling tacos. Try this--you will be hooked!

This was surprisingly delicious! I will make this part of my regular rotation! The family loved it too! I don't recommend adding the salt though until you see how salty your taco seasoning is since mine was a tad on the salty side, but still tasty. I did not make the sour cream mixture, but just used plain sour cream. I also lightly fried my homemade corn tortillas. Highly recommend this one!

This was a very enjoyable dish. My only complaint is it is much to salty. Half a packet of taco seasoning should suffice. We also used a low sodium chicken broth instead of vegtable broth as thats all we had on hand at the time.

Lentils make a delicious mexican base. I added a diced red pepper to the onions and garlic, and cooked the lentils in a V8/chicken broth mixture to add a tomato base. For seasoning I used a combination of coriander, very spicy chili powder and cumin. They were great!

Wow these are good..I used 2 tablespoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper in place of the taco seasoning (spice combo from my fav beef taco recipe).

I've been making lentils tacos for several years but never considered to stir everything togheter!? I prefer cooking the lentils with onions, garlic and hot sauce and then add the topping, cheese (try with cottage cheese ITS GOOD!!), pieces of salad, green pepers & salsa like original meat tacos. And to oven-grill your taco sheels before stuffing them is a must!! I dont know anyone who didnt like it, even my meat lover friends!!

I made these for dinner tonight and they were delicious. We have been trying to have at least one or two meatless dinners each week. Many have left my husband unsatisfied, but that was not the case tonight! He's not a fan of sour cream, so I ommitted it and added the chipotle chiles right to the lentils - they were divine!

I am eating these tacos as I write this review. They are amazing. This recipe is great because I hate the soy based fake ground beef. These will definitely be a staple in my house. I also had to add a little water and cook a lttle longer. I highly recommend avocado on this also.

This was really pretty good. The kids anjoyed it for the most part. I used Middle Eastern Labne yogurt instead of sour cream, Chipotle Tabasco instead of the chile in adobo (just for convenience and so each person could add as much as they like), and shredded red cabbage instead of lettuce, to increase the nutritional value. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I would definitly make this again for Taco Tuesdays. My fiancee (not vegetarian) even enjoyed it! Chipotle sour cream was YUMMY. I'm in agreement with the reviewer from Brooklyn - next time I'll use more liquid & 45 minutes of simmering to get lentils fully softened. Mine came out a little too firm. Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

Wow! I made these the same day it was the "Recipe of the Day." DB is a vegetarian, so I am always looking for yummy veggie meals. These came out amazing! Modifications: Threw in a couple of handfuls of Chilean raisins into lentils, which I do with ground beef too. Also added 6oz of tomato sauce. Also used a 6oz container of fat free Greek style yogurt, which needed a bit more chili for the heat to come through. A teaspoon of Blue Agave to it made it super because the tiny bit of sweetness played against the spiciness well. It also needed a dash of salt. Lastly, I made my homemade guacamole to go with it all. I think the word "orgasmic" was used...but I am almost too blissed out to remember!

This looks good and I'll try it. Just a note about lentils. They cook nicely in a pressure cooker. Bring them up to temp and cook under high pressure for only 30 - 60 seconds. Let them depressurize on their own, which takes about 15 minutes. If they aren't quite soft enough, you can either bring them back up to pressure for an additional 30 - 60 seconds, or boil them normally for up to 30 minutes.

The lentils will cook faster if you do not cook them with salt. Instead of using taco seasoning, I would add a couple of tablespoons of chili powder and some cumin at the beginning, and add salt after the lentils are tender.

I found the lentils needed significantly more time to cook - after an additional 15 minutes they still had not fully softened. I would recommend using more broth and increasing the cooking time while it is covered.
