Love, love, love this dip! One of my stand-in appetizers when I have company and never fails to please. I use fat-free greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise and these work beautifully. Great for simple snacking with pretzel thins as well.

I admittedly made a lot of changes, but loved the general idea. I broiled the zucchini, and mixed with triple the yogurt called for. Used dill instead of mint -- a bit more than in recipe. Despite all the changes, it was a winner.

Really delicious. I thought amount of garlic was fine. Nice to have a different dip base for a change.
