This is an easy and really delicious way to prepare pork loin. It's a go to recipe for me. The chutney recipe makes a very large portion. I have halved it and feel it is still plenty for a 4lb loin.

Watch your cooking time for the roast very carefully! (I skipped the chutney--maybe next time.) This is a wonderful roast recipe and, because everyone browns the meat differently, yes, your cooking time might be longer (as noted in several reviews) but I just overcooked a 4 lb. roast in just 55 mins. and we all know overcooked pork roast is only good for pork-fried rice! It's also good with "mom's old-fashioned gravy" made from the drippings. If you intend to do this, be sure to use salt-free chicken broth.

Surprisingly kid friendly! My picky husband and 5 and 7 year old kids actually ate this happily, and all said they liked it. I used 2 Fuji apples because that's all I had around and it tasted great.

This was a great pork recipe. I added curry powder instead of allspice, fresh grated ginger and raisins!

Made this last night to rave reviews. Instead of apple chutney I used plum chutney which I already had in the cupboard and it paired wonderfully. This is a fast and easy dish that I will make again. And if you make the chutney ahead of time and have it in the freezer or canned its great for a last min. meal.

Yum! Served this over wine-braised red cabbage with a Rheingau Riesling for dinner this evening and will definitely be making it again! The only changes I made were to cut back on the olive oil used in the chutney (you can get away with less than half if you keep a close eye on the onions) and to swap olive oil for some of he butter (which I also cut back on.)

Yes! Followed recipe with the exception of substituting rice vinegar for sherry (which I did not have). Everyone raved. Will make again, maybe even for a holiday. Not sure why there are so many reco's to chop the onions... slicing worked just fine.

We made this last night and it was delicious. I think we added extra apple and I know we followed another reviewer's recommendation and added craisins. Like many have suggested, chopped the onions instead of slicing. It was a very mellow, fruity-sweet flavor, and the pork was moist and delicious. Definitely would make again and can see this being a really nice 'company' dish.

I agree with most other comments - I like the pork but the chutney didn't work as advertised. Chopping onions would have made it more manageable but still missed something...

Great to read but suffered in execution. Pork was nice and moist but chutney did not live up to expecations. Balsamic turned everthing an odd gray shade.

I made this dish with pork chops, and I served it with a side of collard greens. The only thing I changed was less vinegar, and it was still a little strong. I also topped the pork chop with brie that I had softened in the oven, and then covered that in chutney. It was amazing, I was eating it cold the next day. The brie helped balance out the vinegar in the chutney.

I thought this was really good. Used 1/2 the amount of onions, 1/4 c. each of the vinegars, actually subbing white wine vinegar for the sherry vin. Based on the other reviews, thought I'd go for the lesser amount and add more if necessary (which it wasn't). Chopped the onions instead of sliced as recommended in the last review. Also skipped the last step (using the pan sauce) because we were all hungry and it was just for a weeknight family meal; didn't miss anything in terms of flavor for the chutney. Used 2 pork tenderloins instead of a whole loin. I'd make this again for company, it was good and perfect for this snowy night.

I loved this recipe, I didn't substitute anything and I used a meat thermometer. I would chop the onions next time rather than slice them, sliced, they were awkward to serve. My wife who doesn't like pork could not leave the chutney alone.

The chutney was unimpressive. The pork alone was fabulous. I would make the pork again in a the same way but serve it with a difference acompaniment.

I read the negative reviews on the recipe and just had to give it my vote. This really was a great dish. I omitted the butter and browned the pork in just a TBL of olive oil. I also followed the other suggestions and increased the cooking time to one hour. I didn't have any ground ginger on hand, so I used some pumpkin pie spice in place of the ginger and allspice and it tasted soooo wonderful with the apples. Make this on a cold winter night and you won't be disappointed.

This dish was a hit at Christmas dinner. The chutney made a fantastic accent with the pork roast, which turned out very tender. I received rave reviews from my guests, therefore I would make this again!

As I do the first time I cook a new recipe, I followed this one religiously. My only substitution was that I used black mustard seeds instead of yellow ones. The end result was.... unexciting. Very. Maybe I lack the German cuisine gene, or something, but this recipe reminds me of sauerbraten, and basically to me it just tastes like meat stewed in vinegar. Edible, but nothing to get too happy about. It's better the next day, but it's still not worth making again. Pork loin tends to be almost totally without flavour, so all you get from this recipe is vinegar and apples -- the onion flavour is almost entirely blanded out by the 30 minute saute. Oh, and the cooking time cited in the recipe is not only ridiculous, but dangerous. I had a 2.5 pound pork loin, and it required almost an hour before the internal temperature reached 150.

This dish was surprising at the end. As I was preparing the chutney it tasted as though it would be too strong or tart. The finished sauce was perfectly balanced. I browned the roast a bit longer than the time recommended and roasted it for about 50 minutes. Perfect!

Fabulous recipe. We modified a bit. Initially we roasted the Iowa pork for one hour with rosemary and garlic, tented with aluminum foil and added chicken broth to the bottom of the pan. One hour prior to serving we addes the Chutney to the pan , surrounding the pork. The Chutney soaked up most of the pan juices ... a wonderful mix of flavors. Highly recommend our experiment.

What's with the 35 minute cooking time? How about correcting this obvious error? Otherwise, it looks like a good recipe and easy to make. I will give it a try.

The balsamic vinegar is too strong, I cooked the pork for 1.5 hours and it still wasn't done - 35 minutes??!! I have a lemon marmalade/wine wine/rosemary pork loin recipe that is far better than this one. This took alot more time to prepare!

This is the recipe that turned me into an epicurious.com true believer. I wish it were possible to give it five forks. My wife and I just loved it. Tangy, rich, and altogether satisfying. The chutney is a fair amount of trouble, but it's hard to mess up -- an important consideration, since the bottle of Shiraz was half gone by the time I finished cooking. The dish probably holds well. What do I say to those who turned up their noses at this recipe? Surely their minds have been softened by too much Wonder Bread.

This pork recipe was fabulous. The pork was tender and the chutney added the perfect tang. Previously, the thought of a chutney would have put a recipe into the "too difficult or too time consuming" category. But this recipe was a snap and well worth the chutney making time.

I have made this dish 3 different times now, once for a formal dinner, once for a Sunday dinner with family and once, to practice on my own family. It's very tasty and all loved it, kids and adults alike. It's also pretty easy for a dinner party in that the chutney can be done ahead of time and your time can be spent with guests.

The balsamic vinegar makes the whole recipe look unappealing. I would delete the dark balsamic and substitute with another vinegar. Also, too many onions vs apples. I added one more apple and took out one onion. For color I added dried cranberries. I also thought it was too tart so added more sugar. I would make this again because it's easy to prepare and easy to modify.

This is a wonderful dish and all of our guests were in awe of it! It is lovely enough for Christmas dinner, and the flavors of the chutney with the pork is heavenly. The mustard seeds and vinegars in the apple chutney adds quite a bit of "pop" and it's very aromatic and flavorful. We didn't have one scrap of meat or chutney left. This will become a standard pork treat in our family.

I had my older brother over for dinner this week and we are always competing in the kitchen. I won with this dish. I held back on both vinegars 1/4 cup of each. It was perfect. I served it with white rice and sauteed spinach. The dish has a lot of flavors so the simple side dishes were the perfect complement.

This is a great dinner party recipe. The chutney can be made in advance and re-heated, and the pork can be roasted during the time you are having drinks and salad. The chutney is delicious, and foodies love it, but the unadventurous eaters can eat the pork without it.

I thought the 1/3 cup of balsamic was far too much. Okay but nothing special and not worth the trouble.

The chutney is yummy. I added a tablespoon of honey and a generous tablespoon of Calvados. I like the roasting (actually, it's braising, I think?) in moist heat, as pork roast is so prone to dryness. The whole dish was simple to make.

Chutney is delicious, but be sure to make it *well* ahead of time!! My kitchen stank for two days afterward--luckily I was transporting the dish elsewhere to eat. I served the chutney with a pork roast rubbed with garlic and herbs, which made a great combo. Pork is bland enough to take the intense mixture of flavors.

Great Recipee. This is a great way to tke advantage of all the great fall harvests' of apples. I used Raspberry vinnegar instead of Balsamic vinnegar. I also made the chutney in advance and then at a later time completed the recipee. Make sure and use a meat thermometer so that you do not overcook the meat. Go for it and make it. Enjoy gina.

I don't think there should be any substitutions when you make a recipe for the first time, unless it is an ingredient that you hate. I believe the substitution of mustard for mustard seed was a mistake. The mustard seed gives the chutney just the right flavor. I will make this for company!

This was a wonderful recipe for a family dinner. All present enjoyed the variety of flavours. I reduced the amount of onion but maintained everything else and there was plenty for all 8 of us.

Based on the other reviews, cut the chutney in half. Substituted mustard for mustard seed. Also marinated the pork in apple cider & used 1/2 cider & 1/2 chicken broth as the cooking liquid. The pork took about lhr 15 min to cook. Glazed the pork with apricot preserves the last 20 mins. It was very good but will need to refine.

Disappointing; the first recipe on this site that I wouldn't make again. Cooking time...35mins for a 4 1/2lb roast? I don't think so. Mine took 1 1/2 hrs. Far too much chutney for the roast and what starts out as a chutney becomes more of a gravy when combined with pan juices. Too runny. Just not that good.

The best pork recipe i have ever made. It instantly became a staple in the fall, winter and early spring in my household. i have throw three dinner parties just so i could share it with friends!
