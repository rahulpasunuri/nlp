This is my go to summer dessert recipe. I recently made some for an office that I'm temping in, I can safely say job security! My boss is allergic to dairy and he asked for seconds! I follow the recipe except for the zest (because I don't have a zester) and the fact that its more "rustic" (I don't have a food processor so I put the cookies in a plastic bag and beat the hell out of them). I would recommend this one for anybody that likes light airy flavorful treats.

This dessert was elegant, beautiful and delicious. Make sure however that your nectarines are sufficiently ripe. I didn't omit anything, followed the instructions exactly except for using orange zest instead of lemon because it was unavailable. Lovely.

I made this along with 5 other desserts for a holiday bbq; this was by far my piece de resistance. Everyone loved, loved, loved it. * I only had a 10" tart pan, but aside from using a few more gingersnaps and little more butter, everything else was great. Btw, I used the "Anna's" brand for a better flavor.

I substitute 1/2 portion of both Cream Cheese and Mascarpone with Goat Cheese and have used plain yogurt if out of Sour Cream. This dessert always gets great reviews from friends and family, plus very easy!

Really delicious! The combination of the velvety cream filling and the crispy, buttery crust is just perfect! An excellent combination of flavors. A definite crowd pleaser.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! Everyone who had it, said it was amazing and absolutely delicious. It's a great summer treat, a wonderful way to use your summer fruits. I made the recipe as written but without the candied ginger because it's expensive/ a little harder to get my hands on. It was really good, and i can see it being a very versatile recipe... change up the fruits on top, change up the lemon zest to some other zest... just a great recipe all around!

Made the recipe just as written but I, too, used peaches since they are now in season. Loved it!!! I got everything at Whole Foods and Trader Joes. The only note I would add when using a tart pan (which I used) was to put the pan on a cookie sheet when baking since the butter will leak. My tart pan is of great quality from William-Sonoma's too, so I had a cleanup job in the oven, but otherwise loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!!

Delicious and lovely tart. Definitely include the crystallized ginger in the filling. I agree with another reviewer - chill the tart overnight but top with the fruit just before serving.

Also, I used fresh ginger and the ginger taste didn't come through very well. Might try it again with double the ginger.

Made with peaches instead of nectarines and it was pretty good. The crust is awesome though - I've used it for many other tarts!

After choking on the price of crystallized ginger, I decided to make my own. Bring 1 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar to a boil. Add 1/2 cup peeled and finely sliced gingerroot to syrup and simmer until tender - about 45 minutes. Drain and dry on rack for 20 minutes. Toss with granulated sugar. Fresh, tender & delicious!

This recipe turned out absolutely delicious! I used peaches (what I had on hand) and topped w/ blueberries as well. Also used raspberry preserves instead of peach (what I had on hand). Make sure to top with fruit just before serving, as the tart can build up w/ liquid released from the fruit if chilled together overnite. A real crowd pleaser--just totally fabulous. Will make this again and again!

I won a ribbon at the county fair with this recipe using peaches rather than nectarines. The crystallized ginger in both the filling and as a topping is a MUST. It adds incredible flavor, texture. The crust is a perfect compliment to the dish, too. The reason I don't give this recipe four stars is because I felt the amount of lemon peel overwhelmed the dish a bit. Don't get me wrong -- it's a delicious lemon filling, but it upstaged the peach and ginger flavor more than I wish it had. The tart was magnificently beautiful and could have been on the cover of a food magazine.

This is my new favorite Summer tart recipe (made it twice in the past month). I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. It's so quick and easy yet the presentation is beautiful and flavor terrific.

Wow! So easy and delicious. I put fresh blackberries around the edges and in the middle of the nectarine slices. They tasted great and made for an even more beautiful tart.

Excellent tart and recipe. I followed the directions for the filling exactly as written. I bought the crystallized ginger at Whole Foods in the bulk food section -- much cheaper and fresher to purchase this way. It made all the difference in the filling, though I chose not to sprinkle it on top of the finished tart. Nectarines were out of season so I did an outer layer of mandarin oranges, three layers of strawberries and purple grapes in the middle. The presentation was fabulous as was the taste!

Wonderful recipe. Great made as written. The filling is so fabulous (and so easy- no bake!), that I have started using it as my standard filling with different crusts/toppings. I've made with chocolate wafer crust and fresh mixed berries on top, as well as chocolate wafer crust with a sour cherry topping. Both were delicious as well, I just omitted the ginger. It always gets rave reviews. One comment that I got was that often, fancy fruit tarts look beautiful but the filling is tasteless- basic pastry cream. But in this tart, the inside is just as flavorful as the topping. And so much easier to make than cheesecake!

Excellent - I used a combination of nectarines and blackberries - did not even bother with the jam on top and it was perfect!

Very easy and quick. Gets raves. I used a whole roll of Anna's Ginger Thins for the crust, which worked well.

Ultimate summer treat! I am asked to make this for every picnic and potluck we are invited to. Most people don't believe that is is not from a bakery. I always top with nectarines, raspberries and blackberries (for color) and make a pinwheel design with the slices on top. Do not omit the ginger, it really adds a kick. Even ginger chew candies can be cut up and mixed in if crystalized ginger is hard to find.

For very little effort, this is a show-stoppng dessert. Makes such good use of sweet summer nectarines. My only quibble is that the ginger snap crust didn't quite come up the side of my pan (a 9" springform pan). Despite that, the presentation was very pretty.

This is a wonderful, easy and versatile tart! I made this with a candied kumquat topping which was incredible! I used the recipe for candied kumquats from the Orange Cheesecake with Candied Kumquats recipe from this site. I substituted orange peel for the lemon and used an orange liqueur instead of the vanilla. No matter what topping you choose to use, you can`t go wrong with this tart!

I loved this recipe. The combination of creams makes it very tasty. I also omitted the ginger from the filling, but put it all on top. I like the creamy-ness of the texture (without the interuption of the ginger pieces.) I used a combination of blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. Then coated with apricot jam. It was a hit. My crust was a little hard, but got better the next day. Either I overbaked it, or I may put the filling (not fruit) on a little earlier next time to soften up the crust a little. The flavor of this was so good, it is worth the experimenting for the perfect textures!

I made this for the church picnic in July 2007, and it was the favorite among the three I made (including a triple berry no-bake pie and a black-bottom peanut butter mouse pie). It's tricky to grind the ginger snaps without a food-processor, so next time I will need to buy one. I also had to increase the size of the crust recipe by about half to fit my oversize tart pan. The nectarines are delicious; just be sure to get fairly firm ones. They are impossible to slice if they are slightly soft.

i'm not the best baker, so take this review for what it's worth, but i just didn't think it was that great and it took pretty long to make. also, you really must have the best fruit as that totally makes the dish. it was just ok for me.

Fabulous. I made this for lunch with friends, and it was so delicious that my boyfriend and I ate the last two pieces for dinner. I've made lots of recipes at epicurious, most of them highly rated, and this is perhaps the best of all. Incomparable.

Brought this to a party and made a lot of new friends because of it :) Everyone loved it and it has a lovely presentation. I also sprinkled minced crystallized ginger around the tart on the serving platter for a festive look. The combination of all these flavors is really quite divine.

This is by far one of my top 5 favorite desserts, and I bake regularly. Definitely do not skip the ginger in the filling. This got rave reviews from some very discriminating guests and it makes a beautiful presentation on a hot summer night. A+

This is my favorite way of eating nectarines during the summer. I use almond extract in the filling instead of vanilla and scatter raspberries over the top. Look forward to it every year!

This is an amazing dessert! I made it exactly as the recipe told me to and was wowed! And I'm a tough one to wow. The crust is possibly one of the best crusts I've ever had, the filling is so decadent and creamy (the ginger is a must - do not skip this!) and contrasted with the tartness of the nectarines it is as close to perfect as I've ever had. This would easily be an $8.00 a serving dessert in a four star restaraunt! Don't miss this one!

What's so great about this recipe is you can use almost any fruit. First I used grilled sugared peaches combined with the warm jam. Then blueberries heated in the microwave until they popped, added sugar, more blueberries and raspberries. I think warmed fruit is more fl avorful.

Simple & delicious! Love the no-bake filling. I thought the candied ginger would be overpowering, but it added a nice zip to the filling. Only needed 2-3 small nectarines. We used a 9.5" tart pan.

Made this with peaches and blackberries. So refreshing. Made crust and filling the day before, but kept them separate. I let filling warm up a little before spreading into tart the next day. Kept the crust very crisp and yummy.

Made this according to the instructions including the nectarines, but did not include the jam. It was excellent and unique and not particularly sweet which was refreshing on a hot day. Very important not to overbake the gingersnap crust. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my personal faves. It is absolutely delish and there are never any leftovers. The 9 inch dish makes it hard for a group since everyone wants seconds (and thirds... and...).

I made this dessert 3 times last summer to rave reviews each time. Lost my issue of the magazine and got online to find it again. Fabulous. I have used other fruit, such as blueberries or peaches in addition to or instead of the nectarines.

This is a superb summer dessert. With one exception, I wouldn't change a thing. The crust and the filling are delicious. I like the crystallized ginger, perhaps because I have very tender pieces (almost like gum drops) from Penzeys. My only concern was that I found the 9 inch pan to be too small. The filling almost completely filled the crust and I could barely fit 3 nectarines on top. Aside from that it was easy to make (especially if you prepare the crust and filling ahead, and just delicious.

Wonderful flavors, and you don't need to use the oven for hours - a plus on a summer day. I recreated the recipe exactly. The only tiny flaw is that the juices from the fruit flowed out and made the top edge of the crust soggy. (I made it inthe morning for a dinner party.) If I were making this more than a couple of hours ahead of time, I would fill the tart and reserve the sliced necatrines in a bowl and assemble them on top just a little while ahead of serving. THe crust was too good to ruin!

Very simple and delicious. I did it exactely as described, even with the crystallized ginger: I was scared it would give a bitter taste but it blended wonderfully with all the other flavors. My husband was impressed! I will keep this one for last minute dinners!

This is a good one; the gingersnap crust is wonderful (a patisserie I worked in used one similar to this as the base for many wonderful desserts), and the tart was extremely smooth, without the slitest grit. The no-bake filling only helps the recipe, as there's no risk to burning the top, like a baked cheesecake. I left the ginger out (didn't want chunks to interrupt the smooth filling), and used raspberries instead of my unripe nectarines. Elegant and beautiful, but easy.

Is it me, or does the picture look like it has a WHOLE lot of cream? If you're looking for something spectacular and a wee bit lighter, I would substitute the cream in the Berry Tart with Marcarpone cream recipe.

I was really thankful that this recipe was as successful as it was, because I made it for a dinner party tonight and quickly came to the realization that it was by far the most expensive item on my menu. It's expensive to make, but the unanimous agreement of everyone at the party was that it was truly exceptional. I made it according to recipe, except I didn't have peach jam, so I used apricot. A wonderful blend of flavors and the rich creaminess of the marscapone really made this a winner.

A friend made this for me ( substituting blueberries for the nectarines) and I was bowled over by the fresh and unique taste. I'm making it tonight for a barbecue at another friend's house!

Loved this recipe for the ease in preparation and impressive presentation. From idea for same-day dessert to finding recipe and a quick trip to store, the dessert was finished and refrigerated by 2pm for an 8pm dinner. The guests were impressed, the hostess relaxed and the accolades highly complimentary. Worth a repeat using any summer fruit.

This was okay, but I wouldn't make it again. It was pretty and tasted okay, but I prefer to make really knock-out dessets on the infrequent occasions when I actually make desserts. There are other tart/cheesecake type recipes that I think are more interesting. But I agree it is very simple to make.
