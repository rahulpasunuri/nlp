Great concept, but I found it to be way over the top sweet, and the sauce too sweet and boozy. I used regular granulated sugar since I couldn't find golden baker's sugar, and Ghirardelli White chocolate instead of Green and Black. I have a sweet tooth and this was too much for me. The texture was lovely, though.

What is golden bakers sugar and what would make a good substitute?

Made this for dessert tonight. Truly a 'comfort food' recipe with a twist. Instead of making it on a saucepan on the stove, I used my rice cooker and it turned out perfectly, ever so slightly al dente, and not mushy. Although I had no white chocolate in the pantry, the dark chocolate was just as good. The Marmalade and Cointreau sauce was just the right touch to cut the sweetness and add a bit of zing to the dish. Will make this again!
