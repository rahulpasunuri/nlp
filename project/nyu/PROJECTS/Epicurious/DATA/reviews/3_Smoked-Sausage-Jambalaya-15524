A good basic recipe that needs a lot more flavor. See other reviews for good suggestions for additions. One help is to use chorizo (chourico is Portuguese equivalent) instead of smoked sausage.

I cooked this pretty much exactly to the parameters of the recipe, and it turned out great. I cooked it using hillshire farms kielbasa sausage and it tasted homy, and flavorful.. If i cook it again, ill probably let it simmer longer..

I was very busy and needed a good meal. I had the ingredients so I gave it a try. Not a bad supper at all but not a wonderful jambalaya. I would make it again under the same circumstances. There might be numerous ways to perk it up.

My husband loves this recipe. I have made it several times already and every time he raves over it. So simple and easy to make. Usually I change a recipe slightly but this one I prepare as it states.

After reading so many helpful comments on this recipe, I created my jambalaya with Aidell's Andouille sausage and shrimp. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the chicken broth and Texmati red and brown rice. 45 minutes of simmering yielded a TON of flavor and spice. Next time, I would use just plain tomatoes and omit the green chilies. You can see the entire recipe and photos on my food blog: http://thebellyspot.blogspot.com Thanks for all the great suggestions. I will be back!

this recipe is a solid 2.5 forks. it definitely needs a bit more pep, which i added in the form of extra cayenne, crushed red pepper, and bay leaf. a go-to for a quick weeknight recipe. (a one-pot wonder!)

I loved this, and I didn't add any tomatoes. But I DID omit the celery and add corn, which I liked the taste of. I also added one garlic clove, just to spice things up. My only complaint is that to make it exactly like it says, the sausage is already getting cold. So for that last five minute push, I threw the sausage in to the rice mixture so it could heat up too. Delicious!

I agree with the need to add a little if not alot more spice into this recipe's life. I grew amongst many cajuns who wouldn't any other way. I doubled the recipe for four and gave it more of a Louisiana flavor by adding two cap fulls of Zatarain's liquid crab boil, 1 teaspoon of Zatarain's creole seasoning, and 1 cube of Knorr brand tomato bouillon (gives it color and flavor) to the chicken broth. Also, I recommend adding the veg. mixture and sausage to rice before it's done to allow the flavors to mix well together. Bon appetite, cher!

As written, this is tasty but not exceptional. I used Healthy Choice sausage (it's what I had on hand) but you have to still use oil so it and the veggies don't burn! Why bother! Next time I would use a spicy Aidell's sausage and add a can of tomatoes. I did add extra cayenne and tobasco and some shrimp but I would also consider adding a ham hock or some leftover baked ham. All in all a good simple recipe with all of the food groups but just needs a little more kick. Made this a second time and used a spicier sausage, some chicken and a can of tomatoes and it was fabulous! This freezes very well, too. P.S. Skip my suggestion about the ham hock...not worth the effort!

This recipe was great I use hot & spicy sausages and sautéed the vegetables in the remained oil from the sausages, I also use uncle's bean sun dried tomatoes and basil rice and some ham, it was tasty, easy and spicy just how I thought it would be, I truly recommend instead of using plain rice use a flavored one or add can chunky tomatoes to the rice.

Going against all the other reviews, I found this dish to be bland even using the suggested ideas. Both my husband and I were quite disappointed, and he's typically happy with anything I cook. I think it needs more spices, a lot more.

My husband insisted that I add this to our regular dishes - "one of the best recipes you've tried so far!" i made it with Aidell's Habanero Sausage, and it was deliciously spicy. This recipe also freezes well.

Wonderful. This recipe is easy to make, and has become a week-night favorite at our house. I often add shrimp or marinated chicken to change it up a little..

Although I gave this two forks, I do have to admit that this dish was quite colorful and the rice turned out just right --not too hard or too soggy. Next time, I'll try it with mushrooms and tomatoes.

Wow! I made a bunch of this for a party and it was a huge hit! I added store-roasted chicken and a can of tomatoes as others suggested, and thought it was extremely good. My husband loves my chili and when I told him I was making this instead of my chili, he was very disappointed. But, after trying it, he was more than happy! I'll probably make it again this week. It will be easy to make the night before and then warm up after work for a delicious dinner.

Delicious! I didn't have celery, so I used mushrooms. It still came out great. Everyone loved it. The kids ate seconds, and were disappointed there wasn't enough for thirds!

This was a great, simple jambalaya!! Thanks to the other reviewers I added 1/2 a can of tomatoes, a couple of cloves of garlic and doubled the cayenne. It was good advice! Next time I'll also add chicken for more texture.

great, easy weeknight recipe. needed a few additions however: i.e. garlic!!!! the omission of which would make emeril cry!! and more herbs such as thyme. otherwise i agree with all the previous suggestions of adding tomatoes and chicken and more cayenne pepper.

Great recipe! I'd never had jambalaya before, because I'm not a big fan of shrimp, but this recipe fit my taste pretty well. I did make some changes, as I have a habit of doctoring up just about any recipe I come across. What I changed: used brown rice and about 1 1/2 c. more stock, used bratwurst marinated in beer and dijon (I love kielbasa, but had just had some not long before--needed a different taste), added 1 tsp. beef bouillon concentrate, 1-2 tsp. each Schilling's Garlic & Herb seasoning and Spicy seasoning, used twice as much cayenne as the recipe calls for, added 3 cloves garlic to veggie mixture, and about 1 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder. Needless to say I love garlic, and I really liked my version of this dish. Perhaps I'll try some other different flavor variations next time.

This dish was easy and delicious. I upped the sausage to one pound, left out the celery, added some garlic, and put in a half can of chopped tomatoes. Very, very good.

This is a delicious recipe, though we added some fresh garlic and extra cayenne to make it more flavorful and used sundried tomato-basil smoked sausage. Both my husband and I loved it.

I took advice from those before me and added the can of chopped tomatoes and the rotisserie chicken and it was really good. My husband who usually sits down to dinner with hot sauce didn't use it on this meal and said it was very good. Oh we also cooked it in the crok pot from the addition of the rice on. It took about an hour and a half to cook the rice, but that worked out perfectly for our dinner plans.

We all loved this. My two teens - 16 and 18 - ate every bite. I doubled the recipe (to accommodate the raging appetites), using the specified 1/2 lb.kielbassa and approx. 2 cups of leftover cooked chicken, and I was generous with the doubled veggies. For the chicken broth, I used half Campbell's regular (not low-sodium) chicken broth, half water, and added a scant 1 tsp. of salt. I wanted desparately to add some chopped tomatoes to this, and some chopped parsley if I had some, but had to submit to the kid thing if they were going to eat it. I put in close to 1/2 tsp. of cayenne, and it had some substantial bite, but we are all OK with that. Try this - you'll love it! I'll definitely make this again (and if anyone besides the kids are eating it, I WILL add chopped tomates and parsley!).

This was so easy to make and so good!!! we added some more cajun spice....and for a quick addition we get a rotisserie chicken from the deli at whole foods and break it up and add it to the Jambalaya at the end with the sausage. We have made it several times in the last year.

A quick, easy, aromatic dish. The aroma and spicy flavor of this dish make it pleasing to the eye and pallette. My husband and children liked this dish and I especially liked its easy preparation and easy to find ingredients.
