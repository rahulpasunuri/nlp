I started making this when the September 1998 issue came out (I was 18!!) and still bring this to many gatherings. The only annoying part about this dish is that the peppers are sometimes spicy, sometimes not spicy. Basically I add the seeds if the jalapenos are not hot enough. I can't imagine altering the recipe; I think it's perfect as is!

Pretty easy recipe, excellent flavor. Used more than one jalapeno. Use the food processor, including the avocado.

Unbelievably good, and really easy. I altered the recipe slightly -- I used three serrano chilies, because that's what I had on hand, and I roasted them along with the tomatillos and onion and garlic. I seeded some, but left some seeds in, because I like it spicy, but the roasting mellows the heat a little. My guests raved.

This salsa was fabulous and so simple it instantly became a favorite I'll easily remember so I can repeat it again and again. I roasted the tomatillos until they had dark spots and changed the salt to half-teaspoon, which was just right. We feasted on it over broiled salmon and it was wonderful. Over cheese quesadillas made with a mix of good Tillamook sharp cheddar and Sonoma Jack Pepper cheese, it was to die for. Of course, I used tomatillos picked this morning and perfectly ripe Haas avocados--which makes all the difference when you're making something with very few ingredients.

I am a huge fan of avocados so I decided to try this with grilled chicken. It tasted good but I did not like the texture. Suggestions: add more garlic, coarsely chop the roasted tomatillos (rather than puree) and add some finely chopped, seeded tomatoes. I added a few drops of green Tabasco sauce and lime juice.
